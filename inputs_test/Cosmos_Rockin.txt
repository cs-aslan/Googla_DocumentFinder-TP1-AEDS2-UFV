What planet is this hmm  
Let there be rock n roll  
  
Its a Saturday night and Im home alone  
With the music on quiet Im flying solo  
Then my feet start moving to the sound of the beat  
Put the music up loud hear it in the street  
Then the neighbors start banging on my front door  
Throw the door wide open saying whats your point  
Come on in lets rock this joint  
  
We got the whole house rocking Repeat x5  
To the mighty power of rock n roll  
  
We dance out of the door dance into the street  
And all the people are swaying to the musical beat  
We rock down the road and down to the town  
And all the people stare and smile and they get down  
Then the police man says stop this noise  
But the beat takes over now hes one of the boys  
The beats taken over now hes one of the boys  
  
Come on down lets rock this town  
  
We got the whole town rocking Repeat x5  
To the mighty power of rock n roll  
  
Lets go  
Let it roll  
Are you ready  
Said are you ready  
The cosmos rocks  
Across seven seas through the Panama  
Now theyre rockin on beaches  
And theyre rockin in bars  
Dont ask me how and dont ask me why  
From Miami Beach down to old Bondi  
Theres a rock n roll fever  
In every place  
Next thing you know  
Theyll be rockin out in space  
  
Come on down lets rock this place  
Come on down and  
Sock it to me  
  
We got the whole world rocking Repeat x5  
To the mighty mighty mighty power  
  
We got the cosmos rocking  
We got the cosmos rocking  
We got the universe rocking  
We got the cosmos rocking  
We got the cosmos rocking  
To the might power of rock n roll
