Hey you boy hey you  
Hey you boy think that you know what youre doing  
You think youre gonna set things to rights  
Youre just another picture on a teenage wall  
Youre just another sucker ready for a fall  
  
You gotta fight from the inside  
Attack from the rear  
Fight from the inside  
You cant win with your hands tied  
Fight from the inside  
Ooh ooh aah  
Fight from the inside  
Right down the line  
  
Hey you boy hey you  
Hey you boy think that you know what youre doing  
You think that out in the streets is all true  
Youre just another moneyspinner tool  
Youre just another fool  
  
You gotta fight from the inside  
Attack from the rear  
Fight from the inside  
You cant win with your hands tied  
Fight from the inside  
Ooh ooh aah  
Fight from the inside  
Right down the line  
Right down the line  
Right down the line
