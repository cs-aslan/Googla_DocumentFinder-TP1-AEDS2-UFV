This thing called love I just cant handle it  
This thing called love I must get round to it  
I aint ready  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
This thing this thing  
Called love called love  
It cries like a baby  
In a cradle all night  
It swings woo woo  
It jives woo woo  
It shakes all over like a jelly fish  
I kinda like it  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
There goes my baby  
She knows how to rock n roll  
She drives me crazy  
She gives me hot and cold fever  
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat  
  
I gotta be cool relax get hip  
And get on my tracks  
Take a back seat hitchhike  
And take a long ride on my motorbike  
Until Im ready  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
I gotta be cool relax get hip  
And get on my tracks  
Take a back seat ah hum hitchhike ah hum  
And take a long ride on my motorbike  
Until Im ready ready Freddie  
Crazy little thing called love  
  
This thing called love I just cant handle it  
This thing called love I must get round to it  
I aint ready  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Crazy little thing called love  
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah  
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah  
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah  
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah  
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah  
Crazy little thing called love yeah yeah
