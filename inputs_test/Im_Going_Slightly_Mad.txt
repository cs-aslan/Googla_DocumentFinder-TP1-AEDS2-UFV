When the outside temperature rises  
And the meaning is oh so clear  
One thousand and one yellow daffodils  
Begin to dance in front of you  oh dear  
Are they trying to tell you something   
Youre missing that one final screw  
Youre simply not in the pink my dear  
To be honest you havent got a clue  
Im going slightly mad  
Im going slightly mad  
It finally happened  happened  
It finally happened  ooh woh  
It finally happened  Im slightly mad  oh dear   
Ha ha ha ha ha  
  
Im one card short of a full deck  
Im not quite the shilling  
One wave short of a shipwreck  
Im not my usual top billing  
Im coming down with a fever  
Im really out to sea  
This kettle is boiling over  
I think Im a banana tree  
Oh dear  
Im going slightly mad  
Im going slightly mad Im going slightly mad  
It finally happened  happened  
It finally happened  uh huh  
It finally happened  Im slightly mad  oh dear  
  
Uh uh ah ah  
Uh uh ah ah  
  
Im knitting with only one needle  
Unraveling fast its true  
Im driving only three wheels these days  
But my dear how about you  
Im going slightly mad  
Im going slightly mad  
It finally happened  
It finally happened  oh yes  
It finally happened  Im slightly mad  
Just very slightly mad  
And there you have it
