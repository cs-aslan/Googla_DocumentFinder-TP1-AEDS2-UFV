This is the only life for me  yeah  
Surround myself around my own fantasy  
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself  
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need  
Love is all you need  
  
Do you know what its like to be alone in this world  
When youre down and out on your luck and youre a failure  
Wake up screaming in the middle of the night  
You think its all been a waste of time  
Its been a bad year  
You start believing everythings gonna be alright  
Next minute youre down and youre flat on your back  
A brand new day is beginning  
Get that sunny feeling and youre on your way way  
  
Just believe  just keep passing the open windows  
Just believe  just keep passing the open windows  
  
Do you know how it feels when you dont have friend friend  
Without a job and no money to spend  
Youre a stranger  
  
All you think about is suicide  
One of these days youre gonna lose the fight  
You better keep out of danger  yeah  
That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside inside  
You keep telling yourself its gonna be the end  
Oh  get yourself together  
Things are looking better everyday day  
  
Just believe  just keep passing the open windows  
Just believe  just keep passing the open windows  
  
This is the only life for me  yeah  
Surround myself around my own fantasy  
  
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourselves  
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need  
  
Just believe  just keep passing the open windows  
Just believe  just keep passing the open windows  
  
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourselves  
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need yeah  
Love is all you need  
Oh baby love is all you need  
  
Just believe  just keep passing the open windows  
Just believe  just keep passing the open windows  
  
Just keep passing the open windows  
Just keep passing the open windows  
Just keep passing the open windows  
Just keep passing the open windows  
Just keep passing the open windows  
Just keep passing the open windows  
Keep passing the open windows
