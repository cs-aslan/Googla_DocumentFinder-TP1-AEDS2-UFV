Who said that my party was all over  
Huh huh Im in pretty good shape  
The best years of my life are like a supernova  
Huh huh perpetual craze I said that  
Everybody drank my wine  you get my drift  
And then we took a holiday on Khashoggis ship well  
We really had a good good time they was all so sexy  
We was bad we was blitzed  
All in all it was a pretty good trip  
  
This big bad sucker with a fist as big as your head  
Wanted to get me I said go away  
I said kiss my ass honey  
He pulled out a gun wanted to arrest me  
I said uh uh uh babe  
Now listen noone stops my party  
Noone stops my party  
Noone noone noone stops my party  
Just like I said  
We were phased we was pissed  
Just having a total eclipse  
  
Thats good  
  
This ones on me so let us do it just right  
This here one party dont get started till midnight  
  
Everybody party to the left  party to the right  
Do it all night alright alright  
Should I lay my hands on you all right  
Left right  
Left right noone stops my
