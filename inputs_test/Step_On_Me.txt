Know what I said when I saw you crying  
Hang on thats folly  
I was reeking the head I believed your lying  
Youre just a bad memory  
My life was going to be better  
My why could I never ever see shed step on me  
  
Well I talked to your friend just the other day  
I was gonna look and raise a smile  
And she hid a smile and she aint like you  
Been asleep from all the journeys a little while  
My life was going to be better  
  
Chorus  
My why could I never ever see shed step on me  
Step on me step on me step on me  
Now its so good I wont waste my time  
On a two year old picture of you  
Oh now that youre gone everythings fine  
  
But you probably think that were through  
My life was going to be better  
  
Chorus  
  
But you probably think that were through  
My life was going to be better  
My why could I never ever see shed step on me  
Never ever see shed step on me
