I cant live with you  
But I cant live without you  
I cant let you stay  
Ooh but I cant live if you go away  
I dont know just how it goes  
All I know is I cant live with you  
  
Yeah Im having a hard time  
Im walking a fine line between hope and despair  
You may think that I dont care  
But I traveled a long road to get hold of my sorrow  
I tried to catch a dream  
But nothings what it seems  
Love is saying baby its all right  
When deep inside youre really petrified  
Lover turns to hater  
On this escalator  
  
I cant live with you yeah  
But I cant live without you  
I cant breathe if you stay  
But I cant bear you to go away  
I dont know what time it is  
All I know is I cant live with you  
  
Were stuck in a bad place  
Were trapped in a rat race  
And we cant escape  
Maybe theres been some mistake  
Were trying to make a high score  
Were walking through a closed door  
And nobodys winning  
Were just sinning against ourselves  
  
Hold on baby tell me its all right  
Angers breaking from the hurt inside  
Passions screaming hotter  
Doin what we gotta do yeah  
  
I cant live with you I cant live with you  
I cant live I cant live  
I cant I cant live with you  
But baby Ill never ever leave you  
  
I cant live with you  
But I cant live without you  
Cause Im in love with you  
Ooh and everything about you  
  
I cant live with you  
No I just cant live I just cant live  
I cant live with you  
Yeah and I cant live without you  
Through the madness through the tears  
Weve still got each other  
For a million years yeah  
  
Ooh yeah  
Yeah I cant live without you yeah yeah  
I cant live without you  
Yeah yeah oh oh oh  
I cant live without you  
I cant live without you  
I cant live without you  
Oh oh I cant live without you baby baby baby  
Without you  
I cant live without you
