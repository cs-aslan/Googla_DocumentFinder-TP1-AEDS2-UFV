Oooh  
The machine of a dream such a clean machine  
With the pistons a pumpin and the hubcaps all gleam  
When Im holding your wheel  
All I hear is your gear  
With my hand on your grease gun  
Mmm its like a disease son  
Im in love with my car gotta feel for my automobile  
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar  
Such a thrill when your radials squeal  
  
Told my girl Ill have to forget her  
Rather buy me a new carburetor  
So she made tracks saying this is the end now  
Cars dont talk back theyre just four wheeled friends now  
  
When Im holding your wheel  
All I hear is your gear  
When Im cruisin in overdrive  
Dont have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive  
  
Im in love with my car love with my car gotta feel for my automobile  
Im in love with my car love with my car string back gloves in my
automolove
