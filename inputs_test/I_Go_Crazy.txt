I took my baby dancing to see a heavy band  
But I never saw my baby till the encore  
She had the singer by the hand  
I didnt want to cry cause I had to be cool  
I didnt want to tell you that youre much too cruel  
Did you have to run off with that doggone fool  
  
Chorus  
All I gotta do is think about you  
Every night and day I go crazy  
All I gotta do is get my hands on you  
You better stay away from me baby  
  
I wouldnt mind the postman if the neighbors didnt know  
Or the gas man electric man man to fix the car  
Id have to let it go  
But you had to bring me down for a rock n roll clone  
Leave me like a sucker standing all alone  
Did you have to run off with that rolling stone  
Go ahead fool  
  
Chorus  
  
So I aint gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more  
I dont want to go and see Queen no more no more  
I aint gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more  
I dont want to go and see Queen no more no more  
  
Now I dont want to hurt you like you been ahurting me  
But you know Ill be watchin  
Rolling on the floor next time youre on TV  
Had enough of your pretending that you know where its at  
Coming on to all the boys like a real spoiled brat  
To think I nearly let you get away with all that  
No way man  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh youd better stay away from me baby  
Baby baby crazy crazy crazy crazy
