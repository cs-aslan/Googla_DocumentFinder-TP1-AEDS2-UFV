Now once upon a time  an old man told me a fable  
When the piper is gone  and the soup is cold on your table  
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination  
That is the sign  
Come tonight  
Come to the ogre sight  
Come to the ogrebattlefight  
  
He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean  
With a mighty tongue he catches flies  the palm of a hand incredible size  
One great big eye  has a focus in your direction  
Now the battle is on  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Come tonight  
Come to the ogre sight  
Come to the ogrebattlefight

Hoooa  
  
The ogremen are still inside  
The twoway mirror mountain  
You gotta keep down right out of sight  
You cant see in but they can see out  
Ooh keep a look out  
The ogremen are coming out  
From the twoway mirror mountain  
Theyre running up behind and theyre coming all about  
Cant go east cause you gotta go south  
  
Aaargh  
Aaaaaaaarghh  
Ogremen are going home  
The great big fight is over  
Bugle blow let trumpet cry  
Ogre battle lives for ever more  oh oh oh  
You can come along  
You can come along  
Come to ogre battle
