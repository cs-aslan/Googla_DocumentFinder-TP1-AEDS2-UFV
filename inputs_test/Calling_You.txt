Calling YouGeorge Michael and Queen  
  
A desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
Someplace better than were youve been  
A coffee machine that needs some fixin  
In a little cafe just around the bend  
  
Chorus  
I am calling you  
Cant you hear me  
I am calling you  
  
A hot dry wind blows right through me  
The babys crying and I cant sleep  
But we both know that a change is coming  
Come on closer sweet release  
  
Chorus  
  
Desert road from Vegas to nowhere
