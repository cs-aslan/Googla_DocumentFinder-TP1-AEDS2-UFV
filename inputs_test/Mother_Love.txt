I dont want to sleep with you  
I dont need the passion too  
I dont want a stormy affair  
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere  
All I want is the comfort and care  
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet   
Mother love ah ha  
  
Ive walked too long in this lonely lane  
Ive had enough of this same old game  
Im a man of the world and they say that Im strong  
But my heart is heavy and my hope is gone  
  
Out in the city in the cold world outside  
I dont want pity just a safe place to hide  
Mama please let me back inside  
  
I dont want to make no waves  
But you can give me all the love that I crave  
I cant take it if you see me cry  
I long for peace before I die  
All I want is to know that youre there  
Youre gonna give me all your sweet   
Mother love ah ha mother love  
  
My bodys aching but I cant sleep  
My dreams are all the company I keep  
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down  
Im coming home to my sweet   
Mother love  
  
Mother love mother love love love love love  
God works in mysterious ways  
Eeeeh dop de dop dep dop  
I think Im goin back to the things I learnt so well in my youth
