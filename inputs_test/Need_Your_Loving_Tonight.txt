No Ill never look back in anger  
No Ill never find me an answer  
You promised me youd keep in touch  
I read your letter and it hurt me so much  
I said Id never never be angry with you  
  
I dont want to feel like a stranger no  
Cause Id rather stay out of danger  
I read your letter so many times  
I got your meaning between the lines  
I said Id never never be angry with you  
  
I must be strong so she wont know how much I miss her  
I only hope as time goes on Ill forget her  
My bodies aching cant sleep at night  
Im too exhausted to start a fight  
And if I see her with another guy  
Ill eat my heart out cause I love her  
Love her love her love her  
  
Come on baby lets get together  
Ill love you baby Ill love you forever  
Im trying hard to stay away  
What made you change  
What did I say  
Ooh I need your loving tonight  
Ooh I need your loving  
Ooh I need your loving  
Ooh I need your loving babe tonight  
Hit me  
  
Ooh I need your loving tonight  
  
No Ill never look back in anger  
No Ill never find me an answer  
Cant be no warning how could I guess  
Ill have to learn to forgive and forget  
Ooh I need your loving  
Ooh I need your loving  
Ooh I need your loving tonight
