Funny how love is everywhere just look and see  
Funny how love is anywhere youre bound to be  
Funny how love is every song in every key  
Funny how love is coming home in time for tea  
Funny funny funny oh  
Funny how love is the end of the lies  
When the truth begins tomorrow comes  
Tomorrow brings tomorrow brings love  
In the shape of things  
Thats what love is thats what love is  
  
Funny how love can break your heart so suddenly  
Funny how love came tumbling down with Adam and Eve  
Funny how love is running wild feeling free  
Funny how love is coming home in time for tea  
Funny funny funny oh  
From the earth below to the heavens above  
Thats how far and funny is love  
At any time anywhere  
If you gotta make love do it everywhere  
Thats what love is thats what love is  
  
Funny how love is everywhere just look and see  
Funny how love is anywhere youre bound to be  
Funny how love is every song in every key  
Funny how love is when you gotta hurry  
Cause youre late for tea  
Funny funny funny oh  
Tomorrow comes tomorrow brings  
Tomorrow brings love in the shape of things  
At any time anywhere  
If you gotta make love do it everywhere  
Thats what love is thats what love is
