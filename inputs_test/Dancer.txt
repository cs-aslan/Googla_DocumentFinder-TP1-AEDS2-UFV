Im not invited to the party  
Been sitting here all night  
Im all alone at the party  
I dont feel alright  
Aint got no black coat  
Aint got no tie  
I gotta shape up now  
Come on baby you gotta know why  
  
Take off  
Dancer dancer  
I cant live with it Im gonna die without it  
Dancer dancer  
Aint no doubt about it  
Dancer dancer  
Why dont you kick off your dancing shoes  
And come and ride with me Cool  
  
Youre the life and soul of the funktion  
It took me all night  
To get hold of the right introduction  
Blew me out of sight  
I taste your lipstick  
I look in your eyes  
You feel fantastic  
My body cries  
  
Take off  
Dancer dancer  
I cant live with it Im gonna die without it  
Dancer dancer  
Aint no doubt about it  
Dancer dancer  
Why dont you kick off your dancing shoes  
And come and ride with me  
Hot space lets go  
  
Yeah can I see you baby  
Dancer dancer  
I cant believe youre dancing  
Dancer dancer  
Cant take you home  
I cant take you dancing  
Dancer dancer  
Bring out the funk and dance the night away  
Dancer dancer  
We got bully  
Dancer dancer  
  
Dancer dancer Repeat  
Dance dance dance dance  
Dancer dancer
