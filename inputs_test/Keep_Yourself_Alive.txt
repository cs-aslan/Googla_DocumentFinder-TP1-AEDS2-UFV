Take off  
I was told a million times  
Of all the troubles in my way  
Mind you grow a little wiser  
Little better every day  
But if I crossed a million rivers  
And I rode a million miles  
Then Id still be where I started  
Bread and butter for a smile  
Well I sold a million mirrors  
In a shopping alley way  
But I never saw my face  
In any window any day  
Now they say your folks are telling you  
Be a super star  
But I tell you just be satisfied  
Stay right where you are  
  
Keep yourself alive yeah  
Keep yourself alive  
Ooh itll take you all your time and money  
Honey youll survive  
  
Ow  
  
Well Ive loved a million women  
In a belladonic haze  
And I ate a million dinners  
Brought to me on silver trays  
Give me everything I need  
To feed my body and my soul  
And Ill grow a little bigger  
Maybe that can be my goal  
I was told a million times  
Of all the people in my way  
How I had to keep on trying  
And get better every day  
But if I crossed a million rivers  
And I rode a million miles  
Then Id still be where I started  
Same as when I started  
  
Keep yourself alive come on  
Keep yourself alive  
Ooh itll take you all your time and money honey  
Youll survive  shake  
  
Ow  
Keep yourself alive wow  
Keep yourself alive  
Oh itll take you all your time and money  
To keep me satisfied  
  
Do you think youre better every day  
No I just think Im two steps nearer to my grave  
  
Keep yourself alive cmon  
Keep yourself alive  
Mm you take your time and take more money  
Keep yourself alive  
Keep yourself alive  
Cmon keep yourself alive  
All you people keep yourself alive  
Keep yourself alive  
Cmon cmon keep yourself alive  
Itll take you all your time and a money  
To keep me satisfied  
Keep yourself alive  
Keep yourself alive  
All you people keep yourself alive  
Take you all your time and money honey  
You will survive  
  
Keep you satisfied
