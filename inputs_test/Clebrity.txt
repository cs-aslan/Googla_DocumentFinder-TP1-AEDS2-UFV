Aint got no hope  
Got no idea  
What to do  
Or why Im here  
Wanna get my face  
On your TV  
I wanna be heard  
I want to be seen  
  
Chorus  
Aint got nothin  
No  
Nothing  
Nothin to show  
Make me a clebrity  
  
I want to be  
A face on TV  
I wanna be on your screen  
Then you can see  
Im a clebrity  
  
I wanna get my features  
In magazines  
See this creature on every street  
On every screen  
Write my life story  
Before Im twenty one  
I got to tell the world  
They may say Im dumb but er  
  
Chorus  
  
I want to be  
A face on TV  
I wanna be on your screen  
Then you can see  
Im a clebrity  
  
I wanna be a star  
In a Broadway musical  
Theyre gonna love me  
I cant sing or dance at all  
Some may say Im lackadaisical  
And if I was real good  
Id stand no chance at all  
  
I want to be  
A face on TV  
Yeah I wanna be on your screen  
Then you can see  
Im a clebrity  
Then you can say  
You knew me one day  
Then you will see  
Im a clebrity  
  
C clebrity  
Wanna be a c c clebrity  
Make my dream come true  
C clebrity  
Wanna be a c c c clebrity  
I wanna be heard  
I want to be seen  
On every TV screen
