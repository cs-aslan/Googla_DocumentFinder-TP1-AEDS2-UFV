Oh yes Im the great pretender ooh ooh  
Pretending Im doing well ooh ooh  
My need is such I pretend too much  
Im lonely but no one can tell  
  
Oh yes Im the great pretender ooh ooh  
Adrift in a world of my own ooh ooh  
I play the game but to my real shame  
Youve left me to dream all alone  
  
Too real is this feeling of make believe  
Too real when I feel what my heart cant conceal  
  
Ooh ooh yes Im the great pretender ooh ooh  
Just laughing and gay like a clown ooh ooh  
I seem to be what Im not you see  
Im wearing my heart like a crown  
Pretending that youre still around  
  
Yeah ooh hoo  
Too real when I feel what my heart cant conceal  
  
Oh yes Im the great pretender  
Just laughing and gay like a clown ooh ooh  
I seem to be what Im not you see  
Im wearing my heart like a crown  
Pretending that youre  
Pretending that youre still around
