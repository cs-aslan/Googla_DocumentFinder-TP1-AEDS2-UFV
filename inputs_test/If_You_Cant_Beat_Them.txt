Keep your chin up when youre feelin lonely  
Dont let them get you down  
Aint no use in your sitting all alone  
Hangin around for someone to call  
Ooh they wont come knocking at all  
Dont run and hide  
Even if it hurts you inside  
So I said  
Give as good as you get  
  
If you cant beat em join em  
Youd better do it  
Cause it makes you feel good  
If you cant beat em join em  
Youre never gonna help yourself  
  
Come on  
Get up  
Youre feelin good  
  
Keep your fingers off my money  
Dont try and pull me down  
Youre takin me out to wine and dine me  
Tryin to wind me round and around  
Invite me to your little contract Ha Ha  
Rumor has it that you could play dirty  
Ill tell you what Ill do about that  
Im playing at the wrong game yeah  
  
If you cant beat em join em  
Youd better do it  
Cause it makes you feel good  
If you cant beat em join em  
Youre never gonna help yourself  
  
If you cant beat em join em  
Youd better do it  
Cause it makes you feel good  
If you cant beat em join em  
Its everyone for themselves  
Move on out
