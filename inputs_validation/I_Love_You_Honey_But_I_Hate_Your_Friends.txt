That fat cat frank got a heart of gold  
Hes got a head of lead hes young but he acts old  
That limp wristed twofisted diplomat  
Better draw a map to see where hes at  
Around and round when he rambles on

We shouldnt give him the time of day  
He doesnt give a damn if we sink or swim

He was there long before armstrong  
He stays loose he says fill her up  
For eternal youth from those swiss docs  
Hes thirty but he feels like sixteen
