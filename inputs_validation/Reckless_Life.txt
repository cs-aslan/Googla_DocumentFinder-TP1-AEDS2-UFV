Im reckless and feelin no pain  
You know Ive got no need to control  
Livin with the danger  
Im always on the edge now  
With million dollar visions that I hold  
Livin like this never ever  
Tore my life apart  
I know how to maintain  
And you know I know my part  
  
On a holiday a permanent vacation  
Im living on a cigarette with wine  
Im never alone cause Ive got myself  
Yes I imitate myself all of the time  
  
Livin like this never ever  
Tore my life apart  
I know how to maintain  
Cause its comin from my heart  
  
I lead a reckless life  
And I dont need your advice  
I lead a reckless life  
And you know its my only vice  
  
Reckless life  
I lead a reckless life  
I lead a reckless life  
And you know its my only  
  
Reckless life  
I lead a reckless life  
I lead a reckless life  
And you know its my only  
Hey hey yeah
