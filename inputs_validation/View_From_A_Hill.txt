Raging waves sweep this heavy heart  
Cold is the colour of the dark  
Find a byway and climb that hill  
Watch the thunder cast a spell  
What did you gain from love  
Dont ask me  
All for the sweetest thrill  
  
I see a view from a hill  oh oh  
I see it perfectly clear and I cry for the dreams that you kill  
Oh oh view from a hill and its only a moment away  
  
Love is a rainfall hard on the head  
No escape though youre soaking wet  
Leave me blinded by your light  
Leave me stranded alone tonight  
What did you gain from love  
Dont ask me  
All for the cheapest thrill  
  
I see a view from a hill  oh oh  
I see it perfectly clear and I cry for the dreams that you kill  oh oh  
View from a hill and its only a motion away
