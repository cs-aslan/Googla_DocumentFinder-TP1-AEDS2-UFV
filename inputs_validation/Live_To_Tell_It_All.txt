True love is understated  
True love is being known  
Oh Ive never felt so connected  
And two hearts have found a home  
  
Chorus  
And no matter how we struggle  
Oh Ill answer when you call  
And well walk away from trouble  
And live to tell it all  
  
Safe in my arms Ill keep you  
Never more to roam  
And I promise to lay down beside you  
When our names are carved in stone  
  
Chorus x2
