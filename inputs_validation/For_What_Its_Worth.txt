Theres something happening here  
What it is aint exactly clear  
Theres a man with a gun over there  
Telling me I got to beware  
  
I think its time we stop children whats that sound  
Everybody look whats going down  
  
Theres battle lines being drawn  
Nobodys right if everybodys wrong  
Young people speaking their minds  
Getting so much resistance from behind  
  
I think its time we stop hey whats that sound  
Everybody look whats going down  
  
What a fieldday for the heat  
A thousand people in the street  
Singing songs and carrying signs  
Mostly say hooray for our side  
  
Its time we stop hey whats that sound  
Everybody look whats going down  
  
Paranoia strikes deep  
Into your life it will creep  
It starts when youre always afraid  
You step out of line the man come and take you away  
  
We better stop hey whats that sound  
Everybody look whats going down  
Stop hey whats that sound  
Everybody look whats going down  
Stop now whats that sound  
Everybody look whats going down  
Stop children whats that sound  
Everybody look whats going down
