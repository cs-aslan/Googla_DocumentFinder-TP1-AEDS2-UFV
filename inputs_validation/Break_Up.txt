Nice tires on da ghini  
You should wanna king me  
Brain dead flow vegetable zukini  
I live on the beach  
She walk around in her bikini  
Girls are like school  
And I cut em like seniors  
Im here to distinguish  
The bears from the penguins  
Life is just a gap  
Get some money in between it  
Glocs like police  
Pumps like fenas  
This beat gettin totaled  
PamKeishaKema  
Sittin on da World  
Thinkin bout a girl  
Pistol on my side  
Paint you like mural  
Digged in my pocket pulled out the party  
Be cool before you get stomped and pulled out the party  
Ha Ha Hollygrove shit im on my Hollygrove shit  
Lookin for a bad bitch I give her dinosaur dick  
Lyrics courtesy of killerhiphopcom  
Big bad flow Weezy fuck the polices  
Church like a choir and a couple of old priests  
Elevator in my crib cause its five floors  
Im not expectin you to have one inside yours hahe  
Vince Young suicide doors haha  
Lifes a bitch now die for her  
  
I have the type of flow nggas dont have to like  
My rhymes is ambidextrous so I dont have to write  
The way Im eating nggas wish they had my appetite  
Straight up out of Texas and Im major like apple white  
I pour four then hit the exit door  
Take a trip to Macys cop the whole second floor  
Hood smell the scent of money coming out my pours  
Yeah my pockets full of dead people like a morgue bore  
I made it from a flyer to the forbes see me  
Young Elvis Freshly yes he flyer than the store  
Dropping babys out and your chicks cheek kicks neat  
Got your son looking up to me like Im 6 feet  
Lyrics courtesy of killerhiphopcom  
Your daughter need someone to save her not me  
Im knocking hoes down like Laila Ali  
Try he and imma put the toaster to ya kidney  
Then I pull off in a Bentley top open like a chimney  
Damn its no ceilings like a Colosseum  
Candy slab paint dripping like gonorrhea  
The way Im leaning Ima nod if I stand still  
Flow harder than an anvil  
Short short  
  
Ok its Gudda hoe  
All about my bills like buffalo  
Your btch under my sheets  
I heard she was an undercover hoe  
Purple got me moving slow  
Like Im in a snail race  
Pop pop pop 3 shots to the head  
Then I pick up my shell case  
Leave em with a pale face  
Yes I am a young money goon  
Your girl like a motion picture she gon be coming soon  
I do a certain rule I pop her like balloons  
I pass her off to Mills then drop her off the tune  
Couple screws lose you wanna play with him  
This is No Ceilings btch roofless like a stadium  
We shut down every fcking spot these btches see us in  
You want us in your club well ngga pay us then  
All grey BM Im getting from my baby M  
She told me get the money and count it for me when I rake it in  
Dont play no games hoe  
You know my name hoe  
GUDDA propane flow
