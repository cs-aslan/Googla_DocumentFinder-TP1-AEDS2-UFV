Finally found a fella  
Almost completely divine  
But his vocabulary  
Is killing this romance of mine  
We get into an intimate situation  
And then begins this characters conversation  
He says murder he says  
Every time we kiss  
He says murder he says  
At a time like this  
He says murder he says  
Is that the language of love  
He says solid he says  
Takes me in his arms  
And says solid he says  
Meaning all my charms  
He says solid he says  
Is that the language of love  
He says chick chick  
You torture me  
Zoom are we livin  
Im thinkin of leaving him flat  
He says dig dig the jumps  
The old ticker is giving  
He can talk plainer than that  
He says murder he says  
Every time we kiss  
He says murder he says  
Keep it up like this  
He says murder he says  
In that impossible tone  
Will bring on nobodys murder  
But his own  
He says Jackson he says  
And my names Marie  
He says Jackson he says  
Shoot the snoot for me  
He says Jackson he says  
Is that the language of love  
He says mmmhmm  
When he likes my hat  
He says tsk tsk tsk  
What the heck is that  
He says woo hoo he says  
Is that the language of love  
He says hep hep with helium  
Now babe were cookin  
And other expressions too ill  
He says were in the groove  
And the groove is good lookin  
Sounds like his uppers dont fit  
He says murder he says  
Every time we kiss  
He says murder he says  
Keep it up like this  
In that murder he says  
In that impossible tone  
Will bring on nobodys murder  
But his own
