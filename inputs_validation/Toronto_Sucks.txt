I hate the skydome and the cn Tower too  
I hate Nathan Phillips Square and the Ontario Zoo  
The rents too high the airs unclean  
The beaches are dirty and the people are mean  
And the women are big and the men are dumb  
And the children are loopy cause they live in a slum  
The water is polluted and the mayors a dork  
They dress real bad and they think theyre New York  
In Toronto Ontario  
  
You know actually I think I hate all of Ontario  
  
I hate Thunder Bay and Ottawa  
Kitchener Windsor and Oshawa  
London sucks and the Great Lakes suck  
And Sarnia sucks and Turkey Point Sucks  
  
I took a trip to ontario to visit Brian Mulrooney  
He beat me up and he stole my pants and he put me in a tree  
I went to see the Maple Leafs and got hit in the head with a puck  
  
I dont even know how they did it I was playing the orgon at the time  
  
Ontariio Sucks  
  
actually now tha I really think about it I think I pretty much hate every
gosh darn province and territory in our countryExcept Alberta yeah I love
Alberta lots of cows trees rocks dirt  
  
I hate Newfoundland cause they talk so weird  
And Prince Edward Island is too small  
Nova Scotias dumb cause its the name of a bank  
New Brunswick doesnt have a good mall  
Quebec is revolting and it makes me mad  
Ontario sucks Ontario sucks  
  
Manitobas population density is 19 people per square kilometer NOw isnt
that stupid  
  
Saskatchewan is boring and the people are old  
And as for the territories theyre too cold  
  
And the only really good thing about the province of British Columbia is that
its right next to us   
  
cause Alberta doesnt suck  
But Calgary does
