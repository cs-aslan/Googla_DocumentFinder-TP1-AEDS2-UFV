Jessie is a friend  
Yeah I know hes been a good friend of mine  
But lately somethings changed that aint hard to define  
Jessies got himself a girl and I want to make her mine  
  
And shes watching him with those eyes  
And shes loving him with that body I just know it  
And hes holding her in his arms late late at night  
  
You know I wish that I had Jessies girl  
I wish that I had Jessies girl  
Where can I find a woman like that  
Like Jesses girl  
I wish that I had Jessies girl  
Where can I find a woman  
Where can I find a woman like that  
  
And Im looking in the mirror all the time  
Wondering what she dont see in me  
Ive been funny Ive been cool with the lines  
Aint that the way love supposed to be  
  
Tell me where can I find a woman like that  
Like Jesses girl  
I wish that I had Jessies girl  
I want Jesses girl  
Where can I find a woman like that  
Like Jesses girl  
I wish that I had Jessies girl  
I want I want Jessies girl
