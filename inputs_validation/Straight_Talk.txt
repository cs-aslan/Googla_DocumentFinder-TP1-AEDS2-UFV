You say youre well and satisfied  
But your body tells me something else  
What is it baby Tell me tell me  
Speak up give it to me straight  
  
Or well never know what you think  
Or what you want  
  
She says shes truly gratified  
But her voice tells me something else  
What is it baby Tell me tell me  
Speak up give it to me straight  
  
Or well never know how you feel  
Or what you want  
  
Unless we teach each other  
What we really feel  
How are we gonna communicate  
And get ourselves together  
  
He says hes never petrified  
But his eyes tells me something else  
What is it baby Tell me tell me  
Speak up give it to me straight  
  
Or well never know what you need  
Or what you want  
  
Unless we teach each other  
What we really feel  
How are we gonna communicate  
And get ourselves together  
  
Im watching your body talk  
Im listening to your double talk  
Straight talks the only way  
Straight talks the shortest way for you and I  
  
Im watching your body talk  
Im listening to your double talk  
Straight talks the only way  
Straight talks the shortest way then the world is one  
  
Straight talks the only way  
Straight talks the shortest way  
Straight talks the only way  
Straight talks the shortest way  
  
Straight talks the only way  
Straight talks the shortest way  
Straight talks the only way  
Straight talks the shortest way  
  
Straight talks the only way  
Straight talks the shortest way  
Straight talks the only way  
Straight talks the shortest way
