When I was just a little child little child  
Happiness was there awhile there awhile  
And from me it It slipped one day  
Happiness come back I say  
  
Cause if you dont come  
Ive got to go looking  
For happiness  
  
Well if you dont come  
Ive got to go looking  
God for happiness happiness  
  
Say that  
Say Im hurting  
And its no sense  
Im hurting Im hurting  
Deep inside  
Oh good god now  
  
Oh hear my cry hear my cry  
Yeah my my my my my my my cry  
  
Been together like school children school children  
Then you hurt me just in vain just in vain  
Oh Lord Im your weary child  
Oh happiness come back awhile  
  
Cause if you dont come  
Im gonna go looking  
For happiness the road is dangerous  
Ive got to go looking  
For happiness happiness  
  
Said Im  
Dont you know Im  
Im hurting hurting inside  
Oh Im hurting  
Who cares  
Who cares  
  
Does the one who love oh  
Feel the pain  
Feel the pain  
  
Does the one who love  
Feel the pain  
Feel the pain  
  
Been together like school children
