Easy in the city  
Easy in the mind  
Easy in the city  
Easy in the mind  
Light is slanting sideways  
Sun is getting through  
Gonna take a taxi  
Gotta get to you  
Easy in the city  
Easy in the rooms  
Isnt it a pity  
Time goes by so soon   
Time goes by so soon  
If I can find the secret in the green  
Ill let you know  
And if you seek a treasure made of silver  
You can go  go  
Easy in the city  
Easy in the rooms  
Isnt it a pity  
Time goes by so soon   
Time goes by so soon  
If I can find the secret in the green  
Ill let you know  
And if you seek a treasure made of silver  
You can go  go  
Easy in the city  
Easy in the mind  
Easy in the city  
Easy in the mind
