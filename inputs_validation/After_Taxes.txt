I feel so good come payday  
I think of all the things Im gonna  
Buy when I pick up my pay  
Dont you know but then they hand me  
That little brown envelope  
I peep inside Lord I lose all hope  
Cause from those total wages earned  
Down to that net amount thats due  
I feel the painful sense of loss between the two  
There goes that bracelet for her arm  
There goes that new fence for my farm  
There goes that brand new Pontiac  
There goes the shirt right off my back  
You can dream about a honeymoon for two  
You can dream but thats about all you can do  
Cause by the time old Uncle Sam gets through with you  
You can buy her a pair of hose  
A little powder for her nose  
And take her down to Sloppy Joes for beer  
And stew them are the facts after tax  
You can dream about vacation in the sun  
You can dream but you cant never have you one  
Cause by the time your good old Uncle Sam gets done  
Youve got just enough for gas  
To see them city limits pass  
And if you get back home fourth class  
Id say you won  
There goes that bracelet for her arm  
There goes that new fence for my farm  
Send back that short wave radio cancel that trip to Mexico  
Forget that brand new Pontiac  
There goes the shirt right off my back
