I just came in here to have some whiskey and beer  
And say howdy to you all  
You all know me its Hank Williams Jr you see  
Hat and shades beard and all  
Now I have heard mmm hmm Ive gotten the word  
About all these silly imposters runnin around  
Let me tell you somethin now they aint real  
They got no scars they got no feel  
Why they dont know nothin about whiskey bent and hellbound  
Now Im looking for a lover and Im looking for some fun  
My name is Bocephus  
Im a son of a gun  
  
Some of us are born with it some of us dont ever ever get it  
Thank God Im a guitar man and its true I love the money  
And its true I love all the honeys  
But the thing I really love is to get down with the band  
  
Not everybody loves me  
But those that do will fight  
Right to the end theyre guitar friends  
From legendary Saturday Nights  
I learned something from Lynyrd Skynyrd  
From my Daddy and Ernest Tubb too  
I do country rock I do blues  
Now Im looking for a lover  
And Im going to have some fun  
Oh my name is Bocephus  
And Im a son of a gun  
  
Some of us are born with it  
Some of em dont ever ever get it  
Thank God Im a guitar man  
Oh its true I love the money  
And I really really love the honeys  
But the thing I really love is to get down with the band
