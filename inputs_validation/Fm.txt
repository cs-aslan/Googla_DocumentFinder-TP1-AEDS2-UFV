Worry the bottle Mamma its grapefruit wine  
Kick off your high heel sneakers its party time  
The girls dont seem to care whats on  
As long as it plays till dawn  
Nothin but blues and Elvis  
And somebody elses favorite song  
  
Give her some funked up music she treats you nice  
Feed her some hungry reggae shell love you twice  
The girls dont seem to care tonight  
As long as the mood is right  
  
FM  no static at all  
  
Give her some funked up music she treats you nice  
Feed her some hungry reggae shell love you twice  
The girls dont seem to care tonight  
As long as the mood is right  
  
FM  no static at all
