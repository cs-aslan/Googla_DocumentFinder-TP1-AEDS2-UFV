I keep forgetting you dont love me no more  
I keep forgetting you dont want me no more  
I keep forgetting that you told me that you  
Didnt want me around anymore  
But these stupid old feet  
Just head for your street  
Like theyve done so many times before  
And this stubborn old fist  
At the end of my wrist  
Keeps knocking on your front door  
I keep forgetting you dont love me no more  
I keep forgetting you dont want me no more  
I keep forgetting about those heartbreaking nights  
Ant those heartbreaking things that you said  
Though its plain as can be  
Youre finished with me  
I cant believe our love is dead  
Though I know in my heart  
Weve drifted apart  
I just cant get it through my head
