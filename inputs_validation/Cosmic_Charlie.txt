Cosmic Charlie how do you do  
Truckin in style along the avenue  
Dum de dum de do da lee do  
Go on home your mamas calling you  
  
Calico Cal ya come tell me the news  
Calamitys waiting for a way to get to her  
Rosey red and electric blue  
I bought you a paddle for your paper canoe  
  
Say youll come back when you can  
Whenever your airplane happens to land  
Maybe Ill be back here too  
It all depends on whats with you  
  
Woke up waiting for a windy day  
Cat on I  since the first of February  
Mama keeps saying that the wind might blow  
But standing here I say I just dont know  
  
New ones come in as the old ones go  
Everythings moving here but much too slowly  
A little bit quicker and we might have time  
To say how do you do before we left behind  
  
Calliope wail like a seaside zoo  
The very last lately inquired about you  
Its really very one or two  
The first you wanted the last I knew  
  
I just wonder if you shouldnt feel  
Less concerned about the people unreal  
The very first word is how do you do  
The last go home your mamas calling you  
  
Calling you oh oh oh oh h  
Calling you oh oh oh  
Calling you oh oh oh  
Calling you oh oh oh  
  
Calling you oh oh oh  
Go on home your mamas calling you  
Calling you oh oh oh  
Go on home your mamas calling you  
Calling you oh oh oh  
Go on home your mamas calling you  
Go on home your mamas calling you
