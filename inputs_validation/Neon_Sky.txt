Words and music by bob seger  
Theres the neon sky that I know so well  
Theres the smoky room where I chose to dwell  
Though I hear your heart many miles away  
The neon sky tells me I must stay  
  
Through the windy field of another land  
I have seen your face girl I have held your hand  
Though I should be there with you there today  
The neon sky knows that I must stay  
  
Cause the devils red but his moneys green  
Thats where Im from oh thats where Ive been  
  
On a dusty stage many years ago  
I chose my road still I hope you know  
That therell come a day with the neon sky  
When well walk into the sun you and I  
  
Yes so he calls beckons unto me  
From the empty hall from the galleries  
And so I must go leave you here today  
Cause the neon sky orders me away  
Yes the devils red but his moneys green  
Thats where Im from oh thats where Ive been
