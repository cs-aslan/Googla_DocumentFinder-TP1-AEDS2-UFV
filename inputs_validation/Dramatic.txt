One more game  
Its time to play  
Play with me  
  
One more game  
  
Just one more game  
Its time to play  
Come play my way  
  
Im no more Mrs Nice Girl  
No playing home ground  
Im not the same girl  
You never rocked my world  
You used me  
Tried to abuse me  
The fame the life the fantasy  
Now back to reality  
  
Your dramatic  
  
The truth that lies cant hide  
Im not by your side  
Ill let you drownd in your drama  
Run to your mama  
See if she can save you  
When Im not around you  
  
So dramatic  
  
No no no no youre not the one I thought you were  
Now theres another ringing my bell  
Im under his spell  
Youre too dramatic  
Understand its over  
  
Baby fuck you  
The things you did and never thought Id get a clue  
Yeah you wanted me to be that faithful to you  
Not let nobodys body touch my body in positions that we only knew  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
Now Im gonna give him what he wants and more  
Do all those explicit things that I told you No  
Places you couldnt go  
You know where Im talking  
You are too dramatic  
  
No no no no youre not the one I thought you were  
Now theres another ringing my bell  
Im under his spell  
Youre too dramatic  
Understand its over  
  
Aww awww awww awww  
Aww awww awww awww  
  
Come and play  
You wanna play  
Come play with me  
  
Youre not the one I thought you were  
Now theres another ringing my bell  
Im under his spell  
Youre too dramatic  
Understand its over  
  
Youre not the one I thought you were  
Now theres another ringing my bell  
Im under his spell  
Youre too dramatic  
Understand its over  
Understand its over  
  
Youre so dramatic
