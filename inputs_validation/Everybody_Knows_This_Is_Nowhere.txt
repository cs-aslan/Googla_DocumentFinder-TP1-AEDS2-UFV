I think Id like to go  
Back home  
And take it easy  
Theres a woman that  
Id like to get to know  
Living there  
  
Everybody seems to wonder  
What its like down here  
I gotta get away  
From this daytoday  
Running around  
Everybody knows  
This is nowhere  
  
Everybody everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
  
Every time I think about  
Back home  
Its cool and breezy  
I wish that I could be there  
Right now  
Just passing time  
  
Everybody seems to wonder  
What its like down here  
I gotta get away  
From this daytoday  
Running around  
Everybody knows  
This is nowhere  
  
Everybody everybody knows  
Everybody knows
