Dont it feel good babe dont it feel good babe  
Cause its so brand new babe its so brand new babe  
  
Dont it feel good babe dont it feel good babe  
Cause its so brand new babe its so brand new babe  
  
And then here we are here we are in this big old empty room  
Staring at each other whos gonna make the first move  
Been doing our thing for a minute and now both our hearts are in it  
The only place to go is all the way  
  
Chorus  
Oh babe Is that alright Is that okay  
Girl no need to be nervous  
Cause I got you all night dont you worry about a thing no no no  
Just go with it go with it go with it  
And I will go real slow with it slow with it  
Its our first time  
Go with it go with it go with it  
And I will go real slow with it slow with it  
Its our first time  
  
Clothes are not required for what we got planned  
Ooh girl your my desire your wish is my command  
Treat you like a princess ooh girl your so delicious  
Like ice cream on a sunny day gonna eat you before you melt away yeah  
  
Oh babe Is that alright Is that okay  
Girl no need to be nervous no no no  
Cause I got you all night dont you worry about a thing no no no  
Just go with it go with it go with it  
And I will go real slow with it slow with it  
Its our first time  
Go with it go with it go with it  
And I will go real slow with it slow with it  
Its our first time  
  
Dont it feel good babe dont it feel good babe  
Cause its so brand new babe its so brand new babe  
  
Dont it feel good babe dont it feel good babe  
Cause its so brand new babe its so brand new babe  
  
Just go with it go with it go with it  
And I will go real slow with it slow with it  
Its our first time  
Go with it go with it go with it  
And I will go real slow with it slow with it  
Its our first time
