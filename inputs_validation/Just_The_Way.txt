This one right here  
This is to let everybody know  
That you gotta know who you are  
And you gotta know whose you are  
Hey I know whose I am  
By the way  
Baby boy wait a second hear me out  
You dont know what youre talking about  
Dont know me or how I roll  
Child of the king your flossin dont appeal to me  
Im not impressed with shopping sprees  
Man your game aint worth my soul  
Hey boy I know what youre looking for and its aint your night  
Hey boy youve got your eyes on me but Ive got my eyes on high  
Hey boy dont you know the difference is in the life Ive found  
Hey boy took one chance it turned my life around  
Its just the way he loves me  
Its just the way he talks to me  
Its just the way he moves me  
Its just the way he sets me free  
Its just the way he loves me  
Its just the way he talks to me  
Its just the way he moves me  
Its just the way he sets me free  
Baby girl I see it from a mile away  
Youre lost and you cant find your way  
Trying to find just who you are  
You need to know  
Youre worth more than your weight in gold  
But gotta let God take control  
Truly be a shining star  
Hey girl I know what youre looking for youre not looking right  
Hey girl youve got your eyes on everything but on the most high  
Hey girl hear me when I say the difference is in the life Ive found  
Hey girl take one chance hell turn your life around  
Its just the way he loves me  
Its just the way he talks to me  
Its just the way he moves me  
Its just the way he sets me free  
Its just the way he loves me  
Its just the way he talks to me  
Its just the way he moves me  
Its just the way he sets me free  
Ive never been so happy repeat
