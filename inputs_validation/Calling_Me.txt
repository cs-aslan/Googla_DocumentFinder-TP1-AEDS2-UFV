Theres a back road leadin off the hardtop  
Halfamile past the slingshot tree  
Wanders round through a million memories  
Its callin me callin me  
  
Theres a white house with fading shutters  
The old front door that never needed a key  
And I hear my Mama in the hush of the evenin  
Callin me yeah shes callin me  
  
Chorus  
And no matter where Im goin  
It reminds me of where Im from  
Just as long as I can hear it  
I know Im not too far gone  
  
Theres a first kiss under the willow  
Love so honest it was hard to believe  
And even when my heart is breakin  
Its callin me callin me  
  
Yes its callin me  
Oh yeah yeah  
Callin me callin me  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a tiny country chapel  
Filled with voices singin harmony  
And when my soul is lost in the silence  
Oh its callin yes its callin me  
  
Yes its callin me  
Callin me  
Callin  
Oh its callin  
Yes its callin me
