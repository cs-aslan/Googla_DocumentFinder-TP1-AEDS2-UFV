My baby talks in his sleep  
I said wake him up  
Shes out on good behaviour  
Even daddies love wont save her  
I said my prayers as I suck on the medicine jar  
Im bound in his reflection  
We drink his mothers milk with conviction  
My baby cries on the cross as she bled him dry  
Drink ocean deep theres plenty  
Oh baby go to sleep its empty  
I said my prayers in the medicine jar  
I dry my tears  
I hide my fears  
I drown in arrears  
In the medicine jar
