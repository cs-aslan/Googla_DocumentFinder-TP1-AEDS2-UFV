He runs through the street  
Cause his houses falling down  
And his eyes are burning as they touch the ground  
The baseball cap wont hide the pain  
Theres no one here today  
He runs through a house  
And he looks for food  
He feels so bad  
But he knows hes good  
He lays down on the kitchenfloor  
He aint hungry no more  
Little boy lost  
In little boy land  
How much does it cost  
To understand  
Little boy say  
Why do you cry  
And how much will you pay  
To know why  
Sometimes at night he wets his bed  
As you stay playing tricks inside his head  
He waits so cold  
For a longer life  
Theres no one here tonight  
Little boy lost  
In little boy land  
How much does it cost  
To understand  
Little boy say  
Why do you cry  
And how much will you pay  
To know why
