You are my special someone  
All I will ever need  
I know Id be lost without you  
I hope youd be lost without me  
Ive searched alone  
But your the only one  
Youre what I want  
When things are said and done  
I guess I only needed  
Someone who was just like you  
Someone whod be  
My special someone too  
I stumbled down loves main highway  
But not without takin some falls  
Ive seen my illusions fly away  
Until I had none left at all  
And then you rescued  
What was left of me  
What maybe some would call a fantasy  
But me Id have to say it only proves  
How strange love moves  
I need to be your special someone too  
Cause what I needed most  
Is what she gave to me  
And where she lays her head  
Is where I want to be  
Theres something wrong with losing  
What we finally found  
Now when Ive lost my way  
Ive got my special someone round  
And when she needed love  
She found it here with me  
Now where I lay my head  
Is where she wants to be  
Ive got a secret but its one  
Thats hard to keep  
I want to tell the world  
That special someone is my girl  
That special someone is my girl  
She wants to be my special someone too
