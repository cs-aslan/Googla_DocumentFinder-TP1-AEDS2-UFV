Well I got a bumper sticker  
On the back of my truck  
There aint another like it  
Cause I had it made up  
I can tell whos behind me  
They give themselves away  
Lay on their horn when they read this phrase  
  
Chorus  
Honk if you honky tonk  
Dont if you dont  
But if you do  
Dont you love to  
Honk if you honky tonk  
  
Me and Friday night go hand in hand  
Ice cold beer and a swingin band  
A girl on my arm that wont let go  
She caught my little sign about a mile ago  
  
Chorus  
  
Well just the other day I was cruisin through town  
Sheriff pulled me over I thought I had it now  
I rolled down my window he said with a grin  
I want one of them stickers or Im gonna run you in  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Honk if you honky tonk  
  
I hear ya honkin yeah  
Im pullin over  
Lets honky tonk
