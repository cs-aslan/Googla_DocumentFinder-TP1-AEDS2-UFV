Put the houses in a row  
On the streets we used to know  
And all the things out in the yard  
That can hang there to and fro  
  
And if the money isnt right  
Can I be yours tonight  
Ive an easy heart  
  
From the windows of your house  
Reflects back on yourself  
Then it gets you wondering  
If it means anything  
  
And if the money isnt right  
Can I be yours tonight  
Ive had a pretty hard life  
Ive had a pretty hard life  
For such an easy heart  
  
You move away when youre young  
They take away where youre from  
And all the things out in the trees  
Fall away in to the breeze  
  
And if the money isnt right  
Can I be yours tonight  
Ive had a pretty hard life  
Ive had a pretty hard life  
For such an easy heart
