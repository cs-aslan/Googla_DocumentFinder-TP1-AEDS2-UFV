I cant dance and I never could I guess my feet dont match  
Ive been thinking bout dancing with you but Im afraid of hurtin my back  
I dont know what youre doing but I like everything you do  
Just for a little bit baby Id come out and dance with you  
  
Chorus  
But I cant dance and Im feeling so good  
Some of us can and some of us cant and some of us wish that we could dance  
Some cant dance and I guess Im just one of the unfortunate few  
Just for a little bit baby Id come out and dance with you  
  
My mind is out there with you now but I cant get my body to move  
Sitting here falling in love love love thinking something I cant prove  
My soul is willing and my mind is ready but its something that I never could
do  
Just for a little bit baby Id come out and dance with you  
  
Chorus
