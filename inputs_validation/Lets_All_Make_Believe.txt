Is anyone here prepared to say  
Just what they mean or is it too late   
For anyone here to try to do  
Just what it takes to get through to you  
  
So lets all make believe  
That were still friends and we like each other  
Lets all make believe  
In the end were gonna need each other  
  
Stradle my hope and make me pray  
To a God Ive never seen but who Ive betrayed  
To the people who live the afterlife  
In a place Ill never be til Im crucified  
  
So lets all make believe  
Were still friends and we like each other  
Lets all make believe  
In the end well need each other  
  
Lets all make believe  
That all mankinds gonna feed our brother  
Lets all make believe  
That in the end well all grow up  
  
So lets all make believe  
That were still friends and we like each other  
Lets all make believe  
In the end well need each other  
  
Lets all make believe  
That all mankinds gonna feed our brother  
Lets all make believe  
That in the end well all grow up
