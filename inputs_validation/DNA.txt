Does he tell you he loves you when you least expect it  
Does he flutter your heart when he kisses your neck  
No scientist or biology  
Its obvious when hes holding me  
Its only natural that Im so affected  
  
And my heart wont beat again  
If I cant feel him in my veins  
No need to question I already know  
  
Its in his DNA DDDDNA  
Its in his DNA  
And he just takes my breath away  
Bbbbreath away  
I feel it every day  
And thats what makes a man  
Not hard to understand  
Perfect in every way  
I see it in his face  
Nothing more to say  
Its in his DDDDNA  
  
Its the blue in his eyes that helps me see the future  
Fingerprints that leave me covered for days yeah hey yeah  
Now I dont have any first degree  
But I know what he does to me  
No need to work it out its so familiar oh oh oh  
  
And my heart wont beat again  
If I cant feel him in my veins  
No need to question I already know  
  
Its in his DNA DDDDNA  
Its in his DNA  
And he just takes my breath away  
Bbbbreath away  
I feel it every day  
And thats what makes a man  
Not hard to understand  
Perfect in every way  
I see it in his face  
Nothing more to say  
Its in his DDDDNA  
  
Its all about his kiss  
Contaminates my lips  
Our energy connects  
Its simple genetics  
Im the X to his Y  
Its the color of his eyes  
He can do no wrong  
No he dont need to try  
Made from the best  
He passes all the tests  
Got my heart beating fast  
Its cardiac arrest  
Hes from a different strain  
That science cant explain  
I guess thats how hes made  
In his DDDDNA  
  
Its in his DNA DDDDNA  
Its in his DNA  
And he just takes my breath away  
Bbbbreath away  
I feel it every day  
And thats what makes a man what makes a man  
Not hard to understand to understand  
Perfect in every way in every way  
I see it in his face in his face  
Nothing more to say nothing more to say  
Its in his DDDDNA
