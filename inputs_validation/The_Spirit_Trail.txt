The light is long  
The sun is low  
Im riding fast across this dusty road  
But I dont want to be  
No I dont want to be  
Above the ridge an eagle flies  
In lazy circles in the western skies  
I want to fly with him  
I want to walk the spirit trail  
  
Ive seen them come  
Ive seen them go  
Off to the oilfields and rodeos  
To find a better way  
They leave their native soil  
But I can hear a different song  
The drum within my heart is beating strong  
I want to follow it  
Ive got to walk the spirit trail  
  
Let every creature I see  
Be a brother and a friend to me  
Let every step that I take  
Leave the footprints of a warrior  
Along the spirit trail  
  
Heyaheya heya hiyo  
Heyaheya heya hiyo  
Heyaheya heya hiyo  
  
The took the land  
They took control  
They robbed my father of his very soul  
To be like one of them  
To be like one of them  
But I was born a native son  
And I will never be another one  
To give it all away  
Ive got to walk the spirit trail  
  
Let every creature I see  
Be a brother and a friend to me  
Let every step that I take  
Leave the footprints of a warrior  
Along the spirit trail  
  
Heyaheya heya hiyo  
Heyaheya heya hiyo  
Heyaheya heya hiyo  
  
Let every creature I see  
Be a brother and a friend to me  
Let every step that I take  
Leave the footprints of a warrior  
Along the spirit trail
