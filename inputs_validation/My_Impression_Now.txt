You told me youd give your soul to the crowd  
You run to the edge of the warzone  
Youre finding out that its way too late  
To be happy around your friends  
You changed your head  
And made your bed  
Through time circumstances and medicines  
You lied a lot  
Created a plot  
To escort you safely away  
Chorus My impression now  
My impression now  
Stand on the edge of the ledge  
Jump off cause nobody cares  
You told me you found a way to escape  
Through silence and not a suggestion  
To apply it all to everyday life  
But it cant find the connection  
The magic lens  
You contacted friends  
Who just never seem to be with you  
Flying up on a paper cup  
They land to ssailing away  
Chorus  
Chorus
