You never seem seem to have the time to listen to what I say  
How can I know just what goes on in your mind if you always walk away  
So whats the good whats the good of trying  
And hanging around you begging for your love  
When it seems theres someone else in your dreams  
And I cant be sure of you anymore  
  
Are you growing tired of my love  
Have you had too much of my love  
Are you growing tired of my love  
Where is the love you once gave me  
  
And when we meet things are not the same now you always hurry away  
And all the friends that once you used to share with me are ignored now and
youre bored now  
I guess we are through but still I go on hoping  
Because you never put it into words  
Cant you see you should be honest with me  
And Ive got to find what is in your mind  
  
Are you growing tired of my love  
Have you had too much of my love  
Are you growing tired of my love  
Where is the love you once gave me  
  
Are you growing tired of my love  
Have you had too much of my love  
Are you growing tired of my love  
Where is the love you once gave me  
  
Are you growing tired of my love  
Have you had too much of my love  
Are you growing tired of my love  
Where is the love you once gave me
