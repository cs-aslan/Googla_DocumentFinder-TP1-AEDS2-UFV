Youve got to change your evil ways baby  
Before I stop lovin you  
Youve got to change baby  
And every word that I say is true  
You got me runnin and hidin all over town  
You got me sneakin and apeepin and runnin you down  
This cant go on Lord knows you got to change baby  
  
When I come home baby  
My house is dark and my pots are cold  
Youre hangin round baby  
With Jean and Joan anda who knows who  
Im gettin tried of waitin and foolin around  
Ill find somebody who wont make me feel like a clown  
This cant go on Lord knows you got to change  
  
When I come home baby  
My house is dark and my pots are cold  
Youre hangin round baby  
With Jean and Joan anda who knows who  
Im gettin tried of waitin and foolin around  
Ill find somebody who wont make me feel like a clown  
This cant go on yeah yeah yeah
