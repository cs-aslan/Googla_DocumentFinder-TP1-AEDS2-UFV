Been beat up and battered round  
Been sent up and Ive been shot down  
Youre the best thing that Ive ever found  
Handle me with care  
  
Reputations changeable  
Situations tolerable  
Baby youre adorable  
Handle me with care  
  
Im so tired of being lonely  
I still have some love to give  
Wont you show me that you really care  
  
Everybodys got somebody to lean on  
Put your body next to mine and dream on  
  
Ive been fobbed off and Ive been fooled  
Ive been robbed and ridiculed  
In day care centers and night schools  
Handle me with care  
  
Been stuck in airports terrorized  
Sent to meetings hypnotized  
Overexposed commercialized  
Hand me with care  
  
Im so tired of being lonely  
I still have some love to give  
Wont you show me that you really care  
  
Everybodys got somebody to lean on  
Put your body next to mine and dream on  
  
Ive been uptight and made a mess  
But Ill clean it up myself I guess  
Oh the sweet smell of success  
Handle me with care
