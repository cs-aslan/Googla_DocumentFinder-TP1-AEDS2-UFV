Gonna sit right here and sing myself a tune  
That I wrote one afternoon after everyone had gone  
And I know that this wont mean a lot to you  
Youve got better things to do but for me Ill just go on  
Old dog is lying in the middle of the road  
He dont do nothing cause he dont want to  
And I think Im gonna like that hound  
Cause the more he sits around the less I want to do too  
Gonna sit right here and watch the world roll by  
Till we both just up and die watching clouds and eating flies  
Dont want to bother no one dont want nothing here to change  
A dusty road is all weve ever dreamed of  
And I think Im gonna love this life  
Maybe someday take a wife  
She can join us if she wants to  
Aint nobody gonna tell what to do  
If a car comes we just move  
And we both move real smooth  
Like old dog is moving must be something in the air  
Some bitch is coming up the road now  
And I think Im gonna like that hound  
Cause the more he gets around the more I want to do too
