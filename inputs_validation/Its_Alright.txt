J J Cales my hero best I ever heard  
But you gotta sing a little louder hoss cause I cant hear the words  
Some folks call it rock and roll others call it blues  
But I detect a country soul when I seen his cowboy shoes  
And its alright  
Its alright  
It may not be right but its alright  
  
George might show up flyin high if George shows up at all  
But he may be unconsciously the greatest of them all  
From the Beatles and me in Nashville to the billies and the Rolling Stones  
If we all sounded like we wanted to wed all sound like George Jones  
And its alright  
Its alright  
It may not be right but its alright  
  
Jesse shes my woman boys poor little ugly thing  
She tells me just how smart I am so Ill teach her how to sing  
When Im wrong and then she nails me I get her with the same old line  
And its alright  
Its alright  
It may not be right but its alright
