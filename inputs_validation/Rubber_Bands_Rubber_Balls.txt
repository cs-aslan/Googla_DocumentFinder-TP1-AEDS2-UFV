Rubber bands rubber balls  
Made with superspecial density  
Rubber bands rubber balls  
They can bounce with such intensity  
  
This is the room where we test the stretching  
This is the room where we test the bounce  
Here we add the longchained hydrocarbons  
The names of which I cannot pronounce  
  
This is the room where we test compression  
This is the room where we test recoil  
This is a break room for all these dancers  
And heres a little fridge so the curry wont spoil

Basically what we make here is rubber  
Were not trying to diversify  
We dont make knickknacks we dont make tchotchkes  
Or really anything thats gonna catch your eye  
  
We dont make pianos we dont make cream sodas  
We dont make the zippers for your parachute pants  
We dont make ice cube trays or ceiling fans  
We make rubber bands last note held until end of song
