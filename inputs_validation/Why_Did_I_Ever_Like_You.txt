Barabarabaraadada  
There was a 5 8 earthquake today  
And it kinda got me thinking  
Id still have all  
My hate for you in tact  
Even if I lost everything  
  
What did I say  
Why are you shaking your head  
You know you done me wrong  
I may be crazy its all in my head  
But I want you darling gone  
  
Why did I ever like you  
What did I see  
Whatever it was must  
Have been some kind of illusion  
A Magic trick on me  
  
Eh eh eh eh  
  
Repeats for a bit  
  
Its hard to believe  
I ever laughed at anything you said  
Cos youre just not funny  
Who would believe  
Id let you do all those things  
Oh I guess the joke was on me  
  
I tried to be zane  
Ive even asked all my friends  
To help my let it slide  
But all I see is your face  
In my favourite place  
And I cant help but wonder why  
  
Why did I ever like you  
What did I see  
Whatever it was  
Must have been some kind of illusion  
A Magic trick on me  
  
Eh eh eh eh repeats for a bit  
  
Yeaaahhheee  
  
I tried to be zane  
Ive even asked all my friends  
To help my let it slide  
All I see is your face  
In my favourite place  
And I cant help but wonder why  
  
Why did I ever like you  
What did I see  
Whatever it was must  
Have been some kind of illusion  
A Magic trick on me  
  
Eh eh eh eh repeats for a bit  
  
Tell me why did I  
Why did I ever like you  
What did I see  
Whatever it was must  
Have been some kind of illusion  
A Magic trick on me
