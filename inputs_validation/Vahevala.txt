Im thinking about when I was a sailor  
Spent my time on the open seas  
When wed stay off the coast of Jamaica  
Id secretly steal ashore  
The natives were waiting for  
The boy with the lazy soul  
To sing with the sailor  
  
Chorus  
Vahevala homeless sailor  
Vahevala homeward sail away  
Vahevala homeless sailor  
Vahevala homeward sail away  
Every evening Id be gone  
Back on board by break of dawn  
  
Im thinking about the nights in Jamaica  
Pretty girls dancin here and there  
Stole a keg and now Im drunk as a sailor  
The captain he dont know  
Where Billy he done go  
But Im singing with native girls  
The songs of a sailor  
  
Chorus  
  
Every night in Jamaica Id sing with the lady  
And drink with the men till the morning appear  
Healthy sunshine is fresh on my face  
As the songs of the night puts the ring in my ear  
  
Chorus
