Oh youyoure so hard to get to  
Oh youyou dont want to play  
You were no better before  
I sent a letter before  
I sent a dream to you last night  
From the end of the world  
  
Oh youyou keep me hangin round and round  
And round  
Oh youlook at the trouble Ive found  
You were no better before  
I sent a letter before  
I sent a dream to you last night  
From the end of the world  
  
I saw you last night but you couldnt answer  
You were a lonely little sidewalk dancer  
When I woke up I could not stand it  
You were gone but I got to hand it to you  
  
Oh please if this is a game I wish someone would win  
Oh please just let it fly to be upon the wind  
You were no better beforeI sent a letter before  
I sent a dream to you baby last night  
From the end of the world
