A nervous boy in several ways  
I never knew the world could operate this way  
I was nervous when we stopped to speak  
And the world came crashing around my feet  
  
We dont talk of love  
Were much too shy  
But nervously we wonder when and why  
  
A nervous boy in spite of which  
I never thought I could tremble as much as this  
Your flashing eyes and sudden smiles  
Are never quite at ease and neither am I  
  
Oh well talk about it all some night  
But nervously we never get it  
Right  
From the start I approved of you  
Right from the moment you turned to face me  
  
A nervous boy from another town  
With a nervous laugh and a concentrated frown  
I spoke too fast with watchful eyes  
Of a recent past and some nostalgic surprise  
  
We dont talk of love  
Were much too shy  
But nervously we wonder when and  
Smile  
Knowing why I approved of you  
Right from the moment you turned to face me  
  
A nervous boy
