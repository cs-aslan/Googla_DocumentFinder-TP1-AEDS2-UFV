Perfect by nature  
Icons of self indulgence  
Just what we all need  
More lies about a world that  
  
Never was and never will be  
Have you no shame dont you see me  
You know youve got everybody fooled  
  
Look here she comes now  
Bow down and stare in wonder  
Oh how we love you  
No flaws when youre pretending  
But now I know she  
  
Never was and never will be  
You dont know how youve betrayed me  
And somehow youve got everybody fooled  
  
Without the mask where will you hide  
Cant find yourself lost in your lie  
  
I know the truth now  
I know who you are  
And I dont love you anymore  
  
Never was and never will be  
You dont know how youve betrayed me  
And somehow you have everybody fooled  
  
It never was and never will be  
Youre not real and you cant save me  
Somehow now youre everybodys fool
