Some days you waste your life away  
These times I find no words to say  
A crime I once committed filled me  
Too much of heavens eyes I saw through  
Only when meanings have no reason  
Theyre taken beyond your sense of right  
  
Small boy kneels wandering in a great hall  
He pays pennance to the air above him  
White circles black lines surround me  
Reborn so plain my eyes see  
This is the reason that I came here  
To be so near to such a person  
  
Im so tired Im so tired
