Monday morning you sure look fine  
Friday I got travelin on my mind  
First you love me then you fade away  
I cant go on believin this way  
I got nothing but love for you  
So tell me what you really want to do  
First you love me then you get on down the line  
But I dont mind I dont mind  
  
Ill be there if you want me to  
No one else that could ever do  
Got to get some peace in my mind  
Monday morning you look so fine  
Friday I got travelin on my mind  
First you love me then you say its wrong  
I cant go on believing for long  
  
But you know its true  
You only want me when I get over you  
First you love me then you get on down the line  
But I dont mind I dont mind  
Ill be there if you want me to  
No one else that could ever do  
Got to get some peace in my mind
