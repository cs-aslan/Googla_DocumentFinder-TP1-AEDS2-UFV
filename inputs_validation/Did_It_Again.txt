Clever girl  
Think you are but you think too much  
Shut down turn around  
Dont look that way any more  
  
Clever girl  
Think you know but you dont know much  
Try to make a move  
Go to a different door  
  
You know its all in your head  
You better put that business to bed  
By your fair hands of design you met with  
The monster in your mind  
  
You did it again  
You did it again  
Wont you listen to me when Im telling you its no good for you  
  
Clever girl  
Think youre right  
But whats right from wrong  
Little miss genius  
You make it hard on yourself  
  
Clever girl  
Youve got it all but youre all messed up  
Time now turn around  
Move onto something else  
  
You know its all in your head  
Youd better put that business to bed  
What you see nobody sees  
It only brings you to your knees  
  
Clever girl  
Think youre right  
But whats right from wrong  
Little miss genius  
You make it hard on yourself
