When we were out dancing the other night  
You almost got me into another fight  
You always want to prove youve got the touch baby  
To make all the other guys want you so much  
  
But if you ever do that to me  
Just one more time  
I swear to you that I will blow  
And baby thats  
  
Chorus  
The bottom line  
The bottom line  
  
If you really love me like you say  
Wouldnt keep on hurting me this way  
You always turn away when I call your name  
And baby things just stay the same  
  
So if you ever do that to me  
Just one more time  
I swear to you that I will blow  
And baby thats  
  
Chorus  
  
Here we go  
Youve got to believe its over  
Youve got to believe its true  
Youve got to believe its over  
And were through  
  
Youve got to believe its over  
Youve got to believe its true  
Youve got to believe its over  
And were through  
  
The bottom line  
The bottom line  
The bottom line  
  
All that you have ever done for me  
Is show just how rotten life can be  
But this has taught me one thing thats for sure yeah  
Ill never let that girl back through my door  
  
And if she ever does that to me  
Just one more time  
I swear to you that I will blow  
And baby thats  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Id like to thank you all for coming this evening  
All you people all you people out there  
Youre all beautiful  
I wanna take each and every one of you home with me tonight
