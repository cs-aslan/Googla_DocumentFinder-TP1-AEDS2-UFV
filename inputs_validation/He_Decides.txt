Cant you hear them whispering  
Around you all the time  
Cant you tell the difference between  
Things when youre in love  
I hear your voice is trembling  
Every time when hes around  
Your detached engagements  
In the things I say means love oh  
  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be happy  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be sad  
  
If he doesnt love you youre afraid that you  
Cant go on  
Living without loving never makes a person  
Strong no  
If he really loves you let him show you that  
Instead  
I will be here with you cause I know that  
Youre afraid of love  
  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be happy  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be sad  
  
Youll never change my mind my friend dont  
Let that feeling go  
This love might change your world around  
In time youll have to know oh yeah  
  
Whether you should go  
  
Oh yeah  
  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be happy  
He decides whether you should smile  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be sad  
  
Whether you should be happy  
Whether you should cry  
Whether you should be happy  
  
He decides  
Whether you  
  
I know that  
He decides
