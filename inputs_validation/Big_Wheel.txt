Chorus  
Big wheel dont you roll  
Big diesel dont you whine  
Through the night as Im runnin down the road  
Big semi dont you stop cause if you do Im not  
Gonna make it back to Baltimore with my load  
  
Well the truckstops warm and friendly  
And the coffee keeps me up  
And the waitress there would like to waste my time  
But Ill have to pass it by  
As its down the road I fly  
Just a racin with that pocket watch of mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Smoke apuffin tires a hummin  
Burnin up the road  
Countin road signs and the miles to Baltimore  
One eye out for weighin stations  
One for radar traps  
They cant stop me cause my plans dont call for that
