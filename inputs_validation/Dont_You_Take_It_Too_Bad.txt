Dont you take it too bad  
If youre feelin unlovin  
If youre feelin unfeelin  
If youre feelin alone  
Dont take it too bad  
  
Cause it aint you to blame babe  
Lord its just some kind of game made  
Out of all of this living  
That we got left to do  
  
And if you go searchin  
For rhyme or for reason  
Then you wont have the time  
That it take just for talkin  
About the places youve been babe  
About the places youve seen babe  
And how soft the time flies  
Past your window at night  
  
And we just cant have that girl  
Cause its a sad lonesome cold world  
And a man need a woman just to stand by his side  
And whisper sweet words in his ears about daydreams  
And roses and playthings  
And the sweetness of springtime  
And the sound of the rain
