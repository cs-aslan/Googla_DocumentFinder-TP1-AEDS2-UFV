All this pain in this world  
All the crying in this world  
Ill take it to Jah  
All the worries in the world  
And all the troubles in this world  
I will take to Jah  
  
All the suffering  
Right where we are  
Ill take to my father  
  
Cause he said  
Come to I with all thine sins  
And I will wash away  
All the impurities  
He said Im your father  
The creator of everything  
Thats what I say  
  
CHORUS  
All this pain Ill take to Jah 2x  
All these worries Ill take to Jah 2x  
  
Come to I with your problems  
No problem too big or small  
No one no one will be rejected  
Im your father the creator  
  
OHHOHOHO Lord I cry 2x  
  
Even when Satan comes  
With him demons  
Turn everything I believed in  
Upside down  
I will never forget  
With Jah on our side  
Who can be against us  
Oh no  
Most high omnipotent one  
Praise him most high  
  
CHORUS TO END  
All this pain Ill take to Jah  
All this crying Ill take to Jah
