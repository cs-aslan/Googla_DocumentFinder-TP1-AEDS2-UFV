I once held that someone special didnt have to let her go  
I just stood back and watched my future pass  
And for the awful shape Im in I can only blame myself  
Its no wonder that her love for me wasnt strong enough to last  
  
Poor it on for all its worth through all that we got lived  
And for what its worth weve been less than easy on ourself  
If we could write a book they couldnt keep it on the shelf  
Were just tryin to get it right with all that weve got left  
  
I was there when the bar room opened Ive been there at closin time  
There were things I couldnt handle by myself  
Then the right one picked me up and we left it all behind  
She said Im all shell ever need and for me theres no one else  
  
Poor it on for all its worth through all that we got lived  
And for what its worth weve been less than easy on ourself  
If we could write a book they couldnt keep it on the shelf  
Were just tryin to get it right with all that weve got left  
  
Were just tryin to get it right with all that weve got left
