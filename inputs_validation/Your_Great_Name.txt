Nothing can separate  
Even if I ran away  
Your love never fails  
  
I know I still make mistakes  
But You have new mercies for me everyday  
Your love never fails  
  
You stay the same through the ages  
Your love never changes  
There maybe pain in the night  
But joy comes in the morning  
  
And when the oceans rage  
I dont have to be afraid  
Because I know that You love me  
Your love never fails  
  
The wind is strong and the waters deep  
But Im not alone in these open seas  
Cause Your love never fails  
  
The chasm is far too wide  
I never thought Id reach the other side  
But Your love never fails  
You make all things work together for my good
