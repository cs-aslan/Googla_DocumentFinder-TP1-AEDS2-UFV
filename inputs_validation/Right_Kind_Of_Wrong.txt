Know all about  
About your reputation  
And how its bound to be a heartbreak situation  
But I cant help it if Im helpless  
Every time that Im where you are  
You walk in and my strength walks out the door  
Say my name and I cant fight it anymore  
Oh I know I should go  
  
But I need your touch just too damn much  
Loving you isnt really something I should do  
Shouldnt wanna spend my time with you  
That I should try to be strong  
But baby youre the right kind of wrong  
Yeah baby youre the right kind of wrong  
Might be a mistake  
A mistake Im making  
  
But what youre giving I am happy to be taking  
Cause no ones ever made me feel  
The way I feel when Im in your arms  
They say youre something I should do without  
They dont know what goes on  
When the lights go out  
Theres no way to explain  
  
All the pleasure is worth all the pain  
Loving you isnt really something I should do  
Shouldnt wanna spend my time with you  
That I should try to be strong  
But baby youre the right kind of wrong  
Yeah baby youre the right kind of wrong  
I should try to run  
But I just cant seem  
  
Cause everything I run youre the on I run to  
Cant do without what you do to me  
I dont care if Im in too deep
