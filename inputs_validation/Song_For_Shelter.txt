I get deep  
I get deep  
I get deep  
I get deeper ha  
Into this thing  
  
The deeper I go  
The more knowledge I know  
What to sing what to bring What  
  
I get deep  
I get deep  
I get deep  
I get deeper deeper deeper  
Into the vibe  
What ha  
  
Chilling in the corner  
At the shelter all by myself  
Checkin it out Im not dancing no more  
But why Why Why What  
  
How on Earth  
Are you supposed to vibe around the fake ones the one that say  
They know what is what  
But they dont know what is what  
They just strut  
What the fuck What  
  
I get deep  
I get deep  
I get deep  
I get deep  
I get deeper  
Into this thing  
And I pretend  
That theyre not there  
I just stare  
Up in the booth at the dread man spinning the song Spinning it strong  
Playing things like  
We care bout house we care  
  
Thats my shit what  
  
I get deep  
I get deep  
I get deep  
I get deeper  
When people start to disappear  
It is about six oclockwooo Im feelin hot  
Take off my sweater and my pants  
And i start to dance  
And all the sweat just goes down my bass  
  
And I pretend that  
Theres nobody there but me in this place  
  
I get deep yo I get deep What Woo  
  
I get deep  
I get deep  
I get deep  
I get deep when he takes all the bass out the song and all you hear is highs
and its like Oh shit I get deep  
  
I get deep  
I get deep  
I get deep  
I get deep when the rhythm flows through my blood like alcohol and i get
drunk and Im over the place  
But I catch myself right on time right on line with the beat and its so
sweet sweet sweet sweet I get deep I get deep I get deep  
  
Why if house music was air then Dr Love would be my song and I would only
take deep breaths  
And fill my lungs with the rhythm with the bass I get deep I get deep  
  
  
  
She said i wanna go out on a picknick with you baby Under the big bright
yellow sun  
  
You guys just keep it rollin
