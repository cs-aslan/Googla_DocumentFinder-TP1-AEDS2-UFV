Jr Writer Chorus  
To all my hustlers rock smugglers stugglers  
Block bubblers pushers cookers pot jugglers  
Whats the word yall Flip that herb raw  
Clap Thats the birdcall  
  
If the cops are comin get to hop n runnin  
Quick and drop that onion aint no stoppin youngin  
Put away that herb raw let us know the word whore  
Clap Thats the birdcall  
  
Jr Writer  
I still be where the weed flip and the peas with the trees lit  
So much water in the order its just leaving them sea sick  
But its me in my V6 trying to skeet on her bead lips  
They dont know like Im trying to keep her a secret  
Act wrong chrome passin me dome  
Next minute shit Im finished shell be flaggin it home  
But I always keep a straggler thats known to bone  
And run through a lap faster than marion jones  
Man listen I still got them grams flippin tan pitchen  
Corner to the damn kitchen  
Gained a couple fans having made the transition  
But Im still in the hood like a transmission  
No cat can match me Im passin fastly who half as nasty  
I got it locked from here all the way to cakalacky  
But keep a mac for scrapping thinkin its just laffy taffy  
Shit this beat dun be the only thing clappin at me  
  
Chorus  
  
Lil Wayne

If chickens on the radar Im at it  
cause I get it on my day off aint nuttin like getting weighed off  
Scrape off the plates

But yall cant see me Ray Charles

Because you peel off and I take off  
Give me no space whatever I want I takes  
Whatever I need I bleed and see  
Bitch nigga dont breathe on the weed

Without feeding them seeds thats creed you dont know about it

Brains blown back this is dame but dame dont rap  
Shame on black the games so whack

From in front of yo buildin straight to a hudred million  
Bad pimpin pimpin bad actin doggyy  
Getcha limp on pimpin if they actin froggy

Pow thats a badder story not in my category  
Mess around dame held def jam down  
Supporting my back jackin and they left their pounds

Chorus  
  
Jr Writer  
This aint only bars and tracks this is for the hardest cats  
Flippin all the harder back make them catch a heart attack  
When you see the narcs attack lemme know start to clap clap clap  
But start with he deals your pa be on chill  
The car is Deville is real Ill  
Heart in the grill its far in my mills  
Cruise the city with the semi or the celly  
On skinnies like Im starving my wheels  
  
Chorus
