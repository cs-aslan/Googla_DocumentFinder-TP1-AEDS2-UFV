Well they told me not to come around you anymore  
Said I should find something to do  
And it filled me with an anger that I cant ignore  
But Im sure it didnt come from you  
  
Everyone says Im touched inside  
That you dont even know Im alive  
  
Little Miss Heartbreak can you hear me  
Ive got your picture pasted on the wall  
Little Miss Heartbreak need you near me  
Without you Im nothing at all  
  
Is there something I can change in me to suit your taste  
Something clever I can say  
Left my number at your room again just in case  
You want a quiet place to stay  
  
Im not just another face in the crowd  
Im here to tell you clear and loud  
  
Little Miss Heartbreak can you hear me  
Ive got your picture pasted on the wall  
Little Miss Heartbreak need you near me  
Without you Im nothing at all  
  
I cant stop these chills you give me  
Every time you come through the door  
I wont just stand by and watch you  
Like a schoolboy anymore Yeah  
  
Ooh I wait by the mailbox stare at the phone  
How can you leave me here alone  
  
Little Miss Heartbreak can you hear me  
Ive got your picture pasted on my wall  
Miss Heartbreak need you near me  
Without you Im nothing Yeah  
  
Little Miss Heartbreak I know you see me  
How can you go on treating me this way  
Little Miss Heartbreak believe me  
Im gonna make you mine someday
