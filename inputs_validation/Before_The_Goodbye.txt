Laying here in your arms  
And you hold me tight tight  
Tryin not to watch the clock  
Tick tickin as the time goes by by  
And I know that you best be on your way  
But Im wishin I could make you stay  
Stay with me for a while  
  
Though  
Youre near  
Still  
I want to make it clear  
Love  
I will always be around  
  
Chorus 1  
Youre leaving  
Im waiting  
Forgive me  
Im always missing you  
Before the goodbye  
  
Chorus 2  
I Feel It  
Already  
Forgive me  
Im always missing you  
Before the goodbye  
  
Kinda hard for me to let you know  
I dont let my feelings show  
How much I will miss in you  
All the little things that make me weak  
Your eyes and the way you speak  
Without you baby Im not me Im not me  
  
Though  
Youre near  
Still  
I want to make it clear  
Love  
I will always be around
