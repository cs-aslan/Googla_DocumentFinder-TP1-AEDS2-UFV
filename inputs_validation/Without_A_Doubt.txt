Im going downstairs to be a poet  
Got a great idea gonna write a sonnet  
A verse or two of fearless prose  
A priceless quip to gild the rose  
Ill make my fortune overnight  
My work will set the world alight  
Just a line is all I need  
Just a thought to sow the seed  
Just a word to start me out  
The rest will come without a doubt  
Im going downstairs to write a book  
Got a great ideas gonna really cook  
A rattling good yarn with an ironic twist  
A riveting ending thats not to be missed  
Makesure the presses are ready to steam  
This book is a scorcher a publishers dream  
Just the first parts all I need  
The rest will come with lightning speed  
Just a line to set the stage  
My pen will dance across the page  
Im going downstairs to write a play  
Got a great idea gonna make it pay  
This serious drama wont be understood  
The critics will love it and say that its good  
at last a new writer a true nouvelle vague  
In no time at all Ill be king of the stage  
Just a storys all I need  
Just a thought to sow the seed  
Just a line to start me out   
The rest will come without a doubt
