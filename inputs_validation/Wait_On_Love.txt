Now shes gone from my life  
And it nearly drove me out of my mind  
Always thinking what she meant to me  
All we left behind  
Cant be afraid startin over  
When youre drownin in your loneliness  
The hurtin never ends  
And the night rolls on  
I search for some peace of mind  
No I cant be wrong  
Wont get burned by desire this time  
  
Gonna wait on love  
Holdin out till I find the one  
Wait on love wont hold back  
I promised myself till it comes  
Gonna wait on love  
  
Wanna get close with somebody  
When a voice says Im movin too fast  
Its hard to know when to walk away  
Or try to make it last  
Still the night rolls on  
Secrets are safe in the dark  
And I stayed too long  
Im not gonna lie to my heart  
  
Gonna wait on love  
Holdin out till I find the one  
Wait on love wont hold back  
I promised myself till it comes  
Gonna wait on love  
  
Someone I can run to  
Just know that its right  
Trust my heart and soul to  
For the rest of my life  
  
Gonna wait on love  
Holdin out till I find the one  
Wait on love wont hold back  
I promised myself till it comes  
Gonna wait on love
