I hope that I wont be that wrong anymore  
And maybe Ive learned this time  
I hope that I find what Im reaching for  
The way that it is in my mind  
  
Someday Ill get over you  
Ill live to see it all through  
But Ill always miss  
Dreaming my dreams with you  
  
But I wont let it change me  
Not if I can  
Id rather believe in love  
And give it away as much as I can  
To those that Im fondest of  
  
Someday Ill get over you  
Ill live to see it all through  
But Ill always miss  
Dreaming my dreams with you  
  
Someday Ill get over you  
Ill live to see it all through  
But Ill always miss  
Dreaming my dreams with you
