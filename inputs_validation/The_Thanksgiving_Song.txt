Adam Sandler That clappins messing my head up man I appreciate it But I
was trying to think of the next line and all I hear  
is clapping Here we go Thanks anyways  
  
Turkey for me  
Turkey for you  
Lets eat the turkey  
In my big brown shoe  
Love to eat the turkey  
At the table  
I once saw a movie  
With Betty Grable  
Eat that turkey  
All night long  
Fifty million Elvis fans  
Cant be wrong  
Turkey lurkey doo and  
Turkey lurkey dap  
I eat that turkey  
Then I take a nap  
  
Thanksgiving is a special night  
Jimmy Walker used to say Dynomite  
Thats right  
Turkey with gravy and cranberry  
Cant believe the Mets traded Darryl Strawberry  
Turkey for you and  
Turkey for me  
Cant believe Tyson  
Gave that girl VD  
  
White meat dark meat  
You just cant lose  
I fell off my moped  
And I got a bruise  
Turkey in the oven  
And the buns in the toaster  
Ill never take down  
My Cheryl Tiegs poster  
Wrap the turkey up  
In aluminum foil  
My brother likes to masturbate  
With baby oil  
Turkey and sweet potato pie  
Sammy Davis Jr  
Only had one eye  
  
Turkey for the girls and  
Turkey for the boys  
My favorite kind of pants  
Are corduroys  
Gobble gobble goo and  
Gobble gobble gickel  
I wish turkey  
Only cost a nickel  
Oh I love turkey on Thanksgiving  
  
Happy Thanksgiving everybody
