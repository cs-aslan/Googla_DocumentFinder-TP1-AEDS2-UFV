If theres a tear on my face  
It makes me shiver to the bone  
It shakes me babe  
Its just a heartache that got caught in my eye  
And you know I never cry I never cry  
  
Sometimes I drink more than I need  
Until the TVs dead and gone  
I may be lonely  
But Im never alone  
And the night may pass me by  
But I never cry  
  
Take away take away my eyes  
Sometimes Id rather be blind  
Break a heart break a heart of stone  
Open it up but dont you leave it alone  
  
Cause thats all I got to give you  
Believe me babe it aint been used  
My hearts a virgin it aint never been tried  
And you know I never cry  
Yeah you know I never cry  
Well you know you know you know you know I never cry  
I never cry  
  
Break a heart go ahead break a heart of stone  
Open it up but dont you leave it alone  
Cause thats all I got to give you  
Believe me babe it aint been used  
My hearts a virgin it aint never been tried  
And you know I never cry  
I never cry
