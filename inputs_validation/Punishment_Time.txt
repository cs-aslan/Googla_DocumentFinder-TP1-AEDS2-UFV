Im walking on a razor blade  
Careful not to cross the line  
Every little step I take its punishment time now  
Im getting to the end of the blade  
Slipping to the other side  
Every little step I take its punishment time  
  
Fighting to survive theres no tomorrow  
Fighting to survive theres no today  
Final flight Im losing my mind  
Heavy on the heart theres no tomorrow  
Heavy on the heart theres no today  
Final flight Im losing my mind  
  
Im hanging like a bat today  
Crucified by the sign  
Every little move I make its punishment time now  
Im sleeping on a bed of nails  
Theyre breaking through one at a time  
Cause every little move I make  
The punishments mine  
  
Fighting to survive theres no tomorrow  
Fighting to survive theres no today  
Final flight Im losing my mind  
Heavy on the heart theres no tomorrow  
Heavy on the heart theres no today  
Final flight Im losing my mind  
  
I give and dont get  
I try to my death  
Theres something inside of me  
That makes me forget  
I give and dont get  
Ill try to my death  
Theres something inside of me  
That makes me forget  
I give and dont get  
Ill try to my death  
Theres something inside of me  
That makes me forget  
I give and dont get  
Ill try to my death  
Theres something inside of me  
That makes me forget  
  
Fighting to survive theres no tomorrow  
Fighting to survive theres no today  
Final flight Im losing my mind  
Heavy on the heart theres no tomorrow  
Heavy on the heart theres no today  
Final flight Im losing my mind  
  
Losing my mind losing my mind losing my mind  
Losing my mind  
  
Losing my mind losing my mind losing my mind
