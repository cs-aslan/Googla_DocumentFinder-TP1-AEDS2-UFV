You can force it but it will not come  
You can taste it but it will not form  
You can crush it but its always here  
You can crush it but its always near  
Chasing you home  
  
Saying everything is broken  
Everyone is broken  
  
You can force it but it will stay stung  
You can crush it as dry as a bone  
You can walk it home straight from school  
You can kiss you can break all the rules  
  
But still everything is broken  
Everyone is broken  
Everyone is everyone is broken  
Everyone is everything is broken  
  
Why cant you forget  
Why cant you forget  
Why cant you forget
