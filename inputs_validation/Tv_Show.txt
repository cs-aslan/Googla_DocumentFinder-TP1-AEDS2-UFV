Too much anger trapped inside  
Its so hard to let it go  
Hope is fading  
Im tired of waiting  
And Im moving much too slow  
  
The stars above Im cursing  
And it still seems Im rehearsing  
But the cameras have been  
Rolling all the while  
This storys getting boring  
And the spectators are snoring  
I suggest you turn the dial  
  
Life is a TV show  
Shouldve been canceled long ago  
Life is a TV show  
Shouldve been canceled long ago  
Life is a TV show  
Life is a TV show  
Life is a TV show  
Shouldve been canceled long ago  
  
I saw a headline in the paper  
Of another ticker taper  
For a war which has barely just begun  
Well be waving our flag silly  
As were chopped into piccalilli  
And thats not my idea of fun  
  
Life is a TV show  
Shouldve been canceled long ago  
Life is a TV show  
Shouldve been canceled long ago  
Life is a TV show  
Life is a TV show  
Life is a TV show  
Shouldve been canceled long ago
