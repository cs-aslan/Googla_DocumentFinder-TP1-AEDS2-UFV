Not sure if you know this  
But when we first met  
I got so nervous I couldnt speak  
In that very moment  
I found the one and  
My life had found its missing piece  
  
So as long as I live I love you  
Will have and hold you  
You look so beautiful in white  
And from now til my very last breath  
This day Ill cherish  
You look so beautiful in white  
Tonight  
  
What we have is timeless  
My love is endless  
And with this ring I  
Say to the world  
Youre my every reason  
Youre all that I believe in  
With all my heart I mean every word  
  
So as long as I live I love you  
Will haven and hold you  
You look so beautiful in white  
And from now til my very last breath  
This day Ill cherish  
You look so beautiful in white  
Tonight  
  
Oooh oh  
You look so beautiful in white  
  
So beautiful in white  
Tonight  
  
And if a daughter is what our future holds  
I hope she has your eyes  
Finds love like you and I did  
Yeah and when she falls in love well let her go  
Ill walk her down the aisle  
Shell look so beautiful in white  
  
You look so beautiful in white  
  
So as long as I live I love you  
Will haven and hold you  
You look so beautiful in white  
And from now til my very last breath  
This day Ill cherish  
You look so beautiful in white  
Tonight  
  
You look so beautiful in white  
Tonight
