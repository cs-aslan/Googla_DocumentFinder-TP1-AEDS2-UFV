its rolling  
oh wrong song  
its rolling  
  
Invaders of the heart  
Are messin with my mind  
Invaders of the heart  
Can make your heart blind  
Invaders of the heart  
Are drivin me insane  
Invaders of the heart  
Are playin with my brain  
  
I cant see anymore  
Now Ive gotten tunnel vision  
I cant be anyone  
I just got no direction  
I cant see anything  
But I dont need glasses on  
I cant think anymore  
Im just a nervous wreck  
  
Invaders of the heart  
Are messin with my mind  
Invaders of the heart  
Can make your heart blind  
Invaders of the heart  
Are drivin me insane  
Invaders of the heart  
Are playin with my brain  
  
I cant see anymore  
Always buckle under pressure  
I cant be anyone  
The slightest thing will set me off  
I cant feel anything  
Im on pins and Im on needles  
I cant think anymore  
Ive lost my appetite  
  
Invaders of the heart  
Are messin with my mind  
Invaders of the heart  
Can make your heart blind  
Invaders of the heart  
Are drivin me insane  
Invaders of the heart  
Are playin with my brain  
  
take it rick 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  
21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32  
  
Invaders of the heart  
Are messin with my mind  
Invaders of the heart  
Can make your heart blind  
Invaders of the heart  
Are playin with my brain  
Invaders of the heart  
Are drivin me insane  
Are messin with my mind  
Make your heart blind  
Invaders of the heart  
  
one more time  
okay choice of lousy endings now
