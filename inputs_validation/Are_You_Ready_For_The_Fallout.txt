I was wondering how youre feeling  
I thought I saw you kneeling  
And holding your gut last night  
It looked like you were praying  
But I heard someone saying  
You had been in an awful fight  
You get the worst of it everytime  
Lashing out with no reason or rhyme  
To lose all this rage at so tender an age  
Little baby growing up in a rat cage  
  
Are you ready for the fallout  
Who you gonna call out  
When does it finally come to blows  
I think that youre forgetting  
The blood that youll be letting  
Has a price on it no one knows it  
You may be suffering in your sleep  
You may be getting in too deep  
And you may not care for advice that I share  
If you want it then Ill be there  
  
Soon you will learn how to swallow a tear  
So when youre old you can cry in your beer  
Do you spit at the face staring back in the mirror  
Do you have any self respect  
  
Soon you will learn how to swallow a tear  
So when youre old you can cry in your beer  
Do you spit at the face staring back in the mirror  
Do you have any self respect  
  
Well what the hell did you expect  
  
Are you ready for the fallout  
Who you gonna call out  
When does it finally come to blows  
I think that youre forgetting  
The blood that youll be letting  
Has a price on it no one knows it  
You may be suffering in your sleep  
You may be getting in too deep  
And you may not care for advice that I share  
If you want it then Ill be there  
  
Are you ready for the fallout  
Who you gonna call out
