Light up my lantern Ill cut you a path  
Weve walked for hours and its getting dark  
We left the roadside in search of aid  
Windscreen shattered and tire marks made  
  
Ive never seen someone bleeding like this  
Rip off your sleeve and clench your wrist  
  
Ill light the stove and sit by the hearth  
Orangey glow light the wintry dark  
We kept her bedroom exactly the same  
Winters they followed and Summers they came  
  
Hed bash around banging down on the floor  
I sit alone with an eye on the door  
  
Stop in this clearing well stay here tonight  
Press up against me Ill hold you so tight  
I got these matches well let off some smoke  
Maybe theyll see us and maybe they wont  
Blanket of leaves hide the light from the stars  
Ill lie awake listening out for cars  
  
He stares through curtains when he talks to the night  
I sit and listen for tires on the drive  
I keep on waiting and he keeps on talking  
Just stop him talking please stop him talking  
  
No give me silence  
Give me silence  
Give me silence  
Oh no
