In the blue light  
Of the Beverly Motel  
Wondering as the television burns  
How the heart approaches what it yearns  
  
In a fever  
I distinctly hear your voice  
Emerging from a dream the dream returns  
How the heart approaches what it yearns  
  
After the rain on the Interstate  
Headlights slide past the moon  
A boneweary traveler that  
Waits by the side of the road  
Wheres he going  
  
In a dream we are lying on the top of a hill  
And headlights slide past the moon  
I roll in your arms  
And your voice is the heat of the night  
Im on fire  
  
In a phone booth  
In some local bar and grill  
Rehearsing what Ill say my coin returns  
How the heart approaches what it yearns  
How the heart approaches what it yearns
