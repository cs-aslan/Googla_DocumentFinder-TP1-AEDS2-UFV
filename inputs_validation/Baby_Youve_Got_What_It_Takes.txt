Well now it takes more than a robin  
To make the winter go  
  
And it takes two lips for fire  
To melt away the snow  
Well it takes two hearts a cookin  
To make a fire grow  
And baby youve got what it takes  
Now listen honey  
  
Alright baby  
  
You know it takes  
A lot of kissin  
To make a romance sweep  
Oh it takes a lot of lovin  
To make my life complete  
  
Oh well it takes somebody special  
To knock me off my feet  
And baby youve got what it takes  
Hmm  
  
I said  
Oh  
Uh huh  
Oh  
Oh youve got just what it takes  
Because it takes more  
Than an effort to stay away from you  
And it takes more than a lifetime  
To prove that Ill be true  
Yeah  
But it takes somebody special  
To make me say I do  
And baby youve got what it takes  
  
Ah ha  
Oh

Oh youve got just what it takes  
Oh because it takes a lot of effort  
To stay away from you  
And it takes more than a lifetime  
To prove that Ill be true  
Well it takes somebody special  
To make me say I do  
And baby youve got what it takes

And baby youve got what it takes
