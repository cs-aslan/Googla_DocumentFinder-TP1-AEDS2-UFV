Lately I cant breathe  
Waiting theyre chasing me  
No one listens but Im OK with it dont touch me  
  
Only I wonder why  
If only my hands werent tied  
The worlds a blister  
But Im OK with it dont trust me  
  
What if I was there  
What if I was scared  
Im waiting for  
Theyre at my door  
But Ill be back again  
  
Lonely Im wandering  
Patrolling for enemies  
No one listens but Im OK with it
