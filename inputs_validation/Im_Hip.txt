Oh man do you believe that chick She has got no idea whats happening no
idea  
I am the one whos plugged in around here  
Thats why they call me The High Priestess of Cool Ha ha  
  
See Im hip Im no square  
Im alert Im awake Im aware  
I am always on the scene  
Makin the rounds diggin the sounds  
I read People Magazine  
Cause Im hip  
  
Like dig Im in step  
When it was hip to be hep I was hep  
I dont blow but Im a fan  
Look at me swing Ring a ding ding  
I even call my girlfriend man  
Cause Im hip  
  
Every Saturday night  
With my suit buttoned tight and my suedes on  
Im gettin my kicks  
diggin arty French flicks with my shades on  
  
Im too much Im a gas  
I am anything but middle class  
When I hang around the band  
poppin my thumbs diggin the drums  
sqaures dont seem to understand  
why I flip Theyre not hip like Im hip  
Im hip  
  
Im on top of every trend  
Look at me go Vodeeodo  
Sammy Davis knew my friend  
  
Im hip but not weird  
Like you notice I dont wear a beard  
Beards were in but now theyre not  
They had theyre day Now theyre passe  
Just ask me if youre in doubt  
Cause Im hip  
  
Now Im deep into Zen  
meditation and macrobiotics  
and as soon as I can  
I intend to get into narcotics  
  
Cause Im cool as a cuke  
Im a cat Im a card Im a kook kook kook  
I get so much out of life  
Really I do Skoo ba dee boo  
One more time play Mack the Knife  
Let er rip I may flip but Im hip
