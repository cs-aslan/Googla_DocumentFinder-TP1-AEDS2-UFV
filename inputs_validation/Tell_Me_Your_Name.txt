Tell me your name youre lovely  
Please tell me your name  
Just when I thought  
This would be one of those boring games  
You walked into these feelings  
You looked at me and smiled  
My heart unfroze and started going wild  
  
Can you imagine this  
The confusion of  
First loves kiss  
A return to wondering  
If the magic of love was this  
You merely said hello  
And my mind did a stop and go  
Can it possibly be  
The future for me is you  
  
Tell me your name  
I must know  
Wont you tell me your name  
Im not insane  
Just frightened that you might go  
Dont go please stay beside me  
Wait until I can tell you all my schemes  
Chasing rainbows spinning dreams  
Finding someone to love like you  
  
Im not insane  
Just frightened that you might go  
Dont go please stay beside me  
Just wait until I can tell you all my schemes  
Chasing rainbows spinning dreams  
Tell me please your name  
Tell me
