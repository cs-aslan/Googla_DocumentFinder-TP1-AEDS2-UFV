Cant you see she dont want you around no more  
Cant you see that her hands pointing at the door  
Feet dont fail me now  
How could anyone stay  
Anyone could see its time to go away  
Time to take a powder  
Open up your eyes  
But it feels like my legs have been paralyzed  
  
Feet dont fail me now  
Begging please dont make a fool of me  
Feet dont fail me now  
Please dont keep me where i should not be  
Feet dont fail me now  
Stop pretending that youve gone to sleep  
Feet dont fail me now  
Begging please dont make a fool of me  
  
See your things piled in the hall  
Turn around theres a new picture on the wall  
Feet dont fail me now  
Were the last ones to know  
Anyone could see its time for us to go  
Time to hit the highway  
Nothing left to do  
But it feels like my shoes have been crazy glued
