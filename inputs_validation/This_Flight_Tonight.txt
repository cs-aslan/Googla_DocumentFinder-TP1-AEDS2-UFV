Look out the left the captain said  
The lights down there thats where well land  
Saw a falling star burning  
High above the Las Vegas sand  
  
It wasnt the one that you gave to me  
That night down south between the trailers  
Not the early one that you wish upon  
Not the northern one that guides in the sailors  
  
Youve got that touch so gentle and sweet  
But youve got that look so critical  
Cant talk to you babe you know I get so weak  
Sometimes I think that love is just mythical  
  
Up theres a heaven down theres a town  
Blackness everywhere any little lights shine  
Blackness blackness draggin me down  
Come on light a candle in this heart of mine  
  
Star bright star bright youve got the lovin that I like  
Turn this crazy bird around  
Should not have got on this flight tonight  
  
Im drinkin sweet champagne got the headphones up high  
Cant numb you cant drum you out of my mind  
  
Theyre singin Goodbye baby  
Baby byebye  
Ooh love is blind  
  
Up go the flapsdown go the wheels  
Hope you got your heat turned on baby  
Hope theyve finally fixed your automobile  
Hope its better when we meet again babe
