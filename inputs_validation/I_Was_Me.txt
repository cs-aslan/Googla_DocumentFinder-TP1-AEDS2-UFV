Verse 1  
Its just another day  
Its just another year  
One step at a time they say  
One trip and youre back that way  
I dont recognize these eyes  
I dont recognize these hands  
Please believe me when I tell you  
That this is not who I am  
  
Chorus  
If I recover will you take me back again  
Im just another trying hard to fit right in  
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be  
If only I could go back when I was me  
  
Verse 2  
Ill try hard to make this ride  
Ill try hard to win this fight  
One step at a time they say  
One trip and youre back that way  
I dont recognize these eyes  
I dont recognize these hands  
Please believe me when I tell you  
That this is not who I am  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Give me strength to fight  
Help me feel alive again  
Make me whole inside  
Instead this hole inside is killing me  
Oh Im begging you  
  
Chorus
