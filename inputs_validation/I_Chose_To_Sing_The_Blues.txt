I could have been a gambler  
Cause Im good with the cards  
I could have been a lover  
Breakin others hearts  
And I feel so silly  
Bettin on the dice  
And a lover seldom sees  
The same girl twice  
And that is why that is why  
Thats why I chose thats why I chose  
I chose to sing the blues yes I did  
Now I could have been a doctor  
Helping the sick  
And I could have been a lawyer  
But you know that aint my stick  
Cause I feel so bad  
If a patient didnt do well  
And I feel just as bad  
To leave a client in jail  
And that is why that is why  
Thats why I chose thats why I chose  
I chose to sing the blues  
  
Sax solo  
  
Now a man has a lot  
That he could present  
Just to think I could have been  
President  
But I cant understand  
What politicians say  
So I want to talk to you  
In my own little way  
And that is why that is why  
Thats why I chose thats why I chose  
I chose to sing the blues  
Yes I did friends  
Dont you know what I mean  
I like what Im doin  
You know I like the blues  
Everybody understands  
What I mean when I say  
Something like this here  
Unnnnnnnhoo  
Yeah  
Yeahhoo  
Thats what Im talkin bout when I sing
