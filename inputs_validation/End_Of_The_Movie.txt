People you love  
Will turn their backs on you  
Youll lose your hair  
your teeth  
your knife will fall out of its sheath  
But you still dont like to leave before the end of the movie  
  
People you hate  
Will get their hooks into you  
Theyll pull you down  
youll frown  
theyll tar you and drag you through town  
But you still dont like to leave before the end of the movie  
No you still dont like to leave before the end of the show
