They called you a failure  
They called you a lost cause  
They said you would never become anything at all  
A generation  
With no direction  
But when I look in your eyes I see the prize yet to be claimed  
Ill say it once Ill say it twice that your life was worth the price paid
for you paid for me and I believe in you and I know youll find the truth  
I know youve been broken  
cause Ive seen the abuse  
I know theres a place inside your heart begging for truth  
For a softspoken answer  
That wont break your spirit  
But when I look in your eyes I see the prize thats yet to be claimed  
Ill say it once Ill say it twice that your life was worth the price paid
for you paid for me and I believe in you and I know youll find the truth  
but thats not what they told you when they said that they gave up on you and
youre nothing and youll never be anything  
Ill wait for the day when youll stand up and say I can do all things through
him who strengthens me  
Ill say it once Ill say it twice that your life was worth the price paid
for you paid for me and I believe in you yes I believe in you and I know
youll find the truth
