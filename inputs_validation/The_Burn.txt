Bad is better than the burn  
Some people never learn  
Bad is better than the burn  
  
Ill take the blame its my mistake  
One heart goes free one heart just aches  
Its an easy kill within my range  
I made the break honey you kept the pain  
  
And yesterday means nothin to me now Doesnt matter  
Ill keep it hid youll live somehow  
  
Bad is better than the burn  
Truth is better than a lie  
Some people never learn  
Bad is better than the burn  
  
I fished loves kiss from the wishing well  
Wound up in heaven stayed around for hell  
Its a common crime to live this lie  
I see no point after love has died  
  
Ill be the one who said goodbye Oh yeah  
And Ill take the heat for the tears you cry  
  
Bad is better than the burn  
Truth is better than a lie  
Some people never learn  
Bad is better than the burn  
  
Bad is better than the burn  
Or the hurt thats hidden in the heart  
They say you pay with what you earn  
Bad is better than the burn  
  
Cold is the shoulder that turns away  
Curses the man on judgment day  
Damned by the brand done too soon  
Crawled out of this house and howled at the moon  
  
And yesterday means nothing to me now  
Ill keep it hid youll live somehow  
  
Bad is better than the burn  
Some people never learn  
Bad is better than the burn  
  
Bad is better than the burn  
Truth is better than a lie  
Some people never learn  
Bad is better than the burn  
  
Bad is better than the burn
