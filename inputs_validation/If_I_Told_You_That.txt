Now tell me how youd feel  
If I told you that I  
Have feelings for you  
And would it be so wrong to say  
Whats on my mind  
Im sorry I have to  
We were friends but with time  
What I feel inside for you has changed  
But Id give up on love  
If I thought that it was untrue for you  
  
If I told you that  
I wanted to see you  
And if I told you that  
Id beg to please you  
If I told you that  
Ill always keep you  
What would you say  
If I told you that  
  
I know that were just friends  
But what if I decide to bring something in  
I hope it wont offend the trust  
We have cause I dont want this to end  
If you think that well lose what we have  
Then Id just rather stay rather stay the same  
Id rather stay the same  
Cause I dont want to choose  
Between two of the most precious things to me  
Tell me  
  
If I told you that  
I wanted to see you  
And if I told you that  
Id beg to please you  
If I told you that  
Ill always keep you  
What would you say  
If I told you that  
  
If we take this chance  
And extend to each other romance  
I hope it would be  
The right thing for you and me  
  
If I told you that  
I wanted to see you  
And if I told you that  
Id beg to please you  
If I told you that  
Ill always keep you  
What would you say  
If I told you that  
  
Would you be there for me  
Could you dare to hold me  
Will my feelings leave me  
Lonely if I told you  
  
If I told you that  
I wanted to see you  
And if I told you that  
Id beg to please you  
If I told you that  
Ill always keep you  
What would you say  
If I told you that
