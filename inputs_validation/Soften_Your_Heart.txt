So many times Ive tried to tell you  
But I dont think youve been listening  
Theres nothing I wanna try and sell you  
Cause His love is free  
  
Youre so proud of saying youre a seeker  
But why are you searching in the dark  
You wont find a thing  
Until you soften your heart  
  
Lalalala lalalala lalalalala  
  
The message is oh so very simple  
You gotta be like a child to see  
Cause Jesus said Let the little children  
Come unto Me  
  
You try to make things to complicated  
But you really dont have to be so smart  
You dont learn a thing  
Until you soften your heart  
  
Lalalala  
Lalalala  
  
Well if this just this once  
I could show you your empty life  
I know you would follow Him right now  
  
Well I know it sounds  
Just too good to be true  
But if He Lives in you  
  
Chorus  
Youll never die  
Youll never die  
Youll live forever  
Youll never die  
Youll never die  
Take care of forever now  
  
You tell everyone to keep on smiling  
Your outlook on life is so positive  
But deep down inside  
Youre searching for a reason to live  
  
Like everyone else youre scared of dying  
But the power of death has been blown apart  
And youll live forever  
If you soften your heart  
  
Chorus
