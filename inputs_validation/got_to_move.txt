You have always got to move  
Youre always trying to prove that  
There is something new in  
Everything you do  
  
You are mostly in your car  
You always seem so far  
No matter where you are  
Youre thinking of your car  
  
And everything you say  
Is really just a play  
For you to get your way  
And I found out yesterday  
That no matter what you say  
And no matter what you do  
That you have got to  
  
You have always got to move  
Youre racing just to prove that  
There is something new  
In everything you do  
  
You are mostly on the phone  
You say youre coming home  
You say youre all alone  
But I know youre not alone  
  
And everything you say  
Is really just a play  
For you to get your way  
And I found out yesterday  
That no matter what you say  
And no matter what you do  
That you have got to move  
  
You have always got to move  
Youre racing just to prove that  
There is something new in  
Everything you do  
Everything you do  
Everything you do
