Oh show me the way to the next whiskey bar  
Oh dont ask why oh dont ask why  
For we must find the next whiskey bar  
For if we dont find the whiskey bar  
I tell you we must die  
I tell you we must die  
I tell you  
I tell you  
I tell you we must die  
  
Oh moon of Alabama  
We now must say goodbye  
Weve lost our good old momma  
And must have whiskey oh you know why  
  
Oh moon of Alabama  
We now must say goodbye  
Weve lost our good old momma  
And must have whiskey oh you know why  
  
Oh show me the way to the next pretty boy  
Oh dont ask why oh dont ask why  
  
For we must find the next pretty boy  
For if we dont find the next pretty boy  
I tell you we must die  
I tell you we must die  
I tell you  
I tell you  
I tell you we must die  
  
Oh moon of Alabama  
We now must say goodbye  
Weve lost our good old momma  
And must have boys oh you know why  
  
Oh moon of Alabama  
We now must say goodbye  
Weve lost our good old momma  
And must have boys oh you know why  
  
Oh show me the way to the next little dollar  
Oh dont ask why oh dont ask why  
For we must find the next little dollar  
For if we dont find the next little dollar  
I tell you we must die  
I tell you we must die  
I tell you  
I tell you  
I tell you we must die  
  
Oh moon of Alabama  
We now must say goodbye  
Weve lost our good old momma  
And must have dollars oh you know why  
  
Oh moon of Alabama  
We now must say goodbye  
Weve lost our good old momma  
And must have dollars oh you know why
