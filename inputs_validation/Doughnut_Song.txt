Had me a trick and a kick and your message  
Well youll never gain weight from a doughnut hole  
Then thought that I could decipher your message  
Theres no one here dear  
No one at all  
  
And if Im wasting all your time  
This time  
Maybe you never learned to take  
And if Im hanging on to your shade  
I guess Im way beyond the pale  
  
And southern men can grow gold  
Can grow pertty  
Blood can be pertty  
Like a delicate man  
Copper to steel to a hinge that is faltered  
That lets you in lets you in lets you in  
Somethings just keeping you numb  
  
You told me last night  
You were a sun now with your very own  
  
Devoted satellite  
Happy for you  
And I am sure that I hate you  
Too sons too many too many able fires  
  
And if Im wasting all your time  
This time  
I think you never learned to take  
And if Im hanging on to your shade  
I guess Im way beyond the pale
