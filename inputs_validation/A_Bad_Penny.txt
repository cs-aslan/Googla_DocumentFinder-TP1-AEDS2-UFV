Oh dont say those same idle lies  
Ive heard them before  
This fool who left his heart on an early train  
Wont buy no more  
  
Oh no dont use  
Those same weeping eyes  
Ill wipe them no more  
I didnt want to have to be cruel  
But the truth must be said  
And you aint heard enough  
  
Oh it was not so long ago  
Since you wandered out of here  
To become a silver model  
Of a city on the air  
So dont choke me with your lies  
Because this man has open eyes  
And I can see  
I can see I can tell  
  
I had it enough  
All those sneaky bars and smart parties  
Had enough  
All those sweet friends and lovers  
Ive Ive had enough  
All those lonely rooms  
And blank faces  
Had enough  
And I want you I want you no more  
I want you I want you no more  
  
Oh dont say those same idle lies  
Ive heard them before  
This fool who left his heart on an early train  
Wont buy no more
