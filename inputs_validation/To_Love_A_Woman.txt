Enrique  
I dont know what it is but she drives me crazy  
I dont know what she does but she drives me wild  
If only she could let me be the man I want to be  
Well she can leave me helpless as a child  
  
Lionel  
I dont know how it is but she has the power  
She can make me laugh when I want to cry oh yeah  
She tells me that Im in control but I know its just a lie  
  
And I dont mind oh  
Will she love you tomorrow like she loves you today  
She can keep your heart guessing but shes yours if she stays  
And thats what it feels like  
To love a woman  
To love a woman
