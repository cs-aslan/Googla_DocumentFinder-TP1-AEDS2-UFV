I heard my Saviour calling me  
He saved my soul He set me free  
I know Hell never let me fall  
Praise out I heard my Saviour call  
I was a sinner traveling on a weary road  
So far from home  
But now sweet heaven is my all  
Praise out I heard my Saviour call  
I heard my Saviour calling me  
He saved my soul He set me free  
I know Hell never let me fall  
Praise out I heard my Saviour call  
Im on my way to better land  
And there Ill join that heavenly band  
All through the ages I will sing  
Hosanna is my heavenly King  
I heard my Saviour calling me  
He saved my soul He set me free  
I know Hell never let me fall  
Praise out I heard my Saviour call
