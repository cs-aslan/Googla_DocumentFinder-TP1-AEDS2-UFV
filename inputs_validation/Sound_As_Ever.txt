I can read your degree and now give me my medicine  
Cause every drink is a poison and I think Im Judas Christ again  
Shes got a feeling its a sound Im faking  
I got a feeling each corners an ending  
Each minute is a dollar you can pay back your parents with  
I got a brand new vein you can tap on in and since  
Now that youve got the power of mercy  
And the chance to figure out just where Ive been lately  
Now that youve got a sniff of pharmaceutic  
That can kill anything in my head thats electric  
And Im alone with sound  
Now that youve got the power prescription  
Please make me interesting  
When Im all done with sound  
Read my mind  
Cause I wont give sign  
Shes got a feeling its a sound Im faking  
I got a feeling each corners an ending  
Its all sound
