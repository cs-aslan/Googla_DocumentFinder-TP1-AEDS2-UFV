Clocks and spoons and empty rooms  
Its raining out tonight  
What a way to end a day  
By turnin out the light  
Shoot the moon right between the eyes  
Im sending most of me to sunny country side  
  
Runnin through sky of blue rollin in the sun  
Every day has a way of overflowing wine  
Shoot the moon right between the eyes  
Im keeping most of me in sunny country side  
  
Dont know how I did that now wonder where its gone  
Must have spent the way I went waitin for the dawn  
Shoot the moon right between the eyes  
Im screaming  
Take me back to sunny country side
