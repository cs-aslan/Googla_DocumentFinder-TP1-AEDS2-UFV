I declare I dont care no more  
Im burning up and out and  
Growing bored  
In my smoked out boring room  
My hair is shagging in my eyes  
Dragging my feet to hit the  
Street tonight  
To drive along these shit  
Town lights  
Im not growing up  
Im just burning out  
And I stepped in line  
To walk amongst the  
Dead  
  
Apathy has rained on me  
Now Im feeling like a  
Soggy dream  
So close to drowning but  
I dont mind  
Ill live inside this mental cave  
Throw emotions in the grave  
Hell who needs them  
Anyway  
So close to drowning but  
I dont mind  
Ive lived in this mental cave  
Throw my emotions in the grave  
Hell who needs them  
Anyway
