Well I ride on a mailtrain baby  
Cant buy a thrill  
Ive been up all night baby  
Leanin on the window sill  
If I die  
On top of the hill  
And if I dont make it  
You know my baby will  
  
Dont the moon look good mama  
Shinin down through the trees  
Dont the brakeman look good mama  
Flagging down the Double E  
Dont the sun look good  
Goin down over the sea  
Dont my gal look fine  
When shes comin after me  
  
Wintertime is coming  
The windows are filled with frost  
I went to tell everybody  
But I could not get across  
Well I wanna be your lover baby  
I dont wanna be your boss  
Dont say I never warned you  
If your train gets lost
