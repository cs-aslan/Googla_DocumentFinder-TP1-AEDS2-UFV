Backdoor to heaven  
  
Well now were alone  
My hearts in your hands I need someone to love  
Cant I be your friend I feel your rebel to me baby  
  
Wont you give me whats wrong or right now  
You got me praying oh baby on my knees  
Wont you let me in let me in let me in  
Your backdoor to heaven is in your arms tonight  
Youre my backdoor to heaven  
Wont you let me in let me in let me in  
  
Im just a sinner but aint that all the same  
So let me in let me in let me in  
The backdoor to heaven is in your arms to heaven  
Youre my backdoor to heaven  
Baby you gotta let me in let me in let me in  
The backdoor to heaven  
Yeah baby its my time  
Youre my backdoor to heaven
