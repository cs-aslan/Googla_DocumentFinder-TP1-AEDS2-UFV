Racers start your engines  
  
The checkered flag  
Is a waving  
My heart is racing  
Racing for you  
Its too sad  
That youre leaving  
I thought maybe we could  
Be something  
Now Im chasing you down  
In a fast car  
  
Chorus  
The speed  
The sound  
The wind  
The crowd  
You cant stop my heart  
Oh oh yeah  
Racing through my heart  
Oh oh yeah  
  
You are  
Ah ah  
Racing through my heart  
In a fast car  
  
Dont go too fast  
Youll break my heart  
Then I dont know what to do  
Cause Im still in love  
With you  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh yeah  
Racing  
Hey la  
Hey la  
Through my heart  
Oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Fast car
