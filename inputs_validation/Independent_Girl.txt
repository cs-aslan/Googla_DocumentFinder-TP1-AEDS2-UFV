A limousine in the night  
Drives away out of sight  
The girl inside has stolen my pride  
Run away with my whole life  
  
Dont expect shell turn around  
Think about what she left behind  
Its time to know whats goin on  
She turned my world around  
  
Shes the one shes the girl  
That left me in this misery  
Stole my pride stole my life  
Leaving me in mystery  
  
Youre my independent girl  
You try to rule my world  
And everytime she goes  
Shell cast me in her spell  
Independent girl living in her world  
You never know how well   
My love for her is blind  
  
Youre my independent girl  
You try to rule my world   
An independent girl  
  
Day and night she feels no shame  
Love to her is just a game  
Cause of her I feel I changed  
Feel the day of her return  
  
Calls my name plays the game  
Way ahead of time  
Stole my pride kills my life  
Leaving me in disbelief
