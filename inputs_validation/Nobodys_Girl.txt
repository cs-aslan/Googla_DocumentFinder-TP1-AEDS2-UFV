She dont need anybody to tell her shes pretty  
Shes heard it every single day of her life  
Hes got to wonder what she sees in himwhen theres so many others standing in
line  
She gives herself to him but hes still on the outside  
Shes alone in this world  
Shes nobodys girl  
Shes nobodys girl  
  
She shows up at this doorstep in the middle of the night  
Then she disappears for weeks at a time  
Its just enough to keep him wanting more  
But never is he satisfied  
  
And hes left to pick up the pieces  
Wondering what does he do this for  
Shes off in her own little world  
Shes nobodys girl  
Shes nobodys girl  
  
He said Before I met her I didnt love nothin  
I could take it or leave it that was okay  
But she brings out a want in meFor things  
I didnt even know that I need  
She does anything she wants anytime she wants to  
With anyone  
  
You know she wants it all  
Still she gets all upset over the least little thing  
When you hurt her it makes you feel so small  
And shes a walking contradiction  
But I ache for her inside  
Shes fragile like a string of pearls  
Shes nobodys girl  
Shes fragile like a string of pearls  
Shes nobodys girl  
Shes nobodys girlShes nobodys girl
