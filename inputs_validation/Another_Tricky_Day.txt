You cant always get it  
When you really want it  
You cant always get it at all  
Just because theres space  
In your life its a waste  
To spend your time why dont you wait for the call  
  
Just gotta get used to it  
We all get it in the end  
Just gotta get used to it  
We go down and we come up again  
Just gotta get used to it  
You irritate me my friend  
This is no social crisis  
This is you having fun  
No crisis  
Getting burned by the sun  
This is true  
This is no social crisis  
Just another tricky day for you  
  
You can always get higher  
Just because you aspire  
You could expire even knowing  
Dont push the hands  
Just hang on to the band  
You can dance while your knowledge is growing  
  
It could happen anytime  
You cant expect to never cry  
Patience is priceless  
Not when you try to fly so high  
Just stay on that line  
Rock and roll will never die  
This is no social crisis  
  
Another tricky day  
Another gently nagging pain  
What the papers say  
Just seems to bring down heavier rain  
The world seems in a spiral  
Life seems such a worthless title  
But break out and start a fire yall  
Its all here on the vinyl  
No crisis  
  
You cant always get it  
When you really want it  
You cant always get it at all  
Just because theres space  
In your life its a waste  
To spend your time why dont you wait for the call  
  
Just gotta get used to it  
Gotta get used to waiting  
Just gotta get used to it  
You know how the ice is  
Just gotta get used to it  
Its thin where youre skating  
This is no social crisis  
  
Just another tricky day for you fella
