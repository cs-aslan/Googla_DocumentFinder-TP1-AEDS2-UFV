I wasnt in the room when the action was going down  
I may have been there once but at the time I was out of town  
Im seeing strange fruit theyre saving off with his head  
One way or another Ill end up dead  
  
You got the wrong man  
You dont understand  
You got the wrong man  
You got the wrong man  
I do what I can  
  
I plead not guilty to the charges youve laid out on your desk  
l know what youre thinking Oh yes this is a DSF  
I think Im prime ministerial material but I cant lie to you  
So Im out of the running  
But from here in my cell I imagine  
Wouldnt that be something  
  
You got the wrong man  
You dont understand  
You got the wrong man  
You got the wrong man  
I do what I can
