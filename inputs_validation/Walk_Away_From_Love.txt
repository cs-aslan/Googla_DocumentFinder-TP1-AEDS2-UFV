Move along youre in my way  
Ive made my mind up not to stay  
And it dont matter what you do  
cause me Ive had enough of you  
And you can talk about the good times  
I can just remember bad times  
There aint nothing left for saying  
cause theres no way that Ill be staying  
You tell me to remember  
When I told you that Id never walk away  
  
Chorus  
Hey baby dont walk away from love  
Tell me baby aint my love enough  
Listen to the things I say  
And tell me why do you walk away from love  
  
Leave you standing on your own  
Its time I spent some time alone  
Need a while to think this out  
Not sure what its all about  
And its no use to sit there crying  
cause I can see youre only lying  
Now Ill put the past behind me  
Run some place where you cant find me  
You tell me to remember  
When I told you that Id never walk away  
  
Chorus  
  
Bags are packed I just cant wait  
Gotta get out before it gets too late  
I dont need you any more  
And I dont need your love for sure  
And you can talk about the good times  
I can just remember bad times  
There aint nothing left for saying  
cause there no way that Ill be staying  
You tell me to remember when I told you that Id never walk away  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont walk away from love
