Do you remember anyone here  
No you dont remember anything at all  
Im sleeping Im flat on my back  
Never woke up had no regrets  
  
Theres a party in my mind  
And it never stops  
Theres a party up there all the time  
Theyll party till they drop  
Other people can go home  
Other people they can split  
Ill be here all the time  
I can never quit  
  
Take a walk through the land of shadows  
Take a walk through the peaceful meadows  
Try not to look so disappointed  
It isnt what you hoped for is it  
Theres a party in my mind  
And I hope it never stops  
Im stuck here in this seat  
I might not stand up  
  
Other people can go home  
Everyone else will split  
Ill be here all the time  
I can never quit  
  
Everything is very quiet  
Everyone has gone to sleep  
Im wide awake on memories  
There memories cant wait
