I said Im sitting here watching  
Matchbox hole in my clothes  
I said Im sitting here wondering  
Matchbox hole in my clothes  
I aint got no matches  
But I sure got a long way to go  
  
Im an old poor boy  
Im a long way from home  
Im an old poor boy  
And Im a long way from home  
Ive never been happy  
Cause everything I ever did was wrong  
  
Well if you dont want my peaches  
Honey please dont shake my tree  
If you dont want any of those peaches  
Honey please dont mess around my tree  
Ive got news for you baby  
Leave me here in misery all right  
  
Well let me be your little dog  
Till your big dog comes  
Let me be your little dog  
Till your big dog comes  
And when your big dog gets here  
Watch how your puppy dog runs  
  
Well I said Im sitting here watching  
Matchbox hole in my clothes  
I said Im sitting here wondering  
Matchbox hole in my clothes  
I aint got no matches  
But I sure got a long way to go
