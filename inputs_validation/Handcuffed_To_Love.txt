Im handcuffed to the only love I knew  
Yet I never committed any crime  
Like a prisoner alone in his cell  
Im hundcuffed to the love Ive thought was mine  
Theres no way out and no one to ease my pain  
My memories are haunting me in vain  
You promised to be always at my side  
Forever until the end of time  
Now youre laughing at the tears I cannot hide  
Im hundcuffed to the love Ive thought was mine  
  
Im handcuffed to the only love I knew  
Like a prisoner a serving a lifetime  
Oh Lord I need your helping hand Im hundcuffed  
To the love Ive thought was mine  
Theres no way out and no one to ease my pain  
My memories are haunting me in vain  
I pray you will return to me  
And remain until to end of time  
Please open th pathway to your heart  
Im hundcuffed to the love Ive thought was mine
