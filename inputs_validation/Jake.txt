A boy gets crazy when hes sittin at the bar  
Dont you mess with Jake dont you push him too far  
Rotgut whiskey and homemade wine  
Make a good country boy just lose his mind  
Like a runaway train rollin through the night the boy aint got no fear  
Like a race car hittin the wall it gets hard to steer  
Waitin for the smoke to clear  
  
Betty got caught in the back of Bobbys car  
Bobby got caught with his hand in the cookie jar  
Her Daddy blew a fuse and went for his gun  
Now Bobby and Betty theyre on the run  
Like a runaway train rollin thought the night nothins gonna stop them now  
Gotta keep on moving cover their tracks somehow  
  
Like a runaway train rollin through the night  
The kids aint got no fear  
Daddy swears bang is the last sound Bobbys gonna hear oh  
Waitin for the smoke to clear  
  
Daddy finally caught em and he emptied his gun  
Put a dead end to all of Bobbys fun oh  
Good god almighty for heavens sakes  
Bettys Daddy turned out to be Jake  
  
Like a runaway train rollin through the night  
Jake aint got no fear  
No hangman judge gonna give the boy 99 years  
  
Here sits Jake in the back of this bar  
Sippin on an ice cold beer  
If the law had a clue all theyd do is look right here  
Theyd see Jake  
Waitin for the smoke to clear waitin for  
Oh
