Its not the way that you look  
Or the way that you comb your hair  
I know well always be there  
By the look by the book  
And your troops and your devil may care  
I know well always be there  
I know well always be there  
  
And by the way your eyes are shining through  
Theres nothing to do but wake up in light  
And like the way your eyes they shine with the sun  
And lighten everyone who wakes up in time to see  
The face smiled back easily  
  
I know well always be there  
By the look by the book  
And your troops as your devil may care  
I know well always be there  
I know well always be there  
  
Its not the way that you look  
Or the way that you comb your hair  
I know well always be there x3
