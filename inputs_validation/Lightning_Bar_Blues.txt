Chorus  
I dont need no diamond ring  
I dont need no Cadillac car  
Just want to drink my Ripple wine  
Down in the Lightnin Bar  
Down in the Lightnin Bar  
  
Some people value fortune and fame  
I dont care about em none  
Just want to drink my Ripple wine  
I want to have my good time fun  
Have my good time fun  
  
Chorus  
  
When I die dont cry for me  
Dont bury me at all  
Place my livin laughin lovin bones  
In a jar of alcohol  
Hundred proof alcohol  
  
Chorus
