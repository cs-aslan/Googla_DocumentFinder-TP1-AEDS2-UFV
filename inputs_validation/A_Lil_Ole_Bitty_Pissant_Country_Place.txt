Its just a little bitty pissant country place  
Aint nothin much to see  
No drinking allowed we get a nice quiet crowd plain as it can be  
Its just a piddly squatin old time country place  
Aint nothing to hide at all  
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill  
But theres nothing dirty going on  
Nothing dirty going on  
We get simple farmers local business men  
Congress folks from Austin young boys looking for sin  
Now we used to get a lot of rough necks when the oil boom was high  
But pay day would get a little rowdy thank God the field ran dry  
  
Chorus  
  
Its just a little bitty pissant country place nothing much to see  
No drinking allowed we get a nice quiet crowd plain as it can be  
Its just a piddly squatin no time country place nothing to hide at all  
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill but theres nothing dirty
going on  
  
I dont hire no married girl theyre not on the ball  
They got homes and husbands theyre not stable at all  
You know they dont understand a thing about a proper business day  
Now whats the point in opening up the store if you give the goods away  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Keep your language clean girls keep your bedrooms neat  
And dont hang around the town cafe and say hi on the street  
Mind you Ps and Qs and manners and you dont need no other tools  
Cause every girl that lives here knows my special nono rules  
  
Yea every girl that lives here knows Miss Monas nono rules  
  
Ruby Ray start em  
  
Beds are not to be wallowed in  
Thats the kind of thing that big fat lazy hogs do  
  
And it dont make money  
Betrix  
  
I wont tolerate no tying my telephone with other peoples business  
  
Eloise honey  
  
And please dont show us no tattoos  
No hearts and flowers on your thigh  
  
Its downright tacky  
  
Brands for the cattle and that aint what were selling at Miss Monas  
  
Do you catch my drift  
I pay the food and the rent and the utilities  
You keep your mind on your work responsibilities  
Dont let your mouth overload your capabilities  
And we can get along  
Dawn  
  
Any bad habits you come in with get rid off right now  
  
Tatty Joe  
  
I cant stand no chewing gum it looks just like a cow  
  
Lindy Lue  
  
Any one taking sick leave for to make real sure their sick  
  
And every time you hear that bell  
You better get here double quick  
  
And as for pimps  
Pimps are something you dont need  
To get your daily business done  
Are you listening good  
Keep them leaches and blood suckers of the bathrobes  
And I know how to use a gun  
And nobody messes with my girls  
  
And any questions you might have about the way I run this place  
Dont grip and whine behind my back  
Just tell me face to face Im openminded say it all  
Then go upstairs and pack the doors that way  
  
She pays the food and the rent and the utilities  
We keep our mind on our work responsibilities  
Dont let your mouth overload your capabilities  
And we can get along  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Its just a little bitty pissant country place nothing much to see  
No drinking allowed we get a nice quiet crowd plain as it can be  
Its just a piddly squatin no time country place nothing to hide at all  
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill  
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill  
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill  
But theres nothing dirty going on  
Nothing dirty going on
