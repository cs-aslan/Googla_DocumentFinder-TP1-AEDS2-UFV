I dont drink as much as I used to  
Cause lately that just aint my style  
And the hard times dont hurt like they oughta  
They pass quickly like when I was a child  
  
And lately Ive learnt how to listen  
To a sound like the sun going down  
In the magic that morning is bringing  
Theres a song for the life I have found  
  
It keeps my feet on the ground  
  
Now the midsummer days aint so heady  
They just drift like a breeze through my mind  
And nothing appears in a hurry  
As if to make up for some old longlost time  
  
And lately Ive learnt how to listen  
To a sound like the sun going down  
In the magic that morning is bringing  
Theres a song for the friends I have found  
  
They keep my feet on the ground  
They keep my feet on the ground  
They keep my feet on the ground
