Rook Rook Read from your book  
Who murders who and where is the treasure hid  
Crow Crow Spill all you know  
Is that my name on the bell  
Rook Rook Gaze in the brook  
If theres a secret can I be part of it  
Crow Crow Before Ill let go say is that my name on the bell  
Soar up high see the semaphore from the washing lines  
Break the code of the whispering chimneys and traffic signs  
Wheres the message thats written under the base of clouds  
Plans eternal I know you know so dont blurt out loud  
Rook Rook By hook or by crook  
Ill make you tell me what this whole things about  
Crow Crow Why cant you show  
If thats my name on the bell  
On the wings of night I fly too above field and stream  
My head bursting with knowledge till I wake from the dream  
If I die and I find that I had a soul inside  
Promise me that youll take it up on its final ride  
Rook Rook Gaze in the brook  
If theres a secret can I be part of it  
Crow Crow Before Ill let go say is that my name on the bell  
Is that my name on the bell
