When the deal goin down and you gonna take your chance  
Theres always just a mystery that locks you in a trance  
No matter what the future brings youre booked and lawd youre bound  
Be steppin softly when you know the deal is goin down  
When the deal go down and the noose is bein tied  
aint no gettin round it fade back and let it lie  
No matter what the future brings youre booked and lawd youre bound  
Be steppin softly when you know the deal is goin down  
No matter what the future brings youre booked and lawd youre bound  
Be steppin softly when you know  
No matter what the future brings youre booked and lawd youre bound  
Be steppin softly when you know the deal is goin down  
Goin down  
Down down  
Im going down
