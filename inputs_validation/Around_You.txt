I call you my friend  
And thats all that I knew  
Why do I have to pretend  
To find ways to be around you  
Youve been there all along  
Holding my hand like you do  
Why do I feel that its wrong  
To love to be around you  
And I think Im losing my mind  
Maybe I have been hopelessly blind to your beauty  
And you have a sweet sinful smile Im in trouble  
Cause you turn me upside down and around and around  
Do you feel what I feel Well  
Do you feel this way too  
That every wound seems to heal when I am around you  
And I must be losing my mind  
Maybe I have been hopelessly blind to your beauty  
And you have a sweet sinful smile Im in trouble  
Cause you turn me upside down and around and around and around  
And I must be losing my mind  
Maybe you have a sweet sinful smile Im in trouble  
Cause you turn me upside down and around and around  
Turn me upside down and around and around  
Turn me upside down and around and around  
My feet dont touch the ground  
When Im around you  
When Im around you you you you you
