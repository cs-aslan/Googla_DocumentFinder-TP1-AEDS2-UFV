Free my eyes  
Fill the skies  
Weve been dancing in your absence  
  
Chorus  
Da da da  
Morning hola soleil  
  
Weve kept the darkness light  
Dancing for the sun  
To come back and rise up shining  
  
Welcome home  
Mother sun  
Children reaching up like flowers  
  
Chorus  
  
We made it through the night  
Knowing youd return  
To bless us with another morning  
  
Baking sand shining sea  
Turning world  
Dissolving shadows  
  
Chorus  
  
Behold the warmth of day  
Rising near the shore  
Hear the music start up playing
