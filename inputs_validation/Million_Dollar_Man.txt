You said I was the most exotic flower  
Holding me close in our final hour  
  
I dont know how you convince them and get them boy  
I dont know what you do but youre unbelievable  
I dont know how you get over get over  
Someone as dangerous tainted and flawed as you  
  
One for the money and two for the show  
I love you honey Im ready Im ready to go  
How did you get that way I dont know  
Youre screwed up youre brilliant  
You look like a million dollar man  
So why is my heart broke  
  
You got that world but baby at what price  
Something so strange and its hard to define  
  
It isnt that hard boy to like you or even love you  
I will follow you down down down  
youre unbelievable  
if youre going crazy just grab me and take me  
I would follow you down down down like anywhere anywhere  
  
Repeat x2  
One for the money two for the show  
I love you honey Im ready Im ready to go  
How did you get that way I dont know  
Youre screwed up youre brilliant  
You look like a million dollar man  
So why is my heart broke  
  
I dont know  
Youre screwed up youre brilliant  
You look like a million dollar man  
So why is my heart broke
