It aint always easy  
Movin day to day  
She said she wants to tease me so Im on my way  
  
When youre alone it aint easy  
Youre like a dog that roams  
Aint got no girl to tease me  
Aint got nobody home

Youre like a dog that roams  
Aint got no girl to tease me  
Aint got nobody home

Youre like a dog that roams  
Aint got no girl to tease me
