Forget if you can  
Romantic music one magical night  
A corner table in dim candle light  
A kiss that was heaven for two  
  
Forget if you can  
The day we hiked to where nobody knows  
The swell spaghetti at Tony and Joes  
It hasnt been fun without you  
  
Dont you remember  
All the silly things we used to do  
The way we laughed  
When we were photographed  
As Handsome Hat and his tentiming gal  
Why shouldnt we play  
More happy moments like we used to spend  
They were so perfect  
Too perfect to end  
Let your heart forget it you can
