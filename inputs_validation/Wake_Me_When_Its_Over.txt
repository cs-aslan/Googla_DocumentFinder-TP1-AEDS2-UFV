If I am dreaming youve got your arms around me  
Wake me when its over  
Wake me when its over not before  
  
And if Im dreaming that love at last has found me  
Let me go on dreaming  
Wake me when its over and then let me go to sleep again  
  
Its hard to believe my dear that youre here at all  
Incredible I pinch myself you dont disappear at all  
So if Im hearing you tell some smalltown justice you will not forsake me  
Takin vows to make me yours ever more  
Then darling wake me when its over and not before  
  
Oh wake me when its over  
Wake me when its over and then back to sleep again  
  
Its hard to believe my dear that youre here at all  
Incredible you dont disappear at all  
So tell that smalltown justice youll take me  
Tell Im youll make me yours ever more  
Then darling wake me when its over not before
