What good is a dream  
A plan or a scheme  
The rainbow that you pursue  
Its everything and its nothing  
Without someone to tell it to  
  
How eager you are  
To get to that star  
But after the journeys through  
Youre only a lonely dreamer  
Without someone to tell it to  
  
Therell be blue days  
Hard to get through days  
Days when youll just want to die  
Soon youre older  
And the worlds colder  
When theres no shoulder to cry on  
  
Castles in air  
Are empty and bare  
With no one to share the view  
The moonlight is merely moonlight  
Theres no magic in I love you  
Without someone  
Someone to tell it to  
  
The moonlight is merely moonlight  
Theres no magic in I love you  
Without someone  
Someone to tell it to
