You say youre all alone  
With visions all your own  
The things you feel nobody feels the same  
But you know me  
You know what Ive been through  
  
And everything that touches me  
And everything that touches me  
Everything that touches me  
Touches you  
  
Friends along the road  
May lighten up your load  
By sayin what they think you really want to hear  
But Ill only tell you  
What I feel is true  
  
And everything that touches me  
Everything that touches me  
And everything that touches me  
Touches you  
  
Share cause I cant take you there  
Unless I know a part of what youre thinking  
Care cause its only fair  
Darlin cant you feel my heart is breaking  
My heart is breaking  
  
Everything that touches me  
Everything that touches me  
Everything that touches me  
Touches you
