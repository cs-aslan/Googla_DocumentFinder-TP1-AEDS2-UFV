It was long after midnight  
When we got to unconditional love  
She said sure my heart is boundless  
But dont push my limits too far  
  
I said if love was so transcendent  
I dont understand these boundaries  
She said just dont disappoint me  
You know how complex women are  
Ill be around  
If you dont let me down  
Too far  
  
It was just before sunrise  
When we started on traditional roles  
She said sure Ill be your partner  
But dont make too many demands  
  
I said if love has these conditions  
I dont understand those songs you love  
She said this is not a love song  
This isnt fantasyland  
Ill be around  
If you dont push me down  
Too far  
  
Dont go too far  
The phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea  
Is a cold fire  
Dont cross the line  
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor  
Is a cold fire  
Dont let me down  
The flame at the heart of a pawnbrokers diamond  
Is a cold fire  
Dont break the spell  
The look in your eyes as you head for the door  
Is a cold fire  
  
Love is blind if you are gentle  
Love can turn to a long cold burn
