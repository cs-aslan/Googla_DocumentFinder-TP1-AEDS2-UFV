Im half past lovin  
And I got no more time for you  
Half past lovin  
And thats all that I can do  
Your hands keep movin  
But your face keeps standin still  
I got no time to lose  
And I aint got time to kill  
The wheels keep turnin  
All through the night and day  
Wheels keep turnin  
What else can I say  
Time keeps changin  
Like we knew it always will  
I got no time to lose  
And I aint got time to kill  
You got good timin honey  
And your rhythms fine as it can be  
You got good timin babe  
And your motions right for me
