Yeah  
  
Chorus  
I guess  
That this is where weve come to  
If you dont want to  
Then you dont have to  
Believe me  
But I wont be there when you go down  
Just so you know now  
Youre on your own now believe me  
  
Yeah  
  
I dont wanna be the one to blame  
You like fun and games  
Keep playin them  
Im just sayin  
Think back then  
We was like one and the same  
On the right track  
But I was on the wrong train  
Its like that  
Now youve gotta face the pain  
And the devils got a fresh new place to play  
In your brain like a maze you could never escape the rain  
Every damn days the same shade of grey  
  
Hey  
  
I used to have a little bit of a plan  
Used to have a concept of where I stand  
But that concept slipped right outta my hand  
And now I dont really even know who I am yo  
What do I have to say  
Maybe I should do what I have to do to break free  
And whatever happens to you well see  
But its not gonna happen with me  
  
Chorus  
I guess  
That this is where weve come to yeah  
If you dont want to  
Then you dont have to  
Believe me  
But I wont be there when you go down yeah  
Just so you know now  
Youre on your own now believe me  
  
Back then I thought you were just like me  
Somebody who could see all the pain I see  
But you proved to me unintentionally  
That you would selfdestruct eventually  
Now Im thinking like a mistake I made doesnt hurt but  
Its not gonna work  
cause its really much worse than I thought  
I wished you were something you were not  
And now this guilt is really all that Ive got all  
  
You turn your back and walk away in shame  
All you got is a memory of pain  
Nothing makes sense if you stare at the ground  
I hear my voice in your head when noone else is aroundelse is around  
So what do I have to say  
Maybe I should do what I have to do to break free  
And whatever happens to you well see  
But its not gonna happen with me  
  
Chorus  
I guess  
That this is where weve come to yeah  
If you dont want to  
Then you dont have to  
Believe me  
But I wont be there when you go down yeah  
Just so you know now  
Youre on your own now believe me  
  
Yeah  
  
yeah  
  
Yo  
  
Chorus  
I guess  
That this is where weve come to yeah  
If you dont want to  
Then you dont have to  
Believe me  
But I wont be there when you go down yeah  
Just so you know now  
Youre on your own now believe me  
  
Ill do what I have to do  
Youre on your own now believe me  
Whatever happens to you  
Youre on your own now believe me  
What do I have to say  
Youre on your own now believe me  
Its not gonna happen to me  
Youre on your own now believe me
