Leave me lonely just dont keep me hangin on  
These sleepless nights might kill me  
But what dont break me will make me strong  
Enough to get past the past in front of me  
Ill have to pass some memories  
Ill be alright get by just fine  
Say goodbye and  
  
Bring on hes long gone done me wrong  
Tears Im gonna cry  
When you say goodbye baby I wont be lonely long  
I wont be lonely long  
  
Go on and go on with your life  
Just dont waste one more minute of mine  
Save your precious breath the one that took mine away  
Once upon a time you had me  
Hangin on every word believin everything I heard  
Youre leaving sooner or later  
Baby why keep me waitin  
  
Bring on hes long gone done me wrong  
Tears Im gonna cry  
When you say goodbye baby I wont be lonely long  
I wont be lonely long  
  
Id be lying sayin I aint afraid  
But fear of leavin aint no reason to stay  
Ah hey  
  
So baby bring on hes long gone done me wrong  
Tears Im gonna cry  
When you say goodbye baby I  
When you say goodbye baby I wont be lonely long  
I wont be lonely long  
Yeah wont be lonely long
