Ive got a mind that youll never see  
Ive got amazing remedies  
Ive got a heart that only wants to please  
You wouldnt notice if I slapped you and I  
  
Let go my friend  
Telling you I Let go my friend  
You know I had to let go my friend  
Telling you I let go my friend as you  
  
Sail on by  
No girl is an island  
I live in denial as you  
Sail on by  
Theres more behind this crying  
Than meets the eye  
  
Ive got a hand on the radio  
Ive got a song on the video  
I work my fingers to the bone  
You wouldnt notice  
If I were a slacker and I  
  
Let go my friend  
Telling you I let go my friend  
You know I had to let go my friend  
Telling you I Let go my friend  
  
Sail on by  
No girl is an island  
I live in denial as you  
Sail on by  
Theres more behind this crying  
Than meets the eye you  
  
Repeat chorus
