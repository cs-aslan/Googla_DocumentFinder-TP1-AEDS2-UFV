You tear me down a hundred times a day Ive cried enough to wash the world
away  
Ive tried so hard to be what youve wanted me to be  
Til somewhere along the way I lost me  
To give and keep on giving I have learned  
  
Theres no way but yours where youre concerned  
I tried till finally I lost my own identity and somewhere along the way I lost
me  
Somewhere along the way I lost the man I used to be  
A man who smiled enjoyed life loved you with all of me  
  
Youd never once considered how I felt so go ahead and live my life yourself  
Ive tried so hard to be what you wanted me to be  
Somewhere along the way I lost me somewhere along the way I lost me
