Sioux City Sue Sioux City Sue  
Your hair is red your eyes are blue  
Id swap my horse and dog for you oh  
Sioux City Sue Sioux City Sue  
There aint no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue  
  
I drove a herd of cattle out  
From old Nebraska way  
Thats how I come to be in the state of Ioway  
I met a gal and asked her how  
She said Indeed I do  
I asked her what her name was and she said  
Sioux City Sue

Your hair is red your eyes are blue  
Id swap my horse and dog for you oh

There aint no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue
