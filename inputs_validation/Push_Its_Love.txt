I take you walking out tonight  
Im looking good for you  
What you see is what you get  
You wont need a clue  
Come on girl give it all youve got  
Dont just stand and stare  
Love love love love  
Love me if you really dare  
And you know that Ill come  
Ill do it anywhere  
In and out and up and down  
As long as we get there  
Push its love make it feel so good  
Push its love do it like you should  
I cant stop when youre so hot  
Oh really let it go  
Its standing up or sitting down  
Come on let me know  
Make it to the music  
Love it like you dont care  
Down down down down  
Get it right down there  
And you know that Ill come  
Ill do it anywhere  
In and out up and down  
As long as we get there  
Push its love make it feel so good  
Push its love do it like you should  
When I get to rollin now  
Watch this trouser snake  
An oh my baby hang on in  
Keep on till you shake  
When you dance dressed way low  
Ill be at your feet  
You know know know know  
Youre good enough to eat  
And you know that Ill come  
Ill do it anywhere  
In and out up and down  
As long as we get there  
Push its love make it feel so good  
Push its love do it like you should
