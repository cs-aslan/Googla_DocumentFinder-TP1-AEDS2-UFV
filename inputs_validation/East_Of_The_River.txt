Let love shine  
  
Gotta gotta know  
I see the sun in your eyes  
Let me take your hand  
And well go to wonderland  
I bet youve asked silly questions  
Like do I still love you  
Better believe it honey  
  
Cause youre the girl from the east of the river  
Cause youre the girl from the east of the river  
Cause youre the girl from the east of the river  
  
They all went mad  
On the way out west hells bells baby  
But you can bet your bottom dollar  
That my arch full flame  
May win you over bring it back bring it back bring it back cmon now baby  
Im the lie that tells the truth  
  
Cause youre the girl from the east of the river  
Cause youre the girl from the east of the river  
  
Where the grass is always greener  
And the pavements  
Are all paved with gold  
Please please dont be told  
Cmon I said east of the river  
  
I dont want to work for nobody but you  
  
Youre the girl from the east of the river  
Youre the girl from the east of the river  
Youre the girl from the east of the river  
Youre the girl from the east of the river
