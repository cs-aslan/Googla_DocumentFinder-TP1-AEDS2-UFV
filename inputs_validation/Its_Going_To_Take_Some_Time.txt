Its gonna take some time this time  
To get myself in shape  
I really fell out of line this time  
I really missed the gate  
The birds on the telephone like next time  
Are cryin out to me next time  
And I wont be so blind next time  
And Ill find some harmony  
  
But its going to take some time this time  
And I cant make demands  
But like the young trees in the winter time  
Ill learn how to bend  
After all the tears weve spent  
How could we make amends  
So its one more round for experience  
And Im on the road again  
And its going to take some time this time  
  
But its going to take some time this time  
No matter what Ive planned  
And like the young trees in the winter time  
Ill learn how to bend  
After all the tears weve spent  
How could we make amends  
So its one more round for experience  
And Im on the road again  
And its going to take some time this time
