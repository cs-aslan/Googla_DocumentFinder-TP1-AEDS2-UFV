Look for a while at the China Cat sunflower  
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun  
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono  
Like a crazy quilt star gown through a dream night wind  
  
Crazy cat peekin through a lace bandanna  
Like a oneeyed Cheshire like a diamondeye jack  
A leaf of all colors plays a goldenstring fiddle  
To a doubleE waterfall over my back  
  
Comic book colors on a violin river cryin Leonardo  
Words from out a silk trombone  
I rang a silent bell beneath a shower of pearls  
In the eaglewinged palace of the Queen Chinee
