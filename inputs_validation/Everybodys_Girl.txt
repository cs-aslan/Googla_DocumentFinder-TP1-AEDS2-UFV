Lets play a game  
Lets just pretend like you dont know who I am  
Believe it if you say that youre not a fan  
Act like Im interested in some other man  
  
Turn on the lights  
So that the cameras flashing wont be so bright  
And let the crowd aint getting big outside  
Theyre wanting details on how I live my life  
  
Theres no escape from the fame  
To somewhere they dont know my name  
I love you I do feel your pain  
But the question still remain  
  
Chorus  
Can you love somebody loved by everybody  
Can you love somebody when theyre everybodys girl  
Can you love somebody loved by everybody  
Can you love somebody when theyre everybodys girl  
  
Can you love the can you love the can you love the girl  
Can you love the can you love the can you love the girl  
Can you love the can you love the can you love the girl  
Can you love her can you love her can you love her  
  
Out through the back  
Too many people blocking the front door  
We go our different ways so we want more  
Another gig I got in until four  
  
Theres no escape from the fame  
To somewhere they dont know my name  
I love you I do feel your pain  
But the question still remain  
  
Chorus  
  
I love it I love it  
Cool as summercool  
Im flying and I love it  
She just wants to be seen  
  
Can you hang to a shooting star  
Handle distance near and far  
Dont let the jealousy and envy get to you  
Cause Ill be running home back to you  
  
Chorus
