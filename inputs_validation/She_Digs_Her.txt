Your eyes hit a gilded window  
When the Housewives Journal started closing every door  
The winds so strong and you decided  
That you just dont want to be carried with it anymore  
Oh my God the neighbors  
Just cant put a word to it never seen to write or call  
Greetings to the sister  
As youre strutting through your suburb watching ladies trip and fall  
She came when he left never thought it was a big decision  
Gave up on lives that revolve around car ignition  
Hey did you ever get the feeling everything is working out okay  
Sunday afternoon sure used to sting until  
The drinks kick in at ten  
But now youve joined a collective  
Surely nothing ordinary kicking up a storm again  
Oh my God the neighbors  
Just cant put a word to it never seen to write or call  
Greetings to the sister  
As youre strutting through your suburb watching ladies trip and fall  
Came when he left never thought it was a big decision  
Gave up on lives that revolve around beer and fishing  
Hey did you ever get the feeling everything is working out okay
