Get out the crane  
Construction time again  
What is it this time  
Were laying a pipeline  
  
Let the beads of sweat flow  
Until the ends have met through  
Could take a long time  
Working on the pipeline  
  
Taking from the greedy  
Giving to the needy  
  
On this golden day  
Works been sent our way  
That could last a lifetime  
Working on the pipeline  
  
From the heart of our land  
To the mouth of the man  
Must reach him sometime  
Were laying a pipeline  
  
Taking from the greedy  
Giving to the needy
