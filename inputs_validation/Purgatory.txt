Thinking of an age old dream places I have never seen  
Fantasies lived times before  
I split my brain melt through the floor  
  
Over clouds my mind will fly forever now I cant think why  
My body tries to leave my soul  
Or is it me I just dont know  
Memories rising from the past the futures shadow overcast  
Somethings clutching at my head through the darkness Ill be led  
  
Oh another time another place  
Oh another smile on another face  
When you see me floating up beside you  
You get the feeling that all my loves inside of you  
  
Please take me away take me away so far away  
Please take me away take me away so far away  
Please take me away take me away so far away
