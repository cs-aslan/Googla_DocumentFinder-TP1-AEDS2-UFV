When I was feeling bout sixteen I never had no idea  
Listen to me if you want to know what I mean your expression will let me see  
I never knew what I was looking for I never had the time  
And now that time has opened up my door now Im looking forward just to see
what just whats mine  
  
When I was feeling bout eighteen its then when I began to see  
No matter how hard you push on the door it wont open without the key  
Opportunity only knocks once if you shut it out its a sin  
And when something keeps right on poundin then my friend youd better let
it in  
  
Now I feel just a little bit old and sadness fills my brain  
I can flash to future years and nothing is the same  
Nothing is the same  
Nothing is the same  
Nothing is the same
