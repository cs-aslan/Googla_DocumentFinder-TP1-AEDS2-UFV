Lets be undecided lets take our time  
And sooner or later we will know our mind  
Well be on the outside we wont care  
Cause were together thats somewhere  
And theres a big day coming about a mile away  
Theres a big day coming I can hardly wait  
Lets wake up the neighbors lets turn up our amps  
And we know were used to without a plan  
We can play a Stones song sitting on a fence  
And itll sound pretty good til I forget how it ends  
I woke up early couldnt go back to sleep  
Cause I had been thinking of where it all would lead  
So I made you wake up I said Lets take a walk  
I wanna hold your hand we dont have to talk
