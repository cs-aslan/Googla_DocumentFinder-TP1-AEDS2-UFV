How dare you wear robes and reside  
How dare you cover your head to hide  
Your face from God  
  
How dare you smile from behind your beard  
To hide the fact that your hearts are feared  
And wave your rod  
  
How dare you be the one to assess  
Me in this godforsaken mess  
You a man in a purple dress  
A man in a purple dress  
  
When you place your frown  
Between my God and prayer  
However grand your crown  
Or dignified your hair  
Men above men all prats  
In your high hats  
  
You priest you mullah so high  
You pope you wise rabbi  
Youre invisible to me  
Like vapor from the sea  
  
I lovingly mock you noble lords  
We all dress up to grand awards  
I do that as well  
  
I dare condemn your fashion sense  
At least youre not astride the fence  
That wouldnt sell  
  
But I will deliver this address  
Your souls conditioned dont impress  
You a man in a purple dress  
A man in a purple dress
