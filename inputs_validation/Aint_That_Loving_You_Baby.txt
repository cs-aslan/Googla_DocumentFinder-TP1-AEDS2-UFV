I could ride around the world in an old oxcart  
And never let another girl thrill my heart  
  
Aint that loving you baby  
Aint that loving you baby  
Aint that loving you baby  
Aint that loving you so  
  
I could meet a hundred girls and have loads of fun  
My huggin and my kissin belong to just one  
  
Aint that loving you baby  
Aint that loving you baby  
Aint that loving you baby  
Aint that loving you so  
  
If you gave me nine lives like a tommy cat  
Id give em all to you and never take one back  
  
Aint that loving you baby  
Aint that loving you baby  
Aint that loving you baby  
Aint that loving you so  
  
Im putting on my Sunday suit and Im goin downtown  
But Ill be kissin your lips before the sun goes down  
  
Aint that loving you baby  
Aint that loving you baby  
Aint that loving you baby  
Aint that loving you so  
  
Aint that loving you baby  
Aint that loving you so
