It be night time when shadows fade  
She was dressed like a chamber maid  
All decked out in silk and I took her  
Like a cat takes to milk  
Come here little Queenie or  
Has the cat got your tongue  
Cant let nobody see me  
Come on girl while were still young  
Cause theres never been no lovers knot  
Can tie you down cause youre so hot  
Dont pinch me ass I may be dreamin  
Hope tonight that Ill be screamin  
  
Black cherry black cherry black cherry  
I like it I like it I like it  
  
She looked sheik in a funky way  
Tongue in cheek baby all the way  
Home girls they got pride she said  
One time around I said Lets go for a ride  
Come here little Queenie Or ah  
Has the cat got your tongue  
My best shot for a C note baby she said  
Thats why this Janies got a gun  
Because theres nothin like a good time girl  
To take you twice around the world  
Im so in lust I think Im trippin  
So in love I think Im slippin  
  
Down to the river down to the river of love  
Where the love runs deep its so sad its a love you cant keep  
  
Down to the river down to the river  
Abover 42nd Street its so sad  
That the bad dont come cheap  
  
Because theres nothing like a good time girl  
To take you twice around the world  
Right to the land of milk and honey  
Leave your troubles bring your money  
  
Black cherry black cherry black cherry  
I like it I like it I like it
