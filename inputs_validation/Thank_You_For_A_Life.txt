Thank you for a life that Id call happy  
Overlooking all that weve been through  
When it comes to loving Ive been lucky  
Everything I am I owe to you  
  
Thank for the little girls you gave me  
Thank you for them bouncing baby boys  
Thank you for the sadness  
That you saved me from the madness baby  
All Im crying now are tears of joy  
  
Thank you for that burning sun thats rising  
Golden in the air that smells so sweet  
Thank you for that empty far horizon  
That opens to a new eternity  
  
Thank you for a life that Id call happy  
Overlooking all that weve been through  
When it comes to loving Ive been lucky  
Everything I am I owe to you
