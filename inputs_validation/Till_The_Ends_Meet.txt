Its not the way that you say Adieu that  
Leaves behind you a smilin fool Its that  
I know youre a song come truebaby I love  
Youand Ill follow you till the ends meet  
  
And its the way that you touch my hand that  
Lets me know you will understand cause Ive  
Been feelin it in the land baby Im near  
You and Ill follow you till Im six deep  
  
Its not the way that you say Adieu that  
Leaves behind you a smilin fool its that I  
Know youre a song come true baby I love you  
And Ill follow you till the ends meet
