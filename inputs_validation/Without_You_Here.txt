I feel so empty  
As the plane takes off  
I see the ground below  
I know that one day  
It wont be long  
That you will also know  
Just how it feels  
To leave you now a hollow shell  
A broken bow  
I feel so empty high up in the air  
Where heavens meant to be  
The distance gets me  
When Im on my own  
Without you here with me  
  
My world is turning  
But its upside down  
Now youre so far away  
While you are learning  
How this world spins round  
Im in some other day  
What can i do  
But give my heart  
From far away  
A distant spark  
  
I feel a challenge  
For both you and i  
Thats how it has to be  
In life theres balance  
I hope time will fly  
Without you here with me  
  
What i am hoping for  
As life moves on  
And we reach finer years  
We wont be thinking  
Of the time thats gone  
Or wading through our tears  
Well smile as one  
And speak with pride  
How life has swung  
Back on our side  
  
I feel tomorrow  
Cant come by too soon  
To bring you back to see  
That love will follow  
Like the red balloon  
And youll come home to me  
I want you here with me
