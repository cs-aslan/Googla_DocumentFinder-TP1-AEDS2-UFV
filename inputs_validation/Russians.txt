In Europe and America theres a growing feeling of hysteria  
Conditioned to respond to all the threats  
In the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets  
MIster Krushchev said We will bury you  
I dont subscribe to this point of view  
Itd be such an ignorant thing to do  
If the Russians love their children too  
How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimers deadly toy  
There is no monopoly on common sense  
On either side of the political fence  
We share the same biology regardless of ideology  
Believe me when I say to you  
I hope the Russians love their children too  
  
There is no historical precedent  
To put the words in the mouth of the president  
Theres no such thing as a winnable war  
Its a lie we dont believe anymore  
Mister Reagan says We will protect you  
I dont subscribe to this point of view  
Believe me when I say to you  
I hope the Russians love their children too  
We share the same biology regardless of ideology  
But what might save us me and you  
Is if the Russians love their children too
