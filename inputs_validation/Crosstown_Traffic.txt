You jump in front of my car when you  
You know all the time that  
Ninty miles an hour girl is the speed I drive  
You tell me its alright you dont mind a little pain  
You say you just want me to take you for a ride  
Youre just like crosstown traffic  
So hard to get through to you  
Crosstown traffic  
I dont need to run over you  
Crosstown traffic  
All you do is slow me down  
And Im tryin to get on the other side of town  
Im not the only soul whos accused of hit and run  
Tire tracks all across your back  
I can see you had your fun  
But darlin cant you see my signals turn from green to red  
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead  
Youre just like crosstown traffic  
So hard to get through to you  
Crosstown traffic  
I dont need to run over you  
Crosstown traffic  
All you do is slow me down  
And I got better things on the other side of town
