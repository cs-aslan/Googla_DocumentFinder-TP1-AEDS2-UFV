I cant separate your fiction from fact  
Youre lost I know youre trying to wind your way back  
Youve been talking as fast as you can  
Im not listening anymore  
  
Now baby  
Youre changing all the rules  
Youre taking advantage of a fool  
  
Good evening  
Im Ed Burroughs  
And the name of this show is Person To Person  
Tonight were visiting the home of a very famous motion picture  
And television director  
Dr Van Steiner Im very sorry Im unable to attend this tremendous  
Occasion being given in your honor  
I would like to extend my sincerest best wishes to you
