Guess this means youre sorry  
Youre standing at my door  
Guess this means you take back  
All you said before  
Like how much you wanted  
Anyone but me  
Said youd never come back  
But here you are again  
  
Cause we belong together now yeah  
Forever united here somehow yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly  
My life my life would suck would suck without you  
Cause we belong together now yeah  
Forever united here somehow yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly  
My life my life would suck would suck without you
