Standing here in front of the mirror  
Its gonna be all right tonight  
Feelin hot yeah Im on fire  
Im never ever goin to tire  
  
Tonight its gonna be alright  
Chasing the night  
Its gonna be alright  
Chasing the night  
Its gonna be alright  
Chasing the night  
  
Live my life as I choose  
I paid the price paid my dues  
You know I need no alibi  
Daytime troubles fading  
Nights intoxicating  
Gonna have it all tonight  
That aint no lie  
  
Chorus  
Rock all night  
Sleep all day  
It dont matter what they say  
Aint never gonna change my ways  
And I wont be back till Monday  
  
Feelin exasperating  
Excitement generating  
Im never ever gonna tire  
City is overloading  
The circuits are exploding  
Aint comin down no Im too wired  
  
Chorus
