How do you feel  
How do you hate  
How do you wake up with the smile thats on your face  
Out on the moon  
If I was an astronaut could I get back to you  
Im out of my head  
Im out of excuses so Im staring at the bed  
And its you  
Its you  
  
I hold on I hold on  
I cant let go  
And you dont know how I feel  
Hold on I hold on  
Id sell my soul  
And you dont know how I feel  
  
Losing my heart  
Losing my pride  
Id burn our initials in the sun if it would shine  
I need a fresh start  
I was in heaven until this one fell apart  
Out on the run  
Out on this empty space since all of this begun  
I try  
I try  
  
I hold on I hold on  
I cant let go  
And you dont know how I feel  
Hold on I hold on  
Id sell my soul  
And you dont know how I feel  
  
Hold on hold on  
I cant let go  
And you dont how I feel  
  
And nothing seems to help  
And nothing seems to work  
And nothing isnt beautiful  
Im old enough to take all the blame for all of us  
Theres all the games and all the faces  
Im bleeding by myself and Im okay  
  
Hold on I hold on  
I cant let go  
And you dont know how I feel  
Hold on I hold on  
Id sell my soul  
And you dont know how I feel  
  
Hold on I hold on  
I cant let go  
And you dont know how I feel  
I hold on  
I cant let go  
And you dont know how I feel
