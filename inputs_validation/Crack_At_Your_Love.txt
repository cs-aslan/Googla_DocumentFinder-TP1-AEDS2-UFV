Ive been keepin my eyes on you  
I finally found the nerve to talk to you  
Theres something that you ought to know  
Dont you know that I love you so  
Our life together could be eternal bliss  
If we could just get close enough to kiss  
And ya know Id like to get a crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
You make me feel so warm inside  
A sense of humor you cant hide  
Who taught you darlin how to move that way  
And when you smile I know the worlds okay  
And when I see the twinkle in your eye  
It sends my heart all the way to the sky  
And ya know Id like to get a crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Lonely nights lonely days  
Lonely nights lonely days  
Im reachin out for you  
In my mind in my mind  
Im goin crazy  
Would ya be my baby  
Im gonna need a little help from above  
Would ya say no if I asked for your love  
I cant afford to get hurt again  
Like the time I remember when  
But I know Id like to get a crack at your  
And ya know Id like to get a crack at your  
Dont ya know Id like to get a crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love  
Crack at your love
