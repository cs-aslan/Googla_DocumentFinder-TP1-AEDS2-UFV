I was born in a crossfire hurricane  
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain  
But its all right now in fact its a gas  
But its all right Im Jumpin Jack Flash  
Its a Gas Gas Gas  
  
I was raised by a toothless bearded hag  
I was schooled with a strap right across my back  
But its all right now in fact its a gas  
But its all right Im Jumpin Jack Flash  
Its a Gas Gas Gas  
  
I was drowned I was washed up and left for dead  
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled  
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I was crowned with a spike right thru my head  
But its all right now in fact its a gas  
But its all right Im Jumpin Jack Flash  
Its a Gas Gas Gas  
  
Jumping Jack Flash its a gas  
Jumping Jack Flash its a gas  
Jumping Jack Flash its a gas  
Jumping Jack Flash its a gas  
Jumping Jack Flash
