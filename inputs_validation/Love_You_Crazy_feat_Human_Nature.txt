Watching the shadow dance  
Reflected in your eyes  
Open up and take a chance  talk to me  
Dont hold everything inside  
And if you want me say  
Hold me now  hold me now  
And its ok to say  please hold me now  
  
Lay your head down in my arms  
Whispering my name  
Go ahead and fall asleep  
Dream the night away  
  
I love you right  I love you wrong  
I love you weak  I love you strong  
I love you crazy everyday and all night long  
I share your joy  Ill ease your pain  
Ill take your sunshine and your rain  
Oh my baby  I love you crazy  
  
My hands are innocent  my arms are open wide  
Theres nothing to fight against  
Ill help you thru the stone cold night  
And if you feel afraid  reach for me  reach for me now  
Cause I cant stand the wait  reach for me now  
  
Ill be here when you awake  
Whispering your name  
Heres a promise I will make  
My love will never change  
  
I love you right  I love you wrong  
I love you weak  I love you strong  
I love you crazy everyday and all night long  
I share your joy  Ill ease your pain  
Ill take your sunshine and your rain  
Oh my baby  
  
I love you crazy high and crazy low  
More than you will ever know  
I will love you crazy all my life  
I love you right  
I love wrong  
I love you weak  
I love you strong  
  
I love you right  I love you wrong  
I love you weak  I love you strong  
I love you crazy everyday and all night long  
I share your joy  Ill ease your pain  
Ill take your sunshine and your rain  
Oh my baby  I love you crazy
