All of me why not take all of me  
Cant you see Im no good without you  
  
Take my lips I want to lose them  
Take my arms Ill never use them  
  
Your goodbyes they left me with eyes that cry  
How can I get along without you  
  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me  
  
Your goodbye left me with eyes that are crying  
Now Im lost without you  
  
And now that you took that part  
That used to be my heart  
  
All of me why not take all of me  
Cant you see that Im a mess without you  
  
You took the part that used to be my heart  
So why not take all of me
