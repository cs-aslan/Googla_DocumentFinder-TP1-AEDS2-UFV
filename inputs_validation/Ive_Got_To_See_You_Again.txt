Lines on your face dont bother me  
Down in my chair when you dance over me  
I cant help myself  
Ive got to see you again  
  
Late in the night when Im all alone  
And I look at the clock and I know youre  
not home  
I cant help myself  
Ive got to see you again  
  
I could almost go there  
Just to watch you be seen  
I could almost go there  
Just to live in a dream  
  
But no I wont go for any of those things  
To not touch your skin is not why I sing  
I cant help myself  
Ive got to see you again  
  
I could almost go there  
Just to watch you be seen  
I could almost go there  
Just to live in a dream  
  
No I wont go to share you with them  
But oh even though I know where  
youve been  
I cant help myself  
Ive got to see you again  
I cant help myself  
Ive got to see you again
