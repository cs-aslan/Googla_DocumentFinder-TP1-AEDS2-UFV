When you was a child lifes a game  
But you got all the rules all changed  
Pray to a spiritual God for material things  
Then wait by the phone but it dont ring  
  
So if you feel like you fell behind  
That mountain has got to big to climb  
Want to hang your head and say screw it  
Forget that shit lets get down to it  
Come onbaby  
  
Chours  
Mind tripper  
Dance sister  
Itll set you free  
Mind tripper  
Dance sister  
Keep the faith  
Forget the fame  
Dont let your balls go down the drain  
Itll set you free  
  
The news man shoves it down our throats  
The ratings score the victims choke  
The rest of us best stand clear  
For a few of us who got no fear  
  
So you feel like you sinned baby  
You got nothing left to hold  
Stop feeling like a number  
You best forget that shit that you been told  
Baby bring it on  
  
Mind tripper  
Dance sister  
Itll set you free  
Mind tripper  
Dance sister  
Bring her right here to me  
  
Mind tripper  
Dance sister  
That aint no way to change your past  
Just get your head out of your ass  
Itll set you free  
  
That shit comes down for miles  
And it really starts to stink  
Then dump it in the ocean  
Till its floatin at the brink  
And when that boat dont float no more  
Theyre just gonna let it sink  
Dont ask me no more questions baby  
You know what I mean yeah  
  
Well have you heard about it  
All the new talk on the streets  
Im coming out hard baby  
I hope your ready for a brand new me  
  
So get your head out of the gutter  
Thats no way to right that wronge  
Therell be time enough sleep baby  
When your dead and gone I said  
Bye bye baby  
  
Mind tripper  
Dance sister  
Itll set you free  
Mind tripper  
Dance sister  
Bring her right here to me  
  
Mind tripper  
Dance sister  
There aint no way to change your past  
Just get your head out of your ass  
  
Mind tripper  
Dance sister  
Keep the faith  
Forget the fame  
Dont let your balls go down the drain  
Let it set you free
