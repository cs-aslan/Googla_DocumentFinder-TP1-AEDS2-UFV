Hook  
Im so used to being used  
So I love when you call unexpected  
Cause I hate when the moments expected  
So Ima care for you you you  
Ima care for you you you you yeah  
Cause girl youre perfect  
Youre always worth it  
And you deserve it  
The way you work it  
Cause girl you earned it  
Girl you earned it  
  
You know our love would be tragic  
So you dont pay it dont pay it no mind  
We live with no lies  
Hey hey  
Youre my favorite kind of night  
  
Im so used to being used  
So I love when you call unexpected  
Cause I hate when the moments expected  
So Ima care for you you you  
Ima care for you you you you yeah  
Cause girl youre perfect  
Youre always worth it  
And you deserve it  
The way you work it  
Cause girl you earned it  
Girl you earned it  
  
On that lonely night  
You said it wouldnt be love  
But we felt the rush  
It made us believe it there was only us  
Convinced we were broken inside inside  
  
Im so used to being used  
So I love when you call unexpected  
Cause I hate when the moments expected  
So Ima care for you you you  
Ima care for you you you you yeah  
Cause girl youre perfect  
Youre always worth it  
And you deserve it  
The way you work it  
Cause girl you earned it
