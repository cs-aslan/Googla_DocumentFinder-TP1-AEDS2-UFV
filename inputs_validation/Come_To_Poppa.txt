Words and music by earl randle and willie mitchell  
  
If the sun  
Aint shinin bright  
And the moon the moon the moon  
Wont shine for you tonight  
If the stars in the sky gone away  
And you feel  
Feelin real low down today  
If life gets hard to understand  
And the whole thing is getting out of hand  
Come to poppa  
Come see your poppa  
  
If you need a pacifier  
Call me anytime  
Ill try to be your satisfier  
If you feel  
Like a horse  
Blazin at the bit  
Call my number  
Anytime night or day  
Ill get ya fixed  
If life gets hard to understand  
If your life is way out of hand  
Come to poppa  
Come see your poppa
