Music by elton john  
Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Available on the album too low for zero  
  
We still sit at separate tables  
And we sleep at different times  
And the warm wind in the palm trees  
Hasnt helped to change our minds  
  
It was the lure of the tropics  
That I thought might heal the scars  
Of a love burned out by silence  
In a marriage minus heart  
  
And I call the kids on the telephone  
Say theres something wrong out here  
Its july but its cold as christmas  
In the middle of the year  
  
The temperatures up to ninety five  
But theres a winter look in your mothers eyes  
And to melt the tears theres a heat wave here  
So how come its cold as christmas in the middle of the year  
  
I dreamed of love in a better climate  
And for what its really worth  
I put faith in the star we followed  
To this caribbean surf  
  
But theres an icy fringe on everything  
And I cannot find the lines  
Wheres the beauty in the beast we made  
Why the frost in the summertime
