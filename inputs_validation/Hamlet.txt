Hamlet fishin in the grave  
Thru custard bones and stuff  
He aint got no friend in there  
I believe our mans in love  
Hamlets got a gunnow  
He wears a crucifex  
Pow pow pow pow  
Hamlet moves so beautiful  
Walking thru the flowers  
Who are hing round the corners  
Hes movin down the streetnow  
He likes the look of that cadillac  
Pow pow pow pow  
Is this love some kinda love  
Now he movin down my street  
And hes coming to my house  
Crawling up my stairs  
Where for art thou babyface  
Whereforartthou  
Pow pow pow pow  
Is this love  
Pow  
He shoot it inside  
Dont letem steal your heart away  
He went and stole my heart  
Pow  
Hey hey hey  
Pow
