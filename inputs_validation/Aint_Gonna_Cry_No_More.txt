Rising with the morning sun  
I turn to greet the dawn  
Knowing I must face another day  
Sleepless night behind me  
Just a memory of pain  
My heart has always been a cross to bear  
  
Chorus  
Lord I know the sunshine  
But I feel the tears of rain  
Falling down to wash my sins away  
Ill try hard to remember  
So I wont be fooled again  
Hey aint gonna cry no more today  
  
All around me shadows fall  
Though day has just begun  
I realize Im on my own again  
Memories of broken dreams  
As distant as the sun  
Are drifting like an echo in the wind  
  
Chorus  
  
Babe I thought about it  
But it just aint done good  
You hold my heart and soul within your hand  
All the time youre in my mind  
I never thought you could be so blind  
Maybe someday I will understand  
  
Lord I know the sunshine  
But I feel the tears of rain  
Falling down to wash my sins away  
Ill try hard to remember  
So I wont be fooled again  
Hey aint gonna cry no more today no more  
  
Hey mama you drive me crazy  
Knowing youre my hearts desire  
Whyd you go and hang me up this way  
Youve given me love given me love  
Now tell me what you were thinking of  
Whyd you go and steal my soul away  
  
Chorus  
  
I aint gonna cry no more  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint gonna cry no more  
Hey I aint gonna cry no more today
