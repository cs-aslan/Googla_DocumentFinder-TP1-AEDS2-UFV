In my memory all the small things like daggers in my mind  
In my memory while my head bleeds the words Ill never find  
That I always meant to say to you I cant  
  
Cause you turned your face and now I cant feel you anymore  
Turn your face so now I cant see you anymore  
Walk away until youre not standing at my door  
Turn your face walk away and stay  
  
Turn your face hmm oh  
  
In my memory I was hurting long before we met oh  
In my memory theres still burning fingerprints you left  
And Ill always meant to say to you I cant  
  
So just turn your face until I cant see you anymore  
Turn your face until I cant see you anymore  
Walk away until youre not standing at my door  
Turn your face walk away and stay  
  
Turn your face  
  
Each time I take you back  
You bring one thousand cracks  
And I accept them like a fool oh  
  
So now whats your excuse  
What do we have to lose  
Since Im already losing you  
  
So hard to face that I cant feel you anymore  
Hard to face that I cant see you anymore  
So walk away until youre not standing at my door  
Turn your face walk away and stay  
  
Turn your face  
Turn your face and stay  
Turn your face
