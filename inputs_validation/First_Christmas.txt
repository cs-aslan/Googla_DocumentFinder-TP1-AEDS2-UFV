This day a year ago he was rolling in the snow  
With a younger brother in his fathers yard  
Christmas break a time for touching home  
The heart of all hed known  
And leaving was so hard  
  
Three thousand miles away  
Now hes working Christmas Day  
Making double time for the minding of the store  
Well he always said hed make it on his own  
Hes spending Christmas Eve alone  
First Christmas away from home  
  
Shes standing by the train station  
Panhandling for change  
Four more dollars buys a decent meal and a room  
Looks like the Sally Ann place after all  
In a crowded sleeping hall  
That echoes like a tomb  
  
But its warm and clean and free  
And there are worse places to be  
At least it means no beating from her Dad  
And if she cries because its Christmas Day  
She hopes that it wont show  
First Christmas away from home  
  
In the apartment stands a tree  
And it looks so small and bare  
Not like it was meant to be  
Golden angel on the top  
Its not that same old silver star  
You wanted for your own  
First Christmas away from home  
  
In the morning they get prayers  
Then its crafts and tea downstairs  
Then another meal back in his little room  
Hoping maybe that the boys  
Will think to phone before the day is gone  
Well its best they do it soon  
  
When the old girl passed away  
He fell apart more every day  
Each had always kept the other pretty well  
But the kids all said the nursing home was best  
Cause he couldnt live alone  
First Christmas away from home  
  
In the common room theyve got the biggest tree  
And its huge and cold and lifeless  
Not like it ought to be  
And the litup flashing Santa Claus on top  
Its not that same old silver star  
You once made for your own  
First Christmas away from home
