Why do I still write why do I still call  
Why do I still think theres hope for us at all  
These are the tings I hate but theyre the things I do to get over you  
Sunsets make me cry old pictures make me grin  
But I dont really care to see your face again  
These are the things I say but theyre so hard to do like gettin over you  
You gotta believe that theres a reason that we surrender up our hearts  
But theres a vantage point and it takes some time to find  
Where you can see how all the pieces fit as you watch em fall apart  
  
Now I dont think its right and you dont know whats wrong  
My heart keeps asking me just where do we belong  
Its not as though my life aint hard enough to do try gettin over you  
  
You gotta believe that theres a reason  
  
Now other people say stop living in the past  
But when theres nothin left its your memory that lasts  
Its later than you think but still this isnt through this gettin over you  
Now its later than you think and still this isnt through this gettin over
you
