Oh you took your sweet love from me oh you left me sweet sweet memories  
And I cry I cry like a little baby cause theres still a lot of you left in me  
Oh theres still a lot of you left in me and I cry cause your lovell set me
free  
Your lovell set me free  
Ill keep holding on to love that used to be cause theres still a lot of you
left in me  
  
Oh I still go on to all our favorite places and I still see all our friends we
used to see  
Oh but Im thinkin now Im just not the same without you  
And that theres still a lot of you left in me  
Oh theres still a lot of you  
Cause theres still a lot of you left in me
