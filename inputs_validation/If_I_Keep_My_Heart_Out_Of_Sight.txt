If I keep on talking now  
Ill only start repeating myself  
And all I can say is  
I love you I love you I love you I love you  
If I slip and tip my hand  
Im certain to scare you away  
Then what would I say  
Id be hurting Im certain  
Id be uncool to let you know  
That youre the one  
The fool who jumped the gun  
  
Cause Ive been advised  
By other guys youve left behind  
Your good byes are somewhat unrefined  
But if I play my role just right  
Tonight could be my lucky night  
And you could be mine  
If I present it to you with a flower  
In the moonlight shiny and new  
Well you couldnt say no tonight  
If I keep my heart out of sight  
  
If I play my role just right  
Tonight could be my lucky night  
And you could be mine  
If I present it to you with a flower  
In the moonlight shiny and new  
Well you couldnt say no tonight  
If I keep my heart out of sight
