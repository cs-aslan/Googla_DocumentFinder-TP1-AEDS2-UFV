Oh darling will our love be like an evergreen tree  
Stay ever green and young as the seasons go  
Your kisses could make love grow like an evergreen tree  
Bloom in the summers sun and the winters snow  
  
On every branch will blossom dreams for me and you  
Our tree of love will stay ever green if our hearts stay ever true  
  
Oh darling I love you so dont you know that Ill be  
True til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree  
  
On every branch will blossom dreams for me and you  
Our tree of love will stay ever green if our hearts stay ever true  
Oh darling I love you so dont you know that Ill be  
True til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree  
  
On the evergreen tree on the evergreen tree
