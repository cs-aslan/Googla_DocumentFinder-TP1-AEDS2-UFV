Now I dont want to lose you  
but I dont want to use you just to have somebody by my side  
And I dont want to hate you  
I dont want to take you but I dont want to be the one to cry  
And I dont really matter to anyone anymore  
But like a fool I keep losing my place and  
I keep seeing you walk through that door  
  
But theres a danger in loving somebody to much  
and its sad when you know its your heart you cant trust  
Theres a reason why people dont stay where they are  
Baby sometimes love just aint enough  
  
Now I could never change you  
I dont want to blame you  
Baby you dont have to take the fall  
Yes I may have hurt you but I did not desert you  
Maybe I just want to have it all  
It makes a sound like thunder it makes me feel like rain  
And like a fool who will never see the truth  
I keep thinking somethings gonna change  
  
But theres a danger in loving somebody to much  
and its bad when you know its your heart they cant trust  
Theres a reason why people dont stay who they are  
Baby sometimes love just aint enough  
  
And theres no way home when its late at night and youre all alone  
Are there things that you wanted to say  
And do you feel me beside you in your bed  
there beside you where I used to be  
  
But theres a danger in loving somebody to much  
and its bad when you know its your heart you cant trust  
Theres a reason why people dont stay where they are  
Baby sometimes love just aint enough
