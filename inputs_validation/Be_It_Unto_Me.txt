Chorus Be it unto me  
According to your Word  
According to your promises  
I can stand secure  
Carve upon my heart  
The truth that sets me free  
According to your Word O Lord  
Be it unto me  
  
You promised your blood will deliver  
Lord we believe its true  
You promised us joy like a river  
Lord we receive it from you  
These things you have spoken  
And youre bringing to pass  
This worlds disappearing  
But your word will last  
  
Chorus  
  
You promised to carry our sorrows  
Lord we believe its true  
You promised unending tomorrows  
Lord we receive them from you  
You be our provider  
In your word its revealed  
And by the stripes that you bore  
Lord we have been healed  
  
Chorus
