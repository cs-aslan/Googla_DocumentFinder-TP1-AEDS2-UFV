Chorus  
Weve got to Sleep on it  
Everythings gonna be alright  
If we just sleep on it  
Everythings gonna be alright  
  
Tonight there will be no more quarreling  
Well shut out the lights close our eyes  
I dont know how this started  
I dont know why we fight  
Ill apologize for all the unkind things  
I said to you  
Why cant I see whats right for me  
Might not be right for you  
  
Chorus  
  
People are gonna think  
What they what to think  
Feel what they want to feel  
I dont wanna see you cry  
I dont wanna see you compromise  
The things that shine  
The brightest in your eyes  
Hold on to your dreams  
Hold on to them tight
