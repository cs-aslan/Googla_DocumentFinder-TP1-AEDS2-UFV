Chorus  
From the South  
I got the diamonds in my mouth  
From the South  
I got the diamonds in my mouth  
From the South  
I got the diamonds in my mouth  
From the South  
I got the diamonds in my mouth  
  
Hold up a minute Im the King of the Ghetto  
Holding the rap game like wood grain cant let go  
You niggasll never see me Im on another level  
Stay ready to dig a grave keep a gun and a shovel  
And pouring gas too if there evidence  
Saw me in the rear view now you wonder where I went  
Im a get you if I owe ya visit ya residence  
Lay the merk game down and then Ima hit the fence  
Better keep my mouth closed so they cant see the shining  
They think it was ZRo cause all they seen was diamonds  
Im cold as a deep freeze with bags of ice in it  
My 357 pretty but aint nothing nice in it  
Too many bitches and not enough rubbers  
Got so many all my real niggaz under the gutter  
Watch a nigga full of life light close like shutters  
God damn staying healthy is hard as a mofucker  
  
Chorus  
  
I got diamonds all in my mouth in my grill and in my jaws  
Platinum teeth and princess cuts my mouth is similar to a disco ball  
Im Paul Wall my smile is blinding my ice is shining like a chandelier  
I tend to brush my teeth with Windex just so the glass house mouth shine
clear  
I got mo karats invested with soup Im a Texas icon a Peoples Champ  
Put on your shades when I commits to approach my mouth is eliminating like a
lamp  
It got gold grills and platinum and ice cause thats how it is in the Lone
Star State  
With a cup full of bar in a candy car and we jamming on a Robert Davis Grey
Tape  
  
Chorus  
  
Ever since 1999 I had diamonds in my grill  
You just rapping that aint platinum homie you need to chill  
Cause you embarrassing Texas nigga you aint trill  
Nigga you been on my dick way befo you got your deal  
These rappers finally get some fame and think they got it locked  
After your album flop nigga you gon be on Koch  
My gear clean from my ear rings to my pinky ring  
If you aint spend thirty tuck in your piece and chain Southside  
  
Chorus  
  
Bluckabluckablucka thats how my gun go  
If Im looking agitated bitch you better run hoe  
I use to do the baguettes but now Im VS1s though  
Princess cuts straight up and down Johnny done those  
I got loud ice just like Paul Wall  
Shining down South brighter than all yall  
When its time to get your jewelry done who do yall call  
Cause you fellas aint shining at all check me out  
On the first and fifteenth Im someing like a pimp  
Even with a suspended license still finna flip  
Aint no limit to this cash aint nothing I cant get  
Five deuce Hoover cause aint nothing like a Crip  
Ride with a Revolve I dont fuck with clips  
These roach ass niggaz trying to make me bust my chips  
But Im not a bank I dont even trust my bitch  
Im from the South and I got diamonds in my mouth  
  
From the South  
I got the diamonds in my mouth  
From the South  
I got the diamonds in my mouth  
From the South  
I got the diamonds in my mouth
