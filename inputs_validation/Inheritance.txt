Test the mend devil melt  
Bloody money when its lent  
Scum repair everywhere  
They want money oh  
  
Heavenly wont it be  
Heres some money  
Belong to thee  
I will pay they will say  
Give your money oh  
  
Obligator came and said to me  
Why dont you pay your debt  
The debt that you amend  
Asking him forgive on his demand  
For I am with a mate  
Despite in her return  
Remittance of the debt  
I cant accept  
He told me and he capped  
Quite time on his demand  
  
Imaginations came into my brain  
Cause if you patients came  
That brings me in my break  
  
Test the mend devil mend  
Bloody money when its lent  
Scum repair everywhere  
They want money oh
