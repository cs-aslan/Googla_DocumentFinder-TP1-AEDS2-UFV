Dont send me no bag dont send me no skag  
A pinheaded ho wont do  
Dont send me no square without some beehive hair  
She got to have her rhythm with blues  
  
Gotta have a prettyhead gotta have a prettyhead  
Gotta have a prettyhead I said pretty head  
  
Dont send nothin lame dont send nothin tame  
A scatterbrained ho wont do  
Dont send me no skang dont send me nothin rang  
I want it hot righteous and blue  
  
Gotta have a prettyhead gotta have a prettyhead  
Gotta have a prettyhead I said pretty head  
  
Play the guitar  
Dropdead big red icy head pretty pretty head  
Dont send me no twig dont send nothin big  
With a sideways thingamajig  
Dont send me no pro dont send nothin low  
Down and out holdin out ho  
  
Gotta have a prettyhead gotta have a prettyhead  
Gotta have a prettyhead said pretty prettyhead
