Ive been bruised and Ive been broken  
Cant believe that I put up with all this pain  
Ive been used and I was choking on the promise  
I would never fall again  
  
I used to sing to your twisted symphony  
The words that had me trapped inside your misery  
But now I know  
The reason why I couldnt breathe  
  
Chorus  
Cause all I want is everything youre not  
So go ahead and slam the door  
Cause you cant shut me out  
And no I dont I dont care what you say  
Cause all I really all I really want  
Is everything youre not  
  
Everything youre not not not  
  
Your darkness was my weakness but it turns out  
That it only went so deep  
A meaningless diversion that is all that you  
Ever meant to me  
  
And I am done with your twisted symphony  
The words that had me sound like stolen poetry  
I tore the pages and I can finally breathe  
  
Chorus  
  
I want a gentleman who treats me like a queen  
I need respect I need love  
Nothing in between  
  
I will not spell it out for you if you cant see  
Cause youre not worthy you dont deserve me  
A now Im gone  
  
Everything youre not not not  
Everything youre not not not  
  
Chorus  
  
Never gonna break my heart again  
Never gonna see your face again  
Never wanna feel this way again
