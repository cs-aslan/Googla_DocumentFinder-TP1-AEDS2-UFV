You know Im about to lose my mind  
I got a woman down below the MasonDixon line  
She deals the cards awful good to me  
Shes a blackjack dealer on the Delta Queen  
  
Chorus  
On the south side of Dixie  
From Savannah Georgia down to New Orleans  
On the south side of Dixie  
Women there they dont treat you mean  
On the south side of Dixie  
A side of the south you aint never seen  
  
Half a tank north of Birmingham  
Red eye gravy and country ham  
Chattanooga woman sure is sweet  
Shes a hillbilly singer from Tennessee  
  
Chorus  
  
If you go down south youre gonna have a ball  
Youll go half crazy tryin to love em all  
You might get lucky you cant never tell  
With them Georgia peaches and them southern belles  
  
Chorus
