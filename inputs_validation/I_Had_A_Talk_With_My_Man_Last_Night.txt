I had a talk with my man last night  
He reassured me everything was still all right  
As the night grew light  
My blues got bright  
He made me know  
I was the star of the show  
  
He said he was mine all to myself  
And i wont and he wont ever need nobody else  
He took me in his arms  
And turned on my love  
Ooh yes he did yes he did yes he did oh oh  
I had a talk with my man last night  
  
He said never again lonely would i be  
And thats when he asked to marry me  
I began to cry  
He kissed the tears from my weeping eyes  
Oh yes he did yes he did yes he did oh oh  
I had a talk with my man last night
