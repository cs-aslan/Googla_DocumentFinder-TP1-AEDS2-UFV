Feeling down n dirty feeling kinda mean  
Ive been from one to another extreme  
This time I had a good time aint got time to wait  
I want to stick around till I cant see straight  
  
Fill my eyes with that double vision no disguise for that double vision  
Ooh when it gets through to me its always new to me  
My double vision gets the best of me  
  
Never do more than I really need  
My mind is racing but my bodys in the lead  
Tonights the night Im gonna push it to the limit  
I live all of my years in a single minute  
  
Fill my eyes with that double vision no disguise for that double vision  
Ooh when it gets through to me its always new to me  
My double vision always seems to get the best of me the best of me yeah  
  
Ooh double vision I need my double vision  
It takes me out of my head takin me out of my head  
I get my double vision oh seeing double double  
Oh I have double vision yeah Im getting double vision
