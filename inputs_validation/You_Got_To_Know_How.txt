You can make me do what you wanna do  
But you got to know how  
You can make me cry you can make me sigh  
But you got to know how  
You can make me do like this you can make me do like that  
Woh baby but you got to know how  
Once a pal of mine stole a guy of mine  
But I got him back now  
Its the same old song she couldnt keep him long  
Cause she didnt know how  
Well I love my man I make him holler  
Woh my  
Yessir I really know how  
Technique aint tough if you care enough  
You can learn to know how  
I might drop a hint how to strike my flint  
If you yearn to know how  
Well dont tell me about the life you led  
Dont try to drink me into bed  
No baby no that aint the way how  
You got to take your time you know it aint no crime  
If it lasts all night  
I think youll be ideal when you begin to feel  
That youre doin right  
When you love me right you hear me holler  
Woh my  
Yessir when you really know how  
instrumental break  
And if you stay with me who knows how it will be  
When we finally know how  
Well get a house in town no need to move around  
When we really know how  
Well theres tricks that I dont even know  
Ones well make up as we go  
Woh mister when we really know how  
Yes mister when we really know how
