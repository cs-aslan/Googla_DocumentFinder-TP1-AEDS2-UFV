Now Matthew was a country boy until one day he found  
That cheatin folks was easier than plowin his daddys ground  
He left his home back in Ohio bound for Chicagos town  
He crossed Big Jim and turned his back  
  
A bullet cut him down  
And as he lay there dying  
He said Will I see my Ohio  
In my reply I lied a bit  
  
And said I did not know  
Now Jim McCall he was meek and small  
And to become a man  
Hed have to build himself up tall  
  
With fancy folks and land  
He threw some stones at honest friends  
And he got himself these things  
His children left him and he sneered  
  
Thats what my kindness brings  
And on the south side he got lost  
He asked me where to go  
In my reply I lied a bit  
  
And said I did not know  
Yes Miss Lazy Susan called me up  
She heard I stole the show  
In my reply I lied a bit  
  
And said I did not know  
In my reply I lied a bit and said I did not know
