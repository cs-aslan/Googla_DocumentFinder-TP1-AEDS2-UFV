Ive been out on this highway of heartache  
Hopin that somewhere down the line  
I could find someday who  
Could rev me like you do  
So grab onto my wheel  
And Ill be fine  
Take the keys to my heart  
And drive me crazy  
Ive been runnin on empty way too long  
Honey you got the touch  
That heats my motor up  
Take the keys to my heart  
And drive it home  
I dont know where this road is gonna lead us  
But what a beautiful night for a drive  
Baby put your mind at ease  
Drop the top and feel the breeze  
Just follow all the signs to paradise  
Take the keys to my heart  
And drive me crazy  
Ive been runnin on empty way too long  
All that work under the hood  
Sure has got it runnin good  
Take the keys to my heart  
And drive it home  
Tonight weve gonna set these wheels on fire  
And find out just how far this thing will go  
Honey we dont need no map  
Cause where we are is where its at  
Take the keys to my heart  
And drive it home  
Baby makes my motor yearn  
I love to feel that rubber burn  
Take the keys to my heart  
And drive it home  
Drive it home
