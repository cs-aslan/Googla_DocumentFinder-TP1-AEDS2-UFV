Do wop do wop   
Youve got to give youve got to live  
Youve got to show everyone that you know  
Till you know shes beside you  
Till you know shes beside you  
Youve got to shout all about  
Youve got to tell everyone that you know  
Till you know shes beside you  
Till you know shes beside you  
Cause I know just how it feels  
To find that love is real so real  
Youve got to shout all about  
Youve got to tell everyone that you know  
Till you know shes beside you  
Till you know shes beside you  
Cause I know just how it feels  
To find that love is real so real  
Youve got to give youve got to live  
Youve got to show everyone that you know  
Till you know shes beside you  
Till you know shes beside you  
Till you know shes beside you  
Till you know shes beside you  
Do wop do wop
