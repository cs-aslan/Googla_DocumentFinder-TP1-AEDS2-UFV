I know perfectly well  
Im not where I should be  
Ive been very aware  
Youve been patient with me  
  
Every time we break up  
You bring back your love to me  
And after all Ive done to you  
How can it be  
  
You still believe in me  
  
I try hard to be more  
What you want me to be  
But I cant help how I act  
When youre not here with me  
  
I try hard to be strong  
But sometimes I fail myself  
And after all Ive promised you  
So faithfully  
  
You still believe in me  
I wanna cry
