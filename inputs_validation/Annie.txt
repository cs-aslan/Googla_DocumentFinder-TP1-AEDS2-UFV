Youre a little bit shy  
A little too quiet  
Youre the mixed up girl  
That everybody leaves behind  
A little bit weird  
A little too bright  
But you just might be  
That little bomb at their side  
Theyll pull your hair  
Theyll leave you wideeyed  
But did anybody wonder  
What Annie might have in mind  
Oh no  
  
Theres something in the way she explains to me  
Please be careful I exist in someone elses head  
Oh no  
Theres something in the way that she makes believe  
Please be careful  
Annie dreams that everyone is dead  
  
Youre a little bit dry  
A little uptight  
Youre the messed up girl  
That every body tries to hide  
Youve had enough  
Theyre too unkind  
But did anyone consider  
What Annie might have in mind  
Oh no
