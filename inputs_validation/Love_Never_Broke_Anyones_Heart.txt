You say your heart has been broken  
And its taking forever to mend  
And its left you even more certain  
That youll never love again  
A long time ago someone told me  
Its not love that causes the pain  
Whenever a heart has been shattered  
Its the losing of love thats to blame  
  
Love never broke anyones heart  
It never left anyone scarred  
Its not really love if it tears you apart  
Love never broke anyones heart  
  
I know your feelings are tender  
And youre so afraid they wont heal  
Ill prove to you love doesnt hurt you  
And Ill show you how true love should feel  
  
Love never broke anyones heart  
It never left anyone scarred  
Its not really love if it tears you apart  
Love never broke anyones heart
