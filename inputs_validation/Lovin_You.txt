I have been wondring  
What Im gonna do  
While you are sleeping  
Am I sleeping too  
Well Im just sittin here lovin you  
Close my eyes and lovin you  
Oh Im just sittin back  
Sittin here lovin you  
  
If youve been wondrin  
Just what I would do  
If I werent sleeping  
Had I not found you  
Well Id be outside finding you  
Id be walkin down avenue finding you  
Oh Im just sittin here lovin you  
  
Oh the reason that you never see me runnin round  
Fingers on my forehead couldnt calm me down  
And I cant even get me up and on my feet  
I have to take care of some busness on the street  
Oh I have been walkin all my streets alone  
Id keep on walkin to keep from goin home  
I couldnt quite barely conceive of you  
Now I cant conceive of ever leavin you  
Oh Im just stittin back  
Sittin here lovin you  
  
Oh Im just sittin here lovin you  
Oh Im just sittin back  
Sittin here lovin you
