Now blue aint the word for the way that I feel  
And the storms brewing in this heart of mine  
This aint no crazy dream I know that its real  
Youre someone elses love now youre not mine  
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new  
While my yearning heart keeps saying youre not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another youll be wed  
But for now Im just lonesome all the time  
  
So take all the treasured dreams I had for you and me  
And take all the love I thought was mine  
Someday these crazy arms may hold somebody new  
But for Im just lonesome all the time  
Crazy arms that reach  
  
But for now Im just lonesome all the time
