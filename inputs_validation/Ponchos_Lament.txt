Well the stairs sound so lonely without you  
And I aint made my bed in a week  
Coffee stains on the paper Im writing  
And Im too choked up inside to speak  
  
And Yes I know our differences pulled us apart  
Never spoke a word heart to heart  
And Im glad that youre gone  
But I wish to the lord that youd come home  
And Im glad that youre gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And Im glad that youre gone  
But I wish to the lord that youd come home  
  
Well my guitar still plays your favorite song  
though the strings have been outta tune for some time  
Every time I strum a cord I pray out to the lord  
That youll quit your honkeytonkin sing my song  
And Im glad that youre gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And Im glad that youre gone  
But I wish to the lord that youd come home  
  
So Ill throw another log onto the fire  
And Ill admit Im a lousy liar  
As the coals die down and flicker  
I hear that guitar picker  
Play the song we used to sing so long ago  
Im glad that youre gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And Im glad that youre gone  
But I wish to the lord that youd come home  
And Im glad damn glad youre gone  
Got the feeling so strong  
And Im glad that youre gone  
But I wish to the lord that youd come home
