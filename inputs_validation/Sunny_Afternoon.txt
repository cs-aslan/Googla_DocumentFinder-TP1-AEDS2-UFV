In the summertime  
The taxmans taken all my dough  
And left me in my stately home  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
And I cant sail my yacht  
  
Hes taken everything Ive got  
All Ive gots this sunny afternoon  
Save me from this squeeze  
Ive got a big fat momma tryin to break me  
And I love to live so pleasantly  
  
Live this life of luxury  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
In the summertime  
In the summertime  
In the summertime everything seems fine  
  
My girlfriends gone off with my car  
And gone back to her ma and pa  
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty  
And now Im sitting here  
Sipping on my ice cold beer  
  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
Help me sail away  
Give me two good reasons why I ought to stay  
Cause I love to live so pleasantly  
  
Live this life of luxury  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
In the summertime  
Everything is fine because its the summertime  
  
In the summertime  
I dont care about a doggone thing  
In the summertime  
Im broke Ive skint but its the summertime  
In the summertime  
even though I aint got a dime in the summertime I dont have a dime  
In the summertime  
I just got this ice cold beer everything seems fine  
In the summertime  
Nothing seems to matter
