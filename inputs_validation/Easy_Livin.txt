This is a thing Ive never known before  
Its called easy livin  
This is a place Ive never seen before  
And Ive been forgiven  
  
Easy livin and Ive been forgiven  
Since youve taken your place in my heart  
  
Somewhere along the lonely road I had tried to find ya  
Day after day on that windy road I had walked behind ya  
  
Easy livin and Ive been forgiven  
Since youve taken your place in my heart  
  
Waiting watching  
Wishing my whole life away  
Dreaming thinking  
Ready for my happy day  
And some easy livin  
  
Somewhere along the lonely road I had tried to find you  
Day after day on that windy road I had walked walked behind you  
  
Easy livin and Ive been forgiven  
Since youve taken your place in my heart  
Easy livin and Ive been forgiven  
Since youve taken your place in my heart
