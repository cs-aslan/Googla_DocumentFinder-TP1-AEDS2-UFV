Leave me alone

Dont hear your knock at the door  
Im running away so dont call  
Therell be no answer today  
  
Theres no one at home

Oh therell be no one at home

So would you catch me if I fell  
When there no one listening  
To hear what happened  
When Im all on my own  
  
Leave me alone

And theres no one listening  
To hear what happened

No one at home
