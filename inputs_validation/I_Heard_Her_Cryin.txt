The whole night in the kitchen  
Saying words well both regret  
And you scream you were leaving  
And you cursed the day we met  
  
The sound goes above the slamming door  
And broken dishes thrown around the floor  
So loud it made us stop  
It was the sound of a teardrop  
  
Chorus  
When I heard her crying  
Thought she was tucked away in bed  
I heard her crying  
Wish we could take back what we said  
I didnt think she was old enough to know  
Oh Lord we must have hurt her so  
When she begged you not to go  
I heard her crying  
  
Well Id have given anything  
For time to erase  
When I turned around and saw  
Those little tears roll down her face  
  
Oh my heart nearly broke in two  
When she said  
Mommy what did I do  
To make you and daddy mad  
Oh Im sorry I was bad  
  
I looked at you and you looked at me  
And we felt each others shame  
Kneeling down to hold our child  
Said she was not to blame  
Now sometimes when were angry  
And say things that arent true  
We still love each other  
And baby we love you  
  
Chorus
