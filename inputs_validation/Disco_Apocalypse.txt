Down the side streets and the avenue  
There be sisters walkin two by two  
Their dresses and their shoes are new  
But their hearts are weary through and through  
And its a long way into the light of the day  
While the jukebox and the radio play  
  
Where the days turn into the nights  
People move into the sounds and sights  
Like the moth is drawn into the lights  
Like the tightrope walker into the heights  
Its in their hearts its in their hips  
Its in their feet its on their lips  
  
Tonights the night Im gonna make you mine  
Gonna dance right out onto the edge of time  
When the sound starts pumpin  
And the lights are flashin  
And my heartsathumpin  
And I feel the passion  
And the world is right there waiting  
At my finger tips  
Disco apocalypse  
  
In the dawn the city seems to sigh  
And the hungry hear their children cry  
People watch the time go by  
They do their jobs and live and die  
And in their dreams they rise above  
By strength or hate or luck or love  
  
Tonights the night Im gonna make you mine  
Gonna dance right out onto the edge of time  
When the world starts turnin  
And the dreams are burnin  
And the skies awaken  
Through the wind and the fire  
They will be dancing still  
  
Its in their hearts its in their hips  
Its in their feet its on their lips  
A single sound that never ends  
They die each night and live again  
  
Im gonna make you mine  
Tonights the night  
Out on the edge of time  
With the dreams of flesh and love dancing in my mind  
Dancing through the fire on the edge of time
