Christmas  
Just aint Christmas  
Without the one you love  
New Years  
Just aint New Years  
Without the one you love  
  
Underneath the mistletoe  
I saw a face all aglow  
Last year this time  
Now Im staying home alone  
And my house is not a home  
Without that girl of mine  
  
Christmas  
Just aint Christmas  
Without the one you love  
And New Years  
Just aint New Years  
Without the one you love  
  
Twelve oclock  
And all is well  
And I was doing  
Oh so swell  
Last year this time  
Goin shopping  
With friends together  
Making vows  
To leave each other  
Never  
It was a waste of time  
  
Christmas  
Just aint Christmas  
Without the one you love  
New Years  
Just aint New Years  
Without the one you love  
  
Christmas  
Just aint Christmas  
Without the one you love  
New Years  
Just aint New Years  
Without the one you love  
  
Christmas  
Just aint Christmas  
Without the one you love  
New Years  
Just aint New Years  
Without the one you love
