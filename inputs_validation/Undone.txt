Your words burn theyre melting  
What we have Im breaking down  
No reason no warning no love loss  
You might as well  
  
Take our pictures off the walls tonight  
I dont wanna see you no more  
I dont wanna feel you no more  
Take our memories throw them all aside  
I hope you finally get what you want  
Now you know  
  
I didnt wanna live without ya  
I didnt wanna love without ya  
I used to think Id die without ya  
Now its killing me  
That we can be undone  
  
I cant feel without ya  
You know I cant deal without ya  
And now I got a life without ya  
Now its killing me  
That we can be undone  
  
And this constant echoing  
In my head  
Im spinning round  
You seem so unaffected  
While I go on in this hell  
  
Take our pictures off the walls tonight  
I dont wanna see you no more  
I dont wanna feel you no more  
Take our memories throw them all aside  
I hope you finally get what you want  
Now you know  
  
I didnt wanna live without ya  
I didnt wanna love without ya  
I used to think Id die without ya  
Now its killing me  
That we can be undone  
  
I cant feel without ya  
You know I cant deal without ya  
And now I got a life without ya  
And its killing me  
That we can be undone  
  
We can be undone  
  
Youre talking now  
And Im hearin everything that you say  
And Im holding on is a real phrase  
And its dragging me along to my grave  
Its dragging me to my grave  
  
Youre talking now  
And Im hearin everything that you say  
And Im holding on is a real phrase  
And its dragging me along to my grave  
  
I didnt wanna live without ya  
I didnt wanna love without ya  
I used to think Id die without ya  
Now its killing me  
That we can be undone  
  
I cant feel without you  
You know I cant deal without you  
And now I got a life without you and its killing me  
That we could be undone  
  
I didnt wanna live without ya  
I didnt wanna love with ya  
I used to think Id die without ya  
Now its killing me  
That we can be undone  
  
I cant feel without you  
You know I cant deal without you  
And now I got a life without you and its killing me  
That we could be undone
