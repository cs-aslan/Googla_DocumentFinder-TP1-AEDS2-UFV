If you want to see me  
Dont break down and cry  
I can be your sweetie  
If you be a friend of mine  
And I wont be forsaken  
If you think thoughts unkind  
Just bring home the bacon  
And bring it home on time  
  
Hey Louie cant you see  
I couldnt leave you if I tried  
Hey Louie listen to me  
We got a thing so dignified  
It dont matter if we lived in a shack  
Or in a shiny cadillac  
It dont matter rich or poor  
When love is knocking at your door  
  
It feels like Christmas  
Just like Christmas  
It feels like Christmas with you  
  
Hey Louie life is sweet  
I cant be bitter  
When youre here with me  
Hey Louie no regrets  
Holding on to things  
That you ought to forget  
Well it doesnt matter tit for tat  
Cause what you give  
You get it back  
It dont matter anymore  
When love is knocking at your door  
  
It feels like Christmas  
Just like Christmas  
It feels like Christmas with you  
Everytime I see ya  
Everytime I hear ya  
Everytime Im near ya  
Id be happy  
Because it feels like Christmas  
Just like Christmas  
It feels like Christmas  
With you
