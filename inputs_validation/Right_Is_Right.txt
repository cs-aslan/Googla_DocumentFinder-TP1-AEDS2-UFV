Running to fight  
Spirit in the night  
Like a dog to bite  
Everything in sight  
Give me love you say  
Theres a price you have to pay  
With mommas life you cannot play  
Make things right you need to be saying  
Right is right wrong is wrong  
Right is right wrong is wrong  
  
Fists come to town  
Blood on the ground  
Mommas crying Lord have mercy   
Mercys hard to find  
Its just a state of mind  
Drop the get out the way  
We dont have another day  
  
Right is right wrong is wrong  
Right is right wrong is wrong  
  
He said hes comng by five my friend  
And I desire to live again  
If you hear me let me know woa woa woa woa  
  
Right is right wrong is wrong three times  
  
He said hes coming by five my friend  
And I desire to live again  
If you here me let me know  
The world is full of woa
