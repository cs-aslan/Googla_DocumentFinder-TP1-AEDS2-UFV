I cant give you more I cant give you more  
Ill never find what I am searching for  
  
Oh I know that I will die for you  
Cant you see my deep emotions  
Tears may go but Im lonely too  
My love is just like the ocean  
Oh please come back to me  
Cause I wont die girl for nothing  
Oh your not blind to see  
Oh I wont die girl for nothing  
  
I cant give you more I cant give you more  
Ill never find what I am searching for  
I cant give you more I cant give you more  
Theres no one else this love you cant ignore
