If this is heaven then Im in hell  
If trust is misfortune then wish me well  
  
While I think of sadness baby  
Your light shines through  
Your light shines through  
Your light shines through  
  
Chorus  
Because its beggars day  
Because its beggars day  
Because its beggars day  
  
Ive lost control of my darker side  
A world all for free on a nastier ride  
  
And I have crossed myself in anger  
All your mercy cant save me  
All your mercy cant save me  
All your mercy cant save me  
  
Because its beggars day  
Because its beggars day  
Because its beggars day  
  
Its beggars day  
You know its beggars day  
Because its beggars day  
  
See this love Ive stored for you  
Wheel it and deal it but our feelings are true  
  
And I have crossed myself in anger  
All your mercy cant save me  
All your mercy cant save me  
All your mercy cant save me
