If you hear somebody knockin on your door  
If you see somebody crawlin across the floor  
Baby itll be me  
Yeah Ill be lookin for you  
Well if you see somebody climbin up a telegraph pole  
If you find a new lump in your sugar bowl  
Baby itll be me  
Yeah Ill be lookin for you  
Im gonna search in the mountains  
Down in the deep blue sea  
Im gonna search the country side  
And look and look in every tree  
If you find a new bait on your fishin hook  
And if you find a funny face in your comic book  
Baby itll be me  
Yeah Ill be lookin for you  
Im gonna look in the city  
Where the lights are blue  
Gonna search in the forest  
And the haystacks too  
If you see something shootin out across the stars  
If you see a rocket ship on its way to Mars  
Baby itll be me  
Yeah Ill be lookin for you  
Yeah Ill be lookin for you  
Ill be lookin for you
