Bad and beautiful  
  
Hooray for Mr Wonderful  
Hes feeling bad and beautiful  
Ive seen him hanging out in the strangest places  
Jiving in the dives where well fed faces go  
He looks so good yeah he talks so fine  
Feeling bad and beautiful  
Hes grown to be a legend in his own time  
You can find him most of the time  
Want only carousing after hours  
Swimming in his winning and his gin  
Dont you wish that you could be like him  
Oh bless him in his arrogance  
Doesnt ever miss a chance  
To vow you with his line of invitations  
Never giving into limitations no  
He talks so good yeah he looks so fine  
Feeling bad and beautiful  
Hes grown to be a legend in his own time oh oh  
  
Hey have you seen People Magazine  
Hes smiling on the cover bright as day  
Well no telling where he goes from here  
Maybe hell just up and fly away  
  
Hooray for Mr Wonderful
