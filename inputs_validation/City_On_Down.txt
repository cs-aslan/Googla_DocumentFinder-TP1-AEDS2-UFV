Well in the end my friend  
We will all be together again  
Clutching onto my hand  
In a valley well stand  
Just living again  
And in a while well smile  
March on another mile  
On hallowed hills attached to  
The land well be still  
  
No ones ever gonna say a thing  
And well be together together again  
Taking off to the city on down  
Just a while ago my soul was confused  
Amused at what it did not know  
  
Days went by  
And amusement cried  
I decide to let  
My soul fly on by itself  
Pick happiness up and  
Bring it back to the shelf  
Well be okay one day  
In a valley we will stay  
  
No more moving on  
I knew it was right here all along  
Wont have to hold your crown  
No more looking around  
Just holding you tight in the city on down  
Just a while ago my soul was confused  
Amused at what it did not know  
  
But days went by and amusement cried  
I decide its time I got to move on now  
But I was so scared  
I was frightened  
Somewhat enlightened  
So I changed shoes  
  
Now I walk through a valley of color  
Much better than the other  
Way I did not know  
But now we can be united  
Miracle miracle sighted  
And Im pulling it in  
I know by now we can all walk together  
At a regular speed  
  
Do you dare to be excited  
Are you somewhat delighted  
Are you aware somewhat delighted  
At what you did not know  
Lets take it to the city on down
