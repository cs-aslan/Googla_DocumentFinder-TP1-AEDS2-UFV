Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings  
Where the mummified Pharaohs  
Pretend dead in their sleep  
Dont touch never ever steal  
Unless youre in for the kill  
Or youll be hit by the curse of the Pharaohs  
Yes youll be hit and the curse is on you  
Now if youre breakin the seals  
And disturbing the peace  
Then youre startin up a curse  
Bringin evil disease  
Dont touch never ever steal  
Unless youre in for the kill  
Or youll be hit by the curse of the Pharaohs  
Yes youll be hit and the curse is on you  
The curse of the Pharaohs can be so deadly  
Or just destroying your future  
Takin it all shady  
Dont touch never ever steal  
Unless youre in for the kill  
Or youll be hit by the curse of the Pharaohs  
Yes youll be hit and the curse is on you
