A thought that never changes  
Remains a stupid lie  
Its never been quite the same  
No hearing or breathing  
No movement no colors  
Just silence  
  
Rise and fall of shame  
A search that shall remain  
We asked you what youd seen  
You said you didnt care  
  
Sound formed in a vacuum  
May seem a waste of time  
Its always been just the same  
No hearing or breathing  
No movement no lyrics  
Just nothing  
  
The sign that leads the way  
The path we can not take  
Youve caught me at a bad time  
So why dont you piss off
