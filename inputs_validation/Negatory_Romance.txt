Hes wantin her more than hes wantin his wife  
Buddy thats a good way to screw up your life  
He sneaks off to see her when he gets a chance  
Thats a perfect example of a negatory romance  
Sneakin in the back door that aint no 104 its a negatory romance  
Its a real breaker maker when your heart is a taker its a negatory romance  
Now girl dont go chasin a man who aint free  
You know there are plenty of fish in the sea  
So girl dont go chasin whatever wears pants  
Thats another example of a negatory romance  
Sneakin in the back door  
Slippin around on the back streets of life  
Changin your handle for one cheatin night  
Slidin off your gold band just so you can dance  
Thats another example of a negatory romance  
Sneakin in the back door
