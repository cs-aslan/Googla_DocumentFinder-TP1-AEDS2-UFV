Its takes a lot to get to the top  
And a little just to fall off quick  
And I think Ive seen you here before  
  
Sometimes you fly so high  
So fast it makes you sick  
You won the battle lost the war  
  
But I dont mind if you say  
Every time you talk to me  
Every time we talk  
  
Chorus  
We came we saw  
We conquered and crumbled  
In our own true way  
We loved we fought  
We rocked and we tumbled  
In our own true way  
  
Well I believe in brotherhood  
And the good of all mankind  
Though I admit its hard to find  
  
But if you want to talk just come and knock  
It dont matter what the time  
Solitude is no friend of mine  
  
And I dont mind if you say  
Every time you talk to me  
Every time we talk  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont mind  
Its hard to be from a rock in the sea  
Livin in a big steel town  
Finding unfamiliar faces all around  
  
You heard em tell stupid jokes  
You heard em laugh every time you spoke  
But you dont let nobody put you down  
  
But I dont mind if you say  
Every time you talk to me  
Every time you talk to me  
Every time we talk  
  
Chorus  
  
In our own true way  
And I dont mind  
If you say
