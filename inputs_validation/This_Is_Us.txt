Got a million reasons to run and hide  
I dont blame you for being scared for being scared no  
Bout a novel long all the pain that hes caused you  
  
Baby Im fully aware Im fully aware  
If I could change the stories ending to me and you  
Dont know the meaning of pretending what to do  
  
Chorus  
I could be the one  
Give you all my love  
Forget what he has done to you  
Im here now  
Open up to me  
Love will set you free  
If ever you believe then  
Please believe in me  
This is us  
This is us  
This is us  
This is us  
This is love  
This is love  
Let the world know baby  
This is us  
This is us  
This is us  
This is us  
This is love  
This is love  
Let the world know baby this is us  
  
I know everything isnt meant to last  
Box up all those photographs  
Your moving on yeah  
I could flip back over that hour glass  
And refill the better half the better half  
  
And its a miracle how broken hearts can mend  
Wont you dry up all those tear drops and start again  
  
Chorus  
  
If I could show you theres no risk of being left alone  
Would you let your past go  
Ill take it slow  
Cause theres no need to rush when I know
