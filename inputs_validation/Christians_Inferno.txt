I got under the grip  
Between this modern hell  
I got the rejection letter in the mail and  
It was already ripped to shreds  
Seasons in a ruin and  
This bitter pill is chased with blood  
Theres fire in my veins  
And its pouring out like a flood  
  
Woah Christians inferno  
Woah Christians inferno  
Woah Christians inferno  
Woah Christians inferno  
  
This diabolic state is gracing my existence  
Like a catastrophic baby  
Maybe maybe youre the chemical reaction  
I am the atom bomb  
I am the chosen one  
Toxin your reservoir  
And then return man to ape  
  
Woah Christians inferno  
Woah Christians inferno  
Woah Christians inferno  
Woah Christians inferno
