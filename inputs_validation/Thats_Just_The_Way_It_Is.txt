All day long he was fighting for you  
And he didnt even know your name  
Young men come and young men go  
But life goes on just the same  
  
And I dont know why  
Why do we keep holding on  
I dont know why  
Pretending to be oh so strong  
Oh why  
Is there something I dont know  
Or something very wrong with you and me  
Or maybe  
  
Thats the way it is theres nothing I can do  
Thats just the way it is  
  
Theyve been waiting for word to come down  
Theyve been waiting for you night and day  
They wont wait any longer for you  
It may already be too late  
  
And I dont know why  
  
You see the dying you feel the pain  
What have you got to say  
If we agree that we can disagree  
We could stop all of this today  
  
Its been your life for as long as you can remember  
But you cannot fight no more  
You must want to look your son in the eyes  
When he asks you what you did it for  
  
Cos all day long he was fighting for you  
And he didnt even know your name  
Young men come and young men go  
But life goes on just the same  
  
I dont know why
