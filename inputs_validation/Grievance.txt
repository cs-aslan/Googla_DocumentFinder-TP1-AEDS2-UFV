Have a drink theyre buying  
Bottom of bottle of denial  
  
Big guy big eye watching me  
Have to wonder what it sees  
Progress laced with ramifications  
Freedoms big plunge  
  
Pull the innocent from a crowd  
Raise the sticks then bring em down   
If they fail to obey  
If they fail to obey  
  
For every tool they lend us a loss of independence  
  
I pledge to my grievance to the flag  
Cause you dont give blood then take it back again  
Were deserving of much more  
  
Progress taste it investitall  
Champagne breakfast for everyone  
  
Break the innocent when theyre proud  
Raise the stakes then bring em down  
If they fail to obey  
If they fail to obey  
  
Pledge my grievance to the flag  
Aw come on dont give blood then take it back again  
Were all deserving something more  
  
I want to breathe part of the seen  
I want to taste everyone I see  
I want to run when Im up high  
I want to run to the sea  
I only want life to be  
I just want to be  
I will feel alive as long as I am free
