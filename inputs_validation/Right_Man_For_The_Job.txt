I hope your new mans good for you in bed  
Better than this whiskydrinking slob  
A weekend in Vienna a boat trip on the Med  
I hope youve found the right man for the job  
  
Oh hes fine hes just fine  
He loves me just like you loved your wine  
When it comes to other women I bet he doesnt touch a drop  
I think youve found the right man for the job  
  
Chorus  
Heres to then and cheers  
Thanks for the friendship youve given these years  
Heres to him and cheers  
Hes given me some happiness where you just gave tears  
He must have a big yacht  
A nose in the air cant be all that hes got  
A good head on his shoulders isnt everything hes got  
I think Ive found the right man for the job  
I thank you for the toffees that you gave  
And thank you for the flowers that didnt arrive  
I sent you a bouquet but I sent it to your grave  
I didnt think that you were still alive  
  
Oh hes fine hes still fine  
He likes to wine and dine and actually dine  
His roses are regular his kisses on the dot  
I think Ive found the right man for the job  
  
Chorus  
  
Youll be pleased to hear Ive found a new romance  
Let me introduce you to my friends  
Seven gins for seven tonics begin a merry dance  
Were out every night til nighttime ends
