Ill die smiling  
Something the past  
Someone says to me will make me laugh  
And Ill lay back and fade away  
  
Chorus  
Let me go Ill be fine  
Frozen here in time  
Sick of being alive  
Eaten up inside  
Let me die go away  
I never got what I wanted I never got what I needed  
Whats on my mind  
Who can say  
Its my invention Im beating  
I cannot stop all this bleeding  
  
Ill be ready  
Give me the morphine and Ill go to sleep  
As I dream maybe I will just slide away  
  
Chorus  
  
Eaten up inside  
Let me die go away  
I never got what I wanted I never got what I needed  
Whats on my mind  
Who can say  
Its my infection Im feeding  
I cannot stop all this bleeding  
  
Eaten eaten inside  
Eaten eaten inside  
Eaten eaten inside  
Eaten eaten inside  
  
Eaten up inside
