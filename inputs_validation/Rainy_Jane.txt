With a cloud above her head  
Here comes rainy Jane  
If she stops you man shell bore you  
With that sad refrain  
Its the same old story  
Weve heard a thousand times before  
Shell tell you how he broke her heart  
And then the tears will start to pour  
  
Hey rainy Jane  
You gotta stop your crying sometime  
Come on rainy Jane  
Its up to you to make your own sweet sunshine  
  
Jane youre just a shadow of  
The girl you used to be  
Once you used to live for life  
And now you live for sympathy  
True your hearts been broken  
And you got the right to cry  
But if youre gonna keep it up  
The sunshines gonna pass you by  
  
Hey rainy Jane  
You gotta stop your crying sometime  
Come on rainy Jane  
Its up to you to make your own sweet sunshine  
  
You can change the weather  
No one loves a rainy day  
Come lets get together  
Clouds will clear up when you cheer up  
Take each raindrop make the rain stop  
  
Hey rainy Jane  
You gotta stop your crying sometime  
Come on rainy Jane  
Its up to you to make your own sweet sunshine
