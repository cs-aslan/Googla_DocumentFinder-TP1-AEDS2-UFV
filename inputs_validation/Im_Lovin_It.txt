Yo  
Hi Im not here to waste your time  
You know this aint a pick up line  
I just think that youre a dime  
Well dont just sit there girl  
  
Well I know that heart thats in your chest  
It carries pain and so must stress  
But you got to let it go  
Go go girl  
Just close your eyes Ill grab your waist  
Next think you know you have your pace  
Girl you got to let it go  
Go go girl  
  
I know that you want to get down  
You do deserve to get down  
Been working hard all week  
Just trying to make your money  
Girl go on and shake your booty

By the way whats your sign  
I bet it is compatible with mine  
Probably long lasting years down the line  
Im telling you girl youre a dime  
Well dont just sit there girl  
  
I know that heart thats in your chest  
It carries pain and so must stress  
But you got to let it go  
Go go girl  
Just let go  
Just close your eyes Ill grab your waist  
Next think you know you have your pace  
Girl you got to let it go  
Go go girl
