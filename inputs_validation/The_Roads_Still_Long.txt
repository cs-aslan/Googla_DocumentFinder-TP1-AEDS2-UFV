Growing up as a young boy  
Sometimes can be rough  
At six years old I was thinkin  
Seven would be just enough  
But I was wrong  
Ooh I was wrong yeah  
Ten years old and Im growin  
Thinkin I got it sussed  
Mama said youll be a fine young man  
I thought I already was  
But I was wrong  
Ooh I was wrong  
Cause when you get where youre going  
The roads still long  
Eighteen years Im a rebel  
Thinkin Im pretty tough  
Daddy said you got a lot to learn  
I thought that Id learned enough  
But I was wrong  
Ooh I was wrong yeah  
Twentyfive was a good time  
Comin into my own  
Climbed the mountain and I reached for the sky  
I thought that I had it all  
But I was wrong  
Ooh I was wrong  
Cause when you get where youre going  
The roads still long  
The roads still long  
When you get where youre going  
The roads still long  
The roads still long  
They all try to tell you but who are they to say  
Cause the best things that you learn you find out on your way  
No time for feelin sorry just time for being strong  
When you get where your going  
The roads still long  
Now I see where I come from  
Now I see where I am  
Now I see that you never really know  
So you just gotta do the best you can  
That aint wrong  
Ooh that aint wrong no  
Cause when you get where youre going  
The roads still long  
The roads still long  
When you get where youre going  
The roads still long  
The roads still long  
When you get where youre going yeah
