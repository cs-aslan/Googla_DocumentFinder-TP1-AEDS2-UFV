In a flash Ill change the universe or at least the world  
I knew Im so sick and tired of watching those who say  
And never do youre right and this waiting seems to last  
For hours as I wait impatiently and its hard to find  
The strength inside to be who I should be youre right  
  
Why should I believe the words youre telling me are true  
It doesnt seem like anybody feels the way I do Im not  
Too proud to say when I was wrong everyone hates a knowitall  
So I thought Id change the universe and the world I  
Thought I knew but it seems that change is relative to  
What we believe is true youre right
