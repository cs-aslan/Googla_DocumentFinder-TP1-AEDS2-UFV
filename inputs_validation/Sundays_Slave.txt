Sundays got a slave  
Mondays got one too  
Sundays got a slave  
Mondays got one too  
Our sufferings are countless  
Our pleasures are motley few  
Spend all day digging my grave  
Now go get Sundays slave  
  
Tuesday sleeps in a stable  
Wednesdays in a chains  
Tuesday gathers up the crumbs under the table  
Wednesday dare not complain  
My heart has collapsed on the tracks of a runaway train  
Just whisper his name  
And here comes Sundays slave  
  
The hands in the stable are willing and able to pay  
If you feel at a loss man just who is the bossman  
Ask the blood of one of its bad days  
For his nerve is to serve but the sevice is a mockery  
He insists that he piss in your fist  
But he still takes the money anyway  
The masters a bastard  
But dont tell Sundays slave  
  
Thursdays angered the master  
O K So Fridays gonna pay  
Thursdays angered the master  
Yeah so Fridays gonna pay  
One night on the rack and hes back saddling up Saturday  
You can only whisper his name  
But not on Sundays  
Never on Sundays  
O Not on Sundays slave
