Gonna throw down the dice on a roll its a showdown gonna walk on hot coals  
Cut the deck better place your bet cause the game aint over yet  
  
Want to keep you under lock and key cant you see what you do to me  
Get the noose I know Im gonna hang cause youre like a boomerang
boomerang  
  
On the way up you change your tune so pay up and it aint too soon  
Cant make up or break up cant feel a thing you want a piece of everything  
  
First youre cold and then youre hot youre in the mood and then youre not  
Yeah I know Ill get a bang cause youre like a boomerang boomerang  
  
You can slip and you can slide but there aint nothin you can hide  
You just cant say no well here I come baby and here I go  
  
A boomerang a boomerang
