In love with myself  
In love with my own reflection  
With my own affection  
With the vision that i see  
  
Theres nobody else  
Im taking my own direction  
I can see perfection  
Doing all i can for me  
  
In love with myself  
  
I can take you to hell  
Im falling so deep inside it  
And i just cant hide it  
Feel it burning down on me  
  
I dance with myself  
As hundreds of eyes are waiting  
Cant strip completely  
And the lights are burning me  
  
In love with myself  
  
Tonight Im gonna meet somebody  
After all the lights have died  
Im still living  
But what am i giving  
  
In love with myself  
In love with my own reflection  
With my own affection  
With the vision that i see  
  
Theres nobody else  
Im taking my own direction  
I can see perfection  
Doing all i can for me  
  
In love with myself  
  
Everybody wants your body  
Theres nobody who can  
Take you to heaven  
Well make it forever  
  
Tonight Im gonna meet somebody  
After all the lights have died  
Im still living  
But what am i giving
