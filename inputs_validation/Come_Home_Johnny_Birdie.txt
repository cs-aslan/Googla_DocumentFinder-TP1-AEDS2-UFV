I left the only folks I had known  
I was fifteen then  hardly grown  
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud  
Couldnt get back and I couldnt go far  
Said to myself stay right where you are  
Done found yourself a Ma and Pa  
Evrybody said the kids no good  
  
Come Home Johnny Bride come home  
Johnny Bride come home  
Were all wrong without you  
How did we ever doubt you  
He confessed to the killing  
Its his role we had you filling  
We didnt really mean to make you sad  
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad
