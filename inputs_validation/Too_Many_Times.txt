Who do I hope to finally Be  
Is it not your life in me  
Yet the hows too hard to see  
Too many times  
  
Will I ever finally be  
The true intended me  
Will the old in me be freed  
And left behind  
  
Chorus  
Too many times  
Im back inside  
Wanting desperately to hide  
Yet I know I know you say  
You have to die  
Too many times  
You hear my cries  
Im at the end of all my tries  
So Im open Lord so  
Teach me how to die  
  
Here I am again alone  
Afraid Ill lose all that I own  
Yet you see me as your own  
I cannot fall  
  
And what I am I still am not  
At times I count the cost  
Yet I find theres nothing lost  
If I give it all
