Lay my head on the surgeons table  
Take my fingerprints if you are able  
Pick my brains pick my pockets  
Steal my eyeballs and come back for the sockets  
Run every kind of test from a to z  
And youll still know nothin bout me  
Run my name through your computer  
Mention me in passing to your college tutor  
Check my records check my facts  
Check if I paid my income tax  
Pore over everything in my cv  
But youll still know nothin bout me  
Youll still know nothin bout me  
You dont need to read no books on my history  
Im a simple man its no big mystery  
In the cold weather a hand needs a glove  
At times like this a lonely man like me needs love  
Search my house with a fine tooth comb  
Turn over everything cause I wont be home  
Set up your microscope and tell me what you see  
Youll still know nothin bout me  
Youll still know nothin bout me  
Youll still know nothin bout me etc  
Youll still know zip about me
