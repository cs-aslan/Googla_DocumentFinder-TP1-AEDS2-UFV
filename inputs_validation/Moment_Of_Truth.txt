Dont expect me to treat you like a lady  
I may not always show respect  
Its too soon yet I hardly even know you  
Thats just my way dont get upset Incomprehensible  
Uptill now Ive been living like a loner  
Gettin by ooh just gettin by  
And this heart of mine has only had one owner  
But you could change that if you tried baby  
Now I dont want a love forever  
And I dont need a master plan  
I just want to come together  
And I want you to understand  
Its the moment of truth and its finally come this time  
Now we must draw the line  
The moment of truth this time its everything  
Open up let me in let me right into your heart oh yeah  
I intend to treat you like a woman  
Cause I can see youre not a child  
Cause youve got that look that certain way of knowin  
Its got my senses runnin wild oh yeah  
Now I dont want a love forever  
And I dont need a master plan  
I just want to come together  
And I want you to understand  
Its the moment of truth and its finally come this time  
Now we must draw the line  
The moment of truth this time its everything  
Open up let me in  
The moment of truth and its finally come this time  
Now we must draw the line the moment of truth this time  
Now I dont want a love forever  
And I dont need a master plan  
I just want to come together  
And I want you to understand  
Its the moment of truth and its finally come this time  
Now we must draw the line  
The moment of truth this time its everything  
Open up let me in  
The moment of truth oh
