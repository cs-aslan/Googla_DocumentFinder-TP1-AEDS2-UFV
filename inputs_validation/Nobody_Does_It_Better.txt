Nobody does it better  
Makes me feel sad for the rest  
Nobody does it half as good as you  
Baby youre the best  
  
I wasnt lookin but somehow you found me  
It tried to hide from your love light  
But like heaven above me  
The spy who loved me  
Is keepin all my secrets safe tonight  
  
And nobody does it better  
Though sometimes I wish someone could  
Nobody does it quite the way you do  
Whyd you have to be so good  
  
The way that you hold me  
Whenever you hold me  
Theres some kind of magic inside you  
That keeps me from runnin  
But just keep it comin  
Howd you learn to do the things you do  
  
Oh and nobody does it better  
Makes me feel sad for the rest  
Nobody does it half as good as you  
Baby baby darlin youre the best  
  
Baby youre the best  
Darlin youre the best  
Baby youre the best
