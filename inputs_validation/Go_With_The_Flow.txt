She said Ill throw myself away  
Theyre just photos after all  
I cant make you hang around  
I cant wash you off my skin  
Outside the frame is what were leaving out  
You wont remember anyway  
I can go with the flow  
But dont say it doesnt matter anymore  
I can go with the flow  
Do you believe it in your head  
Its so safe to play along  
Little soldiers in a row  
Falling in and out of love  
With something sweet to throw away  
But I want something good to die for  
To make it beautiful to live  
I want a new mistake lose is more than hesitate  
Do you believe it in your head  
I can go with the flow  
But dont say it doesnt matter anymore  
I can go with the flow  
Do you believe it in your head
