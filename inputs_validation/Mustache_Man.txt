Launching loony thoughts into the bending of your mind  
You reach for something high but its a mountain that you find  
Hes a king dust demon with an icepick smile  
His music fills your feathers as you feel your passions fly  
  
With the mustache man on the carpet of his van  
You can feel your fatty tissues giving way to sweaty hands  
And the woofers keep distorting and the tweeters kiss the girls  
His hornrimmed glasses lights a square beneath his curls  
  
I have wasted so much time  
I have wasted so much time  
  
He is like a politician who is practicing a speech  
He is racing he is pacing he is sleeping on his beat  
As the sky begins to darken and the waves begin to roll  
  
You can feel the oceans rising as youre losing all control  
  
And meanwhile back at the Candlerock Lounge  
It is past 11 30 and your friends are getting down  
Theyre applying purple eyeshadow drinking warm beer  
Theyre wondering where you went to when you told them youd be here  
  
I have wasted so much time  
I have wasted so much time  
  
I have wasted so much time  
I have wasted so much time
