Hm  
  
Let me tell you something  
Never have I ever been a size ten in my whole life  
I left the engine running  
I just came to see  
What you would do if I gave you a chance to make things right  
So made it even though Katie told me that this will be nothing but  
A waste of time  
And she was right  
Um  
Dont understand it but its blood on your hands  
Is still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies  
And I just dont know why  
Oh

Im not stupid  
Dont talk to me  
Like Im stupid  
I still love you but  
I just cant do this  
I maybe dumb but  
Im not stupid  
  
My new nickname is you idiot such an idiot um  
Thats what my friends are calling me  
When they see me I leann to my phone  
Theyre telling me let go  
He is not the one  
I thought I saw your potential  
I guess thats what made me dumb  
  
He dont want it  
Not like you want it  
Scheming and cheating  
Oh girl why do you waste your time  
You know he aint right  
Theyre telling me this  
I dont wanna listen but you insist  
On repeatedly trying to tell me lies  
And I just dont know why

Dont talk to me  
Like Im stupid  
I still love you but  
I just cant do this  
I maybe dumb but  
Im not stupid  
  
Trying to make this work  
But you act like a jerk  
Silly of me to keep holding on  
Oh  
But the dunst cap is off  
You dont know what youve lost  
And you wont realize till  
Im gone gone gone  
That I was the one  
Which one of us is really dumb
