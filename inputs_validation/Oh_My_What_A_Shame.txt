They were married in the old Church yard  
And they promised to be true to each other  
No matter how hard their lives might be  
But like meteors that fell through moments parallel  
They were soon to cross  
And on different plots of earth they both did fall  
Though their lives had really not been hard at all  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh my what a shame  
No ones to blame  
It just happened that way  
And theres nothing you can say  
When two people say goodbye  
Oh my  
  
Two brothers promised theyd return  
When the war that they were fighting was over  
But only one lived to keep his vow  
And the story I was told said he lived to be quite old  
Before time won out  
Someone asked if he knew what they both fought for  
But he could not recall he had ever been to war  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
  
For theres nothing you can say when its over  
And theres nothing you can do when its done  
Theres no battle you can win  
And theres nothing to begin  
Thats not begun  
  
On this moment I recall your face  
And I wonder if you still think about me  
Occasionally I still think of you  
And I watch the river flow and I know I must let go  
But its oh so hard  
For the waves are all around my small canoe  
I had always hoped this boat could carry two  
  
Chorus
