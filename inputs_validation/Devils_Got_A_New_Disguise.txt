If you see Kay you got to revel  
No angel wings more like the devil  
She was so hot so cool and nasty  
Believe it or not heres what she asked me  
If you need love with no condition  
Lets Do the Do honey Im on a mission  
  
Aint no mistakin my bodys shakin  
My souls been taken  
By a Devil with a New Disguise  
The girls so witchin my backbones twitchin  
Cause down in Hells kitchen  
The Devils got a New Disguise  
  
If you see Kay tell her I love her  
She did me in but Ill recover  
She said love was her desire  
All that she touched she set on fire  
She was so diss I couldnt slay her  
She blew a kiss I threw the dagger  
  
Aint no mistakin my bodys shakin  
My souls been taken  
By a Devil with a New Disguise  
The girls so witchin my backbones twitchin  
Cause down in Hells kitchen  
The Devils got a New Disguise  
  
She came from the wrong side of town  
Every time she got off she gets knocked back down  
Shes Heaven materialized  
Shes givin me Hell but it aint no surprise  
Shes a bit uncivilized
