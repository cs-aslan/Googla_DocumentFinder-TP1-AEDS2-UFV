Seems like our love is on a road to nowhere fast  
All my life I thought a love like this would last  
But every road can hide a corner we cant see  
I had a vision that I woke up by your side  
I felt you breathing and our souls were intertwined  
But who controls loves destiny Not me  
  
We had it all right in our hands  
We had the space to fly and still a place to land  
  
So Im calling out Im calling out to the only one  
Who can save us from what weve done  
Dont leave me hanging on  
Im reaching out and praying youll come back again  
Its just darkness Im living in  
And youre the only place my heart has ever been  
  
Maybe Im young and in the ways of love naive  
Maybe Im desperate for a reason to believe  
There wasnt any way I thought that we would fall  
Ive seen perfection in a rainbow in the sky  
Ive seen a child make the coldest grown man cry  
But loving you I thought was greater than them all  
  
We had it all just you and me  
Now theres a doorway to my heart without a key  
  
So Im calling out Im calling out to the only one  
Who can save us from what weve done  
Dont leave me hanging on  
Im reaching out and praying youll come back again  
Its just darkness Im living in  
And youre the only place my heart has ever been  
  
Wherever you are right now  
Come back and show me how you feel  
Becasue Im lost without you here  
  
Calling out Im calling out to the only one  
Who can save us from what weve done  
Dont leave me hanging on  
And Im reaching out and praying youll coem back again  
Its just darkness Im living in  
Cause youre the only place my heart has ever been
