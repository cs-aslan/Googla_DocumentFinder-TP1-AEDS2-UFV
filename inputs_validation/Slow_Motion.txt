Slow motion slow motion baby  
We want our love to last  
Everythings so right why try to go so fast  
Its easy to lose sight  
And then the moments passed  
  
Go easy go easy baby  
You know theres time for us  
Even though this world seems to be speeding up  
Maybe we can try to slow things down  
  
Because we need to draw the line  
Because we need to make the time  
Because we need to sip the wine  
  
Because the clock is running  
And its going so fast  
The futures coming but its soon the past  
Its here today and theres no turning back  
  
Go lightly go lightly baby  
In time well find a way  
Its never over till its over  
Why rush it through  
Never pausing to admire the view  
  
Slow motion well if we get tired  
Then we can rest awhile  
If were gonna go were gonna go in style  
Isnt that what life is all about
