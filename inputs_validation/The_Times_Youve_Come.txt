In the time weve known  
That we each are a part of one another  
Weve lost as much as we have won  
And as our lives have grown  
We have found that it only brings us pain  
That hangs on to the things that we have done  
Still I love the times youve come  
  
When you went away  
Taking all that Id built my false road on  
I dropped my life and couldnt find the pieces  
Now you come and go  
And its hard but I feel my strength returning  
Well see how far this new road reaches  
Well see a little more each time we come  
  
Now everybodys gonna tell you its not worth it  
Everybodys gotta show you their own thing  
You might try to find your way up around it  
But the need for love will still remain  
  
Now were lying here  
So safe in the ruins of our pleasures  
Laughter marks the place where we have fallen  
And our lives are near  
So it wouldnt occur to us to wonder  
Is this the past or the future that is calling  
  
You know Ive loved these times youve come
