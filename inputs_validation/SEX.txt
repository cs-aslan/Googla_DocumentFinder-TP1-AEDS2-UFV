No is a dirty word   
Never gonna say it first  
No is just a thought that never crosses my mind  
Maybe in the parking lot  
Better bring your friend along  
Better all together than just one at a time  
  
Chorus  
S is for the simple need  
E is for the ecstasy  
X is just to mark the spot  
Cause thats the one you really want  
Yes sex is always the answer its never a question  
Cause the answers yes oh the answers yes  
Not just a suggestion if you ask the question  
Then its always yes yeah  
  
Im loving what you wanna wear  
I wonder whats up under there  
Wonder if Ill ever have it under my tongue  
I love to try to set you free  
I love you all over me  
Love to hear the sound you make the second youre done  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Yes sex is always the answer its never a question  
Cause the answers yes oh the answers Yes  
Not just a suggestion if you ask the question  
Then its always yes yeah yes  
Yeah yeah yeah
