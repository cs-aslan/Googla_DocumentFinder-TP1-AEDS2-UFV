Shane we started as friends  
But something happened inside me  
Now Im reading into everything  
But theres no sign you hear the lightning baby  
  
You dont ever notice me  
Turning on my charm  
Or wonder why Im always where you are  
  
Ive made it obvious  
Ive done everything but say it  
ive crushed on ya so long but on and on you get me wrong  
Im not so good with words  
Since you never noticed  
The way that we belong  
Ill say it in a love song  
  
Ive heard you talk about  
heard you talk about  
How you want someone just like me  
But every time I ask you out  
time I ask you out  
We never move past friendly nono  
  
And you never how  
I stare when were alone  
Or wonder why I keep you on the phone  
  
Ive made it obvious  
Done everything but sing it  
Ive crushed on you so long but on and on you get me wrong  
Im not so good with words  
And since you never notice  
The way that we belong  
Ill say it in a love song  
Yeah  
  
You are my very first thought in the morning  
  
And my last at nightfall  
  
You are my love that came without warning  
  
Mark and Shane  
I need you  
I want you to know  
  
Ive made it obvious  
So finally Ill sing it  
Ive crushed on you so long  
Im not so good with words  
And since you never notice  
The way that we belong  
Ill say it in a love song  
  
And sing it until the day youre holding me  
Ive wanted you so long but on and on you get me wrong  
I more then adore you but since you never seem to see  
  
But you never seem to see  
Ill say it in this love song
