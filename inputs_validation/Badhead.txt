So far Ive not really stayed in touch  
Well you knew as much its no surprise that today  
Ill get up around two from a lack of anything to do  
  
And I might as well just grin and bear it  
Cause its not worth the trouble of an argument  
  
And you have not really stayed in touch  
Well I knew as much its no surprise that today  
Ill get up around two with nothing to do  
Except get a touch of flu  
  
And I might as well just grin and bear it  
Cause its not worth the trouble of an argument  
And in any case Id rather wear it  
Its like a badhead in the morning  
  
And I know
