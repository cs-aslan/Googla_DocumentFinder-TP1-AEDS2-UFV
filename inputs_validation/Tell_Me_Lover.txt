Tell me lover tell me what youre gonna do  
You gonna walk the walk or just talk the talk  
Honey whats up with you  
  
Tell me lover tell me how its gonna be  
You gonna mess around or just turn me down  
Honey wont you please tell me  
  
Your good intentions aint too good no more  
You answer questions by slammin that bedroom door  
Come on baby lets turn the lamp down low  
Ill solve your problems so honey please dont go  
  
If the silence could kiill honey wed both be dead  
It aint hard to tell were hangin on by a thread  
Say somethin darlin say whats on your mind  
Well find the answer I got nothin but time
