To him it may be over  
But for her itll be one day at a time  
He may call it freedom  
But to her hes still locked inside her mind  
You can throw away loves golden pen  
Cause thats all she wrote  
The fire of love they kindled  
Has all gone up in smoke  
What a shame what a sight  
A good love died tonight  
  
To him its just and ending  
But to her the pains beginning to start  
For him its just a walk away  
But for her its a breaking heart  
One goodbye and lots of tears  
Are all she has left to show  
For those seven years  
That just walked out the door  
A lot of dreams lost their lives when  
A good love died tonight  
  
They were headed for forever  
When the hope that they were riding left the track  
All the pleading and believing in the world  
Wont bring the feeling back  
You can throw away loves golden pen  
Cause thats all she wrote  
The fire of love they kindled  
Has all gone up in smoke  
What a shame what a sight  
A good love died tonight  
  
What a shame what a sight  
A good love died tonight
