If I could give you the world on a silver platter  
Would it even matter youd still be mad at me  
If I could find in all this a dozen roses which I would to give you  
Youd still be miserable  
  
Cause reality Im gone be who I be  
And I dont feel no faults for all the lies that you bought  
You can try as you may bring me down but I say  
That it aint up to you Gonna do what you do  
  
Hate on me Hater now or later  
Cause Im gonna do me youll be mad baby  
Go head and hate go head and hate on me hater cause Im not afraid of  
What Ive got I paid for you can hate on me  
  
Oh If I gave you peaches outta my own garden  
And I made you a peach pie would you slap me high  
What if I gave you diamonds outta my own womb  
Would you feel the love in that or ask why not the moon  
If I gave you sanity for the whole of humanity  
And Have all the solutions for the pain and pollution  
No matter where I live despite the things I give  
Youll always be this way so go head and hate  
  
Hate on me Hater now or later  
Cause Im gonna do me youll be mad baby  
Go head and hate go head and hate on me hater cause Im not afraid of  
What Ive got I paid for you can hate on me  
  
Hate on me Hater now or later  
Cause Im gonna do me youll be mad baby  
Go head and hate go head and hate on me hater cause Im not afraid of  
What Ive got I paid for you can hate on me  
  
You Cannot hate on me Hate on me Hater now or later  
Cause Im gonna do me youll be mad baby  
Go head and hate on me hater cause Im not afraid of  
What Ive got I paid for you can hate on me

Cause Im gonna do me youll be mad baby  
Go head and hate go head and hate on me hater cause Im not afraid of  
What Ive got I paid for you can hate on me
