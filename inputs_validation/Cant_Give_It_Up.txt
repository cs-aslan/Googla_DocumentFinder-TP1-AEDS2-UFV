Ive been saying that Id  
Leave well enough alone  
Now Im behaving  
Like Im begging you for a bone  
When it feels good you cant help it  
You just hang by the phone  
And it felt that good last night  
I cant give it up  
  
You come on like a prince  
You got everyone convinced  
That youre a prince of a man  
But Im the one who knows you  
Im the one you show that you  
Dont give a damn  
Cant give it up oh no cant give it up  
  
Ive been dreaming youd fall in love with me  
No cold blooded scheming  
If it could be that easy  
But you still fight it  
And I must like it  
That I have to reach for what I want  
And as long as it feels that good  
I cant give it up  
  
I dont want to want you  
I dont want to want you  
Cause you cant give cant give  
No I dont want you cause you  
Cant give
