The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in 68  
And he told me all romantics meet the same fate someday  
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark cafe  
You laugh he said you think youre immune go look at your eyes  
Theyre full of moon  
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you  
All those pretty lies pretty lies  
When you gonna realise theyre only pretty lies  
Only pretty lies just pretty lies  
  
He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer and he pushed  
Three buttons and the thing began to whirr  
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie  
And she said Drink up now its gettin on time to close  
Richard you havent really changed I said  
Its just that now youre romanticizing some pain thats in your head  
You got tombs in your eyes but the songs  
You punched are dreaming  
Listen they sing of love so sweet love so sweet  
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet  
Oh and love can be so sweet love so sweet  
  
Richard got married to a figure skater  
And he bought her a dishwasher and a Coffee percolator  
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on  
And all the house lights left up bright  
Im gonna blow this damn candle out  
I dont want Nobody comin over to my table  
I got nothing to talk to anybody about  
All good dreamers pass this way some day  
Hidin behind bottles in dark cafes  
Dark cafes  
Only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings  
And fly away  
Only a phase these dark cafe days
