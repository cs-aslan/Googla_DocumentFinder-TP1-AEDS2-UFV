Someday they wont let you so now you must agree  
The times they are atelling and the changing isnt free  
Youve read it in the tea leaves and the tracks are on TV  
Beware the savage jaw  
Of 1984  
  
Theyll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air  
And tell that youre eighty but brother you wont care  
Youll be shooting up on anything tomorrows never there  
Beware the savage jaw  
Of 1984  
  
Come see come see remember me  
We played out an all night movie role  
You said it would last but I guess we enrolled  
In 1984 who could ask for more  
1984 who could ask for mororororore  
Mororororore  
  
Im looking for a vehicle Im looking for a ride  
Im looking for a party Im looking for a side  
Im looking for the treason that I knew in 65  
Beware the savage jaw  
Of 1984  
  
Come see come see remember me  
We played out an all night movie role  
You said it would last but I guess we enrolled  
In 1984 who could ask for more  
1984 who could ask for mororororore  
Mororororore  
  
1984 1984 1984 more  
1984 1984 more  
1984
