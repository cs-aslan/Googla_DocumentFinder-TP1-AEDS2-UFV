Yes I guess Ill get the papers and go home  
Like Ive been doin ever since weve been apart  
I get some consolation when I read  
Of someone elses lonely heart yes  
I wonder if you get the papers too  
And if you feel as melancholy as I do  
Until youre in my arms again never more to roam  
I guess Ill get the papers and go home yes  
  
I guess Ill get the papers and go home  
Like Ive been doin ever since weve been apart  
Yes I get some consolation when I read  
Of someone elses lonely heart  
Mm I wonder if you get the papers too  
And if you feel as melancholy as I do  
Baby till youre in my arms again never more to roam  
I guess Ill get the papers and go home  
Yes I guess Ill get the papers and go home
