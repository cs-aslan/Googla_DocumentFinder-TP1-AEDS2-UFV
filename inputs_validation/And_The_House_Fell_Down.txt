The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down  
Im more paranoid with every little sound  
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around  
And a siren wailing on the other side of town  
  
Oh the TVs on and the colors really hurt my head  
If I could think straight Id wish that I was dead  
Or curled up naked in my lovers bed  
Instead Im hanging over Hell suspended by a single thread  
  
Chorus  
And I dont recall who said it at this time  
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind  
I built it up and the wolf he came around  
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down  
  
With a rolled up note Im hovering on that line  
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine  
And a little weed just to level me sometime  
I put the clock in the drawer cause Ive cancelled out the time  
  
Chorus  
  
So dont knock on my door dont try to call  
Im holed up in this room talking to the wall  
When youre high as this you think you know it all  
When youre this deep in theres no place else to fall  
  
Chorus  
  
And still that saying gets inside my mind  
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind  
I built it up and the wolf he came around  
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down
