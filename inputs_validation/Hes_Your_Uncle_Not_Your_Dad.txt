Hes your uncle not your dad  
Hes the best friend you ever had  
So come on dig dig dig in until it hurts  
Just remember Pearl Harbor  
The Alamos and nothing could be worse  
Hes your favorite relative  
And he needs a lot to live  
So just bring bring bring everything until you bleed  
And hell send back what he dont need  
If youre not in form tenfortys your salvation  
By deprivation of temptation  
Dark and blondes I hear are not deductible  
Oh say can you see if theres anything left for me  
When he calls you as he may do  
Dont be frightened red white and blue  
Just be thankful you dont live in Leningrad  
Hes your uncle not your dad  
If youre honest you dont have to shake and shiver  
The food is lousy up the river  
Its give and take and he does all the taking  
Oh say can you see if theres anything left for me  
Life has two things you cant subtract  
Death and taxes to be exact  
So just papapatriotically declare  
Hes your uncle hes your uncle not your dad
