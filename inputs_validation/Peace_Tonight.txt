Honey pick the red corner shoes  
The ones that hardly ever get used  
I knelt in front of my whole collection  
And Im picking you a special selection  
On a no news is good news middle of midyear day  
I feel no ill with time to kill I want to play  
  
Lets make peace tonight  
lets make peace tonight  
The moon is bare and shining bright  
moon is shining bright  
Lets make peace tonight in a good time  
lets make peace tonight  
  
Im callin on my good friends today  
You know the drives about an hour away  
And well be pitching up a tent by the trees  
And well be wading in the river to our knees  
Oh now loves been planted and were checking out the yield  
Its two black dogs and a white one their running in the field  
  
Lets make peace tonight  
lets make peace tonight  
The moon is bare and shining bright  
moon is shining bright  
Well lets make peace tonight in a good time  
lets make peace tonight  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Well we used to have some money but we spent it  
used to have some money but we spent it  
Yeah so when we want to have it then we rent it  
when we want to have it we rent it  
But were cuttin up the rug and I know you love me love me  
were cuttin up the rug and I know you love me  
And the best of everything here is free  
everything here is free  
Oh when things get messy then we tidy up the room  
Well be no stranger to that dustpan and the broom  
  
Lets make peace tonight  
lets make peace tonight  
The moon is bare and shining bright  
moon is shining bright  
Lets make peace tonight  
lets make peace tonight  
The moon is bare and shining bright  
moon is shining bright  
Lets make peace tonight in a good time  
lets make peace tonight
