Heavens sake everyone  
For standin in my way  
For ruinning all my fun  
You say your doing it for my sake  
  
I thought I did my best  
It was nearly good enough  
But all that effort I guess  
It didnt add up to very much  
It hurts me when you call  
I hate the way your thinkin  
I could have so easily had it all  
I couldve had everything  
I couldve had everything  
This perfect life Im in  
Screwin myself over  
I couldve had everything  
  
I should have had everything  
You almost got me thinking  
Im screwing myself over  
Screwin myself over  
  
They say that madness is  
Doing a thing the same way  
You hope its gonna turn out different  
But ya doing it anyway  
I guess its what I did with you  
But at least I have a reason  
So my apologies wont go to anyone  
It hurts me when you say  
That all my close mates hate me  
I really thought I had it all  
I couldve had everything  
I couldve had everything  
Its the perfect life for men  
Screwing myself over  
Screwing myself over  
I couldve had everything  
I shouldve had everything  
You almost got me thinking  
Im screwing myself over  
  
I coulda I coulda I coulda  
I coulda I coulda I coulda had everything  
I coulda I coulda I coulda  
I coulda I coulda had everything  
  
I came so near to thinking  
I had something  
I couldve had everything  
Its the perfect life for men  
Screwing myself over  
Couldve had everything  
I shouldve had everything  
You almost got me thinking  
Im screwing myself over  
Couldve had everything  
I shouldve had everything  
Its the perfect life for men  
Screwing myself over  
Couldve had everything  
I shouldve had everything  
You almost got me thinking  
Im screwing myself over
