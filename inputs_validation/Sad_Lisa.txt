She hangs her head and cries on my shirt  
She must be hurt very badly  
Tell me whats making you sad Li   
Open your door dont hide in the dark  
Youre lost in the dark you can trust me  
Cause you know thats how it must be  
Lisa Lisa sad Lisa Lisa  
  
Her eyes like windows trickle in rain  
Upon the pain getting deeper  
Though my love wants to relieve her  
She walks alone from wall to wall  
Lost in her hall she cant hear me  
Though I know she likes to be near me  
Lisa Lisa sad Lisa Lisa  
  
She sits in her corner by the door  
There must be more I can tell her  
If she really wants me to help her  
Ill do what I can to show her the way  
And maybe one day I will free her  
Though I know noone can see her  
Lisa Lisa sad Lisa Lisa
