Remember when I saw you for the first time  
I never thought youd be mine  
Then we went ahead and fell in love  
Heaven was a common ground  
We were never coming down  
The two of us we had more than enough  
You and I are not the same  
To you love is just a game  
Things will never be the same again  
  
So now goodbye  
This time I will be gone goodbye  
Stayed for way too long  
Started out with trust  
But it isnt just about the good times baby  
  
Remember all the promises we swore to  
Cant say I didnt warn you  
How I did adore you way back then I did adore you adore you  
Ohhhhh  
But you broke a solemn vow  
Ha youre paying for it now  
Wouldnt you expect more from a friend  
You and I are not the same  
To you love is just a game  
Things will never be the same again  
  
So now goodbye  
This time I will be gone goodbye  
Stayed for way too long  
Started out with trust  
But it isnt just about the good times baby  
  
So now goodbye  
This time I will be gone goodbye  
I stayed for way too long  
I dont need you now  
And I am oh so tired of excuses baby  
  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
This time will be gone goodbye  
Stayed for way to long this time  
It all started out with trust  
But it isnt about the good times baby  
  
So now goodbye  
This time I will be gone goodbye  
I stayed for way too long  
I dont need you now  
And I am oh so tired of excuses baby
