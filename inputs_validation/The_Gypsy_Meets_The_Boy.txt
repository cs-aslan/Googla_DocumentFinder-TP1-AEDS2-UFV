The tarot is fate said the Gypsy Queen  
And she beckoned me to glimpse my future shed seen  
  
She said do you see what I see be careful to choose  
Be careful what you wish for cause it may come true  
When I lay the card down will it turn up the fool  
Will it turn up sorrow If it does then you lose  
  
Im the lost boy can you help me  
Yeah Im the lost boy can you help me  
  
Then the illusion was real a crimson idol I saw  
But the higher hed fly then the further hed fall  
  
Im the lost boy can you help me  
Yeah Im the lost boy can you help me  
  
I just wanna be I just wanna be I just wanna be  
The crimson Idol of a million  
I just wanna be I just wanna be I just wanna be  
The crimson Idol of a million eyes  
Of a million
