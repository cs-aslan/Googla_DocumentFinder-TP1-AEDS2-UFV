Was it the words she said or was it all in the way  
In which the lady said them  
Her eyes that spoke to me were sending my heart  
A thought so deep I cant forget them  
I guess it wasnt the right time or the place  
For love right then  
But we met destiny and it sealed our fate  
  
Chorus x2  
Well meet again we will meet again  
I know we will we will meet again  
On my heart its written we will meet again  
Somewhere someplace somehow Ill find her then as I did now just for a
moment  
And I will hear the wind that told me  
I will return again my love have patience  
Lifes a circle it all comes back around  
So until then  
Ill be waiting for you knowing somehow  
  
And if she were standing in a crowd  
Shed be the one that I would find among the faces  
And if the music was too loud  
Itd be her voice that I would hear  
Above it all we will meet again  
  
I know we will we will meet again  
I know we will we will meet again  
And if she were standing in a crowd  
Shed be the one that I would find among the faces  
And if the music was too loud  
Itd be her voice that I would hear  
Above it all we will meet again  
I know we will we will meet again  
On my heart its written we will meet again  
From this day tillwe will meet again  
Well meet again we will meet again  
Well meet again we will meet again
