Where is she  
When the little thing cries  
She lies in a bed  
With a friend of mine  
But some nights  
Shell run back in fright  
If she picks on a dick  
Thats too big for her pride  
  
Oh Oh  
Why did I ever go marry her  
I was a child  
Im holding the baby  
Shes rantanning constantly  
She saw me coming for miles  
She saw me open wide  
  
Four oclock  
And the keys in the lock  
And shes been on the wing  
And shes stinking of drink  
Wakes the kid  
So I put him to sleep  
And shes in there all night  
Doubled over the sink  
  
Oh Oh  
Why did I ever go marry her  
I was a child  
Im holding the baby  
Shes rantanning constantly  
She saw me coming for miles  
She saw me open wide  
Open wide  
Open wide
