Here we are at the crossroads again  
And neither of us knows the right way  
So here we go trying to get by  
The limits of our yesterdays  
And if it brings us down  
It wouldnt be the first time  
Over and over we put our hearts on the line  
  
Chorus  
Every time we fall  
We get a little stronger baby  
Every time we walk away  
It hurts a little more  
Someday we may find  
We can make it last this time  
Until then we give it all  
Everytime we fall ohh  
  
When youre gone  
Still burning me  
And Im jealous of the sun that warms you  
And still I know  
Im walkin in your dreams  
And I aint seen the last of you  
  
Cause theres a part of you  
That never really leaves  
Over and over  
You keep coming back to me  
  
Chorus  
  
When one road ends  
Theres always another one to try  
So were goin through these changes  
Time and time again  
You and me theres no goodbye  
No goodbye  
  
Cause theres a part of you  
That never really leaves  
Over and over  
You keep coming back to me  
  
Every time we fall ohhh  
I feel its getting stronger baby  
Stronger baby stronger baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Every time we fall  
Only makes us stronger  
Every time we walk away  
Hurts just a little bit more  
Someday we may find  
We can make it last this time  
Until then we give it all  
Everytime we fall  
  
Every time we fall  
We get a little stronger baby  
Every time we walk away  
Hurts just a little bit more  
Someday we may find  
We can make it we cam make it  
Until then we give it all  
Every time we fall
