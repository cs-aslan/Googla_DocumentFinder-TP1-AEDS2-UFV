Theres too many women and not enough wine  
Too many poets and not enough rhyme  
Too many glasses and not enough time  
Draw your own conclusions  
  
My old dogs a good old dog  
My old mans a silly old sod  
The human face is a terrible place  
Choose your own examples  
  
Went to the river but I could not swim  
Knew Id drown if I went in  
Lost my faith in a terrible race  
Restinpeace hereafter
