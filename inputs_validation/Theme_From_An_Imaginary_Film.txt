What if I told you I love you  
What if I called you in rhythm  
In this world theres nothing left  
Well nothing thats new  
  
What if I told you without  
Loving is simply a lie  
Although she moves into the night  
Oh tell me youre mine  
Please say its true  
  
Oh shame its over  
I was the light and the days of them all  
Well push me over  
Im flat on my back but Im having a ball  
And just look whose laughing  
  
What if I flew like a dove dear  
What if I would you in rhythm  
Theres nothing left  
Nothing thats good left for me now  
  
OhIll just go and sleep with strangers  
Ill live like a lord in a tower  
cause in the city theres too mich air  
That I cant dream at night  
Well not anymore  
  
Oh shame its over  
It been such fun and we had a ball  
Well push me over  
But Ill be the last people to fall  
Well just look whose laughing  
  
Oh shame its over  
How like a cow bloated on grass  
Well push me over  
Me on my back and you on your arse  
Such a shame its all over  
There are so feel days left to grasp  
So push me over  
We on our back and you on your lazy arse  
Well just look whose laughing
