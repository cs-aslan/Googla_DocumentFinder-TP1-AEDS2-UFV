Watching the news  
The plot you already know  
Dont have anything  
They dont belong to anywhere  
Imagining things to be perfectly white  
Who are these people  
They dont belong  
Wheres the us navy  
  
I like the action  
Money money  
Food here  
Woman woman  
Fight here  
Approval approval  
Frown frown  
Approval  
My daughters not some damn hamburger chainsaw  
In a parking lot  
She trips  
Quick quick  
Wont somebody help me  
  
She carries that television on her back  
As I watch the news  
Thats the russians  
Carry the television  
Money money  
Carry the television  
Food here  
Fuck here  
Fuck here  
Fight here  
Get out  
Approval  
You dont count  
  
The president today announced that hes pushing all the buttons in a giggling
fit  
Ha ha ha ha  
You already know  
Makes you feel good  
Makes you feel so good  
I want to be on  
I want to be on  
So good crying  
I want to be on  
The news  
  
I want to be known  
I want to be known  
I want to be on  
I want to be known  
Come on everybody knows that everybodys watching the news  
  
Watching watching  
Its something about crime crime crime  
I like to watch  
But I like to  
What do you want  
What do you want

Legs rush legs rush legs rush legs  
Scary scary damn scary  
Come all ye faithful ye joyful triumphant
