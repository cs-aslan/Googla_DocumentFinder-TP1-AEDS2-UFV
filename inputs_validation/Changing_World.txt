Old man sitting by the side of the road  
Hes not watching the birds today  
Hes not watching the sunset like he always does  
Hes looking at the future  
He has seen the past  
School boy passes by interrupts his thoughts  
He said sir can you spare me a dollar  
I got to make in time for my grade eight class  
I am fresh out of cigarettes  
And I cant be late  
The old man said  
  
Chorus  
The world is changing  
Take your time look around  
Make the right decision  
  
He has no crystal ball  
But he sees the future  
Doesnt like what he sees but what can he do  
Little girl passes by with a baby in her arms  
He thinks its her mothers  
But no it is her own  
Shes only twelve years old for crying out loud  
With his trembling finger  
He wipes away the tears  
If this is the future he doesnt wanna be part of it  
  
Chorus  
  
Old man sitting by the side of his bed  
When he goes to sleep tonight  
He wont have no sweet dreams  
Hell be haunted by ghosts from the future  
Welcome to the future
