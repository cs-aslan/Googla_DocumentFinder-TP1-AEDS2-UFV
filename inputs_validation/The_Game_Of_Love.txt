Tell me  
Just what you want me to be  
One kiss  
And boom youre the only one for me  
So please tell me  
Why dont you come around no more  
Cause right now  
Im crying outside the door of your candy store  
  
It just takes a little bit of this a little bit of that  
It started with a kiss  
Now were up to bat  
A little bit of laughs a little bit of pain  
Im telling you my babe  
Its all in the game of  
  
Love is  
Whatever you make it to be  
Sunshine  
Instead of this cold lonely sea  
So please baby  
Try and use me for what Im good for  
It aint saying goodbye  
Its knocking down the door of your candy store  
  
It just takes a little bit of this a little bit of that  
It started with a kiss  
Now were up to bat  
A little bit of laughs a little bit of pain

Control me  
Console me  
Please hold me  
You guide me  
Divide me  
Into me

Why dont you come around no more  
Cause right now  
Im dying outside the door of your loving store  
  
It just take a little bit of this a little bit of that  
It started with a kiss  
Now were up to bat  
A little bit of laughs a little bit of pain  
Im telling you my babe  
Its all in the game of love
