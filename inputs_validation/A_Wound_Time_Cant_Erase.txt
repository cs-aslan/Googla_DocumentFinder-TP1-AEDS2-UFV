Have you found since youve turned me down  
The one that you were searching for  
Are you glad that you made me sad  
For you know I vowed to love you ever more  
  
What did you have in mind  
When you broke this heart of mine  
Are you laughing in my face  
Darlin what can I do  
When you tell me we are through  
Youve left a wound time cant erase  
  
Tell me dear are you satisfied  
To be footloose and fancy free  
Is it power you want  
Or the things you have done  
What youve gained I guess Ill never see  
  
What did you have in mind  
When you broke this heart of mine  
Are you laughing in my face  
Darlin what can I do  
When you tell me we are through  
Youve left a wound time cant erase
