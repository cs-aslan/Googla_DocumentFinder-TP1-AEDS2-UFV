Im a master of disguise  
Mystery in your eyes  
Travelling the backroads of your country  
Well you think youve got my number  
And then again you wonder  
Will you ever get to find the real me  
  
Things are not always  
As they first may seem  
Its like living in a dream  
  
So youd like me to reveal  
All that I know and feel  
At the risk of causing panic and destruction  
Well theres a method to this madness  
I dont mean to cause you sadness  
My course is strictly governed by instruction  
  
Things are not always  
As they first may seem  
Its like living in a dream  
  
Im a master of disguise  
Not about to compromise  
My position in this scheme of worldly values  
Ah theyre calling out my name  
Ive promised to remain  
Ever faithful to the memory of what is true  
  
Things are not always  
As they first may seem  
Its like living in a dream  
  
Oh Im living in a dream  
Im high Im high  
In the cold cold night Im high
