In the heat of the fight I walked away  
Ignoring words that you were saying  
Trying to make me stay  
I said This time Ive had enough  
And youve called a hundred times  
But Im not picking up  
Cause Im so mad I might tell you that its over  
But if you look a little closer  
  
I said leave but all I really want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming Im in love with you  
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more  
And dont you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
Me and my stupid pride sitting here alone  
Going through the photographs  
Staring at the phone  
I keep going back over things we both said  
And I remember the slamming door  
And all the things that I misread  
So babe if you know everything  
Tell me why you couldnt see  
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me  
  
Yeah I said leave but all I really want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming Im in love with you  
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more  
And dont you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
And Ill scream out the window  
I cant even look at you  
I dont need you but I do I do I do  
I say theres nothing you can say  
To make this right again  
I mean it I mean it what I mean I  
  
I said leave but baby all I want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming Im in love with you  
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more  
And dont you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
With your face and the beautiful eyes  
And the conversation with the little white lies  
And the faded picture of a beautiful night  
You carried me from your car up the stairs  
And I broke down crying wish it werent this mess  
After everything and that little black dress  
After everything I must confess I need you
