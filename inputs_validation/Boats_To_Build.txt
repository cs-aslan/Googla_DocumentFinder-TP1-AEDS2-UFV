with Alan Jackson  
  
Its time for a change  
Im tired of that same ol same  
The same ol words the same ol lines  
The same ol tricks and the same ol rhymes  
  
Days precious days  
Roll in and out like waves  
I got boards to bend I got planks to nail  
I got charts to make I got seas to sail  
  
Im gonna build me a boat  
With these two hands  
Itll be a fair curve  
From a noble plan  
Let the chips fall where they will  
Cause Ive got boats to build  
  
Sails are just like wings  
The wind can make em sing  
Songs of life songs of hope  
Songs to keep your dreams afloat  
Im gonna build me a boat  
With these two hands  
Itll be a fair curve  
From a noble plan  
Let the chips fall where they will  
Cause Ive got boats to build  
  
Shores distant shores  
Theres where Im headed for  
Got the stars to guide my way  
Sail into the light of day  
  
Im gonna build me a boat  
With these two hands  
Itll be a fair curve  
From a noble plan  
Let the chips fall where they will  
Cause Ive got boats to build
