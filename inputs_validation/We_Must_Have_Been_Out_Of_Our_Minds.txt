We said our goodbyes long ago never thinking wed miss each other so  
All the memories we cant leave behind oh we must have been out of our minds  
I thought I loved another not you how foolish I thought the same too  
They both turned out to be the wrong kinds oh we must have been out of our
minds  
 piano   
Lets forgive and forget the past weve known  
And reap together the wild seeds weve sown  
Surely they can forgive us and find that we must have been out of our minds  
I thought I loved another  
Yes we must have been out of our minds yeah
