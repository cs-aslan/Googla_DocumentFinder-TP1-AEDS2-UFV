Youre so close to tellin me youre leaving  
Packin up your things and leavin town  
If you can walk away the rest is easy  
Once you cut the strings that tie you down  
  
Just look me in the eye and say its over  
Just tell me you dont want me around  
Once you say goodbye its gone forever  
Once you cut the strings that tie you down  
  
Theres no way I can picture me without you  
I still think of you in your wedding gown  
If I have to give you up may God be with you  
Once you cut the strings that tie you down
