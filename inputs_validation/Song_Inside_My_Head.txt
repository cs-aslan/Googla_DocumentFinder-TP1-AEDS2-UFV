Theres a tune inside my head  
That makes me wish that I were dead  
It keeps on going on and on  
And I dont even like this song  
I dont know where I heard it first  
But now it has become my curse  
Wish that it would go away  
But it is stuck on replay  
Go away  
Go away  
Your melody  
Is killing me  
There it is once again  
Swimming through my cranium  
Suffocating all my thoughts  
An auditory candy floss  
This musical inanity  
Driving me to insanity  
If I only had one wish  
Id kill the person who wrote it  
Go away  
Go away  
Youre a bad song  
So move along  
Its louder than it was before  
I dont think I can take much more  
So I jump and scream and shout  
Hoping I can drown it out  
But instead I trip and fall  
And bash my head upon a wall  
Wait a second whered it go  
Whats that on the radio  
No No
