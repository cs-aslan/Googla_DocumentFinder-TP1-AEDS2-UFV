What dyou want  
Youve got nothing to say  
And you cant  
Hide that look of dismay  
Why pretend  
You only want revenge  
Its been said  
Id be dead  
If looks could kill  
  
Whered you go  
With that threadbare crowd  
Still in tow  
Do they appreciate your  
Tales of woe  
Droning on and on  
Lost your thread  
Id be dead  
If looks could kill  
  
You think youre acting  
In selfdefense  
But youre fooling no one  
And you never will  
The only crime is irrelevance  
No wonder youre worried  
Id be dead and buried still  
If looks could kill  
  
Welcome to a unique event  
Where we see what you represent  
Flaunt that look  
Of Let battle commence  
It changes nothing  
And it never will  
And on that matter of selfdefense  
Im not worried  
Id be dead and buried still  
If looks could kill  
If looks could kill
