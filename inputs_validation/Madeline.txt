Out my window a memory  
And Im dyin inside  
I know the way it should be  
Even though it was right in front of me  
It was something I just couldnt see  
  
Your lonely face  
Your lonely eyes  
But this is something you cant disguise  
Its not just me you feel it too  
Cause you know I belong to you  
  
Look at where were goin  
Tell me what can I say  
Were tracing our footsteps  
Were going the same way  
  
Madeline  
Here we go around again  
You know it I know it  
Dont try to pretend  
We know it could be  
So much better than its been  
Ahh ooo  
Here we go around again  
  
I was empty inside  
But I just didnt know  
You are my ten thousand roses  
And I let you go  
Before I make the same mistake  
Hold me in your arms  
We belong you know it in your heart  
  
Cause look where were going  
No doubt in my mind  
Cant you see its meant to be  
Oh oh oh my Madeline
