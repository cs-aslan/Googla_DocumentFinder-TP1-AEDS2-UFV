If youre going out with someone new  
Im going out with someone too  
I wont feel sorry for me Im getting drunk  
But Id much rather be somewhere with you  
  
Laughing loud on a carnival ride yeah  
Driving around on a Saturday night  
You made fun of me for singing my song  
Got a hotel room just to turn you on  
  
You said pick me up at three am  
Youre fighting with your mom again  
And Id go Id go Id go somewhere with you  
  
I wont sit outside your house  
And wait for the lights to go out  
Call up an ex to rescue me climb in their bed  
When Id much rather sleep somewhere with you  
  
Like we did on the beach last summer  
When the rain came down and we took cover  
Down in your car out by the pier  
You laid me down whispered in my ear  
  
I hate my life hold on to me  
Ah if you ever decide to leave  
Then Ill go Ill go Ill go  
  
I can go out every night of the week  
Can go home with anybody I meet  
But its just a temporary high cause when I close my eyes  
Im somewhere with you somewhere with you  
  
If you see me out on the town  
And it looks like Im burning it down  
You wont ask and I wont say  
But in my heart Im always somewhere with you  
  
Laughing loud on a carnival ride yeah  
Driving around on a Saturday night  
You made fun of me for singing my song  
Got a hotel room just to turn you on  
  
You said pick me up at three am  
Youre fighting with your mom again  
And Id go Id go Id go  
  
I can go out every night of the week  
Can go home with anybody I meet  
But its just a temporary high cause when I close my eyes  
Im somewhere with you somewhere with you  
  
Somewhere with you  
Im somewhere with you  
Im somewhere with you  
Somewhere with you  
Somewhere with you
