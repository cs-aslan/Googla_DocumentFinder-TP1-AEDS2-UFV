When I say goodbye it is never for long  
Cause I know our love still lives on  
It will be again exactly like it was  
Cause I believe in the power of love  
  
When youre close I can feel the power  
When its love I can always tell  
Love for me is the best thing now  
Its something that I know so well  
  
Hold me closer and every minute  
Of every hour feel the power of love yeah  
Hold me tighter and take me higher  
And feel the fire of the power of love  
  
Did you know that your feelings show  
You thought your love was locked up inside  
But when your senses start to overload  
Love is something you should never hide  
  
Youve got to believe in love  
Its a feeling thats next to none  
Cant stop until we are one  
With the power of love  
  
Tell everyone to try  
I promise youll reach the sky  
One thing that we cant deny  
Is the power of love  
  
So close your eyes and you can feel it  
Comin straight from above its the power of love  
You cant deny it so dont even try it  
Let the feelin sweep you off your feet
