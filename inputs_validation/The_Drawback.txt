Seen the troubles and the evils of this world  
Ive seen the stretches between godliness and sin  
Ive had the promise and confessions of true faith  
And the hypocrisy that always lies within  
And they left it for you all of this for you  
And they left it for you all of this for you  
  
Ive seen the products and the other world of waste  
Ive seen the colour of corruption deep within  
Ive seen them lose themselves in dignity and taste  
To see in black and white and through to black again  
And they left it for you all of this for you  
And they left it for you all of this for you  
  
And they left it for you all of this for you  
And they left it for you everything for you  
Ive seen the troubles and the evils of this world  
Ive seen the ones who can succeed but always lose  
Ive seen whats left of poor technology and work  
And watched them dying as they leave their ship of fools  
And they left it for you all of this for you  
And they left it for you all of this for you
