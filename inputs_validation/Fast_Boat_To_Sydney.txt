Oh I am a cheat and Im a liar oh but youre a lovin ball of fire  
Ill leave you like a bum without a penny  
And while Im home with the blues Ill be hopin like a kangaroo  
When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney  
I said listen to me baby I gave up the lovin trade  
Im tired of all this runnin jumpin playin  
But youre like it down under the world with the Australian girls  
And theres not a word of truth in what youre sayin  
Oh but I am a cheat and Im a liar and youre a lovin ball of fire  
Honey Ill leave you like a bum without a penny  
And while Im home with the blues Ill be hopin like a kangaroo  
When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney  
This is my greatest act Ive come boomerangin back  
Grinnin like a Rudolf Valentino  
But then you grab your travel load like a swingin grimmin dog  
And hopped on that fast boat to Sydney  
Cause Im a cheat and Im a liar but youre a lovin ball of fire  
Honey Ill leave you like a bum without a penny  
And while Im home with the blues Ill be hopin like a kangaroo  
When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney
