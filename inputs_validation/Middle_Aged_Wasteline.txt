Baba ORiley  The Who  
  
I eat Mrs Fields  
I snack between meals  
You can see my crack above my Levis  
I dont need to diet  
To prove Im light  
And I dont peel the skin off of my chicken  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Deep fry  
Dont exercise  
And grow that middle age waistline  
  
It salivates my glands  
To smell a fresh roast ham  
So put out the butter and pass the rolls right over  
A second helping here  
A hefty mug of beer  
Lets get some dinner before the food gets colder  
  
Middle age waistline  
I got a spandex waistband  
Middle age waistline oh yeah  
Not a crumb gets wasted  
  
My belts busted
