Cant you see  
It wont mean a thing to me  
Ive been doing this too long  
Baby girl Ive felt it all  
So watch out  
If you try to play your luck  
Aint nobody gonna care enough  
To catch you fall  
  
Chorus  
So dont you fall in love  
Dont make me make you fall in love  
Dont make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me  
Nobody needs to fall in love  
I swear Im just a bird  
Girl Im just another bird  
Dont make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me  
Like me  
  
Girl you tried  
You tried to warn me  
But baby Im warning you  
Girl Ill show you  
This is no game  
Youll be falling to the point of no return  
No return  
  
Chorus  
  
I know youre rolling hard with it dont lie  
I know its got a hold of you  
I know youre rolling with it baby dont you lie  
Baby  
  
I know youre rolling hard with it dont lie  
I know its got a hold of you  
I know youre rolling with it baby dont you lie  
Baby  
  
So dont you fall in love  
Dont make me make you fall in love  
Dont make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me  
Like me  
Cause girl Im just a bird  
Im just another bird  
Dont make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me  
Like me
