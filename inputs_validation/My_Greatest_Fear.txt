Sometimes many miles may lay between us  
But only for the job I choose to do  
And what part helps me through my darkest hours  
Each mile brings me closer to you  
  
Chorus  
Please believe youre all I ever wanted  
If you should leave I dont know what Id do  
Id be like a child afraid of darkness  
The greatest fear I have is losing you  
  
Heaven knows Ive always had these demons  
watchin for a place to take control  
Whispering youll never be there for me  
Waiting at the end of my road  
  
Chorus  
  
Alone I wander through this world no meaning in my life  
Then I found you and finally saw the light  
  
Chorus
