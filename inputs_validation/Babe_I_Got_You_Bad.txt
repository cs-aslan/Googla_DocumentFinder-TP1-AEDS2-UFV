Babe I got you bad  
Dreaming bloodwet dreams  
Only madmen have  
Baby I got you bad  
I wish to God I never had  
And it makes me feel so sad  
O Baby I got you bad  
Yeah Babe I got you bad  
  
I long for your kiss  
For the turn of your mouth  
Your body is a long thing  
Heading South  
And I dont know what Im talking about  
All of my words have gone mad  
Ah baby I got you bad  
  
Seasons have gone wrong  
And I lay me down in a bed of snow  
Darling since youve been gone  
Well my hands they dont know where to go  
And all of my teeth are bared  
I got you so much Im scared  
Ah baby I got you bad  
  
With the sweep of my hand  
I undid all the plans  
That explode at the moment I kissed you  
On your small hot mouth  
And your caramel limbs  
That are hymns to the glory that is you  
Look at me darlin its sad sad sad  
Look at me darlin its sad sad sad  
Baby I got you bad  
  
Smoke bilowing from the bridges  
And the rivers we swim in are boiling  
My hands are reaching for you everywhere  
But youre not there or youre recoiling  
And a weary moon dangles from a cloud  
Oh honey I know its not allowed  
To say I got you bad  
  
I got you bad  
I got you bad  
I got you bad  
Repeat and fade
