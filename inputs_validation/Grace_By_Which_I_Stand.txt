Lord the feelings are not the same  
I guess Im older I guess Ive changed  
And how I wish it had been explained that as youre growing you must
remember  
That nothing lasts except the grace of God by which I stand in Jesus  
I know that I would surely fall away except for grace by which Im saved  
  
Lord I remember that special way  
I vowed to serve you when it was brand new  
But like Peter I cant even watch and pray one hour with you  
And I bet I could deny you too  
But nothing lasts except the grace of God by which I stand in Jesus  
Im sure that my whole life would waste away except for grace by which Im
saved  
But nothing lasts except the grace of God by which I stand in Jesus  
I know that I would surely fall away except for grace by which Im saved
