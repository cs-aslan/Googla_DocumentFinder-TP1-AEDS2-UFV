Girl I must have been crazy  
To say that it was over  
I had to be a fool  
To yell out we were through  
  
And now Im all alone  
And feeling down and out baby

How can we get it back again  
  
Oh sometimes a man can say things  
That he really dont mean  
Well Im sorry baby  
Bring your lovin back to me  
  
Cause I cant sleep babe I cant think babe  
I cant live babe without you in my life  
I cant go on babe this is my song baby  
I dont wanna do nothin if I go away baby  
And I cant do nothin if youre not around  
  
Baby can we meet somewhere and talk about it  
Oh baby can we work it out  
Im not gonna let you go my baby  
Before I let you know that I  
  
Cant sleep babe I cant think babe  
I cant live babe without you in my life  
I cant go on babe this is my song baby  
I dont wanna do nothin if I
