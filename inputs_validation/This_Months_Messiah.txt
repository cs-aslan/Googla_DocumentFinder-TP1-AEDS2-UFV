Im just a pilgrim here looking for holy ground  
Im just a body lost but my soul can be found  
How many miles to go  
How many miles to Babylon  
  
I dont know where to turn when answers all fade clear  
But I must find a place theres only questions here  
How many miles to go  
How many miles to Babylon  
How many miles to go  
How many miles to Babylon  
  
I feel feel like Im on trial  
Who made a judge of you  
Are you this months messiah  
  
I am a fightin man tired of living under the gun  
But am I looking for love or am I looking to run  
  
How many miles to go  
How many miles to Babylon  
How many miles to go  
How many miles to Babylon  
  
I heard I heard it on the wire  
That its all up to you  
Are you this months messiah  
  
How many miles to go  
How many miles to Babylon
