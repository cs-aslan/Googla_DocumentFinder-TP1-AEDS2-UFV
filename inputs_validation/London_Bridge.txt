There wasnt much left  
Except for the last twenty sack  
And the last twenty of my last check  
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step  
Woke up and took it in with a half breath  
Then a deep sigh I struck a matchstick  
I lit my cigarette  
Feeling half dead whiskey on my mind  
Then came the dead  
Sheriff in the yard here comes the rest  
I sat like a ghost they all passed by  
My girl cried baby thisll be my last bye  
Baby in her arms  
She took a cab home  
She told me I was only good for a sad song  
A crooked smile I gave  
Nonchalant about it  
Maybe shell come back  
This time I doubt it  
Act like I care but I really dont  
Wanted to change  
But somehow I knew I really wont  
See Im the type of man who cant stay out the bottle  
If the sun is out Id rather be in the shadow  
Sadness is like a wound that I cant heal  
Maybe Ill love blood I just let it spill  
And I never turned to church for a pray in hand  
Gods not going to land another saving hand  
If the time came like it has time again  
Then I would watch the clock and be late again  
One gun and a Harley in the driveway  
One way out dirt road pathway  
Put another dead butt in the ash tray  
I stand up still drunk half baked  
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring  
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring  
Paid him no attention  
In fact I barely seen him  
Until he walked away  
And he started singing  
  
London Bridge is falling down falling down  
And if it dont stop falling then all of us will drown  
Then well crash crash right down again  
Oh well crash crash right down again  
  
I didnt see it coming  
I didnt see the wall  
And I went from running to a slow crawl  
I feel like Im a child but Im afraid to cry  
Would say Im okay but Im afraid to lie  
I speak no evil but hear no angels  
A family is callin but all I see is strangers  
Take the bible from the hotel drawer  
Hell froze over ice cold hells door  
Knock knock  
Im on the salt road non stop  
The exit I will pass cause the sign did rot  
And the gust of a dry summer  
Dirty water in the tap  
I think I found my number in the sand  
Right next to an empty can  
Old number seven Jack is back again  
And the voice goes round and round  
And I would take the bridge  
But I cant forget the sound  
  
London Bridge is falling down falling down  
And if it dont stop falling then all of us will drown  
Then well crash crash right down again  
Oh well crash crash right down again  
  
Ill be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I cant be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
Ill be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I cant be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
Ill be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I cant be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
Ill be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I cant be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
And well crash crash right down again  
Oh well crash crash right down again  
  
Ill be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I cant be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
Ill be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I cant be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
Ill be coming up when the sun goes down
