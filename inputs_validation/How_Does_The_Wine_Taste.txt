How does the wine taste  
Does it stain your lips  
What is the fruitlike  
Just beyond my finger tips  
Just out of reach I see so much  
I cannot taste and mustnt touch  
Tied to my little world  
My safe little world  
What would it be like  
If I broke the string  
Would it be lovely  
And a little frightening  
There is so much Ive never understood  
How does the wine taste Is it good  
How does the wine taste  
Does it make you glow  
How does the wine taste  
How does the wine taste  
How does the wine taste  
I think I know
