All alone lost in my dreams  
Who could know just how I feel  
All the hopes and fears the joy  
The tears hidden in my heart  
Tell me Im not dreaming is it you  
Time stand still when I see you  
All these years if you only knew  
How Ive wanted to ask would you come back  
Im here for you please dont go away  
Ill never leave Ill always stay  
Oh baby please come back to me  
Or it is the only way loves meant to be  
Ill stay here with you for eternity  
Oh baby please come back to me  
All alone lost in my dreams  
Who could know just how I feel  
All the hopes and fears the joy  
The tears hidden in my heart  
Tell me Im not dreaming is it you  
Time stand still when I see you  
All these years if you only knew  
How Ive wanted to ask now youve come back  
Im here for you please dont go away love calls our names  
Love has a way  
Oh baby please come back to me  
Or it is the only way loves meant to be  
Ill stay here with you for eternity  
Oh baby please come back to me  
I cant live without you dont you see  
We have a true love love beyond the dreams  
Oh baby please come back to me
