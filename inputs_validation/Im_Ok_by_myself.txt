Could this be an arm around my waist  
Well surely the hand contains a knife  
Its been so all of my life  
Why change now  It hasnt  
Now this might surprise you but  
I find Im OK by myself  
And I dont need you  
Or your morality to save me  
No no no no no  
  
Then came an arm around my shoulder  
Well surely the hand holds a revolver  
Its been so all of my life  
Why change now  It hasnt  
Now this might disturb you but  
I find Im ok by myself  
And I dont need you  
Or your benevolence to make sense  
No no no  
  
After all these years  
I find Im OK by myself  
And I dont need you  
Or your homespun philosophy  
No no no no  
  
This might make you throw up in your bed  
Im ok by myself  
And I dont need you  
And I never have I never have  
No no no no
