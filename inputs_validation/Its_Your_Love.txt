Dancing in the dark  
Middle of the night  
Taking your heart  
And holding it tight  
Emotional touch  
Touching my skin  
And askin you to do  
What youve been doing  
All over again  
  
Oh its a beautiful thing  
Dont think I can keep it all in  
Ive just gotta let you know  
What it is that wont let me go  
  
Its your love  
It just does something to me  
It sends a shock right through me  
I cant get enough  
And if you wonder  
About the spell Im under  
Oh its your love  
  
Better than I was  
More than I am  
And all of this happened  
By taking your hand  
And who I am now  
Is who I wanted to be  
And now that were together  
Im stronger than ever Im happy and free  
  
Oh its a beautiful thing  
Dont think I can keep it all in  
And if you ask me why Ive changed  
All I gotta do is say your sweet name  
  
Its your love  
It just does something to me  
It sends a shock right through me  
I cant get enough  
And if you wonder  
About the spell Im under  
Oh its your love  
  
Oh its a beautiful thing  
Dont think I can keep it all in  
Ive just gotta let you know  
What it is that wont let me go  
  
Its your love  
It just does something to me  
It sends a shock right through me  
I cant get enough  
And if you wonder  
About the spell Im under  
Oh its your love  
Its your love  
Its your love
