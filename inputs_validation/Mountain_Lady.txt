Youre climbing mountains in the sky  
Youre always looking for another high  
Youre looking so far ahead youre looking away  
Im taking you in youre taking me on  
Your smiling face never lets you down  
Where everyone who calls you friend remembers your name  
And everyone who called you friend will never again  
  
Im taking a walk in your heart  
Im feeling my way through the dark  
Im taking a walk in your heart  
Im taking a walk in your heart  
  
Ive known the mountain ladies well  
They live a neverending fairytale  
Where walking through another heart is all in a day  
They treat me well they treat me nice  
They think that Im gonna pay the price  
So now Im gonna put you straight youre playing my game  
  
Im taking a walk in your heart  
Im feeling my way through the dark  
Oh Im taking a walk in your heart  
Im taking a walk in your heart  
  
Theres never been a better reason at any time before  
cause everything that weve been feeling is now an open door  
And as the snow is falling the mountains start to call  
But do I feel you walking in my heart  
  
Im taking a walk in your heart  
Im feeling my way through the dark  
And Im taking a walk in your heart  
Yeah Im taking a walk in your heart  
Im feeling my way through the dark  
Yeah Im taking a walk in your heart
