Uh huh uh huh  
Feels good to be back at the essence where it all started you know  
Uh huh uh huh  
What up  
Uh huh uh huh  
Turn up my headphones man uh huh uh huh  
I got a few things I want to tell the people out there  
Yo yo yo  
  
All I hear is Fugee this Fugee that  
Where Fugee At I need Fugees to spit up on this track  
Lauryn if youre listenin Pras if youre listenin  
Gimme a call Im in the lab in the Booga Basement  
Yall know my style Im still mini money mini mini  
It aint all about the money  
  
When I was hustler two dogs by my side plus a black pistola  
Loud MCs feel the silencer  
Yall still rhymin yall cuckoo I send cycles to Belvue  
This aint a sequel son but I have you Scream 2 Ah  
  
Real live cinema of the streets produced a junkie  
Put back on your shirt man you lookin like ET  
Youre cracked out for dough some blow on saxophone  
Youre rhymin off beat even with help from my metronomes  
  
See yall aint MCs you a CM  
Common Motherfucker rhymin about Lexus and Benz  
The same Benz you got jacked in drunk off of Gin  
You woke up in hell gettin sexed by Marilyn Manson  
  
You lie you deny pass me the microphone  
I guess like Eddie Murphy you was givin em a ride home  
Yeah right 25 mics material in The Source  
While your rap crews on steroids lookin like Full Force  
  
Your girl shes buffed puffed in daytime dont play rough  
The freaks come out at night so thats when I bring out the cuffs  
Grandma yell CD player number two  
Shadaes in my bedroom singin sweetest taboo  
  
All I hear is Fugee this Fugee that  
Where Fugee At I need Fugees to spit up on this track  
Lauryn if youre listenin Pras if youre listenin  
Gimme a call Im in the lab in the Booga Basement  
Yall know my style Im still mini money mini mini  
It aint all about the money  
  
We used to rap now yall want to come and get me with a bat  
Yall must be smokin crack with Pookie from New Jack  
How could yall forget Im the reason yall MC  
But yall flip like Pharisees and charge me for blasphemy  
  
You know who you are eight bar superstar  
Karate cars buy up the bars with the credit cards  
You want to impress Im young chick you just met  
First thing she say I used to run with Wyclef  
  
Look surprised see your flesh outside your vest  
Yeah you could fight in the WWF  
Cause in this arena aint nothin but gladiators and haters  
Hopin they kill me and roll and feed me to the tigers  
  
Oh Lord protect me from the devil  
They open the book of life yall readin like the anti Christ  
Your weak kid stop lyin to the public  
You wanted it so bad that you took all the production credits  
  
Some MCs in the underground mad at me Cause Im above ground  
Counting English pounds  
I tell ya what success dont come overnight  
I was in Noahs Ark for Forty days and Forty nights  
  
Contemplatin what should I write what should I recite  
Cause aint nobody here but thugs and chicks wit ice  
Thats when I daydream into the twilight  
Girls wit they man screamin I hate life  
  
Baby girl look in the opposite direction  
Cause my class is the Misedu  
  
All I hear is Fugee this Fugee that  
Where Fugee At I need Fugees to spit up on this track  
Lauryn if youre listenin Pras if youre listenin  
Gimme a call Im in the lab in the Booga Basement  
Yall know my style Im still mini money mini mini  
It aint all about the money
