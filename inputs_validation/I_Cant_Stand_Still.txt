I know you love me  
You know I love you too  
You know I always will  
No matter what you do  
  
You say you havent got another lover  
You say you only want to make the scene  
Then you try to keep it under cover  
What does that mean  
  
And baby I cant stand still while hes holding you  
I cant stand while hes kissing you  
  
So we got a little problem baby  
How to put together love and work  
If I could figure out that one darlin  
I could save us from a world of hurt  
  
I remember when we walked together  
Makin love on a summer night  
Guess we thought that it would last forever  
We were all right  
  
But baby I cant stand still while hes holding you  
I cant stand still while hes touching you  
  
I can take it if you need some freedom  
Understand it if you miss your friends  
Dont you ever try to think of me some  
You never tell me where youve been  
  
You say you havent got another lover  
You say you only want to make the scene  
Then you try to keep it under cover  
What does that mean  
  
And baby I cant stand still while hes holding you  
I cant stand still while hes kissing you  
And baby I cant stand still while hes holding you  
I cant stand still while hes touching you  
I cant stand still
