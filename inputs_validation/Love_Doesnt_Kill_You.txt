It doesnt kill you its not a oneway ticket to a lonely life  
It might break your heart but the physical risk is low  
You might feel so bad that you wanna die  
but if you died you would never know  
that it didnt kill you  
soon you wouldve felt better  
are you happy in heaven  
do you win all the games that they play up there  
do you have a new body  
what kind of wings do you wear  
I havent felt so bad that I wanted to die  
but if I died I would never know  
Love doesnt kill you  
its supposed to make you feel better  
Youre never going to feel any better  
once youre dead you dont get any deader  
and you get no lovin but you feel no pain  
never have to lose again  
I just wish you couldve been a bit bolder  
now youre never gonna get any older  
and I really do miss you but how would you know  
Is that the only way to go  
Love doesnt kill you  
but you cant run away from the bare inside  
you cant just quit right right here  
youve gotta let it ride  
Weve all felt so bad that we wanted to die  
but if we died we would never know  
Love doesnt kill you  
It makes you feel better  
youre not ever going to feel any better  
once youre dead you dont get any deader  
and you get no lovin but youll feel no pain  
never have to lose again  
I just wish you couldve been a bit bolder  
now youre never going to get any older  
and I really do miss you  
but how would you know  
Its just too bad that its too late to let it show
