If I were a pendulum swing and you were the bird in the cuckoo clock  
Evry time you cuckocooed I would double tick another tick tock  
Id double my swing evry time youd sing wed make good time with each other  
Oh but that would be just so much fun cooin and swingin together  
If I were a little bitty boy and I had just a little bit o credit  
I would make a loan for an ice cream cone and Id go right away and get it  
You would lick a little and I would lick a little we surely could lick with
each other  
Oh but that would be just so much fun eating it all together  
And if I were a little honey bee and you were a little butterfly  
I would be waiting at the garden gate until you came fluttering by  
Maybe youd stop on a red rose top and then we could talk to each other  
Oh but we coud flutter up so much fun being in the garden together  
But Im just an ordinary guy and I love all the things you do  
You seem such a talented beautiful girl and Im afraid to even talk to you  
If I were as bold like some guys hearin them talk to each other  
Id come over and ask you if we could go out together  
But if you were a MercedesBenz Id have to be a Fleetwood Brougham  
And evry time I saw you rollin on the freeway I think Id have to follow you
home  
You could let me lodge in your double garage bumper to bumper out of the
weather  
Nobody home but the Benz and the Brougham really rarin to roll off together
