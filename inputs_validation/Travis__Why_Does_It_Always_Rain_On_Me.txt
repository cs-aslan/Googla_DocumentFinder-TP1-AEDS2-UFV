I cant sleep tonight  
Everybody saying Everythings alright  
Still I cant close my eyes  
Im seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights  
  
Sunny days where have you gone  
I get the strangest feeling you belong  
Why does it always rain on me  
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen  
  
Why does it always rain on me  
Even when the sun is shining  
I cant avoid the lightning  
  
I cant stand myself  
Im being held up by an invisible man  
Still life on a shelf when  
I got my mind on something else  
  
Sunny days where have you gone  
I get the strangest feeling you belong  
Why does it always rain on me  
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen  
  
Why does it always rain on me  
Even when the sun is shining  
I cant avoid the lightning  
  
Oh where did the blue skies go  
And why is it raining so Its so cold  
  
I cant sleep tonight  
Everybodys saying Everythings alright  
Still I cant close my eyes  
Im seeing a tunnel at the end of the lights  
  
Sunny days where have you gone  
I get the strangest feeling you belong  
Why does it always rain on me  
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen  
  
Even when the sun is shining  
I cant avoid the lightning  
  
Oh where did the blue skies go  
And why is it raining so  
Its so cold  
  
Why does it always rain on me  
Why does it always rain on
