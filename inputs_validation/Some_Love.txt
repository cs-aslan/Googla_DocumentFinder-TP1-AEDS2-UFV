CHORUS  
Some love  
You know it brings me down down down  
Some love  
You know it brings me down down down  
They say that love is heaven sent  
Well I guess they told another lie  
How can it be a part of me  
You cant even look me in my eye  
CHORUS  
BRIDGE  
All this time you made a fool of me  
You told honey sweet lies  
Im fed up with your alibis  
I was blind now I see yeah  
CHORUS  
Lets end this game lets stop this farce  
Cause I dont wanna live a lie  
Lifes so short and loves so sparse  
I guess Ill have to say goodbye  
It brings me down down down yeah  
Some love it brings me down down down  
BRIDGE  
If this is love I want no part of it  
They call this love  
Now Ive got to quit you baby  
If this is love I want no part of it  
They call this love dirty dirty love  
Some love  
If this is love dont break my heart  
If this is love dont want no part  
If this is love dont break my heart  
If this is love dont want no part  
If this is love dont break my heart  
If this is love dont want no part  
If this is love dont break my heart  
Some love  
Oh first you burn me with desire  
Then you go and douse the fire
