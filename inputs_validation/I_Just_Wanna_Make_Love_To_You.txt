I dont want you to be no slave I dont want you to work all day  
I dont want you to cause Im set for you  
I just wanna make love to you love to you love to you  
I dont want you to wash my clothes I dont want you to keep my home  
I dont want you to I dont want you to  
I can tell by the way she walks I can see by the way the baby talks  
I can know by the way you treat your man  
I can love you baby till the morning  
I dont want you to cause Im sad and blue  
I just wanna make love to you love to you love to you
