Yeah never thoughts of suicide Im too alive  
But I still treat it likes its do or die  
Even though dying isnt in the plans  
But neither was making it and here I am  
In the presidential do you like your new room  
Always presidential and tonights no blue moon  
Since I saw Aliyahs precious life go too soon  
She deserve the credit for how Im about to get it  
Thats why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street  
Got a new condo move it to the beach  
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib  
Goddamn man shes beauty and the beast Lord  
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming  
Still so young that I aint had enough of nothing  
  
The fam here the drink here the girls here  
Well fuck lets get it then  
  
Chorus  
Im trying to let go of the past  
Should we make this one a double  
You aint even gotta ask ah  
Because its hard to say no say no  
Yeah its hard to say no  
Are you down are you down Yea you all the way down every time  
Every time every time every time  
Am I down am I down Yea Im all the way down well be fine  
Well be fine well be fine well be fine  
Are you down are you down Yea you all the way down every time  
Every time every time every time  
Am I down am I down Yea Im all the way down well be fine  
Well be fine well be fine well be fine  
  
Used to make us proud we had dreams of getting bigger man  
Loved you until now but now Im the nigga man  
You keep talking that You was this and you had this  
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it  
Got a show up in your city yo girl is in the line  
And the line around the corner its my motherfucking time  
You should take it as a sign man I got it right now  
I wouldnt doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now  
Lets be real about this shit can I take you home  
Or come to where you stay Do you live on your own  
I heard you got your ways I never would have known  
She said youre such a dog I said youre such a bone  
Ive been everywhere where you know me from  
These days women give it to me like they owe me one  
But they crave attention though they always saying Show me something  
But girl you aint the only one thats trying to be the only one  
At least I admit that if you get that and you with that  
Then fuck lets get it then  
  
Chorus

Take care of the business nigga shine on these niggas  
Give these niggas the business nigga  
Kill spray anything in the way nigga fuck em We dont love em
