My girls got a big mouth  
With which she blabbers a lot  
She laughs at most everything  
Whether its funny or not  
And if you see her  
Tell her its over now  
  
Chorus  
I want a girl who will laugh for no one else  
When Im away she puts her makeup on the shelf  
When Im away she never leaves the house  
I want a girl who laughs for no one else  
  
My girls got eyeballs  
In the back of her head  
She looks around and around  
You know it makes me sad to see her like that  
Please dont believe her she says that for anyone  
And if you see her  
Tell her its hey hey hey hey  
  
Chorus  
  
And if you see her  
Tell her its over now  
And if you watch her go  
Watch her watch her watch her watch her  
  
Chorus
