My heart is broken into 10 000 thousand pieces or more  
Cause you hurt me so much  
When I found out I wasnt your one true life  
It was with someone else  
  
I cried every day every night  
Cause I loved you so much  
Why does your heart get broken everytime you fall in love  
Well you cannot back down to the one you found  
You say you regret everything  
Should have thought about that when you threw me out of your mind  
  
I should have listen to my friends  
When they said youre nothing  
It wouldnt last to the end babe  
Never thought it would  
  
I thought you were different  
Bye my love forever ill miss you  
Well youre in the past now  
You cannot back down to the one you found  
You say you regret everything  
Should have thought about that when you threw me out of your mind  
Youre out of my life now
