Rain tears of joy tears of pain  
Is this really me  
Standing here at the station  
The card said I mustnt be late  
Ive never been late  
Ive never really had the chance  
Years and years and not even wanting a second chance  
Look for a raincoat and a rose  
  
I hope no one sees theyll laugh I know  
He was always like that yes it always showed  
Did I do something wrong to have to pay  
In many more ways than one  
Rainy day what do I say  
How simple its all become  
  
Love is for fools and fools have no grace  
Damn them while you can  
Out here on the fence is such a lonely place  
I wish I was foolish now  
The greatest of pain is never really knowing  
Maybe today Ill find out this way  
The way that Im going
