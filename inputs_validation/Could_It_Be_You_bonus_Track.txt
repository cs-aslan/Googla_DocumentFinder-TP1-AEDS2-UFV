Chorus  
Could it be you  
Ive been searching so hard to find  
Tell me How could I have been so blind  
You were here all the time  
Could it be you  
  
You never looked as good to me as you look tonight  
Oh yeah  
Its like Ive seen you for the first time  
Through a lovers eyes  
Oh Could it be  
That I never knew its always been you that Ive been looking for  
You were always right here by my side  
Oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
Could it be you  
Ive been searching so hard to find  
Tell me How could I have been so blind  
You were here all the time  
Oh Yeah  
Could it be you  
  
The girl I always have dreams about  
The one I just cant live without  
Is it so tell me now  
Could it be you  
Can you imagine what its like to always live without love  
I need to have you in my life  
I think I know that now  
My open heart open heart  
Make you a part make you apart  
A part of this lovin Ive been keepin ive been keeping for  
And I might just give it all to you  
Oh ho  
  
Chorus  
Could it be you  
Ive been searching so hard to find  
Tell me How could I have been so blind  
You were here all the time  
Could it be you  
The girl I always have dreams about  
The one I just cant live without  
Is it so tell me now  
  
Every girl I meet  
Though they might be sweet  
They cant compare to you  
So I search no more what Im looking for  
I know I found in you  
  
Chorus  
Could it be you  
Ive been searching so hard to find  
Tell me how could I have been so blind  
You were here all the time  
Could it be you  
  
The girl I always have dreams about  
The one I just cant live without
