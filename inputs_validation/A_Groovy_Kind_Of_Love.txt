When Im feeling blue all I have to do  
Is take a look at you then Im not so blue  
When youre close to me I can feel your heart beat  
I can hear you breathing near my ear  
Wouldnt you agree baby you and me got a groovy kind of love  
  
Anytime you want to you can turn me onto  
Anything you want to anytime at all  
When I kiss your lips ooh I start to shiver  
Cant control the quivering inside  
Wouldnt you agree baby you and me got a groovy kind of love oh  
  
When Im feeling blue all I have to do  
Is take a look at you then Im not so blue  
When Im in your arms nothing seems to matter  
My whole world could shatter I dont care  
Wouldnt you agree baby you and me got a groovy kind of love  
We got a groovy kind of love  
We got a groovy kind of love oh  
We got a groovy kind of love
