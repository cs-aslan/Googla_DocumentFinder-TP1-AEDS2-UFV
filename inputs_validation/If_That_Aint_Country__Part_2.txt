Well Im just an old man now covered with scars  
Most of them I got fightin in them redneck bars  
And A bunch of brand new tattoos that Squench put on me  
He covered up the ones Id gotten years ago  
Back in prison when I was just Dave Coe  
And I wasnt famous then and I wasnt free  
You know I grew up in a three room run down shack  
At the foot of the hill by the railroad track  
Where decent folks dont go when the sun goes down  
My daddy worked at the Goodyear tire and rubber company  
And he worked on cars  
My momma went to church and my daddy went to bars  
Most people just called it the hillbilly part of town  
I had a 55 Chevy when I was fifteen  
I painted it red cause I was still green  
Hell I couldnt even afford to buy it gas  
Had A 410 rifle and a bowie knife to  
Red Man tobacco that I liked to chew  
And wed count the cars when the trains went past  
And if that aint country ill kiss your ass  
Chorus  
If that aint country itll hair lip the pope  
If that aint country its a damn good joke  
Ive been on the Grand Ol Opry and I know Johnny Cash  
And if he aint country ill kiss your ass  
You know one of my sisters was a lady of the night  
Then one day she saw the light  
Now she dont do those things that she used to do  
She never made the funeral when my daddy died  
I said Id forgive her but I guess I lied  
Cause there aint no way to hide the way that I feel  
Me and my brothers took our sister Diane  
Down to the funeral home to see the old man  
Jimmy was the oldest and Diane she was the youngest one  
Jack and Ray was in the middle and then there was me  
And Im the one that turned 23  
And grew up to be that yankees rebel son  
Times are changing I heard Bob Dylan say  
Its been fifteen now since my father passed away  
But I can still picture him in his overalls  
Standin around the house where he made his deals  
Around the porch there was a bunch of old wheels  
And some used Harley Davidson parts that he sold for cash  
There was fifty holes in an old tin roof  
Me and my family was livin proof  
Everybody called us old poor white trash  
And if that aint country ill kiss your ass  
Chorus  
If that aint country itll hair lip the pope  
If that aint country its a damn good joke  
Ive been on the Grand Ol Opry and I know Johnny Cash  
And if he aint country ill kiss your ass  
And if that aint country ill kiss your ass  
And if that aint country ill kiss your ass
