The thousand times I lived before were just in my dreams  
Well I woke up to realize it didnt mean a thing  
Ive seen several better places several better times  
Somehow those memories got left behind  
  
Give me back that year good or bad  
Give me back something that I never knew I had  
  
I guess it all boils down to it was just a second guess  
So god damn long ago its hard to feel I did my best  
And I think of our relationship and all  
And why I cant see that anymore in your eyes  
  
Give me back that year good or bad  
Give me back something that I never knew I had  
  
Well I sit and watch it go by  
I sit and watch shit go by  
Go by  
  
That year
