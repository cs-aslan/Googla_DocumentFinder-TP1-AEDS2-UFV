Lets take an old fashioned walk Im just bursting with talk  
What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk  
Lets take a stroll through the park down a lane where its dark  
And a heart thats controlled may relax on an old fashioned walk  
I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart  
Theres nothing like walking and having a heart to heart  
I know a girl who declined couldnt make up her mind  
She was wrapped up and sold coming home from an old fashioned walk
