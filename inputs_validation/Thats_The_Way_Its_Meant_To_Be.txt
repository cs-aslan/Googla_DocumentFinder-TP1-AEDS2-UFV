Every single heart needs a home  
Everybody needs a touch of human kindness  
Its no wonder we feel alone  
cause all in all we need each other  
  
Everybody has a day  
When it seems that everything is going no where  
Looking for a touch from above to find gods love  
And in it all you know we need each other  
Lets understand that were in it together  
  
chorus 1  
Take a ride through the streets of gold  
On a train thats going to set us free  
Hand in hand we will share the load  
Were strong together as a family tree  
Just reach out and you know ill be there  
In your time of need  
Thats the way its meant to be  
  
If somebody lets you down  
Dont you want to turn away and run for cover  
Dont let it steal your joy dont let it destroy  
cause in it all you know we need each other  
Its by design that were in it together  
  
chorus 2  
Take a ride through the streets of gold  
On a train thats going to set us free  
Hand in hand we will share the load  
Were strong together as a family tree  
Just reach out and you know ill be there  
You can count on me  
Thats the way its meant to be  
Were brothers and sisters  
Were in it together  
cause thats the way he meant it to be
