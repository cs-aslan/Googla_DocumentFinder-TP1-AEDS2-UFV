In the name of Satan  
Well achieve our goal  
With the blessings of Hades  
Well outlive our role  
Through the power of Hellfire  
We will gather our strength  
With the blood of mere mortals  
Our thirst will be quenched  
In the name of Satan  
Great things can be done  
Through the lore of the demons  
Satans song can be sung  
Gather around my Legions  
For in time youll see  
Mortals screaming for mercy  
At the king for world war three  
Hail Satanas  
In nominai Deinochous  
Satanas Lucifre excelsis  
In the name of Satan  
Well take what we need  
Rock and roll damnation  
Let your heart bleed  
Sensing the distaster  
So well blame our hate  
Hell bore Satans child  
To use you as our bait  
Hear infernal legions plead  
As Satan sings his songs of war  
As I see mortal corpses rise  
Up from the depths  
I care not for the whore  
I shall destroy the priests  
Bound in chains and demned in Hell  
I shall ner release their souls  
For the internal torment always reigns  
Summon legions of the night  
For we are now as one
