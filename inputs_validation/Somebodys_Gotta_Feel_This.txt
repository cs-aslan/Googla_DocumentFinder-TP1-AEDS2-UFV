I used to party with the Betties on the lower east side  
Never drop top forty cause I always rock be sides  
Grides with a hundred spokes to match  
We roll two deepthree freaksfour amps in the back  
  
I kicked that crack game rap game now I let my axe bang  
Livin in sin and its a beautiful thing  
I want to twang like Hangrock like roll  
Got soul like Stevie when Im under the sun and so  
  
Somebodys gotta feel this  
Someones got to feel this  
Somebodys gotta feel this  
Someones got to feel this  
Somebodys gotta feel this  
Someones got to feel this  
  
I never had a lot of money never made much sense  
Been chasin bunnies like a dummy overlookin my rent  
He spent every rent cent puttin hickeys on his bed  
Hes rockin dickies slippin lickin honeys steady  
Lookin for love I put my talent on hold  
Told my soul to glow it said get up and go  
And so I packed my bags with a whole lot of realness  
  
Somebodys gotta feel this  
Someones got to feel this  
Somebodys gotta feel this  
Someones got to feel this  
Somebodys gotta feel this  
Someones got to feel this  
  
I see these people makin money and its funny to me  
Tryin to act that fresh I wish theyd bump into me  
Cause it aint nothing to me want to eat a little more  
Taste a little bit pride from every drink that I pour  
Ive been a whore for years showing love to my peers  
  
Never sold for any less than what I see in the mirror  
Steer wide to avoid the blows Ive been dealt  
Let the six strings ride when the twelves are felt  
So when you see me tuggin on the end of my roap  
You better raise up or duck when I reach in my coat because  
  
Somebodys gotta feel this  
Somebodys gotta feel this  
Someones got to feel this  
Someones got to feel this  
Somesomesome bodys gotta feel this  
Someones got to feel this  
Somebodys gotta feel this  
Someones got to feel this  
  
Feel this
