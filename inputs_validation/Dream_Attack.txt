Nothing in this world  
Can touch the music that I heard  
When I woke up this morning  
It put the sun into my life  
It cut my heartbeat with a knife  
It was like no other morning  
  
I dont belong to no one  
But I want to be with you  
I cant be owned by no one  
What am I supposed to do  
  
I cant see the sense in your leaving  
All I need is your love to believe in  
  
Dont look into the sun  
Its not for me or anyone  
To steal the light out of the sky  
Is it really such a sin  
Cause if it is then Ill give in  
I cant live without your love  
  
I dont belong to no one  
But I want to be with you  
I cant be owned by no one  
What am I supposed to do  
  
I cant see the sense in your leaving  
All I need is your love to believe in  
And for you I would do what I can  
But I cant change the way that I am
