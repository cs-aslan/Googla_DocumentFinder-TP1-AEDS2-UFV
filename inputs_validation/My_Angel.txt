Walk the line  
Its not easy  
I must stand alone  
Its the kind of a life Ive chosen  
Right or wrong  
I can feel  
Near me always  
Something to live up to  
Someone to depend upon  
When I have fallen from grace  
When I grow weak from the pace  
I can feel the breath of gentle wings on my face  
And when the world closes in around me  
Then my angel  
Will come and roll away the stone  
Like a hand reaching down from the heavens  
And when the darkness falls all around me  
Then my angel  
Will come and draw aside the veil  
I am safe in the arms of my angel  
Anywhere  
Anytime  
In my mind I know  
That a pair of sweet eyes is watching me  
Wherever I go  
Is it real  
Am I dreaming  
Sometimes I dont know  
But I want to believe its so  
Let me dream on  
Is it profane or divine  
Am I insane I feel fine  
I can close my eyes but I still see it shine
