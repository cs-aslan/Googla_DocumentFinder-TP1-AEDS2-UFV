Does it matter if youre not sure  
Youre never gonna see him anymore  
Hes gone for good  
You might get mad at yourself  
Youre doing your very best  
You cant do nothing else baby  
Youve done the best you can  
Theres been good times  
You know there have been reasons  
You still dont say you want somebody else  
You want somebody else  
Im giving you just one more chance  
To recompense on my romance  
Cant believe theres been good times  
You know there have been reasons  
You still dont say you want somebody else  
You want somebody else  
  
Im gonna stay with you baby  
Yes I will  
Stay with you baby  
Yes I will  
  
Repeat
