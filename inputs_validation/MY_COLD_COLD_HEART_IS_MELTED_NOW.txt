My cold heart is melted now  
Writer hank williams  
My cold cold heart is melted now  
I seek for peace but dont know how  
I go to bed but only weep  
My cold cold heart wont let me sleep  
Your lonesome voice that seems to say  
Your cold cold heart will pay and pay  
My tears pour down like falling rain  
Through restless sleep I call your name  
Perhaps someday beyond the blue  
Well meet sweetheart and live anew  
Where cold cold hearts cant enter in  
Well laugh and love sweetheart again  
My cold cold heart is melted now  
My once proud head I humbly bow  
Your lonely face in dreams I see  
My cold cold heart has told on me
