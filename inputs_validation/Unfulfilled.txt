To stand the test of time  
To stand alone  
To be without the glue  
That keeps us glued together  
  
And feeling so excrementable  
It only goes to show you  
How many ways you dont know you  
When the bad sets in  
  
I could use some sleep  
Resting falling  
Falling deeper than deep  
We miss the point to carry on  
  
We miss the point  
To carry on where  
Things you love but did not get  
And all the times youve been upset by  
  
Unfulfilled dreams and visions  
And the guilt for your wrong decisions  
Its so hard to pry away  
Pry out from under all the lies  
  
And distractions of the world  
Youve seen what they can do  
But you cant see your way out  
We miss the point to carry on  
  
All thing fall through  
That how it feels when you hear the sound of Disappointment  
So unsatisfied  
When the sights set higher  
  
Some cant achieve dont believe  
There is light at the end at all  
Theres no light  
Time to reach out for whats real  
  
Its easy to miss insist  
That you shouldnt always follow the first thing you feel
