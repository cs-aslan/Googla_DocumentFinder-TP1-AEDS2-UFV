Chorus 2x  
And you aint nothin but a hooker  
Sellin your fuckin soul  
  
Back up They want you I swear  
You got no worries you got no cares  
All you got is motherfuckers who will jock you  
Yeah you got money in your pocket  
And you shoot up the ground like a rocket  
You move so fast lord you cant stop it  
There you are in the club swingin  
And Im just standin there standin there laughin  
All the things people have you believin  
I feel sorry for your ass is out of season  
Maybe you should think of cuttin down drinkin  
Cause you look like a fat rat sinkin  
I coulda helped you but you had to act out  
You dont have a fuckin clue what Im about  
  
Chorus 2x  
And you aint nothin but a hooker  
Sellin your fuckin soul  
  
I saw it comin through the line like a full back  
Youre a crack slack a fuckin rap back yeah  
Dont react youre not fact  
Dont give a fuck yes like that  
What you gonna do now that you aint got nothin  
Look around honey you been frontin  
Everybody knows that youre a fraud And Im making records  
My salutations no hesitations  
No reservation just cancellation  
And if I blow it then I blow it  
Cause Im a poet and I know it  
  
Chorus 2x  
And you aint nothin but a hooker  
Sellin your fuckin soul  
  
Repeat until fade  
You wanna try me  
Dont you know
