Im here youre there  
Come closer tonight Im lonely  
Come here with me  
I want it the way it used to be  
  
What is left of love  
Tell me who would even care  
So much time has passed  
Id still meet you anywhere  
Water under bridge  
Evening after day  
What is left of love  
Here that didnt drift away  
  
I can remember days of sun  
We knew our lives had just begun  
We could do anything were fearless when were young  
Under the moon address unknown  
I can remember nights in Rome  
I thought that love would last a promise set in stone  
  
Id survive with only memories  
If I could change the way I feel  
But I want more than only memories  
A human touch to make them real  
  
Another day another dream  
Over the bridge an empty scene  
Wed spend the weekend lost in bed and float upstream  
I dont know why we moved away  
Lost in the here and now we strayed  
Into a New York zone our promise was betrayed  
  
I was there caught on Tenth Avenue  
You elsewhere with Culver City blues  
Then and there I knew that Id lost you  
  
What is left of love  
Tell me who will even care  
So much time has passed  
Id still meet you anywhere  
Water under bridge  
Evening after day  
What is left of love  
Here that didnt drift away  
  
Dont give me all your love and pain  
Dont sell me New York in the rain  
Lets leave our promises behind  
Rewind and try again  
  
What remains in time that didnt fade away  
Sometimes I need to see  
The way it used to be
