Well Im here but I dont want to stay  
Cause youre not around and Im feeling lonely  
Same old episode for me heading for catastrophe  
And I can see that its  
  
Association with the past  
So think about it  
Its like a tie that did not last  
Dont move so fast  
Dont run cause you might find out  
Find out Im the one  
And I still feel lonesome  
  
Nothings changed it just gets rearranged  
When you come around  
So now whats your story  
You were never there for me  
So Im going out to see  
Cause I cant see that its  
  
Association with the past  
So think about it  
Its like a tie that did not last  
Dont move so fast  
Dont run cause you might find out  
Find out Im the one  
Yeah And I still feel lonesome  
  
Go go go  
Yeah  
  
Now youre here  
But I dont want to stay  
Cause you werent around  
And now you say youre sorry  
And nothings changed  
Its just been rearranged  
So stay down just stay down  
  
Association with the past  
So think about it  
Its like a tie that did not last  
Dont move so fast  
Dont run cause you might find out  
Find out Im the one  
And I still feel lonesome  
  
Well Im still lonesome  
Yeah  
Im still lonesome
