Dear Mrs Reagan I hope youre feeling well  
Fighting drugs and abortion will keep you out of hell  
Send in the troops theyll shut the system down  
Take away their leaders and replace them all with clowns  
  
Out in the Rose Garden time for a speech  
Make up your face so it looks like a peach  
  
Aw Nancy dear what shall I say  
Tell ole Ronnie its all ok
