You come home late and you come home early  
You come on big when youre feeling small  
You come home straight and you come home curly  
Sometimes you dont come home at all  
  
Chorus  
So what in the worlds come over you  
And what in heavens name have you done  
Youve broken the speed of the sound of loneliness  
Youre out there running just to be on the run  
  
Well I got a heart that burns with a fever  
And I got a worried and a jealous mind  
How can a love thatll last forever  
Get left so far behind  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Its a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow  
Its crossed the evil line today  
Well how can you ask about tomorrow  
We aint got one word to say  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Ending  
Youre out there running just to be on the run  
Youre out there running just to be on the run  
Youre out there running just to be on the run
