Silly boy to think that she loves you  
Youre a toy just part of the game  
You think she needs you  
But she misleads you  
Yes shes your girl but only in name  
  
Tenderly shell call you her only love  
Cant you see her heart breaking aim  
Shell call you lover then kiss another  
Yes shes your girl but only in name  
  
Shes a girl with no heart at all  
Breaking evry rule  
Still you wait on her beck and call  
While she plays the field  
You play the fool  
  
Please believe  
These things that Im telling you  
She deceived my heart just the same  
She was my lover til I discovered  
That she was my girl but only in name
