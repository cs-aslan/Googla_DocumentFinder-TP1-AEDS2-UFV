Complications inside of me  
Reminds me that my heart wont always beat  
The ugly face of death thats smiling  
At my rotting teeth  
  
I will die here in this sorrow  
I was waiting for tomorrow  
Palpitate the pulse until  
You feel my heart explode against the wall  
  
Oh  
Talk about me  
Laugh about me  
Cry about me  
Nail me to the cross  
Ill be a martyr for the hated  
The weak the ugly the lost  
  
I will die here in this sorrow  
I wont wait for tomorrow  
Palpitate the pulse until  
You resurrect my soul from the wall  
  
Whoa  
Talk about me  
Laugh about me  
Cry about me  
Nail me to the cross  
  
Whoa  
Whoa  
Whoa
