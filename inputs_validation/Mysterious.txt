I thought I knew you baby  
But it seems I dont know I dont know you at all  
One thing is for sure is youre so bad  
And then again when you kiss me baby  
You know its got the taste  
The taste of an eternal life  
I want you to feel the taste of life  
This moment in time  
I hear the call of a siren  
This lady is quite  
Mysterious  
I want your mind to lock in  
If my life were a glass of water  
Filled by the rain from a velvet sky  
I want you to drink  
Because your lips are dry  
This moment in time  
I follow her blind  
This lady is quite  
Mysterious  
I want your mind to lock in  
This time I thought I got you baby  
But you slipped away  
And I thought Id die  
This moment in time  
Im losing my mind  
But she remains quite  
Mysterious  
Im crossing the line  
I will follow her blind  
This lady is quite  
Mysterious  
I want your mind to lock in  
Im losing my mind  
I hear the call of a siren  
This lady is quite  
Mysterious  
I want your mind to lock in  
Youre so bad  
I thought I knew you baby  
But I dont know you at all  
Its got the taste you know its got the taste  
Of an eternal life
