You and I long to live like wind upon the water  
If we close our eyes well maybe realize  
Theres more to life than what we have known  
And I cant believe Ive spent so long  
Living lies I knew were wrong inside  
Ive just begun to see the light  
  
Long ago there was a dream had to make a choice or two  
Leaving all I loved behind for what nobody knew  
Stepped out on the stage  
A life under lights and judging eyes  
Now the applause has died and I can dream again  
  
Is there anybody listening  
Is there anyone that sees whats going on  
Read between the lines criticize the words theyre selling  
Think for yourself and feel the walls  
Become sand beneath your feet  
  
Fell the breeze  
Times so near you can almost taste the freedom  
Theres a warm wind from the south  
Hoist the sail and well be gone  
By morning this will all seem like a dream  
And if I dont return to sing the song maybe just as well  
Ive seen the news and theres not much I can doalone  
  
Is there anybody listening  
Is there anyone who smiles without a mask  
Whats behind the wordsimages  
They know will please us  
Ill take whats real  
Bring up the lights  
  
Is therew anybody listeing  
Is there anyone that sees whats going one  
Read between the lines  
Criticize the words theyre selling  
Think for yourself and feel the walls  
Become sand beneath your feet
