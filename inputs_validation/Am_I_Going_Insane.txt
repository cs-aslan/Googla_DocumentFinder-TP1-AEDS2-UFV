Everybodys looking at me feeling paranoid inside  
When I step outside I feel free think Ill find a place to hide  
Tell me people am I going insane  
Tell me people am I going insane  
Every day I sit and wonder how my life it used to be  
Now I feel like going under now my life is hard to see  
So tell me people am I going insane  
Tell me people am I going insane  
So Im telling all you people listen while I sing again  
If I dont sound very cheerful I think that Im a schizophren  
So tell me people am I going insane  
Tell me people am I going insane
