Running down an empty street  
Perhaps it was a railway station  
Smell of  cologne  
The sound of a celebration  
  
Chorus  
Ohohoh dislocation  
Ohohoh dislocation  
  
Just a swimmer growing dimmer in the glimmer of a summer  
Waving gladly swimming madly never never going under  
  
Chorus  
  
The sun was going down one quiet evening  
Someone came into the room while I was halfasleep  
We spoke for a while I couldnt see his face  
Later on when he was gone I realized I didnt catch his name  
  
ChorusRepeat x3  
  
Just a swimmer growing dimmer in the glimmer of a summer  
Waving gladly swimming madly never never going under
