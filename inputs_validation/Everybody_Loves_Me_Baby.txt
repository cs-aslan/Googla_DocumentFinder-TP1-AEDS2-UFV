One two three four  
  
Fortune has me well in hand armies wait at my command  
My gold lies in a foreign land buried deep beneath the sand  
The angels guide my evry tread my enemies are sick or dead  
But all the victories Ive led havent brought you to my bed  
  
You see everybody loves me baby whats the matter with you  
Wontcha tell me what did I do to offend you  
  
Now the purest race Ive bred for thee to live in my democracy  
And the highest human pedigree awaits your firstborn boy baby  
And my face on evry coin engraved the anarchists are all enslaved  
My own flag is forever waved by the grateful people I have saved  
  
You see everybody loves me baby whats the matter with you  
Wontcha tell me what did I do to offend you  
  
Now no land is beyond my claim when the land is seized in the peoples name  
By evil men who rob and maim if war is hell Im not to blame  
Why you cant blame me Im Heavens child Im the second son of Mary mild  
And Im twice removed from Oscar Wilde but he didnt mind why he just
smiled  
  
Yes and the ocean parts when I walk through and the clouds dissolve and the
sky turns blue  
Im held in very great value by everyone I meet but you  
cause Ive used my talents as I could Ive done some bad Ive done some
good  
I did a whole lot better than they thought I would so cmon and treat me like
you should  
  
Because everybody loves me baby whats the matter with you  
Wontcha tell me what did I do to offend you  
  
Everybody loves me baby whats the matter with you  
Wontcha tell me what did I do to offend you  
  
Yeah everybody loves me baby whats the matter with you  
Wontcha tell me what did I do to offend you
