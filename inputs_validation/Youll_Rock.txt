Youll want to kick steps to the musical feast  
And witness the force Im about to release

Im a professional producer of hiphop songs  
In case youre unaware my beats are always strong  
Ill exterminate your crew if I dont like you  
with one rhyme I subdue my adversaries are through  
Im the best fascinatin my names Cool J  
Im the royalty of rap what else can I say  
Experienced rhyme skilled plus my voice isnt waxed  
Funky fresh party rocker so lets face facts  
Ill dust a rapper off if I require practice  
Vocal cords so rough that I can eat cactus  
Choreographer of rhymes best of all times  
Composition technician with the be boys mind  
Terrorizin emcees instructions in my path  
Make your girlfriend ask me for my autograph

He makes my rhymes so fresher my beat expands  
So Ill like you to meet him but dont attempt to beat him  
A Five Man Crew me and him will defeat them  
Hell scratch and wipe out all foes  
Turntable terrorizin and I think you should know  
That were high calibered and my names J  
And for all you sucker crews its Judgment Day  
To ring this encounter Im your rhyme sayer  
I have to say it girls but yes Im a player  
Materials royal Im anating all  
Like brown with dimples and Im sixfeet tall  
And promoter of recordings that I call my own  
And Ill love to take one of you ladies home  
Ill complete and clear infiltratin your ears  
My literature is above Shakespeare  
Emcee a sucker natter and I just wont stop  
Im the author and the designer of the jam youll rock

And the world is glad that Cool J came  
Youll rock  
  
Now Im a dedicate this rhyme to my favorite street  
You think about it everytime that you hear this beat  
Any other jam you hear just disregard  
This is the National Anthem of the Boulevard  
See Im loyal to the bully cause it tought me the deal  
Certainly the place to be and thats how I feel  
Farmers Boulevard ELove and me Cool J  
In the center of it all is a cute 3A  
Fortyseven will surrender till emcees in fear  
Queens Boulevard is soft they dont come around here  
Quick as Ls on my face I will hold my space  
And to taste stimulate and conduct the bait  
Youll rock  
  
Now Ima kick it for the beat check complete my mission  
Subtractin emcees like a mathematician  
Jammin up the board at the rappin commission  
Soul inventor of this composition  
I disintegrate rappers I can and I could  
Degrade egg your Al and Ol couldnt write this good  
But Im the Warlord of rap with my own army  
Japans whole military couldnt disarm me  
Super bad coldcrushed number one be boy  
Like a paintin from Picasso Im the real McCoy  
CrownPrince of rappin Godfather of bees  
Emcees that need a new lady to feed
