Maybe tomorrow I wont go home maybe she wont even care  
At seven shell throw a kiss towards the door and smile at my empty chair  
For theres nothing there for a man to cling to nothing to pull me back home  
Only a girl thats a stranger to me breathing on flames that are gone  
Home isnt where I hang up my hat every night  
  
And home isnt anything like cold arms holding me tight thats not right  
And home isnt some place to go just to feel all alone thats not home  
Maybe she might never see me again maybe thats the best way  
Ill join myself to some south blowing wind leave her to find her own way  
And maybe Ill find home someday
