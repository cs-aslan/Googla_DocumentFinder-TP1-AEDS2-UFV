Tomorrow mornin if you wake up  
And the sun does not appear  
II will be here  
If in the dark we lose sight of love  
Hold my hand and have no fear  
Cause II will be here  
I will be here  
When you feel like bein quiet  
When you need to speak your mind  
I will listen  
  
And I will be here  
When the laughter turns to cryin  
Through the winnin and losin and tryin  
Well be together  
Cause I will be here  
  
Tomorrow mornin if you wake up  
And the future is unclear  
IIll be here  
Just as sure as seasons are made for change  
Our lifetimes are made for years  
II will be here  
  
I will be here  
You can cry on my shoulder  
When the mirror tells us were older  
I will hold you  
  
And I will be here  
To watch you grow in beauty  
And tell you all the things you are to me  
I will be here  
  
I will be true  
To the promise I have made  
To you and to the  
One who gave you to me  
  
II will be here  
And just as sure as seasons are made for change  
Our lifetimes are made for years  
Cause I  
I will be here  
Well be together forever  
  
Cause I will be here  
I will be here
