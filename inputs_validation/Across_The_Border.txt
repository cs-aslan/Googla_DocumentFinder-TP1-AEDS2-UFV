Bruce Springsteen  
  
Tonight my bag is packed  
Tommorrow Ill walk these tracks  
That will lead me across the border  
Tommorrow my love and I  
Will sleep neath auburn skies  
Somewhere across the border  
  
Well leave behind my dear  
The pain and sadness we found here  
And well drink from the Brazos muddy waters  
Where the sky grows gray and wide  
Well meet on the other side  
There across the border  
  
For me youll build a house  
High up on a grassy hill  
Somewhere across the border  
Where pain and memory  
Pain and memory have been stilled  
There across the border  
  
And sweet blossoms fill the air  
Pastures of gold and green  
Roll down into cool clear waters  
And in your arms neath the open skies  
Ill kiss the sorrow from your eyes  
There across the border  
  
Tonight well sing the songs  
Ill dream of you my Corazon  
And tommorrow my heart will be strong  
And may the saints blessing and grace  
Carry me safely into your arms  
There across the border  
  
For what are we  
Without hope in our hearts  
That someday well drink from Gods blessed waters  
And eat the fruit from the vine  
I know love and fortune will be mine  
Somewhere across the border
