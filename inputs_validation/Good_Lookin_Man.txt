Ive been catchin a glance do you like what you see  
Even across the rrom your eyes been talkin to me  
Easy to tell youve turned some heads  
In your day  
Hopin youll choose the next slow dance  
To walk my way  
  
Nothin like a good lookin  
Good lookin man  
More bout you than meets the eye  
I want to know first hand  
Baby Ive got this strong feelin  
Strong as a woman can  
Im lookin into the face of love  
And its a good lookin man  
  
Hod did you get sweet fit  
Right in each of thos arms  
Talkin as if were all alone  
Workin your charm  
Im likin that edgy temper  
You try not to show  
Notice the shyness in the way  
You smile real slow  
  
Nothin like a good lookin  
Good lookin man  
More bout you than meets the eye  
I want to know first hand  
Baby Ive got this strong feelin  
Strong as a woman can  
Im lookin into the face of love  
And its a good lookin man  
  
Come a little closer   
Closer yet   
The longer and longer Im with you  
The better and better you get  
  
Nothin like a good lookin  
Good lookin man  
More bout you than meets the eye  
I want to know first hand  
Baby Ive got this strong feelin  
Strong as a woman can  
Im lookin into the face of love  
And its a good lookin man  
  
Come a little closer   
Closer yet   
Oooooooh Closer yet   
Closer yet
