Ive got a Dungeon Masters Guide  
Ive got a twelvesided die  
Ive got Kitty Pryde  
And Nightcrawler too  
Waiting there for me  
Yes I do I do  
Ive got posters on the wall  
My favorite rock group Kiss  
Ive got Ace Frehley  
Ive got Peter Criss  
Waiting there for me  
Yes I do I do  
  
Chorus  
In the garage  
I feel safe  
No one cares about my ways  
In the garage  
Where I belong  
No one hears me sing this song  
In the garage  
  
Ive got an electric guitar  
I play my stupid songs  
I write these stupid words  
And I love every one  
Waiting there for me  
Yes I do I do  
  
Chorus Repeat 3X
