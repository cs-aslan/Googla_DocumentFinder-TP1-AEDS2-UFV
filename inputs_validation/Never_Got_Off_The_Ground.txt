My father was a farmer  
But his head was in the sky  
He worked everyday but Sunday  
Til the day he died  
  
He prayed for rain and thunder  
And listened for the sound  
In the dry years he went under  
He never got off the ground  
  
We all dream when were younger  
That we will do great things  
Me I used to have a hunger  
To wear a pilots wings  
  
But the circles that I ran in  
Turned my head around  
And the planes I had my plans in  
Never got off the ground  
  
Dont raise your hopes  
You hear so many say  
The higher they get  
The closer they are to flying away  
Fly away  
  
Dont raise your hopes  
You hear so many say  
The higher they get  
The closer they are to flying away  
  
They say there but for fortune  
Is the way it would have been  
If we could take a bigger portion  
Wed fill our hands again  
  
You see them on the sidewalks  
In the parks all over town  
Those whove taken flight  
Never got off the ground
