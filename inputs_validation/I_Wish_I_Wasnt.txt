First Verse  
Im home alone again  
And youre out hanging with your friends  
So you say but I know its not quite that way  
Its getting pretty late and you havent checked on me all day  
When I called you didnt answer  
Now Im feeling like youre ignoring me  
  
I wish that you were home  
Holding me tight in your arms  
And I wish I could go back  
To the day before we met and skip my regret  
  
Chorus  
  
I wish I wasnt in love with you  
So you couldnt hurt me  
It just aint fair the way you treat me  
No you dont deserve me  
Wasted my time thinking about you and you aint never gone change  
I wish I wasnt in love with you  
So I wouldnt feel this way  
  
Verse 2  
When you touch me my heart melts  
And everything you did wrong I forgive  
So you play me and take advantage  
Of the love that I feel for you  
Why you wanna hurt me so bad  
I believed in you thats why Im so mad  
Now Im drowning in disappointment and its hard for me to even look at you  
  
I wish that you were home  
Holding me tight in your arms ooh baby  
I wish I could go back  
To the day before we met and skip my regret  
  
Bridge  
Said you care about me but from what I see  
I aint feeling that so I disagree  
Gave you all my love and understanding and you treated me like your enemy  
So leave me alone dont want nothing from you  
Just go back where you came from this house is no longer your home  
You you are not welcome no more  
  
Chorus repeat 2x  
  
Outro  
I hear you knocking at my door again  
Im wondering should I let you in  
I open up the door and see the flowers for me  
So beautiful in your hands  
You start begging me to take you back  
Ive always been a sucker for romance  
And before you know it I can see youre all over me  
Oh no here I go again  
  
I wish I wasnt in love with you so you couldnt hurt me
