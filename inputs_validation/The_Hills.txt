Verse 1  
Your man on the road he doing promo  
You said keep our business on the lowlow  
Im just tryna get you out the friendzone  
Cause you look even better than the photos  
I cant find your house send me the info  
Driving through the gated residential  
Found out I was coming sent your friends home  
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know  
  
Chorus  
I only call you when its half past five  
The only time that Ill be by your side  
I only love it when you touch me not feel me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me yeah  
I only call you when its halfpast five  
The only time Id ever call you mine  
I only love it when you touch me not feel me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me babe  
  
Verse 2  
Ima let you know and keep it simple  
Tryna keep it up dont seem so simple  
I just fucked two bitches fore I saw you  
You gon have to do it at my tempo  
Always tryna send me off to rehab  
Drugs started feelin like its decaf  
Im just tryna live life for the moment  
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

Hills have eyes the hills have eyes  
Who are you to judge who are you to judge  
Hide your lies girl hide your lies  
Who are you to trust who are you
