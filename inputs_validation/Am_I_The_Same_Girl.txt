Why dont you stop  
And look me over  
Am I the same girl  
You used to know  
Why dont you stop  
And think it over  
Am I the same girl  
Whom you hurt so  
  
Im the one you want  
And Im the one you need  
Im the one you love  
The one you used to meet  
Around the corner everyday  
We would meet and slip away  
But we were much too young  
To love each other this way  
  
Am I the same girl  
Yes I am yes I am  
Am I the same girl  
Yes I am yes I am  
  
Why dont you stop  
And look me over  
Am I the same girl  
You used to know  
Why dont you stop  
And think it over  
Am I the same girl  
Whom you hurt so  
  
Im the one you hurt  
And Im the one you need  
Im the one who cried  
The one you used to need  
But you are pretending you dont care  
But the fire ahh is still there  
But we are no longer too young  
To love each other this way  
  
Am I the same girl  
Yes I am yes I am  
Am I the same girl  
Yes I am yes I am  
Oh yes I am  
  
Am I the same girl  
Yes I am yes I am  
Am I the same girl yeah  
Yes I am yes I am  
Oh yes I am  
Am I the same girl  
Yes I am yes I am  
Oh baby yes I am
