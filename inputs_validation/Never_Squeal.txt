Never squeal on the pusher  
Dont lie to your mama  
Just do what you want to and itll be okay  
Dont swim in the water  
Dont fly in the daytime  
Just do what you want to and itll be okay  
  
Never smuggle no candy  
Cant be whatcha want to  
When you hafta go  
Down to the darkest places  
Yeah youre gonna be okay  
  
Dont say whats really on your mind  
Gotsta give it just a little more time  
And try to remember this rhyme and youll be okay  
  
Now I know I turn you on  
And I think you and I could get along  
Dont dont get me wrong you gonna be alright  
  
Say it with me now  
Never squeal on the pusher  
Dont lie to your mama  
Just do what you want to and itll be okay  
  
Never squeal on the pusher  
Dont lie to your mama  
Just do what you want to and itll be okay  
Dont swim in the water  
Dont fly in the daytime  
Just do what you want to and itll be okay
