Warning sign warning sign  
I see it but I pay it no mind  
Hear my voice hear my voice  
Its saying something and I hope youre concentrating  
Ive got money now Ive got money now  
Cmon baby cmon baby  
  
Warning sign of things to come take it over take it over  
Someones talking on my telephone when were older when were older  
Hear my voice move my hair  
I move it around a lot but I dont care what I remember  
  
Warning sign warning sign  
Look at my hair I like the design  
Its the truth its the truth  
Your glassy eyes and your open mouth  
Take it easy take it easy  
Its a natural thing and you have to relax  
Ive got money now Ive got money now  
Cmon baby cmon baby  
Warning sign of things to come turn me over turn me over  
Love is here but I guess its gone now hurry up babe hurry up babe  
Hear my voice move my hair  
I move it around a lot but I dont care  
  
Do you remember  
What it is that you remember  
Baby remember  
Baby remember
