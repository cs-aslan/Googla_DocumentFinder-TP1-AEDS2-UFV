So now its getting late for those who hesitate got no one  
But they dont understand and no one hears the sound  
Its like a waterfall its an illusion  
  
Chorus  
Love is all waterfall love is what you are  
Pulls you in takes you down its a sad affair  
But you know as you hold back the power there without the friends  
And lovers you could never go on living  
  
Across the waterfall thats falling evermore down on you  
Cascading through the days and flowing on its way  
Thats how it has to be just an illusion  
  
Chorus
