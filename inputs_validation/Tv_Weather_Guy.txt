My father was a lawyer moms at university  
My brother and my sister they both have their PhD  
My grampa was a pilot shooting Nazis from t he sky  
But I am the most famous Im a TV weather guy  
  
He smiles at the camera and tells a little joke  
H e always says its sunny if the telestrators broke  
Thinks a meteorologist knows what falls from the sky  
But hes got a steady income as a TV weather guy  
  
They said that Im not qualified to be on the TV  
Dont know Celsius from Fahrenheit so I just say degrees  
I just read the temperatures and make up a bunch of lies  
And end up being right more than the guy on channel five  
  
He smiles at the camera and tells a little joke  
He always says its sunny if the telestrators broke  
Thinks cloud are made from cotton that have blown up to the sky  
But hes got a steady income as a TV weather guy  
  
On Saturdays I must be out of bed by five AM  
Put on a ton of makeup and then stare at the camera lens  
Greeting all the viewers with a Hihihiphello  
Cause its the day I have to host a kiddie cartoon show  
  
He smiles at the camera then to his puppet sock  
He raves about the crayon drawings of the family dog  
Did a promo at the shopping mall and made the children cry  
Hes a lousy clown but a good TV weather guy  
  
They said that Im not cute enough to be an anchorman  
Not tough enough for sports and for the arts I was too bland  
But I know that some day I will reach my TV goal  
When I guest star on Baywatch or 90210  
  
Til then Ill smile at the camera and tell a little joke  
He always says its sunny if the telestrators broke  
He wonders why big storms are always named for other guys  
But hes got a steady income as a TV weather guy  
Hes got a steady income as a TV weather guy
