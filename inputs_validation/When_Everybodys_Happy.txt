Can you imagine  
The world at peace  
What would it be like  
Can you imagine  
  
Such harmony  
And what will happen  
When everybodys happy  
But me  
  
Can you imagine  
This headache I have  
Writing this song  
Can you imagine  
  
The storm inside  
And the quiet  
When everybodys happy  
But me  
  
I think that I would really  
Like to love  
Give and receive  
I pray that my spirit  
  
May rise above  
And Ill live a good life  
When everybodys happy  
But me
