Darkness in the morning  
Shadows on the land  
Certain individuals  
Arent sticking with the plan  
  
And Im searching for a heart  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You cant start it like a car  
You cant stop it with a gun  
  
Leaving in the evening  
Traveling at night  
Staying inconspicuous  
Im staying out of sight  
  
And Im searching for a heart  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You cant start it like a car  
You cant stop it with a gun  
  
They tell you love requires a little standing in line  
And Ive been waiting for you lover for a long long time  
Ive been pacing the floor Ive been watching the door  
Meanwhile Ill keep searching for a heart  
  
Ive been searching high and low for you  
Trying to track you down  
Certain individuals  
Have finally come around  
  
And Im searching for a heart  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You cant start it like a car  
You cant stop it with a gun  
  
They tell you love requires a little standing in line  
And Ive been waiting for you lover for a long long time  
Ive been pacing the floor Ive been watching that door  
Meanwhile Ill keep searching for a heart  
  
Searching everyone  
They say love conquers all  
You cant start it like a car  
You cant stop it with a gun  
  
They say love conquers all  
You cant start it like a car  
You cant stop it with a gun  
Searching for a heart
