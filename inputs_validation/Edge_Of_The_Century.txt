Living on the edge of the century  
  
See the world in revolution  
Spinning faster all the time  
Were heading for the end of something  
Just about to step across that line  
Oh cant you see  
Were staring in the face of reality  
Oh you and me  
Were living on the edge of the century  
  
Feel the way the earth is shaking  
Hear the rumble miles away  
Say goodbye to Checkpoint Charlie  
Walls are falling every day  
Oh cant you see  
Every step we take were making history  
Oh you and me  
Were living on the edge of the century  
  
Feel the way the earth is shaking  
Fires and floods and hurricanes  
A voice cries out in revelation  
Say hello to Y2K  
Oh cant you see  
Were jumpin on the ledge of uncertainty  
Oh you and me  
Were living on the edge of the century  
  
Cant turn off the information  
Cant sit back in your easy chair  
Cant ignore a generation  
Better get ready cause were almost there  
  
Were moving at the speed of life  
Into a brave new world where the strong will survive  
The dawns gonna break and Ill meet you  
On the other side  
  
Cant stand still while the earth is turning  
Cant take cover til the coast is clear  
Cant play guitar while Rome is burning  
Look our now cause the futures here  
  
And were moving at the speed of life  
Living on the edge  
On the edge of the century
