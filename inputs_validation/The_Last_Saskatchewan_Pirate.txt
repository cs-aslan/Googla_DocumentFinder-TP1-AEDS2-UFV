I used to be a farmer and I made a living fine  
I had a little stretch of land along the CP Line  
But times were hard and though I tried the money wasnt there  
And bankers came and took my land and told me fair is fair  
  
I looked for every kind of job the answer always no  
Hire you now theyd always laugh we just let twenty go  
The government they promised me a measly little sum  
But Ive got too much pride to end up just another bum  
  
Then I thought who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone  
Im gonna be a pirate on the river Saskatchewan  
  
Cause its a heaveho highho coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And its a hohey highhey farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Reginas mighty shores  
  
Youd think the local farmers would know that Im at large  
But just the other day I saw an unsuspecting barge  
I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser  
I rammed their ship and sank it and I stole their fertilizer  
  
A bridge outside of Moose Jaw spans a mighty river  
Farmers cross in so much fear their stomachs are aquiver  
Cause they know that Tractor Jack is waiting in the bay  
Ill jump the bridge and knock them cold and sail off with their hay  
  
Cause its a heaveho highho coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And its a hohey highhey farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Reginas mighty shores  
  
Well Mountie Bob he chased me he was always at my throat  
He followed on the shoreline cause he didnt own a boat  
But cutbacks were acoming and the Mountie lost his job  
So now hes sailing with me and we call him Salty Bob  
  
A swinging sword a skullandbones and pleasant company  
I never pay my income tax and screw the GST Screw it  
Prince Albert down to Saskatoon the terror of the sea  
If you want to reach the Coop boy you gotta get by me  
  
Cause its a heaveho highho coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And its a hohey highhey farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Reginas mighty shores  
  
Well pirate lifes appealing but you dont just find it here  
I heard that in Alberta theres a band of buccaneers  
They roam the Athabasca from Smith to Fort McKay  
And youre bound to lose your Stetson if you have to pass their way  
  
Well winter is acoming and a chill is in the breeze  
My pirate days are over once the river starts to freeze  
Ill be back in springtime but now Ive got to go  
I hear theres lots of plundering down in New Mexico  
  
Cause its a heaveho highho coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And its a hohey highhey farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Reginas mighty shores  
  
Cause its a heaveho highho coming down the Plains  
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains  
And its a hohey highhey farmers bar your doors  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Reginas mighty shores  
When you see the Jolly Roger on Reginas mighty shores
