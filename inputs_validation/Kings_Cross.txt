The man at the back of the queue was sent  
To feel the smack of firm government  
Linger by the flyposter for a fight  
Its the same story every night  
Ive been hurt and weve been had  
You leave home and you dont go back  
  
Someone told me Monday someone told me Saturday  
Wait until tomorrow and theres still no way  
Read it in a book or write it in a letter  
Wake up in the morning and theres still no guarantee  
  
Only last night I found myself lost  
By the station called Kings Cross  
Dead and wounded on either side  
You know its only a matter of time  
Ive been good and Ive been bad  
Ive been guilty of hanging around  
  
Someone told me Monday someone told me Saturday  
Wait until tomorrow and theres still no way  
Read it in a book or write it in a letter  
Wake up in the morning and theres still no guarantee  
  
So I went looking out today  
For the one who got away  
Murder walking round the block  
Ending up in Kings Cross  
Good luck bad luck waiting in a line  
It takes more than the matter of time  
  
Someone told me Monday someone told me Saturday  
Wait until tomorrow and theres still no way  
Read it in a book or write it in a letter  
Wake up in the morning and theres still no guarantee  
  
Someone told me Monday someone told me Saturday  
Wait until tomorrow and theres still no way  
Read it in a book or write it in a letter  
Wake up in the morning and theres still no guarantee  
And theres still no guarantee  
There is still no guarantee
