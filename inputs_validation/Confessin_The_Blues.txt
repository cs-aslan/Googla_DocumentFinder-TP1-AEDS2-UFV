Baby here I stand before you  
With my heart in my hand  
I put it to you mama  
Hoping that youll understand  
  
Oh baby  
Mama please dont dog me round  
Yeah I I would rather love you baby  
Than anyone else I know in town  
  
This is my confession Mama  
And its sung by all your song  
It proves that Im in heaven Mama  
When you hold me in your arms  
  
Well baby  
Can I have you for myself  
Yeah if I cant have you baby  
I dont want nobody else  
  
Well baby  
Dont you want a man like me  
Well baby  
Dont you want a man like me  
Yeah think about your future baby  
Forget about your used to be
