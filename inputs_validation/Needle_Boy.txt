At the turn of the century I did many things to protect myself  
I did many things to protect myself  
I made myself a needleboy  
And I Hid him in the closet  
And I made myself a moneyman  
And I hid him underneath the mattress  
I made myself a spiderchild  
And I put him in a matchbox  
And I forged myself a golden statuette  
And I wrapped him in a hello magazine  
And I hid Im in a wall safe  
And finally I made myself a spadegirl  
And I put her in a garden shed  
All to protect myself you see  
From the demon that was coming from the East  
Or from the west  
Then I sat on the rooftop and I waited  
And when at last the demon came  
From the East or from the West  
And awoke me from my sleep  
And awoke me to a particular point of view  
And the needleboy stuck him in the eye  
And the moneyman chocked him with coins  
The spiderchild bit him on the ankle  
And the statuette crashed crashed down upon his head  
And the spadegirl buried him underneath the house  
And I danced on the rooftops  
And I danced on the rooftops  
And I danced to the western world  
And I danced to the western world
