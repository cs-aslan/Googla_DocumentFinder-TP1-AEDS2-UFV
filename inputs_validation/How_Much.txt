The way I feel for you  
I cant describe  
lts almost too intense  
To verbalize  
Essentially youre all  
Im living for  
And basically each day  
I need you more and more  
  
Chorus  
Have you even been so enamored baby  
Thats how much I love you  
All I need in this life you see  
Is me and my boyfriend  
Have you ever feint lost  
When you know you gotta leave me  
Thats how much I love you  
  
Love is yours and mine  
Till the very end  
Just me and my boyfriend  
  
Dont underestimate the love in me  
Its obvious these feelings run so deep  
I fall and fall for you day after day  
Nobody else could ever take your place  
  
Chorus  
  
You dont gotta waste your time and worry  
You dont gotta look for reassurance  
Cause clearly youre the only one thats getting this and  
Sugar I dont need nobody else  
But you  
And honey I aint letting go too soon  
Because 1 cant get enough  
Why you asking how much  
Its more than you can handle baby  
  
Chorus
