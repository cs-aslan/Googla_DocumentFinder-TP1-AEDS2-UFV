Just like a buzzin fly  
I come into your life  
Now I float away  
Like honey in the sun  
Was it right or wrong  
I couldnt sing that song anyway  
  
Oh but darlin  
Now I remember  
How the sun shown down  
And how it warmed your prayin smile  
When all the love was there  
  
Youre the one I talk about  
Youre the one I think about  
Everywhere I go  
And sometimes honey  
In the mornin  
Lord I miss you so  
  
Thats how I know I found a home  
Thats how I know I found a home  
  
Oh hear the mountains singing  
Lord I can hear them ringing darlin  
Out your name  
And tell me if you know  
Just how the river flows  
Down to the sea  
  
Now I want to know  
Everything about you  
I want to know  
Everything about you  
  
What makes ya smile  
What makes ya wild  
What makes ya love me this way  
Darlin I want to know  
Darlin I want to know  
  
Youre the one I talk about  
Youre the one I think about  
Everywhere I go  
And sometimes honey  
In the mornin  
Lord I miss you so  
  
Thats how I know I found a home  
Thats how I know I found a home  
  
Awalkin hand in hand  
And all along the sand  
A seabird knew your name  
He knew your love was growin  
Lord I think it knows its flowin  
through you and me  
  
Ah tell me darlin  
When I should leave you  
Ah tell me darlin  
I dont want to grieve you  
  
Just like a buzzin fly  
I come into your life  
Now I float away  
Like honey in the sun  
Was it right or wrong  
I couldnt sing that song anyway  
  
Oh but darlin  
Now I remember  
How the sun shown down  
And how it warmed your prayin smile  
When all the love was there  
  
Youre the one I talk about  
Youre the one I think about  
Everywhere I go  
And sometimes honey  
In the mornin  
Lord I miss you so
