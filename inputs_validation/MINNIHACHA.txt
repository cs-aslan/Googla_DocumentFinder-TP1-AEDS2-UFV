MINNIHACHA  
WRITERS HANK WILLIAMS FRED ROSE BETTIE WESTERGARD TOMMY COLLINS  
Minnihacha was the name of the maid  
That was old Kawligas gal  
The customer took far far away  
But Kawligas with her now  
Minnihacha  
She left a trail for ol wooden head to find  
Now ol Kawligas with her all the time  
She dropped her beads along the way  
To make a trail for him  
She knew if ol Kawliga stayed her life would be so grim  
Minnihacha  
How she loved that poor ol wooden head  
The man of knotty pine with a face so red  
Minnihacha  
Years have passed and now at last they got Papoose by the score  
Kawliga beats his old tom tom while she sweeps the floor  
Minnihacha  
She works her fingers to the bone  
While ol Kawliga sings an Indian song  
Minnihacha  
Now youve heard the story about a wooden head affair  
An Indian with a tomahawk and a maiden with the coal black hair  
Minnihacha  
Theyre as happy as anyone can be  
Cause theyre together and have a family  
Minnihacha
