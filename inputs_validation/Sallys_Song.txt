I sense theres something in the wind  
That seems like tragedys at hand  
And though Id like to stand by him  
Cant shake this feeling that I have  
The worst is just around the bend  
  
And does he notice my feelings for him  
And will he see how much he means to me  
I think its not to be  
  
What will become of my dear friend  
Where will his actions lead us then  
Although Id like to join the crowd  
In their enthusiastic cloud  
Try as I may it doesnt last  
  
And will we ever end up together  
No I think not its never to become  
For I am not the one  
  
And will we ever end up together  
No I think not its never to become  
For I am not the one
