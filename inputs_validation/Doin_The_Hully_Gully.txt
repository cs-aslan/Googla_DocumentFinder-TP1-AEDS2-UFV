Way down in the country where the cotton really grows  
Lives a little country boy with rhythm in his soul  
He learned the hully gully and he learned it fine  
He had the cottonpickin women just astandin in a line  
Doin the hully gully thats what they say everyday  
In the water near the beach where the people love to go  
Lived a maneatin shark name of Nagatoyo  
He saw the people hully gully left to right  
He swam back to the ocean cause he lost his appetite  
They did the hully gully thats what they say everyday  
  
Way out in the desert where the hazard wind blows  
Lived a crosseyed camel with prickles on his nose  
He learned the hully gully learned to shake it fine  
He had a hot pack of camels just a los in their mind  
Doin the hully gully thats what they say everyday  
Everyday yepyep everyday
