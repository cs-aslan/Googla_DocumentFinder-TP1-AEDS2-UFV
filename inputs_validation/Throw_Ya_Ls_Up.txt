Hot fire hot  
  
Chorus  
L Who bring you the hotness  
L Yo you dont want to start with  
L Forever keeping it locked  
Its now time to rock with L throw your Ls up  
  
Dont ever underestimate the Jack the Ripper  
Be clear every time he reappears its sicker  
Listen here the mind expanded the vision is slicker  
Im long range like a missile many styles to getcha  
Tear ya out the frame so the hood can get the picture  
But Id rather break bread kick knowledge and get some money witcha  
Im willing and able to smooth pounds out like Witch Hazel  
The legend is real Im not a fable  
Captivated the screen Im Queens Clark Gable  
If it aint a joint bet your label dont put it on the table  
Im out for the moolah throw better hooks than David Tua  
Whos the nicest L you are  
  
Chorus x2  
  
You dont want it with L bship catsll get banged out  
Put your flow throw a filter boy shake the old slang out  
23s in the building watch my tongue hang out  
Makin MCs scatter like multiple shots rang out  
Day one since I came out they cant put the flame out  
My temp seizing perfect reason to blow the game out  
Skating off in the Navi naw baby you cant have me  
But I know cats will pay for that n lace ya yeah gladly  
Warning young rappers you dont want a career  
Yall want to keep going platinum yall dont want to disappear  
Stop bopping backstage like you causing me fear  
Cause you starting to get on my nerves and thats a problem  
The vets in here  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Tension on the mic halftime highlights  
L Boogie banging on em jumpin through the skylight  
You stand corrected Im hot so get it riddight  
Im just spitting when the middick is gripped I spit it tiddight  
Alright Oh these various rappers is so hilarious  
Who put the mic down but yall aint qualified to carry this  
Your tracks are garbage and bars are miscellaneous  
So throwing your joint at my car was spontaneous  
Oh I cant take it why must they fake it  
Flows is fully dressed yours is butt naked  
Forever I will be the one they came to see  
Blowing mics in half baby who else could it be but  
  
Chorus x4

We so hot yeah  
You so hot Im so hot  
Feel it hot yeah  
Are you hot you make me hot  
I know Im hot oh
