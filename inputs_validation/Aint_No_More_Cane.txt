Aint no more cane on the Brazos  
Oh oh oh oh  
Its all been ground down to molasses  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
You shoulda been on the river in 1910  
They were driving the women just like they drove the men  
  
Go down Old Hannah doncha rise no more  
Dont you rise up til Judgment Days for sure  
  
Aint no more cane on the Brazos  
Its all been ground down to molasses  
  
Captain dont you do me like you done poor old Shine  
Well ya drove that bully til he went stone blind  
  
Wake up on a lifetime hold up your own head  
Well you may get a pardon and then you might drop dead  
  
Aint no more cane on the Brazos  
Its all been ground down to molasses
