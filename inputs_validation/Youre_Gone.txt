Youre gone As suddenly as you came to me  
Like nightfall followed dawn without a day between  
Youre gone and suddenly I cant see  
Im in the shadow of you  
Im in the shadow of you  
  
I can see you in my minds rosetinted eye  
Somewhere youre drifting by  
Your heels rolling sparks on the lucky street  
  
While here am I left behind  
Stunned and blind  
But I can see you from here  
I can see you so clear  
  
You are the light  
You are the light  
You have the day  
I have the night  
But we have the early hours together  
  
Youre gone and heaven cries  
A thunderstorm breaks from the northern sky  
Chasing you back to the daily grind  
  
Youre gone And where am I  
A haunted life  
The ghost of your laughter  
The halfempty glass  
The halfempty glass  
  
And I wait  
Til midnight tolls  
Two souls almost touching in the dark  
Ill be allright  
  
You are the light  
You are the light  
You have the day  
I have the night  
But we have the early hours  
We have the early hours  
We have the early hours together
