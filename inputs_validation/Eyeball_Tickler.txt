Listen to the monkey  
Feeding on your brain  
I feel okay  
No pain  
  
Im tired of shocking junkie  
Suckin on your veins  
Forget no ways  
No ways  
  
Im tired of running hunchback  
Ive been tripping now for days  
And there is no way  
You dont say  
  
I got my drip drab velcro moustache  
Keeps them all at bay  
Get yours some day  
Oh yeah  
  
Cause we dont love our paycheck  
Battle up your date  
Dont get no love  
No love  
  
Double takes for feeling  
And empty realities  
Cause cant get no love  
Get no love  
  
Come on like eyeball tickler  
Get up of your knees  
And smile above  
Above  
  
Listen to the monkey  
Feeding on your brain  
I feel okay  
No pain  
  
Im tired of shocking junkie  
Suckin on your veins  
Forget no ways  
No ways  
  
Desire all you want  
But you got what you need  
Not too much  
Too much
