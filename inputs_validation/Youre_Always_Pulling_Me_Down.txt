I thought I knew you well your right and wrong  
Thought I could steal your secrets and put them in a song  
I thought that youd be waiting patiently for me  
That only I could see  
  
You build me up and tell me lies  
You hold my hand say close your eyes  
  
Chorus  
Youre always pulling me down  
You make me lower my expectations  
Youre always pulling me down  
Why do you complicate situations  
Youre always pulling me down  
  
I dont know what else to do  
Im still in love with you  
  
I wish that I could see things through your eyes  
I want to lift the veil and penetrate your lies  
I want to take your truth and hold it in my hand  
Maybe then Ill understand  
  
You contradict in a thousand ways  
You call the tune and guess who pays
