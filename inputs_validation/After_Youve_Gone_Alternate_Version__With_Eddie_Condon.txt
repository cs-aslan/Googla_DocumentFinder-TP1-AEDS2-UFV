After youve gone and left me crying  
After youve gone theres no denying  
Youll feel blue youll feel sad  
Youll miss the dearest pal youve ever had  
  
Therell come a time and I dont forget it  
Therell come a time when you regret it  
Someday when you grow lonely  
Your heart will break like mine and youll want me only  
  
After youve gone  
After youve gone  
  
After youve gone and left me crying  
After youve gone theres no denying  
Youll feel blue youll feel sad  
Youll miss the dearest pal youve ever had  
  
Therell come a time and I dont forget it  
Therell come a time when you regret it  
Someday when you grow lonely  
Your heart will break like mine and youll want me only  
  
After youve gone  
After youve gone away so far away  
After youve gone  
After youve gone away
