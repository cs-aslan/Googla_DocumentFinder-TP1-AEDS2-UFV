Dont misunderstand me I was just a little kid  
Thinking that the street life was the only way to live  
Always holding out for another thrill  
  
Weve come a long long way  
So tell me why cant we settle for love  
Is it that hard at the end of the day  
Tell me why cant we settle for love before its too late  
  
Whatever it is you think youre missing  
Time to let your heart go  
Cause when youve walked this kind of distance  
We cant fool each other anymore  
Maybe there is a light that wont go out  
  
Weve come a long long way  
So tell me why cant we settle for love  
Is it that hard at the end of the day  
Tell me why cant we settle for love before its too late
