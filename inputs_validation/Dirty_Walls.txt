So you feel that stain of dried up discussions without weight  
Its that feeling you will not have to destroy  
Its that feeling that you will not have to ignore  
The dirty walls  
So youve been plagued but is everything okay  
I cannot bear the shallow words they throw  
Its that feeling that you will not have to employ  
Its that feeling that you will not  
Its got to go  
This conversation is going nowhere  
Its transparent as fuck  
This conversation must be over  
Because all I see is mud
