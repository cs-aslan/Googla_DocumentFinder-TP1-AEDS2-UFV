When the wind is howling through your window pane  
Its not the only pain of the night  
Your burning up in your bed you gotta fever of love  
And theres not an antibody insight  
Hey jenny jenny why are you crying  
Theres a beauty of a moon in the sky  
But I guess when youve been leading such a sheltered life  
You never lift your head and look so high  
  
You dont have a lot  
But its all that youve got  
And you can turn it into more than it seems  
Just give it a shot  
Fantasize every movement  
And imagine every inch of your dreams  
  
And no one said it had to be real  
But its gotta be something you can reach out and feel now  
It aint right  
It aint fair  
Castles fall in the sand  
And we fade in the air  
And the good girls go to heaven but the bad girls go everywhere  
Ooh now good girls go to heaven but the bad girls go everywhere  
Sombody told me so  
Somebody told me now I know  
Every night in my prayers  
Ill be praying  
That the good girls go to heaven but the bad girls go everywhere  
  
When the sweat is sizzling  
On you skin in the dark  
And your desperate now for somewhere to turn  
  
Every muscles in rebellion  
Every nerve is on edge  
And every limb is being erotically burned  
  
Hey johnny johnny why are you shaking  
When a boy should do whatever he can  
Youve been nothing but an angel  
Every day of your life and now you wonder what its like to be bad  
  
You dont have a lot  
But its all that youve got  
And you can turn it into more than it seems  
Just give it a shot  
Fantasize every movement  
And imagine every inch of your dreams  
  
And no one said it had to be real  
But its gotta be something youve been wanting to feel now  
It aint right  
It aint fair  
Castles fall in the sand  
And we fade in the air  
And the good boys go to heaven but the bad boys go everywhere  
Good boys go to heaven but the bad boys go everywhere  
Somebody told me so  
Somebody told me now I know  
Every night in my prayers  
Ill be praying  
That the good boys go to heaven but the bad boys go everywhere  
  
Every time I try and dream you  
I cant believe how hard its been to  
Conjure up your face and trace your body in the air  
All the seconds go on forever  
But the thirds and the forth ones are even better  
And every time I do it just a little bit longer  
Every time I dream its just a little bit stronger than  
Real life  
  
And no one said it had to be real  
But its gotta be something you can reach out and feel now  
It aint right  
It aint fair  
Castles fall in the sand  
And we fade in the air  
And the good girls go to heaven but the bad girls go everywhere  
Ooh now good girls go to heaven but the bad girls go everywhere  
Somebody told me so  
Somebody told me now I know  
Every night in my prayers  
Ill be praying  
That the good girls go to heaven but the bad girls go everywhere
