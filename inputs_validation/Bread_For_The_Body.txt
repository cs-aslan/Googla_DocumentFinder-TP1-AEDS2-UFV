I built my own chains in the land of the free  
A slave to a job that meant nothing to me  
With three shiny new cars and a split level home  
To furnish the tomb I was dying to own  
  
Then one day I wakened with fear in my eye  
Aware of a world that was passing me by  
And I knew that my savings of silver and gold  
Would mean not a thing when my body was cold  
  
Chorus  
Because life is a song for the dying to sing  
And its got to have feeling to mean anything  
And a man can get by without silver or gold  
With bread for the body and song for the soul  
  
Im living my life by the lesson Ive learned  
And not looking back at the bridges Ive burned  
Cause the time that we travel from cradle to grave  
Was meant to be spent and not meant to be saved  
  
And I know there are some who will say Im a fool  
But I dont give a damn for the people that do  
Cause if down in a dungeon is where they belong  
Well thats their misfortune and none of my own  
  
Repeat Chorus
