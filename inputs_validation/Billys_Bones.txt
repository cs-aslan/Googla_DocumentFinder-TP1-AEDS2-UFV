Billy ran around with the rare old crew  
And he knew an arsenal from Tottenham blue  
Wed be a darn sight better of if we knew  
Where Billys bones are resting now  
Billy saw a copper and he hit him in the knee  
And he took him down from six foot to five foot three  
Then he hit him fair and square in the doremi  
That copper wont be having any family  
  
Hey Billy son where are you now  
Dont you know that we need you now  
With a ratata and the old kowtow  
Where are Billys bones resting now  
  
Billy went away with the peacekeeping force  
Cause he liked a bloody good fight of course  
Went away in an old khaki van to the banks of the river Jordan  
Billy saw the Arabs and he had em on the run  
When he got em in the range of his submachine gun  
Then he had the Israelis in his sights went a ratata  
And they ran like Shiites  
  
Hey Billy son where are you now  
Dont you know that we need you now  
With a ratata and the old kowtow  
Where are Billys bones resting now  
  
One night Billy had a rare old time  
Laughing and singing on the Lebanon line  
Came back to camp not looking too pretty  
Never even got to see the holy city  
Now Billys out there in the desert sun  
And his mother cries when the morning comes  
And theres mothers crying all over this world  
For their poor dead darling boys and girls  
  
Hey Billy son where are you now  
Dont you know that we need you now  
With a ratata and the old kowtow  
Where are Billys bones resting now  
  
Have a Billy holiday  
Born on a Monday  
Married on a Tuesday  
Drunk on a Wednesday  
Got plugged on a Thursday  
Sick on a Friday  
Died on a Saturday  
Buried on a Sunday
