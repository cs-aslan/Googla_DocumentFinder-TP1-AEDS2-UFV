Ah yeah  
I want to send this one out to all the jeep lovers worldwide  
City to city ghetto to ghetto  
Some flavor for you and yours  
And your jeep  
  
Youre the type of girl that got class and style  
Still in all you need the backseat of my jeep once in a while  
So I pull up to your door to give you what youre looking for  
Hardcore  
I know you want to come in my jeep  
We can park on a back street  
Youre checkin out my car phone scopin out my jewelry  
Lets do this in a hurry  
Air freshener is kickin drive through for chicken  
I know you need a good stickin  
Thats when I see my man Snoop  
Peace what up kid loungin duke  
As I turn the corner starin in your cornier  
Youre gettin hornier and hornier  
Im pumpin up a blint tape flavor  
Youre legs is incredible I do a double take  
Youre puttin on your lipstick  
I want to give you this big fat yea  
Quick I know a place where we can lounge and cool dont sleep  
where at back seat of my jeep  
  
Chorus  
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an episode  
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an episode  
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an episode  
Back seat of my jeep lets swing an ep  
  
Im pullin over near your building  
I light a candle on the dashboard were chillin  
I knew a girl like you would love a scene like this  
You got class but deep down youre real freakish  
You got it all but you never had a wild episode  
Thats when me and my jeep showed  
Up with the funk in the trunk and  
Hittin it were spunkin  
Ill even get you drunk and tipsy  
Cause I know youre feelin frisky  
You love it cause its wild and risky  
You got your eyes on the hood  
Youre up to no good  
I took you in the back you hoped I would  
You got your black on black so stacked in the back  
While Im pumpin in the CD Ill skip a track  
Windows are foggy  
And uh back seat treats in the streets could be a hobby  
And you aint in between the Isley Brothers sheets  
I give it to you real raw in the backseat  
Thats how you want it dont ya yeah  
Youll tell your girlfriends wont ya nah  
Dont lie  
Take it in your eye why  
So buckle up buckle up  
Whats my name whats my name whats my name whats my name huh  
I never knew a four wheel drive could be so live  
Ill put your numbers in the archives  
So take em off and put them things on the mirror girl  
Its my jeep and your world  
You got it going on lovely time to do the right thing  
cause I can tell you want to swing  
  
Chorus  
  
Were bonin on the dark blocks  
Wearin out the shocks wettin up the dashboard clock  
Seats full of sweat I told ya I would hit it  
Your kitty kitty cat cat was hungry so I fed it  
Workin as a team  
Somebody anybody scream  
Jump with me to the cash bar  
Ill be like Bruce Lee in them skins goin wah  
Damn its so good the mad grip on my tip  
Youre still a nice girl but my jeep makes ya flip  
You go wild and stick your toes on the roof yeah yeah  
Youre so cute wit your gold tooth  
Extensions on the carpet  
That nice round brown is my target  
Its so firm so cushy it makes me feel mushy  
I love it when its pushy  
But dont laugh Im serious with this word up  
The back seat of my jeep is priceless  
Youre climaxin youre climaxin its full action  
You love a good waxin its so relaxin  
  
Give me a hug  
See what Im sayin love  
  
Chorus
