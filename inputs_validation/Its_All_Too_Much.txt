Its all too much for me to see  
The love thats shining all around you  
Its everywhere its what you make  
For us to take each others love  
Its all too much for me to see  
The love thats shining all around me  
The more I am the less I know  
And what I do is live for love  
Hey hey hey hey  
Oh no no no no no  
Yeah hey hey hey  
All right  
Its all too much  
Its all too much  
Its all too much  
Its all too much for me to see  
The love thats shining all around you  
Its everywhere its what you make  
For us to take each others love  
Its all too much for me to see  
The love thats shining all around me  
The more I am the less I know  
And what I do is live for love  
Its all too much  
Its all too much  
Its all too much  
Its all too much
