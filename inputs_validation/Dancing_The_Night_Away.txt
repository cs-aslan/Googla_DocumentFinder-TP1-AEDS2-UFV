Standin beside of the oceaean lookin out across the water  
Everything is beautiful but I still dont feel like I oughta  
Things we wanteed not so long ago  
I got em all now babe but I aint got you no moreore  
  
Still I remember  
The way you held me and all the sweet things you used to say  
When we were two young lovers dancin the night away  
  
I remember everythiing the dresses you used to wearear  
You were so light and graceful you seemed to float right through the airair  
And me I looked so funny dancing but you loved me anyhow  
Now I wish I could find somebody to love me like that now  
  
But I remember  
The way you held me and all the sweet things you used to say  
When we were two young lovers dancin the night away  
  
Standin beside of the ocean lookin out across the bay  
I should look for companionship but it just gets in my wayay  
All the lights are flickering out along the shore  
And I see people dancin there but I just dont dance no more  
  
Oh I remember  
The way you held me and all the sweet things you used to say  
When we were two young lovers dancin the night away  
  
Let me see you dance let me see you daaance  
Ohhhh baby let me see you daance  
I can still see you daance I remember you dancin  
Ohhhh baby let me see you dance  
Come on let me see you dance  
Let me see you let me see you daance daance daance
