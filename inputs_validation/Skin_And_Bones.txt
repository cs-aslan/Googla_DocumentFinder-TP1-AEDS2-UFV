Lately Ive been measuring  
Seems my time is growing thin  
Wind me up and watch me spin  
Watch me spin  
Watch me spin  
  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Dont you know  
  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Dont you know  
  
Im just skin and bones  
  
All worn out and nothing fits  
Brennivin and cigarettes  
More I give the less I get  
But Im all set  
Im all set  
  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Dont you know  
  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Dont you know  
  
Im just skin and bones  
Im just skin and bones  
Im just skin and bones  
Im just skin and bones  
Im just skin and bones  
  
Deep within this frame of mine  
Heart of hearts a valentine  
Tell my mom Im doing fine  
Im doing fine  
Im doing fine  
  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Dont you know  
  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Skin and bones  
Dont you know  
  
Im just skin and bones  
Im just skin and bones  
Im just skin and bones  
Im just skin and bones  
Im just skin and bones
