I was looking at the black and white world  
It seemed so exciting  
If youd only put me back to back with that girl  
When the nights inviting  
With just a little lighting  
Therell never be days like that again  
When I was just a boy and men were men  
You never go from moment to moment  
Youre the living double of a single fiction  
Youre very colourful with your compliments  
As you feel the fingers friction  
Its a freezeframe  
Still its real life  
You dont want to look  
Cause youve seen the film and youve read the book  
I was looking at the black and white world  
Trying to name some pinup  
Those days she was just a beautiful girl  
Now shes framed and hung up  
I thought she was young  
Up until I saw her last night in close detail  
Though they all fade away when youre so pale  
Its more than just a physical attraction  
It starts with a face and ends up a fixation  
But youre never gonna feel a fraction  
Of the way it used to work on your imagination  
When you were looking at the black and white world
