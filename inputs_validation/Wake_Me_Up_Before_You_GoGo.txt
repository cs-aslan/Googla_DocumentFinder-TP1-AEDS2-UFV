You put the boom boom into my heart  
You send my soul sky high when your lovin starts  
Jitterbug into my brain  
Goes bang bang bang till my feet do the same  
  
But somethings bugging me  
Something aint right  
My best friend told me  
Where you were last night  
  
Left me sleeping  
In my bed  
I was dreaming  
But I shouldve been with you instead  
  
Chorus  
Wake me up before you go go  
Dont leave me hanging on like a yoyo  
Wake me up before you go go  
I dont want to miss it when you hit that high  
Wake me up before you go go  
Cause Im not planning on going solo  
Wake me up before you go go  
Take me dancing tonight  
I want to hit that high  
  
You get the gray skies outta my way  
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day  
Turn a mere spark into a flame  
My beats per minute never been the same  
  
Cause youre my lady  
Im your fool  
Makes me crazy  
When you act so cruel  
  
Cmon baby  
Lets not fight  
Well go dancing  
And everything will be alright  
  
Chorus  
  
Cuddle up baby  
Move in tight  
Well go dancing tomorrow night  
  
Its cold out there  
But its warm in bed  
They can dance  
Well stay home instead
