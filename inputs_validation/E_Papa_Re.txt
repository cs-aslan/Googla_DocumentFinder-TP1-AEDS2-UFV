The sun is slowly rising  
The day is just beginning  
Let me take you to a  
Place youve never been to  
Imagine that youre walking  
With me in the jungle  
The natives they are dancing  
And singing to a ritual  
  
E papa re e papa re  
  
The musics getting to you  
Your knees are feeling shaky  
Your mind is getting dizzy  
The spell is taking over  
  
Suddenly you find yourself  
Surrounded by these people  
Aint no use to try and struggle  
You know it would be useless  
Out of nowhere comes their leader  
Commanding all attention  
He signals them to set you free  
But to keep on singing  
  
E papa re e papa re  
  
All around below above  
The magics flowing freely  
Everybodys soaked in sweat  
Drenched by their own feelings  
Incantations cry out loud  
The fire keeps on burning  
Now youre in a time and space  
From where theres no returning
