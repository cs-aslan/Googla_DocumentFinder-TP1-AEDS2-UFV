So you been to school  
For a year or two  
And you know youve seen it all  
In daddys car  
Thinkin youll go far  
Back east your type dont crawl  
  
Play ethnicky jazz  
To parade your snazz  
On your five grand stereo  
Braggin that you know  
How the brothers feel cold  
And the slums got so much soul  
  
Its time to taste what you most fear  
Right guard will not help you here  
Brace yourself my dear  
Brace yourself my dear  
  
Its a holiday in cambodia  
Its tough kid but its life  
Its a holiday in cambodia  
Dont forget to pack a wife  
  
Youre a starbelly sneech  
You suck like a leach  
You want everyone to act like you  
Kiss ass while you bitch  
So you can get rich  
But your boss gets richer off you  
  
Well youll work harder  
With a gun in your back  
For a bowl of rice a day  
Slave for soldiers  
Till you starve  
Then your head is skewered on a stake  
  
Now you can go where people are one  
Now you can go where they get things done  
What you need my son  
What you need my son  
  
Is a holiday in cambodia  
Where people dress in black  
A holiday in cambodia  
Where youll kiss ass or crack  
  
Pol Pot  
  
And its a holiday in cambodia  
Where youll do what youre told  
A holiday in cambodia  
Where the slums got so much soul
