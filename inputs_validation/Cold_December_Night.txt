Stockings are hung with care  
The children sleep with one eye open  
Now theres more than toys at stake  
Cause Im older now but not done hoping  
  
The twinkling of the lights  
A Santa kid whos filled with hustle  
Old saint Nick has taken flight  
With a heart on board so please be careful  
  
Each year I ask for many different things  
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring  
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas  
Theres nothing else that I would need this Christmas  
Wont be wrapped under the tree  
I want something that lasts forever  
So kiss me on this cold December night  
  
A cheer that smells of pine  
A house thats filled with joy and laughter  
The mistletoe says stand in line  
Loneliness is what Ive captured  
Oh but this evening can be a holy night  
  
Lets cozy on up our fireplace  
And dim those Christmas lights  
  
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas  
Theres nothing else that you would need this Christmas  
Wont be wrapped under the tree want something that lasts forever  
So kiss me on this cold December night  
  
They call it the season of giving  
Im here yours for the taking  
They call it the season of giving Im here Im yours  
  
Just fall in love with me this Christmas  
Theres nothing else that we would need this Christmas  
Wont be wrapped under the tree want something that lasts forever  
Cause I dont wanna be alone tonight  
Im wearin our Christmas sweater  
While talking to the mistletoe tonight  
I want something that lasts forever  
So kiss me on this cold December night  
  
They call it the season of giving  
Im here yours for the taking  
They call it the season of giving Im here Im yours
