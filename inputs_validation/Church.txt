Man have you ever really wondered  
Like why are we here What the meaning to all of this  
  
Chorus Big Boi  
Sometimes life can keep you down with your face all in the dirt  
HALLLELUJAH  
Now if you feel that left behind need to get up and go to church  
HALLLELUJAH  
HALLLELUJAH  
HALLLELUJAH  
  
Big Boi  
Big slide into the mode time to drop a load  
My life is going downhill like some cardboard in the snow  
My bank account is frozen I  
dont think that I can get out this hole  
Feel like the figure four leg lock  
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked  
I cant move I cant eat I cant even breathe  
Cant even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds  
No trees no Ps to ease the stress of everyday living  
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they living  
The unforgiven or the unwilling live a life of sinning  
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginning  
  
But what about repentance  
What about the tension  
What about you eating dinner in the devils kitchen  
But what about repentance  
What about committing the same sin  
over and over again and again and ah  
  
Chorus  
Why are we here Huh Huh Huh  
Please tell me what are we here for  
  
Big Boi  
Life is nothing but a dream so peaceful and serene  
Unless youre being evil then you on the devils team  
Well I receive what you want to believe  
But soon youll have to sew those bad seeds  
Please any man can ask to get a pass  
or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance  
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel  
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle  
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle  
Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible  
As you survey the syllables and sentences  
The question that Im merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying  
  
Chorus
