If you can hear this  
Dont assume that Im talking to you  
Yesterday everything I thought I believed in died  
But today is my birthday  
Today is my birthday  
I dont need you  
Ill say it to myself  
It doesnt mean I wont need somebody  
Anyone with half a soul  
Will hear this and theyll never leave me  
  
If you dont know what forever feels like  
Ill show you what it feels like without it  
Ill show you what it feels like without it  
  
This time I wont hesitate  
To kill to protect what I believe in  
This time I wont hesitate  
To kill to protect what I believe in  
  
I can get by now  
Im not really dead  
But I really needed someone to save me  
Leaving me alone to die  
Is worse than having the guts to kill me  
  
If you dont know what forever feels like  
Ill show you what it feels like without it  
Ill show you what it feels like without it  
  
This time I wont hesitate  
To kill to protect what I believe in  
This time I wont hesitate  
To kill to protect what I believe in  
  
Not letting you win  
Wont satisfy me  
Ill teach you about loss
