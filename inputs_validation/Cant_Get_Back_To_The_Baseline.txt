I want more than me and you  
The more I want the more it scares me  
I will put my faith in you  
wont you be my missionary  
I cant  cant get back to the baseline  
Had too much of waiting up  
Had too much of things I tell you  
Its the only way and its love  
Fill my cup oh Ive said too much  
I cant cant get back to the baseline 2x  
Ive been on freight train buzz  
So Im trying to tell you  
the only thing I need is your love  
But I cant4x  
I cant back to the baseline  
Its the way of feeling good  
It is all thats necessary  
I guess that its from above  
Im no fool but I guess too much  
I cant cant get back to the baseline 2x  
Repeat chorus  
Fare you well and I will choose  
When Ive found it I will tell you  
I belong to the same as you  
wont you be my missionary  
I cant cant get back to the baseline 2x
