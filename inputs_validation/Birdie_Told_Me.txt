Birdie told me I must get over you somehow  
And she told me never to think of you right now  
But its hopeless to say how can I forget the way she used to love me  
I think about her in my time know in my mind its over  
  
Looks like falling heaven is calling my name to me  
Funny faces loving the traces left for me  
But its hopeless to say how can I forget the way she used to love me  
I think about her in my time know in my mind its over

Birdie taught me how to get over you
