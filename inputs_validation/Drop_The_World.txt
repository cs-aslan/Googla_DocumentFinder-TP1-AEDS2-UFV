I got ice in my veins blood in my eyes  
Hate in my heart love in my mind  
I seen nights full of pain days are the same  
You keep the sunshine save me the rain  
I search but never find hurt but never cry  
I work and forever try but Im cursed so never mind  
And its worse but better times seem further and beyond  
The top gets higher the more that I climb  
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger  
Tryna get into where I fit in no room for a nigga  
But soon for a nigga it be on mufucka  
Cause all the bullshit it made me strong mufucka  
  
Pick the world up and Im a drop it on your fuckin head yeah  
Bitch Im a pick the world up and Im a drop it on your fuckin head  
And I could die now rebirth motherfucker  
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth motherfucker  
Im gone  
Motherfucker Im gone  
  
Uh I know what they dont wanna tell you  
Just hope youre heavensent and youre hellproof  
II walk up in the world and cut the lights off  
And confidence is a stain they cant wipe off  
Huh my word is my pride  
But wisdom is bleak and thats a word from the wise  
Served to survive murdered and bribed  
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside  
  
So I could pick the world up  
And drop it on yo fuckin head haha  
Bitch Im a pick the world up  
And Im a drop it on your fuckin head yeah  
And I could die now rebirth motherfucker  
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth motherfucker  
Im gone  
Motherfucker Im gone Im gone  
  
It hurts but I never show  
This pain youll never know  
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold  
And frostbit Ive become my backs against the wall  
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream Fuck em all  
  
Man it feels like these walls are closing in  
This roof is caving in up its time to raise it then  
Your days are numbered like pages in  
My book of rhymes got em crooked boy  
This crooked mind of mine got em all  
Shook and scared to look in my eyes  
I stole that fuckin clock I took the time and I  
Came up from behind  
And pretty much snuck up  
And buttfucked this game up  
Better be careful when you bring my name up  
Fuck this fame that aint what  
I came to claim but the game  
Aint gonna be the same on the day that I leave it  
But I swear one way or another Im a make these fuckin haters believe it  
I swear to God wont spare the rod  
Im a man of my word so your fuckin heads better nod  
Or Im a fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody  
Sleep on me that pillow is where your headll lie  
Permanently bitch its beddybye  
This world is my Easter egg yeah prepare to die  
My head is swole my confidence is up  
This stage is my pedestal  
Im unstoppable incredible  
Hope youre trapped in my medicine ball  
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin headll spin dawg  
Ill split your cabbage and lettuce and olives  
Ill fuckin  
  
Pick the world up and Im a drop it on your fuckin head  
Bitch Im a pick the world up and Im a drop it on your fuckin head  
And I could die now Rebirth motherfucker  
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth motherfucker  
Im gone  
Motherfucker Im gone Im gone
