As long as I live all that I receive is what I want to give to you  
I know that if I can stay for a while you will soon love me too  
Lets take a chance at least well learn a lesson  
It beats hanging round waiting for moments that wait into days  
I dont want to love you in two different ways  
  
Do you want to give do you want to give me you whole day and more  
Do you want to give do you want always the key to the door  
Its easy for you talking your way out of all situations  
When you cant see thru and leave it up to me  
And thats what I do  
And thats what I do  
  
  
Love comes to me and leaves me with you  
Love runs thru me in all that you do  
Dont walk away dont leave me standing here  
Thats not the way dont lead me anywhere  
I need you now I need you now  
Dont leave me standing here  
Oh I dont know I just dont know  
Its much too fast for me cant we go slow  
Oh I dont know I just dont know  
What do you want me to do
