If we borrow words  
Theyll have to be returned  
Keeping them would surely be remiss  
The stars have acquiesced  
By giving us this night  
Lets just kiss  
  
Intellect and thought  
Are good enough for some  
Why waste time with all there is to miss  
In our quiet space  
Well babysit the moon  
Lets just kiss  
  
Nothing to erase  
As the hour slows  
Nothing to be judged or tried untrue  
Handed us a case  
What a case to close  
It could take all night before we do  
  
We wont have to try  
Somehow well just know  
A thousand years before us led to this  
When were finally through  
Well usher in the sun  
Lets just kiss
