Chorus  
Ive got to give it up Ive got to give it up  
That stuff  
Ive got to give it up Ive got to give it up  
That stuff  
  
Tell my mama and tell my pa  
That their fine young son didnt get far  
He made it to the end of a bottle  
Sitting in a sleazy bar  
  
He tried hard but his spirit broke  
He tried until he nearly choked  
In the end he lost his  
Bottle drinking alcohol  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell my brother I tried to write and  
Put pen to paper but I was frightened  
I couldnt seem to get the words out right  
Right quite right  
  
Tell my sister Im sinking slow  
Now and again I powder my nose  
In the end I lost my bottle  
It smashed in a casaba  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Ive been messing with the heavy stuff  
For a time I couldnt get enough  
But Im waking up and its wearing off  
Junk dont take you far  
  
Tell my mama Im coming home  
In my youth Im getting older  
And I think its lost control  
Mama Im coming home  
  
Chorus
