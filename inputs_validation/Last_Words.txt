Who cheers you up  
When you are down  
Who brings you cups of coffee  
Who picks you up  
When youre in town  
Whatever makes you happy  
And Im glad youre better now  
But Im sad youre not around  
Friends  
Wont ever desert you  
Or turn against  
Friends  
Wont love you and leave you  
To mend the fence  
Who wakes you up  
When youre late for work  
Who makes the bed so lovely  
Who found your sock  
Who pressed your shirt  
Whatever makes you love me  
And Im glad Im better now  
But Im just sad youre not around  
Friends  
Will never deceive you  
Or turn against  
Friends  
Wont love you and leave you  
To mend the fence
