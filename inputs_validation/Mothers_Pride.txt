Oh she knows  
She takes his hand  
And prays the child will understand  
At the door they watch the men go by  
In the clothes that daddy wore  
  
Mothers pride  
Baby boy  
His fathers eyes  
Hes a soldier waiting for war  
Time will come  
Hell hold a gun  
His fathers son  
  
And as he grows  
He hears the band  
Takes the step from boy to man  
And at the shore she waves her son goodbye  
Like the man she did before  
  
Mothers pride  
Just a boy  
His countrys eyes  
Hes a soldier waving at the shore  
And in her heart the time has come  
To lose a son  
  
And all the husbands all the sons all the lovers gone  
They make no difference  
No difference in the end  
Still hear the woman say your father died a hero  
In the name of God and man  
  
Mothers pride  
Crazy boy  
His lifeless eyes  
Hes a soldier now forevermore  
Hell hold a gun till kingdom come
