Its money mane n juice man n Gucci mane Gucci mane  
  
Im a keep droppin verses  
Hotta den tha hottest summa  
Eat rappers like Jeffrey Domer  
Dope color Shanay O Conner  
Should I name another woman  
Russian like president Obama  
Wanna buy two extra commas  
All my shoes are Fara Gomma  
Lightning actually hittin thunda  
Even Stevie Wonder wonder  
Why yo girl get home on time so much I had to change my numba  
Sarcasm these bitches need to ride em while I pass em  
I wouldnt even give that bitch a orgasm  
Miraculously my niggas stand beside not in back of me  
So disrespect my faculty how dare you have audacity  
The compact to capacity I cash out automatically  
I spit these rhymes so radically sporadically fatality  
  
Chorus  
I got the green drank pills blow  
Runnin round the town gettin money I suppose  
Im the gingerbread man  
Im the gingerbread man  
Im the gingerbread man  
Im the gingerbread man  
I got the green drank pills blow  
I Cant get up sleep jus keep knockin on my door  
Im the gingerbread man  
Im the gingerbread man  
Im the gingerbread man  
Im the gingerbread man  
  
Gingerbread man I got white I got white  
Trap house bunkin up all night take flight  
Droppin 10 bases its jumpin that white  
Trees to that paper so Im something like a kite  
Loud stanky kush and it tellin me to light  
Extra loud diamonds and its lookin like a light  
Rollin stay money and my pockets just glide  
Everyday diamonds cause they dont like to hide  
VVS light yea so you block yo eyes  
Burnt color diamonds like a sweet potato pie  
Hit ya color diamonds and get ratchet like a fly  
The brick man the bread man I dont tell no lies  
  
Chorus  
  
Money Mane gettin it in Im only in it to win  
I aint come to say Im the champ I get bored and do it again  
If I evred across a tranny I aint asked her for a twin  
cause its number time done came to gather up all my inns  
its fifteen minutes to ten eighth in and Im drinkin gin  
I could act like we were fiends but I dont like to pretend  
I got 30 stacks new Ajax its the future price of my air max  
Im addicted to abllin I hear Lennox Mall and I relapse  
Your slimfast little bankroll my stash getting way to fat  
No pushup just cookups Im booked up I dont wanna lapse  
Theres Money Mane and Juice Mane and Gucci Mane and ol Brickman  
I got juice all in my kitchen so my house smell like cocaine  
  
Chorus
