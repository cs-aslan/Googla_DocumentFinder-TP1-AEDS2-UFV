You wake up in the morning drink a beer and take a Valium  
And youre trying to forget about the things you did last night  
Flip through the morning paper read the horoscope and the comics  
Youre as well informed as anybody on the left or the right  
You make it to your job and hear Atlanta lost another  
How can you lose while making half a million bucks or near  
The old man who sweeps the floor and wears a big blue Reagan button  
Says the Russians are a coming but theyve been here for years  
Trying everything from Jesus to Jack Daniels its the all new American diet  
Trying everything from Jesus to Jack Daniels  
You get on it and youre on it for the rest of your life  
 fiddle   
Theres a story in the paper about a man who killed his family  
He jumped off a bridge because he couldnt take it anymore  
Down at the local tavern a young man comes in limpin  
And he claims that hes a veteran of the Falkland Islands war  
You head home and youre accosted by a youngster wearin robes  
And wanting money for his God who sits upon a plastic throne  
You ignore him if you can and make it to the local tavern  
Where you order up a drink and give some money to your own  
Trying everything from Jesus  
Theres a man in Tennessee whos got it figured out completely  
I guess that hes as happy as a thinking man can be  
I asked him what he thought and he said brother let me tell you  
Try a little bit of both and leave out everything in between  
Trying everything from Jesus
