Just like that she follows me  
My wings under her tree  
She says one thing and thats just enough  
It doesnt matter how much  
  
Would I forget  
Lay myself down  
Just to regret  
And thats all  
Would I forget  
  
Ill go with her  
Ill never know how far how long  
She keeps a diamond inside her door  
She doesnt have a clue  
  
Would I forget  
Lay myself down  
Just to regret  
And thats all  
  
Would I forget  
Lay myself down  
Just to regret  
And thats all  
  
And thats all  
And thats all
