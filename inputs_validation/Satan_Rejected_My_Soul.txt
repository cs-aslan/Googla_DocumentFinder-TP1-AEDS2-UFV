Satan rejected my soul  
He knows my kind  
He wont be dragged down  
Hes seen my face around  
He knows Heaven doesnt seem  
To be my home  
So I must find  
Somewhere else to go  
So I must find  
Somewhere else to go  
So take it  please  
Its free  
Youll never see  
Youll never see  
All the fun in life its cost me  
Satan rejected my soul  
As low as he goes  
He never quite goes this low  
Hes seen my face around  
He knows Heaven doesnt seem  
To be my home  
So I must find  
Somewhere else to go  
So I must find  
Somewhere else to go  
So take it please  
Its really sly  
Come on come on ah  
Come on come on come on  
Take it please  
Its really sly  
Come on come on ah  
Come on come on come on  
Call me in  
Pull me in call me in  
Come on come on oh  
Come on come on come on  
Pull me in pull me in  
Call me in haul me in pull me in  
Come on come on ah  
Come on come on  
La la la la la  
Oh
