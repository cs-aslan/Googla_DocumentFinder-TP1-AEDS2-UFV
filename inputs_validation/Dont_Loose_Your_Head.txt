You shot your mouth off like a kid  
Whos scared to have a heart  
Your loosing grip of what really matters  
Cause you dont know where to start  
You wake up in the morning  
With a starfuck for a friend  
The things you do are so in tune  
With what you said you hate  
Whats giving you the will to live  
Is it looking for revenge  
The only laugh that youve got left  
Is hiding from the pain  
What must have happened to your soul  
Is skinning you alive  
The thing you fear most is love  
And thats buried deep inside  
So deep inside  
  
Dont loose your head  
Cause I cant do the time  
Dont loose your head  
Can you pay the price  
  
The heart your building out of rock  
Is turning into sand  
Cause you never took the time to think  
What it means to be a man  
You act like you got the answer  
When the questions never asked  
Ive been to where your coming from  
But the postcards werent so bad  
The knife I carry has been sharpened  
On the mouths that wont keep shut  
Ill stab at you in the darkness  
Cause Im trying to shed some light  
Your point of view is so meaningless  
If you ever had one at all  
All you seem to care about  
Is whos gonna take the fall  
  
Whos gonna take the fall for you  
  
Dont loose your head  
Now I cant do the time for you  
Dont loose your head  
Can you pay the price  
  
Dont loose your head  
Cause I cant do the time  
Dont loose your head  
Can you pay the price  
  
Dont loose your head  
If you cant do the time  
Dont loose your head  
Can you pay the price  
  
Dont loose your head  
You cant pay the price  
Dont loose your head  
You know I cant do the time
