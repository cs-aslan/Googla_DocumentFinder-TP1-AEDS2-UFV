I hear the train a comin rollin round the bend  
I aint seen the sunshine since I dont know when  
Well Im stuck in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on  
While a train keeps a rollin on down to San Antone  
Well when I was just a baby my mama told me son  
Always be a good boy dont ever play with guns  
Well I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
When I hear that whistle blowin I hang my head and I cry  
  
Well Ill bet theres rich folks eatin in some fancy dining car  
Probably drinkin coffee and smokin big cigars  
Well I know I had it comin I know I cant be free  
But those people keep a movin thats what tortures me  
  
Well if they freed me from this prison if that railroad train was mine  
Bet Id move it on a little farther down the line  
Far from Folsom Prison thats where I long to stay  
Then Id let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
