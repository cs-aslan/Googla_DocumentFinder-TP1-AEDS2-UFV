I knew I was being threatened  
Do you think its worth holding out  
I mean Ive heard some pretty ugly things about those guys  
Ugly stories  
  
Watch them flee  
Watch them flee  
Rap up  
Watch them flee  
HipHop hits  
And you do it like this  
  
Its going down  
The rhythm projects round the next sound  
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now  
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down  
The melting pot of a superfuture Xstyle  
The combination of a vocal caress  
With lungs that gasp for breath  
From emotional stress  
With special effects  
And a distorted collage  
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage  
  
PreChorus  
Its going down  
The logical progression on a the timeline  
The separation narrowed down to a fine line  
To blur the edges so they blend together properly  
Take you on an audible odyssey  
Now its going down  
A logical progression on the timeline  
The separation narrowed down to a fine line  
To blur the edges so they blend together properly  
Take you on a an audible odyssey  
Now its going down  
  
Chorus  
Put put put it up  
It said it goes like this  
And you do it like this  
Its going down  
Put put it up  
It said it go go goes like this  
And you do it like this  
Its going down  
  
Once again it is  
Composed sentences all together venomous  
The four elements of natural force  
Projected daily through the sound of the source  
Everybody on board with this blend  
The sword with the pen  
The mightiest is the weapons  
Swinging right from the chin  
The elevate of mental states  
Long gone with the wind  
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends  
Its going down  
Stalence emulation readily  
Trekking through the weaponry  
Of the pure pedigree  
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me  
Whatever the weather be  
We invent the steadily  
Its going down to subterrestrial high  
I rhyme regiment thats calling the shots  
Execution of collaborative plots  
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop  
  
Pre Chorus  
Its going down  
A logical progression on a the timeline  
The separation narrowed down to a fine line  
To blur the edges so they blend together properly  
Take you on an audible odyssey  
Now its going down  
  
Chorus  
Put put put it up  
It said it goes like this  
And you do it like this  
Its going down  
Put put it up  
It said it goes like this  
And you do it like this  
  
Its going down  
Xmen bout to blast of world wide  
Yo its request only  
X men bout to blast of world wide  
Its built from scratch  
Album in stores soon  
Bout to blast off world wide  
And you do it like this  
  
Its going down  
Put put put it up  
It said it goes like this  
And you do it like this  
Its going down  
Put put it up  
It said it goes like this  
And you do it like this  
Its going down  
Like this
