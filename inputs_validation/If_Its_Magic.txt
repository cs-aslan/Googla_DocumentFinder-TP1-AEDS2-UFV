If its magic  
Then why cant it be everlasting  
Like the sun that always shines  
Like the poets in this rhyme  
Like the galaxies in time  
If its pleasing  
Then why cant it be never leaving  
Like the day that never fails  
Like on seashores there are shells  
Like the time that always tells  
It holds the key to every heart  
Throughout the universe  
It fills you up without a bite  
And quenches every thirst  
So  
If its special  
Then with it why arent we as careful  
As making sure we dress in style  
Posing pictures with a smile  
Keeping danger from a child  
It holds the key to every heart  
Throughout the universe  
It fills you up without a bite  
And quenches every thirst  
So  
If its magic  
Why cant we make it everlasting  
Like the lifetime of the sun  
It will leave no heart undone  
For theres enough for everyone
