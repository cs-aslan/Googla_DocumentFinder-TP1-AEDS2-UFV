I wasnt born lookin back I cant tell white from black  
Kesey next to me now darling straighter than a railroad track  
Ive been so high my mind was dry  
  
I rent it out to farmers on the midnight ride  
That aint all  
I aint even got me a congressman I can call  
I seen em dumpin garbage in my rivers and lakes  
All right  
I seen em send up John Sinclair you know  
Two joints is all it takes  
  
Then suddenly I was in a tree  
And dogs were barking up at me  
Cant you see  
Im so damn apethetic I cant believe Im free  
  
As the senator he signs the bills you know  
  
And hes telling us which way we have to go  
  
Think its time we got together and declared  
When you see them coming and you get so scared  
  
Rain is falling down but you know Im feeling fine  
I think Ill watch the tv set let America steal my mind  
But you know Im cool Momma had a rule  
She didnt raise no fool to be true to someone else  
Im gonna be myself  
Im runnin down that highway child  
  
Highway child  
Highway child
