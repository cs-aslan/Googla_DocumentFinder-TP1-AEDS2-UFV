My baby lives in shades of blue  
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude  
He lives in California too  
He drives a chevy Malibu  
  
And when he calls  
He calls for me and not for you  
He lives for love he loves his drugs  
He loves his baby too  
  
But I cant fix him cant make him better  
And I cant do nothing about his strange weather  
  
Cause you are invincible  
I cant break through your world  
Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable  
  
My baby lives in shades of cool  
Blue heart and hands and aptitude  
He lives for love for women too  
Im one of many one is blue  
  
And when he calls  
He calls for me and not for you  
He prays for love he prays for peace  
And maybe someone new  
  
But I cant help him cant make him better  
And I cant do nothing about his strange weather  
  
Cause you are invincible  
I cant break through your world  
Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable  
  
Cause you are invincible  
I cant break through your world  
Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable
