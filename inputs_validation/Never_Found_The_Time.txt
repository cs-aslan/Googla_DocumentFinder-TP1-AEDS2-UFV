I never found the time  
To see things quite through  
I never found the time  
To give them to you  
  
If living dont come easy  
Dont stop your own voice  
Cause the worst part of living  
Is havin no choice  
  
Tell me a story  
Tell it with your eyes  
Im gonna stop believin  
If I hear another lie  
Drink some cold water  
Your mouths getting dry  
  
If I only had the time  
To see things right through  
Id give up all my treasures  
And send them to you  
  
Then livin would seem easy  
No lights and no noise  
Just me and my lady  
And the echo of her voice  
  
Tell me a story  
Tell it with your eyes  
Im gonna stop believin  
If I hear another lie  
Drink some cold water  
Your mouths getting dry  
  
I never found the time  
To see into my lady  
And memories dont die  
But with time become hazy  
  
I never found the time  
To see into my lady  
And memories dont die  
But with time become hazy  
  
I never found the time  
To see into my lady  
And memories dont die  
But with time become hazy  
  
I never found the time
