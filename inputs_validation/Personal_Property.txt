Shes a goldplated lover  
Twentyfour carat cool  
She can walk on water  
She can walk in my room  
Shes a one man woman  
and its a one man race  
Shes got a kiss like fire  
She burns the lips right off my face  
  
Its finders keepers  
Losers gonna weep  
Shes personal property  
Sealed n stamped  
Money in the bank  
Shes private  
For my eyes only  
  
Chorus  
Shes personal property  
Personal property  
Personal service personal touch  
Exclusively mine thank you so much  
Shes a heart stoppin brain thuddin  
Blood pumpin knee tremblin  
Spine crushin tongue tyin  
Personal property  
And she belongs to me  
  
She wont fall for nothin  
Shes much more than cute  
Dont mind why window shoppin thats all right  
But you aint gonna taste  
My forbidden fruit  
  
Adios au revoir  
Wiedersehen goodbye  
Shes personal property  
Off limits out of bounds  
Under lock n key  
Confidential  
For my eyes only  
  
Shes personal property  
Personal property  
Personal service personal touch  
Exclusively mine thank you so much  
Shes a heart stoppin brain thuddin  
Blood pumpin knee tremblin  
Spine crushin tongue tyin  
  
Shes mine yeah  
  
Now I dont mind you guys checkin her out  
You can whistle like a wolf  
Or you can mess around  
But let me tell you the secret  
Of the sweet life  
If you want to stay healthy man  
Take my advice  
You better kit the road Jack  
And dont come back  
  
You could be king of the jungle  
Or you could swing in the rain  
But she dont need no monkey not my babe  
Cause Im her Tarzan and shes my Jane  
  
Chorus  
  
And shes mine  
She belongs to me
