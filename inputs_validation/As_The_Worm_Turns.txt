One day youre thinking that maybe youre feeling better  
And youre probably an OK person if only you had a job  
Through the hollow tombs can see them  
Through their mouths I can hear them praying for pain  
But its only a game  
  
Listen man I know  
That things are really rough  
And everybody gets you  
And life is really tough  
But I know that deep down inside  
Theres a feeling that rides  
All the way to the end  
  
Thursday you sit in your room with the lights turned out  
And you dont answer the door  
Friday morning looks sunny and bright  
Like its going to be a good day  
And it would be if only you had a job  
  
Time is on your side youre young  
Dont waste your time today
