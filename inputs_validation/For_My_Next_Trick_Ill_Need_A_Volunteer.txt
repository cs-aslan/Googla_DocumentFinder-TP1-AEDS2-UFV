I can saw a woman in two  
But you wont want to look in the box when I do  
I can make love disappear  
For my next trick Ill need a volunteer  
I can pull a rabbit out of a hat  
I can pull it out but I cant put it back  
I can make love disappear  
For my next trick Ill need a volunteer  
Its lonely up here  
When the tricks have been played  
And the spotlights have faded  
And the plans that we made  
Have fallen apart  
Its lonely as hell  
And theres no magic spell  
For a broken heart  
You can put me in chains and I will escape  
Better not wait up cause I might be late  
I can make love disappear  
For my next trick Ill need a volunteer  
Its lonely up here  
When the tricks have been played  
And the spotlights have faded  
And the plans that we made  
Have fallen apart  
Its lonely as hell  
And theres no magic spell  
For a broken heart  
I can saw a woman in two  
But you wont want to look in the box when I do  
I can make love disappear  
For my next trick Ill need a volunteer
