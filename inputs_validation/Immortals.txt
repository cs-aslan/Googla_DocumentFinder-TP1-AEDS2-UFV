Verse 1  
They say we are what we are  
But we dont have to be  
Im bad behavior but I do it in the best way  
Ill be the watcher of the eternal flame  
Ill be the guard dog of all your fever dreams  
  
PreChorus  
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass glass glass  
Ill try to picture me without you but I cant  
  
Chorus  
Cause we could be immortals immortals  
Just not for long for long  
Live with me forever now  
Pull the blackout curtains down  
Just not for long for long  
We could be immorimmortals immorimmortals  
Immorimmortals immorimmortals  
Imimmortals  
  
Verse 2  
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith  
Is when its tested again and again everyday  
Im still comparing your past to my future  
It might be your wound but theyre my sutures  
  
PreChorus  
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass glass glass  
Ill try to picture me without you but I cant  
  
Chorus  
Cause we could be immortals immortals  
Just not for long for long  
Live with me forever now  
Pull the blackout curtains down  
Just not for long for long  
We could be immorimmortals immorimmortals  
Imimmortals  
  
Bridge  
And live with me forever now  
Pull the blackout curtains down  
  
Outro  
We could be immortals immorimmortals  
Just not for long for long  
We could be immorimmortals immorimmortals  
Immorimmortals immorimmortals  
Imimmortals
