Before the poison I wasnt down  
If youd been there if youd been around  
I couldnt hear couldnt hear a sound  
I was floating above the ground  
  
Before the poison I had lost my fear  
Maybe too happy to even care  
Safe in my dream couldnt see the fog  
Comin on coming from nowhere my name to call  
  
No more to say nothins comin my way  
No you no me no more how can it be  
Nowhere to run out of nowhere poison  
They sense the end whats left for you my friend  
  
Before the poison Id laugh out loud  
Id see your face in any crowd  
But speak softly without fear  
Hold on to me hold me near  
  
No more to say nothins comin my way  
No you no me no more how can it be  
Nowhere to run out of nowhere poison  
They sense the end whats left for you my friend  
  
Whats left for you my friend  
Whats left for you my friend  
Whats left for you
