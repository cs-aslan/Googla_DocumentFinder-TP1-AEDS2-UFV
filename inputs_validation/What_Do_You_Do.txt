Yes I know youre right  
I see it in your fierce eyes  
But me Ive never thought straight  
Since the day I had the first doubt  
  
Yes I know youre right  
And Ill back you to a point pal  
But Ill never be constrained  
By another mans ideas now  
  
I spent too long on this road  
Looking for the answers  
But Poverty and Failure  
Arent what Im after  
  
I painted Fight on factories  
But they closed the factory down pal  
I want to find out where the Hearts gone  
Find out where the nerves gone  
  
What do you do  
When democracy fails you  
What do you do  
When the rest cant see its true  
  
Pat votes the Scots way  
Just like her mother  
But South always takes all  
Just like her brother  
  
The next time she might vote  
So might the others  
But times running out pal  
Cause theyre giving up in numbers  
  
What do you do  
When Democracys all through  
What do you do  
When minority means you
