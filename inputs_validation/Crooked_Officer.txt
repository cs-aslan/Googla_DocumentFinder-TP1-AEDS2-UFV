Too many times I done been hated on by 50  
Fuck your badge I wish all of you bitches would die slow  
Im just trying to survive hoe and feed my family  
And I aint killed nobody but still rough is how they handle me  
I ride one deep suspended license and all  
My middle finger out the window screaming fuck the law  
I know what you protect and serve not a god damn thang  
But give a nigga five years for lessing the crowd mayn  
They got me feeling Devin tell me why they do us that way  
The got me searching for the doja in a doobie ashtray  
So I can cope with it not trying to travel up and smoke with it  
My kinfolk in the maximum security for no bidness  
Sick of Im missing you so heres what Im fin to do  
Bounty hunting for badges fuck a ditch Ima dig a few  
The odds are against us because we black  
So keep your heat in a stash spot and always be strapped  
Hook  
Mr officer crooked officer  
Make a nigga want to blow the badge off of ya  
We been living hard so it wont be soft for ya  
Fiending to see your blood until you cough it up  
Mr officer crooked officer  
We just trying to feed our sons and daughters sir  
We been struggling to make it in America too long  
All we want to do is live our life and be left alone

Illegal search 45 minutes what the fuck you looking for  
I roll on 24s so the Dopeman is what they get me for  
And thats a shame a nigga cant ride nice  
Without getting harassed and facing 25 to life  
I wish I could make a citizens arrest  
Knock the busters in the hole and blow the badges up off of they chest  
Controlled substance on the ground and it just had to be mine  
Fucking with me about weed and they look blacker than mine  
Six months for getting caught up with a soldier strap  
Theyll put the felonies on me but keep your doja sack  
Thats why they proud to be an American  
What about my Negro people look how they stare at them  
With evil eyes they hang a brother daily G  
The Judicial system is our modern day slavery  
We aint picking cotton no mo bitch we picking off cops  
Negro life in association we issuing out glocks

I put my hands up too slow and I got shot in the back  
Thrown in the back of the paddy wagon left to ride in the pack  
What about my medical condition its some bullshit  
We dont give a damn if you die one less nigger to deal with  
Ask me why I dont give a fuck about the police  
Cause all they offer is the penitentiary with no peace  
They planting dope on niggaz just to get a commission  
And if we dont cooperate itll be a longer stay in prison  
Everytime I had a flat theyd just pass me by  
And if I was laying on the ground theyd never ask me why  
But when Im looking great and rolling in something they cant pronounce  
They looking for any reason not to let a nigga bounce  
Whether expired registration or inspection stickers  
The only thing be on they mind is we gon get them niggaz  
And it dont matter if we working on a 9to5  
We rerouted by the system facing 99
