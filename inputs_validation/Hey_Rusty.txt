Hey Rusty  
Its a long time  
Remember  
Its like yesterday  
Stealing cigarettes  
And laughing as they chased us  
Down the boulevards  
Then I got a job  
White collar  
Turn coat  
You just spun around and walked  
Said we wouldnt meet again  
Hey Rusty dont hang up  
I feel so young  
Hey Rusty dont hang up  
Cause were still young  
I just need one friend  
She said hey  
Dont take it so bad  
She said hey  
It wasnt so much  
We just ran out of gas  
Or something like that  
Thats when I  
I crashed my car  
Not by chance  
And not out of love  
Then I walked out of that job  
You shouldve seen their faces  
Hey Rusty dont hang up  
I just need one friend  
And were not finished yet  
No way  
Hey Rusty  
I changed my mind  
What dyou say we start again  
No I mean it this time  
Stealing cigarettes  
And laughing as they chase us  
Down the boulevards
