Ive seen a thousand thoughtless faces today  
A thousand I saw yesterday  
Its our ignorance that keeps us up to pace  
Its our tvs that keep us smiling  
And all the worlds money wont buy you freedom  
Diamond rings dont save lives  
How can a man ever be free  
I know its inside you and me sat outside on broken steps  
The other day a man came up to say hello  
He sang me songs that he heard on the radio  
But said that writing was his passion gave him the change  
I had wished him good luck  
Maybe hell be fine but he just buys wine  
Hes been alone since age sixteen  
How can we push him out of our memories  
Half the world is sleeping now in front of tvs  
And the other half is crying to the night sky  
Is this why we were born  
To wash our emperors feet  
Or are we just puppets living lies  
I had a dream I tried to talk to mother earth last night  
But she just sat and cried yeah she fucking cried  
Can someone save us from our pain  
She replied save yourself so lets learn to be free  
Lets quit our jobs and find some meaning  
Lets pour out in the streets  
And yell and sing because without love this life dont mean a thing  
I say fuck this routine
