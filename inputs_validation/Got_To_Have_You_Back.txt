Got to have you back I need you  
A jealous lie hurt my foolish pride  
Made me break your heart  
Now our love has died  
I see a closing door  a door never more  
A door of jealousy between your love and me  
Now I face a storm of tears  
You took the sunshine from my face  
Now Im just another man  
Who walks the undestined way  
Without your guiding hand  
I can hardly tell when Im the man  
Pride made a fool of me  
Now Im drowning in misery  misery is drowning me  
  
And Ive got to have you back I need you  
Between the night and day oh heaven speed you  
Cos I need you girl  
Ive been told  its a loneliness  
Oh dark is the emptiness  
Since youve been gone in me  
Oh gone is the lover I need  
Pride destroyed the love we knew  
But not my need for you  
Without your love around  
My whole world is falling down  falling down  all around  
And Ive got to have you back  
  
Got to have you back  
Got to have you back  
Got to have you back  
Got to have you back  
  
I see a closing door  
  
Got to have you back  Im drowning in misery  
Got to have you back  my pride made a fool of me  
Got to have you back  my whole world is falling down  
Got to have you back  without your sweet love around  
  
Got to have you back
