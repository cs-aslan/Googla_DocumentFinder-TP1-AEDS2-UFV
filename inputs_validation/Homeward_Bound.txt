Im sittin in the railway station got a ticket for my destination  
On a tour of one night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand  
Every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one man band  
Homeward bound I wish I was homeward bound  
Home where my thoughts escaping home where the musics playing  
Home where my love was waitin silently for me  
  
Now every days an endless stream of cigarettes and magazines  
And each town looks the same to me for movies and the factories  
And every strangers face I see reminds me that I long to be  
Homeward bound  
 strings   
Tonight Ill sing my songs again Ill play the game and pretend  
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity  
Like emptiness and harmony I need someone to comfort me  
Homeward bound
