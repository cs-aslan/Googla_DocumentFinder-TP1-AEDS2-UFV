Dont look now you better watch that sword thats hanging over you  
Its a long hard road and they will spit you out  
When they get through with you  
Dont hang your head so the wise man said or boy youll soon be dead  
  
Chorus  
You better run run Manuelauela run  
Theyre gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun  
You better run run Manuelauela run Manuela run  
  
Theres no more time for living out your life your sky is falling down  
Dont close your eyes or make a wish on three  
Cause they will still be round  
Dont hang your head so the wise man said or boy youll soon be dead  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont hang your head so the wise man said or boy youll soon be dead  
  
You better run run Manuelauela run you better run run Manuelauela run  
You better run run Manuelauela run  
Gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun  
You better run run Manuelauela run you better run run Manuela run  
You better run run Manuela run  
Gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun  
You better run run Manuela run
