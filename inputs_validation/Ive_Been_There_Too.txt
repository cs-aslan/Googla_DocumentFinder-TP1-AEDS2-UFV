Theres someone somewhere who cant go on  
Their life is crying its all gone wrong  
What can I say now to help you through  
Except to say that Ive been there too  
  
Your soul is aching you cant see it through  
But time is healing each day you do  
Keep looking forward forget the past  
Its up to you now dont let it last  
  
You got to wake up shake up  
You got a right to live  
Shake up dont break up  
Youve got a lot to give  
  
Youll wake up one morning you start to feel good  
The sun in the blue sky looks like it should  
Cause time is a healer its strange but its true  
So keep looking forward the sun will come through  
  
You got to wake up shake up  
You got a right to live  
Shake up dont break up  
Youve got a lot to give
