She stood beside my narrow bed  
To check my EKG  
She shook her pretty little head  
At whats become of me  
  
I thought I glimpsed a path that led  
Through rhododendron days  
And fuchsia nights to the boatshed  
In which we two once lay  
  
But she gazed only at my chart  
The valleys and the peaks  
Brought back the time she broke my heart  
In Macgillycuddys Reeks  
  
But she gazed only at my chart  
The valleys and the peaks  
Brought back the time she broke my heart  
In Macgillycuddys Reeks  
  
I saw her on Killarneys shore  
One morning in July  
When I still thought I was a thorn  
Trying to find a side  
  
I met her in the little launch  
That runs to Innisfallen  
Hunched together haunch to haunch  
Trying to keep my balance  
  
But she upset my applecart  
She kissed me on the cheek  
And I was struck by Cupids dart  
In Macgillycuddys Reeks  
  
Macgillycuddys Reeks  
Macgillycuddys Reeks  
I was struck by Cupids dart  
In Macgillycuddys Reeks  
  
She was a systems analyst  
For a dot com company  
She said You think because weve kissed  
Ill be yours eternally  
  
Ill sign another prenup  
And well merge our PLCs  
thats why most girls go bellyup  
In this economy  
  
But when it comes to a jump start  
Your forecasts pretty bleak  
The NASDAQ goes by dips and starts  
Like Macgillycuddys Reeks  
  
Macgillycuddys Reeks  
Macgillycuddys Reeks  
The NASDAQ goes by dips and starts  
Like Macgillycuddys Reeks  
  
She looked only at my chart  
The valleys and the peaks  
Brought back the time she broke my heart  
In Macgillycuddys Reeks  
  
Macgillycuddys Reeks  
Macgillycuddys Reeks  
That was the time she broke my heart  
In Macgillycuddys Reeks
