Say the words played the part  
Gave the world and plus my heart  
Did it all with a smile on my face  
  
Gave you love mind and soul  
Thought that it was mutual  
I see now that that wasnt the case  
  
Look at me now  
Not exactly who I was when you last saw me  
Baby Ive grown into a man who knows the deal  
playn around  
With my emotions is a thing of the pastsorry  
Said I become a bit too slick and thats for real  
  
Chorus  
I was in love  
Silly me silly me  
I was what you wanted me to be  
But not anymore not anymore  
I was in love  
Silly you silly you  
I refuse to be your fool  
Not anymore  
  
Sugar whats with your eyes  
Why do you look so surprised  
Is it cause your game has no effect  
 Girl it aint working   
And Ive developed such a swagger  
Sharp as a dagger and a mind that just wont fall for it  
  
Look at me now  
Not exactly who I was when you last saw me  
Baby Ive grown into a man who knows the deal  
playn around  
My emotions is a thing of the past sorry  
Said I become a bit too slick and thats for real  
Hey  
  
Chorus  
  
Im glad you thought that  
Im unhappy without you  
Glad you can see Im fine hey  
So what you coming round for baby  
Girl I dont need you anymore  
  
Chorus
