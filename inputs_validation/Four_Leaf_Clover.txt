I got a four leaf clover  
And it aint done one single lick of good  
Im still a drunk Im still a loser  
Living in a lousy neighborhood  
  
I got a real live horseshoe  
And I hung it upside down above my door  
But it aint done nothing to attract you  
So I dont know what the hell its for  
  
Why dont you come over  
Ill show you my four leaf clover  
Who am I tryin to kid  
Im not the kind of guy youd go for  
  
I got a four leaf clover  
But I aint got no hope of getting you  
  
I gotta oooooooooo  
Oh I got a lucky silver dollar  
My granddaddy gave it to me now hes dead  
At times like this I wish that I could join him  
So I can stop this pounding in my head  
  
Why dont you come over  
Ill show you my four leaf clover  
Who am I tryin to kid  
Im not the kind of guy you go for  
  
I got a four leaf clover  
But I aint got no hope of getting you  
Well I aint got no hope of getting you  
No I aint got no hope of getting you
