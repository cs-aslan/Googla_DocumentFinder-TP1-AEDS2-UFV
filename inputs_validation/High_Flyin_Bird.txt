Theres a high flyin bird way up in the sky  
And I wonder does she looks down as she flies on by  
Just floatin so free and easy in the sky  
  
Oh look at me here  
Im just rooted like a tree here  
I got them sitdown cant fly  
Oh Lord Im gonna die blues  
Im gonna die blues  
  
Well the sun comes along and she lights up the day  
And then when she gets tired she just flies along on her way  
From the east to the west she goes down every day  
  
But look at me here  
Im just rooted like a tree here  
I got them sitdown cant fly  
Oh Lord Im gonna die blues  
Im gonna die blues  
  
Now I once knew a man  
He worked in a mine  
Well he never saw the sun  
But then he never stopped tryin  
  
Then one day that old man he up and he died  
Yeah he up and he died  
He up and he died  
Well he wanted to die and the only way to fly was to die  
  
Lord Im gonna die blues  
Lord Im gonna die blues  
Lord Im gonna die blues  
  
Theres a high flyin bird way up in the sky  
I wonder does she looks down as she flies on by  
Just ridin so free and easy in the sky  
  
Look at me here  
Im rooted like a tree here  
I got them sitdown cant fly  
Oh Lord Im gonna die blues  
God Im gonna die blues  
  
I know Im gonna die blues  
Oh Im gonna die blues  
Gonna die blues  
Gonna die blues
