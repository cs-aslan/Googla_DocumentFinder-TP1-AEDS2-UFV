Sometimes I cant see past a day  
I know Im growin tired and I feel it yeah  
And the song that I sing when the notes begin to ring  
Its hard for my head to get into the melody yeah  
  
Day to day I tell you  
Day by day  
I see faces all around me  
When they start to smile  
I just stop for a while  
And I say baby let me love you  
  
A small town store with an old wooden floor  
The old man inside sellin dry goods  
Has a smile on his face  
Dont you know thats hard to replace  
I bet hes gonna live to be a hundred yeah  
  
Day to day I tell you  
Day by day  
I see faces all around me  
When they start to smile  
I just stop for a while  
And I say baby let me love you  
  
Summer is hot and the winter is cold  
People all doin just what theyre told  
Its too bad its too sad  
Thinkin for yourself is a hard thing to do  
Well dont you know theyre depending on you  
To see them through yeah  
To see them through  
Its the only thing you can do  
You know you got to see them through  
  
Shinin my light like a candle so bright  
Show me the way to my future yeah  
With your hand on my face  
Take me far from this place  
Honey Ill be the key to your heavenly door  
Hear me baby calling to you now  
Dont you know now baby well theyre countin on you  
  
See me baby reachin for you  
For you reachin out for you baby  
Dont you see me reachin out for you  
Hear me baby hear me callin to you  
Dont you know baby that Im countin on you  
To see me through
