Pa pa pa pia pa pa pa pia pia pia  
Dont let the stars get in your eyes  
Dont let the moon break your heart  
Love blooms at night  
In daylight it dies  
Dont let the stars get in your eyes  
Dont keep your heart from me  
For some day Ill return  
And you know youre the only one Ill ever love  
  
Too many nights Too many nights  
Too many stars Too many stars  
Too many moons could change your mind  
dont let the moon change your mind  
  
If Im gone too long  
Dont forget where you belong  
When the stars come out remember you are mine  
  
Dont let the stars get in your eyes  
Dont let the moon break your heart  
Love blooms at night  
In daylight it dies  
Dont let the stars get in your eyes  
Dont keep your heart from me  
For some day Ill return  
And you know youre the only one Ill ever love  
  
Dont let the stars get in your eyesdont let the moon break your heart  
  
Pa pa pa pia pa pa pa pia  
Too many miles Too many miles  
Too many days Too many days  
Too many nights to be alone Too many nights all alone  
Oh please keep your heart while we are apart  
Dont you linger in the moonlight when Im gone While Im gone  
  
Dont let the stars get in your eyes  
Dont let the moon break your heart  
Dont let the moon break your heart  
Love blooms at night  
In daylight it dies  
Dont let the stars get in your eyes  
Dont keep your heart from me  
For some day Ill return  
And you know youre the only one Ill ever love  
Ill ever love Ill ever love  
  
Youre the only one youre the only one  
Ill ever love
