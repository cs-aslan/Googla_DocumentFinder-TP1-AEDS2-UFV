Lose it  
Lose it  
I dont even know the first thing  
About what theyre feeling  
What am I afraid of  
Dont know what Im made of  
Can I go on  
Not knowing  
  
Feeling  
Feeling  
Something tells me  
That its more than I can deal with  
Though I never knew the song  
Some words still catch on  
Like caring and sharing  
Being together no matter  
  
Can I go on  
Not knowing  
Dont know what Im made of  
Why am I afraid of feeling  
Feeling  
If I dare to take a chance  
Would someone lead me
