I need you to hear me  
I want you to feel this  
It should be clear as fear and plain as day  
Im not going to bend now  
Youre not gonna break me  
Youll never be hard enough to scratch my face  
  
I wanted to feel you  
I tried to belong here  
Well all of the ghosts and faded headlines  
But I couldnt read you  
No you wouldnt let me  
You always pull away  
From the ones you cant defy  
  
Are you tired  
Of holding up the sky  
Of teaching birds to fly  
Youve done it all your life  
Oh baby are you sad  
When you see the sun  
Cause then youre not the brightest one  
When all is said and done  
And honey all is said and done  
  
I need to move through this  
The waiting just kills me  
Whatever you do is on you  
Im washed clean  
No dont be alarmed now  
The storys ending  
These arent open arms  
Theyre just waving you away  
  
Are you tired  
Of holding up the sky  
Of teaching birds to fly  
Youve done it all your life  
Oh baby are you sad  
When you see the sun  
Youve never been the brightest one  
When all is said and done  
And honey all is said and done  
All is said and done  
  
I need you to hear me  
I want you to feel this  
It should be clear as fear and plain as day  
  
Are you tired  
Of holding up the sky  
Of teaching birds to fly  
Youve done it all your life  
Oh baby are you sad  
When you see the sun  
Cause then youre not the brightest one  
When all is said and done  
  
Oh are you tired  
Of running for your life  
When theres no one left behind  
Just the chaos in your mind  
Oh baby are you sad  
Each day you greet the sun  
You know youre not the brightest one  
When all is said and done  
All is said and done
