The landlords here to visit  
Theyre blasting disco down below  
says Im doubling the rent  
cause the buildings condemned  
Youre gonna help me buy City Hall  
  
But we can you know we can  
We can you know we can  
Lets lynch the landlord man  
  
I tell them turn on the water  
I tell them turn on the heat  
Tells me All you ever do is complain  
Then they search the place when Im not here  
  
But we can you know we can  
Lets lynch the landlord  
Lets lynch the landlord  
Lets lynch the landlord man  
  
Theres rats chewin up the kitchen  
Roaches up to my knees  
Turn the oven on it smells like Dachau  
Til the rain pours through the ceiling  
  
But we can you know we can  
Lets lynch the landlord man
