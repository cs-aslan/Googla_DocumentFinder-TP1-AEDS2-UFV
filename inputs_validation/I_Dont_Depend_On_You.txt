The night  
So young  
You could lose  
You could gain  
Your temperatures rising  
Better pull into the outside lane  
You always say youre not the jealous kind  
Then you tell all your friends that Ive got one thing on my mind  
  
Ive played this scene before you had one foot in the door  
But theres always plenty more dont try to use me  
I dont depend on you Ive got my own friends too  
Ill never be your wife dont try to use me  
Ive played this scene before you had one foot in the door  
But theres always plenty more dont try to use me  
  
Its cruel but its true I dont depend on you  
Its cruel but its true go back to the end of the queue
