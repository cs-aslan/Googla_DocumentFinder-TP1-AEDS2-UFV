Verse  
Just a nick of time before Im home with you  
Just a little while Im on my way  
I can see you smiling feel your love so true  
Just a little pins on the paint  
  
Verse  
When I think of heaven I see fields of gold  
And angels singing softly just for me  
It would be the sweetest thing that Ill behold  
Stronger than my old magnolia tree  
  
Chorus  
When Im spposed to be  
When Im spposed to be  
Ill be with you when Im spposed to be  
Every road I travel leads me back to you  
Ill be with you when Im spposed to be  
  
Verse  
Got no time for hurrying Ill keep my pace  
I dont care if people pass me by  
Know my journeys over when I see your face  
Loving arms and sprung on in your eyes  
  
Chorus  
When Im spposed to be  
When Im spposed to be  
Ill be with you when Im spposed to be  
Every road I travel leads me back to you  
Ill be with you when Im spposed to be  
  
Verse  
Just a nick of time before Im home with you  
Just a little time Im on my way  
I can see you smiling feel your love so true  
Just a little pins on the paint  
  
Chorus  
When Im spposed to be  
When Im spposed to be  
Ill be with you when Im spposed to be  
Every road I travel leads me back to you  
Ill be with you when Im spposed to be  
  
When Im spposed to be x4  
Im with you  
When Im spposed to be x4  
Im with you  
When Im spposed to be x4  
Im with you
