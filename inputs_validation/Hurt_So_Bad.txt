I know you  
Dont know what Im going through  
Standing here looking at you  
  
Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad  
It makes me feel so sad  
It makes me hurt so bad to see you again  
  
Like needles and pins  
People say youve been making out okay  
Hes in love dont stand in his way  
  
Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad  
It makes me feel so sad  
Its gonna hurt so bad if you walk away  
Click here to listen  
Why dont you stay and let me make it up to you  
Ill do anything you want me to  
You loved me before please love me again  
I cant let you go back to her  
Please dont go  
Please dont go  
  
Please dont go  
Please dont go  
Hurt so bad

Come back it hurts so bad  
Come back it hurts so bad
