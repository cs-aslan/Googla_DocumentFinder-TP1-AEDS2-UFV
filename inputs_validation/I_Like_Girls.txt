I bought a Porsche  
And Im leavin Grand Rapids  
Quit my job quit my school  
Quit this place  
My mother cried  
My father was fried  
Hey Ive got no time man  
I want to say goodbye to my babes  
I like girls  
  
I dumped on Sheila on Thursday  
Ill drop Melissa today  
Ill kiss some tears off of Donna  
Ask if shell call on Shauna  
Amanda and Sandra and Kay  
I like girls I love em to death  
  
Hey Valentino You going somewhere  
You wouldnt sneak out on me would you  
Whats that a blond hair  
He must visualize himself an Errol Flynn  
  
I see myself a suave sophisticated lover  
Ill meet a rich hot old Hollywood dame  
You see my ultimate goal  
Will be my life bein told  
In a penthouse letter that I can frame  
And keep it all my life  
Girls I love em oh yeah  
  
New luggage Did you say you were going  
Somewhere Oh just out for some fresh air  
Does she have a nice pair  
  
He was swallowed alive by the freeway  
Turned into an ant on parade  
He bravely drove off that beast  
Aimed his car back to the east  
Why be a snack at home  
Im a feast for the girls  
I like girls I really like em  
  
WellwellwellLook whos back Run out of gas  
Patty I was just gonna call you Look  
I left Donna and Shauna  
And Katy and Carrie  
Melissa and Dena  
I just didnt have any use for em  
I just want you  
Really no really honest
