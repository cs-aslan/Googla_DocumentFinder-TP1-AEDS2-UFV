Over the hills they came from the valley  
Making innuendos about my lack of talent oh well  
They say that when Im supposed to be singing  
All I m really doing is yelling oh well  
To you I say  
  
Break out or get out  
Then they say that I cant sing  
That I dont say a thing  
That I make everything up oh well  
To you I say  
  
Break out or get out  
Break out or get out  
  
Get out of your mind  
Cause its much too small  
And theres so much going on
