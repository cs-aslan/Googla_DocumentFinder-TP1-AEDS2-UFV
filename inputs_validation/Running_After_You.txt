Your Word is a light unto my path  
Your Love guides me through my darkest night  
And even though sometimes Your ways  
I cannot understand  
Ill never walk away because my futures  
In Your hands  
I dont care what people will say  
Im running after You  
I wont turn back and go their way  
Coz Im running after You  
Yeah Im running after You  
Im running after You  
I will run to You  
I dont care what people will say  
Im running after You  
I wont turn back and go their way  
Coz Im running after You  
Dont matter what may come my way  
Im running after you  
Its You Im following today  
Im running after You  
Im running after You
