If you know youre right  
When the others are wrong  
Its hard to sit and take it  
They treat you like youve lost your senses  
Call you troublemaker  
  
Im not trying to cause you trouble  
I dont want to fight  
Someones got to stand up sometime  
And do whats right  
  
Just have the courage of  
The courage of your convictions  
  
People tell you do whats right  
And set and good example  
Sometimes right means who to hate  
Listen to the people  
Im not trying to mess your mind up  
But its plain to see  
People pulling from both sides  
Its agitating me  
  
So have the courage of  
The courage of your convictions  
  
People teaming up on sides  
Hating one another  
Know your heart before you join  
A team to hurt your brother  
  
If theres a way to lead us from this  
Like in troubled times  
It wont be found through blood and hate  
But through courageous minds
