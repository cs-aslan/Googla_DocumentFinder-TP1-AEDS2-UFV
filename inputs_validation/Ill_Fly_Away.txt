Some glad morning when this life is oer  
Ill fly away  
To a home on Gods celestial shore  
Ill fly away  
  
Ill fly away O Glory  
Ill fly away  
When I die Hallelujah bye and bye  
Ill fly away  
  
When the shadows of this life have gone  
Ill fly away  
Like a bird from prison bars has flown  
Ill fly away  
  
Ill fly away O Glory  
Ill fly away  
When I die Hallelujah bye and bye  
Ill fly away  
  
Just a few more weary days and then  
Ill fly away  
To a land where joy shall never end  
Ill fly away  
  
Ill fly away O Glory  
Ill fly away  
When I die Hallelujah bye and bye  
Ill fly away
