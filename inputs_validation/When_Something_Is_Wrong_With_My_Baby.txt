When something is wrong with my baby  
Something is wrong with me  
  
I know when shes a little worried  
I feel that same old misery  
Weve been through so much together  
We stand as one and thats what makes it better  
  
When something is wrong with my baby  
Something is wrong with me  
  
Just what she means to me you out there just cant understand it  
People can say my woman shes no good  
But shes my woman and I know Im her only man  
And if hes got a problem I got to help him solve em  
  
When something is wrong with my baby  
Something is wrong with me
