Well Im a lonesome schoolboy  
And I just came into town  
Yeah Im a lonesome schoolboy  
And I just came into town  
Well I heard so much about London  
I decided to check it out  
  
Well I wait in Leicester Square  
With a comehither look in my eye  
Yeah Im leaning on Nelsons Column  
But all I do is talk to the lions  
  
Chorus  
Oh where can I get my cock sucked  
Where can I get my ass fucked  
I may have no money  
But I know where to put it every time  
  
Well I asked a young policeman  
If hed only lock me up for the night  
Well Ive had pigs in the farmyard  
Some of them some of them theyre alright  
Well he fucked me with his truncheon  
And his helmet was way too tight  
  
Chorus  
  
Im a lonesome schoolboy in your town  
Im a lonesome schoolboy
