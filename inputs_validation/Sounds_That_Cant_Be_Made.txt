Sounds that cant be made  
  
One dayll play you sounds that cant be made  
Theyll sing in you from somewhere inside your head  
Youll never hear them from the earth or the air  
Youll never hear them from the outside world  
  
Youll hear it happen inside you  
Youll hear it happen inside you  
  
Silent and high  
Silent and high  
  
Sounds that cant be made  
  
One dayll play you sounds that cant be made  
Ill feel them humming from somewhere inside your hand  
Youll never hear them from the boring ordinary tawdry world  
Youll never hear them from the anywhere you could call anywhere  
  
Ill make it happen inside you  
Ill make it happen inside you  
  
Silent and high  
Silent and high  
Silent and high  
Silent and high  
  
Sounds that cant be made  
  
One day Ill play you sounds that cant be made  
Theyll sing in us from somewhere inside our heads  
No One ever heard them but you and me  
  
Well make it happen inside us  
Well make it happen inside us  
  
Silent and High  
  
Like the wind blowin  
In the palms of my mind  
I feel the wind blowin  
In the palms of my mind  
  
Aurora Borealis shimmering green and blue  
Indigo and violent like phantoms half imagined something unreal but realer  
Than everything seeing all the planets love floating in the air caressing  
You every day  
If only we can hear them  
  
Sounds that cant be made  
Sounds that cant be made  
  
No it aint just in your mind babe  
Its inside you dig it out dig it out Its inside you  
Only love can stop you from merely exinsting  
Play me sounds that cant be made
