First you get down on your knees  
Fiddle with your rosaries  
Bow your head with great respect  
And genuflect genuflect genuflect  
  
Do what every steps you want if  
You have cleared them with the pontiff  
Everybody say his own kyrie eleison  
Doin the Vatican Rag  
  
Get in line in that processional  
Step into that small confessional  
There the guy whos got religionll  
Tell you if your sins original  
  
If it is try playin it safer  
Drink the wine and chew the wafer  
Two four six eight  
Time to transubstantiate  
  
So get down upon your knees  
Fiddle with your rosaries  
Bow your head with great respect  
And genuflect genuflect genuflect  
  
Make a cross on your abdomen  
When in Rome do like a Roman  
Ave Maria gee its good to see ya  
Gettin ecstatic and sorta dramatic and  
Doin the Vatican Rag
