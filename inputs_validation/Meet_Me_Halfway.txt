Never dreamt I would hope  
While I count the miles  
Through the wind and the rain  
I can see your smile  
There aint no turning back  
I can see it in the distance  
Got it in my sight  
  
Like a vision like a face  
Coming out of the sky  
You were there not a dream  
You were there in my eyes  
There aint no turning back  
I can see it in the distance  
Touch it through the night  
Driving into the light  
When Im on my own  
When Im all alone  
  
Wont you meet me halfway  
Wont you meet me halfway  
Is it a dream  
Is it a dream coming true  
Meet me halfway  
  
Like a vision like a face  
Coming out of the sky  
You were there not a dream  
You were there in my eyes  
There are no words to say  
I can see you in the distance  
Hear you through the night  
Aint no easy way  
When youre on your own  
When youre all alone  
  
Wont you meet me halfway  
Wont you meet me halfway  
Is it a dream  
Is it a dream coming true  
Meet me halfway
