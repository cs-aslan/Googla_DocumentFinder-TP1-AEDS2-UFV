Shes got eyes that cut you like a knife and  
Lips that taste like sweet red wine  
And pretty legs go to heaven every time  
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease  
When she walks in the room I can hardly breathe  
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees  
  
Shes got whatever it is  
It blows me away  
Shes everything I wanted to say to a woman  
But couldnt find the words to say  
Shes got whatever it is  
I dont know what to do  
Because every time I try and tell her how I feel  
It comes out I love you  
You got whatever it is  
  
You know Ive never been the type that would ever want to stay  
Bring em home at night and theyre gone the next day  
But that all changed when she walked into my life  
People ask me what it is  
I tell them I dont know  
Just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire  
Shes gonna be my wife  
  
Shes got whatever it is  
It blows me away  
Shes everything I wanted to say to a woman  
But couldnt find the words to say  
Shes got whatever it is  
I dont know what to do  
Because every time I try and tell her how I feel  
It comes out I love you  
You got whatever it is  
  
Cause when she loves me  
Girl thats how I feel  
Cause when she loves me Im on top of the world  
Because when she loves me I can live forever  
When she loves me I am untouchable  
  
Shes got whatever it is  
It blows me away  
Shes everything I wanted to say to a woman  
But couldnt find the words to say  
Shes got whatever it is  
I dont know what to do  
Because every time I try and tell her how I feel  
It comes out I love you I do  
You got whatever it is
