Ride ride my seesaw  
Take this place  
On this trip  
Just for me  
  
Ride take a free ride  
Take my place  
Have my seat  
Its for free  
  
I worked like a slave for years  
Sweat so hard just to end my fears  
Not to end my life a poor man  
But by now I know I should have run  
  
Run run my last race  
Take my place  
Have this number  
Of mine  
  
Run run like a fire  
Dont you run in  
In the lanes  
Run for time  
  
Left school with a first class pass  
Started work but as second class  
School taught one and one is two  
But right now that answer just aint true  
  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah  
  
My world is spinning around  
Everything is lost that I found  
People run come ride with me  
Lets find another place thats free  
  
Ride ride my seesaw  
Take this place  
On this trip  
Just for me  
  
Ride take a free ride  
Take my place  
Have my seat  
Its for free  
  
Ride my seesaw  
Ride ride ride my seesaw  
Ride my seesaw
