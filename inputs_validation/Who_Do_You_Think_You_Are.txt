A long time ago you promised yourself  
Theyre all gonna know me someday  
Well you got what you wanted but look at you now  
You lost something good on the way  
So where did it go Tell me where did it go  
But you wouldnt know  
Snap your fingers and somebody runs  
You dont care how they feel just as long as they come  
Got your head in the stars now youve come this far  
Just who do you think you are  
Now everything seems to be going your way  
And everyone loves what they see  
But you ruin it all with the things that you say  
So tell me how does it feel  
When youre all alone how does it feel  
Youre alone nothing is real  
Snap your fingers and somebody runs  
You dont care how they feel just as long as they come  
Got your head in the stars now youve come this far  
Just who do you think you are  
You believe a ridiculous lie  
You cant see youve become all the things you despise  
But I know who you are and youve gone too far  
Just who do you think you are  
You can keep all your dreams  
But you dont have to lose yourself  
Cause one day youre gonna break  
When the face in the mirror looking back at you  
Is a stranger that you cant place oh oh  
Just who do you think you are  
Snap your fingers and somebody runs  
You dont care how they feel just as long as they come  
Got your head in the stars now youve come this far  
Just who do you think you are  
You believe a ridiculous lie  
You cant see youve become all the things you despise  
But I know who you are and youve gone too far  
Just who do you think you are  
Oh oh oh just who do you think you are
