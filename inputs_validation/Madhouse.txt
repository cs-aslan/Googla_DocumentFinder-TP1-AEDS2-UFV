I feel a strange sensation taking over from my head to my toes  
I got the shakes body rippling its enough to shatter my bones  
  
Is it all a dream Cause I dont wanna stay awake  
But I wont remember a thing  
And now its running through my veins  
I dont know whats happening the beats so sick  
  
Running from the madhouse they wont take me back  
Got the medicines to give me what I need  
Yes Im burning up but music is my drug  
Doesnt matter if I shout or if I scream  
  
Theyre coming for me  
Theyre coming for me  
  
Everywhere I look Im shook I got bloodshot eyes  
Im like a fugitive tryna climb the walls but my hands are tied  
In just one touch and Im infected by the sound crawling all over my skin  
And the sky is falling down I dont know whats happening beats so sick  
  
Running from the madhouse they wont take me back  
Got the medicines to give me what I need  
Yes Im burning up but music is my drug  
Doesnt matter if I shout or if I scream  
  
Theyre coming for me  
Theyre coming for me  
  
Theyre coming for me oh oh  
  
Men in white coats coats getting so close close  
Saying my prayers dont take me back there  
Men in white coats coats getting so close close  
Saying my prayers dont take me back  
Take me back take me back there  
  
Theyre coming for me  
  
Running from the madhouse they wont take me back  
Got the medicines to give me what I need  
Yes Im burning up but music is my drug  
Doesnt matter if I shout or if I scream  
  
Theyre coming for me  
Its like Im running but I just cant find my way  
I dont wanna go back  
And they cant hear my voice no matter how I scream  
Theyre coming for me
