Get yourself cooler lay yourself low  
Coincidental murder with nothing to show  
When the judges constipation go to his head  
And his wifes aggravation youre soon enough dead  
Its the same old story same old song and dance my friend  
Its the same old story same old song and dance my friend  
  
Gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun  
No smoothy face lawyer to getcha undone  
Say love aint the same on the south side of town  
You could look but you aint gonna find it around  
Its the same old story same old song and dance my friend  
Its the same old story same old story  
Same old song and dance  
  
Fate comes aknockin doors start lockin  
Your old time connection change your direction  
Aint gonna change it cant rearrange it  
Cant stand the pain when its all the same to you my friend  
  
When youre low down and dirty from walkin the street  
With your old hurdygurdy no one to meet  
Say love aint the same on the south side of town  
You could look but you aint gonna find it around  
Its the same old story same old song and dance my friend  
Its the same old story same old story  
Same old song and dance
