Im coming home  
Ive been away far too long  
Im leaving it up to you  
To understand  
  
You may wonder why  
When it was me who said  
The last goodbye  
But cannot change my mind  
One more time  
  
Its high time  
I cant wait any longer  
Its my time to find out  
Who I belong to  
Its breaking my heart  
Waitin for another day  
  
When the time comes  
You wont see me around  
Ive been patient  
Standing my ground  
Gotta see ya and hold ya  
Hear what you have to say  
  
Do you wake up in the morning  
Wantin me  
The way I wake up wantin you  
And in the same breath  
You keep hauntin me  
Does it ever occur to you  
Ive been in love too long  
To stop now oh  
Ive been away too long  
Ive been away too long  
  
If youve ever cried  
Then youll know the pain  
You felt inside  
And just like me you pray  
Its all untrue  
  
But time alone will tell  
If you have learned  
Lifes lessons well  
And maybe then youll know  
What I should do  
  
Been away Ive been away  
Ive been away too long  
Ive been away too long  
Ive been away too long  
Too long much too long  
Much too long
