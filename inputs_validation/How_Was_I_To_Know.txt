My world revolved around you  
Every word was a promise I was hangin on  
Swept up inside a whirlwind  
I just couldnt see the end till you were gone  
  
I thought I would fall apart  
With shattered dreams and a broken heart  
Scramblin in the dark  
  
How was I to know  
That Id be ok  
Thought Id lose it all when you walked away  
How was I to know  
I would be this strong  
I had what it takes all along  
How was I to know  
  
What I was so afraid of  
Turned out to be my freedom in disguise  
Now i know what Im made of  
Guess it just took some time to realize  
  
I was blind I couldnt tell  
I put too much faith in someone else  
Gave up on myself  
  
How was I to know  
That Id be ok  
Thought Id lose it all when you walked away  
How was I to know  
I would be this strong  
I had what it takes all along  
How was I to know
