Were just half a dream away  
Sitting on our fences  
Building up defenses  
Making up rules by which we play  
  
Were just half way down the road  
Staking our positions  
But stupid superstitions  
Only give fools too heavy a load  
  
The magpie screeched and my window is shattered  
Her bodys bruised but her souls not battered  
The fireman tried but the hose was frozen  
The cupboards bare but the door needs closing  
  
We spend half our time away  
From being where we want to  
And seeing who its fun to  
Not blaming ourselves for our mistakes  
  
We spend half a dream away  
Just looking out of windows  
Waiting for a signal  
Waiting for night to return to day  
  
The tree was bare but the birds were singing  
The milk turned sour but my thirst needs quenching  
The meat was dead and I need me feeding  
The room was cold but the night was freezing  
  
The rainbow frowned when the sun was shining  
A babys snatched on a beautiful morning  
A dog runs wild and the brakes are screaming  
A church on fire is struck by lightning  
The dead mans hands had beautiful fingers  
The princess frowned at her lovers mistress  
She went insane and poisoned the children  
A teachers drowned and a child is laughing  
  
Were just half a dream away
