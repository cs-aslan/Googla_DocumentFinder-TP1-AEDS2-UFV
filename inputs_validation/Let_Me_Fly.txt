  
Ive been so lonely  
I cant find anyway  
So long since I lost my way  
Ive got a feeling  
Youre gonna run away one day  
Why does it always seem to be me  
  
Chorus  
So let me fly  
Let me fly like a bird in the sky  
Let me flyyy away  
I wanna climb really high  
All the time in the sky  
Wanna stay up there all the day  
So let me fly  
Let me fly like a bird in the sky  
Let me fly  
Getting away  
So after today  
Let me fly away  
  
You say youre alright  
You dont care anyway  
Im listening youre trying to say  
You think Im crazy  
Youre thinking you got everything right  
But youre fooling no one else but yourself  
  
Chorus  
  
If you get lonely  
And cant get along by yourself  
If youre finding  
Youre needing me  
Dont wait forever  
For to come a following you  
Ill wait here you come back by yourself  
  
And we can fly  
We can fly like a bird in the sky  
We can flyyy away  
We wanna climb really high  
All the time in the sky  
Wanna stay up there all the day  
So let me fly  
Let me fly like a bird in the sky  
Let me fly  
Getting away  
So after today  
Let me fly fly fly away
