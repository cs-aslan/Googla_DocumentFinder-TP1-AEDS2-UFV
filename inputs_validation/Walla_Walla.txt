Goodbye my friend youve messed up again  
Youre going to prison youre off to the pen  
Youve gotten off easy so many times  
But I guess no one told you how to get a life  
  
The judge wasnt lenient like he was before  
You got three to five and a kick out the door  
The public defender really did try  
Too little too late you didnt get a life  
  
Hey in Walla  
Ill see you in Walla Walla  
Slap on the wrist Well not this time  
Hey in Walla  
Ill see you in Walla Walla  
Folsom prison is the destination  
Hey in Walla  
Ill see you in Walla Walla  
Slap on the wrist Well not this time  
In the scheme of life were all just brothers  
Rehabilitate with all the others  
Well Ill see ya  
  
That car looked so tempting so easy to drive  
Just like that apartment that you burglarized  
You started to run but didnt get far  
Cause under your arm was a VCR  
  
Ho ho not this time my friend  
Youll be in lockdown by ten  
Im afraid you cant talk your way out of this one son  
Now four walls are your 24houraday constant companions  
  
Hey in Walla  
Ill see you in Walla Walla  
Slap on the wrist Well not this time  
Hey in Walla  
Ill see you in Walla Walla  
Folsom prison is the destination  
Hey in Walla  
Ill see you in Walla Walla  
Slap on the wrist Well not this time  
In the scheme of life were all just brothers  
Rehabilitate with all the others  
Well Ill see ya  
  
Have a nice life
