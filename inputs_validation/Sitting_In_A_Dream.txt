Im just passing time before the Ball  
Playing my guitar  
I dont have to be where I dont want to be at all  
Maybe Ill go far  
Going nowhere sitting in a dream  
Ah in a dream  
Sitting in a landscape full of sighs  
Dream away the day  
Making up a tune about the blueness of the skies  
This is where Ill stay  
Going nowhere sitting in a dream  
Oh in a dream  
Watching as a red and white balloon  
Sails across my mind  
In between the images that drift along my tune  
Smile as they unwind  
Going nowhere sitting in a dream  
Ah in a dream
