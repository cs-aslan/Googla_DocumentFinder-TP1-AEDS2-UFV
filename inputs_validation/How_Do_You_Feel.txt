So many people got so many lines  
Theyve all been tried and its true  
Theyve all got so many reasons for changin your mind  
And there aint none of em knew  
But theres just so little distance between me and you  
I think were two of a kind  
We wont do nothin you dont wanna do  
And I wont tell you no lies  
  
Chorus  
So tell me how do you feel about foolin around  
Down from your head to your toes  
Aint nothin realer than right here and now  
If thats as far as it goes  
  
And it goesand it goesand it goes  
  
Hey youll never miss nothin youve never known  
Youll never know til you try  
Hey we can take it or leave it alone  
But we got so little time  
  
Chorus  
So tell me how do you feel about foolin around  
Down from your head to your toes  
Aint nothin realer than right here and now  
If thats as far as it goes
