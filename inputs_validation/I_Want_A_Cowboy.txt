Everybody told me he was a dream  
Picture perfect like he stepped right off the silver screen  
Said that he would sweep me off my feet  
But Im still standing no he didnt do it for me  
cause I dont go for all that wine and dine  
With the ray ban fake tan never mind  
  
I want a down home up with the sun rise man  
A pickup truck driving bull riding strong steady hand  
I want the wranglers stetson and all that stuff  
I want the real McCoy  
I want a cowboy  
  
Im tired of talking bout it wasting my time  
On all the cheap talkers needing me feeding me lines  
Give me somebody whos tender but tough  
Simple and honest knows a thing or two about love  
Ive seen enough to know I know what I like  
Its the hard working head turning rugged type  
  
I want a down home up with the sun rise man  
A pickup truck driving bull riding strong steady hand  
I want the wranglers stetson and all that stuff  
I want the real McCoy  
I want a cowboy  
  
Ive seen enough to know you know what I mean  
Ride me off into the sunset thats my thing  
  
I want a down home up with the sun rise man  
A pickup truck driving bull riding strong steady hand  
I want the wranglers stetson and all that stuff  
I want the real McCoy  
I want the real McCoy  
I want a cowboy  
I want a cowboy a cowboy
