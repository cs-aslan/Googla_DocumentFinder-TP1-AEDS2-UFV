I wish  
With all my heart  
That you would stay  
And Ive never felt this way  
But here today I need to say  
  
Youre in the past  
Weve all grown up  
Without your help though  
I never wouldve thought  
That I could be whatever  
Beyond my hopes and dreams  
But you need to know  
Im gonna go my own way  
  
I guess you shouldve seen it coming  
Weve both made mistakes back then  
But ever since weve been together  
Ive learned from all of them  
Well always be together  
Yeah no matter what  
But if you listen to your heart  
You can tell them what youre not   
  
Youre in the past  
  
Weve all grown up  
Without your help though  
I never wouldve thought  
That I could be whatever  
Beyond my hopes and dreams  
But you need to know  
Im gonna go my own way  
  
Weve both been made fun of  
Had stops on our way  
But if we fight together  
Well make it through some day  
  
Youre in the past  
Weve all grown up  
Without your help though  
I never wouldve thought  
That I could be whatever  
Beyond my hopes and dreams  
But you need to know  
Im gonna go my own way  
  
Cant believe whats happened  
Through the years  
But we knew someday  
Id have to go my own way
