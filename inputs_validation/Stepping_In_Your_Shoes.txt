Like it or not  
Life is ours for the living  
Only one shot  
Whats the advice youre getting  
  
Work hard in school  
Learn the good rule and  
Try to make good for you  
No one could see  
Hanging within the balance  
Helpless me  
  
I only want help to hear me  
Evil and light  
Caught in a fight  
Theyre trying to capture me  
But you cared about me now  
Now and forever  
  
Chorus  
Therell never be anyone  
Who can take the place of you  
Therell never be anyone  
Stepping in your shoes  
Therell never be anyone  
Giving it all to pull me through  
Therell never be anyone therell never be anyone  
Stepping in your shoes  
  
Only through you  
Sin on innocent shoulders  
Could you undo  
Darkness power to hold us  
Once for all time  
Choosing to die  
Ill never deserve you  
And you cared about me now  
Now and forever  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh  
Oh  
There will never be anyone  
Stepping in your shoes  
There will never be anyone  
Stepping in your shoes  
  
Chorus Repeat 3X
