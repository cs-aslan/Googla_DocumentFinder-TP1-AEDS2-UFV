The blues are in the air tonight  
Love has gone and passed me by without a warning  
I light up another cigarette  
The pain hasnt hit me yet but I know its comin  
  
And your perfume lingers still upon my pillow case  
The tears just started fallin down upon my face  
I lie here in the loneliness with this memory of you  
  
I dont know where you are tonight  
Im starin at the candlelight and I miss you babe  
In the darkness here all by myself  
I imagine you with someone else Im gong crazy  
  
And with everything about you dancing in my head  
Girl I sure am lonely in this empty bed  
I lie here in the loneliness with this memory of you  
  
And your perfume lingers still upon my pillow case  
And the tears just keep fallin down upon my face  
I lie here in the loneliness with this memory of you  
  
The blues are in the air tonight  
Love has gone and passed me by
