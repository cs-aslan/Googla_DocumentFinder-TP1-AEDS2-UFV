I have a friend and its an earthworm  
It burrows underground deep within the soil  
Sometimes when it rains it comes out  
And we talk about our day  
  
I have a friend and shes a butterfly  
She flies from flower to flower drinking sweet nectar  
With hundreds of friends  
They sleep up in the trees at night  
  
I have a friend and hes a dragonfly  
He sweeps around all day and hovers in the air  
Hes colorful and wonderful  
His wings are strong and powerful  
Hes the dragonfly  
  
These are my friends  
Even though they are bugs  
They have a big role in our world  
Even though theyre bugs  
  
I have a friend and its an earthworm  
I have a friend and shes a butterfly  
I have a friend and hes a dragonfly  
They are my friends and yeah theyre all insects
