Tending my fruit tending my fruit  
Ah youve got to have a hobby  
A man must have a shed to keep him sane  
  
Spraying my buds spraying my buds  
Got to keep away diseases  
I mix the poisons and the wife dont complain  
  
Some people say  
That I am out of my tree  
Or just a strawberry fool  
Someday theyll see  
Til then Ill blow you a raspberry  
cause apples and pears are me  
  
So Im tending my fruit  
And I dont give a hoot  
Cause it keeps me sane it keeps me sane
