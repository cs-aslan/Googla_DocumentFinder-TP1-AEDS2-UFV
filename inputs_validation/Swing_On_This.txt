Mother said come home  
Father said come home  
Sisters said come home  
So my friends said come home  
  
I said  
Let me be Im alright  
Cant you see Im just fine  
Little skinny okay  
Im asleep anyway  
Then I heard a voice  
  
Said son you have a choice  
I then slapped my face  
Let me be Im okay  
Im awake anyway  
Its too bright over there  
I can shift cannot steer  
  
So I drive them away  
For a while then I stay  
Little skinny okay  
Im awake anyway  
Now I have to go home  
Do as when in Rome  
  
Let me be Im alright  
Cant you see Im just fine  
Little skinny okay  
Im asleep anyway  
Let me be Im okay  
Im awake anyway  
Tobys still laughing It sounds fuckin pretty good  
Im laughing Thats tight as shit what are you talkin about
