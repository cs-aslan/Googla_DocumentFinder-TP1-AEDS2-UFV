Okay first of all Lyfe Jennings sings this NOT pitbull  
  
  
  
1st Vrs  
HmmmmmMmmmm x2Yeah  
Must be nice  
Having someone who understands the life you live  
Must be nice  
Having someone whos slow to take and quick to give  
Must be nice  
Having someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick  
Someone whos smile is bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion  
Must be nice  
Having someone who loves you despite your faults  
Must be nice  
Having someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk  
Must be nice  
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too  
Someone who loves you for sho  
You just remember to never let em go  
  
Chorus  
Even when your hustling days are gone  
Shell be by your side still holding on  
Even when those 20s stop spinning  
And all those golddigging women disappear  
Shell still be here  
  
2nd Vrs  
Must be nice  
Having someone you can come home to from a long day of work  
Must be nice  
Having someone you dont have to show they know exactly where it hurts  
Must be nice  
Having someone who trusts you despite what theyve heard  
Someone as mighty as a lion but still as gentle as a bluebird  
Must be nice  
Having someone you dont have to tell you dont want to be alone  
Must be nice  
Having someone you can grow old with until God calls yall home  
Must be nice  
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too  
Someone who loves you for sho  
You just remember to never let em go  
  
Chorus x4
