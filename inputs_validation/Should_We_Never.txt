Ive been so caught up in the thought of me and you  
Even though I love someone else I know my heart belongs to you  
Tell me how did we ever let the situation get this far  
Maybe we should just try to hide the things we feel inside  
Things I know we cant deny  
  
Shouldve never told you that I cared about you  
Didnt think that it would be so bad  
Shouldve never kissed you shouldve never held your hand  
Got to find a way to let these feelings go  
  
What did I do the day I let you slip into my soul  
It was then when I realized that I would always want you in my life  
No one else can know of the things that weve been saying  
On the telephone it would be so bad if they ever knew  
That me and you were secretly into each other  
  
Shouldve never told you that I cared about you  
Didnt think that it would be so bad  
Shouldve never kissed you shouldve never held your hand  
Got to find a way to let these feelings go  
  
Im so scared trembling inside cause Im feeling  
Like somebody else already knows  
Oh my God I love you both so much  
But to have to choose between the two  
Is hurting me so deep inside  
  
Shouldve never told you that I cared about you  
Didnt think that it would be so bad  
Shouldve never kissed you shouldve never held your hand  
I dont ever wanna feel this way again  
  
Shouldve never told you that I cared about you  
Shouldve never kissed you shouldve never held your hand  
Shouldve never told you that I cared about you  
  
Shouldve never kissed you shouldve never held your hand  
Shouldve never told you that I cared about you  
Shouldve never kissed you shouldve never held your hand  
  
Shouldve never told you that I cared about you  
Shouldve never kissed you shouldve never held your hand  
Shouldve never told you that I cared about you  
  
Shouldve never kissed you shouldve never held your hand  
Shouldve never told you that I cared about you  
Shouldve never kissed you shouldve never held your hand
