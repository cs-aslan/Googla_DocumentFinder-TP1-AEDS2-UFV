You can run and you can hide  
You can tell me youre untrue  
You can play around with my feelings  
Say you found somebody new  
But theres one thing you cant do  
You cant stop me loving you  
  
You know I love you baby  
Why do you treat me this way  
I dont deserve this kind of treatment  
And Id have been so good like a lover should  
And Id have loved you anyway  
  
You can run and you can hide  
You can tell me youre untrue  
You can play around with my feelings  
Say you found somebody new  
But theres one thing you cant do  
You cant stop me loving you  
  
Youre gonna drive me crazy honey  
Why are you so blind  
Cool aw you think youre so cool now baby  
But you just cant see all the love in me  
When I give you all the time  
  
I know Im gonna be fine  
You aint gonna pull my chain  
I aint gonna change my mind  
  
How do you feel baby  
I bet you feel real tall  
Why did you leave your manhunt honey  
When I give you love and its not enough  
And you try to make me look small
