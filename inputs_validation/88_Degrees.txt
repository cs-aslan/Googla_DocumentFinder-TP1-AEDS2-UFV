Stuck in LA aint got no friends  
And so Hollywood nuts  
Too many dead ends  
Life on the streets is no where to live  
Do I pack my bags or dare switch  
Just sold my car I sold it for junk  
I cant pay my rent so I take the bus  
Its the first time  
I been in such a cold place  
Where the temperature is 88  
  
Chorus  
88 degrees  
Lord its so hot so damn hot  
Trying to make a deal  
But somehow Im stopped  
Cause the pace is so heavy  
Maybe it cause the weather  
Yeah yeah  
  
Im set in the mood for you  
You remember the time  
You remember the time  
  
Yes Im the deal for a whole lot of dough  
Im hoping success turns ten years to gold  
Finally Im happening and I set in the press  
You ask me what its like to be famous  
  
Chorus  
  
Remember the time  
Cause when in your face  
You could start to get angry  
Is it me or just this place  
One thing is for sure  
You got to work so hard  
Sure feels this aint no place  
For broken hearts  
Just ask me tomorrow if you love you  
  
Chorus  
  
Stuck in LA aint go no friends  
And so Hollywood nuts  
Too many dead ends  
Life on the streets is no where to live  
You ask me what its like to be famous  
  
Chorus
