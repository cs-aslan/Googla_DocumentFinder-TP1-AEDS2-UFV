How bout a round of applause  
Standin ovation  
Oh  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
You look so dumb right now  
Standin outside my house  
Tryin to apologize  
Youre so ugly when you cry  
Please  
Just cut it out  
  
Dont tell me youre sorry cause youre not  
Baby when I know youre only sorry you got caught  
  
Chorus  
But you put on quite a show  
You really had me goin  
But now its time to go  
Curtains finally closin  
That was quite a show  
Very entertaining  
But its over now  
Go on and take a bow  
  
Grab your clothes and get gone  
You better hurry up  
Before the sprinklers come on  
Talkin bout Girl I love you youre the one  
This just looks like a rerun  
Please  
What else is on  
  
And dont tell me youre sorry cause youre not  
Baby when I know youre only sorry you got caught  
  
Chorus  
  
And the award for the best liar goes to you  
For makin me believe  
That you could be  
Faithful to me  
Lets hear your speech out  
Oh  
  
How bout a round of applause  
Standin ovation  
  
Chorus  
  
But its over now
