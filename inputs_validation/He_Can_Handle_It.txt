Written by Kirk Franklin  
CHORUS  
It really doesnt matter  
What youre going through  
I know that Jesus can work it out for you  
His yoke is easy and His burden light  
Just give it to Jesus  
Hell make it alright  
He can handle it  
He can handle it  
Repeat  
He can handle it  
Theres no doubt about my savior  
I know He will deliver  
He can handle it  
Theres no doubt about my savior  
I know He will deliver  
Whatever it is  
He can handle it  
Repeat  
He can 4xs  
Repeat  
He can  
Handle it  
He can  
If you know He can say yes  
Yes  
Repeat 2xs
