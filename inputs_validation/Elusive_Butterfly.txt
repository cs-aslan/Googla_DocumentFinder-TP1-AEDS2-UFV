You might wake up some morning  
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind  
And if youre quick enough to rise  
Youll catch the fleeting glimpse of someones fading shadow  
Out on the new horizon you may see the floating motion of a distant pair of
wings  
And if the sleep has left your ears  
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow  
Dont be concerned it will not harm you  
Its only me pursuing something Im not sure of  
Across my dreams with nets of wonder I chase the bright elusive butterfly of
love  
  
You might have heard my footsteps  
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind  
I might have even called your name as I ran searching after something to
believe in  
You might have seen me runnin  
Through the long abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind  
If you remember something there  
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathing  
Dont be concerned it will not harm you  
Its only me pursuing something Im not sure of  
Across my dreams with nets of wonder I chase the bright elusive butterfly of
love  
I chase the bright butterfly of love I chase the bright butterfly of love  
Bubububutterfly of love bubububutterfly of love
