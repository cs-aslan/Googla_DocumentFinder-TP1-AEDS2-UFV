Run in circles again tonight  
Hump the moon again tonight  
Gonna wear my dancin shoes out tonight  
Gonna have myself a big time again tonight  
  
Again tonight  
Again tonight  
Again tonight  
  
Girls got lightning  
Underneath her skirt  
Boys try to touch it  
For whatever its worth  
In the morning  
Shes just gonna be hurt  
She wonders is it worth it again tonight  
  
Again tonight  
Again tonight  
Again tonight  
  
Gonna catch the cloud tonight  
Nine cloud nine  
Gonna try and catch that cloud tonight  
Nine cloud nine  
Again tonight  
  
Can you hold me baby again again tonight  
Can you sing  
Can you dance baby  
Can you sing  
Can you hold me again tonight  
Baby can you sing  
  
Get ego tripn again tonight  
Tell the same lies they work all right  
Gonna wear my dancin shoes out tonight  
Probably make a fool of myself again tonight  
  
Again tonight  
Again tonight  
Again tonight  
  
Again tonight  
Again tonight  
Again tonight
