Deafeated by Octavian  who we  we dont respect  
Factum killed in Actum  as my poor Ant  has been decked  
Yeah  I was wrecked  
Now its T H E E N D  
Im sure that spells the end for me  
Octavian will display me in a cage  
The world will gloat  
I cant go on sung for a long time till next line  
Wont be paraded round the streets  
Octavian long time  
Not your extoic parakeet  
Wont your spoils from victory  
Ill spoil your party  
I cant go on long time  
Antony  
Im miserable  Im so depressed  
How did it  
Come to this  
Octavian dont like me  
Cause I dumped his  
Plain old sis  
For Queen Isis  
Cleopatra  
Im trying to sustain our rule  
Dont hold me up to ridicule  
Snap out of this  you moping fool  
Youre not helping at all   
Antony  
I cant go on long time  
Without my sweet Roman romance  
My love has gone  
Living alone  not in my plans  
Octavian my boss   
Id sooner eat my hair  
I cant go on long time  
Octavian  
I must try and capture Cleo  
Cleopatra  
Octavian must not take meo  
Antony  
Shell kill herself just for me   
She must adore me   
 Cleopatra  
Ill foil Octavian with this plot  
Antony  
Shes dead   
Cleopatra  
Not yet Im not   
Octavian  
She must not die long time  
So much more popular than me  
Cleopatra  
And so I die long time  
Octavian  
Thisll look bad on my CV  
Antony and Cleo gone  
What a blooming pair of drama queens  long time  
So all hail meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
