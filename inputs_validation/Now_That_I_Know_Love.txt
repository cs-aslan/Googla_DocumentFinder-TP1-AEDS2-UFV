How do I know if Im in love  
Who could I ever learn to trust  
I asked myself these questions for so long  
What do I only wish to see  
What do I truly know to be  
I told myself to hold on tight  
You never know enough  
But now I see what I believe  
Cause Im believin love  
  
Chorus  
Whether my minds sayin its crazy  
Whether my worlds sayin Im wrong  
Wherever my heart goes thats where I belong  
I finally found out what faith is  
I follow the way that it feels  
And heaven has never been more real  
  
When you looked into me  
And you laid your hands on me  
At once the deaf could hear  
The blind could see  
Now that I Know Love  
  
I was a child alone asleep  
You came along and cradled me  
You took me in your arms  
And rocked me so sweetly  
Id prayed for love  
To come to pass  
How do we know if love will last  
And if it cant then someone tell me  
What were livin for  
I dont know what tomorrow holds  
But I know what I know  
  
Chorus  
  
Glory be I believe  
Oh I finally see that love isnt blind  
Cause Ive never seen more clearly in my life  
Now that I Know Love
