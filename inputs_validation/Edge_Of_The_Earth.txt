I spent a lot of time looking for me in your eyes  
I spent a lot of nights sleeping on the end of our bed  
Then I realize that this time time wont tell  
People like myself cant compromise this well  
  
And I wont fall off the edge of the earth  
Wont let go so easily  
I wont fall off the edge of the earth  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me  
  
Said a lot of words that you never wanted to hear  
Used myself up trying to explain and be clear  
Then I realize we mean the things we say  
When you turn the page the words dont go away  
  
And I wont fall off the edge of the earth  
Wont let go so easily  
I wont fall off the edge of the earth  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me  
  
Christopher Columbus aint got much on me  
And maybe just like Moses I will part the sea  
  
And I wont fall off the edge of the earth  
Wont let go so easily  
I wont fall off the edge of the earth  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me  
  
No I wont fall off the edge of the earth  
I wont let go just wait and see  
I wont fall off the edge of the earth  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me
