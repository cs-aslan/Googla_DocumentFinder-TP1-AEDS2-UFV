Treated like a refugee  
Never seems to be a place for me  
In my mind there is a scene i see  
My house is burning  
Noone returning  
To a land once free  
  
Dreaming like a deportee  
Cast away upon the open sea  
No hand of friendship for the likes of me  
I feel the thunder  
Im going under  
And i cant get free  
  
If there is a heaven  
I dont want to hang around this hell  
I could be an angel  
Let god slip out of heaven back to hell  
  
And i say  
I wont cry no more tears  
I wont cry no more tears  
  
Carry me away from here  
Cut the crying and the seethrough tear  
Make emotion dissappear  
My life is changing  
Im rearranging  
Everything i feel
