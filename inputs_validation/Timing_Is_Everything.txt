If I didnt know better I would swear you dont care  
Throw yourself around hold me down  
I can see through you  
Youre so fucking bullheaded tormented I dont get it  
Thrown your weight around hold me down  
I can see right through you  
Timing here is everything and everything means everything  
I can see right through you  
Timing here is everything and everything means everything  
I can see right through you  
Timing here is everything and everything means everything  
I can see right  
Think Im gonna be sick  
You take anything to get through  
You always got something to prove  
And you want it all  
What you got aint enough  
What you got aint enough  
What you got aint enough  
Come on come on alright alright
