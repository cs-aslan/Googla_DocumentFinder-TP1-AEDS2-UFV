Chorus  
I lock myself inside my room  
I want to be alone  
With you around youll only add on  
I want to be alone  
Its been disturbed by my thoughts  
I want to be alone  
With you around youll only add on  
I want to be alone  
  
Please dont think Im crazy  
I dont want you to understand  
My mind is growing hazy  
To heck with your helping hand  
Why dont you just leave me alone  
This conflict is my own  
Keep your sources away from me  
Thats all  
  
Chorus  
  
Please dont think Im crazy  
I dont want you to understand  
My mind is growing hazy  
To heck with your helping hand  
Why dont you just leave me alone  
This conflict is my own  
Keep your sources away from me  
Thats all  
  
Chorus  
  
Please dont think Im crazy  
I dont want you to understand  
My mind is growing hazy  
To heck with your helping hand  
Why dont you just leave me alone  
This conflict is my own  
Keep your sources away from me  
Thats all
