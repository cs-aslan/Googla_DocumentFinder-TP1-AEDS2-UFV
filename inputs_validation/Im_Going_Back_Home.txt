Im going back home where I was born  
First I planned to stay but I cant live this way  
Im going back home where I was born  
  
Try to understand I think this citys grand  
But with all its charm give me the little country farm  
Im going back home where I was born  
  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah now oh yeah  
I tell you all about it I think you ought to know  
Tell you all about it why I want to go  
  
I miss the country preacher and the house of prayer  
I miss the bootlegger smelling in the air  
Miss friendly faces and the country smiles  
The crickets singing you can hear it for miles  
  
Miss the rooster crowing at the break of dawn  
Yes it all happens where I was born  
Miss the fried chicken colored greens  
Miss the hot biscuits and the lima beans  
Miss the prayer meeting where the people pray  
With the drum beating till the break of day  
  
You can have it you can have it  
You can have it you can have it  
You can have thy town I wont be around  
This here lifes too fast but ll never never last  
  
Im going back home where I was born  
I got to go home got to go home  
Where the people are real people can feel  
Got to go down got to go down  
  
Leave here today on my way so long so long  
Going back home going back home  
Got to go home got to go home  
Got to go home got to go home  
Where I where I was born
