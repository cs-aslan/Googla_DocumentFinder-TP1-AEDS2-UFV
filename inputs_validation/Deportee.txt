The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting  
The oranges are piled in their creosote dumps  
Youre flying them back to the mexican border  
To pay all their money to wade back again  
Goodbye to my juan goodbye rosalita  
Adios mis amigos jesus and maria  
You wont have a name when you ride the big airplane  
All they will call you will be deportee  
  
Some of us are illegal and some of us are not wanted  
Our work contracts out and we have to move on  
But its 600 miles to that mexican border  
They chase us like outlaws like rustlers like theives  
  
Goodbye to my juan goodbye rosalita  
Adios mis amigos jesus and maria  
You wont have a name when you ride the big airplane  
All they will call you will be deportee  
  
My fathers own father waded that river  
They took all the money he made in his life  
My brothers and sister come work the fruit trees  
They rode the truck til they took down and died  
  
The airplane caught fire over los gatos canyon  
A fireball of lightning that shook all our hills  
Who are these dear friends all scattered like dry leaves  
The radio said they were just deportees  
  
Goodbye to my juan goodbye rosalita  
Adios mis amigos jesus and maria  
You wont have a name when you ride the big airplane  
All they will call you will be deportee  
  
No all they will call you will be deportee  
All they will call you will be deportee
