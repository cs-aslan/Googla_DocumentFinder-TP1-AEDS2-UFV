isnt it strange  
that the stars dont shine no more now since youre gone  
isnt it strange  
that we cant look back and see just what went wrong  
  
i wanna know now where we are  
should i pretend and let things be  
and knowing what youve done  
could you come face to face with me  
  
isnt it strange  
that you told me one thing and suddenly changed your mind  
isnt it strange  
that youd come here for me turn away and leave me behind  
  
now it feels like im drowning  
feels like im drowning without you  
i know the feeling  
cause ive felt this all before  
  
i hope you dont feel just like me  
i hope you dont feel just like me  
i hope you dont feel just like me  
i hope youre happy  
  
isnt it strange  
that the world seems to turn away when i try to explain  
why its so strange  
that two can be as one yet not the same  
  
and it feels like im drowning  
feels like im drowning without you  
i know the feeling  
cause ive felt this all before  
and it feels like im dying  
feels like im dying now i know the truth  
  
i hope you dont feel just like me  
i hope you dont feel just like me  
i hope you dont feel just like me  
i hope youre happy  
  
dont feel just like me  
i hope you dont feel just like me  
i hope you dont feel just like me  
i hope youre happy  
  
dont feel just like me  
i hope you dont feel just like me  
fuck i hope you feel much worse than me  
maybe not so happy  
  
not so happy yeah  
not so happy yeah  
not so happy  
welcome to my world  
  
not so happy yeah  
not so happy yeah  
not so happy  
welcome to my world
