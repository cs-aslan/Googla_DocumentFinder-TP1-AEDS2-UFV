The lanes were silent  
There was nothing no one nothing around for miles  
I doused our friendly venture  
With a hardfaced  
Threeword gesture  
  
I started something  
I forced you to a zone  
And you were clearly  
Never meant to go  
Hair brushed and parted  
Typical me typical me  
Typical me  
I started something  
And now Im not too sure  
  
I grabbed you by the guilded beams  
Uh thats what tradition means  
And I doused another venture  
With a gesture  
That wasabsolutely vile  
  
I started something  
I forced you to a zone  
And you were clearly  
Never meant to go  
Hair brushed and parted  
Typical me typical me  
Typical me  
I started something  
And now Im not too sure  
  
I grabbed you by the guilded beams  
Uh thats what tradition means  
And now eighteen months hard labour  
Seemsfair enough  
  
I started something  
And I forced you to a zone  
And you were clearly  
Never meant to go  
Hair brushed and parted  
Typical me typical me  
Typical me  
I started something  
And now Im not too sure  
  
I started something  
I started something  
Typical me typical me  
Typical me typical me  
Typical me typical me  
Typical me  
I started something  
And now Im not too sure  
  
OK Stephen Do that again
