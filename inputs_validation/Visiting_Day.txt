Baby please dont turn your back on me  
Lets walk along these cobblestones  
To a simpler time  
And why cant we just take a look around us  
I want to see the things that make you smile  
Like an orphan child on a visiting day  
Baby baby wont you come my way  
  
Baby please why wont you talk to me  
Seems the more I give the more you cry  
To please you  
And why cant we just take a look around us  
I want to see the things that make you smile  
Like an orphan child on a visiting day  
Baby baby wont you come my way  
Come my way  
  
Sometimes Im feeling all alone  
Each place is just an empty space  
And no rhyme or reason I run this stupid human race  
So take all my money and just have yourself a time  
Hope your having a good time  
  
Baby please dont be so sad today  
Just drive on up to Thacker mountain  
Up to Tennessee  
And why cant we just take a look around us  
I want to see the things that make you smile  
And why cant we just take a look around us  
I want to see the things that make you smile  
Like an orphan child on a visiting day  
Baby baby wont you come my way  
Come my way
