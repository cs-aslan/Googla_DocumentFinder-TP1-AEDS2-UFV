Mamma  
You gave life to me  
Turned a baby into a lady  
  
And mamma  
All you had to offer  
Was the promise of a lifetime of love  
  
Now I know  
There is no other  
Love like a mothers love for her child  
  
And I know  
A love so complete  
Someday must leave  
Must say goodbye  
  
Goodbyes the saddest word Ill ever hear  
Goodbyes the last time I will hold you near  
Someday youll say that word and I will cry  
Itll break my heart to hear you say goodbye  
  
Mamma  
You gave love to me  
Turned a young one into a woman  
  
And mamma  
All I ever needed  
Was a guarantee of you loving me  
  
Cause I know  
There is no other  
Love like a mothers love for her child  
  
And it hurts so  
That something so strong  
Someday will be gone must say goodbye  
  
Goodbyes the saddest word Ill ever hear  
Goodbyes the last time I will hold you near  
Someday youll say that word and I will cry  
Itll break my heart to hear you say goodbye  
  
But the love you give will always live  
Youll always be there every time I fall  
You offered me the greatest love of all  
You take my weakness and you make me strong  
And I will always love you till forever comes  
  
And when you need me  
Ill be there for you always  
Ill be there your whole life through  
Ill be there this I promise you mamma  
  
Ill be your beacon through the darkest nights  
Ill be the wings that guide your broken flight  
Ill be your shelter through the raging storm  
And I will love you till forever comes  
  
Goodbyes the saddest word Ill ever hear  
Goodbyes the last time I will hold you near  
Someday youll say that word and I will cry  
Itll break my heart to hear you say goodbye  
  
Till we meet again  
Until then  
Goodbye
