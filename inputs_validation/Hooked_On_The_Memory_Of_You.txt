Stay with me here with me  
I want you near with me  
Im a man  
Thats hooked on the memory  
Of you and I who knows why  
I only know that Im sure I am  
Hooked on the memory of you  
  
Time time standing still  
I know its you I always will  
Need you too  
Lay with me lie with me  
Spend your desire with me if you can  
Im hooked on the memory  
Of you and I who knows why  
I guess I just wanted for you to be  
Hooked on the memory of me  
  
Time time standing still  
I know its you I always will  
Want you to be here with me  
I want you to stay right here with me  
I need you to love with me  
Laugh with me  
Forgive the past with me  
I know you can  
  
Im hooked on the memory  
Of you and I who knows why  
Guess I just wanted for you to be  
Hooked on the memory of me  
Oh you know that its true  
Not a thing I can do  
Im hooked on the memory of you
