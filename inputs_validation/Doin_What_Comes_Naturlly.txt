Folks are dumb where I come from  
They aint had any learnin  
Still theyre happy as can be  
  
Doin what comes naturally  
Doin what comes naturally  
  
Folks like us could never fuss  
With schools and books and learnin  
Still weve gone from A to Z  
  
Doin what comes naturally  
Doin what comes naturally  
  
You dont have to know how to read or write  
When youre out with a feller in the pale moonlight  
You dont have to look in a book to find  
What he thinks of the moon or what is on his mind  
  
That comes naturally  
That comes naturally  
  
My uncle out in Texas  
Cant even write his name  
He signs his checks with Xs  
But they cash em just the same  
  
If you saw my pa and ma  
Youd no they had no learnin  
Still they raised a family  
  
Doin what comes naturally  
Doin what comes naturally  
  
Uncle Jed has never read  
An almanac on drinkin  
Still hes always on a spree

Sister Sal whos musical  
Has never had a lesson  
Still shes learned to sing offkey  
  
Doin what comes naturally

You dont have to go to a private school  
Not to pick up a penny by a stubborn mule  
You dont have to have a professors dome  
Not to go for the honey when the bees at home  
  
That comes naturally  
That comes naturally  
  
My tiny baby brother  
Whos never read a book  
Knows one sex from the other  
All he had to do was look

With someone he just married  
There he is at ninetythree

Although she goes out shoppin  
She gets all her stockings free

But she left school with honors  
She got every known degree

You dont have to come from a great big town  
Not to clean out a stable in an evening gown  
You dont have to mix with the Vanderbilts  
Not to take off your panties when youre wearing kilts  
  
That comes naturally  
That comes naturally  
  
My mothers cousin Carrie  
Wont ever change her name  
She doesnt want to marry  
And her children feel the same  
  
Sister Rose has lots of beaus  
Although we have no parlor  
She does fine behind a tree
