Dont go away yet  
I havent felt this dead in years  
This rooms full of people  
With drinks in their hands and nothing but nothing to say  
  
Dont go away yet  
It seems like everyone I love is gone  
Im praying for some kind of change  
Nothings changed and nothing will change  
  
Dont leave me now you are the only thing left to believe in  
Dont let me down you are the last thing that I feel complete in  
  
Dont go away yet  
True love is dying off  
Where everyone is searching  
Im just a face in the crowd  
  
Said you wanted distance this is what you get  
The distance was half near far enough  
I could take it all if you come back I dreamed of you and it came true
