Just come back where I came from  
Looks the same as somethings wrong  
And all my friends that used to be  
Have gone and turned their backs on me  
Everyones got different views  
Now Im all shook up and all confused  
  
East is West left is right  
Up is down and black is white  
Insideout wrong is right  
Its back to front and Im all uptight  
  
Ive just come back from fantasy  
Right back to reality  
Stayed away too long but now Ive found  
My world is turning upsidedown  
I dont fit in but I dont stand out  
I should stay cool but want to shout  
  
East is West left is right  
Up is down and black is white  
Insideout wrong is right  
Its back to front and Im all uptight  
  
No one knows where I come from
