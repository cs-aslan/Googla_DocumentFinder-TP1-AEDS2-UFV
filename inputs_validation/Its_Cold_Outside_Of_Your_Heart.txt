The harder I try seems the further I fall  
The deeper my love seems to be  
And I know that I never doubted at all  
That someone was waiting for me  
Then out of the blue it was over  
And how did you think I would survive  
Cause its cold outside  
Yes its cold outside of your heart  
Yes its cold outside  
Yes its cold outside of your heart  
I never thought it could happen to me  
Like the one that gets you  
That you just dont see  
And now I dont want to be free  
I thought it was always to be  
That someone was waiting for me  
The longer the shadows become in my life  
The colder the breeze seems to be  
The days roll on by still I cant quite believe  
That someones not waiting for me  
The flame of desire is still burning  
The warmth of your body close to mine  
Cause its cold outside  
Yes its cold outside of your heart  
Yes its cold outside  
Yes its cold outside of your heart  
Its a big world to face all alone  
And Im begging you now  
Just to come on home  
Cause I I dont want to be free  
I thought it was always to be  
That someone was waiting for me  
You know that its you that I need  
You see I refuse to believe  
That someones not waiting for me
