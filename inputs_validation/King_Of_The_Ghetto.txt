Hook  2x  
This is my wooooooorld  
ZRo king of the ghettoooooo  
ZRo  
Once upon a time not long ago  
There was a hustling motherfucker with a cold ass flow  
Everytime he hit the studio his beeper go off  
He left the beef to get his cheese by selling people that raw  
With a pistol on his right side and one in his back  
I10 again and again from running that crack  
Girlfriend kept complaining cause he never at home  
So he told her deal with it bitch or get the fuck on  
It was money over bitches on his mind  
Plus all of his partnas thought that he would never shine  
The number be 15 and 5 up in the kitchen  
He could do it straight up or he could do it with a whipping  
But then came a drought and then he put his first album out  
Decided to do it full time cause record stores kept selling out  
Still in the game cocaine on top of the brain  
From the studio to the streets ZRo is everything  
Hook  2x  
ZRo  
King of the ghetto Im sitting on my throne  
Got a red light sitting on my chrome  
Ridgemont Texas representing  
With a taper fade sitting on my dome  
I mash niggaz and I trash niggaz  
When it come down to the cash nigga  
Beat that ass in a flash nigga  
Pistol play and Ima blast nigga  
Gangstafied from Goderhead  
All day long I chase my bread  
But on the low I dont fuck with FEDs  
Cause a snitch nigga get dressed in red  
Shut up bitch she look so lie  
But they dont know shell take your life  
Not giving a fuck or get fucked up  
And end up dead with your dick in the sky  
Go my way we gon have fun  
Instead of happiness we have done  
About our business corrupting our kidneys  
All that codeine weed and drugs  
Im leaning over but still a soldier  
Pimp my pen like Im suppose to  
Nothing but the finest light green doja  
Got it from seeNote from the Clover  
Animal thug I thug for life  
So I aint going to the club tonight  
Block is bleeding Im here for the eating  
And supervising my funds tonight  
I scuffle and hustle on my grind  
No matter the weather no matter the time  
Roll out the red carpet for ZRo this world is mine  
Hook  2x  
ZRo  
Who that bumping who that beefing  
Hope you brought something to put your chief in  
Interrupting me while Im reefer chiefing  
Im a gangsta not Erkle Steven  
Cause I dont laugh and I dont play  
And no is something that I dont say  
I dont give a motherfuck about your day  
Hoe get the fuck out of my way  
Im lean as fuck and dont like nobody  
My style of rap is Im like nobody  
I let off fo shots and hit fo bodies  
OG with it like Amas Rodney  
Still in the game as a MVP  
Dealing with haters that envy me  
Fuck fabricated and commercializing  
Ima bring my block to MTV  
Show love and do all I can  
For all my people and all my fans  
But motherfuckers be hating me  
For the life of me I cant understand  
Cause Im cool as hell till a hater get bold  
Step out of line fuck around get stoled  
I must be their motherfucking issue  
Cause all these niggaz getting drove  
Up a lot like a Volkswagon  
I get a commission for toe tagging  
A slim killa with a wide body  
Polo top and Polo sagging  
I live my life like I dont care  
But every night I be deep in prayer  
Then I get off my knees  
And hustle straight like that there  
Hook  2x
