Theres a hammer in my heart  
Pounding out your name  
Theres a hammer in my heart  
Here it comes again  
  
I hear a certain sound  
And it just wont go away  
It sends a message out  
Whats it gonna be today  
  
It wakes me up at dawn  
And as the day goes on  
I try to turn it off but the beat goes on  
It never lets me rest  
  
I cant get a minutes peace  
I lay awake in bed  
Wondering will it ever cease  
Its like a top ten song  
  
I hear it all day long  
I try to turn it off but the beat goes on
