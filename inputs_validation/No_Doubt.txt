Where it is you wont say but it hurts  
Put your lips next to mine and apart  
Why wont you open your heart  
I feel it coming it grows up my spine  
  
Im dying to show you what love is about  
The tears that are falling  
Theres no room for doubt  
For all the changes weve been through  
  
Its an art just to give will I learn  
To visualize what you want from my life  
Its more than enough just to gaze in your eyes  
Im dying to show you what love is about  
  
To tease you and please you  
We must work it out  
I know all your secrets so sad  
For all the changes weve been through
