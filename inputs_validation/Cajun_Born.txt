I was born on the bayou thirty miles of Lafayettes  
My daddy was a Cajun man Lord he thought us how to plow  
I remember Mamas breakfast cush cush and a kaye  
Being served on a banyee Lord I wish I had some now  
Im a Cajun born Im a Cajun bred  
And when I die Im a Cajun dead  
If I die in Alaska if I die in Ohio  
This soul will find its way back to the bayou  
We went to church every Sunday we had a French speaking preacher man  
Joked about the preacher man cause we thought he wore a dress yes  
After church we had a party we played the music on the phonograph  
We had a man singing Jole Blon oh made a sinner out of me  
Im a Cajun born Im a Cajun bred  
And when I die Im a Cajun dead  
If I die in Alaska if I die in Ohio  
This soul will find its way back to the bayou  
When Im ready to be married going to be this Cajun lady  
Someone sort of like my Mama  
Cause I aint know other kind dont know other kind  
Wherever fortune takes me if it makes me or it breaks me  
Its memories will forsake me Louisiana on my mind  
Im a Cajun born Im a Cajun bred  
And when I die Im a Cajun dead  
If I die in Alaska if I die in Ohio  
This soul will find its way back to the bayou  
If I die in Alaska if I die in Ohio  
This soul will find its way back to the bayou
