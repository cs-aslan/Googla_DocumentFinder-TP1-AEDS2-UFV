I never meant to hurt no one  
Nobody ever tore me down like you  
I think you knew it all along  
And now youll never see my face again  
I never meant to hurt nobody  
And will I ever see the sun again  
I wonder where the guilt had gone  
I think of what I have become  
And still  
I never meant to hurt nobody  
Now Im taking what is mine  
  
Letting go of my mistakes  
Build a fire from what Ive learned  
And watch it fade away  
Because I have no heart to break  
I cannot fake it like before  
I thought that I could stay the same  
And now I know that Im not sure  
I even love me anymore  
  
I never meant to hurt no one  
Sometimes you gotta look the other way  
It never shouldve lasted so long  
Ashamed youll never see my face again  
I never meant to hurt nobody  
I know Ill never be the same again  
Now taking back what I have done  
I think of what I have become  
And still  
I never meant to hurt nobody  
Now Im taking what is mine  
  
Letting go of my mistakes  
Build a fire from what Ive learned  
And watch it fade away  
Because I have no heart to break  
I cannot fake it like before  
I thought that I could stay the same  
And now I know that Im not sure  
I even love me anymore  
  
I never meant to hurt nobody  
Nobody ever tore me down like you  
I never meant to hurt no one  
Now Im taking what is mine  
  
Letting go of my mistakes  
Build a fire from what Ive learned  
And watch it fade away  
Because I have no heart to break  
I cannot fake it like before  
I thought that I could stay the same  
And now I know that Im not sure  
I even love me anymore
