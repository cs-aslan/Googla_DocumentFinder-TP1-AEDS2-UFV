I dont need the same excuses  
All this talk is really useless  
You run for cover  
Everytime Im close to you  
  
Dont want to hear about the others  
Theres something here we should discover  
Lets make a little magic  
Before the night is through  
  
Oh youve seen it all before  
And heard the same lines  
But if youre willing to take a chance  
It could be all right so fine  
Well find ourselves dancing by firelight  
  
So dont you try to change the subject  
Or try to put yourself above it  
A boy could get pneumonia sitting next to you  
Thats true  
  
A little sleep is all were losing  
Its up to us to do the choosing  
Lets make a little magic before the night is through  
Make a little magic before the night is through  
  
Ooh to the blue skies  
Where no one can reach us  
It may sound crazy but just hold on tight  
Never has a love run deeper  
Baby my heart is true  
Baby my heart is true  
  
A little sleep is all were losing  
Its up to us to do the choosing  
Lets make a little magic before the night is through
