Shes not just another pretty face in a magazine  
This girl is real  Shes every schoolboys dream  
She fills my fantasies my eyes and my ears  
But every time I try to touch her  She disappears  
Oh oh oh oh oh Shes untouchable  
Oh oh oh oh oh untouchable delight  
Oh oh oh oh oh Shes untouchable  
Oh oh oh oh oh Shes outta sight  
In my mind Im always with her  moans and sighs  
I touch her full red lips  her silken thighs  
We meet in the city she begs please take me home  
But when I wake up in a cold sweat Im all alone
