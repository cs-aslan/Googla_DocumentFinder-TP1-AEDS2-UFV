The End Of The Lyin  
Alabama  
Album Roll On  
You took me for a fool  
Then you took me for a ride  
You really had me going  
Till I looked into your lies  
I let you keep me hangin on  
But honey heres where I get off  
Its the end of the lyin  
And I cant stand no more denyin  
Its all over but the cryin  
Honey its the end of the line  
Dont tell me a story  
I dont care where youve been  
Girl Im out for glory  
And I wont be back again  
I let you keep me hangin on  
But honey heres where I get off  
Its the end of the lyin  
And I cant stand no more denyin  
Its all over but the cryin  
Honey its the end of the line  
Its the end of the lyin  
And I cant stand no more denyin  
Its all over but the cryin  
Honey its the end  
Its the end of the lyin  
And I cant stand no more denyin  
Its all over but the cryin  
Honey its the end of the line
