I must make up my mind today  
What to have what to hold  
A poor mans roses  
Or a rich mans gold  
  
Ones as wealthy as a king in a palace  
Tho hes callous and cold  
He may learn to give his heart for love  
Instead of buyin it with gold  
  
Then the poor mans roses  
And the thrill when we kiss  
Will be memories of paradise  
That Ill never miss  
  
And yet the hand that brings the rose tonight  
Is the hand I will hold  
For the rose of love means more to me  
More than any rich mans gold
