I dont care what anybody thinks of me  
My pride is gone and here I am on bended knees  
I want you and I need you thats all I know  
And Id fight the world before Id ever let go go  
Id gladly beg Id steal Id borrow Id turn my back on everyone I know  
Id do these things with no fear of tomorrow  
Id fight the world before Id ever let go go  
 vibes   
Id gladly beg Id steal Id borrow
