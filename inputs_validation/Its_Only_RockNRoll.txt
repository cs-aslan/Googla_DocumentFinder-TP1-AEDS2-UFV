If I could stick my pen in my heart  
I would spill it all over the stage  
  
Would it satisfy ya would it slide on by ya  
would you think the boy is strange   
Aint he strange  
  
If I could win ya if I could sing ya  
a love song so divine  
  
would it be enough for your cheating heart  
if I broke down and cried   
If I cried  
  
I said I know its only rock n roll but I like it  
I know its only rockn roll but I like it like it yes I do  
  
Oh well I like it I like it I like it  
I said cant you see that this old boy has been a lonely   
  
If I could stick a knife in my heart  
suicide right on stage  
  
would it be enough for your teenage lust  
would it help to ease the pain   
Ease your brain   
  
If I could dig down deep in my heart  
feelings would flood on the page  
  
Would it satisfy ya would it slide on by ya  
would ya think the boys insane   
Hes insane  
  
I said I know its only rock n roll but I like it
