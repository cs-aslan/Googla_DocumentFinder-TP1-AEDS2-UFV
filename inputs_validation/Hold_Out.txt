I know that Im not crazy  
If I were I wouldnt talk about it  
Im homesick for your love  
Cause I know I cant live without it  
  
If you need a guarantee Im gonna love you everyday  
Say no more about it because youve got it in every way  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna hold out one more day  
I wont let her take you away  
Im gonna hold out somehow someway  
I dont want to see the day when you say goodbye  
  
I wish I could get you out of my system  
I say in my mind but my heart wont listen  
I need a fix or two  
Cause Im in the habit of you  
  
And if a guarantee is what you need  
To keep me by your side  
Say no more about it  
Because my love I just cant hide  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna hold out one more day  
I wont let her take you away  
Im gonna hold out somehow someway  
I dont want to see the day when you say  
  
All you need in your life  
All you need in your heart  
All you need from a friend  
Is love  
  
All you need from your mother  
All you need from your lover  
All wee need from another  
Is love  
  
Im gonna hold out one more day  
I wont let her take you away  
Im gonna hold out somehow someway  
I dont want to see the day when you say goodbye  
  
Chorus
