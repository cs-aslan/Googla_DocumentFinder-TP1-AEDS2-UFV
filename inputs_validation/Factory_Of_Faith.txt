All my life I was swinging for the fence  
I was looking for the triple  
Never playing good defense  
  
Gunnin for the glitter  
Every hot and heavy hitter  
She was never really there so I couldnt really get her  
  
I said  
Factually I Im just a piece of it  
Factually I the very least of it  
  
Piece of work I was really quite a jerk  
Keeping score is such a bore a busy mind can go berserk  
Oh feast on this I was fishing for a hook  
So I took a little trip and I opened up the book  
  
I said  
Factually I Im just a piece of it  
Factually I the very least of it  
Factually I is just a medicine  
Make you wanna cry why dont they let us in  
  
Be my wife I think youre right that we should mate  
Tell your friends I got a factory of faith  
Late last night I had a dream that it was great  
Tell your friends I got a factory of faith  
I got a factory of  
  
Crack your whip shes confessing from the hip  
She was good at getting there but not as much for roundtrip  
Oh all this time I was searching for a dream  
I was living in and out of every other sex machine  
  
I said  
Factually I Im just a piece of it  
Factually I the very least of it  
Factually I is just a medicine  
Makes you wanna cry why dont they let us in  
  
Be my wife I think youre right that we should mate  
Tell your friends I got a factory of faith  
Late last night I had a dream that it was great  
Tell your friends I got a factory of faith  
I got a factory of  
  
Be my wife I think youre right that we should mate  
And tell your friends I got a factory of faith  
Late last night I had a dream that it was great  
Tell your friends I got a factory of faith  
I got a factory of  
  
Faith  
And love  
And luhoohuhoohuhoohuhoohove
