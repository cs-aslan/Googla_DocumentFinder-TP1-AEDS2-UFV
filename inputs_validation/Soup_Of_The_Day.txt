Well she thinks shes looking so cool  
She thinks shes great but shes just a fool  
What awful lack of class makes this kind behave this way  
I look and only think of one thing to say  
Soup shes just soup  
Soup of the day  
  
Shes thin around the waistline  
Thin around the brain  
You see this type so many times  
Time and time again  
  
How could they really think  
Theyd be treated in any other way  
Everybodys looking and everybody say  
Soup shes just soup  
Soup of the day  
  
Well youd think theyd know better  
That behaving in this way  
They think theyre being clever  
But I really have to say  
Youd better think it over  
Youll regret it one fine day  
When the circus partys over  
And you were just soup of the day  
Shes just soup  
Soup of the day
