You were in the right  
Until youre left stuck in the middle  
I still wonder why  
You gave it all for such a little  
  
You  
Tell me youre only  
Scared to be lonely  
On and on  
  
You  
Livin on credit  
Want it you get it  
Right or wrong  
  
You oughtta Take A Look In The Mirror  
Every lines gettin clearer  
See the face you cant deny  
You appear to me  
Appear to be lost in confusion  
I dont want to live  
Only to die in your illusion  
  
You  
Dial information  
Station to station  
On and on  
  
You  
Lie to your lover  
Make him your cover  
Blindfold on  
  
You oughtta Take A Look In The Mirror  
Every lines gettin clearer  
See the face you cant deny  
Take A Look In The Mirror  
All your fear gettin nearer  
Nothin left to get you by  
  
Only a matter of time  
Leavin illusion behind  
Tick Tock  
  
You wont realize  
Till all the eyes are truly open  
You cant hide away  
Throw what you may when all is broken  
  
Go on and Take A Look In The Mirror  
All your fear gettin nearer  
Nothin left to get you buy  
  
You oughtta Take A Look In The Mirror  
Every lines gettin clearer  
See the face you cant deny
