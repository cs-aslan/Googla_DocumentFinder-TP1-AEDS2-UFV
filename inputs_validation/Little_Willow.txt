Bend little willow  
Winds gonna blow you  
Hard and cold tonight  
  
Life as it happens  
Nobody warns you  
Willow hold on tight  
  
Nothings gonna shake your love  
Take your love away  
No ones out to break your heart  
It only seems that way hey  
  
Sleep little willow  
Peace gonna follow  
Time will heal your wounds  
  
Grow to the heavens  
Now and forever  
Always came too soon  
  
Little willow  
  
Nothings gonna shake your love  
Take your love away  
No ones out to break your heart  
It only seems that way hey  
  
Bend little willow  
Winds gonna blow you  
Hard and cold tonight  
  
Life as it happens  
Nobody warns you  
Willow hold on tight  
  
Ah little willow  
Little willow
