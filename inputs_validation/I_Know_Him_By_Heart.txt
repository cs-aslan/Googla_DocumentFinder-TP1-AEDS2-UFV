Theres a secret path I follow  
To a place no one can find  
Where I meet my perfect someone  
Ive kept hidden in my mind  
  
Where my heart makes my decisions  
Til my dream becomes a vision  
And the love I feel  
Makes him real someday  
  
Cause I know hes out there somewhere  
Just beyond my reach  
Though Ive never really touched him  
Or ever heard him speak  
  
Though weve never been together  
Weve never been apart  
No weve never met  
Havent found him yet  
But I know him by heart  
  
Am I living an illusion  
Wanting something I cant see  
If I compromise Id be living lies  
Pretending loves not meant to be  
  
Cause I know my hearts worth saving  
And I know that hell be waiting  
So Ill hold on  
Ill stay strong til then  
  
Cause I know hes out there somewhere  
Just beyond my reach  
Though Ive never really touched him  
Or ever heard him speak  
  
Though weve never been together  
Weve never been apart  
No weve never met  
Havent found him yet  
But I know him by heart  
No weve never met  
Havent found him yet  
But I know him by heart
