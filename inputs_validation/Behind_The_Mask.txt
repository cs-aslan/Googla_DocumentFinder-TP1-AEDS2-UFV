All along I had to talk about it  
But like a two edged sword  
He touched you and it stabs  
  
All along I knew you were  
A phony girl  
You sit behind the mask  
And you control your world  
  
You sit around and I watch your face  
I try to find the truth but thats your hiding place  
You say you love me but its hard to see  
Cause when hes in your arms  
Your throwing rocks at me  
Who do you love  
Is it me  
Well I dont know  
Who do you love  
That I want  
If you had  
If you knew me  
  
There is nothing in your eyes  
There is nothing in your eyes  
But thats the way you cry  
But thats the way you cry girl cry girl  
All is grand all is bright  
All is grand all is bright  
Youre just steady in my mind  
  
I walk around Im sufferin  
In my doom  
When I come to you  
Youre sittin in your room  
You sit around in the strangest place  
So take off the mask  
So I can see your face  
Who do you love  
  
Is it me  
Well I dont know  
Who do you love  
That I want ya  
If you had  
I know you  
  
Heaven must be weary  
Heaven must be weary  
Your smile is scary  
You got me scared girl  
Insincere empty tears  
  
You got me scared girl  
  
Heaven must be weary  
Heaven must be weary  
Your smile is scary  
You know ooh babe  
Insincere empty tears  
  
Na na na  
Wheres your soul Where did it go  
  
I walk around Im suffering in my doom  
When I come to you youre sitting in your room  
You sit around in the strangest place  
So take off the mask so I can see your face  
  
Who do you love  
Is it me  
Well I dont know  
Who do you love  
Gotta want ya  
If he had  
I know you  
  
Who do you love  
Is it me  
Well  
I dont know  
Who do you love  
God I want ya  
If he can  
I dont know  
I dont wanna talk about it lets talk about it  
I dont wanna talk about it lets talk about it  
I dont wanna talk about it lets talk about it
