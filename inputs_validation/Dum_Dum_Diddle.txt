I can hear how you work practising hard  
Playing night and day wooh  
And it sounds better now yes you improve  
Everytime you play wooh  
But its bad  
Youre so sad  
And youre only smiling  
When you play your violin  
  
Dumb dumb diddle to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe youd see me baby  
Youd be mine  
And wed be together all the time  
Wish I was dumb dumb diddle your darling fiddle  
  
But I think you dont know that I exist  
Im the quiet kind wooh  
From the day when I first listened to you  
Youve been on my mind wooh  
You dont care  
Its not fair  
And youre only smiling  
When you play your violin  
  
Dumb dumb diddle to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe youd see me baby  
Youd be mine  
And wed be together all the time  
  
Dumb dumb diddle to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe youd see me baby  
Youd be mine  
And wed be together all the time  
Wish I was dumb dumb diddle your darling find
