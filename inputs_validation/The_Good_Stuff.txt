Well me and my lady had our first big fight  
So I drove around till I saw the neon light  
The corner bar It just seemed right so I pulled up  
Not a soul around but the old bar keep  
Down at the end lookin half asleep  
But he walked up and said whatll it be  
I said the good stuff  
He didnt reach around for the whiskey  
He didnt pour me a beer  
His blue eyes kinda went misty  
He said you cant find that here  
  
Chorus  
Cause its the first long kiss on a second date  
Mommas all worried when you get home late  
And droppin the ring in the spaghetti plate  
Cause youre hands are shakin so much  
And its the way that she looks with her eyes and her hair  
Eatin burnt suppers the whole first year  
And askin for seconds to keep her from tearin up  
Yeah man thats the good stuff  
  
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass  
And I smiled and said Ill have some of that  
We sat there and talked as an hour passed like old friends  
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare  
It was a pretty girl with bufont hair  
He said thats my Bonnie taken bout a year after we wed  
He said I spent five years in the bar when the cancer took her from me  
But Ive been sober three years now  
Cause the one things stronger than the whiskey  
  
Was the sight of her holdin my baby girl  
The way she adored that string of pearls  
I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl  
Married his high school love  
And its a new tshirt sayin Im a grandpa  
Bein right there as our time got small  
And holdin her hand when good the Lord called her up  
Yeah man thats the good stuff  
  
He said when you get home shell start to cry  
When she says Im sorry say so am I  
Look into those eyes so deep in love and drink it up  
Cause thats the good stuff  
  
Thats the good stuff
