I stopped at an all night diner  
Oh it seemed like a romantic thing to do  
Yeah but Im lonely it aint like the movies  
In the old days  
I saw you sittin in the corner counting change  
Like you were counting your daydreams  
Then your eyes they suddenly hit me like a railroad train  
  
Oh sometimes I think I might be immune to a guy like you  
But I cant walk away no I cant walk away  
Oh tonight I see youre at the end of the line well me too  
But we all gotta pay  
  
I know youd be good to me  
I know youd try to be good to me  
But in the end baby cant depend on no one else  
When the chips are down I have found  
You better be good to yourself good to yourself  
  
I guess Ive known you before maybe in high school  
or maybe youre just one more guy I went looking for  
The boy next door  
Or maybe Im the girl with the seethrough eyes  
But I watch too many movies  
I get tangled in the story of someone elses life  
Baby who am I and who are you  
  
Oh sometimes I go to bed at night  
And I think that Im with you  
Then I say a little prayer cause I threw it all away  
The other day you called up to see if I miss you  
And all I could say was  
  
I know youd be good to me  
I know youd try to be good to me  
But in the end baby cant depend on no one else  
When the chips are down I have found  
You better be good to yourself good to yourself  
  
Night has a clever disguise  
She makes me believe that Im lonely  
I should know by now if I can make it to tomorrow  
I can work it out  
  
cause in the end baby cant depend on no one else  
When the chips are down I have found  
You better be good to yourself good to yourself
