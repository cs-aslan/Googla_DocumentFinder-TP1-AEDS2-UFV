Verse 1  
Every day Im grindin  
I dont even get a weekend  
Been livin my life  
In black and white no sleeping  
So tonight Im gonna flip it  
Like in a New York minute  
Were gonna hail a cab  
And dont look back  
Once we get in it  
  
PreChorus  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Cant keep it bottled up  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Cant keep it bottled up  
  
Chorus  
Make it pop like pink champagne  
In the purple rain  
We gonna paint paint paint the city  
Were gonna show em how to  
Look all pretty pretty in  
Pink champagne  
Let em know our names  
Scream it so loud  
Theyll hear us in la  
Were poppin like pink champagne  
Poppin like pink champagne  
Poppin like pink champagne  
  
Verse 2  
Dont need no guest list  
Everybodys invited  
I said even if you cant get in  
Well dance outside it  
Were gonna make this bubble  
Carbonate some trouble  
When the night gets black  
Gotta take it back to another level  
  
Lemme hear you say  
  
PreChorus  
Ooooh  
Cant keep it bottled up  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Cant keep it bottled up

Make it pop like pink champagne  
In the purple rain  
We gonna paint paint paint the city  
Were gonna show em how to  
Look all pretty pretty in  
Pink champagne  
Let em know our names  
Scream it so loud  
Theyll hear us in la  
Were poppin like pink champagne  
Poppin like pink champagne  
Poppin like pink champagne
