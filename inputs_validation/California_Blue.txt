Working all day  
And the sun dont shine  
Trying to get by  
And Im just killin time  
I feel the rain  
Fall the whole night through  
Far away from you  
California blue  
  
California blue  
Dreaming all alone  
Nothing else to do  
California blue  
Everyday I pray  
Ill be on my way  
Saving love for you  
California blue  
  
One sunny day  
Ill get back again  
Somehow someway  
But I dont know when  
California blue  
California blue  
  
Living my life  
With you on my mind  
Thinking of things  
That I left far behind  
Its been so long  
Doing all I can do  
To get back to you  
California blue  
  
California blue  
Dreaming all alone  
Nothing else to do  
California blue  
Everyday I pray  
Ill be on my way  
Saving love for you  
California blue  
  
One sunny day  
Ill get back again  
Somehow someway  
But I dont know when  
California blue  
California blue  
Still missing you  
California blue  
Still missing you  
California blue  
Still missing you  
California blue
