Brothers and sisters unite  
Its the time of your lives its the time of your lives  
Break down break down  
Got to spread love around got to spread it around  
  
Brothers and sisters feel fine  
Its the time of your lives its the time of your lives  
Theres no sound no sound  
Like this feeling you found like this feeling you found  
  
But just stay down  
Cause sometimes you feel  
So stay down  
And sometimes you feel  
And its me theyre lookin for  
And its me I will never survive  
But well be around some more
