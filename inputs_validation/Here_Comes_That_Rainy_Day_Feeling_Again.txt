Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
Writers roger cook roger greenaway  
  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
And soon my tears they will be falling like rain  
It always seems to be a Monday  
Left over memories of Sunday  
Always spent with you before the clouds appear  
And took away my sunshine  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
And Ill be dreaming of you baby in vain  
Your face is always on my mind girl  
I hope that soon youre gonna find girl  
Your way back to me  
Cause if you say youll stay the rainy days would go away  
Misty morning eyes Im trying to disguise the way I feel  
But I just cant hide it  
People seem to know  
The loneliness will show  
Im thinking of my pride but breaking up inside girl Whoaaa  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
And soon my tears they will be falling like rain  
It always seems to be a Monday  
Left over memories of Sunday  
Always spent with you before the clouds appear  
And took away my sunshine  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again  
Here comes that rainy day feeling again
