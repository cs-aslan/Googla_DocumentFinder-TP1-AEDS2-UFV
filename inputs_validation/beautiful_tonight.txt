Well I thought Id seen it all  
From beginning to the end  
Yeah I was the great pretender  
Always alone again  
  
Well a light came shining in  
When you took my breath away  
Now I know Ive waited all my life  
To do what I feel today  
  
So tell me Im dreaming  
Oh whoa  
cause I cant hold back these tears I cry  
And you never looked more beautiful tonight  
Oh whoa  
So if Im dreaming  
Oh whoa  
Dont wake me up Im so alive  
Wish you could see what I see  
Through these eyes of mine  
  
Now were standing face to face  
I can hear the words were saying  
This is now and will be forever  
In this moment we could stay  
  
So tell me Im dreaming  
Oh whoa  
cause I cant hold back these tears I cry  
And you never looked more beautiful tonight  
Oh whoa  
So if Im dreaming  
Oh whoa  
  
Dont wake me up Im so alive  
Wish you could see what I see  
Through these eyes of mine  
  
Whoa whoa oh  
  
So dont wake me up  
Dont let me down  
My heart beats for love  
And love lifts me higher  
Right into the clouds  
Im flying so high  
With tears in my eyes  
And I have never ever felt this alive  
  
So tell me Im dreaming  
Oh whoa  
cause I cant hold back these tears I cry  
And you never looked more beautiful tonight  
Oh whoa  
So if Im dreaming  
Oh whoa  
Dont wake me up Im so alive  
Wish you could see what I see  
Through these eyes of mine  
  
So dont wake me up  
Dont let me down  
My heart beats for love  
And love lifts me higher  
Right into the clouds  
Im flying so high  
With tears in my eyes  
And I have never ever felt so alive
