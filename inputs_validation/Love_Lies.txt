Whenever I touch you lately you seem to pull away  
Okay maybe Im trying too hard to hang on  
But whenever I hold you you never look into my eyes surprised  
I guess I was fooling myself all along  
Love lies cause it doesnt last forever  
Love lies it makes you feel so clever  
You give and it just takes  
And leaves your heart to ache love lies  
Whenever I kiss you you never want to lose control so cold  
Its taken so long to find out  
But now I see that we cant even talk now  
How your love always turned me on  
Theyre gone this isnt how I thought love is gonna be  
Love lies cause it doesnt last forever  
Love lies though it makes you feel so clever  
You can give and it just takes  
And leaves your heart to ache love lies  
Love lies love lies  
Love lies love lies
