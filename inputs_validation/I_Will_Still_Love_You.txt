Time may take us apart but I will still love you I promise  
And when the stars stars are falling  
Ill keep calling  
I promise that youll be my one my only everything  
  
Ill never be untrue  
And I promise that for all your love I will do anything  
I will give you the stars I will buy you the moon  
Even through the longest of our nights  
  
And even through the darkest days  
Our love will find a way  
  
Chorus  
And when the stars are falling  
Ill keep calling  
I will still love you  
And when your dreams are fading  
Ill be waiting  
I will still love you  
  
You were my summer breeze my winter sun my  
Springtime soul springtime soul my autumn touch of gold Yeah  
And you were my sky my rain the earth in which my love goes strong  
The smile of my heart and the breath of my soul  
  
Even if we find ourselves apart  
We will hold our hopes and dreams  
Forever in our hearts  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell me how you feel  
I finally know how love feels  
Tell me if its real  
And my heart tells me its real  
So real So real  
  
Chorus  
  
Time may take us apart thats true  
But I will always be there for you  
Youre in my heart youll be in my dreams  
No matter how many miles weve seen  
  
I promise you that I wont forget  
The day we kissed or the day we met  
The sky may fall and the stars may tilt  
But I will still I will still Love you  
  
Chorus
