Heres the house Heres the city and the stream Heres the father to my
dream Heres the lost and lonely look in your eyes When you leave I will
break down and cry  
  
Sleeping single  I will wait for you Im sleeping single  til you change
your mind Sleeping single  I will wait for you til time has gone by  
  
Ill pay the price for all the love you poured like rain toujours lamour
over again but the midnight chills are getting so rough and the bed is big
enough for both of us  
  
Sleeping single  I would die for you Im sleeping single  wont you change
your way Sleeping single  I will pray for you to stay heheheyhehe
hey
