Dre  
Remember back in the time  
When the only sign we had was pickets  
But now in 94 it be this way somethin come wicked  
Gangs killin others fo colors  
Thangs that we wear fo fashion  
Other brothers take it fo what reason To be blastin  
What da kcuf is goin on  
Not soft like buttercups but  
Had enough of singin that same song  
See I stayed across the street from the projects  
Took out yo momma trash and groceries to her trunk  
To keep my pockets fat like cellulite  
Only been to jail one week fo some shullbit  
And I pray to God I wont repeat  
I shoulda pulled it when I had the chance to  
No I shouldnt a did that cuz if I did that  
Yall would not hear that phat shit  
That keeps you on yo tippytoes  
Like that fella not callin no names  
But really whos bad  
I go through obstacles like a whole box of condoms  
You cant forget what you come from  
  
TBoz  
Take a good look in the mirror  
And tell me do you like what you see  
Masters of deception corruption and evil  
But youre always quick to point the finger at me  
Wont somebody tell me  
  
1  I just dont understand  
The ways of the world today  
Sometimes I feel  
Like theres nothing to live for  
So Im longing for the days of yesterday  
  
TBoz  
What gave you the right to misjudge me  
And write me off on the wall  
Acting as if you understand me  
In reality you just dont know me at all  
  
Chilli  
Sometimes I cant help but wonder  
If this was how its meant to be  
But if you search deep enough in your soul  
Youll always find a slight reminder of me  
Wont somebody tell me  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Left Eye  
Ayo if we could all agree  
To lettin our souls become free  
Of that sweet bitterness  
Then whos chest would have the most seeds  
I keep misfocusin my needs  
And distress on my back with them cats  
They be blastin into my knapsack  
Aint no accidental deathtraps  
My mishap is the fact that Im destined to snap  
Its when I feel as though my bodys able to go  
My mind is ready to flow didnt you know  
First you catch and then I throw  
Its my own sense of time  
If Im late its cuz Im endin my day  
Just when the sun shines  
And still gently advising the arisin of the moon  
As it rolls around into my soundproof dimension  
  
Repeat 1
