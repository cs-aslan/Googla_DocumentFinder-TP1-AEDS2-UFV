Sometimes you win sometimes you lose  
Aint turnin back for me and you  
Dont look over your shoulder  
No time for regrets  
You got your demons I got mine  
Our paths have crossed at a crucial time  
Suddenly were older  
Scared of whats ahead  
We were looking for the answers in all the wrong places  
But now the chance is knocking on our door  
To grab hold of what we been readin for  
Its just a motion away  
Its just a motion away  
Its just a motion away  
No need to wonder where the future lies  
Its right before our very eyes  
Dont even think it over  
Just say yes  
We were clinging to some old cliches and old familar faces  
But now theyre only shattered dreams  
So lets dry our eyes and start away clean  
Its just a motion away  
Its just a motion away  
Its just a motion away  
We were lookin for the answers in all the wrong places  
But now the chance is knocking on our door  
To open up our aliing hearts once more  
Its just a motion away  
Its just a motion away  
Its just a motion away
