Anita come closer  
Stop crying and listen to me  
I guess its too late now  
But somehow I must make you see  
What we thought was our world  
Was only a dream world  
And we just cant go on like this  
Anita youre dreaming  
Of a world that can never exist  
  
Anita its over  
Theres nothing thats left now to say  
Anita youre dreaming  
And I know its better this way  
  
Anita come closer  
And close your pretty blue eyes  
Your young dreams just cant be  
And somehow you must realize  
And each time youre with me  
My conscience reminds me  
Of someone whos waiting alone  
Anita youre dreaming  
And when you awake Ill be gone  
  
Anita its over  
Theres nothing thats left now to say  
Anita youre dreaming  
And I know its better this way
