You change your mind  
Like a girl changes clothes  
Yeah you PMS  
Like a bitch  
I would know  
  
And you over think  
Always speak  
Cryptically  
  
I should know  
That youre no good for me  
  
Cause youre hot then youre cold  
Youre yes then youre no  
Youre in then youre out  
Youre up then youre down  
Youre wrong when its right  
Its black and its white  
We fight we break up  
We kiss we make up  
You You dont really want to stay no  
You But you dont really want to goo  
Youre hot then youre cold  
Youre yes then youre no  
Youre in then youre out  
Youre up then youre down  
  
We used to be  
Just like twins  
So in sync  
The same energy  
Nows a dead battery  
Used to laugh bout nothing  
Now youre plain boring  
  
I should know that  
Youre not gonna change  
  
Cause youre hot then youre cold  
Youre yes then youre no  
Youre in then youre out  
Youre up then youre down  
Youre wrong when its right  
Its black and its white  
We fight we break up  
We kiss we make up  
You You dont really want to stay no  
You But you dont really want to goo  
Youre hot then youre cold  
Youre yes then youre no  
Youre in then youre out  
Youre up then youre down  
  
Someone call the doctor  
Got a case of a love bipolar  
Stuck on a roller coaster  
Cant get off this ride  
  
You change your mind  
Like a girl changes clothes  
  
Cause youre hot then youre cold  
Youre yes then youre no  
Youre in then youre out  
Youre up then youre down  
Youre wrong when its right  
Its black and its white  
We fight we break up  
We kiss we make up  
Youre hot then youre cold  
Youre yes then youre no  
Youre in then youre out  
Youre up then youre down  
Youre wrong when its right  
Its black and its white  
We fight we break up  
We kiss we make up  
You You dont really want to stay no  
You But you dont really want to goo  
Youre hot then youre cold  
Youre yes then youre no  
Youre in then youre out  
Youre up then youre down down
