So you wanna go back to Egypt  
Where its warm and secure  
Are sorry you bought the one way ticket  
When you thought you were sure  
You wanted to live in the land of promise  
But now its getting so hard  
Are you sorry youre out here in the desert  
Instead of your own back yard  
  
Eating leaks and onions by the Nile  
Ooh what breath for dining out in style  
Ooh my lifes on the skids  
Building the pyramids  
  
Well theres nothing do but travel  
And we sure travel a lot  
Cause its hard to keep your feet from moving  
When the sand gets so hot  
And in the morning its manna hotcakes  
We snack on manna all day  
And we sure had a winner last night for dinner  
Flaming manna souffle  
  
Well we once complained for something new to munch  
The ground opened up and had some of us for lunch  
Ooh such fire and smoke  
Cant God even take a joke Huh NO  
  
So you wanna to back to Egypt  
Where your friends wait for you  
You can throw a big party and tell the whole gang  
Of what they said was all true  
And this Moses acts like a big shot  
Who does he think he is  
Well its true that God works lots of miracles  
But Moses thinks theyre all his  
  
Oh were having so much trouble even now  
Whyd he get so mad about that ccccow that golded calf  
Moses seems rather idle  
He just sits around he just sits around and writes the Bible  
  
Oh Moses put down your pen  
What Oh no manna again  
  
Oh manna waffles  
Manna burgers  
Manna bagels  
Fillet of manna  
Manna patty  
BaManna bread
