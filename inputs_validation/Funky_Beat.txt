Check uh huh  
Check check yall  
  
Yo Whitey Fords the name  
The Hunchback of Notre Dame  
Couldnt get more bent when its time to represent  
I control it like rent in a slum tenement  
Lifes hard like some men in the concrete jungle  
I dont smoke jumbo so what you knocking for  
Theres locks on my door we rock from the floor  
To the ceiling aint no drug dealing  
Aint no gat peeling you cant fight this feeling  
  
Well My styles golden hot like molten rock  
Niggers come bold but leave here holding jock  
High roll patrol roll through the set on fifth  
Arms solo sipping molo with a chick  
Niggers take the penitentiary chances at the dances  
Letting off shots lit off the lanterns  
Mad cause a nigga cant test with no access  
To phatness like this  
  
From one story the cowboy was founded  
Im surrounded by Casual and Whitey Ford the whole world and your girl  
  
From the Bay to LA to my blue end while  
I aint trying to die Im trying to live while I cool out  
And pick up my daughter when the bell says the school out  
Who the hell brought tools in this peaceful event  
Now I can love you front you or we could hunt you  
You played too close take a hit of this dose  
  
A yes yes yall  
A freak freak yo  
So fresh yall  
  
A to the beat yall  
A yes yes yall  
We dont stop dog  
Everlast We keep it rocking till the panties drop yo  
  
Uhhuh ha I see the rappers being ruined by you and whoever is doing that
Crap  
They got me booin in fact Im gettin to em  
May a electrical poetical surge give me the urge  
To consume the tomb and submerge  
The depths of adverbs   
Analytical you pitiful trick  
Im the pinnacle and the prodigal rhyme styles  
Hip nautical fuck the article the artist is hardest to harvest the  
Hard shit  
  
I slave till all my work is done  
Im cashing in stack up my money for a grand set  
I like them all house parties rocking plus Im up in your   
Bitch turn your head and keep your eyes where they supposed to be  
  
Supposedly I was seen with something lean huh  
Brown skin I keep it bouncing  
I say lounging on the side with red wine  
I know that shit on my floor aint swine  
  
Now back it up stack it up and hit me one more time  
It might be your phone call but check it its my dime  
And I know shes fine but get off my line  
Or Ill break that spine and then maybe your face  
  
You all up in my space like with Puffy and Mase  
But thats just not the case cause Im setting the pace  
While you following and swallowing savoring the flavor  
In your 40 open now quick suckin my style  
  
Chorus  
Rock on to the break of dawn  
Just freak it ah yeah baby  
Rock on to the break of dawn  
Just freak it ah yeah baby  
  
Repeat x2  
Cause its the funky beat  
Cause its the funky beat  
Cause its the funk the funk the funk funky beat beat  
  
Ill leave a piece of my style flying high up in the air  
And youll say to yourself damn Im glad I was there  
This is as rare as me fricking share  
You people stare  
But behind closed doors you will take it there  
  
Yeah I be the extraordinary  
Judge from Bay fare to Albee Square  
Tell me where the party at Ill be there  
Let her hit the coney at show her where to rock the pony at  
  
I be the man with the large amounts of sapphire fare  
Im about to cut loose my dog so you all best beware  
You can dance with flare and get out of your chair  
We be smarter than your average boo boo bear  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x4  
Cause its the funky beat  
Cause its the funky beat  
Cause its the funk the funk the funk funky beat beat
