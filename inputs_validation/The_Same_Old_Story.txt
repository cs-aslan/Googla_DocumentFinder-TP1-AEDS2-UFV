Hey there lonely girl can I sit with you  
Ive just got to find someone to tell my story to  
Youve heard it all before now here it is once more  
And please kiss away my tears when I am through  
Its just the same old story once again with a sweet beginning and a bitter
end  
A love affair that didnt turn out right  
And the world has one more broken heart tonight  
Would you like to dance oh you know its been a long time  
Since I had a woman satisfy my urge  
But you know it never works a false love wont take away hurt  
But just pretend Im him and Ill pretend youre her  
And itll be just the same old story  
  
And the world had one more broken heart tonight
