I could jump on some ol highway  
Run a thousand miles or more  
Unlock some hidden mystery  
Behind a distant door  
I could sail the seven oceans  
Til I crawl upon some long forgotten shore  
  
But its always gonna be you  
Always gonna be you Im lookin for  
  
I could climb a hundred mountains  
Leave a hard ol world behind  
Wander right across some prairie  
Like a man out of his mind  
I could walk and stare into the sun  
Let it all just burn me deaf and blind  
But its always gonna be you  
Always gonna be you Im tryin to find  
  
Where does a man go for redemption  
Where does he take a broken heart  
Shouldnt there be some small exemption  
If he does all that it takes  
To admit to his mistakes  
Til the truth batters and breaks his world apart  
  
I could ask for my forgiveness  
From the heavens high above  
Tell myself my prayers are gonna somehow be enough  
And lay down in some angels bed  
Convinced Ive found the one Im dreamin of  
But its always gonna be you  
Always gonna be you that I love  
  
Where does a man seek his salvation  
When does his mind finally go free  
Is the pain he feels the only explanation  
For believing lies are true  
For the stone inside his shoe  
The endless ways that you keep haunting me  
  
I could find an empty church  
Get down on my knees  
Tell myself the mercy  
Is a matter of degrees  
Then lay down in some angels arms  
Convinced Ive found the one Im dreamin of  
But its always gonna be you  
Always gonna be you that I love  
  
Always gonna be you that I love  
That I love
