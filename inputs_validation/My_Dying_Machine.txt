Why give orders  
Why give speeches  
  
No more questions  
No more answers  
All thats left is the fear  
  
I can feel theyre here  
I can feel the cold  
I cant fight for long  
This machine runs down  
  
If I had a picture  
I could say its all for you  
  
Why give orders  
And why make speeches  
Give me a reason to stay  
  
This dying machine  
I can hear me scream  
Ive nowhere to run  
Ive nowhere to hide  
  
I can only wonder  
I can only wonder why  
  
Why give orders  
And why make speeches  
Give me a reason to die  
  
This shape comes apart  
Everything breaks down  
And me Im trapped inside  
And here inside it ends  
  
Theres nothing I can do  
Theres nothing I can do now  
If I had a picture  
I could say its all for you  
I can only wonder  
I can only wonder why
