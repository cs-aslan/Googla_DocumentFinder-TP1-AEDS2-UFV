Black hearted woman  
Cant you see your poor mans down  
I cant take this baby  
All the lonely nights Ive been cryin  
Tired of all your separate ways  
I cant take your evil lyin  
Black hearted woman  
Trouble and pain is all you crave  
Black hearted woman  
Trouble and pain is all you crave  
Now that Im gone my troubles stopped  
But my truth got in my way I dont know  
Yesterday I was your man  
But now you dont even know my name  
Yesterday I was your man  
Now you dont even know my name  
Got to find a new way girl  
Before I get back in your game  
One of these days baby  
Im gonna catch you with your backdoor man  
I said one of these days woman  
You know Ill catch you with your backdoor man  
Keep on down the road girl  
Or Ill start all over again  
Oh no no no no no  
Incomprehensible
