Wrote a letter to the MTV  
Whats goin on now  
Dont ya care about me  
Sent the same letter to the radio  
But my party went dead  
Like a shot in the head  
We all like itRock and Roll  
We all want itOn your show  
Play it louddont play it low  
Blow your speakers with Rock and Roll  
  
We got lots of stations  
Around the nation  
And the stuff theyre playing  
It just aint worth my sayin  
People want music to getem movin  
We dont want labels  
We want music on the table  
  
We all like itRock and Roll  
We all want iton your show  
Play it louddont play it low  
Blow your speakers with Rock and Roll
