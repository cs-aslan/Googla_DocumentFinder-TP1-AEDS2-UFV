Twentyone years and you answer the call  
Hollywood screams from your bedroom wall  
You cant get away from the thrill of it all  
  
Chorus  
Byebye baby  
Get me out of here Im done  
A girl gone crazy  
You aint foolin anyone  
  
You cant sing cant dance  
Cant fit in your pants  
Youre a bad actress  
You cant run cant walk gotta learn how to talk  
Youre a bad actress  
  
Come on down and walk the moonlit mile  
Youve got the perfect teeth  
Youve got the perfect smile  
You do it all wrong but you do it in style  
Oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
You cant sing cant dance  
Cant fit in your pants  
Youre a bad actress  
You cant run cant walk gotta learn how to talk  
Youre a bad actress  
  
You cant read cant write gotta learn how to fight  
Youre a bad actress  
Youre too cold too old and the storys been told bout

Chorus  
  
You cant sing cant dance  
Cant fit in your pants
