Seven days a week  
Evry week of the month  
And evry month of the year  
Hes got us making presents  
And Im happy  
  
Evry girl and boy  
Gets their own kind of toy  
We like to fill em with joy  
Were workin over time  
To make em happy  
  
Then on Christmas eve  
We jump on big reds sleigh  
We dont miss a chimney  
On our jolly way  
  
We wont stop until  
Every kid gets a fill  
Of Santas brand of good will  
The thrill of spilling cheer  
Just makes us happy  
  
So if youve been good yourself  
You might see the happy elf  
Stop by your house and make  
You very happy  
  
The happy elf  
Im the happy elf  
Im the happy elf and I just might stop on by  
The happy elf  
Im the happy elf  
Im the happy elf and I just might stop on by  
Im Santas spy
