My heads in a jam  
Cant take you off my mind  
From the time we met  
Ive been beset by thoughts of you  
And the more that I ignore this feeling  
The more I find myself believing  
That I just have to see you again  
I cant let you pass me by  
I just cant let you go  
But I know that I am much too shy  
To let you know  
Afraid that I might say the wrong words  
And displease you  
Afraid for love to fade  
Before it can come true  
Like a child again  
Im at a loss for words  
How does one define  
A crush combined with longing  
Longing to possess you oh so dearly  
Im obsessed by you completely  
Ill go mad if I cant have you  
I cant let you pass me by  
I just cant let you go  
But I know that I am much too shy  
To let you know  
Afraid that I might say the wrong words  
And displease you  
Afraid for love to fade  
Before it can come true  
instrumental  
I cant let you pass me by  
I just cant let you go  
Let me say the things and say the words  
To let you know  
I would rather say the awkward words  
Than lose you  
Or for love to fade  
Before it can come true
