You fell away  
What more can I say  
The feelings evolved  
I wont let it out  
I cant replace  
Your screaming face  
Feeling the sickness inside  
  
Why wont you die  
Your blood in mine  
Well be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
  
So many words  
Cant discribe my face  
This feelings evolved  
So soon to break out  
I cant relate  
To a happy state  
Feeling the blood run inside  
  
Why wont you die  
Your blood in mine  
Well be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me  
Keep me down to what you think I should be  
Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry  
Keep on trying Im not dying so easily  
I will not die  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me I will not die  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me I will not die  
  
Why wont you die  
Your blood in mine  
Well be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
  
Why would you die  
Your blood in mine  
Well be fine  
Then your body will be mine
