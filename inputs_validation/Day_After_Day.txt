Way up in the sky  
Over the city over Tokyo  
Silver light summer moon  
Youll be over somebodys winter this afternoon  
While the dolphins swim in the sea  
Youre going grey my baby  
Still the war is waging endlessly  
Day after day day after day  
  
Way up in the sky  
Over the city and lake Erie  
You remember the flats you were there  
Out every night Mr Moonlight  
  
Round and round and round we go  
Just like yesterday  
  
Way up in the sky  
Over the city where you sleep tonight  
The light outside your window blinks  
Hotel hotel hotel  
Open the blind and dream in a moonbeam  
  
When the wars finally over  
Well meet again  
And pick up where we left off
