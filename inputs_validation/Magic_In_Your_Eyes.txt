Say there is magic in his mind  
Reflecting in his eyes  
Its that mystery draws me to you  
This kind of voodoos hard to find  
  
I detect a little gypsy in his smile  
I think Ill stay for awhile  
I need some lovin its my turn and  
I got a little fire left to burn  
  
Oh if he would just remain  
Id show him how I could love him  
Or I get the feeling that he knows me  
From some other time before  
Wonder how he could forget me  
Cant explain why Im comin back for more
