Giving up on love  
Giving up on love  
  
I was so crazy about you everyone knew  
I couldnt sleep when I found out yeah  
You feel the way you do  
So maybe its my turn now  
to show you how I feel  
  
So listen to what I say  
Cause these feelings I cant conceal  
  
Im giving up on love  
Cause Ive been hurt before  
Giving up on love  
And I dont want you no more  
Giving up on love  
Cause Ive been hurt before  
Giving up on love  
And I dont want you no more  
  
I dont believe that you need me  
So dont say you do  
There aint no reason for staying  
We both know were through  
  
So dont try and stop me now  
Cause all we had has gone  
All we had has gone  
So listen to what I say  
Cause these feelings are oh so strong  
  
Im giving up on love  
Cause Ive been hurt before  
Giving up on love  
And I dont want you no more  
Giving up on love  
Cause Ive been hurt before  
Giving up on love  
And I dont want you no more  
  
Giving up giving up giving up on love  
Giving up giving up giving up on love  
Giving up giving up giving up on love  
Giving up giving up giving up on love  
  
So dont try and stop me now  
Cause all we had has gone  
All we had has gone  
So listen to what I say  
Cause these feelings are oh so strong
