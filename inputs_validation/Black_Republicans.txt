Now this is what theyve been waiting for

Oh Im ready to brush my shoulders off and drop my next album too nigga  
Thats what it is  
But dig this they wanna know what we been workin on together  
Thats that I Cant Feel My Face Shit they know what

Guess what we already did  
  
Juelz Santana  
Im feelin like a black Republican  
Naw I cant call it  
More like a black Democrat runnin em out of office  
Young Barack Obama Im all for it  
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen on ya  
I protect my land like a farmer  
Pockets stay chubby like Tikara  
Or should I say fat like the Parkers  
Tote big guns like Im still playin Contra  
Yall washed up like money thats laundered  
Yall funny Im bonkers  
Honest girls strapped to my dick like a harness  
Rock star flier than an ostrich  
And I cover east west north south like a compass  
I shall shine forever never tarnish  
Money buried behind my house like a garden  
All green my bank accounts like a forest  
I Cant Feel My Face is gettin started  
And Weezy is my accomplice ya dig  
A black activist like Sonny Carson  
Stripes of a sergeant salute me  
And chicks I get em high  
Higher than turbulence is  
White Phantom lookin so Fergielicious  
Im from the city of big drugs and murder victims  
Its get rich go to jail and be a murder victim  
Ai  
Now all yall listen  
If you cant take the heat get out the kitchen  
  
Lil Wayne  
I feel like a black Republican  
Tote a mac in the public and  
Act so southern n die for my brethren  
Money money money  
Like money Mac and publishing  
One life to live never ask for a mulligan  
Streets cold but the heat make me feel covered in em  
Been done had cake day late like Ed Sullivan  
Fly like an eagle but no Im no Donovan  
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n them  
And my mind is on another continent  
I am real Cash Money no counterfeit  
I dont parkin lot pimp I just politick  
Bet I get all in her mouth like polident  
New Orleans representa to the inner  
Come from the city where the glitter dont glimmer  
The sun dont shine and the guns dont sleep  
Wake a niggas ass up like he got somewhere to be  
  
Santana  
  
Im feelin like a black republican drug money comin in  
Im a volcano filled with lava bout to erupt again  
I stay with the iron dont make me plug it in  
Stay outta rich kids business dont be buttin in  
I stay with a chick thats ready to unbutton it  
Forget her tongue she put her lung on it ha  
My listerine comes out she start guzzerin  
Im above you dudes Im hoverin  
Juelz why you duckin them duckin who  
Im in the hood like what it do comfortable  
And believe me its nothin to  
Send my london boys to english muffin you  
You poodles barkin too much they bringin muzzles through  
You aint gully you gullible  
Man they need love they need hugs  
They need church Jesus  
This is jus a sample yea a free drug  
The shipment is in we done red up  
But I dont trust dudes like a prenup  
They cockaroaches they gotta be bug  
Maybe cause they them  
And we us and we up

I have the chaufeur hold the umbrella over my head when its not rainin
