Save it save it  
Save it all for me  
  
Save it save it  
Youve gotta save it all for me  
  
Gonna take my heart and my soul  
And lay it onto someones daughter  
Gonna give out all that I got  
To the woman who sits by the water  
  
Gonna spend the rest of my time  
With the woman by the winding river  
Gonna let her know  
That Ill give her all  
That I got forever and ever  
  
She knows what I like  
She knows what I need  
And babe let me tell you  
Shell give it all to me
