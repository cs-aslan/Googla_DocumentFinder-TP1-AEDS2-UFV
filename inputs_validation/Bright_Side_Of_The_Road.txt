From the dark end of the street  
To the bright side of the road  
Well be lovers once again on the  
Bright side of the road  
  
Little darlin come with me  
Wont you help me share my load  
From the dark end of the street  
To the bright side of the road  
  
Into this life were born  
Baby sometimes bay sometimes we dont know why  
And time seems to go by so fast  
In the twinkling of an eye  
  
Lets enjoy it while we can  
Wont you help me sing my song  
From the dark end of the street  
To the bright side of the road  
  
From the dark end of the street  
To the bright side of the road  
Well be lovers once again  
On the bright side of the road  
Well be lovers once again  
On the bright side of the road  
Well be lovers once again  
On the bright side of the road
