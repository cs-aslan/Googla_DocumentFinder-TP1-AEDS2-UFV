With her hand in his hand  
They were both happy again  
You started to take sides  
They started arguing  
He said it was her fault  
She said it wasnt at all  
But the truth lies somewhere in the middle  
  
Where angels fear to tread you go rushing in  
Well I had to tell you then  
And now Im telling you again  
Stay out of this  
You must not interfere  
Dont you see this is  
Between a man and a woman  
  
Every day and night I pray  
Pray that you will stay away forever  
Its so hard for love to stay together  
With the modern Western pressures  
I dont want to say it  
But I had to tell you then  
And now Im telling you again  
  
Stay out of this  
Oh I know you mean to help me  
And I know youve good intentions  
But stay out of this  
This isnt your problem  
Do not interfere  you are not needed here  
Let the pendulum swing  
Between a man and a woman  
Dont you see youre in the way  between a man and a woman  
Every day and night I pray let the pendulum swing  
Between a man and a woman  
Between a man and a woman
