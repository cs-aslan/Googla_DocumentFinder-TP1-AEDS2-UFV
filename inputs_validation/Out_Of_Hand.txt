Shiny silver faces coloured paper falling into their hand  
Never to be seen again it must have been a one night stand  
Up until the dawn I could have sworn that everything was alright  
Thieving bastards stole my life and legged it off into the night  
Its a dirty business its a dirty game  
Everybody different but theyre all the same  
They draw you in you hear a siren call  
Build you up so they can see you fall  
Youve seen it all before  
Been there since time began  
You know whats coming next  
Everything gets out of hand  
Theyve got the lot and god knows what they think that the deserve even more  
Psychopathic tendencies theyve got a lot of answer for  
Scratch my back and Ill stab Yours no wonder its a universal sickness  
Who are they you well might ask come with me and you can be my whitness  
Its a dirty business its a crying shame  
You blink your eye and all the laws have changed  
They draw you in you hear a siren call  
Build you up so they can see you fall  
Youve seen it all before  
Been there since time began  
You know whats coming next  
Everything gets out of hand  
Its a dirty business its crying shame  
You blink your eye and all the laws have changed  
They say the vulture is a bird of prey  
Noone told me it would come this way  
You seen it all before  
Been there since time began  
You know whats coming next  
Everything everything gets out of hand
