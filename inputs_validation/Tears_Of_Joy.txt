Im just a fool who really loves you  
There is no greater fool than me  
You told me lies and I believed you  
How big a fool can you be  
  
I close my eyes when people tell me  
They saw you kissin someone new  
I just wont let my heart believe it  
Im just a fool in love with you  
  
Some day you may be crying  
Crying over me  
And if that ever happens  
A fool you too may be  
  
Why dont you change your way of livin  
And walk the straight and never lie  
The Lord forgives a fool whos willin  
Ill give the world to make you mine  
  
Some day you may be crying  
Crying over me  
And if that ever happens  
A fool you too you too may be  
  
Why dont you change your way of livin  
And walk the straight and never lie  
The Lord forgives a fool whos willin  
Ill give the world to make you mine
