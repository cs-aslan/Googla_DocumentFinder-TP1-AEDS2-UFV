In everything I see you appear with me how come How come  
And everything I do involves you too We are like one  
In my life there has been so many changes  
And I dont want to be left out in the rain  
  
I dont want to get hurt Ive done my time  
All I want from you is to tell the truth  
I dont want to get hurt no more this time  
I dont want to go blind and find its falling apart all the time  
  
In the middle of a dream you are there for me your face your lips  
But theres no way you can tell cause I hide it really well so well  
In my life there has been loving and lying  
And I dont need another reason to cry  
  
I dont want to get hurt  
I dont want to go blind and find Im falling apart one more time
