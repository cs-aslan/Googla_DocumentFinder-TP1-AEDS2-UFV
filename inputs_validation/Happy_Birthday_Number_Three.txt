Happy birthday number three  
Todays the day weve waited for  
Because youre not a baby anymore  
Youve grown into the prettiest toddler well ever see  
Happy birthday number three  
What happened to that funny face  
Our little angel now wears full ups and lace  
We cant believe our eyes youre such a parents dream  
Happy birthday number three  
When you were only one you couldnt hold a bottle  
Then at eighteen months you began to waddle  
When you were two years you could barely say a word  
But since youve grown up your future is sewn up  
From now on youre gonna be heard so  
If we should smile with sweet surprise  
Its just that youve grown up before our very eyes  
Youve grown into the prettiest toddler well ever see
