You are amazing  
Its the truth  
And its often fading  
Without you  
  
I dont feel the wind blow  
I dont feel the hard rock  
I dont feel it when it breaks your heart  
I dont feel it all get  
To far from the start  
  
You are a lady  
Its the truth  
And its often shady  
Behind you  
  
I dont feel the hollow  
I dont feel it all broke  
I dont need it when you make your mark  
I dont live in malice  
I need a morning heart  
  
Standing here and hollow  
Its the only thing broke  
And it shakes you and it makes you start  
Like a singing widow  
Which wont mend your heart  
  
You are amazing  
Its the truth
