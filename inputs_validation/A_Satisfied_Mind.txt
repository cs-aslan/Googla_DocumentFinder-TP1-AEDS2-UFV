How many times have  
You heard someone say  
If I had his money  
I could do things my way  
  
But little they know  
That its so hard to find  
One rich man in ten  
With a satisfied mind  
  
Once I was waitin  
In fortune and fame  
Everything that I dreamed for  
To get a start in lifes game  
  
Then suddenly it happened  
I lost every dime  
But Im richer by far  
With a satisfied mind  
  
Money cant buy back  
Your youth when youre old  
Or a friend when youre lonely  
Or a love thats grown cold  
  
The wealthiest person  
Is a pauper at times  
Compared to the man  
With a satisfied mind  
  
When my life has ended  
And my time has run out  
My friends and my loved ones  
Ill leave theres no doubt  
  
But one things for certain  
When it comes my time  
Ill leave this old world  
With a satisfied mind  
  
How many times have  
You heard someone say  
If I had his money  
I could do things my way  
  
But little they know  
That its so hard to find  
One rich man in ten  
With a satisfied mind
