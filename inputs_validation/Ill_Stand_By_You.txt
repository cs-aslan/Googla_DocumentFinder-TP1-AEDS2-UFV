Oh why you look so sad tears are in your eyes  
Come on and come to me now dont be ashamed to cry  
Let me see you through cause Ive seen the dark side too  
When the night falls on you you dont know what to do  
Nothing you confess could make me love you less  
  
Ill stand by you  
Ill stand by you wont let nobody hurt you  
Ill stand by you  
  
So if youre mad get mad dont hold it all inside  
Come on and talk to me now  
Hey there what you got to hide  
I get angry too well Im a lot like you  
When youre standing at the crossroads  
And dont know which path to choose  
Let me come along cause even if youre wrong  
  
Ill stand by you  
Ill stand by you wont let nobody hurt you  
Ill stand by you  
Baby even to your darkest hour and Ill never desert you  
Ill stand by you  
And when when the night falls on you baby  
Youre feeling all alone wont be on your own  
Ill stand by you  
  
Ill stand by you wont let nobody hurt you  
Ill stand by you baby even to your darkest hour  
And Ill never desert you  
Ill stand by you  
  
Ill stand by you  
Ill stand by you wont let nobody hurt you  
Ill stand by you baby even to your darkest hour  
And Ill never desert you  
Ill stand by you
