I found the perfect picture of a perfect stranger  
It looked as if it were taken in the forties sometime  
Judging by the style  
He could be a killer or a blind man with a cane  
Perhaps he died in a car crash years ago  
Right now its impossible to tell  
I almost thought I saw him standing whistling on a bridge  
I asked him the time but when he turned around  
I saw it wasnt him at all  
Im still searching  
Im still searching  
I saw him in an airport while he was sitting on a wing  
And I waved to him but I dont think he noticed me  
Ive got a funny feeling I know who he is  
Mr X Repeat 14 times and fade
