Another red letter day  
So the pound has dropped and the children are creating  
The other half ran away  
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber  
Got a pain in the chest  
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest  
  
Its not easy love but youve got friends you can trust  
Friends will be friends  
When youre in need of love they give you care and attention  
Friends will be friends  
When youre through with life and all hope is lost  
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends  right till the end  
  
Now its a beautiful day  
The postman delivered a letter from your lover  
Only a phone call away  
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number  
As a matter of fact  
Youre getting used to life without him in your way  
  
Its so easy now cos you got friends you can trust  
Friends will be friends  
When youre in need of love they give you care and attention  
Friends will be friends  
When youre through with life and all hope is lost  
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends  right till the end  
  
Its so easy now cos you got friends you can trust  
Friends will be friends  
When youre in need of love they give you care and attention  
Friends will be friends  
When youre through with life and all hope is lost  
Hold out your hand  friends will be friends  right till the end  
  
Friends will be friends  
When youre in need of love they give you care and attention  
Friends will be friends  
When youre through with life and all hope is lost  
Hold out your hand cos right till the end  friends will be friends  
Yeah yeah
