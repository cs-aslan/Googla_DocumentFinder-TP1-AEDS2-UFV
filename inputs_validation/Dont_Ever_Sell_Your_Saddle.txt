Daddy shoulda been a preacher man  
Cause everybody loved to hear him speak  
He didnt always follow his own advice  
But we got a sermon every week  
Hed say trouble always starts as fun  
And broken hearts will always mend  
Tough times dont last tough people do  
And nothing breaks if it can bend  
  
Chorus  
Dont ever sell your saddle  
Never owe another man  
Watch where you spit on a windy day  
Dont use words you dont understand  
Find the Lord before you need him  
And never lose your pride  
Dont ever sell your saddle  
  
Cause lifes a long long ride  
Daddy never ran from anything  
Always took his share of the blame  
Had a heart big enough to fill a valley up  
But hard enough to stop a train  
He said only fight when you have to  
Cause theres always a faster gun  
And youll know a hero from a coward  
When you see which way they run  
  
Chorus  
  
Daddy left me his old saddle the day he passed on  
And these words are etched into my mind just like they were in stone  
  
Chorus
