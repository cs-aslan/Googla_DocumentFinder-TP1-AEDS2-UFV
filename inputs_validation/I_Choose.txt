Look at me Im fallin  
Off of a cliff now  
I can still hear my mama yelling No No No  
But the words mean nothing  
  
Cant catch up to me now  
And the view is so beautiful  
All the way down  
When I was a little boy  
  
Suckin juice from a bottle  
Believing my perceptions were oh so real  
But I dont know nothing  
Still knowing nothing  
  
Was just enough for me to know the way I feel  
This is life  
What a fucked up thing we do  
What a nightmare come true  
  
Or a playground if we choose  
And I choose  
  
Look at me Im swollen  
Like a banana fish now  
Im never gonna make it out of my hole  
But I keep on laughing  
  
Doesnt really matter  
Theres dozens of reasons for explaining my soul  
When I was a teenager  
Suckin booze with the Vatos  
  
Discussing who was gonna live to be 21  
They said they wouldnt make it  
They didnt make it  
Were all naked when the day is said and done  
  
This is life  
What a fucked up thing we do  
What a nightmare come true  
Or a playground if we choose  
And I choose  
  
Dont know who made this all come true  
But now while youre here  
You just gotta do what you gotta do  
Now if I wasnt such a weenie  
  
Do you think youd still love me  
Pretending Im an airplane on the living  
Room floor  
But like a lovely generator  
  
You stand right by me  
And if words were wisdom Id be talking  
Even more  
So I keep on falling  
  
As Im looking back above me  
Watching as my mama just becomes a little dot  
Now Im like DeNiro  
Im amarillo  
  
And Ill never know when I hit the ground
