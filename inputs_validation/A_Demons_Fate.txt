Youll burn this time  
Seeing the violence  
Its feeding my mind  
No one is saving you  
How can you find  
A heaven in this hell  
  
Leave it behind  
Hearing your silence  
It screams our goodbye  
Cannot believe its an eye for an eye  
Life is gone to waste  
  
Angels have faith  
I dont want to be a part of his sin  
I dont want to get lost in his world  
Im not playing this game  
  
When the shadows remain in the light of day  
On the wings of darkness hell retaliate  
Hell be falling from grace  
Till the end of all his days  
  
From the ashes of hate  
Its a cruel demons fate  
On the wings of darkness  
Hes returned to stay  
There will be no escape  
Cause hes fallen far from grace  
  
What have you done  
Is this what you wanted  
What have you become  
His souls not forsaken  
Youre walking alone  
From heaven into hell  
Now that you know  
Your way in this madness  
Your powers are gone  
Your chains have been broken  
Youve suffered so long  
You will never change  
  
Angels have faith  
I dont want to be a part of his sin  
I dont want to get lost in his world  
Im not playing this game  
  
When the shadows remain in the light of day  
On the wings of darkness  
Hell retaliate  
Hell be falling from grace  
Till the end of all his days  
  
From the ashes of hate  
Its a cruel demons fate  
On the wings of darkness  
Hes returned to stay  
There will be no escape  
Cause hes fallen far from grace  
  
Angels have faith  
I dont want to be a part of his sin  
I dont want to get lost in his world  
Im not playing this game  
  
When the shadows remain in the light of day  
On the wings of darkness  
Hell retaliate  
Hell be falling from grace  
Till the end of all his days  
  
From the ashes of hate  
Its a cruel demons fate  
On the wings of darkness  
Hes returned to stay  
There will be no escape  
Cause hes fallen far from grace
