Dont sing them songs about the open road  
I lost too many rainbows chasing pots of gold  
I still remember what my baby said  
Its still a knockin around in back of my head  
  
Chorus  
She said Im gonna lock the doors around about midnight  
Put bars on the window like a zoo  
You aint the man that reaches up to turn out my light  
Youre just another mans fool  
Just another mans fool  
  
I left this morning had just one more chance  
She caught me leaving by the seat of my pants  
She said go on get out and have a good time  
Dont bother coming home if you cant bring me mine  
  
Chorus x2
