Dont be shy just let your feelings roll on by  
Dont wear fear or nobody will know youre there  
Just lift your head and let your feelings out instead  
And dont be shy just let your feeling roll on by  
On by  
You know love is better than a song  
Love is where all of us belong  
So dont be shy just let your feelings roll on by  
Dont wear fear or nobody will know youre there  
Youre there  
Dont be shy just let your feelings roll on by  
Dont wear fear or nobody will know youre there  
Just lift your head and let your feelings out instead  
And dont be shy just let your feeling roll on by  
On by on by etc
