The manners of the heart  
We watched them grow  
Did we write everlasting love  
In the Hollywood snow  
  
The ribbons and the bows  
Wrapped us with gold  
Such pressure heaven knows  
As the fairy tale folds  
  
Who heals the broken ones  
When love has gone  
Youre not the only ones  
  
In an older time when the world was small  
When good men were standing  
Reaching out for mother love  
When the ties of blood would cheer the faintest heart  
Never thought Id see  
You fallin away from me  
  
Beneath the darker sky  
The stars are such a mess  
Can you forward my goodbyes  
To some new address  
Who heals the broken ones  
When love has gone  
Youre not the only ones  
  
In an older time when the world was small  
When good men were standing  
Reaching out for mother love  
When the ties of blood would cheer the faintest heart  
Never thought Id see  
You fallin away from me  
  
You cant turn back time  
Were stranded here  
Leave the future behind  
  
Youre not the only ones  
In an older time when the world was small  
When good men were standing  
Reaching out for mother love  
When the ties of blood would cheer the faintest heart  
Never thought Id see  
You fallin away from me
