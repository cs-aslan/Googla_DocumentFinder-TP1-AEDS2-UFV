Im chained to the highway theres no other way for me  
Always looking for a new day always a dream ahead of me  
Seems like its so many lifetimes through the sunshine rain and snow  
  
Yeah I come so far but I still got so far to go  
Yes I come so far but I still got so far to go  
  
Solo  
  
Im gonna end up dyin my body is listening for you  
But you may as well be gone already if you say dreams cant come true  
Theres been good times theres been bad but I still love the show  
  
Yeah Ive come so far but I still got so far to go  
Yeah I come so far but I still got so far to go  
Yeah I come so far but I still got so far to go  
Still got so far to go  
  
Solo  
  
Yeah Ive come so far but I still got so far to go
