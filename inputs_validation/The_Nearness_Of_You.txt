Its not the pale moon that excites me  
That thrills and delights me  
Oh no its just the nearness of you  
  
It isnt your sweet conversation  
That brings this sensation  
Oh no its just the nearness of you  
  
When youre in my arms  
And I feel you so close to me  
All my wildest dreams came true  
  
I need no soft lights to enchant me  
If you will only grant me  
The right to hold you ever so tight  
And to feel in the night  
The nearness of you
