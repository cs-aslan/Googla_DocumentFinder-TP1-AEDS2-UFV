Girl You Know  I Will Aways Always Think Of You  
  
Oh Im So Much In Love  I Cant Live Without You  
Im So Much In Love  I Always Think Of You  
Im So Much In Love  I Cant Live Without You  
Im So Much In Love  Oh See What I Can Do  
  
Oh Can You Hear The Sound Of My Tears  
Love Is A Light And Love Is A Fear  
Oh Thats No Way To Say Goodbye  
Give Me One More Chance  Just One More Try  
  
And Let Me Be In Your Arms Again  
Cause My Love Will Have No End  
Let Me Be In Your Arms Again  
Let Us Walking Hand In Hand  
  
Oh Why Oh Why  Your Love Cant Stay  
Your Turning Night Baby Into Day  
And When The Night Is Falling From The Sky  
Its Better That You Are By My Side
