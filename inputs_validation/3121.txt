DJ turn it up  
Lets go  
Three one two one  
Its loco right  
  
Through the gates knock on the door  
Put youre clothes in the pile on the floor  
Take youre pick from the Japanese robes and sandals  
Drink champagne from a glass with chocolate handles  
  
Chorus  
Dont you wanna come Three one two one  
Gonna be so much fun three one two one  
Thats where the party be three one two one  
You can come if you want to  
But you can never leave  
  
Look over there  
Theres another turnon  
Butterflies scared that theyre going to be awake all night long  
Dancin in youre belly  
Like a ballerina  
In spit of youre efforts to calm them down  
  
Chorus  
  
House party yall  
Its going down people  
Like the wall of Berlin  
  
Lock the door  
Til you see the sun  
We gon party like there aint gonna be another one  
Futuristic fantasy  
This is where the purple party people be  
This is where the party be three one two one  
  
Chorus  
  
Its goin down people  
Like the wall of Berlin
