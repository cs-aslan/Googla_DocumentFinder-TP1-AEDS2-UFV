Somebody took the papers  
And somebodys got the key  
And somebody nailed the door shut  
That says hey what you think that you see  
But me lm down around the corner  
You know Im lookin for Miss Linda Lee  
Because shes got the power  
To love me by the hour  
Gives me double you LOVE

Dont you know that it aint gonna last  
Of course you know  
It makes no difference to me

Tryin to use up the night  
But now me lm out on the corner  
You know Im lookin for Miss Linda Lee  
Because shes got the power  
To love me by the hour  
Gives me double you LOVE
