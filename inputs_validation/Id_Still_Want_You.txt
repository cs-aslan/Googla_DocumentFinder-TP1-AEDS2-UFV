I could shame you til you hide your face  
And drag you right down in disgrace  
But what good would it do  
I know Id still want you  
I could tell the world youre doin wrong  
That I was stringin you along  
And if it all were true  
I know Id still want you  
This world with me might sympathize  
When I got through with all my lies  
But Id be just as blue  
Cause my heart would still want you  
Cry oh Lord  
I could tell my friends I threw you down  
And slander your name all over town  
But what good would it do  
I know Id still want you  
If I said Im happy to be free  
The only one Id fool is me  
Because it isnt true  
I know Id still want you  
Whats the use to say that youre no good  
When Id crawl back if I could  
No matter what you do  
I know Id still want you  
Cry oh Lord  
I could smile and say that I dont care  
And then go home and pull my hair  
But what good would it do  
I know Id still want you  
I could say that someone put me wise  
And get revenge by telling lies  
But when I got all through  
I know Id still want you  
If the things I said was to break your heart  
Id be the first to take your part  
Cause if all these lies were true  
I know Id still want you  
Cry oh Lord
