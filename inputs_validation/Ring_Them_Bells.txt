Ring them bells ye heathen  
From the city that dreams  
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries  
Cross the valleys and streams  
For theyre deep and theyre wide  
And the worlds on its side  
And time is running backwards  
And so is the bride  
Ring the bells stpeter  
Where the four winds blow  
Ring them bells with an iron hand  
For the people will know  
Oh its rush hour now  
On the wheel and the plow  
And the sun is going down  
Upon the sacred cow  
Ring them bells sweet martha  
For the poor mans son  
Ring them bells so the world will know  
That God is one  
Oh the shephered is asleep  
Where the willows weep  
And the mountains they are filled  
With lost sheep  
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf  
Ring them bells for all of us who are left  
Ring them bells for the chosen few  
Who will judge the many when the day is through  
Ring them bells for the time that flies  
For the child that cries  
When the innocence dies  
Ring them bells stcatherine  
From the top of the room  
Ring the bells from the fortress  
For the lillies that bloom  
For the lines they are long  
And the fighting is strong  
And theyre breaking down the distance  
Between right and wrong
