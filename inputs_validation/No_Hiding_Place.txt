Every time I run away from you  
You searched me out and found me  
I build a wall surround myself  
But youve found a way around it  
Everywhere I go in this big old world  
Youre just one step behind me  
I turn around and there you are  
Ready to remind me  
Woah baby let me let me go  
Honey dont you know  
There is no hiding place  
Nowhere to run no escape  
There is no hiding place oh no  
There is nowhere safe to disappear without a trace  
There is no hiding place  
I walked the streets the whole night long  
Tryin to forget you  
I rode the subway end to end  
I wish Id never met you  
Coz you got some kinda hold on me  
Its so hard to fight it  
I cant get away from you  
No matter how I try  
Whoa say youll let me let me go  
Youve got to let me go  
Coz there is no hiding place  
Nowhere to run no escape  
There is no hiding place oh no  
There is nowhere safe to disappear without a trace  
There is no hiding place no no no no no no no  
I said whoa never let me let me go  
Coz baby no no  
There is no hiding place  
Nowhere to run no escape  
There is no hiding place ohh  
There is nowhere safe to disappear without a trace  
There is no hiding place  
No hiding place alright  
No hiding place  
There is nowhere safe gotta disappear without a trace  
There is no hiding place  
Hiding place baby dont you know  
You gotta let this Incomprehensible
