On Valentines I think of you  
Its just a poor excuse  
You suffer me in my mind  
Every single day its no use  
  
It seems like cool sexy stares  
But nothins been ever said  
Just keeps goin round my head  
  
I think Im waiting for you  
I think Im waiting for you  
  
Youre more than a friend and almost a lover  
It feels so good I cant help but wonder  
I keep thinking ooo whenll you discover  
Weve got the flame I want the fire  
  
Aacting cool and casual  
Check in 6pm to say hey every day  
Were edging closer to broken rules  
And getting carried away  
  
I imagine that youve heard  
Every hidden silent word  
And wed take it that bit further  
Take it that bit further  
  
I think Im waiting for you  
I think Im waiting for you  
  
Youre more than a friend and almost a lover  
It feels so good I cant help but wonder  
I keep thinking ooo  
When youll  
Discover weve got the flame I want the fire  
  
Its getting closer to now or never  
Getting closer  
Its only us and its clear  
Ooh oh oh  
I can feel it when were together  
  
Ooh youre more than a friend and almost a lover  
It feels so good I cant help but wonder  
I keep thinking ooo  
Whenll you  
Discover  
  
Mmm  
Weve got the flame  
Weve got the flame  
Weve got the flame  
I want the fire I want the fire  
  
It feels so good I cant help but wonder  
I keep thinking ooo  
Whenll you  
Discover  
  
Weve got the flame I want the fire  
I want the fire I want the fire  
I want the fire  
  
Wonder I want the fire
