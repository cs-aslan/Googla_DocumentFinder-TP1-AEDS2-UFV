I got off the airplane long about 730 in LA  
What a drag to realize that everythings so different and so same  
All my California friends are searchin for their minds and its been right
there in their heads all the time  
  
Chorus  
LA Blues LA Blues  
You want me to be like you  
Well there aint no way  
  
California Charlie met me at my room when I got in  
We toasted country pickin and the health of all our good and mutual friends  
Before the mornin came we put a handle on the world and decided that wed
give it to the squirrels  
  
Chorus  
  
Soakin up that sunshine an eatin eggs and bacon over light  
Sleepin through the daytime an contemplatin sin throughout the night  
Please hand me my hat and darlin give me back my things Ol Ts got a bunch
o songs to sing  
  
Chorus  
  
I like California I wouldnt put it down no way  
But I heard what youre thinkin and it aint exactly what I want to say  
Some day California Ill come roarin back to you if you dont fall in the
ocean fore I do  
  
Chorus
