Close your eyes make a wish  
This could last forever  
If only you could stay with me now  
So tell me what it is that keeps us from each other now  
Yeah its coming to get me  
Youre under my skin  
  
Chorus  
No I cant let you go  
Youre a part of me now  
Caught by the taste of your kiss  
And I dont want to know the reason why I cant stay forever like this  
Now Im climbing the walls cause I miss you  
  
Take my hand take my life  
Just dont take forever  
And let me feel your pain kept inside ohh yeah  
Theres gotta be a way you and I together now  
Yeah its comin to get me  
Youre under my skin  
  
Chorus  
  
Its an illusion how can I feel this way  
if I cant have you  
Its an illusion nothing is real this way  
if I cant have you  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant let you go no  
And I dont want to know the reason why  
I cant stay forever like this no no  
Now Im climbing the walls cause I miss I miss you you
