Well its the M  I  crooked letter aint no one better  
And when Im on the microphone you best to wear your sweater  
Cause Im cooler than a polar bears toenails  
Oh hell there he go again talking that shit  
Bend corners like I was a curve I struck a nerve  
And now you bout to see this Southern player serve  
I heard its not where youre from but where you pay rent  
Then I heard its not what you make but how much you spent  
You got me bent like elbows amongst other things but Im not worried  
Cause when we step up in the party like Im outyouscurry  
So go get your fuckin shine box and your sack of nickles  
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr Pickles  
Daddy fat sacks BIG BOI  
Its that same motherfucker that took them knuckles to your eye  
And I try to warn you not to test but you dont listen  
Giving the shout out to my Uncle Donnel locked up in prison  
  
Now throw your hands in the air  
And wave em like you just dont care  
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit  
Then everybody let me hear you say OYeayer  
  
Now throw your hands in the air  
And wave em like you just dont care  
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit  
Then everybody let me hear you say OYeayer  
  
Now my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation  
To the female gender aint nothin better  
Let me know when its wet enough to enter  
If not Ill wait because the future of the world depends on  
If or if not the child we raise gon have that nigga syndrome  
Or will it know to be the hard regardless of the skintone  
I really feel that if we tune it it just might get picked on  
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone  
The alienators cause we different keep your hands to the sky  
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what a preach aint no lie  
Ill be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie  
Now breaker breaker 104 can I get some reply  
Now everybody say  
  
Now throw your hands in the air  
And wave em like you just dont care  
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit  
Then everybody let me hear you say OYeayer  
  
Now throw your hands in the air  
And wave em like you just dont care  
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit  
Then everybody let me hear you say OYeayer  
  
Everyday I sit while my nigga be in school  
Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool  
Like ES to the PN cause we adjust to the beat in the zone zone  
Honey Im home but Im not married  
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated  
And now Im sitting at the end of the month I just made it  
Like you made the B team  
And like the daddys wife you making the coffee  
You heard the ATLiens  
So back the hell up off me  
  
Softly as if I played piano in the dark  
Found a way to channel my anger not to embark  
The worlds a stage and everybodys got to play their part  
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts  
The job of speaking through us we be so sincere with this here  
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day  
Put my glock away I got a stronger weapon  
That never runs out of ammunition so Im ready for war okay  
  
Now throw your hands in the air  
And wave em like you just dont care  
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit  
Then everybody let me hear you say OYeayer  
  
Now throw your hands in the air  
And wave em like you just dont care  
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit  
Then everybody let me hear you say OYeayer
