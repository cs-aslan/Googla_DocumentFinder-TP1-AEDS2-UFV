Im coming round to see you  
Kicking down your door  
Ive got to tell you girl  
I really cant take no more  
cause Ive been hearing about you  
Everybody says youre front page news  
Laying it down all around the town  
Giving all the boys the blues  
  
Stand and deliver in the name of love  
Im coming after you  
Ill tell you want Im gonna do  
  
Im going straight for the heart  
Gonna drive you crazy  
Going straight for the heart  
Im gonna drive you insane  
  
I never loved a woman  
The way that I love you  
I cant escape the feeling  
You dont know what youre putting me through  
  
So stand and deliver in the name of love  
My heart is in your hand  
So try to understand  
  
Straight for the heart  
  
Im going straight for the heart  
Gonna drive you crazy  
Going straight for the heart  
Im gonna drive you insane  
  
You got the love I dream of  
The kind that cost so much  
Just cover me with kisses baby  
Surrender to my touch  
  
Stand and deliver in the name of love  
My heart is in your hand  
So try to understand  
Im coming after you  
Ill tell you what Im gonna do  
  
Im going straight for the heart  
Gonna drive you crazy  
Going straight for the heart  
Im gonna drive you insane  
  
Straight for the heart  
Gonna drive you crazy  
Going straight for the heart  
Im gonna drive you insane  
  
Straight for the heart
