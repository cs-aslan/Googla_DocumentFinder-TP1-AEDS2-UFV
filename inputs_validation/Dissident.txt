She nursed him there ooh over a night  
I wasnt so sure she wanted him to stay  
What to say what to say  
But soon she was down soon he was low  
At a quarter past a holy no  
She had to turn around  
  
When she couldnt hold oh she folded  
A dissident is here  
Escape is never the safest path  
Oh a dissident a dissident is here  
  
And to this day shes glided on  
Always home but so far away  
Like a word misplaced  
Nothing said what a waste  
When she had contact with the conflict  
There was meaning but she sold him to the state  
She had to turn around  
  
When she couldnt hold she folded  
A dissident is here  
Escape is never the safest path  
Oh a dissident a dissident is here  
  
She gave him away when she couldnt hold no she folded  
A dissident is here  
Escape is never the safest path  
Oh a dissident a dissident is here  
Couldnt hold on she couldnt hold no she folded  
A dissident is here  
Escape is never the safest place  
A dissident is here
