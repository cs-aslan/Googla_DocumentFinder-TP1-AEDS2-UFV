Every Friday night theres a steady cloud of dust  
That leads back to a field filled with pickup trucks  
Its got old Hank crankin way up loud  
Got coolers in the back tailgates down  
Theres a big fire burning but dont be alarmed  
Its just country boys and girls getting down on the farm  
  
Well you can come as you are there aint no dress code  
Just some rural route rules that you need to know  
Dont mess with the bull he can get real mean  
Dont forget to shut the gate stay out of the green  
If it starts to raining will just head to the barn  
Where country boys and girls are getting down on the farm  
  
You can have a lot of fun in a New York minute  
But theres some things you can do outside those city limits  
Aint no closing time aint no cover charge  
Just country boys and girls getting down on the farm  
  
Eds been on his tractor aint seen Becky all week  
Somebody said they seen em heading down to the creek  
Farmer Johnsons daughters just pulled up in a jeep  
Man he knows how to grow em if ya know what I mean  
Old Daves gettin loud but he dont mean no harm  
Its just country boys and girls getting down on the farm  
  
Ah lets get down yall  
Stay out of that hay
