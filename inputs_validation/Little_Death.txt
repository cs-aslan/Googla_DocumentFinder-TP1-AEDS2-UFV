Get your forehead into my kiss  
Embrace me careful darkness  
All my love fades away  
Little Deaths reflections of  
Whos the darkest muthafucker on the planet  
Fiction tied to death I know I am it  
Immortal love  
  
Hey Hey Hey Wanna set you free  
Hey Hey Hey Would you die for me  
  
Gimme Little Death its so romantic Oh Oh  
Fuck it up to death it aint so tragic no  
  
Hatred will immortal wings  
Vampires and Blackened Children  
Kiss of the from my lips  
Death we are death weve always been  
Whos the darkest muthafucker on the planet  
Just so close to death I know I am it  
Demon son  
  
Hey Hey Hey Wanna set you free  
Hey Hey Hey Would you die for me  
  
Gimme Little Death its so romantic oh oh  
Fuck it up to death it aint so tragic no  
  
Gimme Little Death its so romantic Ahhh gimme something  
Come feel young and special gas of magic  
  
In your forehead into my kiss  
Embrace me a careful darkness  
Death we are death weve always been  
Whos the darkest muthafucker  
  
In your forehead into my kiss  
Embrace me a careful darkness  
Death we are death weve always been  
Whos the darkest muthafucker  
  
Darkest muthafucker on the planet  
Just so close to death I know I am it  
Demon son  
  
Hey Hey Hey Wanna set you free  
Hey Hey Hey Would you die for me  
  
Gimme Little Death its so romantic oh oh  
Fuck it up to death it aint so tragic no  
Gimme Little Death its so romantic Ahhh gimme something  
Come feel young and special gas of magic
