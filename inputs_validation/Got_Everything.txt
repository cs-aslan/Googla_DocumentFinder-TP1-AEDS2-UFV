Baby I go hard so hard sometimes its hard to tell whether not Im even on

Got something to say then fuck em aint trying to lose out on all of this for
nothing  
Im usually just balling and shit whatever I want Ima get  
No time to count the money that I got because all of its getting spent  
And all of my niggas grind so all of us getting rich  
And most of these niggas fly but all of em aint the shit  
Thats why you holding me down been doing it ever since  
Only one I wanna be round and counting up all these chips wit

Cant ever see you choosing nothing over instead of me  
Wont ever leave you youre the one I need so thats how Im gonna treat you  
Take you places where they using different language to greet you  
Smile and shake when they meet you  
Lot of cake but you got a lot of love from me and when Im home you cant get

Aint going nowhere for sure feel like you stuck with me  
Swear I feel lucky I get anything I want  
And if I need it then you got it if I say it then you trust me  
Dont see you much but when I do I need your love and Ima need it in a rush
