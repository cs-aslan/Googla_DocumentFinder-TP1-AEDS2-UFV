If maybe youd move over  
Gave someone else a chance to try their luck  
Instead you run up closer  
Tryn to grab a page before they close the book  
  
Chorus  
It was over fore it started seemed so long when we began  
Hope you take it like a friend  
Its a shame to see you cryin  wouldnt think to way back when  
Looks like ill never hear the end  
  
Thought you had the honor  
Took special pride in all your well laid plans  
  
Forgot about the others  
We moved out tward the light showin empty hands  
  
Chorus  
  
Ah put the boot down mmhm  
  
Love to be the winner  
Gather up your chips in time to cash em in  
Were all lookin thinner  
Playin cards too close for either one to win  
  
Chorus  
  
Its a shame to see you cryin wouldnt think to way back when  
Hope you take it like a friend  
Yeah
