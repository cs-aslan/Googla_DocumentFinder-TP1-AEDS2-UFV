In the high life Ive got this feeling now  
Ive got this horrible feeling  
On the escalator they took it out on him  
As the ridiculous world went by  
  
Oh hes gone  
Hes my insatiable one  
Oh he is gone  
Hes my insatiable one  
Oh   
  
  
On the high wire dressed in a leotard  
There wobbles one hell of a retard  
On the escalator you shit paracetamol  
As the ridiculous world goes by  
  
  
Oh he is gone  
Hes my insatiable one  
Oh he is gone  
Hes my insatiable one  
Oh   
  
  
Oh he is gone  
Hes my insatiable one  
Oh he is gone  
And he was my inflatable one  
Oh
