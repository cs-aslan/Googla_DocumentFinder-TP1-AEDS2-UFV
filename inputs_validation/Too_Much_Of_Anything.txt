I think these hands have felt a lot  
I dont know what have I touched  
I think these eyes have seen a lot  
I dont know maybe theyve seen too much  
  
I think this brain has thought a lot  
Searching trying to find the crutch  
I think this heart has bled once too often  
This time its bled a bit too much  
  
Too much of anything too much for me  
Too much of everything gets too much for me  
  
I cant remember before 49  
But I know that 48 was there  
My ears let in what I should speak out  
Hmmm theres something in the air  
  
Ooh Ive overloaded on my way  
Bye bye bye bye you better keep in touch  
Think your ears hear a whole lot of music  
And like me theyve caught a bit too much  
  
Too much of anything is too much for me  
Too much of everything gets too much for me  
  
I think these hands have felt a lot  
I dont know what have I touched  
I think these eyes have seen a lot  
I dont know maybe theyve seen too much  
  
I think this brain has thought a lot  
Oh searching trying to find the crutch  
I think these ears hear a whole lot of music  
And like me theyve heard a bit too much  
  
Too much of anything is too much for me  
Too much of everything gets too much for me
