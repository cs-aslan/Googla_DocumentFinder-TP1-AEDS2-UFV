I have a purpose I have a purpose  
I have a purpose I have a purpose  
I have a purpose I have a purpose  
I have a purpose I have a purpose  
I have a purpose  
Take your little knife stab me  
Go strike my heart  
Take your little knife stab me  
Go strike my heart  
I have a purpose I have a purpose  
I have a purpose I have a purpose  
Such things cant exist  
Such things cant exist  
I have a purpose I have a purpose  
I have a purpose I have a purpose  
I have a purpose  
You will tell them of me  
And how one day I shall come for them  
You will tell them of me  
And how one day I shall come for them  
I have a purpose I have a purpose  
I have a purpose  
Quietly I will come over your bed  
I will lean over and gently bite your neck

I have a purpose I have a purpose  
I have a purpose I have a purpose  
I have a purpose I have a purpose  
I have a purpose  
You will tell them of me  
And how one day I shall come for them
