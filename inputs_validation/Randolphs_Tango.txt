The senorita took off her bobby socks  
She said shes gonna wear a skirt that shocks  
Shes pulling out all the stops  
To get her Randolph back again  
  
Meanwhile Randolph hes back at the ranch  
Hes getting ready for tonights song and dance  
Hes doesnt know he doesnt stand a chance  
His last affair will be his last romance  
  
The senorita will be there waiting  
Dont go my Randolph slow tango with me  
  
Underneath the Latin moonlight  
The danced and seen a falling star in flight  
To the strum of guitars she held him tight  
She wants her Randolph back again  
  
Meanwhile its worthwhile for Randolph to wait  
Till he gets the nerve then he wont hesitate  
He doesnt know but hes just bit the bait  
He just asked if he could make a date  
  
The senorita will be there waiting  
Dont go my Randolph slow tango with me  
  
The senoritas heart is in love  
She wearing white tonight looks as pure as a dove  
Shes thanking God and all the heavenly stars above  
Randolphs romance is back again  
  
Meanwhile Randolph smiles and says hell give her ten  
She doesnt come so he just counts again  
And hes been there since he does not know when  
Hes thinks shes stood him up but in the end  
  
The senorita wont keep him waiting  
Dont go my Randolph slow tango with me  
  
Senorita dance cheek to cheek  
We will dance off into the sky
