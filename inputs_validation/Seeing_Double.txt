Doctor doctor am I alright  
I keep on stayin up  all through the night  
Smokin drinkin watchin tv til the light  
  
Its been a long time since I slept  
All I seem to think about is what I aint yet  
Im seeing double  
  
Doctor doctor am I in need  
Seems like theres somethin wrong with me  
Underneath this stone lies a different guy  
  
My head says yeah  my body says no  
I cant seem to get up  I cant seem to go  
  
Im seeing double  
In the middle of my life  its just a little strange  
All those people  theyre alright  if theyd stop messin with my brain  
  
I remember when the world was new  
Doctor doctor what can you do  
  
Im tired of runnin  give me something to slow down  
Aint been to bed in over a week  
I cant catch up son sleep  its playing hide n seek  
Im seeing double
