When does a dream become a nightmare  
When do we do what must be done  
When do we stand and face the future  
When there is nowhere left to run  
  
And youve got to learn  
Just how to survive  
Youve got to learn  
How to keep your dream alive  
  
Take a look at my face  
I am the future  
How do you like what you see  
Take a look at my face  
I belong to the future  
And you belong to me  
  
When does a dream become a nightmare  
When do we learn to live with fear  
When we cry out for some salvation  
Why is it no one seems to hear  
  
Youve got to learn  
Its up to you  
If you can learn  
That the dream just might come true  
  
Take a look at my face  
I am the future  
How do you like what you see  
Take a look at my face  
I belong to the future  
The world belongs to me yeah  
  
Take a look at my face  
I am the future  
Now how do you like what you see  
Take a look at my face  
I belong to the future  
And the world it belongs to me  
It belongs to me  
  
Its all mine  
Just take a look at my face  
Im the future no disgrace  
Take a look at my face  
This world belongs to To me
