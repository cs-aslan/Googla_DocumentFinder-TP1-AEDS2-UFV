Nettie  
When you walk through a storm  
Keep your chin up high  
And dont be afraid of the dark  
  
When you walk through a storm  
Keep your chin up high  
And dont be afraid of the dark  
At the end of the storm  
Is a golden sky  
And the sweet silver song of the lark  
  
Chorus sings with Nettie  
  
Walk on through the wind  
Walk on through the rain  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown  
Walk on walk on with hope in your heart  
And youll never walk alone  
Youll never walk alone
