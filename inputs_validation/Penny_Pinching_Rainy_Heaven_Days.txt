Every morning traffic  
Every night Ive had enough  
Every day compromise  
Lifes no surprise after much  
  
Chorus  
Someday people lock themselves away  
Saving up for another empty  
Penny pinching rainy heaven day  
  
Noone talks at night  
They scream and fight and say too much  
My wife dreams all day  
My life says it has heard enough  
  
Chorus  
  
Laa rainy heaven days  
Laa rainy heaven days  
  
Chorus  
  
La la la la la la la  
Laa rainy heaven days  
Laa rainy heaven days  
  
Chorus  
  
Rainy heaven days Repeat x 6
