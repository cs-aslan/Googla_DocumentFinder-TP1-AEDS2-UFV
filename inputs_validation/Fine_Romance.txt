A fine romance with no kisses  
A fine romance my friend this is  
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes tomahtoes dear  
But youre as cold as yesterdays mashed potahtoes potatoes  
  
A fine romance you wont nestle  
A fine romance you wont even wrestle  
Youve never mussed the crease in my blue serge pants  
You never take a chance this is a fine romance  
  
A fine romance my good fellow  
You take romance Ill take Jello  
Youre calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean  
At least they flap their fins to express emotion  
  
A fine romance my dear Duchess  
Two old fogies we really need crutches  
Youre just as hard to land as the Ile de France Fronce  
I havent got a chonce chance this is a fine romance  
  
A fine romance my good woman  
My strong agedinthewood woman  
You never give those orchids I send a glance  
Theyre just like cactus plants oh boy  
This is a fine romance
