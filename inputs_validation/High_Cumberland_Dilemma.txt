Its been a little fever and maybe Bucky Beaver  
Who made me pull the lever and leave once again  
We chose just not to marry but go ahead and carry  
All of our earthly goods and go to live out in the woods  
  
Midnight on the mountain and you watch the clouds roll by  
Country airs appealin but theres more than meets the eye  
Meets the eye  
  
Moonlight on the cabin and youre too damn cold to sleep  
Your head turns from my pillow so I cant see you weep  
See you weepSarah sleep  
  
Stoned alone together least the city streets have drains  
Standing here ass high up in the rain longin for Boston  
Once again  
  
Sarahs cold and hungry and the babys due any day  
Stuck up in high country and it dont thaw out til May  
Here well stay  
  
Mountain fevers on me and tonight the truck broke down  
Doctor in the valley but we cant get in to town  
He dont come round  
  
Sarah cried for Boston and her mother late last night  
I reassured her everything was tight but Im not sure that its all  
right  
  
Midnight on the mountain and you watch the clouds roll by  
Country airs appealin but theres more than meets the eye  
Meets the eye
