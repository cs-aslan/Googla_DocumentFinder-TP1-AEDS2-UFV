Down at the bottom of that dirty ol river  
Down where the reeds and the catfish play  
There lies a dream as soft as the water  
There lies a bluebird thats flown away  
  
Well to meet is like springtime  
And to loves like the summer  
Her brown eyes shone for nobody but me  
Then autumn forever the fool come a fallin  
And the rain turned to freezin inside of me  
  
Ill kindle my fires with the words  
I cant send you  
And the roads I cant follow  
And the songs I cant sing  
  
Well all you young ladies  
Who dream of tomorrow  
While youre a listenin  
These words will I say  
Cling to today with its joy  
And its sorrow  
Youll need all your memories  
When youth melts away  
  
Well the angel of springtime  
He rides down the southwind  
The angel of summer  
He does just the same  
The angel of autumn  
Shes blue and shes golden  
And the angel of winter  
Wont remember your name  
  
Down at the bottom of that dirty ol river  
Down where the reeds and the catfish play  
There lies a dream as soft as the water  
There lies a bluebird thats flown away  
  
There lies a bluebird  
Thats flown away
