Everything inside of me  
Is burning up for you to see  
And if we should get into it  
A twoway kind of syndicate  
Hold me  
  
Compare us to a Ferris wheel  
Just be sure what you want to steal  
Some people do it by the book  
But I prefer to go by feel  
Tell me  
  
I wanted to get out of here  
But every time I reappear  
Now I have the words my dear  
To whisper out into your ear  
Hey yeah  
  
Chorus  
Cmon girllets go  
Lets get it rightlets go  
Lets get it rightlets go  
Lets get it rightlets go  
x4  
  
The spirit of a dragons tear  
Is lovely at this time of year  
The cave within your mountainside  
Is deeper than it will be wide  
Hold me  
  
My disenchanted diplomat  
Asleep inside the laundromat  
Conveyor belts are moving  
And I want you to be sure of that  
Tell me  
  
And if you let it germinate  
I know it will be worth the wait  
Disputed by the news that it was  
You who tried to instigate  
  
Chorus  
  
Blessed are the hypocrites  
Outwitted but she never quits  
The trouble with the band of slits  
Is washing off the muddy bits  
Hey yeah  
  
Oh yeah shes with me and Im your man  
If I cant find you no one can
