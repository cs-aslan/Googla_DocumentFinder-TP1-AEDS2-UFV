Burnin  
Oh no oh no here we go now  
Oh no oh no here we go now  
Oh no oh no here we go now  
Oh no  
  
Went to New York to cut my first LP  
Ridin down Broadway in a taxi  
Hang a right at 25th  
Just a little too swift jo  
  
Let me out Im gonna walk from here on  
Heres 4 bucks you drive like a moron  
Lost in The Apple and Im all alone  
  
Cause New Yorks Not My Home  
  
In the village chillin with a 40 in a brown bag  
Im seein freaks and also fags  
I see a set of nice legs in my site  
But its a fuckin transvestite  
  
Walkin in the daylight  
Now Im trippin and Im like blown  
But I take another sip and say to each his own  
Hede get dissed in Detroit but Ill leave him alone  
  
Cause New Yorks Not My Home  
  
Now if your sounds are knockin to the cool Kid Rockin  
Has got your girl jockin  
Take a chill pill young man close your flap  
Cause like the Piston Joe Im goin back to back  
  
With a track uh thats just too clean  
I got my pistol packed and a fifth of Jim Beam  
Only 19 and my name aint Wilbur  
But I pull more hoes then Long Jon Silver  
  
I dont dress up or try to look pretty  
Instead I rock the house in every major city  
From the tip of Maine to the coast of Cali  
I get down and I yodel in the valley  
Cant say Im from the Bronx or Brookland zones  
  
Cause New Yorks Not My Home  
  
Ate ave in the 40 deuce its like a freak show  
A lot of hookers try to pop that week so  
I walk with a limp when I pimp through  
Or comack those hoes if Im illin with the Beast Crew  
  
Its pickin up ill check this fact  
These Mother Fuckers pay over 250 for a big mac  
Conjested overcrowded see ya Im gone  
  
Cause New Yorks Not My Home
