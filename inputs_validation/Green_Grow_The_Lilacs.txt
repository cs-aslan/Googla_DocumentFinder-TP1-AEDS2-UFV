I used to have a sweetheart but now Ive got none  
Since shes gone and left me I care not for one  
Since shes gone and left me contended Ill be  
For she loves another one better than me  
  
Green grow the lilacs all sparklin with you  
Im lonely my darling since partin with you  
And by the next meeting I hope to prove true  
And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue  
  
I passed my loves window both early and late  
The look that she gave me made my heart ache  
The look that she gave me was harm for to see  
For she loves another one better than me  
  
Green grow the lilacs all sparklin with you  
Im lonely my darling since partin with you  
And by the next meeting I hope to prove true  
And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue  
  
I wrote my love a letter in rosy red lines  
She sent me an answer all twisted and twine  
Saying keep your love letters and I will keep mine  
Write to your sweetheart and Ill write to mine  
  
Green grow the lilacs all sparklin with you  
Im lonely my darling since partin with you  
And by the next meeting I hope to prove true  
And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue
