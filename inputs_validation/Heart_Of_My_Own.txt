I cant go near the scent of flowers  
I cant look at the sky  
I cant turn on the radio  
And not cry  
  
I wont watch lovers holding hands  
Or the sun sinking down  
I cant look at a single thing in this town  
  
You were playing a game and I  
I lost count of the days and the nights  
Do you know that you were my life  
  
Im tryin hard to find all thats left of me  
Now that you left me alone  
Tired of runnin away from your memory  
I need a heart of my own  
  
I have looked through every single book  
Torn through every poem  
Heard the words of every voice  
That Ive known  
  
How can you have such a hold on me  
When youve already let go  
You must have more power than I know  
  
Woah  
You were playing a game and I  
I lost count of the days and the nights  
Oh did you know that you were my life   
  
Im tryin hard to find all thats left of me  
Now that you left me alone  
Im tired of runnin away from your memory  
I need a heart of my own  
  
You gave me heaven and showed me how to fly  
Then laughed when I fell from the sky yeah  
  
guitar interlude  
  
Tired of runnin away from your memory  
I need a heart of my own  
  
Im tryin hard to find all thats left of me  
Now that you left me alone  
Im tired of runnin away from your memory  
I need a heart of my own  
  
repeat chorus
