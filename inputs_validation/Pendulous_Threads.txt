Mend this careless thread its gone askew  
Thread on my sweater is pendulous step back and pull it  
Watch it unravel faster than a speeding bullet  
Or pull and see how much we can undo  
Thread on my sweater is pendulous step back and pull it  
Watch it unravel faster than a speeding bullet  
On a burning bridge  
Your options are minimal at best  
Depending on where youre standing  
And how much breath is in your chest  
If it came down to it  
Would you hightail home and hide  
Or dance on fire and enjoy the ride

Thread on my sweater is pendulous step back and pull it  
Watch it unravel faster than a speeding bullet  
At the heart of it all  
That innermost your fiery core  
Theres an amassing armor  
Its building you into a bore  
Lifes a match in a gas tank  
Dont ever mourn the ebbing tide  
Just dance on fire  
And enjoy the ride hey
