Subconscious strange sensation  
Unconscious relaxation  
What a pleasant nightmare  
And I cant wait to get there again  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
Theres another vivid surprise  
Another whole life waiting  
Chapters unfinished fading  
  
Closer now  
Slowly coming into view  
Ive arrived  
Blinding sunshine beaming through  
  
Theres a house Im drawn into  
Familiar settings nothing new  
Theres a pathway leading there  
With a haunting chill in the air  
  
Theres room at the top of the stairs  
Every night Im drawn up there  
Theres a girl in the mirror  
Her face is getting clearer  
Young child wont you tell me why Im here  
  
In her eyes  
I sense a story never told  
Behinde the disguise  
Theres something tearing  
At her soul  
  
Tonight Ive been searching for it  
A feeling thats deep inside m  
Tonight Ive been searching for  
The one that nobody knows  
Trying to break free  
  
I just cant help myself  
Im feeling like Im going out of my head  
Tears my heart into two  
Im not the one the sleeper thought he knew  
  
Back on my feet again  
Eyes open to real world  
Metropolis surrounds me  
The mirrors shattered the girl  
  
Why is this other life  
Haunting me everyday  
Id break through the other side  
If only Id find the way  
  
Somethings awfully familiar  
The feelings so hard to shake  
Could I have lived in that other world  
Its a link that Im destined to make  
  
Im still searching but I dont know what for  
The missing key to unlock my minds door  
  
Today I am searching for it  
A feeling that wont go away  
Today I am searching for it  
The only one I know  
Trying to break free  
  
I just cant help myself  
Im feeling like Im going out of my head  
Tears my soul into two  
Im not the one I thought I always knew  
  
I just cant help myself  
Im feeling like Im going out of my head  
Uncanny strange Deja Vu  
But I dont mind  
I hope to find the truth
