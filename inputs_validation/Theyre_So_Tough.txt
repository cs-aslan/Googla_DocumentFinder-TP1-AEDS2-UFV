Theyre so tough  
They like to make us feel little  
They like to make us feel small  
And keep us down  
Till we feel no good at all  
  
Then they tell us that were stupid  
That we got no sense at all  
Theyll keep away the spark  
Keep us in the dark  
Make us feel we have no vision at all  
  
Chorus  
No no no I dont believe it has to be this way  
No I dont believe it has to be this way  
  
Then they tell us to be patient  
That our time will come  
But Ive stood outside their doors  
And walked their floors  
And I aint gonna do it again  
  
Theyd like to make me their nigger  
I say to hell with them  
Im not gettin down on my knees  
And beggin please  
Can you throw me a crumb now and then  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant really speak to you  
And I dont know about them  
They must be out of their minds  
Cant read between the lines  
They can stick it where the sun dont shine  
  
Chorus  
  
Theyre so tough  
They are so tough
