A true song as real as my tears  
  
But youve no need to fear it  
  
Cause no one will hear it  
  
Sad songs and waltzes arent selling this year  
  
Ill tell all about how you cheated  
  
Id like for the whole world to hear  
  
Id like to get even  
  
With you cause youre leavin  
  
But sad songs and waltzes arent selling this year  
  
Its a good thing that Im not a star  
  
You dont know how lucky you are  
  
Though my record may say it  
  
No one will play it
