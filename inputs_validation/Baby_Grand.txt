Late at night  
When its dark and cold  
I reach out  
For someone to hold  
When Im blue  
When Im lonely  
She comes through  
Shes the only one who can  
My baby grand  
Is all I need  
  
In my time  
Ive wandered everywhere  
Around this world  
She would always be there  
Any day  
Any hour  
All it takes  
Is the power in my hands  
This baby grands  
Been good to me  
  
Ive had friends  
But they slipped away  
Ive had fame  
But it doesnt stay  
Ive made fortunes  
Spent them fast enough  
As for woman  
They dont last with just one man  
But baby grand  
Will stand by me  
  
They say that no ones gonna play this on the radio  
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone  
But only songs like these  
Played in minor keys  
Keep those memories holding on  
  
Ive come far  
From the life Ive strayed in  
Ive got scars  
From those dives Ive played in  
Now Im home  
And Im weary  
In my bones  
Every dreary one night stand  
But baby grand  
Came home with me  
  
Ever since this gig began  
My baby grands  
Been good to me
