Come and gather around at the table  
In the spirit of family and friends  
And well all join hands and remember this moment  
Til the season comes round again  
  
Lets all try to smile for the picture  
And well hold it as long as we can  
May it carry us through  
Should we ever get lonely  
Til the season comes round again  
  
Chorus  
One night holy and bright  
Shining with love from our hearts  
By a warm fire  
Lets lift our heads high  
And be thankful were here  
Til this time next year  
  
May the new year be blessed  
With good tidings  
Til the next time I see you again  
If we must say goodbye  
Let the spirit go with you  
Til the season comes round again  
  
Chorus  
May the new year be blessed with good tidings  
Til the next time I see you again  
If we must say goodbye  
Let the spirit go with you  
And well love and well laugh  
In the time that we had  
Til the season comes round again
