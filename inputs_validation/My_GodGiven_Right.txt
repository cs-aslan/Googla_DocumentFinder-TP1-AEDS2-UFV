Why should i wait what is left there for me  
I come to claim  
To win the game  
Why should i plea for my fair and right move  
I come to play  
I come to stay  
  
I dont wanna bitch around no more  
I dont wanna stand back anymore  
  
Its my godgiven right  
To stand and fight  
For what i like  
Its my godgiven brain  
That cried in pain  
Would i resign  
Theres nothing to gain  
If i would restrain  
Theres nothing to find  
If i stay behind  
Its my right  
My godgiven right  
  
Why should i lose if i am meant to win  
I know i can  
Ive got a plan  
All that they told me is right and so wrong  
I went through schools  
Found my own rules  
  
I dont wanna bitch around no more  
I dont wanna stand back anymore  
  
Its my godgiven right  
To stand and fight  
For what i like  
Its my godgiven brain  
That cried in pain  
Would i resign  
Theres nothing to gain  
If i would restrain  
Theres nothing to find  
If i stay behind  
Its my right  
  
My godgiven right  
Its my godgiven right  
My godgiven right  
Its my godgiven right  
  
Its my godgiven right  
To stand and fight  
For what i like  
Its my godgiven brain  
That cried in pain  
Would i resign  
Theres nothing to gain  
If i would restrain  
Theres nothing to find  
If i stay behind  
Its my right  
My godgiven right
