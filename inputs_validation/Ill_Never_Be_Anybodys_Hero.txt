Ill never be Anybodys heroMorrissey  
  
Warm lights from the grand houses blind me  
Haves cannot stand havenots  
And my love is under the ground  
My one true love is under the ground  
And Ill never be  
Ill never be  
Ill never be anybodys hero now  
Ill never be  
Ill never be  
Ill never be anybodys hero now  
They who should love me walk right through me  
I am a ghost and as far as I know  
I havent even died  
And my love is under the ground  
My one true love is under the ground  
And Ill never be  
Ill never be  
Ill never be anybodys hero now  
Ill never be  
Ill never be  
Ill never be anybodys hero now  
Ill never be  
Ill never be  
Ill never be anybodys lover now  
Ill never be  
Ill never be  
Ill never be anybodys lover now  
Things Ive heard and Ive seen  
And Ive felt and Ive been  
Tell me Ill never be anybodys lover now  
It begins in the heart  
And it hurts when its true  
It only hurts because its true
