I was never one for singing what I really feel  
Except tonight Im bringing everything I know thats real  
  
Stars they come and go they come fast or slow  
They go like the last light of the sun all in a blaze  
And all you see is glory  
Hey but it gets lonely there when theres no one here to share  
We can shake it away if youll hear a story  
  
People lust for fame like athletes in a game  
we break our collarbones and come up swinging  
some of us are downed  
some of us are crowned and some are lost and never found  
But most have seen it all  
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls  
They always come up singing  
  
Some make it when theyre young  
before the world has done its dirty job  
and later on someone will say  
Youve had your day now you must make way  
But theyll never know the pain of living with a name you never owned  
or the many years forgetting what you know too well  
That the ones who gave the crown have been let down  
You try to make amends without defending  
Perhaps pretending you never saw the eyes of grown men of twentyfive  
that follow as you walk and ask for autographs  
Or kiss you on the cheek and you never can believe they really loved you  
Some make it when theyre old  
Perhaps they have a soul theyre not afraid to bare  
or perhaps theres nothing there  
  
Stars they come and go they come fast they come slow  
They go like the last light of the sun all in a blaze  
And all you see is glory  
But most have seen it all  
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls  
They always have a story  
  
Some women have a body men will want to see  
and so they put it on display  
Some people play a fine guitar I could listen to them play all day  
Some ladies really move across the stage and gee they sure can dance  
I guess I could learn how if I gave it half a chance  
  
But I always feel so funny when my body tries to soar  
And I seem to always worry about missing the next chord  
I guess there isnt anything to put up on display  
Except the tunes and whatever else I say  
But anyway that isnt really what I meant to say  
I meant to tell a story I live from day to day  
  
Stars they come and go theyre coming fast they come slow  
They go like the last light of the sun all in a blaze  
And all you see is glory  
But most have seen it all  
who live their lives in sad cafes and music halls  
And we always have a story  
  
So if you dont lose patience with my fumbling around  
Ill come up singing for you even when Im down
