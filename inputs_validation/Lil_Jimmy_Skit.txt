Man  
Hey Jimmy where you going  
  
Jimmy  
I dont know where Im going  
My Dad died and he left me his degrees  
My mom would always say Dad why dont you work  
But he just kept learning  
All the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school  
And I was actually in school all when my dad was in school  
He was so greedy with degrees he took my degree  
And now Im just glad he left me these  
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper and look what I have  
These are documented  
My father left them for me  
And Im going to leave them to my kids  
Im going to learn too  
Im going to get super smart so I to can die without money  
But Ill be the smartest dead guy  
Who has that
