Yellow canary tennis bracelet necklace knahmsayin  
Three quarter black mink shades canaries in both ears  
Knahmsayin Black Phantom triple black with the oak wood  
Gucci shoes thats how I play  
  
Hold up I dont gamble I dont play no craps  
I was taught early on dont jeopardize the stacks  
Before I open my mouth I get all the facts  
I could never fall off its too many hot tracks  
Im affiliated with too many hot cats  
To end up crawlin out of a hole in Iraq  
Try to topple my regime  
You end up in need of a scalpel to your spleen  
Is there a medic on the scene  
Easy children Queens is in the buildin  
That blank look on your grillll get filled in  
Slow down baby you actin like a clown homes  
You get your fronts remodeled like a brownstone  
You hear my heat rock comin through your sheetrock  
It means youre ODn homeboy here come the detox  
I get my swagger on proud as a peacock  
Bars is hot beats is pumpin like a  box  
  
Chorus  
Shake it baby shake it  
If you a real OG put your hands in the air with me cmon  
Shake it baby shake it  
Young ladies in the spot if you came up in the place to rock cmon  
Shake it baby shake it  
Divided we fall stay together and forever we ball cmon  
Shake it baby shake it  
You do it for the gangsters  
I do it for the ladies but its all money baby  
  
They pay me so much its hard for them to swallow  
When you got em by the balls their hearts and minds follow  
Pay yourself first thats one of my main mottos  
Picture Bill Gates on the block dodgin hollows  
I cant see it player thats beneath my vision  
Im beyond focused every decision is made with precision  
It seems like greeds the world religion  
But L want cake save the crumbs for the pidgeons  
Black man get the flies outcha eyes  
You cant cause where you born but you affect where you die  
Until that day health and welfare cheers  
And after my wake the hoodll talk man listen here  
He kept a mink and canaries in his ears  
Like the Enterprise rollin over stars for years  
Spit bars for years kept hot cars for years  
The dice was loaded but he beat the odds for years uhhuh  
  
Chorus  
  
To be or not to be the man thats the question  
Got a vision in my mind I can see that Im destined  
To lean up in the backseat givin directions  
Sweep the block clean as November elections  
On the Blackberry readin cash flow quadrant  
Brim to the side my gorillas is bonded  
CLS Vision four Humers behind it  
You forgot Im from Queens You can get reminded  
Im a mans man when you chumps gon learn  
If you play with fire you get poured in a urn  
You must have been puffin on blunts of sherm  
All my albums is platinum its been confirmed  
Im more than a symbol of sex I get respect  
For livin in the hills but still keepin it mad real  
Stay on course the boss crush obstacles  
You burnin me two words Impossible  
  
Chorus  
  
Like I said  
Yellow canary tennis on the neck  
Three quarter black mink  
Gucci hat to the side shades  
Gucci shoes baggy jeans  
Black Phantom oak wood  
Thats how I play  
Yeah  
Shake it baby shake it  
You do it for the gangsters  
I do it for the ladies but its all money baby
