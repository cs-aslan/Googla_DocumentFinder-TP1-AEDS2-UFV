Saw a man who was fiftyone  
He bad married daughters and a single son  
And hes lost his job as this years begun  
And it broke my heart  
  
Saw his wife who was fiftytwo  
She said she was sure they could make it through  
That her single wage would just have to do  
And it broke my heart  
  
Talked about it with the family now  
What began in sadness ended up a row  
All the guys with the clever mouths  
They were saying we should move south  
Saw the son whos been gone two weeks  
And hes down already with a job to seek  
And hes in Kings Cross and theres noone speaking  
And it broke my heart
