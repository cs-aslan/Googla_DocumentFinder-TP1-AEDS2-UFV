Are you living in an old mans rubble  
Listening to the father of lies  
If you are then youre headed for trouble  
Listen too long youll eventually die  
  
Too late for walking in the middle  
Too late to try  
And its too late for sitting in the balance  
No more middle line  
  
Are you puzzled by the way that youre behaving  
You wonder why you do the things you do  
Are you troubled by your lack of resistance  
It feels like somethings got a hold on you  
  
Are you living in an old mans rubble  
Listening to the father of lies  
If you are then youre headed for trouble  
If you listen too long youll eventually die  
  
When Im losing my sense of direction  
And Im needing some strength and protection  
Walking away with You  
I go walking away with You and when I  
When I think I cant stand any longer  
And Im crying for someone thats stronger  
Walking away with You  
I go walking away with You  
  
El Shaddai El Shaddai  
ElElyon na Adonai  
Age to age Youre still the same  
By the power of the name  
  
El Shaddai El Shaddai  
Erkamka na Adonai  
I will praise and lift You high  
El Shaddai  
  
Im gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But Im gonna fly  
Im lighter than air  
  
And Im gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But Im gonna fly  
And soar through the air  
  
Cause I have felt for the first time  
I can be myself  
No more faces to hide behind  
Just a smile  
And a dream thats mine  
Even if I am  
The only one  
Who wants to fly  
  
I may not be every mothers dream for her little girl  
And my face may not grace the mind of everyone in the world  
But thats all right as long as I can have one wish I pray  
When people look inside my life I want to hear them say
