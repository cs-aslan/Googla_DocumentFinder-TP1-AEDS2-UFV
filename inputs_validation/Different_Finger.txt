Please put your rings on a diffrent finger if you meet me tonight  
Cause I cant stand those suspicious glances  
Cause I know the things theyre saying are right  
  
Theyre saying why dont you straighten up  
And see what youve got to lose  
Put it all down to fate but you still got the chance to choose  
  
I dont want to hear your whole life story  
Or about my strange resemblance to some old flame  
All I want is one night of glory  
I dont even know your second name  
  
Please put your rings on a diffrent finger cause weve got so much at stake  
I cant stand those suspicious glances  
Cause they seem to cover evry move I make  
  
But if I can be alone with you completely tonight  
Put your rings on a diffrent finger  
Before I turn out the light
