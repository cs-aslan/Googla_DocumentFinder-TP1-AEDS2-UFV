I opened my eyes this morning and I wasnt at home in bed  
There was four angels standing round me I thought I must be dead  
Well I opened my eyes this morning thought I must be dead  
Four angels standing round me and the room was painted red  
  
Wont you have my sugar on your waiting son  
Take me up to heaven its not hell where I belong  
Yeah  
  
Well the stars began to tremble and rain began to fall  
Four angels standing round me an it wasnt no social call  
Well the stars began to tremble and rain began to fall  
I got down on my knees praying Lord but it didnt do no good at all  
  
Wont you have my sugar on your waiting son  
Take me up to heaven its not hell where I belong  
Yeah
