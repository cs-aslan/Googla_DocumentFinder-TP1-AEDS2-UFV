I watched from my window as she slipped from the house  
Once again shes leaving but Lord shes not to blame  
This morning a memory phoned her and hes a habit she cant break  
So til she returns Ill wait for her  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
The devil drove the taxi that carried her away  
And it hurts to know shes hung up on some guy from yesterday  
Once again shes chasing memories and Im losing everything  
But I love her so Ill wait for her  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
Ill pick up the pieces when he lets her down again  
With love and understanding Ill give her reasons this time to stay  
And Ill close my eyes pretending maybe someday she will change  
And I wont be left lonely  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
Yes the devil drove the taxi that carried her away  
And it hurts to know shes still hung up on some guy from yesterday  
Once again shes chasing memories and Im losing everything  
But Lord I love her so Ill wait for her  
Looking out my window through the pain
