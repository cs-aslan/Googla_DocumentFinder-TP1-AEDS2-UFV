If we dont know where weve been  
How can we figure out where we going  
And if we dont know how we are  
We should just cover up the scars  
We did it wrong wrong wrong we didnt know  
You said it all all all all  
I was too slow  
I shouldve know know know  
Its harder when you gone  
  
We know the hurt its in our hearts  
And all the pain that feels our love  
We got the pain here in our blood  
No matter what we still love we still love  
You will go back in my heart  
We still love we still love  
Real love will make us really how we are  
  
I dont mean for my mistakes  
Im just a foolish man that I can change  
Before you know it is too late  
We gotta learn to love again  
  
And I was wrong wrong wrong we do I know  
You said it all all all all  
Then let me go  
I shouldve know know know  
  
You were too strong  
Now its all the way youre gone  
  
We know the hurt its in our hearts  
And all the pain that feels our love  
We got the pain here in our blood  
No matter what we still love we still love  
You will go back in my heart  
We still love we still love  
Real love will make us really how we are  
  
We still love we still love  
You will go back in my heart  
We still love we still love  
Real love will make us really how we are  
  
And I was wrong wrong wrong we do I know  
You said it all all all all  
Then let me go  
I shouldve know know know  
You were too strong  
Now its all the way youre gone  
  
We know the hurt its in our hearts  
And all the pain that feels our love  
We got the pain here in our blood  
No matter what we still love we still love  
You will go back in my heart  
We still love we still love  
Real love will make us really how we are
