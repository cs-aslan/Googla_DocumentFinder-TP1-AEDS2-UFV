Verse 1  
Am I just a fool  
Blind and stupid for loving you  
Am I just a silly girl  
So young and naive to think you were the one who came to take claim of this
heart  
Coldhearted shame youll remain just afraid in the dark  
  
Chorus  
And now the people are talking the people are saying that you have been
playing my heart like a grand piano  
The people are talking the people are saying that you have been playing my
heart like a grand piano  
So play on play on play on  
Play on play on play on  
Play on play on play on  
Play on play on  
  
Verse 2  
Am I being a fool  
Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths  
What do I see in you  
Maybe Im addicted to all the things you do  
Cause I keep thinking you were the one who came to take claim of this heart  
Coldhearted shame youll remain just afraid in the dark  
  
Chorus
