Candy talks to strangers  
Thinks her lifes in danger  
No one gives a damn about her hair  
Its lonely down on track street  
She used to go by Jackie  
The cops theyll steal your dreams and theyll kill your prayers  
Take a number where the blood just barely dried  
  
Wait for something better  
No one behind you  
Watching your shadows  
This feeling wont go  
  
Crooked wheels keep turning  
Children are you learning  
Acclimatize but dont you lose the plot  
A history of blisters  
Your brothers and your sisters  
Somewhere in the pages we forgot  
  
Take a number Jackie  
Where the blood just barely dried  
You know Im on your side  
  
Wait for something better  
No one behind you  
Watching your shadows  
You gotta be stronger than the story  
Dont let it blind you  
Rivers of shadow  
This feeling wont go  
  
And the sky is full of dreams  
But you dont know how to fly  
I dont have a simple answer  
But I know that I could answer  
Something better  
  
This feeling wont go  
  
Wait for it Repeat x4
