Honor and adore You  
We lift You high and we bow before You  
Holy is Your name everyday the same  
Youre worthy Youre worthy

Enter His court His courts with praise  
Be thankful unto Him and bless His name  
His mercy endureth forever

At all times I will  
I will bless the Lord

At all times I will  
I will bless the Lord
