I just want to be better than your heads only medicine  
A downward spiral just a pirouette  
Getting worse til theres nothing left  
What good comes of something when Im just the ghost of nothing  
Im just the man on the balcony singing  
Nobody will ever remember me  
Rejoice rejoice and fall to your knees  
for a  
Lunatic of a god or a god of a lunatic  
Oh their faces are dancing  
Theyre dancing til  
Til they cant stand it  
A composer but never composed  
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed  
A composer but never composed  
Singing  
I only want what I cant have  
Heralded as a king before I had a birthday  
With double digits  
Fit the crown to my head but I was only a kid  
Im just the man on the balcony singing  
Nobody will ever remember me  
Rejoice rejoice and fall to your knees  
for a  
Lunatic of a god or a god of a lunatic  
Oh their faces are dancing  
Theyre dancing til  
Til they cant stand it  
A composer but never composed  
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed  
A composer but never composed  
Singing  
I only want what I cant have  
I just want to be better than your heads only medicine  
Im just the man on the balcony singing  
Nobody will ever remember me  
Rejoice rejoice and fall to your knees  
for a  
Lunatic of a god or a god of a lunatic  
Oh their faces are dancing  
Theyre dancing til  
Til they cant stand it  
A composer but never composed  
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed  
A composer but never composed  
Singing  
I only want what I cant have
