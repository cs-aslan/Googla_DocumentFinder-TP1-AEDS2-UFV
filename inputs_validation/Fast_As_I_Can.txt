From the first hello you gave to me Ive done nothing else but smile  
And I know youre in a hurry but its gonna take a while  
So forgive me if we go slow but theres something I think you should know  
  
Im going fast as I can please dont make me rush  
This feelings coming on way too fast  
Ill tell you all of the things that youll never forget  
But Im not ready say I love you yet  
Im not ready to say I love you yet  
  
Dont push me in too deep Ive always been the fool who rushes in  
Youve got to take the pieces one by one before youve got everything  
So forgive me if we go slow but theres something I think you should know  
  
Therell be times when Im mistaken therell be times when were gonna fight  
But you neednt doubt we can work it out and in time well get it right  
So forgive me if we go slow but theres something I think you should know  
  
From the first hello
