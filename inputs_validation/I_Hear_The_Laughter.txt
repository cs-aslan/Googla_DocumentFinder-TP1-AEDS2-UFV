Listening to the falling rain  
Always seems to bring her back again  
I can remember like it was yesterday  
Sound of her voice her look upon her face  
Like children playing childrens games  
We joked and laughed at every passing day  
Im so much older things have changed  
Ive realized that now its just too late  
  
I hear the laughter echoin through my brain  
I hear the laughter then Im alone again  
I tried to forget her heaven knows  
Seems theres no direction left to go  
I can remember like it was yesterday  
I hear the laughter then Im alone again  
  
Im alone again alone again  
I wish that I could hold you now  
I wish that I could turn this all around  
Its just my foolish fantasy  
But that wont bring your sweet love back to me  
  
I hear the laughter somebody called my name  
I hear the laughter and I can feel the pain  
I hear the laughter echoing through my brain  
I hear the laughter then Im alone again  
I hear the laughter I hear the laughter
