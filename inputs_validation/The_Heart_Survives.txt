When she turned away you know it was just in time  
Cause Id used up all my strength  
And you cant let a woman see you cryin  
And you know its real  
Shes not gonna change her mind  
You choose not to change your ways  
Though she begged you a thousand times  
  
And you dont understand  
And you want to be a man about it  
In time youll learn to live without it  
And you know that youll survive  
But still sometimes you doubt it  
If you can stand a little rain  
Youre gonna grow again  
Cause you know that when love dies  
The heart survives  
  
Your stare at the empty walls  
Inside of this vacant home  
You walk through these hollow halls  
And at night you sleep alone  
  
And you dont understand  
And you want to be a man about it  
In time youll learn to live without it  
And you know that youll survive  
But still sometimes you doubt it  
If you can stand a little rain  
Youre gonna grow again  
Cause you know that when love dies  
The heart survives  
  
Youve been over it so many times in your head  
Looking for a hidden message of hope  
In something she said  
Still you find nothing to make this bad dream end  
Tell me how many sleepless nights will you spend  
  
And you dont understand  
And you want to be a man about it  
In time youll learn to live without it  
And you know that youll survive  
But still sometimes you doubt it  
If you can stand a little rain  
Youre gonna grow again  
Cause you know that when love dies  
The heart survives
