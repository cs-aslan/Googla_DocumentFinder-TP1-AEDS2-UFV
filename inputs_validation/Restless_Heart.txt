Restless heart restless mind  
Im tired of wasting  
My precious time  
  
There are times in my life  
I dont know witch way to turn  
When everything I touch  
I get my fingers burned  
Dreams to ashes ashes to dust  
When all that glitters  
Is dull with rust  
  
Restless heart restless mind  
Im tired of wasting  
My precious time  
  
Im torn and tattered  
Shattered and worn  
Ive had enough  
Trying to live my life  
In the eye of the storm  
Every heartache  
Leaves a scar on my face  
Somebody reach out  
Or throw me a line  
Get me out of this place  
  
Restless heart restless mind  
Im tired of wasting wasting  
My precious time  
  
Oh so tired  
  
Restless heart restless mind  
Im tired of wasting  
My precious time  
  
Restless heart restless mind  
Im tired of wasting wasting  
All of my precious time  
  
Restless heart restless mind  
So Im tired of wasting wasting  
All of my precious time time time  
  
Restless heart
