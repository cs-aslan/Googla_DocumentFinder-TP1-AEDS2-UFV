Dont stamp your foot at me  
Its impolite  
To stamp your foot at me  
Is not quite right  
At mans ingratitude  
A woman winks  
But such an attitude just stinks  
  
I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks  
I have words that do not come from childrens books  
theres a trick with a knife Im learning to do  
And everything Ive got belongs to you  
Ive a powerful anesthesia in my fist  
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist  
There are hammerlock holds  
Ive mastered a few  
And everything Ive got belongs to you  
Share for share share alike  
You get struck each time I strike  
You for me me for me  
Ill give you plenty of nothing  
Im not yours for better but for worse  
And Ive learned to give the wellknown witches curse  
Ive a terrible tongue a temper for two  
And evrything Ive got belongs to you  
  
Dont raise your voice at me  
Thats very rude  
To raise your voice at me  
Is rather crude  
Its wrong essentially when woman yells  
And confidentially it smells  
  
Ill converse with you on politics at length  
Ill protect you with my superhuman strength  
If youre ever attacked Ill scream and say  Boo  
And everything Ive got belongs to you  
I will never stray from home Ill just stay put  
Cause Ive got a brandnew thing called athlete s foot  
Im a victim of colds anemia too  
And everything Ive got belongs to you  
Off to bed we will creep  
Then well sleep and sleep and sleep  
Till the birds start to peep  
Ill give you plenty of nothing  
Ill be yours forever and a day  
If the first good breeze does not blow me away  
Youre enough for one man thats why Ill be true  
And everything Ive got belongs to you  
  
You may have some things that I cant use at all  
When I look at you your manly gifts are small  
Ive a wonderful way of saying adieu  
And everything Ive got belongs to you  
You wont know how good I am until you try  
And youll let my well of loneliness run dry  
Ive a marvelous way of telling you no  
And everything Ive got belongs to you  
And everything you want belongs to me  
And everything you need belongs to me  
  
Life has no shape or form  
And no design  
It isnt life without  
That fool of mine  
I used to gad about  
With any chap  
And now Im sad about my sap  
  
Hes a living thing that isnt quite alive  
He has brains enough for any child of five  
Oh he isnt too rich in vigor and vim  
But everything Ive got belongs to him  
Hes a naughty brat that cant be left alone  
He has eyes for every skirt except my own  
Even under a tree he grabs for the limb  
But everything Ive got belongs to him  
Something beats in his chest  
But its just a pump at best  
Im for him hes for him  
He gives me plenty of nothing  
When I see that funny face I know  
Something scared his mother twenty years ago  
But Ill never let go hell never be free  
Till everything hes got belongs to me  
  
And everything Ive got belongs to him  
And everything Ive got belongs to us
