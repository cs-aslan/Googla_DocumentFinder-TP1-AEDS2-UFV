Theres a stranger in my bed  
Theres a pounding in my head  
Glitter all over the room  
Pink flamingos in the pool  
I smell like a minibar  
DJs passed out in the yard  
Barbies on the barbeque  
This a hickey or a bruise  
  
 PreChorus   
Pictures of last night  
Ended up online  
Im screwed  
Oh well  
Its a blacked out blur  
But Im pretty sure  
It ruled  
Damn  
  
 Chorus   
Last Friday night  
Yeah we danced on tabletops  
And we took too many shots  
Think we kissed but I forgot  
Last Friday night  
Yeah we maxed our credit cards  
And got kicked out of the bar  
So we hit the boulevard  
Last Friday night  
We went streaking in the park  
Skinny dipping in the dark  
Then had a menage a trois  
Last Friday night  
Yeah I think we broke the law  
Always say were gonna stop op whoa  
This Friday night  
Do it all again  
This Friday night  
Do it all again  
  
Trying to connect the dots  
Dont know what to tell my boss  
Think the city towed my car  
Chandelier is on the floor  
Ripped my favorite party dress  
Warrants out for my arrest  
Think I need a ginger ale  
That was such an epic fail  
  
 prechorus   
Pictures of last night  
Ended up online  
Im screwed  
Oh well  
Its a blacked out blur  
But Im pretty sure  
It ruled  
Damn  
  
 Chorus   
Last Friday night  
Yeah we danced on tabletops  
And we took too many shots  
Think we kissed but I forgot  
Last Friday night  
Yeah we maxed our credit cards  
And got kicked out of the bar  
So we hit the boulevard  
Last Friday night  
We went streaking in the park  
Skinny dipping in the dark  
Then had a menage a trois  
Last Friday night  
Yeah I think we broke the law  
Always say were gonna stop Whoa  
But this Friday night  
Do it all again  
This Friday night  
Do it all again

 Chorus   
Last Friday night

Last Friday night  
We went streaking in the park  
Skinny dipping in the dark

Last Friday night  
Yeah I think we broke the law  
Always say were gonna stop Whoaa  
This Friday night  
Do it all again
