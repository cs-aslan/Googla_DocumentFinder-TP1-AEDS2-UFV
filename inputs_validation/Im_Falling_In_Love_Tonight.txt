Dance with me darlin til dawn  
I want to sway in your arms  
Til the stars fade away  
Fade away  
Moving together as one  
Til the first gentle rays of the sun  
Light up the day  
Light the day  
  
Chorus  
And while the music still plays  
Please let me hear you keep saying  
Over and over Im falling  
Falling in love with you  
  
Say theres no way I could lose you  
Hold me tight  
Im falling in love tonight  
Touch me and tell me its true  
That Im not asleep and that you  
Are not just a dream  
Just a dream  
  
Here with your heart pressed to mine  
We flow like the river that winds  
Its way to the sea  
To the sea  
  
Chorus  
  
Say theres no way I could lose you  
Hold me tight  
Im falling in love tonight  
Hold me tight  
Im falling in love tonight
