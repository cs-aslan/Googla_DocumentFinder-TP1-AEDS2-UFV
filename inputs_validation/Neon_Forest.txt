Im sliding like a lizard on my belly and back  
Its a miracle I havent fallen through any cracks  
The life on display is trouble for sure  
The drugs that I took have made me impure  
  
The neon forest is lighting up  
The neon forest is lighting up  
My brain  
  
Ive learned some nasty lessons so Im shutting  
My mouth  
A fury in my gut is spinning me round  
And round  
To be a total phony is the winning design  
When the fabric of life is a horny goldmine  
  
The neon forest is my home  
And like a cartoon cat I roam  
Where only kids are still alive  
And anyway theyre gonna fry  
My brain  
  
You can get a weird prize for being adored  
You can join the in crowd for being a whore  
Although you are lonely you wish for a fence  
America takes drugs in psychic defense  
You can say what you want but nobodys there  
Have you got any money  
Are you anybody
