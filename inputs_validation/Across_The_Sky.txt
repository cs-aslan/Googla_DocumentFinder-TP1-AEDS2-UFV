Im no stranger to deception  
I have lied and been lied to  
Im no paragon of virtue  
But I wanna be with you  
I have never been a righteous soul  
And I dont pretend I am  
But I walk the line when Im with you  
Cause you make me believe I can  
  
But were runnin out of options  
And were runnin out of time  
And I dont know if its you or me  
But its time to speak your mind  
  
Because Im traveling across the sky  
When youre with me your hand in mine  
Our honesty will make us fly  
And well be traveling across sky  
Across the sky oohhhhh  
Across the sky oohhhhh  
Across the sky oohhhhh  
Across the sky oohhhhh  
  
Im not good at keeping quiet  
And I cant keep this tied down  
But its got to count for somethin  
That were still hangin around  
If you need an explanation for  
What is false and what is true  
  
Then Id rather stop the world than think  
That I could not be with you  
  
But were runnin out of options  
And were runnin out of time  
And I dont know if its you or me  
But its time to speak your mind  
  
Because Im traveling across the sky  
When youre with me your hand in mine  
Our honesty will make us fly  
And well be traveling across sky  
Across the sky oohhhhh  
Across the sky oohhhhh  
Across the sky oohhhhh  
Across the sky oohhhhh  
  
Across the sky oohhhhh  
Traveling across the sky  
Across the sky oohhhhh  
Traveling across the sky  
Across the sky oohhhhh  
Traveling across the sky  
Across the sky oohhhhh  
Traveling across the sky
