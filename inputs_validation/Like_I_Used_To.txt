I know you expected me  
To act just like a schoolgirl  
Followed your rules  
Just like a fool  
Wrapped up in your world  
Whats good for you  
Dont mean thats so good for me  
What can I do but hang around  
And lose myself just like I used to  
Go round and round just like a loose screw  
  
Well I aint gonna walk  
With my heart in my hand  
And take things lying down like before  
Wont take your crap the way I used to  
Aint gonna be the way it used to  
Alright for you aint alright for me  
  
Maybe I was weak though the average  
Person probably thinks Im stronger  
When I need someone else  
I shut out myself  
Scared to say the wrong words  
Whats right for you  
Dont think thats alright for me  
You spread the glue so I cant move  
And stick to you just like I used to  
Go round and round just like a loose screw  
  
Oh I aint gonna walk  
With my heart in my hand  
Aint gonna do it like I used to  
Go round and round just like a loose screw  
Alright for you aint alright for me no  
Every time you put me down  
Every time you screw me around  
Every time you do that to me  
Im my own possession  
Im my own possession
