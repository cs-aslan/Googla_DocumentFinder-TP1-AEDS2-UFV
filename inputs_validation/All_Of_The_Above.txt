I am your sexy girl  
I am your baby girl  
I am your innocence  
I am your mother  
Im Lady Chatterly  
Or Lady Chastity  
Or some anonymous lover  
  
I can be your little virgin At the Commack Motor Inn  
Or your dominatrix In your parents bed  
Well play some spin the bottle  
Well play some Marvin Gaye  
Or we can dress you up in womens clothing  
  
Chorus  
Lets go shopping at the Pink Pussycat  
You talk to the salesman  
Ill hide in the back  
I may be bashful but  
I got the cash cause  
I aint afraid to try new things like that  
Whatever youre thinking  
Whatever youre feeling  
Ill be either one or  
All of the above  
Whatever youre thinking  
Whatever youre feeling  
Ill be either one or  
All of the above  
  
Im a widow in mourning Lonely for your love  
Im the bride on her wedding day And you are not the groom  
Im a singing telegram at 2AM  
Or the french maid who comes to clean your room  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill keep you guessing babe  
You wont need confession no  
Ill be either one or  
All of the above  
Well I couldnt imagine  
If I couldnt be myself  
Cause if youre afraid to ask for what you want  
Then you might rebel  
But if youve got that combination where  
You can play some show and tell  
Well dont be shameful  
I am your rainbow  
Liberate your body and  
Soothe your soul  
  
I can be your babysitter Who let you stay up late  
Or your best friends mother Really hot date  
Or your favorite cousin She taught you how to french kiss  
Or Miss Finnegan from health class  
Im a school girl in knee socks With pigtails in her hair  
Im Aphrodite for dinner Or Linda Carter  
Im rose petals  
Im ruby wine  
And if you want  
Ill be the presidents wife  
  
Chorus
