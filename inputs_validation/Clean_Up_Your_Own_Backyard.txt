Back porch preacher preaching at me  
Acting like he wrote the golden rules  
Shaking his fist and speeching at me  
Shouting from his soap box like a fool  
Come Sunday morning hes lying in bed  
With his eye all red with the wine in his head  
Wishing he was dead when he oughta be  
Heading for Sunday school  
Clean up your own backyard  
Oh dont you hand me none of your lines  
Clean up your own backyard  
You tend to your business Ill tend to mine  
Drugstore cowboy criticizing  
Acting like hes better than you and me  
Standing on the sidewalk supervising  
Telling everybody how they ought to be  
Come closing time most every night  
He locks up tight and out go the lights  
And he ducks out of sight and he cheats on his wife  
With his employee  
Clean up your own backyard  
Oh dont you hand me none of your lines  
Clean up your own backyard  
You tend to your business Ill tend to mine  
Armchair quarterbacks always moanin  
Second guessing people all day long  
Pushing fooling and hanging on in  
Always messing where they dont belong  
When you get right down to the nittygritty  
Isnt it a pity that in this big city  
Not a one alittle bitty manll admit  
He could have been a little bit wrong  
Clean up your own backyard  
Oh dont you hand me dont you hand me none of your lines  
Clean up your own backyard  
You tend to your business Ill tend to mine  
Clean up your own backyard  
You tend to your business Ill tend to mine
