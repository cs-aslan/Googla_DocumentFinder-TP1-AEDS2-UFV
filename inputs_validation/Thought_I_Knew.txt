Sorry  
About my past life  
Sorry  
But we just missed  
Sorry it had to end up  
Like this  
  
Sorry  
If I caused you pain  
Sorry  
I forgot your name  
Sorry  
But you left me out  
In the rain  
  
Chorus  
Thought I knew  
You better than  
Thought I knew  
Your intentions  
Thought I knew  
But I didnt have  
A clue  
Not a single damn thing  
Was true  
  
Sorry  
If I caused you harm  
Sorry  
Im no good luck charm  
Sorry  
You didnt end up  
In my arms  
  
Chorus  
  
Now that I  
Worlds gone down  
Weve traded away  
Blew out the spark  
And now were left  
With broken hearts  
Tryin to find  
A new place to start  
  
Chorus x2
