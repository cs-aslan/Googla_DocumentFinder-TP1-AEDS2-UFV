Early man walked away  
As modern man took control  
There minds werent all the same  
And To conquer was their goal  
So he built his great empire  
And he slaughtered his own kind  
And He died a confused man  
He Killed himself in his own mind  
He Killed himself in his own mind  
He Killed himself in his own mind  
He Killed himself in his own mind  
  
Lets Go  
  
Were only gonna die from our own arrogance  
Thats why we might as well take our time
