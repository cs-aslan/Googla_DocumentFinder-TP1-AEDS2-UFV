Hey darkness dont you try  
To steal the moment or close my eyes  
I wont let you in  
  
Cause this feels too damn good to me  
All I want and all I need  
Is her touch again and again and again  
  
Chorus  
I dont want to go to sleep tonight  
I dont want anything to change  
I dont want to wake up and find a different day  
Yeah she makes me free  
Here between the day and the twilight  
I dont want to go to sleep tonight  
  
Time stop dead in your tracks  
Turn around and dont look back  
And just let us be  
  
Im gonna take this time and soak it up  
Forever wouldnt be long enough  
If you knew her youd agree agree with me  
  
Chorus  
  
I wish the sun would just forget to come up  
And just leave us wrapped up in this love  
  
Chorus
