I see you walkin down the street  
Youre turnin into paradise  
The boys are crawlin at your feet  
Burn them and turn them to ice  
No one gets a piece of your heart  
Its over cause you wont let it start  
You keep your love in chains love in chains  
And only fear remains and keeps your love in chains  
But isnt it time enough isnt it time enough  
Oh yeah  
  
They know you feel just like a queen  
Baby are you havin life  
But all the things theyd never seen  
Stab at your heart like a knife  
  
No one knows the way that you love  
Its over when its never begun  
You keep your love in chains love in chains  
And only fear remains and keeps your love in chains  
But isnt it time enough oh isnt it time enough  
Oh yeah  
  
But isnt it time enough oh isnt it time enough  
You keep your love in chains love in chains  
And only fear remains and keeps your love in chains  
But isnt it time enough oh isnt it time enough  
  
Love in chains love in chains  
Love in chains love in chains  
Love in chains love in chains  
Love in chains love in chains  
Love in chains
