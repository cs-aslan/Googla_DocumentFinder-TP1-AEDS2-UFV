For a long time I felt without style or grace  
Wearing shoes with no socks in cold weather  
I knew my heart was in the right place  
I knew Id be able to do these things  
  
And as we watch him digging his own grave  
It is important to know that was where hes at  
He cant afford to stopThat is what he believe  
Hell keep on digging for a thousand years  
  
Im walking a line  
Im thinking about empty motion  
Im walking a line  
Just barely enough to be living  
Get outta the way  
No time to begin  
This isnt the time  
So nothing was done  
Not talking about  
Not many at all  
Im turning around  
No trouble at all  
You notice theres nothing around you around you  
Im walking a line  
Divide and dissolve  
  
Never get to say much never get to talk  
Tell us a little bit but not too much  
Right about then is where she give up  
She has closed her eyes she has give up hope  
  
Im walking a line  
I hate to be dreaming in motion  
Im walking a line  
Just barely enough to be living  
Get outta the way  
No time to begin  
This isnt the time  
So nothing was done  
Not talking about  
Not many at all  
Im turning around  
No trouble at all  
Im keeping my fingers behind me hind me  
Im walking a line  
Divide and dissolve  
  
I turn myself around Im moving backwards and forwards  
Im moving twice as much as I was before  
Ill keep on digging to the center of the Earth  
Ill be down in there moving the in the room  
  
Im walking a line  
Visiting houses in motion  
Im walking a line  
Just barely enough to be living  
Get outta the way  
No time to begin  
This isnt the time  
So nothing was done  
Not talking about  
Not many at all  
Im turning around  
No trouble at all  
Two different houses surround you round you  
Im walking a line  
Divide and dissolve
