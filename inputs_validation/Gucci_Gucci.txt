One big room full of bad bitches x8  
  
Verse 1  Lil Wayne  
Fu got the weed Marl got the gun  
They say numbers dont lie  
Bitch Im not the one  
Hammers in ya face this is not a dream  
And you get in every page in this magazine  
Bumping ugk talking about a murder  
We roll a Dr Jay and then we light that Julius Erving  
I got pssy on the way and pssy on the way out  
Life is a beach and these hoes trying to lay out  
Tunechi Tunechi toaster tooly  
Fck around and pop ya  
My homies got that white girl

Glock for Tini nina colada  
Suck swallow semen saliva

Weezy go hard you bitches go figure  
Diamonds in my teeth like Im a fcking dope dealer  
Youre a dead man walking Michael Jackson Thriller

My homies got that white girl

Verse 2  Lil Wayne  
Back where I started on my set in black  
All chrome Glock looking like a platinum plaque  
We dont pack extra clips we pack extra Gats  
And all my hoes dirty like welcome mats  
Til the wheels fall off I can fix a flat  
If youre scared go to church and get a scripture tat  
Guns the size of children now dont be childish  
Be with wildass niggas and I am the wildest  
Im a motherfcker call me Weezy baby  
And on the end of the barrel I got a sweet potato  
My life is a movie I got a leading lady  
My rooftop drop back like Tom Brady  
I got the world in my hands skateboard n my vans  
And all my boys stay strapped like we live in Iran  
I know what I can do so bitch I do what I can  
Drop the Sorry 4 the Wait man  
Im just saying  
  
Im in one big room full of bad bitches
