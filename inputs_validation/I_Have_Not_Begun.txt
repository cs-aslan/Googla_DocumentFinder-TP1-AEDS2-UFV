Maybes a chance Ive already keep yall waitin  
This goes out to everybody still hatin  
For those that fake yall can keep on fakin  
Pokin a plate for you to sink your whole face in  
Taste good only cause its just so you know its nothin  
I getchu buggin like tabooie and some robutussin  
Its just the way that I notions time I slap the track  
And turn around and choke each rhyme pyrochlast  
To the nation like NPC with pairs of 60s like an MPC  
To letter an ass woopin via mp3  
Givin you people more reality than MTV  
Do a PPV snap necks with the pressure mega mess  
To carry you out on a stretcher  
You consume the ewl the law wont protect ya  
Even the courtroom sketcha can out sketch ya  
And now followin me got your number on column  
A D try you can holla with me approach the pain  
Ima check the body in threes you can sittin there stuttering  
Prprobably follow me  
  
Hook  
I got styles you can chop me one  
Back in line I know you wanna stop me son  
Heres news for you fcka that cannot be done  
You can look and eye it pissed I have not begun  
  
Alcoholic police close to bat  
You think youre hard muhfcka youre an easter egg  
You gotta past at shell with a soft inside  
Squash your pride you think I fckin lost my mind  
Im not playin I might as well be makin a bomb  
Im layin down a foundation when Im takin you on  
Bet the fall of the rhyme for the sake of my mom  
Shes like Mike show these pigs what kind of bacon youre on  
Its funny but dont laugh money with no cash  
The real of the vocab killin is no path  
The realest to romat dont even know half  
Im rankin a full tank youre runnin on low gas  
  
Hook  
Take that crack off your fund  
Youre nothin but a butternife stoppin a gun  
You can dance with your chances slim and none  
You can take it I have finished I have not begun  
  
Gotta razor blade tongue  
And I kid this done  
No wonder just dumpin on your crew for fun  
Machine stop got it locked like the games a joke  
Say summin funny get the whole gang to vote  
Let em pucka now fcka go get your own  
Weve been roamed ten years since we did this note  
The people on the block start to get numb  
They expect it its fresh when the new sht come  
It grows let em know they can fix around  
Railroad rap hot tracks one and youre down  
And theyre askin repeat how I do this now  
Like Im really gonna tell em how I get this sound  
We just doin what we do gettin from that place  
We come in the back like were on this btch  
Turn the lights down low when we start this show  
What you two get me right back in the go  
  
Hook  
Its take that take that cuttin if your fun  
Youre nothin but a butternife stoppin a gun  
You can dance with your chances slim to none  
You can think that I am finished I have not begun  
  
Follow me I got styles you can chop me one  
Back in line I know you wanna stop me son  
But I got news for you fcka that cannot be done  
You can think that I am finished I have not begun
