Your six blade knife can do anything for you  
Anything you want it to  
One blade for breaking my heart  
One blade for tearing me apart  
Your six blade knifedo anything for you  
You can take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin  
When you come up from behind and lay it down cold on my skin  
Took a stone from my soul when I was lame  
Just so you could make me tame  
  
You take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin  
Id like to be free of it now I dont want it no more  
Id like to be free of it now you know I dont want it no more  
Everybody got a knife it can be just what they want it to be  
A needle a wife or something that you just cant see  
You know it keeps you strong  
Yes and itll do me wrong  
Your six blade knife do anything for you
