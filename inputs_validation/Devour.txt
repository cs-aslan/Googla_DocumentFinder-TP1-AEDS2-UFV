Ill swallow up all of you  
Like a big bottle of big big pills  
Youre the one that I should never take  
But I cant sleep until I devour you  
I cant sleep until I devour you  
Youre a flower thats withering  
I cant feel your thorns in my head  
  
This is no impressionability  
Youre not crying this is blood all over me  
Youre not crying this is blood all over me  
Youre not crying this is blood all over me  
And Ill love you if you let me  
And Ill love you if you wont make me starve  
  
I used to hold your heart to neck  
I know Ill miss you if I close my eyes  
But this is loaded with an open film  
Ill see you and Ill blow your heart to pieces  
I will blow your heart to pieces  
I will blow your heart to pieces  
I will blow your heart to pieces  
And Ill love you if you let me  
And Ill love you if you wont make me starve  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
My pains not ashamed to repeat itself  
Pains not ashamed to repeat itself  
Pains not ashamed to repeat itself  
Pains not ashamed to repeat itself  
I cant sleep until I devour you  
I cant sleep until I devour you  
I cant sleep until I devour you  
I cant sleep until I devour you  
I cant sleep until I devour you  
And Ill love you if you let me  
And Ill love you if you wont make me starve
