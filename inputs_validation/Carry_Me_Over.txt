Theres a tavern up on the roadside I must be coming into town  
The moon must be in Aries because the truck aint slowing down  
Pulled back on the throttle Ive been doing that all day  
Looking ahead for a righthand turn to carry me away  
Theres times for understanding it dont seem like one of those  
The times are too demanding when youre hanging by your nose  
So why dont you just get out of here and leave me here to pray  
That one of these mornings the suns going to rise and carry me away  
Carry me over the highway  
Carry me over the sky  
Carry me over the loneliness  
That Im feeling here tonight  
You know Im feeling just like a riptide and Im feeling a little scared  
A twisted maze of old highways nobody has repaired  
It aint nothing that cant be handled like an actor in a play  
Who becomes enraged jumps from the stage and gets a little carried away  
Now all of your highways dont mean much to me no more  
Ive been on all of your highway roads of that you can be sure  
But I still get lost on all of them roads I cant seems to find my way  
I know theres one out there somewhere to carry me away  
Carry me over the highway  
Carry me over the sky  
Carry me over the loneliness  
That Im feeling here tonight
