You sat me down beside myself  
To show me all the reasons I was wrong for you  
Was this for real its hard to tell  
Cause it was such a beautiful mess we had got into  
  
Im gonna overcome this  
Paper hearts cant win this time  
And all along I should have know this  
It wasnt your dream it was mine  
I know you wanted me to give up this life to be  
Everything I was back when you had the hands my heart was in  
I was never good at goodbye  
  
Can I swallow this bottle whole  
So this brain in my head can forget your face  
  
When we were starting out  
You believed in me without a doubt  
You were the finest thing that happened to a boy like me  
Its so much harder now  
I want to try and tell you how  
There is so much love in me  
Even though its hard to see  
And I was never good at goodbye  
  
Can I swallow this bottle whole  
So this brain in my head can forget your face  
Can I swallow this bottle whole  
Cause Id rather be dead than make more mistakes  
  
Today I couldnt stay awake  
Feels like Im drowning in this firewater lake  
I wont be sleeping much tonight  
Its not the same without you lying by my side  
Right beside me  
  
Can I swallow this bottle whole  
So this brain in my head can forget your face  
Can I swallow this bottle whole  
Cause Id rather be dead than make more mistakes  
  
I know you wanted me  
To give up my heart to be everything I am  
And youre the only thing that I can see  
Im sorry but youre not the only one for me  
  
You left me here beside myself  
Left me with all the reasons I was wrong for you
