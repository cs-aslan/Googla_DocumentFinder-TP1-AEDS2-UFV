I was born my mothers son  
When I hit the ground I was on the run  
All my life Ive played the fool  
Ive been breaking hearts and breaking rules  
  
I cant change my evil ways  
You cant change my evil ways  
No matter what the good book says  
I cant change my evil ways  
No more no more evil ways my evil ways  
  
Ive been accused of hit and run  
But all the same I had my fun  
Dont turn your back when Im with you  
Cause Ill steal your chickens and your sister too  
  
I cant change my evil ways  
You cant change my evil ways  
No matter what the good book says  
I cant change my evil ways  
No more no more evil ways my evil ways  
  
I was born my mothers son  
Since I could crawl I been having fun  
Now Ive been poor and Ive been rich  
But Ive always been a son of a bitch  
  
I cant change my evil ways  
You cant change my evil ways  
No matter what the good book says  
I cant change my evil ways  
No more no more evil ways my evil ways  
  
My evil ways evil ways  
Evil ways evil ways
