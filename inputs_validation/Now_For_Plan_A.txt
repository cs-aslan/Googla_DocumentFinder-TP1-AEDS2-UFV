Yeah I know I know I know  
Its still not enough  
Nothing short of everything  
Nothing short of everythings enough  
No matter how wide or how tough  
Nothing short of everythings enough  
  
Yeah I know I know I know  
Now for plan A  
Ill stay till the wisteria fades  
And falls on LA  
No matter how high or how rough  
Nothing short of everythings enough  
  
In your face the endless patience  
The fleeting nature of life on display  
And nothing short of everything  
Nothing short of everything  
Ill stay till the wisteria fades  
The way it falls all over LA  
Nothing short of everything  
Nothing short of everything  
Nothing short of everything  
Nothing short of everything  
Nothing short of everything  
No matter how wide or how rough  
Nothing short of everything  
Nothing short of everything  
Nothing short of everythings enough  
Nothing short of everything  
Nothing short of everything  
Nothing short of everything  
Nothing short of everything
