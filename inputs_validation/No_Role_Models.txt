First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil  
For real you the only father that I ever knew  
I get my bitch pregnant Ima be a better you  
Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville  
For Phil Listen even back when we was broke my team ill  
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville  
Talk to a nigga  
  
One time for my LA sisters  
One time for my LA hoes  
Lame niggas cant tell the difference  
One time for a nigga who knows

No role models and Im here right now  
No role models to speak of  
Searchin through my memory my memory  
I couldnt find one  
Last night I was gettin my feet rubbed  
By the baddest bitch not Trina but I swear to God  
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her Hey whats good  
Sorry Im never comin home Ima stay for good  
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood  
I came fast like 911 in white neighborhoods  
Aint got no shame bout it  
She think Im spoiled and Im rich cause I can have any bitch  
I got defensive and said Nah I was the same without it  
But then I thought back back to a better me  
Before I was a Blist celebrity  
Before I started callin bitches bitches so heavily  
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody  
You wasnt sweatin me

That Jada and that Will love  
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love  
And you aint gotta wonder whether thats your kid love  
Nigga I dont want no bitch from reality shows  
Out of touch with reality hoes  
Out in Hollywood bringin back 5 or 6 hoes  
Fuck em then we kick em to the door

Theres an old saying in Tennessee  I know its in Texas  probably in
Tennessee that says fool me once shame on  shame on you  
If you fool me we cant get fooled again  
  
Fool me one time shame on you  
Fool me twice cant put the blame on you  
Fool me three times fuck the peace signs  
Load the chopper let it rain on you  
x2  
  
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet  
My only regret was too young for Nia Long  
Now all Im left with is hoes from reality shows  
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldnt read along  
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu  
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home  
Now all Im left with is hoes up in Greystone  
With the stale face cause they know its they song  
She shallow but the pussy deep she shallow she shallow  
She shallow but the pussy deep she shallow she shallow  
She shallow but the pussy deep she shallow she shallow
