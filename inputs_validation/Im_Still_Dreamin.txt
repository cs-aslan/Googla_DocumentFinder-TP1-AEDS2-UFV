I know people who lose their lover turn around and they find another  
Fall in love and then they break up I dont know if I want to wake up  
Cause Im still dreamin Im still dreamin baby  
Im still dreamin oh oh oh about you  
Other women walk right up to me I hear them talking but it goes right through
me  
I know its love thats on the line but they dont know whats on my mind  
Cause Im still dreamin  
Its like a voice thats always calling its like a feelin that Im always
falling  
I close my eyes and all I see is you you you  
Cause Im still dreamin  
Im still dreamin
