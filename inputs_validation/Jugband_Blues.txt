Its awfully considerate of you to think of me here  
And Im much obliged to you for making it clear  
That Im not here  
And I never knew we could be so big  
And I never knew the moon could be so blue  
And Im grateful that you threw away my old shoes  
And brought me here instead dressed in red  
And Im wondering who could be writing this song  
  
I dont care if the sun dont shine  
And I dont care if nothing is mine  
And I dont care if Im nervous with you  
Ill do my loving in the winter  
  
And the sea isnt green  
And I love the queen  
And what exactly is a dream  
And what exactly is a joke
