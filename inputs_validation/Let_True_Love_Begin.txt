When youre young  
Youre afraid of the dark  
Then you grow up  
Unafraid of the dark  
  
So darling when I kiss you  
And your heart goes in a spin  
Dont be afraid  
Let true love begin  
  
Oh when youre alone  
Youre afraid that its true  
Love wont come  
It wont hapoen to you  
  
So to let this chance  
For happiness go by  
Would be a sin  
Dont be afraid  
Let true love begin  
  
I know the feeling  
That youre feeling is new  
And your heart still  
Wants to hide  
  
This feeling that  
Sends you reeling  
Im feeling too  
Its love it cannot be denied  
  
So take my hand  
Ill always be at your side  
Theres no need  
For you to hide  
  
So listen to your heart thats  
Telling you from deep within  
Dont be afraid  
Let true love begin  
  
Dont be afraid  
Let true love begin  
Dont be afraid  
Let true love begin
