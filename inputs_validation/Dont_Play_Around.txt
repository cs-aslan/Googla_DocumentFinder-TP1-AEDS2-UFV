He stuck that knife right into her gut  
I want to tell you she was lucky with what she got  
But what she got was not enough  
She played around  
  
Dont play around  
I tried to tell her he was not so dumb  
I tried to warn her there was something wrong  
She wouldnt listen she continued on  
She played around  
  
If you give your love to someone and someone treats you bad  
If you give your love to someone and someone makes you mad  
If you give your love to someone it can be so sad  
  
Dont play around  
Dont play around  
  
He left her dying in the pool of blood  
And she was crying oh my god oh my god  
But she was no good she was no good  
She played around  
  
Dont play around  
Shed be laughing and dancing the night away  
Shed be laughing and dancing with every man that came away  
But as her lifes blood slipped away  
I thought i heard her say  
Dont play around  
Dont play around
