Loose lips on ships  
Im getting to grips  
With what you said  
No its not in my head  
I cant awaken the dead  
Day after day  
  
Why dont we talk about it  
Why do you always doubt that there can be a better way  
It doesnt make me want to stay  
  
Chorus  
Why dont we break up  
Theres nothing left to say  
I got my eye shut praying they wont stray  
Oh When I sexed up  
Thats what makes the difference today  
I hope you blow away  
  
You said were fatally flawed  
When Im easily bored Is that okay  
Write me off your list  
Make this the last kiss  
Ill walk away  
  
Why dont we talk about it  
Im only here  
Dont shout it  
Given time well forget  
Lets pretend we never met  
  
Chorus  
  
Screw you I didnt like your taste  
Anyway I chose you  
And thats all gone to wasted  
Saturday Ill go out and find another you  
  
Why dont we Why dont we break up  
Theres nothing left to say  
I got my eye shut praying they wont stray  
Oh When I sexed up  
Thats what makes the difference today  
I hope you blow away
