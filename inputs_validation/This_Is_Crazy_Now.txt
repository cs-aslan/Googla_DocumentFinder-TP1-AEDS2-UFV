Blown away like the wind restless again  
My only friend has gone away  
Washed like the tide but Im still alive  
Im gonna drive all night long  
  
This is crazy now Ill fill the space somehow  
  
If there were someway to get through  
This is crazy now Ill fill the space somehow  
I cant walk away from you  
  
Shaken like a leave sharpened like a reef  
All of my senses need relief  
Looking out to sea I still believe  
That you and I were meant to be  
  
This is crazy now Ill fill the space somehow  
If there were someway to get through  
This is crazy now like a finger paint  
Fill the space somehow smearing in the rain  
I cant walk away from you wash it all away  
  
This is crazy now shaken like a leave  
Ill fill the space somehow Sharpened like a reef  
I cant walk away from you  
  
This is crazy now  
Shaken like a leaf  
Fill the space somehow  
Sharpened like a reef  
I cant walk away from you
