My baby left me  
She wouldnt tell a lie  
Cause she said she would she did  
And she left me high and dry  
My baby left me  
Last night I heard her cry  
She wouldnt tell me why  
She just said byebye  
  
I used to sing the blues  
I thought I sang for real  
Now I know the feel  
And it hurts too much  
My baby left me  
She left me all alone  
Shes never coming home  
And I want to die  
  
My baby left me my baby left me
