Give me one kiss one kiss thats what I want from you  
I just want to kiss your lips thats what I want to do  
Eleventhirty the lights are low  
Just one more kiss dear before I go  
Give me one kiss one kiss thats what I want from you  
  
Ill hold you closer at your front door  
We may have time left for three or four  
Give me one kiss one kiss thats what I want from you  
Ah come on just one little kiss
