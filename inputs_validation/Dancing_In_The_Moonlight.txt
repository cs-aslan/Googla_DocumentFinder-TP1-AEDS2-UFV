When I passed you in the doorway  
You took me with a glance  
I should have took that last bus home  
But I asked you for a dance  
  
Now we go steady to the pictures  
I always get chocolate stains on my pants  
My father hes going crazy  
Says Im living in a trance  
  
But Im dancing in the moonlight  
Its caught me in its spotlight  
Its alright alright  
Dancing in the moonlight  
On the long hot summer night  
  
Its three oclock in the morning  
And Im on the streets again  
I disobeyed another warning  
I should have been in by ten  
  
Now I wont get out until Sunday  
Ill have to say I stayed with friends  
But its a habit worth forming  
If it means to justify the end
