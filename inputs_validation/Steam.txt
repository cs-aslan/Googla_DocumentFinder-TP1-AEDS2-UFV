Stand back  
Stand back  
  
What are those dogs doing sniffing at my feet  
Theyre on to something picking up  
Picking up this heat this heat  
  
Chorus 1  
Give me steam  
And how you feel to make it real  
Real as anything youve seen  
Get a life with this dreamers dream  
  
You know your culture from your trash  
You know your plastic from your cash  
When I lose sight of the track  
You know the way back  
But I know you  
  
You know your stripper from your paint  
You know your sinner from your saint  
Whenever heavens doors are shut  
You kick them open but  
I know you  
  
Chorus 2  
Give me steam  
And how you feel to make it real  
Real as any place youve been  
Get a life with the dreamers dream  
  
Stand back  
Stand back  
Cant you see Ive lost control Im getting indiscreet  
Youre moving in so close til Im picking up  
Picking up this heat this heat  
  
Chorus 1  
  
You know your green from your red  
You know the quick from the dead  
So much better than the rest  
You think youve been blessed  
But I know you  
  
You know your ladder from your snake  
You know the throttle from the brake  
You know your straight line from a curve  
Youve got a lot of nerve  
But I know you  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Everybody nosedive  
Hold your breath count to five  
Backslap boobytrap  
Cover it up in bubble wrap  
Room shake earthquake  
Find a way to stay awake  
Its going to blow its going to break  
This is more than I can take  
  
Oh yeah I need steam  
Feel the steam all around me  
Ah youre turning up the heat  
When I start to dream aloud  
See you move your hands and feet  
Wont you step into this cloud of steam  
This steam  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Help me yeah  
Ready to steam out the log jam  
Stir crazy from the freezer to the boil  
Waters bubbling its bbbbubbling  
Bubbling Repeat x 4  
Like its coming to a boil  
Give me steam lady  
Give me steam around me now  
Ahh coming alive Repeat x 2  
Said give me some steam
