Colton Grundy  
Colton Grundy the Undying  
Im dead and lifeless  
The casket maker  
Soul taker your life is  
Priceless  
Especially on the black market  
If youre alive and breathing  
Then youre a moving target  
Which means you can be hit  
And the quickest lickity split  
Lay down in the ground  
Surrounded by a casket  
That I built  
Out of warped woods and drift wood  
Rusted railroad spikes  
Collected from the neighborhood  
Skilled in the family trade  
Im center stage  
In the most horrific side of me  
Youll ever see is like an instinct  
Some sort of nervous twitch  
Ill stack the bodies 10 high  
And bungee cord them to the trailer hitch  
Pulling dead weight  
Just made it over the border  
And out of state  
No time to debate  
Time is short and the day is only so long  
10 bodies put in the ground before dawn  
Chorus X2  
10 bodies put in the ground before dawn  
10 bodies put in the ground before dawn  
The moon is out and Im digging on it x2  
Colton Grundy  
Blaze Your Dead Homie  
The unliving Im dead and lifeless  
The clock bearer  
So terror the time is  
Precise when your body is separating from soul  
Thats where I take your life  
And transform you to a ghost  
And youre powerless  
Body limp like dead fish  
Only choose 10 never more  
Less cause that be selfish  
No headstones  
Just 10 open holes in grounds  
And dead bodies surround me  
Youre face down  
No garbage bags  
Not saying they trash  
Im just saying it preserves the body  
And makes it last  
For the future  
And the time the to come ahead  
Take it from the dead man  
Things are easy when youre dead  
Ill be back for you  
I left the shovel right beside you  
I hid you pretty good  
I dont think no ones gonna find you  
Time is short and the suns coming along  
I left the burial site before dawn  
Chorus X2  
I left the burial site before dawn  
I left the burial site before dawn  
The moon is out and Im digging on it x2  
Colton Grundy  
Am I the sand man  
The one that freed you or your ghost  
Or the mad man  
The one that slitining your throat  
Tonights the night  
10 more coming to join you  
Ill make it interesting  
I would never disappoint you  
Theres 30 of yall all  
Together and collected  
And this here chunk of the Earth  
That weve infected  
And now youre expecting them to grow  
Into the millions  
Unless they find a way to capture apprehend  
And kill me  
Unless they find a way to capture apprehend and kill me  
Unless they find a way to capture apprehend and kill me  
The moon is out and Im digging on it x2  
I left the burial site before dawn  
I left the burial site before dawn  
The moon is out and Im digging on it x2  
Chorus X2  
10 bodies put in the ground before dawn  
10 bodies put in the ground before dawn  
The moon is out and Im digging on it
