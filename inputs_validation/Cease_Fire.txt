In glory a soldier I stand til the end  
A golden revolver I hold in my hand  
The trigger that I never squeeze  
The war that brings me to my knees  
  
Im tired of fighting for peace  
When I am alone on the front line  
I need you to stand next to me  
  
Baby ceasefire fire fire  
Throw down your weapons your weapons your weapons  
Im on your side on your side on your side  
So please ceasefire fire fire  
Ceasefire make it stop  
  
Drop down your defenses Im raising my flag  
This fighting is hopeless we need this to end  
Its going too far dont know where it began  
Were hurting each other and I cant pretend  
  
Im trying to help you to see  
The casualties that we both lead  
Its all so unnecessary  
Cant you hear me scream  
  
Baby ceasefire fire fire  
Throw down your weapons your weapons your weapons  
Im on your side on your side on your side  
So please ceasefire fire fire  
Ceasefire make it stop  
  
Uh uh uh ooh  
Uh uh uh ooh  
Uh uh ooh  
Uh uh ooh  
  
Rolling out  
White flag  
I surrender  
Screaming out  
Make it stop  
We can do better  
  
Pain and hurt  
Living in fear  
Wasted energy  
In the end  
What is it worth  
What is our legacy  
  
Rolling out  
White flag  
I surrender  
Screaming out  
Make it stop  
We can do better  
  
Pain and hurt  
Living in fear  
Wasted energy  
In the end  
What is it worth  
What is our legacy  
  
Follow me now  
Im gonna announce  
Somebody help me  
I need you now  
Why cant you see  
Gotta believe me  
Fighting for peace  
Here release  
Wont you remove me  
Im on your side  
Swallow your pride  
You can confide in me  
Army afoot  
Rise of the sun  
Shining for all to see  
Enemys left  
Victorys won  
No negativity  
We can be free  
Free as the king  
Who won my destiny  
  
Baby ceasefire fire fire  
Throw down your weapons your weapons your weapons  
Im on your side on your side on your side  
So please ceasefire fire fire  
Ceasefire make it stop
