You toke your love awayto fast  
Left no chance to saylook back  
And know I no the truth it makes it easier  
Maybe when time goes byIll Understand  
  
Chorus  
Lets pretend that I moved on  
Then ill tell myself that life goes on without you  
Open My eyes  
Look deep inside  
I run awayI runawayI runaway  
  
You throw it all awaySo blindso blind  
Pushed me far from you in your lifelife  
And now I no the tears wont lead to lonleyness  
Maybe when time goes by Ill understand  
  
Chorus  
Lets pretend that I moved on  
Then ill tell myselfthat life goes on without you  
Open My eyes  
Look deep inside  
I run awayI runawayI runaway  
  
I run away  
I run away  
I run away  
  
Chorus  
Lets pretend that I moved on  
Then ill tell myselfthat life goes on without you  
Open My eyes  
Look deep inside  
I run awayI runawayI runaway  
  
Lets pretend that I moved on  
Tell myselfthat life goes on without you  
Open My eyes  
Look deep inside  
I runawayI run awayI runaway
