Oh darling why dyou talk so fast  
Another evening just flew past tonight  
And now the daybreaks coming in  
And I cant win and it aint right  
You tell me all youve done and seen  
And all the places you have been without me  
Well I dont really want to know  
But ill stay quiet and then ill go  
And you wont have no cause to think about me  
  
Theres a guy works down the chip shop swears hes elvis  
Just like you swore to me that youd be true  
Theres a guy works down the chip shop swears hes elvis  
But hes a liar and Im not sure about you  
  
Oh darling youre so popular  
You were the best thing new in hicksville  
With your mohair suits and foreign shoes  
Lou says you changed your pickup for a seville  
And now Im lying here alone  
cause youre out there on the phone to some star in new york  
I can hear you laughing now  
And I cant help feeling that somehow  
You dont mean anything you say at all  
  
Theres a guy works down the chip shop swears hes elvis  
Just like you swore to me that youd be true  
Theres a guy works down the chip shop swears hes elvis  
But hes a liar and Im not sure about you  
  
Theres a guy works down the chip shop swears hes elvis  
Just like you swore to me that youd be true  
Theres a guy works down the chip shop swears hes elvis  
But hes a liar and Im not sure about you  
I said hes a liar and Im not sure about you  
I said hes a liar and Im not sure about you  
I said hes a liar and Im not sure about you
