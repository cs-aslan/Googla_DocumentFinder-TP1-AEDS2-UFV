You ask me to live here with you  
If I could love you know I would  
I cant give you my heart or my hand though you want it  
I cant give you the love I know I should  
And I tell you theres nobody else  
Its not you Im just afraid  
Will you show me the way  
So Im sure that I love you  
Show me how true love is made  
If I could I would give you my heart and my hand  
Id give you the sea Id give you the land  
If I found love to give you  
I would give you my life mmm mmm mmm ooh hoo hoo mmm  
In my sorrow Ive called out your name  
In my dreams Ive known only you  
Is this love that I feel  
Am I foolin myself when I wish for my dreams to come true  
If I could I would give you my heart and my hand  
Id give you the sea Id give you the land  
If I found love to give you  
Id give you my life mmm mmm mmm ooh hoo hoo mmm  
All the pain on my life would be gone  
Oh my love if you only knew  
Youd be kissin away all the tears of my joy  
When you ask me to live here with you
