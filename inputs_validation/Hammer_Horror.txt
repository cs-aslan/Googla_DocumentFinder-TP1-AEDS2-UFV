You stood in the belltower  
But now youre gone  
So who knows all the sights  
Of Notre Dame  
  
Theyve got the stars for the gallant hearts  
Im the replacement for your part  
But all I want to do is forget  
You friend  
  
Hammer Horror Hammer Horror  
Wont leave me alone  
The first time in my life  
I leave the lights on  
To ease my soul  
Hammer Horror Hammer Horror  
Wont leave it alone  
I dont know  
Is this the right thing to do  
  
Rehearsing in your things  
I feel guilty  
And retracing all the scenes  
Of your big hit  
Oh God you needed the leading role  
It wasnt me who made you go though  
Now all I want to do is forget  
You friend  
  
Hammer Horror Hammer Horror  
Wont leave me alone  
The first time in my life  
I leave the lights on  
To ease my soul  
Hammer Horror Hammer Horror  
Wont leave it alone  
I dont know  
Is this the right thing to do  
  
Who calls me from the other side  
Of the street  
And who taps me on the shoulder  
I turn around but youre gone
