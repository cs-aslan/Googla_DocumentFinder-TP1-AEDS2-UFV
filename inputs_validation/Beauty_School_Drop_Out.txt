Your storys sad to tell a teenage neerdowell  
Most mixed up nondelinquent on the block  
Your futures so unclear now whats left of your career now  
Cant even get a tradein on your smile  
  
Beauty school dropout no graduation day for you  
Beauty school dropout missed your midterms and flunked shampoo  
Well at least you could have taken time to wash and clean your clothes up  
After spending all that dough to have the doctor fix your nose up  
  
Baby get moving better get moving why keep your feeble hopes alive  
What are you proving what are you proving  
Youve got the dream but not the drive  
If you go for your diploma you could join a steno pool  
Turn in your teasin comb and go back to highschool  
  
Beauty school dropout hangin around the corner store  
Beauty school dropout its about time you knew the score  
Well they couldnt teach you anything you think youre such a looker  
But no customer would go to you unless she was a hooker  
  
Baby dont sweat it dont sweat it youre not cut out to hold the job  
Better forget it forget it who wants their hair done by a slob  
Now your bangs are curled your lashes twirled and still the world iscruel  
Wipe off that angel face and go back to highschool  
  
Baby dont blow it dont put my good advice to shame  
Baby you know it even Dear Abbys say the same  
Now Ive called the shot get off the pot I really gotta fly  
Gotta be goin to that maltshop in the sky  
  
Beauty school dropout go back to highschool  
Beauty school dropout go back to highschool  
Beauty school dropout go back to highschool
