Lyricsbosson music bosson deeno  
Its funny how some things turn out  
Were playing at the backyard wondering  
How our life would be  
The boys were always teasing me  
The time we had together the difference  
You were a friend to me  
I never thought you wanted more than that  
You tore me apart my love  
I never thought that I was good enough  
So now that I know I want to say  
Chorus  
You will always be on my mind  
You will always be there throughout the rest  
Of my life oh baby x2  
We never knew the reason then no  
I was talking to your boyfriend wondering  
bout my ache inside  
Youre always coming back to me yeah  
When times were getting rough and you needed  
Some love from a friend you trust  
I never thought you wanted more than that  
You tore me apart my love  
I never thought that I was good enough  
So now that I know I want to say  
Chorus  
I never thought  
Chorus
