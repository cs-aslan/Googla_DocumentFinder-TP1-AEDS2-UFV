My hands are cold  
My bodys numb  
Im still in shock  
What have you done  
My head is pounding  
My visions blurred  
Your mouth is moving  
I dont hear a word  
  
And it hurts so bad  
That I search my skin  
For the entry point  
When love went in  
And ricocheted  
And bounced around  
And left a hole when you walked out yeah  
  
Im falling through the doors of the emergency room  
Can anybody help me with these exit wounds  
I dont know how much more love this heart can lose  
And Im dying dying from these exit wounds  
Wounds when theyre leaving the scars youre keeping  
Exit wounds when theyre leaving the scars youre keeping  
  
Marks a battle  
Still feel raw  
A million pieces of me  
On the floor  
Im damaged goods  
For all to see  
Now who would ever want to be with me  
  
Ive got all the baggage  
Drink the pills  
Yeah this is living but without the will  
Im blacking out  
Im shutting down  
Youve left a hole  
When you walked out yeah  
  
Im falling through the doors of the emergency room  
Can anybody help me with these exit wounds  
I dont know how much more love this heart can lose  
And Im dying dying from these exit wounds  
Wounds when theyre leaving the scars youre keeping  
Exit wounds  
When theyre leaving the scars youre keeping yeah  
  
Lose your clothes and show your scars  
Thats who you are  
Lose your clothes and show your scars  
Thats who you are  
Lose your clothes and show your scars  
Thats who you are  
Lose your clothes and show your scars  
  
Marks a battle  
Still feel raw  
A million pieces of me  
On the floor  
  
Im falling through the doors of the emergency room  
Can anybody help me with these exit wounds  
I dont know how much more love this heart can lose  
And Im dying dying from these exit wounds  
Wounds when theyre leaving the scars youre keeping  
Exit wounds  
When theyre leaving the scars youre keeping
