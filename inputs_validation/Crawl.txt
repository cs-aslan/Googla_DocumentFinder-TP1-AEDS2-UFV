Your love does something to me that I cant describe  
Dark eyes see right through me and I just cant hide  
You drive me crazy with what you dont say and the way you hold back love  
Tell me tell me wont you please please tell me  
Need an answer from above  
There you are Youre my desire and here I am  
Id be a liar if I said  
  
Chorus  
I aint gonna crawl  
You aint gonna nail my heart to the wall  
You aint gonna find me crying like a child just asking for it all  
I aint gonna beg Id rather lose it all instead  
If that is what it takes to get you Part of me just might let you  
For someone like you Id do more than fall  
I just might crawl  
  
Seems like I get this feelin this time of night  
Head down senses reeling something just aint right  
Imagination locked up inside and its got nowhere to go  
I see my lover through anothers eyes  
And its killing me to know the truth  
Like playing with fire To lose you  
Id be a liar if I said  
  
Chorus x2
