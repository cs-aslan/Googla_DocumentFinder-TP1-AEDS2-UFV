I speak from some sort of protection of learning  
Even tho I make it up as I go on  
A special trait is that Ive tried  
To reach all feelings  
So I speak a new language of love  
  
Some say that it is written in the circle  
Others that it is written in the sun  
But I protect myself by seeing this experience  
As a metaphor for moving on  
  
Sometimes I check myself  
To start to believe in  
The horoscopes you read everyday  
Theyre telling me somethings  
I really ought to know  
But then again I like to  
Then again I learn to  
Then again Im running away  
  
Vision is coming so fast I cant stop myself  
Vision forgets who is real  
On the city streets people get lost  
Just waiting for history  
Pushing the real world away  
  
Taking a chance only once in your life  
Only weakness can stop you from hearing  
New languages  
Translate each word  
As they bring you creation  
Your voice is the perfect key  
  
Is there something that  
Im supposed to see  
  
Is there something that Im  
Supposed to feel  
Im with you  
And I cant help but want to know  
  
Talk to me  
Is there something that Im supposed to teach  
Speak to me  
Is there something that Im supposed to find  
As I reach to the healing in each spoken word  
  
For some strange reason time just cannot wait a minute  
Im chasing every second before I let go  
Yesterday my history  
Dreams are still a mystery  
This living is a gift I should know  
  
Lay it down and let me live the new language  
Let me learn at every twist every turn  
Lay it down and let me love the further future  
Let me know Im running  
Let me know Im learning  
Let me know Im moving on  
  
Vision is racing so fast I cant stop myself  
Chasing the reason  
For all kinds of wondering  
People embracing these feelings of limbo  
Just waiting for some kind of truth  
  
Taking a chance as it comes only once  
Only strength can do justice  
With words of new languages  
Translate creation  
To bring you salvation  
Your voice is the perfect key  
  
Talk to me  
Is there something that  
Im supposed to see  
Speak to me  
Is there something that Im  
Supposed to feel  
Im with you  
And I cant help but want to know  
New languages  
  
Talk to me  
Is there something that  
Im supposed to teach

As I reach to the healing of each spoken word new languages
