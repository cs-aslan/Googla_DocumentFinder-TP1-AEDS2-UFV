I got a letter from my love It said exactly what Im thinking of  
no words can say Well darling Ill find away  
You see your diamond ring I here to say that doesnt mean a thing  
Without your love And if thats all we got then take it off take it off  
  
Swear your love say you dont need no diamond baby  
If some piece of papers keepin us together I aint buyin it baby  
Swear your love all your really got after its said and done  
is what you tell each other when its one on one  
Darlin wont you swear your love  
  
I know a lady in spokane She thought that happiness would find her when she  
caught a man security secondhand  
She got her diamond ring Its sad to say that was the only thing  
I guess she forgot you gotta believe enough to swear your love  
  
Swear your love say yourre with me forever baby  
No legal paper pressure from your friends will ever keep us together  
Swear your love thats the way to hold on babe  
Promise me youll be my only lady Darling wont you swear your love  
  
This aint no ticket out  Is that what you think our love is about  
Think twice before you call Girl get it straight or dont get it at all  
Swear your love swear you love
