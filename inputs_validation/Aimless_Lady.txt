Aimless lady is this your home town  
Tell me baby tell me where youre bound  
When our eyes met you were in the very first row  
I couldnt even guess your name but I just had to know  
  
You were meant for me would you grab your coat and flee  
You were a mystery but you just had to be  
An aimless lady  
Aimless lady  
Aimless lady  
  
Should I try and satisfy you lady  
Aint no lie now well get by my baby  
If you can stand a real good man now lady  
Take my hand and understand me baby  
  
Take your time youre doing fine now lady  
You got yours and I got mine now baby  
Can you see the way to be now lady  
Stay with me and set me free now baby  
  
Aimless lady  
Aimless lady  
Aimless lady  
  
Youre mine aimless lady
