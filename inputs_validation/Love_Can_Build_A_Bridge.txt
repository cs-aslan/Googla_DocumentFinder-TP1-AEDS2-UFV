Id gladly walk across the desert  
With no shoes upon my feet  
To share with you the last bite of bread I had to eat  
I would swim back to save you  
In your sea of broken dreams  
When all your hopes are sinking  
Let me show you what love means  
  
Chorus  
Love can build a Bridge  
Between your heart and mine  
Love can build a Bridge  
Dont you think its time  
Dont you think its time  
  
I would whisper love so loudly  
Every heart could understand  
That love and only love  
Can join the tribes of man  
I would give my hearts desire  
So that you might see  
The first step is to realize  
That it all begins with you and me  
  
Chorus  
  
When we stand together  
Its our finest hour  
We can do anything anything  
Anything anything  
Keep believin in the power  
  
Chorus
