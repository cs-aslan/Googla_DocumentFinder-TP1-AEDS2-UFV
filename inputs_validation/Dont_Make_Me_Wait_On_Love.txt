duet with kenny G  
Sittin here just starin at your picture  
Waiting for your call  
So unclear Im hanging on a notion  
We could have it all  
Time and time again You tell me to be patient  
But we cant let love slip away  
  
Chorus  
Oh baby dont make me wait for love this time  
Oh darlin a love like this is hard to find  
Dont make me wait for love  
  
I close the blinds and try to hide the darkness  
Fall asleep alone  
Give me a sign a mans not suppose to face life  
Standing on his own  
When youre near me I cant help but see forever  
Come and rescue me tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh baby dont make me wait for love this time  
Oh darlin a love like this is hard to find  
Dont you see I need ya gotta have ya  
Oh baby dont make me wait for love this time  
Oh Oh darlin a love like this is hard to find  
Dont make me wait for love  
  
Oh baby dont make me wait  
Dont make me wait for love this time  
No No I need you right now I need you right now  
Oh darlin a love like this a love like this  
Is so very hard to find dont make me wait  
Dont make me wait for love
