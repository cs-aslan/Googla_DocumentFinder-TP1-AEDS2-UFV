On every corner of every avenue  
The words been passed all around  
Better watch out lock up your daughters  
Cause that bad Frankie lee is back in town  
All the ladies fall for Frankie  
Sayin Frankie Lee how can it be  
Of all the men here youre the only one  
Whos got the key to set us free  
Oh Frankie Lee  
Now theres a woman in this neighborhood  
Whos loving Frankie in her mind  
But in fear of bein discovered  
She keeps her secret locked up inside  
Just then a stones thrown up at the window  
And she looks below what does she see  
Theres a man there standing neath the streetlight  
It looks to be  
Like Frankie Lee  
Youd best believe  
Well old Frankie steals through the back door  
While her old man is leavin by the hall  
But before she hears his footsteps  
Frankies standing at the bedroom door  
So she holds him then she begs him  
Oh Frankie Lee dont cha ever leave  
And he tells her shes the only one  
Hes got the key  
That Frankie Lee  
To set her free  
Then as the moon fades into the night sky  
Frankie leaves while shes asleep  
Then hes up and out on the street again  
Hes got the key thatll set you free  
That Frankie Lee  
Every kid in this ol gang town

To set them free
