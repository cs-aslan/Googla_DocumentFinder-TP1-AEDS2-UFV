The keeper of the gates of wisdom  
Please let me in  
Cause I just cant go through  
Another heartache again  
Pretty lies and alibis  
How could I be so blind  
Now Im all alone and scared to stay  
Slowly going out of my mind  
  
He was my strongest weakness  
I surrendered heart and soul  
Its gonna be a long long time  
Til I regain control  
Im still a prisoner  
Held captive by his memory  
He was my strongest weakness  
And Im afraid hell always be  
  
I gave my faithful heart to someone  
I couldnt understand  
How he held my little world  
In the palm of his hand  
Now hes gone and life goes on  
So if this pain will ever end  
Will I be afraid to risk it all  
Ever fall in love again  
  
He was my strongest weakness  
I surrendered heart and soul  
Its gonna be a long long time  
Til I regain control  
Im still a prisoner  
Held captive by his memory  
He was my strongest weakness  
And Im afraid hell always be
