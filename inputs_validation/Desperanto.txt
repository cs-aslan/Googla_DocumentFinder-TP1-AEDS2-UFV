Desperanto spoken here  
Today I hear it everywhere  
It is the language of Despair  
Its in your nails and Its in your hair  
Its in your mouth instead of air  
Its in your house  
Its in your heart  
Its in your mind  
Its everywhere  
  
Its in your heart  
Its in your heart  
Its in your blood  
Its in your prayer  
Cmon baby get over here  
Its in your mouth  
  
In your mouth  
In your mouth  
In your mouth  
Its in your mouth instead of air  
Its in your breath  
Its in your blood  
Its in your heart  
Its in your blood  
Its in your heart

Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby now  
I know baby you dont care  
To speak in Desperanto here  
And I know youd never dare  
To speak the language of despair  
Cmon baby get over here

Broken darlin by Despair  
The rain it speaks  
The wind the air
