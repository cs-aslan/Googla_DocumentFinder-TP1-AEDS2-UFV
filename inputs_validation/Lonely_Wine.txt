The night is bright and gay but Im so blue  
My heart must have its way and dream of you  
Thats why I sigh and sip my lonely wine  
  
Your picture on the wall your smiling face  
Brings back the memory of your embrace  
I start to cry into my lonely wine  
  
Teardrops fall but all they bring is heartache  
Its better if I never think at all  
Still they soothe the pain my lonely thoughts make  
I never quite succeed in hiding all so let them fall  
  
Where ever you may be Ill still be true  
And when the clouds roll by Ill come to you  
But until then Ill drink my lonely wine
