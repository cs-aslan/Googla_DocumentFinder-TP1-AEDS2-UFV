Surely you know by now my heart is wild I dont want to be tied down it aint
my style  
Dont you think I know better world is kind of other too disselfish  
Well I cant help it Im destinys child  
I couldnt began to tell you if I try admit so much to love before a little
while  
  
Tried to remember all of the good love I wish you understood love  
I aint no good love Im destinys child destinys child destinys child  
  
I could be on my way now please dont cry  
Gotta be somewhere else I dont know why  
Keep thinkin of all Im losin I know your lipsre soothin  
I gotta be movin Im destinys child  
  
I must wish you well and say goodbye I wish you moons and stars and sunny
skies  
You gave me so much to believe in my life has a little more meanin  
Still Im leavin Im destinys child destinys child destinys child
