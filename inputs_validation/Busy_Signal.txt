Dolly Parton  
Busy signal  
Thats what I get when I call you  
Busy busy  
Talking to someone new  
I wish I knew  
I shouldnt worry cause its probably his mother  
Or then again it could even be his little brother  
On the line  
Making me lose my mind  
Hang up hang up hang up hang up  
Come on hang up hang up hang up  
Gotta talk to my baby  
Gotta tell him Im sorry  
Busy signal  
How can I tell him Im sorry  
When I said I didnt care  
I didnt mean a word I said  
Talking outta my head  
Ive got to reach him now and tell him that I love him  
And from now on Ill stay right by his side and love him  
All the time  
So please somebody quit tying up the line  
Hang up hang up hang up hang up  
Come on hang up hang up hang up  
Gotta talk to my baby  
Gotta tell him Im sorry  
I didnt mean to hurt you baby  
I really really love you baby
