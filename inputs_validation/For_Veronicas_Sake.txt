I got a name and number  
I got a bed assigned  
I got a dog in the city pound  
that I left behind  
Im strapped down and wild eyed  
shes locked up in a pen  
she needs somebody to feed her  
and im her only friend  
so for Veronicas sake  
I gotta get out of here  
yeah for Veronicas sake  
she can get pretty weird  
For Veronicas sake I gotta get myself out of here  
We both been put in cages  
we got our shots and tags  
I got my sweating fist to shake  
shes got her tail to wag  
she has to bark and whimper  
while I can scream and shout  
the clock above the psycho ward  
says time is running out  
so for Veronicas sake  
I gotta get out of here  
yeah for Veronicas sake  
she can get pretty weird  
For Veronicas sake I gotta get myself out of here  
And I can hear her howling all night  
at the lonely moon  
Theyre gonna give her the gas  
if I dont get there soon  
I gotta get there soon  
For Veronicas sake I gotta get out of here  
for Veronicas sake she can get pretty weird  
for Veronicas sake I gotta get out of here
