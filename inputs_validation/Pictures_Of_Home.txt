Somebodys shouting  
Up at a mountain  
Only my own words return  
Nobodys out there  
Its a deception  
When will I ever learn  
  
Im alone here  
With emptiness eagles and snow  
Unfriendliness chilling my body  
And whispering pictures of home  
  
Wondering blindly  
How can they find me  
Maybe they dont even know  
My body is shaking  
Anticipating  
The call of the black footed crow  
  
Im alone here  
With emptiness eagles and snow  
Unfriendliness chilling my body  
And taunting with pictures of home  
  
Here in this prison  
Of my own making  
Year after day I have grown  
Into a hero  
But theres no worship  
Where have they hidden my throne  
  
Im alone here  
With emptiness eagles and snow  
Unfriendliness chilling my body  
And screaming out pictures of home
