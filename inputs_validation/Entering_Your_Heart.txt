I came in crawling  
With an absentminded smile  
I had so many things untied that summer night  
When I decided it was worth another try  
Entering your heart ohh yeah  
Close your eyes  
Dont say a word  
All your thoughts must go unheard  
And i  
Have failed so many times  
Entering your mind  
Entering your mind  
Im not the most important one under the sun  
I dont have any power connections to the pentagon  
But Ive got something of my own that must get done  
Entering you heart  
Ohhh entering your heart  
Close your eyes  
Dont tell a soul  
All you dreams must be told  
And i  
Have failed so many times  
Entering you mind  
Entering you mind  
Ohhh  
Ohhh  
I  
Have failed so many times  
Entering your mind  
Entering your mind  
Ohhh entering you heart  
Woah entering you heart
