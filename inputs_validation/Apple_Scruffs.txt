Now Ive watched you sitting there  
Seen the passersby all stare  
Like you have no place to go  
But theres so much they dont know about Apple Scruffs  
  
Youve been stood around for years  
Seen my smiles and touched my tears  
How its been a long long time  
And how youve been on my mind my Apple Scruffs  
  
Apple Scruffs Apple Scruffs  
How I love you how I love you  
  
In the fog and in the rain  
Through the pleasures and the pain  
On the step outside you stand  
With your flowers in your hand my Apple Scruffs  
  
While the years they come and go  
Now your love must surely show me  
That beyond all time and space  
Were together face to face my Apple Scruffs  
  
Apple Scruffs Apple Scruffs  
How I love you how I love you
