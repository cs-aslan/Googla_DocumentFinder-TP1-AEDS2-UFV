Father I killed my monkey  
I let it out  
To taste the sweet of spring  
Wonder if I will wander out  
Test my tether to  
See if Im still free  
From you  
Steady as it comes  
Right down  
To you  
Ive said it all  
So maybe were a bliss  
Of another kind  
Lately Im in to circuitry  
What it means to be  
Made of you but not enough of you  
And I wonder if  
You can bilocate is that what I taste  
Your supernova juice  
You know its true Im part of you  
Steady as it comes  
Right down to you  
Ive said it all  
So maybe youre a four horse engine  
With a power drive  
A hot kachina who wants into mine  
Take it with your terracide  
Were a bliss  
Of another kind
