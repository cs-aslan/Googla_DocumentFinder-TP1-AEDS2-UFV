Dont get so busy that you miss  
Giving just a little kiss  
To the ones you love  
Dont even wait a little while  
To give them a little smile  
A little is enough  
  
How many people are crying  
People are dying  
How many people are asking for love  
  
Dont save it all for Christmas Day  
Find a way  
To give a little love everyday  
Dont save it all for Christmas Day  
Find your way  
Cause holidays have come and gone  
But love lives on  
If you give on  
Love  
  
How could you wait another minute  
A hug is warmer when youre in it  
And Baby thats a fact  
And saying I love yous always better  
Seasons reasons they dont matter  
So dont hold back  
  
How many people in this world  
So needful in this world  
How many people are praying for love  
  
Dont save it all for Christmas Day  
Find a way  
To give a little love everyday  
Dont save it all for Christmas Day  
Find your way  
Cause holidays have come and gone  
But love lives on  
If you give on  
Love  
  
Let all the children know  
Everywhere that they go  
Their whole life long  
Let them know love  
  
Dont save it all for Christmas Day  
Find a way  
To give a little love everyday  
Dont save it all for Christmas Day  
Find your way  
Cause holidays have come and gone  
But love lives on  
If you give on  
Love  
Love
