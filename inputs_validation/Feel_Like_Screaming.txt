Why do I live in the past and why should it hurt me to ask  
If someone can hear Im standing right here  
But this talking aloud cannot last  
  
Ive never been one full of words  
Its much better to hide in a smile  
With nothing to say Id just walk away  
Disappear to my room and shake my fists  
Think things over and stare into the wall  
  
And all this time I feel like screaming  
Turn that key let me out let me out  
Let me hold onto someone  
Let me out let me out  
Let me hold onto someone  
  
Inside its so easy to breathe but never so easy to leave  
And just when I try the fence gets too high  
So I sleep with my head on my sleeve  
  
And I dream of us flying away to a place that is out of the way  
And theres somebody there who says I dont care  
Who you are where youre from what you need  
Or what youre thinking we love you anyway
