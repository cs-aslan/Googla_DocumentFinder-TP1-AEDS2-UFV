You have loved lots of girls in the sweet longago  
And each has meant heaven to you  
You have vowed your affection to each one in turn  
And have sworn to them all youd be true  
You have kissed neath the moon while the world seemed in tune  
Then youve left her to hunt a new game  
Does it ever occur to you later my boy that shes probably doing the same  
  
If you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue  
Just imagine the girl you love best  
In the arms of some fellow whos stealing a kiss  
From the lips that you once fondly pressed  
But the world moves apace and the loves of today  
Flit away with a smile and a tear  
So you can never tell whos kissing her now  
Or just whom youll be kissing next year  
  
I wonder whos kissing her now I wonder whos teaching her how  
I wonder whos looking into her eyes breathing sighs telling lies  
I wonder whos buying the wine for lips that I used to call mine  
I wonder if she ever tells him of me I wonder whos kissing her now
