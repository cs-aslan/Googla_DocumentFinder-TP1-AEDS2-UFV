Guess Ive been bad all my life  
Yeah Ive sinned  bad all the time  
I should have never learned  
To play with fire  Oh no no  
  
I got my front seat in hell  
That my momma said I would get  
And all us dirty devils there  
Are high tonight  
  
Yeah I know that I should have learned  
If ya play with fire ya burn  
No deposit no return  
On my life  
  
Oh but theres a party down in flames  
And I got no time to waste  
No I aint feeling no pain  
Too high to die  
  
Oh Im getting  high on the flames  
Oh Im gonna  ride on the flames  
Oh Im getting  high on the flames  
Oh tonight  
Too high to die
