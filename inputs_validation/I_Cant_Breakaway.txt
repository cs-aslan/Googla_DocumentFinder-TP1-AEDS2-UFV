I cant break away from you  
Ooh theres something  
About you that I cant explain  
I get excited when I hear your name  
I cant break away from you  
  
Deep in my mind youre always here  
Whenever I turn youre always near  
Oh just cant just cant just cant  
Ive only known you for a little while  
Yet I can truly say I dig your style  
Even the way you call my name  
  
It sounds like a song the angels sang  
Just being near you gives me satisfaction  
I tell you its some new kind of action  
Your love I could never ever turn away  
Why dont you hear me when I try to say  
I cant break away from you  
  
Youre like a mirror in the back of my mind  
I see reflections of you all the time  
I cant break away from you  
Deep in my mind youre always there  
You stay around me everywhere

We have a different style of love  
Different So different and so new  
We have a crazy kind of love So crazy  
Crazy yes its true  
And Im gonna never turn away  
  
Oh do you hear what I say  
I cant break away from you  
Youre like a mirror in the back of my mind  
I see reflections of you all the time

Deep in my mind youre always there  
Whenever I turn youre always here  
Oh you cant never get away from you
