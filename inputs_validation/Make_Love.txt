Tonight is the night  
Im gonna make this thing right  
Come closer come and hold me tight  
Feel the heat come rushin  
For my bodys yearnin  
Cant you see  
I want to be all that you need  
  
I just want to feel you  
How would I be touching you  
So just give me all youre lovin  
Spend sometime with me  
On this lovely evening  
  
I want to make love with you  
Feel your arms like you want me to  
Holdin you is what I want to do  
Just tell me when  
To get close enough to you  
To get close enough to you  
  
No need to worry  
Its just you and me baby  
Sit by my side  
Theres no need to hide  
So close your eyes  
And dont think twice  
Feel my lips all over your cheeks  
Cmon break the ice  
  
I just want to feel you  
How would I be touching you  
So just give me all youre lovin  
Spend sometime with me  
On this lovely evening  
  
I want to make love with you  
Feel your arms like you want me to  
Holdin you is what I want to do  
Just tell me when  
To get close enough to you  
To get close enough to you
