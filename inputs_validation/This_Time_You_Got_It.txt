Yeah  
Yeah  
  
If I knew what I wish I knew  
I couldve seen what Im going through  
When I first laid eyes on you  
You blew me away yeah yeah  
  
If the timings oh so right  
Id fear for you every night  
It blew me away yeah yeah  
  
Innocence seems to fade away  
Disappear poof youre gone  
Thought Id lost the key to you  
Looking for notes in the song  
  
Chorus  
This time we got it  
Yeah what Ive been looking for  
Reached out and got it  
I shouldnt ask for anymore  
If you could ask for anything more  
You could be king for a day  
You could be queen for a day  
Bout time you got it  
This time we got it  
This time we got it  
Lets take it away  
  
Now I tried for something new  
Wasnt rich enough to pay my dues  
Was I in the right direction  
I was aiming at you yeah yeah  
  
If the timings oh so right  
Id fear for you every night  
It just blows me away yeah yeah  
  
Thought Id lost the key to you  
Looking for notes in the song  
  
Chorus  
  
Cant lose it  
Cant have enough  
Wont lose it  
Cant get enough  
Dont lose it  
Dont have enough  
Wont lose it  
I cant get enough  
  
Chorus  
  
This time we got it  
Yeah what Ive been looking for  
Reached in and got it  
I shouldnt ask for anymore  
If you could ask for anything more  
You could be king for a day  
You could be queen for a day  
This time you got it  
This time we got it  
Bout time we got it  
Lets take it away  
This time we got it  
This time we got it  
Bout time we got it  
Lets take it away  
  
Take it away  
Yeah yeah yeah
