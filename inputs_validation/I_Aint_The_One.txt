Now Ill tell you plainly baby what a plan to do  
Say I may be crazy woman but I aint no fool  
Your daddys rich mama and youre overdue  
But I aint the one baby been messin with you  
Got bells in your mind lady and its easy to see  
I think its time for me to move along I do believe  
  
Or are you tryin to put a hook on me oh no  
  
Now youre talkin jive woman when you say to me  
That your daddys gonna take us in baby n take care of me  
You know and I know woman I aint the one  
I never hurt you sweetheart said I never pulled my gun  
Got bells in your mind mama and its easy to see  
I think its time for me to move along I do believe  
  
Time for me to put my boots out in the streets  
Are you ready  
Walk on  
  
Alright little missy let me tell you a thing or two  
  
Now youre talkin jive woman when you say to me  
That your daddys gonna take us in baby n take care of me  
You know and I know woman I aint the one  
I never hurt you sweetheart said I never pulled my gun  
Got bells in your mind mama and its easy to see  
I think its time for me to move along I do believe  
  
Oh I must be in the middle of some kinda conspiracy
