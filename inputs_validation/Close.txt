Its just another simple voice mail message  
Ill pick you up and well do dinner by the fire  
And well watch it snow  
Its from a year ago  
Baby I love you and I cant wait to see you tonight  
Ive been thinking bout you all day long  
She pushes nine to save  
She still cant erase  
  
Cause it makes her feel close  
Makes her smile its like hes with her almost  
Till the tears take over shes still in hell  
But she tells herself shes ready to let him go  
Cause that makes her feel close  
  
Its just a worn out Notre Dame tshirt  
Shes gotten mad and tried to throw  
That thing away at least a hundred times  
But shes got it on tonight  
He used to wear it on the weekend just running around  
Probably he forgot he even left it behind  
She says it keeps her warm  
Oh but its so much more  
  
It makes her feel close  
Makes her smile its like hes with her almost  
Till the tears take over  
Shes still in hell  
But she tells herself  
Shes ready to let him go  
Cause that makes her feel close  
  
Just sayin goodbye  
Getting on with her life  
Maybe give love another try  
One more try  
One more try  
  
It makes her feel close  
Makes her smile its like hes with her almost  
Till the tears take over  
Shes still in hell  
But she tells herself  
Shes ready to let him go  
Cause that makes her feel close
