Two bucks an hour  
You can hire a car  
You can go most anywhere  
That depends on who you are  
You can be your own boss  
Takin your own time  
The sun shines all the time  
California girls look fine  
You can truck on down the strip any time of night  
Pull an LA Lady to treat you right  
Stay home call her on the phone  
Sayin come on over baby I hate to be alone  
LA Girls in the sunshine  
LA Girls in the rain  
I want to tell ya gonna go back again  
Im gonna go back again  
Every ones in movies  
And every ones a star  
But most of them are fillin in time  
Workin in some bar  
They sure dont live in Bellaire  
Like they planned to be  
Their names aint in the sidewalk  
For everyone to see  
But you can truck on down the strip any night  
Pull an LA Lady to treat you right  
Stay home call her on the phone  
Sayin come on over baby I hate to be alone  
LA Girls in the sunshine  
LA Girls in the rain  
I want to tell ya gonna go back again  
Im gonna go back again  
Word gets round the bands in town  
Theyre bustlin round the hall  
Readin last months Rolling Stone  
Talkin Rock and Roll  
They got all the answers  
For everything you say  
And even if you pass them by  
They gonna tell you anyway  
But you can truck on down the strip any time of night  
Pull an LA Ladys gonna treat you right  
Stay home call one on the phone  
Sayin come on over baby I hate to be alone  
LA Girls in the sunshine  
LA Girls in the rain  
I want to tell ya gonna go back again  
Im gonna go back there again
