Here come the mountain Here come the hill  
Here come the valley and the Shoreline still  
I know em well know well  
Mongrel on the hard sell  
With a  hot assed inkwell  
Lord But I I cant leave with the blues  
Through endless days and endless nights  
Spare my creator scream for my rights  
 in the wishing well  
Mongrel on the Hard sell with a   
Hot assed Inkwell  
But I wont leave you with the blues no  
Come down to  Wahdooday  
Ill buy you out  
Gonna make you shake it Lord gonna make you shout  
Gonna burn you gonna make you swell  
Mongrel on a hard sell  
With a  hot assed inkwell Lord  
But I cant leave you with the blues no  
No no
