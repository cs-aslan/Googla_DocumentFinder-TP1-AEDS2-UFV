Hook  Justin Bieber  
All I care about is money and the city that Im from  
Imma sing until I feel it Imma go until its done  
And I dont mean to say wassup and my excuse is that Im young  
And Im only getting older somebody shoulda told you  
Im on one you know Im on one  
I said Im on one you know Im on one  
Two white cups and I got that drink could be purple could  
Be pink depending on how you mix that ish money that  
We got never get that ish cause Im on one you know Im one one  
  
You know what I like  
Oh yeah oh yeah x2  
  
Justin Bieber  
You just need to listen teach you how to fix it  
Cause youre cause I dont trust these women  
I dont trust these women they might catch me slipping  
So youre the only one cause I dont trust these women  
They might catch me slipping and put in something different  
So youre the only one cause I dont trust these bitches  
I dont trust these bitches they might catch me simping  
So youre the only one  
  
Trust issues  
  
Verse  
Drizzy Drake check me out  
Coming live from the mothafucking North Side  
Kick game run game run it real good  
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside  
Same nigga that you knew way back when  
You acting like its somebody you dont know  
Tell me how the fuck we supposed to stay friends  
When you got a bunch of feelings that you dont show  
I could tell I could tell I could tell  
Certain people dont like me no more  
New shit dont excite me no more  
Guess that they dont really make em like me no more  
You can look me in my eyes and see I aint myself  
Cause if yall what I created then I hate myself  
But still let them girls in and tell them all  
Leave their cell phones on the table where we see them  
Im all day with it man A M to the P M  
Niggas hating I just wish that they would say it when they see him  
  
Justin Bieber  
Thats that ish that drives me crazy  
And thats all Ive been getting lately  
And its probably why Im scared to put the time in  
Women want to fuck like theyre me and Im them  
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you
