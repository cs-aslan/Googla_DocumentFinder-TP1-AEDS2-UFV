Chorus  
Im just a love machine  
And I wont work for nobody but you  
Im just a love machine  
A huggin kissin fiend  
  
I think its high time you knew  
Whenever I think of you  
My mind blows a fuse  
When I look in you eyes  
My meter starts to rise and I become confused  
My voltage regulator cools  
When Im sitting next to you  
Electricity starts to flow  
And my indicator starts to glow wo  
  
Chorus  
  
Na na na na na na na na na woowoowooo  
Na na na na na na na na na na naaah  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gentle as a lamb  
Im not that hard to program  
Theres no way that you can lose  
My chassis fits like a glove  
Ive got a button for love  
That you have gottouse  
If you look into my file  
I am sure you can find out how  
To turn me on just set my dial  
And let me love you for a little while ooh  
  
Chorus  
  
Na na na na na na na na na woowoowo  
Na na na na na na na na na na naaah  
  
Im just a love machine  
And I wont work for nobody but you  
Im just a love machine  
A huggin kissin fiend
