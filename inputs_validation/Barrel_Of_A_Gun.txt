Do you mean this horny creep  
Set upon weary feet  
Who looks in need of sleep  
That doesnt come  
This twisted tortured mess  
This bed of sinfulness  
Whos longing for some rest  
And feeling numb  
What do you expect of me  
What is it you want  
Whatever youve planned for me  
Im not the one  
A vicious appetite  
Visits me each night  
And wont be satisfied  
Wont be denied  
An unbearable pain  
A beating in my brain  
That leaves the mark of Cain  
Right here inside  
What am I supposed to do  
When everything that Ive done  
Is leading me to conclude  
Im not the one  
Whatever Ive done  
Ive been staring down the Barrel of a Gun  
Is there something you need from me  
Are you having your fun  
I never agreed to be  
Your Holy One  
Whatever Ive done  
Ive been staring down the Barrel of a Gun
