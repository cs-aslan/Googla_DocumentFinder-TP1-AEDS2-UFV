Shes quite the mediator  
A smoother operator you will never see  
Shell see you later  
And no one dares disobey her openly  
  
She knows music I know music too you see  
Shes got the power the teen queen Rosalie  
  
Rosalie Rosalie  
Shes got the plastic  
Comes from all the corners corners of the world  
So fantastic  
Shes everybodys favorite little record girl  
  
She knows music I know music too you see  
Shes got the power shes got the tower  
Rosalie Rosalie  
  
From Chattanooga to good old Bogalusa  
You can hear them fine  
She makes her choices  
And then you best be smilin when its choosin time  
  
Knows music  
No music till you see  
Shes got the power got the tower Rosalie Rosalie Rosalie  
Knows music knows music knows music  
Rosalie Rosalie
