I say black and you say white  
I turn to the left you move to the right  
No matter what I do  
Im always on the other side of you  
Im always on the other side of you  
  
I want to play but you like to fight  
I rise in the morning you hide in the night  
No matter what I do  
Im always on the other side of you  
  
Like paralell lines so near yet so far  
Like north pole and south pole were oceans apart  
Im always on the other side of you  
  
You let go I try to connect  
You always remember I try to forget  
Im always on the other side of you
