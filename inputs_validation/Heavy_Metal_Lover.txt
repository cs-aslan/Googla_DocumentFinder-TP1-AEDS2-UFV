Heavy metal lover heavy metal lover  
  
I want your whiskey mouth  
All over my blond self  
Red wine cheap perfume  
And a filthy pout  
  
Tonight bring all your friends  
Because a group does it better  
Love is down with a dance  
Lets have a full house of leather  
  
Repeat x2  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Heavy metal lover  
  
Dirty pony I  
Cant wait to hose you down  
Youve got to earn your love  
Down in this part of town  
  
Dirty girls in a patch  
Follow the Remington Rebels  
Lets raise hell in the streets  
Drink beer and get into trouble  
  
Repeat x2  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Heavy metal lover  
  
I could be your girl  
Girl girl girl girl girl  
But would you love me  
If I ruled the world world world  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Heavy metal lover  
  
Women slap it go fuck  
New York clappers go drunk  
Black like vicars go slow  
Move your pieces youre junk  
  
Porsche and drivers same Jane  
Youre so hot but not to taste  
Happy lovers on display  
Baby we were born this way  
  
Repeat x2  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Repeat x2  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Girl girl girl girl girl  
But would you love me  
If I ruled the world world world
