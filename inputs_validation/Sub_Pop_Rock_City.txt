Im not stoned but I wanted to tell ya  
When Im in the mood I could think of playing there  
Going to Seattle where the rocks so heavy  
With all them sex dogs in my Chevy  
  
At the XTC party everybodys invited  
Cool give it dude were plastic like you  
Going to a show rocks all night  
And everyone I hate is at the party tonight  
I said Sub Pop Rock City
