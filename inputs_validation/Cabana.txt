Up early smokin and plottin  
Looking at these lames being thankful Im not them  
This year couple million out the game  
And youre wondering how I got them  
I got it from going hard I always stay on my job  
Wanna get high you should come to my spot then  
And smoke with some heavyweight niggas  
Jets Taylor Gang nigga losings not a option  
Now Im always on the road  
And everywhere I go people asking what Im rocking  
I tell em this is next years fresh and this years best  
And some shit you niggas not in so quit copyin  
  
Yeah man  
You niggas got it confused trying to do what the fuck we do  
Thats not the point  
The point is for you to do you  
Its a beautiful thing  
  
Im in the regal you in a rut  
Stuck cant come up  
Old jealous niggas hatin on us  
Bitches is wishin youd shut the fuck up  
Im in the position set my niggas up tough  
What the fuck just jump  
Continents I promise it  
I could go from bucks to billions in a minute  
Made a split second decision  
Executed with precision  
I feel attention when I walk in the room  
Old cuddly ass niggas go to hidin they woman  
Thinkin Imma walk up to em but I dont do it  
Baby girl know the big shit from the manure  
I could help you shine like a jeweler  
Candy paint make an old whip newer
