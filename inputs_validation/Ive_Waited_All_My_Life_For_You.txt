Dont you know  
That youre the one  
Id like to live my life through  
I cant see anyone with me but you  
  
I want to go where you go  
And share the things you do  
For Ive waited all my life for you  
Ive heard tales  
That true love comes  
Only once in a life time  
And this time is the last time for me  
For I just cant imagine  
Being in love with someone new  
cause Ive waited all my life for you  
  
So here it is  
All the love  
That Ive saved for a lifetime  
Never touched  
Never crushed  
And never used  
And to think that Id ever find you  
Its impossible but true  
cause Ive waited all my life for you  
Oh I just cant imagine  
Being in love with someone new  
cause Ive waited all my life for you
