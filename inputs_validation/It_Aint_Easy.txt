You make it all sound easy  
Now youve tasted all my wine  
I never wanted to hear the news  
That youd found another man  
But its hard to see  
What you want from me  
Its not easy to be inbetween  
Its now up to you to  
Make the move this time  
  
But it aint easy when you  
Dont know where to turn  
And it aint easy  
But you take the chance  
The final chance to learn  
Yes to learn  
That it aint easy when you  
Dont know where to turn  
And it aint easy so you take a look  
Another look at life look at life  
  
cause it aint what youve got  
In the palm of your hand  
And its not what youll get  
From another man  
That will last you  
The rest of your life my friend  
  
Monday mornings waiting  
Take a look at what you see  
Make the most of your life  
Dont keep the pages clean  
Baby now youve got this chance  
Dont leave me out  
Its so hard when  
Youre inbetween  
What you need and  
What may never be  
  
It aint easy
