Bang on my window if  
You want to get your look out  
I felt the wind blow when  
She took her little book out  
  
Im steady loving on the  
Lady of these pages  
Another chapter if you will  
So  
  
Down on the river tonight  
Take off your glassess and fight  
  
Under the heliomoon Im  
Going to pop the culture  
Blue cherry dress on you  
Is looking like a sculpture  
  
This recreation is amusing  
And confusing  
You never knew that it  
Could feel so good while losing  
  
What you lose your virginity  
  
Down on the river tonight  
Take off your glassess and fight  
  
Ill be your domino  
Sit back and watch it flow  
Get so emotional  
I got a notion for  
And when a star gets bent  
Ill be your parliment  
Ill be your domino  
Sit back and watch it flow  
  
My intuition was a  
Poppin and a shakin  
The very thought of it was  
All too much to take in  
  
Curl up with lover we  
Could lie out on the blanket  
This canopy above ill  
Take the time to thank it  
  
Down on the river tonight  
Take off your panties and fight  
  
Ill be your domino  
Sit back and watch it flow  
Get so emotional  
I got a notion for  
And when a star gets bent  
Ill be your parliment  
Ill be your domino  
Sit back and watch it flow  
  
I want to bury my face  
Deep in your aroma  
Her name is Lisa but  
They call her Desmadona  
  
Come out and see me for  
Some street comunication  
I think its sweet of you  
To be my motivation  
  
Ill be your domino  
Sit back and watch it flow  
Get so emotional  
I got a notion for  
And when a star gets bent  
Ill be your parliment  
Ill be your domino  
Sit back and watch it flow
