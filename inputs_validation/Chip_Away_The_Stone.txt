You act like a prima donna  
Playing so hard to get  
Sittin so cool and nonchalant  
Draggin on a cigarette  
You keep a wall all around ya  
Ill get through some day  
I want your love baby  
Push dont shove  
Gonna chip that stone away  
  
Chip away  
Chip away at the stone  
I wont stop until your love is my very own  
Chip away  
Thats what Im gonna do  
Sweet little mama  
I wanna get next to you  
  
You stand like a marble statue  
Trying to look so hard  
All decked out in your antique dress  
While the boys all promenade  
Even a rock will crumble  
If you strike it night and day  
If hammer I must Im gonna get through your crust  
Gonna chip that stone away  
  
Chip away  
Chip away at the stone  
I wont stop until your love is my very own  
Chip away  
Thats what Im gonna do  
Sweet little mama  
I wanna get next to you  
  
Chip away  
Chip away at the stone  
Honey I wont stop until your love is my very own  
Chip away  
Thats what Im wanna do  
Sweet little mama  
I wanna get next to you  
  
Yes I do yes I do  
  
Chip away chip away at the stone  
Chip away chip away at the stone  
  
I wont stop  
I wont stop  
I wont stop  
I wont stop  
I wont stop  
I wont stop  
  
Chip it  
Im gonna nip it all night long
