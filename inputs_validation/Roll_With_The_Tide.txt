Youre a drifter I knew it when we met you soon grow tired of every job you
get  
Like a wildcat on a restless changing sea Ill never know why way youre
taking me  
So Ill roll with the tide roll with the tide  
Though the waves never seem to find the shore  
Ill roll with the tide roll with the tide and I will till you dont want me
anymore  
 steel   
Im your woman heaven helps me youre my man so stir the boat Ill hang on if
I can  
Though youre crazy I guess Im crazy too so sail on sink or swim love Im
with you  
So Ill roll with the tide  
And I will till you dont want me anymore
