I feel a little blue cause I cant sew  
Theres still a lot of things that I should know  
Anyone can guess  
I dont know how to press  
My Saturday clothes  
And everyones goin home  
I feel a little sad to watch them leave  
But Ill be cool because I dont believe  
The happy times are gone  
I can still put on  
My Saturday clothes  
Every warm body knows  
Ive got to tell you that was a swell time  
Now Ill take the butts away  
And put the glasses on the tray  
Ill see you all next Saturday  
I feel a little off because theyre gone  
And if my gal were here Id still be on  
But in a week or two  
Theres lots of things to do  
In my Saturday clothes  
And everyones gone home  
Ive got to tell you that was a swell time  
So now Ill take the butts away  
And put the glasses on the tray  
Ill see you all next Saturday
