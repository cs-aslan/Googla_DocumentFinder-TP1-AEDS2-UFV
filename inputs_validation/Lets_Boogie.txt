Come on over here baby  
Girl Im gonna give you a little kiss  
Youre gonna feel my hands all around you  
Not a finger will you miss  
After I turn you on baby  
Im gonna blow your mind with some of this  
Squeezed in that mauved dress you showed me  
Child that hemlines out of sight  
With that foxy frame youre flaunting  
It aint no way it wont fit you right  
Were going to a rock and roll revival  
You know were sure nuff gonna boogie tonight  
Theyd be playing them old and golden goodies  
Used to blow my mind when I was a child  
Back when Id got my head together  
I wouldnt walk a block but Id dance a mile  
Girl you better be in good shape tonight  
Cause we sure enuff gonna ball awhile  
Its been a long long time  
Since I let me backbone bend  
Oh for them same sweet memories  
When we didnt have nothing but time to spend  
Wed boogie and ball all Saturday mornin  
Right back that night and ball again
