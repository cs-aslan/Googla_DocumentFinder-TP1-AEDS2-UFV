Baby youve been going so crazy  
Lately nothing seems to be going right  
Solo why do you have to get so low  
Youre so  
Youve been waiting in the sun too long  
  
But if you sing sing sing sing sing sing  
For the love you bring wont mean a thing  
Unless you sing sing sing sing  
  
Colder crying on your shoulder  
Hold her and tell her everythings gonna be fine  
Surely youve been going to early  
Hurry cause no ones gonna be stopped  
  
But if you sing sing sing sing sing sing  
For the love you bring wont mean a thing  
Unless you sing sing sing sing  
  
Baby theres something going on today  
But I say nothing nothing nothing  
Nothing nothing nothing nothing
