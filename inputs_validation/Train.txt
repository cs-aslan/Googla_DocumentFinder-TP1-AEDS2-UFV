A quarter after two  
Sittin in my car watching  
Waiting on a train  
Ninetyseven flatcars  
Loaded down with troop trucks and tanks  
Rolling by  
  
Im twentyone and Im scared as hell  
I quit school Im healthy as a horse  
Because of all that Ill be the first one to die in a war  
  
The whole damn town was sleeping  
Dreaming the same dream  
The radio was playing  
Roger McWilliams singing  
To each and every thing theres a time and a season  
  
Im twentyone and Im scared as hell  
I quit school Im healthy as a horse  
Because of all that Ill be the first one to die in a war  
  
Yes I have the right to say  
We all die anyway  
But Id just like to know  
Where does my time go
