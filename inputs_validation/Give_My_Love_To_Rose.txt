I found him by the railroad track this morning  
I could see that he was nearly dead  
I knelt down beside him and I listened  
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said  
  
He said they let me out of prison down in Frisco  
For ten long years Ive paid for what Ive done  
I was trying to get back to Louisiana  
To see my Rose and get to know my son  
  
Chorus  
Give my love to Rose please wont you mister  
Take her all my money tell her to buy some pretty clothes  
Tell my boy his daddys so proud of him  
And dont forget to give my love to Rose  
  
Tell them I said thanks for waiting for me  
Tell my boy to help his mom at home  
Tell my Rose to try to find another  
For it aint right that she should live alone  
  
Mister heres a bag with all my money  
It wont last them long the way it goes  
God bless you for finding me this morning  
And dont forget to give my love to Rose  
  
Chorus
