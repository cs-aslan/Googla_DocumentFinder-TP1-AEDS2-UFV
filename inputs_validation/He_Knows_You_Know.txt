Light switch yellow fever crawling up your bathroom wall  
Singing psychedelic praises to the depths of a china bowl  
Youve got venom in your stomach youve got poison in your head  
You should have listened to the priest at the confession  
When he offered you the sacred bread  
He knows you know he knows you know  
H e knows you know but hes got problems  
Fast feed crystal fever swarming through a fractured mind  
Chilling needles freeze emotion the blind shall lead the blind  
Youve got venom in you stomach youve got poison in your head  
When your conscience whispered the vein lines stiffened  
You were walking with the dead  
He knows you know he knows you know he knows you know  
Hes got experience hes got experience he knows you know  
But hes got problems problems problems  
He knows slash wrist scarlet fever crawled under your bathroom door  
Pumping arteries ooze their problems through the gap that the razor tore  
Youve got venom in your stomach youve got poison in your head  
You should have listened to your analysts questions  
When you lay on his leather bed  
He knows you know he knows you know  
H he knows you know but hes got problems  
Blank eyes purple fever streaming through the frosted pane  
You learned your lesson far to late from the links in a chemist chain  
Youve got venom in your stomach youve got poison in your head  
You should have stayed at home and talked with father  
Listen to the lies he fed  
He knows you know he knows you know  
He knows you know but hes got problems  
He knows you know he knows you know he knows you know  
Hes got experience hes got experience he knows you know  
You know you know you know
