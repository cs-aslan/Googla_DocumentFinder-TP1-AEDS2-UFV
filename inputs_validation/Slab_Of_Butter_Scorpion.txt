Verse 1  
The only laws I obey the ones Im makin for myself  
So why you make me play on the road to something else  
Self control is not something Im working on  
We fuck you turn me on is all I can say about you  
  
Chorus  
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun  
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one  
Now that you and me are one  
Now that you and me are one  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
  
Verse 2  
Make sure made a hole and now its open full of sweat  
Like a scorpionon fire stinging myself to death  
I get extinguished but its instinctual  
You turn me on is all I can say about you  
  
Chorus  
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun  
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one  
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun  
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one  
Now that you and me are one  
Now that you and me are one  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
You turn me on  
You turn me on
