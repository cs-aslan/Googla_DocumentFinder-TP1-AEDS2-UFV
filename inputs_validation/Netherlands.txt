High on this mountain  
The clouds down below  
Im feeling so strong and alive  
From this rocky perch  
Ill continue to search  
For the wind  
And the snow  
And the sky  
  
I want a lover  
I want some friends  
And I want to live in the sun  
And I want to do all the things that I  
Never have done  
  
Sunny bright mornings  
And pale moonlit nights  
Keep me from feeling alone  
Now Im learning to fly  
And this freedom is like  
Nothing that Ive ever known  
Ive seen the bottom  
And Ive been on top  
But mostly Ive lived in between  
And where do you go  
When you get to the end of  
Your dream  
  
Off in the nether lands  
I heard a sound  
Like the beating of heavenly wings  
And deep in my brain  
I can hear a refrain  
Of my soul as she rises and sings  
Anthems to glory and  
Anthems to love and  
Hymns filled with early delight  
Like the songs that the darkness  
Composes to worship the light  
  
Once in a vision  
I came on some woods  
And stood at a fork in the road  
My choices were clear  
Yet I froze with the fear  
Of not knowing which way to go  
  
One road was simple  
Acceptance of life  
The other road offered sweet peace  
When I made my decision  
My vision became my release
