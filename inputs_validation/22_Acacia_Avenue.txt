If youre feeling down depressed and lonely  
I know a place where we can go  
22 Acacia Avenue meet a lady that I know  
So if youre looking for a good time  
And youre prepared to pay the price  
Fifteen quid is all she asks for  
Everybodys got their vice  
  
If youre waiting for a long time for the rest to do their piece  
You can tell her that you know me and you might even get it free  
So any time youre down the East End dont you hesitate to go  
You can take my honest word for it shell teach you more than you can know  
  
Charlotte cant you get out from all this madness  
Cant you see it only brings you sadness  
When you entertain your men dont know the risk of getting disease  
  
Some day when youre reaching the age of forty  
I bet youll regret the days when you were laying  
Nobody then will want to know  
You wont have any beautiful wares to show any more  
  
22 the avenue thats the place where we all go  
You will find its warm inside the red lights burning bright tonight  
  
Charlotte isnt it time you stopped this mad life  
Dont you ever think about the bad times  
Why do you have to live this way  
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay  
  
Sometimes when your strolling down the avenue  
The way you walk it make men think of having you  
When youre walking down the street  
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you  
  
Beat her mistreat her do anything that you please  
Bite her excite her make her get down on her knees  
Abuse her misuse her she can take all that youve got  
Caress her molest her she always does what you want  
  
Youre running away dont you know what youre doing  
Cant you see itll lead you to ruin  
Charlotte youve taken your life and youve thrown it away  
You believe that because what youre earning  
Your lifes good dont you know that youre hurting  
All the people that love you dont cast them aside  
All the men that are constantly drooling  
Its no life for you stop all that screwing  
Youre packing your bags and youre coming with me
