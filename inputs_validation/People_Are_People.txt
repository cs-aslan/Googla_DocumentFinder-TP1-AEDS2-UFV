People are people so why should it be  
You and I should get along so awfully  
So were different colours  
And were different creeds  
And different people have different needs  
Its obvious you hate me  
Though Ive done nothing wrong  
I never even met you  
So what could I have done  
I cant understand  
What makes a man  
Hate another man  
Help me understand  
People are people so why should it be  
You and I should get along so awfully  
Help me understand  
Now youre punching and youre kicking  
And youre shouting at me  
Im relying on your common decency  
So far it hasnt surfaced  
But Im sure it exists  
It just takes a while to travel  
From your head to your fist  
I cant understand  
What makes a man  
Hate another man  
Help me understand
