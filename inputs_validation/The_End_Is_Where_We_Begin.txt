Alone in a crowd a missin planet  
You crash to the ground  
You never planned that It just happened this way  
It happened this way  
  
The starts in your eyes  
If you believe in death youre certain to die  
If you believe in love youre always alive  
Youre always alive  
Youre always alive  
  
Chorus  
Here I am  
Waitin for one last chance  
Cause this time we got nothing left to loose  
And everything is ruined  
But the end is where we begin  
  
Youre lost in the clouds  
I climbed a ladder but I cant talk you down  
And all that matters is tomorrow today  
Tomorrow today  
Tomorrow today  
  
Chorus  
  
And the winds will lead us somewhere  
And the winds will lead us somewhere  
  
Hey  
  
Chorus  
  
Ah the end is where we begin  
  
We got a long long long  
We got a long long long  
We got a long long long  
Long way to go
