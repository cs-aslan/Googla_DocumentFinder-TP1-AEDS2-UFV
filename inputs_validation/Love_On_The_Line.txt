When I dont see you  
And I dont know where youve been  
There gets to be a question in my mind  
It hurts to love you  
And the knife goes through the heart of me  
When youre gone I lose a part of me  
Thats hard to find  
  
Dont want to fall asleep without you  
Dont want to wake  
Dont want to wake up when youre gone  
I dont know what you do that makes me love you  
But then love dont mean surrender  
And its time I let it show  
Youve got someone else in love with you  
And I deserve to know  
Youve been laying our  
  
Love on the line  
Thats my suspicion  
When I see her in your eyes  
Love undermined  
No ammunition  
I dont want to love you paralyzed  
I dont want to love you paralyzed  
  
Some misty morning  
When she does the same to you  
When she makes you feel like I do  
Thats the day  
But she cant have you  
She cant build a wall around you  
She cant love you like I love you anyway  
  
I know by midnight if you leave me  
And no lies can make the difference  
More hearts get broken now than need be  
And its right to face the woman  
That steal the away man  
If theres anything to get you back  
That I must do I can  
And our love will never be  
  
Love on the line  
Thats my suspicion  
When I can see her in your eyes  
Love undermined  
Im on a mission  
I dont want to love you paralyzed  
I dont want to love you paralyzed  
  
And my life I wont surrender  
And Ill find out where you go  
Theres someone else in love with you  
And I deserve to know  
And its dying in the heart of me  
And our love should never be  
  
Love on the line  
Thats my suspicion  
When I can see her in your eyes  
No ammunition  
I dont want to love you paralyzed  
I dont want to love you paralyzed  
  
Love on the line  
Thats my suspicion  
When I can see her in your eyes  
Love undermined  
Im on a mission  
I dont want to love you paralyzed  
I dont want to love you paralyzed
