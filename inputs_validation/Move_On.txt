Move on theres no time to waste complaining  
Move on cant you feel your heart expanding  
Every time I turn around  
Ignorance one step behind  
So come on and try again  
You can make it if you try  
  
Move on theres no time for hesitation  
Move on all you need is motivation  
Every time I turn around  
Ignorance one step behind  
So come on and try again  
You can make it if you try  
  
Keep on moving on  
Keep on moving  
Got to keep on trying  
Every step of the way  
Got to keep on trying  
Every step of the way
