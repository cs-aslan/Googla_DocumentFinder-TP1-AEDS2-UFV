Catlong sighs holdin Kittys black tooth  
She left to marry some top cat aint it the cold truth  
And there hasnt been a tally since Sally left the alley  
Since Sally left with Big Pretty things have got pretty thin  
Its tight on this fence since them young dudes are musclin in  
  
Jack Knife cries cause Babys in a bundle  
She goes runnin nightly lightly through the jungle  
And them tin cans are explodin out of the 90degree heat  
Cat somehow lost his baby down on Bleecker Street  
Its sad but it sure is true  
Cat shrugs his shoulders sits back and sighs  
  
Catlong lies backbent on a trash can  
Flashin lights that cut the night dude in the white says hes the man  
Well you better move fast when youre young or youre not around  
Cat somehow lost his Kitty in the city pound  
So get right get tight get down  
Whos that down at the end of the alley Shes been gone so long  
Here she comes here she comes  
Here she comes here she comes  
  
Kittys back in town here she comes now  
Kittys back in town  
Cat knows Kittys been untrue and that she left him for a city dude  
Well shes so soft shes so blue  
When he looks into her eyes he just sits back and sighs  
Ooh what can I do ooh what can I do  
Ooh what can I do ooh what can I do Alright  
Ooh alright ooh alright  
Ooh alright ooh alright
