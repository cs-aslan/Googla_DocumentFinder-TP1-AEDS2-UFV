sambora child  
  
Father time  
I couldnt make her wanna stay  
I couldnt seem to find the words to say  
Now I have to live in yesterday  
Father time  
  
I thought that you were on my side  
I thought that I could keep our love alive  
I thought that I could keep her satisfied  
  
The clock keeps tickin and I keep on thinkin bout you  
Im knockin at the door of your heart but I cant break through  
  
Father time  
Grant me just another day  
Of our love I tried to make her stay  
Father time  
Dont tell me its too late  
All my life you know that I would wait  
Father time  
  
Now shes gone  
She didnt even say goodbye  
I guess she didnt have the heart to try  
She didnt even have the guts to lie  
Father time  
Only you can turn the page  
And close the curtain on this empty stage  
Only you can take my pain away  
  
My heart keeps breakin and my body keeps aching for you  
Its time to hold on but theres nothin left to hold on to  
  
Father time  
Grant me just another day  
Of our love I tried to make her stay  
Father time  
Dont tell me its too late  
All my life you know that I would wait  
Father time  
  
Father father cant you see Im depending on you  
Im dying at the door to your heart and I cant break through  
  
Father time  
Grant me just another day  
Of our love I tried to make her stay  
Father time  
Dont tell me its too late  
All my life you know that I would wait  
Father time  
Shes your child make her mine  
Father time
