This lovely day will lengthen into evening  
Well sigh goodbye to all weve ever had  
Alone where we have walked together  
Ill remember April and be glad  
  
Ill be content you loved me once in April  
Your lips were warm and love an spring were new  
But Im not afraid of autumn and her sorrow  
For Ill remember Ill remember  
April and you Ill remember  
  
The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes  
For flames and love live such a little while  
I wont forget but I wont be lonely Oh no  
Ill remember April and Ill smile  
  
The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes  
For flames and love live such a little while a little while  
  
I wont forget but I wont be lonely I wont be lonely  
Ill remember April and Ill smile  
  
I wont forget but I wont be lonely no  
Ill remember April and Ill smile  
  
This lovely day will fade away
