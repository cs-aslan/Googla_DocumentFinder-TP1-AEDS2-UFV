Chorus x4  
Im A Flirt  
Im A Pro  
Im A Freak  
Got A Different Girl Everyday Of The Week  
  
Weezy Verse  
Im a blood ima roll Im a g  
In a different world outerspace with a freak  
But that dont mean neptune on the beat  
Cuz its new jersey devil from blackwall street  
Weezy f baby from young money baby  
Like the easter bunny baby wanted my candy  
So I gave her my lollipop then she made her body pop  
Then that made me kinda hot  
Im lying that made me sauna hot  
But please stop sweating me  
Women screamget in me  
And what do I do I get in it  
I put on my boot and I step in it  
Right left in em mr eterceden head all the time  
It may sound crazy but I got head on my mind  
Lay it on the line or just lay it on carter  
And yea I hear you screaming but my name aint harder  
Girl Im nasty I do my thing and they coming for me like lassie  
  
Chorus x4  
Im A Flirt  
Im A Pro  
Im A Freak  
Got A Different Girl Everyday Of The Week
