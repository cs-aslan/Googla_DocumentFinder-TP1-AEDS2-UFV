Do you recall  
That lonely summer day  
We were together and things got in our way  
Well so you think that its all over  
And you know its gone to stay  
Oh after stormy weather does the sunshine every day  
  
Yes I recall the things you said that day  
You told me that you were leavin  
Cause we cant go on this way  
You think that its all over and you know its gone to stay  
Oh after stormy weather does the sunshine every day  
  
Yes its the lovin things  
That keeps us wandering  
Yes its the lovin things  
Ooo baby love  
  
Yes its the lovin things  
That keeps us wandering  
Yes its the lovin things  
  
Ooo girl  
Say youll stay  
Youll stay  
You think that its all over and you know its gone to stay  
Oh after stormy weather does the sunshine every day
