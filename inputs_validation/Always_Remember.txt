Always remember Im by your side  
Such a shame that you had to go  
So much more that Id like to know  
So many things you forgot to show me how to do  
  
When times are hard I forget your gone  
I go to call you before it dawns on me  
That you wont be there now  
But I still have these words that you gave me  
  
Always remember Im by your side  
Always remember Im by your side  
  
I got two kids of my own now  
They grow up so fast  
And how I wish you did not miss that part of who I am  
But I keep doing all that I can do  
And I will smile when they ask about you  
And I will sing to them every day  
With voice and the words that you used to say  
Will change the world one day  
  
Always remember Im by your side  
Always remember Im by your side  
  
And while they grow up you will show up  
In things they do and say  
Like a reflection to a connection  
Of who theyll be one day  
They will learn to get their wings  
And fly through the changes life will bring  
So on  
And it will go on  
And you will go on  
  
And they will sing with the voice that you gave them  
Always remember Im by your side  
Always remember Im by your side  
Im by your side  
Im by your side
