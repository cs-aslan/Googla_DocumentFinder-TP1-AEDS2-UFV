That falls in love with you  
And expects you to be true  
Thats why I pity that fool

theyre just standing there  
watching you make a fool of me

Hey I pity the fool  
I pity the fool that falls in love with you  
  
Hell break your heart one day  
And hell laugh and go on his way  
Thats why I pity that fool

Hell take her heart away  
And hell find another fool to play  
Thats why I pity that fool
