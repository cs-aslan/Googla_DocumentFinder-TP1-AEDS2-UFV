I give a shit about the kick thats been coming from the underground spot  
beating the pop up the fuck up that lays all around Now give me sound from
the other side every night its gonna go on and flow on and on and on and on  
  
Mister son of a gun I got a run now My time is over run you over like a Range
Rover Oh my god incredible superstar throw some lyrics make them run like a
supercar When you know where Im at your fatter than fat cause help me god
if I aint the cool cat Unequal its not even legal Im chased by the rap
police like Bugsy Seagel  
  
  
Baseline baseline weve got fools on the case and their giving me baseline
Baseline baseline  
Baseline baseline weve got fools on the case and their giving me baseline
Baseline baseline  
  
Now were back in the game The Quarashi pain its plain I see the suckers
fall out and the fuckers call out Pick me up But they dont know what its
about I do my shit on the mic and Im pleasing the crowd Jump back get back
or else your getting a smack on your face just like your daddy used to smack
you way back in the days This aint no silly ass game Im playing hear what
Im saying now start praying  
  
  
  
What we have is breaking us down x6
