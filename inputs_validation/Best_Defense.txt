you havent heard a word of what i said id give anything to get inside your
head you act as if theres nothing left to say i guess everything is easier
that way i know that you dont want to think about it anyway i wont let you
hide from this even with your best defense you cant deny the way you feel
about me i know you think about it all of time but theres nothing left to
make you change your mind i know you think youre doing what is right but
youre acting on frustration out of spite and i dont want to say another word
to start a fight and if youre so convinced that were so wrong youre still
standing here where youve been all along it doesnt make much difference
where we think that we belong
