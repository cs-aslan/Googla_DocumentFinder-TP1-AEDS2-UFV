Marys sellin flowers on a stall in EC1  
Tonight shell be out lookin for some fun  
Her mate Gerrys in the basement he hasnt got a home  
But prides himself that hes got most things done  
Meanwhile Im up on the roof  
Waitin for the sun to shine  
I havent got an excuse  
So Ill just keep my head down  
Davids in the city hes just made a deal  
And the boys they want to take his trousers down  
So they buy some little pills which will make poor David ill  
And they find themselves in some club downtown  
Meanwhile I got off the roof  
cause the rain keeps pouring down  
And I havent got a clue  
Why theres faith in all these clowns  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world  
Jim and Jane hit the grapevine cause theyre lookin for a party  
A secret number knows where it can be found  
So they pick up Pete and Sheila then they head down the M40  
But someone said they closed the country down  
Meanwhile Ive locked myself in the kitchen  
Waitin for the storm to pass  
And if theres too much damage  
I think Ill get the fuck out fast  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world  
This is the modern world
