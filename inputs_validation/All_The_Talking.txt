I dont like the way I feel  
But I dont understand  
Why I hide the things I do  
And I dont care whos wrong or right  
I just need a reason  
A reason just to see it through  
And I dont care if Ive wasted all your time  
Cause theres dreams that go by  
And dreams that you find  
And I know what you mean  
But I cant hear you  
With all the talking with all the talking  
And I know how it seems  
But I cant find you  
With all the talking  
I never mentioned love affairs  
That run through my mind  
And all the faces you wont see  
And you dont know your words have changed  
So you keep talking  
And there might be something for me  
And I dont care if Ive wasted all your time  
Cause theres dreams that go by  
And dreams that you find  
And I know what you mean  
But I cant hear you  
With all the talking with all the talking  
And I know how it seems  
But I cant find you  
With all the talking  
Cant you feel it  
Cant you see  
This world just gets me down  
When all at once you find a way  
To be satisfied  
And I dont like the way I feel  
But I dont understand  
Why I hide the things I do  
And I dont care whos wrong or right  
I just need a reason  
I need a reason  
I need a reason  
Oh I know what you mean  
But I cant hear you  
With all the talking with all the talking  
And I know how it seems  
But I cant find you  
With all the talking with all the talking  
I know what you mean  
I know what you mean  
I know what you mean  
I know what you mean
