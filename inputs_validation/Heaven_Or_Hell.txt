Well sometimes its heaven  
And sometimes its hell  
Sometimes I dont even know  
Sometimes I take it as far as I can  
And sometimes I dont even go  
My front tracksre found for a cold water  
And my back tracksre covered with snow  
Sometimes its heaven  
Sometimes its hell  
Sometimes I dont even know  
  
Heaven aint walkin  
On a street paved with gold  
And hell aint a mountain of fire  
Heaven is layin  
In my sweet babys arms  
Hell is when baby aint there  
Well my front tracksre found for a cold water  
And my back tracksre covered with snow  
Well sometimes its heaven  
And sometimes its hell  
Sometimes I dont even know
