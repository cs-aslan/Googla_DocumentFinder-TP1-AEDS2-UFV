Well Im leaving my family  
Im leaving all my friends  
My bodys at home  
But my hearts in the wind  
And the clouds are like headlines  
Upon a new front page sky  
My tears are salt water  
The moons full and high  
  
And I know Joe Conrad would be proud of me  
Many before me been called by the sea  
To be up in the crows nest singing my saying  
Shiver me timbers lets all sail away  
  
And the fog lifting  
The sand shifting  
Im drifting on out  
Old Captain Ahab got nothing on me  
Swallow me dont follow me  
Im traveling alone  
The waters my daughter  
I skip like a stone  
  
And the fog lifting  
The sand shifting  
Im drifting on out  
Old Captain Ahab got nothing on me  
Swallow me dont follow me  
Im traveling alone  
The waters my daughter  
I skip like a stone  
  
Wont you please call my family  
Tell them not to cry  
My goodbyes are written  
By the moon in the sky  
Say nobody knows me  
Ive got no reason to stay  
Shiver me timbers  
Im sailing away  
  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
