Im not in this world  
To live up to your expectations  
Neither are you here to live up to mine yeah  
  
I dont owe no one  
No obligation  
No I dont mean none  
So everything is fine fine  
  
ChorusRepeat x4  
I said I am that I am  
I am I am I am  
  
Dont underestimate  
My ability  
Dont definite my character  
Dont belittle  
My authority  
It is time you recognized my quality  
  
Chorus  
  
Learn to love  
To love your brother  
Dont covet your neighbor  
  
Flee from the city  
Its getting shitty  
It is full of outaquityInequity  
  
Chorus  
  
I am the rock of the ages  
You cannot move I at all  
I am the son of lightning  
You cannot move I at all  
Son of Jacob  
Cannot move me at all  
I am the son of Moses  
You cant move I at all  
I am the son of David  
You cannot move I at all  
  
I am a firm ripe diamond  
You cannot move I at all  
You could a shed more tears  
You cannot move I at all  
  
You could a full of evil  
You cannot move I at all  
You could a try more nuttin  
You cannot move I at all  
  
And you can try make a something  
That cant move I at all  
And could a come with ism  
You cant move I at all  
  
And could come with skism  
That cant move I at all
