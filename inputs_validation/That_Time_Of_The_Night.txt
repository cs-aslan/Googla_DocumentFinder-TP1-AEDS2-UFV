At that time of the night  
When streetlights throw crosses through window frames  
Paranoia roams where the shadows reign  
Oh at that time of the night  
At that time of the night  
Your senses tangled in some new perfume  
Criticism triggers of a loaded room  
Oh at that time of the night  
  
So if you ask me  
How do I fell inside  
I could honestly tell you  
Weve been taken on a very long ride  
And if my owners let me  
Have some free time some day  
With all good intention  
I would probably run away  
Clutching the short straw  
  
At that time of the night  
When questions rally in an open mind  
Summon all your answers with an ice cube chime  
At that time of the night  
At that time of the night  
Pretend youre off the hook with the telephone  
Your confidence wounded in a free fire zone  
Oh at that time of the night  
  
So if you ask me  
Where do I go from here  
My next destination  
Even isnt really that clear  
So if you join me  
And get on your knees and prey  
Ill show you salvation  
Well take the alternative way  
Clutching the short straw  
  
If I had enough money  
Id buy a round for that boy overthere  
A companion in my madness in the mirror  
The one with the silvery hair  
And if some kind soul  
Could please pick up my tab  
And while theyre at it  
If they could pick up my broken heart  
  
Warm wet circles
