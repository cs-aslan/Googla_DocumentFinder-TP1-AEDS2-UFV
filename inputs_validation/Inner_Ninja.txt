Ninja Youre a ninja Get out of here youre a ninja  
Yes I am a ninja  
  
I read the rules before I broke em  
I broke the chains before they choked me out  
Now I pay close attention  
Really learn the code  
I learned to read the map before I hit the road  
  
Hey yo I know you never heard this before  
But Id rather lose a fight than miss the war  
And I aint wishing competition or fishin for it  
Im just living in the system conditions are poor  
Ive been lost in the rhythm and misinformed  
Too many late nights hittin the liquor store  
Too many bad decisions half assed attempts  
No sweat no fear no blood no tears  
I go hard and I aint makin up no excuse  
Im overdue I dont do what Im supposed to do  
Cause you can think about it man were supposed to lose  
It aint all picture perfect ocean views  
No I was a first class rookie  
Takin out bullies in my all black hoodie  
Man of mystery you know the history  
Get it or forget it cause poof Im outta here  
  
I read the rules before I broke em  
I broke the chains before they choked me out  
And I pay close attention  
Really learn the code  
I learned to read the map before I hit the road  
  
But we say  
  
Nobodys gonna see me comin  
Nobodys gonna hear a sound  
No matter how hard they tryin  
No stoppin me since Ive found  
My inner ninja 4x  
  
Hey yo Ive been high and Ive been real low  
Ive been beaten and broken but I healed though  
So many ups and downs roughed up and clowned  
We all got problems but we deal though  
Im tryin to do better now find my inner peace  
Learn my art form and find my inner Chi  
When my backs on the wall I dont freeze up  
Nah I find my inner strength and I reup  
Here we go I know Ive never been the smartest or wisest  
But I realize what it takes  
Never dwell in the dark cause the sun always rises  
But gotta make it to the next day  
Its a feeling that you get in your lungs when you run  
Like youre runnin outta air and your breath wont come  
And you uh wheezin gotta keep it movin  
Find that extra uhn and push your way through it  
  
Ive had bad habits but I dropped em I dropped em  
Ive had opponents but I knocked them out  
I climbed the highest mountains  
I swum the coldest seas  
There aint a thing Ive faced thats been too much for me  
  
but we say  
Nobodys gonna see me comin  
Nobodys gonna hear a sound  
No matter how hard they tryin  
Nobodys gonna bring me down  
  
Nobodys gonna see me comin  
Nobodys gonna hear a sound  
No matter how hard they tryin  
No stoppin me since Ive found  
My inner ninja 4x  
  
Ive had bad habits but I dropped em I dropped em  
Ive had opponents but I knocked them out  
I climbed the highest mountains  
I swum the coldest seas  
There aint a thing Ive faced thats been too much for me  
  
Man that was dope  
You think  
Whatre you like a third degree black belt  
Actually Im not even in karate but Ive found My inner ninja
