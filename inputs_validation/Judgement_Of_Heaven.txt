A lonely cry for help reaching out for help to anyone  
A silent prayer to God to help you on your way  
Ive been depressed so long  
Its hard to remember when I was happy  
Ive felt like suicide a dozen times or more  
But thats the easy way thats the selfish way  
the hardest part is to get on with your life  
  
Youre searching in the dark  
clutching at straws to find a way  
You take the Tarot cards and throw them to the wind  
  
Your questions your beliefs  
your inner thoughts your whole existence  
And if there is a God then answer if you will  
And tell me of my fate tell me of my place  
Tell me if Ill ever rest in peace  
  
If you could live your life again  
Would you change a thing or leave all the same  
If you had the chance again  
Would you change a thing at all  
When you look back at your past  
Can you say that you are proud of what weve done  
Are there times when you believe  
That the right you thought was wrong  
  
All of my life I have believed  
Judgment of Heaven is waiting for me
