She was only 17  
Wild at heart and following her dreams  
Believing she was pretty  
Got a ticket to the city  
Where shed find her place on the cover of a magazine  
  
It was only a chat room but it would lead the way  
To the door of a man where shed throw it all away  
He said theyd take it slow  
But little did she know  
Shed be all used up by the end of the day  
  
But she was strong  
And she would survive  
Ambition would be her drive  
And she said  
  
Ill make a way  
Ill do whatever it takes  
Even though it wont be easy  
I have a plan and though I may not understand  
Someday Ill make a way  
  
Where did she go wrong how did she get here  
Livin hard and looking older than her years  
Miss Little Big Town  
Trying to hold a job down  
Doing what she could to choke her fears  
  
But she was strong  
And she would survive  
A spark of hope had kept her dream alive  
And she cried  
  
Ill make a way  
Ill do whatever it takes  
Even though it wont be easy  
I have a plan and though I may not understand  
Someday Ill make a way  
Someday Ill make a way  
  
Walking down the road  
In the city where shed come with so much hope  
Her vision had long died  
Along with all her pride  
And she found herself at the end of her rope  
  
But she heard angels through the door  
Of a church shed passed a million times before  
There was a song of heaven ringing  
And soon she found herself believing  
That out there maybe there was something more  
  
So she bowed her head to pray  
And said Jesus please make a way  
  
And she heard Him say  
  
Ill make a way  
Ill do whatever it takes  
Even though it wont be easy  
I have a plan and though you may not understand  
Today Ill make a way  
  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Today Hell make a way
