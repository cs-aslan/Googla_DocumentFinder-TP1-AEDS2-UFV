Since she was seventeen  
I was her guy  
She was the light of my life  
Well of all the silly games  
We used to play  
Love was the first thing we prized  
So unexpectedly became a thief  
I heard these things happen  
But never to me  
Left me walking in shadows  
Stumblin blind  
Searching for ways to get by  
Got to find me a girl  
Who can change my world  
And make make it all worthwhile  
Take it all away  
And my heart see clear  
Love is the last thing  
Its just the last thing  
Love is the last thing to go  
See all the lights laid out  
Below my feet  
The citys so quiet tonight  
Someone is waiting for me down there  
Its time to get back in this life  
Got to find me a girl  
Who can change my world  
And make make it all worthwhile  
Take it all away  
And its all so clear  
Love is the last thing  
Its just the last thing  
Love is the last thing  
Oohoohooh  
Oh its just the last thing  
Love love is the last thing to go  
Love its the last thing
