im not cheating  
  
Oooh oooh  
Everything is dinky doo  
Everything you do  
You the king of ladida  
Pretty very out far  
Never oversits he understands  
Like the back of the hand  
He should sing in a band oh yeah  
  
Oooh oooh  
People think hes loopey loo  
And when they look at his shoes  
Hes a rocking sausage roll  
He gets it in the goal  
Healthy little brown affair  
And when he washes his hair  
Hell get a round or a square  
Get them singing  
  
Oooh oooh  
Everyone from oxford town  
Way down to the rio grande  
  
Knows his harbour quays  
His skin tight hands without seggs  
His name is legs  
  
talking  
  
Oooh oooh  
Coolies sweating in hong kong  
Run along to the mardi grass  
  
Risking asian flu to meet the man  
Who lays the eggs  
His name is legs  
  
Hes a cure for whooping cough  
And if the going gets rough  
Get lined up come sikh come czar  
No matter who you are  
We could get along and slide a rule  
And if you dont play fools  
While larry plays pool  
Youll hear him singing  
  
Oooh oooh  
talking  
Oooh oooh
