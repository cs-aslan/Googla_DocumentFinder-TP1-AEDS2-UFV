I saw jesus on the cross on a hill called calvary  
do you hate mankind for what they done to you   
He said talk of love not hate things to do  its getting late  
Ive so little time and Im only passing through  
Passing through passing through  
Sometimes happy sometimes blue  
Glad that I ran into you  
Tell the people that you saw me passing through  
I saw adam leave the garden with an apple in his hand  
I said now youre out what are you going to do   
plant some crops and pray for rain maybe raise a little cane  
Im an orphan now and Im only passing through  
Passing through passing through   
I was with washington at valley ford shivering in the snow  
I said how come the men here suffer like they do   
men will suffer men will fight even die for what is right  
Even though they know theyre only passing through  
Passing through passing through   
I was with franklin roosevelts side on the night before he died  
He said one world must come out of world war two ah the fool  
yankee russian white or tan he said a man is still a man  
Were all on one road and were only passing through  
Passing through passing through   
lets do it one more time  
Passing through passing through
