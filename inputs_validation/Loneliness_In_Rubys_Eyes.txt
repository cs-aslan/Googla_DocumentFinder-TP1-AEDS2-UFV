They say she came all the way from Dallas  
But I see more than Texas in the hard times on her face  
And every song she sings brings back a hundred thousand memories  
Of another girl another time another place  
She does not have the body of the woman I once loved  
But shes still the girl that I once idolized  
And I swear I see a little bit of every girl Ive known  
In the loneliness of Rubys eyes in the loneliness of Rubys eyes  
  
Kin folks say shes had a lot of lovers  
But love dont leave a woman filled with shame  
And Ive heard tell she had a child in Dallas  
And all the men in Houston know her name  
She does not have the body  
In the loneliness of Rubys eyes in the loneliness of Rubys eyes  
In the loneliness of Rubys eyes
