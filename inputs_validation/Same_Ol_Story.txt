People slippin in the rain  
I watch them get up again  
It makes me feel like I can too  
Hey hey ya  
  
Just when I get off the ground  
Your back tryin to put me down  
Like some simpleton you can use  
Hey  
  
Chorus  
Well Its the same old fucking story  
With your two different sets of rules  
The same old fucking story  
One for me two for you  
Its the same old fucking story  
Its the same old fucking story all around yeah  
  
Still some glory in my eyes  
Much to everyones surprise  
After everything you put me through  
Yeah well  
Friends tell me youve been around  
Big fish in a big ol town  
Gobble up all in one fair swoop yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah  
Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah  
Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah  
Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah  
  
Still some glory in my eyes  
Much to everyones surprise  
After everything you put me through  
Yeah well  
Friends tell me youve been around  
Big fish in a big ol town  
Gobble up all in one fair swoop yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Its the same fucking story know damn well its true  
Same ol same ol same ol same ol same ol  
  
Chorus
