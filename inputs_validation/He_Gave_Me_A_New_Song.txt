He gave me a new song  
He really came down here  
Himself and sang it for me  
In every key  
Just for me he gave me a new light  
Now even when clouds hide the sun my life is still bright  
Cause everythings alright  
He gave me a new song  
He really came down here  
Himself and sang it for me  
In every key  
Just for me  
He gave me a love song  
Yes its the first real love song given to me  
And oh what a melody
