Ive been a simple man and Ive been insane  
And Ive been a vagabond and Ive been a king yeah  
But Ive been a better man just tryin to please the stranger I love  
  
Lost in a wilderness darker than pain drawn to her loneliness just like a
flame  
The closer we come the more that I learn the stranger I love  
Bad as I loved her I aint afraid well be together some lovin way  
  
Ill be her lover just as long as I can then when its over shell need a
friend  
So Ill take her handmedowns Ill take the blame  
Ill be a hangaround I aint ashamed  
Cause the longer I love her the more I believe the stranger I love
