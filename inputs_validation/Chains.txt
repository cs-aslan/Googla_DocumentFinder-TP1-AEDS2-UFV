Chains  
That try to bind me  
Chains  
That wont let me go  
Oh Chains  
They keep me from trying  
Chains  
Please loose your stronghold  
Chains  
Though I try to surrender  
Chains  
Yet still I remember  
Whom the Son sets free  
Is truly free indeed  
Lord free me from these chains  
  
Chains  
And a heart full of sorrow  
Chains  
I wont sleep well tonight because of these  
Chains  
How I long for tomorrow  
Cause today  
There are no tears left to cry  
Chains  
Though it feels cold as winter  
Chains  
I will fight to remember  
That by your stripes  
Im healed  
To your heart Lord I appeal  
Please free me from these chains  
  
Of abuse Chains  
Of suicide Chains  
Pain from my past Chains  
That robbed my peace of mind Chains  
Chains of divorce Chains  
Addiction and fear Oh Chains  
Being afraid to die Chains  
And afraid to live Chains  
Chains of depression Chains  
Havent laughed in a while Chains  
Restore my joy Chains  
And give me back my smile Ooh Chains  
I do love you Jesus Chains  
But not like I should Chains  
I love you forever Chains  
But not like I could Chains  
Have mercy on me Chains  
Cant go on this way Chains  
Save me Im lost Chains  
Help me believe what you say Chains  
This is just a test Chains  
Though its hard to see Chains  
I surrender your will Chains  
So now I ask you please  
Free me from these  
Oh please free me from these  
Oh free me from these  
  
I know you can  
You said you will  
Free me  
Jesus  
I know you can  
Please if you will  
Free me  
Jesus  
I believe you can  
I believe you will  
Free me  
Jesus  
So if you can  
I pray you will  
Free me  
Jesus  
  
Please Lord Im begging you  
Free me from  
Oh free me from from these  
Free me from these
