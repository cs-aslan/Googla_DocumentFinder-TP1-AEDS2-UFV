I decree today that life  
Is simply taking and not giving  
England is mine  it owes me a living  
But ask me why and Ill spit in your eye  
Oh ask me why and Ill spit in your eye  
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore  
No we cannot cling to those dreams  
  
Does the body rule the mind  
Or does the mind rule the body  
I dunno  
  
Under the iron bridge we kissed  
And although I ended up with sore lips  
It just wasnt like the old days anymore  
No it wasnt like those days  
Am I still ill  
Oh  
Am I still ill  
Oh  
  
Does the body rule the mind  
Or does the mind rule the body  
I dunno  
  
Ask me why and Ill die  
Oh ask me why and Ill die  
And if you must go to work  tomorrow  
Well if I were you I wouldnt bother  
For there are brighter sides to life  
And I should know because Ive seen them  
But not very often  
Under the iron bridge we kissed  
And although I ended up with sore lips  
It just wasnt like the old days anymore  
No it wasnt like those days  
Am I still ill  
Oh  
Oh am I still ill  
Oh
