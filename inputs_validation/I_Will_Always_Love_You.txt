If I should stay Ill only be in your way  
So Ill go but I know Ill  
Think of you every step of the way  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
You my darling you hmmm  
  
Bittersweet memories  
That is all Im taking with me  
So goodbye  
Please dont cry  
We both know Im not what you you need  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
  
I hope life treats you kind  
And I hope you have all youve dreamed of  
And I wish to you joy and happiness  
But above all this I wish you love  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I I will always love you  
  
You darling I love you  
Oh Ill always Ill always love you
