AJ  
The first night that we met  
I will never forget  
Baby you were a star  
From that point in time  
It was always you and I shining  
So beautiful  
When were out with your friends  
You treat me like Im dead  
It was like Im invisible  
  
Nick  
I cant let it go  
That was unforgettable  
I cant let it go  
I just wanna let you know  
I cant let it go  
Situations unlivable  
I cant let it go  
I cant let it go  
I cant let it go  
  
Chorus  
Tell me what you say that you want me  
All you ever do girl is push all my buttons  
You always bring me down in public  
When nobodys around you say that you love me  
Make me say oh no  
I see you all alone  
Im halfway out the door  
Unless you turn around  
And you treat me right  
  
Brian  
Oh you got me twisted  
Oh you got me twisted  
Im not someone you can just disrespect  
How would you feel if you were in my shoes  
Feelin used with your heart bruised  
  
Nick  
I cant let it go  
The situations critical  
I cant let it go  
Relationship is pitiful  
I cant let it go  
Everythings falling apart  
I cant let it go  
Cause youre so hypocritical  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
All  
Youre just no good for me  
Youre no good for me  
Youre just no good for me  
I know youre no good for me  
  
Howie  
You know  
Its wrong to treat me cold  
Ive no one to hold  
One day Im gonna say goodbye  
Whats it gonna be  
Girl Im gonna leave  
Unless you turn around  
And treat me right  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Howie  
Just treat me right  
Just treat me right  
  
Brian  
Say that you want me  
  
Howie  
Just treat me right  
Just treat me right  
  
Repeat Chorus
