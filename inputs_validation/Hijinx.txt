I just found out  
Its been too long now  
The word is out  
Time before didnt they take us hook and punker  
Their jive alive lines  
They were funk  
They were hijinx hijinx hijinx tonight  
We all know better but we just might  
  
Pullin this off its gonna take some  
Big time schemin  
A fast tap dance our feetll be steamin  
Hijinx hijinx hijinx alright  
Hi hi hijinx yeah yeah  
  
You never know behind the lines  
Whos gonna show  
Scandal highs been buzzin through the mayhem  
Tonight the word we heard is  
It might be them  
They were hijinx hijinx hijinx tonight  
They all know better but we just might  
  
Pullin this off its gonna take some  
Big time schemin  
A fast tap dance our feetll be steamin  
  
Hijinx hijinx hijinx alright  
Hi hi hijinx yeah yeah
