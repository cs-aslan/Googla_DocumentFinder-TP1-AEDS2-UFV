Heyhey its the tall sail  
On a beach reach for java  
Make way for to Java  
Watching for Boogies  
Heyhey its a dreaming  
I would burn you if you should die  
Heyhey I would burn too  
If you should lie upon that bamboo pyre  
  
Chorus  
I dream of Amlapura  
Never saw in all my life a more shining jewel  
I dream of Amlapura  
Of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone  
  
Heyhey golden roses around  
A rajahs mouth  
Heyhey all the dead children buried standing  
A flying Dutchman  
Smoking gun and spice wind  
  
Chorus  
  
I dream of Amlapura  
Of a princess in stone  
Heyhey its a tall ship  
Heyhey  
Heyhey  
Amlapura
