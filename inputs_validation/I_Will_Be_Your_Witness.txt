I woke up this morning  
Wishing you were here  
Another cup of coffee  
And then you appeared  
  
A crystal vision  
Shining through the rain  
Smiling through my window pane  
  
In the morning traffic  
I turn on the radio  
And the song thats playing  
Is one that we used to know  
  
When we were dancing slowly  
Under the mirror ball  
You were singing to me  
I felt like we had it all  
  
It was our adventure  
I wont let it slip away  
Gonna make it like it was before this day  
  
I will be your witness  
That much I can do That much I can do  
I want to tell the world I just want to tell the world  
How much Im missing you  
  
I will be your witness  
Dont you know its true Dont you know its true  
I want to testify I just want to testify  
How much Im loving you  
  
Did you ever notice  
Just what you mean to me  
Youre the piece of the puzzle  
That makes my world complete  
  
I need your freedom  
I need your company  
Let me tell you how its going to be  
  
I will be your witness  
That much I can do That much I can do  
I want to tell the world I just want to tell the world  
How much Im missing you  
  
Ill be your alibi tonight  
Ill make everything all right  
I will be your defense  
When life makes no sense  
Baby you just wait and see  
Its a crazy crazy world  
  
Woke up this morning  
Wishing you were here  
Poured a cup of coffee  
And then you appeared  
  
Such a great adventure  
I wont let it slip away  
You know I need you every night and every day  
  
I will be your witness  
That much I can do That much I can do  
I want to tell the world I just want to tell the world  
How much Im missing you  
  
I will be your witness  
Dont you know its true Dont you know its true  
I want to testify I just want to testify  
How much Im loving you  
  
I will be your witness I will be your witness  
What else can I do What else can I do  
I just want to tell the world  
How much Im loving you
