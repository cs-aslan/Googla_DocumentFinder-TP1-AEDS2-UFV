I cant stand the sight of you  
I cant stand what you put me through  
Your lifes a lie that you hide  
Is it that terrible being you inside  
I cant stand oh the thought of you  
I cant stand all the things you do  
What do you try to justify  
  
You are just too scared to be you inside  
Let it all go  
I look at you  
All I see is a man too afraid to really be  
I cant stand what you put me through  
I cant stand even the thought of you  
Your secret lies that you hide  
Is it that terrible being you inside  
Let it all go  
  
You try so hard to be wanted  
False emotions tells you fronted  
I think being a person relies on one thing  
  
Be yourself let you come through  
Youre too afraid to really be  
Someone who isnt false and doesnt care to be  
Be yourself let you come through  
Fake
