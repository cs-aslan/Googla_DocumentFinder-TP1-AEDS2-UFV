In spite of all the danger in spite of all that may be  
Ill do anything for you anything you want me to  
If youll be true to me  
  
In spite of all the heartache that you may cause me  
Ill do anything for you anything you want me to  
If youll be true to me  
  
Ill look after you like Ive never done before  
Ill keep all the others from knockin at your door  
  
In spite of all the danger in spite of all that may be  
Ill do anything for you anything you want me to  
If youll be true to me  
  
In spite of all the heartache that you may cause me  
Ill do anything for you anything you want me to  
If youll be true to me  
Ill do anything for you anything you want me to  
If youll be true to me
