On a windy day lets go on flying  
There may be no trees to rest on  
There may be no clouds to ride  
But well have our wings and the wind will be with us  
Thats enough for me  
Thats enough for me  
  
On a windy day we went flying  
There was no sea to rest on  
There were no hills to glide  
We saw an empty bottle rolling down the street  
And on a cupboard stand at the corner of the street  
Wrinkled souls piled up like grapefruits
