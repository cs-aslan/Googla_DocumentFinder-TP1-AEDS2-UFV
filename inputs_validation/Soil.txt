The phoenix he helped create  
Out of control boy without a dad  
Shot the gun that startled my life  
While I drove him with a fortyfive  
  
Friends for years images in red  
Blew off his own motherfuckin head  
Confidence death insecurity  
Men fall unrealized  
Unrealized unrealized  
  
Making a decision of death  
While everyone around you pled  
Now you fly in peace  
I hope my friend  
A man cant avoid what hes meant to do  
When hes meant to do it  
Even if he doesnt really want to  
My memories are of fun and friendship  
Of weakness within the strength of youth  
For reasons undefined reasons undefined  
Reasons undefined reasons undefined  
  
Friends for years images in red  
Blew off his own motherfuckin head  
Confidence death insecurity  
Men fall unrealized  
  
Dont you realize  
Evil lives in the mfucking skin  
Dont you realize  
Evil lives in the mfucking skin  
  
Unrealized unrealized  
  
Dont you realize evil  
Lives in the motherfucking skin  
Dont you realize  that evil  
Lives in the motherfucking
