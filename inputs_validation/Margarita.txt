I see you in the front row dancing up and down  
Youre ripped and ready for the night downtown  
And all the pretty boys are chasing you around  
Cause they all wanna win your affections  
  
You spent three hours getting ready for the show  
Nothing on underneath and everybody knows  
Mama said wear a coat or catch your death of cold  
Whats wrong with a little flirtation  
  
Chorus  
And then you smile at me  
Is that a wink I see  
Did I catch your eye  
Should I even try  
Oh My Margarita Margarita  
Like to meet you Margarita  
Margarita Margarita  
Think I need you Margarita  
  
Take your time dance real slow  
Remember that song from the radio  
Got your old mans got a place to go  
Cause we all need a little temptation  
  
Those two big fellas are looking for a fight  
Its what they like to do on a Saturday night  
Maybe its the alcohol maybe its the lights  
But they just want to get your attention  
  
Chorus  
  
Talk to me  baby its all right  
I might look strange but I dont bite  
And if you let me hold your hand  
I can find a way to make you understand  
  
Called last call now its time to go  
But Im not the guy who gets to walk you home  
We could have made history I guess well never know  
Ill see you in dreams  
  
Oh my Margarita Margarita  
Like to meet you Margarita  
Margarita Margarita  
Think I need you Margarita  
Oh my Margarita Margarita  
Like to meet you Margarita  
Margarita Margarita  
Think I need You Margarita
