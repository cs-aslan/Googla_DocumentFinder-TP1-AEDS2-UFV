When I think of Lorelei my head turns all around  
As gentle as a butterfly she moves without a sound  
I call her on the telephone she says be there by eight  
Tonights the night shes movin in and I can hardly wait  
  
The way she moves oohoohooh I gotta say  
  
Lorelei lets live together  
Brighter than the stars forever  
Lorelei lets live together  
Brighter than the stars forever  
Oh baby forever  
  
Her eyes become a paradise she softly speaks my name  
She brightens every lonely night no ones quite the same  
She calls me on the telephone she says be there by eight  
Tonights the night shes movin in its time to celebrate  
  
The way she moves oohoohooh I gotta say  
  
Lorelei lets live together  
Brighter than the stars forever  
Lorelei lets live together  
Brighter than the stars forever  
Baby baby forever  
  
Lorelei lets live together  
Brighter than the stars forever  
Lorelei lets live together  
Brighter than the stars forever  
Lorelei lets live together  
Brighter than the stars forever  
Lorelei lets live together  
Brighter than the stars forever  
Lorelei lets live together  
Brighter than the stars forever
