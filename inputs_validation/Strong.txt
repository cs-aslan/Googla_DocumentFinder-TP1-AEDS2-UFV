My breath smells of a thousand fags  
And when Im drunk I dance like me dad  
Ive started to dress a bit like him  
  
Early morning when I wake up  
I look like kiss but without the make up  
And thats a good line to take it to  
The bridge  
  
And you know and you know  
Cause my lifes a mess  
And Im trying to grow so before  
Im old Ill confess  
  
You think that Im strong youre wrong  
Youre wrong  
Ill sing my song my song my song  
  
My beds full of takeaways and fantasies  
Of easy lays  
The pause buttons broke on my video  
And is this real cause I feel fake  
Oprah Winfrey Ricki Lake  
Teach me things I dont need to know  
  
And you know and you know  
Cause my lifes a mess  
And its starting to show so before  
Im old Ill confess  
  
You think that Im strong youre wrong  
Youre wrong  
Ill sing my song my song my song  
  
If I did it all again Id be a nun  
The rain was never cold when I was young  
Im still young were still young  
Lifes too short to be afraid  
Step inside the sun  
  
And you know and you know  
Cause my lifes a mess  
And Im trying to grow  
  
And you know and you know  
Cause my lifes a mess  
And Im trying to grow  
  
And you know and you know  
Cause my lifes a mess  
And Im trying to grow  
  
You think that Im strong youre wrong  
Youre wrong  
Ill sing my song my song my song  
  
You think that Im strong youre wrong  
Youre wrong  
Ill sing my song my song my song  
  
Lifes too short to be afraid  
So take a pill to numb the pain  
You dont have to take the blame  
  
Lifes too short to be afraid  
So take a pill to numb the pain  
You dont have to take the blame  
  
Lifes too short to be afraid  
So take a pill to numb the pain  
You dont have to take the blame
