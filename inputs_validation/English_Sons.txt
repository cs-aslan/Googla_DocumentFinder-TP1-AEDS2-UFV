One two three four  
  
Girl on the edge flippin off the lamp  
Therell be an end darling to your endless night  
On the other side of the street  
Yea the light on your portrait and the light in your face  
And youll be looking for another pretty place  
Baby this side of the street  
  
Well keep dreaming baby that your desire brings and girl  
I know the sadness that you find in things its true  
Well baby if you cant take the heat what can I do  
  
Well you and your poetry and your boku world  
Behind the face you hide the face of a modern girl  
On the other side of the street  
Yea youve got the look as if you owe the world  
Therefore you go out there and say what you can earn  
On the wrong side of the street  
  
Well you tire of every day bringing the same and so you  
Go out looking for some strange new games  
Well pretty soon you dont know the score anymore  
  
All right now guitar break  
  
I know the danger that your desire brings  
And I know the strangeness that youll find  
Wait and it will seem straighter for you and for me  
Well turn on the end and baby turn off the lamps  
Therell be an end darling to this endless night  
On the other side of the street  
  
Yea and everyday well it just brings the same  
You started looking for some very strange new games  
On the wrong side of the street  
Well you and your desires lead to confusion  
Well walk away as I dont follow your illusions  
And see open your eyes and see girl  
  
All right
