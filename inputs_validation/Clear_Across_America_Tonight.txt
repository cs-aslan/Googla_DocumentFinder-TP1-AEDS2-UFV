Just outside of Austin  
I turned on my radio  
Turned it in to a satellite station  
She was talkin on a callin show  
She said it was over shed made her choice  
Her mind was madeup by the sound of her voice  
  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear coasttocoast tonight  
Shes long gone shes outta here  
But shes comin through loud and clear  
Clear across America tonight  
  
Sounded like he really had it coming  
All the times hed done her wrong  
She said I hope hes listening  
And hungup the telephone  
All of a sudden I realized  
It was me she was telling goodbye  
  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear coasttocoast tonight  
Shes long gone shes outta here  
But shes comin through loud and clear  
Clear across America tonight  
  
Hello DJ put me on the air  
Give me the chance to tell her I still care  
Get her back on the line tell her Im still in love  
Said sorry son but youre breaking up  
  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear coasttocoast tonight  
Shes long gone shes outta here  
But shes comin through loud and clear  
Across America tonight  
  
Across America tonight  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear across America tonight
