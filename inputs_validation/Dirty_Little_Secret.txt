I been thinkin  
How youre wastin  
All that lovin on someone else  
I cant take it  
  
I will make you  
Forget all about the one Ill be replacin  
So just say it  
  
I know youve been thinkin bout it  
I see you lookin around  
I will give you  
What youre missin  
What you see in me when you think no ones watchin  
  
Dont wait too long  
Im not that strong  
I cant hold on  
Much longer  
  
Chorus  
Oh dont wait too long  
I see it now  
I know your dirty little secret  
Oh dont wait too long  
I got you now  
I found your dirty little secret  
  
You dont touch  
You dont talk  
You dont look me in the face  
Your dirty little secret  
  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
I dont care  
What they say  
Ill deal with anythin  
If it gets you next to me  
  
I dont want  
Just a taste  
I want you anytime I feel a little craving  
  
Im not that strong  
I cant hold on  
  
Chorus  
Oh dont wait too long  
I see it now  
I know your dirty little secret  
Oh dont wait too long  
I got you now  
I found your dirty little secret  
  
You never touch  
You never talk  
You never look me in the face  
Your dirty little secret  
  
What are you hiding in your covers  
Like to wait little lover  
What will you do when they discover your eyes on another  
Why you runnin round in circles  
Tryin so hard to discourage  
Tellin secrets thatll surface  
One way or another  
  
Chorus  
Oh I see it now  
I know your dirty little secret  
Oh Oh I got you now  
I found your dirty little secret  
  
You never touch  
You never talk  
You never look me in the face  
  
You never touch  
You never talk to me  
You never look me in the face  
  
Your dirty little secret  
Na na na na na na na  
Dirty dirty secret  
Na na na na  
Dirty  
Na na na na na na na  
Dirty
