Look out  
Mama let me out on a Saturday night she said now  
Go out and get her go and hold her tight  
I said now Mama you dont understand  
Evry time I touch her hand  
Its like Im burning in the fires of hell  
And if I hold her too long  
You never can tell whatll happen to me  
I wouldnt want you to see  
  
Look out  
Shes a hell raiser star chaser trail blazer  
Natural born raver yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Shes a hell raiser star chaser trail blazer  
Natural born raver yeah yeah yeah  
Look out  
  
Shes like a live bomb shell  
Like a flash out of hell  
And when shes shaking her ooh  
Everyone fell at her feet  
And thats neat and she took me completely  
By surprise with her ultra sonic eyes  
That were flashing like hysterical danger signs  
That said beware where you tread  
Or youll go out of your head  
  
Look out  
Shes a hell raiser star chaser trail blazer  
Natural born raver yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Shes a hell raiser star chaser trail blazer  
Natural born raver yeah yeah yeah  
Look out  
  
Hell raiser hell raiser hell raiser  
Hell raiser hell raiser ooh  
Now Mama you dont understand  
Evry time I touch her hand  
Its like Im burning in the fires of hell  
And if I hold her too long  
You never can tell whatll happen to me  
I wouldnt want you to see
