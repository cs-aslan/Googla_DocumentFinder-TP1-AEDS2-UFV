You can take your time  
Ill be takin mine  
We dont have to hurry  
  
Let the world go by  
Tonight its you and I  
Feelin others slowly  
  
And though a simple touch  
Can mean so much  
Says all you need to know  
  
We got all night  
We got from sundown to sunrise  
So dont let go just hold me baby  
We got all night  
Lets make it last forever  
Take it nice and slow  
We got all night  
  
Its so good to know  
You dont have to go  
Stay until tomorrow  
  
Lying side by side  
Feel the senses slide  
Let your feelings follow  
  
Cause tonight is ours  
And through the hours  
Love goes on and on  
  
We got all night  
We got from sundown to sunrise  
So dont let go just hold me baby  
We got all night  
Lets make it last forever  
Take it nice and slow  
We got all night  
  
Feels like we waited a lifetime  
To be alone tonight  
So make it hard to forget you  
Cause we dont know when  
We can do it again  
  
We got all night  
We got from sundown to sunrise  
So dont let go just hold me baby  
We got all night  
Lets make it last forever  
Take it nice and slow  
  
All night  
All night  
  
We got all night  
We got from sundown to sunrise  
So dont let go just hold me baby  
We got all night  
Lets make it last forever  
Take it nice and slow  
  
We got all night  
We got from sundown to sunrise  
So dont let go just hold me baby  
We got all night  
Lets make it last forever  
Take it nice and slow
