A live begins anothers over  
As another day begins  
Life runs full circle getting older  
It happens to me  
It happens to you  
I do believe youre still around me  
Youre still around me all the time  
I have no doubt one day in heaven  
I will see you again  
Ill see you again see you again  
Break the bread drink the wine  
In my heart youll live forever  
The time to go is never right  
When we say goodbye  
While were here we shouldnt waste  
A day in life to say I love you  
Its now that Id just wish so much to see you  
Eye to eye  
When you came home the war was over  
So many years before my time  
I was so proud the day you told me  
You havent hurt anyone  
No one  
Break the bread drink the wine  
In my heart youll live forever  
The time to go is never right  
When we say goodbye  
While were here we shouldnt waste  
A day in life to say I love you  
Its now that Id just wish so much to see you  
Eye to eye
