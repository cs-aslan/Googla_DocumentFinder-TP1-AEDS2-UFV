Im taking over my body  
Back in control no more shotty  
I bet a lot of me was lost  
Ts uncrossed and Is undotted  
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot  
Like flesh is all I got  
Not any more flesh out the door  
  
I musta forgot you cant trust me  
Im momenttomoment and close but dont show it  
Before you know it Im lost at sea  
And now that I write and think about it  
And the story unfolds  
You should take my life  
You should take my soul  
  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Sounding down the mountain range  
Of my leftside brain  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Twisting the kaleidoscope  
Behind both of my eyes  
  
And Ill be holding on to you  
  
Remember the moment  
You know exactly where youre goin  
Cause the next moment before you know it  
Time is slowin and its rolling still  
And the windowsill looks really nice right  
You think twice about your life  
It probably happens at night right  
  
Fight it take the pain ignite it  
Tie a noose around your mind  
Loose enough to breath fine and tie it  
To a tree tell it  
You belong to me this aint a noose  
This is a leash and I have news for you  
You must obey me  
  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Sounding down the mountain range  
Of my leftside brain  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Twisting the kaleidoscope  
Behind both of my eyes  
  
Entertain my faith  
  
Lean with it rock with it  
When we gonna stop with it  
Lyrics that mean nothing  
We were gifted with thought  
  
Is it time to move our feet  
To an introspective beat  
It aint the speakers that bump hard  
Its our hearts that make the beat  
  
And Ill be holding on to you
