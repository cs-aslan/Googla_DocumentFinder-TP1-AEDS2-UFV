I wanna tell you listen listen up  
I want you to know were serious

Listen  
From us to you  
  
For a little grip now we been rocking your ass  
The future aint scary cause we got the past  
Cant nothing ever take away the Gatherings  
You can take whats happening now  
Not what Im rapping about  
And I remember every Hallowicked to a T  
And every Project Born Marz Esham and Myzery  
And even though I dont remember your name  
From the in store  
Swear to God I couldnt love you anymore  
Do you mention the Abyss at Virginia Beach  
And out of state youre so hot Juggalos reach  
Juggalos reach  
And what about the Bronco Bowl in Deep Ellem  
And that crazy ass house club in Houston Tell them  
Twenty thousand websites hotlines and clubs  
Gang bangers codes nobodys and scrubs  
To every last Juggalette that turned me out  
Thank you much and I hope to see you on the next route  
You know everybody hates on this world of ours  
And if you learn one thing from the Joker Cards  
Let it be the other shit is six different views  
Diamond any way you choose  
And we love you  
  
Chorus  
I guess its time  
That I told you  
How great you are  
I guess its time  
That I told you  
How great you are  
  
They told me to sing it any way I could bring  
Hurry up

Open up your earlobes  
ICP

Rubber game  
  
Listen  
  
Me and Krayzie Bone we marinade in the flats  
Representing Cleveland and we could press your stats  
I rock trees frog shop  
I rock the octave  
Nautica and Theo four times ten Who  
Every time we play Denver cars get rolled over  
Juggalos get pissed when the shows over  
Even cities that I leave they not letting me in  
They let me know if they a Juggalo  
Through thick and through thin  
I like Twiztid  
Independent  
Free standing  
And always down to give a helping hand in  
And to everybody else out there do your thing  
Cause it aint no ducking when the hatchet swings  
We try to sing we try to rap  
We try to rock and spit  
Cant get enough of this wicked shit  
Even if we foggy and we still aint clear  
In three years later youll look back and tip us a beer  
  
Chorus  
  
I wanna tell you I love all the letters yall  
Got them hung up on the fridge  
And all up on the garage wall  
What about these minigatherings we hear  
Yall dont be surprised when we walk up in there  
With Vampiro and Sabu flying above  
Representing the Juggalos with nothing but love  
On TV they make them try to hide their shit  
But real Juggalos always bear the hatchet  
And all the fresh titty bars DJs with mullets  
All nuts while we there but you hate us and love them  
Yes you groupie as fuck and good to go  
But dont get excited thinking makes you a Juggalo  
Yes we gather once a year big top above  
We give shit like Big Silva nothing but love  
But you gotta be fresh and with open mind  
Or your ass get left behind  
Thats why I love yall  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X
