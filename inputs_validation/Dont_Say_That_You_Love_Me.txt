Im gonna tell you right up front  
So you will understand  
I aint gonna waste your time  
Cause I might not be your man  
We wont go makin promises  
Cause you know it just aint right  
A promise is a promise girl  
And tonight is just tonight  
Tonight is just tonight  
  
Chorus  
Dont say that you love me  
If it dont feel right  
Dont say that you love me  
Just hold me tonight  
  
There aint no need for broken hearts  
I know in time they mend  
Any fool can fall in love  
Its so easy to pretend  
Dont tell me Im the only one  
If it doesnt mean a thing  
Lets take tonight for what its worth  
And see what tomorrow brings  
And see what tomorrow brings  
  
Chorus
