Longer than therve been fishes in the ocean  
Higher than any bird ever flew  
Longer than thereve been stars up in the heavens  
Ive been in love with you  
  
Stronger than any mountain cathedral  
Truer than any tree ever grew  
Deeper than any forest primeval  
I am in love with you  
  
Ill bring fire in the winters  
Youll send showers in the springs  
Well fly through the falls and summers with love on our wings  
  
Through the years as the fire starts to mellow  
Burning lines in the book of our lives  
Though the binding cracks  
And the pages start to yellow  
Ill be in love with you  
Ill be in love with you  
  
Longer than therve been fishes in the ocean  
Higher than any bird ever flew  
Longer than thereve been stars up in the heavens  
Ive been in love with you  
I am in love with you
