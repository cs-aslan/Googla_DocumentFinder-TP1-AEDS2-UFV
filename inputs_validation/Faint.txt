I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard  
Handful of complaints but I cant help the fact  
That everyone can see these scars  
I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel  
But its like no matter what I do I cant convince you  
To just believe this is real  
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do  
Face away and pretend Im not  
But Ill be here cause youre all that Ive got  
  
Chorus  
I cant feel the way I did before  
Dont turn your back on me  
I wont be ignored  
Time wont heal this damage anymore  
Dont turn your back on me I wont be ignored  
  
I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident  
Cause you dont understand I do what I can  
But sometimes I dont make sense  
I am what you never want to say but Ive never had a doubt  
Its like no matter what I do I cant convince you for once just to hear me
out  
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do  
You face away and pretend Im not  
But Ill be here cause youre all that Ive got  
  
Chorus  
  
You hear me out now  
Youre gonna listen to me like it or not  
Right now hear me out now  
Youre gonna listen to me like it or not  
Right now  
  
Chorus x3
