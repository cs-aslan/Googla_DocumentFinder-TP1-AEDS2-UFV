Moscows still red  
The young mans dead  
Gone to heaven instead  
The evening news says he was confused  
The motorways will all merge soon  
Lottery winner buys the moon  
Theyve come to save us  
The space invaders are here  
  
He thought of cars  
And where where to drive them  
And who to drive them with  
And there there was no one no one  
  
Theres panic at London Heathrow  
Everybody wants to go up into the blue  
But theres a ten year queue  
Columbia is in top gear  
It shouldnt snow at this time of year  
Now Americas shot gone  
And done the lot  
  
He thought of planes and where  
Where to fly to  
And who to fly there with  
And there there was no one no one
