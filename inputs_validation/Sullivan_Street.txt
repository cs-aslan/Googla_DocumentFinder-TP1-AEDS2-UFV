Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St  
Cross the water and home through the town  
Past the shadows that fall down wherever we meet  
Pretty soon I wont come around  
  
Im almost drowning in her sea  
Shes nearly fallen to her knees  
  
Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St  
Where all the bodies hang on the air  
If she remembers she hides it whenever we meet  
Either way now I dont really care  
  
Im almost drowning in her seas  
Shes nearly crawling on her knees  
Shes down on her knees  
  
Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St  
Im just another rider burned to the ground  
  
Im almost drowning in her sea  
Shes nearly crawling on her knees  
Its almost everything I need  
Im down on my knees  
Im down on my knees
