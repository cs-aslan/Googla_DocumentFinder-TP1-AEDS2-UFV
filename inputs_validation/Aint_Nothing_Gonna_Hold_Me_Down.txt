Last night I had the strangest dream  
I sailed away to China in a little rowboat to find you  
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned  
Didnt want no one to hold you what does that mean  
  
And you said  
Aint nothing gonna break my stride  
Nobodys gonna slow me down  
Oh no Ive got to keep on moving  
Aint nothing gonna break my stride  
Im running and I wont touch ground  
Oh no Ive got to keep on moving  
  
Youre on the road and now you pray youll last  
The road behind you was rocky  
But now youre feeling cocky  
You look at me and youll see your past  
Is that the reason youre running so fast  
  
And she said  
Aint nothing gonna break my stride  
Nobodys gonna slow me down  
Oh no Ive got to keep on moving  
Aint nothing gonna break my stride  
Im running and I wont touch ground  
Oh no Ive got to keep on moving  
  
Never let another girl like you whip me over  
Never let another girl like you drag me under  
If I meet another girl like you I will tell her  
Never want another girl like you have to say  
  
Aint nothing gonna break my stride  
Nobodys gonna slow me down  
Oh no Ive got to keep on moving  
Aint nothing gonna break my stride  
Im running and I wont touch ground  
Oh no Ive got to keep on moving  
  
Aint nothing gonna break my stride  
Nobodys gonna slow me down  
Oh no Ive got to keep on moving  
Aint nothing gonna break my stride  
Im running and I wont touch ground  
Oh no Ive got to keep on moving  
  
Aint nothing gonna break my stride  
Nobodys gonna slow me down  
Oh no Ive got to keep on moving  
Aint nothing gonna break my stride  
Im running and I wont touch ground  
Oh no Ive got to keep on moving
