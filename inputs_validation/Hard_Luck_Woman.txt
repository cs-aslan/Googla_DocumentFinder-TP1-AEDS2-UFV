If never I met you  
Id never have seen you cry  
If not for our first Hello  
Wed never have to say goodbye  
  
If never I held you  
My feelings would never show  
Its time I start walkin  
But theres so much youll never know  
  
I keep telling you hard luck woman  
You aint a hard luck woman  
  
Rags the sailors only daughter  
A child of the water  
Too proud to be a queen  
  
Rags I really love ya  
I cant forget about ya  
Youll be a hard luck woman  
Baby till you find your man  
  
Before I go let me kiss you  
And wipe the tears from your eyes  
I dont want to hurt you girl  
You know I could never lie  
  
I keep telling you hard luck woman  
You aint a hard luck woman  
Youll be a hard luck woman  
Baby till you find your man  
  
Rags the sailors only daughter  
A child of the water  
Too proud to be a queen

Youll be a hard luck woman
