Baby wont you tell me  
What youre tryin to do  
You dont mean to say  
That our love is through  
Because I love you  
Yes I do  
And Ive go to see it through  
  
I live on the mountain  
A hundred mile from town  
Thats a long way to go  
Baby now  
But soon Im gonna be around  
Because I love you  
Yes I do  
And Ive got to see it through  
Baby now  
  
Im gonna steal you baby away with me  
I want to love you  
Because you see  
I am riding on a pony  
In the middle of the night  
Im gonna be there in the morning  
And I hope that its all right  
  
Sometimes when I am lonely  
I think about your face baby  
So I get on my pony  
And I ride over your place  
Because I love you  
Yes I do  
And Ive go to see it through  
  
I want to take you far away  
I want to love you no matter what you say  
Because I am riding on a pony  
In the middle of the night  
Im gonna be there in the morning  
And I hope that its all right  
  
  
I am riding on a pony  
In the middle of the night  
Im gonna be there in the morning  
And I hope that its all right  
  
I am riding on a pony  
In the middle of the night  
Im gonna be there in the morning  
And I hope that its all right
