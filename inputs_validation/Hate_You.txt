Ah Ahh Ahh  
Ahh Ahh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
La la la Ahh Ahh Ooh  
Ahh Ooh  
  
Once upon a time we swore not to say goodbye  
Something got a hold of us and we changed  
Then you sat alone in pride  
And I sat at home and cried  
Howd our fairytale just end up this way  
  
We went round for round till we knocked love out  
We were laying in the ring not making a sound  
And if thats a metaphor of you and I  
Why is it so hard to say goodbye  
  
Chorus  
I cant wait to hate you  
Make you pain like I do  
Still cant shake you off  
I cant wait to break through  
These emotional changes  
Seems like such a lost cause  
I cant wait to face you  
Break you down so low  
Theres no place left to go  
I cant wait to hate you  
Uh uh uh Ah ah ah ahhhhh  
  
Oh this was a love phenomenon no one could explain  
And I wish I could press reset and feel that feeling again  
I sit and press rewind and watch us every night  
Wanna pause it but I cant make it stay  
Just gotta let it play  
  
We went round for round till we knocked love out  
We were laying in the ring not making a sound  
And if thats a metaphor of you and I  
Why is it so hard to say goodbye  
  
Chorus  
I cant wait to hate you  
Make you pain like I do  
Still cant shake you off  
I cant wait to break through  
These emotional changes  
Seems like such a loss cause  
I cant wait to face you  
Break you down so low  
Theres no place left to go  
I cant wait to hate you  
Uh uh uh Ah ah ah ahhh  
  
No need to call my phone cause I changed my number today  
A matter a fact I think Im moving away away  
Sorry the frustrations got me feeling that way  
And I just keep having one last thing to say  
And I just wanna hold you touch you  
Feel you be near you I miss you baby baby baby  
Im tired of trying to fake through  
But theres nothing I can do  
Boy I cant wait to hate you  
  
Chorus  
I cant wait to hate you  
Make you pain like I do  
Still cant shake you off  
I cant wait to break through  
These emotional changes  
Seems like such a lost cause  
I cant wait to face you  
Break you down so low  
Theres no place left to go  
I cant wait to hate you Baby  
Ah ah ah ahhhhh  
  
I cant wait to H A T E You  
Cause right now I need you  
Cant wait to make you go go repeat to end
