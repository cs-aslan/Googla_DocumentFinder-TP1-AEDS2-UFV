Ah its a happy time inside my mind  
When a melody does find a rhyme  
Says to me Im comin home to stay  
Oh Lord home to stay  
Im comin home to stay  
Home to stay  
  
Ah lord its just the same old story  
Something about love for glory  
A nickel and a dime a dozen  
Fame  
Ah its such a shame  
Ah the way they use your name  
Ah you know its such a shame  
When its only mine to sing a song  
Hoping that youd cross along my way  
Before I have to move along  
Ah now move along  
Ah but Ill be back again  
Ooh back again  
  
Ah its a happy time inside my mind  
When a melody does find a rhyme  
Says to me Im comin home to stay  
Oh Lord home to stay  
Im comin home to stay  
Home to stay  
  
Sleep late now mama  
Let the mornin sun warm your bed  
While Im away  
While Im away
