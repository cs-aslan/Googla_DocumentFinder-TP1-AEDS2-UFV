Im drained but aching for more  
And the devil inside is reading  
The words of the saddest poem  
To be engraved on the stone of my grave  
  
Id kill to share your pain  
And carry the shame  
And sell my soul for you just to say  
  
I dream what youre dreaming  
And feel what youre feeling  
Loves our shadow on the wall  
With the face of god  
  
Nothing will be enough  
For the ones Who keep on stumbling  
In the garden of withering trust  
Without the courage to leave  
  
Oh Id take my life for your kiss  
Grant me my wish  
And lose it all to take you across the abyss  
  
I dream what youre dreaming  
And feel what youre feeling  
Loves our shadow on the wall  
With the face of god  
  
You dream what Im Dreaming  
And See what Im seeing  
Loves our shadow on the wall  
With the Face of God  
  
Labyrinth in a shape of a heart  
Loves secret architecture  
I find myself to be lost in the  
Arms of your fate  
  
Id kill to share you pain  
Please let me stay  
And sell my soul for you just to say  
Loves name in vein  
Again and again  
  
I dream what youre dreaming  
And feel what youre feeling  
Loves our shadow on the wall  
With the face of god  
  
You dream what Im Dreaming  
And See what Im seeing  
Loves our shadow on the wall  
With the face of god  
Loves our shadow on the wall  
With the face of  
Face of  
The face of  
Face of  
God  
  
Face of  
God
