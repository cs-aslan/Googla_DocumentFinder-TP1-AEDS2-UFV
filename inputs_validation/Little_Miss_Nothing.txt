People all around they look at you and I have seen them sneer  
But they dont realise how much I need you so let me make it very clear  
That you wont have to worry just cos your clothes are torn  
  
Your windows they need cleaning and the weeds are growing high  
But Little Miss Nothing I wont pass you by  
  
You have no daddy to tell your troubles to but dont you worry Ill share  
them with you  
We wont worry about the stormy weather if you have troubles well share  
them together  
Your house is nearly falling but Ill change all that for you  
  
Your windows they need cleaning and the weeds are growing high  
But Little Miss Nothing I wont pass you by  
Now I will clean your windows cut the weeds from high to low  
I will mend your rooftops and the taps again will flow  
But Little Miss Nothing I wont let you go
