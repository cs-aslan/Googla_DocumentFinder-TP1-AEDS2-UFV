Shes a young one  
Hard to find  
Cant be shaken  
Or handed a line  
Her eyes are loaded  
Point at you  
With a look  
Thats too good to be true  
  
She takes your daydreams  
No concern  
All your night times  
You toss and you turn  
So independent  
Never alone  
Shes a jewel  
Thats much too hot to be worn  
  
Shes a lovely lovely girl  
High lookin down  
Upon her world  
Well Ill take a chance  
And play the fool  
But I know  
Shes just too good to be true  
  
Shes a young one  
Vanitys child  
Cosmopolitan  
Queen of the night  
So Ill catch her in the morning  
Sweet rendezvous  
But I know  
That girls too good to be true  
  
Shes a lovely lovely girl  
High in her lovely lovely world  
Wooh Ill take the chance  
And play the fool  
I know that girls too beautiful  
Shes too good to be true  
Much too good to be true  
Shes too good to be true  
Woohoh too good to be true

Too good to be true
