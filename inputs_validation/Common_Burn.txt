Simple things like  
Your overcoat and your beauty  
Thats still burnin me  
Let me hang around  
Even if its just some way to have  
Some common burn  
A common burn  
  
So I spend the night in someones house  
That you clouted  
Oh simple me that you fled  
But we have that in common  
  
That common burn  
That common burn  
  
Oh well heavens I have said so many times before  
You could sit around and have everything that you scored  
Just dont come home and say youve been asleep  
When you know youre burnin someone  
  
That common burn  
That common burn
