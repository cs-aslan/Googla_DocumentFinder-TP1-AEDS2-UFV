Darn that dream I dream each night  
You say you love me and hold me tight  
But when I awake and youre out of sight  
Oh darn that dream  
  
Darn your lips and darn your eyes  
They lift me high above the moonlit sky  
Then I tumble out of paradise  
Oh darn that dream  
  
Darn that onetrack mind of mine  
I cant understand that you dont care  
Just to change the mood Im in  
Id welcome a nice old nightmare  
  
Darn that dream and bless it too  
Without that dream I never have you  
But it haunts me and it wont come true  
Oh darn that dream
