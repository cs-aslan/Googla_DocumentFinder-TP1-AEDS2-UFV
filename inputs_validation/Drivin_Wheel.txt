Well all I want is a love thats hot  
Cant be sold cant be bought  
Yeah love that dont try to be somethin its not  
  
Well all I need is a love thats real  
None can rob and none can steal  
Hey love that moves like a drivin wheel  
  
Well all I want is drivin wheel  
All I want is a drivin wheel  
All round love my ideal  
  
Well all I want is love thats right  
To hold onto with all my might  
Hey early in the mornin and late at night  
  
Well all I want is drivin wheel  
All I want is a drivin wheel  
Hey all round love my ideal  
  
All I want is a drivin wheel  
All I want is a drivin wheel  
Hey all round love my ideal  
  
All I want is a drivin wheel  
All I want is a drivin wheel  
Well all round love my ideal
