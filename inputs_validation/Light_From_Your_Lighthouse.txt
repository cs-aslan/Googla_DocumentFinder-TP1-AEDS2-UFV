When the sky is filled up  
With stones and heavy rain  
And trouble starts sliding  
Across the way  
Its hard for me to see  
Which road Ive got to take  
I know I need to find a way  
To leave it all behind  
  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
  
And when the light is filled up  
With storms and heavy rain  
And trouble comes sliding  
Across my mind  
Its hard for me to see  
Which road Ive got to take  
I know I need to find a way  
To leave it all behind  
  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me
