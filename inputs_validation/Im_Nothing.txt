IMNOTHIN  
  
Im nothing  
Im nothin  
Are you a republican or a democrat  
A liberal fascist full of crap  
  
Im nothin  
Im nothin  
Somebody somewhere might be something  
But everybody everywhere  
  
Knows that Im nothin  
Politics and dirty tricks  
I got no time for stones and sticks  
Politics and dirty tricks  
  
I got no time Im chasing chicks  
Im nothin  
Im nothin  
Somebody somewhere might be something  
  
But everybody everywhere  
Knows that Im nothing  
Im nothing but Im not proud  
Cause being nothing its not allowed  
  
Are you a gay or are you straight  
Do you believe in love  
Or do you believe in hate  
Im nothin  
  
Im nothin  
Somebody somewhere said he was something  
But to everybody everywhere  
Im saying Im nothing  
  
Im nothing Im like a cloud  
Im free to be alone in a crowd  
Whats your reality Its not real to me  
Whats your anomaly It is my destiny  
  
IMNOTHIN  
IMNOTHIN  
  
Im nothin  
Nothin  
Nothin  
  
Im nothing now and Ill be nothing when  
This nothing world has its nothing end
