Nancy Small pleasures small pleasures  
Who would deny us these  
Gin toddies  large measures   
No skimping if you please  
I rough it I love it  
Life is a game of chance  
Ill never tire of it   
Leading this merry dance  
If you dont mind having to go without things  
Its a fine life  
  
All Its a Fine life  
  
Nancy And though it aint all jolly old pleasure outings  
Its a fine life  
  
All Its a Fine life  
  
Nancy When youve got someone to love  
You forget your cares and strife  
Let the prudes look down on us  
Let the wide world frown on us  
Its a fine fine life  
  
All Its a fine fine life  
  
Bet Who cares if staight laces  
Sneer at us in the street  
Fine airs and fine graces  
  
Nancy Dont have to sin to eat  
  
Both We wonder through London  
  
Nancy Who knows what we may find  
  
Both Theres pockets left undone  
On many a behind  
  
Nancy If you dont mind takin it like it turns out  
Its a fine life  
  
All Its a fine life  
  
Nancy And keep the candle burn until its burned out  
Its a fine life  
  
All Its a fine life  
  
Nancy Though you sometimes do come by  
The occasional black eye  
You can always cover one  
Til he blacks the other one  
But you dont dare cry  
  
Bet No flounces no feathers  
No frills and furbelows  
All winds and all weathers  
Aint good for fancy clothes  
  
Nancy These trappings  
  
Bet These tatters  
  
Bet and nancy These we can just afford  
  
Nancy What future  
  
Bet What matters  
  
Bet and nancy Weve got our bed and board  
  
Nancy If you dont mind having to deal with Fagin  
Its a fine life  
  
All Its a Fine life  
  
Nancy And though diseased rats threaten to bring the plague in  
Its a fine life  
  
All Its fine life  
  
Nancy But the grass is green and dense  
On the right side of the fence  
So we take good care of it  
That we get our share of it  
  
All And we dont mean pence  
  
Bet and nancy If you dont mind having to like or lump it  
Its a fine life  
  
All Its a Fine life  
  
Nancy Though theres no teasippin and eatin crumpet  
Its a fine life  
  
All Its a Fine life  
  
Nancy Not for me the happy home  
Happy husband happy wife  
Though it sometimes touches me  
For the likes of such as me  
Mines a fine  
  
All Fine life
