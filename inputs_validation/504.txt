I was playing every Monday on Burgundy in some shitty little bar  
I was working on a novel called New Orleans Aint No City its a Scar  
The heroine does heroin the hero wears his hair just like The King  
He says It aint my job to sweet talk you my jobs just to sing  
I was loved once by a woman  
She dont love me anymore 504 504  
And I wont never know no woman like the one  
Id known before 504 504 and she dont love me anymore  
Well the hero wears a hairnet  
From the outset he drinks Jax beer from a can  
He says Theres something bout this city always gets me  
Im a sentimental man  
Well the heroine plays violin  
And reads her Elmore Leonard everyday  
Shes the one that finds the body  
Hes the one that gets away  
I was loved once by a woman  
She dont love me anymore 504 504  
And I wont never know no woman like the one  
Id known before 504 504 and she dont love me anymore  
I was loved once by a woman  
She dont love me anymore 504 504  
And I wont never know no woman like the one  
Id known before 504 504  
You know she had me singing Gospel out in the kitchen  
On the floor 504 504 and she dont love me anymore  
No she dont love me anymore  
No she dont love me anymore 504
