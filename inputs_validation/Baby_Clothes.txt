I had that something from my head to my eye  
Just as I made it to the front of the line  
I only seen them out in front of the rehab  
My buddys check form is all blown to sag  
And just because Im spoonfed on milo and cheese  
Dont go shooting every dog just cause one of us got fleas  
And if you dont want to grow wear some  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
  
And Im so sick of sickness yeah  
Why do I write the songs so dickless yeah  
A just cause Im too fat on cheap smokes and wine  
I cant look over your fat shoulder and make rock n roll mine  
Been hearing so much chitter chatter chitter chatter  
And now I found something that matters matters matters matters  
But if you dont want to grow wear some  
  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
And if the bar is closed  
I dont want to know
