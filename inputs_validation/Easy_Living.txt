This is a thing Ive never known before  
Its called easy living  
This is a place Ive never seen before  
And Ive been forgiven  
  
REFRAIN  
Easy living and Ive been forgiven  
Since youre taking your place in my heart  
  
Somewhere along the lonely road  
I had tried to find you  
Day after day on the winding road  
I have walked behind you  
  
REFRAIN  
  
Waiting watching wishing my whole life away  
Feeling fainting ready for my happy day  
  
Somewhere along the lonely road  
I had tried to find you  
Day after day on the winding road  
I have walked behind you  
  
REFRAIN
