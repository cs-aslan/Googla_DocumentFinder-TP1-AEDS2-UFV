They were doolin doolindalton  
High or low it was the same  
Easy money and faithless women  
Red eye whiskey for the pain  
  
Go down little dalton it must be Gods will  
Two brothers lyin dead in Coffeeville  
Two voices call to you from where they stood  
Lay down your law books now theyre no damn good  
  
Better keep on movin doolindalton  
Till your shadow sets you free  
And if youre fast and if youre lucky  
You will never see that hangin tree  
  
Well the towns lay out across the dusty plain  
Like graveyards filled with tombstones waitin for the names  
And a man could use his back or use his brains  
But some just went stircrazy Lord cause nothin ever changed  
  
Till theyre doolin Neville Dalton  
He was workin cheap just buyin time  
And then he laughed and said Im goin  
And so he left that peaceful life behind
