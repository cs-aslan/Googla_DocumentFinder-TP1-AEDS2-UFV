Chorus  
The block got my back and my boys do too  
And my baby mama trippin said she need more loot  
Every block every hood every ghetto got beef  
I got a heater on my lap and another in the back  
See how Im suppposed to cope with all this stress on me  
Everybody and their mama callin feds on me  
I dont know what Im a do but Im a do it Im a do it  
Look I dont know what Im a do but Im a do it Im a do it  
I got money on my head but Im ridin in a drop drop  
  
Yeah  
Feelin just like JFK in the city that let em fly like JFK Ayye  
Sometimes LaGaurdia I aint gone lie to ya  
If looks could kill then my style might body ya  
Thats why Im with Nadia I call my gun Nadia  
When she say hi to ya its buh buh bye to ya  
Make it sound like Saudia  
Arabia maybe the haters should watch what he say to her you think  
I can hold my head high and die or I can live and duck  
My attitude is celibate  
I dont give a fuck  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah  
Now who are you to tell me how to conduct myself  
Why dont you go practice safe sex and go fuck yourself  
The rumor is that Im a hazard to a suckas health  
I coulda told you that yeah I coulda told you that  
Picture me not flop where is them explosives at  
Right here on my lap  
Thats where my composures at  
Im back like a gun cock  
Im so cool that if I go to hell all I need is my sun block  
Nigga hold ya high and die or live and duck  
My attitude is celibate  
I dont give a fuck  
  
Chorus  
  
I mean lets be honest you never liked a nigga  
Tryin to live beyond this so I kept the strap on  
Clap on clap off lights out like flights out  
You could be departed  
Never me who started  
I Lambo Gallarded I am vehically challenged  
That means the car is retarded  
But regardless Im Tin Man heartless  
No love if son lookin for love  
Get a show on VH1  
Nigga hold ya high and die or live and duck  
My attitude is Virgin  
Still dont give a fuck  
  
Chorus
