I dont care if your love grows cold  
Found love in someone elses home  
Dont like standin in the snow  
  
Everythings turning to gold  
Everythings turning to gold  
Everythings turning to gold  
  
You used to know me long ago  
Was so lost and way down low  
Now that the love juice starts to flow  
Now that the love juice starts to flow  
Everythings turning to gold  
Everythings turning to gold  
  
Everythings turning everythings turning  
Everythings turning everythings turning to gold  
  
Im tired Im tired of doing what Im told  
Things are moving way too slow  
I got no problems I got no problems child  
It aint my business it aint my business aint my style  
Now that the love juice starts to flow  
Now that the love juice starts to flow
