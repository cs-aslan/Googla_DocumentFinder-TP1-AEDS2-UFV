Ive been tryin for a long long time  
But no matter what I do  
When I turn to leave my heart stays behind  
Cause I cant get over you  
  
I keep movin on runnin hard and fast  
But everywhere that I run to  
Im just standin still living in the past  
Cause I cant get over you  
  
If memories were like the leaves that fall  
The wind would have carried them from my mind  
The seasons pass but they never change  
A broken heart cant keep time  
  
Ive watched as colors faded in the sun  
The colors of my love stay true  
Ive been letting go now Im not holdin on  
I just cant get over you  
I just cant get over you
