You were my woman and I was your man  
You were good lookin  
You know I was your biggest fan  
You tried to teach me things I already knew  
When you couldnt reach me  
Girl I think you knew that we were through  
Baby its over  
  
Save your love save it save it  
Save your love save it save it  
Save your love I dont want it save your love  
Save it for someone else save it save it  
Save your love I dont need it save your love  
Put it back on the shelf  
For somebody else  
  
You said you love me you may have been right  
But hangin above me girl  
You know that we would fight  
  
You tried to change me and mess up my mind  
Now dont rearrange me  
And girl you know thats why youre left behind  
Its over now  
  
Save your love save it save it  
Save your love save it save it  
Save your love I dont want it save your love  
Save it for someone else save it save it  
Save your love I dont need it save your love  
Put it back on the shelf  
For somebody else  
  
Girl you know its over  
We had some good times  
But now theyre gone so long  
  
Save your love save it save it  
Save your love save it save it  
Save your love I dont want it save your love  
Save it for someone else save it save it  
Save your love I dont need it save your love  
Put it back on the shelf  
For somebody else  
  
Save your love I dont want it save your love  
Save it for someone else save it save it  
Save your love I dont need it save your love  
Girl I dont want it save your love
