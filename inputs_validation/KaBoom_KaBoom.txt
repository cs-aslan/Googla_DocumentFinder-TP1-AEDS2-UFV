Were a deathmarching band  
Peter Pan off the wagon  
Entertain but never trust anyone sober  
Were tasteless but taste good  
My Stop Hats top hated  
Unsafe cheerleaders with  
Porn poms and pipe bombs  
I wont do it with you  
Ill do it to you  
I hope this hook gets caught in your mouth  
I wont do it with you  
Ill do it to you  
Dont Say No  
Just Say Now  
I like a big car cause  
Im a big star  
I make a big rock and roll hits  
Id like to love you  
but my heart is a sore  
I am I am I am so yours  
Kaboom kaboom  
Kaboom kaboom  
Kaboom kaboom  
Id like to la la la la love you  
Kaboom kaboom  
Kaboom kaboom  
Kaboom kaboom  
Id like to la la la la love you  
Im the leader of the club  
And Ive shrugged off my mouse ears  
We fly NoClass Dumbo jets  
And drive harcorevettes  
We fight war with drugs  
And our sex always formal  
We wear lawsuits when  
We get high high high  
  
I wont do it with you  
Ill do it to you  
I hope this hook gets caught in your mouth  
I wont do it with you  
Ill do it to you  
Dont Say No  
Just Say Now  
I like a big car cause  
Im a big star  
I make a big rock and roll hits  
Id like to love you  
but my heart is a sore  
I am I am I am so yours  
Kaboom kaboom  
Kaboom kaboom  
Kaboom kaboom  
Id like to la la la la love you  
Kaboom kaboom  
Kaboom kaboom  
Kaboom kaboom  
Id like to la la la la love you  
Inhale exhale lets all hail  
Its a depraved new world  
Inhale exhale lets all hail  
Its a depraved new world  
After all  
I like a big car cause  
Im a big star  
I make a big rock and roll hits  
Id like to love you  
but my heart is a sore  
I am I am I am so yours  
I am a big car and  
Im a strip bar  
You call it fake  
I call it good as it gets  
Nothing in this world is for real  
Except you are for me and  
I am so yours  
Kaboom kaboom
