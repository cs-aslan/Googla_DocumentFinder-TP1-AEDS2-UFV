I guess is better to be in love and not  
It doesnt matter lay awake  
Say your prayer for good and sake  
Dont know how much I can take  
No one ever said love was fair what we could choose  
But the last thing I thought about was losing you  
And I think about it all the time  
The girl is messing with my mind  
Thats why they say love is blind  
  
Bridge  
Im on in the middle Like a fiddle  
Hear the volume and the cry  
Momma said to have patience  
Love is sick as a patient  
I dont understand why  
  
Chorus  
Weve been going through these changes  
Acting like the strangers  
Never pass a point no turning back  
We hold so much anger our love this in danger  
Never pass a point no turning back  
You dont wanna save me seems like only yesterday  
Never pass a point no turning back  
 You feel the same as I do  
Never pass a point no turning back  
  
My heart was a lock your love a key  
So much hurt on my chest feel like I can breathe  
Should I pressure forward with me I wanna leave  
Instead of living a life full of  
I know that every relationship knows ups and downs  
But saying Come back around  
To the moment  
You will feel the same hey  
  
Bridge  
Im on in the middle Like a fiddle  
Hear the volume and the cry  
Momma said to have patience  
Love is sick as a patient  
I dont understand why  
  
Chorus  
Weve been going through these changes  
Acting like the strangers  
Never pass a point no turning back  
We hold so much anger our love this in danger  
Never pass a point no turning back  
You dont wanna save me seems like only yesterday  
Never pass a point no turning back  
 You feel the same as I do  
Never pass a point no turning back  
  
Im trying to be  
Im trying to be the man  
Im trying to be the one you could talk to  
Im trying to understand  
After all the arguing be the best I can  
But everything Just wasnt right for you  
So what I gotta do  
Hey even made the sacrifice  
 Just wasnt right  
  
Chorus  
Weve been going through these changes  
Acting like the strangers  
Never pass a point no turning back  
We hold so much anger our love this in danger  
Never pass a point no turning back  
You dont wanna save me seems like only yesterday  
Never pass a point no turning back  
 You feel the same as I do  
Never pass a point no turning back
