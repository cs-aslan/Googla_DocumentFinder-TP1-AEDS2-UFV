Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart  
Now theres nothing at all that can keep us apart  
Touch my lips close your eyes and see with your fingertips  
Things that you do and you know Im crazy bout you  
  
Kisses of fire burning burning  
Im at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
Ive had my share of love affairs and they were nothing compared to this  
Oh Im riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Kisses of fire  
Kisses of fire  
  
When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong  
Still its making me scared that my love is so strong  
Losing you Its a nightmare babe and to me its new  
Never before did you see me begging for more  
  
Kisses of fire burning burning  
Im at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
Ive had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this  
Oh Im riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Kisses of fire  
Kisses of fire  
  
Kisses of fire burning burning  
Im at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
Kisses of fire burning burning  
Im at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire sweet devotions  
Im riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
Kisses of fire burning burning  
Im at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions
