Come and Ill take you under  
This beautiful bruises colors  
Everything fades in time its true  
  
Wish that I had another  
Stab at the under cover  
Was it a change in mind for you  
  
Its impossible  
I cant let it out  
Youll never know  
Am I selling you out  
Sit and watch  
Your every mood  
  
Your eyes still remind me of  
Angels that hover above  
Eyes that can change from blind to blue  
  
Now that Ive found my reward  
Throw it away long before  
Id share a piece of mine with you
