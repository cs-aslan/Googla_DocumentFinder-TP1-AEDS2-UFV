If this person that you see  
Seems a little blurred  
Its cause Im not all here  
But not quite there  
And if its like forever  
That youre talkin to yourself  
Its not that I feel different  
Im just somewhere else  
  
If I lack a certain etiquette  
Break all the social laws  
This door is off its hinges now  
But the choice is yours  
  
If I dont seem focused  
Maybe not quite right  
If I seem a little distant  
Maybe Im outta sight  
If everytime we speak  
You seem to draw a blank  
Its the ghost of my exfriends  
That you have to thank  
  
If I lack a certain etiquette  
Break all the social laws  
This door is off its hinges now  
But the choice is yours  
  
Free for the free ride  
That was always given to you  
Fought for forgiveness  
Cause Marx forgave you too  
  
And all for almighty god  
Cause god my aim was true  
And full stop for the candle now  
And the friendship that you blew  
That you blew  
  
Whenever you dig deeper  
You just run against the wall  
Its cause they ripped my soul apart  
Thats all  
If I cant quite place your name  
Your face I dont recall  
No doubt you know mine is  
Mr Free For All  
  
If I lack a certain etiquette  
Break all the social laws  
This door is off its hinges now  
But the choice is yours  
  
Free for the free ride  
That was always given to you  
Fought for forgiveness  
Cause Marx forgave you too  
  
And all for almighty god  
Cause god my aim was true  
And full stop for the candle now  
And the friendship that you blew  
That you blew
