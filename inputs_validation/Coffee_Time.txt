Chorus  
Coffee time  
My dreamy friend  
Its coffee time  
Lets sing  
This silly  
Little rhyme  
And have  
A cup of coffee  
  
Java time  
My happy chum  
Lets have a time  
Well celebrate  
For just a dime  
And have  
A cup of coffee  
  
Greetin time  
The music box  
Is beatin time  
Its good  
Oldfashioned  
Meetin time  
Were in the pink  
So come and clink  
And lets drink  
A cup of coffee  
  
Chorus x2  
  
And have  
A cup of coffee  
And have  
A cup of coffee
