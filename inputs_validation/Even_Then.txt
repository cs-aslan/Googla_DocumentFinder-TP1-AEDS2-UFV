You ask me when I knew  
I was in love with you with you with you  
Well when the world began  
I was dreaming even then of you of you of you  
And then as time went on went on  
I knew youd come along along along  
For you couldnt stay away  
When you knew I felt the way I do I do I do I do  
For just how long has there been a moon  
And the stars in the sky up above doodeeyup  
So if I tell you when I knew doodeeyup  
That would be how long Id love  
Oh when the world began began  
And everything was new was new was new  
Well I was dreaming even then  
And I knew I was in love with you with you with you  
  
For just how long has there been a moon  
And the stars in the sky up above doodeeyup  
So if I tell you when I knew doodeeyup  
That would be how long Id love  
Oh when the world began began  
And everything was new was new was new  
Well I was dreaming even then  
And I knew I was in love with you with you with you
