Maybe I was wrong  
Maybe you were right  
Maybe I dont listen  
Like I should  
Maybe when I dont  
Dont come home at night  
It tends to bother you  
Maybe I could start  
Answering a page  
Call if Id be late  
Thatd be good  
What Im trying to say  
Is that Im gonna try  
And do better for you  
  
Im aware  
That theyre some faults  
In this relationship  
Where I could try  
A bit harder than I do  
And so Im telling you  
  
Im not  
Im not perfect  
Just making sure with me  
Baby please  
Im gonna be so right  
For you girl  
So Im  
So imperfect  
Just dont give up on me  
You will see  
Im gonna be so right  
For you girl  
  
Maybe I dont ask  
You about your day  
Maybe I act  
Like I dont care  
Girl I really do  
I just got a whole lot  
On my mind right now  
Baby I dont want  
You to go away  
Everything is wrong  
If youre not there  
Tell me what you want  
And Im gonna try  
To give it all  
To you somehow  
  
Im aware  
That theyre some faults  
In this relationship  
Where I could try  
A bit harder than I do  
And so Im telling you  
  
Im not  
Im not perfect  
Just making sure with me  
Baby please  
Im gonna be so right  
For you girl  
So Im  
So imperfect  
Just dont give up on me  
You will see  
Im gonna be so right  
For you girl  
  
I know  
You can do  
Better than me  
But I dont want  
Nobody but you  
And I know  
You dont think  
I appreciate you  
Let me show you  
That is not true  
  
2x  
Im not  
Im not perfect  
Just making sure with me  
Baby please  
Im gonna be so right  
For you girl  
So Im  
So imperfect  
Just dont give up on me  
You will see  
Im gonna be so right  
For you girl  
Im not  
Im not perfect  
Just making sure with me  
Baby please  
Im gonna be so right  
For you girl  
So Im  
So imperfect  
Just dont give up on me  
You will see  
Im gonna be so right  
For you girl
