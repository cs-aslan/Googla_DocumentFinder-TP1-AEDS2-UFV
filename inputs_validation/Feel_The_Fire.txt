Eat through the mounds of steel  
Sift through the metal  
Belly full another deal  
Stopping would be fatal  
Round n round spins a fortyfive  
Is it vinyl or a bullet  
One to kill one keeps alive  
Get on your knees and suck it  
  
Looking down the barrel the feeling of new power  
Look up the weasel Feel the reign of terror  
  
Crawling scratching to stay alive  
Hes lying on his belly  
One finger needed to rip apart  
The soul Belial carries  
Point your finger scream in vain  
Not a soul is listening  
Never fast youll feel the pain  
Long cold barrel glistening  
  
Down the dead end street he strikes to kill the weed  
I call the Devil laughing as you bleed  
  
Prepare for your new life  
Satan waits to night  
  
No one cried when it was over  
Your life it had no meaning  
Even friends of JAR  
Quickly lost all feelings  
You had warnings you had time  
Well that was all you gave it  
Said one day youd be mine  
Your life you couldnt save it  
  
Angels raining down stories that they tell  
JJ played with fire now he burns in Hell  
  
Prepare for your new life  
Satan waits to night  
  
Higher Higher Feel the fire  
She burns at the stake like a witch  
Kill her Slash her slit her throat  
Theres nothing I dispise more than a bitch  
Burn her tonight  
Run hide from the Demons fate  
To late the fire is lit  
  
Come in a sit for awhile  
Come in and feel the fire  
Feel the heat feel the fire  
Fire of desire  
Fall in Fall in Ahahahaha  
Feel the fire
