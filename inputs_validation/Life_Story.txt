ZRo  
Nobody seems to understand that my brain aint stable  
They got me out on the ledge  
feel like Im falling off the edge it aint no fable  
Its reality feel like Im on the offensive they trying to tackle me  
Thats why I keep popping fists  
So rather relative or stranger better keep your distance  
I cant determine friend or foe so you in danger  
Chemical imbalances of the weed and cocaine but it really  
Dont matter to society a nigga that got no face and no name  
Deserving more but Ima mob until I aint got nothing left  
And the only thing thats promised to me is more problems and death  
Cause theres some niggas looking for me and they might be near  
And if they kill me dont shed a tear remember Im not happy here  
Even still got to keep my eyes on the prize  
Although my vision is blurry Im losing life in a hurry  
Even my girlfriend dont understand didnt want to  
Witness the wicked so please find yourself another man haters feel me  
Chorus  2x  
This is my liiiiiiiiife  
Surviving in the struggle living so shife  
Verse 2  
My opposition and proposition is scheming for cash  
And if you bitches is scandalous I get in that ass  
So lets reliviate the pressure  
Dont try to run its guaranteed these slugsll catch you  
Oh yeah I keeps a problem solver  
A pistol grip a automatic and revolver  
Check it and Ima handle up baby  
Its in my nature its a must it aint a maybe peep game  
The feds taking pictures and tapping my phones  
But if I catch you bitches snitching best believe me its on  
I analyze of this realize and open fire on bitches  
And if I catch you bastards slipping Im leaving bodies in ditches huh  
I bet that ass can pass it  
Your life span it aint long you in a casket check it  
Niggas rushing your ass mob deep with ski masks  
Busting shots on the road trying to make your car crash this is my life  
Chorus  2x  
ZRo  
These boys be telling me they got love giving me falseified tapping but  
I know they wouldnt give a fuck about me if there wasnt no money in rapping  
See I know they want to get rich off me understand even if I was  
To die I still can talk they still put a mic in my hand  
For trying to copy my style of life pretending like they from my block  
While I survive on willing to live while they depend on mom and pops  
Before you make your move check yourself and giving me for the millions  
For the love of the struggle and just cant take it cause you not real  
You want to be dead theres gone be a dentist to see  
When a nigga be scream and hollering Im godfather  
But I guess its just the menace in me plus  
The only nigga thats skipping me from clicking is Herman Fisher  
Relocated the killers and gats and drinking and if and burning swishers  
Why they want to play with my life they got families nigga I dont  
The only thing between me and them hoes  
Is Ima keep thugging they timid ass wont  
Will they mind they own god damn business and keep they self out of mine  
Because of a thin line between handling business  
and boo yeah coward a nine baby  
Chorus  4x
