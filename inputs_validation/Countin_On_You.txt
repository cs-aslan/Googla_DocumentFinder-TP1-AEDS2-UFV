You said it wasnt my way  
To play my hand  
And make you see  
I always knew that one day  
Youd turn around  
And come to me  
  
Chorus  
And one of us could walk away  
I know that life goes on  
And on and on  
But why dont we just stay  
You know its all right  
Meet me around midnight  
Im countin on you tonight  
Im countin on you tonight  
You know its all right  
Meet me around midnight  
Im countin on you tonight  
Im countin on you tonight  
  
You knew it was a long road  
We shared the pain and sacrifice  
But if we had  
To do it all again  
You know baby Id pay the price  
  
Chorus  
  
You know its all right  
Meet me around midnight  
Im countin on you tonight  
Im countin on you tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
You know its all right  
Meet me around midnight  
Im countin on you tonight  
Im countin on you tonight
