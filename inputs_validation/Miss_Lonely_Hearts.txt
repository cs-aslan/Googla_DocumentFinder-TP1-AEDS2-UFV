Miss Lonely Hearts please lend a hand  
My one and only love is with another man  
Can you tell me why my baby said goodbye  
She didnt even try  
Miss Lonely Hearts  
  
Miss Lonely Hearts What can I do  
Oh how it hurts to know  
The one you loves untrue  
Will you hear my plea Oh what can it be  
Why cant we both agree  
Miss Lonely Hearts  
  
Youve helped so many find their way  
Just give the word and Ill obey  
  
Miss Lonely Hearts what can I do  
Oh how it hurts to know  
The one you loves untrue  
Will you hear my plea Oh what can it be  
Why cant we both agree  
Miss Lonely Hearts
