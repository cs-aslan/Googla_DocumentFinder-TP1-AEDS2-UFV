Some say they will and some say they wont  
Some say they do and some say they dont  
Some say they shall and some say they shant  
And some say they can and some say they cant  
  
All in all its all the same  
But call me if theres any change  
  
Some say theres nothing and some say theres lots  
Some say theyve started while some say theyve stopped  
Some say theyre going and some say theyve been  
Yes some say theyre looking and some say theyve seen  
  
All in all its all the same  
But call me if theres any change
