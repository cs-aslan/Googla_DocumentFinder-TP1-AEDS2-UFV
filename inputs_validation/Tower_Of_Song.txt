Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey  
I ache in the places where I used to play  
And Im crazy for love but Im not coming on  
Im just paying my rent every day  
Oh in the Tower of Song  
I said to Hank Williams how lonely does it get  
Hank Williams hasnt answered yet  
But I hear him coughing all night long  
A hundred floors above me  
In the Tower of Song  
  
I was born like this I had no choice  
I was born with the gift of a golden voice  
And twentyseven angels from the Great Beyond  
They tied me to this table right here  
In the Tower of Song  
  
So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll  
Im very sorry baby doesnt look like me at all  
Im standing by the window where the light is strong  
Ah they dont let a woman kill you  
Not in the Tower of Song  
  
Now you can say that Ive grown bitter but of this you may be sure  
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor  
And theres a mighty judgment coming but I may be wrong  
You see you hear these funny voices  
In the Tower of Song  
  
I see you standing on the other side  
I dont know how the river got so wide  
I loved you baby way back when  
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed  
But I feel so close to everything that we lost  
Well never have to lose it again  
  
Now I bid you farewell I dont know when Ill be back  
There moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track  
But youll be hearing from me baby long after Im gone  
Ill be speaking to you sweetly  
From a window in the Tower of Song  
  
Yeah my friends are gone and my hair is gray  
I ache in the places where I used to play  
And Im crazy for love but Im not coming on  
Im just paying my rent every day  
Oh in the Tower of Song
