Nervous tension mans invention  
Its the biggest killer thats around today  
Let the tension out or it will build and build inside  
And strike you down some day  
Nervous tension mans invention  
Is the biggest waste of human energy  
Let the tension out or it will surely kill  
And that will be a tragedy  
  
Valium helps you for a while  
But somehow Valium seems to bring me down  
Theres no pill I can recommend where side effects  
Arent guaranteed to send you round the bend  
  
You gotta let out the tension  
With a little bit of exercise  
Loosen up your muscles  
And feel the knots in your body untie  
  
We oh we oh  
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah  
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah  
  
It sure beats Quaaludes  
It sure beats cocaine  
Even Freud recommends it  
Cause it relieves the strain  
  
Altogether now  
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah  
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah  
  
Some people say it sends you deaf  
Some people say it sends you blind  
Some people say it makes you old  
Some people say it blows your mind  
But I say  
  
If its good for your health  
Its good for your mind  
If it keeps you together  
Its really all right  
We oh we oh  
  
Oh cmon kick the cat  
Oh oh oh oh its the state of the national health  
Oh oh oh oh blame it on the national health

Nervous tension mans invention  
Is the biggest killer thats around
