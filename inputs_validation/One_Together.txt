How can my heart be filled with doubts of you  
When you can fill me with a love thats true  
But I cant help but sigh  
And sometimes wonder why  
What can I do  
  
I want to see you more and more each day  
I really need you youre my only way  
You say its alright now  
But still I wonder how  
What can I say  
  
Ive dreamed a thousand dreams  
And cried so many tears  
Cause when youre not in my heart it seems  
Like Ive wasted all my years  
  
Someday together we will fly to the sun  
And then well think of all the things weve done  
Everyone will smile  
Happy all the while  
Now that were one  
  
Ive dreamed a thousand dreams  
And cried so many tears  
When youre not in my heart it seems  
Like Ive wasted all my years  
  
Someday together we will fly to the sun  
And then well think of all the things weve done  
Everyone will smile  
Happy all the while  
Now that were one
