The holy spirits got me pumpin  
With the beat this place is jumpin  
Through the sound the demons cant stand it  
Cuz we know were gonna shake this planet  
Were gonna shake this planet  
And turn it upside down  
Were going to praise him  
Where his praises can be found  
Were gonna shout his praises  
For hes the one who reigns  
Were gonna sing it till the whole world has been saved  
Shake it  
Planet turn it upside down  
Well go  
Spirit come and make a sound  
Shake it  
Generation going down  
Spirit  
Cuz we know were gonna shake this planet  
Cuz we know were gonna shake this planet  
Cuz we know were gonna shake this planet  
Cuz we know were gonna shake this planet
