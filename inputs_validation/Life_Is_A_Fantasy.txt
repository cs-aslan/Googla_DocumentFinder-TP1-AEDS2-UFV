Oh yeaIn my dreams I envision myself at the ocean  
Beautiful girls rubbin me down with some lotion  
Even though you know I flow as cold as an ice cube  
Let me tell you how it is to make love on an inner tube  
Floatin on water while splashin waves on your body  
Flowni and goin now pump it pump it Hottie  
See I want to get loose with you is that all right  
Girl I want to do it outside under the moonlight  
And get on down so we can make that love  
You be the hand and Icemanll be the glove  
This is your fantasy your highest dream  
Fulfillin all your pleasures the utmost extreme  
YeaLife is just a fantasyYea  
Now let me take you out so we can wine and dine  
As I pull you close you pull your lips next to mine  
Oh yeah you like it like that  
You like it like I do and thats where its at  
So later on that night as we got in my car  
It started up again we didnt get very far  
You made it very clear that you were not in fear  
Leaned over to me and started kissin my ear  
Oh girl you feel so good  
You couldnt wait to get home and I understood  
As we got busy then I pulled up in the driveway  
You said follow me cause were gonna do it my way  
Walked in the front door you startin strippin clothes  
Turned off the lights and assumed the pose  
Closer and closer hot anticipation  
You walked into the closet came out in some lace and  
I almost lost my mind but I kept it in tact  
The lace you was wearin ohhh I got an attack  
Cause this is your fantasy your highest dream  
Fulfillin all your pleasures to the utmost extreme  
YeaLife is just a fantasy  
YeaLife is just a fantasy  
Come on baby and let me be your toy  
Ill let you do as you wish just to give you joy  
And get down I know you want to get loose  
Lets do it like a train and Ill be the caboose  
Or better yet Ill take you higher I think that its time  
To make love to you baby on cloud number nine  
As we start pumpin sweat pour down my chest  
And thats when you know Vanilla Ice is the best  
You say ooh ah ooh ooh ah  
I dont know what it means but I like it a lot  
This is your fantasy your highest dream  
Fulfillin all your pleasures to the utmost extreme  
YeaLife is just a fantasy  
O yeaLife is just a fantasyOh girl
