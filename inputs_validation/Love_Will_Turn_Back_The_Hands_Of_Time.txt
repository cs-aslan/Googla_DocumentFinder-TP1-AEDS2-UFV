Kelly  
No more midnight rides with you  
No more secret rendezvous  
Im gonna miss all the things well never do  
I just cant believe you left me here alone  
How in this world can I make it on my own  
  
Kalan  
Remember I love you I wont be far away  
Baby close your eyes and think of yesterday  
And well be there together  
Love will turn back the hands of time  
Whoa oh turn back  
Whoa oh turn back the hands of time  
  
Kelly  
Whoa oh baby dont you know its hard to let you go  
  
Kalan  
Save all your dreams and keep me in your heart  
  
Kelly  
It hurts to say goodbye no matter how I try  
  
Kalan  
Love will survive even though we have to part  
  
Spoken  
  
Stephanie please dont cry  
Kelly  
Oh it all seems so unfair just when I found you I lost you  
Kalan  
That doesnt matter now  
The only thing that matters is the time we had together  
Kelly  
But I dont even know your name  
Kalan  
The only thing you have to know is that I love you  
And youre the only one that can keep our love alive  
So Stephanie dont forget me  
Kelly  
I promise  
  
Kalan  
Remember I love you you wont be far away  
  
Kelly  
I just close my eyes and bring back yesterday  
Kelly and Kalan  
And well be there together  
Love will turn back the hands of time  
Whoa oh turn back  
Whoa oh turn back the hands of time  
Whoa oh turn back  
Whoa oh turn back the hands of time  
  
Well turn back
