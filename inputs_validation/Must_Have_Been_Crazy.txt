Shes fine so fine  
And I think Im going to lose my mind  
So high so high  
You know you make me want to  
Scream and shout  
Well you know Im like a fool  
Whos just got to have a reason  
You know that Ive found mine  
Must have been crazy  
Must have been crazy yeah  
Must have been crazy  
To have done this so long  
This time its time  
Every singers got to sing his song  
So fine its fine  
You know you make me want to  
Sing along

Got to find a piece of heaven  
You know that I found mine  
Must have been crazy

To have done this so long

Got to find a piece of heaven  
You know that I found mine

Must have been crazy  
To have done this so long
