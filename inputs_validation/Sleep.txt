I cant describe the feeling when  
  
Im in my bed asleep and then  
I wake up with a vision blurred  
And all my efforts are deterred  
To reconstruct this image lost  
  
Therere certain things my mind must do  
And even though theyre very few  
The image glistens like a gem  
  
Repairing is not one of them  
So Im awake though in my mind  
The image thats so unrefined  
Is calling to me from the deep  
And tempting me to fall asleep
