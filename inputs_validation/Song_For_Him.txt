Ive been lonely but not lonelier than Him  
Ive been lonely but not lonelier than Him  
When Im lonely still I know  
Hell forgive me yes its so  
Ive been lonely but not lonelier than Him  
Ive been sorry not sorryer than Him  
Ive been sorry not sorryer than Him  
When Im sorry I remember  
That he loves me  
And Im better  
Ive been sorry not sorryer than Him  
It doesnt matter if Im wrong it doesnt matter if Im right  
Hes with me at the break of dawn  
Hes every star that shines at night  
Ive been happy but not happier than Him  
Ive been happy but not happier than Him  
When Im happy skies are blue  
I forget him still its true  
Ive been happy but not happier than Him  
But not sorrier than Him  
But not lonelier than Him
