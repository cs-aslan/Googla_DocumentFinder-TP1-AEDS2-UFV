Here in this town they have all got the blues  
As the paper boy takes off without any news  
Angels have wings you can feel free to use  
The corner store drugs you can freely abuse  
  
And Im yelling and screaming cause baby youre driving me crazy  
  
So life on your own has been vacant and cold  
Everyones getting somewhere and youre getting old  
Career opportunities they all have been sold  
Along with your body and most of your soul  
  
And Im yelling and screaming cause baby youre driving me crazy  
If I could spare more remorse from my emptied out pores I would maybe  
Cause the fogs getting thicker the worlds spinning fast  
The chaos is building its going too last  
And its so hard to see and youre so hard to find  
The days when I think I am losing my mind  
  
So keep painting pictures of beautiful scenes  
Striking the canvas with deep blues and greens  
When you start frowning they think youre obscene  
As you work overtime to make sure they can dream  
  
Im yelling and screaming cause baby youre driving me crazy  
If I could spare more remorse from my emptied out pores I would maybe  
Cause the fogs getting thicker the worlds spinning fast  
The chaos is building its going too last  
And its so hard to see and youre so hard to find  
The days when I think I am losing my mind  
  
And we yell and we scream  
As the fogs getting thicker the worlds spinning fast  
The chaos is building its going to last  
And its so hard to see and youre so hard to find  
The days when I think I am losing my mind  
  
And the fogs getting thicker the worlds spinning fast  
The chaos is building its going to last  
And its so hard to see and youre so hard to find  
The days when I think I am losing my mind
