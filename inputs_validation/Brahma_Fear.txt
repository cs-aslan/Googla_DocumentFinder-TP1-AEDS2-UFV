Id like to ride the rodeo  
But Ive got Brahma fear  
So Ill just stick to airplanes  
Gently pop my ears  
  
Drink a lot of whiskey  
It gives me such a glow  
It makes me quite immobile  
Ah but it lets my feeling show  
  
And Im somewhere below the spotlight  
Somewhere below the ground  
You dig deep enough you might find me  
Find me and youve found my sound  
  
Yes I own a whaler boat  
It slides across the sea  
Some folks say Im part of it  
And I know its part of me  
  
And when Im feelin solitaire  
It lets me be alone  
And when I want to have a taste  
It carries me back home  
  
And Im somewhere below the sunlight  
Somewhere upon the sea  
You dig deep enough you might find me  
Find me cause thats where Ill be  
  
Yes I drink a lot of whiskey  
It gives me such a glow  
It makes me quite immobile  
But it lets my feelins show  
Yes it makes me quite immobile  
Ah but it lets my feelins show
