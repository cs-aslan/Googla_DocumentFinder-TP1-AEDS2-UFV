Baby slow down just hear me out  
Theres something I gotta let you know  
No need push no need to rush  
You know you had me from hello  
  
When it comes to my heart I dont play  
Baby boy cant you see the stop sign  
Youre movin much to fast  
Baby love doesnt grow in a day  
Just get it right the first time  
Make this feeling last  
  
Chorus  
Baby if your willing to wait  
We can just take our time  
Dont you know that its getting late  
And I know whats on your mind  
I know this feeling is crazy  
Its mutual baby  
But we dont have to rush something real  
Baby if youre willing to wait  
We can just take our time  
  
Boy cant you see Im not tryin be  
The girl who gets taken for a ride  
If you take your time then you will find  
Theres so much more to me inside  
And just say theres no need to delay  
Your telling me to trust you  
Boy you know I want to baby  
But my heart can so recently break  
Before we take this very far show me who you really are  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby love doesnt grow in a day  
Lets get it right the first time  
And make this feeling last  
  
Chorus
