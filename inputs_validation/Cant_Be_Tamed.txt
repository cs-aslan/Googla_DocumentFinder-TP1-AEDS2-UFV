Like a Mafia  
For those who dont know me  
I can get a bit crazy  
Have to get my way yep  
Twenty four hours a day  
Cause Im hot like that  
  
Every guy everywhere  
Just gives me mad attention  
Like Im under inspection  
I always get a ten  
Cause Im built like that  
  
I go through guys like  
Money flying out the hands  
They try to change me  
But they realize they cant  
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan  
If youre gonna be my man understand  
  
Chorus  
I cant be tamed  
I cant be tamed  
I cant be blamed  
I cant cant  
I cant be tamed  
I cant be changed  
I cant be tamed  
I cant be cant be tamed  
  
If there is a question about my intentions  
Ill tell ya  
Im not here to sell ya  
Or tell you to go to hell  
Im not a brat like that  
Im like a puzzle  
But all of my pieces are jagged  
If you can understand this  
We can make some magic  
Im wrong like that  
  
I wanna fly  
I wanna drive  
I wanna go  
I wanna be a part of something I dont know  
And if you try to hold me back I might explode  
Baby by now you should know  
  
Chorus  
  
Well Im not a trick you play  
Im wired a different way  
Im not a mistake  
Im not a fake  
Its set in my DNA  
Dont change me  
Dont change me  
Dont change me  
Dont change me  
I cant be tamed  
  
I wanna fly  
I wanna drive  
I wanna go  
I wanna be a part of something I dont know  
And if you try to hold me back I might explode  
Baby by now you should know  
  
Chorus
