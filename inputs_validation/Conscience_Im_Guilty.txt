Oh conscience Im guilty Im guilty again  
Now Im driving home slowly my spirits so low  
I cheated on her again and why Ill never know  
I hope I dont look too guilty when she lets me in  
Oh conscience dont ever let me do that again  
Oh conscience Im guilty and I must confess  
Why I kissed her I knew I love the other one best  
Ive been out with an old flame whos hearts full of sin  
Oh conscience dont ever let me do that again  
Between right and the wrong the love and desire  
This game that Im playing more dangers than fire  
I might talk in my sleep or be caught by her friend  
Oh conscience dont ever let me do that again  
Oh conscience Im guilty
