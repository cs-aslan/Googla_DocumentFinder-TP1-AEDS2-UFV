God knows youre lonely souls  
God knows youre lonely souls  
God knows youre lonely souls  
Yeah yeah  
  
I believe theres a time and a place  
To let your mind drift and get out of this place  
I believe theres a day and a place  
That we will go to and I know you want to share  
  
Theres no secret to living Theres no secret to living  
Just keep on walking  
Theres no secret to dying Theres no secret to dying  
Just keep on flying  
  
Im gonna die in a place that dont know my name  
Im gonna die in a space that dont hold my fame  
God knows youre lonely souls  
God knows youre lonely souls  
  
I believe theres a time when the cord of life  
Should be cut my friends Cut the cord my friend  
I believe theres a time when the cord can be cut  
And this vision ends Let this vision end  
  
But Im gonna die in a place that dont know my name  
And Im gonna cry in a space that dont hold my fame  
  
Walking in the cold  
Just keep on flying  
Therell be a searchlight  
On the mountain high  
  
God knows youre lonely souls  
God knows youre lonely souls  
God knows youre lonely souls  
God knows youre lonely souls  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Im a lonely soul  
Im gonna die in a place that dont know my name  
Im gonna die in a place that dont know my name  
  
God knows you are lonely souls  
Lonely souls  
Lonely souls  
Lonely souls  
Im a lonely soul  
  
So long little chapel  
Pack up your light  
Pack up your light  
Say goodbye to the holy water life  
Oh  
Ah
