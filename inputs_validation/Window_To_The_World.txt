Ive gone flying trying to meet you  
Youve been hiding riding me to a state  
Like this  
  
Give me that window to  
Give me that window to  
Give me that window to the world  
  
We are sailing flailing through the ether  
Youve been trailing failing me with youre  
View of bliss  
  
Give me that window to  
Give me that window to  
Give me that window to the world  
  
A little more than this  
A little less than that  
Youve got magic in your hands  
  
Youve conspired inspired me to  
Find a place like this  
  
Give me that window to  
Give me that window to  
Give me that window to the world
