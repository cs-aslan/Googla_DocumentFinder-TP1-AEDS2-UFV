Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
Well shes all geared up walkin down the street  
And I can feel the slime drippin down her sleeve  
Well you cant refuse and you just cant choose what shes gonna do  
Well you cant refuse and you just cant choose what shes gonna do  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
Well its late at night and Im all alone  
And I can hear her boots as shes near her home  
Well you cant refuse and you just cant choose what shes gonna do  
Well you cant refuse and you just cant choose what shes gonna do  
  
Chorus  
Scratch scratch shes clawing at the door  
Whoa no I cant take it anymore  
Crack crack Im feeling so sore  
I never should asked for black leather  
Black leather  
Ooh black leather  
Ow black leather  
  
And you can try to hide but you wont get far  
You can let her in and youll start it again  
Well you cant refuse and you just cant choose what shes gonna do  
Well you cant refuse and you just cant choose what shes gonna do  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Black leather x 8
