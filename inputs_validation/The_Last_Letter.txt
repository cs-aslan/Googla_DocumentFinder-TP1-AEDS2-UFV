Sitting alone up in your empty room  
In the stillness of the night  
Where all the many dreams that used to carry you  
Are no longer in sight  
You put your feelings down in black and white  
A sad disturbing reply  
That you dont really want to face another night  
So youre saying goodbye  
But do you know that youre saying goodbye  
To a lifetime  
  
Chorus  
Well Ive got to tell you theres another way  
To be free to be complete  
But youve got to make it through another day  
And deny your own defeat dont give in  
And Im here to tell you theres another way  
To consume a hungry heart  
All the love you need is just a prayer away  
Let it in to where you are  
  
Youve made it to the edge of seventeen  
Thinking now youve reached the end of the line  
But theres so much of life that you have never seen  
Now you wont have the time  
You say that you dont hear the music play  
so youre ready to give up the dance  
Now that nothing really matters anyway  
Oh you give up your chance  
But do you know that you give up your chance  
At a lifetime  
  
Chorus  
Well Ive got to tell you theres another way  
To be freeto be complete  
But youve got to make it through another day  
And deny your own defeat dont give in  
And Im here to tell you theres another way  
To consume a hungry heart  
Jesus is waiting just a prayer away  
Let him in to where you are  
  
You put your feelings down in black and white  
A sad disturbing reply  
That you dont really want to face another night  
So youre saying goodbye  
But do you know that youre saying goodbye  
To a lifetime  
  
Chorus
