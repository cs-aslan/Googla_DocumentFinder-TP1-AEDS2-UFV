From my room I can hear you laughing  
You spend all your time with my best friend  
Oh I wish you knew how bad Ive fallen for you  
Theres no way to know how things may end  
  
Cause babe I dont know where to start  
Longing is the hardest part  
There aint no easy way into your heart  
  
In my mind I can see us together  
Crazy in love and paintin the town  
When you look at him I know theres no way I can win  
I came running for you would you turn me down  
  
Cause babe I dont know where to start  
Longing is the hardest part  
There aint no easy way into your heart  
  
Babe I dont know where to start  
Longing is the hardest part  
There aint no easy way into your heart  
  
Babe I dont know where to start  
Longing is the hardest part  
There aint no easy way into your heart
