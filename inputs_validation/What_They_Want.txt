Hey hoes aint shit  
And money aint nothin  
And if it aint nothin  
Then its gotta be somethin  
And if it aint somethin  
Then its gotta be nothin  
And if he aint showed the cash  
Then he gotta be bluffin  
My dog hit me up  
He say he gotta lick  
Gotta bad jump shot  
So he might shoot a brick  
Talkin records on my line  
Thats a technical foul  
Dont know what the fuck you talkin bout  
Im hangin up right now  
Nigga you aint nick cannon  
And this aint wild and out  
Playin my position  
I aint tryin to foul out  
Instant replay yeah  
We bout to find out  
Hey where the referee  
I need to call the time out  
  
Chorus x2  
If young is what they want  
Then young is what they gettin  
They ask me what I do I tell em teachin for a livin  
What you say nigga  
I could show you how to make a mill right now  
And I could show you how to make a mill right now  
  
He say he just touched down  
And he need a dutch downed  
Second time he caught a date  
Think he goin out a way  
Thirty six skyline  
We goin for the fresh down  
Fresh planned defense  
Every time he come around  
We goin to the super bowl  
If I make this field goal  
I understand you gotta beat  
Let me turn this knee to three  
He trippin bout the extra point  
Make sure you bring my extra cash  
Next time I see your extra ass  
Hold up call the play  
Yeah Im playin quarterback  
4 way 2 way bet I bring a quarter back  
Weigh it up bag it up pass it to my runnin back  
I got short on my pay  
Thats a flag yell this way  
  
Chorus  
  
Ninth inning bases loaded  
Im going for the grand slam  
Tax free tax free  
Dont give a shit to Uncle Sam  
Youngin playin softball  
You playin softball  
Yeah Im playin softball  
Same colors golf balls  
Catch me in the outfield  
Thats a whole lot of grass  
Tryin to buy a franchise  
Thats a whole lot of cash  
Yeah thats right Im savin up  
Think Im gonna buy the team  
Watch me get my bounty on  
Trying to get my money clean  
Always quick watch the bitch  
Cant afford another strike  
If I make it through this shit  
Then I can play another night  
Money fight money fight  
Gotta get my money right  
But first I gotta kick these hoes  
So make sure that you ridin wit me  
  
Chorus
