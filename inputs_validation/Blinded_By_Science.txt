Blinded by science Im on the run  
Blinded by science where do I belong  
Whats in the future has it just begun  
Blinded by science Im on the run  
  
I worry bout the world that we live in  
Im worried by all the confusion  
I wonder bout the lies Ive been reading  
I wonder where this madness is leading  
  
Is this a road going nowhere  
Or is someone leading us somewhere  
I cant believe were here for no reason  
There must be something we can believe in  
  
Blinded by science Im on the run  
Im not an appliance so dont turn me on  
Whats in the future has it just begun

Im blinded by science on the run
