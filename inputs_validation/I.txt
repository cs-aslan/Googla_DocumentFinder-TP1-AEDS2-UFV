I was so frightened  
I almost ran away  
I didnt know that I could do  
Anything I needed to  
  
And then a bolt of lightning  
Hit me on my head  
Then I began to see  
I just needed to believe in me  
  
Now I I believe in me  
And I I believe in something more  
Than you can understand  
Yes I believe in me  
  
They said I didnt stand a chance  
I wouldnt win no way  
But Ive got news for you  
Theres nothing I cant do  
  
Aint no pretending  
Aint no make believe  
But Ive got to be the one  
I gotta do what must be done  
  
Now I I believe in me  
And I I believe in something more  
Than you can understand  
Yes I believe in me  
  
I believe in me  
Yes I believe in me  yeah  
  
I dont need no money  
I dont need no fameno  
I just need to believe in me  
And I know most definitely  
  
Dont need to get wasted  
It only holds me down  
I just need a will of my own  
And the balls to stand alone  
  
Now I I believe in me  
And I I believe in something more  
Than you can understand  
Yes I believe in me  
Well do you really  
Yes I believe in me  
Do you do you  
Yes I believe in me  
I want to rock n roll  
Yes I believe in me  
  
Morpheus you have been summoned here to offer your judgment of the boy  
Do you still deem him worthy of the Fellowship  
I certainly do my lord  
As a matter of fact I I think youre going like this one Hes got the light
in his eyes and the look of a champion  
A real champion
