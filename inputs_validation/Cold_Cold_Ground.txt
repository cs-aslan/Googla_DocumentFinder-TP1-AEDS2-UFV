Oh the clock here in the barroom says its half past nine  
Thats usually how long it takes me to drink my first bottle of wine  
Yes every fifteen minutes I can drink another bottle down  
And get fifteen minutes closer to that coldcold ground to that cold cold
ground  
Well I think Ill play the jukebox and light up another cigarette  
They say for every puff of that loving smoke you get another minute closer to
death  
Well I smoke two or three packs a day and my arithmetic is not to sound  
But I know Im getting hours closer to that coldcold ground  
  
To that cold cold ground  
Now this morning I had me a woman and a love so nice and fine  
But this evening I watched her board that train and move on down the line  
Our love was so good but now shes gone and this is what Ive found  
Her leaving sure brought me closer to that cold cold ground  
  
To that cold cold ground  
Well Im standing in the back alley with a pistol in my hand  
I never thought a womens love could do this to a man  
I hear that hammer clickinwhat a sweet terrible sound  
Let my tombstone read no liquor no smoke no drugs  
But a womans love put me in that cold cold groundPut me in that cold cold
ground
