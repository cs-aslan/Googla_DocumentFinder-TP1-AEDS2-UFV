Love is a rose but you better not pick it  
Only grows when its on the vine  
Handful of thorns and youll know youve missed it  
Lose your love when you say the word mine  
  
I want to see whats never been seen  
I want to live that ageold dream  
Come on boy lets go together  
Lets take the best right now  
  
Love is a rose but you better not pick it  
Only grows when its on the vine  
Handful of thorns and youll know youve missed it  
Lose your love when you say the word mine  
  
I want to go to an old hoedown  
Long ago in a western town  
Pick me up cause my feet are dragging  
Give me a lift and Ill hay your wagon  
  
Love is a rose but you better not pick it  
Only grows when its on the vine  
Handful of thorns and youll know youve missed it  
Lose your love when you say the word mine  
  
Love is a rose but you better not pick it  
Only grows when its on the vine  
Handful of thorns and youll know youve missed it  
Lose your love when you say the word mine  
  
Mine
