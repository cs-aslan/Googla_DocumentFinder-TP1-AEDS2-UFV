Romance is gone  
Hes drifting with the stars  
A lyric in his pocket  
Little girl in his heart  
When you hears his songs  
On the radio  
I dont need to tell you  
What you already know  
Hes on Gods top ten  
Where heaven never ends  
  
You saw the world  
And the world saw you on the stage  
Wild wild wild colonial boy  
Roquefort le pont  
Your gypsy heart is free  
Pictures on the wall  
Of your family  
Hes on Gods top ten  
Where heaven never ends  
Hes on Gods top ten  
  
Babys got mommas eyes  
She was always beautiful  
When you hear his voice  
Feel his arms around you  
You remember momma smiling  
A daddys little girl  
Bad weather cold media storm  
Hes on Gods top ten  
Where heaven never ends  
Hes on Gods top ten
