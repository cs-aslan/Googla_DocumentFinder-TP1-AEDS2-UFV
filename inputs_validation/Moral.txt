These new romantics are oh so boring  
I could swear Ive been there once or twice before  
I should grow wings and just forget the club  
You know the legends never wanted to be me  
For too erratic to be OK so  
If youre concerned well I dont care  
You play games you play safe  
Me I just sighed with relief  
  
Matthews mother The change disturbs me  
Youve everybodys friend Age I suppose  
Just like religion youre going nowhere  
Like your so explicit clothes onto the floor  
On those occasions when everything broke down  
Including you and me  
  
See the boy see the girl  
The exhibition is now over
