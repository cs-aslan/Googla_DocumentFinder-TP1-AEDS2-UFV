Love is my religion Love is my religion Love is my religion  
Ill take you to the temple tonight  
  
All my days Ive been searching to find out what this life is worth  
Through the books and bibles of time Ive made up my mind  
I dont condemn I dont convert this is a calling have you heard  
Bring all the lovers to the fold cause no one is gonna lose their soul  
  
Chorus  
Love is my religion Love is my religion Love is my religion  
Hey you can take it or leave it and you dont have to believe it  
  
I dont want to fight hey lets go fly a kite  
Theres nothing that we cant cure and Ill keep you in my arms for sure  
So dont let nobody stop us free spirits have to soar  
With you I share the gift the gift that we now know oh oh oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Well Im done searching now I found out what this life is worth  
Not in the books that I find but by searching my mind  
I dont condemn I dont convert  
This is the calling have you heard bring all the lovers to the fold  
No one is gonna lose their soul  
  
Chorus
