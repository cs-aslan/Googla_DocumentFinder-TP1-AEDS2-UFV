Well Im dressed up so nice  
An Im doin my best  
An Im startin over  
Im startin over in another place  
  
Lemme tell you a story  
Big chief with a golden crown  
Hes got rings on his fingers  
And then he walks up up to the throne  
  
Hes makin shapes with his hands  
An dont choo dare sit back  
Now dont choo dare sit down  
And dont choo dare speak up  
  
And on the first day we had everything we could stand  
Ooh who couldve asked for more  
And on the second day there was nothing else left to do  
Ooh what a day that was  
  
There are fifty thousand beggars  
Roaming in the streets  
They have lost all their possessions  
They have nothing left to eat  
  
Down come a bolt of lightning  
Start an electrical storm  
Starts a chain reaction  
Go pull a fire alarm  
  
Im dreaming of a city  
It was my own invention  
I put the wheels in motion  
A time for big decisions  
  
And on the first day we had everything we could stand  
Ooh and then we let it fall  
And on the second day there was nothing else at all  
Ooh what a day that was  
  
Oh a day that was  
Ooh thats the way it goes  
Theres a million ways to get things done  
Theres a million ways to make things work out  
  
Well Im going right through  
And the light came down  
Well theyre roundin em up  
From all over town  
  
Theyre movin forward and backwards  
Theyre movin backwards and front  
And theyre enjoying themselves  
Moving in evry direction  
  
And if you feel like youre in a whirlpool  
You feel like going home  
You feel like talking to someone  
Who know the difference between right and wrong  
  
And on the first day we had everything we could stand  
Ooh and then we let it fall  
And on the second day there was nothing else left at all  
Ooh what a day that was  
Were goin boom boom boom Thats the way we live  
And in a great big room and Thats the way we live x3
