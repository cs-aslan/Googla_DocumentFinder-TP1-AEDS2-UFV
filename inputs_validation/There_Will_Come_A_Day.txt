Sometimes Im walking down the street with my head in the clouds  
I cant see what stands before me I cant feel the walls around me  
Im lost in a daydream  
A place where every child could be runnin wild running free  
It feels so natural could it be possible for this to be  
Make a wish on a star that our troubles wont last forever  
Now that weve come so far I believe that we can make it all the way  
A place where everyone can feel love happiness  
I know cant be far away  
  
Where every woman child and man need never be oppressed  
I know there will come a day  
There will come a day there comes a day there will come a day  
Yes Ive been down on my Knees with my head to the sky  
Hoping this world divided will make a stand united  
Oh happy day  
Weve seen the future within the past the price of closin our eyes  
Lets turn this situation with love and education  
Lets find a way  
  
Make a wish on a star that our troubles wont last forever  
Now that weve come so far I believe that we can make it all the way  
A place where everyone can feel love happiness  
I know cant be far away  
Every woman child and man need never be oppressed  
I know there will come a day  
A place where everyone can feel love and happiness  
I know cant be far away  
  
Where every woman child and man wont be oppressed  
I know there will come a day  
There will come a day there comes a day there will come a day  
There will come a day there comes a day there will come a day  
We got to know and understand  we are vital to the master plan  
So get ready for the fight as we proceed into the light  
Get ready for the fight for what is right
