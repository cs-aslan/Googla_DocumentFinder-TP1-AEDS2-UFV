And I want to be pretty  
Tomorrow I know Im just dirt

And I want to be pretty  
Tomorrow I know Im just dirt  
  
We are the nobodies  
Wanna be somebodies  
When were dead  
Theyll know just who we are  
We are the nobodies  
Wanna be somebodies  
When were dead  
Theyll know just who we are  
  
Yesterday I was dirty  
Wanted to be pretty  
I know now that Im forever dirt

Some children died the other day  
We fed machines and then we prayed  
Puked up and down in morbid faith  
You should have seen the ratings that day
