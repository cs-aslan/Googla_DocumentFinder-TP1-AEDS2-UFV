Beyond the reef  
Where the sea is dark and cold  
My love has gone  
And my dreams grow old  
  
Therell be no tears  
Therell be no regretting  
Will she remember me  
Will she forget  
  
Ill send a thousand flowers  
When the trade winds blow  
Ill send my lonely heart  
Cause I love her so  
  
Someday I know  
Shell come back again to me  
Til then my heart will be  
Beyond the reef  
  
Ill send a thousand flowers  
Where the trade winds blow  
Ill send my lonely heart  
Cause I love her so  
  
Someday I know  
Shell come back again to me  
Til then my heart will be  
Beyond the reef
