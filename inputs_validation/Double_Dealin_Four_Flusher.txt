Theres a change been comin over you  
Well you burn back baby now what can I do  
And all of that jive that your good friends been sellin  
It aint worth a nickel ya know I been tellin you  
And you know you could never live without my love babe  
Theres no one else who could take my place  
Blueeyed baby I love you yes I do  
Well my blueeyed baby I love you yes I do  
  
And nobody here can give the love that you need  
And Im down on my knees and Im bleedin baby  
  
Everybody tells me Im bein a fool  
Everybody tells me youre bein so cruel  
Everybody tells me but I dont believe it babe
