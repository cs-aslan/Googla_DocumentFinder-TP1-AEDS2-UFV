JESY  
I could have all the money  
All the fancy treasures in the world  
Twentyfive acres just to hold my diamonds and my pearls  
  
JADE  
But all of thats a fantasy  
Nothing like I wanna be  
Baby you and me thats real yeah  
Something like a masterpiece  
Wed be up in galleries  
You and I thats real  
  
ALL  
If I had everything it wouldnt mean a thing  
Cause nothing feels like nothing feels like you  
No matter what they say cant take my love away  
Cause nothing feels like nothing feels like you  
  
Baby even when were miles apart  
Youll always stay inside my heart  
Let me tell you no one else will do  
Cause baby nothing feels like you  
  
LEIGHANNE  
Boys will be boys I got plenty knocking at my door  
But none of them compare baby youre the one Im waiting for  
  
PERRIE  
Cause Im living in a fantasy  
Everytime youre here with me  
Kiss me if its real  
Baby you and me for keeps  
You bring out the best in me  
Now you know thats real  
  
ALL  
If I had everything it wouldnt mean a thing  
Cause nothing feels like nothing feels like you  
No matter what they say cant take my love away  
Cause nothing feels like nothing feels like you  
  
Baby even when were miles apart  
Youll always stay inside my heart  
Let me tell you no one else will do  
Cause baby nothing feels like you  
  
No nothing like ya  
No nothing like  
No nothing like ya  
No nothing like  
  
LEIGHANNE  
If I had everything it wouldnt mean a thing  
Cause nothing feels like nothing feels like you  
  
PERRIE  
No matter what they cant take my love away  
Cause nothing feels like nothing feels like you  
  
ALL  
Baby even when were miles apart  
Youll always stay inside my heart  
Let me tell you no one else will do  
Cause baby nothing feels like you  
  
And when youre gone we could be miles apart  
Ill feel the way I did from the start  
I told you nothing feels like nothing feels like you  
Baby when everythings said and done  
I hope you know that youre the only one  
I told you nothing feels like nothing feels like you  
  
No nothing like you  
No nothing like you  
No nothing like
