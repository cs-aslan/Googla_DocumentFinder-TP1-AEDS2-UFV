Dirty desire Repeat x3  
  
Theres something thats been growing inside of me  
Uh uh baby baby uh uh baby baby  
I havent been myself since we met last week  
Uh uh baby baby uh uh baby baby  
  
When Im alone at night  
I sit and fantasize  
And in my fantasies I love you long time  
Doing my nine to five  
Im thinking six and nine  
I gotta make you mine  
Can you feel my

I know you thought about it  
But its all in your head  
And you cant wait to see me  
To see me in the flesh  
I see you really need to  
Get this thing off your chest  
But all you know I gotta get you back in my nest  
  
I try to let it go  
But that made me want you more  
Cause in reality I know youre not mine  
I dont want just a fight I want the full size  
Tell her Ill pay the fine
