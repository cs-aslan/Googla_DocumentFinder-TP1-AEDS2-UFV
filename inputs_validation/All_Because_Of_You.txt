I was born a child of grace  
Nothing else about the place  
Everything was ugly but your beautiful face  
And it left me no illusion  
  
I saw you in the curve of the moon  
In the shadow cast across my room  
You heard me in my tune  
When I just heard confusion  
  
All because of you  
All because of you  
All because of you  
I amI am  
  
I like the sound of my own voice  
I didnt give anyone else a choice  
An intellectual tortoise  
Racing with your bullet train  
  
Some people get squashed crossing the tracks  
Some people got high rises on their backs  
Im not broke but you can see the cracks  
You can make me perfect again  
  
All because of you  
All because of you  
All because of you  
I amI am  
  
Im alive  
Im being born  
I just arrived Im at the door  
Of the place I started out from  
And I want back inside  
  
All because of you  
All because of you  
All because of you  
I am
