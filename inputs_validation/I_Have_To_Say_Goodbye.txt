The days with you were endless summers  
The rains would come but we didnt seem to care  
Then before I knew  
I fell in love with you  
It felt so real I wondered if you feel it too  
For many nights I stayed awake til morning  
Wondring how to ask if you cared  
Then to my surprise  
The love I had inside  
Was something that you didnt seem to share  
REFRAIN  
I have to say goodbye  
Guess its time to end it  
Say goodbye  
Its the only way  
Much as I want to cry  
There simply is no reason why  
Its hard for me  
But still Ive got to try  
If love for you cannot be with me  
Theres really nothing more to say  
Remember whoever may come to share my life  
Youll always have a special place inside  
Repeat Refrain twice  
Ive got to try  
Woh  Wooh   
Goodbye
