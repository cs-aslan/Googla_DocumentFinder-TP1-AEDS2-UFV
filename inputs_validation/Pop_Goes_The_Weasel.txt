  
  
Round and round the cobblers bench  
The monkey chased the weasel  
The monkey thought twas all in fun  
Pop Goes the weasel  
  
A penny for a spool of thread  
A penny for a needle  
Thats the way the money goes  
Pop Goes the weasel  
  
A half a pound of tupenny rice  
A half a pound of treacle  
Mix it up and make it nice  
Pop Goes the weasel  
  
Hello its me  
I was wondering if after all these years youd like to meet  
To go over everything  
They say that times supposed to heal ya  
But I aint done much healing  
  
Hello can you hear me  
Im in California dreaming about who we used to be  
When we were younger and free  
Ive forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet  
  
Theres such a difference between us  
And a million miles  
  
Hello from the other side  
I must have called a thousand times  
To tell you Im sorry for everything that Ive done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that Ive tried  
To tell you Im sorry for breaking your heart  
But it dont matter it clearly doesnt tear you apart anymore  
  
Hello how are you  
Its so typical of me to talk about myself Im sorry  
I hope that youre well  
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened  
  
Its no secret that the both of us  
Are running out of time  
  
So hello from the other side  
I must have called a thousand times  
To tell you Im sorry for everything that Ive done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that Ive tried  
To tell you Im sorry for breaking your heart  
But it dont matter it clearly doesnt tear you apart anymore  
  
Ooooohh anymore  
Ooooohh anymore  
Ooooohh anymore  
Anymore  
  
Hello from the other side  
I must have called a thousand times  
To tell you Im sorry for everything that Ive done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that Ive tried  
To tell you Im sorry for breaking your heart  
But it dont matter it clearly doesnt tear you apart anymore  
  
Up and down the London road  
In and out of the Eagle  
Thats the way the money goes  
Pop Goes the weasel  
  
Ive no time to plead and pine  
Ive no time to wheedle  
Kiss me quick and then Im gone  
Pop Goes the weasel
