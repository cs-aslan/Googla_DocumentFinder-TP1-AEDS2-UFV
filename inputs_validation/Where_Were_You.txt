Where were you  
When I wanted you to love me through the night  
Where were you  
When I wanted you to love and hold me tight  
Where were you little darlin  
When you said to pick you up after school  
I know where little lady  
Cause my mama didnt raise no fool  
  
Yeah  
Where were you  
Where were you  
Where were you  
Where were you  
  
I know where baby  
you been runnin round loose on the side  
I know where little lady  
you been runnin round with something to hide  
I dont mind darlin if youre feelin fancy and free  
I dont mind little baby  
Cause your sisters lookin real good to me  
  
Hey  
Where were you  
Where were you  
Where were you  
Where were you  
  
I didnt know what the hell was goin on  
Someday youre gonna break  
So dont try to get yourself straight  
Youre just a little too late  
  
Where were you  
Where were you  
Where were you  
Where were you  
  
Where were you  
Where were you  
Where were you  
Where were you
