The defenders settle down for the night with wine and a song  
  
Enjolras  
Marius rest  
  
Feuilly  
Drink with me  
To days gone by  
Sing with me  
The songs we knew  
  
Prouvaire  
Heres to pretty girls  
Who went to our heads  
  
Joly  
Heres to witty girls  
Who went to our beds  
  
All  
Heres to them  
And heres to you  
  
Grantaire  
Drink with me  
To days gone by  
Can it be  
You fear to die  
Will the world remember you  
When you fall  
Could it be your death  
Means nothing at all  
Is your life just one more lie  
  
Men  
Drink with me  
To days  
Gone by  
To the life  
That used  
To be  
Let the wine of friendship  
Never run dry Women  
Drink with me  
To days  
Gone by  
To the life  
That used  
To be  
At the shrine of friendship  
Never say die  
  
All  
Heres to you  
And heres  
To me  
  
Marius  
Do I care if I should die  
Now she goes across the sea  
Life without Cosette  
Means nothing at all  
Would you weep Cosette  
Should Marius fall  
Will you weep  
Cosette  
For me  
  
Marius settles down to sleep
