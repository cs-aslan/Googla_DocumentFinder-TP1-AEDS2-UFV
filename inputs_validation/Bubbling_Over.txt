Youre the one that puts the sparkle in my eyes  
Youre the one that puts the laughter in my smile  
Youre the one that puts the meaning in my life  
And Im bubblin over bubblin over bubblin over  
Because you are mine  
Bubblin over with the joy that only love can bring  
Bubblin over with the song you taught my heart to sing  
And Im so happy lovin you that anyone can see  
That Im bubblin over bubblin over bubblin over  
Because you love me  
I have never known a love that felt like this  
Youre the one I want to share my lovin with  
Your gentle way of lovin me and your thoughtfulness  
Keeps me bubblin over bubblin over bubblin over with happiness  
Bubblin over with the joy that only love can bring  
Bubblin over with the song you taught my heart to sing  
And Im so happy lovin you that anyone could see  
That Im bubblin over bubblin over bubblin over  
Because you love me  
Yes Im bubblin over Im bubblin over Im bubblin over  
Cause you love me
