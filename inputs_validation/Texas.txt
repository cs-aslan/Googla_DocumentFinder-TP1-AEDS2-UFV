Warm winds blowin  
Heat n blue sky  
And a road that goes  
Forever  
  
Been thinkin bout it lately  
Been watchin some TV  
Been lookin all around me  
and what has come to be  
Been talkin to my neighbor  
And he agrees with me  
Its all gone crazy  
  
Well my wife returns from takin  
My little girl to school she got  
Beads of perspiration  
As she tries to keep her cool  
She says Unless it dont get no better  
theres gonna come a day  
someones gonna get killed out there  
And I turn to her and say Texas  
She says What  
They got big long roads out there  
  
Warm winds blowin  
Heat n blue sky  
And a road that goes  
Forever  
Im goin to Texas onetwothree  
  
We gotta get outta here  
We gotta get outta here  
  
Well I got a little brother  
Several meters high  
Yeah hes built just like a quarterback  
And he swears hell testify  
He says hes been to Texas  
And thats the only place to be  
Big stakes big cars no trouble here  
Thats the place for me  
Im going to Texas yeah yeah  
Im going to Texas yeah yeah  
Im going to Texas  
  
Watch me walkin  
Watch me walkin  
Watch me walkin
