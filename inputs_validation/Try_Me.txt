Tell me why were never more than strangers  
Tell me why you never let it show  
  
But when youre close to me  
And whisper I need you  
In the cold mornin light  
  
Try me oh take me for a little while  
Before its over and you leave me with just a smile  
Try me oh let me be the one  
You say its over  
But for me it had just begun  
  
Tell me why we seem no more than strangers  
Tell me why the feelin never goes  
  
But when youre close to me  
And whisper I need you  
In the cold mornin light  
  
Try me oh take me for a little while  
Before its over and you leave me with just a smile  
Try me oh let me be the one  
You say its over  
But for me it had just begun
