Youre always in my heart  
From early in the mornin til its dark  
I gotta see your sweet sweet smile everyday  
  
When I wake up in the mornin  
And I see you there  
I always whisper a little prayer  
I gotta see your sweet sweet smile everyday  
  
I gotta know that you love me  
And that you want me  
And that youll always be there  
Ive gotta know that you care  
  
And I gotta feel your arms around me  
And that you need me  
And that youll always be there  
Ive gotta know that you care  
  
If my times are bringin me down  
Youre the only one that I want around  
I gotta see your sweet sweet smile everyday  
  
And if Im all strung out  
Youre the only one who can straighten me out  
I gotta see your sweet sweet smile every day  
  
I gotta know that you love me  
And that you want me  
And that youll always be there  
Ive gotta know that you care  
  
And I gotta feel your arms around me  
And that you need me  
And that youll always be there  
Ive gotta know that you care  
  
Youre always in my heart  
From early in the mornin til its dark  
I gotta see your sweet sweet smile everyday
