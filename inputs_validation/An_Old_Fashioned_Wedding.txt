Interpolated in 1966 revival  
  
Frank  
Well have an oldfashioned wedding  
Blessed in the good oldfashioned way  
  
Ill vow to love you forever  
Youll vow to love and honor and obey  
  
Somewhere in some little chapel  
Someday when orange blossoms bloom  
  
Well have an oldfashioned wedding  
A simple wedding for an oldfashioned bride and groom  
  
Annie  
I wanna wedding in a big church with bridesmaids and flower girls  
A lot of ushers in tailcoats reporters and photographers  
  
A ceremony by a bishop who will tie the knot and say  
Do you agree to love and honor Love and honor yes but not obey  
  
I wanna wedding ring surrounded by diamonds in platinum  
A big reception at the Waldorf with champagne and caviar  
  
I wanna wedding like the Vanderbilts have evrything big not small  
If I cant have that kind of a wedding I dont wanna get married at all

Frank  
Well have an oldfashioned wedding  
  
Annie  
If its not a big wedding I dont wanna get married at all
