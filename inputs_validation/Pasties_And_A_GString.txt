Smelling like a brewery looking like a tramp  
I aint got a quarter got a postage stamp  
Been five oclock shadow boxing all around the town  
Talking with the old man sleeping on the ground  
Bazanti bootin al zootin al hoot and Al Cohn  
Sharing this apartment with a telephone pole  
And a fishnet stocking spikeheel shoes  
Strip tease prick tease car keys blues  
And the porno floor show live nude girls  
Dreamy and creamy and brunette curls  
Chesty Morgan and Watermelon Rose  
Raise my rent and take off all your clothes  
With trench coats magazines a bottle full of rum  
Shes so good make a dead man come  
Pasties and a Gstring beer and a shot  
Portland through a shot glass and a Buffalo squeeze  
Wrinkles and Cherry and Twinkie and Pinkie and Fifi live from Gay Paree  
Fanfares rim shots back stage who cares all this hot burlesque for me  
scat  
Cleavage cleavage thighs and hips  
From the nape of her neck to the lipstick lips  
Chopped and channeled and lowered and louvred  
And the cheater slicks and baby moons  
Shes ahot and ready creamy and sugared  
And the band is awful and so are the tunes  
scat  
Crawling on her belly and shaking like jelly  
And Im getting harder than Chinese algebrassieres  
And cheers from the hmm compendium here  
Hey sweetheart theyre yelling for more  
Youre squashing out your cigarette butts on the floor  
And I like Shelly and you like Jane  
And what was the girl with the snakeskins name  
And its an earlybird matinee come back any day  
Get you a little something that you cant get at home  
Get you a little something that you cant get at home  
Its pasties and a Gstring beer and a shot  
Portland through a shot glass and a Buffalo squeeze  
Popcorn front row higher than a kite and Ill be back tomorrow night  
And Ill be back tomorrow night  
scat
