Give me time to realize my crime  
Let me love and steal  
I have danced inside your eyes  
How can I be real  
  
Do you really want to hurt me  
Do you really want to make me cry  
Precious kisses words that burn me  
Lovers never ask you why  
In my heart the fire is burning  
Choose my color find a star  
Precious people always tell me  
Thats a step a step too far  
  
Do you really want to hurt me  
Do you really want to make me cry  
Do you really want to hurt me  
Do you really want to make me cry  
  
Words are few  
I have spoken  
I could waste a thousand years  
Wrapped in sorrow words are token  
Come inside and catch my tears  
Youve been talking but believe me  
If its true you do not know  
This boy loves without a reason  
Im prepared to let you go  
  
If its love you want from me  
Then take it away  
Everythings not what you see its over again  
  
Do you really want to hurt me  
Do you really want to make me cry  
Do you really want to hurt me  
Do you really want to make me cry  
  
Give me time to realize my crime  
Let me love and steal  
I have danced inside your eyes  
How can I be real  
If its love you want from me then take it again
