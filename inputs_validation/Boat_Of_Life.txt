My friend is the going rough with troubled seas around  
To angry when you set your soul and dark clouds on you frown  
Have you ever looked for bread and only found a stone  
But its because youre paddling your boat of life alone  
  
Is the raft you once had charted now both blurred and marred  
Is you soul and body weary the task of rowin hard  
Have you ever looked for joy and disappointment known  
But its because youre paddling your boat of life alone  
  
My friend there is one who knows your every fault and sin  
And he knows your trouble and your whole dear life of sin  
So why not call on Jesus Hell help you safely on  
Oh my friend its foolish to paddle all alone
