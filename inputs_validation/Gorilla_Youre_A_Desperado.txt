Big gorilla at the LA Zoo  
Snatched the glasses right off my face  
Took the keys to my BMW  
Left me here to take his place  
  
I wish the ape a lot of success  
Im sorry my apartments a mess  
Most of all Im sorry if I made you blue  
Im betting the gorilla will too  
  
They say Jesus will find you wherever you go  
But when Hell come looking for you they dont know  
In the mean time keep your profile low  
Gorilla youre a desperado  
  
He built a house on an acre of land  
He called it Villa Gorilla Now  
I hear hes getting divorced  
Laying low at LErmitage of course  
  
Then the ape grew very depressed  
Went through Transactional Analysis  
He plays racquetball and runs in the rain  
Still hes shackled to a platinum chain  
  
Big gorilla at the LA Zoo  
Snatched the glasses right off my face  
Took the keys to my BMW  
Left me here to take his place
