Youre such a cool woman but I love you  
Such a cruel woman but I love you  
Open up your eyes and realize  
Youre such a fool woman but I love you  
But give me all that youve got to give  
Cause it sure feels good to me  
Im not your only man Im just your lover  
Not your only man just another  
Open up your eyes and realize  
Im gonna take what I can like any other  
Ill say any damned thing that you want me to  
Cause it dont mean a thing to me  
Well  
You lie down with dogs you fall in with thieves  
Youre gonna catch something but you do as you please  
Youre scratchin an itch that nothing can ease  
You lie down with dogs you get up with fleas  
Get out and find yourself another lover  
Why dont you find yourself another lover  
Open up your eyes and realize  
You dont mean nothing to me Im not your mother  
You gave me all that you had to give  
But theres a whole lotta fish in the sea  
Well  
You lie down with dogs you fall in with thieves  
Youre gonna catch something but you do as you please  
Youre scratchin an itch that nothing can ease  
You lie down with dogs you get up with fleas  
You lie down with dogs you fall in with thieves  
Youre gonna catch something but you do as you please  
Youre gonna catch something but you do as you please  
Youre scratchin an itch that nothing can ease  
Ooo you fall and you fall and you fall and you fall  
You lie down with dogs you get up with fleas
