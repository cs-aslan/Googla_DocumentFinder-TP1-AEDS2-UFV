Ive been searching for freedom  
Ive been looking for someone  
In the dreams of my heart I see your face  
Calling me into the light  
  
Youre the vision of beauty  
Youre so radiant and lovely  
I just cant believe youre here with me  
Your touch is my ecstasy my love  
  
Looking into the future  
We can see the beginning  
Children living in peace and harmony  
That is the way it will be
