All my life Ive been searchin  
All my life Ive been uncertain  
I been abandoned and left alone  
At fifteen I had to leave home  
The black sheep the bad seed  
  
At a roadside bar in Tennessee  
I met an angel to rescue me  
She rescued me  
She wore blue jeans and a rosary  
Believed in God and believed in me  
All her friends think shes a little crazy  
She wears a smile heart on her sleeve  
Dont give a damn what the world thinks of me  
She tells me its all good  
Shes happy with a bad seed  
Happy to be misunderstood  
  
Two packs and a pint a day  
To hide the shame  
And wash away the pain  
Aww the pain  
Every road was a deadend street  
Runnin from the law  
And runnin on empty  
You couldnt shake the marks that were left on me  
  
At a roadside bar in Tennessee  
I met an angel to rescue me  
She rescued me  
  
She wore blue jeans and a rosary  
Believed in God and believed in me  
All her friends think shes a little crazy  
She wears a smile heart on her sleeve  
Dont give a damn what the world thinks of me  
She tells me its all good  
Shes happy with a bad seed  
Happy to be misunderstood  
  
Repeat  
Misunderstood  
Misunderstood
