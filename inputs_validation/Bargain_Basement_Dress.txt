Well on a Friday night you draw your pay and you take in the town  
You leave me at home just to lose my mind for you are messin around  
But its four in the morning and you stagger in and you sure look a mess  
With a smile on your face and out stretched arms and a bargain basement dress  
I wouldnt wear that dress to a dogfight if the fight was free  
And the bargain basemant dress aint enough to get your arms around me  
Well you say when a man was hard all week he sure deserves rest  
But honey that aint right to get out of my sight with that bargain basement
dress  
 dobro  steel   
I wouldnt wear that dress to a dogfight if the fight was free  
And the bargain basemant dress aint enough to get your arms around me  
Now I took all Im a gonna take and Im a leavin you the rest  
Tell you what Ill do Ill just leave you that old bargain basement dress  
Tell you what Ill do Ill just leave you that old bargain basement dress
