Theres something on your mind  
By the way you look at me  
There is something on your mind baby  
By the way you look at me  
And what youre thinking brings happiness  
Oh and it bring misery  
  
Please please dont try to tell me  
I think I I understand  
No no dont try to tell me baby  
Cause I think I I understand  
You want me to try and forget you  
Well Ill do baby Ill do the best I can  
  
You know it hurts you when youre in love with someone  
And you know that someone dont love you  
It carries a heavy burden on your heart to know  
That the someone that youre in love with  
Is in love with your best friend  
  
And Ill tell you when someone else is rocking you  
Rocking your cradle you know better  
Than you can rock your cradle yourself  
Then theres only one thing for you to do  
  
You just pack your clothes turn around  
And slowly walk out of the door  
Look over your left shoulder as you go out  
Then you hang your head and you say  
  
Oh please dont try to tell me  
Uh huh I think I understand  
No no no no please dont try to tell me  
Because you think you think I understand  
Oh you want me to try to try to forget you baby  
And Ill tell you Ill do the best I can  
  
You know after you have done all you could do  
And you cant take no more then you go downtown  
You get your big baseball bat  
And you come back on the scene  
  
Where they both are still together  
And then you just go and kick down the door  
Now as you kick down the door you just start  
Beating the hell of everybody that you can see  
  
Everybody that comes through the door  
And just as you make up your mind that youre gonna try  
To forgive her then out comes another one of your friends  
  
And that really blows your mind so you go and think about  
You say to yourself baby I realize Ive done wrong  
But please forgive me and with a smirky smile on her face  
Then she look up at you and she say  
  
If you ever think about me  
Oh I think about you baby  
If you ever change your mind  
Oh youre staying on my mind baby  
  
If you ever think about me  
Oh I think I think about you all the time  
And if I ever cross your mind  
You stay on my mind  
  
Well you know you know  
You know Im yours  
And I know I know you got to be mine  
Yeah  
  
Theres something on your mind be  
I can tell by the way you look at me  
Oh theres something on my mind baby  
There is something on your mind  
Oh can you tell theres something on my mind  
By the way you look at me  
Oh the way I look at you you look good to me  
  
And what youre thinking brings happiness  
Yes baby  
Oh and it can bring misery  
Yes all right
