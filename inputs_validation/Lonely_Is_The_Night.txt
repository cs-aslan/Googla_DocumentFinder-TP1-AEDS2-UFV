Really thought that I could live without you  
Really thought that I could make it on my own  
Sent you away yeah I said I didnt need you  
I let you go I let you go I let you go  
Now Im so lost without you  
Now youre not here and now I know  
  
Lonely is the night when Im not with you  
Lonely is the night aint no light shining through  
Till youre in my arms till youre here by my side  
Lonely am I  
  
Never thought that I that I would need you  
Never thought that I that Id be missing you  
Gotta get you back  
I just got to find a way now  
To let you know to let you know to let you know  
That Im so lost without you  
And now this world it just aint right  
  
Lonely is the night when Im not with you  
Lonely is the night aint no light shining through  
Till youre in my arms till youre here by my side  
Lonely am I  
  
I can make it through the day  
I can fake it okay  
I just smile and pretend  
And I tell myself Ill be alright  
  
But lonely is the night  
Lonely is the night
