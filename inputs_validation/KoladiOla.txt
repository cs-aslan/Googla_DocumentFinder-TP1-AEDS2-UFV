KoladiOla  
KoladiOla  
  
Im gonna making  
You want to shake me  
People sitting out of my mind  
KoladiOla  
  
Im going down  
Everythings around  
Everything is good and divine  
  
I go bananas  
Driving in my car  
Trying not to lose my ways  
  
KoladiOla  
Again  
  
KoladiOla  
One more time  
KoladiOla  
One more time  
  
Im going down  
Everythings around  
Everything is good and divine  
And I said  
Again  
  
I go bananas  
Driving in my car  
Trying not to lose my way  
  
KoladiOla  
Again  
KoladiOla  
  
Im gonna making  
You want to shake me  
People sitting out of my mind  
  
Im going down  
Everythings around  
Everything is good and divine
