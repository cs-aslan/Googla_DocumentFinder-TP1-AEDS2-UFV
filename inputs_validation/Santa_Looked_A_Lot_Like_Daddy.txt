Well Santa looked a lot like daddy  
Or daddy looked a lot like him  
Its not the way I had him pictured  
Santa was much too thin  
  
Chorus  
He didnt come down the chimney  
So mama must have let him in  
Santa looked a lot like daddy  
Or daddy looked a lot like him  
  
Well they thought I was fastasleppin  
They thought that I was tucked in his bed  
They never thought Id come apeepin  
Or that Id hear what was said  
  
Santa put his arm around mama  
And mama put her arm around him  
So if Santa Claus aint daddy  
Well then Im a gonna tell on them  
  
Chorus  
  
I never saw Dancer or Prancer  
I never heard the sleigh bells ring  
I never saw a rednosed reindeer  
Like they show on the TV screen  
  
But he sure brought lots of presents  
So Santa Claus he must have been  
Well he sure looked a lot like daddy  
Or daddy looked a lot like him  
  
Chorus
