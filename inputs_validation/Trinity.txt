Im sleeping with my one eye open  
Cause I think you gonna come for me  
Youre sleeping with your gun in hand  
Cause you think Im gonna make  
Me move  
  
Ive been chasing white people all my life  
Youve been chasing black people all  
Your life  
Now that we know where we went  
Wrong its time some truth came out here  
  
You going to educate me  
About white people  
I will educate you about Black people and well unite  
Thats why they call me trinity  
And my game is unity  
  
Chorus  
Trinity unity  
  
My brothers have been chasing racists all the time  
Your brothers have been chasing freedom fighters all the time  
But at the end of the day  
We didnt know much about each other yeah  
  
When you saw a black man  
You saw a criminal  
When I saw a white man  
I saw an oppressor  
But now that we know where we went wrong  
Lets unite  
  
You will educate me about white people  
I will educated you about black people  
  
That is why they call my trinity  
Cause my game is unity  
  
Chorus Repeats
