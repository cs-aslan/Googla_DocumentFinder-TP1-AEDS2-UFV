Last night was the last night  
Youll ever spend alone  
Couldnt wait  
Did it in the living room  
Soon as I saw you baby I had plans  
Plans to do it til we have a baby  
Even if the world is crazy  
Pick some names boy or girl  
Then well change change the world  
  
So after you change your clothes  
Girl if you change your mind  
Im ready whatever time  
  
Its the beginning of forever  
You dont have to go  
Sometimes you just know  
Its the beginning of forever  
It dont have to end  
Keep doing it and doing it again oh  
Keep doing it and doing it again oh  
  
Last time was the last time  
I was worn and done  
You the best thats why I want another one  
Soon as I saw you baby I had plans  
Planned to take you to my elevator  
And cook a little breakfast later  
Pick a place and go there girl  
Then well change change the world  
  
So after you change your clothes  
Girl if you change your mind  
Im ready whatever time  
  
Its the beginning of forever  
You dont have to go  
Sometimes you just know  
Its the beginning of forever  
It dont have to end  
Keep doing it and doing it again oh  
Keep doing it and doing it again oh
