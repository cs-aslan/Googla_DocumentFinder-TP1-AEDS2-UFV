Have some pittie on an easterner  
Show a little sympathy  
No one could possible could be steerner  
Than you have been with me  
  
A theres a job that Im applying for  
Let me put it to ya thus  
Theres a partner ship Im dien for  
Mr and Mrs us  
  
So before you file it on the shelf  
Let me tell you of myself  
  
Oh Im the chapie to make ya happy  
Ill tie your shoesies and chase you bluesies  
Oh lady would ya could ya use me  
  
Now Id shake the mat out  
And let the cat out  
Ill clean the garret  
And feed the parrot  
Oh lady would ya oh tell me could ya use me  
  
Do ya realize what a good man your getting in me  
Im no elker mason or woodman who gets home at three  
The girls that see me grow soft and dreamy  
But Im a gander that wont falander  
Oh could ya use me cause I certainly could use you  
  
Theres a chap I know in Mexico  
Whos as strong as he can be  
Eating nails and drinking Texaco  
He is the type for me  
  
There is one I California  
More romantic far than you  
When he sings ha cha cha chornia  
I often think hell do  
  
But as for you sir Im afraid  
You will never make the grade  
  
For your no cowboy your soft and how boy  
I feel no mussel thats fit for tussle  
I must refuse you I cannot use you  
  
scuse me  
  
No night life for the  
Birds would bore youthe cows wont know you  
A horse would throw you  
You silly man you  
To ask me can you use me  
  
Ha  
  
Though at love you may be a wizard Im wanting to know  
Could you warm me up in a blizzard  
Say forty below  
Your ties are freakish  
Your knees are weakish  
Your not a zender you elbow bender  
Though you can use me  
I most certainly cant use you
