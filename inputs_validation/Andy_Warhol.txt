This is Andy Warhole and its take one take one  
Its its Warhol actually  
What did I say  
Whole its whole as in wholes  
Andy Warhol  
Wah Andy War hol Andy War hol he  
Like whole hub  
He  
Ha  
Are you ready  
Yeah  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha  
  
Like to take a cement fix  
Be a standing cinema  
Dress my friends up just for show  
See them as they really are  
Put a peephole in my brain  
Two New Pence to have a go  
Id like to be a gallery  
Put you all inside my show  
  
Andy Warhol looks a scream  
Hang him on my wall  
Andy Warhol Silver Screen  
Cant tell them apart at all  
  
Andy walking Andy tired  
Andy take a little snooze  
Tie him up when hes fast asleep  
Send him on a pleasant cruise hm hm hm  
When he wakes up on the sea  
He sure to think of me and you  
Hell think about paint and hell think about glue  
What a jolly boring thing to do  
  
Andy Warhol looks a scream  
Hang him on my wall  
Andy Warhol Silver Screen  
Cant tell them apart at all  
  
Andy Warhol looks a scream  
Hang him on my wall  
Andy Warhol Silver Screen  
Cant tell them apart at all
