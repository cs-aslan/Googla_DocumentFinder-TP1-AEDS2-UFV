Baby I get so scared inside and I dont really understand  
Is it love thats on my mind or is it fantasy  
Heaven is in the palm of my hand and its waiting here for you  
What am I supposed to do with a childhood tradgedy  
  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain unchanged  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain the same  
  
Sometimes its hard to hold on so hard to hold on to my dreams  
It isnt always what it seems when youre face to face with me  
Like a dagger you stick me in the heart and taste the blood from my blade  
And when we sleep would you shelter me in your warm and darkened grave  
  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain unchanged  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain the same  
  
Will you ever take me  
No I just cant take the pain  
Would you ever trust me  
No Ill never feel the same oh  
  
instrumental  
  
I know Ive been so hard on you  
I know Ive told you lies  
If I could have just one more wish  
Id wipe the cobwebs from my eyes  
  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain unchanged  
If I close my eyes forever  
Would it all remain the same Oh yeah  
  
Close your eyes  
Close your eyes  
You gotta close your eyes for me
