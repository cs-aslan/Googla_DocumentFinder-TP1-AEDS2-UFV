Your skin attached is a fragile cliche  
Of my broken heart attack  
You should swallow your teeth and hang out  
Stay for a while  
If your hearts still beating it must be blood  
If your lungss still working it must be mud  
If its still light then a kick in the ribs  
Todays worth living  
  
I dont see anything now  
So just say what you want to say  
Its kind of funny how youre not listening anyway  
  
Lights out I cant stand to hear you scream while  
Were making love I was fast asleep  
And the night sky better give something up  
  
I dont see anything now  
So just say what you want to say  
Its kind of funny how Im not listening anyway  
  
Lights out  
Lights out I cant stand to hear you scream while  
Were making love I was fast a sleep  
  
If your hearts still beating it must be blood  
If your lungs still working it must be mud  
If its still light out then a kick in the ribs  
Todays worth living Then it probably is  
  
I dont see anything now  
So just say what you want to say  
Its kind of funny how Im not listening anyway  
I dont see anything now  
So just say what you want to say  
Its kind of funny how Im not listening anyway  
Im not listening anyway  
Im not listening anyway  
Im not listening  
  
Listening Im not listening  
Im not listening  
Im not listening  
Im not listening
