Oh it seemed forever stopped today  
All the lonely hearts in London  
Caught a plane and flew away  
And all the best women are married  
All the handsome men are gay  
You feel deprived  
  
Yeah are you questioning your size  
Is there a tumour in your humour  
Are there bags under your eyes  
Do you leave dents where you sit  
Are you getting on a bit  
Will you survive  
You must survive  
  
When theres no love in town  
This new century keeps bringing you down  
All the places you have been  
Trying to find a love supreme  
A love supreme  
  
Oh what are you really looking for  
Another partner in your life to  
Abuse and to adore  
Is it lovey dovey stuff  
Do you need a bit of rough  
Get on your knees  
  
Yeah turn down the love songs that you hear  
Cause you cant avoid the sentiment  
That echoes in your ear  
Saying love will stop the pain  
Saying love will kill the fear  
Do you believe  
You must believe  
When theres no love in town  
This new century keeps bringing you down  
All the places you have been  
Trying to find a love supreme  
A love supreme  
  
I spy with my little eye  
Something beginning with ah  
Got my back up  
And now shes screaming  
So Ive got to turn the track up  
Sit back and watch the royalties stack up  
I know this girl she likes to switch teams  
And Im a fiend but Im living for a love supreme  
  
When theres no love in town  
This new century keeps bringing you down  
All the places you have been  
Trying to find a love supreme  
A love supreme  
  
Come and live a love supreme  
Dont let it get you down  
Everybody lives for love  
  
Come and live a love supreme  
Dont let it get you down  
Everybody lives for love
