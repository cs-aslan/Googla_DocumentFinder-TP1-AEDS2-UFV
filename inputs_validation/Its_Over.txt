Im here  
Wide awake again  
Theres fear  
Theres something I call a friend  
Hello again  
Its been a while since I saw you here  
I dont remember you saying goodbye no  
  
It dont matter its over  
here Ive been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
It dont matter its over  
here Ive been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
Here we go  
Jump to the stars above  
So low  
Why do I fall to love  
Hello my love  
  
This voice never called your name  
This boy will never be the same  
  
Oh it dont matter its over  
here Ive been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
It dont matter its over  
here Ive been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
Dont let it end up this way  
Dont spend another night afraid  
Dont let it end up this way hey  
  
It dont matter its over  
here Ive been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
It dont matter its over  
here Ive been waiting  
All my life  
All this time  
  
Im here  
Wide awake again
