Hey boy dont be shy  
Waiting all alone  
Think about what you can give  
Some boys never learn  
Thats the way to live  
And its the secret  
To getting it right  
  
Living carefully always filled with doubt  
Scared to make a move too soon  
Just once take a chance  
She will take one too  
Cause thats the secret  
To getting it right  
  
Its not who loves you as how much do you love  
And whats in your heart that shows what youre made of  
Youre made of love hey boy  
Its all right  
Someone understands  
You dont have so far to go  
Reach out for her hand  
Then youll really know  
The secret to getting it right  
  
Youre made of love hey boy

Reach out take her hand  
Then youll really know
