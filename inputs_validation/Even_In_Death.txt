Give me a reason to believe that youre gone  
I see your shadow so I know theyre all wrong  
Moonlight on the soft brown earth  
It leads me to where you lay  
They took you away from me but now Im taking you home  
  
Chorus  
I will stay forever here with you  
My love  
The softly spoken words you gave me  
Even in death our love goes on  
  
Some say Im crazy for my love oh my love  
But no bonds can hold me from your side oh my love  
They dont know you cant leave me  
They dont hear you singing to me  
  
Chorus  
  
And I cant love you anymore than I do
