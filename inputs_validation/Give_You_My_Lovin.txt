Give you my lovin  
Seven days a week  
Ill be your honey  
If youll be sweet  
I know Im the only one for you  
I know that you think this is not true  
  
Man says its rainin  
Rainin outside  
Ill be out there in a little while  
Cause you see  
Rain reminds me of you  
And everything has turned to you  
  
See you in places  
Im following you  
Youll be upstairs  
And Ill be there too  
Everywhere you go  
I will follow  
I know it wont be the same tomorrow  
  
People give me warnings  
Stay away from you  
They say youll hurt me  
I dont think thats true  
Discomfort arouses when I speak of you  
As if youve been sayin something bad  
About me  
  
When I see you  
I want to kiss you  
But I know that aint right  
So I ask if I can hold you  
Oh babe I need you so bad  
Oh babe I only want to make you  
Glad
