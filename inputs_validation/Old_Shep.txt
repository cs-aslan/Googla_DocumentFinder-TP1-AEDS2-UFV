When I was a lad and old Shep was a pup  
Over hills and meadows wed stray  
Just a boy and his dog we were both full of fun  
We grew up together that way  
  
I remember the time at the old mill pond  
When I wouldve drowned beyond doubt  
But old Shep was right there to the rescue he came  
He jumped in and helped pull me out  
  
As the years passed and rolled at last he grew old  
And his eyesight was fast growing dim  
Then one day the doctor looked at me and said  
I cant do no more for him Jim  
  
I went to his side and sat on the ground  
And laid his old head on my knee  
Well he was the best friend that I ever had  
I cried so I scarcely could see  
  
Old Sheppie he knew he was going to go  
For he reached out and licked at my hand  
He looked up at me just as much as to say  
Were parting but you understand  
  
Now old Sheppie is gone where the good doggies go  
And no more with old Shep will I roam  
But if dogs have a heaven theres one thing for sure  
Old Shep has a wonderful home
