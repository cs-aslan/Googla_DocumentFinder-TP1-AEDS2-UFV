Through the years  
Weve had our ups and downs  
Aint been a block  
We havent been around  
  
Weve been one step up  
And two steps back  
But our loves gotten  
Right back on track  
  
Were still goin strong  
Like a freight train  
Burnin on a midnight run  
Were rollin right along  
Still goin strong  
  
In tryin times  
When push came down to shove  
Wed pull together  
And show what were made of  
  
With a lot of love  
And a little faith  
We moved every mountain  
In our way  
  
Were still goin strong  
With a fire thats hotter  
Than the desert sun  
Were still turnin on  
Still goin strong  
  
Its still as good  
As its ever been  
Our loves just gettin  
Its second wind  
  
Were still goin strong  
Two hearts poundin  
Like a rock and roll drum  
Lovin all night long  
Still goin strong  
  
Were still goin strong  
Like a freight train  
Burnin on a midnight run  
Were rollin right along  
Still goin strong  
  
Still goin strong  
Goin strong  
Still goin strong  
Goin strong  
Still goin strong  
Goin strong
