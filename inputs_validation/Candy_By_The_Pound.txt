Well Im keeping off the streets since you came to town  
Since you claimed my heart from the lost and found  
I have said goodbye to my fooling around  
Now you and me babe we got candy by the pound  
You and me babe we got candy by the pound  
  
Well I never knew it could feel so good  
Be the king of the hill in my neighbourhood  
Rain on my roof what a sweet sound  
Oh with you underneath its like candy by the pound  
With you underneath its like candy by the pound  
  
You can tell everybody that this girl of mine  
Is sweeter than the grapes hanging from the vine  
Love like wine honey drinking till I drown  
Keep it coming baby like candy by the pound  
  
Oh no whats come over me  
If I am dreaming then let me sleep  
Oh wow Im heaven bound  
Love is getting sweeter than candy by the pound  
  
Now Im ducking in the alley of common sense  
Hiding from the claws of my old girl friend  
Shes screaming murder beating my door down  
While Im right behind it Im eating candy by the pound  
Im right behind it eating Im candy by the pound
