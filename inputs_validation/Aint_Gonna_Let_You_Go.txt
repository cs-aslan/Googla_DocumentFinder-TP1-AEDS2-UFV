Love came and hit me  
Straight on the lips  
The longer were kissin  
The better it gets and baby thats all right  
You got me standing beside myself  
You know it aint like me  
Its like Im somebody else  
But baby thats all right  
  
Youre not the man I was lookin for  
Youre every bit of him plus a whole lot more  
Now that I got you it feels so good  
I dont wanna let you go  
  
I plead guilty babe of this terrible crime  
You been lovin me all of this time  
I mustve been blind  
Whats gonna happen  
Whatll I do  
Whatever it is I wanna do it with you  
I feel just fine  
  
Youre not the man I was lookin for  
Youre every bit of him plus a whole lot more  
Now that I got you babe it feels so good  
I dont wanna let you go  
  
And aint it peculiar how loves comes about  
When youre not lookin youd better look out  
  
Youre not the man I was lookin for  
Youre every bit of him plus a whole lot more  
Feels so good now that I got you to myself  
Im gonna keep you for myself  
Now that I got you  
I dont wanna let you go  
Dont wanna let you go  
  
Youre not the man I was looking for  
Youre every bit of him plus a whole lot more  
Now that I got you babe it feels so good  
I dont wanna let you go  
Now that I got you babe I dont wanna let you go
