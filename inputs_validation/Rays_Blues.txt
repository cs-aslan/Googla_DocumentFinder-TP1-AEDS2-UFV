Well have you ever woke up in the morning sometimes  
Just about the break of day  
Well have you ever woke up in the morning sometimes  
Just about the break of day  
  
Reach over and feel the pillow baby  
Where your sweet man used to lay  
  
Well baby its so lonesome by myself  
Well its so lonesome baby just sleeping all by myself  
Well I dont want nobody but my baby  
Shouting my babys loving somebody else  
  
Oh baby wont you please hear my plea  
Hallelujah I said oh oh baby wont you please hear my plea  
Well wherever you may be darling  
Bring your fine self home to me
