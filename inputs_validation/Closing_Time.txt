Ah were drinking and were dancing  
And the band is really happening  
And the johnny walker wisdom running high  
And my very sweet companion  
Shes the angel of compassion  
Shes rubbing half the world against her thigh  
And every drinker every dancer  
Lifts a happy face to thank her  
The fiddler fiddles something so sublime  
All the women tear their blouses off  
And the men they dance on the polkadots  
And its partner found its partner lost  
And its hell to pay when the fiddler stops  
Its closing time  
Yeah the women tear their blouses off  
And the men they dance on the polkadots  
And its partner found its partner lost  
And its hell to pay when the fiddler stops  
Its closing time  
  
Ah were lonely were romantic  
And the ciders laced with acid  
And the holy spirits crying wheres the beef  
And the moon is swimming naked  
And the summer night is fragrant  
With a mighty expectation of relief  
So we struggle and we stagger  
Down the snakes and up the ladder  
To the tower where the blessed hours chime  
And I swear it happened just like this  
A sigh a cry a hungry kiss  
The gates of love they budged an inch  
I cant say much has happened since  
But closing time  
  
I swear it happened just like this  
A sigh a cry a hungry kiss  
The gates of love they budged an inch  
I cant say much has happened since  
Closing time  
  
I loved you for your beauty  
But that doesnt make a fool of me  
You were in it for your beauty too  
And I loved you for your body  
Theres a voice that sounds like god to me  
Declaring declaring declaring that your bodys really you  
And I loved you when our love was blessed  
And I love you now theres nothing left  
But sorrow and a sense of overtime  
And I missed you since the place got wrecked  
And I just dont care what happens next  
Looks like freedom but it feels like death  
Its something in between I guess  
Its closing time  
  
Yeah I missed you since the place got wrecked  
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex  
Looks like freedom but it feels like death  
Its something in between I guess  
Its closing time  
  
Yeah were drinking and were dancing  
But theres nothing really happening  
And the place is dead as heaven on a Saturday night  
And my very close companion  
Gets me fumbling gets me laughing  
Shes a hundred but shes wearing  
Something tight  
And I lift my glass to the awful truth  
Which you cant reveal to the ears of youth  
Except to say it isnt worth a dime  
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice  
And its once for the devil and once for christ  
But the boss dont like these dizzy heights  
Were busted in the blinding lights  
Busted in the blinding lights  
Of closing time  
  
The whole damn place goes crazy twice  
And its once for the devil and once for christ  
But the boss dont like these dizzy heights  
Were busted in the blinding lights  
Busted in the blinding lights  
Of closing time  
  
Oh the women tear their blouses off  
And the men they dance on the polkadots  
Its closing time  
And its partner found its partner lost  
And its hell to pay when the fiddler stops  
Its closing time  
I swear it happened just like this  
A sigh a cry a hungry kiss  
Its closing time  
The gates of love they budged an inch  
I cant say much has happened since  
But closing time  
I loved you when our love was blessed  
I love you now theres nothing left  
But closing time  
I miss you since the place got wrecked  
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex
