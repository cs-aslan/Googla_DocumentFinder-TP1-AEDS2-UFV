Chorus  
Love doesnt ask why  
It speaks from the heart  
And never explains  
Dont you know that  
Love doesnt think twice  
It can come all at once  
Or whisper from a distance  
  
Dont ask me if this feelings right or wrong  
It doesnt have to make much sense  
It just has to be this strong  
Cause when youre in my arms I understand  
We dont try to have a voice  
When our hearts make the choices  
Theres no plan  
Its in our hands  
  
Chorus  
  
Now I can feel what youre afraid to say  
If you give your soul to me  
Will you give too much away  
We cant let this moment pass us by  
Cant question this chance  
Or expect any answers  
We can try  
But love doesnt ask you why  
  
So lets take what we found  
And wrap it around us  
  
Chorus  
  
Love doesnt ask why
