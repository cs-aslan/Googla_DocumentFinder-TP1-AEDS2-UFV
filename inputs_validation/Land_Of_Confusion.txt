I mustve dreamed a thousand dreams  
Been haunted by a million screams  
I can hear the marching feet  
Theyre moving into the street  
  
Now did you read the news today  
They say the dangers gone away  
But I can see the fires still alight  
Burning into the night  
  
Too many men  
Too many people  
Making too many problems  
And not much love to go round  
Cant you see  
This is a land of confusion  
  
This is the world we live in  
And these are the hands were given  
Use them and lets start trying  
To make it a place worth living in  
  
Superman where are you now  
When everythings gone wrong somehow  
The men of steel men of power  
Are losing control by the hour  
  
This is the time  
This is the place  
So we look for the future  
But theres not much love to go round  
Tell me why this is a land of confusion  
  
This is the world we live in  
And these are the hands were given  
Use them and lets start trying  
To make it a place worth living in  
  
I remember long ago  
When the sun was shining  
The stars were bright  
All through the night  
And the sound of your laughter  
As I held you tight  
So long ago  
  
I wont be coming home tonight  
My generation will put it right  
Were not just making promises  
That we know well never keep  
  
Too many men  
Too many people  
Making too many problems  
And not much love to go round  
Cant you see  
This is a land of confusion  
  
This is the world we live in  
And these are the hands were given  
Use them and lets start trying  
To make it a place worth fighting for  
  
This is the world we live in  
And these are the names were given  
Stand up and lets start showing  
Just where our lives are going to
