Im in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until lifes no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But Im in a hurry and dont know why  
  
Dont know why  
I have to drive so fast  
My car has nothing to prove  
Its not new  
But itll do 0 to 60 in 52  
  
Oh Im in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until lifes no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But Im in a hurry and dont know why  
  
Cant be late  
I leave plenty of time  
Shaking hands with the clock  
I cant stop  
Im on a roll and Im ready to rock  
  
Oh Im in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until lifes no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But Im in a hurry and dont know why  
  
I hear a voice  
That says Im running behind  
I better pick up my pace  
Its a race  
And there aint no room  
For someone in second place  
  
Im in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until lifes no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But Im in a hurry and dont know why  
  
Im in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until lifes no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But Im in a hurry and dont know why  
  
Im in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until lifes no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But Im in a hurry and dont know why  
  
Im in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until lifes no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But Im in a hurry and dont know why
