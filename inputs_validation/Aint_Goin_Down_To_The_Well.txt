Well they call me William The Pleaser  
I sold opium fireworks and lead  
Now Im telling my troubles to strangers  
When the shadows get long Ill be dead  
  
Now her hair was as black as a bucket of tar  
Skin was as white as a cuttlefish bone  
I left Texas to follow Lucinda  
Now Ill never see heaven or home  
  
I made a wish on silver of moonlight  
A sly grin and a bowl full of stars  
Like a kid who captures a firefly  
And leaves it only to die in the jar  
  
As I kick at the clounds at my hanging  
As I swing out over the crowd  
I will search every face for Lucindas  
And she will off with me down to hell  
  
I thought Id broke loose of Lucinda  
The rain returned and so did the wind  
I cast this burden on the god thats within me  
I leave this old world and go free  
  
The devil dances inside empty pockets  
But she never wanted money or pearls  
No that wasnt enough for Lucinda  
She wasnt that kind of girl  
  
Now Ive fallen from grace for Lucinda  
Whoever thought that hell would be so cold  
I did well for an old tin can sailor  
But she wanted the bell in my soul  
  
Ive spoken to God on the mountain  
And Ive swam in the Irish sea  
I ate fire and drank from the Ganges  
And Ill beg there for mercy for me  
  
I thought Id broke loose of Lucinda  
The rain returned and so did the wind  
I was standing outside the Whitehorse  
Oh but I was afraid to go in  
  
I heard someone pull the trigger  
Her breasts heaved in the moonlight again  
There was a smear of gold in the window  
And then I was the jewel of her sin  
  
They call me William The Pleaser  
I sold opium fireworks and lead  
Now Im telling my troubles to strangers  
When the shadows get long Ill be dead  
  
Now her hair was as black as a bucket of tar  
Skin was as white as a cuttlefish bone  
I left Texas to follow Lucinda  
Now Ill never see heaven or home  
No Ill never see heaven or home  
No Ill never see heaven or home
