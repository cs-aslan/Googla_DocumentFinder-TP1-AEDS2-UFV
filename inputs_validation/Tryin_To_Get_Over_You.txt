You could have given me a million reasons why  
But it wouldnt change a thing  
You said it all when you said goodbye  
And you took off your wedding ring  
  
Ive been tryin to get over you  
Ive been spending time alone  
Ive been tryin to get over you  
But itll take dyin to get it done  
  
All my friends keep tryin to fix me up  
They say I need somebody new  
When it comes to love Ive all but given up  
Cause life dont mean nothin without you  
  
Ive been tryin to get over you  
Ive been spending time alone  
Ive been tryin to get over you  
But itll take dyin to get it done
