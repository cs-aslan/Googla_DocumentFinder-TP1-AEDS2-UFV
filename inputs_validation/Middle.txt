I knew where I was going when you left the room  
Youre the kinda guy that makes me want to  
Follow through to you  
Ive been trying to leave you for the longest time  
The second that I saw you I just knew I found my right guy  
  
I like it Repeat x6  
  
Chorus  
I wanna crash  
I wanna fall  
I wanna be somewhere in the middle  
Somewhere in the middle  
Something  
Its better than nothing  
I just need a little  
I just need a little cause I  
Dont wanna be nowhere  
But somethings makin me go there  
Somewhere in the middle with you  
  
I like it Repeat x6  
  
Losing my direction  
Thats the way it should be  
Feeling a connection  
When youre standing next to me  
I wanna be rolling  
I just wanna be rolling with you  
  
All of the things you say  
I like it  
Taking me far away  
I like it  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby you take me  
You wanna take me from this crazy place  
Baby  
Cause I just need a little  
I just need a little  
Somewhere in the middle with you  
  
Chorus  
  
Crash  
Fall  
I like it I like it  
Somewhere in the middle with you
