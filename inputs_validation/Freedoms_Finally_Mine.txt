Freedoms Finally Mine  
Im on a red dirt road winding up to a sky of blue  
And I left the blacktop back about a mile or two  
No more sittin at home leave the TV and the telephone far behind  
This life is killin us all back roads are lookin mighty fine  
Oh and  
  
Chorus  
Freedoms finally mine  
I aint takin anymore  
Yeah freedoms finally mine Its finally mine  
I aint takin anymore  
Oh freedoms finally mine  
  
Id like to throw out this cellular  
And kick off these shopshined shoes  
Leave the kids at your mamas  
And take off to Timbuktu  
So give me two sets of mudgrip tracks  
Leadin off to way out back o yonder  
Theres no mountain I cant climb  
To satisfy this need of mine to wander  
Oh cause  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres no desert I cant cross  
No river too wide  
I can do what I want now  
Cause freedoms finally mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh freedom oh freedom Its finally mine yeah its mine  
Its finally mine yeah its mine
