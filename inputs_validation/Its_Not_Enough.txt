If you want my love tell me bout tomorrow  
Cause I cant wait one more day  
Cold in the night waiting for a promise  
So all alone Im hanging on  
  
Woman dont play this game  
Youll never get my lovin this way  
All this time youve been livin for the moment  
It works for some but not for me no  
  
Chorus  
Its not enough to tell me you love me  
Its not enough to tell me that you care Yeah  
Its not enough to tell me you want me  
Darlin you know deep inside  
If you want my love then girl you must show me  
Not enough Oh show me girl  
  
We can make it last if we hold on till tomorrow  
Or will we throw it away  
Empty words you say you want to please me  
But half a heart wont make it right  
  
Its not enough to tell me you love me  
Its not enough to tell me that you cried Yeah  
Its not enough to tell me youre sorry  
Darlin you know deep inside  
If you want my love then girl you must show me  
Not enough  
  
Empty words you say you want to please me  
But half a heart wont make it right no  
  
Its not enough to tell me you love me  
Its not enough to tell me that you care Yeah  
Its not enough to tell me you want me  
Darlin you know  
Not enough to tell me you need me  
Its not enough to tell me that you cried Yeah  
Its not enough to tell me youre sorry  
Darlin you know deep inside  
Its just not enough Not enough  
  
Oh if you really want to know girl Not enough  
What it takes if you want my love
