Well this is just between us but between us lets get high  
In pictures I have seen her and to see her is truly fine  
Shes on fire  
Shes on fire  
Flowers in her evening set I get the feeling she wont forget  
And theres times youd long to be her but to be her is surely blinding  
Shes on fire  
Shes on fire  
Shes on to me  
And Im over me  
Shes on fire  
  
And if I could be inside her light  
I would steal enough to make my way into the night  
And if I could be inside her light I might just find Id be alright  
  
Well its not just a daydream if you decide to make it your life  
And this is not between us but between us lets keep getting back to where
its  
from  
Shes on fire  
Shes on fire  
Shes on to me  
And Im over me  
Shes on fire  
Shes on to me  
And Im over me  
Shes over me  
And Im on to her  
Shes on fire  
Shes on fire  
Shes on fire
