525 August fifth 1962  
Found her lying on her chest  
Her face all turning blue  
You think it was an overdose  
But could it have been the pact  
Could it have been the Kennedys  
Was it LAPD  
  
It aint a mystery  
Baby not to me  
Funny funny funny mystery  
Baby not to me  
  
Rotted corpse sex decay  
Breasts all full of slugs  
No answer for the accident  
Her cunt has all dried up you see  
  
525 August fifth 1962  
Make it seem a suicide  
Make it seem a suicide  
Make it seem a suicide  
Make it seem a suicide  
  
It aint a mystery  
Baby not to me  
Funny funny funny mystery  
Baby not to me  
  
It aint a mystery  
Baby not to me  
Funny funny funny mystery  
Baby not to me  
  
Whoa whoa whoa whoaoh
