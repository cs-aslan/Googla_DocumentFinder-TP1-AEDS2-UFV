Any time you want me  
Any time at all  
Any time you need me  
All you gotta do is call  
Any time you want me  
Any time at all  
Any time you need me  
All you gotta do is call  
  
Im no dog Im a dolphin  
I just dont live in the sea  
You feel my flow and you flood my brain  
Show me your vision your wild apparition  
And sink to the depths of your soul  
  
One love we dont need another love  
One love one heart and one soul  
We can have it all  
Easy peasy  
  
Any time you want me  
Any time at all  
Any time you need me  
All you gotta do is call  
  
You put me one step clear of the chain gang  
And two miles over the line  
All the scenes I saw left me wanting more  
Show me a vision you wild apparition  
And sink to the depths of your soul  
  
One love we dont need another love  
One love one heart and one soul  
  
Your fruits in season  
And these feet fall surely sound  
And what goes up must come down  
Turns into dust or turns into stone
