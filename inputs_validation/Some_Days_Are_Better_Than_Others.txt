Some days are dry some days are leaky  
Some days come clean other days are sneaky  
Some days take less but most days take more  
Some slip through your fingers and onto the floor  
  
Some days youre quick but most days youre speedy  
Some days you use more force than is necessary  
Some days just drop in on us  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days it all adds up  
And what you got is not enough  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days are slippy other days sloppy  
Some days you cant stand the sight of a puppy  
Your skin is white but you think youre a brother  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days you wake up with her complaining  
Some sunny days you wish it was raining  
Some days are sulky some days have a grin  
And some days have bouncers and wont let you in  
  
Some days you hear a voice  
Taking you to another place  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days are honest some days are not  
Some days youre thankful for what youve got  
Some days you wake up in the army  
And some days its the enemy  
  
Some days are work most days youre lazy  
Some days you feel like a bit of a baby  
Lookin for Jesus and His mother  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days you feel ahead  
Youre making sense of what she said  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days you hear a voice  
Taking you to another place  
Some days are better than others
