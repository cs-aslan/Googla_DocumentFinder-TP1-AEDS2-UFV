I heard you scratching on my back door  
I could smell what you come here for  
You brought your politics and glue  
And your phoney piece of paper too  
Yeah youll be shaking in your shoes  
When I tell everybody the news  
The devils just been using you  
The devils just been using you  
The devils just been using you  
The devils just been using you  
I saw you walking all alone  
Your face was hollow to the bone  
You were talking to St John about a revolution  
That was the kind of trip youre on total destruction  
Yeah youll be turning in your grave  
Its just no way to behave  
The devils just been using you  
Bridge after instrumental  
Yeah youll be shivering inside  
When you realise  
The devils just been using you  
The devils just been using you repeat  
chant at end  
Peace will never come into your life if you believe the  
Words he whispers in your mind its just a piece of  
Conciousness that hangs around to let us know that  
Love is waiting to embrace us all
