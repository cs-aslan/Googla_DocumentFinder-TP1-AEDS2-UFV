Dont look back thatll get you nowhere  
A wall to wall suit and space circus hair  
One step forward one step back  
Thats what happens and thats a fact  
  
To tell the truth you raise up your hand  
Dont write me no invitations in the sand  
And when you talk say what you mean  
Just keep it dry lord and keep it clean  
  
Chorus  
Watch out for la booga rooga  
Some you win and some you loosa  
Watch out for la booga rooga  
Some you win and some you loosa  
  
I dont know why and I cant explain  
Why Im lost on a street with no name  
But thats alright thats okay  
I just feel like Im slipping away  
Satellite mama if you are near  
Hey the partys over now just get me outa here  
Silent night watch over me  
See that nobody writes me into the dream  
  
Chorus  
  
Im on fire inside my head  
Someone put out the light  
And they sent the world to bed  
Its not too late but I just cant stop  
I think this time Im going over the top  
Hey Mr Dogface please let me in  
Say dont you think that Im worth rememberin  
Watch your step watch what you do  
Cause you need me much more than I need you  
  
Chorus
