Balagan balagan  
When Im losing patience  
So hard to smile  
Come and sit with me together  
You are the one  
All the weekdays are over  
I worked so hard  
All the weekdays are over  
I feel so down  
What will be tomorrow  
Ahawe ahawe  
Happiness or sorrow  
Ahawe ahawe  
Who will open up my door  
Ahawe ahawe  
Inshallah  
Wish me luck  
Wish me luck  
Ashmaoh mayada beru kol hayom  
Vmilot Vtovi hashalom  
Hasad waamat yarninu levrahum  
Tovu metiv haazinu el hanun  
What will be tomorrow  
Ahawe ahawe  
Happiness or sorrow  
Ahawe ahawe  
Who will open up my door  
Ahawe ahawe  
Inshallah  
Wish me luck  
Wish me luck  
Balagan balagan  
Wish me luck  
Wish me luck  
Inshallah  
Wish me luck
