Sup up your beer and collect your fags  
Theres a row going on down near slough  
Get out your mat and pray to the west  
Ill get out mine and pray for myself  
Thought you were smart when you took them on  
But you didnt take a peep in their artillery room  
All that rugby puts hairs on your chest  
What chance have you got against a tie and a crest  
  
Hellohurrah what a nice day for the Eton rifles  
Hellohurrah I hope rain stops play with the Eton rifles  
  
Thought you were clever when you lit the fuse  
Tore down the house of commons in your brand new shoes  
Compose a revolutionary symphony  
Then went to bed with a charming young thing  
  
Hellohurrah cheers then mate its the Eton rifles  
Hellohurrah an extremist scrape with the Eton rifles  
  
What a catalyst you turned out to be  
Loaded the guns then you run off home for your tea  
Left me standing like a guilty naughty schoolboy  
  
We came out of it naturally the worst  
Beaten and bloody and I was sick down my shirt  
We were no match for their untamed wit  
Though some of the lads said theyll be back next week  
  
Hellohurrah theres a price to pay to the Eton rifles  
Hellohurrah Id prefer the plague to the Eton rifles
