Ever since the day I met you  
I feel like Im walking on air  
And lately Im convinced its no coincidence  
I run into into you everywhere  
  
And though Ive heard your love is taken  
I gotta believe whats in your eyes  
Would I be out of line if I suggested a time  
And we got together one of these nights  
  
Chorus  
Got my heart set on you  
Youre everything Ive ever wanted  
Got my heart set on you  
Cant be anything but love  
Baby Im bettin on it  
  
I dont want to give you the wrong impression  
Im not the kind who rushes in  
But baby every time I see you before I even leave you  
I can hardly wait to see you again  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont mean to be coming on strong  
Or taking everything for granted  
But love is a thing that just comes along  
You dont understand how it got out of hand  
But youre in it right from the start  
  
Chorus
