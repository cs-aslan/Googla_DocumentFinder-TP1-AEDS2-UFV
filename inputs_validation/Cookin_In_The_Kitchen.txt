I met an alien one night while I was walking after dark  
He said dont be afraid Ive come to know Ive come to make my mark  
And theres a road and its very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
He said why are these men and women lying here just on the street  
He said why are these children dying cause they have no food to eat  
And theres a road and its very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
Why are these people hating others for the colour of their skin  
Why are your brother creatures murdered for the flesh that lies within  
Dont lose the rage dont become immune  
When others criticise you  
Dont change your tune  
Youve got to love with a passion that hurts  
Its love that conquers baby  
Its love that serves  
And in the moment before you go to sleep  
You can turn on me Im the blue light wrap me round you  
And when the world turns its coldest shoulder  
In the name of all thats good  
And theres a road and its very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
And Ill be there to dry your tears  
And Ill be cooking in your kitchen  
Food for everyone  
And ill be working in the backroom  
Help for everyone
