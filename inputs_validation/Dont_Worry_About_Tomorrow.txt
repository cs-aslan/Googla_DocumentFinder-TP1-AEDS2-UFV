Dont worry about tomorrow  
That aint gonna help you none  
Dont worry about tomorrow  
That aint gonna help you none  
Youve gotta live and take each day as it comes  
  
It may not be exactly what youre looking for  
It may not be exactly what youre looking for  
But what youre looking for aint gonna come walking  
Through your front hall door oh no  
  
So dont worry about tomorrow  
Gotta live each day as it comes  
Dont worry about tomorrow  
You gotta live each day as it comes  
Its the only way you seem to get things done
