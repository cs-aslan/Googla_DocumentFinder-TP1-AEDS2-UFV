The case was pulled from under the bed  
She made a call to a sympathetic friend  
And made arrangements  
The door was closed there was a note  
I couldnt be bothered maybe Ill choke  
No more engagements  
  
With where have you beens  
And faraway frowns  
Trying to be good  
By not being round  
  
And here in the bar  
The piano mans found  
Another nail for my heart  
And here in the bar  
The piano mans found  
Another nail for my heart  
  
That stupid old bug  
That kills only love  
I want to be good  
Is that not enough  
  
So play me the song  
That makes it so tough  
Another nail for my heart  
Then play me that song  
That makes it so tough  
Another nail for my heart  
  
I had excuses those little boy lies  
That she computed by watching my eyes  
And told me firmly  
She couldnt stand it Im bad on her heart  
She dropped her makeup and I found the bar  
Now it concerns me  
  
Ive had a bad time  
Now love is resigned  
Ive been such a fool  
Ive loved and goodbyed  
  
So here in the bar  
The piano mans found  
Another nail for my heart  
And here in the bar  
The piano mans found  
Another nail for my heart  
And here in the bar  
The piano mans found  
Another nail for my heart  
And here in the bar  
The piano mans found  
Another nail for my heart  
And here in the bar  
The piano mans found  
Another nail for my heart
