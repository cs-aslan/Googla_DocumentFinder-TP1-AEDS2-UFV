Feelings empty feelings  
Prayin hopin needin  
Just when I wanted to hold you  
Youre leavin youre leavin  
leavin youre leavin  
  
I remember those magic nights  
Those nights when it  
All seemed right  
But I knew that by mornin  
Youd be gone  
And though you tell me  
That its not for long  
It aint easy here holdin on  
You gotta tell me where I stand  
  
cause either you dont give a damn  
Or you dont even care to pretend  
Or you wont spare a thought  
Though you know  
It must come to an end  
  
Youd better know that  
Ive made up my mind  
I gotta high of a different kind  
And its gonna take me  
Where I wanna be  
Sure Ill miss ya but I gotta choose  
You cant believe that  
I came here to lose  
And you aint a winner  
Thats easy to see  
  
So Ill see you around or Ill write  
And Ill send you some love  
cause where I wanna go  
There aint nothing to do but move
