Never been to England never been to France  
Never really learned how to dance  
Ive never taken dope and Ive never taken drugs  
Ah Ive never danced on a bearskin rug  
Guess its true what all the people they say  
Im gonna have to loose my hometown ways  
Guess its true guess Ive led a sheltered life  
  
Never went around with anything  
Ive had a hometown life  
And I have never learned to swing  
Not much of a life I havent seen much  
Ive been true to my wife and its just been too much  
Guess its true what all these people they say  
Im gonna have to lose my hometown ways  
You know its true guess Ive led a sheltered life  
  
Guess its true what all these people they say  
Im gonna have to lose my hometown ways  
Guess its true guess Ive led a sheltered life
