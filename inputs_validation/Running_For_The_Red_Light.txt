Madder than a mad man and bored to the core  
Minute hand crawling cant take it any more  
Futures up the highway ya gotta get away  
Gonna take a little trip and find a tijuana stray  
  
Got the time to take it  
Got the balls to break it  
Gotta a car that itll make it  
South of the border  
Dont drink the water  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight  
Crazy from the heat and runnin for the red light  
Oh senorita  
Have two tequila  
Love seeker  
Lord the will is gettin weaker  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight  
Burnin with the fever and runnin for the red light  
She aint a teacher  
She aint a preacher  
Just so close to holy  
That youre runnin just to reach her  
  
Time bomb is tickin my heads about to bust  
Need your personal attention or I swear Im gonna rust  
Find a little place  
No one will tell you what to do  
Tell her Im a rebel  
She says  
Yea without a clue  
  
Just need some understanding  
A girl who aint demanding  
Who aint afraid to fake it  
South of the border  
Dont drink the water  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight  
Crazy from the heat and runnin for the red light  
Oh senorita  
Have two tequila  
Love seeker  
Lord the will is gettin weaker  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight  
Burnin with the fever and runnin for the red light  
She aint a teacher  
She aint a preacher  
Just so close to holy  
That youre runnin just to reach her  
  
Need some understanding  
A girl who aint demanding  
A little bad behavior  
Shes gonna be my saviour  
My knees are shakin  
My back is breakin  
Oh mama mia A senorita  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight  
Crazy from the heat and runnin for the red light  
Oh senorita  
Have three tequila  
Love seeker  
Lord the will is gettin weaker  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight  
Burnin with the fever and runnin for the red light  
She aint a teacher  
She aint a preacher  
Just so close to holy  
That youre runnin just to reach her  
  
Gonna have a good time tonight  
Crazy from the heat and runnin for the red light  
Oh senorita  
Have some tequila  
Need sneakers  
Lord the will is gettin weaker  
Gonna have a good time tonight  
Burnin with the fever and runnin for the red light  
Just heard the bell  
That got me outta hell  
Got a girl  
I gotta life
