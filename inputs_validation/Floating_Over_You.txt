Getting dressed and bunger bound  
Shuffling through the heather  
Neighbors drop their flowers down and worry about the weather  
Every night Im floating over you my love  
Every night I dream Im under you  
All the smiling hands delivering all the   
All of the smiling men with suede hands delivering with those pensions  
Wont you please except our sympathy into three dimensions  
Every night IM floating over you my love  
Every night Im drifting under you  
Dont want to think about my last cigarette  
Dont want to focus on the curve of your thigh  
Dont want to slip off your white silhouette  
I dont think this is a very sensible way to die  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Lonely lonely lonely  
Every night IM floating over you my love  
Every night I dream Im under you  
Well Im alter bound and under dressed  
Just slightly out of order hanging on the fringe of daylights  
Soft and pitchy border  
Every night Im floating over you my love  
Every night Im slipping under you  
Every night Im floating over you my love  
Every night Im dream Im under you  
Lonely lonely ohh IM so lonely
