Seen it all Im already there  
  
Save your books and your pills  
I dont need them Im there  
  
You can do anything you want to  
All youve got to do is try  
  
I thought my best days had left me  
My best years had left me behind  
  
Then I felt them come back to me  
And all the wild eyes  
All the wild eyes know what I mean  
  
If trees cut stars and eyes to heaven  
Ill bend them back and bend them again  
If my skin looks tired and old from living  
Ill turn right back and live it again  
You better pray when the music stops  
And youre left alone in your mind  
Cause Ill be hearing music till the day I die  
  
Then I heard it turn off  
I swear I heard the screams  
And all the wild eyes  
All the wild eyes know what I mean  
Theyre scared theyve lost their dream  
They press down on me  
You know I thought I was there  
  
Hello high are you  
Yes  
Well that explains it  
Oh you were walking round like some kind of angel  
You were walking round like some kind of angel  
Hello high are you Yes  
Well that explains it  
Well that explains it
