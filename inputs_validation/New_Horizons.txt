Well Ive had dreams enough for one  
And Ive got love enough for three  
I have my hopes to comfort me  
I got my new horizons out to sea  
But Im never gonna lose your precious gift  
It will always be that way  
cause I know Im gonna find my own peace of mind  
Someday  
Where is this place that we have found  
Nobody knows where we are bound  
I long to hear I need to see  
cause Ive shed tears too many for me me  
But Im never gonna lose your precious gift  
It will always be that way  
cause I know Im gonna find my own peace of mind  
Someday  
On the wind soaring free  
Spread your wings Im beginning to see  
Out of mind far from view  
Beyond the reach of a nightmare come true  
Well Ive had dreams enough for one  
And I got love enough for three  
I have my hopes to comfort me  
I got my new horizons out to sea  
But Im never gonna lose your precious gift  
It will always be that way  
cause I know Im gonna find my own peace of mind  
Someday someway
