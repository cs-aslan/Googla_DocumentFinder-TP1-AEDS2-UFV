Led by a sacred feeling in my heart  
I have left my evil ways to restart  
Now I heard Eden call  
I must try not to fall  
All is good in heaven  
But I want more  
Am I stripped of evilness to the core  
Now I hear the darkness say  
Rise my son and do your work  
Make them pay  
Even in heaven theres hell  
Even in heaven  
Brought by the holy son  
Welcomed and blessed inside  
Now that the deads begun  
Kneel o me or diehahahaha  
When the war is over  
As its just begun  
When your god has fallen  
And Satans work is done  
I will sit at  
His strong left side  
With my head held high  
And a wreath of pride
