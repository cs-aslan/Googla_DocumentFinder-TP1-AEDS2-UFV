If the night turned cold and the stars looked down  
And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground  
You wake the morning in a strangers coat  
  
No one would you see  
You ask yourself whod watch for me  
My only friend who could it be  
Its hard to say it  
  
I hate to say it but its probably me  
When your bellys empty and the hungers so real  
And youre too proud to beg and too dumb to steal  
You search the city for your only friend  
  
No one would you see  
You ask yourself who could it be  
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free  
  
I hate to say it  
I hate to say it but its probably me  
Youre not the easiest person I ever got to know  
And its hard for us both to let our feelings show  
Some would say I should let you go your way  
  
Youll only make me cry  
If theres one guy just one guy  
Whod lay down his life for you and die  
  
Its hard to say it  
I hate to say it but its probably me  
When the worlds gone crazy and it makes no sense  
Theres only one voice that comes to your defense  
The jurys out and your eyes search the room  
And one friendly face is all you need to see  
If theres one guy just one guy  
Whod lay down his life for you and die  
  
Its hard to say it  
I hate to say it but its probably me  
I hate to say it  
I hate to say it but its probably me
