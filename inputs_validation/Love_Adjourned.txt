Your wifes got beautiful skin  
Shame its not round her body no more  
It just came away in my hands  
As I asked her up to dance  
Just cut her out of your scrapbook  
If she ever made it in  
And if theres any old photos of her  
You know where to find the bin  
  
Cant work it out  
Its what I always say  
Adjourn this love into another day  
If you bite off more than you can chew  
Adjourn this love without a clue  
  
Your wifes got beautiful teeth  
Pity theyre not in the mouth no more  
They just seem to crumble and fall  
As I pinned her to the wall  
Just rub her out of your diary  
Scratch her name off your list  
And if you want to see her smiling  
Take a good look at this fist  
  
Cant work it out  
Its what I always say  
Adjourn this love into another day  
If you bite off more than you can chew  
Adjourn this love without a clue  
  
You took this boy  
And you showed him insanity  
You said he must abide  
He showed you beauty  
And you showed him vanity  
Cant say that I cried  
  
Cant work it out  
Its what I always say  
Adjourn this love into another day  
If you bite off more than you can chew  
Adjourn this love without a clue
