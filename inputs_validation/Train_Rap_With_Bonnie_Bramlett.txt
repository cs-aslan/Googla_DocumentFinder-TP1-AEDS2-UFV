Women to be ina the music business give up more than youd ever know Shes
got kids she gave up Any woman gives up home life an old man probably
because youre so crazy on planes and run  
And you never find em egain You give up you give up a home and friends you
give up children and friends you give up the old man and friends you give up
every constant in the world except m  
Thats the only thing youve got man when you boil it down the only thing
you got left in the world is that music man And so for a woman to sing she
really needs to or wants to A man ca  
It as a gig cause he knows he cn get laid tonight
