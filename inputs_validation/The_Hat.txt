I knitted you a hat all blue and gold  
To keep your ears warm from the Binghamton cold  
It was my first one and it was too small  
It didnt fit you at all but you wore it just the same  
  
I remember the first time we danced  
I remember tunneling through the snow like ants  
What I dont recall is why I said  
I simply cant sleep in this tiny bed with you anymore  
  
I should tell you that you were my first love  
  
So its Christmas time its been three years  
And someone else is knitting things for your ears  
  
I have come to learn Ill only see you interrupting my dreams at night  
And thats alright And thats alright And thats alright And thats
alright  
  
I should tell you that you were my first love  
  
And its alright And its alright And its alright  
  
And its alright We were seventeen again together  
And its alright We were seventeen again together  
And its alright We were seventeen again together  
  
I should tell you that you were my first love  
I should tell you that you were my first love  
  
We were seventeen again  
We were seventeen again  
We were seventeen again
