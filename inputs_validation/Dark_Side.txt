Theres a place that I know  
Its not pretty there and few have ever gone  
If I show it to you now  
Will it make you run away  
  
Or will you stay  
Even if it hurts  
Even if I try to push you out  
Will you return  
And remind me who I really am  
Please remind me who I really am  
  
Everybodys got a dark side  
Do you love me  
Can you love mine  
Nobodys a picture perfect  
But were worth it  
You know that were worth it  
Will you love me  
Even with my dark side  
  
Like a diamond  
From black dust  
Its hard to know  
It can become  
If you give up  
So dont give up on me  
Please remind me who I really am  
  
Everybodys got a dark side  
Do you love me  
Can you love mine  
Nobodys a picture perfect  
But were worth it  
You know that were worth it  
Will you love me  
Even with my dark side  
  
Dont run away  
Dont run away  
Just tell me that you will stay  
Promise me you will stay  
Dont run away  
Dont run away  
Just promise me you will stay  
Promise me you will stay  
  
Will you love me Ohh  
Everybodys got a dark side  
Do you love me  
Can you love mine  
Nobodys a picture perfect  
But were worth it  
You know that were worth it  
Will you love me  
Even with my dark side
