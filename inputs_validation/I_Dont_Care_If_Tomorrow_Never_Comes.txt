I dont care if tomorrow never comes  
This world holds nothing for me  
Ive been lonely night and day ever since you went away  
So I dont care if tomorrow never comes  
  
If tomorrow never comes and the sun dont ever shine  
It wont matter with me  
For when she left away my world ended that day  
So I dont care if tomorrow never comes  
  
My lonely mind goes back to days that used to be  
My broken heart cries out for you  
Oh if I cant have you here I cant go on my dear  
So I dont care if tomorrow never comes  
  
If tomorrow never comes  
George when she left away poor Hank my world ended that day  
I dont care if tomorrow never comes
