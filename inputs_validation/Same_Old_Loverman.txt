Im not some long lost someone  
Just dropped in to say hello  
Its that same old lover man  
Baby you lost so long ago  
Cause I was born to believe  
I never could deceive believe me  
I hear no childrens voices  
Have they gone back to school  
And that same old lover man  
Is still acting like a fool  
I guess I was born to bring you grief  
Though I never was a thief believe me  
Its cold outside your window  
Please let me in the night is wild  
Its that same old lover man  
Not some lonesome winsome child  
An I was born to believe  
I never could deceive
