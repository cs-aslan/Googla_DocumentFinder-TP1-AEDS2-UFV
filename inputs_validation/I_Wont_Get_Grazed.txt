Im going away to see my own  
And tread my earth  
Ive got no ordinary gain  
By to set my worth  
I get enough and I get too late  
And if I fall down on the road  
Then I wont get grazed  
  
I cannot let you take my time  
Or till my earth  
Youve had enough of life to see  
That it shakes my nerve  
All of these things I cant get straight  
And if Im falling to the road  
Then I wont get grazed  
  
Ive had two of them or three  
And I just get hurt  
I watch me crawling down the road  
Trying to guess my worth  
I know not what Im trying to say  
But if Im falling on this road  
Then I wont get grazed  
  
I watch you running down the road  
So I get mine worked out  
But you watch me falling on the run  
And you have me called out  
All of these things they get so strange  
Just kill me falling on the road  
But I wont get grazed x4
