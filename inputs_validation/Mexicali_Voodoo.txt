You take the train from Yuma  
Down to Mexicali  
And by the crack of midnight  
Youve got that border town fever  
  
Well down in Madam Woos cafe  
In back of She Cat Alley  
Madam Woos mix some Mexicali voodoo  
  
Mexicali Bella  
Bella voodoo  
Americano dont you know what he do  
  
Three days later  
In an elevator  
Three days later Mexicali Bella  
Bella voodoo  
Americano dont know what he do
