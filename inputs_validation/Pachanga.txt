Yo everything aint love love cause if it is  
My definition of love must differ his  
I mean every friendship has its differences  
But these Young Bucks remind me of Fif and his  
They hear the good life wanna see what the difference is  
Some just wanna smoke enjoy the piffvileges  
He unwrap a cigar like its a gift of his  
He a funny lil nigga like Eddie Griffin is  
Between smokin and chokin then you got to live  
So I gave him a chance and thats a lot to give  
We posed to make the most of what you was paid to gross  
I gave you bread and butter you supposed to make the toast  
Fifteen years fifteen years  
And now when we say whats up the shit seem weird  
But theres a question I prepared for you  
How could you fuck the only people who ever cared for you

Theres a parallel path tween friends and enemies  
And whenever you cross it you make friendemies  
Theres no remedies for these sick memories  
My doctor said theres no cure for the Emmales  
Had a crush on you now we Kim and Cease  
We dont even talk no more its no biggie  
I was so Biggie you was Faith  
I let you slide in my home you was safe  
I thought my ability to provide you stability  
Was what was really G okay silly me  
I was Billy D smooth cappa really street  
Really she attract niggaz like the a Milli beat  
And I happen to rap but somethin bout this beat strange  
Soon as I try to flow with it the beat change

But what you thinks a upgrade really just could be a seat change

Just niggas with chains on tryna be SF Street Fam  
Thats when your ace become ya BFF  
PaPaPaPachange ya like they was a PF chef  
DaDaDaDanger it just feels Mystikal  
I miss the cool nights sittin in the CollO  
Now its like boo we sittin in Apollo  
It used to be all good then shit just went mile low  
And thats bad matter fact thats sad  
Cause when you lose a friend its hard to handle the loss  
They do some bitch shit gotta give ya man a divorce  
End up watchin Friends like Joey Chandler and Ross ya see  
Most of these niggas aint never love em  
And these bitches just think whatever of em  
So maybe playin dumb was kinda clever of em  
And less friends are your best friends become strangers
