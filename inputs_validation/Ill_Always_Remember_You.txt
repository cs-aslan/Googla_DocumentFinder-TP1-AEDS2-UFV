It all started back in 1981  
Our life together had just begun  
I didnt know what my future would hold  
But you gave me a chance  
So I set out on the road  
  
It wasnt easy going then  
There were times I almost threw that old towel in  
But you kept callin me back to the stage  
And I finally found my place in each and every face  
  
Im not sayin Im through by any means  
Theres still things that I want to say and do  
I hope you wont forget me cause weve shared a lot dreams  
And just know that Ill always remember you  
  
When I first set out on the road I figured  
I had maybe five good years to sing my songs for you folks  
Well its goin on thirty now  
And I still love it just as much as I ever did  
When I hear that announcer say my name  
And I walk through those curtains  
And see your smilin faces  
My feet dont touch the ground again  
Til I walk out and get back on that bus that got me here  
I dont know how many more years Ive got left to do this  
But I figure a few  
I do want you to know though  
That when I do walk off this stage for the last time  
And Im all settled in away from all this  
You wont be far away  
Ill still hear your screams and cheers in my mind  
And Ill always remember you  
  
Im not sayin Im through by any means  
Cause theres still things that I want to say and do  
I hope you wont forget me cause weve shared a lot dreams  
And just know that Ill always remember you  
  
Youve pulled me through some hard times  
Hope Ive pulled you through a few  
And just know that Ill always remember you
