I never tried to change you  
But the hurt is changing me  
I only want to be myself  
And you wont let that be  
I cant play an actors role  
Cause I cant live a lie  
Lifes too short and nights too long  
To let them pass us by  
So Ill be closing the door in the morning  
And I wont wake you when I rise  
Cause theres nothing to say before going  
You think that I said it all  
So I think Ill say goodbye  
Believin came so easy when our love was flowin free  
But theres a wall of darkness where sunshine used to be  
One more wrong tomorrow  
Is one more wasted day  
And holdin on to love thats gone  
Well never find our way  
So Ill be closing the door in the morning  
And I wont wake you when I rise  
Cause theres nothing to say before going  
You think that I said it all  
So I think Ill say goodbye
