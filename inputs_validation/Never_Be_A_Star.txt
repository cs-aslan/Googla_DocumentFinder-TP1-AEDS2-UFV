No matter how big we are  
We dream of home  
The place where we all belong  
Therefore this sing  
  
We are who we are  
Well never be a star  
We are where we are  
But well never be a star  
  
No time to see all our friends  
There where we are  
Ten thousand miles are quite long  
And much too far  
  
We are who we are  
Well never be a star  
We are where we are  
But well never be a star
