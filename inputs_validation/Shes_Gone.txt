A blackened wick is what remains  
The flame was blown out just recently  
Although the candle hadnt burned down to the stick  
It wont be lit again the day wont be so bright  
  
We dont know what she may have been  
All we know is what she left behind  
An apartment cluttered with childrens toys  
Photos of good times  
  
In the bedroom theres sheets on the windows  
Theres a four poster bed for a reason  
Theres a box on the floor full of secrets  
It wont be opened  
  
Here older boys and girls would play  
All inhibitions were left behind  
As the door would close her face begin to shine  
This was her finest hour this was her finest time  
  
Now shes gone and its not gonna be alright not for me  
  
Shes gone but not forgotten shes still here  
In all those years she touched so many lives  
Whos gonna watch the little girl she left behind  
  
Carol Anne stands alone in the school yard  
All the other children have gone  
After waiting for hours  
She cant understand why her mother left her  
  
In the darkness she sees definition  
In the silence she hears someone calling  
After nightmares she lies in bed screaming  
But theres no one listening theres no one  
Now shes gone and its never gonna be alright not for me shes gone
