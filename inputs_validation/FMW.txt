Usher  
Whats so complicated  
Everythings so simple when you say it  
No one said the shit was easy  
No one said Id take you out in the city  
Forgive me forgive  
But fuck with me fuck with fuck with me now  
  
Imma be real with you now I dont know why I called her  
When you called me I was wrong so thats why I bought ya  
Couple things for your wrist thats shining in the dark  
Hope youd forgive me thats why I bought it Yeah  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
Cant you see that Im trying  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
  
Baby I can change can you stick around yeah  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
Its easy when Im up can you hold me down  
  
Tell me what nigga is perfect  
Tell me what nigga is right  
Tell me what nigga has been with the same bitch  
And she holding it down for life  
Tell me who get it right on the first try  
I know I did wrong but what nigga is trying harder
