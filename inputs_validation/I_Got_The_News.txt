You  
In your lark  
Youre a mark  
Youre a screamer  
You know  
How to hustle  
Daddy  
Is a rare  
Millionaire  
I dont care  
Yeah you  
Got the muscle  
I got the news  
  
Yes dear  
How did you know  
Cant you see our love will grow  
  
Take it  
In your hand  
All the sirens  
And the band  
Get to bendin my ear  
How  
Was I to know  
About the warm  
Soulful secret  
You been keepin for years  
I got the news  
  
Slow down Ill tell you when  
I may never walk again  
  
Broadway Duchess  
Darling if you only knew  
Half as much as  
Everybody thinks you do  
What I hear  
May be true  
I would still be proud  
To know you  
  
Spanish kissin  
See it glisten  
You came ragin  
Love rampagin  
I got the news  
  
Yes dear  
How did you know  
Cant you see our love will grow
