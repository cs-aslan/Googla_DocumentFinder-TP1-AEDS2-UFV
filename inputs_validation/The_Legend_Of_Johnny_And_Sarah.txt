Johnny  
Was just a kid I knew  
And maybe  
He didnt have a clue  
But hes gone  
You know its just a shame  
And shes the one to blame  
  
Sarah  
Not just the girl next door  
Shes well known  
I dont go there no more  
But johnny  
Johnny found out to late  
And now shes the one to blame  
Yeah hes gone just as quick as he came  
  
Well now something  
Had gotten into him  
He shouldnt have been  
Where the whole town had been  
On Sarah  
She was his only one  
Poor johnny shes everyones to  
  
And sometimes  
Ill see her round town  
She never grows old  
She still gets around  
And I know  
I know her intent  
And Sarah will ride again  
Oh yeah shes gonna ride till the end
