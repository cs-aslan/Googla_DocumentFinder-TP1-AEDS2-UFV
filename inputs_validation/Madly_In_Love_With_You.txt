Madly In Love With You  
  
See you down there everyday  
Trying to find a different way  
To build some kind of latter to the sky  
  
Trying to find some way to see  
Secrets of eternity and they dont come all at once  
And you dont know why  
  
Well how do you think it feels to hear you screaming out my name  
While all the while Im trying to open up your heart  
See you when you cry yourself to sleep  
Its tearing me apart  
  
I know you wish you could see me  
Thats the way it has to be  
Someday youll understand  
Dont you lose your faith in me  
  
I know you wish you could hear me  
Sometimes its so hard to do  
But every morning sunrise it says  
Im madly in love with you  
Yes Im madly in love with you  
Yes Im madly in love with you  
Yes Im madly in love with you  
  
I know that youre waiting for  
A chance to come in from the war  
If only a moment if only a day  
  
A place where you feel safe and warm  
A sanctuary from the storm  
Until all of these questions fade away  
  
But I cannot count on all the signs  
Youve passed away as mere coincidence  
And Im running out of ways to break through  
Like a lonely lover Waiting by the ocean  
Ill never give up on you  
  
I know you wish you could see me  
Thats the way it has to be  
Someday youll understand  
Dont you lose your faith in me  
  
I know you wish you could hear me  
Sometimes its so hard to do  
But every morning sunrise it says  
Im madly in love with you  
Yes Im madly in love with you  
Yes Im madly in love with you  
Yes Im madly in love with you
