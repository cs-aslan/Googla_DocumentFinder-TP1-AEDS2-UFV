Chorus  
Somebody remind me where I am  
Thats right Im at home Yeah Im right where I belong  
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too  
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong  
I know they aint getting money like we do  
So its on I was looking for the one  
Now Im feeling dumb for thinking it was you  
I was wrong now Im back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
And Imma do it all  
Feeling like the old me  
You dont even know me  
Imma do it all  
Imma do it all  
Probably why Im back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
  
Drake  Verse 1  
Tonight Im into breaking up  
Somebodys home  
Im drunk as ever  
Im not alone Im with my people  
I know you love it  
I dont jus do it  
I over does it  
I be getting money so long  
Its just paper to me  
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me  
You can never reminisce when you forget it all  
Careful what you wish for you just might get it all  
Now my life is angel hair and pignot grigio  
Baby forget about it  
Im headed wherever this muthfcking jet is routed  
You cant have my heart the doctor told me Id be dead without it  
My judgements never clouded  
Thats why Im steady yelling weatherman weatherman  
Im bout whatever man  
Im tryna fuck with tinkerbell in never neverland  
But Im polite about it  
Baby after you  
Ive had a glass or two so somebody remind me where I am  
  
Chorus  
thats right Im at home Yeah Im right where I belong  
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too  
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong  
I know they aint getting money like we do  
So its on I was looking for the one  
Now Im feeling dumb for thinking it was you  
I was wrong now Im back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
And Imma do it all  
Feeling like the old me  
You dont even know me  
Imma do it all  
Imma do it all  
Probably why Im back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
  
Drake  Verse 2  
Tryna get the green like Im waiting at a long light  
Broke just doesnt suit me girl and every night is prom night  
Whered I put my bow tie  
Millionnaire multi  
Rest in peace to B I G and praises to the most high  
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions  
Im the man now I guess that parts a given  
Someone please tell me the problem with my competition  
I ask whats up and they just always say the cost of livin  
I live from it though Ive been down and I got up  
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up  
And me falling and landing in love I dont think should happen  
Because everythings easier to get into than get out of  
But someone show me to the owner of this city  
Cause the owners always seem to be the only people with me  
Im still the mafia still run the commitee  
Ny forever nigga Diddy  
  
Chorus  
Somebody remind me where I am  
Thats right Im at home Yeah Im right where I belong  
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too  
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong  
I know they aint getting money like we do  
So its on I was looking for the one  
Now Im feeling dumb for thinking it was you  
I was wrong now Im back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it  
And Imma do it all  
Feeling like the old me  
You dont even know me  
Imma do it all  
Imma do it all  
Probably why Im back up in this bitch going harder than I did  
Watch me do it
