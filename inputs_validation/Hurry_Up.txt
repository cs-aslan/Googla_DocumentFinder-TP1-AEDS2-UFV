Hurry up before I get another date  
Hurry up well its gettin awful late  
Well I told you when I walked you home  
And I told you on the telephone  
That Id be here at a quarter to nine  
Oh little girl aint you ever on time  
Nothin bugs me baby like ahavin to wait  
But it always seems to happen everytime we have a date  
Hurry up well cmon lets go  
Hurry up well be late for the show  
Hurry up oh yeah hurry up  
  
We got to the movie baby wouldnt you know  
The only seats I saw were in the very last row  
I there sat down and I tried to watch the show  
When you look at your watch you say c mon lets go
