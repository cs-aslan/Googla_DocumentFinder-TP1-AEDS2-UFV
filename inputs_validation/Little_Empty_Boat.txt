You found me at some party  
You thought Id understand  
You barreled over to me  
With a drink in each hand  
I respect your beliefs girl  
And I consider you a friend  
But Ive already been born once  
I dont want to be born again  
Your knowledge is impressive  
And your argument is good  
But I am the resurrection babe  
And your standin on my foot  
  
Chorus  
But my little boat is empty  
It dont go  
And my oar is broken  
It dont row row row  
My little boat is empty  
It dont go  
And my oar is broken  
It dont row row row  
  
Your tiny little face  
Keeps yappin in the gloom  
Seven steps behind me  
With your dustpan and broom  
I cant help but imagine you  
All postured and prone  
But theres a little guy on my shoulder  
Says I should go home alone  
But you keep leaning in on me  
And youre lookin pretty pissed  
That grave youve dug between  
Your legs is hard to resist  
  
Chorus  
  
Give to God what belongs to God  
And give the rest to me  
Tell our gracious host to fuck himself  
Its time for us to leave  
  
Chorus
