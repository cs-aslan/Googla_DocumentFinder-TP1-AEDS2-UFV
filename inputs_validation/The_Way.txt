Well the sun dont shine where it used to  
And the angels are hidin their heads  
People dont listen to their hearts anymore  
Seems the good men all are dead  
There aint no right wrong no in between  
That aint the constitution that they wrote for me  
Got our heads stuck in somethin overseas  
Standin ass deep in hypocrisy  
  
Oh  
Well I found myself out on the open road  
Heading out into the desert  
Lookin for another world thats waitin on me  
That none of us can see  
I keep thinkin to myself as I move along  
Where do we all come from  
Is there religion or another dimension  
Another place and time yeah  
  
Oh  
When my life is over and done  
Finally made my way through it  
Another life has just begun  
Is this the way you do it  
Oh the way  
  
Oh  
Lookin in the eyes of the man on the moon  
Hes starin down at me  
Wondering what hes thinkin and if he knows  
Please let me see  
  
Life is like an open door were all walkin through  
Do you know the answers no one knows the truth  
Until we pass on through  
  
When my life is over and done  
Finally made my way through it  
Another life has just begun  
Is this the way to it  
  
Oh  
Walkin on the world upside down  
It keeps spinnin round and round  
World upside down  
Im so tired of all this bullshit goin down  
Finally made my way through it  
When my life is over and done  
Is this the way you do it  
When my life is over and done  
Finally made my way through it  
Another life has just begun  
This is the way you do it  
Oh the way  
This is the way you do it  
Oh the way
