Its like a holocaust to the boss when I toss  
Too much knowledge kicked then youre lost  
In a shuffle of feet Jinx the fiddler  
And I control your mind like Hitler  
You bow and vow to authority  
See now a sucker with a style just boring me  
So I show KNOW  
LEDGE it might trouble you  
Then I transform like a Deception  
With a mic as a bomb  
In my right palm  
But I dont stay calm  
So panic  
Others cant flow so they go schizophrenic  
You thought I dropped a dud in your face  
Until you taste the blood of the bass  
Then you faint or better yet pass out  
When Im on the mic believe its ass out  
You think youre raw so you draw  
You lose youre hung you bite your tongue  
The whole town saw in awe as you strangle  
A noose on your neck and you dangle  
From side to side in the blazing heat  
Youre beat youre dead the fools fell off  
You feel youre turning red its said  
That your head burst  
And this is only the first verse  
Of the bomb  
  
Dont break up the fight let them rumble  
Over the years Ive watched some go superbad quick  
Now the smell of the pen has got them sick to the stomach  
Now ask yourself whos stupid  
I take funky funky beats and I loop it  
And pimp slap you in the face with the bass  
And the boom from the bomb that I drop  
Stop  
You have a flat top as a fashion  
I love Black women with a passion  
But when they gotta go and show their ass in  
I gotta clown the hoes yeah  
You gotta watch the ones with the big derrieres  
Theyll steer you wrong  
Ice Cubes got it going on hit me  
For the gangster boogie two times for the gangster rhyme  
The system aint wholesome  
They want to put a young brother in Folsom  
And others see me on lockdown  
But I come up foul then they get knocked out word  
To the brother that rolls the herb  
Everybody getting knocked to the curb like that  
Jinx got the gat and its a fact  
Hell kick a funky beat to peel your cap  
Now whos the mack  
Whos the hoe  
Whos the trick  
I got many many styles wont you take a pick  
But dont be alarmed  
When I trip and stumble and fumble  
And drop the rewind  
Drop the bomb  
  
Im solo you ask how Im living  
Still dropping more shit than a pigeon  
With the L the E the N the see the H  
The M the O the be  the great  
Lyrics that make the beat swing and I gotcha  
Its the hiphopper that dont like coppers  
And if you try to upset the pot son  
You get kicked in the chest like a shotgun  
I make the beats I make the breaks  
I make the rhymes that make you shake  
Make you find  
Ice Cube never caught in the middle  
I make shit to kick you in the ass a little  
And still never hesitate to stutter step  
Or bust a repetition on the mic  
Still dissing all the hype  
From left to right  
How many left to fight  
So what that Lench Mob like
