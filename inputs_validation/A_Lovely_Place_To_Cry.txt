I know this house is the finest one around  
And we are both respected in our town  
But our friends dont know the truth when they drop by  
That our house is such a lovely place to cry  
  
I keep my yard cut as close as it can be  
Theres no litter laying round for one to see  
And I know someday Ill tell this place goodbye  
But till then its sure a lovely place to cry  
  
You dont need lonely things around you  
When you have no love left in you  
And when youre already dead before you die  
But someday someone will buy this place and be happy if theyll try  
  
But for us its been a lovely place to cry  
Yes for us its been a lovely place to cry
