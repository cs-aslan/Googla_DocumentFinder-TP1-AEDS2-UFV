Spent fortyeight dollars last night at the county fair  
I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear  
Shes got me saying sugarpie honey darlin and dear  
I aint seen the Braves play a game all year  
Im gonna get fired if I dont get some sleep  
My long lost buddies say Im gettin in to deep  
  
But I like it I love it I want some more of it  
I try so hard I cant rise above it  
Dont know what it is bout that little gals lovin  
But I like it I love it I want some more of it  
  
My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy  
But it never sank in til that girl got a hold of me  
Now Im holding umbrellas and openin up doors  
Im taking out the trash and Im sweepin my floors  
Crossin my fingers and countin every kiss  
Prayin that it keeps goin on like this  
  
But I like it I love it I want some more of it  
I try so hard I cant rise above it  
Dont know what it is bout that little gals lovin  
But I like it I love it I want some more of it  
  
Got to wash my truck and dress up  
To pick her up to watch TV  
And she sits down on the sofa  
Shell move a little closer  
She cant get enough of me  
  
But I like it I love it I want some more of it  
I try so hard I cant rise above it  
Dont know what it is bout that little gals lovin  
But I like it I love it I want some more of it
