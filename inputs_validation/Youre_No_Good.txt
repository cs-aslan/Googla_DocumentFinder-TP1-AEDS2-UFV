Feelin better now that were through  
Feelin better cause Im over you  
I learned my lesson it left a scar  
Now I see how you really are  
  
Chorus  
Youre no good youre no good  
Youre no good baby youre no good  
Im gonna say it again  
Youre no good youre no good  
Youre no good baby youre no good  
  
I broke her heart its gentle and true  
Yes I broke her heart over someone like you  
Ill beg his forgiveness on bended knee  
I wouldnt blame him if he says to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Forget me its over  
  
Youre no good youre no good  
Youre no good baby youre no good  
  
Baby oh baby youre no good  
Youre no good youre no good  
  
Choruse  
  
Im tellin you now baby  
That Im going my way  
Forget about you baby  
Im on my way
