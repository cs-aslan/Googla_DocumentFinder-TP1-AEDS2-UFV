I would do anything I could to be near you  
Walk all night in the pouring rain  
To be at your side  
My heart is aching for love  
My bodys shaking with desire  
Believe me baby when I say  
I will drink you dry  
  
I would do anything to be near you  
Youre everything any man could claim  
I see your face in the night  
I hear you calling my name  
  
But its a long long way from home  
Im just trying to get a message to you  
Its a long long way from home  
An I dont know what Im gonna do  
  
Id been looking for love for so long when I found you  
Too many years I walked alone  
When I touch you inside I feel you burning me with fire  
Believe me baby when I say  
I will feed the flame  
  
I would do anything to be near you  
Walk all night in the pouring rain  
I see your face in the night  
I hear you calling my name  
  
But its a long long way from home  
Im just trying to get a message to you  
Its a long long way from home  
An I dont know what Im gonna do  
  
I would do anything to be near you  
Youre everything any man could claim  
I see your face in the night  
I hear you calling my name  
  
But its a long long way from home  
Im just trying to get a message to you  
Its a long long way from home  
An I dont know what Im gonna do  
  
I would do anything I could to be near you  
Check in on any night time flight I dont mind  
My heart is aching for love  
My bodys shaking with desire  
Believe me baby when I say  
I will drink you dry  
  
I would do anything to be near you  
Walk all night in the pouring rain  
I see your face in the night  
I hear you calling my name  
  
But its a long long way from home  
Im just trying to get a message to you  
Its a long long way from home  
An I dont know what Im gonna do  
  
Its a long long way from home  
Im just trying to get a message to you  
Its a long long way from home  
An I dont know what Im gonna do  
Its a long long way from home
