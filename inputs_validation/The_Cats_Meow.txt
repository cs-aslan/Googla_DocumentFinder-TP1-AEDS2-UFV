Whats Wrong Wofie are ya sick  
Something in your Throat  
Wait A Minute are you trying to meow  
Ah Fella  
I can see it when youre feeling low  
You cant hide that from me  
Youre no status quo calico  
So why keep trying to be  
Cause youre more than that  
Youre my doggish cat  
I wish you could see the you I see  
I say  
If you bark  
Celebrate it  
Make your mark  
Serenade it  
Noahs ark  
Shoulda had a cat like you  
And if  
What you are  
Is a strange you  
Doesnt mean  
You should change you  
Only means  
You should change your point of view  
  
Hey feline  
You fetch just fine  
To thine ownself be true  
Your bow wows  
The cats meow  
Its how I know youre you  
  
You dont need the bows  
Or tiara  
Bid your woes  
Sayonara  
Trust your nose  
Cause it knows the way to go  
When you  
Chase your tail  
Youre enchanting  
Spirits sail  
When youre panting  
When you wail  
Youre a rover Romeo  
  
There is not  
One hair of you  
That I would rearrange  
I love you the way you are  
And that will never change  
That will never change
