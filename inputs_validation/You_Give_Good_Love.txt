I found out what Ive been missing  
Always on the run  
Ive been looking for someone  
  
Now youre here like youve been before  
And you know just what I need  
It took some time for me to see  
  
That you give good love to me baby  
So good take this heart of mine into your hands  
You give good love to me  
Never too much  
Baby you give good love  
  
Never stopping I was always searching  
For that perfect love  
The kind that girls like me dream of  
  
Now youre here like youve been before  
And you know just what I need  
It took some time for me to see  
  
That you give good love to me baby  
So good take this heart of mine into your hands  
You give good love to me  
Never too much  
Baby you give good love  
  
Now Ive stopped looking around  
Each night what this lifes all about  
Our love is here to stay to stay  
Baby you give good love  
  
So good  
Take this heart of mine  
Into your hands  
You give good love to me  
Never too much  
No no no no no  
You give good love to me  
So good so good  
  
You give me good love  
Good love good love

You know what I need
