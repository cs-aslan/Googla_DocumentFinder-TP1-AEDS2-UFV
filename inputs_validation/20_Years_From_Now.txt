Jan is tired of her inhaler  
When she moved here from back east  
Still she said shed stay beside me  
And she brought me a new peace  
I saw her smilin in the summer sun  
I saw her neath the quiet moon  
I knew right then Id never leave her  
She had taken me so soon  
When she went  
She went  
And we settled near the blue lagoon  
Listened all night to the wind  
Sometimes we laughed sometimes we cried  
Sometimes we just went for a swim  
All that time my love kept growing growing growing  
Made me feel so warm inside  
All the time her smile glowing  
And it gave me so much pride  
When she went yeah when she went  
Yeah now we sit here in the evening  
And listen to the crickets sing  
And well be here twenty years from now  
And well hear the crickets sing  
And then shell go oh oh oh oh  
Shell go
