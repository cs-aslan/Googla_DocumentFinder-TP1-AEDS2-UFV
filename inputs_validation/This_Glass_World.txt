In this glass world we stop feeling pain  
Going nowhere weve got everything  
In this glass world  
People who live below wish they were here just looking in  
  
In this glass world  
In this glass world  
In this glass world  
  
In this glass world we bathe by starlight  
No troubles here thats on the outside  
In this glass world sittin without a cake  
No need to move its way too nice up here  
  
In this glass world  
In this glass world  
In this glass world
