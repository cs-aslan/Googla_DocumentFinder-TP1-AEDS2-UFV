One look in your innocent eyes  
And I knew you had to be the one  
You walked out of all of my dreams  
Never thought the day would really come  
  
Ive been standing in a long desperate line  
Waiting for somebody like you  
I may only be wasting my time  
Dont know what else to do  
  
If you turn me away  
Just be careful what you say  
Girl youve got my heart on the line  
Dont be mean dont be cruel  
Dont you treat me like a fool  
Girl youve got my heart on the line  
  
Its too late to be wishing I was  
In somebody elses shoes this time  
Im tied up like a slave to a chain  
Praying that youll please be kind  
  
If its true that loves a disease  
Baby Im a dangerous case  
I beg for mercy got me down on my knees  
Youve got a smile on your face  
  
If you turn me away  
Just be careful what you say  
Girl youve got my heart on the line  
Dont be mean dont be cruel  
Dont you treat me like a fool  
Girl youve got my heart on the line  
  
I dont want to stay  
In my own little world  
So if you want to play  
Wont you show me little girl  
  
If you turn me away  
Just be careful what you say  
Girl youve got my heart on the line  
Dont be mean dont be cruel  
Dont you treat me like a fool  
Girl youve got my heart on the line
