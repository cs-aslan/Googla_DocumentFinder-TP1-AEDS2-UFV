You know you light my candle  
You knew you load my gun  
Youre way too hot to handle  
Theres nothing we aint done  
  
Give me your love  
Give me that hot persuasion  
I cant get enough  
Give me that hot persuasion  
Give it to me  
  
Mouth full of hot persuasion  
You face me upside down  
A love for all occasions  
You wont catch me foolin around  
  
Give me your love  
Give me that hot persuasion  
I cant cant get enough  
Give me that hot persuasion  
  
Oh I need to know youre near me  
I need you by my side  
You keep my tank on empty  
You keep me up all night  
  
Give me your love  
Give me that hot persuasion  
Oh no cant get enough  
Give me that hot persuasion  
  
Give me your hot persuasion  
I cant get enough get enough  
Ive done hot persuasion
