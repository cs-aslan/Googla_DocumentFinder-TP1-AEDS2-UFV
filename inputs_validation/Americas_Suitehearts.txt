You could have knocked me out with a  
Feather  
I know youve heard this all before but were just Hells  
Neighbors  
Whywhywhy wont the world revolve around me  
Build my dreams  
Trees grow all over the streets  
  
But I dont know much about classic cars  
But I got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke  
Down set one hut hut hike  
Media blitz  
  
Chorus  
Lets hear it for Americas suitehearts  
But I must confess  
Im in love with my own sins  
Lets hear it for Americas suitehearts  
But I must confess  
Im in love with my own sins  
  
You can bow and pretend  
That you dont dont know youre a legend oh  
Time time time hasnt told  
Anyone else yeah  
Let my love loose again  
  
But I dont know much about classic cars  
But I got a lot of friends stuck classic coke  
Down set one hut hut hike  
Media blitz  
  
Chorus  
  
You could have knocked me out with a feather  
I know you heard this all before  
  
Chorus  
  
Suitehearts suitehearts suitehearts suitehearts
