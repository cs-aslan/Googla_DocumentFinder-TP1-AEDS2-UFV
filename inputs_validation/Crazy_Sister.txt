Driving me home in your car watching you drive  
Through obstacles and icicles keeping my mind on its lead  
Keeping it warm with chemicals and therapy  
Turn it on take me over crazy sister  
Digging a hole in your heart  
Watching you breathe punishment and oxygen  
Letting my mind off its lead  
I watched it disappear to somewhere dark and reassuring  
Turn it on can you believe it  
Take me over its psychomazingly true  
Turn it on crazy sister  
And when I feel it its psychomazing its you  
Staying at home Plugging it in  
Kissing the screen being a god  
Staying at home screwing it in  
Fucking the screen being a god  
Turn it on can you feel it  
Crazy sister  
Turn it on can you believe it  
Crazy sister  
Turn it on take me over  
Crazy sister  
Crazy sister
