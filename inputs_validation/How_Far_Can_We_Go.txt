Oh how far can we go you and me doin this  
Were doin the things that only sinners do but I cant keep my mind off of
you  
We made a mistake one night and didnt quit  
So how far can we go you and me doin this  
Were strangers by day and lovers by night  
And I feel like a thief when I hold you tight  
The ring on my finger shows that Im still his  
So how far can we go you and me doin this  
Lovin like theres no tomorrow or past were takin the backroad go and go
out fast  
The ring on my finger shows that Im still his  
So how far can we go you and me doin this  
So how far can we go you and me me and you everyday all the time doin this
