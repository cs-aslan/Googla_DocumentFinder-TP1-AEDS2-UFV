Seems like its rainin harder today  
The rain must of known I was comin this way  
It aint easy living on the run  
If I pick up my step and pull my belt down tight  
I can make it to the border by Saturday night  
And its lonely living on the run  
I killed me a woman in Tennessee  
I just broke jail and theyre gunnin for me  
Im on the run living on the run  
Im on the run living on the run  
  
My woman wanted more than a man could steal  
From the bottom of the decks  
Where I learned to deal  
And it got me me living on the run  
Women love an outlaw I heard folks say  
And Ill be an outlaw till my dying day  
Cause it got me living on the run  
I killed me a woman in Tennessee  
I just broke jail and theyre gunnin for me  
Im on the run living on the run  
Im on the run living on the run
