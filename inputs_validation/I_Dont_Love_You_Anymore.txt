Ive been thinking  
It seems were going nowhere  
You dont share my feelings  
It doesnt seem fair  
I guess theres nothing  
Much more I can do  
I know Ive got to try  
And make it without you  
  
I dont love you anymore  
Cant you see its just no good  
Ive gotta walk out that door  
Theres nothing left to say  
Ive gotta go my way  
Try and understand  
  
Weve had bad times  
But thats no reason to go  
I cant live without you  
I need you dont you know  
That I still love you  
Dont dont do this to me  
You know I wont make it alone  
Cant you see  
  
I dont love you anymore Dont do this to me  
Cant you see its just no good  
Ive gotta walk out that door  
Thats no reason to go  
Theres nothing left to say  
I cant live without you  
Ive gotta go my way  
Oh no  
  
I dont love you anymore  
Dont do this to me  
Cant you see its just no good  
Ive gotta walk out that door  
Thats no reason to go  
Theres nothing left to say  
I cant live without you  
Ive gotta go my way  
Try and understand  
Okay  
If theres no other way  
Then go
