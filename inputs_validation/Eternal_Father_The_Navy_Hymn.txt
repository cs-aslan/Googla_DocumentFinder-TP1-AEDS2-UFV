Eternal Father strong to save  
Whose arm hath bound the restless wave  
Who biddst the mighty ocean deep  
Its own appointed limits keep  
  
Oh hear us when we cry to Thee  
For those in peril on the sea Amen  
  
Eternal Father lend Thy grace To  
Those with wings who fly thro space  
Thro wind and storm thro sun and rain  
Oh bring them safely home again  
  
Oh Father hear an humble prayer  
For those in peril in the air Amen  
  
Oh Trinity of love and poware  
Our brethren shield in dangers hour  
From rock and tempest fire and foe  
Protect them where so eer they go  
  
Thus evermore shall rise to Thee  
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea Amen
