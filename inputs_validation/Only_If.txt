When theres a shadow near reach for the sun  
When there is loving here look for the one  
And for the promises there is the sky  
And for the heavens are those who can fly  
  
Chorus  
If you really want to you can hear me say  
Only if you want to will you find a way  
If you really want to you can seize the day  
Only if you want to will you fly away  
  
Interlude  
na na na  
  
When theres a journey to follow the star  
When theres an ocean to sail to far  
And for the broken hearts there is the sky  
And for tomorrow are those who can Fly  
  
Chorus  
Bridge  
Je voudrais voler comme un oiseau dailleurs  
bis dailleurs  
  
Chorus
