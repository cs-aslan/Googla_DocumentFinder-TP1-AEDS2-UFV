Hes got something  
I dont know what but its grand  
I can feel it each time he touches my hand  
  
When we walk  
When we talk  
Yeah  
I feel so fine  
Hes got something  
And its mine all mine  
  
Hes got something  
I feel it each time we kiss  
And he thrills me  
Each time he holds me like this  
  
When we part  
Breaks my heart  
I miss him so  
Hes got something  
Only lovers know  
  
Hes got something  
Its so fine  
Hes got something  
Mine all mine  
Hes got something  
I miss him so  
Hes got something  
Only lovers know  
Yeah  
  
Hes got something  
I dont know what but its grand  
I can feel it each time he touches my hand  
  
When we walk  
When we talk  
Yeah  
I feel so fine  
Hes got something  
And its mine all mine  
  
When we part  
Breaks my heart  
Yeah  
I miss him so  
Hes got something  
Only lovers know  
  
Hes got something only lovers know oh
