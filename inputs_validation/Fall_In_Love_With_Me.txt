You look so good to me  
Here in this old saloon  
Way back in West Berlin  
A bottle of white wine  
  
White wine and you  
A table made of wood  
And how I wish you would  
Fall in love with me  
  
You look so good to me  
Standing out in the street  
With your cheap fur on  
Or maybe your plastic raincoat  
  
And your plastic shoes  
They look good too  
Standing in the snow  
Youre younger than you look  
  
Fall in love with me  
Fall in love with me  
How I wish you would  
A table made of wood  
  
And a a bottle of white wine  
And you and a bottle of white wine and you  
And when youre standing  
In the street and its cold  
  
And it snows on you  
And you look younger than you really are  
  
I wish you would  
Fall in love with me  
I wish you would  
Fall in love with me  
  
I wish you would  
Fall in love with me  
I wish you would  
Fall in love with me yeah yeah  
  
The way your eyes are black  
The way your hair is black  
The way your heart is young  
Theres just a few like you  
  
Just the kind I need  
To fall in love with me  
Oh and you look so good  
Oh yes you look so good  
  
A bottle of white wine  
A cigarette and you  
Here in this saloon  
White wine and you  
  
I wish youd fall in love with me  
I wish youd fall in love with me  
Cause theres just a few like you  
So young and real  
  
Theres just a few like you  
So young and real  
Fall in love with me Repeat x 4  
I wish you would  
  
You look so good  
Oh when youre young at heart  
Theres just a few like you  
Youre young at heart  
  
Wont you  
Come to this old saloon  
Come to my waiting arms  
A table made of wood  
  
And I will look at you  
Cause youre so young and pure  
And youre young at heart  
Youre young at heart  
A bottle of white wine  
  
And when youre tumbling down  
You just look better  
When youre tumbling down  
You just look finer
