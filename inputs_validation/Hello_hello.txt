Elton John  
Feet are feeling light  
Head on out to see the sights  
Aint life a many splendored thing  
  
Lady Gaga  
Ducking up and down  
All these crazy sights and sounds  
Bounce around like puppets on a string  
Never gonna find anything to change my mind  
Famous last lines of a fool  
  
Elton John  
Just when you think  
Youre a chain with just one link  
Something comes to tip you off your stool  
  
Both  
Hello hello  
Hello hello

What a surprise

Elton John  
Do a dizzy dance  
Twirl around and take a chance  
Nothings easy  
Nothing comes for free  
  
Lady Gaga  
Sniffing on a flower  
Run through an autumn shower  
  
Both  
Im better off with someone else like me
