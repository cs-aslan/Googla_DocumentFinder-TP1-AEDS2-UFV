Appeal to the governor of Louisiana  
You may get an answer the process is slow  
Federal government too much to help him  
Its been nearly five years  
And they wont let him go  
  
Chorus  
Tyler is guilty the white judge has said so  
What right do we have to say its not so  
Tyler is guilty the white judge has said so  
What right do we have to say its not so  
  
Testify under pressure a racist jury  
Government lawyers its all for show  
With rows of white faces  
False accusations  
Hes framed up for murder  
They wont let him go  
  
Chorus  
  
Police gun was planted  
No matching bullets  
No prints on the handle no proof to show  
But Tyler is guilty the white judge has said so  
They show him no mercy  
They wont let him go  
  
Chorus  
  
Appeal to the governor of Louisiana  
You may get an answer the process is slow  
Federal government too much to help him  
Its been nearly five years  
And they wont let him go  
  
Chorus
