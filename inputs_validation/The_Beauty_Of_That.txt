When I look into your eyes I dont know what to say  
Its been so very long weve been waiting for this day  
When you give me that smile I dont know what to give you back  
So I say oh look at that look at the beauty of that  
When I look into your eyes I see your universe  
And how much better your life could be and how much worse  
I see all that youve done to try and keep you hope intact  
And I say oh look at that look at the beauty of that  
Oh look at that look at the beauty of that  
Oh I guess I was blind until I realized the sun only shines  
When it shines in your eyes  
I say oh look at that look at the beauty of that  
Oh look at that look at the beauty of that
