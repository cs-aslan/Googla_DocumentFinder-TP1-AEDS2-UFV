Well theres a half moon starlit sky  
All the conditions are just right  
Our songs playing on the  
radio Every beat of my heart is saying just let go  
Cause when youre holding me this way  
Its all I can do to just think straight  
A little voice in my head is saying not so fast  
If you really want this love to last  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna catch my breath  
Im gonna count to ten  
Im gonna leave you wonderin when youll see me again  
Im gonna say goodnight with one passionate kiss  
And leave you with the strongest feeling there is  
Ill give you something to miss  
  
Im not doin something Ill regret  
Im playing it just hard enough to get  
Im gonna give you a little space  
And let you enjoy the thrill of the chase  
  
Chorus x2
