The way of life is tough these days its hard to get along  
But Jesus came and he talked to me and thats why I wrote this song  
He told me of my brothers in a far and distant land  
He said that its gettin crowded on Earth and its time we made some plans  
Time we made some plans  
  
He said overpopulation is the problem of today  
Theres too many children on the Earth and more on the way  
If you dont start some birth control then you wont last too much longer  
Its best that we let it save our souls so we can get much stronger  
Get much stronger  
  
Ahhh  
Im afraid of overpopulation  
I dont want to die of suffocation  
The world is full of pollution  
And Jesus is the solution  
  
He said were gettin near the end and Im as close as you are  
If you take Jesus as a friend youre gonna be a big star  
Star that shiness in the sky above a light you cannot sever  
You will be with him above and you will shine forever  
Shine forever  
  
Ahhh  
He trys to be with me  
Hes tryin to set me free  
He wants to be with you  
So you wont have to die
