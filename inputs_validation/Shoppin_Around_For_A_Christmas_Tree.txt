Shoppin around for a Christmas tree  
At the grocery parking lot  
Every thing over 4 foot 3  
Is bout hundred bucks a pop  
Schlepin around for a Christmas tree  
And I still havent found a thing  
In a trailer I met some drunken guy  
And we did some haggling  
  
People get that ornamental feelin every year  
Moms and Dads and kids all happy  
Till they get their hands all scratched and sappy  
  
Shoppin around for Christmas trees  
  
What a crappy holiday  
Today they smell so fresh and green  
Theyll be dead on Christmas Day  
  
You will get that ornamental feeling every year  
When you find a tree that looks real jolly  
If you turn it round its as brown as Charlies  
  
Choppin down my Christmas tree  
In a true oldfashioned way  
Toppin it off with a Spotted Owl  
And make hasty get away
