In a sentimental mood I can see the stars come thru my room  
While your loving attitude is like a flame that lights the gloom  
  
On the wings of every kiss drifts a melody so strange and sweet  
In this sentimental bliss you make my paradise complete  
  
Rose petals seem to fall its all I could dream to call you mine  
My hearts a lighter thing since U made this night a thing divine  
  
In a sentimental mood Im within a world so heavenly  
For I never dreamt that youd be loving sentimental me  
  
In a sentimental mood Im within a world so heavenly  
For I never dreamt that youd be loving sentimental me
