And through the life force and there goes her friend  
On her Nishiki its out of time  
And through the portal they can make amends  
  
Hey would you say whatever were blanket friends  
Cant stop whats coming  
Cant stop whats on its way  
  
And through the walls they made their mudpies  
Ive got your mind I said  
She said Ive your voice  
I said you dont need my voice girl  
You have your own  
But you never thought it was enough of  
So they went years and years  
Like sisters blanket girls  
Always there through that and this  
Theres nothing we cannot ever fix I said  
  
Cant stop whats coming  
Cant stop whats on its way  
Bells and footfalls and soldiers and dolls  
Brothers and lovers she and I were  
Now she seems to be sand under his shoes  
Theres nothing I can do  
Cant stop whats coming  
Cant stop whats on its way  
  
And now I speak to you are you in there  
You have her face and her eyes  
But you are not her  
And we go at each other like blank ettes  
Who cant find their thread and their bare  
  
Cant stop loving  
Cant stop what is on its way  
And I see it coming  
And its on its way
