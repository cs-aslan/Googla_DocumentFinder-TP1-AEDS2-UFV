He swears hell love you by candlelight  
And for a while things seem all right  
And for a moment he hides  
The devil that lies inside  
  
And then one night in a fit of rage  
The demon raises his hand in hate  
And brings it down on you  
There is nothing you can do  
  
And then one night in a twist of fate  
The angels bring your face to me  
I cannot erase the memories  
Of you lying there looking up at me  
  
Chorus  
Please take the demon from my head  
Wont you please erase the memories  
And ghosts who haunt my bed  
I just want you to understand  
That Im gonna be the only man  
To ever touch your soul  
And I aint never letting go  
  
Theres a room that lies down the hall  
Where you sit and write you poems  
Of love and mystery  
Of faith and fantasy  
  
And you keep a secret lover there  
And a book beside an easy chair  
That you read before you go to bed  
To hide the memories in your head  
  
And now I try to understand the pain  
You struggle for the words to say  
It dont come out right  
As you lay your body down  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a place where you go  
Ive been Ill never know  
The pain you keep inside  
The secrets that you hide  
  
But I try to understand your pain  
And be a shelter from the falling rain  
Just maybe I feel what youre going through  
Maybe I have been there too  
  
Please take the demons from my head  
Wont you please take the demons from my head  
I shall try  
Repeat
