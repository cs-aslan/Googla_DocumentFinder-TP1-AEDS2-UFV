Once in a while maybe you will feel the urge  
To break international copyright law  
By downloading MP3s from filesharing sites  
Like Morpheus or Grokster or LimeWire or KaZaA  
But deep in your heart you know the guilt would drive you mad  
And the shame would leave a permanent scar  
Cause you start out stealing songs and then youre robbing liquor stores  
And selling crack and running over school kids with your car  
  
So dont download this song  
The record stores where you belong  
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should  
Oh dont download this song  
  
Oh you dont want to mess with the are I double A  
Theyll sue you if you burn that CDare  
It doesnt matter if youre a grandma or a 7yearold girl  
Theyll treat you like the evil hardbitten criminal scum you are  
  
So dont download this song  
Dont go pirating music all day long  
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should  
Oh dont download this song  
  
Dont take away money from artists just like me  
How else can I afford another solid gold Humvee  
And diamondstudded swimming pools these things dont grow on trees  
So all I ask is everybody please  
  
Dont download this song Dont do it no no  
Even Lars Urlich knows its wrong You can just ask him  
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should You really should  
Oh dont download this song  
  
Dont download this song Oh please dont you do it  
Or you might wind up in jail like Tommy Chong Remember Tommy  
Go and buy the CD Right Now like you know that you should Go out and buy
it  
Oh dont download this song  
  
Dont download this song No no no no no no  
Or youll burn in Hell before too long And youd deserve it  
Go and buy the CD Just buy it like you know that you should Ya cheap
bastard  
Oh dont download this song
