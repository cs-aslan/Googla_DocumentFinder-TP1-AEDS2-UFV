Maybe we why dont we sit right here for half an hour  
Well speak of what a waste I am and how  
We missed your beat again  
  
I swear we need to find some comfort in  
This run down place  
To bridge the gap of this conscious state  
That we live in  
Im short on time  
  
How come you try and fit the shape of  
What they tell you  
  
But mostly what they show you  
That brings us home  
I pray for you to move on  
  
At this rate we cant keep up but I sure  
Cant just sit still  
Im taking back all the things I said  
Keep me filled in I swear Ill come  
  
We walk alone back home  
  
Youre almost gone and Im ok to give you  
Time to be afraid  
I still see your shadow but never your face again  
I remember your presence  
  
I hope to God you come down  
I hope to God you can feel this now  
  
I know there must be some way out of  
Here and all of them will be waiting there
