I was born three months too early  
The doctor gave me thirty days  
But I must have had my mamas will  
And Gods amazing grace  
  
I guess Ill keep on livin  
Even if this loves to die for  
Cause your bags are packed and I aint cryin  
Youre walking out and Im not trying  
To change your mind cause I was born to be  
  
Chorus  
The baby girl without a chance  
A victim of circumstance  
The one who ought a give upbut shes just  
Too hard headed  
A single mom who works two jobs  
Who loves her kids and never stops  
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter  
Im a survivor  
  
I dont believe in self pity  
It only brings you down  
May be the queen of broken hearts  
But I dont hide behind the crown  
When the deck is stacked against me  
  
I just play a different game  
My roots are planted in the past  
And though my life is changing fast  
Who I am is who I want to be  
  
Chorus  
  
A single mom who works two jobs  
Who loves her kids and never stops  
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter  
Im a survivor  
  
But I must have had my mamas will  
And Gods amazing grace
