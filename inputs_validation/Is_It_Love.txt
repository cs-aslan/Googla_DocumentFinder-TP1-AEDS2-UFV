Chorus  
Is it love is it love that I feel  
Is this the love people talk about  
Is it love is it love that I feel  
Is this the love that we used to dream about  
Is it love  
Im standing alone in a bright cold December night  
Im counting the stars while I wait here for you my lady  
They say were meant for each other  
That its too good to be true  
I take a little time to discover  
My bodys aching for you  
Chorus  
Im starting to walk heading home is it over now  
Then youre calling my name I reach out  
Though it hurts so baby  
They say were meant for each other  
That its too good to be true  
I take a little time to discover  
My bodys aching for you  
Chorus  
Can someone explain why I feel  
This burning pain inside it tears me apart  
Makes me weak but I cant resist  
Chorus
