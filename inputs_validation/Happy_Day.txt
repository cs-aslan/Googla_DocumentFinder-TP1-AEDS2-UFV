Inmysensations  
I believe that Iwas  
Born with the things that I know  
I wantto talk  
Like evry  
Before I decide what to do  
  
And I fell all over and I  
Couldnt stand up  
I cant be critical  
I cant wont stop  
Such a happy day  
For me  
Bring a happy day  
To me  
Send a happy day  
To me  
And a happy day  
Came to me come to me here it come  
  
Imonlylooking  
Feel like my heart  
Has a will of its own  
I feelfeel nice inside  
Right here  
And now itssummer again  
  
The story that I told  
The story I made up  
I was foolin around but I  
Cant wont stop  
Such a happy day  
For me  
Bring a happy day  
To me  
Send a happy day  
To me  
And a happy day  
Come to me come to me here it come  
  
Thisboyis in motion  
Some density  
Moved right beside me  
I want  
My sentence  
Right here  
But now Im far away  
  
A sign was given but  
Many years have passed  
Cost a little bit to love you but I  
Wont cant stop  
Such a happy day  
For me  
Bring a happy day  
To me  
Send a happy day  
To me  
And a happy day  
Came to me come to me here it come  
  
Its alright
