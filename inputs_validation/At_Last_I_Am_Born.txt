At last I am born  
Historians note  
I am finally born  
I once used to chase affection withdrawn  
But now I just sit back and yawn  
Because I am born born born  
Look at me now  
From difficult child to spectral hand to Claude Brasseurohblah blah blah  
At last I am born  
Vulgarians know  
I am finally born  
I once thought that time accentuates despair  
But now I dont actually care  
Because I am born born born  
Look at me now  
From difficult child to spectral hand to Claude Brasseurohblah blah blah  
At last I am born  
At last I am born  
Leaving the one true free life born  
I once thought I had numerous reasons to cry  
And I did but I dont anymore  
Because I am born born born  
At last I am born  
At last I am born  
It took me a long long time  
But now I am born  
I once was a mess of guilt because of the flesh  
Its remarkable what you can learn  
Once you are born born born  
Born born born  
Born born born
