The boys gone The boys gone home  
  
What will happen to a face in the crowd when it finally gets too crowded  
And will happen to the origins of sound after all the sounds have sounded  
Well I hope I never have to see that day but by god I know its headed our way  
So I better be happy now that the boys going home The boys gone home  
  
And what becomes of a day for those who rage against it  
And who will sum op the phrase for all left standing around in it  
  
Well I suppose well all make our judgment call  
Well walk it alone stand up tall then march to the fall  
So we better be happy now that well all go home  
  
Be so happy with the way you are  
Be so happy that you made it this far  
Go on be happy now Please be happy now  
  
Because this is something else  
This is something else  
  
I tried to live my life and live it so well  
But when its all over is it heaven or is it hell  
I better be happy now that no one can tell nobody knows  
Im gonna be happy with the way that I am  
Im gonna be happy with all that I stand for  
Im gonna be happy now because the boys going home  
  
The boys gone home
