Away the jokers closing in  
Reform and they will win  
The light is fading fast  
I know you know they know we all know  
Everybodys gonna burn down  
  
The girls come crawling on all fours  
Banging on locked doors  
High cards call the tune  
I know you know they know we all know  
Everybodys gonna burn down  
  
Play me another hand  
Loose everything I am  
Until we meet again  
  
The ace thats hiding up your sleeve  
Will cause the world to grieve  
The love you had is gone  
I know you know they know we all know  
  
The dream in every players heart  
To win it all not part  
They lie awake at night  
I know you know they know we all know  
  
The game where gamblers rule the night  
And get your blood they might  
The jokers closin in  
I know you know they know we all know
