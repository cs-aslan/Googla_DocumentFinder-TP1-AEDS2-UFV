Day and night I wonder how youre feeling  
I wonder if youll ever change your mind  
I dont know just what it is youre dealing  
But I know youve got me in a bind  
  
Bridge  
Day and night I wonder how you do it  
Put me in this awful state of mind  
How on earth can you be so unfeeling  
How on earth can you be so unkind  
  
Chorus  
Well Ill be fine with you in the morning  
If youll be good to me tonight  
Ill be fine with you in the morning  
If youll be good to me tonight  
  
You never want to sit and talk it over  
You always want to run right out the door  
Come and sit right down here on the sofa  
Tell me baby right now whats the score  
  
Dont you tell me there aint nothing doing  
There aint nothing else thats true to say  
I just wanna hear my baby cooing  
I dont wanna hear our love is dead  
  
I will be fine with you if you be good to me  
  
Ill be fine with you in the morning  
If youll be good to me tonight  
Ill be fine with you in the morning  
If youll be good to me tonight  
  
If youll be good to me Ill be fine with you  
If youll be good to me then we just cant lose  
If youll be good to me Ill be happy for all of my days  
  
Day and night I wonder how youre feeling  
I wonder if youll ever change your mind  
I dont know just what it is youre dealing  
But I know youve got me in a bind  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus
