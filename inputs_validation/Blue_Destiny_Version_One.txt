How can I love  
If my love doesnt love only me  
What have I done  
To deserve love that never can be  
  
Once she was just mine alone  
Now shes just someone Ive known  
What can I do  
To change my blue destiny  
  
First she decides  
That our love will always be true  
Next thing I know  
Shes runnin with somebody new  
I ask this heart every day  
Can there be some other way  
What can I do  
To change my blue destiny  
  
There were times  
When love was new  
And both our hearts were gay  
Now the signs say were through  
And bound for separate ways  
  
First she decides  
That our love will always be true  
Next thing I know  
Youre runnin with somebody new  
I ask my heart every day  
Can there be some other way  
What can I do  
To change my blue destiny  
  
Once you were mine  
And wanted the whole world to know  
Now evry time Im around  
You got somewhere to go  
Still I d forgive all your lies darlin  
I realize you only you  
Can change my blue destiny
