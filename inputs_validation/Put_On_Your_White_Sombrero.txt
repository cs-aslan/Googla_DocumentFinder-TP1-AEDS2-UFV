Put on your white sombrero  
Saddle your horse my dear  
And ride off into the sunset  
Youd better go  
For there is no  
Place for you here  
Like and old fashioned hero  
You stand before me  
You think our life is a movie  
My world is real  
I live and feel  
And I can do without you  
Put on your white sombrero  
Your red bandana too  
Think of this day as a showdown  
Goodbye my friend  
This is the end  
For me and you  
Now be a bold vacquero  
Dont show your feelings  
Ill cry while youre disappearing  
Into the night  
All dressed in white  
Unchained and free without me  
Put on your white sombrero  
Like all the cowboys do  
Go find a sweet senorita  
Somebody meek  
Wholl never speak  
Harshly to you  
Youre such a cavaliero  
Proud never bending  
I want someone who will take me  
Just as I am  
I need a man  
Who is in rhyme  
With his time  
Youll never take me  
Just as I am  
I need a man  
Who is in rhyme  
With his time
