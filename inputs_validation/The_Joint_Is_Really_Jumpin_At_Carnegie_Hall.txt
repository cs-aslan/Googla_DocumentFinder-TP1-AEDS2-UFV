Perhaps it was something that hit me perhaps it was something I ate  
But out of the blue I dreamed I met you and you said to me Hi ya Gate  
Millions have heard you play Chopin the critics applaud and approve  
But millions more would simply adore to hear you get in the groove  
  
You wont believe it youll think its a dream  
To hear them riffing it right on the beam  
But when you hear trumpets give out a call youll know  
The Joint Is Really Jumpin down at Carnegie Hall  
  
Instead of Strauss they play Irving Berlin  
Instead of Brahms its Begin the Begin  
Those classic ackies are due for a fall since  
The Joint Is Really Jumpin down at Carnegie Hall  
  
Theyre playing  
Tatleeati Tatleeati with Shostakovich  
Tatleeati Tatleeati Mozart and Bach  
Tatleeati Tatleeati and they dont know which  
Cause anything can happen when they start to rock  
  
The philharmonic was so dignified  
But now theyre groovy and starting to ride  
Handel and Haydn are facing the wall  
cause The Joint Is Really Jumpin down in Carnegie Hall  
  
Theyhey swing evrything with a ding dong  
And when the Maestro gives them a beat its a  
Reet Beat that starts em to toot with a  
Root Toot thats a bit of alright  
And even Jose Iturbi getting hep hes hep hes hep  
Boy  
  
TschaiTschaiTschaikovsky would really be hurt  
To hear em jivin his Piano Concert  
Beethovens lucky he cant hear at all  
Because the Joint Is Really Jumpin down at Carnegie Hall
