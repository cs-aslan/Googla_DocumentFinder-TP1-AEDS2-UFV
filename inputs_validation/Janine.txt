Oh my love Janine  
Im helpless for your smile  
Like a Polish wander  
I travel ever onwards to your land  
And were it not just for the jewels Id close your hand  
  
Your strange demand  
To collocate my mind  
Scares me into gloom  
Youre too intense  
Ill have to keep you in your place  
Ive no defense  
Ive got to keep my veil on my face  
  
Janine Janine youd like to know me well  
But Ive got things inside my head  
That even I cant face  
  
Janine Janine youd like to crash my walls  
But if you take an axe to me  
Youll kill another man  
Not me at all  
  
Youre fey Janine  
A tripper to the last  
But if I catch you standing on my toes  
Ill have a right to shout you down  
For youre a lazy stream  
In which my thoughts would drown  
  
So stay Janine  
And we can glide along  
Ive caught your wings for laughs  
Im not obliged to read you statements of the year  
So take your glasses off  
And dont act so sincere  
  
Janine Janine youd like to know me well  
But Ive got things inside my head  
That even I cant face  
  
Janine Janine youd like to crash my walls  
But if you take an axe to me  
Youll kill another man  
Not me at all  
Yeah  
Oh ah  
Ooooo  
Oh Janine  
Hey Janine  
Oh Janine  
Ah ho  
Oh Janine  
Ho how  
Janine  
Ah Janine yeah  
Janine Janine Janine  
Yeah yeah
