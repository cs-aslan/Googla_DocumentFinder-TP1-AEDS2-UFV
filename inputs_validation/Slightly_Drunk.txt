Slightly drunk once again  
All alone with my pen  
I thought Id write to you  
How can I say how I feel   
Falling down on a deal  
This last night with you  
Is it the cold that makes me shake  
I just hope that Im awake  
I say alright I knew  
I knew  
  
CHORUS  
I was wrong you were right  
Thats a line I cannot find  
I could not say goodbye  
to explain just why I lied  
Whys it always feel the same  
slightly drunk what you said to me  
Im in love once again  
cant fall in love without misery  
  
Im pretty sad but so what  
I should be glad but Im not  
Im confused once more  
All tangled up in your love  
Without it now so thats tough  
My heart cries for  
  
A little talk to anger me  
Out on the road especially  
Back to you once more  
once more  
  
CHORUS   
Slightly drunk once again  
All alone without friends  
Had it all I know I lied  
All my ends seem untied  
I cannot say how I feel
