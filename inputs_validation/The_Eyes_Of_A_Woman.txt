In the eyes of a woman in a world of desire  
From the moment she looked my way I was so hypnotized  
Should I show how I feel shes the magnet Im steel  
The eyes of a woman theres nowhere to run  
The eyes of a woman  
  
In the arms of an angel in a dangerous disguise  
Loves a blue fascination  
Its a mystery that burns takes a lifetime to learn  
The eyes of a woman theres nowhere to run  
The eyes of a woman my fears come undone  
In the eyes of a woman theres nowhere to run  
The eyes of a woman my fears come undone  
  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to run
