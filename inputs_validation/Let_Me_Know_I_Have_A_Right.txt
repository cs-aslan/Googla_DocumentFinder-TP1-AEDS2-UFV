I get a little peck and youre off to bed  
No warmth no hug no kind words are said  
Will you dream of me or someone new instead oh  
Just love me and mean it Ill follow you blind  
Lately I feel like a heart left behind  
I just cant stand still till you make up your mind  
Let me know let me know I have a right  
Before you touch me one more night  
Have I won your love or have I lost the fight  
Let me know let me know I have a right  
To plan my future get on with my life  
Tell me face to face dont try to be polite  
Ill take it Ill make it  
Ooh yes I will  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah  
  
Listen listen  
Im livin each minute with all that Ive got  
Each breath is important each heartbeat is hot  
Thats the way we were way back you forgot He forgot he forgot  
ooh  
You leave me so empty its makin me sad  
To know that a good thing has turned for the bad  
Both of us are here but wheres the love we had  
Let me know let me know I have a right  
Before you touch me one more night  
Have I won your love or have I lost the fight  
Let me know let me know I have a right  
To plan my future get on with my life  
Tell me face to face dont try to be polite  
Let me know let me know  
  
Let me know let me know I have a right  
To plan my future get on with my life  
Tell me face to face dont try to be polite
