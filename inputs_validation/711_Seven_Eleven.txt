711 Mark Davis  
Stairway To Heaven  Led Zeppelin  
  
Theres a lady who goes  
To the store that wont close  
And shes shopping at 7 Eleven  
  
Down the aisle she sees  
Dingdongs beer and Friskies  
And a Snickers really satisfies her  
  
Ooooh make my Slurpy  
  
If theres a penny on the counter  
You can use it  
Please pay inside before pumping gas  
Dear Lebanese cashier how I wish  
You spoke English  
I just bought a Big Gulp from Ahmed

Greetings  
Perhaps you would be enjoying a beef jerky with your purchase of Hustler
magazine  
Do you require a spoon straw  
  
And you will find one down the road  
Coffee and cigarettes to go  
Twinkies from here to Tokyo  
Theyve been robbed eight times in a row  
And the fluorescent lights glow  
Microwave your burrito  
  
And shes shopping at 7 Eleven
