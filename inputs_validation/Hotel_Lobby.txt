She rises with the sunset  
She wonders When will this end  
The world is full of money full of money  
  
She goes out unprotected  
She doesnt listen to her best friend  
Its only for the money for the money for the money  
  
She doesnt want to be respected  
Realitys her best friend  
She needs the extra money extra money  
  
In the city the town and the household  
So many things go unreported  
So many things her eyes have seen eyes have seen eyes have seen  
  
Meet me in the hotel lobby  
Everybodys looking lonely  
Watch me as I walk in slowly  
When your eyes meet mine  
Its in the mirrors of the hotel lobby  
  
This is not what she expected  
Her hopes they stretch and they bend  
Wrinkle like paper money paper money  
  
In the city the town and the household  
So many things can be distorted  
So if you want a true life story bring money bring money  
  
Meet me in the hotel lobby  
Everybodys looking lonely  
Watch me as I walk in slowly  
When your eyes meet mine  
Its in the mirrors of the hotel lobby  
  
Meet me in the hotel lobby  
Everybodys looking lonely  
Watch me as I walk in slowly  
When your eyes meet mine  
Its in the mirrors of the hotel lobby  
  
Shes unprotected  
Shes unprotected oh  
Shes unprotected  
Shes unprotected oh  
  
Meet me in the hotel lobby  
Everybodys looking lonely  
Watch me as I walk in slowly  
When your eyes meet mine  
Its in the mirrors of the hotel lobby  
  
Meet me in the hotel lobby  
Everybodys looking lonely  
Catch me because I think Im falling  
Ill be waiting in the mirrors of the hotel lobby
