The worlds greatest mystery  
Is love between the woman and the man  
Some guys are Romeos  
Others simply do the best they can  
Im just your average ordinary Joe  
Tryin to learn things I never knew I had to know  
Whats a man supposed to do  
  
I dont get no kick from nine to five  
And Im not a man who thinks its true  
Its a womans place to keep a love alive  
Ive watched enough daytime TV  
To know my babys needs  
But sometimes I swear that shes impossible to please  
She says  
  
Chorus  
You give me all that I want of your money baby  
But you never take me dancing  
  
I really think I do a lot to show  
How I feel about her in my way  
Roses on our anniversary  
Candlelight and me on her birthday  
Just when I thought that I had it all worked out  
Now she says I still dont know what its all about  
She says  
  
Chorus  
You give me all that I want of your money baby  
But you never take me dancing  
You give me sweet little talk call me honey baby  
But you never take me dancing  
  
Im just your average ordinary Joe  
Tryin to learn things I never knew I had to know  
  
Chorus
