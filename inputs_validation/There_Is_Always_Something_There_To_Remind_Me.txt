The teachers name was Charles  
He made me feel like Jack  
Thought Martin was late  
Cause he sat right at the back  
Thought my name was Peter  
The time that I was there  
I told him it was Paul  
But he didnt seem to care  
Drawing mustaches and glasses  
While on the ruling classes  
Drawing willies on soldiers  
From Berlin to Damascus  
It shouts out loud  
Im more than you Im more than you  
It shouts out loud  
Im more than you Im more than you  
Making bombs in chemistry  
And catapults in craft  
He thought I must be far too  
Down for this class  
He even told the caretaker  
I didnt want to pass  
And he agreed hed seen me  
Cutting cross his grass  
Would he keep all the marbles  
Hed taken in that year  
Would we stormtroop the staffroom  
And pinch his cans of beer  
It shouts out loud  
Im more than you Im more than you  
It shouts out loud  
Im more than you Im more than you  
There is always something there to remind me  
Something that I shouldve left behind me  
It taps you on the shoulder in a queue  
It shouts across the street Ive more than you  
And there is always something there to remind me of you  
It shouts out loud  
Im more than you Im more than you  
It shouts out loud  
Im more than you Im more than you  
It shouts out loud
