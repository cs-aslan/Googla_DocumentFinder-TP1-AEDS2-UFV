Just to sit back and watch you led by these fuckin clowns  
Four albums in niggas still talking this real shit  
Three classics in nigga and thats on some real shit

Eyes Wide shut with my finger on the cold trigger  
Be hearing my word now dont it sound like my soul bleeding  
Hearing my word now dont it sound like my soul reading  
I do it for street niggas and every nigga thats like you  
Lets see if you can afford one even niggas that buy two  
Cant believe what Im hearing cant believe what ya saying  
All that I did god damn this how you try to play me  
Feeling my words when I be talking that street talk  
No you be feeling my words when I be talking that street smart  
Yeah school of Hard Knocks yeah bitch I graduated  
Straight to them hard blocks and nothing was barricaded
