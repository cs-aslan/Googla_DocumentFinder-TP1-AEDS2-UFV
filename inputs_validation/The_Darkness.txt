I caught the darkness it was drinking from your cup  
I caught the darkness drinking from your cup  
I said is this contagious  
You said just drink it up  
  
I got no future  
I know my days are few  
The presents not that pleasant  
Just a lot of things to do  
I thought the past would last me  
But the darkness got that too  
  
I shoulda seen it coming  
It was right behind your eyes  
You were young and it was summer  
I just had to take a dive  
When I knew was easy the darkness was the price  
  
I dont smoke no cigarette I dont drink no alcohol  
I aint had much loving yet  
But thats always been your call  
Hey I dont miss it baby  
I got no taste for anything at all  
  
I used to love the rainbow  
And I used to love the view  
Another early morning Id pretend that it was you  
But I caught the darkness baby  
And I got it worse than you  
  
I caught the darkness it was drinking from your cup  
I caught the darkness drinking from your cup  
I said is this contagious  
You said just drink it up
