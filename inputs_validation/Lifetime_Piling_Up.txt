I have tried marijuana  
I get nervous every time  
There will come a knockin at the door  
Why is everybody makin eyes at me  
I dont want to know  
Excuse and pardon me  
Stay for a while  
Maybe well never meet again  
  
I can see my lifetime piling up  
I can see the days turn into nights  
I can see the people on the street  
Open those windows up  
A hundred floors below me  
Pilin those houses up  
Pilin them higher higher higher  
I can feel them swayin back and forth  
Building it higher higher  
This towers learning over  
  
I got bad coordination  
Stuck a pencil in my eye  
I can hardly wait to get back home  
Why is everybody gettin paranoid  
Is only havin fun  
Scumbags and superstars  
Tell me your names  
Ill make a bet youre  
Both the same  
  
I can see my lifetime pilin up  
Reaching from my bedroom to the stars  
I can see the house where I was born  
When I was growin up  they say that  
I could never keep my trousers up  
I remember days and crazy nights  
Are there any pirates on this ship  
And if they sober up  theyll have us  
Home by morning  
  
Cry cry cry  
Its just you and I  
Like an automobile  
With no one at the wheel  
Spinning out of control  
Were all over the road  
In our sexy machine  
All the passengers scream  
Scream scream  
  
I can see my lifetime pilin up  
I can see it smashin into yours  
It was not an accident at all  
Open your window up  I hear you laughin  
  
Goin one two three four five  
Goin from the bottom to the top  
Maybe Im holding on too tight  
And now Im growin up  
I got a funny feeling  
Pilin those houses up  
Pilin them higher higher higher  
Building that highway to the stars  
And turning the music up  Hey  
I got a winning number
