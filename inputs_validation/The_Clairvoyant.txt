Feel the sweat break on my brow  
Is it me or is it shadows that are  
Dancing on the walls  
Is this a dream or is it now  
Is this a vision or normality I see  
Before my eyes  
  
I wonder why I wonder how  
That it seems that the powers getting stronger  
Every day  
I feel a strength an inner fire  
But Im scared I wont be able to control it anymore  
  
Theres a time to live and a time to die  
When its time to meet the maker  
Theres a time to live but isnt it strange  
That as soon as youre born youre dying  
  
Just by looking through your eyes  
He could see the future penetrating right  
In through your mind  
See the truth and see your lies  
But for all his power couldnt foresee his own demise  
  
Theres a time to live and a time to die  
When its time to meet the maker  
Theres a time to live but isnt it strange  
That as soon as youre born youre dying  
And reborn again
