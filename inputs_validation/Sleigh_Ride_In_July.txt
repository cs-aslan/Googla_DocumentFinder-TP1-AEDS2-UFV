Giddyyap giddyyap giddyyap lets go  
Lets look at the snow  
Were riding in a wonderland of snow  
Giddyyap giddyyap giddyyap its grand  
Just holding your hand  
Were gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy  
And comfy cozy are we  
Were snuggled up together  
Like two birds of a feather would be  
  
Lets take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on its lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Theres a birthday party at the home of farmer Gray  
Itll be the perfect ending of a perfect day  
Well be singing the songs  
We love to sing without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts  
Pop pop pop pop  
  
Theres a happy feeling  
Nothing in the world can buy  
When they pass around the coffee  
And the pumpkin pie  
  
Itll nearly be like a picture print  
By Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things  
We remember all through our lives  
  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling  
Ring ting tingling too  
Come on its lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Lets take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on its lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Whoo whoo there now  
Steady easy whoo everybody out
