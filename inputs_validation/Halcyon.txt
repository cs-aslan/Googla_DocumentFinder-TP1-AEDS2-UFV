I know its not over  
Baby I worked this out for sure  
Its gonna be colder  
Now you force open the door  
I know you better  
than I ever have before  
I know you  
  
I know youre a fighter  
But you never fought for me  
When I was a shelter  
Cause youre not heading home to me  
We could be closer  
We could be closer  
We could be  
  
When its just us you show me what it feels like to be lonely  
You show me what it feels like to be lost  
Ill take your hand for you to let it go let it go let it go  
When its just us you show me what it feels like to be lonely  
You show me what it feels like to be lost  
Ill take your hand for you to let it go let it go let it go let it go  
Its gonna be  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be better  
  
Well take a long walk  
Down the alleys of these houses  
And well talk  
See what conversation rouses  
When were alone  
When were alone it could be home  
  
When its just us you show me what it feels like to be lonely  
You show me what it feels like to be lost  
Ill take your hand for you to let it go let it go let it go let it go  
Its gonna be  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be  
Its gonna be better  
Its gonna be better
