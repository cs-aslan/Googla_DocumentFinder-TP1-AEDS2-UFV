Our first day together  
Was after wed been close in dreams  
Was after wed shared hell and heaven  
And all the places inbetween  
And all the places inbetween  
  
After wed spent nights together  
And breathed secrets without words  
After wed made promises  
That could but might not have been heard  
Might not have been heard  
  
Knowing me the way you do  
Then why did you just say  
That our first day together  
Was today
