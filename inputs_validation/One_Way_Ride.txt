Concentrate youre on the middle  
Of this one way ride  
In the center lays the key  
To get back off to a while  
If you cant solve this riddle  
Im afraid youll have to stay  
In the   
Of underestimated betrayal  
  
See them point in your direction  
See the indifference in their eyes  
Just living in oblivion  
Struggling with too many wires  
So youve got to solve this riddle  
Other wise you wont get back  
So if I were you  
I would concentrate on the morbid one way track
