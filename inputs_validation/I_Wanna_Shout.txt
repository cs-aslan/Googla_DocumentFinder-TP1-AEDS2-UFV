Do you find it hard to tell me  
To tell that you really love me  
cause I find it hard to tell you  
To tell you that I really love you  
  
And I know whats in your heart  
In your mind in your body and your soul  
But its easy when we whisper  
Not letting people know  
  
We want to shout it out loud  
But we cant let people know  
We want to shout it out loud  
But our love is not for show  
  
Chorus  
Ive got something youve got nothing  
A child a home of my own  
Its so hard for me to break it  
I cant break it I cant make it on my own  
  
Chorus x2
