Hello Peter Panic  
Youve landed on our planet  
What a strange thing you are  
With little pissy eyes  
You got in the television  
Turned us all old and wizened  
Then disappeared  
To a distant star  
And we remember you as  
Peter Panic  
Who lives forever  
Peter Panic  
As light as a feather  
And he says its ok  
When you blow him away  
Hell be back for you some other day  
When youre running out of sugar  
He left his secret with the chemist  
Who made it taste very pleasant  
Now everyone  
Has gone to his star  
Happy to be with  
Peter Panic  
Who lives forever  
Peter Panic  
As light as a feather  
And he says its ok  
When you blow him away  
Hell be back for you some other day  
When youre running out of sugar  
And he says its ok  
When you blow him away  
Hell be back for you some other day  
When youre running out of sugar
