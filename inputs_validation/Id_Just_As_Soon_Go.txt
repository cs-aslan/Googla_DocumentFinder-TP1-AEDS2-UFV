You say you want to talk it over  
Want to try again  
But theres no way of workin out  
This love that were not in  
  
We could talk and talk and accomplish nothin  
Weve tried it all before  
Its time somebody did some walkin  
And I can see the door  
  
So Id just as soon go  
Id just as soon say goodbye  
Theres no reason to prolong  
What we should just let die  
  
And Id just as soon stop  
Id just as soon end the madness  
Knowin what I know  
Id just as soon go  
  
Its not an easy thing to do  
Leavin seldom ever is  
But stayin just to see us through  
Just aint no way to live  
  
Its hard for you to understand  
But were better off this way  
I cant fake it one more night  
Or take it one more day  
  
So Id just as soon go  
Id just as soon say goodbye  
Theres no reason to prolong  
What we should just let die  
  
And Id just as soon stop  
Id just as soon end the madness  
Knowin what I know  
Id just as soon go  
Knowin what I know  
Id just as soon go
