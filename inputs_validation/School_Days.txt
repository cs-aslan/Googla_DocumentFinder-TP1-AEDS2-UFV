Up in the mornin and out to school  
The teacher is teachin the Golden Rule  
American history and practical math  
You studyin hard and hopin to pass  
Workin your fingers right down to the bone  
And the guy behind you wont leave you alone  
  
Ring ring goes the bell  
The cook in the lunch rooms ready to sell  
Youre lucky if you can find a seat  
Youre fortunate if you have time to eat  
Back in the classroom open your books  
Keep up the teacher dont know how mean she looks  
  
Soon as three oclock rolls around  
You finally lay your burden down  
Close up your books get out of your seat  
Down the halls and into the street  
Up to the corner and round the bend  
Right to the juke joint you go in  
  
Drop the coin right into the slot  
Youre gotta hear somethin thats really hot  
With the one you love youre makin romance  
All day long you been wantin to dance  
Feeling the music from head to toe  
Round and round and round we go  
  
Hail hail rock and roll  
Deliver me from the days of old  
Long live rock and roll  
The beat of the drums loud and bold  
Rock rock rock and roll  
The feelin is there body and soul
