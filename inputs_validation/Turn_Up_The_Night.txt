A rumble of thunder Im suddenly under your spell  
No rhyme or reason or time of the season but oh well  
The darkened deliver I shake and I shiver down your soul  
You know what to cover I think for another its a story told  
So get a good hold yeah  
  
Regiment fooled you you thought that you knew who you are  
A simple equation thats the relation but thats gone too far  
A time of suspicion a special condition that we all know  
So let it all go  
  
Turn up the night  
Turn up the night  
Turn up the night it feels so right  
  
Night time sorrow taken like a pain  
Black will not become a white its all the same  
Evil lurks in twilight dances in the dark  
Makes you need the movement like a fire needs a spark to burn  
  
A rumble of thunder Im suddenly under your spell  
No rhyme or reason or time of the season but oh well  
The darkened deliver I shake and I shiver down your soul  
So get a good hold yeah  
  
Turn up the night  
Turn up the night  
Turn up the night it feels so right  
Turn up the night  
Turn up the night  
If it feels right  
Turn off the light  
Turn up the night
