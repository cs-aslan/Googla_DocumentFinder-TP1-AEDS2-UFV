Drop me off in Harlem  
Any place in Harlem  
Theres someone waiting there  
Who makes it seem like Heaven up in Harlem  
  
I dont want your Dixie  
You can keep your Dixie  
Theres no one down in Dixie  
Who can take me way from my hot Harlem  
  
Harlem has those southern skies  
Theyre in my babys smile  
I idolize my babys eyes  
And classy uptown style  
  
If Harlem moved to China  
I know of nothing finer  
Than to stow away on a plane some day  
And have them drop me off in Harlem  
  
Harlem has those southern skies

If Harlem moved to China  
I know of nothing finer  
Than to stow away on a plane some day  
And have them drop me off in Harlem  
  
If Harlem moved to China  
I know nothing finer than to be in Harlem
