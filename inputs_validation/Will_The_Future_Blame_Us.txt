Are you disappointed  
And have we destroyed it  
I well Ive been stumbling down this long and winding road  
And these times are changing  
And its complicated  
I well I dont want to know  
  
Chorus  
And I dont ask why anymore  
And I dont ask why anymore  
Anymore  
  
Is it getting better  
And can we live forever  
I and Im not sure what the hell were fighting for  
Does the money make us  
And will the future blame us  
I oh I dont want to know  
  
Chorus  
  
When youre tired and alone  
And you feel like letting go  
Come home  
When you cant take anymore  
When youre beat up and ignored  
Come home  
  
The son is headed home  
The pastor you dont know  
Youre a long long way from home  
There are things you need to know  
The answers leave you cold  
Youre a long long way from home  
The summers coming back  
And it brings a second chance  
If youre not part of this  
Then I dont want to know  
  
Chorus  
  
When youre tired and alone  
And you feel like letting go  
Come home  
When you cant take anymore  
And youre beat up and ignored  
Come home  
Im coming home
