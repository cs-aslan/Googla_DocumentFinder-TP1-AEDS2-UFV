Well were back in school again  
And I dont really know anyone  
I really want to be your friend  
Cause I dont really know anyone  
  
And the bus is pulling  
Up to your house  
I wish you could be sitting here  
Next to me  
  
I didnt see you at summer school  
But I saw you at the corner store  
And I dont want to break the rules  
Cause Ive broken them all before  
  
But every time I see you  
I wonder why  
I dont break a couple rules  
So that youll notice me  
  
Sister do you know my name  
Ive heard it before but I want you to know  
  
I got a funny feeling  
That its gonna work out  
Cause now I see you sitting here  
Next to me
