Father come save us from this  
Madness were under  
God of creation are we blind  
Cause some here are slaves  
That worship guns that spit thunder  
The children that youve made  
Have lost the minds  
  
This monster that we call the earth  
Is bleeding  
Cause the children have been  
Left along too long  
This thing that weve made is fat  
And feeds on the hate  
Of the millions that its taught to sing  
The song  
  
The headless children  
The screams that fill the night  
Fill the night fill the night fill the night  
Oh the headless children  
The madness steals the light  
Steals the light steals the light steals the light  
  
Time bombs in the hands of all the wicked warbabies  
Light the fuse of temptation and we all burn  
Four horsemen sit high up in the saddle  
And waiting are ride the bloody trail of no return  
  
Sleeping in the arms of a nightmare and  
Wake to find weve been away too long  
This Frankenstein of flash  
Stitched together back from death  
And preying on the souls of everyone  
  
The headless children  
The screams that fill the night  
Fill the night fill the night fill the night  
Oh the headless children  
The madness steals the light  
Steals the light steals the light steals the light
