Oh take me higher all the way to the sun  
Down to the wire fightings only begun  
  
Its closing in on you closing in on you  
One from the fire weighing down on you  
Its closing in on you closing in on you  
Oh you know it all oh oh  
  
I will persevere I will resist you here  
I will interfere  
Im not the only son my will will be done  
Im the scent begun  
  
Its closing in on you closing in on you  
One from the fire weighing down on you  
Its closing in on you closing in on you  
Oh you know it all  
Gonna make it through gonna make it through  
  
The fight back to like a wrecking crew  
Closing in on you closing in on you oh  
And know it all oh oh  
  
Oh take me higher all the way to the sun  
I will persevere I will resist you here  
I will interfere  
  
Its closing in on you closing in on you  
One from the fire weighing down on you  
Its closing in on you closing in on you  
Oh you know it all oh  
  
Gonna make it through gonna make it through  
The fight back to like a wrecking crew  
Closing in on you closing in on you  
And know it all oh oh
