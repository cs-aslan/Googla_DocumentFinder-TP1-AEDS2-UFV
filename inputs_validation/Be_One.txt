We dont feel ready  
We dont feel steady  
Question what we really have to give  
Stay where its safer  
Claim faith but waiver  
Is this how we really meant to live  
  
We pray but never move  
We say but never do  
  
Its time to get our hands dirty  
Be love theres a whole lot of hurting  
Calling all hearts  
Calling all hands  
Calling all feet to take a stand  
Why sit around and wait for a miracle to come  
When we can be one  
When we can be one  
When we can be one  
  
A little somethin  
Might feel like nothin  
But in His hands its all well ever need  
To speak life to the broken  
Watch the blind eyes open  
Its who Hes calling you and me  
To be  
  
Its time to get our hands dirty  
Be love theres a whole lot of hurting  
Calling all hearts  
Calling all hands  
Calling all feet to take a stand  
Why sit around and wait for a miracle to come  
When we can be one  
When we can be one  
  
We can be the change be the hope  
We can be the arms that dont let go  
We can be a light in the dark  
We are we are where it starts  
  
Its time  
Be love theres a whole lot of hurting  
Calling all hearts  
Calling all hands  
Calling all feet to take a stand  
Why sit around and wait for a miracle to come  
When we can be one  
When we can be one  
When we can be one  
We can be the change be the hope  
Yeah  
We can be the arms that dont let go  
Calling all hearts  
Calling all hands
