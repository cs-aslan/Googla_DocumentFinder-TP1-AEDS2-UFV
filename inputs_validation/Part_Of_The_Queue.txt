So then be off find that Ive lost my way in the city  
The streets and the thousands of colours all bleed into one  
I fall down Heaven wont help me  
I call out noone would hear  
All of a sudden Ive lost my way out of the City  
  
Stand tall stand proud  
Every beginning is breaking its promise  
Im having trouble just finding some soul in this town  
  
Name on the faces in places  they mean nothing to me  
Its all they can do to be part of a queue in this town  
I fall down Heaven wont help me  
I call out noone will hear  
Therell be no tomorrow they say well Ill say mores the pity  
  
Stand tall stand proud  
Every beginning has broken its promise  
Im having trouble just finding some soul in this town  
  
Stand tall stand proud  
Every beginning has broken its promise  
Im having trouble just finding my soul in this town  
  
Finding my soul in this town  
Keep on trying  
Keep on trying  
Keep on trying  
Keep on trying  
Keep on trying  
Keep on trying  
Keep on trying  
Keep on trying
