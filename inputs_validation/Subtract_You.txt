Another day  
Another Clean Break  
Another Cigarette and I think Im gonna be okay  
Some other way  
Some other mistake  
Some other reason saying that you are never gonna stay  
  
You are the plug and I am the socket  
You are the rock and I come to rock it  
You see the truth when I bring the bullshit  
You make me whole when i feel alone  
  
Hands to the sky  
Why you want to go and roll by me  
Hands to the sky  
Why you got to go now  
  
Cracked in two  
Im in you  
Im standing on this bridge and youre to blame  
Count to two  
Subtract you  
Im jumping from this bridge and youre to blame  
  
Lets get away  
Lets give in tonight  
Lets put the blanket on the sand I think well be alright  
Inside a place  
I know youre all mine  
Inside a crowded room your smile reminds me Ill be fine  
  
You are the drug and Im feeling higher  
You sell your soul and I am the buyer  
Youre a bboy record and Im the DJ  
You do what you want when I want it my way  
  
Hands to the sky  
Why you want to go and roll by me  
Hands to the sky  
Why you got to go now  
  
Cracked in two  
Im in you  
Im standing on this bridge and youre to blame  
Count to two  
Subtract you  
Im jumping from this bridge and youre to blame
