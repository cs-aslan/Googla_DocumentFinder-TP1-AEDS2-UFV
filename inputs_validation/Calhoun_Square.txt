I dont like this much to drink  
I was there  
I know right now its hard to think  
I dont care  
But its time for you and me to wonder  
Why were here  
Maybe we should roll to the rock and rumble  
Calhoun Square Lets roll  
  
Chorus   
Meet me there  
If you dare  
Calhoun Square  
  
It dont matter clothes youre wearin  
Or your hair  
If youre freaky they dont care and  
They dont stare Aint nobody lookin at you  
All that matters if youre happy  
And if youre there Are you there  
Dont you want to roll to the rock and rumble  
Calhoun Square Dont you want to Come on now  
  
Hey  
  
Chorus   
  
Walk through veils of many colors  
If you dare Do you dare  
Jasmine peach and love for others  
In the air Its all in the air  
Dont be shocked to see your mother  
In the chair Sit down baby  
Everybody roll to the rock and rumble  
Calhoun Square Oh Lord  
  
Hey come on  
Oh Lordoh Lord  
Here me now  
  
Repeat x2  
Calhoun Square Calhoun Square  
  
Meet me there  
If you dare  
Calhoun Square
