you come to me girl  
tears are in your eyes  
your heads bowed in sorrow  
you whisper your goodbyes  
  
theres nothing I can tell you  
to make you want to stay  
so let me ask one question  
before you slip away  
  
after you leave me  
where can I go  
after you leave me  
what will I do  
  
Ive seen this moment coming  
for such a long long time  
Ive laid awake for hours  
rehearsing every line  
  
but now that its here girl  
cant think of anything to say  
so let me ask one question  
before you slip away  
  
after you leave me  
where can I go  
after you leave me  
what will I do  
  
every time that  
I get next to her  
Im hung up in this ring of fire  
  
if I love her  
should I let her go  
or should I beg on a bended knee  
  
how much longer  
lord I just dont know  
I just cant take it girl  
Im breaking up oer you  
  
after you leave me  
where can I go  
after you leave me  
what will I do  
  
after you  
after you leave
