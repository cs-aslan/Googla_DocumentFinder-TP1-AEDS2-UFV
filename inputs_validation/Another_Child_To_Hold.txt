Another Child To Hold  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
She looks down at her angel  
Sleeping in his bed  
She gently kneels beside him  
And then she bows her head  
And just like other mothers  
Who lived so long ago  
She brings her child to Jesus  
And give him to the Lord  
chorus  
Jesus heres another child to hold  
Keep this child safe and warm  
This world can be so cold  
Take this child in Your arms  
And never let him go  
Jesus heres another child to hold  
He watched his only daughter  
Leaving on a date  
He doesnt want to worry  
But now its getting late  
Waiting in the darkness  
He kneels down on the floor  
And offers up a silent prayer  
As he listens for the door  
Wherever there are children Lord  
In danger or in need  
May you find someone there  
Praying on their knees  
Oh please  
chorus
