Doctor Livingston I presume  
Stepping out of the jungle gloom  
Into the midday sun  
What did you find there  
Did you stand a while and stare  
Did you meet anyone  
Ive seen butterflies galore  
Ive seen people big and small  
Ive still not found what Im looking for  
Were all looking for someone  
Were all looking for someone  
Were all looking for someone  
Captain Scott you were so bold  
Now youre looking rather cold  
Out there in the snow  
What did you find there  
Did you stand a while and stare  
Did you meet anyone  
Ive seen polar bears and seals  
Ive seen giant Antarctic eels  
Ive still not found what Im looking for  
Were all looking for someone  
Were all looking for someone  
Were all looking for someone  
Columbus where are you bound  
So you think the world is round  
Sailed off in the blue  
What did you find there  
Did you stand a while and stare  
Did you meet anyone  
There are Indians by the score  
In many places that I saw  
Ive still not found what Im looking for  
Were all looking for someone  
Were all looking for someone  
Were all were all were all looking for someone  
Were all looking for someone
