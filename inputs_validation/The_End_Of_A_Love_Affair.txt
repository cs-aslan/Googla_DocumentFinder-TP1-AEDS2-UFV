So I walk a little too fast and I drive a little too fast  
And Im reckless its true but what else can you do  
At the end of a love affair  
  
So I talk a little too much and I laugh a little too much  
And my voice is too loud when Im out in a crowd  
So that people are apt to stare  
  
Do they know do they care that its only that Im lonely  
And low as can be  
And the smile on my face isnt really a smile at all  
  
So I smoke a little too much and I drink a little too much  
And the tunes I request arent always the best  
But the ones where the trumpets blare  
  
So I go at a maddening pace  
And I pretend that its taking your place  
But what else can you do at the end of a love affair  
  
So I smoke a little too much and I drink a little too much  
And the tunes I request arent always the best  
But the ones where the trumpets blare  
  
So I go at a maddening pace  
And I pretend that its taking your place  
But what else can you do at the end of a love affair
