When all else fails and you have nothing  
You know you really should believe in something  
Take a look at what you have  
To a dream thats not all that bad  
Dont waste time with all your thinking  
Wake up now your dreams are sinking  
Making the change is up to you  
Youll accept nothing less than the best  
  
Come come come on  
Bring out the magic  
Come come come on  
Bring out the magic  
  
Its much quicker than the eye  
Its you mind and its there all the time  
Say goodbye this is tomorrow  
Make your mind up not to follow  
You can lead yourself away Understand You can have what you say  
  
Come come come on  
Bring out the magic  
Come come come on  
Bring out the magic  
  
You can stay with me now  
And tell me what you know  
You can stay with me now  
And tell me all you know  
  
Come come come on  
Bring out the magic  
Come come come on  
Bring out the magic
