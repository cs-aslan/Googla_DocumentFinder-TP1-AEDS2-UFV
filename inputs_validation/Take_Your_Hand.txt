Hey I feel like I could just blow on up  
Anytime I could just lose control  
Caught up in your lovin every time I feel your touch  
Second thoughts small doubts start to beat me up  
Youre everything I wanted before I knew just what I wanted  
And hey hey youre killing me on the inside  
Youre the only one I want I cant deny  
  
Chorus  
Dont know what to do what to say  
Im not sure what to tell you confused  
Which way do I take your hand or let go  
Do I take your hand or let it go  
I cant take this feeling much more  
Do I take your hand or let go  
Dont know what to do what to say  
Im not sure what to tell you confused  
Which way do I go  
  
Hey I feel I could blow on up  
Every time I feel your love I get so caught up  
Its your kiss its your touch its just everything  
But Im feeling like I want to just run away  
Cant tell you what I want but youre everything I want  
And hey hey its killing me on the inside  
Cause youre all I ever wanted so I cant deny  
  
Chorus  
  
Somebody tell me  
Oh is it that Im so wrong I cant say  
Or is it my life so young careless ways  
And in your eyes so much love you want to give  
But the more I hold you in my arms the pressure starts to build  
Build build build build  
  
Chorus  
  
Take your hand or let go  
Take your hand or let it go Repeat x5
