Sundown in the Paris of the prairies wheat kings have all their treasures
buried  
And all you hear are the rusty breezes pushing  
Around the weather vane Jesus  
  
In his Zippo lighter he sees the killers face maybe  
Its someone standing in a killers place twenty years for nothing well
thats  
Nothing new besides no ones interested in something you didnt do  
Wheat kings and pretty things lets just see what the morning brings  
  
Theres a dreamy dream where the high school is dead and stark its a museum  
And were all locked up in it after dark where the walls  
Are lined all yellow grey and sinister hung  
With pictures of our parents prime ministers wheat kings and pretty things  
Wait and see what tomorrow brings  
  
Late breaking story on the CBC a nation whispers  
We always knew that hed go free they add you cant be fond of living in  
The past cause if you are then theres no way that youre gonna last  
Wheat kings and pretty things  
Lets just see what tomorrow bring  
Wheat kings and pretty things  
Oh thats what tomorrow brings
