Its complicated  
It always is  
Thats just the way it goes  
Feels like Ive waited so long for this  
I wonder if it shows  
  
Head under water  
Now I cant breathe  
It never felt so good  
Cause I can feel it coming over me  
I wouldnt stop it if I could  
  
When love takes over yeahaheah  
You know you cant deny  
When love takes over yeahaheah  
Cause somethings here tonight  
  
Give me a reason  
I gotta know  
Do you feel it too  
Cant you see me here on overload  
And this time I blame you  
Looking out for you to hold my hand  
It feels like I could fall  
Now love me right like I know you can  
We could lose it all  
  
When love takes over yeahaheah  
You know you cant deny  
When love takes over yeahaheah  
Cause somethings here tonight  
  
Tonight tonight tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight  
IIIll be loving you all the time its true  
Cause IIIll want to make it right with you  
  
When love takes over  
When love takes over  
When love takes over  
When love takes over  
When love takes over  
When love takes over  
When love takes over  
Over over over over  
Over over over over  
Over over  
  
When love takes over yeahaheah  
You know you cant deny  
When love takes over yeahaheah  
Cause somethings here tonight
