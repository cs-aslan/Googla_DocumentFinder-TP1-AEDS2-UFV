Theres been a lot of talk around  
That youve been seen with a certain party  
And now Im so afraid Im losing you  
Oh baby dont tell me you dont want my love  
I couldnt give it to just anybody  
Baby wont you say it isnt true  
  
Dont leave me baby  
Dont tell me its over  
After I trusted you  
And did my best to make you happy  
Is this what I get for lovin you baby  
Is this what I get for lovin you baby  
There was a night when you held me tight  
And you said youd always love me  
You said youd never hurt me  
  
What will there be left for me  
Its such a cruel world to be alone in  
I always needed you to look out for me  
Oh baby Im gonna miss your lovin arms  
Theyre the only arms I feel at home in  
Dont you know how lonely Im gonna be  
  
Dont leave me baby  
Dont tell me its over  
After I trusted you  
And did my best to make you happy  
Is this what I get for lovin you baby  
Is this what I get for lovin you baby  
There was a night when you held me tight  
And you said youd always love me  
You said youd never hurt me
