Fly dont fly on me  
fly around somebody new  
Fly dont fly on me  
your buzzing and your humming is making me blue  
I cant sleep at night  
I toss and turn with all of my might  
knowing you are there  
youll take my dreams and turn my dreams into a nightmare  
When I go to sleep  
I dont count the sheep  
I just think about my sweetiepie  
Then you fly on me  
oh what misery  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
you mess me up and wake me up so I wanna cry  
  
Fly dont fly on me  
fly so I can dream all night  
Fly dont fly on me  
and when you go away Ill see her holding me tight  
cause in my dreams I know shes gonna treat me so right  
When I go to sleep  
I dont count the sheep  
I just think about my sweetiepie  
Then you fly on me  
oh what misery  
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
you mess me up and wake me up so I wanna cry  
  
Fly dont fly on me  
fly so I can dream all night  
Fly dont fly on me  
and when you go away Ill see her holding me tight  
cause in my dreams I know shes gonna treat me so right  
Fly dont fly on me shoo  
Fly dont fly on me shoo
