Read it in the papers it aint fair  
You know who today dont seem to care  
Livin lovin gettin loose  
Masturbatin with a noose  
Now someones kickin out the chair  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Some kind of Voodoo  
Come across this land  
Some kind of Voodoo  
We need a medicine man  
Everybodys lookin at the sky  
Cant believe the cover ups and lies  
They been tellin us since birth  
Pissin off old Mother Earth  
My gones are bygones prophesized  
Come on  
Some kind of Voodoo  
Come across this land  
Some kind of Voodoo  
We need a medicine man  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Oh oh oh oh  
Wonder should I go or should I stay  
What we got aint working any way  
I did my best God knows Ive tried  
I feel like Ive been crucified  
Why did you why did you  
Why did you take it all away  
Voodoo Voodoo Medicine Man
