Young Pegi just died today  
Young Pegi just died today  
And I guess  
Nobody even knows the case  
But the way the story goes  
She just ran out of clothes  
No will this world  
Just for the peg down  
Last words cant talk  
And then she wrote  
  
Some people cant stand no rain  
Some people cant stand no rain  
When its cloudy outside  
You cant see the sun  
But on a bright and sunny day  
The people all go away  
Except one  
Oh no dont pity me babe  
I know Im alright  
O yeah Im alright  
  
Dont see no tears around me  
Dont see no tears around me  
I dont take too much stock  
In the things people say  
Im not saying that theyre wrong  
Theyve just  
Been standing around too long  
Gone bad  
Oh no dont pity me babe  
I know Im alright  
O yeah Im alright  
  
Cant ride my broom no more  
Cant ride my broom no more  
Cause the landladys taken  
To sweeping the floor  
I guess Ill go back to my place  
And occupy a little space  
John Doe  
Oh no dont pity me babe  
I know Im alright  
O yeah Im alright  
  
The streets are crammed cant walk  
Might find somebody and talk  
I cant find nobody who  
Say boo guess who  
Cause that street  
Is paved with aires  
And everybody is putting on theirs  
Cant breathe  
Oh no dont pity me babe  
I know Im alright  
O yeah Im alright  
  
Hes standing outside my door  
Hes standing outside my door  
But he wont ring the bell  
And hes just to scared to knock  
And hes puzzled  
And hes young  
And hes doing whats  
Already been done  
One more  
Oh no dont pity me babe  
I know Im alright  
O yeah Im alright  
  
Oh no dont pity me babe  
I know Im alright
