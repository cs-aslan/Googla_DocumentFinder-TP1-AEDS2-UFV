Intro  
Girl understand why  
See its burning me to hold onto this  
I know this is something I gotta do  
But that dont mean I want to  
What Im trying to say is that Iloveyou I just  
I feel like this is coming to an end  
And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you  
I gotta let it burn  
Verse 1  
Its gonna burn for me to say this  
But its coming from my heart  
Its been a long time coming  
But we done been fell apart
