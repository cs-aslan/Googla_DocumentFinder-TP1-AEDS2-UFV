My white bicycle my white bicycle  
  
Riding all around the street  
Four oclock and theyre all asleep  
Im not tired and its so late  
Moving fast everything looks great  
  
My white bicycle my white bicycle  
  
See that man hes all alone  
Looks so happy but hes far from home  
Ring my bell smile at him  
Better kick over his garbage bin  
  
My white bicycle my white bicycle  
  
The rain comes down but I dont care  
The wind is blowing in my hair  
Seagulls flying in the air  
  
My white bicycle my white bicycle  
  
Policeman shouts but I dont see him  
Theyre one thing I dont believe in  
To find some charge but its not leavin  
  
Lift both hands his head in disgrace  
Shines no light upon my face  
Through the darkness we still speed  
My white bicycle and me  
  
My white bicycle my white bicycle
