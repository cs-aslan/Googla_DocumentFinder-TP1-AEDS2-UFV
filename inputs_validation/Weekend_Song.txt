This backbreakin boneshakin bellyachin hardworkin  
Two more hours to go  
Yes its keeping me alive doin nine to five  
And I aint got nothin to show  
Pretty soon Ill be leavin  
With the wages Im receivin  
But I know its gonna be all right  
Come on babe and take me away  
We got some money to spend tonight  
Pick me up at the station  
Meet me at the train  
Have a meal and a shower and a change of clothes  
I cant afford a vacation  
But I can take the strain  
Long as I can be with you  
Find a way to burn it as quickly as I earn it  
Yes its backbreakin boneshakin bellyachin hardworkin  
Two more hours to go  
Seven long years for the same corporation  
And I aint got nothin to show  
And tonight when Im leavin Ill be just breakin even  
But I know its gonna be all right  
I shake off my blues when you put on your shoes  
We got some money to spend tonight  
Oh I dont wanna stand here and sound accusin  
Everybody does their share of losin  
If Im gonna lose it I might as well be doin it right  
Pick me up at the station  
Meet me at the train  
Have a meal and a shower and a change of clothes  
I cant afford a vacation  
But I can take the strain  
Long as I can be with you  
Find a way to burn it as quickly as I earn it  
Yes its backbreakin boneshakin bellyachin hardworkin  
Two more hours to go  
Yes its keepin me alive doin nine to five  
And I aint got nothin to show  
And tonight when Im leavin Ill be just breakin even  
But I know its gonna be all right  
Come on babe and take me away  
We got some money to spend tonight  
Come on babe take me away  
We got some money to spend tonight
