I cant have you blues  
I got the I cant have you I cant have you blues  
I cant have you I cant have you blues  
I cant have you I cant have you  
Nothings the same need my fix of you  
A crack in the mirror pictures split in two  
I cant believe you slipped away  
I been drinking too much cause Im trying to forget your face  
And if I always try to do all the things you want me to  
Ive been letting myself down to an early grave  
And if I always try to do all the things you want me to  
Ive been letting myself down to an early grave  
Nothing stays the same in this game  
I cant have you I cant have you blues  
I cant have you I cant have you  
Nothings the same need my fix of you  
A crack in the mirror pictures blank too  
I cant believe you slipped away  
I been drinking too much cause Im trying to forget your face  
And if I always try to do all the things you want me to  
Ive been letting myself down to an early grave  
Nothing stays the same in this game  
I cant have you I cant have you blues  
I cant have you I cant have you blues  
I cant have you I cant have you blues  
I cant have you I cant have you blues
