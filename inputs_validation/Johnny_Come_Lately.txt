feat Steve Earl  
  
Im an American boys and Ive come a long way  
Born and bred in the USA  
So listen up close Ive got something to say  
Boys Im buying this round  
Well it took a little while but were in this fight  
And we aint going home til weve done whats right  
Were gonna drink Camden Town dry tonight  
If I have to spend my last pound  
  
When I first got to London it was pourin down rain  
Met a little girl in the field canteen  
Painted her name on the nose of my plane  
Six more missions Im gone  
Well I asked if I could stay and she said that I might  
Then the warden came around yelling Turn out the lights  
Death rainin out of the London night  
We made love til dawn  
  
Chorus  
But when Johnny Come Lately comes marching home  
With a chest full of medals and a GI loan  
Theyll be waitin at the station down in San Antone  
When Johnny comes marching home  
  
My P47 is a pretty good ship  
And she took a round comin cross the channel last trip  
I was thinkin bout my baby and letting her rip  
Always got me through so far  
Well they can ship me all over this great big world  
But Ill never find nothing like my North End girl  
Im taking her home with me one day sir  
Soon as we win this war  
  
Chorus  
  
Now my grandaddy sang this song  
Told me about London when the Blitz was on  
How he married grandma and brought her back home  
A hero thoughout his land  
Now Im standing on a runway in San Diego  
A couple Purple Hearts and I move a little slow  
Theres nobody here maybe nobody knows  
About a place called Vietnam  
  
Chorus
