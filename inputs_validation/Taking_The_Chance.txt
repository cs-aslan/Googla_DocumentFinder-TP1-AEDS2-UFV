Youre inbetween a page of life you never dreamed  
The answer wont come from that magazine  
this time its real and youre not sure just what to feel  
Who can I trust to say  
Should I give love now should I take love now  
  
CHORUS  
Im taking the chance  
And giving myself to you  
If somethings not right then tell me Im wrong  
I just want it all to carry on  
  
Sometimes the fear of losing you has been so near  
I needed to make this choice on my own  
To let love in when Im so scared when things begin  
Dont run away I feel close to you now  
You know I need you now  
  
CHORUS  
Im taking the chance  
And giving myself to you  
If somethings not right then tell me Im wrong  
I just want it all to carry on  
Im taking the chance  
I cant let this feeling leave  
I dont want those nights of waiting so long  
Im taking the chance before its gone  
  
Taking the chance  
Taking the chance  
Taking the chance  
Taking the chance  
On you  
  
CHORUS
