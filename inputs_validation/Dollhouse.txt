Well ever since you were a little girl  
You set the rules in your little world  
But girls grow up and throw their toys away  
Youre a big girl now but you still wanna play  
Girl were living  
You dress them up the way you want to  
Girl were living  
You make them do just what you want them to  
Girl were living  
Once I thought we had a love that was true  
But Im just another doll in your dollhouse to you  
  
Were living in a dollhouse  
Were living in a dollhouse  
Girl were living in a dollhouse  
You may feel safe and sound  
But your dollhouse girl is falling down  
  
Its all been neatly arranged in your mind  
Every detail fits your own design  
Every room is perfectly in place  
But I can see the sadness baby on your face  
You had a plan and darling like a child  
You thought its down to fashion down to style  
But your little dreamhouse is runnin wild  
Before your very eyes were shrinking down to size  
  
Were living in a dollhouse  
Were living in a dollhouse  
Girl were living in a dollhouse  
You may feel safe and sound  
But your dollhouse girl is falling down  
  
Everythings as you dreamed it would be  
But theres something wrong that you cant see  
Room by room you keep looking for some little flaw  
A crack somewhere in your dollhouse wall  
Something girl that will explain away  
The hurt you feel darling when we play  
  
Your little dolls they got grip on you  
Until youre just another doll in your dollhouse too  
Were living in a dollhouse  
Girl were living in a dollhouse  
Oh were living in a dollhouse  
We may feel safe and sound  
But our dollhouse girl is falling down  
Oh were living in a dollhouse  
Girl were living in a dollhouse  
Yeah were living in a dollhouse
