You come on strong telling everyone  
About your latest role  
How you saved the movie stole the show  
Well everybody knows  
And if you have no time for all your offers  
Youll see that I get called  
And if you have no time for all your men  
Youll see that I get balled  
  
Well I dont expect humility  
But what about some good old fashioned dishonest modesty  
  
You say that you can understudy  
All the other parts  
You can write a song that will make us cry  
that touches all our hearts  
And you can House and Garden  
Vogue and Glamour Mademoiselle  
But I know you can Bitch and Screw  
And Penthouse just as well  
  
I dont expect humility  
But what about some good old dishonest modesty  
  
You try to be unique  
But somehow somethings wrong  
Cause your flower childish vision of life  
Cannot last too long  
Youre over thirty and underweight  
Though you call yourself petite  
And you hang around with all the clowns  
You think theyre so elite  
  
Well I dont expect humility  
But what about some good old fashioned dishonest modesty
