I was sittin at home all alone when I heard that telephone ring  
And there on the line was a friend of mine sayin he wasnt doin a thing  
So Im steppin out on the town tonight to party where the drinks are free  
Theres a sweet young thing ready and waitin on me  
  
Chorus  
Young and fine strike you blind  
Smokestack lightnin make you lose your mind  
Shes got looks that kill can fire at will  
Smokestack lightnin shes all I need  
  
When we got to the place I got me a taste  
I knew shed be good for a game  
Dancin out on the floor she was ready for more  
She knew all the boys by their names  
I said hey sweet thing let me pull your string  
Let me take you home  
I woke up in a hour with my money and my memory gone  
  
Chorus  
  
Young and fine strike you blind smokestack lightnin  
  
Chorus
