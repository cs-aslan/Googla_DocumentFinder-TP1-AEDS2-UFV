I love the blues  
They tell my story  
If you dont feel it you can never understand  
So many times I thought about it  
And now I know just what it means to be a man  
  
Everyday I realize you can see it in my eyes  
I never wait or hesitate  
Cause I love the life I live  
Im gonna live the life I choose  
You gotta understand  
Im walking in the shadow of the blues  
  
All of my life Ive had a strange reputation  
Ive been the black sheep of the family all along  
I never know if in my heart Im really guilty  
But Ive been accused of never knowing right from wrong  
  
Everyday I realize you can see it in my eyes  
I never wait or hesitate  
Cause I love the life I live  
Im gonna live the life I choose  
You gotta understand  
Im walking in the shadow of the blues  
  
My father said youre crazy  
He said what you gonna do  
I left with my guitar and said  
Ill leave it up to you  
  
Im gonna live the life I love  
And live the life I choose  
And Im walking in the shadow of the blues  
  
I love the blues  
They tell my story  
If you dont feel it I will tell you once again  
All of my life Ive been caught up in a crossfire  
Cause Ive been branded with the devil mark of cain  
  
Everyday I realize you can see it in my eyes  
I never wait or hesitate  
Cause I love the life I live  
Im gonna live the life I choose  
You gotta understand  
Im walking in the shadow of the blues  
Im walking in the shadow of the blues
