You and your baby had some words today  
Till not another word was left to say  
I see that grin boy  
Maybe you think youll win boy  
Until the sun goes down and once again boy  
  
One lonely night  
One lonely night  
Thats all it takes to completely break you  
  
They say its darkest right before the dawn  
But oh those darkest hours can be so long  
Youre feeling strong boy  
Tellin yourself shes wrong boy  
But how much longer can this night go on boy  
  
One lonely night  
One lonely night  
Thats all it takes to completely break you  
  
One lonely night  
One lonely night  
Thats all it takes to completely break you  
  
Oooh shes such a good find  
Have you gone and lost your mind  
You should know shes one of a kind  
  
Oooh shes such a good find  
Have you gone and lost your mind  
You should know shes one of a kind  
  
Just one lonely night  
One lonely night  
Thats all it takes to completely break you
