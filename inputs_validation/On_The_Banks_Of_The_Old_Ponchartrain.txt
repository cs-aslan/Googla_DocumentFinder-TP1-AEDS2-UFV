I A travelled from A7 Texas to D old LouisA anne  
Through valleys oer mountains and E7 plains  
Both A footsore and A7 weary I D rested aA while  
On The E7 Banks Of The Old PoncharA train  
  
The fairest young maiden that I ever saw  
Passed by as it started to rain  
We both found a shelter beneath the same tree  
On The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain  
  
We hid from the shower an hour or so  
She asked me how long Id remain  
I told her that Id spend the rest of my days  
On The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain  
  
I just couldnt tell her that I ran away  
From jail on a West Texas plain  
I prayed in my heart I would never be found  
On The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain  
  
Then one day a man put his hand on my arm  
And said I must go west again  
I left her alone without saying goodbye  
On The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain  
  
Tonight as I sit here alone in my cell  
I know that shes waiting in vain  
Im hoping and praying someday to return  
To The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain
