Wake up stop dreaming  
The sun is in the sky again  
Theres a hole in the ocean  
And waters pouring through  
Oh wake up stop dreaming  
And wipe the sleep from your eyes  
Are you frightened of heights  
Are you falling  
Wake up stop dreaming  
Theres more than just two steps to heaven  
Im saying if you wanna get to heaven  
Youd better wake up  
Wake up stop dreaming  
Im talkin bout dream and reality  
Im talkin bout love and brutality  
And Im saying wake up wake up  
Wake up stop dreaming  
Before the shutters start to groan  
Well its something you said in the noon day sun  
But I dont recall I dont recall  
Wake up stop dreaming  
Stop this seeming half reality  
Dont turn your face away  
Look at me  
As you lie sleeping  
Someones keeping everything I knew  
Dont try to run away  
Its all new  
Wake up stop dreaming  
Theres more than just two steps to heaven  
Im saying that if you wanna get to heaven  
Youd better wake up  
Wake up stop dreaming  
Im talkin bout dream and reality  
Im talkin bout love and brutality  
And Im saying wake up  
Wake up stop dreaming  
Theres more than just two steps to heaven  
Im saying that if you wanna get to heaven  
Youd better wake up
