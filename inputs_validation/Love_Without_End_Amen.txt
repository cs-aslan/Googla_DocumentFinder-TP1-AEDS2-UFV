I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye  
Fightin was against the rules and it didnt matter why  
When dad got home I told that story just like Id rehearsed  
And then stood there on those tremblin knees and waited for the worst  
  
Chorus  
And he said let me tell you a secret about a fathers love  
A secret that my daddy said was just between us  
He said daddies dont just love their children every now and then  
Its a love without end amen its a love without end amen  
  
When I became a father in the spring of 81  
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my fathers son  
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end  
I took my daddys secret and I passed it on to him  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates  
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake  
If they know half the things Ive done theyll never let me in  
And then somewhere from the other side I heard these words again  
  
Repeat chorus
