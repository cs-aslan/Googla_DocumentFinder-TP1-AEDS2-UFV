All the sorrow and the pain  
All the sacrifice in vain  
I was much too blind to see  
You make a loser out of me  
You put me down for oh so long  
While you sang your serpents song  
  
Chorus  
The rest is history  
You can do no more to me  
Ive been down so low  
Had nowhere left to go  
I could see it in your eyes  
All your promises were lies  
Promises and lies  
  
Your cut was quick and deep  
But then you thought youd never need a friend  
But all things change and tides must turn  
And you let all your bridges burn  
Too many fatal wounds to heal  
  
Chorus
