Im a creature of the street  
And I rip off all the money  
I was kicked in the teeth  
Shoved face first through a window  
I got a gangland name  
And a teardrop tattooed eye  
They call me Little Caesar in the  
Brotherhood of crime  
I know about the pain  
Dying in an alley with an  
Airconditioned brain  
I know its for real  
Flat lined in an ambulance  
Without a pulse to feel  
  
Chorus  
Hey blood brother youre one of our own  
Youre as sharp as a razor  
And as hard as a stone  
Hey blood brother youre bad to the bone  
Youre a natural killer  
In a bad place alone  
  
They call me Smoky Joe  
And Im as thin as a coroners needle  
I got a pocket full of rocks  
Man I shake like a cold chihuahua  
I got a runny nose  
And a road map on my arm  
I blew my gig poking around the gallery  
With someone elses rig  
I know I understand  
I watch my body hauled off  
By the local garbage man  
  
Chorus  
  
Were cool were cold  
Were stiff were tagged  
Were slabbed were croaked  
Were whacked were cracked  
Were smoked and cured and  
Slammed and slurred and  
Sliced and diced and put on ice  
Cooked and stewed and badly brewed  
And splattered once or twice  
  
Hey blood brother
