Dont choose me because I am faithful  
Dont choose me because I am kind  
If your heart settles on me Im for the taking  
Take me for longing or leave me behind  
  
I would be for you a fire in a rainbow  
I would be for you an opening door  
Time and hard lessons are one kind of wisdom  
Try to forget them or love me no more  
  
Im not asking your heart to believe me  
Im not asking for promise or pledge  
Whatever the answer its yes thats the question  
I am the fool dancin over the edge  
  
Dont choose me because I am faithful  
Dont choose me because I am kind  
If your heart settles on me Im for the taking  
Take me for longing or leave me behind
