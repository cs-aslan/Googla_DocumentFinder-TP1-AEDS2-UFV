When people listen to you dont you know it means a lot  
Cause youve got to work so hard for everything youve got  
Cant rest on your laurels now  
Not when youve got none  
Youll find yourself in a gutter  
Right back where you came from  
  
Someone told me being in the know is the main thing  
We all need the security that belonging brings  
Cant stand on your own in these times  
Against all the odds  
You all just fall behind like all the other sods  
  
You slap our backs and pretend you knew about  
All the things that we were gonna do  
What ya gonna do what ya gonna do  
When its over  
  
Youre on your own now  
Dont you think thats a shame  
But youre the only one responsible to take the blame  
So what ya gonna do when the novelty has gone  
Yeah what ya gonna do when the novelty has gone  
  
You slap our backs  
And pretend you knew about  
All the things we were gonna do  
What ya gonna do what ya gonna do  
When its over
