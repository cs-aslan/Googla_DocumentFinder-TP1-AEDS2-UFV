Walter Whitman where are you  
Among the stars or in the earth beneath my shoe  
Its just cause Im wondering  
Could you walk with me a mile  
And maybe heaven could spare you awhile  
  
Walter Whitman I confess  
My faith is shaken  
And my lifes a holy mess  
Yes I need deliverance  
But Id settle for a smile  
Now maybe heaven can spare you awhile  
I thought I heard you yawpin from the yonder tree  
I swore I heard you say  
Dont worry boy shut up enjoy be free  
  
Walter Whitman I declare  
I could sing songs of joy  
Through my darkness and despair  
Its just Im hoping  
You could shed a little light  
That is if heaven can spare you tonight  
  
Dont worry boy shut up enjoy be free  
  
Walter Whitman I declare  
I could sing songs of joy  
Through my darkness and despair  
Its just Im hoping  
You could coax a problem child  
Now maybe heaven could spare you awhile  
  
Walter Whitman where are you
