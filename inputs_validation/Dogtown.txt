Okay  
  
The towns dawning Im the only one awake  
The streets are whistling I light my fourth cigarette  
I think of my friends they were once not so dead  
What are they thinking now  
  
One day Ill be just a little stone  
Nobodyll know that the stone had such emotions  
Anyway Im always on the run  
Someday Ill be remembered for the phone calls I never made  
  
Letters I never mailed  
And stories I never finished telling anyone  
  
The towns yawning I let my dog walk me around  
He took a shoot and people smiled  
I tried the same and people frowned  
Yes its a dog dogtown  
  
One day lets be a pair of trees  
Nobodyll know that the trees had such a history  
Anyway wed never be this lonely  
Someday Ill be remembered for the fine words I meant to keep  
  
A warm smile I meant to leave  
And a true song I meant to finish writing all my life  
  
Yes its a dogtown its a dogtown  
Yes its a dogtown its a dogtown  
Dog dog dog dog dog dog dog dog dogtown  
  
Peas porridge luck peas porridge stuck  
Peas porridge in the pot nine years old  
Some gets paid some gets grades  
Some stays in the pot nine years old  
  
Yes its a dogtown its a dogtown  
Yes its a dogtown its a dogtown  
Dog dog dog dog dog dog dog dog dogtown  
  
Peas porridge loved peas porridge spoiled  
Peas porridge in the pot nine years old  
Some gets laid some gets slayed  
Some stays in the pot nine years old  
  
Yes its a dogtown its a dogtown  
Yes its a dogtown its a dogtown  
Dog dog dog dog dog dog dog dog dogtown  
  
Dogtown dogtown dogtown dogtown  
Dogtown dogtown dogtown
