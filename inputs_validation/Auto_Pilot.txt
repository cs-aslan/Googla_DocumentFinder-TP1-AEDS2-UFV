Silent hell on the marble slab  
The best trip that Ive ever had  
Higher than a jet plane pass it around  
My drinks on empty need another round  
  
Chorus  
I want to fly want to ride with you  
Is this the best that you can do  
I want to fly want to ride with you  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
  
Will we arrive in the middle of nowhere  
Dont act like you know I been here so many times  
I never seen you before  
But now that I have I dont want to see you no more  
  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
  
Chorus  
  
Ahah auto pilot no control  
Ahah ah  
Ahah auto pilot no control  
Ahah ah  
  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
Higher than a jet plane with you  
  
Chorus
