Sometimes this road it just keeps winding  
Round and round and back again  
But youve always kept me smiling  
Over every hill round every bend  
Baby youre the one smiling with me when the sun comes up  
I got the wheel you got the map and thats enough  
  
And we go rolling down this highway  
Chasing all our crazy dreams  
Ive gone your way and youve gone my way  
And everywhere in between  
One of these days well find a piece of ground  
Just outside of some sleepy little town  
And set this circus down  
  
Sometimes I lie awake just thinking  
Of all the horizons we have seen  
And as another day is sinking  
I thank God youre here with me  
Cause baby youre the one laughing with me when the sun goes down  
Living on faith and holding on tight to the love we found  
  
And we go rolling down this highway  
Chasing all our crazy dreams  
Ive gone your way and youve gone my way  
And everywhere in between  
One of these days well find a piece of ground  
Just outside of some sleepy little town  
And set this circus down  
  
And set this circus down  
  
Maybe one of these days gonna set this circus down  
Set this circus down
