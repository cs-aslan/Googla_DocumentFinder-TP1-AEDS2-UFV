When I heard the sound of thunder  
On the day that I was born  
I was blinded by the lighting  
An baptised in the storm  
My father started crying  
When he saw what he had done  
But my mother started praying  
Have mercy on my son  
He is a child of Babylon  
  
I am a child of Babylon  
Lord have mercy on a wayward son  
Nowhere to hide nowhere to run  
I am a child  
A child of Babylon  
  
When Ive fooled around so many times  
When Ive known it aint been right  
But I paint it all in colours  
When it really should be black and white  
I sail my ship through muddy waters  
Try to open every door  
When I saw the seven wonders  
It left me wanting more  
  
I am a child of Babylon  
Lord have mercy on a wayward son  
Nowhere to hide got no place to run  
I am a child  
A child of Babylon  
  
On my day of judgment  
I know how it will be  
Im prepared to meet my maker  
With no hope for charity  
Ill stand alone and pay the price  
For everything Ive done  
Cause there aint guardian angel  
For a child of Babylon  
  
I am a child  
A child of Babylon  
I am a child of Babylon  
Lord have mercy on a wayward son  
Nowhere to hide got no place to run  
I am a child  
A child of Babylon  
  
Child of Babylon
