Come with me to a place of fantasy  
Ill take you on a seasaw  
Come with me to a place thats by the sea  
Ill take you on a board walk  
Take my hand Ill take you to the sand  
You and me will build a castle  
Ready set go Ill race you to the wall  
I will win I am the fastest  
  
I dont wanna grow old  
Bring me all the toys you can find  
You dont wanna grow up  
You can be my partner in crime  
  
Ill be sure to write you from the war  
Put your guns away its tea time  
Water bombs and tea towel tired mums  
Looking for a little me time  
Close your eyes and count to thirty five  
You may never ever find me  
  
Close my eyes and then I realize  
You are never far behind me  
  
I dont wanna grow old  
Bring me all the toys you can find  
You dont wanna grow up  
You can be my partner in crime  
I dont wanna grow old  
Bring me all the toys you can find  
You dont wanna grow up  
You can be my partner in crime

Will you take me by the hand  
Lets see how far we can run yeah  
Lets play chase lets put make up on our face  
You can catch me if you can  
We can make a secret place
