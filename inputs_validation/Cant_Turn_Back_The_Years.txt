  
Never gonna give it up never gonnna it up never never  
  
I could have given you everything you need  
I cannot turn back the years  
A perfect love was what you wanted from me  
But I cannot turn back the years  
  
Its important to be strong carry on  
Youve got to go forward no matter what they think  
When you find your heart in pieces one thing you can do  
And its love deep down  
Got a love deep down  
  
Its too bad I love you  
Its too bad for me  
Its too bad I love you  
Its too bad for me  
  
Sometimes it hits me in the morning  
Sometimes it hits me in the middle of the day  
Turn back the covers and I throw back the light  
But I cannot turn back the years  
  
Its important to be strong carry one  
Youve got to be full no matter what they think  
When you find yourself in pieces only one thing to do  
Let loose deep down love deep down  
  
Its too bad I loved you  
Its too bad for me  
Its too bad I loved you  
Too bad for me  
  
I could have given you everything you needed  
But I cannot turn back the years  
A perfect love was what you wanted from me  
But I cannot turn back the years  
  
Never gonna give it up never gonnna it up never never  
Oh no never gonna give it up
