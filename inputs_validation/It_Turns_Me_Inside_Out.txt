In a way Im glad its over  
Even though its gonna hurt me once youre gone  
But I can learn to live without you  
Give me time and I can make it on my own  
  
Cause lovin you to me came easy  
Now losing you will change my life no doubt  
In a way Im glad its over  
In another way it turns me inside out  
  
In a way I guess its better  
Even though theres nothing good about goodbye  
But I know I couldnt hold you  
Now youve found your wings and you need room to fly  
  
Its for sure Im gonna miss you  
But I guess thats what goodbye is all about  
In a way Im glad its over  
In another way it turns me inside out  
  
On the one hand I know Ill be better off once youre gone  
But I find a lot of heartache on the other  
And I cant say Im looking forward to those nights Ill spend alone  
And I wonder will there ever be another  
  
Cause loving you to me came easy  
Now losing you will change my life no doubt  
In a way Im glad its over  
In another way it turns me inside out  
  
In a way Im glad its over  
In another way it turns me inside out
