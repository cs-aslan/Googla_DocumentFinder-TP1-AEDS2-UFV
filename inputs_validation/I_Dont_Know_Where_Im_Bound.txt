I have to sit down for  
Ok well well do that for you just a minute thank you  
Theres a young man here at at uh San Quentin  
Tonight that wrote a song that I just  
Saw written down on paper for the first time yesterday  
He sent me the sheet music on it  
And I dont know anyone that reads music  
Except maybe Helen  
And um I liked the lyrics so much I started singing my own tune to it you
know  
The first thing that come to my mind  
Hey lemme see that lets just try a little bit of it right here  
  
I dont know where Im bound  
I dont know where Im bound  
Whistles calling me away  
Leaving at the break of day and  
And I dont know where Im bound  
  
Cant stand locks bars or doors  
Mean cops insanity and wars  
Gotta find a place of peace  
Till then much travelin wont cease  
But I dont know where Im bound  
  
Theres gotta be a place for me  
Under some green growing tree  
Clear cool water running by  
An unfettered view of the sky  
But I dont know where Im bound  
  
When I die dont bury me  
Cause then I must be free  
Cremate my body with a grin  
Throw my ashes to the wind  
Cause I dont know where Im bound  
  
I dont know where Im bound  
I dont know where Im bound  
Whistles calling me away  
Leaving at the break of day  
And I dont know where Im bound  
  
Got myself a little gal  
She has been a damn right pall  
That ol highways calling me  
And free I gotta be but  
I dont know where Im bound  
I dont know where Im bound  
I dont know where Im bound  
  
Thank you very much
