Night and day day and night  
I do my best to do things right  
Never meant to ever hurt nobody  
And if I should in some small way  
Ever rain on your parade  
I will make it up to you I promise  
  
Ever since I met that girl  
Theres no one else in the whole wide world  
Said shed stay and be with me forever  
Mysteries have long been told  
About the girl with the heart of gold  
And you know I think that I have found her  
  
Chorus  
  
Because every time she looks my way  
I lose control what can I say  
Shes everything Ive ever been after oh  
  
I found the girl with the heart of gold  
I found the girl with the heart of gold  
I found the girl with the heart of gold  
I found the girl with the heart of gold
