I cant lock my door  
Oh I dont have no privacy  
The only thing thats mine  
Is whats inside of me  
  
When Ive had enough  
A little voice inside  
It says youve got to be tough  
Youve got to take it in stride  
  
Sometimes I am foolish  
I let it get the best of me  
At least I know that my mistakes  
Are my responsibilityand  
  
I just have to laugh to keep from crying  
I just have to laugh to keep from crying  
  
I dont have a dime  
Oh to buy those pretty things  
But I hear all the evidence  
You know it all sounds the same  
  
But Im still waiting  
Ive got my hands open wide  
You know my dream isnt fading  
I keep it hidden inside  
Oh  
  
I just have to laugh to keep from crying  
I just have to laugh to keep from crying  
I keep on trying  
  
My friends dont understand  
Oh they think Ive lost my mind  
And Im choking back the tears  
Ive got to swallow my pride  
  
I just have to laugh to keep from crying  
I just have to laugh to keep from crying  
  
I just have to laugh ah  
La ah  
Lo oh  
La ah
