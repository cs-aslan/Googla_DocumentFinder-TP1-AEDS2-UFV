Been together for so long my friend  
Now you tell me that youll be going away  
So many people in so many ways  
Drawn by you in all the things youve had to say  
  
And now I know where youre going to  
Hope you find your way  
Ill say  
  
Whats forever if youre gone  
Give me the strenght to carry on  
When you see me walking by  
Ill hold my head uphigh  
And think of the times when we were young  
When our love had just begun  
Only you can stop the pain  
But our love will always remain  
  
Sit and wonder about the things weve said  
And times weve had and the games we played  
Look back now and remember the days we laughed  
The moments we cried and the love we made  
And now I know where youre going to  
Ill see you there someday  
Ill say  
  
Whats forever if youre gone  
Give me the strenght to carry on  
When you see me walking by  
Ill hold my head uphigh  
And think of the times when we were young  
When our love had just begun  
Only you can stop the pain  
But our love will always remain  
  
Every time that Id see you smile  
My whole world would be bright  
If I just had the power Id keep you a while  
Then Id know its all right  
And I know where youre going to  
Ill see you there someday  
Ill say  
  
Whats forever if youre gone  
Give me the strenght to carry on  
When you see me walking by  
Ill hold my head uphigh  
And think of the times when we were young  
When our love had just begun  
Only you can stop the pain  
But our love will always remain
