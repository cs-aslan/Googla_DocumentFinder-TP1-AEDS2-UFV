You dont want to go there  
Let me lead you by the hand  
You dont want to be there  
Over the sea and down to land  
As I look into your eyes  
  
I pay no mind  
I found the way  
To get inside you  
Id give you peace of mind  
Am I see you falling  
Am I see you falling  
Am I see you falling beautiful  
The same  
  
I dont see you falling  
I dont see you falling  
I dont see you falling beautiful  
Sometimes  
  
You dont want to go there  
Let me lead you by the hand  
You dont want to be there  
Over the sea and down to land  
As I look into your eyes  
I pay no mind  
I found the way  
To get inside you  
  
Id give you peace of mind  
Am I see you falling  
Am I see you falling  
Am I see you falling beautiful  
The same  
I dont see you falling  
I dont see you falling  
I dont see you falling beautiful  
Sometimes  
  
Here and again  
And there youre  
Falling falling falling  
Falling falling falling  
Am I see you falling  
Am I see you falling  
Am I see you falling beautiful  
The same  
  
I dont see you falling  
I dont see you falling  
I dont see you falling beautiful  
Sometimes  
  
Am I see you falling  
Am I see you falling  
Am I see you falling beautiful  
The same  
  
I dont see you falling  
I dont see you falling  
I dont see you falling beautiful  
Sometimes  
  
Falling falling free  
I dont see you falling  
I dont see you falling  
Corrupt a plea for free will  
An irresponsible harass show  
It has been suggested  
That this is contradictory
