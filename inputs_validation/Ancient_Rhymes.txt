Two days before the moon was round  
You felt the urge of suns light beams  
The muffled world of dolphin sound  
Slipped down and back into your dreams  
  
For nine full months that passed before  
You learned of all of lifes ancient rhymes  
Then mother sensed a farther shore  
And brought you forth into these times  
  
So taste the air of your new world  
And gently guide us to your mind  
It knows the winds and sails unfurled  
And holds to heart the dolphin kind  
  
Welcome precious earth made child  
We met you first in your fathers songs  
And mothers smile and waters wild  
Its in this place you now belong  
  
I know you know of all these things  
And feel the faith of a dolphins sigh  
For you were born on silver wings  
To taste the high blown crystal sky  
  
To sing one day to all of us  
The songs you learned in dolphin lair  
Giving hope to life as all we must  
And teach us how their grace to share
