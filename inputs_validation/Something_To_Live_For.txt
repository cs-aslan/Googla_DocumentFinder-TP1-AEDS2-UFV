I have almost evry thing a human could desire  
Cars and houses bearskin rugs to lie before my fire  
But theres something missing  
Something isnt there  
It seems Im never kissing the one whom I care for  
I want Something To Live For  
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream  
Oh what wouldnt I give for  
Someone whod take my life  
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be  
Why cant I have love like that brought to me  
My eye is watching the noon crowds  
Searching the promenades seeking a clue  
To the one who will someday be my  
Something To Live For  
I want Something To Live For  
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream  
Oh what woulnt I give for  
Someone whod take my life  
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be  
Why cant I have love like that brought to me  
My eye is watching the noon crowds  
Searching the promenades seeking a clue  
To the one who will someday be my Something To Live For
