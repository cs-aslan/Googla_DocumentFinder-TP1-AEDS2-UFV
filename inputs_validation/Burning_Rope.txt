The warming sun the cooling rain  
The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze  
The lightning bolt that clears the sky for you  
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through  
The words of love the cries of hate  
And the man in the moon who seduced you  
Then finally loosed you  
  
You climbed upon a burning rope to escape the mob below  
But you had put the flaming out so that others could now follow  
To be out of the bounds and the barks of those who do not wish you well  
  
You must blaze a trail of your own unknown alone  
But keep in mind  
Dont live today for tomorrow like you were immortal  
The only survivors on this world of ours are  
  
The warming sun the cooling rain  
The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze  
The lightning bolt that clears the sky for you  
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through  
The words of love the cries of hate  
And the man in the moon who seduced you  
Then finally loosed you  
  
Youre old and disillusioned now as you realise at last  
That all you have accomplished here will have soon all turned to dust  
You dream of a future after life well thats as maybe I dont know  
  
But you cant take what you left behind youre all alone  
So keep in mind  
Dont live today for tomorrow like you were immortal  
The only survivors on this world of ours are  
  
The warming sun the cooling rain  
The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze  
The lightning bolt that clears the sky for you  
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through  
The words of love the cries of hate  
And the man in the moon who seduced you  
Then finally loosed you
