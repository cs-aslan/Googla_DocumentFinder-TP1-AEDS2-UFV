There are times when I feel like nothings been achieved  
Torn by indecision its not hard to believe it  
That all of our hopes and all of our dreams  
Wrapped up in chains just waiting to be free  
I got to tell you all about it  
  
Man killing man and words are afar  
So many dreams and Im dark  
Close all the windows and lock all the doors  
Deceiving your friends and using us all  
I got to tell you doo doo doo yeah  
  
There are times when I feel like nothings been achieved  
Torn by indecision its not hard to believe it  
That all of our hopes and all of our dreams  
Wrapped up in chains just waiting to be free  
I got to tell you doo doo doo  
All you do doo doo  
Wouldnt that be friends   
I love you like I do  
I try to tell you doo doo doo  
Doo doo loo loo
