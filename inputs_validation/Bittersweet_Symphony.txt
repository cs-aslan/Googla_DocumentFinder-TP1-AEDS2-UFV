Cause its a bittersweet symphony this life  
Trying to make ends meet youre a slave to the money then you die  
Ill take you down the only road Ive ever been down  
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet yeah  
No change I cant change I cant change I cant change  
But Im here in my mold I am here in my mold  
But Im a million different people from one day to the next  
I cant change my mold no no no no no no no  
  
Well I never pray  
But tonight Im on my knees yeah  
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me yeah  
I let the melody shine let it cleanse my mind I feel free now  
But the airwaves are clean and theres nobody singing to me now  
  
No change I cant change I cant change I cant change  
But Im here in my mold I am here in my mold  
And Im a million different people from one day to the next  
I cant change my mold no no no no no no no  
  
Well have you ever been down  
I cant change I cant change  
  
Cause its a bittersweet symphony this life  
Trying to make ends meet trying to find some money then you die  
You know I cant change I cant change I cant change  
But Im here in my mold I am here in my mold  
And Im a million different people from one day to the next  
I cant change my mold no no no no no no no  
  
Ill take you down the only road Ive ever been down  
Ill take you down the only road Ive ever been down  
Its just sex and violence melody and silence  
Been down  
Ever been down  
Ever been down
