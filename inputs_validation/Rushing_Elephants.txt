Intro Raekwon  
Yo yo yo what up kid Yo these niggaz is back son  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Im telling you spit that done it nigga  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah I seen it like a Zenith man  
You hear me man Word up man yall know what it is  
Its on again man for real Top Gun what what  
  
Raekwon  
Aiyo we came through thumping like elephants  
The new Range is supercharged I remains intelligent  
Back to the formula lord hard grammar  
This is God school make sure the lobby aint jammed up  
Excalibur swords TRexes bibles of rhymes  
We in the lunchroom weed and veggies for breakfast  
Polo campus sicker lances the crisp  
Hundred dollar kick niggas that be showing you hand steps  
Back to the dormatory where niggas  
Broke my forearm and index finger now you write glory  
True holding my flag its all engraved in my blade  
So when I wave it you gon say Rae mad  
Now its 28 Days Later now Wus up do something you cant  
Its blood in my eye I might get amped  
To rip something down the billboard holders is back  
So when you see me you gon say he gets down  
  
GZA  
From darkness to DNA I move with my brother  
And we resonate energy that shifts in colors  
Bringing MCs punishment then Im done with it  
The meter leave way on the fast break I run with it  
It was not a hobby but a childhood passion  
That had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned  
Every line to line bar for bar is clockwork  
Hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt  
Check the total amount of MCs inflicted  
With torture from moving with work thats restricted  
We criticize producers til they joints are right  
Then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light  
Hitting them from well conceiled firing positions  
With explosiveness thatll make the deaf listen  
Drastic pyroclastic connected with the same old  
Down the dangerous slopes of an active volcano  
  
RZA  
Blitz like the Green Bay Packers sack like the linebackers  
Hang with niggas like redneck crackers  
Strangle cold bottles of Becks like a vexed German  
Duck low behind the car my tech burning  
Neck burning from eight karats of sunlight  
Absorbed in the grill Big Pun like  
Lord of the WuTang sword know what that means  
Like JR Tolkien its the Lord of the Rings  
This is my man Chef auto like Grand Theft Auto  
The 18th letter followed by the mark of Zorro  
Plus A not for apple but I pack an apple  
Shorty try to buck back and knock me off the saddle  
Caramel pecan sundae Pregline  
Plump breasts was filled with saline  
Her big booty cousin nasty Nadine  
Get you on the floor whore tried to double team  
  
Masta Killa  
Is he still that nucca Is he in the hood like that  
Is he really strapped Will he really split yo shit  
I thought you said he rap Pull up in the yard ten sets  
He aint flexing microphone ripping heat holding  
Who testing Ropeadope his black lotus  
Cant quote this chat with the sword tongue  
Duck when the axe is swinging wild Apache drum  
Crazy Horse kicking his thoughts he wont quit  
Cant tell em nothing he grown give the man room  
Space was demanded beat banging through the speaker  
Voice heat seek missle guided at the listener  
Swing to the gospel catch up and wet at the brothel  
Unstoppable direction of my flow optional  
To the ear depending on the current of air the crowds in
