Skin to bone steel to rust  
Ash to ashes dust to dust  
Will tomorrow have its way  
With the promises we made  
Skin to bone steel to rust  
  
Ash to ashes dust to dust  
Your deception my disgust  
When your name is finally drawn  
Ill be happy that youre gone  
Ash to ashes dust to dust  
  
Chorus  
Aah Ash to ashes dust to dust  
Aah Skin to bone and steel to rust  
  
Right to left left to right  
Night to day and day to night  
As the starlight fades to gray  
Ill be watching far away  
Right to left and left to right  
  
Chorus  
  
Will tomorrow have its way  
With the promises betrayed  
Skin to bone and steel to rust  
Skin to bone and steel to rust  
Skin to bone and steel to rust
