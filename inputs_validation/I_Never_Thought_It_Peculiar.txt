I never thought it peculiar  
That you never gave me a smile  
I wasnt socially suited  
To make it worth your while  
  
Oh no and I never thought it peculiar  
That my heart always beat like a drum  
Each time I would see you walk by me  
You were as pretty as they come  
  
So I sent some flowers to your doorstep  
And wrote on the card I love you  
I dont know why but I do know that I  
Had a feeling that you liked me too  
  
So I never thought it peculiar  
When you stopped to ask me the time  
And I dont think its terribly peculiar  
That now little girl you are mine  
  
So I sent some flowers to your doorstep  
And wrote on the card I love you  
I dont know why but I do know that I  
Had a feeling that you liked me too  
  
So I never thought it peculiar  
When you stopped to ask me the time  
And I dont think its terribly peculiar  
That now little girl you are mine  
That now little girl you are mine  
That now little girl you are mine
