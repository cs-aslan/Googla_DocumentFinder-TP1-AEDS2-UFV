Sometimes I think Im gonna drown  
Cause everyone arounds so hollow  
Im alone  
Sometimes I think Im going down  
  
But no one makes a sound  
They follow  
And Im alone  
Yeah if I make it Id be amazed  
  
Just to find tomorrow  
One more day and Id be amazed  
Just to see it waiting  
And if I make it Im still alone  
  
No more hope for better days  
But if I could change  
Then Id really be amazed  
And when you know you cant relate  
  
To one more shiny face  
Your heart breaks  
No one cares  
And when you know you cant go on  
  
Cause everything is wrong  
Your heart breaks  
But no ones there
