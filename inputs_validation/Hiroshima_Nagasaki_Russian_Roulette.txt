They dropped the bomb in 45 to end the world war  
Noone had ever seen such a terrible sight before  
The world looked on with eyes wide to see where it  
Might lead  
The politics of power they passed around their seed  
It was a time to remember we never can forget  
They were playin Hiroshima Nagasaki Russian  
Roulette  
  
They arose like the saviours of our modern human race  
With radiation haloes that hung about their face  
With the key to the surecure the treatment of our  
Ills  
A hotshot of cobalt and a pocketfull of pills  
Speaking always of the enemy who lurked across the  
Sea  
While they crept in among us like a carrier disease  
  
Deep down inside the bunkers of the concrete and the  
Lead  
Einsteins disciples working steadily ahead  
Making heavy metal powerplants to fire the city  
Lights  
All you can hear in the underground is the humming  
Through the night  
And the walls of tight security circle all around  
Where they spill out their poison and bury it in the  
Ground  
  
Holed up in the harbours hidden secretly away  
  
Warheads and submarines await to make their play  
The military masterminds improve on their design  
The soldiers get all doped up and stumble through the  
Lines  
While the spills into the rivers get carried out by the  
Tide  
They call this security but were not satisfied  
  
Our statesmen and leaders and politicians pay  
Quick to heed the hand that feeds theyre careful what  
They say  
They call out experts to assure us to wave their magic  
Wands  
This is the power of the future And the future marches  
On  
And they call in their favours all their political  
Gains  
While the spills fill the rivers and settle in the  
Plains  
  
I know the minds behind them they are riddled full of  
Holes  
Not to be trusted with their hands at the controls  
Their eyesight it is twisted by the glory of their  
Careers  
The heaped praise and flattery is music to their ears  
To listen to them talk about how it hasnt happened  
Yets  
Like playing Hiroshima Nagasaki Russian Roulette
