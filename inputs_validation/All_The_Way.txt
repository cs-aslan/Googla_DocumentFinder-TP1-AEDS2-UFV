Feedback blasting out my ears  
Makes me so high  
I love all the monitor men  
But why are they alive  
The van is making me crazy  
Its just like being in the navy  
  
Doomsday doomsdays coming  1981  
But until things blow  
Im gonna have some fun  
The bubbles going to explode  
Probably never live to get old  
  
Chorus  
But I just want to have some fun  
Probably wont see no money  
I just want to have some fun  
Before they throw me in the sanitarium  
  
Feedback blasting out my ears  
Makes me so high  
I love all the monitor men  
But why are they alive  
Well Montes making me crazy  
Its just like being in the navy  
  
Chorus
