Lifes filled with many paths  
Which one should I take   
When the choice comes I wont run  
Ill be thinking straight   
Lifes filled with conflicts well face  
Well overcom them thinking straight   
Experiment with your mind  
You see things I cant see  
Well no thanks friend  
Because now it ends when you push that shit on me  
My mind is free to think and see  
Strong enough to resist temptation  
Weve been strong for all these years  
Yes life gets rough so well stand tough and confront  
All our fears
