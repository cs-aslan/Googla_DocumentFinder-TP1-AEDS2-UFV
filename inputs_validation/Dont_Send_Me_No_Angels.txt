When the storm clouds gather and Im losing my mind  
She stands right beside me she lights up my day  
Shes the one thing I found in a world thats gone wrong  
Shes the words and the music to the worlds finest song  
  
Chorus  
Lord let me keep her at least for a while  
I promise Ill love her till Ive walked my last mile  
When your trumpets are sounding and youve played my song  
Dont send me no angels cause Ive got my own  
  
She stayed with me through the hard times thats still goin on  
That old feeling between us its still coming on strong  
When my eyes close forever and my last breath is gone  
Dont send me no angels cause Ive got my own  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont send me no angels cause Ive got my own
