You say youve got everything you want  
And your bird can sing  
But you dont get me  
You dont get me  
  
You say youve seen the seven wonders  
And you bird is green  
But you cant see me  
You cant see me  
  
When your prized possessions  
Start to weigh you down  
Look in my direction  
Ill be round Ill be round  
  
When your bird is broken  
Will it bring you down  
You may be awoken  
Ill be round Ill be round  
  
You tell me that youve heard every sound there is  
And your bird can swing  
But you cant hear me  
You cant hear me
