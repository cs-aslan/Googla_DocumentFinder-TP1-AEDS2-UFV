Somehow I know that  
Theres a place up above  
With no more hurt and struggling  
Free of all atrocities and suffering  
Because I feel the unconditional love  
From one who cares enough for me  
To erase all my burdens  
And let me be free to  
  
Chorus  
Fly like a bird  
Take to the sky  
I need you now Lord  
Carry me high  
Dont let the world break me tonight  
I need the strength of you by my side  
Sometimes this life can be so cold  
I pray youll come and carry me home  
  
Can we recover  
Will the world ever be  
A place of peace and harmony  
With no war and with no brutality  
If we loved each other  
We would find victory  
But in this harsh reality  
Sometimes Im so despondent  
That I feel the need to  
  
Chorus  
  
Keep your head to the sky  
With Gods love youll survive  
Fly like a bird  
Take to the sky  
I need you now Lord  
Carry me high  
Dont let the world break me tonight  
I need the strength of You by my side  
  
Sometimes this life can be so cold  
I pray Youll come and carry me home  
Carry me higher higher higher  
Carry me higher higher higher  
Carry me home  
Higher Jesus  
Carry me higher Lord
