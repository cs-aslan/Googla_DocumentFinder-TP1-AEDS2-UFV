Come my way oh I say before you go  
Tie my laces and chain me sound below  
Hold my side God must be feeling so cold  
Its all my deepest I see them there they go  
  
Free my name just give me love  
Free my name just give me loving now  
  
Ill give my days report and send you them intact  
Its just like yesterday but now Im screaming tired  
And now youre really saying this house is not my home  
So if you wake me I will not sleep alone  
  
Free my name just give me love  
Free my name just give me love  
Free my name just give me loving now  
  
Come my way oh I say before you go  
Tie my laces and chain me sound below  
Hold my side God must be feeling so cold  
Its all my deepest I see them there they go
