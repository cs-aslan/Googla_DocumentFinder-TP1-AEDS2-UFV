Through waters uncharted my soul will embark  
Ill follow Your voice straight into the dark  
And if from the course You intend I depart  
Speak to the sails of my wandering heart  
  
Chorus  
Like the wind Youll guide  
Clear the skies before me  
And Ill glide this open sea  
Like the stars Your Word  
Will align my voyage  
And remind me where Ive been  
And where I am going  
  
Lost in the shallows amidst fear and fog  
Your truth is the compass  
That points me back north  
Jesus my Captain  
My souls trusted Lord  
All my allegiance is rightfully Yours  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus  
  
Jesus my Captain  
My souls trusted Lord  
All my allegiance is rightfully Yours
