Captain America is that you  
Flying down the highway  
In your red white and blue  
  
You remind me of the days  
In that infamous war  
When we werent quite sure  
What we were fighting for  
  
I see you again and it makes me think  
About just who I am  
Is there someone in charge  
Who can lead the way tonight  
Who knows the plan  
  
Where theres love  
There is grace  
Theres still hope left in this place  
And the smile on your face  
Gives me faith in the human race  
  
Captain America what do you see  
Millions of your brothers say theyll fight to be free  
Who could have known you would be the chosen one  
To kick start our dreams  
The cycle of life goes around and round again  
Tell me what does it mean  
Can it be true  
  
Where theres love  
There is grace  
And theres hope left in this place  
And the smile on your face  
Gives me faith in the human  
  
If we could trade all of our tomorrows  
For the best of our yesterdays  
Erase all the pain and the sorrow  
Would there have to be a high price to pay  
Hey Hey  
  
We run for our lives  
And were searching for shelter now  
From the coming storm  
Are you the man who can lead us once again  
So come on suit up lets go  
  
Where theres love  
There is grace  
And theres hope left in this place  
And the smile on your face  
Theres not a damn thing we cant face  
  
Where theres love  
There is grace  
And theres hope left in this place  
And the smile on your face  
Gives me faith in the human  
Faith in the human race  
Yeah I got faith
