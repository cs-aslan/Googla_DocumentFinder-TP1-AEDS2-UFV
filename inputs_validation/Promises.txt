Well dont you know I need a  
Little indulgence  
Listen to the hunter becoming  
Hunted  
Everyday theres a million advances  
Dont be too forceful youll ruin  
Your chances  
Well dont you know that time is a  
Broken glass  
That splinters against the wall  
But the picture is coming back  
Now baby  
And I want to take it all  
  
Dont go making all these promises  
You know you cannot keep  
Theres a time to play a king and a  
Time to be a thief  
Cause if youre making all these  
Promises you know you cannot keep  
You know time will be the thief and  
Your fallen king end up alone  
  
So let your body move a little bit closer  
Silent like the sound proceeding a cyclone  
Dont you know that powerful thinking  
Can be a force you dont want  
To relinquish  
Well dont you know that  
They say hanging on will justify the wait  
But patience and elated wisdom  
Dont share a common phrase  
  
Dont go making all these promises  
You know you cannot keep  
Theres a time to play a king and a  
Time to be a thief  
Cause if youre making all these  
Promises you know you cannot keep  
You know time will be the thief and  
Your fallen king end up alone  
  
Well Im only hanging on for what  
Goes down  
Im floating high and my feet dont  
Touch the ground  
Id take advantage but I cant see  
Through this charade  
So dont you dont go make it harder  
That hell  
Cause it comes down to the making  
Youd better be damned sure you can  
Take it  
Hey baby  
  
Dont go making all these promises  
You know you cannot keep  
Theres a time to play a king and a  
Time to be a thief  
Cause if youre making all these  
Promises you know you cannot keep  
You know time will be the thief and  
Your fallen king end up alone  
  
Time will be the thief  
And your fallen king will end up  
A fool a fool a lonely sorry fool  
Oh baby cause I told you baby
