There would be psalms sung by a choir  
I would have a white robe a halo newly acquired  
Id be at peace and Id have no desire  
If Id lived right  
  
There would be cherubs with tiny harps arrows and bows  
Id have a halo and a flowing white robe  
Id be enfolded by a celestial light  
If Id lived right  
  
But Im feeling hot and bothered under the collar  
I feel the sweat breaking out on my brow  
I feel the heat and I know its the passion  
The love I cant disavow  
  
If this is a dream wake me up now  
If this is a movie lets edit these scenes out  
It would be a PG instead of an Xrated life  
If Id lived right  
  
Some would call me a cheat call me a liar  
Say that Ive been defeated by the basest desired  
Yes I have strayed and succumbed to my vices  
But I tried to live right  
  
But I have no regrets no guilt in my heart  
I only feel sadness for any pain that Ive caused  
I guess I wouldnt bother to worry at all  
If Id lived right  
  
Do you live by the book do you play by the rules  
Do you care what is thought by others about you  
If this day is all that is promised to you  
Do you life for the future the present the past  
  
If there is one thing I know I know I will die  
If anyone cares some stranger my critique my life  
I may be revered or defamed and decried  
But I tried to live right  
  
There would be psalms sung by a choir  
I would have a white robe a halo newly acquired  
Id be at peace and Id have no desire  
If Id lived right
