The dream police  
Slogan what is on your mind  
The airwave boys  
Junkies wont get radio time  
The purist league  
White trenchcoats in prewar style  
The aging queens  
Mister wont you stay a while  
  
In death row with harlow  
And others like you  
I point my finger of hate  
At your picture and love you and love you  
The radio is talking  
Is it you or me  
I must admit  
Its far too late to dial police  
  
What is your name  
We are the end of the line  
Her eyes went out  
Dreaming overdose on time  
Hey you old grey eyes  
Dont practice dying for real  
The only one  
September she knows I can feel
