Damn this situations new to me why  
I see a head afraid to be himself  
I bet hed to have a little  
Encouragement from the opposite  
Come that side of the floor Yes  
  
Egg him along make him feel at ease with himself  
Steal his clothes leave him his shoes  
Lets get this marmaduke naked  
Makehim feel at ease  
Lets get this maraduke naked  
So lose your head and go to pieces  
  
Dont you make fun of me  
Dont you make fun of me  
Im gonna be gonna be  
Im gonna be a hot dancer  
Oh now that the basics are down  
Converse amongst yourselves  
  
But keep an eye out for the next complication  
In other words  
Grab the next motherfucker marmaduke  
Who refuses to submit to these pelvic ostentations  
I cant wait until the syllables bend  
Lets get this marmaduke naked  
Lets get this marmaduke naked  
So lose your head and go to pieces  
  
Dont you make fun of me  
Dont you make fun of me  
Im gonna be  
Gonna be  
Im gonna be a hot dancer
