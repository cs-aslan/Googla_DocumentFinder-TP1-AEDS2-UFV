A dodooooo A dodooooo  
I saw the splendor of the moonlight on Honolulu Bay  
Theres something tender in the moonlight on Honolulu Bay  
And all the beaches are full of peaches  
Who bring their ukes along  
And in the glimmer of the moonlight  
They love to sing this song  
  
If you like a ukulele lady  
Ukulele lady like a you  
If you want to linger where its shady  
Ukulele lady linger too  
If you kiss a ukulele lady  
While you promise ever to be true  
And she see another ukulele lady fool around with you  
Maybe shell sigh maybe shell cry  
Maybe shell find somebody else  
By and bywhywhy  
To sing to when its cool and shady  
Where the tricky wicky wackies woo woo woo  
If you like a ukulele lady  
Ukulele lady like a you  
  
Someday Im goin  
Where eyes are glowin  
And lips were made to kiss  
To see somebody in the moonlight  
And hear the songs I missed  
  
If you like a ukulele lady  
Ukulele lady like a you you you  
If you want to linger where its shady  
Ukulele lady linger too  
If you kiss a ukulele lady  
While you promise ever to be true true true  
And she see another ukulele lady fool around with you  
Well maybe she will sigh maybe she will cry  
Aah but maybe she will find somebody else  
By and bywhywhy  
To sing to when its cool and shady  
Where the tricky wicky wackies woo woo woo  
If you like a ukulele lady  
Ukulele lady like a you like a me like I like a you  
We like a both the same  
Id like to say this very day  
Ukulele lady like a youooooooo
