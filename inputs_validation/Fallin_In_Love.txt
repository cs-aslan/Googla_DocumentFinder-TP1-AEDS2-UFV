My doctor says I need no cure this  
Time That everythings alright and I  
Am fine but my friends dont agree  
They say Im not the one I used to  
Be And it makes me wonder wonder  
Wonder Why Im smiling all the time  
The only thing I have inside my mind  
Is a picture of you And its there no  
Matter what I do No matter what I  
Do not know  
  
I dont know what it is but I think Im  
Falling in love I dont know what it is  
But when I close my eyes Youre the  
One Im dreaming of I dont know  
What it is but Im floating in the sky  
I dont know what it is and I sure  
Dont know how But you filled  
My heart with butterflies Im falling in  
Love  
  
Seems like all my problems went  
Away I start to make the most of  
Everyday So I spend them with you  
No one makes me feel the way you  
Do And it makes me wonder wonder  
Wonder about the pain I get inside  
Everytime youre not by my side  
You have opened a door  
I have never felt this way before  
And I want more I dont know  
  
I dont know what it is  
  
When we are walking I get to hold  
Your hand And that is making me  
Proud Im screaming out loud  
I I am a happy man  
  
And when we are looking up on a  
Clear blue shy You give me a kiss I  
Wonder who is THIS LUCKY GUY
