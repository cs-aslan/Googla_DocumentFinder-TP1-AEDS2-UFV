Chorus  
You better turn me loose  
Turn me loose you know that I cant stay  
You better turn me loose  
Well turn me loose you know Ill make it anyway  
  
Well why dont you tell me  
Just whats goin on  
Both of us lyin here  
And we both know its wrong  
So why dont you let me  
Why dont you leave it alone  
And dont keep hangin on to a love thats dead and gone  
  
Chorus  
  
Well you cant see its over  
Thats really a shame  
Well our love didnt make it  
No ones to blame  
So why dont we say goodbye  
Why dont we just say were through  
And Ill be on my way  
And Ill get by without you  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Turn me loose you know Ill make it anyway
