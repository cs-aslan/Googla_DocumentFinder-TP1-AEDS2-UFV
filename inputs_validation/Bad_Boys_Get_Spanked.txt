Youre not supposed to do that  
You know youre not allowed to  
But you seem to get some kind of kick  
Out of doing what youre not allowed to  
You deliberately defy the rules  
Cause the laws upheld by fools  
Shit on that  
Bad boys get spanked  
  
You can look but dont touch  
But no you cant resist  
Dont you ever think about the consequence  
Guys like you never do  
Thats the kind of stuff boys are made out of  
Thats the kind of stuff girls are made out of  
Bad boys get spanked  
Bad boys get spanked  
  
You dont listen do you asshole  
Dont be a punk all your life  
Someones gonna sort you out  
Theyll try to make a man out of you  
Say yes sir say no sir  
Say yes maam say no mam  
Shit on that  
Bad boys get spanked  
Bad boys get spanked  
  
Get spanked get spanked  
Come here get spanked  
Bad boys get spanked  
Come here get spanked
