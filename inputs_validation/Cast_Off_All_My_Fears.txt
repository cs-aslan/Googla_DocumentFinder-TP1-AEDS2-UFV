Ones I was on my one and falling  
Ones I was all alone and calling  
For some one anyone to day  
To help me just a little on my way  
And then I took a look around  
I saw all that love that surrounded me  
I know that it was all up to me and  
Cast off all my fears that bound me  
Cast off all my fears that bound me  
  
You find you cant go on depending  
Always to help your in deep ending  
Your reason for being whom you are  
And asking for that lightest brightest star  
I thought thats all I had to do  
Was believing the things that was true to me  
And let it happen naturally  
And cast off all my fears that bound me  
Cast off all my fears that bound me  
  
I thought thats all I had to do  
Was believing the things that was true to me  
And let it happen naturally  
And cast off all my fears that bound me  
Cast off all my fears that bound me  
Cast off all my fears that bound me
