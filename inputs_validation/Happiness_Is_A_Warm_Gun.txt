DR EDISON AMOS  
The second amendment gives the right of the people to keep and bear arms  
This is a dispute which is going on in America now  
We should work diligently to keep this second amendment in place  
For any individual with responsibility  
Let me repeat again responsibility and boundaries of those who are
priviledged  
To be a part of all of these twentyseven amendments  
Of the Constitution of the United States of America  
Plus the Declaration of Independence  
  
GEORGE W BUSH  
I believe that uh people who are gonna commit crimes shouldnt have guns

My heart goes out to the people to the victims  
Because I dont understand how kids can be out there theyre out making

And and uh and uh families being totally unaware of it  
With this culture going on And Im as troubled by it as anybody else  
And I dont know any answers
