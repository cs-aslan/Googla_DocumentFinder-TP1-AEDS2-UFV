I wish my heart could talk to you like I do every night  
When were apart you know its true I love you every night  
Youd come running back and never leave me feelin blue  
If my heart if my heart could talk heart could talk  
To you heart could talk to you  
  
Ya know honey whenever youre close enough to me  
To reach out and kiss my fingertips  
Then what Im really feelin deep down in my heart  
Always fails to leave my lips  
Cause I plan on all the things that my heart wants to say  
And then I think Im all set for the next time I see you walk my way  
But it just seems that every time you do I only make a standing start  
And then darlin youre gone yes youre gone again  
Before these words can ever leave my heart  
  
If my heart could talk to you youd never go away  
If my heart could talk to you forever you would stay  
Youd come running back and never leave me feelin blue  
If my heart if my heart could talk heart could talk  
To you if my heart could talk to you
