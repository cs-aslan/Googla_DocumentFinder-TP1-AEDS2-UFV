Why dont you come clean baby  
I know what youre goin through  
You must think Im some kind of crazy  
Well honey Im just worried bout you  
  
You look so much like your mama  
And Im sorry for you that shes gone  
And if she was here she sould tell ya  
Dont lose sight of whats right or whats wrong  
  
Cause you aint foolin nobody  
Cause baby the talk gets around  
You aint foolin nobody  
Cause youre lovin in this one horse town  
  
Well I hope your conscience is listening  
When youre out runnin at night  
All it takes is one bad decision  
To haunt you the rest of your life  
  
Cause you aint foolin nobody  
Cause baby the talk gets around  
You aint foolin nobody  
Cause youre lovin in this one horse town  
  
Cause you aint foolin nobody  
Cause baby the talk gets around  
You aint foolin nobody  
Cause youre lovin in this one horse town
