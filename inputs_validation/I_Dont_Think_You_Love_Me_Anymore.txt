You dont smile like you used to smile  
You dont laugh like you used to laugh  
Youre trying to pretend but what for  
I dont think you love me anymore  
  
You dont kiss like you kissed me before  
The spark of love isnt there anymore  
I love you everyday but what for  
I dont think you love me anymore  
  
Made a fool of me youre mean to me  
Its plain to see you dont love me anymore  
  
Your loving touch isnt there anymore  
You dont care like you cared before  
So darling what am I waiting for  
I dont think you love me anymore  
  
Made a fool of me youre mean to me  
And its plain to see you dont love me anymore  
Made a fool of me youre mean to me  
And its plain to see you dont love me anymore  
Made a fool of me youre mean to me
