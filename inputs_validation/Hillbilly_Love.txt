When a cowboy loves a cowgirl  
They attract together  
But when a forcefield breaks them apart  
They wont survive forever  
Its like Its over Were done Forget about me  
Its like My first boy friend already dumped me  
  
Thats hillbilly love  
Thats country you see  
Lets pretend that couple  
Was You and Me  
But then we broke up  
Its not pretty like a dove  
And thats hillbilly love  
  
At our first wedding  
You took the flowers from the vase  
You hit me with those flowers  
And I hit you with your case  
Its like I dont Its over I was wrong  
The relationship is why Im writing this song  
  
Thats hillbilly love  
Thats country you see  
Lets pretend that couple  
Was You and Me  
But then we broke up  
Its not pretty like a dove  
  
Hillbilly love  
Its a country thing  
When I write a song for you  
I gotta sing  
But when we break up  
Its not pretty like a dove  
And thats hillbilly love  
  
Its like I dont wanna be with you  
Its like Were done and over this time  
Its like We dont have nothing in common  
Its like Uh I ran out of rhymes  
  
Thats hillbilly love  
Thats country you see  
Lets pretend that couple  
Was You and Me  
But then we broke up  
Its not pretty like a dove  
  
Hillbilly love  
Its a country thing  
When I write a song for you  
I gotta sing  
But when we break up  
Its not pretty like a dove  
And thats hillbilly love  
Hillbilly Love  
Hillbilly Love
