Summertimeand the livin is easy  
Fish are jumpinand the cotton is high  
Yo daddys richand yo mamas goodlookin  
So hush little babydont you cry  
  
One of these morninsyou gonna rise up singin  
You gonna spread your little wingsand youll take to the sky  
But till that morninthere aint nothin gonna harm you  
With yo mama and daddystandin bye  
  
Now its summertimeand the livin is easy  
Them fish are jumpinand the cottons bout waist high  
Yo daddys richand ya know yo mamas goodlookin  
Now hush little babydontyou cry  
  
Summertime  
Ah said its summertime
