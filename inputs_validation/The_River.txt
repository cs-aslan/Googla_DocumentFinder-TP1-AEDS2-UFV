I live by the river  
And I hide my house away  
Then just like the river  
I can change my ways  
Oh if you come to love me  
You would stay forever  
Inside my heart  
Inside my dreams  
And time will fade  
In time well love  
  
In the street we walk as beggars  
In the alley faithless kings  
Ah but its the truth of life  
That chains us in between  
Those lost moments we steal  
To keep our love alive  
And our prize so tired after all the pain  
And time will fade  
In time well love
