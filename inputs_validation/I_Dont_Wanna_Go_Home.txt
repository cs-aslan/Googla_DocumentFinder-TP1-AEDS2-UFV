Go back home you damn fool  
Surely you know you cant win  
You shouldve never have come near this place  
You should have stayed outside  
Lookin up  
Its too late to turn back  
Nobody asked you to try  
But they blinded you with diamonds  
And all the money that money can buy  
And Im so afraid of being on my own  
But I dont wanna go home  
You cant win you damn fool  
You drank all the wine from the cup  
And your painted ladys gone now  
And youre way back on the downside  
Lookin up  
You cant catch the monkey on your back  
Nobody asked you to try  
But for every heart they held a spade  
And you lost more than money can buy  
And Im so afraid of being on my own  
But I dont wanna go home  
Im like a washed up rag tattered and torn yeah  
I wish Id never been born  
And Im so afraid of being on my own  
But I dont wanna go home  
Im like a down and out just blowin my horn  
Oh I dont wanna go home  
Im like a washed up rag tattered and torn  
Oh I dont wanna go home yeah
