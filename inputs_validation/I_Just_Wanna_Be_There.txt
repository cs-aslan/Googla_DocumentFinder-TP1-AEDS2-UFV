Now when the storm of life is rushing in on you  
And all hope is gone  
And you feel the pain and misery of  
Being left all alone  
After youve tried so hard and your life  
Is standing still  
And you think you just dont have the  
Strength to climb another hill  
  
Oh I just want to be there  
I just want to be there  
Just to hold you close  
Said I want to be there  
I just want to be there  
Cause I love you most  
  
When you need a little understanding from  
Your socalled friends  
And you find the road youre travelling down is  
Coming do a deadend  
When suddenly you find yourself lost and  
Stumbling through the night  
Now let me be the hand in the dark thats leading  
You to the light  
  
Oh I just want to be there  
I just want to be there  
Just to hold you close  
Said I want to be there  
I just want to be there  
Cause I love you most  
Ooh ooh I want to be there  
Baby baby baby baby I want to be there yeah  
want to be there  
Said I want to be there  
I just want to be there  
Cause I love you most  
  
Promise not to ever try to change you  
I love you for yourself  
No matter what you choose to be your fate  
Now let me be your helpmate  
Let me be the main source of power that  
Makes your wheels turn  
And let me be the wood in the furnace to make  
Your fire burn  
  
Yeah I just want to be there  
Just to hold you close  
Said I want to be there  
Cause I love you most  
Ooh hey I want to be there  
Said I want to be there  
Cause I love you most  
Said I want to be want to be want to be there yeah  
Cause I love you most
