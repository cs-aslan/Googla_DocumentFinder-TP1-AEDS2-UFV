This is a story full of restless nights  
Of do or do not cause there is no try  
Across a decade we flew high and we fell low  
And getting up when were dragged down is all weve known  
  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what weve done  
And theres a fire inside  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what weve done  
And theres a fire inside  
It burns like the surface of the sun  
  
Here in this Angel City lights will shine  
Lights will shine  
And for a while we let ourselves go blind  
But now we know who loves and loves us not  
And theyre worth every good thing we have lost  
  
Ooh  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what weve done  
And theres a fire inside  
We were born to be the onesBorn to be  
To show the faithless what weve done  
And theres a fire inside  
It burns like the surface of the sun  
  
We were born to be the ones  
And burn like the surface of the sun  
Ooh  
To show the faithless what weve done  
Ooh  
And burn like the surface of the sun  
  
And all the million miles to go  
Not over yet not even close  
  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what weve done  
And theres a fire inside  
We were born to be the ones  
To show the faithless what weve done  
And theres a fire inside  
It burns like the surface of the sun  
  
Ooh  
  
We were born to be the ones  
Ooh  
And burn like the surface of the sun  
Ooh  
To show the faithless what weve done  
Ooh  
And burn like the surface of the sun
