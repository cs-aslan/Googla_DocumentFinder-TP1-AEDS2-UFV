Alright  
  
Were scanning the scene  
In the city tonight  
Were looking for you  
To start up a fight  
  
There is an evil feeling  
In our brains  
But its nothing new  
You know it drives us insane  
  
Running  
On our way  
Hiding  
You will pay  
Dying  
One thousand deaths  
  
Running  
On our way  
Hiding  
You will pay  
Dying  
One thousand deaths  
  
Searching  
Seek and Destroy  
  
Searching  
Seek and Destroy  
  
Searching  
Seek and Destroy  
  
Searching  
Seek and Destroy  
  
There is no escape  
And thats for sure  
This is the end  
We wont take any more  
  
Say goodbye  
To the world you live in  
Youve always been taking  
And now youre giving  
  
Running  
On our way  
Hiding  
You will pay  
Dying  
One thousand deaths  
  
Running  
On our way  
Hiding  
You will pay  
Dying  
One thousand deaths  
  
Searching  
Seek and Destroy  
  
Searching  
Seek and Destroy  
  
Searching  
Seek and Destroy  
  
Searching  
Seek and Destroy  
  
Bridge and solo  
  
Our brains are on fire  
With the feeling to kill  
And it wont go away  
Until our dreams are fulfilled  
  
There is only one thing  
On our minds  
Dont try running away  
Cause youre the one we will find  
  
Running  
On our way  
Hiding  
You will pay  
Dying  
One thousand deaths  
  
Running  
On our way  
Hiding  
You will pay  
Dying  
One thousand deaths  
  
Searching  
Seek and Destroy  
  
Searching  
Seek and Destroy  
  
Searching  
Seek and Destroy  
  
Searching  
Seek and Destroy  
  
Ah ha ha ha ha
