Theres a sense of longing in me  
As I read Rosemarys letter  
Her writings honest  
Cant forget the years shes lost  
  
In isolation  
She talks about her love  
And as I read  
Ill die alone  
I know she was aching  
  
Theres a certain detail seen here  
The pen must have slipped to the side  
And left a stain  
Next to his name  
She knew he was gone  
  
And isolation  
Is all that would remain  
The wound in me is pouring out  
To rest on a lovers shore
