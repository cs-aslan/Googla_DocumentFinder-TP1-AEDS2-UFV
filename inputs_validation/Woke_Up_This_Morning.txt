I paid my last respects this mornin on an early grave  
Already said goodbye nothin left to say  
A tiny church a tiny town and not a tear was spent  
Not how I wanted it Im hating all of this  
  
Well Im hating all of this  
Im hating all of this  
All of this all of this  
Now I know why I hide my love from you some days  
No I dont mind keeping this bottled inside me  
You came along and tore this world out around me  
Looks like you found me  
Now I know why  
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning  
  
Ive been a loser all my life Im not about to change  
If you dont like theres the door nobody made you stay  
There aint a woman on the planet who can deal with it  
Just how I wanted it Im hating all of this  
  
Well Im hating all of this  
Im hating all of this  
All of this all of this  
Now I know why I hide my love from you some days  
No I dont mind keeping this bottled inside me  
You came along and tore this world out around me  
Looks like you found me  
Now I know why  
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning  
  
All of this all of this  
Now I know why I hide my love from you some days  
No I dont mind keeping this bottled inside me  
You came along and tore this world out around me  
Looks like you found me  
Now I know why  
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning
