I hear my name I hear the trash youre talking  
In your sleep the secrets that youre keeping  
Oh shit youre smart  
Did you really think you could keep her in the dark  
  
Does she purr Does she make it hard  
Hard to speak does she dress the part  
Im sure shell take some getting used to  
Brotha she will never be me  
  
Feel the burn take a spin  
Suck the poison out of me Ill make ya beg  
Ill make ya come to your senses if you keep  
Up the shit take the hit  
This is how it goes down this is how it goes down  
  
Gonna run gonna scream gonna crawl down on your knees  
When you realize that no ones gonna measure up to me  
Doesnt matter cause Im over it now  
This is how it goes down this is how it goes down  
  
Im gonna rage stay out really late  
Gonna hang with all my friends you hate  
I may try that threesome  
Better late than never and better without you  
  
This is your future as I see it  
You will be homeless bald and broken  
She will have left you when she finds out who you are  
Youre nothing but an extra and baby Im the star  
  
Feel the burn take a spin  
Suck the poison out of me Ill make ya beg  
Ill make ya come to your senses if you keep  
Up the shit take the hit  
This is how it goes down this is how it goes down  
  
Gonna run gonna scream gonna crawl down on your knees  
When you realize that no ones gonna measure up to me  
Doesnt matter cause Im over it now  
This is how it goes down this is how it goes down  
  
Suppose this is how the story goes  
But ever since that door closed Ive been going down  
Down  
The dream in the pink got me nauseous  
I shouldve grown more cautious and clever whatever  
  
You never find a dude with better head game  
And you can take that both ways  
You laughing like Im playing with your fingers up like oj  
Missy you would have a threesome without me Ill pull an oj  
And text you some incriminating pictures from my old days  
  
Feel the burn take a spin  
Suck the poison out of me Ill make ya beg  
Ill make ya come to your senses if you keep  
Up the shit take the hit  
This is how it goes down this is how it goes down  
  
Gonna run gonna scream gonna crawl down on your knees  
When you realize that no ones gonna measure up to me  
Doesnt matter cause Im over it now  
This is how it goes down this is how it goes down  
  
Somebody done lied to you  
Because youre not such a big shot dude  
You might wanna rethink it through  
You shouldve asked me I wouldve told you the truth
