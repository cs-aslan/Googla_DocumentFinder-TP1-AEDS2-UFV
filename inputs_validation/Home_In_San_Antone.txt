Havent got a worry  
Havent got a care  
Havent got a thing to call my own  
Though Im out of money  
Im a millionaire  
I still have my home in San Antone  
  
When I greet my neighbor with a hi yall  
Im as welcome as a king upon a throne  
But when I feel like braggin  
I just up and say  
Im a native son of San Antone  
  
Well I travel around the country on my merry way  
Ive been to crowds and felt I was alone  
But when I feel like braggin  
I just up and say  
Im a native son of San Antone  
  
And theres a sweet somebody by the Alamo  
Someday shes goin to be my very own  
And well buy a high chair in a year or so  
For our little home in San Antone  
  
Well I havent got a worry  
Havent got a care  
Havent got a thing to call my own  
And though Im out of money  
Im a millionaire  
I still have my home in San Antone  
  
And theres a sweet somebody by the Alamo  
Someday shes goin to be my very own  
And then Ill build a high chair in a year or so  
For our little home in San Antone  
  
Im a native son of San Antone  
For our little home in San Antone
