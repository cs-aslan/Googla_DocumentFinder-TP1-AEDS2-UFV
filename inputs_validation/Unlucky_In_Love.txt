The rain is falling through the window  
Down the walls on the floor  
Im sitting in a station and Im wondering  
Ooh can it rain any more  
When youre so far down  
Theres no getting up again  
Oh Im so alone  
And Im to blame  
Unlucky in love  
Unlucky in love  
Guess it always ends up that way  
Unlucky in love  
Unlucky in my life  
Guess itll always be the same  
Im the only one to blame  
Why oh why am I unlucky in love  
The train is standing on the platform  
But my feet are stuck to the floor  
Maybe in another town Ill get lucky  
Yeah if I could reach that carriage door  
But when youre so far down  
Aint no getting up again  
Oh Im so alone  
And Im to blame  
Unlucky in love  
Unlucky in love  
Everything I touch turns to dust  
Unlucky in love  
Unlucky in love  
Never needed anything quite as much  
A womans voice and a womans touch  
Why oh why am I unlucky in love
