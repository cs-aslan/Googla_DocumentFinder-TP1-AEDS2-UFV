Ll Cool JPuffy  
Its gonna be a hot summer baby  
This is the remix  
Know what Im saying sugar  
Carl Thomas yeah uncle L  
Lets go  
  
When its love at first sight  
Its all right to get caught up in the hype  
You got me staring at the ceiling late at night  
I got you calling up your girls for insight  
Thats aiight cause I blazed it just right  
You got a man so I cant leave marks when I bite  
Cant go to your crib and conversate late at night  
But I know you think of me when hes holding you tight  
Wish I was there baby  
  
Carl Thomas  
It was love at first sight  
I know from the way she looked at me  
Her eyes said it all  
Long days and nights we spent  
Until she dropped the bomb on me  
When she said that she  
Was unhappily married with children  
  
1  And I wish I never met her at all  
Even though I love her so  
But she got love for me  
But she still belongs to someone else  
  
It hurts so bad for sure  
Because she wants to be with me  
But she cannot be with me  
She chose to stayhey at home  
So they could be a family  
For the children  
But what about me  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Maybe in another life  
Things could be the way  
We both desired  
Its a catch22  
Catch22  
Even when you win someone had to lose  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Ll Cool J Puffy  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I wanna snatch you from your man  
Thats right  
If need be throw some ice up on your hand  
Come on  
Anybody thats human will understand  
Uh  
No disrespect baby its Gods plan  
Your mans cool with me  
But I must take whats rightfully mine  
Even if it means I gotta cross the line  
Even if it means I got to take my time  
Take your time  
And send some chicks at him and disrupt his mind  
But whether he true or not  
You still hot  
Still hot  
At three in the morning you sit staring at the clock  
Come on  
Making up reasons to ride through my block  
What  
I wish hed disappear I wish that youd stop  
I wish that we could shop with our shorties in the drop  
Hehe  
Cruise the clear waters in a wine colored yacht  
I like that  
The sun rays sparkle off your skin so hot  
Come on  
It gets no better than this we on top  
Yeah  
  
Carl Thomas Puffy  
Met her  
At all at all  
Even though I love her so  
Shes got love for me oh  
Carl Thomas Emotions  
But she still belongs to someone else  
Bad Boy you know the name  
Sing the song  
I wish I wish I never met her at all oh oh  
Yeah  
I wouldnt hurt so much inside  
Oh she still belongs to someone else  
Oh I wouldnt feel this pain  
Met her at all  
If I never met her at all at all at all  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
She still belongs to someone else  
Uh yeah uh yeah
