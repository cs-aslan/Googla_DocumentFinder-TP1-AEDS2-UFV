Now theres newsprint all over your face  
Well maybe thats why I can read you like a book  
Just when I thought I was getting my taste to bite  
I go and lose my appetite  
Look at the men that youd call uncle  
Theyd like to sink their teeth into you  
For the pride and the pleasure  
And the privilege of having you  
  
If I say youre the one do you think that Im serious  
You get that kind of talk from older men  
If I say I love you then I must be delirious  
So why are you trying to put my temperature up again  
  
Look at the men that youd call uncle  
Having a heart attack round your ankles  
  
When you wake up with Xrated eyes  
When you wake up still shaking  
How can I apologize  
As you check your effects and check your reflection  
Im so affected in the face of your affection  
  
Look at the men that youd call uncle  
Having a heart attack round your ankles  
  
I could swear I could promise that Ill always be true to you  
But we may not live to be so old  
I could even say Im going to do something new to you  
Now the girls I see just leave me cold  
  
Look at the men that you call uncle
