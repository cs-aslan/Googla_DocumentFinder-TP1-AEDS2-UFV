Where are the new rebels  
We didnt ask for this  
Trying to be something different  
We will fight the bigots  
Fight them with our reason  
Fight them with our constancy  
  
Chorus  
River our river let it flow  
This is our lamp light  
Let it glow  
River river let it flow  
This is our reason  
Let it grow  
Dont keep looking back  
Living in the past  
Never built a golden future Have  
Have faith in the species  
Weve come to far to fail  
I dont believe in our extinction  
Everyone of us  
Has got to take it on  
Dont build a dam on evolution There  
There are those whod like us  
To cling on to the past  
Wallowing in their past glories  
River dont  
Our river dont look back  
Let it flow we might fall  
This is our lamp light  
Let it glow have faith in the future  
River dont  
River dont look back  
Let it flow we might fall  
This is our reason  
Let it grow
