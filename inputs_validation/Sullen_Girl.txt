Days like this  
I dont know what to do with myself  
All dayand all night  
I wander the halls along the walls  
And under my breath  
I say to myself  
I need fuelto take flight  
  
And theres to much going on  
But its calm under the waves  
In the blue of my oblivion  
  
Is that why they call me a sullen girlsullen girl  
They dont know  
I used to sail the deep and tranquil sea  
But he washed me ashore  
And he took my pearl  
And left an empty shell of me  
  
And theres too much going on  
But its calm under the waves  
In the blue of my oblivion  
Under the waves  
In the blue of my oblivion  
Its calm under the waves  
In the blue of my oblivion
