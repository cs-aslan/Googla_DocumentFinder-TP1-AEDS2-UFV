Please be wrong  
Please dont tell me its really you  
Tell me eyestell my heart what Im goin through  
I believed I believed I was over you  
  
If he should break your heart  
Ill always know where you are  
If you should fall apart  
Ill be there Ill be around  
If he should break your heart  
Ill be there  
  
Is this right  
I dont care Im alone with you  
Here we are once again youve got someone new  
Lonely hands please dont do what you want to do  
  
If he should break your heart  
Ill always know where you are  
If you should fall apart  
Ill be there Ill be around  
  
If he should break your heart  
From my soul I say goodbye yesterday  
One more night alone without the touch of you  
Then I start to break is it my mistake  
Tell me am I wrong for holdin on to you  
  
If he should break your heart  
Ill always know where you are  
If you should fall apart  
Ill be there Ill be around  
  
If he should break you heart Ill be there  
If he should break your if he should break your  
If he should break your heart  
Ill be there Ill be around
