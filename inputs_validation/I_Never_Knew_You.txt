Tell me a secret tell me anything  
Whats your weapon Whats your middle name  
What do you believe in Whats your animal  
Are you a cat or a dog person  
Whats your outlook Whats your favourite saying  
  
Hey maybe you laugh maybe you laugh a lot  
Maybe you started but you somehow quit the part  
And you may be a hippie and a democrat  
Yeah I remember that I think  
And you might like wine but youre not the type who likes to drink  
  
What made me forget everything I know  
All my beliefs replaced by scenarios  
Of unintelligent life echoing in stereo  
On invisible mics winding to my mind  
So I would like another look inside you  
Yeah I would love the chance to love you like Id never known you  
  
Yeah maybe youre sleeping on a telephone  
And maybe youre dreaming of an anglophone with a crooked smile  
And maybe your profile boasts a brand new nose  
And maybe your new job it requires that you cannot wear any clothes  
  
What made me forget everything I know  
All my beliefs replaced by scenarios  
Of unintelligent life echoing in stereo  
On invisible mics wired into my mind  
So I would like another look inside you  
Yeah I would love the chance to love you like Ive never known you  
  
After all I have fallen  
  
Maybe your favourite colour is brown  
And maybe your crying and youre not sure why  
Maybe youre living in a whole new town  
And maybe youre back with your old boyfriend and youre busy going down  
  
What made me forget everything  
All my beliefs are my memories  
All the episodes of you especially the ones that hurt  
And even the few that made me laugh  
Well I cant get them back  
Thats why Im asking for some more of you now  
Yes I would love the chance to love you  
And I would love to love you  
  
What made me forget everything I know  
All my beliefs replaced by scenarios  
Of unintelligent life echoing in stereo  
On invisible mics wired into my mind  
So I would like another look inside you  
Yes I would love the chance to love you I would love to love you  
  
Yes I would love the chance to love you  
Like Id never known you
