Well I think I see another side  
Maybe just another light that shines  
And I look over now through the door  
And I still belong to no one else  
Maybe I hold you to blame for all the reasons that you left  
And close my eyes till I see your surprise  
And youre leaving before my time  
Baby wont you change your mind  
  
Surely dont stay long Im missing you now  
Its like I told you Im over you somehow  
Before I close the door  
I need to hear you say goodbye  
Baby wont you change your mind  
  
I guess that hasnt changed someone  
Maybe nobody else could understand  
I guess that you believe you are a woman  
And that I am someone elses man  
But just before I see that you leave  
I want you to hold on to things that you said  
Baby I wish I were dead  
  
Surely dont stay long Im missing you now  
Its like I told you Im over you somehow  
Before I close the door  
I need to hear you say goodbye  
Baby wont you change your mind
