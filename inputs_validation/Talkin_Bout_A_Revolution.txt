Dont you know  
Theyre talkin bout a revolution  
It sounds like a whisper  
Dont you know  
Theyre talkin about a revolution  
It sounds like a whisper  
While theyre standing in the welfare lines  
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation  
Wasting time in the unemployment lines  
Sitting around waiting for a promotion  
  
Poor people gonna rise up  
And get their share  
Poor people gonna rise up  
And take whats theirs  
  
Dont you know  
You better run run run  
Oh I said you better  
Run run run  
  
Finally the tables are starting to turn  
Talkin bout a revolution
