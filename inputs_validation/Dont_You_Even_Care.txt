Ballard Jr  
Dont you even care whats gonna happen to me whoah  
Youre turning me loose and I never asked to be free no  
After all that weve been through  
How can you let it end  
I wanna be your lifetime man  
But you wanna be my friend  
Dont you even care whats gonna happen to me whoah  
Dont you even care whats gonna happen to me  
  
How will I spend my days  
What will I do each night  
I could go out alone  
Somehow it dont seem right  
  
Do yeah  
Do yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont you ever think about anybody but you  
After you have gone babe  
What am I gonna do oh  
So come on baby change your mind  
Please stay here with me  
Come on baby well be fine  
Just you wait and see  
  
Dont you even care whats gonna happen to me whoah  
Dont you even care whats gonna happen to me  
Do yeah Do yeah Do yeah
