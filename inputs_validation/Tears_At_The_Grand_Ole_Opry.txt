Ask the Grand Ole Opry here in Nashville Tennessee  
Everyone will be happy everybody but me  
Tonight Ill be there by myself I wont be with somebody else  
Cause the one that I love has been stolen away  
Cause therell be tears at the Grand Ole Opry tonight  
And every Saturday night bitter tears I will fight  
All the songs that I will hear will just bring sadness to my ear  
Cause therell be tears at the Grand Ole Opry tonight  
 fiddle  guitar   
Cause therell be tears at the Grand Ole Opry tonight  
This old heart cant believe that youre gone from sight  
Therell be no more joy and songs for me you were the only one  
And therell be tears at the Grand Ole Opry tonight
