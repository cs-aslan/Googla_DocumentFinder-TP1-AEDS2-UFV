There are things you should know  
  
And the distance between us seems to grow  
  
But youre holding on stronger  
  
And oh how hard it is to let go

Im waiting for your call  
  
And Im waiting to take your 666 in my heart  
  
And Im longing for your touch  
  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart oh my love  
  
Im losing my faith in you  
  
But you dont want it to be true  
  
But theres nothing you can do  
  
And there is nothing you can do yes Ive lost my faith in you  
  
Waiting for your call and Im ready to take your 666 in my heart  
  
And Im longing for your touch and I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart
right here in this heart  
Ooh right here is this heart ow my love  
  
And I know its too late  
Oh my god its a long way
