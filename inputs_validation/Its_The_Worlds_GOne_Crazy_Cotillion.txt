Its the worlds gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
The Johnny Comelateleys are comin in early  
The early birds showin up late  
The straightmen all wanna be funny  
The funny men all wanna get straight  
The villains have turned into heroes  
The heroes have turned into heels  
The dealers all wanna be lovers  
And the lovers all wanna make deals  
unverified they aint inherited nothin  
The leaders are fallin behind  
So Im singin my songs to the deaf men  
Dancing my dance to the blind  
Its the worlds gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
Its the worlds gone crazy  
And ladies are dancin and the sidemen  
And the frontmen wechome  
Its the worlds gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
Its the worlds gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
Its the worlds gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home
