I wont go away  
Right here Ill stay  
  
Stand silent in flames  
Stand tall till it fades  
  
Shoot me again  
I aint dead yet x4  
  
Shoot me again  
Shoot me again  
Shoot me  
Shoot me again  
Shoot me again  
Cmon x2  
  
All the shots I take  
I spit back at you  
All the shit you fake  
Comes back to haunt you  
  
All the shots  
All the shots  
  
All the shots I take  
What difference did I make  
All the shots I take  
I spit back at you  
  
I wont go away  
With a bullet in my back  
Right here Ill stay  
With a bullet in my back  
  
Shoot me  
Take a shot  
Shoot me  
Take a shot  
Shoot me  
Take a shot  
Shoot me  
Take a shot  
  
Ill stand on my own  
With a bullet in my back  
Im stranded and sold  
With a bullet in my back  
  
Shoot me again  
I aint dead yet x4  
  
Shoot me again  
Shoot me again  
Cmon  
Shoot me again  
Shoot me again  
Cmon x2  
  
All the shots I take  
I spit back at you  
All the shit you fake  
Comes back to haunt you  
  
All the shots  
All the shots  
  
All the shots I take  
What difference did I make  
All the shots I take  
I spit back at you  
  
I bite my tongue  
Trying not to shoot back  
No compromise  
My heart wont pump the other way  
  
Wake the sleeping giant  
Wake the beast  
Wake the sleeping dog  
No let him sleep  
  
I bite my tongue  
Trying not to shoot back  
  
All the shots I take  
I spit back at you  
All the shit you fake  
Comes back to haunt you  
  
All the shots  
All the shots  
  
All the shots I take  
What difference did I make  
All the shots I take  
I spit back at you
