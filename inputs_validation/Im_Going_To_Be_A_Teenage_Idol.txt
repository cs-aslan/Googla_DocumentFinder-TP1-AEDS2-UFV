Well theres slim times when my words wont rhyme  
And the hills I face are a long hard climb  
I just sit crosslegged with my old guitar  
It kind of makes me feel like a rock and roll star  
  
Well it makes me laugh Lord it makes me cry  
And I think for once let me just get high  
Let me get electric put a silk suit on  
Turn my old guitar into a tommy gun  
  
And roottootshoot myself to fame  
Every kid alive gonna know my name  
An overnight phenomenon like theres never been  
A motivated supersonic king of the scene  
  
Ill be a teenage idol just give me a break  
Im gonna be a teenage idol no matter how long it takes  
You cant imagine what it means to me  
Im gonna grab myself a place in history  
A teenage idol thats what Im gonna be yeah  
  
Well life is short and the world is rough  
And if youre gonna boogie boy you got to be tough  
Nobody knows if Im dead or alive  
I just drink myself to sleep each night  
  
And so I pray to the teenage god of rock  
If I make it big let me stay on top  
You got to cut me loose from this one room dive  
Put me on the ladder keep this boy alive  
  
And roottootshoot myself to fame  
Every kid alive gonna know my name  
An overnight phenomenon like theres never been  
A motivated supersonic king of the scene  
  
Ill be a teenage idol just give me a break  
Im gonna be a teenage idol no matter how long it takes  
You cant imagine what it means to me  
Im gonna grab myself a place in history  
A teenage idol thats what Im gonna be
