Where is my outline I start to fade  
No concentration means fail these days  
  
I leave the table saying i am real  
I feel the pressure like your eyes on me  
Dont mention that name and books on love  
I cant be sure I cant be sure  
  
You end on reel one  
You end on reel one  
  
You quote from anxious and things we do  
I need protection from the likes of you  
  
Do you begin to see that I dont know  
I live on memories that are hard to find  
Send me a card and write i think of you  
Ill say you lied Ill say youre lying  
  
You are you are  
  
Tell me a secret Im sure to fall  
My dog runs awol I blame you all  
  
Were in formation saying safe safe safe  
Turn up my collar and mix with dark  
The speaker turns on me spot her eyes  
Its hard to breathe its hard to breathe  
  
You end on reel one  
You end on reel one  
  
You are you are
