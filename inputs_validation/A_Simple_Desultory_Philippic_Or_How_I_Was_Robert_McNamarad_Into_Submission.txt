I been Norman Mailered Maxwell Taylored  
I been John OHarad Mcnamarad  
I been Rolling Stoned and Beatled till Im blind  
I been Ayn Randed nearly branded  
Communist cause Im lefthanded  
Thats the hand I use well never mind  
  
I been Phil Spectored resurrected  
I been Lou Adlered Barry Sadlered  
Well I paid all the dues I want to pay  
And I learned the truth from Lenny Bruce  
And all of my wealth wont buy me health  
So I smoke a pint of tea a day  
  
I knew a man his brain so small  
He couldnt think of nothing at all  
Hes not the same as you and me  
He doesnt dig poetry Hes so unhip that  
When you say Dylan he thinks youre talking about Dylan Thomas  
Whoever he was  
The man aint got no culture  
But its alright ma  
Everybody must get stoned  
  
I been Mick Jaggered silver daggered  
Andy Warhol wont you please come home  
I been mothered fathered aunt and uncled  
Been Roy Haleed and Art Garfunkeled  
I just discovered somebodys tapped my phone
