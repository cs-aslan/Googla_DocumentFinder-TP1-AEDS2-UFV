Well youre my friend  
And you can see  
May times weve been out drinking  
Many times weve shared our thoughts  
Did you ever ever notice the kind of thoughts I got  
Well you know I have a love for everyone I know  
And you know I have a drive for life that wont let go  
But sometimes the opposition come rising up in me  
This terrible imposition comes blacking through my mind  
  
And then I see a darkness  
Oh no I see a darkness  
Do you know how much I love you  
Cause Im hoping some day soon  
Youll save me from this darkness  
  
Well I hope that someday soon  
Well find peace in our lives  
Together or apart  
Alone or with our wives  
And we can stop our whoring  
And draw the smiles inside  
And light it up forever  
And never go to sleep  
My best unbeaten brother  
That isnt all I see  
  
And then I see a darkness  
Oh no I see a darkness  
Do you know how much I love you  
Cause Im hoping someday soon  
Youll save me from this darkness
