When I was young old man sat me on his knee  
He told me if I had a dream I could be what I want to be  
Now life goes on a voice echoes in the wind  
Its telling me to carry on now I know that its him  
  
Chorus  
He said whoa watch out boy  
Dont go messing with your life cause it aint no toy  
Lord help ya to carry lifes load  
It could all pass you by down on dead mans road  
  
Now I got a good woman  
Ya know shes looking out for me  
And if I get a little blind ya know she helps me to see  
But I gotta keep running because theyre catching up to me  
I think I hear that voice again this time it says to me  
  
Chorus  
  
When I was young old man sat me on his knee  
He told me if I had a dream I could be what I want to be  
Now life goes on a voice echoes in the wind  
Its telling me to carry on now I know that its him  
  
Chorus x2
