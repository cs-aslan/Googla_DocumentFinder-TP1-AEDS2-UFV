I cant sleep tonight  
I wont sleep tomorrow  
Im goin deep and tight  
I dont need no excuse  
I feel mean tonight  
Oneeyed jacks and aces  
Read em and weep tonight  
Im gonna let all hell break loose  
  
I want drums like thunder  
Gimme guitars that scream  
One woman who could shake me  
Yeah be my love machine  
  
I need a love machine  
to keep my motor running  
Upon the big wide screen  
I want to see it all  
Yeah well be lean and mean  
Well be synchronized together  
Me and my love machine  
Were gonna do it all  
  
I want drums like thunder  
Gimme guitars that scream  
One woman who can rock me  
Yeah my little love machine  
  
Were gonna make tonight  
A night to remember  
Were going hard and strong  
Again and again  
Yeah were gonna make tonight  
A night to remember  
Yeah were gonna take tonight  
Right to the end  
  
I need drums like thunder  
Gimme guitars that scream  
One woman who can rock me  
I need a love machine  
  
We gotta make tonight  
A night to remember  
Were goin hard and strong  
Again and again  
  
Yeah were gonna make tonight  
A night to remember  
Yeah were goin for a night  
A night without end  
  
We gotta make tonight  
A night to remember  
Were goin hard and strong  
Again and again  
  
Were gonna make tonight  
A night to remember  
Yeah were gonna take tonight  
Right to the end
