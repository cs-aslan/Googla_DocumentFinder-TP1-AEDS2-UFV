Whered you go huh  
They all think I know you  
Yeah its so hard to motivate me to devote  
A single inch of me to something I cant see  
I dont mean to pry but why  
Would you even make the eyes  
I dont believe my ears  
And Im scared of my own head  
I will deny you for years and  
Ill make you raise me from the dead  
And if I said that I would live for you for nothing in return  
Well Im sorry Mr Gullible  
But lyings all Ive learned  
So be concerned x2  
  
No music  
And I can talk about anything  
Whether or not its worthwhile  
Is based on whos listening  
Most of us listening for something we can relate to  
All of us related for something we just been through  
Taken for granted trust is damaged and now we panic  
Livin emptyhanded living lives like we can manage  
I can feel you but still know where home is feeling like Jonah did  
Almost dropped the bat like every base was fully loaded  
So be concerned x2  
  
I am disappearing  
Inside my birdseye theories  
I try to say goodbye defy and deny  
What it is Im fearing  
Clearly I am dying  
Dearly I am writing  
Merely testifying that a test to fly requires  
I pass the test with colors flying  
I dont believe you most the time  
Im lying cause I say I am fine  
You are the pearl I am the swine  
So break my life and take this rhyme  
Im so sorry but I do believe  
That all my bridges I have burned  
And Ive earned a policy of no return  
So be concerned x4
