I should have known youd bid me farewell  
Theres a lesson to be learned from this and Ive learned it very well  
Now I know youre not the only starfish in the sea  
If I never hear your name again its all the same to me  
  
And I think its gonna be all right  
Yeah the worst is over now  
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball  
  
You never care for secrets I confide  
To you Im just an ornament something for your pride  
Always running never caring thats the life you live  
Stolen minutes of your time were all you had to give  
  
And I think its gonna be all right  
Yeah the worst is over now  
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball  
  
The storys in the past with nothing to recall  
Ive got my life to live and I dont need you at all  
The roller coaster ride we took is nearly at an end  
I bought my tickets with my tears thats all Im gonna spend  
  
And I think its gonna be all right  
Yeah the worst is over now  
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball  
  
And I think its gonna be all right  
Yeah the worst is over now  
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball  
Its bouncing and its shining like a red rubber ball
