Down through the ages men have died for women  
And done so for many times  
Each time I loved one Ive always lost one  
Seems the right one is so hard to find  
  
Chorus  
Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them  
One in each color one in each style  
Ill find a lady someday to wear them  
My shopping will be done for awhile  
  
Ill bet somewheres a lady shopping for britches  
Comparing the value appraising each pair  
Maybe someday the Lord will bring us together  
And we ll both have a new wardrobe to wear  
  
Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them  
One in each color and one in each style  
Maybe someday if Im lucky  
Ill find someone to wear them  
And my shopping will be done for awhile  
My shopping will be done for awhile  
  
Im looking for a lady wholl look good in dresses  
She must be redheaded green eyes and be fair  
Ill make exceptions to all my requirements  
As long as she s willing to care  
  
Chorus  
  
I just saw a beauty with blue eyes what a cutie  
Bond hair like a halo around her did flow  
But the brunette beside her would be just as lovely  
In the dresses I bought long ago  
  
Chorus  
  
Now as I sit here dreaming planning and scheming  
Why should I make standards when everyone knows  
As your need ranges women make changes  
And you must accept them or just let them go  
  
Chorus
