Airstream big chrome airstream  
Leave the world behind me  
They wont find me in my airstream  
  
Free I dont want to be stuck in the city  
With the cars and people downtown  
Waiting in a line  
Wishing I was far away  
Where no one knows my name  
  
Ocean big blue ocean  
Rolling like a daydream  
Down the highway in my airstream  
  
Free I dont want to be stuck in the city  
With the cars and people downtown  
Waiting in a line  
Wishing I was far away  
Where no one knows my name  
Or my address its a place Ive never been  
When it gets too familiar Ill be gone  
  
Free I dont want to be stuck in the city  
With the cars and people downtown  
Waiting in a line  
Wishing I was far away  
Where no one knows my name  
Or my address its a place Ive never been  
When it gets too familiar Ill be gone  
When it gets too familiar Ill be gone  
When it gets too familiar Ill be gone
