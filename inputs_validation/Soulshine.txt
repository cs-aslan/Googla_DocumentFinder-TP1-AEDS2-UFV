When you cant find the light  
That got you through the cloudy days  
When the stars aint shinin bright  
You feel like youve lost youre way  
When those candle lights of home  
Burn so very far away  
Well you got to let your soul shine  
Just like my daddy used to say  
  
He used to say soulshine  
Its better than sunshine  
Its better than moonshine  
Damn sure better than rain  
Hey now people dont mind  
We all get this way sometime  
Got to let your soul shine shine till the break of day  
  
I grew up thinkin that I had it made  
Gonna make it on my own  
Life can take the strongest man  
Make him feel so alone  
Now and then I feel a cold wind  
Blowin through my achin bones  
I think back to what my daddy said  
He said Boy in the darkness before the dawn  
  
Let your soul shine  
Its better than sunshine  
Its better than moonshine  
Damn sure better than rain  
Yeah now people dont mind  
We all get this way sometimes  
Gotta let your soul shine shine till the break of day  
  
Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness  
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul  
A woman too God knows she can feel like this  
And when your world seems cold you got to let your spirit take control  
  
Let your soul shine  
Its better than sunshine  
Its better than moonshine  
Damn sure better than rain  
Lord now people dont mind  
We all get this way sometimes  
Gotta let your soul shine shine till the break of day  
  
Oh its better than sunshine  
Its better than moonshine  
Damn sure better than rain  
Yeah now people dont mind  
We all get this way sometimes  
Gotta let your soul shine shine till the break of day
