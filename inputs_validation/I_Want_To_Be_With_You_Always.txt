I lose my blues  
Only when Im with you  
No one else can do  
Youre in my heart to stay  
And when Im gone and Im all alone  
Ill be singing this song  
I want to be with you always  
  
Id be happy dear  
If you could only be here  
And always be near you  
Forever and a day  
Then wed travel far to some big shining star  
Just you and my guitar  
And stay there sweetheart for always  
  
I hope you feel the same  
You really want my name  
Youll be the one whos to blame  
If it works out wrong that day  
Cause my love is true my loves only for you  
I would never be blue  
If I can be with you always  
Then wed travel far to some big shining star  
Just you and my guitar  
And stay there sweetheart for always
