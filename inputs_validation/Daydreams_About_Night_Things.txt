Im having daydreams about night things in the middle of the afternoon  
While my hands make a living my minds home loving you  
Im having daydreams about night things in the middle of the afternoon  
And every night you make my dreams come true  
  
All day long while Im working in town time slows down to a crawl  
When Im not thinking about you Im checking the clock on the wall  
Then its goodbye factory and hello love and theres a smile across my face  
Cause Im back in the arms of your sweet love where my thoughts have been all
day  
Im having daydreams  
  
Im having daydreams
