Dont leave me now  
Now that I need you  
How blue and lonely Id be  
If you should say were through  
  
Dont break my heart  
This heart that loves you  
Theyll just be nothing for me  
If you should leave me now  
  
What good is dreamin  
If I must dream all alone by myself  
Without you darling  
My arms would gather dust  
  
Come to these arms  
These arms that need you  
Dont close your eyes to my plea  
Dont leave me now
