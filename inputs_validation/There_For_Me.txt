feat Sarah Brightman  
  
Sarah  
There for me every time Ive been away  
Will you be there for me thinking of me everyday  
Are you my destiny words I never dared to say  
Will you be there for me  
Just think of you and me we could never tow the line  
Its such a mystery just to hear you say youre mine  
And while youre close to me so close to me  
Just hold me  
  
Josh  
When youre feeling cold and all the city streets are grey  
Walking all alone and watching how the children play  
Voices in the wind and faces from the past go dancing by  
Theyre asking why  
  
Sarah and Josh  
Will you be there for me everytime I go away  
Will you be there for me thinking of me everyday  
Are you my destiny words I never dared to say  
Will you be there for me  
  
And while youre close to me so close to me  
Just hold me  
  
Josh  
Can you really want me more than for a little while  
What are the stories hiding there behind your smile  
Wishes in a dream and figures in a world that I could share  
And everywhere  
  
Sarah and Josh  
Will you be there for me  
Will there ever come a day when all the world can see  
Things were meant to be that way  
Will you be there for me  
Can you hear the people say  
That youre just  
There for me  
  
Josh  
There for me  
  
Sarah  
There for me
