Saigon it was all gone  
The same Coke machines  
As the streets I grew on  
Down in a mesquite canyon  
We come walking along the ridge  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Campsites an hours walk from the nearest road to town  
Up here theres too much brush and canyon  
For the CHP choppers to touch down  
Aint lookin for nothin just want to live  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
Come the Santa Anas man that dry brushll light  
Billy Devon got burned up in his own campfire one winter night  
We buried his body in the white stone high up along the ridge  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Had enough of town and the street life  
Over nothing you end up on the wrong end of someones knife  
Now I dont want no trouble  
And I aint got none to give  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
I come home in 72  
You were just a beautiul light  
In your mamas dark eyes of blue  
I stood down on the tarmac I was just a kid  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Come Veterans Day I sat in the stands in my dress blues  
I held your mothers hand  
When they passed with the red white and blue  
One minute youre right there  and something slips
