The writings on the wall brother  
Your life is in your hands  
Its up to you to see the writings on the wall  
  
It looks you in the eye mister  
Its time we stand up tall  
Go see and understand the writings on the wall  
  
Strange we hold on to things that have no grace  
Or power  
While death holds on to us much more with every  
Passing hour  
And all the time you thought it would last  
Your life your friends would always be  
Til theyre drunk away or shot away or die away  
From you  
  
Theres nothing that you need sister  
The Lord is in you all  
Life is designed to see the writings on the wall  
  
The musics in the air mothers  
You may have heard it call  
To you that you may see the writings on the wall  
  
Be careful going home sister  
Be watchful down that road  
Youve got a lot of love sister  
More to grow  
  
The writings on the wall brothers  
Your life is in your hands  
Its up to you to see the writings on the wall  
I hope that you may see the writings on the wal
