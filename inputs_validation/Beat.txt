Its a big bad world but I aint ashamed to like the lights in my hand  
And the beat in my face  
Its a big bad world but I aint ashamed to like the lights in my hand  
And the beat in my face  
  
Beat in my face beat in my face  
The lights in my hand and the beat in my face  
  
Beat in my face beat in my face  
The lights in my hand and the beat in my face

Just wanna do it eh just wanna do it eh

Just wanna do it eh just wanna do it eh  
  
Its a big bad world but I aint ashamed to like the lights in my hand  
And the beat in my face  
Its a big bad world but I aint ashamed to like the lights in my hand

The lights in my hand and the beat in my face

Just wanna do it eh just wanna do it eh  
I feel like dancing when I hear that sound  
Just wanna do it eh just wanna do it eh
