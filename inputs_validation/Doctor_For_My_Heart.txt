Babe how can you mend a broken heart  
Oh youre tearing me apart  
Thousand drums play in my mind  
Take it off him put it on me  
Oh Im feeling so lonely  
And Im holding back my tears  
  
I dont want to a doctor for my heart  
Oh I want to try a brand new start  
I dont want to a doctor for my heart  
Oh I want to a commander of my love  
  
I dont want to a doctor for my lonely heartache  
My heart bleeds love me lady  
Come take a chance on love  
  
I can give you anything but love  
Take this chains from your heart  
Thousand drums are playing my mind  
Babe harder I try bluer I get  
Dont put my love in a dirty bag  
Until then theres no end
