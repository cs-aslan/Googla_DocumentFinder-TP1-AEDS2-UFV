Thought you were ordinary  
Would not amount too much  
I guess they never knew you  
You found the place they couldnt touch  
  
Said you were nothing special  
Always kept to yourself  
You had to fight your own way  
Theres always been touch too much at stake  
  
What you gonna do  
Cause youre just like me  
What you gonna do  
Tonight this is where we go  
To find out who we really are  
Weve got nothing left to lose  
Tonight this is how we breathe  
To put some strength back in our hearts  
Weve got nothing left to lose  
We start from the dark  
  
Youll never pass for someone  
Wholl find a place in life  
Youd sooner take that last breath  
To give away your heart and mind  
  
What you gonna do  
Cause youre just like me  
What you gonna do  
Tonight this is where we go  
To find out who we really are  
Weve got nothing left to lose  
Tonight this is how we breathe  
To put some strength back in our hearts  
Weve got nothing left to lose  
We start from the dark  
Start from the dark  
  
What you gonna do  
Cause youre just like me  
What you gonna do  
Tonight  
Tonight this is where we go  
To find out who we really are  
Weve got nothing left to lose  
Tonight this is how we breathe  
To put some strength back in our hearts  
Weve got nothing left to lose  
We start from the dark  
Start from the dark
