Ive been walking these streets so long  
singing the same old song  
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway  
where hustles the name of the game  
and nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain  
theres been a load of compromising  
on the road to my horizon  
but Im gonna be where the lights are shining on me  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
riding out on a horse  
in a star spangled rodeo  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
getting cards and letters from people I dont even know  
and offers coming over the phone  
well I really dont mind the rain  
and a smile can hide all the pain  
but youre down when youre riding the train  
thats taking the long way  
and I dream of the things Ill do  
with a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe  
therell be a load of compromising  
on the road to my horizon  
but Im gonna be where the lights are shining on me  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo  
rhinestone cowboy  
getting cards and letters from people I dont even know  
and offers coming over the phone  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
getting cards and letters from people I dont even know  
like a rhinestone cowboy
