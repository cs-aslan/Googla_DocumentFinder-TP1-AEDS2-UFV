Chorus  
If it happens again Im leaving  
Ill pack my things and go  
If it happens again  
Therell be no looking back  
I wont say I told you some  
  
You did what you were told  
And you took the strain  
Been left out in the cold  
Got yourself to blame  
But believe me  
If it happens again Im leaving  
If it stays the same Im gone  
When youre stabbed in the back  
And theres salt in the wound  
The its time to move along  
  
Chorus  
  
No more spanners in the works  
All the works been done  
Had your face rubbed in the dirt  
On show for every one  
But believe me  
If it happens again Im leaving  
If it stays the same Im gone  
When compromise is the song you sing  
Its been going on to long  
  
Chorus
