Big brown bedroom eyes  
Theyre bad for me  
Reluctantly you hit me  
To my vulnerability  
I dont like this feeling  
Cause I cant see straight  
Something says I met my match  
Courtesy of fate  
  
Ive always taken pride  
In my independence  
So afraid and careful  
Not to show it  
No  but you give me clarity  
Like a bright green laser beam  
I think you want whats best for me  
In spite of my resistance  
  
Be my eyes  
Sing me Im your song  
Make me wise baby  
Ill be strong  
  
Constantly the ones we love scorn us  
Its not for them to comprehend  
Its none of their business  
Misery loves company  
  
I think you really know me  
And theres no coincidence  
My mama must have made me  
So we would find each other
