Well Im beginning to see the light  
Well Im beginning to see the light  
Some people work very hard  
But still they never get it right  
Well Im beginning to see the light  
Well Im beginning to see the light  
Now Im beginning to see the light  
  
Wine in the morning  
And some breakfast at night  
Well Im beginning to see the light  
Here we go again  
Playing the fool again  
Here we go again  
Acting hard again  
Well Im beginning to see the light  
Well Im beginning to see the light  
Now Im beginning to see the light  
  
Well Im beginning to see the light  
Im beginning to see the light  
I wore my teeth in my hands  
So I could mess the hair of the night  
Well Im beginning to see the light  
Hey Im beginning to see the light  
I met myself in a dream  
And I just want to tell you  
Everything was alright  
Im beginning to see the light  
Here comes two of you  
Which one will you chose  
One is black one is blue  
Dont look just what to do  
Well Im beginning to see the light  
Well Im beginning to see the light  
Now Im beginning to see the light  
  
Well Im beginning to see the light  
Well Im beginning to see the light  
Some people work very hard  
But still they never get it right  
Well Im beginning to see the light  
There are problems in these times  
But none of them are mine  
Baby Im beginning to see the light  
Here we go again  
I thought that you were my friend  
Here we go again  
I thought that you were my friend  
How does it feel to be loved  
How does it feel to be loved
