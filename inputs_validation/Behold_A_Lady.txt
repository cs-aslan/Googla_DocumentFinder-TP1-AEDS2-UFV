Sophistophone aristocrats  
Distinguished stars clean up your acts  
Pull up your pants ladies and gents  
Please act like you got some sense  
You know what I really want to know  
Where do all the good girls go  
What clubs they hang in  
  
Chorus  
Behold a lady  
I see you standin on the wall  
Clap clap you deserve it all Repeat  
Candycoated unicorns are quite hard to find  
The classic lady a rare breed indeed  
Is that make and model discontinued  
  
Today I might snow tomorrow Ill rain  
3000s always changing but you stay the same  
And I need that hey I need that In my life  
When I feel washed up and inadequate  
And throw all my songs away no matter how mad I get  
You make me smile you make me smile  
You make me smile you make me  
Youre the anchor that holds me down  
When my ship is sinking  
You wont let me drown and Im grateful  
  
Chorus  
  
Yo mamas old fashioned yo daddy dont play  
Youll always be this lovely  
Cause they raised you that way  
Hallelujah Thank ya Jesus Thank ya Lord  
Thank ya Jesus Thank ya Lord  
Thank ya Jesus Thank ya Lord  
Youre not extra youre so plain Jane  
The yin to my yang darlin  
Youve got that thang and you know it  
But yet you dont and thats whats so cool  
You dont say too much but when you do its profound  
In the street you hold your head high  
At home you get low down for me  
Cant get no lower cant get no lower cant get no lower yeah  
Hoo Youre the anchor that holds me down  
When my ship is sinking you wont let me drown  
  
Sad but one day our kids will have to visit museums  
To see what a lady looks like  
So if you find one I beg you hold her tight  
If you spot one good sir treat her right  
This is Benjamin Andre signing off  
Thanks a million  
Good luck and goodnight
