Travel down the road of heartache  
Hear an echo in my mind  
Ive played with fire  
Burned my fingers  
Now Im gonna take my time  
You dont have to shout about it  
Cant you see it obvious  
Feel  its getting close to comfort  
Why you makin such a fuss  
  
Take your time with  
What youre doin  
And youll see the skies appear  
Seen and heard it all before her  
Now you understand my fear  
Cant you see the time will tell us  
How its gonna always be  
You can wrap me  
Around your finger  
And I aint no mystery  
  
Playing for time  
Thats all I can do  
Im playing for time  
Before I fall in love with you  
  
You can push me every which way  
Hey I got no place to fall  
Guess youre gonna rue your bullshit  
When your backs against the wall  
Louder now thats what the games go   
And I bought the devil now   
You can get to dream about it  
I wont need one anyhow  
  
Playing for time  
Thats all I can do  
Playing for time  
Before I fall in love  
Playing for time  
Thats all I want to do  
Playing for time  
Before I fall in love  
  
Oh you dont have to shout about it  
Cant you see it obvious  
Feel its getting close for comfort  
Why you making such a fuss  
Travel down the road of heartache  
Hear an echo my mind  
Played with fire burned my fingers  
Now Im gonna take my time  
  
Playing for time  
Before I fall in love with you  
Playing for time  
Thats all I want to do  
Playing for time  
Before I fall  
Playing for time  
All I want to do  
Playing for time
