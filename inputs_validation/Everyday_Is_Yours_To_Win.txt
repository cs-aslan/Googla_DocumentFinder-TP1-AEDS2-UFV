With the walk walk  
And the talk talk  
And the tick tock clock clock  
  
With the rock rock  
And the roll roll  
And the bridge bridge  
And the toll toll  
  
With the brilliance brilliance  
And the light light  
With the stink stink  
And the hide hide  
And the road ahead of you  
  
I cannot tell a lie  
Its not all cherry pie  
But its all there waiting for you  
Yeah you  
  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
I know  
  
With the walk walk  
And the woods woods  
And the subterfuge subterfuge  
Theres an old look bitter and blue  
  
While Im nothing but confused confused  
With nothing left to lose lose  
And if you buy that  
Ive got a bridge for you  
  
Hey yeah hey yeah  
Hey yeah hey yeah  
Hey yeah hey yeah  
I know  
  
Hey yeah hey yeah  
Hey yeah hey yeah  
Hey yeah hey yeah  
I know  
  
Oh  
  
Every day is new again  
Every day is yours to win  
And thats how heroes are made  
  
I wanted I wanted to win to win  
So Id said it again  
Thats how heroes are made  
  
Hey yeah hey yeah  
Hey yeah hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
I know

Hey yeah hey yeah
