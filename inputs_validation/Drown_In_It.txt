It dont get no better  
Than my tongue riding your letter  
Feeling you get wetter  
Well be making love until the morning after  
And I can feel your thigh slowly rising  
As Im sipping from your water fountain  
  
We gon flood the bed  
Take it to the ground  
While Im in your ocean baby  
Hold my head down down down  
  
Hook  
I wanna drown in it drown in it  
Drown in it drown in it  
Just take me under  
Drown in it drown in it  
Under your waters  
Drown in it drown in it  
I will never come up oh  
  
Verse 2 Chris Brown  
High heels in your red lips  
Its fair and high in here  
And I can see a million ways  
For me to surfboard between your waves girl  
We be going updown all around drip drop dont stop  
No umbrella playing in your rain  
Shawty Ill be slashing in you deeper  
High draining oh baby  
Come sit that body in my face  
  
Hook  
I wanna drown in it drown in it  
Drown in it drown in it  
Just take me under  
Drown in it drown in it  
Under your waters  
Drown in it drown in it  
I will never come up oh  
  
Bridge  
Baby baby baby  
Yeah I wanna drown in it  
Baby baby baby  
Yeah I wanna drown in it  
  
Take me under  
I just wanna tell you  
No price compares to what its worth  
Your pool is like heaven on Earth  
Youre screaming while Im touching your spot  
Oh girl I got your water so high  
I wanna drown in it  
I wanna drown in it baby  
I wanna drown in it baby  
All you gotta do is  
Keep filling me up with your juices  
Keep it right there baby dont lose it  
  
Hook  
I wanna drown in it drown in it  
Drown in it drown in it  
Just take me under  
Drown in it drown in it  
Under your waters  
Drown in it drown in it  
I will never come up oh  
  
Hook  
I wanna drown in it drown in it  
Drown in it drown in it  
Just take me under  
Drown in it drown in it  
Under your waters  
Drown in it drown in it  
Just like a male mermaid  
  
I stay thirsty babe
