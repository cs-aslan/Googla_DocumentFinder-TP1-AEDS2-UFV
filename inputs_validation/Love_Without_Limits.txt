See the faces in the crowd  
Everyone is reaching out  
Searching for something thats real  
  
See the souls behind the eyse  
Left with no way to disguise  
The yearning inside  
  
Chorus  
He loves without limits  
Sees us every minute  
Wherever we are walking  
He is near  
His spirit is relentless  
His hope for us is endless  
I know I know  
He loves without limits  
  
Theres no mountain thats too steep  
Theres no ocean thats too deep  
Nothing can keep him from us  
  
Hes the lover of our souls  
Hes the one that makes us whole  
Oh dont you know  
If we could only see how far  
God will reach to touch our hearts  
  
Chorus  
  
I know I know nothing can separate us  
I know I know Gods love is limitless  
  
Chorus
