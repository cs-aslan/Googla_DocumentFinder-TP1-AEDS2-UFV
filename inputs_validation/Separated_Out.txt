Can you feel my skin  
Can you feel my bones  
Can you put my spine in plaster and take me home  
  
So unpleasant inside and out  
So unpleasant inside and out  
If you like Ill tell you about it  
You wouldnt want to know  
  
My heads full of water  
Tears I never cried  
Could you hold me under the shower  
In the cold outside  
  
So unsteady inside and out  
So unsteady inside and out  
If you like Ill tell you about it  
You wouldnt want to be  
  
Separated out  
Separated out  
Separated out  
  
I need medical attention  
Wheres my memory gone  
Everything I told you  including this  
I already forgot  
  
Separated out  
From the living stream  
The thing that couldnt lie straight  
Straight in the machine  
  
So unstable inside and out  
Dont know how much longer Ill take it  
If you like Ill sell you a ticket  
Or you can get in for free  
  
Am I enough of a freak  
To be worth paying to see  
Am I enough of a freak  
To be worth paying to see  
  
Can you feel my skin  
Can you feel my bones  
Can you put my spine in plaster and take me home  
Can you kiss my face  
Let me know its there  
Can you give it shape  
Can you kinda care  
  
Am I enough of a freak  
To be worth paying to see  
Enough of a freak  
To be worth paying to see  
  
Enough  
Enough  
  
Theyre pointing and laughing  
Theyre pointing and laughing at me
