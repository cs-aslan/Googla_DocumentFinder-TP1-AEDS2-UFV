Im the most dangerous person in this room  
The way you look  
I could do some damage to myself  
Its your heart against mine  
And I fear I may capsize  
Im operating without a license  
But Im willing to pay the price  
Cause youre just so easy  
Youre so damned easy on the eyes  
  
You turn your face  
The two sides dont synchronize  
Youre nothing like anyone Ive ever seen before  
If Im staring at you then I apologize  
You defy every rule Ive learned  
But still Ive never been half so turned on  
And youre just so easy  
Youre so damned easy on the eyes  
  
Handsomes not a word that comes to mind  
But Id have to be blind to try and minimize  
How easy you are on the eyes  
Easy on the eyes  
In my vertigo  
Youre easy on the eyes  
From head to toe  
Youre so easy on the eyes  
  
Im operating without a license  
But Im willing to pay the price  
And youre just so easy  
Youre just so damn easy on the eyes
