Ive been trying  
Theres no denying  
Its sending me  
Out of my mind  
  
Ive seen reason  
Change to treason  
Its losing its sense  
Of all kind  
  
How much longer will it take  
For the world to see  
We should learn to live  
And simply let it be  
Bloodstone bloodstone  
  
In the night time  
Wake in fright  
Im so scared of the game  
Thats being played  
Start to wonder  
Whats going under  
And how many deals  
Have been made  
  
Bloodstone  
I cant take it  
You got me living  
On a bloodstone  
I dont want that bloodstone
