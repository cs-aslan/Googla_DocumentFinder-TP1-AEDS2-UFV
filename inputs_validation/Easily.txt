Easily lets get carried away  
Easily lets get married today  
Shao Lin shouted a rose  
From his throat  
Everything must go  
A lickin stick is thicker  
When you break it to show  
Everything must go  
  
The story of a woman on the morning of a war  
Remind me if you will exactly what were fighting for  
  
Calling calling for something in the air  
Calling calling I know you must be there  
  
Easily lets get caught in a wave  
Easily we wont get caught in a cage  
Shao Lin shakin for the sake  
Of his soul Everything must go  
Lookin mighty tired of  
All the things that you own  
Everything must go  
  
I cant tell you who to idolize  
You think its almost over  
But its only on the rise  
Calling calling  
For something in the air  
Calling calling I know you must be there  
  
The story of a woman on the morning of a war  
Remind me if you will exactly what were fighting for  
  
Throw me to the wolves  
Because theres order in the pack  
Throw me to the sky  
Because I know Im coming back  
  
Shao Lin shakin for the sake  
Of his soul Everything must go  
Lookin mighty tired of  
All the things that you own  
Everything must go  
  
The story of a woman on the morning of a war  
Remind me if you will exactly what were fighting for  
  
Calling calling for something in the air  
Calling calling I know you must be there  
  
I dont want to be your little research monkey boy  
The creature that I am is only going to destroy  
  
Throw me to the wolves  
Because theres order in the pack  
Throw me to the sky  
Because I know Im coming back
