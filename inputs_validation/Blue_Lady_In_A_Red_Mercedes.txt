Theres a blue lady  
In a red mercedes  
Driving down from her big house on the hill  
With her mind on fire  
For an old desire  
And sweet memories bring on the tears  
  
And that blue lady  
Would give that red mercedes  
All the money and big house so fine  
Just to feel him touch her one more time  
  
Shes sewn and reeped  
And now shes gotta sleep  
In empty arms tonight  
All night shes got her little paradise  
But shes a lonely wife  
If that old flame could burn again  
Would it justify the sin  
I think it would considering the shape her heart is in  
  
And that blue lady  
Would give that red mercedes  
All the money and big house so fine  
Just to feel him touch her one more time  
  
Just to feel him touch her  
Just to feel him touch her  
Just to feel him touch her one more time
