I live on an island far away  
All by myself theres no one else  
Nobody calls but thats okay  
Dont need their help Im by myself  
Nobody here to make a career  
Of hurting me deserting me  
Your crazy life aint ever gonna get me  
Dont worry about my recovery  
Cause lover you wont recover me  
Im not too low Im not too high  
Ill get by makin my recovery  
When I go wrong as people do  
Theres only me to answer to  
Nobody here to bring me down  
No feelings I need step around  
Trouble and care are waiting out there  
But Im alright Im safe tonight  
Your crazy life aint ever gonna get me  
Dont worry about my recovery  
Cause lover you wont recover me  
Im not too low Im not too high  
Ill get by makin my recovery  
Dont need your sympathy save all your tears  
Ive lived without tenderness for too many years  
Why would I need it now  
Nobody here to make a career  
Of hurting me deserting me  
Your crazy life aint ever gonna get me  
Dont worry about my recovery  
Cause lover you wont recover me  
Im not too low Im not too high  
Ill get by makin my recovery
