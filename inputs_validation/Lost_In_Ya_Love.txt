Can you hear me now  
  
Verse 1  
Yeah  
Sweet like honey dew  
I love it when you come around  
Its just me and you girl  
And you  
  
PreChorus  
Her fragrance turns me on  
Her skins so soft oh  
I just wanna hold you  
All night and day  
And we got all the time girl  
So come a little closer  
Cause I just wanna hold you  
All night and day  
Im thinking bout you all day all night  
Im holding on tight  
Baby I just cant let you go  
  
  
Chorus x2  
I get lost in ya love  
I get wrapped in the words you say  
I get lost in the love we make  
I even fall hard for the games you play  
  
Verse 2  
Baby youre the truth  
I wanna talk about your loving  
Im so connected to you  
I want it all I need it all from you girl  
Youre my only one and you know that  
I hold it down cause I own that  
Too much history we go way back  
Its so personal and we got that  
  
PreChorus  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Bridge  
Run it back run it back run it back  
Oh this my favorite song  
And shout out to the DJ  
Cause he gon play this record all night long  
  
PreChorus  
  
Chorus x2
