Oh boy youre starry eyed  
Lay back baby lay back  
Youve got heaven in your eyes  
I like that boy I like that  
  
Life doesnt always work out  
Like you planned it  
They say make lemonade out of lemons  
But I try and I just cant understand it  
All this trying for no good reason  
Man makes plans and God laughs  
Why do I even bother to ask  
Well once you and I we were the king and queen of this town  
It doesnt matter now  
The sun set on our love bye baby  
Oh boy youre starry eyed  
Lay back baby lay back  
Youve got heaven in your eyes  
I like that boy I like that  
Life doesnt always work out  
Like you planned it  
They say make lemonade out of lemons  
But I try and I cant understand it  
All this bragging for not good reason  
Man makes plans and God laughs  
Why do I even bother to ask  
Well once you and I we were the king and queen of this town  
It doesnt matter now  
The sun set on our love bye bye baby  
Oh boy youre starry eyed  
Lay back baby lay back  
Youve got heaven in your eyes  
I like that boy I like that  
It doesnt matter what they say  
Lets go do it anyway  
Cause you and I have an undying kind of love  
You can be mine Ill be yours be my baby  
Oh boy youre starry eyed  
Lay back baby lay back  
Youve got heaven in your eyes  
I like that boy I like that  
Oh boy youre starry eyed  
Lay back baby lay back  
Youve got heaven in your eyes  
I like that boy I like that
