She leads a lonely life  
She leads a lonely life  
  
When she woke up late in the morning  
Light and the day had just begun  
She opened up her eyes and thought  
O what a morning  
Its not a day for work  
Its a day for catching sun  
Just laying on the beach and having fun  
Shes going to get you  
  
All that she wants is another baby  
Shes gone tomorrow boy  
All that she wants is another baby  
All that she wants is another baby  
Shes gone tomorrow boy  
All that she wants is another baby  
  
All that she wants all that she wants  
  
So if you are in sight and the day is right  
Shes a hunter youre the fox  
The gentle voice that talks to you  
Wont talk forever  
Its a night for passion  
But the morning means goodbye  
Beware of that is flashing in her eyes  
Shes going to get you  
  
All that she wants
