Born from silence silence full of it  
A perfect concert my best friend  
So much to live for so much to die for  
If only my heart had a home  
  
Sing what you cant say  
Forget what you cant play  
Hasten to drown into beautiful eyes  
Walk within my poetry this dying music  
My love letter to nobody  
  
Never sigh for better world  
Its already composed played and told  
Every thought the music I write  
Everything a wish for the night  
  
Wrote for the eclipse wrote for the virgin  
Died for the beauty the one in the garden  
Created a kingdom reached for the wisdom  
Failed in becoming a god  
  
Never sigh  
  
If you read this line remember not the hand that wrote it  
Remember only the verse songmakers cry the one without tears  
For Ive given this its strength and it has become my only strength  
Comforting home mothers lap chance for immortality  
Where being wanted became a thrill I never knew  
The sweet piano writing down my life  
  
Teach me passion for I fear its gone  
Show me love hold the lorn  
So much more I wanted to give to the ones who love me  
Im sorry  
Time will tell this bitter farewell  
I live no more to shame nor me nor you  
  
And you I wish I didnt feel for you anymore  
  
A lonely soul an ocean soul
