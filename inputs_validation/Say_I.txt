Say I  
I  
Say I  
I  
  
If you wanna a brand new shiny car say I  
If youre sick of songs about broken hearts say I  
If you spent some nights parkin at the noon  
If you dont like being told what to do  
  
Say I  
I  
I gotta have some thing to hang my dreams upon  
Say I  
I  
Im gonna keep rockin until Im dead and gone  
  
If you turn up the radio too loud say I  
If make the tilt the world spin round say I  
If you love a lil more to spend the cash  
But you hate takin out the Tuesday trash  
  
Say I  
I  
I gotta have some thing to hang my dreams upon  
Say I  
I  
Im gonna keep rockin until Im dead and gone  
  
Worry aint worth half the time it takes  
I dont wanna think about a thing  
  
Say I  
I  
Say I  
I  
  
If you hate when a friend goes Hollywood say I  
Sometimes feel like gettin nothin no good say I  
If you think youre wrong but you know youre right  
You wont back down without a fight  
  
Say I  
I  
I gotta have some thing to hang my dreams upon  
Say I  
I  
Im gonna keep rockin until Im dead and gone  
Say I say I  
  
Oh say I  
I  
I gotta have some thing to hang my dreams upon  
Say I  
I  
Im gonna keep rockin until Im dead and gone  
  
Say I  
I I  
Say I  
I  
  
Say I  
I I  
Say I  
I  
  
I  
I I  
Say I  
I  
  
Say I say I  
Say I I
