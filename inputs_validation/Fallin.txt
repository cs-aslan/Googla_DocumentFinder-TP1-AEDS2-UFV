Im afraid to fly  
And I dont know why  
Im jealous of the people who  
Are not afraid to die  
Its just that I recall  
Back when I was small  
Someone promised that theyd catch  
But then theyd let me fall  
  
And now Im fallin  
Fallin fast again  
Why do I always take a fall  
When I fall in love  
  
You think by now Ive learned  
Play with fire youd get burned  
But fire can be oh so warm  
And thats why I return  
Turn and walk away  
Thats what I should do  
My head says go and find the door  
My heart says Ill find you  
  
And now Im fallin  
Catch me if you can  
Maybe this time Ill have it all  
When I fall in love  
  
It always turns out the same  
Loving someone Loving someone Losing myself  
I only got me to blame  
  
Help me Im fallin  
Fallin catch me if you can  
Maybe this time Ill have it all  
Maybe Ill make it afterall  
Maybe this time I wont fall  
When I fall in love
