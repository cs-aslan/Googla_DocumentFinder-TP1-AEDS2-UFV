Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine  
Im leavin my life in your hands  
People say Im crazy and that I am blind  
Risking it all in a glance  
And how you got me blind is still a mystery  
I cant get you out of my head  
Dont care what is written in your history  
As long as youre here with me  
  
I dont care who you are  
Where youre from  
What you did  
As long as you love me  
Who you are  
Where youre from  
Dont care what you did  
As long as you love me  
  
Every little thing that you have said and done  
Feels like its deep within me  
Doesnt really matter if youre on the run  
It seems like were meant to be  
  
I dont care who you are who you are  
Where youre from where youre from  
What you did  
As long as you love me I dont know  
Who you are who you are  
Where youre from where youre from  
Dont care what you did  
As long as you love me yeah  
  
Ive tried to hide it so that no one knows  
But I guess it shows  
When you look into my eyes  
What you did and where youre comin from  
I dont care as long as you love me baby  
  
I dont care who you are who you are  
Where youre from where youre from  
What you did  
As long as you love me as long as you love me  
Who you are who you are  
Where youre from where youre from  
Dont care what you did yeah  
As long as you love me as long as you love me  
Who you are who you are  
Where youre from  
What you did  
As long as you love me  
Who you are who you are  
Where youre from where youre from  
As long as you love me  
Who you are  
As long as you love me  
What you did I dont care  
As long as you love me
