Your head  
You will lose it  
Severed  
When executed  
  
You always thought  
Youd never get caught  
  
Decapitate  
Sealing your fate  
  
Rebels  
Futile efforts  
Are quelled  
With effective measures  
  
The sentence is read  
Word that you dread  
  
Decapitate  
Walk through Hells gate  
  
Youve lost your head sir  
Well you will tomorrow  sleep well  
  
This courts  
Best deterrent  
To set  
New precendents  
  
The verdict of course  
Couldnt be worse  
  
Decapitate  
Example be made  
  
Decapitate  
Will seal your fate
