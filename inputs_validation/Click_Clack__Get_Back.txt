Ice Cube  
Yeah yo check it

I talk shit for insane niggas  
I got a clip for you strange niggas  
Click clack get back fore you niggas feel that  
  
Ice Cube  
Understand I come from South Central  
Motherfuckers dont know what I been through  
I keep my motherfuckin heat in my igloo  
And its lookin for some meat it can get through  
Fuck with me there will be agony  
In these streets it will be a tragedy  
Cant you see it aint no fag in me

Kaplow Im fuckin mo niggas than Napster  
Cause youse a trick and your Ghost Rider is Casper  
I heard you lost on Fear Factor  
Cause you couldnt swallow deez nuts big as a tractor  
You dumb bitch think Im an actor  
And a nigga couldnt get close enough to slap her  
Ice Cube understand its real

Got my nigga a deal he tried to fuck me and steal  
I love the nigga but he now feelin the chill

North side North side lets ride lets ride  
Lets do it till God and the devil collide cmon
