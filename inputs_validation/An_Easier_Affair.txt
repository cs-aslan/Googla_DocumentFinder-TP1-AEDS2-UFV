Here comes one for the ladies  
For the ones who love me  
To think I thought I could be some kind of family man  
I told myself I was straight  
But I shouldnt have worried  
Cos my Maker had a better plan for me  
  
And Im dancing with the freaks now  
Im havin Im havin so much fun  
What you sow is what you reap now  
Ill do my dance with everyone  
Ive been getting too much Sun  
Yes Im dancin with the freaks now  
Were havin were havin too much fun for them  
Look whos talking Guilty feet now  
  
Well let me tell you people  
Its an easier affair  
Not living my life with other people on my mind  
No got nothing to hide from anyone  
Yes Im walking on new air  
Just living my life  
Better believe Im gonna get whats mine  
See I dont have the time  
For the haters  
  
And all the time that I wasted  
How careless of me  
Too young and stupid to see  
I put my life in their hands  
Gonna look for Cupid man  
Oh and I know that they want me to hate them  
Theres no hurry  
Ill just have to be the bigger man  
  
Dancin with the freaks now  
Im havin Im havin so much fun  
What you sow is what you reap now  
Ill do my dance with everyone  
Ive been getting too much Sun  
If I turn the other cheek now  
Would that be would that be too much fun for them  
Look whos talking  
Guilty feet now  
  
Well let me tell you people  
Its an easier affair  
Not livin my life with other people on my mind  
No got nothing to hide from anyone  
Cos Im walking on new air  
Just living my life  
Better believe Im gonna get whats mine  
See I dont have the time for the haters  
  
Dont let them tell you who you are is not enough  
Dont let them tell you that its wrong  
Or that you wont find love  
  
Dont let them use my life to put your future down  
Dont let them tell you that happiness cant be found  
  
For my life  
  
Take it to the streets  
There are stories you can keep  
Theyre just passing you by  
  
Dont let them tell you who you are is not enough  
Dont let them tell you that its wrong  
Or that you wont find love  
  
Dont let them use my life to put your future down  
Dont let them tell you that happiness cant be found
