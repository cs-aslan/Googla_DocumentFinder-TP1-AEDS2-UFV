I found your hairband on my bedroom floor  
The only evidence that youve been here before  
And I dont get waves of missing you anymore  
Theyre more like tsunami tides in my eyes  
Never getting dry so I get high smoke in the day then I sleep with the light
on  
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye  
And Im still drunk by the end of the night  
I dont drink like everybody else  
End up forgetting things about myself  
Im stubborn Im forward heads just blocked  
My heads still with you but my hearts just not  
  
So am I close to you anymore if its over  
And theres no chance that well work it out  
Thats why you and I ended over UNI  
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over UNI  
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied  
  
Everybody said that well be together forever but I know that  
I never wanna settle down come around break up the love like Lego now  
Never wanna turn into another like you  
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views  
Everythings great but everythings short  
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus  
Now Im in position to be another stalker  
And every thing I say seems to always sound awkward  
Like our last kiss it was perfect but we were nervous  
On the surface  
And Im always saying everyday that it was worth it  
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts  
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative  
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss  
  
So am I close to you anymore if its over  
And theres no chance that well work it out  
Oh you and I ended over UNI  
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over UNI  
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied  
  
Because if I was gonna go somewhere Id be there by now  
And maybe I can let myself down oh  
And thinking I am unaware I keep my feet on the ground  
Keep looking around to make sure Im not he only one to feel low  
Because if you want Ill take you in my arms  
And keep you sheltered from all that Ive done wrong  
And I know youll say that Im the only one  
But I know that god made another one of me  
To love you better than I ever will  
  
Cause you and I ended over UNI  
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over UNI  
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied
