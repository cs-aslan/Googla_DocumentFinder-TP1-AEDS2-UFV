War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And love means nothing in some strange quarters  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And I heard them banging on hearts and fingers  
War  
  
People fill the world with narrow confidence  
Like a child at birth a man with no defence  
Whats mines my own I wont give it to you  
No matter what you say no matter what you do  
  
Now were fighting in our hearts  
Fighting in the streets  
Wont somebody help me  
  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And love means nothing in some strange quarters  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And I heard them banging on hearts and fingers  
War  
  
Man is far behind in the search of something new  
Like a Philistine were burning witches too  
This world of hate must be designed for you  
It matters what you say it matters what you do  
  
Now were fighting in our hearts  
Fighting in the streets  
Wont somebody help me  
  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And love means nothing in some strange quarters  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And I heard them banging on hearts and fingers  
War War War  
  
After the bird has flown  
He walked ten thousand miles back home  
You cant do that to me no you cant do that to me  
You cant do that to me no you cant do that to me  
  
War  
  
In this heart of mine Ill find a place for you  
For black or white for grownup children too  
  
Now were fighting in our hearts  
Fighting in the streets  
Wont somebody help me  
  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And love means nothing in some strange quarters  
War war is stupid and people are stupid  
And I heard them banging on hearts and fingers  
  
No more war  
say no more war  
say war  
Senso hantai  
Senso hantai  
Say no more war
