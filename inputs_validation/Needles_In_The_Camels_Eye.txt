Those who know  
They dont let it show  
They just give you one long life  
And you go oh oh oh oh  
  
Goes to show  
How winds blow  
The weathers fine  
And I feel so soso so  
  
Birds of prey  
With too much to say  
Oh what could be my destiny  
Another rainy day  
  
Why ask why  
For by the by and by  
All mysteries are just more  
Needles in the camels eye  
  
Those who know  
They dont let it show  
They just give you one long life  
And you go oh oh oh oh  
  
Why ask why  
For by the by and by  
All mysteries are just more  
Needles in the camels eye
