As I leave behind Neidin  
Its like purple splashed on green  
My soul is strangely fed  
Through the winding hills ahead  
And she plays a melody  
On wind and streams for me  
Wont you remember  
Wont you remember  
Wont you remember me  
And we wind and climb and fall  
Like the greatest waltz of all  
Float across the floor  
Her sweet breath outside the door  
And its time that I was gone  
Cross the silver tear  
Wont you remember  
Wont you remember  
Wont you remember me  
Wont you remember  
Wont you remember  
Wont you remember me  
As I leave behind Neidin  
In the hall where we have been  
Rhododendrons in your hair  
In the mountain scented air  
I still feel her spirit song  
Cross the silver tear  
Wont you remember  
Wont you remember  
Wont you remember me  
Wont you remember  
Wont you remember  
Wont you remember me  
I leave behind Neidin
