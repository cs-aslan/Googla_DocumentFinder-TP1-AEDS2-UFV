I dont see me in your eyes anymore  
oh why cant I make them shine as before  
I dont see you or your heart in your kiss  
when you should sigh that your mine you resist  
  
There was a time life was fine love was ecstasy  
but now I doubt what the outcome will be  
I pray youll say Im the one you adore  
then Ill see me in your eyes as before  
  
I pray youll say Im the one you adore  
Then Ill see me in your eyes as before
