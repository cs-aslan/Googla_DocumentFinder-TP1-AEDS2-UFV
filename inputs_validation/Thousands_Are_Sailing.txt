The island it is silent now  
But the ghosts still haunt the waves  
And the torch lights up a famished man  
Who fortune could not save  
  
Did you work upon the railroad  
Did you rid the streets of crime  
Were your dollars from the white house  
Were they from the five and dime  
  
Did the old songs taunt or cheer you  
And did they still make you cry  
Did you count the months and years  
Or did your teardrops quickly dry  
  
Ah no says he twas not to be  
On a coffin ship I came here  
And I never even got so far  
That they could change my name  
  
Thousands are sailing  
Across the western ocean  
To a land of opportunity  
That some of them will never see  
Fortune prevailing  
Across the western ocean  
Their bellies full  
Their spirits free  
Theyll break the chains of poverty  
And theyll dance  
  
In Manhattans desert twilight  
In the death of afternoon  
We stepped hand in hand on broadway  
Like the first man on the moon  
  
And the blackbird broke the silence  
As you whistled it so sweet  
And in Brendan Behans footsteps  
I danced up and down the street  
  
Then we said goodnight to broadway  
Giving it our best regards  
Tipped our hats to mister Cohen  
Dear old times squares favorite bard  
  
Then we raised a glass to JFK  
And a dozen more besides  
When I got back to my empty room  
I suppose I must have cried  
  
Thousands are sailing  
Again across the ocean  
Where the hand of opportunity  
Draws tickets in a lottery  
Postcards were mailing  
Of skyblue skies and oceans  
From rooms the daylight never sees  
Where lights dont glow on Christmas trees  
But we dance to the music  
And we dance  
  
Thousands are sailing  
Across the western ocean  
Where the hand of opportunity  
Draws tickets in a lottery  
Where eer we go we celebrate  
The land that makes us refugees  
From fear of priests with empty plates  
From guilt and weeping effigies  
And we dance
