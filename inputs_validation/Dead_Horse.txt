Sick of this life  
Not that youd care  
Im not the only one with  
Whom these feelings I share  
  
Nobody understands  
Quite why were here  
Were searchin for answers  
That never appear  
  
But maybe if I looked real hard Id  
Id see your tryin too  
To understand this life  
That were all goin through  
Then when she said she was gonna like wreck my car  
I didnt know what to do  
  
Sometimes I feel like Im beatin a dead horse  
An I dont know why youd be bringin me down  
Id like to think that our loves worth a tad more  
It may sound funny but youd think by now  
Id be smilin  
I guess some things never change  
Never change  
  
I met an old cowboy  
I saw the look in his eyes  
Somethin tells me hes been here before  
Cause experience makes you wise  
I was only a small child  
When the thought first came to me  
That Im a son of a gun and the gun of a son  
That brought back the devil in me  
  
Sometimes I feel like Im beatin a dead horse  
An I dont know why youd be bringin me down  
Id like to think that our loves worth a tad more  
It may sound funny but youd think by now  
Id be smilin  
I guess some things never change  
Never change  
  
I aint quite what youd call an old soul  
Still wet behind the ears  
I been around this track a couple o times  
But now the dust is startin to clear  
Oh yeah  
  
Sometimes I feel like Im beatin a dead horse  
An I dont know why youd be bringin me down  
Id like to think that our loves worth a tad more  
It may sound funny but youd think by now  
Id be smilin  
Ooh yeah Id be smilin  
No way Id be smilin  
Ooh smilin
