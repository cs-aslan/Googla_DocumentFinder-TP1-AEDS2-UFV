Black hole paradise found  
Somthing so dark and something so bright  
Blue skies over our head  
Why the hell is everything turning out gray  
  
All things are not what they seem  
The man behind the curtain is probably mean  
  
Deep six keeps the population down  
Broke and soaking wet floating around  
Keep your head down keep your voice down  
Ohh listen to the sound  
All the races all the faces  
Just might find a winner lying on the ground  
  
Learn to take it meditate it  
Cant fake it now  
From the cradle youve been labeled  
About as stable as a drunk on shaky ground  
  
Blind luck stumbling into a tree  
Wouldve passed by if I could have seen  
Got no cares I never felt pressed  
I wonder what theyre getting for a pound of flesh  
Hunker down now throwing a shoe  
Dogs new tricks Something they cant use  
  
Deep six keeps the population down  
Broke and soaking wet floating around  
Keep your head down keep your voice down  
Ohh listen to the sound  
All the faces you cant shake em now now  
Just might find a winner lying on the ground  
  
Learn to take it try to shake it  
All the faces you cant shake em now now  
From the cradle youve been labeled  
About as stable as a drunk on shaky ground
