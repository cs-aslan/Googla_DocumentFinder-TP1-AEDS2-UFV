I dont know if I told you but Im seeking sanctuary  
Youll never guess the things that I do  
Ill have the devil round for tea  
Dont you know that Im here beside you  
Cant you see that I cant relax  
When I saw you in my rearview  
You couldve stopped me in my tracks  
  
Ill be there for you when you want me to  
Ill stand by your side like I always do  
In the dead of night itll be alright  
cause Ill be there for you when you want me to  
  
You can take me to an island ride across the stormy sea  
We can worship pagan idols there together you and me  
Why dont you run over here and rescue me  
You can drive down in your car  
Why dont we both take a ride and turn that key  
Well drive at 60 miles an hour  
  
Ill be there for you when you want me to  
Ill stand by your side like I always do  
In the dead of night itll be alright  
cause Ill be there for you when you want me to  
  
Ill be there for you when you want me to  
Ill stand by your side like I always do  
In the dead of night itll be alright  
cause Ill be there for you when you want me to  
  
Ill be there for you when you want me to  
Ill stand by your side like I always do  
In the dead of night itll be alright  
cause Ill be there for you when you want me to  
  
Ill be there for you when you want me to  
Ill stand by your side like I always do  
In the dead of night itll be alright  
cause Ill be there for you when you want me to
