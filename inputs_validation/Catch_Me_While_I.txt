Verse 1  
How many times have you sat across from me  
And how many times have you told me you were leavin  
Im no tryin to listen cause its all the same  
And why why are you constantly believing  
That I I could ever give you what youre needing  
Baby baby please dont put your faith in me  
I dont know what to say  
Cause its all a dream to me anyway  
  
Chorus  
You can catch me while  
Im sleepin darlin  
While Im dreamin too  
Its a lonely lonely lonely place  
For me baby  
It must get lonely for you too  
  
Verse 2  
People always fallin  
In and out of love and  
It can be pretty painful too  
And maybe Oh maybe Im just not strong enough  
Sad but true  
So tell me whats the use  
  
Oh Oh You can catch me while  
Im sleepin darlin  
Maybe While Im dreamin too  
Cause Its a lonely lonely lonely place  
For me baby  
It must get lonely for you too  
  
Chorus Out
