Slipping past the chimneypots  
Down among the ashes away from old times  
Why must I selfindulge in memories  
I should be celebrating to a moving melody  
But it hurts me it hurts me  
Honey honey it hurts me  
And Im feeling like a waltz  
Growing old  old old old old  
I was fiery but you put me out  
I was always one for loving and leaving  
I like to think I was immune to romance  
I should be laughing at some good old comedy  
Oh but it hurts me it hurts me  
Honey honey it hurts me  
And Im feeling like a waltz   
If you laughed at me Id laugh too  
Waltz dont you know that Id be really breakining  
Lamourmarche avec un etranger  
I shouldnt care youre not my darling anymore  
But it hurts me it hurts me  
Honey honey honey honey  
And Im feeling like a waltz  
Growing old old old old old
