Uhhuh ehheh  
Lay back on this one yeah you know how I do baby  
  
You only a customer  
When you walkin in the presence of hustlers  
Uh Im laid back in the cinnamon Range  
Two decades and aint a damn thing changed  
Keep my girl in strawberry swirls  
You can taste it my insticts basic  
Lord have mercy sweet like Hershey  
Kisses diamonds for the misses ices on the wristes  
All different colors of the spectrum  
The smallest flaw and I reject em  
Believe me Im a connoisseur when I inspect em  
I baguettes them invisibly sets them  
They call me big Lly Wonka from Compton to Yonkers  
Them ChiTown steppers and them ATown stompers  
These young rookies fail to understand  
Every sumer I return like the ice cream man  
Drop what you doin getit getit while you can  
By the eighth by the ounce when its gone Ima bounce  
Its the FLAV no ifs or maybes  
You know what I do drive your taste buds crazy  
  
Chorus  
Like lemon drops with chocolate kisses  
Every bite is more delicious  
My favorite flavor  
Mix me and you and we cant go wrong  
Like caramel on vanilla sundae  
Have a scoop youll want some day  
Cause youre my favorite flavor  
Cmon baby baby cmon cmon  
  
My flavors unreal  
Smooth but hard like wood grain on the wheel  
Recline your seat baby enjoy how it feel  
Why you crossin your legs them high heels of eel  
Kick off your shoes run your toes on the dash  
Now peel off your stockings cmon lets get it poppin  
Im in the mood for cotton candy and Im plottin  
To see you in somethin silky and seethrough  
Me too Man you know how we do  
Camcorder main feature damn a preview  
I love how the bottom on your bodys EQ  
Low but thick though like the base in a sixfo  
So here we go here we go we bunny hoppin  
I hit the switches baby you keep it droppin  
It feels marvelous you in charge of this  
I hope you aint heartless but my guards now regardless  
  
Chorus  
  
Uh All I wanna do  
Is eat you up cause you look so good  
Think I look alright huh  
I look better on you whatchu really wanna do  
All I wanna do  
Is show you boy that I taste good too  
I know you taste good ma  
Whatchu sayin want a sprinkle of the hood ha Ha  
  
We had it out  
Now tell your girls the truth when they ask what Im about  
The cookies and the cream and the peaches n praline  
Butter pecan themes in your daydreams  
All real sugar no saccarhine  
Low calorie leave no cavities  
Guaranteed no place youd rather be  
Than here with me mix chocolate in the factory  
  
Chorus  
  
Babee
