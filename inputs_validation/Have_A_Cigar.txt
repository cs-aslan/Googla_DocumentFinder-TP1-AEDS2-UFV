Come in here dear boy have a cigar  
Youre gonna go far  
Youre gonna fly high  
Youre never gonna die  
Youre gonna make it if you try  
Theyre gonna love you  
  
Well Ive always had a deep respect  
And I mean that most sincerely  
The band is just fantastic  
That is really what I think  
Oh by the way which ones Pink  
  
And did we tell you the name of the game boy  
We call it Riding the Gravy Train  
  
Were just knocked out  
We heard about the sell out  
You gotta get an album out  
You owe it to the people  
Were so happy we can hardly count  
  
Everyone else is just green  
Have you seen the chart  
Its a helluva start  
It could be made into a monster  
If we all pull together as a team  
  
And did we tell you the name of the game boy  
We call it Riding the Gravy Train
