Oh Glenn  
Dont come to the house tonight  
Oh Glenn  
Oh Glenn  
Dont come to the house tonight  
Oh Glenn  
Because theres somebody here  
Who really really loves you  
Oh Glenn  
  
Stay home  
Be bored  
Its crap I know  
Tonight  
  
Oh Glenn  
Oh Glenn  
Dont come to the house tonight  
Oh Glenn  
Oh Glenn  
Dont come to the house tonight  
Because theres somebody here  
Wholl take a hatchet to your ear  
The frustration it renders me  
Hateful oh  
  
Oh dont come to the house tonight  
Oh dont come to the house tonight  
Because youll slip on the  
Trail of all my sad remains  
Thats why thats why  
Goodbye my love goodbye my love  
Goodbye my love goodbye my love  
Goodbye my love goodbye my love  
  
Belch
