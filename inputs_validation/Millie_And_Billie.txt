Billie I wonder why are we insane  
Will we ever get better  
Will we stay the same  
Billie Im worried  
  
Millie dont worry  
No one knows our pain  
Being in love is crazy not alone that way  
I know youre worried today  
  
God made love crazy so he wouldnt feel alone  
He was thinking of us he was thinking of us  
God made love crazy so he wouldnt feel so alone  
  
Billie my mind seems to wander  
To events of a night long ago  
Driving alone with our guilt well concealed  
In the trunk of your 68 Olds  
  
Millie our worlds an asylum  
And our minds like you say aint that straight  
But you know and I know our passions  
Not deformed its true to say  
Well love our lifetime  
  
God made love crazy so he wouldnt feel alone  
He was thinking of us he was thinking of us  
God made love crazy so he wouldnt feel so alone  
  
Billie I dream of our children  
Theyre frightening and gruesome and sad  
And I dont want them growing inside me  
Theyre no price for the love that we have  
  
Oh Millie oh Billie criminally insane  
Oh Millie oh Billie  
  
Oh Billie its fresh in my memory  
The night that it had to be done  
You with your pick axe and scissors  
And you with your shovel and gun  
  
And I liked your late husband Donald  
But such torture his memory brings  
All sliced up and sealed tight in baggies  
Guess love makes you do funny things  
  
Oh Millie oh Billie criminally insane  
Oh Millie oh Billie
