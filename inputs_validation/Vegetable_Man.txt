In yellow shoes I get the blues  
Though I walk the streets with my plastic feet  
With my blue velvet trousers make me feel pink  
Theres a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers  
In my paisley shirt I look a jerk  
And my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight  
But oh oh my haircut looks so bad  
Vegetable man how are you  
So Ive changed my dear and I find my knees  
And I covered them up with the latest cut  
And my pants and socks all point in a box  
They dont make long of my nylon socks  
The watch black watch  
My watch with a black face  
And a big pin a little hole  
And all the lot is what I got  
Its what I wear its what you see  
It must be me its what I am  
Vegetable man  
Ive been looking all over the place for a place for me  
But it aint anywhere it just aint anywhere  
Vegetable man vegetable man  
Hes the kind of person you just gonna see him if you can  
Vegetable man
