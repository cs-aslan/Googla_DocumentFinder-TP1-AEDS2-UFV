Baby youve got the sort of hands to rip me apart  
And baby youve got the sort of face to start this old heart  
But your eyes are warning me this early morning  
That my loves too big for you my love  
  
Baby youve got the sort of laugh that waters me  
And makes me grow tall and strong and proud and flattens me  
I find you stunning but you are running me down  
My loves too big for you my love  
My loves too big for you my love  
  
And if I was stronger then I would tell you no  
And if I was stronger then I will leave this show  
And if I was stronger then I would up and go  
But here I am and here we go again  
  
Baby youve got the sort of eyes that tell me tales  
That your sort of mouth just will not say the truth impales  
That you dont need me but you wont leave me  
My loves too big for you my love  
My loves too big for you my love  
  
And if I was stronger then I would tell you no  
And if I was stronger then I will leave this show  
And if I was stronger then I would up and go  
But here I am and here we go again  
  
Tell me what to do to take away the you  
  
And if I was stronger then I would tell you no  
And if I was stronger then I will leave this show  
And if I was stronger then I would up and go  
But here I am and here we go again
