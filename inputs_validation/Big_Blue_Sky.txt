  
Come On baby take a look outside its a big blue sky  
  
We didnt listen when they tried to tell us we were to young to know  
They tried to slow us down but we always found another way to go  
Before you know it we were waving goodbye driving away  
off into the big blue sky  
We went out lookin for the best jobs kids like us could get  
We got hired and fired and worn out tired but we never quit  
To dumb to worry or wonder why  
we were chasing our lives off into the big blue sky  
  
Chorus  
I guess we were just  
nothin but a big blue sky  
  
Weve had earthquakes twisters hurricanes tidlewaves and hail down n our
heads  
Weve been knocke down sucked in  
spun round shaken up thrown away  
and left for dead  
but somehow we always made it out alive  
on the other side of the Big Blue Sky  
  
Chorus  
Maybe we were just crazy enough  
to try and out run the rain  
The storms weve been through just proved that we can make it through
anything  
youll never see how good it can be  
until you spread your wings and fly  
baby take look at our lives its nothing but a  
Big Blue Sky  
  
Its nothin but a big blue sky  
  
Baby lookin back  
everthing they said  
Like how we wouldnt last how far wed never get  
Its a great big lie  
aint nothin over head  
nothin but a big blue sky  
  
Chorus  
Maybe we were just crazy enough  
to try and out run the rain  
The storms weve been through just proved that we can make it through
anything  
youll never see how good it can be  
until you spread your wings and fly  
baby look at our lives  
Take a look at our lives  
Yeah look at our lives  
Its nothin but a Big blue Sky  
  
Nothin but a big blue sky  
  
Its a big blue sky
