Ships are moving closer to the shoreline  
And were laughing in the face of loaded guns  
I saw it on the news we aint got no worry  
But it wont be in the paper when D Day comes  
  
Lord Have Mercy  
For we know not what we do  
Have Mercy  
Weve forgotten to be afraid of you  
  
Who can solve the problems of a nation  
We cure the symptoms but were killed by the disease  
I feel Ive more than made my contribution  
But I hope theres room in heaven for my ego and me  
  
Lord Have Mercy  
For we know not what we do  
Have Mercy  
Weve forgotten to be afraid of you  
Have Mercy  
Lend us your hand  
Lord Have Mercy  
Give us just another chance  
  
Too many coaches on the sideline  
Too many keepers in the zoo  
How will we know weve passed the deadline  
Give us the strength to stand or fall  
God in heaven Have Mercy on us all  
  
The ships are even closer to the shoreline  
Now were playing in a madmans house of fun  
I read it in the news we aint got no worry  
But it wont be in the paper when D Day comes  
  
Lord Have mercy
