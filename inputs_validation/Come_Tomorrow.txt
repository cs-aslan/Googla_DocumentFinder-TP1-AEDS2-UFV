About the time Im eight years old  
I met the Devil kept my soul  
Walkin out on lakes of fire and Im gone  
Walkin in a wonderland  
And I dont really understand  
The place Im comin to right now today  
  
Chorus  
Come tomorrow you could see the light  
Come tomorrow break it right down to the place you were before  
  
Fifteen years on down the line  
I guess youd say Im doin fine  
Wandering down that same old road again  
Walkin in a wonderland  
But Alice doesnt understand  
The place shes comin to right now today  
  
Chorus  
  
On your knees youll be begging me please  
As you feel the disease  
Youre going down again tonight  
  
See me runnin watch me fall  
I guess youd say Ive finally found my own  
See me cryin and wonder why  
I guess youd say its time to die today  
  
Chorus
