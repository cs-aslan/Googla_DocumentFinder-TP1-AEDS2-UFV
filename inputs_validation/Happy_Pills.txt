Trying to pick up the pace  
Trying to make it so I never see your face again  
Trying to throw this away  
Want to make sure that you never waste my time again  
  
How does it feel  
Oh how does it feel  
To be you right now dear  
You brought this upon  
So pick up your piece and go away from here  
  
Please just let me go now  
Please just let me go  
Would you please just let me go now  
Please just let me go  
  
Im going to get you out  
Im going to get you out  
Im going to get you out of my head  
Get out  
  
Im going to get you out  
Im going to get you out  
Im going to get you out of my head  
Get out  
  
Never said wed be friends  
Trying to keep myself away from you  
Cause youre bad bad news  
  
With you gone Im alive  
Makes me feel like I took happy pills  
And time stood still  
  
How does it feel  
Oh how does it feel to be the one shut out  
You broke all the rules  
I wont be a fool for you no more my dear  
  
Please just let me go now  
Please just let me go  
Would you please just let me go now  
Please just let me go  
  
Im going to get you out  
Im going to get you out  
Im going to get you out of my head  
Get out  
  
Im going to get you out  
Im going to get you out  
Im going to get you out of my head  
Get out
