Well I went to see my woman  
Way back down on the farm  
Went to see my woman  
Way back on the farm  
Sundowns gonna catch me  
In my sweet babys arms  
She likes to rock  
She likes to roll  
She likes to  
Push push push to the stroll  
Down down down down  
Down behind the barn  
Sundowns gonna catch me  
In my sweet babys arms  
You know we went up on the mountain  
Looked down on the sea  
Went up on the mountain  
And we looked down on the sea  
You know sundowns gonna catch me  
Lovin my sweet baby  
She likes to rock  
She likes to roll  
She likes to  
Push push push to the stroll  
Down down down down  
Way behind the barn  
Sundowns gonna catch me  
In my sweet babys arms  
Woo

Way behind the barn

Way behind the barn  
Sundowns gonna catch me  
In my sweet babys arms
