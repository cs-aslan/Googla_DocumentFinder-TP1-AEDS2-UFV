Youre gonna meet some strangers  
Welcome to the zoo  
Bitter disappointments  
Except for one or two  
Some of them are angry  
Some of them are mean  
Most of them are twisted  
Few of them are clean  
  
Now when you go dancing with young men down at the disco  
Just keep it simple  
You dont have to kiss though  
Dont waste time whit the idiots  
Think that theyre heroes  
They will betray you  
Stick with us weirdos  
  
For all your days and nights  
Im gonna be there  
Im gonna be there yes I will  
Go gentle through your life  
If you want me Ill be there  
When you need me Ill be there for you  
  
Dont try to make them love you  
Dont answer every call  
Baby be a giant  
Let the world be small  
Some of them are deadly  
Some dont let it show  
If they try and hurt you  
Just let your daddy know  
  
Now when you go  
Giving your heart make sure they deserve it  
If they havent earned it  
Keep searching its worth it  
  
For all your days and nights days and night  
Im gonna be there Im gonna be there  
Im gonna be there yes I will  
Go gentle through your life through your life  
If you want me Ill be there If you want me Ill be there  
When you need me Ill be there for you  
  
Go gentle to the light to the light  
Im gonna be there Im gonna be there  
Im gonna be there yes I will  
If all your days are nights days are nights  
When you want me Ill be there If you want me Ill be there  
Say my name and Ill be there for you
