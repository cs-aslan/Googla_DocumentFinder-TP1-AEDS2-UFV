You never looked so good  
As you did last night  
Underneath the city lights  
There walking with your friend  
Laughing at the moon  
I swear you looked right through me  
  
But Im still living with your goodbye  
And youre just going on with your life  
  
How can you just walk on by  
Without one tear in your eye  
Dont you have the slightest feelings left for me  
Maybe thats just your way  
Of dealing with the pain  
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall  
Like we never loved at all  
  
You I hear youre doing fine  
Seems like youre doing well  
As far as I can tell  
Time is leaving us behind  
Another week has passed  
And still I havent laughed yet  
  
So tell me  
What your secret is  
I wanna know I wanna know I wanna know  
To letting go letting go like you did  
Like you did  
  
How can you just walk on by  
Without one tear in your eye  
Dont you have the slightest feelings left for me  
Maybe thats just your way  
Of dealing with the pain  
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall  
Like we never loved at all  
  
Did you forget the magic  
Oooh  
Did you forget the passion  
Ohhho  
And did you ever miss me  
Ever long to kiss me  
Ooh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa baby baby  
  
Maybe thats just your way of dealing with the pain  
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall  
Like we never loved  
At all  
At all
