So wake up sleepy one  
Its time to save your world  
Steal dreams and give to you  
Shop lift a thought or two  
All children touch the sun  
Burn fingers one by one  
By one  
Will this earth be good to you  
Keep you clean or stain through  
So wake up sleepy one  
Its time to save your world  
Youre where the wild things are  
Yeah  
Toy soldiers off to war  
Big eyes to open too  
Believing now under sun and moon  
But does heaven know youre here  
And did they give you smiles or tears  
No no tears  
Will this earth be good to you  
Keep you clean or stain through  
So wake up sleepy one  
Its time to save your world  
Youre where the wild things are  
Yeah  
Toy soldiers off to war  
You swing your ass all down  
Call to arms a trumpets sound  
Toy horses start the charge  
Robots chessmen standing guard  
We shall never surrender  
All you children touch the sun  
Burn your fingers one by one  
Will this earth be good to you  
Keep you clean or stain through  
So wake up sleepy one  
Its time to save your world  
Youre where the wild things are  
Yeah  
Toy soldiers off to war  
Off to war  
Off to war  
So close your little eyes
