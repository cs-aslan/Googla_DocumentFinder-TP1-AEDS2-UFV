Fillmore East nyc  
June 56 1971  
  
Concentration Moon  
Over the camp in the valley  
Over the camp in the valley  
Concentration Moon  
Oh what A  
Concentration Moon  
I wish I was back in the alley  
Wish I was back in the alley  
With all of my friends  
Still running free  
Running free  
Hair growing out  
Every hole in me  
Thats right you heard right  
Hair growing out  
Every hole in me  
American way  
How did it start  
Thousands of creeps  
Killed in the park  
American way  
Try and explain  
Scab of a nation  
Driven insane  
Dont cry  
Gotta go bye bye  
Suddenly die die  
Cop kill A creep Pow pow pow  
  
Fz And speaking of creeps here they are ladies and gentlemen
