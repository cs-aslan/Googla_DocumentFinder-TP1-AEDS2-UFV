Mama likes to listen to the grand old gospel time  
Daddy is a cowboy drinkin beer and wine  
Mamas in the kitchen standin there all alone  
She got Jesus on the radio and daddy on the phone  
  
Daddy says come on down to Tootsies and have yourself a beer  
Mamas in the kitchen standin there in tears  
My mama love my daddy but its breaking up our home  
She got Jesus on the radio and daddy on the phone  
  
Mama dont like drinkin and she dont understand  
Daddys had a hard life a deeply troubled man  
Its honky tonk and gospel thats breaking up our home  
She got Jesus on the radio and daddy on the phone  
  
Daddy says come on down  
I came home one evening there was mama on her knees  
Big old tears of gospel joy running down her cheeks  
She says you dont have to worry son we are not alone  
  
I got Jesus on the radio and Jesus on the phone  
Daddy says come on down
