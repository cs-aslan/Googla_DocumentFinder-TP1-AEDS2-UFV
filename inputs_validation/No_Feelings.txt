Seen you in the mirror when the story began  
And I fell in love with you I love your mortal sins  
Your love is straight away but I love your company  
I only ever leave you when you got no money  
  
I got no emotions for anybody else  
Better understand Im in love with myself  
Myself my beautiful self  
  
No feelings no feelings  
No feelings for anybody else  
  
Hello and goodbye and a runaround Sue  
You follow me around like a pretty pot of glue  
I kick you in the head you got nothing to say  
Get out of the way cos I gotta getaway  
  
You never realize I take the piss out of you  
You come up and see me  
And Ill beat you black and blue  
Okay Ill send you away  
  
No feelings no feelings  
No feelings for anybody else  
Except for myself my beautiful self yeah  
  
Aint no moonlight after midnight  
I see you stupid people out looking for delight  
Well Im so happy Im feeling so fine  
Watching all the rubbish you wasting my time  
  
Look around your house you got nothing to steal  
Kick you in the brain tell you get down to kneel and pray  
You pray to your God  
  
No feelings no feelings  
Aint no feelings for anybody else  
No feelings no feelings  
No feelings for anybody else  
  
Except for myself your daddys gone away  
Back another day  
Incomprehensible
