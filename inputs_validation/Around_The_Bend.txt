Im wishing you a wellmind at peace within yourself  
Covers up I cast you offIll be watching as you breathe  
Id lie still you move Id send you off around the bend  
I hold your head deep in my armsmy fingertips they close your  
Eyes  
Off you dream my little childtheres a sun around the bend  
Theres a sun around the bend  
All the evenings close like thisall these moments that Ive  
Missed  
Please forgive wont you dear  
Please forgive and let me share with you around the bend  
Youre an angel when you sleep  
How I want your soul to keep of and all around the bend
