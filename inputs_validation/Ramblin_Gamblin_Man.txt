Yeah gonna tell my tale  
Come on  
Come on  
Give a listen  
Cause I was born lonely  
Down by the riverside  
Learned to spin fortune wheel  
And throw dice  
And I was just thirteen  
When I had to leave home  
Knew I couldnt stick around  
Had to roam  
I aint good lookin  
But you know I aint shy  
Aint afraid to look a girl  
In the eye  
So if you need some lovin  
And you need it right away  
Just take a little time out  
And maybe Ill stay  
  
Then I got to ramble  
Ramblin man  
Lord I got to gamble  
Gamblin man  
Ahh I got to ramble  
Ramblin man  
And I was born a ramblin gamblin man  
  
I hope you got money  
Sho gonna need some  
Aint gonna run on lovin  
And I got to run  
I got to keep movin  
Never gonna slow down  
You can have your funky world  
See ya round  
  
I got to ramble  
Ramblin man  
Yeah I got to gamble  
Gamblin man  
Ahh I got to ramble  
Ramblin man  
I was born a ramblin gamblin man
