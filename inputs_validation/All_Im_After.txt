All Im after is to be on your winning side  
All I need is to be turning back the tide  
Cause I care too much for the life that I lead  
What youre thinking could be anybodys guess  
  
All Im after is the sun and the summer nights  
By the seashore dont want no more neon lights  
Just the sand and the sky as the hours roll by  
Aint it funny how the world seems to be back there in my dreams  
All I see is my reflection in your wild and winsome ways  
Aint it funny life feels different every day  
  
All Im after is to be the flame in your tattoo  
Be the one girl who can thrill me through and through  
This is just a guess but I must confess  
It feels better being certain  
Please excuse my truthfulness  
What Im seeings worth believing  
When you thrill me like you do  
So you wonder why my feelings never fade  
I think I got it made  
  
In the evening when the rain begins to fall  
Thats when I wonder if you think of me at all  
But you sound so sad in your special way  
Aint it funny life feels different with each new passing day  
All I need is my reflection in your wild and windswept ways  
Aint it funny how life changes every day
