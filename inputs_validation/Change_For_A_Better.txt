Down the lowest I can go  
With no one left to turn  
On the edge I lose control  
Before I crash and burn  
Can I turn around  
Slow it down oh  
  
Hold on weve still got living to do  
So far gone  
See life for someone like you  
In your eyes  
You showed me reasons to live  
Take time  
The time it takes to forgive  
  
Its my life itll change for the better  
Ive faced the light  
Its worth the fight  
See a new day  
Start a new way  
Get it straight  
Make it change for the better  
  
I was dying a drowning man  
And I wish you well  
Pull me from the darkness  
And save me from myself  
  
Wake up shake it off  
Let go  
What Im pretending to be  
I know  
Im still the man I could be yeah  
  
Its my life itll change for the better  
Ive faced the light  
Its worth the fight  
See a new day  
Start a new way  
Get it straight  
Make a change for the better  
  
Im waking up to find  
A different state of mind  
There was a new place Im okay  
Ive changed for the better  
  
Ive opened up my eyes  
Im glad to be alive  
Its never too late  
To cheat fate  
Changed for the better  
  
And now then there is no hope  
Until we are faced without  
We can never fall in love  
Until we learn to live without  
In our love we cant find peace  
Without conflict in our lives  
And the healing wont begin oh  
Til we open up our eyes  
  
Its my life itll change for the better  
Ive faced the light  
Its worth the fights  
See a new day  
Start a new way  
Get it straight  
It all comes together  
  
Made my mind up  
Theres still time enough  
Im all right  
Made a change for the better  
  
Change for the better  
Change for the better yeah  
Oh oh oh  
Yeah Im all right  
Oh
