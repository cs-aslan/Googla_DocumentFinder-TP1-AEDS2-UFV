Now that youve been bought and sold  
You dont got time to fix the mess your in  
And if I may be so bold  
I bet you couldnt even do it again  
  
Lying like yesterdays paper  
Just outside your door  
  
Chorus  
Now you need me to clean your shoes  
Walk on water be in the mood  
Everybodys talking but nobody knows  
Where did the emporer get them new clothes  
  
I always did look up to you  
I tried to copy everything that you did  
Until you broke my heart in two  
You shot me up and then you flipped your lid  
  
Lying like yessterdays paper  
Just outside your door  
  
Repeat Chorus
