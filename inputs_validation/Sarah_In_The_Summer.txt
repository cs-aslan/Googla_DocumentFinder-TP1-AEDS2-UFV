Ive driven this road as a stranger  
Ive driven this road as a friend  
Ive driven this road as a slackjawed tourist  
And Im drivin on it once again  
It might be cold and long and lonely  
But shes waiting on the other side  
And Im an hour closer to Sarah in the Summer  
And joyfully I ride  
I climb through Georgetown Silver Plume  
The tunnel at Lovelands cold  
The lake on the left is a little low  
Route 9 is the Breckenridge road  
Theres a sign right below Copper Mountain  
Telling the weather on Independence runs free  
And Im an hour closer to Sarah in the Summer  
And thats where I wanna be  
In the evening shadow of Red Butte  
Up the lane from the Slaughterhouse Bridge  
The first cabin the moonlight strikes as it crests the cliff in Hunter Creek
ridge  
Up from between old Red and Smuggler  
Rising high on a piano bench there  
And Im an hour closer to Sarah in the Summer  
And what lies between beware  
What lies between beware  
And the red sandstone sentinels rising high on either side  
As I follow the Eagle Valley  
Through the canyon where the saints reside  
And my Sopris massive majesty South  
And East out of Glenywood Springs  
And Im an hour closer to Sarah in the Summer  
Where the Roaring River sings  
Where the Roaring River singsIve driven this road as a stranger  
Ive driven this road as a friend  
Ive driven this road as a slackjawed tourist  
And Im drivin on it once again  
It might be cold and long and lonely  
But shes waiting on the other side  
And Im an hour closer to Sarah in the Summer  
And joyfully I ride
