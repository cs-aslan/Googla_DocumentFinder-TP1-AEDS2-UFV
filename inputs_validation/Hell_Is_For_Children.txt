They cry in the dark  
So you cant see their tears  
They hide in the light  
So you cant see their fears  
Forgive and forget  
All the while  
Love and pain become one and the same  
In the eyes of a wounded child  
  
Because hell hell is for children  
And you know that their little lives can become such a mess  
Hell hell is for children  
And you shouldnt have to pay for your love  
With your bones and your flesh  
  
Its all so confusing this brutal abusing  
They blacken your eyes and then apologize  
Be daddys good girl and dont tell mommy a thing  
Be a good little boy and youll get a new toy  
Tell grandma you fell from the swing  
  
Because hell hell is for children  
And you know that their little lives can become such a mess  
Hell hell is for children  
And you shouldnt have to pay for your love  
With your bones and your flesh  
  
Repeat x3  
Hell hell is for hell  
Hell is for hell  
Hell is for children  
  
Hell is for children  
Hell is for children
