God for the life of me  
I dont know why  
We hurt each other  
In the name of what is right  
God for the life of me  
I dont understand  
Echos everyday of mans  
Inhumanity to man  
Mans inhumanity to man  
  
Chorus  
Theres a river of sorrow  
Running through my heart  
Through the long night I will follow  
The glimmer in the dark  
Lord you are the human spark  
  
God for the life of me  
I cannot explain  
How people born of love  
Lose their way to hate  
Oh theres gotta be a better way  
  
Chorus
