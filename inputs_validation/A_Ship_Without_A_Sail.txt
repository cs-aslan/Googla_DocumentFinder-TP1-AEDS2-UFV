I dont know what day it is  
Or if its dark or fair  
Somehow thats just the way it is  
And I dont really care  
  
I go to this or that place  
I seem alive and well  
My head is just a hat place  
My breast an empty shell  
And Ive a faded dream to sell  
  
All alone all at sea  
Why does nobody care for me  
When theres no love to hold my love  
Why is my heart so frail  
Like a ship without a sail  
  
Out on the ocean  
Sailors can use a chart  
Im on the ocean  
Guided by just a lonely heart  
  
Still alone still at sea  
Still theres no one to care for me  
When theres no hand to hold my hand  
Life is a loveless tale  
For a ship without a sail  
  
Still alone still at sea  
Still theres no one to care for me  
When theres no hand to hold my hand  
Life is a loveless tale  
For a ship without a sail
