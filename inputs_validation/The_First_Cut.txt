The first cut  
Is a criminal thing  
The first cut  
Goes deeper in  
Each impression  
Makes a chain reaction  
Each impression  
Will never be never be never be never be broken  
Im a white girl  
You can see my skin  
Look at this picture  
That Im living in  
And old scores never settle down  
Ill keep on walking  
Till Im buried in the cold ground  
Cold ground cold cold ground  
Each impression  
Makes a chain reaction  
Each impression  
Will never be never be never be never be broken  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut  
The first cut
