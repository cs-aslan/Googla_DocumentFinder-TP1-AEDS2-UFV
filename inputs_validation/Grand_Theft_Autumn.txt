Where is your boy tonight  
I hope he is a gentleman  
Maybe he wont find out what I know  
You were the last good thing about this part of town  
  
When I wake up  
Im willing to take my chances on  
The hope I forget  
That you hate him more than you notice  
I wrote this for you for you so  
  
You need him  
I could be him  
I could be an accident but Im still trying  
Thats more than I can say for him  
  
Where is your boy tonight  
I hope he is a gentleman  
Maybe he wont find out what I know  
You were the last good thing about this part of town  
  
Someday Ill appreciate in value  
Get off my ass and call you  
But in the meantime Ill sport my brand new fashion  
Of waking up with pants off at 4 00 in the afternoon  
  
You need him  
I could be him  
I could be an accident but Im still trying  
Thats more than I can say for him

Wont find out  
He wont find out  
Wont find out  
He wont find out
