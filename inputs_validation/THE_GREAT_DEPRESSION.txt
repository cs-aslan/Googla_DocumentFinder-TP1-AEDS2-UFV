I think we must have all gone mad  
Maybe right turned over  
They promise us the earth  
Instead weve got the great depression  
Now youre free and easy with the base  
You blame your brothers and sisters  
And neurotics say sod the rest  
Its the new dissention  
  
Into the abyss  
By pushing forwards  
Its always down  
Its a desperate war  
youre trying to blow yourselves up  
You dont care who you stand with the help about  
Hey hey  well thats not the way  
  
No sense or reason in your fussing and fighting  
And your violent obsession  
whos ever really left feeling fine  
After the great depression  
No sense of purpose in the competition  
Keeping up with the joness  
You buy a house  
You buy a car  
You buy a marriage and a bed of roses  
  
Into the abyss  
By pushing forwards  
Its always down  
Its a desperate war  
youre trying to blow yourselves up  
You dont care who you stand  with the help about  
  
Hey hey  well thats not the way
