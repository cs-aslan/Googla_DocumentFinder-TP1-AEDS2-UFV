Cause its all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I cant keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah cause its all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I cant take it  
YeahI cant shake it no  
  
I cant wait to see you  
want to see if you still got that  
Look in your eye  
That one you had for me  
Before we said our goodbyes  
And its a shame that we  
Gotta spend our time  
Being mad about the same things  
Over and over again  
About the same thing  
Over and over again  
  
Oh but I think shes leaving on  
And shes leaving here  
And I dont know what else to do  
Cant go on not loving you  
  
Cause its all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I cant keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah cause its all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I cant take it  
I cant shake it no  
  
I remember the day you left  
I remember the last breath  
You took right in front of me  
When you said that you would leave  
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you  
Or say anything  
But I see clearly now  
And this choice I made keeps  
Playing in my head  
Over and over again  
It play in my head  
Over and over again  
  
Oh but I think shes leaving on  
And shes leaving here  
And I dont know what else to do  
Cant go on not loving you  
  
Cause its all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I cant keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah cause its all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I cant take it  
I cant shake it no  
  
Now that I realize  
That Im going down  
From all this pain you  
Put me through  
Every time I close my eyes  
I lock it down  
Oh I cant go on not loving you  
  
Cause its all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I cant keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah cause its all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I cant take it  
I cant shake it no  
  
Cause its all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
And I cant keep  
Picturing you with him  
And it hurts so bad  
Yeah cause its all in my head  
I think about it  
Over and over again  
I replay it  
Over and over again  
And I cant take it  
I cant shake it no
