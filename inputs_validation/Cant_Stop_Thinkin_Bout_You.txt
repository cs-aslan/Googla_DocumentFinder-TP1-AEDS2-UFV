It gets old living in this jungle  
And Ive lost my way  
I dont know what is it any longer  
Its nothing more to say  
  
But one think its true Im in love with you  
And Im gonna do what I got to do  
Every since you run away  
My whole words been blue  
And I just cant stop think bout you  
Thinking bout you  
Thinking bout you  
Ooh yeah  
Thinking bout you  
  
I was never ever to the give myself  
For the things I did  
I thought I I thought I was a man  
But I was just a kid  
  
But one think its true  
Im still in love with you  
And Im gonna do what I got to do  
Every since you run away  
My whole words been blue  
And I just cant stop think bout you  
Thinking bout you  
Thinking bout you  
Ooh yeah  
Thinking bout you  
Thinking but you babe  
Thinking bout you  
  
But one think its true  
Im still in love with you  
And Im gonna do what I got to do  
Every since you run away  
My whole words been blue  
And I just cant stop think bout you  
Thinking bout you  
Thinking bout you  
Thinking bout you  
Thinking bout you  
I think bout you  
Ooh yeah come on
