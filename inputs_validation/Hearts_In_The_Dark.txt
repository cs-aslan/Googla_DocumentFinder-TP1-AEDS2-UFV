When we got together  
We were drowning in the touch  
You kept things to yourself  
And didnt say too much  
I let you have your silence  
Cause I thought you needed time  
But now I want to stop  
Tryin to read between the lines  
I cant wait forever  
One side needs to know  
The feelings of the other  
Before they know their own  
Every night  
You take your silence to bed  
Every day  
The same words go on never said  
And tonight  
Well do it all over again  
Youve touched my life forever  
But well never really start  
Every time you turn on the light  
My hearts in the dark  
Hearts in the dark  
You can have your secrets  
A part of you thats yours  
But you want me in your life  
And need to know what for  
Help me get around it  
Cause were more than passing ships  
I see it in your eyes  
Let me hear it from your lips  
Every night  
You take your silence to bed  
Every day  
The same words go on never said  
And tonight  
Well do it all over again  
Youve touched my life forever  
But well never really start  
Every time you turn on the light  
My hearts in the dark  
Hearts in the dark  
Our love is a broken rage  
And Im drowning in my doubts  
It may sound like Im angry  
But Im only reaching out  
And time wont change  
What Im goin through only you can do that  
If you want me now to stay with you  
Then bring the reason back  
And tonight  
Dont take your silence to bed  
Every day  
Dont let those words go unsaid  
And tonight  
Well start it all over again  
Baby touch my life forever  
Let me know you want to start  
Cause every time you turn on the light  
My hearts in the dark  
And tonight  
Dont take your silence to bed  
And today  
Dont let those words go unsaid  
And tonight  
Well start all over again  
Baby touch my life forever  
Let me know you want to start  
Cause every time you turn on the light  
My hearts in the dark
