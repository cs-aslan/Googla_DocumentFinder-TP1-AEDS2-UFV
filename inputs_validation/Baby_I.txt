Baby I got love for thee  
So deep inside of me I dont know where to start  
I love you more than anything  
But the words cant even touch whats in my heart  
  
When I try to explain it I be sounding insane  
The words dont ever come out right  
I get all tongue tied and twisted  
I cant explain what Im feeling  
  
And I say baby baby  
Baby baby I  
Oh baby oh baby my baby Baby I  
Oh baby baby I baby I  
All Im tryna say is youre my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicate it  
  
Baby baby Ooh oh  
  
Baby Im so down for you  
No matter what you do real talk Ill be around  
Oh baby see baby I been feelin you  
Before I even knew what feelings were about  
Oh baby  
  
When I try to explain it I be sounding all crazy  
The words dont ever come out right  
I get all tongue tied and twisted  
I cant explain what Im feeling  
  
And I say baby baby  
Baby baby I  
Oh baby oh baby my baby baby I  
Oh baby baby I baby I  
All Im tryna say is youre my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicate it  
  
Baby baby  
Baby baby  
  
Straight up you got me  
All in how could I not be  
I sure hope you know I sure hope you know  
If its even possible I love you more  
Than word love can say it  
Its better not explaining thats why I keep saying baby I  
  
Ooh baby oh baby my baby Baby I  
Oh baby baby I baby I  
All Im tryna say is youre my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby I  
Ooh baby oh baby oh baby Baby I  
Oh baby  
Baby I All Im tryna say is youre my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
Every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
Every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
  
Baby baby  
Baby baby
