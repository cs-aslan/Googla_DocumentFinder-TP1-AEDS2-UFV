Had a dream about you baby  
Had a dream about me and you  
Had a dream and I woke up cryin  
Well I can try but I just cant stop  
And the time is draggin by ticktock  
Oh my heart it just cant love no one but you  
  
Well Im high and dry and lonely  
Im as lonesome as can be  
And I stare out of my window  
Well I can play but I just cant win  
And the weathers lookin mighty grim  
Oh my heart it just cant love no one but you  
  
Chorus  
Oh my heart it cant love no one but you  
My heart cant love no one but you  
Oh my heart it just cant love no one but you  
Oh my heart cant love no one but you  
My heart cant love no one but you  
Oh my heart it just cant love no one but you  
  
Had a dream about you baby  
Had a dream about me and you  
Had a dream and I woke up cryin  
Well I can try but I just cant stop  
And the time is draggin by ticktock  
Oh my heart it just cant love no one but you  
  
Oh my heart it just cant love no one but you
