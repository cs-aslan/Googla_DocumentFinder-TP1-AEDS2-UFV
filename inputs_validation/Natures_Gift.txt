Everybody needs a woman in their life  
A mother or a sister a man may need a wife  
If you have a woman in your life  
Dont take her for granted youll regret it by and by  
  
Chorus  
Dont use her or abuse her or youll lose her  
She filled with emotion strong as the sea  
Deep as an ocean and shell always be  
So high on her feelings high on my list  
Shes everything she is natures gift  
  
Give her the attention that shes worthy of  
Show her some respect  
And dont take advantage of the fact that she loves you  
  
Chorus  
  
Mother nature gave us  
Mother nature gave us this creation  
Mother nature gave us  
Mother nature gave us this creation  
Someone you can count on  
Shell always be there whenever you need her  
  
Chorus  
  
Weary from giving so much of herself  
Never complaining always seems  
So high on her feeling so high on my list  
Shes everything she is natures gift
