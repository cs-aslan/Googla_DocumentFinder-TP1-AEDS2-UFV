Fuck yes  
Whew  
Always Im locked in my head  
Know the pain you dont know what I have had  
By now Im so for sure  
Right now I am yours  
My sorrow I swallow  
Follow me Oh Hell no  
  
It came unknown to me  
Paranoid is controlling all of me  
Somehow turned so pure  
Right now shit Im yours  
  
My sorrow I swallow  
Follow me Oh hell no  
Was it me I swallow  
Forget me I dont know  
  
Oh hell no  
Oh hell no  
Oh hell no  
This thing I follow  
The place Im too scared to fucking go  
A freak that Im sure  
A freak that is yours  
  
My sorrow I swallow  
Follow me Oh hell no  
Was it me I swallow  
Forget me I dont know  
I swallow  
I swallow  
Freak  
  
Repeat x16  
Punk ass sissy Im a freak
