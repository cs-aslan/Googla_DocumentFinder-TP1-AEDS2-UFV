Im uneducated  
My clothes outdated  
Im not politically correct  
  
I still hate small talk  
And fast cars and hard rock  
Still adds up my  
  
I should be expressing  
All my inner repression  
I guess depressions now a cultural thing  
  
My record company says  
Blow my brains out my head  
I make the cover of every magazine  
  
Chorus  
Step inside my nightmare  
Welcome to my trip  
I cannot pretend and I will not defend  
Why this good old boys so tragically unhip  
  
I still like bad girls  
Who rock me hard in my world  
Its monkey see and monkey do  
When Im  
  
I got an old waterbed  
I like to trip into the dead  
Ive keep a poster of Kiss on my wall  
  
I still curse smoke drink and toke  
And make love in the back of my car  
  
Chorus  
  
I like that home grown  
Mind blowing  
Youre bringing  
Are rolling  
  
They see strange stalking  
Mind stopping  
Ass swinging  
Street walking  
Floozies  
  
Chorus
