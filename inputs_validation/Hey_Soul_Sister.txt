Hey hey hey  
  
Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains  
I knew I wouldnt forget you and so I let you go and blow my mind  
Your sweet moonbeam the smell of you in every single dream I dream  
I knew when we collided youre the one I have decided whos one of my kind  
  
Chorus  
Hey soul sister aint that Mr Mister on the radio stereo  
The way you move aint fair you know  
Hey soul sister I dont want to miss a single thing you do tonight  
  
Hey hey hey  
  
Just in time Im so glad you have a onetrack mind like me  
You gave my life direction a game show love connection we cant deny  
Im so obsessed my heart is bound to beat right out of my untrimmed chest  
I believe in you like a virgin youre Mah Daughter  
And Im always gonna wanna blow your mind  
  
Chorus  
  
Well you can cut a rug watching yous the only drug I need  
So gangsta Im so thug youre the only one Im dreaming of  
You see I can be myself now finally in fact theres nothing I cant be  
I want the world to see youll be with me  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey soul sister I dont want to miss a single thing you do  
Tonight  
Hey hey hey  
Tonight  
Hey hey hey  
Tonight
