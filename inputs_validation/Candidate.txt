Forced by the pressure  
The territories marked  
No longer the pleasure  
Oh Ive since lost the heart  
  
Corrupted from memory  
No longer the power  
Its creeping up slowly  
The last fatal hour  
  
Oh I dont what made me  
What gave me the right  
To mess with your values  
And change wrong to right  
  
Please keep your distance  
The trail leads to here  
Theres blood on your fingers  
Brought on by fear  
  
I campaigned for nothing  
I worked hard for this  
I tried to get to you  
You treat me like this  
  
Its just second nature  
Its what weve been shown  
Were living by your rules  
Thats all that we know  
  
I tried to get to you  
I tried to get to you  
I tried to get to you  
I tried to get to you
