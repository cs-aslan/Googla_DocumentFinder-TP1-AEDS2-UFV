Im depending on you  
Everything that you do  
Im depending on you  
To see me through  
You know that I love you  
And there is nothing I can do  
But depend on you  
Im depending on you  
This is our last chance  
And Im depending on you  
To try to save our romance  
Because youre the only girl  
That I understand  
When you tell me Im your man  
Promise me that you will never leave me  
Promise me that you will never say goodbye  
Promise me that you will never break my heart  
And now youre making me cry  
Im depending on you  
This is our last chance  
Im depending on you  
Just to try to save our romance  
Because youre the only girl  
That I understand  
Honey tell me Im your man
