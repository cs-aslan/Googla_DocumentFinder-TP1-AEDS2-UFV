One day I was cryin  
Cause I thought that  
Love was something that would  
Never come my way no way  
  
Thats when somebody told me  
Not to worry  
They said love would surely one day be my friend  
And I would never have to be without it again  
And its because  
  
Once you know how  
You just never forget how to  
It may seem kinda crazy  
But its a shonuff thing  
Been tested and found true  
Once you know how  
You just never forget  
How to love  
  
Im in love  
Yes I am at last  
I can love  
Yeah
