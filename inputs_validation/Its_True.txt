Even the lover makes a mistake sometimes  
Like any other fall out and lose his mind  
And Im sorry for the things I did  
For your teardrops or the words I said  
Can you forgive me and open your heart once again Oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
Its true I mean it  
From the bottom of my heart  
Yeah its true  
Without you I would fall apart  
  
Whatever happened I know that I was wrong Oh yes  
Can you believe me Maybe your faith is gone  
But I love you and I always will  
So I wonder if you want me still  
Can you forgive me and open your heart once again  
Oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Id do anything to make it up to you  
So please understand and open your heart once again  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Its true
