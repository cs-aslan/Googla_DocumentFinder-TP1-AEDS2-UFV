When the site was found  
We laid the foundations down  
It didnt take long before  
They came back tumbling down  
Dont build at night  
You need a little light  
How else are you going to see  
What it is going to be like  
  
So we picked up our tools  
And we worked in the morning light  
With the last stone placed  
Wasnt it a wonderful site  
But it fell back down  
And scattered all around  
Anything passes  
When you need glasses  
  
My monument  
It feel down  
My monument  
It feel down  
  
Work all of my days for this kind of praise  
It fell down  
Work all of my days  
It fell down
