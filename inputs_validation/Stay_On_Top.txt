Everybody got somebody  
Trying to make you feel real bad  
Aint none of their business  
Talking behind your back  
Be strong in yourself  
Stand up walk away  
Nobody gives a damn for a  
Single thing you say  
  
Im singing  
Stay on top never go under  
Lightning strikes  
Before you hear the thunder  
Stay on top never go under  
Hold on tight  
Here comes the thunder  
  
Hide money in your pocket  
Be nobodys fool  
Always think of number one  
Thats my golden rule  
Take care of business  
Go for it with the best  
Be strong enough to take it  
Aint no need to rest  
  
Im singing  
Stay on top never go under  
Lightning strikes  
Before you hear the thunder  
Stay on top never go under  
Hold on tight  
Watch out for the thunder  
  
Bad times make you cry  
But the good times get you high  
  
I cant stand it  
I cant stand it no more  
  
Somebody everybody  
Trying to make you feel real bad  
Aint nobodys business  
Talking behind your back  
Be strong in yourself  
Stand up walk away  
Nobodys gonna listen  
To a single word you say  
  
Stay on top never go under  
Lightning strikes  
Before you hear the thunder  
Stay on top never go under  
Hold on tight  
Look out for the thunder  
  
Stay on top  
Youve got to stay on top  
Stand up and sing it  
Stay on top  
Take care of business  
Stay on top
