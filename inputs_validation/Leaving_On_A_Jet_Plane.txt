All my bags are packed  
Im ready to go  
Im standin here outside your door  
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye  
  
But the dawn is breakin  
Its early morn  
The taxis waitin  
Hes blowin his horn  
Already Im so lonesome I could die  
  
So kiss me and smile for me  
Tell me that youll wait for me  
Hold me like youll never let me go  
Cos Im leavin on a jet plane  
I dont know when Ill be back again  
Oh babe I hate to go  
  
Theres so many times  
Ive let you down  
So many times Ive played around  
But I tell you now they dont mean a thing  
  
Every place I go Ill think of you  
Every song I sing Ill sing for you  
When I come back Ill bring your wedding ring  
  
So kiss me and smile for me  
Tell me that youll wait for me  
Hold me like youll never let me go  
Cos Im leavin on a jet plane  
I dont know when Ill be back again  
Oh babe I hate to go  
  
Yes Im leavin on a jet plane  
I dont know when Ill be back again  
Oh babe I hate to go  
Yes Im leavin on a jet plane  
I dont know when Ill be back again  
Im leaving  
Yes Im leaving
