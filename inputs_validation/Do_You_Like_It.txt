I crawled out from the pain of yesterday  
I crawled to you and  
I said all the things that you said to say  
Have I said enough  
  
Do you like it yeah yeah  
Do you like it yeah yeah  
  
I know how youre playin these dirty games  
Theyre killing me and  
I know how you love to watch me beg  
So here I am  
  
Do you like it yeah yeah  
Do you like it yeah yeah  
Do you like it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Chorus  
I dont want to be the puppet for you  
I dont want to bite the hand thats feeding  
I dont want to be a sucker for you  
Ah yes you  
I hate myself for begging  
I hate myself for staying  
I hate myself for listening to you  
  
Its too little too late I cant escape  
So Im begging you please  
I changed all the things that you told me to change  
And now Im on my knees  
  
Do you like it yeah yeah  
Do you like it yeah yeah  
Do you like it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
I just want to get out  
Stuck inside of this  
Waiting for something else  
Waiting to exist  
Can you offer me help  
Help for what Ive missed  
Ive missed  
Ive  
  
Do you like it yeah yeah  
Do you like it yeah yeah  
Do you like it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
For listening to you ah  
For listening to you ah  
For listening to you ah
