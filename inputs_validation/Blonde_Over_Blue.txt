Some days when Im far away  
In a lonely room in a cold seclusion  
Some nights when Im wound so tight  
There is no release there is no solution  
In hell theres a big hotel  
Where the bar just closed and the windows never open  
No phone so you cant call home  
And the TV works but the clicker is broken  
But in the darkness I see your light turned on  
You know my weakness you know how I respond to  
CHORUS  
Blonde over blue  
Your hands are cold your eyes are fire  
Blonde over blue  
They shine as though youre burning inside  
One word from you is all I need to be inspired  
Blonde over blue  
I need your inspiration tonight  
These days theres a million ways  
To be pulled and torn to be misdirected  
These times there are sins and crimes  
On the morning shows for the disconnected  
I look and I write my book  
And I walk away with the wrong impressions  
I dont care cause Ive done my share  
And I need some time for my own obsessions  
It doesnt matter Ive let that life go by  
Its been forgotten cause all I wanted was you  
CHORUS  
These days not a damn soul prays  
And there is no faith cause theres nothing to believe in  
These days only good luck pays  
If we dont get paid then we try to get even  
I look and I write my book  
And I have my say and I draw conclusions  
Some nights when Im wound so tight  
There is no release there is no solution  
But in the darkness I see your light turned on  
You know my weakness you know how I respond to  
CHORUS
