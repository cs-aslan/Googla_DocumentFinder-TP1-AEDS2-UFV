Theres nothing in my life Id say I regret  
But theres something in your eyes that makes me forget  
The times that I believed that love was good as love could be  
I had it all but I was wrong  
  
Thought Id been touched  
Thought Id been kissed  
Thought Id been loved  
But it was nothing like this  
  
You cant describe the sea unless youve been there before  
Its just a mystery until youre standing on the shore  
And moved by every wave  
Taking your breath away  
Like you do to me  
  
Thought Id been touched  
Thought Id been kissed  
Thought Id been loved  
But it was nothing nothing like this  
  
Its like another life  
Like I hadnt felt a thing  
Until you  
  
Thought Id been touched  
Thought Id been kissed  
Thought Id been loved  
But it was nothing nothing like this  
It was nothing like this  
Nothing like nothing like this
