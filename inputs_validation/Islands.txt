Island in the sea  
Are so much like me  
They dont ever changeno emotion no emotion  
Islands on the land  
Dry like desert sand  
Island in the city  
All alone its such a pity  
CHORUS  
Its just a masquerade  
Just painted laces  
When will it change  
Never  
Islands in the seas  
Whats come over me  
We are both surrounded by the waterempty water  
Give me mysteryand the fear it brings  
Anything at all to break up the monotony  
CHORUS  
Islands in the sea  
Forever    forever
