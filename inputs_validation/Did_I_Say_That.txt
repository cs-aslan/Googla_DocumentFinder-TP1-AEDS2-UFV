So this is what it feels like  
To be the one left behind  
To give it all youve got then find  
Youve already changed your mind  
  
And this is what it sounds like  
Crying on the bed that we both made  
Waiting for a sign that you just cant give me  
Any kind of sign  
  
I dont want to be here wideawake  
Clinging to a love that cant be saved  
Hanging off the edge of every word  
That you say  
  
So I asked myself Do I love you so much  
That Im willing to let you go  
At the tip of my tongue the answer was yes  
But at the bottom of my heat Im wondering  
  
Did I say that  
Did I say that  
Sometimes you know I over react  
And what I say is not a matter of fact  
I wish that I could take it all back  
  
And you know Id drag myself through fire at your side  
And you know the gates of Heaven are surely open wide  
And I need some sympathy here  
And I need someone to call my own  
Im standing in the light of my mistakes  
And begging you come home  
  
And I know you need some time to run and hide  
But the truth is hard to swallow when youre choking on your pride  
  
So I asked myself Do I love you so much  
That Im willing to let you go  
At the tip of my tongue the answer was yes  
But at the back of my mind Im wondering  
  
Did I say that  
Did I say that  
Sometimes you know I over react  
And what I say is not a matter of fact  
I wish that I could take it all back  
But I said that  
  
And I wish I could take it all back  
  
And I need some sympathy here  
And I want a love to call my own  
I want to take you in the back seat now  
And slowly drive you home  
  
And I know you need some time to run and hide  
But the truth is hard to swallow when youre  
Choking on your pride  
I dont want to be this wideawake  
  
Fighting for a love that I cant save  
And hanging off the edge of every word you say  
Knowing that it might make me cry  
I dont want to be this complicating  
You can drag it out but Ill be waiting  
I stumbled on I love you tonight  
But it sounded like goodbye  
  
Did I say that  
Did I say that  
Did I tell you that I loved you cause if  
Would have been a matter of fact  
  
Did I say that  
This time Im not letting go  
Did I say that  
This time Ill have and Ill hold  
Did I tell you that I loved you cause it  
Would have been a matter of fact  
Did I say that  
This time Im walking through fire  
Did I say that  
This time Ill feed your desire  
Did I say that  
This time Ill stand by your side  
Did I say that  
This time I will be your pride  
Did I say that  
This time Im not letting go  
Did I say that  
This time Ill have and Ill hold  
Did I say that  
This time Im walking through fire  
Did I say that  
And I wish that I could take it all back  
  
So this is what it feels like  
To be the one left behind  
To give it all youve got then find  
That youve already changed your mind
