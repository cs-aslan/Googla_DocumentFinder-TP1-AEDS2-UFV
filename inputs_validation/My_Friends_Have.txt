My friends have many features  
Many reasons I can believe them  
My friends have many things that  
I am needing to keep me singing  
  
Yeah youre a friend of mine  
Youre a friend of mine  
Yeah youre a friend of mine  
Youre a friend of mine  
  
My friends have many mountains  
Many mountains that I can breathe in  
My friends have many houses  
Many caves that I can choose to live in  
  
Yeah youre a friend of mine  
I love these friends of mine  
Youre a friend for life  
I love these friends of mine  
  
My friends have many pathways  
Many roads that I can choose to take  
My friends have many highways  
Where I can find my way back home again  
  
Youre a friend of mine  
I love these friends of mine  
Youre a friend for life  
I love these friends of mine  
  
My friends have always been there  
To help me shape my crooked features  
My friends have picked me up again  
And pushed my enemies out of the picture  
  
Yeah youre a friend of mine  
Youre a friend of mine  
Yeah youre a friend of mine  
Youre a friend for life
