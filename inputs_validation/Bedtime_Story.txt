Today is the last day that Im using words  
Theyve gone out lost their meaning  
Dont function anymore  
  
Lets lets lets get unconscious honey  
Lets get unconscious honey  
  
Today is the last day that Im using words  
Theyve gone out lost their meaning  
Dont function anymore  
  
Traveling leaving logic and reason  
Traveling to the arms of unconsciousness  
Traveling leaving logic and reason  
Traveling to the arms of unconsciousness  
  
Chorus  
Lets get unconscious honey  
Lets get unconscious  
Lets get unconscious honey  
Lets get unconscious  
  
Words are useless especically sentences  
They dont stand for anything  
How could they explain how I feel  
  
Traveling traveling Im traveling  
Traveling traveling leaving logic and reason  
Traveling traveling Im gonna relax  
Traveling traveling in the arms of unconsciousness  
  
Chorus  
  
And inside were all still wet  
Longing and yearning  
How can I explain how I feel  
  
Chorus  
  
Traveling traveling repeat twice  
Traveling traveling in the arms of unconsciousness  
  
And all that youve ever learned  
Try to forget  
Ill never explain again
