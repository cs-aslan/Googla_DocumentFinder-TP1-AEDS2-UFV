Charlie brown says  
Noone promised this when i was a kid  
When my days were filled with carousels  
Fairground rides and cockleshells  
Kicking pebbles on a beach  
When time couldnt reach me  
And tears were just a memory left to be learned  
  
Now days catch me without an overcoat  
Five oclock shoes full of snow  
All rained out nowhere to go  
  
Memories are sure to find you  
No matter how fast you run  
Gonna catch up with you  
  
Charlie brown says  
Oh this winter sure sure gets me down  
When there aint no friends around
