Accept the fact that youre second rate life is easy for you  
Its all served up on a gold plated plate  
And we dont even have to talk to you  
Your face is normal thats the way youre bred  
And thats the way youre going to stay  
Your head is firmly nailed to your TV channel  
But someone elses fingers on the control panel  
  
What you gonna be brother  Zero the hero  
Dont you want to be brother  Zero the hero  
When you gonna be brother  Zero the hero  
Impossibility impissibolity mother really a hero  
  
You sit there watch it all burn down  
Its easy and breezy for you  
You play your life to a different sound  
No edge no edge you got no knife have you  
Your life is a six lane highway to nowhere  
Youre going so fast youre never ever gonna get down there  
Where the heroes sit by the river  
With a magic in their music as they eat raw liver  
  
You stand there captain we all look  
You really are mediocre  
You are the champion in the Acme form book  
But I think youre just a joker  
Your freedom life aint so much of a pity  
But the luvaduckin way youre walkin around  
The city with your balls and your head full of nothing  
Its easy for you sucker but you really need stuffing
