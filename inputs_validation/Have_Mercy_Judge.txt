Have mercy Im in a world of trouble now  
Im being held by the State Patrol  
I am charged with traffic of the forbidden  
And I almost finished doing my parole  
Now Im on my way back down town  
Somebody help me have mercy on my soul  
I go to court tomorrow morning  
And I got the same judge I had before  
Lord I know he wont have no mercy on me  
Cause he told me not to come back no more  
Hell send me away to some stoney mansion  
In a lonely room and lock the door  
Ow Have mercy on my little Tulane  
Shes too alive to try to live alone  
And I know her needs  
And although she loves me  
Shes gonna try to make it  
While the poor boys gone  
Somebody should tell her to live  
And Ill understand it  
And even love her more  
When I come back home
