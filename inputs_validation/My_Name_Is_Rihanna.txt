New on the streets my names Rihanna  
  
Im a soldier true and true I know I make it true the storm  
I really want you to realise I really want you to put me on  
Ive been searching for some fire to let me be all I can be  
Music is my inspiration its the only thing I need  
  
New on the streets my names Rihanna  
  
So I tryed my best en prayed to god  
My dreams will all turn real  
Cauze there is a fire burning in my heart  
I hope you all can feel  
To my music I be faithful you know  
I give my all and all  
True the good times and the bad times  
And the winter spring and fall  
  
New on the streets my names Rihanna  
Rihanna My name is Rihanna yeah
