Its the words you dont say  
That keeps ringing in my ear  
I feel like an idiot  
To think that you really cared  
Its the kiss you dont blow  
that I keep brushing off my chin  
Its the punch you dont throw  
That keeps hurting within  
I only loved you  
  
Whatever you do  
Whatever you say  
  
Its the words you dont scream  
That being sucked back in  
A dream within a dream  
Its not what youve seen  
Its what you dont understand  
That makes you sharper than  
The ones who  
Take advantage of you  
I only loved you  
  
Sick of this music  
  
Whatever you do  
Whatever you say  
A cellular goodbye
