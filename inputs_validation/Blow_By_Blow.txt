Its always something  
Or it aint nothing at all  
Its feast or famine  
Too hot or out in the cold  
So here we stand  
Alone together  
Our backs against the wall  
If my heart wasnt in it  
I wouldnt be here at all  
  
Blow by blow  
Well its blow by blow  
And here we go again  
here we go again  
Well its blow by blow  
  
Coming off the ropes  
And fighting for the hope in us all  
Are you in my corner  
Or playing both sides of the wall  
So make a stand  
Its now or never  
Cause life is much too short  
And if your heart isnt in it  
You shouldnt be here at all  
  
Blow by blow  
Well its blow by blow  
And here we go again  
here we go again  
Well its blow by blow  
  
Blow by blow  
Well its blow by blow  
Im back on my feet again  
im back on my feet again  
Well its blow by blow  
  
I can almost see through the tears  
And Ive got my pride  
The dreams that Ive hidden for years  
Just wont be denied  
  
So here we stand  
Alone together  
Our backs against the wall  
If my heart wasnt in it  
I wouldnt be here at all  
  
Blow by blow  
Well its blow by blow  
And here we go again  
here we go again  
Well its blow by blow  
  
Blow by blow  
Well its blow by blow  
Im back on my feet again  
im back on my feet again  
Well its blow by blow
