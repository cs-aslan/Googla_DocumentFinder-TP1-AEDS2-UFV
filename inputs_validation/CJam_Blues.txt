Baby take me down to Dukes place  
Wildest box in town is Dukes place  
Love that piano sound in Dukes place  
Saxes do their tricks in Dukes place  
  
Fellas swing their chicks in Dukes place  
Come on get your kicks in Dukes place  
You find yourself a seat and when you want to eat  
You look around and yell waiter  
  
You fill your cup chock full of dreams and drink it up  
Youre jetting along with your girlie  
Its after three oclock but baby its still early  
If youve never been to Dukes place  
Take your tootsies into Dukes place  
Life is in a spin in Dukes place
