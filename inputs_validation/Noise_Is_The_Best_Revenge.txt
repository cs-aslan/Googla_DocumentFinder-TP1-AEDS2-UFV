Hey kid take my hand  
If only for awhile  
And tell me all over again  
You say noise its the best revenge  
Noise noise noise  
All you can say is noise its the best revenge  
I know youre dreaming  
Noise its the best revenge  
I know youre dreaming too  
Hey kid let me cry  
And dont think any less of me  
Ive been hawking this song for too long  
You say noise its the best revenge  
Theres a right way theres a wrong way  
And theres even a Victorian legal system  
But noise its the best revenge  
I know youre dreaming  
Noise its the best revenge  
I know youre dreaming too too  
Hey kid let me die  
A short walk into the dark sky  
A final adventure if only I wasnt so tired  
You say I know why youre dreaming  
I know why youre dreaming  
You say I know why youre dreaming  
I know why youre dreaming  
Cause its the only escape  
I know why youre dreaming  
Cause its the only escape to to
