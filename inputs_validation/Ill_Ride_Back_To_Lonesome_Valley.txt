My troublin mind tonight is drifting  
To a cottage far away  
And as restless cattle wander  
I can hear a sweet voice say  
  
You are leaving Jack your darling  
With a lonesome broken heart  
But Ill wait in Lonesome Valley  
Tho we may be far apart   
  
Yes so well do I remember  
Of the night we say goodbye  
There were teardrops on your cheeks dear  
As I left your loving side  
  
But when round up time is over  
Wheter skies are dark or fair  
Ill ride back to Lonesome Valley  
For I know Ill find you there  
  
You are my queen of Lonesome Valley  
By your side I know no care  
Nights out on the lonesome prairie  
You have been my guiding star  
  
Soon my faithful paint Ill saddle  
And beneath the western sky  
Ill ride back to Lonesome Valley  
And youll be my blushing bride
