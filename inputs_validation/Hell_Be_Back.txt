I know better than anybody how it feels to want somebody so bad after you
break up  
  
Still  
Looking for that phone call  
  
Still  
Even when they dont  
  
Still aint ready to walk away and call it all over  
Act like you wasnt listening when they told ya  
They dont want to be with you anymore  
Stuck in your ways you choose to ignore  
  
Cause in your mind youre still together  
Thought it would last but theres no forever  
Walked out on you with no call no letter  
When he realize it dont get no better  
  
Hell be back  
To make up for the lonely days  
Hell be back  
When things aint working out his way  
Hell be back  
When he sees that its not the same  
Hell be back hell be back  
Hell be back hell be back  
Hell be back  
  
He knows hes gonna need his lady  
Hell be back  
When his boys say he must be crazy  
Hell be back  
Hell know he made a big mistake  
Hell be back hell be back  
Hell be back hell be back  
Hell be back  
  
You dont want to believe it but you see it happening  
Wakes you up out of your sleep out of the dreams youre having  
  
Still  
Looking for his return  
  
Still  
Hoping that hes gonna learn  
  
Wake up and realize the truth make some time for you  
Whats he trying to do to you  
Miss him more as days go by  
Try your hardest not to cry and keep hope alive  
  
Cause in your mind youre still together  
Thought it would last but theres no forever  
Walked out on you with no call no letter  
When he realize it dont get no better  
  
Hell be back  
To make up for the lonely days  
Hell be back  
When things aint working out his way  
Hell be back  
When he sees that its not the same  
Hell be back hell be back  
Hell be back hell be back  
Hell be back  
  
He knows hes gonna need his lady  
Hell be back  
When his boys say he must be crazy  
Hell be back  
Hell know he made a big mistake  
Hell be back hell be back  
Hell be back hell be back  
Hell be back
