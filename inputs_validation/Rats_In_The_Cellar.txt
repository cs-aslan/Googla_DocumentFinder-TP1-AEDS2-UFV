Goin under rats in the cellar  
Goin under skins turnin yellow  
Nose is runny losin my connection  
Losin money getting no affection  
  
New York City blues  
East side West side lose  
Throw me in the slam  
Catch me if you can  
Believe  
That youre wearing  
Tearing me apart  
  
Safe complaining cause everythings rotten  
Go insanin and aint a thing forgotten  
Feelin cozy rats in the cellar  
Cheeks are rosy skins turning yellow  
Loose and soggy lookin mighty lazy  
Super party pushin up adaisies  
  
New York City schools  
East side west side lose  
Throw me in the slam  
Catch me if you can  
Believe  
That youre wearing  
Tearing me apart
