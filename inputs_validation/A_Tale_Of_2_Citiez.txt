Look at me my nigga  
Fantasize about a white picket fence  
With some trees my nigga  
Used to want a pathfinder with some tints  
thats all I need my nigga  
Throw some 20s on that bitch and get it wrenched  
But now I see my nigga  
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since  
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body Im convinced  
Anybody is a killer all you gotta do is push em to the limps  
Fuck being timid in the Civic  
Politicin with the pushers and the pimps  
Im tryna write a story can I get a glimpse  
Yeah can I get a glimpse  
  
Last night I had a bad dream  
That I was trapped in this city  
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing  
They robbin niggas on the daily  
Keep on blamin nigga that aint never had things  
Guess not last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like  
Uh nice watch run it  
Hands in the air now hands in the air run it  
Hands in the air now hands in the air run it  
Hands in the air now hands in the air  
Hands in the air now hands in the air  
  
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams  
I know that everything that glitters aint gold  
I know the shits not always good as it seems  
But tell me till you get it how could you know  
How could you know How could you know  
Listen up Im about to go and get rich  
Fuck with me my nigga  
We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick  
Cop some tree my nigga  
And some powder bag it up and make it flip  
You gon see my nigga  
One day we gon graduate and cop a brick  
And thats the key my nigga  
And listen up Im bout to go and get rich  
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga  
Me I want my pockets fat about a bitch  
Tired of seein niggas flaunt I wanna flaunt too nigga  
Watch some rollers in the fuckin Crown Vic  
Tryna lock a nigga up thats what they wont do nigga  
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit  
Even if you let em kill your dream itll haunt you nigga  
  
Last night I had a bad dream  
That I was trapped in this city  
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing  
They robbin niggas on the daily  
Keep on blamin nigga that aint never had things  
Guess not last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like  
Uh nice watch run it  
Hands in the air now hands in the air run it  
Hands in the air now hands in the air run it  
Hands in the air now hands in the air  
Hands in the air now hands in the air  
  
Father forgive me for me childish ways  
I look outside and all the clouds are gray  
I need your hands to take me miles away  
Your wish is my command my command my command but  
Before you go Ive got to want you now  
Whatever goes up surely must come down  
And you get your piece but no peace wont be found  
So why just take me man take me man take me man  
Your wish is my command my command my command
