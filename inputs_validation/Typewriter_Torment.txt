Typewriter torment dreadful disease  
Caught it the first day I touched the keys  
You wear down your fingers and churn out your pap  
It eats up your life like a dose of the clap  
Typewriter torment it tortures me still  
If only my doctor could see that Im ill  
Typewriter fever it harries me still  
If only my doctor would give me a pill  
Typewriter fever gives birth to a flood  
It sweeps through your body and curdles your blood  
You curse and discurse but youre damned for all time  
The moment your fingers give birth to a rhyme  
Typewriter fever it harries me still  
If only my doctor would give me a pill  
Typewriter fever Im worn to a stub  
Ive dumped my thesaurus and pulled out the plug  
Im rending my ribbon and bending my spool  
Dont bother rewinding Im done with it all  
But why cant my doctor just say that Im ill  
Typewriter fever is paying his bill
