Falling out the window  
Tripping on a wrinkle in the rugfalling out of love dear  
It hurt much worse when you gave up  
  
Just dont tell me which way I oughta run  
Or what good I could do anyone  
Cause my heart it was a gun  
But its unloaded now  
So dont bother  
  
Climbing up the ladder  
Breaking my shin on the very first rung  
Waking up the neighbors  
Its all rightthey understand theyre just as dumb  
  
And they dont tell me which way I oughta run  
Or what good I could do anyone  
Cause my heart it was a gun  
But its unloaded now  
So dont bother me now  
Dont bother  
  
Crawling back to you now  
I sold my guitar to the girl next door  
She asked me if I knew how  
I told her I dont think so anymore  
  
Dont tell me which way I oughta run  
What good could I do anyone  
Cause my heart it was a gun  
But its unloaded now  
So dont bother
