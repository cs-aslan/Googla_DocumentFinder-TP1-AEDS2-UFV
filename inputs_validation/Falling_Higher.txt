I thought that I felt alright with my world  
But now that I knew seems taken by someone  
Probing me waiting if I take the bait  
Surrender step into the line  
  
We wont give into the false  
We are not as dull as taken  
Someone will hold out if they can  
They must kill us if they want us to fall  
  
When we unite  
Were falling higher  
When words collide  
Well stand straight in turmoil and fear  
No harm coming near  
  
Hungry forever since we took a glance  
Feared that the world was taken by someone  
We realized by the look in your eyes  
Metal will never die  
  
With magic in your hands  
We are lostandfound contenders  
For a kingdom of our stand  
Come together no surrender at all  
  
With magic in your hands  
We are lostandfound contenders  
For a kingdom of our stand  
Come together no surrender at all  
  
When we unite  
Were falling higher  
When words collide  
Well stand straight in turmoil and fear  
No harm coming near  
No harm coming near  
No harm coming near  
Were falling higher
