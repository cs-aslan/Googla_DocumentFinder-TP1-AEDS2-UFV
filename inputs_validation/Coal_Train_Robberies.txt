Yesterdays coal train came to rest in the bitter cutting  
And as the signals took an age to change it was easy pickings  
So you go to the movies where they smash it up  
You want to feel your heart pumping it makes you feel good  
A few of the rookie cops were squealing the hits  
As another MercedesBenz gets blown to bits  
While all the time in the Camptown Theatres of Piccadilly  
Theyre going to throw a blackface minstrel show for the barefoot children  
That theyre always selling  
Theyll say Its quaint as the guilty ones faint  
And claim they aint underneath this paint  
We interrupt these liberal saints with their whips and watermelon  
  
Reports are coming in of a coaltrain robbery  
Its like another world or it had better be  
  
So we return to whitewashed pout of his committed lips  
Since he was declared the long lost fountain of youth  
That drips and drips and drips  
Theyll be sending him round from door to door  
To sell you back whats already yours  
So many good deeds so little time  
Say the advertising agency swine  
When man has destroyed what he thinks he owns  
I hope no living thing cries over his bones  
If you dont believe that Im going for good  
You can count the days Im gone and chop up the chairs for firewood  
  
Reports are coming in of a coaltrain robbery  
Its like another world or it had better be
