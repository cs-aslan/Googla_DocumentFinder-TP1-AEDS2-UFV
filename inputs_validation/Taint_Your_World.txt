Screaming at the sun I t have spilled a little moonshine on my head  
Didnt have to run but there was no one left behind accept for the dead  
  
I didnt see it coming but that rummystilted crackpot knew my game  
Left my head a humming like a ball peen hammer drives a nail to shame  
  
I suggest you listen up to what I have to say  
Witnessed many crooked things I smell your DNA  
Stab me take me down you know youll never get your way  
  
Taint your world  
Youre so far away from where you think you need to be  
Taint your world  
Cause you dont want to fuck with me  
  
Didnt anybody get the cipher from the flying rat machine  
Gnarly little scrunched up tiny fingers and its disposition mean  
  
Anybody out of line will soon be on the list  
My backs against the wall and yet I know I must resist  
Time to tell the truth I think somebodys getting pissed  
  
Taint your world  
Youre not even close to where you think you need to be  
Taint your world  
You got another guess coming if you think youre fooling me  
  
Taint your world  
So far away from where you think you need to be  
Taint your world  
Where I belong just like an oyster and a pearl  
Taint your world  
Youre not even close to where you think you need to be  
Taint your world  
Taint your world
