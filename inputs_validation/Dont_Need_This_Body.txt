This getting older  
Aint for cowards  
This getting older  
Is a lot to go through  
Aint a gonna need this body  
Much longer  
Aint a gonna need this body  
Much more  
  
Well I cant see much  
Like I used to  
And I cant run like the wind  
I dont sleep more  
Than just a few hours  
I cant remember where Ive been  
  
Chorus  
Aint a gonna need this body much longer  
Aint a gonna need this body much more  
I put in a ten million hours  
Washed up and worn out for sure  
  
Well all my friends are  
Sick or dying  
And Im here all by myself  
All I got left  
Is a head full of memories  
And a thought of my upcoming death  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I know one thing  
Ill die easy  
And I know my life  
Is not in vain  
Because I loved  
And I fought with many  
And the people they loved me just the same  
  
Chorus  
  
This getting older  
Well it aint for cowards  
This getting older  
Is a lot to go through
