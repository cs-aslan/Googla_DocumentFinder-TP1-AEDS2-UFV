Hey Mister Exxon  
Wont you have pity  
Wont you have pity on the guiltless ones  
Hey Mister Chrysler  
Wont you think about it  
Wont you think about it Judgment Day has begun  
What will become of tomorrows children  
Who gives a damn for tomorrows children  
Pay no mind you just keep on takin  
Keep on takin til theres nothing at all  
Sit on your hands and dont say nothin  
Cover your eyes you wont see nothin  
Cry for the innocent sent to war  
Dont tell a soul  
Shed a tear for the ones waiting at the door  
Theyll never know  
Its the last generation of a world gone blind  
You better watch your tongue  
Its the violation of the unborn child  
Its the rape of the young  
Hey Mister General  
Cant you find something  
Cant you find something else to do for a buck  
Hey Mister President  
Nobody listens  
Nobody listens til weve run out of luck  
Nobody cares for unborn troubles  
Why should you care its too much trouble  
You got yours so it just dont bug ya  
It just dont bug ya cause you wont be around
