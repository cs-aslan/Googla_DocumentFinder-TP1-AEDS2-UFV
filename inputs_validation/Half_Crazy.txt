No I havent slept a week at all  
Since youve been gone  
And my eyes are kinda tired  
From crying all night long  
No Ive never been too good at cooking just for one  
Its so lonely here without you baby  
Come back home  
  
Cause Im half crazy  
Feelin sorry for myself  
Half crazy  
Worried youd find someone else to love  
  
No life hasnt been much fun at all  
Since youve been gone  
And my eyes begin to fill  
Each time I hear our song  
I spent every minute asking myself  
What went wrong  
Cant we try to talk it over baby  
Come back home  
  
Cause Im half crazy  
Feelin sorry for myself  
Half crazy  
Worried youd find someone else to love  
But baby there is noone else  
Half crazy  
For everything you saying  
Half crazy  
No one else could love you like I do  
  
Break  
  
Cause Im half crazy  
Feelin sorry for myself  
Half crazy  
Worried youd find someone else to love  
But baby there is noone else  
Half crazy  
For everything you saying  
Half crazy  
No one else could ever love you  
No one else could ever be  
  
Half crazy  
Feeling sorry for myself  
And Im worried youll find someone else  
Feeling sorry for myself  
Half Crazy faded
