Will you be my midnight dancer  
Any time of the day  
You can be my sweet romancer  
I want to hear you say  
When loves between us  
Come on baby dont turn away  
Dont let go  
Love makes the music  
You cant stop the feelin  
Free will stealin your heart away  
Stealin your heart away  
Love makes the music  
And you know its the feelin  
Free will stealin your heart away  
I want to steal your heart away  
Im tired of bein a sleepwalker  
On the run  
I want to be your love talker  
In the night the sun  
Oh love makes the music  
And you know its the feelin  
Free will stealin your heart away  
Gonna steal your heart away  
Now we can put our hearts together  
With nothin to hide  
Baby it could last forever  
Put your  aside  
Love makes the music  
And you know its the feelin  
Free will stealin your heart away  
I want to steal your heart away
