Cover of Pixies song played in Texas in 1995  
  
There was a guy  
An under water guy who controlled the sea  
Got killed by ten million pounds of sludge  
From new york and new jersey  
This monkeys gone to heaven  
  
The creature in the sky  
Got sucked in ahole  
Now theres a hole in the sky  
And the grounds not cold  
And if the grounds not cold  
Everything is gonna burn  
Well all take turns  
Ill get mine too  
This monkeys gone to haven  
  
Rock me joe  
  
If man is 5 3x  
Then the devil is 6 5x  
Then God is 7 3x  
This monkeys gone to heaven
