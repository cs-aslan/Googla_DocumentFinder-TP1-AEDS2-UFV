Only came outside to watch the nightfall with the rain  
I heard you making patterns rhyme like  
Some new romantic looking for the TV sound  
Youll see Im right some other time look now  
  
Look all around theres not sign of life  
Voices another sound  
Can you hear me now  
  
This is Planet Earth youre looking at Planet Earth  
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop  
  
This is Planet Earth  
My head is stuck on something precious let me know  
If youre coming down to land is there  
Anybody out there trying to get through  
My eyes are so cloudy I cant see you  
  
Look now look all around theres no sign of  
Life voices another sound  
Can you hear me now  
  
This is Planet Earth  
Youre looking at Planet Earth  
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop  
  
This is Planet Earth  
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop  
  
This calling Planet Earth  
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop  
  
This looking at Planet Earth  
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop  
  
This is Planet Earth
