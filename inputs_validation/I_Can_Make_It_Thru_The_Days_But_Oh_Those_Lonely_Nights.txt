Girl Im so lonesome tonight  
I was just lyin here wonderin where you are  
And what youre doin  
And Lord knows the thing that worries me the most  
  
Is who yer don it with  
Thats why if you dont mind  
Id like to sing these words to ya ya see  
Ive got new books to read  
  
But they aint what I need  
And this picture of you  
Just wont do no no baby  
And the postcards you send would never never mend  
  
The pain in my heart when were apart  
Girl I can make it through the day  
But oh please help me through the lonely nites  
When Im on my job Its not too hard  
  
But when I go home  
And Im all alone and Im by myself babe you heard me  
You know youre my crutch I need youre sweet touch  
Then it gets the night time again Lord when will it end  
  
Ill make it through the day say but oh  
You dont know nothin about the lonely nites  
Well now night go away please hurry up day  
Cause my night lite burns and I toss and turn  
  
Tell me what would I see if I turned on TV  
I dont know what to do Lord knows I need me some you  
I can make it through the day  
Please help me through the lonely night
