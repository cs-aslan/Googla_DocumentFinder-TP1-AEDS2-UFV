You laid your cards down on the table  
And all your hearts have turned to spades  
Cause the sun aint been seen  
Since the last time you came clean  
Im getting tired of so much gray  
  
Dont you know me better than that  
Dont you know I know you  
Giving your words and then taking them back  
Cant you see youre see through  
  
Please stop saying there aint nothing wrong  
You can cover your eyes and youll still hear lies  
Please stop saying there aint nothing wrong  
And you can cover your ears but I wont disappear no no  
  
Baby youre brimming with disaster  
Your words spill onto the floor  
And the only thing thats clear  
Is youre being insincere  
So Im not listening anymore  
  
Dont you know me better than that  
Dont you know I know you  
Giving your words and then taking them back  
Cant you see I see straight through you  
  
Please stop saying there aint nothing wrong  
If you could cover your eyes but youll still hear lies  
Please stop saying there aint nothing wrong  
If you could cover your ears but I wont disappear no no  
  
Please stop saying there aint nothing wrong  
You could cover your eyes but Ill still hear lies  
Please stop saying there aint nothing wrong  
You could cover your ears but I wont disappear no no  
  
Please stop saying there aint nothing wrong  
You can cover your eyes but youll still hear lies  
Please stop saying there aint nothing wrong  
You could cover your ears but I wont disappear at all  
  
Stop speaking if you know I dont hear you  
Stop speaking if you know I dont hear you  
Stop speaking if you know I dont hear you  
Cover your eyes and you wont hear lies  
Stop speaking if you know I dont hear you  
Stop speaking if you know I dont hear you  
Stop speaking if you know I dont hear you  
Cover your ears so you wont disappear
