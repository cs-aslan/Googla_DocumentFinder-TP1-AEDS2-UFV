When she calls my name  
Nobody says it quite the same  
Gives me a feeling I never knew  
Makes me so happy loving her  
Love and love alone  
Id wait a life just to have it here  
Love is all I know and that cant be wrong  
Its sometimes hard to see  
Love isnt bought well its got to be  
There for a reason you want to share  
To show somebody you care  
Love and love alone  
Conquers the world that can be so cold  
Love is how we show just what we feel  
Its enough for me cant say I need anything else  
Love is here to be had by us all  
Dont cheat yourself  
I can say it now  
Someday well all be there somehow  
Everyone singing love leads the way  
Til then Im counting every day  
Love and love alone  
Id wait a life just to have it here  
Love is all I know and that cant be wrong
