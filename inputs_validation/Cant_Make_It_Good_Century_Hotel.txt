I  
I sit by the phone  
Waiting for someone to call me  
but I cant hear  
Im just a little bit  
High  
I wanted to run  
But if theres somewhere to go yeah  
Ill be there  
I just dont know because  
I know  
I just cant let it go  
But if I could let you know  
That your leaving me alone  
And I know  
I just cant let it go  
But if I could let you know  
That would be right  
I just dont know  
I  
  
I sit all alone  
Surrounded by the man inside the speaker  
Just need some sympathy  
And then time  
time  
Is taking its toll  
Im afraid Ill sink deeper and deeper  
Im sick of these tendancies and then  
  
I know  
I just cant make it good  
But if I could show you the world  
And the way I think that it should turn  
I know  
I just cant make it good  
But if I could show you the world  
And the way the way I think that it should  
  
I threw in my soul  
Threw in my heart and intuition  
Dont need them stuck in here  
And then why  
why  
Why wont you come  
Why wont you believe in what Im missing  
Im missing Im missing  
  
I know  
I just cant make it good  
But if I could show you the world  
And the way I think that it should turn x4
