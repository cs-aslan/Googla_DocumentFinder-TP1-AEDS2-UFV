Theres a bright golden haze on the meadow  
Theres a bright golden haze on the meadow  
The corn is as high as an elaphants eye  
And it looks like its climbing clear up to the sky  
  
Oh what a beautiful mornin  
Oh what a beautiful day  
Ive got a beautiful feelin  
Everythings going my way  
  
All the cattle are standing like statues  
All the cattle are standing like statues  
They dont turn their heads as they see me ride by  
But a little brown maverick is winkin her eye  
  
Oh what a beautiful mornin  
Oh what a beautiful day  
Ive got a beautiful feeling  
Everythings going my way  
  
All the sounds of the earth are like music  
All the sounds of the earth are like music  
The breeze is so busy it dont miss a tree  
And an old weepin willer is laughin at me  
  
Oh what a beautiful mornin  
Oh what a beautiful day  
Ive got a beautiful feeling  
Everythings going my way  
Oh what a beautiful day
