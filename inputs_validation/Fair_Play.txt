Fair play to you  
Killarneys lakes are so blue  
And the architecture Im taking in with my mind  
So fine  
  
Tell me of Poe  
Oscar Wilde and Thoreau  
Let your midnight and your daytime turn into love of life  
Its a very fine line  
But youve got the mind child  
To carry on  
When its just about to be  
Carried on  
  
And theres only one meadows way to go  
And you say Geronimo  
Theres only one meadows way to go  
And you say Geronimo  
  
A paperback book  
As we walk down the street  
Fill my mind with tales of mystery mystery  
And imagination  
  
Forever fair  
And Im touching your hair  
I wish we could be dreamers  
In this dream oh  
Let it dream  
  
And theres only one meadows way to go  
And you say Geronimo  
And theres only one meadows way to go  
And you say Geronimo  
  
Fair play to you  
Killarneys lakes are so blue  
Highho silver tit for tat  
And I love you for that  
Highho silver tit for tat  
And I love you for that love you for that love you for that  
Highho silver tit for tat tit for tat  
And I love you for that  
Highho silver tit for tat hah  
Yeah yeah  
And I love you for that  
  
And theres only one meadows way to go  
And I and I say Geronimo  
And theres only one meadows way to go  
And we say Geronimo  
Geronimo  
And theres only one meadows way to go  
And we say Geronimo  
And theres only one meadows way to go  
And we say Geronimo  
  
Fair play to you
