I want to start things out by giving testimony  
Cause one of my friends got ill seriously  
Now the doctor told him aint no way you gone live  
But he prayed his prayer in faith  
And a miracle appeared  
  
Its already alrightIts already alright  
And all you got to do is Just bow your head down  
Just bow and pray And then give it all up  
And know everythings gonna be okay  
Just throw your hands up  
And then wave them left to right  
And now do your dance child  
Cause its alright already  
Always surrounded by negativity  
This might be where I live  
But it aint gonna change me  
Gotta work on my mind  
And keep my actions pure  
And when I stumble I know who has the cure  
So any time your feeling down  
Just lift your voice in praise  
Itll pick you right up  
And you can come to Him dont be afraid  
Anytime  day or night He can give you what you need  
And if you pray your prayer in faith  
And in your heart believe that  
  
When lifes problems get you down  
Cant find no peace nowhere around  
Trust in the spirit you cant see  
Its bout to bring you your relief  
Go ahead and cry now  Its alright  
Cause now youre cryin tears of joy  
This life aint hurting you no more  
Cause you know its already alright  
  
Its already alrightIts already alright  
And all you got to do is Just bow your head down  
Just bow and pray And then give it all up  
And know everythings gonna be okay
