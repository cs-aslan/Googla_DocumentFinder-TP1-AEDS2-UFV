What is this news you got to tell me  
Girl what has got you so excited  
Why would you call me on my job  
When Im right in the middle of writing  
See youve got this look up on your face  
Spit it out girl I just cannot wait  
To get whatever it is up out of you  
So tell me girl what it do  
  
Ill give you a hint  
It crawls fore it walks  
In a couple of years  
It begins to talk  
And it makes us so happy  
Girl are you telling me  
  
Chorus  
Im havin a baby  
Oh I am so happy  
Im havin a baby  
And Im so glad to be that babys daddy  
Im havin a baby  
A lil girl a lil boy a lil you a lil me  
Im havin a baby  
  
Girl it doesnt matter as long as its healthy  
  
While I cant believe Im gonna be a father  
In nine months a child will be born  
Baby your pregnant in April  
Which means were havin a Capricorn  
Im so glad to be apart of this  
Cause girl a child is heaven sent  
This is a blessing to me  
To have you with my seed  
  
Chorus  
  
Girl it doesnt matter as long as its healthy  
  
Girl you got me Staring at you from head to toe  
When I look at you its like youve got this glow  
So much respect I got for you  
Girl since you told me whats good  
Ever since you told me I love you more  
Girl what I feel is so spiritual  
And baby our lives have been changed  
Now I want you to have my last name  
  
Chorus  
  
Girl it doesnt matter now here it is nine months later
