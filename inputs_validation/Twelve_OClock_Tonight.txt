Twelve oclock tonight  
Twelve oclock tonight  
Meet me at the door  
Meet me at the door  
  
Ill kiss you goodnight  
Ill kiss you goodnight  
Once more once more  
  
Then Ill go to bed  
Gotta go to bed  
Busy day ahead  
Busy day ahead  
  
But I know instead  
But I know instead  
Ill walk the floor  
Walk the floor  
  
Since Ive been with you  
Cant concentrate  
Want to stay up light  
Baby Ill wait for you  
  
Then Ill hold you tight  
Then Ill hold you tight  
Til the sun is bright  
Til the sun is bright  
  
Meet me at the door for sure  
At twelve oclock tonight  
Twelve oclock tonight  
  
Twelve oclock tonight  
Mmm middle of the night  
Not a soul in sight  
To interfere with our love  
  
Teacher may scold  
Mama may call  
But if were quiet  
Down in the hall  
  
Ill be hugging you tight  
Ill be hugging you tight  
Twelve oclock tonight  
  
Twelve oclock tonight  
Twelve oclock tonight  
Twelve oclock tonight
