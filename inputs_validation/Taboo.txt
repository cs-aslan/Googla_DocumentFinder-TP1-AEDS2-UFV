I lay not sleeping  
Dont know what to do  
Lay out in waiting  
Lord for the noon  
  
Pass so slowly  
Time without you  
I cant see why  
My open eyes cant see  
  
So much to look by  
So many things to be  
Cant keep looking  
In and out of me  
She looks at nothing  
Someone you all have seen  
She never cried  
As I watched her leave  
  
Try to help me  
Find the change in me  
Oh oh oh  
  
Try to help me  
Find the change in me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
