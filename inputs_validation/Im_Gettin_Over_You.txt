I changed my number  
Bought some new clothes  
Got some different records  
And a new   
Im gettin over you  
Im gettin over you  
  
Im going out dancing  
Learning new jokes  
Im staying out later  
Than I should I suppose  
But Im gettin over you  
Im gettin over you  
  
I took our name off the mailbox  
Redecorated our room  
Im not saying the hurtins all gone  
But itll be gone soon  
  
Chorus  
Im gettin over you  
So what if youre not here  
Im gettin over you  
And itll happen one of these years  
  
I ordered makeup  
From Vogue magazine  
Im taking aerobics two nights a week  
And Im getting over you  
Oh Im getting over you  
  
Im gettin over you  
Im gettin over you  
  
My friends come over  
And they wonder why  
Your pictures back on the wall  
Instead of proving losing you  
Dont bother me at all  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gettin over you  
Oh Im gettin over you
