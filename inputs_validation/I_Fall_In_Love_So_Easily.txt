You dont know whats good for you you wont leave me alone  
I know youve got a family sleepin at home  
Dont make me go out off my way dont tempt me please  
Dont you be so nice to me I fall in love so easily  
  
Im all alone and need someone I guess that it shows  
But the things you make me want to do Ill regret I know  
So dont say things that you dont mean cause I just might believe  
Dont you be so nice to me I fall in love so easily  
  
Im gonna leave tonight with you go on and have your fun  
I dont want to be a part of what I might have done  
Im tempted when I think about the things that might have been  
And Ill admit Id like to try but I know I couldnt win  
And so instead Ill say goodbye I know its time to leave  
Cause you been so nice to me and I fall in love so easily  
  
Cause you been so nice to me I fall in love so easily  
  
Cause you been so nice to me
