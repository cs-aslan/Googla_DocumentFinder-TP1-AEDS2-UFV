In real life Im waking up alone  
Its one more night you didnt make it home  
And one more time you wont pick up the phone  
In real life you never bring me flowers  
When youre here its only for an hour  
Im getting used to being on my own  
  
Because in real life youre not what I thought  
Real life this isnt what I want  
Guess things arent always what they seem  
  
Chorus  
But in my dreams Im waking up to roses  
Champagne kisses and I know its always always  
Gonna be gonna be this way  
In my dreams youre standing right beside me  
Two hearts finally colliding  
Then I wake up and realize realize this is real life  
  
Real life this is real life real life real life  
Real life whoaoh whoaoh whoaoh oh real life  
  
In real life it doesnt always work out  
People fall in love and then they fall out  
Hearts can break and never make a sound  
  
Because in real life youre not what I thought  
Real life this isnt what I want  
Guess things arent always what they seem  
  
Chorus  
  
Just when I thought this was all real life could be  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Somebody came along and made my dream reality  
  
And now in real life waking up to roses  
Champagne kisses and I know its always always  
Gonna be gonna be this way  
In my dreams hes standing right beside me  
Two hearts finally colliding  
When I wake up I realize realize this is real life
