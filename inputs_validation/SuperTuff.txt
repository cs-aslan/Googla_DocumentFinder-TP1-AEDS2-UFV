In the car park  
In the lamplight  
Go for a walk  
Clock him shivfight  
Sodiumashine on  
All the faces white now  
And he got his Docs on  
Bottle out all right now  
  
As you might say  
Him supertuff  
  
In the corner  
In the cold rain  
Sting like iodine  
In my brain  
Fist you til you fall down  
Hit him back make him mad  
Really hard Really fast  
Have you ever been had  
cause hes having you now  
  
Supertuff  
But also tender
