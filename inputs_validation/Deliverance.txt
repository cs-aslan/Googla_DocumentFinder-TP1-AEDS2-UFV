Make believe  
If youre sick of everything  
All the time before us  
Doesnt taint my memory  
  
When the walls they put around us  
Cant stop what we believe  
When the love we share forgets us  
This dream will set us free  
  
So please dont tell me  
Deliver me deliver me  
So please dont tell me  
If its up to me if its up to me  
Ive had it once and now I want it again  
Ive had it once and now I want it again  
Ive had it once and now I want it again  
Ive had it once and now I want it again  
  
When the walls they put around us  
Cant stop what we believe  
When the love we share forgets us  
This dream will set us free  
  
So please dont tell me  
Deliver me deliver me  
So please dont tell me  
If its up to me if its up to me  
Ive had it once and now I want it again  
Ive had it once and now I want it again  
Ive had it once and now I want it again  
Ive had it once and now I want it again  
  
When the walls they put around us  
Cant stop what we believe  
When the love we share forgets us  
This dream will set us free  
  
So please dont tell me  
Deliver me deliver me  
So please dont tell me  
If its up to me if its up to me  
Ive had it once and now I want it again  
Ive had it once and now I want it again  
Ive had it once and now I want it again  
Ive had it once and now I want it again
