Speak of the years of growing weary  
Ill take this to the end  
And watch the waves crash over me  
  
Speak of the years of growing weary  
Ill take this to the end  
And watch the waves crash over me  
  
I feel oh so over come  
With enough time  
To turn it all around  
And Im picture perfect  
See the way Ive come  
A sick sicker illustration  
My eyes roll back and focus on what today  
I cant still stand if you leave the hand to praise me  
Ill take this on my own  
Ill take this on my own  
Ill take this on
