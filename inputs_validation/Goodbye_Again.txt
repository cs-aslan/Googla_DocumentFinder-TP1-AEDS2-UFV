Its five oclock this morning and the sun is on the rise  
Theres frosting on the window pane and sorrow in your eyes  
The stars are fading quietly the night is nearly gone  
And so you turn away from me and tears begin to come  
  
And its goodbye again Im sorry to be leavin you  
Goodbye again as if you didnt know  
Its goodbye again and I wish you could tell me  
Why do we always fight when I have to leave  
  
It seems a shame to leave you now the days are soft and warm  
I long to lay me down again to hold you in my arms  
I long to kiss the tears away give you back the smile  
Other voices beckon me to go a little while  
  
And its goodbye again Im sorry to be leavin you  
Goodbye again as if you didnt know  
Its goodbye again and I wish you could tell me  
Why do we always fight when I have to leave  
  
Have to go and see some friends of mine some that I dont know  
Some who arent familiar with my name  
Its something thats inside of me not hard to understand  
Its anyone who listens to me sing  
  
And if your hours are empty now who am I to blame  
You think if I were always here our love would be the same  
As it is the time we have is worth the time alone  
And lying by your side the greatest peace Ive ever known  
  
But its goodbye again Im sorry to be leavin you  
Goodbye again as if you didnt know  
Its goodbye again and I wish you could tell me  
Why do we always fight when I have to leave
