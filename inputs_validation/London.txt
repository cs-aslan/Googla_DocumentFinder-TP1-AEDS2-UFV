Smoke  
Lingers round your fingers  
Train  
Heave on  to Euston  
Do you think youve made  
The right decision this time  
Oh  
  
You left  
Your tired family grieving  
And you think theyre sad because youre leaving  
But did you see Jealousy in the eyes  
Of the ones who had to stay behind  
And do you think youve made  
The right decision this time  
  
You left  
Your girlfriend on the platform  
With this really ragged notion that youll return  
But she knows  
That when he goes  
He really goes  
And do you think youve made  
The right decision this time
