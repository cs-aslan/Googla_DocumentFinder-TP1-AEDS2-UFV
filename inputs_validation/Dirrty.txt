Oh Im overdue give me some room  
Im coming through  
Paid my dues in the mood  
Me and the girls gonna shake the room  
  
Djs spinning show your hands  
Lets get dirrty thats my jam  
I need that uh to get me off  
Sweat until my clothes come off  
  
Its explosive speakers are pumping  
Still jumping six in the morning  
Table dancing glasses are mashing  
No question time for some action  
  
Temperatures up can you feel it  
About to erupt gonna get my girls  
Get your boys  
Gonna make some noise  
  
Wanna get rowdy  
Gonna get a little unruly  
Get it fired up in a hurry  
Wanna get dirrty  
  
Its about time that I came to start the party  
Sweat dripping over my body  
Dancing gettin just a little naughty  
Wanna get dirrty its about time for my arrival
