Walking down the street  
Youre the center of my universe  
You got the world in your pocket  
My manhood in your purse  
You aint a bad girl honey  
No matter what the neighbors say  
Its just that you were those skintight dresses  
With your Gstring tuned to A  
  
Sweet sweet child of the street  
  
Heaven sent youre an angel dressed in black  
Cool stiletto strut youre a drop jaw cardiac  
Youre the genuine feline prettiest girl Ive ever seen  
With your thief of hearts smile  
Youre a certified pleasure machine  
  
Sweet sweet child of the street  
  
Dressed to kill in diamonds and fur  
You get what you want  
With your pussy cat purr  
  
But the kittens got claws  
Shell tear your heart out  
The kittens got claws  
Shell scratch your back  
The kittens got claws  
Shell tease an please you  
The kittens got claws  
Shes a heart attack  
  
You treat me good  
Sometimes you treat me bad  
But keep it up honey  
Youre the best time Ive ever had  
No matter what you put me through I must confess  
Oh you got more style than a brand new XJS  
  
Sweet sweet child of the street  
  
Dressed to kill in diamonds and fur  
You get what you want  
With your pussy cat purr  
  
But the kittens got claws  
Shell tear your heart out  
The kittens got claws  
Shell scratch your back  
The kittens got claws  
Shell tease an please you  
The kittens got claws  
Shes a heart attack  
  
Walking down the street

No matter what the neighbors say
