Surprised  
Yes its me again  
I have just returned from the island of Chandelier  
What am I doing in town  
Well Im glad you asked  
Im just passing through in search of the ever elusive Thunderbird  
I got a job as a public relations man  
Passing out handbills on Austin Street  
Merely an effort to improve my financial situation  
And ward off a case of the DTs  
So farewell my darling  
Perhaps well meet again  
On some sininfested street corner in Houston Texas
