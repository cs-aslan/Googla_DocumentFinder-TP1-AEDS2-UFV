Do you know what it means to me  
To delight in your company  
Could it happen to me  
Do you know what Im certain of  
I would love to fall in love  
Could it happened to me  
Hey wont you look at me  
  
Now Im cracked wide open I cant conceal  
My allover trembling Im acting strange  
And while youre out of reach I never change  
God knows Im beside myself  
If a tears a crime then I must confess  
My guilty secret Im not ashamed  
Take me as I am an average man  
Oh boy is it getting rough  
When my old world charm isnt quite enough  
Id throw you cantos Id jazz em up  
When I lay me down you dont pick up  
  
Whats more its a crying shame  
Only this time no one but myself to blame  
All I touch turns to dust  
Its right there in my cards I ought to cut  
Let us sing of the tortured heart  
And a lonely soul in this world apart  
As he plays a fear takes a little pain  
And move our separate ways again  
Is it easy to say I do  
  
At this moment I love you  
See beyond me its true  
Now that evening is closing in  
Should I light that fire again  
Could it happen to me  
Did it happen to you
