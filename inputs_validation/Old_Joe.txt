Well Old Joe he moves slow  
He likes to look at things and paint pictures on his radio  
He says they make the songs look better  
  
One day Joe met a girl  
Sweet breathing thing  
Dancin naked nudey in the winter snow  
Underneath her dozen sweaters  
  
And someday somewhere  
Some things get hit by lighting  
And some things just dont  
Hope we live long and lucky  
  
At least one things for sure  
Or maybe it isnt  
No matter where we are  
Its this life that were livin in  
  
At least one things for sure  
Or maybe it isnt  
No matter where we are  
Its this life that were livin in  
  
And someday somewhere  
Some things get hit by lighting  
And some things just dont  
Hope we live long and lucky
