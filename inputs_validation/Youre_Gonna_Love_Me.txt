Jerry says that in the dark  
I think I have a good idea  
That I should do the opposite  
  
Of whatever it is I feel  
Thats because I have a bad mind  
And I have gold in my veins  
But he said I got the purest heart  
That hes ever seen  
  
What God gave me a brain for  
If he wont let me use it  
What God give me a plan for  
If He wont help me do it  
Youre gonna love me  
Im gonna make you  
Youre gonna love me  
Im gonna make you  
  
I can tell that youre the type  
To never trust a beauty queen  
But I was never voted for nothing and  
Highschool never meant anything to anybody  
Never ever gave myself away  
But even when Im funny  
You think Im acting so I say  
  
What God give me a break for  
If he wont let me use it  
What God give me a plan for  
He never helps me do it  
Youre gonna love me  
Im gonna make you  
Youre gonna love me  
Im gonna make you  
  
You say that you dont want to be hypnotized  
But baby I I dont wanna hypnotize you  
Theres nothing from you that I wanna take  
I just wanna be like you  
Maybe love you just a little bit  
Please  
  
Tell em mom and daddy gave themselves  
I wont to you  
You told me to get my ways as I do what Im gonna do  
Im gonna strike out right now  
Im striking out right now with this song  
But I cant help myself  
I cant do right for long  
  
What God give me a break for  
If he wont let me use it  
What God give me a Wlan for  
He never helps me do it  
Youre gonna love me  
Im gonna make you  
Youre gonna love me  
Im gonna make you
