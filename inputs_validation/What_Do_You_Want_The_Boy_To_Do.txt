So you think the man is crazy  
He eats up your lies  
Like theyre good for him  
Apple pie he dont even cry  
  
Hes not a fool  
Hes just tryin to do  
What his heart says to  
To love you  
  
As you take to the wind  
To the wind again my friend  
As he breaks down within  
Within within within  
He waits for you patiently  
Hopin that one day youll see  
That all he really wants to be  
Is yours and yours alone eternally  
  
What do you want the boy to do  
Dont you see youre breaking the child in two  
What do you want the boy to do  
All he really wants is you  
  
He knows what you are  
Still hell be up game  
Saved the world today  
But you know better  
You dont go around him  
  
Now and then you promise  
All the way out things that youre gonna get  
You will see you will be  
So damn glad that you finally found him  
  
As he watches you come and go  
Or you show  
As he watched you promise a zero  
He waits for you patiently  
Hopin that one day youll see  
That all he really wants to be  
Is yours and yours alone eternally  
  
What do you want the boy to do  
Dont you see youre breaking the child in two  
What do you want the boy to do  
Dont you see that youre breaking the child in two
