Knew the time to leave had come when you pointed out your ring  
Never could see what was in this matrimony thing  
Baby baby baby you sure made a noise when I left  
And your father started shouting lest you ironed my shirts  
fore I left  
Wouldve liked to explain first but it was a split decision thing  
Couldnt see me settling down with a mortgage and a kid  
Now I hear youve been looking for me  
Combing every single inch  
Youll probably find me in Hyde Park  
Try the hotel first then a bench  
Baby baby baby Ive changed my address  
I didnt mean to make you cry but I know its for the best  
Baby baby baby Ive changed my address  
Its OK being in love girl but then fun is second best  
No ones gonna tie me down  
Nobody tell me what to do  
Dont you see Ive got to be free  
Sorry baby thats the way it is  get with me  
I said maybe  
I didnt mean to break your heart and I know its not your choice  
Better think of it this way theres other fools to entice  
Thats right  
Baby baby baby Ive changed my address  
I didnt mean to make you cry but I know its for the best  
Baby baby baby Ive changed my address  
Its OK being in love girl but then fun is second best  
Baby baby baby Ive changed my address  
I didnt mean to make you cry but Im sure its for the best  
Baby baby baby Ive changed my address  
Its OK being in love girl but then fun is second best
