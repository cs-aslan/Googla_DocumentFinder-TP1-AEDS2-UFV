Rain or shine sleet or snow  
Youre the reason why I aint goin go  
Cause Im playing mine high and low  
Aint afraid of that whole world know  
  
Hello my love I heard a kiss from you  
Red magic satin playing near too near too  
All through the morning rain I gaze  
The sun doesnt shine doesnt shine  
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind  
run through my mind  
  
In the garden I see west purple showers bells and tea  
Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green  
cousins dressed in green  
Pretty music I hear so happy and loud happy and loud  
Blue flower echo from a cherry cloud baby  
  
A present from you strawberry letter 22 twenty two  
A present from you yeah strawberry letter 22 twenty two

Youre the reason why I aint goin go  
Cause Im playing mine high and low  
Aint afraid of that whole world know  
  
Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue hey yeah  
Playgrounds will laugh if you try to ask

Is it cool is it cool  
If you arrive and dont see me yeah  
Im going to be with my baby my baby  
I am free I am free  
  
Flying in her arms her arm over the sea over the sea  
Stained window yellow candy screen candy screen  
See speakers of kite velvet roses diggin freedom flight

Diggin freedom flight freedom flight
