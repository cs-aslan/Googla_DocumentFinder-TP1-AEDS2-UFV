It wasnt me that saw you standing by the neonlit door  
It wasnt me that saw you clinging to somebody I deplore  
Baby dont show your face dont move in my direction  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love love can be fatal  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love love can be fatal  
It wasnt me that heard you whisper a name Id never heard before  
It wasnt me that heard you steal out to meet behind a secret door  
Ive been suspecting Ive done my own detecting  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love love can be fatal  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love love can be fatal  
It wasnt me that saw you pick up a letter fallen on the floor  
It wasnt me that heard you say you couldnt love me anymore  
Theres no mistaking I guess Ill just be waiting  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love love can be fatal  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love love can be fatal  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love love can be fatal
