Oh yeah wooh  
Hey hey hey hey hey yeah  
  
Lifes ambition occupy my time  
Priorities confuse the mind  
Happiness one step behind  
This inner peace Ive yet to find  
  
Rivers flow into the sea  
Yet even the sea is not so full of me  
If Im not blind why cant I see  
That a circle cant fit where a square should be  
  
Chorus  
Theres a hole in my heart  
That can only be filled by you  
And this hole in my heart  
Cant be filled with the things I do  
  
Hole hearted Repeat x2  
  
This heart of stone is where I hide  
These feet of clay kep warm inside  
Day by day less satisfied  
Not fade away before I die  
  
Rivers flow into the sea  
Yet even the sea is not so full of me  
If Im not blind why cant I see  
That a circle cant fit where a square should be  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a hole in my heart  
That can only be filled by you  
Should have known from the start  
Id fall short with the things I do  
Hole hearted Repeat x6  
Yeah
