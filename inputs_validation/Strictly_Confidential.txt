Before I die Ill write this letter  
Here are the secrets you must know  
Until the cloak of evening shadow  
Changes to mantle of the dawn  
Will it be sunny then I wonder  
Rolling and turning  
How can I sleep  
Hold on till morning  
What if I fall  
  
Over the hills and down the valleys  
Soaring aloft and far below  
Lying on stony ground the fragments  
Truth is the seed we tried to sow  
Marking the time spent on our journey  
There isnt much we have to show  
Counting the cost in money only  
Strikes me as funny dont you know  
Tongue tied the thread of conversation  
Weighing the words one tries to use  
Nevertheless communication  
This is the gift you must not lose  
Hauling me always are the voices  
  
Tell us are you ready now  
Sometimes I wonder if theyre real  
Were ready to receive you now  
Or is it my own imagination  
Have you any more to say  
Guilt is a wound thats hard to heal  
Its a cross you have to bear  
Could it be evil thoughts become me  
Tell us what youre thinking now  
Some things are better left unsaid  
  
Magical moment  
The spell it is breaking  
There is no light here  
Is there no key
