She took my hand and said Lets go together  
You and me against the world  
And so we stuck it out through still and stormy weather  
And so we tumbled down the years  
I took her hand and said Lets go together  
Just you and me against the world  
  
Lets go together  
Stay together  
Well tumble down the years  
And well come to find the key behind it all  
  
We never stopped to see if we were still in step  
We never checked each others eyes  
To see who lived in there behind them  
And down the years we disappeared  
  
Lets go together  
Say no together  
Well tumble down the years  
Lets try together  
Lets lie together  
Well tumble down the years  
  
And though we never found the key behind it all  
I think we came to know the meaning of the fall  
  
Lets go together  
We said forever  
You and me against the world  
Hold on together  
And damn the river  
Well tumble down the years  
Well tumble down the years  
Well tumble down the years
