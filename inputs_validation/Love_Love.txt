Love love love  
There couldnt be a bad word I havent heard you say  
Dont you know the needs of any woman  
You speak words my ears have never heard of  
The only four letter word that you dont know is love love  
Love a word you never use love your lips never choose  
Its enough to make a woman want to give of  
The only four letter word that you dont know is love love  
 guitar   
It would tear me all to pieces if you ever came to me  
With more to give than one robbed kiss at nighttime  
Youll never know the longing that my heart does  
The only four letter word that you dont know is love love  
Love a word you never use
