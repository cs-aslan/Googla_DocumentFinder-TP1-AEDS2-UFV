Tumble down beside me here and now  
And then inside we can be sure  
That if the rain is only silver  
And the sun is only gold we wont be poor  
  
Sing a song around me here and now  
And then surround me with your eyes  
If it turns out that tomorrow we can fly  
I promise I wont be surprised  
  
And surely you must know by now  
That youve got me wondering how  
I was fortunate to find you  
  
Look upon me kindly here and now  
And then remind me Im alive  
Let me know I need not worry  
If the answers to my questions dont survive
