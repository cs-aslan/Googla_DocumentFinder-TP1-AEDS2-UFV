To love  
I have lost  
All that is self  
My memories have made the storm  
Now subsides casting my fate  
Inside your soul  
And these eyes  
Are mine no more  
To seek  
I pour myself in your virgin veins  
Now all that I see  
Is through a passions pain  
Cause Im all hung up over you  
Im losing myself  
Loving you  
Your wine is the blood  
That drunkens my heart  
With omens of love and now  
That I am you  
Woman I fear that youre not I  
Oh true love is so so bume and so blue  
The storm has passed  
Deep inside of me  
Crushed by the calm of my insecurity  
Cause Im all hung up over you  
Im losing myself  
Over you
