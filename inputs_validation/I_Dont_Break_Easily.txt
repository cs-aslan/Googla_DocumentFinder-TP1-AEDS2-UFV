I took my chances  
Thinking something might be saved  
Growing tired of broken promises  
And dreams you never made  
  
And I wanted to be more than just a friend  
Not knowing I would hurt so in the end  
So I swore Id never call you home again  
  
Took time to see through all the glitter  
That you made  
I was blinded by your fire light  
And swept myself away  
  
And I guess I couldnt bring myself to see  
You had taken all the very best of me  
So Im leaving while theres something left of me  
Just like a child I keep running back for more  
  
You know I thought I knew the answers  
Cause Ive been hurt before  
And one more time around wont break me  
You will never see that side of me  
No no no no  
I dont break easily  
  
I told my service to pick up all my calls  
And Ive taken down our photographs  
That lined our bedroom walls  
And the outside door no longer has your name  
All your clothes are gone  
  
My welcome mats been changed  
But the keys still there  
And Ive left the door unchained  
Just like a child I keep running back for more  
  
Oh I thought I knew all the answers  
Ive been hurt before  
And just one more time around  
Wont break me down  
  
You will never see that side of me  
No no no  
I dont break easily  
No no I wont break easily
