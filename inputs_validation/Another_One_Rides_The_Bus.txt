Riding in the bus down the boulevard  
And the place was pretty packed yeah  
Couldnt find a seat so I had to stand  
With the perverts in the back  
It was smelling like a locker room  
There was junk all over the floor  
Were already packed in like sardines  
But were stopping to pick up more look out  
  
Another one rides the bus  
Another one rides the bus  
Another comes on and another comes on  
Another one rides the bus  
Hey hes gonna sit by you  
Another one rides the bus  
  
Theres a suitcase poking me in the ribs  
Theres an elbow in my ear  
Theres a smelly old bum standing next to me  
Hasnt showered in a year  
I think Im missing a contact lens  
I think my wallets gone  
And I think this bus is stopping again  
To let a couple more freaks get on look out  
  
Another one rides the bus  
Another one rides the bus  
Another comes on and another comes on  
Another one rides the bus  
Hey hes gonna sit by you  
Another one rides the bus  
  
Another one rides the bus  
Another one rides the bus  
Another one rides the bus ow  
Another one rides the bus hey hey  
Another one rides the bus heyeyeyey  
  
The window doesnt open and the fan is broke  
And my face is turning blue yeah  
I havent been in a crowd like this  
Since I went to see the who  
Well I shouldve got off a couple miles ago  
But I couldnt get to the door  
There isnt any room for me to breathe  
And now were gonna pick up more  
  
Another one rides the bus  
Another one rides the bus  
Another comes on and another comes on  
Another one rides the bus  
Hey hes gonna sit by you  
Another one rides the bus
