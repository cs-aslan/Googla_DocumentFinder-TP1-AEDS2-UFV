Your dream make up is cracked and wearing thin  
Your eyes are on your chin  
Its getting hard for you  
But to make up is only makebelieve  
And we dont need a scene like this  
  
Whatever happened to the beautiful losers  
Whatever happened to the beautiful losers  
  
Your eyes closed and dreamed of places  
That you and I would go  
Its getting hard for me  
To love you like I used to  
I dont believe hello  
Do you  
  
Whatever happened to the beautiful losers  
Whatever happened to the beautiful losers
