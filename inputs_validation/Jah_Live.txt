Chorus  
Jah live Jah children  
Let Rastas never die  
  
When everything is going right  
They forget about your presents  
But when the tables turn upside down  
They know that youre there  
  
To my mom who taught me  
That youre always there  
I wrote this little  
Song of praise  
Now Im gonna sing  
  
Chorus  
  
The Rastaman call him Jah  
Some people call him Allah  
English man call Him God  
But he is one  
  
We may have different names  
To call him but he cares  
For everyone thats why I  
Wrote this song
