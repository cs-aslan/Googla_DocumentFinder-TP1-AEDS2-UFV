Ive been on this road a long time  
Ive been travellin for days  
But it seems Im getting nowhere  
I just cant find my way  
Ive been following directions  
But they must be out of date  
And I cant and I cant and I cant no I cant  
Decide which road to take  
  
See Ive got to find my baby  
Cause we need to work things out  
Ive got to see that woman  
I cannot do without her  
  
You know I cant wait cant wait another moment  
I cant wait I cant wait another heartbeat  
No I cant wait cant wait another moment  
I couldnt wait another heartbeat  
I cant wait until midnight  
  
And the nights go on forever  
These days I get no sleep  
And I miss her more than ever  
Inside where love runs deep  
Oh I know Im going to find her  
Cause Im following this star  
And I cant and I cant no I cant turn back  
Oh lord Ive come so far  
  
And Ill know shell whisper in my ear  
Bout all the things Ive missed  
Shes got that way about her now  
I never could resist  
  
And now I cant wait cant wait another moment  
No I cant wait I cant wait another heartbeat  
I cant wait cant wait another moment  
I couldnt wait another heartbeat  
I cant wait until midnight  
  
No I cant wait  
I cant wait another moment  
I couldnt wait another heartbeat  
I cant wait until the midnight  
  
Now I cant wait  
No no no cant wait  
No no no  
Cant wait  
No no no  
Cant wait  
repeat and fade out
