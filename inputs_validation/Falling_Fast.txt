I woke up and saw the sun today  
You came by without a warning  
You put a smile on my face  
I want that for every morning  
  
What is it Im feeling  
Cause I cant let it go  
If seeing is believing  
Then I already know  
  
Im falling fast  
I hope this lasts  
Im falling hard for you  
I say lets take a chance  
Take it while we can  
I know you feel it too  
  
Im falling fast  
Im falling fast  
  
It doesnt matter what we do  
You make everything seem brighter  
I never knew I needed you  
Like a sad time needs a sea of lighters  
  
What is it Im feeling  
Cause I cant let it go  
If seeing is believing  
I already know  
  
Im falling fast  
Cause I hope this lasts  
Cause Im falling hard for you  
I say lets take a chance  
Take it while we can  
Cause I know you feel it too  
  
Im falling fast  
Im falling fast  
  
I hope you know  
I hope it lasts  
Im falling hard Im falling fast  
We can go no holding back  
  
Im falling fast  
I hope this lasts  
Im falling hard for you  
I say lets take a chance  
Take it while we can  
I know you feel it too  
  
Im falling fast  
Im falling fast
