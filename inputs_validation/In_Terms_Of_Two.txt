You played the part of Miss Hardtoget  
And somehow you knew that I couldnt forget  
And though I dont think in terms of two  
I got it bad for you  
And when you passed me along the way  
I couldnt speak  
So you didnt stay  
And though I dont think in terms of two  
Youre breaking my heart  
Shaking me all apart  
Breaking my heart  
Shaking me all apart again  
When it appeared to me I was down  
And nothing I did could bring me around  
And though I dont think in terms of two  
I saw it there in you  
So now if youd only understand  
That without you here  
Id be half of a man  
And though I dont think in terms of two  
Youre breaking my heart  
Shakin me all apart  
Breaking my heart  
Shakin me all apart again  
Because of you  
Because of me  
The times not right  
I disagree  
Before you leave  
I want you to see  
Woah what youve done to me
