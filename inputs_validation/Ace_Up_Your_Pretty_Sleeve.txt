I take it out on you  
I take it out on me  
Dont take to a cruel world  
Very gracefully  
Im the cause and effect  
Of my own fourletter words  
Baby Im a good man  
No matter what you heard  
And Ill be there for you  
When you need me to be  
Ill be the sun at your door  
Ill be the wind in your trees  
If Ive nothin at all on the surface to see  
Ill be the ace up your pretty sleeve  
Oh yes I will  
Im sharp with my tongue  
I know I cut you inside  
But I make a concerted  
Effort at times  
To try to be more  
Than a fool in your eyes  
Baby I love you  
Dont you realize  
That Ill be there for you  
When you need me to be  
Ill be the sun at your door  
Ill be the wind in your trees  
If Ive nothin at all on the surface to see  
Ill be the ace up your pretty sleeve  
Oh up your pretty sleeve baby  
And Ill be there for you  
When you need me to be  
Ill be the sun at your door  
Ill be the wind in your trees  
If Ive nothin at all on the surface to see  
Ill be the ace up your pretty sleeve  
And if Ive nothin at all on the surface to see  
Ill be the ace up your pretty sleeve  
Oh yes I will  
An ace up your pretty sleeve
