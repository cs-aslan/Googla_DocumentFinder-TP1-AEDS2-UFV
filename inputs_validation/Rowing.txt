Dont know where Im going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling gotta row  
Dont know where Im going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling gotta row  
  
Moving is breathing and breathing is life  
Stopping is dying  
Youll be alright  
Life is a hammer waiting to drop  
Drifting the shallows and the rowing wont stop  
  
Dont know where Im going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling gotta row  
Dont know where Im going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling gotta row  
  
Cant see the sky nothings on the horizon  
Cant feel my hands and the water keeps risin  
Cant fall asleep cause I wake up dead  
I just keep polling I just keep rowing  
  
Dont know where Im going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling gotta row  
Dont know where Im going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling gotta row  
  
Rowing is living and living is hard  
But living beats losing all that we are  
All that we know of and all that we feel  
All we remember imagine the real  
All we remember imagine the real  
  
Hey  
  
I heard an echo but the answer had changed  
From the word I remembered  
That I started out sayin  
Living is cheating if youre not pulling oars  
The current is leaving  
Ill get mine  
You get yours  
  
Dont know where Im going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling gotta row  
Dont know where Im going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling gotta row  
  
Hey  
  
Rowing is bleeding bleeding is breathing  
Breathing is feeling running and freezing  
Were getting dirty but I started out clean  
  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on polling and  
Keep on polling and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing  
Keep on rowing  
  
Dont know where Im going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling gotta row  
Dont know where Im going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling gotta row  
  
Dont know where Im going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling gotta row  
Dont know where Im going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling gotta row
