I am the searcher of my fortunes  
Ive got my right hand on the wheel  
Weve got to dig for buried treasures  
I know exactly how i feel  
  
I went walkinthrough a graveyard  
Where the darkness is my friend  
I heard all about the beginning  
I want to see just where it ends  
  
I have fed the jaded tiger  
And every tiger knows my name  
But just as long as long as i can see my face  
I can tell myself my name  
  
Dont want to live inside myself  
Im much better of alone  
But then you must believe in the fallinrain  
In the morning  
  
Bury me down by the river  
Saved by the bell  
Man for all seasons
