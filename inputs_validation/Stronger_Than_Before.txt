Ive survived so many things  
From broken hearts to shattered dreams  
In every wall Ive found an open door  
Id miss a step Id learn to dance  
Come back again with half a chance  
Stronger than before  
There were times I couldnt see  
Beyond the blue inside of me  
A thousand miles away from shore  
But every moment every day  
With every step I find my way  
Stronger than before  
I believe in miracles I believe in dreams  
Through the pain Ive come to know  
How far the heart can reach  
A spark of hope in sorrows place  
Will shine with such amazing grace  
Stronger than before  
I believe in miracles I believe in dreams  
Through the pain Ive come to know  
How far the heart can reach  
A spark of hope in sorrows place  
Will shine with such amazing grace  
Stronger than before  
Stronger than before  
Stronger than before  
Stronger than before
