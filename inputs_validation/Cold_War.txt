Im tired of your psychology  
To bring me to my bended knees  
And if I could only talk to you  
Im sure that I could make you see  
Cause time has a way  
Of bringing even mountains down down down  
Storm clouds are coming  
I suggest you head for higher ground  
  
I say youre a thing of the past  
And you aint gonna last  
No matter what you say or do  
Its all caught up to you  
  
Youre dutyfree youre taxexempt  
You party with the President  
And you dance the dance so naturally  
Why not believe youre heavensent  
But time has a way of bringing  
Even mountains down down down  
Theres a storm cloud acomin  
I insist you head for higher ground  
  
You talk talk and you get so intense  
That you almost make sense  
And thats what scares me the most  
You as the host of Celebrity Lies  
Its prime time baby  
Cant you see in my eyes its a  
  
Cold warrunnin in the streets  
Everybody you meet knows  
Its going down dont you know  
Cold warblowing in the air  
Everyone everywhere says its time  
To get ready for a cold war  
Dont you look now  
But the skinny boys becoming a man  
  
You say its the luck of the draw  
And you cant have it all  
And Ill die young trying to make it  
Into something that aint gonna last  
You ought to reconsider  
Cause Im coming fast with a  
  
Cold warrunning in the streets  
Everybody you meet  
Knows its going down dont you know  
Cold warblood is in the air  
Everyone everywhere says its time  
To get ready for a cold warlooking at me  
From behind every tree  
Theres a scared man running from a  
Cold wardont you look now  
But the skinny boys a streetfighting man  
  
extra verses sung in concert during the Kilroy tour  
Try as you will you cant escape the chill  
that penetrates your clothing  
demanding that you feel  
all the trouble that surrounds you  
the bad mixed with the good  
the heartless bits of data waiting to be understood  
Information Central promptly processed your request  
the task were told honestly requires you acquiesce  
  
Well blind faith put you where you are now  
Youre a selfish old cow gettin high on societys milk  
We pay your bills life should be so tough  
Youd better watch your fat ass cause weve had enough
