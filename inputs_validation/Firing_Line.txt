Firing Line  
I know you since youve been born  
Raising hell even as a child  
Nothings change since that day  
You still are runnin wild  
How hell Im gonna tell you  
And closer barriers are passing by  
Well you left this state and running  
Is air too smooth these days  
I think its time to come down  
youll gonna have to mend your way  
Put your head up in the clouds  
Can not see through the haze  
  
Step outside Take a look around  
Do you see anyone who cares  
Passed your whole life stepping on your friends  
Still your in nowhere  
Search for a new direction  
But the Past is all youll find  
You can count upon your mistake  
Blame it on your criminal mind  
When you lay down your snakes  
Come up poisoned every time
