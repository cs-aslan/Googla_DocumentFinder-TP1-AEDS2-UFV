Ive been so happy since I walked away  
I never thought that I could feel as great as I do today  
Cause you were nothing but a big mistake  
And life is wonderful now that Im rid of you  
  
Oh I must have been crazy to have stayed with you  
I cant believe I thought I was in love with you  
But now the scales have fallen I can really see  
And I say go to hell cause thats where you took me  
  
Well Ive felt better since I slammed that door  
You always cramped my style I never noticed before  
Its been a nonstop party since I flew the coop  
I cant believe I fell for such a loser like you  
  
And is it any wonder that I felt so blue  
When I was always having to put up with you  
  
Oh here we go again just lay the blame on me  
Dont say another word cause sweetheart youre history  
  
I know that you miss me really bet you wish that you still had me  
Youll never find someone like me but Ive got no regrets at all  
  
Because Ive met this girl and shes so good to me  
Shes really beautiful fantastic company  
And when Im with her I realise what love can be  
Because shes fifty times the person youll ever be  
  
Good luck mister do you think I care  
Since youve been gone the offers have been everywhere  
Ive got a million guys just lining up for me  
Ive turned a corner boy my life is ecstasy  
  
Well Ive been in heaven since I walked away  
I never thought that I could feel as great as I do today  
Cause you were nothing but a waste of space  
And life is wonderful now that Im over you  
Over you  
Over you
