He says he loves her what can you say to that  
Hes made up his mind and there aint nothin you can do  
And as you swallow hard maybe you drive all night  
Tryin to figure out where the whole thing started goin wrong  
And in the silence something begins to unravel  
You never knew him like youll be knowing him now  
  
Chorus  
Fallin out of love and back into your life  
Pullin your heart out from under the knife  
Closin the door on all those dreams you used to know  
Fallin out of love and back on your feet  
Turnin away from that dead end street  
Finding out that nothing feels as good as letting go  
  
Thats when he called you up out of the blue one day  
And you know he thinks hes talkin to the girl you used to be  
So when you tell him hes just a memory  
Aint it funny how his voice cracks when youre sayin goodbye  
And in the silence something begins to unravel  
He never knew you like hell be knowing you now  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh and nothing feels as good as letting go  
He said he loved her
