Here we come walkin  
Down the street  
We get the funniest looks from  
Everyone we meet  
  
Hey hey were the Monkees  
And people say we monkey around  
But were too busy singing  
To put anybody down  
  
We go wherever we want to  
Do what we like to do  
We dont have time to get restless  
Theres always something new  
  
Hey hey were the Monkees  
And people say we monkey around  
But were too busy singing  
To put anybody down  
  
Were just tryin to be friendly  
Come and watch us sing and play  
Were the young generation  
And weve got something to say  
Any time Or anywhere  
Just look over your shoulder  
Guess wholl be standing there  
  
Hey hey were the Monkees  
And people say we monkey around  
But were too busy singing  
To put anybody down  
  
Hey hey were the Monkees  
And people say we monkey around  
But were too busy singing  
To put anybody down  
Were just tryin to be friendly  
Come and watch us sing and play  
Were the young generation  
And weve got something to say  
Hey hey were the Monkees  
Hey hey were the Monkees  
  
Hey hey were the Monkees  
You never know where well be found  
So youd better get ready  
We may be comin to your town
