In this dirty old part of the city  
Where the sun refuse to shine  
People tell me there aint no use in tryin  
  
My little girl youre so young and pretty yeah  
And one thing I know is true  
Youre gonna die before your time is through  
  
You see my daddy in bed a dyin  
You see his hair is turnin gray  
Hes been workin and slavin his life away  
  
My daddys been workin workin every day  
Workin slavin his life away  
Workin oh yeah my daddys been  
Work work work oh yeah  
  
We gotta get outta this place  
If its the last thing we ever do  
We gotta get outta this place  
Girl theres a better life for me and you  
Me and you babe  
  
My daddys been workin  
Workin slavin his life away  
Workin ah workin every day  
Work work work oh yeah  
  
We gotta get outta this place  
If its the last thing we ever do  
We gotta get outta this place  
Girl theres a better life for me and you  
For me and you babe  
  
We gotta get outta this place  
If its the last thing we ever do  
We gotta get outta this place  
Girl theres a better life

Theres gotta be a better life for me and you
