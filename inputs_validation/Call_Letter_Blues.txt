Well I walked all night long  
Listenin to them church bells tone  
Yes I walked all night long  
Listenin to them church bells tone  
Either someone needing mercy  
Or maybe something Ive done wrong  
  
Well your friends come by for you  
I dont know what to say  
Well your friends come by for you  
I dont know what to say  
I just cant face up to tell em  
Honey you just went away  
  
Well children cry for mother  
I tell them Mother took a trip  
Well children cry for mother  
I tell them Mother took a trip  
Well I walk on pins and needles  
I hope my tongue dont slip  
  
Well I gaze at passing strangers  
In case I might see you  
Yes I gaze at passing strangers  
In case I might see you  
But the sun goes around the heavens  
And another day just drives on through  
  
Way out in the distance  
I know youre with some other man  
Way out in the distance  
I know youre with some other man  
But thats alright baby  
You know I always understand  
  
Call girls in the doorway  
All giving me the eye  
Call girls in the doorway  
All giving me the eye  
But my hearts just not in it  
I might as well pass right on by  
  
My ears are ringin  
Ringin like empty shells  
My ears are ringin  
Ringin like empty shells  
Well it cant be no guitar player  
It must be convent bells
