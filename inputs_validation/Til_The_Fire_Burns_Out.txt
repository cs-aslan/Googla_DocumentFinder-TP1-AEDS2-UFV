Theres a home fire in your eyes thats burns me gently  
Theres a warmth that Ive never known before  
In your arms I hear a whisper of forever  
This is all I ask and nothing more  
  
When the nights are turning cold  
If the fire is burning low  
Say that you wont go  
Til the fires burned out  
Dont let the fire burn out  
  
Baby hold me now like theres no tomorrow  
The fires lit the flame is burning true  
I know we could swim the sea of sorrow  
As long as theres one spark to see us through  
  
So when the nights are turning cold  
If the fire is burning low  
Say that you wont go  
Til the fires burned out  
Dont let the fire burn out  
Dont let the fire burn out  
  
So many empty nights  
So many broken dreams  
Too many lovers lost  
In the lonely crowd  
  
So when the nights are turning cold  
If the fire is burning low  
Say that you wont go  
Promise you wont go  
Say that you wont go  
Til the fires burned out  
Dont let the fire burn out  
Dont let the fire burn out  
Dont let the fire burn out  
Oh let it burn  
Let it burn let it burn  
Dont let the fire burn out  
Oh let it burn  
Dont let the fire burn out  
Let it burn let it burn  
Dont let the fire burn out
