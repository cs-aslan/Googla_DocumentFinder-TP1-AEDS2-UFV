Lonely hearted hunter dont say nothing  
The hunger and the hurt got only one law  
Never mind your words unseen unheard unsung undone  
Aint but one place left to run  
Stand up stand and fight  
  
Undercover creature that dont see sunshine  
Make it in the dark  
Dont think twice never mind making nice  
Black eyes black sights black magical rites Tonight there comes a time
babe  
Stand up stand and fight  
  
Dont you worry about me little darling no  
I aint breaking Im shaking and aching  
Cause I cant stand waiting  
There comes a time to stand and fight  
  
Maximum destruction blood red deadheads  
Tearing it up wearing it down  
Never mind my name Im unclaimed  
Unnamed and unashamed  
Id like to say fan the flames  
Stand and fight  
  
You aint doing nobody no kind of favors  
Lying around like a rug on the floor  
Sooner or later youve got to stand up  
And say you wont take it any more  
Stand up stand and fight
