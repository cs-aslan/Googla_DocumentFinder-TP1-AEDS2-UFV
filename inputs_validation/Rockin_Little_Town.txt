Thats right  
Yeah  
  
Big bad machine still makin the scene  
Big wheels keep on turnin  
Step on the gas gone in a flash  
Rubber just keeps on burnin  
Cause every night is a Saturday night  
No matter what town were in  
Open the doors kick out the lights  
Just let the party begin  
  
Were just watchin the world from this big ass bus  
The highway is home to folks like us  
Makin good music keepin it alive  
Slip in slip out of your rockin little town tonight  
Yeah thats what we do  
  
Get into town lay our head down  
Really aint nothin to do  
Watchin the clock get ready to rock  
We aint no different than you  
  
Cause every night is a Saturday night  
No matter what town were in  
Open the doors kick out the lights  
Yeah let the party begin  
  
Were just watchin the world from this big ass bus  
The highway is home to folks like us  
Makin good music keepin it alive  
Slip in slip out  
Of your rockin little town tonight
