Chorus  
After a while after a while  
This too shall pass  
After a while  
Scars will heal youll love again  
It wont hurt you after a while  
It wont hurt after a while  
  
Stuck between if and when  
You pray and tried  
But still no end  
Gods purpose soon youll understand  
It wont hurt you after a while  
It wont hurt you after a while  
  
Chorus  
  
So when the pain has come to an end  
And now your heart is whole again  
Help someone who needs to know  
That it wont hurt them after a while  
It wont hurt them after a while  
It wont hurt them after a while
