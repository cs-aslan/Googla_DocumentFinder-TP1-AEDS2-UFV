Uno due tre  
Well if you dont like it  
Go ahead find yourself a saint  
Go ahead now try to find a boy  
Whos gonna be all the things I aint  
What you need is a plastic doll  
With a fresh coat of paint  
Whos gonna sit through the madness  
And always act so quaint  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
With your new friends  
Youre really making a scene  
Ive seen you bouncing around  
From machine to machine  
And you know  
Theyre never real  
Theyre never what they seem  
And you can try to generate some warmth  
And you see just what I mean  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
And if Im acting like a king  
Well thats cause Im a human being  
I want too many things  
And thats cause Im a human being  
And if Ive got to dream  
I said well Im a human being  
And if it gets to be obscene yeah  
Im a human being  
  
And I just go around with my head hung down  
Just like a human being and all those human beings  
I can hold my head so high  
Just like a human Im a riffraff human being  
  
Wont you give me a little sip  
Why dont you try me on a drag of that cigarette  
Why dont you try to give me something that  
Ill never ever forget  
But now dont you blow it all  
On a million dollar bet  
Because youre liable to lose it  
On the best lovin youve had yet  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
And if Im acting like a king  
Well thats cause Im a human being  
And if I want too many things  
Thats cause Im a human being  
And if Ive got to dream  
I said well Im a human being  
And if it gets to be obscene yeah  
Im a human being  
  
And I just go around with my head hung down  
Just like a human being and all those human beings  
I can hold my head so high  
Just like a human Im a riff raff human being  
  
In fact Im talking about the human race  
Trying to cover up the big disgrace  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Yeah yeah oh yeah  
Well I may think that this whole scene  
Is too appalling for me  
Or I may be the type who is just a mad about  
Everything that I see  
But I cant cover this with history  
Or make it just what I want it to be  
Im blowing my change on the fan magazines  
With all the Hollywood refugees  
Said yeah yeah oh yeah  
  
And If Im acting like a king  
Thats cause Im a human being  
And if I want too many things  
Thats cause Im a human being  
And if Ive got to dream  
I said well Im a human being  
And if it gets to be obscene yeah  
Im a human being
