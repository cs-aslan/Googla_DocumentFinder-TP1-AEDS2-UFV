Youre not sure what you want to do  
with your life  
but you sure dont want me in it  
Yeah youre sure the life youre  
living with me  
cant go on one single minute  
And theres a new one waiting  
outside this door  
and nows the time to begin it  
  
You found a new world and  
you want to taste it  
But that world can turn cold and  
you better face it  
  
Who will you run to when it all falls down  
Whos gonna pick you world up off the ground  
Whos gonna take away the tears you cry  
Whos gonna love you baby as good as I  
  
You wont know what its like to live  
on your own  
Youve always had me there beside you  
You think its easy finding  
someone out there  
whos gonna care as much as I do  
Whats gonna happen baby  
when you find out  
that theres no one there to cry to  
  
You can tell the whole world how youre  
gonna make it  
You can follow you heart but what ya do  
when someone breaks it  
  
Who will you run to when it all falls down  
Whos gonna pick you world up off the ground  
Whos gonna take away the tears you cry  
Whos gonna love you baby as good as I  
  
You found a new world and  
you want to taste it  
But that world can turn cold and  
you better face it  
  
Who will you run to when it all falls down  
Whos gonna pick you world up off the ground  
Whos gonna take away the tears you cry  
Whos gonna love you baby as good as I  
  
Who will you run to when it all falls down  
Whos gonna pick your world up off the ground  
Whos gonna take away the tears you cry  
Whos gonna love you baby as good as I
