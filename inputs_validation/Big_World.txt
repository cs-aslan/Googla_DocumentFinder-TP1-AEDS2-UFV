You woke me from my sleep we quietly crept  
Outside  
This memory Ill keep of bitter crimson  
Winter sunrise lost in the icy silence  
Our warm breath fading in the air  
Im not sure why I tell you still less what I mean  
Its like a dream and maybe theres no cause  
But in the end its  
What you can give to someone  
How you can help to set them free  
Big world is turning as we dream tonight  
Big world weve got so out of tune with you  
Now we have to put it right  
Big world help us through  
Get us through the night  
This world is wounded now and we inflict  
The pain  
We have to change our lives and think again  
Cause in the end its  
All that were sure were made of  
All that we know to set us free  
Big world is turning as we dream tonight  
Big world weve got so out of tune with you  
Now we have to put it right  
Big world help us through  
Get us through the night  
Keep on rolling through the night  
Cause the big world is never gonna let you down  
If we learn to treat her right  
Then the big world is never gonna let us down
