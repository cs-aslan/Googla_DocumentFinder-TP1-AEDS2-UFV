All friends are gone my heart it burns like fire  
When the night comes falling falling from the sky  
I was so wrong how could I loose my desire  
How many times can we say goodbye  
Love is a sacrifice  
You have to head between the lies  
  
Chorus   
If Ill never see the sun again  
If Ill never have your helping hand  
If Ill never see a children smile  
My would is lost  
If we dont try  
  
Im so alone  I cannot stand it forever  
Sometimes I feel like I cant stand the pain  
All that I want we cant do it together  
Only with you I feel like Im born again  
No matter what I do  
I do it baby just for you  
  
Chorus
