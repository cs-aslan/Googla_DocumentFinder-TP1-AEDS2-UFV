Come on in and take me on an override  
Been stuck inside and up all night at Daves  
Now troubles far away and mother in her cage  
And nothings gonna pinch this nerve of mine  
  
I want to make it right  
  
Close the door and pull the shades  
And climb the walls  
Feel medicine heal the lines of age  
Im here and now Im gone  
Im there and far beyond  
And nothings gonna pinch this nerve of mine  
Nothings gonna pinch this nerve of mine  
  
I want to make it right  
  
Im on the wire over and higher  
Over the pretense over the spire why  
On and connected Im over floating now  
Im over floating alone  
  
Hold the potion up  
Tear your shadow down  
Remember to forget and then rename your shame  
  
I want to make it right  
  
Im on the wire over and higher  
Over the pretense over the spire why  
On and connected Im over floating now  
Im over floating alone
