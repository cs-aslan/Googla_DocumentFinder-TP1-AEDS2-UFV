girl you love take a chance  
give romance lets dance  
  
  
Stop wondering where  
And wondering when  
Your love and emotion should show  
  
  
Chorus  
Why dont you believe  
why dont you believe  
There is no mystery  
Oh why cant you see  
why cant you see  
Its just for you and me  
  
  
girl you love take a chance  
give romance lets dance  
  
  
Let your love desire  
Put time and the place  
All your emotions  
Go flow
