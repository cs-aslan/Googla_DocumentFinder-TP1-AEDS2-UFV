All right girls Ill show you what to do  
This boat will sparkle like a diamond when we get through  
By the numbers there aint much time  
Were gonna start an assembly line  
Hey Hey Hey Hey  
Hey Hey Hey Hey  
You get the sandpaper you get the pails  
You get the hammer baby you get the nails  
You get the paint you get the brush  
Cause were gonna give it the special touch  
Hey Hey Hey Hey  
Hey Hey Hey Hey  
We got a magic potion that will help us win  
I dont know how to spell it but dip right in  
Blakooxytonic phosphate its the latest scoop  
But thats all right girls you can call it Goop  
Hey Hey Hey Hey

Tote that paintbrush and lift that pail  
Get a rhythm going nice and easy  
Come on and use a little elbow greasy

Well fall right down and have some fun  
And Im gonna kiss you all one by one
