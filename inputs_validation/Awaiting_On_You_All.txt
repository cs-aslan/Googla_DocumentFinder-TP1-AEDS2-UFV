You dont need no love in  
You dont need no bed pan  
You dont need a horoscope or a microscope  
The see the mess that youre in  
If you open up your heart  
Youll see what I mean  
Weve been polluted so long  
Now heres a way for you to get clean  
  
By chanting the names of the Lord and youll be free  
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see  
Chanting the names of the Lord and youll be free  
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see  
  
You dont need no passport  
And you dont need no visas  
You dont need to designate or to emigrate  
Before you can see Jesus  
If you open up your heart  
Youll see hes right there  
Always was and will be  
Hell relieve you of your cares  
  
By chanting the names of the Lord and youll be free  
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see  
Chanting the names of the Lord and youll be free  
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see  
  
You dont need no church house  
And you dont need no Temple  
You dont need no rosary beads or them books to read  
To see that you have fallen  
If you open up your heart  
You will know what I mean  
Weve been kept down so long  
Someones thinking that were all green  
  
And while the Pope owns fifty one percent of General Motors  
And the stock exchange is the only thing hes qualified to quote us  
The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see  
By chanting the names of the Lord and youll be free
