Saturday afternoon  
The sunshine pours like wine  
Through the window  
  
And I know golden June  
Can turn an empty gray  
Against your window  
  
And I feel like Im on the outside  
Of the circle  
  
If I walk by the trees  
Ill catch the falling leaves  
If the wind blows  
  
But I know all this means is  
Whiling on the hours  
Watching sideshows  
  
And I feel like Im on the outside  
Of the circle  
  
Will I turn my coat to the rain  
I dont know  
But Im going somewhere I can warm my bones  
  
Fare you well Ill carry me away  
And sing to those I know  
Upon their birthdays  
  
And I wont feel like Im on the outside  
I wont feel like Im on the outside  
I wont feel like Im on the outside  
Of the circle
