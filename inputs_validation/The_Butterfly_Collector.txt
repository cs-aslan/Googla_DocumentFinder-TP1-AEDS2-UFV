So you finally got what you wanted  
Youve achieved your aim by making me walk in line  
And when you just cant get any higher  
You use your senses to cuss out this weeks climber  
And the small fame that youve acquired  
Has brought you into cult status  
But to me youre still a collector  
  
Chorus  
Theres tarts and whores but youre much more  
Youre a different kind cause you want their minds  
And you just dont care cause youve got no pride  
Its just a face on your pillowcase  
That thrills you  
  
And you started looking much older  
And your fashion sense is second rate like your perfume  
But to you in your little dream world  
Youre still the queen of the butterfly collectors  
  
As you carry on cause its all you know  
You cant light a fire  
You cant cook or sew  
You get from day to day by filling your head  
But surely you must know the appeal between your legs  
Has worn off  
  
And I dont care about morals  
Cause the worlds insane and were all to blame anyway  
And I dont feel any sorrow  
Towards the kings and queens of the butterfly collectors  
  
Chorus  
  
As you carry on cause its all you know  
You cant light a fire  
You cant cook or sew  
You get from day to day by filling your head  
But surely you must know the appeal between your legs  
Has worn off  
  
And I dont feel any sorrow  
Towards the kings and queens of the butterfly collectors
