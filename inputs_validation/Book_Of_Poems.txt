Rowboat lightning I kissed her yeah it didnt mean a thing  
Seems like years ago it was yesterday  
Fire drill yell freeze dont hang around long face disease  
I got a book of poems thats gonna set you free  
Well its bad luck and its a hard luck story  
And Im sorry I aint sticking around  
I got a real bad feeling that a book of poems aint enough  
Well its a sick world and sixteen days  
I got nightmares every night  
I got a real bad feeling that a book of poems aint enough  
Hardcore uptown not the kind of place you wanna settle down  
I only walked her home but that was bad enough  
Two trains yell freeze it was a headon cold now its a love disease  
I got a book of poems you gotta see to believe
