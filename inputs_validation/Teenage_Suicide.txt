Times rollin forward  
Im gettin bored  
Layin on my back  
Im losin track  
Shifting patterns  
And nothin matters  
Cause theres no one here  
Ive lost my fear  
  
Well Ive got no place left to hide  
Im runnin out of time  
Moving slowly  
The walls are closing  
In on me  
I can not see  
Appearing fine well  
Thats all a lie  
Cause Im not alright  
  
Extinct inside  
Im runnin out of time  
My mother says Im fine  
A teenage suicide  
No place to hide  
Well Ive got no place left to hide  
No place to hide  
Well Im runnin out of time  
No place to hide  
Ya Ive got no place left to hide  
No place to hide  
A teenage suicide
