I went home with a waitress the way I always do  
How was I to know she was with the Russians too  
  
I was gambling in Havana  I took a little risk  
Send lawyers guns and money  
Dad get me out of this  
  
An innocent bystander  
Somehow I got stuck between a rock and a hard place  
And Im down on my luck  
Yes Im down on my luck  
Well Im down on my luck  
  
Im hiding in Honduras  Im a desperate man  
Send lawyers guns and money  
The shit has hit the fan  
  
Send lawyers guns and money
