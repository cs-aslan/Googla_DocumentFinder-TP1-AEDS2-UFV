Youre taking the fun out of everything  
Youre making me run when I dont want to think  
Youre taking the fun out of everything  
I dont want to think at all  
  
Chorus  
Theres no other way  
Theres no other way  
All that you can do is watch them play  
  
Youre taking the fun out of everything  
Youre making it clear when I dont want to think  
Youre taking me up when I dont want to go up anymore  
Im just watching it all  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill watch you play  
Ill watch you play  
  
Chorus
