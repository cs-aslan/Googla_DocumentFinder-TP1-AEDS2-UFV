It was a night yeah the kind of night  
Left me pacing cross the floor  
It was a dream like those other dreams  
So many times before  
I went back to the old town  
To the streets I used to roam  
And I looked into my daddys eyes  
And asked that fatal question whyd  
You have to go   
You had to go  
  
There was a time when life was good  
And everything felt so right  
I dont know why I never understood  
Why you left us on that night  
I went back to that day when you left us on our own   
Now I look into my babys eyes  
And I just know there is no way  
Id ever go  
Ill never go  
  
Take me to the mountainside  
Far away from here  
Where my eyes are open wide   
No one gets too near
