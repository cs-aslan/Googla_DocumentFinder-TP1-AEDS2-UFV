Dont ask me just how it happened  
I wish I knew  
I cant believe that it happened  
And still its true  
  
I got lost in his arms  
And I had to stay  
It was dark in his arms  
And I lost my way  
From the dark came a voice  
And it seemed to say  
There ya go there ya go  
How I felt as I fell  
I just cant recall  
But his arms held me fast  
And it broke the fall  
And I said to my heart  
As it foolishly kept jumping around  
I got lost but look what I found  
  
I got lost in his arms  
And I had to stay  
It was dark in his arms  
And I lost my way  
From the dark came a voice  
And it seemed to say  
There ya go there ya go  
How I felt as I fell  
I just cant recall  
But his arms held me fast  
And it broke the fall  
And I said to my heart  
As it foolishly kept jumping around  
I got lost but look what I found
