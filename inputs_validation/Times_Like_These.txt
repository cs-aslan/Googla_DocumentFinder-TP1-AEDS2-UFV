Baby will you be my girl  
Kristi will you be my girl  
Ill take you to a better place  
Theres no pain and no disgrace in a perfect world  
  
Well drive that ragtop cadillac  
Well drive that ragtop cadillac  
Straight across the nevada line  
Radio playin hair flying  
No turning back  
  
Chorus  
Hey babe I live for times like these  
Hey babe I live for times like these  
Baby I live for times like these  
Give me a reason to believe  
  
For a moment times stands still  
For a moment times stands still  
I feel no shame I feel no violence  
For the moment and in the silence  
I feel that peace  
  
Hey babe I live for times like these  
Hey babe I live for times like these  
Baby I live for times like these  
Give me a reason to believe  
  
Solo  
  
Sun rises in the east  
Sun rises in the east  
For a moment in your eyes  
I catch a glimpse of a different life  
Smile at fate  
  
Hey babe I live for times like these  
Hey babe I live for times like these  
Baby I live for times like these  
Give me a reason to believe  
  
Theres no famous final scene no movie starts  
No limousines everything well leave behind  
Theres no waiting on the other side  
Just you and me for a better place  
I swear I live for times like these  
Youre all I need  
Thats all I need  
Youre all I need
