I believe that love and trust are one in the same  
I dont think you can truly love somebody unless you trust them  
That blind trust that beyond a shadow of a doubt  
No matter what this person sayin that person  
You believe your man  
Now you say you love me  
But every time one of your little friends come at you with something  
We gotta do this  
Mama Im tryin Im trying to show you that Im for real  
Tell me what I gotta do to show you that Im for you  
  
Just shut up and listen  
  
Two hundred and sixteen  
Thats how many times that I went  
Back and forth about it in my mind  
Could she could she really be  
Who hes telling me that she is  
Theres something about it  
That dont feel right  
  
Said today she called here twentysix times  
I know you counted  
You kept telling me not to worry  
Dont worry bout it  
Wanna believe that youre telling the truth  
So dont doubt it  
But if you are lying to me  
  
Youre leaving tonight  
Out of my life  
Everyone said you aint no good  
Then you prove them right  
Youre leaving tonight  
Its over and done  
Aint no sense in trying to wait till the morning comes  
Youre leaving tonight  
  
Baby now hold up  
Lets just settle down  
Cause theres a perfect explanation to this situation  
That were goin through  
This thing that were goin through  
I swear I dont know that girl  
But I seen her round  
And shes expressed how much she want it  
But baby Im not on that

Said I got a girl like a thousand times  
So you counted  
She kept telling me not to worry

Really wish you would believe in me

Its over and done  
Lets leave this alone and lets make love  
Till the morning come

Oh I wont deny  
That everything in my body  
Wants to know that youre the one  
So whats the problem girl  
See I cant take this serious when youre just having fun  
No Im not just having fun  
Steady running around making a fool of me oh  
Baby girl you cant listen to everyone
