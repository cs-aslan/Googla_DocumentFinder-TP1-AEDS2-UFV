Mmm baby when I take you out tonight  
Fix your hair dress up right  
Paint your fingertips nice and red  
But leave your sweet sweet lips alone  
  
Little Lucy dontcha put no lipstick on  
Little Lucy dontcha put no lipstick on  
Before the night is through  
Im gonna kiss it right off  
Right off of you  
  
Baby you can wear your French perfume  
The pink chenise that rocks the room  
But if you want a little old love to bloom  
Leave your sweet sweet lips alone  
  
Little Lucy dontcha put no lipstick on  
Little Lucy dontcha put no lipstick on  
Before the night is through  
Im gonna kiss it right off  
Off of you  
  
Baby do you want the folks to know  
How your lips mmm thrill me so  
Every little kiss we share well show  
So leave your sweet sweet lips alone  
  
Little Lucy dontcha put no lipstick on  
Little Lucy dontcha put no lipstick on  
Before the night is through  
Im gonna kiss it right off  
Right off of you  
  
Yeah Little Lucy  
Dontcha put no lipstick on  
Baby dont you do it
