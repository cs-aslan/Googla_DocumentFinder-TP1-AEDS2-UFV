I was there when you cried like a baby  
When you thought that maybe  
Things werent goin your way  
I was there when you asked me  
Just cause you asked me and I didnt hesitate  
  
Now that I need you you turn away  
Like I was nothing like it was a big mistake  
Come on baby you know it aint right  
Tell me how do you sleep at night  
  
I wont behave sit quietly by while you take  
Everything that I keep inside of me  
I wont be still Oh no not I  
Cause theres no way that Id stay here  
Id rather die than love you  
Id rather die than love you  
You know that I would rather die  
  
It isnt fair to take someones heart  
Tear it apart use it like you dont care  
How does it feel to be hurt  
Its gonna get worse  
Its gonna get ugly I swear  
  
How many tears can one person cry  
How much is enough  
Whens it time to say goodbye  
Come on baby you know it aint right  
Tell me how do you sleep at night
