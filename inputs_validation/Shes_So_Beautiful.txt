Cool as ice yet brittle as glass  
A nervous wreck with a sweet facade  
Youre breaking up  
Youre breaking up now baby  
Youre breaking up your life  
Into little pieces  
Baby  
  
Vanity arrived with fame  
How she loved to see her name  
She is beautiful very beautiful  
Look at her and shes a model  
  
Hey girl I love you but you wont listen  
To what Im trying to say  
Things wont work out if you plan them now  
Dont throw your love away  
Give it up baby  
Honey give it up and come back to me  
  
You know your just an able sum  
To get more money  
For them youre just a product  
For me youre the one I love

Oh no I need her near me every single day  
Please dont take her away  
I need my love
