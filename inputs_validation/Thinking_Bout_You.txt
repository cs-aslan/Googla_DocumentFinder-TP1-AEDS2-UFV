Verse 1  
Ive been thinking bout you  
Yeah I been missing you  
Where the hell are you oh when I need you  
I could still hear your voice  
I aint got no choice cause Im here all alone  
I know I cant wait til you get home  
  
PreChorus  
Oh I dont have you here with me  
But at least I have the memory  
I tried to make it through the night  
But I cant control my mind  
  
Chorus  
Im just thinkin bout you  
Im thinkin bout you Im thinkin bout you  
Im just thinkin bout you  
Im thinkin bout you Im thinkin bout you  
  
Verse 2  
Got these thoughts in my head  
Aint no way to forget  
Got me losing my breath  
Nobody got me the way that you did  
Had my eyes rolling back  
Had me arching my back  
Now you love me so good  
I wish you would hurry up and come back  
  
PreChorus  
Oh I dont have you here with me  
But at least I have the memory  
I tried to make it through the night  
But I cant control my mind  
  
Chorus  
Im just thinkin bout you  
Im thinkin bout you Im thinkin bout you baby  
Im just thinkin bout you  
Im thinkin bout you Im thinkin bout you  
Im just thinkin bout you  
Im thinkin bout you Im thinkin bout you  
  
Bridge  
Baby I dont want no one no one else  
So hurry cause I need some need some need some help  
And Ill be waiting patient patiently  
Cause I dont have you here with here with here with me  
But at least I have the memory  
  
Chorus
