I dont mind it  
I dont mind at all  
Its like youre the swing set  
And Im the kid that falls  
Its like the way we fight  
The times Ive cried  
We come to blows  
And every night  
The passions there  
So its got to be right  
Right  
  
No I dont believe you  
When you say dont come around here no more  
I wont remind you  
You said we wouldnt be apart  
No I dont believe you  
When you say you dont need me anymore  
So dont pretend to  
Not love me at all  
  
I dont mind it  
I still dont mind at all  
Its like one of those bad dreams  
When you cant wake up  
It looks like youve given up  
Youve had enough  
But I want more  
No I wont stop  
Because I just know  
Youll come around  
Right  
  
No I dont believe you  
When you say dont come around here no more  
I wont remind you  
You said we wouldnt be apart  
No I dont believe you  
When you say you dont need me anymore  
So dont pretend to  
Not love me at all  
  
Just dont stand there and watch me fall  
Because I because I still dont mind at all  
  
Its like the way we fight  
The times Ive cried  
We come to blows  
And every night  
The passions there  
So its got to be right  
Right  
  
No I dont believe you  
When you say dont come around here no more  
I wont remind you  
You said we wouldnt be apart  
No I dont believe you  
When you say you dont need me anymore  
So dont pretend to  
Not love me at all  
  
I dont believe you
