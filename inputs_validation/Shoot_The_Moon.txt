The summer days are gone too soon  
You shoot the moon  
And miss completely  
And now youre left to face the gloom  
The empty room that once smelled sweetly  
Of all the flowers you plucked if only  
You knew the reason  
Why you had to each be lonely  
Was it just the season  
  
Now the fall is here again  
You cant begin to give in  
Its all over  
  
When the snows come rolling through  
Youre rolling too with some new lover  
Will you think of times youve told me  
That you knew the reason  
Why we had to each be lonely  
It was just the season  
  
Will you think of times youve told me  
That you knew the reason  
Why we had to each be lonely  
It was just the season
