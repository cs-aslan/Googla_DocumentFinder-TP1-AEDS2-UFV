And you can fly  
High as a kite if you want to  
Faster than light if you want to  
Speeding through the universe  
Thinking is the best way to travel  
  
Its all a dream  
Light passing by on the screen  
And theres you and I on the beam  
Speeding through the universe  
Thinking is the best way to travel  
  
We ride the waves  
Distance is gone will we find out  
How life bean will be find out  
Speeding through the universe  
Thinking is the best way to travel  
  
And you can fly  
High as a kite if you want to  
Faster than light if you want to  
Speeding through the universe  
Thinking is the best way to travel
