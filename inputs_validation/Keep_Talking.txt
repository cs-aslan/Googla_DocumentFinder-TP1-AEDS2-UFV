For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals  
Then something happenend which unleashed the power of our imagination  
We learned to talk  
  
Theres a silence surrounding me  
I cant seem to think straight  
Ill sit in the corner  
No one can bother me  
  
I think I should speak now  
Why wont you talk to me  
I cant seem to speak now  
You never talk to me  
  
My words wont come out right  
What are you thinking  
I feel like Im drowning  
What are you feeling  
  
Im feeling weak now  
You never talk to me  
But I cant show my weakness  
  
What are you thinking  
I sometimes wonder  
What are you feeling  
  
Where do we go from here  
  
It doesnt have to be like this  
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking  
  
Why wont you talk to me  
I feel like Im drowning  
You never talk to me  
You know I cant breathe now  
  
What are you thinking  
Were going nowhere  
What are you feeling  
Were going nowhere  
  
Why wont you talk to me  
You never talk to me  
What are you thinking  
Where do we go from here  
  
It doesnt have to be like this  
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking
