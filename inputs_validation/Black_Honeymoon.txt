You may think Im dumb  
Or you may think youre sly  
But I know what youre cravin  
Ive been watchin your eyes  
Theres a girl cross the room  
Shes been glancin this way  
both of you wonderin  
when youll have your day  
  
Black honeymoon  
Ill be leavin you soon  
Next time maybe Ill be the girl  
Across the room  
black honeymoon  
  
Shes tossin her hair  
She wont meet my stare  
I turn to accuse you  
You pretend shes not there  
The pains not so bad  
cause Ive played through this game  
The players are different  
But the moves theyre the same  
Now shes gone  
And youre smilin back  
but my bloods turned to ice ice ice ice  
Now I dont feel undone  
And I dont feel afraid  
theres nothing quite so cold  
As the heart youve betrayed
