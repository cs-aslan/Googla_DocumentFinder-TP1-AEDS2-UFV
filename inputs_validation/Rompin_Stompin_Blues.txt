His letter came this morning  
COD  
Says hes found somebody  
Who reminds him of me  
He says he needs some space  
  
That might be the case  
Wasnt even man enough  
To tell me to my face  
I got the rompin stompin  
Bad news blues  
  
He stole my money  
He stole my time  
When he stole my heart  
Honey he really crossed that line  
  
A major felony  
Send out an APB  
Go tell that thief of hearts  
To bring it on back to me  
  
I got the rompin stompin  
Bad news blues  
  
Well come tonight  
Im steppin out  
Gonna sing and dance  
Gonna shake and shout  
  
Forget about ol whats his name  
You know two can play this game  
Whatever it takes to lose  
These rompin stompin  
Bad news blues  
  
Well men are full of trouble  
Girl that aint nothin new  
We aint found nothin better  
And until the day we do  
  
Sister friend be wise  
Just realize  
Stay away from the ones  
Wholl do you wrong and tell you lies  
  
Theyll give you the rompin stompin  
Bad news blues  
  
Thats right  
Theyll give you the rompin stompin  
Bad news blues
