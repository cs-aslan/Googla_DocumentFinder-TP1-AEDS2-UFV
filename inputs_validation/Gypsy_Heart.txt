You win again you gypsy heart  
I count the days that were apart  
I sleep alone when youre away  
No sense in saying I wish youd stay  
Its all the same you never change  
You come and go just like the rain  
I pray each day that you are gone  
This time it wont be so long  
Your gypsy heart will never find  
Any arms as warm as mine  
And gypsy when we meet again  
Ill play my part and wrap you up inside my arms  
Oh you gypsy heart  
Your gypsy heart can always call  
When your backs against the wall  
And darling then Ill just pretend right from the start  
You never left me on my own  
Oh you gypsy heart  
I pray each day that you are gone  
This time oh it wont be so long  
Your gypsy heart will never find  
Any arms as warm as mine  
And gypsy when we meet again  
Ill play my part and wrap you up inside my arms  
Oh you gypsy heart  
Your gypsy heart can always call  
When your backs against the wall  
And darling then Ill just pretend right from the start  
You never left me on my own  
Oh you gypsy heart  
Your gypsy heart will never find  
Any arms as warm as mine  
And gypsy when we meet again  
Ill play my part and wrap you up inside my arms  
Oh you gypsy heart  
Your gypsy heart can always call  
When your backs against the wall  
And darling then Ill just pretend right from the start  
You never left me on my own  
Oh you gypsy heart
