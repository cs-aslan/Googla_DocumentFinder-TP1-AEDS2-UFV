Now write this down  
  
Ill never be your beast of burden  
My back is broad but its a hurting  
All I want is for you to make love to me  
  
Ill never be your beast of burden  
Ive walked for miles my feet are hurting  
All I want is you to make love to me  
  
Aint I hard enough  
Aint I rough enough  
Aint I rich enough  
Im not too blind to see

So lets go home and draw the curtains  
Put some music on the radio  
Come on baby make sweet love to me Oh whats a matter with me

Oh oh my little sister  
Is a pretty pretty girl  
My little sister is a pretty pretty girl  
She love to ride and she loves to crawl  
They love to take her out behind the wall  
  
And when their done they just throw her away  
And she dont have an awful lot to say  
It hurts her so bad to come to the end  
I re I remember all the times she spent sayin Please  
  
Aint I hot enough  
Aint I rough enough  
Aint I rich enough  
Im not too blind to see oh oh

My back is broad baby but its a hurtin  
And all I want is you to make love to me
