When you fall into your seat  
You know you feel you might be dying  
As the breath rasps in and out  
Of your burning throat  
You cant control your lungs because youre so tired  
Youre half awake with one arm in your coat  
Well thank god that there is someone there to drive you  
You know you couldnt make it on your own  
He helps you through the door  
You sit down on the floor  
And youre asleep before you are alone  
  
Chorus x2  
Your life is like a schedule  
You run to meet the bills  
No ones awake to tell you  
Life kills  
  
For a while it seems exhaustion has subsided  
The day is over and the moon is high  
But your period of work is predecided  
Funny how the hours of freedom seem to fly  
Well thank god that there is someone there to drive you  
You know you couldnt make it on your own  
He helps you in the door  
You sit down as before  
Another shift to pay another loan  
  
Chorus x4
