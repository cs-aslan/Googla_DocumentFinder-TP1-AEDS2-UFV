I know a girl whos like the sea  
I watch her changing every day for me  
Oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
One day shes still the next she swells  
You can hear the universe in her sea shells  
Oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
No no line on the horizon no line  
  
I know a girl with a hole in her heart  
She said infinity is a great place to start  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
She said Time is irrelevant its not linear  
Then she put her tounge in my ear  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
No no line on the horizon no line  
No no line  
No no line on the horizon no line  
No no line  
  
The songs in your head are now on my mind  
You put me on pause  
Im trying to rewind and replay  
Every night I have the same dream  
Im hatching some plot scheming some scheme  
Oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Im traffic cop due de marais  
The sirens are wailing but its me that wants to get away  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
No no line on the horizon no line  
No no line  
No no line on the horizon no line  
No no line
