Say that you like me the way I am  
Just take some time out to understand  
It may not be much but I do all I can  
Say something nice  
  
Id never do it to one of you  
Id say something nice if it wasnt true  
Id make you feel better when youre feeling blue  
Id say something nice  
  
Say something nice only once or twice  
Say something nice only once or twice  
Say something nice  
  
I want to hear that Im beautiful  
But you wouldnt say it even if I were  
Wearing my diamonds and a coat of fur  
You wouldnt say nothin nice  
  
Tell me you think that my hairs real nice  
Dont stand around and just criticize  
Cant you understand that when a person tries  
You say something nice  
  
And its oh so hard oh so hard  
To listen to the words that you say  
Oh say something nice just once or twice  
It wouldnt hurt dont you see  
  
I want to hear something nice say something nice  
Say something nice just once or twice  
It dont hurt you at all say something nice  
  
Say something nice baby only once or twice  
Say something nice  
Say something nice baby only once or twice  
Say something nice  
  
Hey dont you hear me hey dont you hear me  
Hey dont you hear me hey dont you hear me  
  
Say something nice  
Say something nice  
And its oh so hard and its oh so hard  
And Im dying to hear what Ive never heard fade out
