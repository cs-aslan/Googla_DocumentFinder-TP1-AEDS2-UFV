If dust could only talk  
What would we hear it say  
Before its brushed aside  
Just as its swept away  
  
Its just the evidence  
Its of no consequence  
Its only flesh and bone  
Why dont you leave it alone  
  
If dust could only speak  
Caught in a falling beam  
If dust could only cry  
If dust could only scream  
For its the single witness that might testify  
Could I spit out the truth  
Or would you rather just swallow a lie  
  
But dust is always caught behind a coat of paint  
Beneath the marble fingernails of kings and saints  
And in the theater curtain where they hang a drape  
Or in the ticket pocket where your hands escape  
  
Before they start to wander  
Or they start to shrink  
You rub your eye a little and appear to blink  
And then she caught you staring  
She knows just what youre thinking  
What got into you was not a ghost as such  
It was just dust  
  
Here comes the juggernaut  
Here come the poisoners  
They choke the life and land  
And rob the joy from us  
Why do they taste of sugar  
Oh when theyre made of money  
Here comes the lamb of God  
And the butchers boy Sonny  
  
Well I believe we just  
Become a speck of dust
