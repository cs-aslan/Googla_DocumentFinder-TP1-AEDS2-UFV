Theres a place in the world for the angry young man  
With his working class ties and his radical plans  
He refuses to bend he refuses to crawl  
And hes always at home with his back to the wall  
Hes proud of the scars and the battles hes lost  
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross  
And he likes to be known as the angry young man  
  
Give a moment or two to the angry young man  
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand  
Hes been stabbed in the back hes been misunderstood  
Its a comfort to know his intentions are good  
He sits in a room with a lock on the door  
With his maps and his medals laid out of the floor  
And he likes to be known as the angry young man  
  
I believe Ive passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage  
Ive found that just surviving was a noble fight  
I once believed in causes too had my pointless point of view  
Life went on no matter who was wrong or right  
  
And theres always a place for the angry young man  
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand  
Hes never been able to learn from mistakes  
He cant understand why his heart always breaks  
Hes honest and pure and has courage as well  
Hes fair and hes true and hes boring as hell  
And hell go to his grave as an angry old man  
  
Theres a place in the world for the angry young man  
With his working class ties and his radical plans  
He refuses to bend he refuses to crawl  
And hes always at home with his back to the wall  
Hes proud of the scars and the battles hes lost  
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross  
And he likes to be known as the angry young man
