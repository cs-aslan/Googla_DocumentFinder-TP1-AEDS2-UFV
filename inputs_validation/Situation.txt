Blue I dress for every situation  
Moving through the doorway of the nation  
Pick me up and shake me down  
Baby I cant do without  
  
Move out  
Dont mess around  
Move out  
You bring me down  
  
Move out  
Forget about dont make a sound  
Just move out  
I remember only for an hour  
  
Moving right through me can you feel the power  
I dont know whats going on  
Its getting me but it wont be long  
Move out  
  
Dont mess around  
Move out  
You bring me down  
Move out  
  
Forget about dont make a sound  
Just move out  
Move out  
Dont mess around  
  
Move out  
You bring me down  
Move out  
Forget about dont make a sound  
  
Just move out  
Move out  
Dont mess around  
Move out  
  
You bring me down  
Move out  
Forget about dont make a sound  
Just move out  
  
Now hes in control he is your lover  
Nation stands against him hes your brother  
Been a long time been a long time  
Now Ive got to give somehow  
  
Move out  
Dont mess around  
Move out  
You bring me down  
  
Move out  
Forget about dont make a sound  
Just move out  
Well Well Well
