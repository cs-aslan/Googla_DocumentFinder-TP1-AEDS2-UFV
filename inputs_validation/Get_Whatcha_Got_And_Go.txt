A pretty boy Charlies the name that youve been a given  
And you act like the whole wide world all you were livin  
You tell me you can get any girl you know  
You say it got what it takes to me youre just a heartache  
So get whatcha got and go  
You think youre the greatest thing in this whole town  
Oh number one but everyone no one can put you down  
Every night you go downtown where the gogos go  
Oh well you think youre so hot and you tell me youre not  
So get whatcha got and go  
 steel   
You better watch that sneaky smile right off of your face  
For I just might to knock it off and put it in your place  
Just like the wild wild wind all you do is blow  
Just say Im holdin you back but baby Ill have to pack  
So get whatcha got and go  
You think youre the greatest thing
