Making my way downtown walking fast  
Faces pass and Im home bound  
Staring blankly ahead just making my way  
Making a way through the crowd  
  
And I need you  
And I miss you  
And now I wonder  
  
If I could fall into the sky  
Do you think time would pass me by   
Cause you know Id walk a thousand miles  
If I could just see you  
Tonight  
  
Its always times like these when I think of you  
And I wonder if you ever think of me  
Cause everythings so wrong and I dont belong  
Living in your precious memorys  
  
Cause I need you  
And I miss you  
And now I wonder  
  
If I could fall into the sky  
Do you think time would pass me by oh  
Cause you know Id walk a thousand miles  
If I could just see you  
Tonight  
  
And I  I  
Dont want to let you know  
I  I  
Drown in your memory  
I  I  
Dont want to let this go  
I I dont  
  
Making my way downtown walking fast  
Faces pass and Im home bound  
Staring blankly ahead just making my way  
Making a way through the crowd  
And I still need you  
And I still miss you  
And now I wonder  
  
If I could fall into the sky  
Do you think time would pass us by  
Cause you know Id walk a thousand miles  
If I could just see you  
  
If I could fall into the sky  
Do you think time would pass me by  
Oh cause you know Id walk a thousand miles  
If I could just see you  
If I could just hold you  
Tonight
