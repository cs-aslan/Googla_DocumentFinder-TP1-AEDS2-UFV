Well if youre feelin low take it slow  
  
Baby get your head screwed on  
I know hes left but dont be depressed  
Baby let your favorite daddy see you through  
  
Oh baby youll be out of your mind  
Baby youll be out of your mind  
Baby youll be out of your mind  
  
You know youre nice youre sugar and spice  
And I know what youre going through  
And if youre hot HOT and even if youre not  
Baby let your favorite daddy see you through  
  
Oh baby youll be out of your mind  
Baby youll be out of your mind  
Baby youll be out of your mind  
  
You were so neat ever so sweet  
And overnight youve seemed to change  
Since you kissed your psychiatrist  
Baby youve never been the same  
  
Well if youre feelin low take it slow  
Baby get your head screwed on  
I know hes left but dont be depressed  
Baby let your favorite daddy see you through  
  
Oh baby youll be out of your mind  
Baby youll be out of your mind  
Baby youll be out of your mind
