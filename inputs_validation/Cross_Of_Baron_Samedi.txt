Tuesday evening  
  
One single hour is like a working day  
Father Malone is getting tired  
Darknesshas come again  
The Demons seem to be resting  
Sarah is looking just like Hell  
There aint much left of her to save now  
  
Meanwhile in Salems quarters  
Theres shadow that moves  
Into a room full of secrets of life  
Into a room only few have survived  
  
There is a cross upon the wall  
The cross of Baron Samedi  
The shadow is taking the cross away  
The shadow is Lula the girl that no one ever sees  
  
I see her shadow with that cross mine  
I see her shadow slipping into the night  
The cross of Baron Samedi will set us free  
The cross of Baron Samedi just wait and see  
  
The cross of Baron Samedi is full of nails  
The cross of Baron Samedi could split your head  
Take it to Sarah Take it to Sarah Sarah  
  
Darknessshes up again  
Sarah is standing in front of Father Malone  
Sleepingthe Fathers on a chair  
Sarah is saying Father Im about to sin  
  
Then one to the Fathers head  
The cross is coming down so hard  
Screaming bleeding Malone goes down  
Again andagain andhis blood is all around  
  
Stop it Sarah stop  
I dont know why but Sarah dropped the cross  
Two hours later everyone was here  
Police and ambulance wiping up the tears  
  
Samedi Samedi Samedi
