Refrain  
Ding dong Merrily on high  
In heavn the bells are ringing  
Ding dong Verily the sky  
Is rivn with angel singing  
Gloria Hosanna in excelsis  
  
Een so here below below  
Let steeple bells be swungen  
And Io io io  
By priest and people sungen  
  
Refrain  
  
Pray you dutifully prime  
Your matin chime you ringers  
May you beautifully rhyme  
Your eve time song you singers
