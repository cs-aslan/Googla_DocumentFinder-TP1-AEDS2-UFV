Paper roses paper roses  
 steel   
I realize the way your eyes deceived me with tender looks that I mistook for
love  
So take away the flowers that you gave me and send the kind that you remind me
of  
Paper roses paper roses oh how real those roses seem to be  
But theyre only imitation like your imitation love for me  
 steel   
I thought that you would be a perfect lover  
You seemed so full of sweetness at the start  
But like the big red rose thats made of paper  
Ah there isnt any sweetness in your heart  
Paper roses paper roses  
Like your imitation love for me
