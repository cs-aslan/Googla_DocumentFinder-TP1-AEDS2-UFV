I want a hippopotamus for Christmas  
Only a hippopotamus will do  
Dont want a doll no dinky tinker Toy  
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy  
  
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas  
I dont think Santa Claus will mind do you  
He wont have to use our dirty chimney flue  
Just bring him through the front door thats the easy thing to do  
  
I can see me now on Christmas morning creeping down the stairs  
Oh what joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes  
To see my hippo hero standing there  
  
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas  
Only a hippopotamus will do  
No crocodiles no rhinoceroses  
I only like hippopotamuses  
And hippopotamuses like me too  
  
Mom says the hippo would eat me up but then  
Teacher says a hippo is a vegeterian  
  
Theres lots of room for him in our twocar garage  
Id feed him there and wash him there and give him his massage  
I can see me now on Christmas morning creeping down the stairs  
Oh what joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes  
To see a hippo hero standing there  
  
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas  
Only a hippopotamus will do  
No crocodiles or rhinoceroseses  
I only like hippopotamuseses  
And hippopotamuses like me too They like me too
