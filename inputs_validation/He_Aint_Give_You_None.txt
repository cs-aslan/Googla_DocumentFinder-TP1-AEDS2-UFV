Little gal little girl Lord you know its true  
Little gal little girl Lord you know its true  
I dont want to stop rockin and rollin with you  
  
Are you gonna let me stand alone   
Are you gonna let me stand alone   
Caught you this morning before your Daddy came home  
  
And I done more for you than your Daddy has ever done  
I done more for you than your Daddy has ever done  
Gave you my jelly roll and he aint give you none  
Lets go Eric  
  
Dont you ever go down down on Curzon Street its bad  
Dont you ever go down down on Curzon Street  
Thats where old John flogs his daily meat  
  
Maybe sometime he say leave the little boy and the girl behind  
I got messed up round somewhere called Notting Hill Gate  
I lived there for a while but I moved out and when I moved out I was in such
a state  
Ive never gone back there  
  
But I Im sure I done more for you than your Daddy has ever done baby  
Made you learn your syllables  
Done more for you than your Daddy has ever done all right ha ha  
Gave you my jelly roll and he aint give you none  
Stay on the move  
  
In the back street in the back street I gave you my jelly roll  
Ah I gave it to you ha ha  
Remember when we were down in the the alley  
And I said the lights were out baby this is it you know ha ha ha  
All right we got a good thing going  
You can leave now if you dont like whats happening  
You know we got aa few things going you know ha ha  
Its a drag ha ha huh thats what you call it
