Chorus  
Bring all the family  
Take all the family  
Bring all the family  
See all the family  
  
Bring all the family out to the holiday  
While were all still around  
Show you what the cats been doing and how he gets around  
You cant wake him hes not sleeping  
He never comes down  
Bring all the family out to the holiday  
While were all still in town  
Show you what the cats been doing and how he gets around  
Lady skin up lady skin up  
Now that we live together we both get fucked up  
  
Chorus  
  
Its only grandbag that died  
He really couldnt see what youre doing  
And all his family were white  
  
Lady skin up lady roll up  
Now that we live together we both get good luck  
  
Chorus
