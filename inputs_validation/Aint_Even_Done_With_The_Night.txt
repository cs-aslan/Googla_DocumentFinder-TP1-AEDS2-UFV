Well our hearts beat like thunder  
I dont know why they dont explode  
You got your hands in my back pockets  
And Sam Cookes singin on the radio  
You say that Im the boy who can make it all come true  
Well Im tellin ya that I dont know if I know what to do  
  
You say thats all right hold tight  
Well I dont even know if Im doin this right  
Well all right hold tight  
We can stay out all day or we can run around all night  
Well all night all night  
Well its time to go home  
And I aint even done with the night  
  
Well I dont know no good comeons  
And I dont know no cool lines  
I feel the heat of your frustration  
I know its burnin you up deep down inside  
You say that Im the boy who can make it all come true  
Well Im tellin ya that I dont know if I know what to do  
  
You say thats all right hold tight  
Well I dont even know if Im doin this right  
Well all right hold tight  
We can stay out all day or we can run around all night  
Well all night all night  
Well its time to go home  
And I aint even done with the night
