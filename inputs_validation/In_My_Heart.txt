I dont know why  
We still live together  
Were so far apart  
So much of the time  
I dont know why  
This beautiful weather  
Is breaking my spirit  
And tearing my mind all apart  
  
Are you so lonely  
Are you so sad  
Have you lost your purpose  
The faith that you had  
If life is a question  
I dont understand  
If time is the reason  
Then nobody can  
  
In my heart it is just an illusion  
Its not even real  
Much more than you think  
Its much more than you feel  
  
My ears are still ringing  
Theres nothing to say  
Why look to the ocean  
To wash me away  
There goes my best friend  
There goes my last dime  
If love is the answer  
Im wasting my time  
  
In my heart it is just an illusion  
Its not even real  
Much more than you think  
Its much more than you feel  
Do you feel  
Is this real  
How I feel  
In my heart
