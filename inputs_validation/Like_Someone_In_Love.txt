Lately  
I find myself out gazin at stars  
Hearing guitars  
Like someone in love  
  
Sometimes  
The things I do astound me  
Mostly  
Whenever youre around me  
  
Lately  
I seem to walk as though I had wings  
Bump into things  
Like someone in love  
  
Each time I look at you  
Im limp as a glove  
An feelin like someone in love  
  
I bump into things  
Like someone in love  
  
Each time I look at you  
Im limp as a glove  
An feelin like someone in love
