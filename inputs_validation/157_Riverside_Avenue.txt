We flew into town on Sunday had to find a place by Monday  
Tried Bridgeport and Westport til we found a place that we thought would do  
157 Riverside Avenue  
  
Saugatuck Rivers flowin Mother natures colors were showin  
So cold so rainy we couldnt help feelin blue  
Not enough time too many things to do  
  
We met a young girl on Main street wanted to just pass her by  
She was homely so lonely She said Can I make love to you  
We shouted 157 Riverside Avenue  
  
Its over Miss Lena were leaving Such a pleasant stay I must say  
So nice so easy we hate to say goodbye to you  
At 157 Riverside Avenue
