Love makes me treat you the way that I do  
Baby aint I good to you  
Nothing in this world too good for a girl so good and true  
Whoa baby aint I good to you  
I bought you a fur coat for Christmas  
And a diamond ring yes I did  
And a big Cadillac car and everything  
What makes me treat you the way that I do  
It must be love baby  
Thats why Im so good to you  
I bought you a fur coat for Christmas  
And a diamond ring  
And a great big Eldorado and everything  
It must be love that makes me treat you  
The way that I do gee  
Baby aint I good to you
