The stars are gonna twinkle and shine  
This evening about a quarter to nine  
My loving arms are gonna tenderly twine twee twee twine  
Around you around a quarter to nine  
I know I wont be late cause at half past eight  
Im gonna hurry there  
Ill be waiting where the lane begins  
Waiting for you on needles and pins  
And then the world is gonna be mine oh all mine  
This evening about a quarter to nine  
Then the world is gonna be mine  
This evening about a quarter to nine
