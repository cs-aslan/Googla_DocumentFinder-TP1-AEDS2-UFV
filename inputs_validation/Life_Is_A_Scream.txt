She said to me oh I dont know what you mean  
All Im trying to do is  
Trying to make your scene  
I said to her no way baby life aint what it seem  
  
Well dont you know baby that life is a scream  
She came up to me in her high fashion and sheen  
Well dont you know that she was trying to come clean  
I said to her no way baby life aint what it seem  
  
Well dont you know baby that lifes a scream  
She said to me oh I love it when youre mean  
Dont you know its boring when its quiet and serene  
I said to her no way baby life aint what it seem  
  
Got to get it through your head that life is a scream
