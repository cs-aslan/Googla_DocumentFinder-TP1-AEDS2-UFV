So run here baby put your little hands in mine  
Ive got something to tell you I know youre gonna change your mind  
When things go wrong so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
  
I want you baby just to understand  
I dont want to be your boss babe I just want to be your man  
When things go wrong so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
  
Now when you go home you dont have to get along  
Come back to me babe where I live thats where you belong  
When things go wrong so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
  
I love you baby an you know that its true  
I wouldnt mistreat you baby nothin in this world is like you  
When things go wrong so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
Yes when things go wrong so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
  
So run here baby put your little hand in mine  
I got something to tell you baby I know that will change your mind  
When things go wrong so wrong with you  
Dont you know it dont you know it hurts me too
