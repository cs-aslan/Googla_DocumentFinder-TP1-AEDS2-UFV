I aint got nobody since she left me  
And I dont know why but Im startin to cry  
I aint got nobody since she left me  
And I cant figure out how Im gonna get by  
I aint got nobody since she left me  
I dont know why I been down all season  
I aint got nobody since she left me  
cause there aint no reason for the girl to be leavin me  
  
Chorus  
I dont know how Ill ever get by without you  
Nobody no  nobody  
Im startin to realize my fate  
Nobody no  nobody  
Im ready to make up and give another try to live with you  
Nobody no  nobody  
I hope for our love and us its not too late  too late  
Nobody nobody  
  
I aint got nobody since she left me  
Oh and I dont really think that shell ever come back  
I aint got nobody since she left me  
If she dont come back Ill have a love attack  
I aint got nobody since she left me  
And my tears are like rain fallin down on my face  
I aint got nobody since she left me  
cause I know shes the girl that Ill never replace  
  
Chorus
