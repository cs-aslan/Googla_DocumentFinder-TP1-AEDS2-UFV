Sweet dreams are made of these  
Who am I to disagree  
Traveled the world and the seven seas  
Everybodys looking for something  
  
Some of them want to use you  
Some of them want to get used by you  
Some of them want to abuse you  
Some of them want to be abused

Everybodys looking for something  
  
Some of them want to use you  
Some of them want to get used by you  
Some of them want to abuse you  
Some of them want to be abused  
  
I wanna use you and abuse you  
I wanna know whats inside you  
  
Keep your head up moving on  
Hold your head up moving on  
Keep your head up moving on  
Hold your head up moving on  
Keep your head up moving on  
Moving on
