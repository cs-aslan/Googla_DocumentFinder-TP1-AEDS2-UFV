Waking up this morning  
Thinking this cant be real  
They say there is nothing love cant heal  
Why dont you come on down  
So you can feel what I feel  
  
Sitting all alone in this place  
Even though were here face to face  
There is nothing gone  
But theres something wrong  
  
Cant you see  
That Im stuck here underneath  
And you make it hard to breathe  
Take a look around and tell me what you see  
Youll find me underneath  
  
I know what to say  
But dont know where to begin  
I fear Im losing you beneath my skin  
Is there resolution for this pain that Im in  
  
Sitting all alone in this place  
Even though were here face to face  
There is nothing gone  
But theres something wrong  
  
Cant you see  
That Im stuck here underneath  
And you make it hard to breathe  
Take a look around and tell me what you see  
Youll find me underneath  
Cause youll find me whoa underneath  
  
If only you could feel what I dream  
Maybe you could hear what I mean  
There is nothing gone  
  
But theres something missing  
Cant you see  
That Im stuck here underneath  
And you make it hard to breathe  
Take a look around and tell me what you see  
  
Youll find me underneath  
Youll find me underneath  
Underneath underneath
