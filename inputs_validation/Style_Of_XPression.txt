Noncommercial lyrics run like Hershel  
Walkin fast cause Im a smooth talker  
Appeal the feel but dont praise and kneel  
Just heal  
  
And always look for the seal thats real  
Top Dog lookin up to say what is this  
Kid Rock serious and I mean business  
Ascending up and up I keep boosting  
  
Makin hit records like Whitney Houston  
With a mind of violence right I might  
Blow the show teachers speakin yo I cut MPs  
To release to each and be friends of  
Every single individual  
  
Everybody all over the world its time for understandin  
Come together  
  
Jumbo yo thats how Im movin  
Im the new kid in heres what Im givin  
A jammed slammin command that take authority  
Cause too many MCs appear apsrt of me  
  
Name and they claim me yo that theyre winnin  
A lotta just came in sound the same in  
Thinkin they swift and can get with these young men  
But I keep the crowd swingin like Tarzan  
  
Cause Im a wise man here to teach and speak  
And if you step out of line your up shits creek  
So come with it Kid Rocks gonna get it  
His style aint dope its a throat and I slit it  
  
Im raw like cowhide smooth like a plane ride  
No half steppin I always take a full stride  
Who came played and they say Im concrete made  
I used to come correct in the projects  
  
New Port Oxford deep in the basement  
House and parties like real estate agent  
So on so strong and everyone got along  
Knowledge is power and theres a point to this song  
  
Everybody all over the world its time for understandin  
Come together  
Everybody all over the world its time for understandin  
Come together  
  
Now as I said my prayers through the years I shed a few tears  
Cause its unjust when I see my peers get shot  
And dropped and forgot now thats hot  
Too many cant score as victims of a drug war  
  
Cocaines ran and weapons are shipped out  
The press finds out then the public is tripped out  
New tax the acts and half the drug industry  
Uncle Sam is my man are you kiddin me  
  
Me in the Whitehouse now thats fucked up  
For one to get over one must get stuck up  
One will roll up another will smoke up  
Two more thrown in jail who picks the toll up  
  
Tell her to beware if shes gonna stand there  
Eyes bugged out and hands in the air  
Cause there comes an onlooker lookin for a hooker  
And act like the doors overlooked her and took her  
  
For a place to hide and when he got his ride  
He let the nice slide and the girl she died  
Her family cried over this homicide  
And why they pondered why she wandered  
  
Left her own spot her home her mom and pop  
All to smoke a little cooked up rock  
So on and so strong she couldnt get along  
Knowledge is power and theres a point to this song  
  
Everybody all over the world its time for understandin  
Come together  
Everybody all over the world its time for understandin  
Come together  
  
From the outskirts with a mind like Albert Einstein  
Maybe Im ahead of my time  
Imaginate create spectate elevate from the states  
Surrounded by the Great Lakes  
  
I was once out cold at 15 years old  
Rolled and sold you me and Bo  
Sittin in Jackson infested with rats  
With a silver gat tucked deep in my slacks  
  
I was a young bad mother in my own eyes  
But now I realize it wasnt too wise  
So now I teach Ill reach to each  
And every single individual  
  
Everybody all over the world its time for understandin  
Come together  
Come together  
Come together  
Come come come come together
