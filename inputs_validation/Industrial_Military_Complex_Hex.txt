Feel like Im livin under some kind of hex  
Livin in here in this industrial military complex  
Doesnt really help when I read Time magazine  
Cause they only distort the scene  
The sky is so hazy I cant even see the sun  
Livin here is like livin under a gun  
I really do wonder bout the United Nations  
Why dont they face the situations  
Im a troubadour  
Lookin for a dream  
Im a troubadour  
Lookin for some dream  
Lord Im so tired of payin all of these dues  
From Sunday to Sunday all I hear is bad news  
Tired of the war and those industrial fools  
Got to make it better cause Ive got nothin to lose  
Aint too clear to pay my income taxes  
Specially when I know it goes to kill the masses  
Love to hear the President make it perfectly clear  
How the donkeys and the elephants are police up here  
Im a troubadour  
Lookin for a dream  
Im a troubadour  
Lookin for some dream  
Lord Im so tired of payin all of these dues  
From Sunday to Sunday all I hear is bad news  
Tired of the war and those industrial fools  
Ive got to make it better cause Ive got nothin lose  
Wont somebody help me cause Ive gotten in my shoes  
Those industrial military complex blues
