The holidays are over youve gained twenty pounds  
The cats choking on tinsel pine needles stalk the ground  
There are no cards in the mailbox just a stack of bills  
Yes the holidays are over and you are feeling ill  
Have a happy Christmas hangover  
Its the most miserable time of the year  
The eggnogs made you fat the party is over  
Cept for your wacky Uncle who is still drinking your beer  
Turkeys great on Christmas bur after a whole month  
Of turkey pie stew and pie you start to dread lunch  
Breakfast is much scarier cause all there is to eat  
Is fourteen Christmas cakes and a bag of cranberries  
Have a happy Christmas hangover  
Its the most miserable time of the year  
Your uncles in the bathroom and grannys on the sofa  
And you start to wish that theyd just disappear  
You ate too many liquorfilled chocolates  
Got no money left in your pockets  
But at least you got lots of  
Ugly sweaters and bow ties and socks  
And twentytwo calenders  
Youre skin is pale and pasty your energy is spent  
Along with all the money you need to pay the rent  
The children are all crying cause theyve broken all their toys  
Is this misery worth one day of joy  
Have a happy Christmas hangover  
Its the most miserable time of the year  
Your uncle has passed out on granny on the sofa  
And you start to wish that you could disappear  
And you start to wish that you cold disappear
