By David Allan Coe  
  
Why did you come here what do you need  
Dont look at me like you want me to plead  
My friends are dying to make rock and roll stand  
While weve been living in A country rock band  
Weve got to slow down  come down  
We got to get off of this merryGoRound  
  
Where did you go marilyn monroe  
If you see james dean tell him I said hello  
Janis sang here jimmy did too  
Theyre saving A place there for me and you  
Theres gonna be A rock and roll holiday  
Weve got to get there in time to play  
  
Tune up the fiddle rosin the bow  
We could be the only country band on A rock and roll show  
Weve got to get up no time to hit up  
Theres another crowd waiting for the music to play  
  
Slow down  come down  
Dont take A ride on deaths merryGoRound
