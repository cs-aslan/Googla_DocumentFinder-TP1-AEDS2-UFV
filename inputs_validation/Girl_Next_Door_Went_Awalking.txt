The girl next door went awalking  
She found the boy she likes  
She wanted to get married  
Settle down for life  
  
The girl next door went awalking  
She knew it wasnt right  
She came home at half past ten  
Late every night  
  
The girl next door went awalking  
She found the boy she likes  
She wanted to get married  
Settle down for life  
  
She didnt know love was so grand  
She never took love second hand  
But to my surprise  
She thought that love was paradise
