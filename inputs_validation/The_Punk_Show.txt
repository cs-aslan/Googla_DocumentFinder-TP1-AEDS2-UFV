Hanging out behind the club on the weekends  
Acting stupid getting drunk with my best friends  
I couldnt wait for the summer and the Warped Tour  
I remember that its the first time that I saw her there  
  
Shes getting kicked out of school cause shes failing  
Im kinda nervous cause I think all her friends hate me  
Shes the one shell always be there  
She took my hand and I made it I swear  
  
Chorus  
  
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show  
She said what and I told her that I didnt know  
Shes so cool better sneak me through her window  
Everythings better when shes around  
I Cant wait until her parents go out of town  
Cause I fell in love with the girl at the rock show  
  
When we said we were gonna move to Las Vegas  
I remember the look her mother gave us  
17 without a purpose or direction  
We dont owe anyone a fuckin explanation  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Black and white picture of her on my wall  
I waited for her call she always kept me waiting  
And if I ever got another chance Id still ask her to dance  
Because she kept me waiting  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
With the girl at the rock show  
With the girl at the rock show  
Ill never forget tonight  
With the girl at the punk show
