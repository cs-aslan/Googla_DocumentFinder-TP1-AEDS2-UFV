I am the king of nothing  
The emperor of emptiness  
I dont have a castle  
And I dont wear a crown  
  
I recall as a small child  
The dreams that I once had  
Yes I recall as a small boy  
Those dreams which drove me mad  
  
Cause I once found myself a Kingdom  
It was not too far away  
I once found myself a Kingdom  
But somehow I let it slip away  
  
So I am the king of nothing  
The emperor of emptiness  
And I dont have a castle  
And I dont have a crown  
  
And I recall as a small child  
Those dreams I once had  
I recall as a small boy  
Those dreams which drove me mad  
  
I once found myself a Kingdom  
And I thought that it was here to stay  
Yes I once found myself a Kingdom  
But somehow I let it slip away  
  
So I am the king of nothing  
The emperor of emptiness  
And I dont have a castle  
And I dont wear a crown
