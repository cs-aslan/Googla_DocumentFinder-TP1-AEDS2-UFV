Were off on the road to Morocco  
This camel is tough on the spine hit me with a bandaid Dad  
Where theyre going why were going how can we be sure  
Ill lay you eight to five that well meet Dorothy Lamour  
Yeah get in line  
  
Off on the road to Morocco  
Hang on till the end of the line I like your jockey Quiet  
I hear this countrys where they do the dance of the seven veils  
Wed tell you more uhah but we would have the censor on our tails  
Good boy  
  
We certainly do get around  
Like Websters Dictionary were Morocco bound  
  
Were off on the road to Morocco  
Well look out well clear the way cause here we come  
Stand by for a concussion  
The men eat fire sleep on nails and saw their wives in half  
It seems to me there should be easier ways to get a laugh  
Shall I slip on my big shoes  
  
Off on the road to Morocco  
Hooray Well blow a horn everybody duck  
Yeah Its a green light come on boys  
  
We may run into villains but were not afraid to roam  
Because we read the story and we end up safe at home yeah  
Certainly do get around  
Like Websters Dictionary were Morocco bound  
  
We certainly do get around  
Like a complete set of Shakespeare that you get  
In the corner drugstore for a dollar ninetyeight  
Were Morocco bound  
  
Or like a volume of Omar Khayyam that you buy in the  
Department store at Christmas time for your cousin Julia  
Were Morocco bound  
We could be arrested
