I remember when my teacher said  
How you want to make your life  
I said I can play guitar  
And it will be alright listen  
  
When I came out of school  
They said Which way you want to go  
But there was no way strong enough  
Compared with rock n roll  
To get the same thrill  
  
Anyhow Ive found a job  
They tried to break me with their rules  
But they had no chance at all  
Cause I knew what to do  
To get the same thrill like rock n roll  
  
I had a feeling they couldnt buy  
Still got that feeling they still cant buy  
They still cant buy  
They still cant buy  
  
Tell me the alternative  
To what Im doing but I guess  
Theres no other way of life  
Which is strong like this  
To get the same thrill like rock n roll
