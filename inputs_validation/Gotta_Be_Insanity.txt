Uhh gotta get ituhhhhmmmget it get it  
  
Baby  
  
Stab thru the neighborhood these spinin  
Weez winin scrap with the John Lennon  
Head rests TVs in em  
Best in the nation on this playstation  
The Don Daata gotta get you hotter  
Been a buck naked nigga smokin water  
On a friday the get high day  
Blowin at a hot date findin Shade  
Black and bicantay with ass everwhere how you do that there  
A sight to behold break the mold  
Just tryin to get some before the world explode  
I see you tryin to get caught  
Well shake what your mama gave ya plus what you bought  
We fuck and we fought we laugh and we cry  
Told the truth and we lie  
  
You be good to me ill be good to you  
Anything you want anything you do  
I got my eyes on you and im in to you  
Give it all I got and to keep it hot  
  
Now what a freak like you doin with a fool like me  
Explain it to your family  
Its got to be insanity because I like what youre doing to me  
You know you aint right standin at the light  
Think its chocolate with that shit too tight  
And if I fuck around and get you in the car with me  
Motherfuckers would think I had a star with me  
Now see the haterism increase  
They hate when you got a dime piece  
And I got one shotgun and I might catch a hot one  
When im lookin for love and niggas got none uhh  
If you let me handcuff your wrist  
Bonnie and Clyde aint got shit on this  
Cuz Bonnie and Clyde had to take a risk  
But most of my money see its all legit baby  
Its all about your state of mind  
Now what would you do if I handed you a tech nine  
Are you feelin me  
Would you stay down like Hillary  
Even if you thought about killin me  
  
You be good to me ill be good to you  
Anything you want anything you do  
I got my eyes on you and im in to you  
Give it all I got and to keep it hot  
  
Now what a freak like you doin with a fool like me  
Explain it to your family  
Its got to be insanity because I like what youre doing to me  
Are you the type of girl that would call them folks  
Have your man leave the house in chains and ropes  
Dont need the kind of girl thatll have me in court  
On lawsuits lyin about demestic abuse  
Have a bitch like Judge Judy cussin me out  
Garnish my cheques reposses my lex  
Cuz I come from a place in southern Californi  
Where hoes rake niggas for tons of alimoni  
But fuck the world dont aks me for shit  
Unless you my boo and im fuckin you  
The rest of these broads aint knowin  
That im a have you bumpin Lauryn in somethin foreign  
Come thru blow the horn  
Stick your wrists out the window  
And wave to your kinfolks  
Let em know who you with  
And to your crazy ass daddy let him know who to get  
  
You be good to me ill be good to you  
Anything you want anything you do  
I got my eyes on you and im in to you  
Give it all I got and to keep it hot  
  
Now what a freak like you doin with a fool like me  
Explain it to your family  
Its got to be insanity because I like what youre doing to me  
Now what a freak like you doin with a fool like me  
Explain it to your family  
Its got to be insanity because I like what youre doing to me  
Now what a freak like you doin with a fool like me  
Explain it to your family

Now what a freak like you doin with a fool like me  
Explain it to your family  
Its got to be insanity because I like what youre doing to me
