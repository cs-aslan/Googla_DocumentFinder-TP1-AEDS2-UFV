I really wouldnt mind it might be fun  
At any other time with any other one  
But lovers cant be friends  
And theres only one way it can end  
I would lose youI would lose you  
  
There are not many girls I can talk with  
There are not many girls I can walk with  
And I dont have many friends if any  
So stay my friend and go away my friend  
  
Im really wanting you to go away  
Everything you do the things you say  
Confuse me now and then  
And I think I love you my friend  
Go awaygo away  
  
Youre the only girl I have fun with  
Youre the only girl I can run with  
You know friendship ends where love begins  
So stay my friend and go away my friend  
  
You know friendship ends where love begins  
So stay my friend and gogo away  
Go awaygo awaygo away
