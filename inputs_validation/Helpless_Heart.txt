Im sitting here inside this strangers place  
And time is racing by  
Ive been way out here for a month or more  
Tonight Im wondering why  
You try to understand the things that I feel  
Maybe this time Ill find a way to explain it  
Cause there is a dream deep inside my head  
And it may seem like its breaking the thread  
That holds me to you  
Still you have never wanted to change me  
But darling I know though were far apart  
The signal is strong  
This helpless heart will always belong to you  
To you  
This power takes me from the place I belong  
To where only the strong get through  
Youve got keep on believing or youll lose your way  
Cause it slips right out of view  
Though there are days the light can flicker and fade  
Here in this place tonight a fire is burning  
Cause there is a dream deep inside my head  
And it may seem like its breaking the thread  
That holds me to you  
Still you have never wanted to change me  
But believe me I know though were far apart  
The signal is strong  
This helpless heart will always belong to you  
This helpless heart will always belong to you  
Will always belong to you  
To you  
Only to you  
To you
