When the snow turns black  
Ill be back  Ill be here  
Between the blinking of an eye  
Welcome back  Cavalier  
When the screams attack  
Before the newborn starts to cry  
Flaming star or the call of the wild  
And its all in the eyes of a child  
The whispers in the breeze  
Black Xmas  Devils Eve  
Black Xmas  Devils wine  
The river bleeds in time  
Thats the place  In a dream  
Where the red clouds chase  
Across the suns hot blazing sky  
Where he hides his face  
In disgrace  For his queen  
He must choose the way she dies  
And they say when his eyes turn to green  
Hell awake living sin never seen  
Thats the clue  To believe  
Watches over you  
Watch his eyes look through  
An instant and youre hypnotised  
False or true  To deceive  
You take his place youre crucified  
Black Xmas  Devils Eve  
The whispers in the breeze  
The river bleeds in time  
Black Xmas  Devils wine  
Black XmasBlack Xmas  Devils wine
