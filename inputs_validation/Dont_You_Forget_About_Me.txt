They say love is just a game  
They say time can heal the pain  
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose  
And I guess Im just a fool  
I keep holding on to you  
  
I told you once you were the one  
You know that I die for you  
Oh though it hurts to see you go  
Oh this time you should know  
I wont try to stop you  
  
Dont you forget about me baby  
Dont you forget about me now  
Some day youll turn around and ask me why did I let you go  
  
So you try to fake a smile  
You dont wanna break my heart  
I can see that youre afraid  
But baby its to late  
Cause Im already dying  
  
Dont you forget about me baby  
Dont you forget about me now  
Some day youll turn around and ask me why did I let you go  
  
Dont you forget about me baby  
Dont you forget about me now  
Some day youll turn around and ask me why did I let you go  
  
Why did I let you  
  
Dont you forget about me baby  
Dont you forget about me now  
Some day youll turn around and ask me why did I let you go  
  
Why did I let you go  
  
Wherever I go  
I wont forget about you  
Oh no no no  
Wherever you go  
Dont you forget about me
