Background Uhhhhhyeeaaah  
Jocs Dad Everything that glitters aint gold baby  
Yung Joc I hear ya Daddy  
  
Chorus x 2  
Im choppin 24s  
Blowin good dro  
Yeah I got plenty Hoes  
Life aint picture perfect  
Yeah ya see the ice  
And I dress nice  
Make em look twice  
Life aint picture perfect  
  
Yeah Im blowin on some good lime  
Skatin on two 85s  
Wouldnt believe half the shit thats skatin through a niggas mind  
745 complimented with leather and wood  
Chickens on my dick cause a nigga fresh and smellin good  
Jack boys plottin on my stacks on deck  
Wanna put the Tec to my chest for the ice on my neck  
Oh yeah its easy to attain it all  
Harder to maintain it all  
If you want a perfect picture only god can paint it dog  
Niggas in these videos with multiplatinum projects  
Cant even get credit cards  
And they Momma stay in projects  
How is that Scratch my head  
Somethin dont seem right  
Ya teeth full of ice  
So when ya smile I seen lights  
Seems like Im hatin Im just statin the facts  
I aint feelin to smile in ya face and put a blade in your back  
Now try not to get caught up on the way shit looks  
Cause everything aint picture perfect just listen to the hook  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Yeah Im off in magic city  
Trickin them ass and titties  
Bitches blowin me kisses makin me wanna hit it  
I must admit got a good chick and she been holdin me down  
But I aint fuckin around cause there is too much shit goin around  
Like the rims on my pickup  
Scared to get my dick sucked  
Nigga run into the clinic even from a hiccup  
Pick up the pieces from the fuckin puzzle  
Im affiliated with niggas who murder rob and hustle  
Plus you think Im ballin cause Im poppin Crys and spendin Gs  
Im just tryin to drink away the pain that killed my nigga steve  
Nigga please I aint shit  
Cookies and cream  
Feelin like Marvin it make me wanna holla and scream  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Now half the shit ya doin already been done  
And thats why half my niggas dead locked up or on the run  
That dope money aint sufficient it dont last all ways  
Niggas trap all night in project hallways  
All day long niggas front like stars  
On them big ass rims that most than they cars  
Spent 300 on a outfit a hundred on some nikes  
But his baby needs wopes diapers and pedialite  
And you prolly got a cousin brother or a friend  
And this song sound like it from begging to end  
Then again it might be me  
And Im tired of the nonsense  
Cant sleep at night cause I got a guilty conscience  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Background cant you see over and over until it fades out
