Defraggin my hard drive for thrills  
I got me a hundred gigabytes of RAM  
I never feed trolls and I dont read spam  
Installed a T1 line in my house  
Always at my PC double  clickin on my mizouse  
Upgrade my system at least twice a day  
Im strictly plug  and  play I aint afraid of Y2K  
Im down with Bill Gates I call him Money for short  
I phone him up at home and I make him do my tech support  
Its all about the Pentiums what  
Youve gotta be the dumbest newbie Ive ever seen  
Youve got white  out all over your screen  
You think your Commodore 64 is really neato  
What kinda chip you got in there a Dorito  
Youre usin a 286 Dont make me laugh  
Your Windows boots up in what a day and a half  
You could back up your whole hard drive on a floppy diskette  
Youre the biggest joke on the Internet  
Your database is a disaster  
Youre waxin your modem tryin to make it go faster  
Hey fella I bet youre still livin in your parents cellar  
Downloadin pictures of Sarah Michelle Gellar  
And postin Me too like some brain  dead AOL  er  
I should do the world a favor and cap you like Old Yeller  
Youre just about as useless as jpegs to Hellen Keller

Rule cyberspace and crunch numbers like I do  
They call me the king of the spreadsheets  
Got em printed out on my bedsheets  
My new computers got the clocks it rocks  
But it was obsolete before I opened the box  
You say youve had your desktop for over a week  
Throw that junk away man its an antique  
Your laptop is a month old Well thats great  
If you could use a nice heavy paperweight  
My digital media is write  protected  
Every file inspected no viruses detected  
I beta tested every operation system  
Gave props to some and others I dissed em  
While your computers crashin mines multitaskin  
It does all my work without me even askin  
Got a flat  screen monitor forty inches wide wide  
I believe that your says Etch  A  Sketch on the side  
In a 32  bit world youre a 2  bit user  
Youve got your own newsgroup alt total  loser  
Your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax  
Whered you get your CPU in a box of Cracker Jacks  
Play me online Well you know that Ill beat you  
If I ever meet you Ill control  alt  delete you
