Bitch Im known for jammin  
  
Smoke Mary Mary Mary  
Put a mean ass flow on top of bad vocabulary  
I bust through intrude move through distractions  
Withstand hits and blows dont lose no traction  
  
I threw a round off flip flop flip flop back at em  
If a nigga comin clown then Im going get the cannon  
And the get God back  
  
Knuckle up boy dont be no fucked boy  
Me and Guillotine we run some niggas in a big truck boy  
Run flat boy run that boy  
Bitch where Im a send you you cant come back boy  
  
I bring flames to a four alarm fire  
I wash him up and ring him out and throw him in the dryer  
I hit the door Im blowin him like southern band  
And they always tryin to find something to say about the brother man  
  
I invent em flip em and send em  
Rhymes set you jumped like I poured King Cobra over ya  
Guess what this is a stick up  
Give me back my shit before I start pickin bricks up  
  
Garbage mcs better run for it  
Dont come this way cause you cant walk on this side of the yard   
And respect me for takin it to em  
So expect me to lay it down and represent my neck of the woods  
  
Yeah like that ha ha yeah yeah yeah

Hook x2  
If it dont bump off in the club you cant rock  
If it aint 808 in the trunk it aint knock  
If you round our neck of the woods you better stop  
Cause the people on the block gonna show you where to drop ahhhh  
  
Big Boi  
All a the heat rise to the beat wise  
To that nigga that spit that street fire

Youre bitch made like Dorothy  
You belong in a soroioty Im a call you Cocoa  
Like candy go sing a song with Brandy  
But rhyming and double timing what is you sayin G

And you know we doin the big beat oh hell yeah its gonna be bumpin  
Givin you somethin to beat the block with meet the cops with  
My staminas incredible so sucka dont try to stop this  
  
The DUNGEON Family merrily  
Life is but a dream I mean a nightmare cause its scarin me

Hook x2  
  
Dre  
Hey whats your name  
Andre 3000 the year to fear is already here  
Must look beyond sounds from the center of the sun  
Reason for a gun only one  
  
Strong believer in selfpreservation  
Aahh OOF  
In the State of confused  
City of forgotten fate County of the blues  
  
Street address Generation X Avenue  
But Generation why high to the point that I drink  
Runnin on a new one  
Walkin in my silver boots need a shoe horn and some church socks  
  
What if I told you that even if you made clocks  
Stops time rewinds see what he finds  
Then rearrange and change things thats on your mind  
Would you swallow like fine wine or peanut butter  
  
Would you holler that Im live and ask another  
Or take no heat and run for cover  
  
Hook x3
