I dont know how to breathe  
I dont know how to leave You  
I dont know what to say  
And who am I to say it anyway  
  
But there is always a song  
And Ill try to sing along over You  
I can hear it being sung  
All of Heaven sings along over You  
  
I hardly know Your name  
I didnt come to save You  
Your smile just broke my heart  
Now Youre in my heart  
I know Youll never leave me  
  
But there is always a song  
And Ill try to sing along over You  
I can hear it being sung  
All of Heaven sings along over You  
  
But there is always a song  
And Ill try to sing along over You  
  
Sing sing like youve never sung  
Sing for your joy to come  
Sing sing like youve never sung  
Sing of my joy to come  
  
There is always a song  
And Ill try to sing along over You  
I can hear it being sung  
All of Heaven sings along over You  
  
There is always a song  
And Ill try to sing along over You  
There is always a song  
And Ill try to sing along over You  
Always for You
