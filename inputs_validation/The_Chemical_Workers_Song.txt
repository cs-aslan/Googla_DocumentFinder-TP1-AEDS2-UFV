Chorus  
And its go boys go  
Theyll time your every breath  
And every day youre in this place your two days nearer death  
But you go  
  
Well a process man am I and I am tellin you no lie  
I work and breathe among the fumes that tread across the sky  
Theres thunder all around me and theres poison in the air  
Theres a lousy smell that smacks of hell and dust all in me hair  
  
Chorus  
  
Well Ive worked among the spitters and I breathe the oily smoke  
Ive shovelled up the gypsum and it neigh on makes you choke  
Ive stood knee deep cyanide got sick with a caustic burn  
Been working rough Ive seen enough to make your stomach turn  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres overtime and bonus opportunities galore  
The young men like their money and they all come back for more  
But soon your knocking on and you look older than you should  
For every bob made on the job you pay with flesh and blood  
  
Chorus  
  
Well a process man am I and I am telling you no lie  
I work and breathe among the fumes that tread across the sky  
Theres thunder all around me and theres poison in the air  
Theres a lousy smell that smacks of hell and dust all in me hair
