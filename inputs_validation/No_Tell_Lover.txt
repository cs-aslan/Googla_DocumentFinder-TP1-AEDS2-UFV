Pretty smile lovely face and a warm breeze now I need you lady  
Youre my no tell lover  
Every night in a different place Ill meet you tender lady  
Youre my no tell lover  
  
Everyone keeps tellin me that this affairs not meant to be  
Even though I need you night and day  
Walk away if you see me coming even if its you Im lovin  
  
Every minute is an hour every days a lonely lifetime  
Youre my no tell lover  
The little time that we spend together just cant last forever  
Youre my no tell lover

Theres nothing left to say
