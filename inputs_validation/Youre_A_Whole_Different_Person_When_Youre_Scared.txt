You met her in a Turkish town  
But you didnt want to bring her here  
You didnt want her hanging around  
In the Kingdom of Fear  
So you left her there  
  
Youre a whole different person  
Youre a whole different person  
Youre a whole different person  
When youre scared  
  
The eagle screams on Friday  
The Colts are doomed this year  
The fats finally in the fire  
In the Kingdom of Fear  
Dangerous creeps are everywhere  
  
Youre a whole different person  
When youre scared  
  
We have ways to make you talk  
You wont like at all  
If you cant run walk  
If you cant walk crawl  
But dont look down  
Its a long long fall  
And you loved her in a Turkish town  
But you didnt want to bring her here  
You didnt want her hanging around  
In the Kingdom of Fear  
So you left her there  
  
Youre a whole different person  
Youre a whole different person when youre scared
