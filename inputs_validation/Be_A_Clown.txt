Ill remember forever  
When I was but three  
Mama who was clever  
Remarking to me  
If son when youre grown up  
You want everything nice  
Ive got your future sewn up  
If you take this advice  
  
Be a clown be a clown  
All the world loves a clown  
Act the fool play the calf  
And youll always have the last laugh  
  
Wear the cap and the bells  
And youll rate with all the great swells  
If you become a doctor folksll face you with dread  
If you become a dentist theyll be glad when youre dead  
Youll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head  
Be a clown be a clown be a clown  
  
Be a clown be a clown  
All the world loves a clown  
Show em tricks tell em jokes  
And youll only stop with top folks  
  
Be a crack Jackanapes  
And theyll imitate you like apes  
Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears  
Why be a major poet and youll owe it for years  
When crowdsll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears  
Be a clown be a clown be a clown  
  
Be a clown be a clown  
All the world loves a clown  
If you just make em roar  
Watch your Mounte bank account soar  
  
Wear a painted mustache  
And youre sure to make a big splash  
A college education I should never propose  
A bachelors degree wont even keep you in clothes  
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose  
Be a clown be a clown be a clown  
  
Give em quips give em fun  
And theyll happy to say youre A1  
If you become a farmer youve the weather to buck  
If you become a gambler youll be stuck with your luck  
But Jack youll never lack if you can quack like a duck  
Be a clown be a clown be a clown
