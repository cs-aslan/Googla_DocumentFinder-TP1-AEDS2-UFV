I went to a Turkey roast down the street  
The people down there are eatin like wild geese  
So Im on my way Im goin back in Alabam  
Well you talk about your people havin a lot of time  
Eating up their chickens and drinkin their wine  
Im on my way Im goin back to Alabam  
Now some folks say that a tramp wont steal  
But I caught three in my corn field  
And Im on my way Im goin back to Alabam  
Well one had a bushel and one had a peck  
And one had a roaster near tied around his neck  
Im on my way Im goin back to Alabam  
  
Well there comes Sal walkin down the street  
With the run down shoes tied on her feet  
Im on my way Im goin back to Alabam  
When I get ready to leave this earth  
Im going back to my moneys worth  
Im on my way Im goin back to Alabam
