Try to bend me try to shake me  
Try and turn my head around  
Oh try to change me rearrange me  
I think you know about the boy you found  
A fantasy like this is hit and run  
  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
  
I had a dream about girls like you  
You said call us youll get two  
One for your money two for the show  
Ill give you something more  
I know I know I know I know  
Its hard enough to make you want to cry  
  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
  
Its hard enough to make you want to cry  
And it drives me out of my mind  
Im in love with you baby  
My poor innocent baby  
Dont you say maybe  
  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
  
Feels so good let me in  
I might jump right out of my skin  
Dont you ever grow up little girl  
Sweet young thing not so innocent  
  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls
