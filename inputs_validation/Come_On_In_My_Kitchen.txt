You better come on in my kitchen  
Its goin to be rainin outdoors  
Ah the woman I love took from my best friend  
Some joker got lucky stole her back again  
You better come on in my kitchen  
Its goin to be rainin outdoors  
Oh ah shes gone know she wont come back  
Ive taken the last nickel out of her nation sack  
You better come on in my kitchen  
Its goin to be rainin outdoors  
You better come on in my kitchen  
Its goin to be rainin outdoors  
When a woman gets in trouble everybody throws her down  
Lookin for her good friend none can be found  
You better come on in my kitchen  
Its goin to be rainin outdoors  
Winter times comin its gon be slow  
You cant make the winter babe just drive a little slow  
You better come on in my kitchen  
Its goin to be rainin outdoors  
You better come on in my kitchen  
Its goin to be rainin outdoors
