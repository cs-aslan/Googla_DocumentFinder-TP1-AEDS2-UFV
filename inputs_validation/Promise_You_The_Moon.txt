Shinin like the noon day sun  
You gave me a fever  
Hypnotized under your spell  
Caught in a rapture  
  
Theres no use in denyin  
That much is true  
Theres no other way to say it  
Id die for you  
  
Chorus  
Whatever you desire  
Child  
I give my all to you  
Tell me what you desire  
Oh child  
I promise you the moon  
  
Late at night with Quincy and Gershwin  
Its stronger than ever  
This feeling inside  
When youre holdin me baby  
  
So whats the use in denyin  
You know that it is true  
Theres no other way to say it No  
I love for you Only you  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres no use in denyin  
Id die for you
