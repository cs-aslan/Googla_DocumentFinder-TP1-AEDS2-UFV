Children in bloom cooking in the sun  
Waiting for a room of our own  
Leave my sister alone  
She dont deserve this  
She is a flower and I am a flower and  
We are all alone  
  
I gotta get out on my own  
I gotta get up from this waiting at home  
I gotta get out of this sunlight  
Its melting my bones  
I gotta get up from this slumber and get myself home  
  
All these wasted dreams  
Waiting for the sun to open up my heart to anyone  
Bring me some rain  
Because Im dying and I cant get this damn thing closed again  
  
I gotta get out on my own  
I gotta get up from this waiting at home  
I gotta get out of this sunlight  
Its melting my bones  
I gotta get up from this slumber and get myself home  
  
Wheres the funhouse this year  
The fairgrounds deserted and the skies dont seem as near  
Nicoles my oldest friend  
But the altar is empty and shell never be a little girl again  
  
I gotta get out on my own  
I gotta get up from this waiting at home  
I gotta get out of this sunlight  
Its melting my bones  
I gotta get up from this slumber and get myself home  
I cant find my way home
