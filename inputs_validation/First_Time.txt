The lights are low  
And were alone  
The fires glow  
It keeps us warm  
As I reach out and touch your face  
The moon lights up our first embrace  
But please dont hesitate  
Hold my hand dont be afraid  
Of the feelings in your heart  
Just close your eyes no one will mind  
If were to fall in love this first time  
  
Dont be afraid of love  
Dont be afraid of love  
Dont be afraid of love  
  
Its the first time  
The first time for love  
There could be so many worlds and mountains  
We could climb  
Together the two of us tonight  
  
The two of us were quite a pair  
These lonely nights we both can share  
So dont be shy cause its okay  
I understand feeling that way  
Hold my hand dont be afraid  
Of the feelings in your heart  
Close your eyes no one will mind  
If were to fall in love this first time  
Its the first time  
The first time for love  
There could be so many worlds and mountains  
We could climb  
Together the two of us tonight
