Walk away  
  
Look out now baby wont you take me away  
Sittin here its gonna be a new day  
Gotta sing my song and I cant go wrong  
Gotta keep on roaming gotta sing my song  
  
What you feeling when you hold me tight  
Im gonna cuddle up with you tonight gonna get you feeling so secure  
listen child dont you see theres a cure  
Anywhere got to get you away feels so good think its gonna be a new day  
Im gonna get my song till I cant go on  
Im gonna keep on roaming gonna sing my song  
  
I want you to sing it sing it sing it sing it along  
I want you to sing it sing it sing it sing it along
