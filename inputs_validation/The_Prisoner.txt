Thanking you for openining my eyes so clear sweeping old illusions from my
soul  
But most of all for turning something simple and sincere  
Into somethin jaded and as jive as rock and roll  
  
Aint you always looked at lovin like a four letter word  
That Ive made up to make you ill at ease  
I fought to free you from your castle of despair til I saw the prisoner wall
was me  
  
See the soul who calls itself a prisoner cause its still too frightened to
be free  
I feel so much older now and wiser aint it sad how lonesome that can be  
  
Aint you always looked
