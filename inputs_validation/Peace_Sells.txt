What do you mean I dont believe in God  
I talk to him everyday  
What do you mean I dont support your system  
I go to court when I have to  
What do you mean I cant get to work on time  
I got nothing better to do  
And what do you mean I dont pay my bills  
Why do you think Im broke Huh  
  
If theres a new way  
Ill be the first in line  
But it better work this time  
  
What do you mean I hurt your feelings  
I didnt know you had any feelings  
What do you mean I aint kind  
Just not your kind  
What do you mean I couldnt be the President  
Of the United States of America  
Tell me something its still We the people right  
  
If theres a new way  
Ill be the first in line  
But it better work this time  
Can you put a price on peace  
  
Peace  
Peace sells  
Peace  
Peace sells  
Peace sells but whos buying  
Peace sells but whos buying  
Peace sells but whos buying  
Peace sells but whos buying  
No peace sells
