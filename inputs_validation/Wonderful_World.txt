I dont know much about my history now  
Dont know much about biology  
Dont know much about the science book now  
Dont know much about the French I took  
  
All I do know is I love you now  
And I wonder if you love me too  
Ooh what a wonderful world this could be  
  
Ooh I dont know much about geography now  
Dont know much about trigonometry now  
Dont know much about the algebra  
Dont know what a slide rule is for  
  
But I do know one and one is two now  
And I wonder if you love me too  
Ooh what a wonderful world this could be  
  
I dont claim to be an A student  
But thats what Im trying to be  
But by being an A student baby  
Look like I could win your love for me
