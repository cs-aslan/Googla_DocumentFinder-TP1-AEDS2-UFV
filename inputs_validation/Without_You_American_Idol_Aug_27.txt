No I cant forget this evening  
Nor your face as you were leaving  
But I guess thats just the way the story goes  
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows  
Yes it shows  
I cant live  
If living is without you  
I cant live  
I cant give anymore  
I cant live  
If living is without you  
Cant live  
Cant give anymore  
Well I cant forget this evening  
Nor your face as you were leaving  
But I guess thats just the way the story goes  
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows  
Yeah yes it shows  
Cant live  
If living is without you  
Cant live  
I cant give anymore  
Cant live No cant live  
If living is without you No I cant live  
Oh I cant live  
Cant give anymore Oh  
No cant live  
No I cant live  
No oh yeah no no no no no  
I cant live
