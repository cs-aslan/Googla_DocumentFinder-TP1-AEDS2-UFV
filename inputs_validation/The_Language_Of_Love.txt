She says no  
When she means yes  
And what she wants  
You know that I cant guess  
When we want more  
You know we ask for less  
Such is the language of love  
  
I say leave  
When I mean stay  
But she dont see  
And so she moves away  
What we really want  
You know we rarely say  
Such is the language of love  
  
Its tooth for tooth  
and eye for eye  
We hide our hearts  
And then we wont say why  
Its truth for truth  
and lie for lie  
Such is the language of love  
  
One cries foul  
And will not speak  
The other claims a little victory  
And all the time  
You know we fail to see  
This is the language of love  
  
When a loves begins to wander  
No one ever knows  
But we feel it deep inside us  
Long before it shows  
Long before it shows  
  
We hem and haw  
We balk and bluff  
Our words dont ever seem to  
say enough  
But a simple smile  
A tender touch  
Speaks the true language of love  
  
When a loves begins to wander  
No one ever knows  
But we feel it deep inside us  
Long before it shows  
Long before it shows  
  
She says no  
When she means yes  
And what she wants  
You know that I cant guess  
When we want more  
You know we ask for less  
Such is the language of love  
Such is the language of love
