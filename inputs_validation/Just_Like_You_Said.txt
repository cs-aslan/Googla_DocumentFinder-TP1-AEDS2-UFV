and now that all is said and done its kind of hard to hold my tongue because
you still dont believe youre wrong im not so sure what i would say if i
could talk to you that way you wouldnt understand i was foolish from the
start ive tried not to fall apart its just like you said but everything is
somehow different ive tried hard not to admit that there was some truth to it
its just like you said but everything is somehow different have you ever
imagined what you think the way your circumstance would be and fixed a
picture in your head i guess youve thought of everything im sure you know
much more than me at least thats what you think it shouldnt have to make you
wonder i thought you knew it all along how i was innocent and pure and you
were smug and so demure when you predicted i would fall
