Theres a red cloud hanging over us  
And its so big and its gonna burst  
All you people with your heads in the ground  
Hey brother where you bound  
  
And theyre no good and theyre everywhere  
Try to tell you but you just dont care  
Try to hear you but you dont make a sound  
Hey brother where you bound  
Hey brother where you bound  
  
And you dont know what theyre gonna do  
And you dont know how they feel  
And you dont know what theyre tellin you  
Is it a lie or is it real  
And the next thing that you know is  
That they walk out on the deal  
  
And the message that theyre giving you  
Is the same old alibi  
If you dont quite see their point of view  
Then they treat you like a spy  
And the phone rings and you disappear  
In the middle of the night  
  
Cant you see theyre on the move  
Dont know what youre trying to prove  
But you sit there oh so cool  
Like they never broke no rules  
  
And the cat flies and the crow walks  
And the ghost dies and the sow talks  
And they tell us that theyll be good as gold  
Believe nothing that youre told  
Hey brother wheres your soul  
  
Make a move in one direction  
Try to make some compromise  
But they greet you with rejection  
Makin out youre tellin lies  
Then they turn around and tell you  
Better get down from the sky  
  
For the sake of all thats holy  
Listen good to what I say  
I can feel them all around me  
They could be here any day  
But you act like you dont know me  
Why d you look at me that way  
  
If theres one thing that is clear  
We gotta get away from here  
Weve gotta leave this place  
Its just a hopeless case  
Aint no one else to blame  
Were gonna lose this game  
  
Hey brother get off my back  
I gotta tell you youre way off the track  
They got a hatred deep down inside  
Aint gonna let them take me alive  
  
Im gonna burn them down just wait and see  
Aint gonna let them walk over me  
Boy you aint got no heart and soul  
And your mind is weak and your bloods runnin cold  
  
You better move you better hide  
Theyre gettin in theyre gettin inside  
If you get caught you better know  
Theyre gonna reap youre gonna sow  
  
Dont be a fool we gotta go  
Aint no place safe for us to stay  
We better move on we better move on
