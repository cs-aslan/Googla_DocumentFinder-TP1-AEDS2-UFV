She plays guitar with her fingertips  
Shell play your heart with her tender lips  
Shell work it out until she makes the tips  
And its alright yeah its alright  
Holding her tight in late December  
I look in the stars and I remember  
She doesnt mind when you offend her  
And its alright yeah its alright  
  
Just a girl like you and maybe just a  
Just a guy like me maybe we  
Could take a walk on the wild side  
Take a look and see  
Get up and go  
Just a girl like you and maybe just a  
Just a guy like me maybe we  
Could take a walk on the wild side  
Take a look and take a look and go  
Get Up and Go  
  
What could I give when youve got all you need  
And she looks at me like all I wants a little free  
Every time I look at you it makes me see  
That its alright yeah its alright  
Well get away be in love we can make it better  
All I needs a little time for us to get together  
Happiness is just a step away  
When its alright yeah its alright  
  
Just a girl like you and maybe just a  
Just a guy like me maybe we  
Could take a walk on the wild side  
Take a look and see  
Get up and go  
Just a girl like you and maybe just a  
Just a guy like me maybe we  
Could take a walk on the wild side  
Take a look and take a look and go  
  
Ooh oh ooh oh wont you go  
Ooh oh ooh oh wont you go  
Ooh oh ooh oh wont you go  
Take a look and take a look and go  
  
Seems like love has always found a way  
But theres only so many hours in the day  
All that I know is that youre here with me  
And its alright yeah its alright  
Wont you tell me that you need me so bad  
Cause you are everything Ive never had  
Every time I look at you it hurts so bad  
And its alright yeah its alright  
  
Just a girl like you and maybe just a  
Just a guy like me maybe we  
Could take a walk on the wild side  
Take a look and see  
Get up and go  
Just a girl like you and maybe just a  
Just a guy like me maybe we  
Could take a walk on the wild side  
Take a look and take a look and go  
Get up and go
