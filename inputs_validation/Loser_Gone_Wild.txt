I dont mind the pain or the jokers cold refrain  
The days pass by so slowly I count them all again  
Silence of a basement shades all closed at noon  
Lie awake for fear of strangers  
  
Darkness comes on slowly twilight is the ecstasy  
Like a candle burning bright shadows dance until the night  
Empty rooms and chilling smiles  
They go on for miles and miles  
  
But in the evening when the sun goes down  
Crawl from the shadows got to get into town  
Where the music is playin all across the night  
And every cloud disappears from sight  
  
There goes a loser another loser gone  
There goes another another whos alone  
There goes a loser another loser gone wild  
  
I dont mind if violins dont play  
I wont listen to them anyway  
I dont care what people say  
Some things just cant be arranged  
Icy fingers touching you  
Silent voices calling too  
What else is there to lose  
I am here but where are you  
  
But in the evening when the sun goes down  
Crawl from the shadows got to get into town  
Where the music is playin all across the night  
And every cloud disappears from sight
