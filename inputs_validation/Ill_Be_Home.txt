Ill be home  
Ill be home  
When your nights are troubled  
And youre all alone  
When youre feeling down  
And need some sympathy  
Nobodys around to keep you company  
Remember baby  
You can always count on me  
Ill be home  
Ill be home  
Ill be home  
Hum Ill be home  
Wherever you may wander  
Wherever you may roam  
Youll come back  
And Ill be waiting here for you  
No one else will ever love you  
The way I do  
Ill be here to comfort you  
And see you through  
Ill be home  
Ill be home  
Ill be home
