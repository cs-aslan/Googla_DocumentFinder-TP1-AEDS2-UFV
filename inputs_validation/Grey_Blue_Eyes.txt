I fade from the light  
Your glory was lost that night  
And no mind cant get me right  
And now Im praying that youll find me out  
Stone stone has pulled me down  
But my faith has got me bound to your grey blue eyes  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
  
Dont forget my broken heart  
You remember it from the start  
You made it and its all a part  
Of your grey blue eyes  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
  
Youre gone and I know Im dead  
Ive lost my way  
Cant find me in your grey blue eyes  
Grey blue eyes  
Grey blue eyes  
Grey blue eyes
