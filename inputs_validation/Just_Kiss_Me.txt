Just kiss me  
And forget all about that other stuff  
Kiss me  
Your big red lips I think will be enough  
  
Dont worry with your lipstick  
Im gonna kiss it all away  
Throw away your lipstick  
That aint your color anyway  
  
My lips are your color  
So lips stick with me  
  
Ooo when you kiss me  
Ive got to know just how much you miss me  
  
Kiss me  
And Ill take your lips to paradise  
Kiss me  
And paradise will never feel so nice  
  
Youre beautiful  
You dont need all that make up  
And you dont need to take up  
All of your time in front of the mirror  
Dont you know that youre my deara  
Baby cant you see were in love  
  
Ooo when you kiss me  
Ive got to know just how much you miss me  
  
Kiss me  
And put all the stars back in the sky  
Kiss me  
And maybe then youll know the reason why  
I want you  
And my loves gonna haunt you  
And Im gonna flaunt you  
  
In front of all the boys that live on my street  
And theyre gonna be jealous cause youre so sweet  
Do you think I should repeat  
Do you think I should repeat  
Repeat  
Repeat  
Aw say it man  
  
Im in love  
Love  
Im in love  
  
Im in love  
Sweet love
