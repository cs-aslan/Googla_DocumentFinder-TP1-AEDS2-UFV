Lonely am I  
Only my thoughts crowd the room  
Why cant I cry  
  
Time passes me by  
The cold touch of dawn tells me so  
Still I can t cry  
  
You promised to love me and vowed  
Youd never leave me alone with a broken heart  
You treated along like a game tortured my mind  
With the pain that someday youd go  
  
Flames in the fire  
Cant warm the chill of my room  
Why cant I cry  
  
Feel I want to die  
Just how much more can I take  
If I cant cry  
  
You promised to love me and vowed  
Youd never leave me alone with a broken heart  
You treated along like a game tortured my mind  
With the pain that someday youd go  
  
I multiply all of the hours youve been gone  
Still I cant cry  
Lonely am I  
Why cant I cry
