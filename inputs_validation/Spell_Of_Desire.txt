I know that Im out of my mind  
Yeah I know when two hearts collide  
It can be such a suffering thing  
I was there before now Im here again  
Im a sucker for love  
La la la la la la la  
I walk right into temptation  
And I cant get enough  
La la la la la la la  
Im addicted to the sensation  
So tell me how tell me where tell me when you want it  
And Ill arrange the stars around oh oh oh  
Tell me true tell me nice tell me how you feeling  
The universe is ours tonight oh oh oh  
Tell me now tell me deep tell me in the moment  
This house of ours is made of fire Oh oh oh  
  
And Ill arrange a spell of desire  
I know that Im helpless and crazy  
I thaw and I cannot explain why I do  
Its like a lock and a key  
You open the door and Im running free  
Im a sucker for love  
La la la la la la la  
I walk right into temptation  
And I cant get enough  
  
La la la la la la la  
Im addicted to the sensation  
So tell me how tell me where tell me when you want it  
And Ill arrange the stars around oh oh oh  
Tell me true tell me nice tell me how you feeling  
The universe is ours tonight oh oh oh  
Tell me now tell me deep tell me in the moment  
This house of ours is made of fire Oh oh oh  
  
And Ill arrange a spell of desire  
Oh oh  
So tell me how tell me where tell me when you want it  
And Ill arrange the stars around oh oh oh  
Tell me true tell me nice tell me how you feeling  
The universe is ours tonight oh oh oh  
Tell me now tell me deep tell me in the moment  
This house of ours is made of fire Oh oh oh  
  
And Ill arrange a spell of desire  
So tell me how tell me where tell me when you want it  
And Ill arrange the stars around oh oh oh  
Tell me true tell me nice tell me how you feeling  
The universe is ours tonight oh oh oh  
Tell me now tell me deep tell me in the moment
