Theres a spark of magic in your eye  
Candyland appears each time you smile  
Never thought that fairy tales came true  
But they come true when Im near you  
Youre a genie in disguise  
Full of wonder and surprise and  
  
Betcha by golly wow wow  
Youre the one that Ive been waiting for forever  
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong  
Keep growing strong  
  
If I could Id catch a falling star  
To shine on you so I know where you are  
Color rainbows in your favorite shades  
To show I love you thinking of you  
  
Write your name across the sky  
Anything you ask Ill try cause  
  
Betcha by golly wow wow  
Youre the one that Ive been waiting for forever  
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong  
Keep growing strong
