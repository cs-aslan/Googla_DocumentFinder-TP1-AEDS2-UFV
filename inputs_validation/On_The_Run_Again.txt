Outcast not knowing right from wrong  
Surrounded by women wine and song  
Never still always on the run  
Prince of the night killing with a gun  
  
Now hes taken a life away  
Nowhere to run nowhere to stay  
  
Renegade he fled from town to town  
Vigilantes joint to hunt him down  
For his head lies a might price  
Hes a wanted man dead or alive  
  
Where will he go from here  
Hes on the run againnowhereno no  
  
Hes got mixed emotions running through his head  
With a crazy notion hes gonna end up dead  
  
Hes on the run againrepeat 4 times  
Tell me when will it end
