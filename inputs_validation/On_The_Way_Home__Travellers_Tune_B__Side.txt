When the dream came I held my breath with my eyes closed  
I went insane like a smokering day when the wind blows  
  
Now I wont be back till later on if I do come back at all  
But you know me and I miss you now  
  
Doo doo doo  
  
In a strange game I saw myself as you knew me  
When the change came and you had a chance to see through me  
  
Well the other side is just the same  
You cant tell my dream is real  
Because I love you  
Can you see me now  
  
Though we rush ahead to save our time  
We are only what we feel  
And I love you  
Can you feel it now
