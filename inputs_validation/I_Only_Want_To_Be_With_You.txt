I dont know what is that makes me love you so  
I only know I never want to let you go  
Cause you started something cant you see  
That ever since we met youve had a hold on me  
It happens to be true  
I only want to be with you  
It doesnt matter where you go or what you do  
I want to spend each moment of the day with you  
Look what has happened with just one kiss  
I never knew that I could be in love like this  
Its crazy but its true  
I only want to be with you  
You stopped and smiled at me asked me if Id care to dance  
I fell into your open arms and I didnt stand a chance  
Now listen honey I just want to be beside you everywhere  
As long as were together honey I dont care  
Cause you started something cant you see  
That ever since we met youve had a hold on me  
No matter what you do  
I only want to be with you  
No matter what you do  
I only want to be with you
