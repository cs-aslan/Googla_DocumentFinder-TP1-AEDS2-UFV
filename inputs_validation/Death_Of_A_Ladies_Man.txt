Ah the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread  
I never even knew how much I wanted you she said  
His muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete  
O baby I have come too late She knelt beside his feet  
Ill never see a face like yours in years of men to come  
Ill never see such arms again in wrestling or in love  
And all his virtues burning in the smoky Holocaust  
She took unto herself most everything her lover lost  
Now the master of this landscape he was standing at the view  
With a sparrow of St Francis that he was preaching to  
She beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood  
She said Ill make a place between my legs  
Ill show you solitude  
  
He offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room  
He promised her protection for the issue of her womb  
She moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon  
She stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon  
  
She took his much admired oriental frame of mind  
And the heartofdarkness alibi his money hides behind  
She took his blonde Madonna and his monastery wine  
This mental space is occupied and everything is mine  
  
He tried to make a final stand beside the railway track  
She said The art of longings over and its never coming back  
She took his tavern parliament his cap his cocky dance  
She mocked his female fashions and his workingclass mustache  
  
The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get  
A womans education but hes not a woman yet  
And the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy  
Who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy  
  
So the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed  
It would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed  
Its like our visit to the moon or to that other star  
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far  
  
Its like our visit to the moon or to that other star  
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far  
  
Its like our visit to the moon or to that other star  
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far
