Down in Larissas lagoon  
She sits by the light of the moon  
Shes hearing voices in her head  
She must be strong  
She must not give in to their song  
Shes hearing voices in her head  
  
Down in Larissas lagoon  
Her guests they sleep in separate rooms  
But her father comes to tuck her into bed  
Shes lost her mind  
Got no control  
And theres nowhere else to go  
When her father comes to tuck her into bed  
  
Chrous  
But Larissa woke up one morning singing  
Hallelujah remember me for my passion  
The paradise that I imagined hallelujah  
  
Down in Larissas lagoon  
The skies they never look blue  
Cause someone spiked the rain  
With a little extra juice  
She thinks shes being followed  
Any minute shell be swallowed  
Someone spiked this rain  
With a little extra juice  
  
Chorus  
  
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Down in Larissas lagoon  
There is no force thats greater  
Looming deep within a very very very troubled girl  
She stays awake for hours  
Picking out the sweetest flowers  
To lay upon the grave of a very very troubled girl  
  
Chorus
