I wouldnt be so alone  
If they knew my name in every home  
Kevin Spacey would call on the phone  
But Id be too busy  
Come back to the old five and dime  
Cameron Diaz give me a sign  
I make you smile all the time  
and your conversation would complement mine  
  
I will talk and Hollywood will listen  
See them bow my every word  
Mr Spielberg look just what youre missing  
Doesnt that seem a little absurd to bow at my every word  
  
Buy up the rights to my book  
And live on a ranch from what the box office took  
I go on visit the set  
Theyll call me their savior  
All the people wills come  
Celebrity lives on the moon  
But Ill be back home in June  
To promote The sequel  
  
I will talk and Hollywood will listen  
See them bow my every word  
Mr Spielberg look just what youre missing  
Doesnt that seem a little absurd to bow at my every word
