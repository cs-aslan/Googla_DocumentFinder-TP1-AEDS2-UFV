Dont want no secret agent  
Dont need no long Cadillac  
Dont want nobody with no problems  
I dont need a man with a monkey on his back  
I need a real man  
I said a real man  
I need a real man  
  
Aint messing with no toy  
I dont need no baby boy  
Dont need to send me no flowers babe  
Sending flowers is real nice  
Way Ive been feeling my hearts been areeling  
I need a man that loves me once  
I want a man that loves me twice  
Its a sticky situation babe  
Keep me up late at night  
Honey dont know the difference  
Wanna go left when you should of gone right  
  
I want a real man  
I said a real man  
I want a real man  
Ive been around the world  
Im a woman not a girl  
  
I dont want no million dollers  
I dont need no diamond ring  
You can twist and shout  
For to knock yourself out  
I dont care about material things  
  
I want a real man  
I need a real man  
I want a real man  
I said a real man  
I want a real man  
I need a real man baby  
I want a real man  
I want a real man  
Real man  
Real man  
  
Aint messing with no toy  
Dont need no baby boy  
I been around the world  
Im a woman not a girl  
I want a real man  
Real man
