Ive got nothing in my head  
Got a floor for a bed  
My futures at the bottom of a tea cup  
  
I got a half a pair of shoes  
And no time to lose  
Im wondering when Im going to wise up  
  
So fortune shine your light on me and my nose  
Cause we need some security  
You get a little bad luck  
And it grows and it grows  
Im the black sheep of the family  
  
Ive got half a pound of rice  
A beard full of lice  
A condition called retrogression  
  
Ive got pocket full of dust  
And eating is a must  
If you want to make a good impression  
  
So fortune shine your light on me and my dog  
Cause we need some security  
While all the folks are living high on high on the hog  
Im the black sheep of the family  
  
Dont talk to me about society  
You got to play the rules  
Or pay the penalty  
  
Because theres nothing to choose  
Between a handful of blues  
Double indemnity  
  
The hour was wrong  
And my shadows getting long  
My real lifes a song dont need much  
Ive got an ache in my head  
I want to go to bed  
Tomorrow I dont have to wake up no  
  
So wisdom shine your light on me and my knees  
Cause its true what they say about familiarity  
Theres nothing good this way  
And its true they say  
Im the black sheep of the family  
  
Oh my wisdom shine your light on me and my knees  
Its true what they say about familiarity  
Theres nothing good this way  
And its true they say  
Im the black sheep of the family  
Yeah yeah  
  
Im the black sheep of the family  
Just me and my dog yeah yeah  
Im the black sheep of the family  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Im the black sheep of the family  
Youve got me on my knees  
Im the black sheep of the family  
Yeah yeah yeah
