Words and Music by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe  
  
From the Broadway musical My Fair Lady  
  
  
Im gettin married in the morning  
Ding dong the bells are gonna chime  
Pull out the stopper lets have a whopper  
But get me to the church on time  
  
I gotta be there in the morning  
Spruced up and looking in my prime  
Girls come and kiss me show how youll miss me  
But get me to the church on time  
  
If I am dancing roll up the floor  
If I am whistling whisk me out the door for  
  
Im gettin married in the morning  
Ding dong the bells are gonna chime  
Kick up a rumpus but dont lose your compass  
And get me to the church get me to the church  
For Petes sake get me to the church on time
