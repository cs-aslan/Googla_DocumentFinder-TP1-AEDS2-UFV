The sunday mornin gospel goes good with the soul  
Theres blues folk and country and rock like a rollin stone  
The world could come together as one  
If everybody under the sun  
Add some music to your day  
Add some music add some add some music to your day  
A bob didit a bop didit  
  
Youll hear it while youre walkin by a neighbors home  
Youll hear it faintly in the distance when youre on the phone  
Youre sittin in a dentists chair  
And theyve got music for you there  
To add some music  
Add some music add some add some music to your  
To your day  
A bob didit a bop didit  
  
Add some music music everywhere add some music  
Add some add some add some add some music add some music  
Your doctor knows it keeps you calm  
Your preacher adds it to his psalms  
So add some music  
Add some music add some add some music to your  
To your day  
  
Music  
Add some music add some music  
When youre alone  
Add some music add some music  
Is like a companion  
Add some music add some music  
For your lonely soul  
Oo oo oo woo oo woo oo oo oo oooo  
  
When day is over when day is over  
I close my tired eyes I close my tired  
Music is in my soul  
  
At a movie you can feel it touching your heart  
And on every day of the summertime  
Youll hear children chasing ice cream carts  
Theyll play it on your wedding day  
There must be bout a million ways  
To add some music  
Add some music add some add some music to your  
To your day  
  
Add some music to your day  
Add some music to your day  
Add some music to your day  
Add some music to your day  
Add some music to your day
