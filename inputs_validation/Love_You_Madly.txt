I dont want to wonder if this is a blunder  
I dont want to worry whether were going to stay together till we die  
I dont want you jumping unless this musics thumping  
All the dishes rattle in the cupboards when the elephants arrive  
  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you now  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you love you love you madly  
  
I dont want to fake it I just want to make it  
The ornaments look pretty but theyre pulling down the branches of the tree  
I dont want to think about it I dont want to talk about  
When I kiss your lips I want to sink down to the bottom of the sea  
  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you now  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you love you love you madly  
  
I dont want to hold back I dont want to slip down  
I dont want to think back to the one thing that I know I should have down  
I dont want to doubt you know everything about you  
I dont want to sit across the table from you wishing I could run  
  
I want to love madly  
I want to love you now  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you love you love you madly
