By David Allan Coe  
  
Ive got this weakness for women and whiskey  
  
Its something I just cant control  
  
Ive tried hard to shake it with out any luck  
  
It keeps burning deep in my soul  
  
I thought you could change things and while you were with me  
  
I never loved no one but you  
  
But its gonna take more that whisky and women  
  
To make me forget that were through  
  
Baby sometimes at night when I reach out to touch you  
  
I wake up chilled to the bone  
  
There is so many things I cant get used to  
  
Specially being alone  
  
I built my whole world around you and now that your gone  
  
I dont know what to do  
  
But its gonna take more that whisky and women  
  
To make me forget that were through  
  
I found me A woman to lay down beside me  
  
She offered her body and soul  
  
And I took them hoping for some silly reason  
  
Shed help me regain self control  
  
I left like A thief in the night when the first light of dawn  
  
Turned the grey skies to blue  
  
I sobered up knowing shed never be able  
  
To make me forget that were through
