Cursed Earth  
Cursed Earth  
Cursed Earth  
Cursed Earth  
  
I will never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart all  
Because we all live in the valley of the walls when we speak  
We can peak from the windows of their mouths to see the land  
The women chant as they fly up to the sun  
  
You never think you know why  
Know You never think you know why  
Know You never think you know why  
Know Ever think you know why  
Know  
  
Books all say different things while people flap their yellow wings  
Trying to soar by being a whore of life  
And almost everything the sheep that ran off from the herd may be dead  
But nows a bird able to fly able to die able to break your cursed earth  
fuck your mothers earth  
  
You never think you know why  
Know You never think you know why  
Know You never think you know why  
Know Ever think you know why  
Know  
  
On the other side on the other side the other side  
Do you ever try to fly Do you ever try to fly  
Have you ever wanted to die you ever want to die  
  
Dont ever try to fly dont ever try to fly  
Dont ever try to fly unless you leave your body on the other side  
Never try to die you ever try to die  
  
Know You never think you know why  
Know You never think you know why  
Know You never think you know why  
Know Ever think you know why  
Know
