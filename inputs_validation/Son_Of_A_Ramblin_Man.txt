Have you ever had a thing for a woman  
A thing that makes you lose your mind  
Every time I start to think about her  
Sends shivers up and down my spine  
My daddy was a bit of a rounder  
Said these women are gonna make you go blind  
I told my old man that Im right over here  
Like the way I see just fine  
Im the son of a ramblin man  
Son of a runnin kind  
Im the son of a ramblin man  
I come from a long long line  
Well Im just a hillbilly gypsy  
I aint much for settling down  
If I thought somebody might miss me  
Maybe Id hang around  
So I better keep on drifting  
As every town just a little too small  
Aint nothin in the world like a woman  
Im going to try to love them all  
Im the son of a ramblin man  
Son of a runnin kind  
Im the son of a ramblin man  
I come from a long long line  
Im the son of a ramblin man  
Son of a runnin kind  
Im the son of a ramblin man  
I come from a long long line  
Im the son of a ramblin man  
Son of a runnin kind  
Im the son of a ramblin man  
I come from a long long line  
Im the son of a ramblin man  
Son of a runnin kind  
Im the son of a ramblin man  
I come from a long long line
