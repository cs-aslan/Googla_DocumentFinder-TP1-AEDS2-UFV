I dont care where Im going  
Just as long as Im with you  
Put it there pal Put it there  
  
Ill be just like your horses  
And Ill stick to you like glue  
Put it there pal Put it there  
  
Im glad youre fooling Pepsodent oh that happy snow  
Stealing all that cash  
I hear your show on Thursdays nice huh  
What a lot of eggs you smash  
  
Well at least I dont depend upon  
Colognes big moustache oh he gave me the brush  
Youre faithful and youre fair  
Put it there skin me Dad skin me  
  
Youve got that something in your voice  
So right for selling cheese hustle a lot of the stuff  
Put it there pal Put it there put that back in the bowl  
  
You know I think your jokes are great really  
Its just that folks are hard to please theyre just snobs that all  
Put it there pal Put it there  
  
Your face could make a fortune  
Just your nose should make a lot how do you siphon  
I like the way you wear those gaudycolored shirts youve got boy  
The only time a rainbow ever covered up a pot  
Youre such a perfect square ohoh is that on the paper  
Where Where  
  
Shall we dance  
Sorry I have my heavy underwear on  
Oh just to once around to the adrenalin huh  
Well OK if I lead  
  
My colleague my crony my cohort my friend  
Companions confederates chums to the end  
Like meat and potatoes or salt and tomatoes  
Boy what a blend  
  
Dont put it in the paper dont worry about me  
Dont put it on the air Ill finish it  
Dont put it in your pipe  
Put it there  
  
Confidentially do you like this as well as singing  
Leave your name with the girl when you go out  
We may get to you for some crowd noises  
Be sure and call me  
All right
