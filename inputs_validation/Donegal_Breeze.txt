Chorus  
With your dark hair in the donegal breeze  
Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground  
But theres madness in the sycamore trees  
And theres no salvation to be found  
Right now the only thing that my mind ever holds  
Are long dark silences or screaming that explodes  
Burning rocking beds with visions of a land  
Long dark tunnels questions and calm  
But with you you know I have no doubts  
And fear will have no sting  
With your brilliant eyes and your lost and broken wing  
My head upon your shoulder as you take me in your arms  
Continents will crumble we will find no harm  
Chorus  
With your dark hair in the donegal breeze  
Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground  
But theres madness in the sycamore trees  
And theres no salvation to be found  
Well Ill brace myself against the dark endeavour to go on  
No matter how long it takes and even though I might be wrong  
And I will ask a little favour of whatever God I find  
And I will come back for you darling when I find some peace of mind  
Well I dont know about tomorrow it will be here and gone  
I dont know about tonight itll be too long  
Sometimes I think Im dying and I dont care how  
All I know is that I want you and I want you here and now  
Chorus  
With your dark hair in the donegal breeze  
Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground  
But theres madness in the sycamore trees  
And theres no salvation to be found
