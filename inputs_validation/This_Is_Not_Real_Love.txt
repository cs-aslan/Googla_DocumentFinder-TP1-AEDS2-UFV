Dont kiss me darling  
I want you to hear the things I say  
I loved you in my way  
But you know Im gonna leave you  
  
The clock was always ticking  
And your heart  
Yes I know your heart is always on the run  
  
I hate what Ive become  
But Im still gonna leave you  
And I dont think you should stay for the night  
  
Baby you know that my flesh is weak  
You know I simply  
  
I cannot sleep without you  
My heart has simply nowhere to go  
  
Nothing to hold  
Those tears youre crying  
  
Time and time again you take me back in baby  
  
You dont have to make it plain  
  
This is not real love  
  
Look at us dancing baby  
Lets dance and show them all  
Dance and show them all  
How close we are  
The lies have worked so far  
So we go on deceiving  
  
But darling dont you know the time  
Baby look at yourself holding back the tide  
Like youve got something else up your sleeve  
Thats why Ive got to leave  
  
And I dont think you should stay here tonight  
Baby dont you know that my flesh is weak you know  
I simply I cannot sleep without you  
But someday Ill have nothing to show  
Nothing to show  
Nothing to show  
Ive nothing to hold  
  
Oh baby crying  
All those simple things that wont come again  
Oh do I have to make it plain  
This is not real love  
And I said this is not real love  
  
Real love  
Baby it dont glisten and shine the way it used to  
  
This is not real love real love  
Baby think of all the promises I made on the day that I seduced you  
Baby dont wait for me like some angel of tragedy  
I have to set you free  
Darling you should be long gone oh long gone by now  
You should be with someone someone  
  
Glisten and shine  
You promised me  
  
Youve gotta face it woman you aint ever gonna change me  
  
Where will I go what do I know  
About life without you  
You promised me youd never leave me no  
This is not real love
