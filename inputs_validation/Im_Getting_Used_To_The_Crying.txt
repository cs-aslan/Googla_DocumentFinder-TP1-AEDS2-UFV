Ive gotten youused to the cryyin  
But at least were alone  
When I have to crawawl  
But dararlin when you say  
That Ill find looove again  
I think I hate that most of aall  
Ive gotten youused to the teareardrops  
And at least were aloone  
When they start to fall  
But dararlin dararlin when you say  
Ill find looove again  
I think I hate that most of aall  
Ive gotten youused to the cryyin  
And at least were alone  
When I have to crawl  
But dararlin dararlin goodbye  
Takes so loong to say  
And I think I hate that moost of aaaaall
