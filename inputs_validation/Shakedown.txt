No matter what you think you pull youll find its not enough  
No matter who you think you know you wont get through  
Its a given LA law  
Someones faster on the draw  
No matter where you hide Im comin after you yeah  
  
No matter how the race is run it always ends the same  
Another room without a view awaits downtown  
You can shake me for a while  
Live it up in style  
No matter what you do Im gonna take you down  
  
Chorus  
Shakedown  
Breakdown  
Takedown  
Everybody wants into the crowded line  
Breakdown  
Takedown  
Youre busted  
Let down  
Your guard  
Honey just about the time youre thinkin its alright  
Breakdown  
Takedown  
Youre busted  
  
This is a town where everyone is reachin for the top  
This is a place where second best will never do  
Its OK to want to shine  
But once you step across that line  
No matter where you hide Im comin after you  
  
Chorus
