You grip your hands around my throat  
And you strip the buttons off my coat  
And I choose the methods I do best  
And the thumpthumps are thumping in you chest  
  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
  
You leave these marks upon my neck  
And theyre still there  
I know but I still check  
  
And the thumpthumps are thumping in my chest  
As I loose the feeling in my fingertips  
  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
Now that youre dear to me  
Please check your clothing at the door  
And who youre supposed to be  
You always leave me wanting more  
Now that youre dear to me  
Shall we get intimate again  
Now that youre dear to me  
Shall we get intimate again  
Shall we get intimate again  
Shall we get intimate again  
I think so I think so  
Shall we get intimate again  
Now that youre dear to me me  
  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver  
  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver ooh oh ooh oh  
When you are close to me I shiver  
When you are close to me I shiver shiver
