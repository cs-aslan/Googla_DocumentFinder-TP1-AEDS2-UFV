Dreams that have flown down the hall  
Tears that were sown on despair  
Summers turned fall  
It dont matter at all  
When I wake and find you lying there  
Sweet silence and soft auburn hair  
  
Blues gonna dance through the sky  
Times gonna roll soft as rain  
Sigh after sigh is gonna pass by and by  
Ah loves gonna fly on the wind  
When I gaze into your brown eyes again  
  
All the things Ive seen  
And the places that Ive been  
Dont mean a thing since I found you  
All that matters now  
Since Ive won your love somehow  
Are these plans I keep makin  
Not to lose you  
  
So sleep till the moon slips away  
Im hopin all youre dreamin comes true  
When you rise with the day  
I might not have too much to say  
But you know that doesnt mean  
That I dont love you  
Ah you know that doesnt mean  
That I dont love you  
  
All the things Ive seen  
And the places that Ive been  
Dont mean a thing since I found you  
All that matters now  
Since Ive won your love somehow  
Are these plans I keep makin  
Not to lose you  
  
Dreams that have flown down the hall  
Tears that were sown on despair  
Summers turned fall  
It dont matter at all  
When I wake and find you lying there  
Sweet silence and soft auburn hair  
Sweet silence and soft auburn hair
