Boys and girls come out to play playing till theyre old and grey  
Time to leave the old school suit grown ups can be real cute  
Do you think theyre wiser than in the past  
How long do you think its gonna last  
I dont have to prove to you adults can be kidding too  
  
Boys and girls I love you dearly  
But I hate to have you near me  
Boys and girls ahh  
Boys and girls ahh  
Boys and girls ahh  
  
Boys and girls stay home today  
Think theyre more mature that way  
Secret friends can soon be found  
Indiscretions underground  
Maybe growing up can seem more graceful  
If they make their style become more tasteful  
With your looks you could go far  
But better watch the calendar  
  
The Sound Of A Church Wedding  
  
Boys and girls I love you dearly  
But I hate to have you near me  
Boys and girls ahh  
Boys and girls ahh  
Boys and girls ahh  
  
Boys and girls I love you dearly  
But I hate to have you near me  
  
Boys and girls I love you dearly  
But I hate to have you near me  
Boys and girls ahh  
Boys and girls ahh  
Boys and girls ahh
