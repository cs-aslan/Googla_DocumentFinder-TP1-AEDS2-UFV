Play me a dancer a holderhander or honkytonker  
Pullherupcloser slow romancer  
Make her fall in love with me song  
  
The room is swimmin with pretty women  
But hows a fella supposed to get close to em  
The band is rockin the joint is jumpin  
Mr guitar man let me tell you somethin

I see a redhead I see a brunette  
And theres a blonde I love I dont even know yet  
Im going crazy you got to save me  
I need a hugger and I dont mean maybe
