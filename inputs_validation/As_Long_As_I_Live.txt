Ill love you dear as long as I live  
  
It was easy said the night we parted  
That wed forget wed ever met  
I havent forgotten I wonder if you have  
Or if your heart is full of regret  
  
As long as I live if it be one hour  
Or if it be one hundred years  
Ill keep remembering forever and ever  
Ill love you dear as long as I live  
  
Oh I never thought that night we parted  
That life alone would be oh so bad  
I know it sounds funny but I cant forget you  
Youre the only joy that Ive ever had  
  
As long as I live if it be one hour  
Or if it be one hundred years  
Ill keep remembering forever and ever  
Ill love you dear as long as I live  
  
Ill love you dear as long as I live
