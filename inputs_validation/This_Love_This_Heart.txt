This love this heart these arms to hold  
So tight to you I wont let go  
Can this be real or just some dream that feels so true  
I wish you love I wish you more  
You are all that I live for  
Ill never hurt you believe me  
My heart beats just for you  
It only beats for you  
  
Ill keep the fire alight for you  
Cant think of nothing else what can I do  
This lonely heart of mine it only beats for you  
It only beats for you  
  
You bring me peace you make me smile  
You give me strength and all the while  
You ask for nothing only love  
And my heart beats just for you  
It only beats for you  
  
Id say all these things to you  
If you were here but thats not gonna be  
Cos you re not here at all  
Theres only me  
But I wont stop trying  
  
I wont give up Ill wait for you  
Til you come back its all I can do  
Ill be right here Im going nowhere without you  
Give me the chance just make the call  
Just say the words Im waiting for  
Just let this heart of mine show you  
It only beats for you  
  
Yes it only beats for you  
It only beats for you  
This love this heart  
These arms theyre only for you  
This love this heart  
These arms theyre only for you  
Theyre only for you
