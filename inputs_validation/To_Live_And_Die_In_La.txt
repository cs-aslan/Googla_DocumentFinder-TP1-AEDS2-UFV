In the heat of the day  
Every time you go away  
I have to piece my life together  
Every time youre away  
In the heat of the day  
In the dark of the night  
Every time I turn the light  
I feel that God is not in heaven  
In the dark of the night  
The dark of the night  
  
I wonder why I live alone here  
I wonder why we spend these nights together  
Is this the room Ill live my life forever  
I wonder why in LA  
To live and die in LA  
  
I wonder why we waste our lives here  
When we could run away to paradise  
But I am held in some invisible vice  
And I cant get away  
To live and die in LA  
  
If I let myself go  
And for where I just dont know  
Id maybe hit some cold new river  
That led out to the sea  
An unknown sea  
Id either swim or Id drown  
Or just keep falling down and down  
I think its that that makes me quiver  
Just to keep falling down  
Down down down  
  
I wonder why I live alone here  
I wonder why we spend these nights together  
Is this the way Ill live my life forever  
I wonder why in LA  
To live and die in LA  
  
In every word that you say  
I feel my freedom slip away  
I feel the bars come down around me  
And I cant get away  
I cant get away  
  
I wonder why I live alone here  
I wonder why we spend these nights together  
Is this the room Ill live my life forever  
I wonder why in LA  
To live and die in LA  
I wonder why we waste our lives here  
When we could run away to paradise  
But I am held in some invisible vice  
And I cant get away  
To live and die in LA  
  
I cant get away  
To live and die in LA  
I cant get away  
To live and die in LA  
I cant get away  
To live and die in LA  
I cant get away  
To live and die in LA
