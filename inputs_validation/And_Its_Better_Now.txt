Riding along on the words of a song in my head  
Thinking all day of the thoughts in my mind never said  
I have needed a friend over and over again  
Everyone sings of a God they have known  
Now I have a God of my own  
  
And its better now been a long long time  
And its better now that the words can rhyme  
  
Gotta have something to sing about everyone must have a song  
Now I got something to sing about everyones singing my song  
Gotta have something to sing about everyone must have a song  
Now I got something to sing about everyones singing my song  
  
Dreaming away never wishing to be anyone  
Never a question or reason to find right or wrong  
When I looked at the end over and over again  
Riding along on the words of a song  
Thinking my time had all gone  
  
And its better now been a long long time  
And its better now that the words can rhyme  
  
Gotta have something to sing about everyone must have a song  
Now I got something to sing about everyones singing my song  
Gotta have something to sing about everyone must have a song  
Now I got something to sing about everyones singing my song
