Bright lights Houston is hot tonight  
Arabian sheiks and money up in the sky  
Now I dont mind a bloodbath when Ive got oil on my breath  
unknown eye to eye Houston is hot tonight  
  
My brain is tired of the wind  
Chicago winters just do me in  
Theyve got a moon man on the telephone  
Project hey Houston control  
  
unknown eye to eye Houston  
Its like whats happening  
  
Houston is hot tonight  
Houston is hot tonight  
Houston is hot tonight  
Houston is hot tonight  
Houston is hot tonight  
Houston is hot tonight  
Houston is hot tonight
