I am not the kind of girl  
Who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion  
But you are not the kind of boy  
Who should be marryin the wrong girl  
  
I sneak in and see your friends  
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel  
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid  
Somewhere back inside a room  
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry  
This is surely not what you thought it would be  
I lose myself in a daydream  
Where I stand and say  
  
Dont say yes run away now  
Ill meet you when youre out  
Of the church at the back door  
Dont wait or say a single vow  
You need to hear me out  
And they said Speak now  
  
Fond gestures are exchanged  
And the organ starts to play  
A song that sounds like a death march  
And I am hiding in the curtains  
It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bridetobe  
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen  
But I know you wish it was me  
You wish it was me dont you  
  
Dont say yes run away now  
Ill meet you when youre out  
Of the church at the back door  
Dont wait or say a single vow  
You need to hear me out  
And they said Speak now  
  
Dont say yes run away now  
Ill meet you when youre out  
Of the church at the back door  
Dont wait or say a single vow  
Your time is running out  
And they said Speak now  
  
I hear the preacher say  
Speak now or forever hold your peace  
Theres a silence theres my last chance  
I stand up with shaking hands  
All eyes on me  
Horrified looks from everyone in the room  
But Im only lookin at you  
  
I am not the kind of girl  
Who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion  
But you are not the kind of boy  
Who should be marryin the wrong girl  
  
Dont say yes run away now  
Ill meet you when youre out  
Of the church at the back door  
Dont wait or say a single vow  
You need to hear me out  
And they said Speak now  
  
And you say Lets run away now  
Ill meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door  
Oh baby I didnt say my vow  
So glad you were around when they said Speak now
