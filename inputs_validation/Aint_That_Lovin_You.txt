You dont know me baby  
Like I know myself  
I just want to love you baby  
But you leave me on the shelf  
  
Chorus  
Aint that lovin you baby  
Aint that lovin you baby  
Aint that lovin you baby  
But you dont even know my name  
  
Let me tell you something  
I swear to God its true  
If you give your love to me  
Im gonna give it all to you you know its true  
  
Chorus  
  
They may kill me baby  
And bury me like they do  
My body will lie but my spirits gonna find  
Only you  
  
Chorus
