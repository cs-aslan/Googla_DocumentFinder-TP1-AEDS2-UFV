This ones from the hip  
Oh mother you have sorely misjudged me  
It should have been whipped  
Out of me  
Without a father figured I  
Yeah I concluded then that Im  
Not for spitting on  
This ones from the hip  
My love I should have warned you about me  
It never got whipped  
Out of me  
Me and my modesty and  
Mother your wretched son wont  
Take his medicine  
Not I  
I dont care anymore  
Im sick and Im tired  
And I dont care anymore  
This ones from the hip  
Why should I know why  
Its a wicked world  
Ive had it up to here  
Sweet jesus I should have warned you about me  
Its sure to end in tears  
And misery  
Without a father figured I  
Yeh I concluded then that Im  
Not for spitting on  
Not I  
Why should I know why should I care  
Whos telling me what I should wear  
Mother your wretched son is hooked on his medicine  
I dont care anymore  
Im sick and Im tired  
And I dont care anymore  
This ones from the hip  
Why should I know why  
Its a wicked world
