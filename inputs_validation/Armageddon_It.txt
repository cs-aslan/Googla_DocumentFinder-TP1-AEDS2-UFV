Ya better come inside when youre ready to  
But no chance if ya dont want to dance  
Youre like four letter words when youre ready to  
But then you wont cause you know that you can

But then your finger wont trigger the gun

You try comin on when you need some  
But then you dont cause you already did  
Yeah you jangle your jewels while your shakin ya  
And drive the pretty boys outta their heads  
You got it but are you gettin it  
You flash you bedroom eyes like a jumpin jack  
Then play it pretty with a pat on the back  
You know you ya cant stop it  
So dont rock it
