We live in every moment but this one  
Why dont we recognize the faces loving us so  
  
Whats God if not the spark that started my life  
Smile of a stranger  
Sweet music starry skies  
Wonder mystery wherever my road goes  
Early wakeups in a moving home  
Scent of freshmown grass in the morningsun  
Open theme park gates waiting for  
  
Riding the day every day into sunset  
Finding the way back home  
  
Once upon a night well wake to the carnival of life  
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high  
Its hard to light a candle easy to curse the dark instead  
This moment the dawn of humanity  
The last ride of the day  
  
Wake up Dead Boy  
Enter adventureland  
Tricksters magicians will show you all thats real  
Careless jugglers snake charmers by your trail  
Magic of a moment  
Abracadabra
