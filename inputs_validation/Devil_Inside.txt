Everybody wants me to be their angel  
Everybody wants something they can cradle  
  
They dont know I burn  
They dont know I burn  
They dont know I burn  
  
Maybe theres a devil or something like it inside of me  
Devil or something like it inside  
Maybe theres a devil somewhere really deep inside me  
Devil inside of me  
Jealous angel deep inside me  
  
You dont know cause youre too busy reading labels  
Youre missing all the action underneath my table  
Im waiting for my turn  
Waiting for my turn  
Just waiting for my turn  
Just waiting for my turn  
  
Maybe theres a devil or something like it inside of me  
Devil or something like it inside  
Maybe theres a devil somewhere really deep inside me  
Devil inside of me  
Jealous angel deep inside me  
  
Time to make it burn  
This is how I burn  
  
Maybe theres a devil or something like it inside of me  
Devil or something like it inside  
Maybe theres a devil somewhere really deep inside me  
Devil inside of me  
Jealous angel deep inside me
