I waited too long and now were apart  
I never told you what I feel in my heart  
Somebody new has come along  
I was a fool for waiting too long  
My life without you wont be the same  
I should have never played that waiting game  
Im so alone now that youre gone  
I was a fool for waiting too long  
  
I wasnt smart I wasnt wise  
And now Im by myself with tears in my eyes  
  
I made my life a life of regret  
I should have never played hard to get  
And now I know I was so wrong  
I was a fool for waiting too long  
I was a fool for waiting too long  
Too long
