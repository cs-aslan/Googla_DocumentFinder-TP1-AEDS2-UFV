Everybodys got to pay  
But some dont know how to handle it  
Always reaching out in vain  
Just taking the things not worth having  
  
Chorus  
Dont you worry bout a thing x2  
Mama  
Cause Ill be standing on the side when you check it out  
  
You say your style of lifes a drag  
And that you must go other places  
But just dont you feel too bad  
When you get fooled by smiling faces  
  
Chorus  
Dont you worry bout a thing x2  
Mama  
Cause Ill be standing on the side when you check it
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooout  
When you get oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooofffff your trip  
  
Dont you worry bout a thing x2  
  
Dont you worry bout it  
  
scatting  
  
Dont you worry bout a thing x2  
Mama  
Cause Ill be standing on the side when you check it out  
When you get off your trip  
  
Everybody needs a change  
A chance to check out the new  
But youre the only one to see  
The changes you take yourself through  
  
Chorus  
Dont you worry bout a thing x2  
Pretty Mama  
Cause Ill be standing on the sides when you check it out  
  
Dont you worry bout a thaaaaaaang x4  
  
Dont you worry bout it  
  
scatting  
  
Dontcha worry bout a thang repeat  
Dont worry x5
