Verse 1  
Been a minute since weve slept together  
Gotta get myself together  
Ive been thinkin about everything  
I dont know if its because Im lonely  
Lonely on a Wednesday night  
Girl Im lonely  
Ill admit it if you just keep quiet  
Girl Im lonely  
That shit aint my fault girl  
Cause Im lonely  
Name another woman aint no other woman who should come for me  
When Im lonely  
Mix the Remy little bit of Henny  
Im running on empty Im lonely  
When Im lonely when Im lonely  
  
Verse 2  
Heard you spend your summers in Miami  
At somebodys house  
That you didnt buy  
Youre young so have fun girl  
I hope its worth it  
Cause fuck it Im not here to judge  
Fuck it Im not here to love  
Everything you did to ball  
Fuck it Im just glad that you called  
Ring ring ring what a thing  
Ring ring ring school bell ring  
You and I got options there  
Name another woman  
Aint no other woman that should come for me when Im lonely  
When Im lonely  
Mix the Remy with a little bit of Henny  
Im running on empty Im lonely  
When Im lonely when Im lonely  
This shit aint my fault
