Why do I choose the things I choose  
Why do I always find some lame excuse  
Why do I not realize what I could do  
Oh I wish I knew the reason why  
  
Why do you get that sad look on your face  
Why do you pull away from my embrace  
Why do you see all my faults and my mistakes  
Oh I wish you knew the reason why  
  
Why do we treat each other like we do  
Its like we never even try  
Why cant we get back to the love we knew  
Oh why oh baby why  
  
Why do we have to play those same old games  
Why do we run away from whos to blame  
Cant they see to lose this love would be ashame  
Oh I wish we knew the reason why  
Oh I wish we knew the reason why
