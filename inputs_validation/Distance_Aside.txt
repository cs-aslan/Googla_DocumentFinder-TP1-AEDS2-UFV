Lost in your eyes cant you find  
My intent to leave  
Taken to me dont you see  
Its time for me to leave  
  
Distance aside I realize  
How you make me feel  
Just call my name we live the day  
To find somewhere to heal  
  
I can see far away  
Feeling me forever  
I can see far away  
Looking back keeping us apart  
  
Theres no one who knows me Theres no one who cares  
Theres no one  
I sit and stare It follows me  
Wasting all our fears  
  
I can see far away  
Feeling me forever  
I can see far away  
Looking back keeping us apart  
  
guitar solo  
  
Looking to me will get you nowhere fast  
I hope you see what you have done to me  
Your pain is near you run again  
I try to save you all your style  
  
I can see far away  
Feeling me forever  
I can see far away  
Looking back keeping us  
  
I can see far away I dont know who you are  
Feeling me forever  
I can see far away I dont know who you are anymore  
Looking back keeping us apart  
  
Ahhhhhhhhhh I dont know who you are  
Ahhhhhhhhhh I dont know who you are
