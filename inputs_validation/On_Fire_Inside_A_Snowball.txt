Whenever I look out french windows  
Its always snowing outside  
And feel your body relax on mine  
Giving me all the good lines  
Uhhuh  
All the good lines  
All the good lines  
Hot in the ice  
On fire inside  
A snowball  
Ah but shes wonderful  
Set in the snow  
Ah but shes wonderful  
Set in the snow  
Hot in the ice  
On fire inside  
A snowball  
Ah but shes wonderful  
Set in the snow  
Ah but shes wonderful  
Set in the snow  
A crystal layer of ice on our skin  
Very numb outside but warm within  
I bend to join our lips but its too cold  
To kiss and hit Is it you Im feeling  
Is it you Im feeling  
Yeah  
Is it you Im feeling  
Hot in the ice  
On fire inside  
A snowball  
Ah but shes wonderful  
Set in the snow  
Ah but shes wonderful  
Set in the snow  
Hot in the ice  
On fire inside  
A snowball  
Ah but shes wonderful  
Set in the snow  
Ah but shes wonderful  
Set in the snow
