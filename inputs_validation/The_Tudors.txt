Intro  
Anyone whose lived around these parts  
Or ever knewd us  
Is well aware that you should never mess with the Tudors  
  
Verse 1  
My Grandad Henry Seventh  
He beat King Richard  
Thats him pictured  
Defeating the Tyke  
  
Verse 2  
He liked his name so much that  
To keep alive is memory  
He called his own son Henry  
What was he like  
  
Verse 3  
Everyone said Henery the eighth was a baddy  
I have to agree  
Even though he was my daddy  
Just popping of to chop some wives  
  
Chorus  
Cos were Tudors  
Britains biggest feuders  
And just like barracudas  
We kill with methods foul  
  
Tudors  
Each enemy a Judas  
At least were not as rude as  
Simon Cowell  
  
Verse 4  
My reign was quite notorious  
I liked to hunt and slaughter  
But then you had a daughter  
Mary was her name  
It was a son I wanted  
So I divorced her mother  
Then wife two had another  
A girl Not again  
Thats me your talking about   
  
Chorus  
Tudor  
Superior to you duh  
Who followed me as ruler  
Best not to ask  
  
Verse 5  
It must have been my laddie  
Yes sicky little Eddie  
Was Ill and soon got deady  
And who came next  
  
Verse 6  
Your daughters then took over  
First came Bloody Mary  
My sisters rule was scary  
So all hail meeeeeee  
  
Chorus  
Tudors  
The history books reviewed us  
As nutters and big bruisers  
Who kill and cull  
  
Outro  
I never had an heir  
So our reign ended there  
We my not have been fair  
But we were never dull
