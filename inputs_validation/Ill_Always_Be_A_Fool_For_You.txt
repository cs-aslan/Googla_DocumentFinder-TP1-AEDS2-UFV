You change just like the weather I never know if youll be hot or cold to me  
Cant you see what Ive been going through  
We belong together even though I know at times it just cant be  
Honey cant you see Ill always be a fool for you  
Ill always be the first to say Im sorry Ill always be the last to say were
through  
Ill always be the one to take another chance  
In this romance Ill always be a fool for you  
  
Ill always be the first to say  
Ill always be a fool for you
