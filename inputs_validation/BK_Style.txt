Yea its bout to get real hard for these niggas to move man  
Somebody get these niggas some wheelchairs or somethin  
Goin to war is still a scary issue  
But in my hood they train to kill wit every pistol  
Like a military issue  
Guess you a star if you sell a million every disc two  
Catch a gun case an bounce still theyll barely frisk you  
cause I proved I move the retail  
Make the smoothest grooves wit female  
And I remove the rules on V12s  
You never aint never seen it move this smooth on Sprewells  
Im a hustler hes just a middle man to me  
The way I pass the rock could make Jason Kidd a fan of me  
Just cop one joint Im a one point somethin  
Still I had you at gunpoint with one joint dumpin  
So watch what you say to them crackers  
Ill put a couple gs on yer head like you play for the packers  
Im raps Labron James I quickly see baskets  
These scrubs wouldnt make it to the MickeyDs classics  
You got some sticky weed pass it  
If not put it out Im pushin it before they put it out  
Wit the dash wooded out Shaq ONeal footed out  
Blastin a dodidit first before they put it out clue  
Maybe wouldnt be a million kids wit they faces on containers  
If cops pursue the same way they chase us entertainers  
In the hood a few big faces and a chaina  
Get metal in ya mouth like braces and retainers  
Even the young bucks be scheming on somebody change  
Tryin a sell somebody cain before they even potty trained  
You can smooth talk your way into a hottie brain  
Have her suckin long enough to leave a nigga body drained  
I wasnt taught I learned from watchin stupid people  
Thatll run up shootin in front of a group of people  
I lay in a cut the same way the troopers peep you  
Ride up on yer Coupe creep you  
Why you let a groupie deep you  
cause even if you reppin like a man of steel  
You gon still need a weapon when you land a deal  
One for watch you slippin like you steppin on banana peels  
Think a nigga aint gon pull a weapon cause you scanned a mil  
I crept in and got handed meals  
Now the white and black rides look like salt pepper on a bannon grill  
Think I wouldnt hold a Pepsi in my hand for mils  
You must be fuckin stupid nigga  
Yeah  
Brooklyn stand the fucker  
Every project rebourse Kings Borough  
Push wig for grain  
Fill it in brown fill  
Lengston you LG  
Linda bandi steflo Brooklyn  
All believe Glym wall  
Abyss fill faragay  
Mossly  
Talkin stumlo Guonas  
Rosawell  
Im just the project nigga myself
