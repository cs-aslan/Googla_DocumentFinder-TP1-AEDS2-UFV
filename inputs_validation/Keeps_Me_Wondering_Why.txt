Sensations drift away  
When Im all alone  
How can you take away my feelings  
Bet our love until you lose  
Then give back what youve been stealing  
All these changes I go through  
Keeps me wondering why  
Im still loving you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
Temptation rips away  
Can this girl stay true  
I just keep hanging on  
Cause I know its hard to find the magic  
Thats in every part of you  
All the boys they got to have it  
All these changes I go through  
Keeps me wondering why  
Im still loving you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
Im still loving you  
Keeps me wondering  
Keeps me wondering  
Keeps me wondering  
Keeps me wondering why  
Im still loving you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
Im still in love with you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
You know Im still in love with you  
Keeps me wondering why  
All these things that you do  
Keeps me wondering why  
Im still in love with you
