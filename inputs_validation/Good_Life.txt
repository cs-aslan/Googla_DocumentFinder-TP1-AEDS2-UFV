Woke up in London yesterday  
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly  
Dont really know how I got here  
I got some pictures on my phone  
  
New names and numbers that I dont know  
Address to places like Abbey Road  
Day turns to night night turns to whatever we want  
Were young enough to say  
  
Chorus  
Oh this has gotta be the good life  
This has gotta be the good life  
This could really be a good life good life  
  
Say oh got this feeling that you cant fight  
Like this city is on fire tonight  
This could really be a good life  
A good good life  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
To my friends in New York I say hello  
My friends in LA they dont know  
Where Ive been for the past few years or so  
From Paris to China to Colorado  
  
Sometimes theres airplanes I cant jump out  
Sometimes theres bullshit that dont work now  
We all got our stories but please tell me  
What there is to complain about  
  
When youre happy like a fool  
Let it take you over  
When everything is out  
You gotta take it in  
  
Chorus  
  
Say oh got this feeling that you cant fight  
Like this city is on fire tonight  
This could really be a good life  
A good good life  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
A good good life  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Hopelessly  
I feel like like there might be something that Ill miss  
Hopelessly  
I feel like the window closes oh so quick  
Hopelessly  
Im taking a mental picture of you now  
Cause hopelessly  
The hope is we have so much to feel good about  
  
Chorus  
  
Say oh got this feeling that you cant fight  
Like this city is on fire tonight  
This could really be a good life oh yeah  
A good good life  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh yeah a good good life good life  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Whoah woah listen  
  
To my friends in New York I say hello  
My friends in LA they dont know  
Where Ive been for the past few years or so  
From Paris to China to Colorado  
  
Sometimes theres airplanes I cant jump out  
Sometimes theres bullshit that dont work now  
We all got our stories but please tell me  
What there is to complain about
