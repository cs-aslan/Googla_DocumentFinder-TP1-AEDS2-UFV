I wish I knew how  
It would feel to be free  
I wish I could break  
All the chains holding me  
I wish I could say  
All the things that Id like to say  
Say em loud say em clear  
For the whole round world to hear  
I wish I could share  
All the love thats in my heart  
Remove every doubt  
It keeps us apart  
And I wish you could know  
What it means to be me  
Then youd see and agree  
Every man should be free  
  
I wish I could live  
  
Like Im longin to live  
I wish I could give  
What Im longin to give  
And I wish I could do  
All the things Id like to do  
You know theyll still miss part of you  
Yes sir  
And Im way way over due  
  
I wish I could be like a bird up in the sky  
How sweet it would be  
If I found out I could fly  
So long to my song  
And look down upon the sea  
And I sing because I know  
I would see you  
I sing because I know  
I would see you  
And I sing because I know  
I would see you  
To be free yeah
