Im plowing through a crowd of worthless hatred  
Thats falling down at least they start to fry  
Why cant I be removed take their places  
Sometimes its better to eat their scars  
  
These are the times of the waking liar  
Hold him close or you will expire  
Holding on to the place youre thinking  
Total deceit  
  
I like to lose hope  
Recede and cope  
Like a beautiful rape  
These things arent they great  
  
Im terrified by emotionless faces  
Theyre all around me I want to die  
Im fucking trippin out seeing faces  
Of murderers covered in lye  
  
These are the times of the waking liar  
Hold him close or you will expire  
Holding on to the place youre thinking  
Total deceit  
  
I like to lose hope  
Recede and cope  
Like a beautiful rape  
These things arent they great  
  
I love the things that make you upset  
The more you hurt the stronger I get  
I love the things that make you upset  
The more you hurt the stronger I get  
  
I like to lose hope  
Recede and cope  
Like a beautiful rape  
These things arent they great  
Arent they great
