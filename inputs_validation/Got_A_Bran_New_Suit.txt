Got a bran new suit  
Got a bran new tie  
Got a bran new twinkle in my eye  
Do you know the reason why  
  
Got a bran new girl  
An I wont dispute  
Shes the reason why I got a bran new tie  
An a bran new suit  
  
When Im with her  
Gotta look my best  
Put on my tan shoes  
Gray spats double breasted vest  
  
Gonna wear my stickpin a Tecla Pearl  
With a bran new tie  
An a bran new suit  
A bran new girl
