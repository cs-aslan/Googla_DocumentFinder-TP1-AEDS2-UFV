Youre coming back into my life  
After all this time apart  
After my heart has been broken in two  
Now you want to turn around and go back through  
All the hurt all the pain  
Im not sure it could ever be the same  
  
Cause two rights cant make up for one wrong  
Ive spend so many nights alone  
One kiss cant make it disappear  
Even though youre here tonight  
Baby two rights cant make up for hurting someone  
  
I guess you think its all a game  
Someone gets hurt someone gets blamed  
You dont seem to realize  
Theres someone else  
In my eyes  
  
Cause two rights cant make up for one wrong  
Ive spend so many nights alone  
One kiss cant make it disappear  
Even though youre here tonight  
Baby two rights cant make up for hurting someone  
  
Youre the one who wanted to play the field  
Now you cant find a love thats real  
Its your game but its no fun  
When you end up the lonely one  
  
Cause two rights cant make up for one wrong  
Ive spend so many nights alone  
One kiss cant make it disappear  
Even though youre here tonight  
Baby two rights cant make up for hurting someone
