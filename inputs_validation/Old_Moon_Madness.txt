Late sometime before midnight  
He comes creeping up  
And before you get him sussed  
Hes gone before dusk  
  
And when you arise  
Red ruby rings circle your eyes  
If its later than you realized  
Check with the stars and the skies  
  
Old moon madness has struck again  
  
A howl in the dark light  
A flash of teeth bright white  
A scream and a bite  
Old moon madness has struck again tonight  
  
But theres no need to worry  
For the crimes that youve done  
Worse has been committed  
With no moon madness to blame it on  
  
Old moon madness has struck again  
  
In fact you could say youre lucky  
You and me  
Mother Earth has only one moon  
And not three
