Heres a tear for a souvenir  
And a dream thats torn at the seams  
Heres a promise you made to me  
Of the tomorrow Ill never see  
And then youre free to go  
  
But I cant give back the love  
I feel for you  
Im gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do  
  
Take these arms that held you close  
I thought I was the one you needed the most  
Take these hands theyre no good to me  
That used to touch you so tenderly  
  
But I cant give back the love  
Thats a part of me  
If you want just a little bit  
You have to take all of me  
  
Heres a ring  
That didnt mean a thing  
And the letters you wrote  
That gave my young heart hope  
Take the pillow where my dreams were made  
And the mind where the thought of you stayed  
But baby you should know  
  
That I cant give back the love  
I feel for you  
Im gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do  
  
Take these eyes that once could see  
Now reflections of a misery  
The hapiness I thought would last  
Now a becoming just a thing of the past  
  
But I cant give back the love  
Thats a part of me  
If you want just a little bit  
You have to take all of me  
  
No I cant give back  
No I feel for you  
Oh Im gonna be stuck  
No matter what I do  
Cause itll grow til the world  
Dont go round no more  
  
But I cant give back the love  
I feel for you  
Im gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do  
  
But I cant give back the love  
I feel for you  
Im gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do  
  
But I cant give back the love  
I feel for you  
Im gonna be stuck with it  
No matter what I do
