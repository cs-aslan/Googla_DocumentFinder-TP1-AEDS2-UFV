Its been so long  
Since Ive seen her face  
You say shes doin fine  
I still recall  
A sad cafe  
  
How it hurt so bad to see her cry  
I didnt want to say goodbye  
  
Chorus  
Send her my love memories remain  
Send her my love roses never fade  
Send her my love  
  
The same hotel the same old room  
Im on the road again  
She needed so much more  
Than I could give  
  
We knew our love could not pretend  
Broken hearts can always mend  
  
Chorus  
  
Callin out your name Im dreamin  
Reflections of a face Im seein  
Its her voice  
That keeps on haunting me  
  
Send her send her my love  
Roses never fade  
Memories remain  
Send her send her my love
