Thats the sound of the men  
They are working on the chain gang  
Thats the sound of the men  
They are working on the chain gang  
Thats the sound of the men  
They are working on the chain gang  
  
All day long they work so hard  
Till the suns comin down  
Workin on the highways and biways  
And wearin a frown  
  
I hear them moanin their lives away  
And then you hear somebody say  
  
Chorus  
  
Hear someone sayin  
Whoa I work work so hard  
See my woman who I love so dear  
But I Ive got to work right here  
  
Chorus  
  
My my my my I work so hard  
Give me water Im thirsty  
Whoa I I work so hard  
  
You hear them moanin their lives away  
And then you hear somebody say  
  
Chorus x2
