Im a fool to care  
When you treat me this way  
Whoa I love you so  
But darling I know  
Im a fool to care  
  
Im a fool to cry  
Since you told me goodbye  
Oh you cant be true  
So what can I do  
Im a fool to care  
Im a fool to care  
  
I know I should laugh ha ha  
And call it a day  
But I know I would cry  
If you went away  
  
Im a fool to care  
When you dont care for me  
Why should I pretend  
I know Ill lose in the end  
Im a fool to care  
  
I know I should laugh  
And call it a day  
But I know I would cry  
If you went away  
  
Im a fool to care  
When you dont care for me  
So why should I pretend  
Ill lose in the end  
Oh Im a fool to care
