The song is over  
Its all behind me  
I should have known it  
She tried to find me  
  
Our love is over  
Theyre all ahead now  
Ive got to learn it  
Im gonna to sing out  
  
Chorus  
Ill sing my song to the wide open spaces  
Ill sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
Ill sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
Ill sing my song to the free to the free  
Ill sing my song to the wide open spaces  
Ill sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
Ill sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
Ill sing my song to the free to the free  
  
When I walked in through the door  
Thought it was me I was looking for  
She was the first song I ever sang  
But it stopped as soon as it began  
  
Our love is over  
Its all behind me  
Theyre all ahead now  
Cant hope to find me  
  
Ill sing my song to the wide open spaces  
Ill sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
Ill sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
Ill sing my song to the free to the free  
Ill sing my song to the wide open spaces  
Ill sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
Ill sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
Ill sing my song to the free to the free  
  
This song is over  
Im left with only tears  
I must remember  
Even if it takes a million years  
  
The song is over  
The song is over  
  
Searchin for a note pure and easy  
Playing so free like a breath rippling by
