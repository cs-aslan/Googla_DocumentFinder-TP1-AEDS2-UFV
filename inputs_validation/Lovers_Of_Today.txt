I tried to talk to my baby  
I said no no no no baby  
Please dont cry  
No no no baby please  
Cause all of the leaves come down  
Every time babies cry  
All of the leaves come down  
  
I put my arms around my baby  
I said hush hush hush hush  
Baby sleep tight now  
Hush hush hush baby sleep  
Cause all of the birds start to sing  
Every time babies dream  
All of the birds start to sing  
  
Nobody wants to see  
Lovers of today happy  
So assumed theyre going to part  
Nobody wants to be with someone  
So afraid theyll be left with  
A broken heart  
  
I kissed the eyes of my baby  
I said dream dream dream dream  
Baby all night long  
Dream dream dream all the night  
Cause all of the stars in the skies  
Twinkle on babys eyes  
All of the stars in the skies  
  
I tried to talk to you baby  
No no  
No Ill never feel  
Like a man in a mans world
