It brings a tear  
Into my eyes  
When I begin  
To realize  
Ive cried so much  
Since youve been gone  
I guess Im drowning in my own tears  
  
I sit and cry  
Just like a child  
My pouring tears  
Are runnin wild  
If you dont think  
Youll be home soon  
I guess Ill drown in my own tears  
  
I know its true  
Into each life  
Some rain rain must pour  
Im so blue  
Here without you  
It keeps raining  
More and more  
  
Why dont you  
Come on home  
Oh yes so I wont  
Be all alone  
If you dont think  
Youll be home soon  
  
I guess Ill  
Drown in my own tears  
Ooh dont let me  
Drown in my own tears  
When Im in trouble baby  
Drown in my own tears  
Oh yeah baby dont let me  
Drown in my own tears  
I guess Ill drown in my own tears  
Oh mmmmm
