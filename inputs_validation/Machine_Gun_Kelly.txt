Ill tell you about Machine Gun Kelly  
He rode along the outlaw trail  
Machine Gun Kelly was a simple man  
But the woman was as hard as hell  
Watch out Machine Gun  
Dont let her run you round  
Dont let the woman put you six feet  
In the ground Machine Gun  
  
Ill tell you about Katherine Kelly  
Tired of being such small time now  
Figured theyd kidnap a rich mans son  
Make it in the world of crime  
Watch out Machine Gun  
Dont let her run you round  
Dont let the woman put you six feet  
In the ground Machine Gun  
  
Youd better watch out Machine Gun Kelly  
Careful of what you do now  
If you keep listening to your old lady  
Aint no telling  
Whatll happen to you now Machine Gun  
  
The government boys they came  
For Machine Gun took the poor boy away  
Stuck him in a hole in Leavenworth prison  
Where he lived until his dying day  
  
Watch out Machine Gun  
Dont let her put you down  
Dont let a woman make you  
Out to be a clown Machine Gun  
Watch out Machine Gun
