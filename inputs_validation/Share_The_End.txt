Here come the priests each one wailing and bemoaning  
Lordy they got their heads bowed down  
Here come the madmen theyre too excited for atoning  
Burn the mosque theyre shouting Burn it down  
  
Save me a place surround me with friendly faces  
All of us have gathered here to share the end  
To watch the world go up in flames  
  
Please Lord were not ready  
Give us a day  
Give us an hour  
  
Here come the kings Lets dispense with their apologizing  
Just bring on the acrobats and clowns  
Here comes the rumble Hang on for universal dying  
Please ignore the baying of the hounds  
  
Save me a place surround me with deadly faces  
All of us have gathered here to share the end   
To watch the world go up in flames  
  
Please Lord were not ready  
Give us some time to work things out  
Please Lord were not ready  
Give us a day  
Give us an hour  
Please Lord were not ready  
Give us some time to work things out  
Please Lord were not ready  
Give us a day  
Give us an hour
