Im walking the line  
Im walking the line  
Treading thin ice  
Time after time  
  
I go for the best end up with much less  
I need the real thing  
Forget all the rest  
  
Started out good  
Working out bad  
All the sweet love turner  
Sour and sad  
  
A face and name  
Its always the same  
So tired of playing loves foolish games  
Tell me why  
Love passes me by  
  
Chorus  
Cold love cold love  
Another shot of rock n roll love  
Cold love cold love  
Whatever happened to that  
Good old love  
Tell me why tell me why tell me why  
Tell me why tell me why  
  
Hope in the dark love in the light  
Ill keep on looking for someone  
Whos right  
  
Im out for the best  
Can you stand the test  
I need the real thing  
No more and no less  
Tell me why  
Love passes me by  
  
Chorus
