Somewhere in time we were born  
And brought blood lust hatred and scorn  
Your sorry now you trusted me  
Now I command that you get down on your knees  
For  
  
Hell the deceiver  
Satans child  
Your a believer  
And were going wild  
  
Put away all your virtues  
Stop your climbing the walls  
Just sign your name on the paper  
Well have ourselves a ball  
  
Was it the battle of envy  
You were so mighty and brave  
But your foolish compulsions  
Sent you to the grave  
  
Hell has deceived you  
You were so blind  
Just like all mortals  
Youll loose your mind  
  
Hell has deceived you  
You were so blind  
Join venoms legions  
Cause were going wild
