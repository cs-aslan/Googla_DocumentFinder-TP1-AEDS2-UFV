There have been hard times all around me  
I just cant seem to see the light of day  
I need one chance to get away  
Before the darkness falls upon me  
  
I need someone to comfort me  
When I cant deal with the pain  
Somebody to stand by me  
  
I need one woman  
With the same soul as my own  
I need one woman  
We can find our way back home  
  
If I lose my mind who will find it  
If I draw a line Im gonna cross it today  
There must be one place my spirits free  
If my soul could only find it  
  
Im alone in a cold dark place  
But theres light on the other side  
Just wait till I get my self free Ill find me  
  
One woman  
With the same soul as my own  
I need one woman  
No I cant do this alone  
  
I need one woman  
With the same soul as my own  
Give me one woman  
We can find our way back home  
  
Turn around  
Take a step and turn around  
Turn around  
Move ahead and turn around  
  
Its never too late to turn around  
Dont want to wait no longer for
