Looking back upon my life  
And the places that Ive been  
Pictures faces girls Ive loved  
I try to remember when  
Faded memories on the wall  
Some names I have forgotten  
But each one is a memory I  
Look back on so often  
  
Chorus x2  
I look into the past  
I want to make it last  
I was there  
  
Looking back what I have done  
Theres lots more life to live  
At times I feel overwhelmed  
I question what I can give  
But I dont let it get me down  
Or cause me too much sorrow  
Theres no doubt about who I am  
I always have tomorrow  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Looking back upon my life  
Faded memories on the wall  
Looking now at who I am  
I dont let it get me down  
  
Looking back upon my life  
And the places that Ive been  
Pictures faces girls Ive loved  
I try to remember when  
But I dont let it get me down  
Or cause me too much sorrow  
Theres no doubt about who I am  
I always have tomorrow  
  
Chorus x2
