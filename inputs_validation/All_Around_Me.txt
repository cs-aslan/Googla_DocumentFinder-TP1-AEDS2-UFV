Well you know every time I look at that expression printed on the page I think
I hear you  
Whispering the magic and the compliments I need so badly  
So baby come on yeah so baby come on  
Now Ive been running circles around the notion that youd find me baby One
day maybe  
But all the physic powers of suggestion Ive been sending your way  
  
So cant you hear me say  
I want your arms all around me  
I want your face yeah all around me  
I want your perfume all around me  
I like the way you move  
And do the funky groove  
  
All around me I want you  
All around me I need you  
All around me I want you  
All around me  
  
So cant you hear me say  
I want your arms all around me  
I want your face yeah all around me  
I want your perfume all around me  
I like the way you move  
And do the funky groove  
  
Like cold chardonnay chilled for a day  
Your smooth and crisp and on display  
Like Cartier Armani like TAG Gucci Versace  
In the middle of the night youre a kiss so long  
Youre the only good thing when all is wrong  
Youre a magic time reversal clock  
Youre the fries on the side with a cherry on top  
Youre sleek velvet gold lame patent leather enchante  
Youre a legend youre a glamor queen  
God Im running out of words but you know what I mean  
  
All around me I want you  
All around me I need you  
All around me I want you  
  
So cant you hear me say  
I want your arms all around me  
I want your face yeah all around me  
I want your perfume all around me  
I like the way you move and do the funky groove  
  
So slide into your Jaguar or Porsche baby there you are  
Well chop chop darling au revoir  
Pick up your things youre a star
