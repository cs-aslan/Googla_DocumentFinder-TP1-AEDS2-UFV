Oh she is hot shes hot shes hot  
Shes just a wild and wicked slut  
And she lives inside my head and stops me sleeping  
And when I think shes finally gone  
Some guy arrives and turns her on  
Then she parties until dawn  
This cant go on Celestine  
Get out my dreams  
Youre killing me so slowly  
So many men so many fights  
So many parties and late nights  
She plumbs the depths and hits the heights  
That Celestine  
She pretends that she cant hear me  
She pretends shes nowhere near me  
She just goes quiet and pretends  
That shes not in  
But Celestine I know youre there  
In your exotic underwear  
And you are fixing up your hair now Celestine  
Celestine  
Get out my dreams  
Youre killing me so slowly  
My lover looked into my eyes  
And I could tell by his surprise  
It was not me he saw in there but Celestine  
And now its her that he lusts after  
I can hear that wicked laughter  
Still he comes to me but I know where hes been  
Celestine  
Get out my dreams  
Youre killing me so slowly  
Celestine  
Get out my dreams  
Youre killing me so slowly  
My lover hasnt got a clue  
He doesnt know that hes untrue  
And its not me he makes love to but Celestine  
Oh yes shes hot shes hot shes hot  
I guess shes everything Im not  
And she lives inside my head and stops me sleeping
