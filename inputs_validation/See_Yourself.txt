Its easier to tell a lie than it is to tell the truth  
Its easier to kill a fly than it is to turn it loose  
Its easier to criticize somebody else  
Than to see yourself  
  
Its easier to give a sigh and be like all the rest  
Who stand around and crucify you while you do your best  
Its easier to see the books upon the shelf  
Than to see yourself  
  
Its easier to hurt someone and make them cry  
Than it is to dry their eyes  
I got tired of fooling around with other peoples lies  
Rather Id find someone thats true  
  
Its easier to say you wont than it is to feel you can  
Its easier to drag your feet than it is to be a man  
Its easier to look at someone eless wealth  
Than to see yourself
