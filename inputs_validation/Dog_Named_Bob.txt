I once had a dog named Bob  
And Bobs a funny name for a dog  
If youre gonna get a dog dont name him Bob  
My neighbours name is also Bob  
And every time I call my dog  
My neighbour Bob shows up without my dog  
  
Hey Bob not you Bob  
Im looking for my dog  
Have you seen my dog named Bob  
My dog named Bob  
  
Bob the dog drank antifreeze  
I got a new dog named Jeez  
So I could yell Oh Jeez just when I please  
And when Jehovahs Witnesses  
  
Come to my house in Saturdays  
I ask them if theyd like to witness Jeez  
Holy Jeez they fell on their knees  
They beg me Please can we meet Jeez pretty please  
Oh Holy Jeez  
  
Well those Jehovahs Witnesses  
Called the Humane Society  
They took my Jeez away from me  
And then the Catholic diosces  
Made a big deal out of Jeez  
And now I have to pay to go see Jeez  
  
Hey Jeez remember me  
Remember the beach and playing Frisbee with me  
For the love of Jeez
