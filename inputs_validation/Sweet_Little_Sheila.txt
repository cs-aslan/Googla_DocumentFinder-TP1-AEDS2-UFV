So sad  
Watch good love go bad  
Smoke from a distance  
Fire burning me  
Oh babe the heaven cant wait  
I need these hints  
Im feeling my heart is appealing  
  
Sweet lady sheila  
Do you Do you really want me  
Sophisticated lady want me  
Sweet little Sheila  
Do you Do you really love me  
Shes a different baby to me  
  
I only want Sheila  
Oh my Sheila  
Oh shes precious  
Like the sun  
I only want Sheila  
Oh my Sheila  
Oh shes foolish  
And most fun  
  
Oh babe  
For the promise you made  
Be careful theyve got storms youre afraid  
Oh babe  
Dont say its too late  
Words cant express my feelings being  
Believing
