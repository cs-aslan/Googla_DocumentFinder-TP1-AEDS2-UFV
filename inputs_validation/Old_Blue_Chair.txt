Theres a blue rocking chair  
Sittin in the sand  
Weathered by the storms and well oiled hands  
It sways back and forth with the help of the winds  
Seems to always be therelike an old trusted friend  
  
Ive read a lot of books  
Wrote a few songs  
Looked at my life where its goin where its gone  
Ive seen the world through a bus windshield but nothing compares  
To the way that I see it  
To the way that I see it  
To the way that I see it when I sit in that old blue chair  
  
From that chair Ive caught a few fish and some rays  
And Ive watched boats sail in and out of cinnamon bay  
I let go of a lover that took a piece of my heart  
I prayed many times for forgiveness and a brand new start  
  
Ive read a lot of books  
Wrote a few songs  
Looked at my life where its goinwhere its gone  
Ive seen the world through a bus windshield but nothing compares  
To the way that I see it to the way that I see it  
To the way that I see it when I sit in  
That old blue chair  
  
That chair was my bed one New Years Night  
When I passed out from too much Malibu and diet  
And woke up to a hundred mosquito bites  
I swear got em all sittin right there  
In that old blue chair  
  
Theres a blue rockin chair  
Sittin in the sand  
Weathered by the storms and well oiled hands
