Life is good looking through the eyes of love  
beautiful looking through the eyes of love  
  
But you know Im telling you girl  
life aint all the same  
Take a look take a look around you now  
Youll find that  
though it seems great life is just a crazy scene  
  
You and me seem to see right through a haze  
People laugh but we both know that it pays  
  
Chorus  
I want you to know how I feel  
When you go the world aint real  
I want you to know how I feel  
When you go the world aint real  
  
Its all balanced on the keen edge of a knife  
Lets all laugh at the craziness of life  
  
Chorus
