If you want it oooooo  
You can have it oooooo  
But you gotta learn to reach up there  
And grab it oooooo  
  
Cause everybody wants some love oh baby  
Shoot it from the stars above oh baby  
And though my heart would break  
Its more than I can take  
I can never get enough  
  
If you need it oooooo  
You should show it oooooo  
Cause at my place overnight  
Suggest you grow it oooooo  
  
Cause everybody wants some hope oh baby  
Something they can barely know oh baby  
And though my heart would break  
Its more than I could take  
I can never let it go  
  
Its in the photograph  
Its in the photograph  
Its in the photograph of love  
  
Cause everybody wants a dream oh baby  
Something they can barely see oh baby  
And though my heart would break  
Its more than I could take  
I could never let it be  
  
Its in the photograph  
Its in the photograph  
Its in the photograph of love  
  
If you blew it oooooo  
Dont reject it oooooo  
Just keep drawing up the plans and reerect it  
oooooo x 3
