You walked through the door  
Girl where were you  
You been here before  
Its nothing new  
Your wearing cologne  
Its not yours  
Who  
Are you spending time with  
I want the truth huh  
  
I got a question  
How many lies  
Question  
How many times  
Question  
Did you wanna lie  
  
Please forgive me if I cant forgive anymore  
I guess Im taking it personal  
Life without you is better than life before  
I guess Im taking it personal  
  
Listen  
Listen to my head  
Listen  
And not to my heart  
Listen  
Seems like the ends about to start  
Yeah  
You think your caught you but not anymore  
I guess Im taking it personal  
  
Where do I start  
Look at you now  
The lipstick you wear  
Not on your mouth  
The scent of your skin  
Is somewhere else  
I dont need to ask  
I cant help myself  
  
I got a question  
How many lies  
Question  
How many times  
Question  
Did you wanna lie  
  
Please forgive me if I cant forgive anymore  
I guess Im taking it personal  
Life without you is better than life before  
I guess Im taking it personal  
  
Listen  
Listen to my head  
Listen  
And not to my heart  
Listen  
Seems like the ends about to start  
Yeah  
You think your caught you but not anymore  
I guess Im taking it personal  
  
Cos this is what is  
This is where are  
Get back in your car  
And drive back to where you came from  
Theres nothing left to say  
Nothing left to do  
Im not gonna change  
Im not anyway no  
  
Listen  
Feel like the end has started  
And yknow what  
Funny Im not broken hearted  
  
I got a question  
How many lies  
Question  
How many times  
Question  
Did you wanna lie  
  
Please forgive me if I cant forgive anymore  
I guess Im taking it personal  
Life without you is better than life before  
I guess Im taking it personal  
  
Listen  
Listen to my head  
Listen  
And not to my heart  
Listen  
Seems like the ends about to start  
Yeah  
You think your caught you but not anymore  
I guess Im taking it personal
