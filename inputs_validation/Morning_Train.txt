I saw you all dolled up  
Singing a song in your pickup truck  
You put me on a morning train  
You put me on a morning train  
Aint no need to explain  
You put me on a morning train  
  
Hey hey Brother Ray  
Whatd you mean by whatd I say  
You put me on a morning train  
You put me on a morning train  
Aint no need to explain  
You put me on a morning train  
  
If its gonna rain and I wish that it would  
Just go ahead and rain get it over for good  
If theres really a hole in that big blue sky  
Then move it on over and let me by  
  
Constantinople is a mighty long word  
Got three more letters than mockingbird  
You put me on a morning train  
You put me on a morning train  
Aint no need to explain  
You put me on a morning train  
  
I like you with your makeup on  
All dolled up singing a song  
You put me on a morning train  
You put me on a morning train  
Aint no need to explain  
You put me on a morning train
