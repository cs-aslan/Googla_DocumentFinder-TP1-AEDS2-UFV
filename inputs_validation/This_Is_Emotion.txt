This is  
This is emotion calling  
Inside  
You dont love me  
One game  
A miracle of invention  
You lose  
These rules are mine  
Dirty pictures  
For real  
The movies  
Move in  
Move out  
Im in slow motion  
One love  
One tear  
One night  
Of fear  
One game  
You lose  
This is  
Emotion  
Look left  
Theres nothing over there but vengeance  
Look right  
Theres nothing over there but greed  
Look up  
Theres nothing up there but rumours  
Look down  
Theres nothing down there but me  
Dirty pictures  
For real  
The movies  
Move in  
Move out  
Im in slow motion  
One love  
One tear  
One night  
Of fear  
One game  
You lose  
This is  
Emotion  
Im listening to stories  
Of love and affection  
That I dont believe  
Im listening to liars  
With pretty young faces  
And eyes that deceive  
One love  
I dont want to talk about it  
One love  
More pain  
I dont want to think about it  
More pain  
Dirty pictures  
For real  
The movies  
Move in  
Move out  
Im in slow motion  
One love  
One tear  
One night  
Of fear  
One game  
You lose  
This is  
Emotion  
Dirty pictures  
For real  
The movies  
Move in  
Move out  
Im in slow motion  
One love  
One tear  
One night  
Of fear  
One game  
You lose  
This is  
Emotion  
  
Im listening to stories  
Of love and affection  
That I dont believe  
Im listening to liars  
With pretty young faces  
And eyes that deceive  
One more  
Another night to remember  
One more  
Another name to forget  
One more  
Another young heart to play with  
One more  
Another young heart to break
