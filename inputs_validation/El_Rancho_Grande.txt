I love to roam out yonder  
Out where the buffalo wander  
Free as the eagle flying Im aroping and atying  
  
Give me my ranch and my cattle  
Far from the greed citys rattle  
Give me a big herd to battle  
For I just love herding the cattle  
  
I love to roam out yonder  
Out where the buffalo wander  
Free as the eagle flying Im aroping and atying  
Im aroping and atying  
  
Give me my bridle and saddle  
And my old pinto Ill straddle  
Ill get the cowboys ariding  
Out where the rustlers are hiding  
  
I love to roam out yonder  
Out where the buffalo wander  
Free as the eagle flying Im aroping and atying  
Im aroping and atying  
  
Sometimes the winter storms tearing  
Set all the cattle arearing  
But when the winter is over  
Were sure enough in the clover  
  
Alla en la rancho grande  
Alla donde vivia  
Habia una ranche rita  
Que alegre me decia  
Que alegre me decia
