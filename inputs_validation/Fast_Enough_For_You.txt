If time were only part of the equation  
Then you could draw the boundaries of our cage  
You wouldnt pile another stone upon me  
And Id be happy just to watch you age  
  
But everything is in its own dominion  
And waiting in the shallows as I do  
Appeases me as water slowly trickles out  
Which isnt nearly fast enough for you  
  
It isnt nearly fast enough for you  
It isnt nearly fast enough for you  
Its what I was afraid of  
I stumble into view  
But it isnt nearly fast enough for you  
It isnt nearly fast enough for you
