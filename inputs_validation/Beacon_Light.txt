Looking up to the sky  
Made me realize  
Made me want to fly  
  
To a place far away  
Where theyre singing songs  
And making love all day  
  
Somewhere beyond the sun  
Where an atom splits  
And an ounce is a ton  
  
So dont you be late  
I see the Beacon Light and its on  
So strap on that jammy pack  
Fuel it up  
Cause Im gone  
  
The people all dance  
With their big long arms  
And a peach in their pants  
  
Picking fruit from the sky  
As the demon ship  
Goes passing them by  
  
I dont know if its love  
But its coming down  
From the heavens above  
  
So dont you be late  
I see the Beacon Light and its on  
So strap on that jammy pack  
Fuel it up  
Cause Im gone  
  
So dont you be late  
I see the Beacon Light and its on  
So strap on that jammy pack  
Fuel it up  
Cause Im gone
