Just a shoulder to cry on  
Thats all Ive been to you  
Just someone to rely on  
When your world is empty and blue  
  
Im just someone you call dear  
Anytime you choose  
Im someone you run to  
Someone you use  
  
Im just someone to talk to  
And thats all Ill ever be  
Just a clown you can laugh with  
Someone to treat as you need  
  
Im just a fool you can love on  
Any time you choose  
Im just someone you run to  
Someone you use  
  
Im just someone you run to  
Im just someone you use  
Dont you know when you need me  
My little heart just cant refuse  
  
Im just someone who loves you baby  
I cant win and I cant lose  
Im just someone you run to  
Im just someone you use
