When you rock on Clap on ayyayoaii  
Letss Until its over bring your body closer  
One more shot and its over ayaaayyoa  
Put your hands above put your hands up high  
See you cut up in the night light  
And everything about you is without  
Oh baby yeah your body so you can dance with me  
So were gonna party like  
  
The best about your beauty is to build for me the reason  
The rest of your body is my black brown ready for recess  
And I can tell you got your hair Bitches hate em and Nothing  
But the hair flew Im impressed about your body going all in  
Just like a saying all shit a house hold name  
Youre the bad and the love got me higher than addicts  
Ill dress you in the best the money can buy  
And money came by love was shit Ima try

Hands above put your hands up highhh oh ay  
When you rock on Clap on ayyayoaii  
Letss Until its over bring your body closer  
One more shot and its over ayaaayyoa  
Put your hands above put your hands up high  
See you cut up in the night light  
And everything about you is without  
Oh baby yeah your body so you can dance with me  
So were gonna party like
