Miles away from light at noon  
Total eclipse of the moon  
Many reasons to believe in life  
Just listen what its telling you  
  
Come and have a look inside  
Total eclipse of the moon  
Dont be childish dont be so cruel  
Im feeling just lonely without  
Without you  
  
I can see the wide horizons  
But debts have to be paid  
Our ways will cross again someday  
Believe and come back to you  
Ill see you soon  
  
Time doesnt say hello  
Total eclipse of the moon  
Many nights in our lives before  
I was dreaming to be just beside  
Beside you  
  
Total eclipse of the moon  
Ill see you soon
