In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand  
With an aching in my heart and a pocket full of sand  
Im a long way from home and I miss my loved one so  
In the early morning rain with no place to go  
Out on runway number nine big 707 set to go  
But Im stuck here on the grass where the cold winds they do blow  
And where the whiskey it was boss and the women they were fine  
Well now there she goes my friend shes arolling down the line  
Hear the mighty engines roar see the silver bird on high  
Shes away and westward bound far above the clouds shell fly  
Where the morning rain dont fall and the sun always shines  
Shell be flying oer my home in about three hours time  
This old airports got me down it aint no earthy good to me  
Because Im stuck here on the ground as cold and drunk as I can be  
You cant jump a jet plane like you can a railroad train  
So Id best be on my way in the early morning rain
