Take your time and tell me  
Where you lie  
I realize  
That weve been found out this time  
  
We should stay together  
If we can  
But what youve planned  
Means theres a difference between  
  
Chorus  
What youre gonna say  
In private  
You still want my love  
Were in this together  
And what youre gonna do  
In public  
Say you were never in love  
That you can remember  
  
So discreet  
I never tried to meet  
Your friends or interfere  
I took a back seat between  
  
Chorus  
  
What you gonna say eh  
When you run back to your wife  
I guess its just the story of my life  
What you gonna say  
  
So take your time  
And tell me  
Where did you learn  
Oh I may publicize  
That theres a difference between  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell me what you gonna say  
In private oh oh oh  
What you gonna say  
What you gonna do  
Baby what you gonna say
