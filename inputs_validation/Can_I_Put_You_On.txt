I work for the foundry for a penny and a half a day  
Like a blind street musician I never see those who pay  
Its dirty work in Birmingham  
Better deal for a Sheffield man  
If he can rivet then his kids can buy  
Candy from the candy man  
  
And the van that comes around weekends  
Selling fancy city things  
Sold by the man with the trilby hat  
And the whiskers spread like wings  
You can hear him sing  
Oh you can hear him sing  
Can I put you on people can I put you on  
Tell you that I love you people  
Sing a salesmans song and put you on  
  
And a second cousin works in the pits in Newcastle on Tyne  
And he dont care if it rains outside theres coal dust on his mind  
Its dirty work in Manchester  
But the crew gets paid its gelt  
Bang on the bell on Friday  
You buys a little something for yourself  
  
And the van that comes around weekends  
Selling fancy city things  
Sold by the man in the trilby hat  
And the whiskers spread like wings  
You can hear him sing  
Oh you can hear him sing  
Can I put you on people can I put you on  
Tell you that I love you people  
Sing a salesmans song and put you on
