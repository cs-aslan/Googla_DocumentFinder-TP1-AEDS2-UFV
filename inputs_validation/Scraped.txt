Chorus  
Dont you try and stop us now  
I just refuse  
Dont you try to stop us now  
Cause I just wont let you  
  
Sometimes I feel like the world is on top of me  
Breaking me down with an endless monotony  
Sometimes I feel like theres nothing thats stopping me  
All things are possible I am unstoppable  
  
So they convince you no one can break through  
Im here to tell you youre worth more than they tell you  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes I feel like my lifes a catastrophe  
Cant understand why it seems like it has to be  
Sometimes I feel like its all opened up for me  
Nothings impossible I am unconquerable  
  
No one can make you do what they want to  
You know youre stronger than the lies that they tell you  
  
Chorus  
  
So they convince you no one can break through  
You know youre stronger than the lies that they tell you  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X
