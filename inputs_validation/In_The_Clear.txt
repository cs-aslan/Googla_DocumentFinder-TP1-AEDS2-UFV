This indecisions got me climbing up the walls  
Ive been cheating gravity and waiting on the falls  
How did this come over me I thought I was above it all  
Our hopes gone up in smoke swallow your crown  
  
Choke On a kiss I thought Id save my breath for you  
Choke On a kiss I thought Id save my breath for you  
Give me some rope Im coming loose Im hanging on you  
Give me some rope Im coming loose Im pulling for you now  
Give me some rope Im coming out of my head into the clear  
When you go I come loose  
  
These premonitions got me crying up a storm  
Leave your condition this position does no harm  
  
Choke On a kiss I thought Id save my breath for you  
Choke On a kiss I thought Id save my breath for you  
Give me some rope Im coming loose Im hanging on you  
Give me some rope Im coming loose Im pulling for you now  
Give me some rope Im coming out of my head into the clear  
When you go I come loose  
  
Give me some rope Im coming loose Im hanging on you  
Give me some rope Im coming loose Im pulling for you now  
Give me some hope Im coming through Im counting on you  
Give me some rope Im coming out of my head into the clear  
When you go I come  
Loose
