Ohh youre a dream  
Hide your head in the sand  
Youre far away when I want you around  
And you leave me lonely when Im feeling down  
Do your ever wonder or worry about me  
Did I ever love you did you ever love me  
Do your ever wonder or worry about me  
Did I ever love you did you ever love me  
Why is it baby our love just wont grow  
You made me happy but time has gone by  
Please leave me softly I wont say goodbye  
So all I wanted slips through my hands  
Youre far away when I want you around  
And you leave me lonely when Im feeling down  
Do your ever wonder or worry about me  
Did I ever love you did you ever love me  
Do your ever wonder or worry about me  
Did I ever love you did you ever love me
