Im going home to the town where i was born  
Where little children laughed as they sang  
A happy song  
In the little town of Ceylon  
Ceylon city Ceylon city  
  
Ive got a boat  i hope its still afloat  
With rusty sails and an old wooden oar  
It goes along in the little town of Ceylon  
  
Ceylon city  
My daddy will be waiting there  
My sister will be combing down her silver hair  
My mama will be waiting there  
Serving lunch to my brother but hes nowhere  
  
Ceylon city
