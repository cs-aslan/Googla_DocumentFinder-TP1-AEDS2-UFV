Young and wild with a madness  
I wouldnt listen  
I thought I knew just exactly  
The way life would be you see  
You came along and you showed me  
Just what I was missing  
You opened my eyes with your sweet love  
Oh then I could see  
  
They said it wouldnt last  
We proved them wrong  
We learned to fly above the storm  
Cause weve always known that we belong  
And were better together  
If we got our backs against the wall  
Somehow we survive through it all  
Knowing Ill be there if you should fall  
Oh were better together all right yeah yeah  
  
Running alone I was searching  
While you were there waiting  
Lessons in love I was learning  
Were all right with me you see  
You changed my world and you gave me  
Aw the kiss you were saving  
Oh we had each other to fight for  
Oh when no one believed  
  
They said it wouldnt last  
We proved them wrong  
We learned to fly above the storm  
Cause weve always known that we belong  
And were better together  
If we got our backs against the wall  
Somehow we survive through it all  
Knowing Ill be there if you should fall  
Yeah were better together  
  
Ooh it gets so lonely out there  
Oh playing my solitaire  
  
Oh Mustang  
All right  
Wait a minute  
Young and wild with a madness  
This time I listened baby  
You opened my eyes with your sweet love  
Ooh yeah you set me free  
Taken from OldieLyricscom  
They said it wouldnt last  
We proved them wrong  
We learned to fly above the storm  
Cause weve always known where we belong  
Yeah were better together  
Oh if we got our backs against the wall  
Somehow we survive through it all  
Knowing Ill be there if you should fall  
Oh were better together  
So much better girl were better together  
Better together all right  
Listen  
Lets get together lets get together all right  
Lets get together well  
Lets get together lets get together right now  
Its just its just better that way
