You dont have a clue  
Youre so far gone  
Hes got you dancin to  
A sirens song  
  
Chorus  
I wouldnt want to be you right now  
I wouldnt want to be  
I wouldnt want to be you right now  
I wouldnt want to be I wouldnt want to be  
  
Youre not the first hes drawn  
To his flame  
He means to do you wrong  
He has no shame  
  
Chorus  
  
Its easy to understand  
How you could fall so hard  
Youre not the only one  
Hes taken in and torn apart  
  
Wont say I told you so  
But Im afraid its true  
Youre about to go  
What I went through  
  
Chorus
