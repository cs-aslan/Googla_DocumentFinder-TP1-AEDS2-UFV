You know they say that one hand washes the other  
Well you better start better start looking out for me  
Cause theres a way that you can be minus one lover  
Just keep making it hard deliberately  
  
If youre gonna play with fire dont cry when you burn your fingers  
Im not going to be the fool that you get tired of  
Someones got to clean up their act before the show is over  
Baby such are the facts of love  
  
Its been so long since we made magic together  
But you never stopped taking real good care of yourself  
There comes a time you see your face in the mirror  
And something tells you the pain aint good for your health no no  
  
If youre gonna play with fire dont cry when you burn your fingers  
Im not going to be the fool that you get tired of  
Someones got to clean up their act before the show is over  
Baby such are the facts of love ooh  
  
If you gonna play with fire dont cry when you burn your fingers  
Im not going to be the fool that you get tired of  
Somebodys got to clean up their act before the show is over  
Baby such are the facts the facts of love the facts of love the facts of
love
