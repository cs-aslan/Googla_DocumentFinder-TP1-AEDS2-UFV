Good morning  
  
When you look into the mirror  
Do you see a face you hardly recognise  
If you look into the sun too long  
Do the things you see begin to burn your eyes  
  
Paper lies  
  
Just to express what hes thinking  
Must a man take all the mail will bring  
Are we living only for today  
Its a sign of the times  
We believe anything and nothing  
  
Paper lies  
  
When you kill the truth  
You can make a killing  
You might just make losing look like winning  
  
You came to tell the people whats goin on  
But nobody knows whose side youre on  
Seems like youre sailin pretty close to the wind again  
  
Paper lies  
You have already won a prize  
  
I know something that you dont know  
Something that you ought to know  
Its burning a hole in my pocket book  
Listen  do you want to know a secret  
We can print our own money here  
If you let us do a piece on you  
We can take you to pieces  
  
When you look into the money  
Do you see a face you hardly recognise  
When you get behind the news of the world  
Do the things you find begin to bend your mind  
  
Paper lies  
  
Why dont you let us take a piece out of you
