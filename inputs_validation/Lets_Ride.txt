Used as a scapegoat and taped to the wall  
Bruised and abused on some foreign soil  
Trained to kill baby thats what we do  
And programmed to bleed red white and blue  
  
Cmon and grab your guns lets ride  
And may your conscience be your guide  
Ill say a prayer for you to make it through to the other side  
Tonights the night we fight or die  
  
Grab your guns son said we headed for war  
Like your uncle JT done years before  
No pussy no dope this aint Saigon  
But keep your heads up for roadside bombs  
  
Cmon and grab your guns lets ride  
And may your conscience be your guide  
Ill say a prayer for you to make it through to the other side  
Tonights the night we fight or die  
  
Even in darkness youre my strength my soul my will to survive  
But in this fight I stand ready to die  
  
Cmon and grab your guns lets ride  
And may your conscience be your guide  
Ill say a prayer for you to make it through to the other side  
Tonights the night tonights the night  
Cmon and grab your guns lets ride  
And may your conscience be your guide  
Cmon  
Cmon  
Cmon  
Cmon  
Cmon  
Cmon yeah  
  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa
