All this talk of getting old  
Its getting me down my love  
Like a cat in a bag waiting to drown  
This time Im comin down  
  
And I hope youre thinking of me  
As you lay down on your side  
Now the drugs dont work  
They just make you worse  
But I know Ill see your face again  
  
Now the drugs dont work  
They just make you worse  
But I know Ill see your face again  
  
But I know Im on a losing streak  
Cause I passed down my old street  
And if you wanna show then just let me know  
And Ill sing in your ear again  
  
Now the drugs dont work  
They just make you worse  
But I know Ill see your face again  
  
Cause baby ooh if heaven calls Im coming too  
Just like you said you leave my life Im better off dead

Im never going down Im never coming down  
No more no more no more no more no more  
Im never coming down Im never going down  
No more no more no more no more no more  
Im never going down Im never coming down  
No more no more no more no more no more  
Im never coming down Im never going down  
No more no more no more no more no more
