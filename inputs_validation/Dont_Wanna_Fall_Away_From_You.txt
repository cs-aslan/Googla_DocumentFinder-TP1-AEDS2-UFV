After all the things that you have shown me  
Id be a fool to let them slip away  
In doing things I know I shouldnt do  
But I dont want to fall away from you  
From you  
  
After all  
Ive only grieved your spirit  
And then I dont know why you stay with me  
But every time I fall your love comes through  
And I dont want to fall away from you  
  
When the light is gone  
And good times are getting old  
Theres no one left to count on  
And all my friends are cold  
When I thirst for love oh Lord  
Youre a fountain to my soul  
My soul  
My soul  
Oh lord  
My soul  
  
In a way my life is full of burdens  
But in a way you carry them from me  
Jesus  
Cause no one understands the way you do  
And you know Lord  
I dont want to fall away from you  
  
Well every day I pray to start anew  
Cause I dont want to fall away from you  
  
No Lord  
I dont want to fall away from you  
No Lord  
I dont want to fall away from you  
  
From you Lord
