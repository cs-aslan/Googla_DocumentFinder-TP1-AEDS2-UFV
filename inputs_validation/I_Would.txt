Lately I found myself thinking  
Been dreaming about you a lot  
And up in my head Im your boyfriend  
But thats one thing youve already got  
  
He drives to school every morning  
While I walk alone in the rain  
Hed kill me without any warning  
If he took a look in my brain  
  
Would he say hes in LOVE  
Well if it was me then I would I would  
Would he hold you when youre feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would I would  
Would he say hes in LOVE  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when youre feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
Back in my head we were kissing  
I thought things were going alright  
With a sign on my back saying kick me  
Reality ruined my life  
  
Feels like Im constantly playing  
A game that Im destined to lose  
Cause I cant compete with your boyfriend  
Hes got 27 tattoos  
  
Would he say hes in LOVE  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when youre feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
Would he say hes in LOVE  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when youre feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
Would he please you  
Would he kiss you  
Would he treat you like I would  
Would he touch you  
Would he need you  
Would he love you like I would  
  
Would he say hes in LOVE  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when youre feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
Would he please you  
Would he kiss you  
Would he treat you like I would  
Would he touch you  
Would he need you  
Would he love you like I would  
  
Would he say hes in LOVE  
Well if it was me then  
I would I would  
Would he hold you when youre feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
I would I would yeah
