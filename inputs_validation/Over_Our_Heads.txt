Close your eyes  
Cant you see its burning slow  
Fading down the sparks of fire earth bound  
Space in two  
Warm beyond the love below  
Close your eyes  
Its time for us to go  
  
Over our heads  
Light keeps passing through  
Over our heads  
Lite from me to you  
  
Falling down  
Way beneath the healing skies  
Rise and shine  
The crying times left behind  
  
Over our heads  
All we see is true  
Over our heads  
Cant you see it too  
  
Over our heads  
Light keeps passing through  
Over our heads  
Lite from me to you
