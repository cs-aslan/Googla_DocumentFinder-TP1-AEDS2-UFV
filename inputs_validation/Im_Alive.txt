The target is me a monster you flee  
I hate what you say and you do  
A mirror is there and look if you dare  
The fool that you sees only you  
Oh no you wont nail me to your tree  
Or hang my head up high  
No kingdom reigns over me  
Despise all the liars I see  
Dont give me your  
Save my soul cure  
  
REFRAIN  
I  Im still alive and I am soul survivor  
You cant understand why  
I  Im still alive and I am soul survivor  
Damn your holy man  alive  
  
Cant understand the lord of the land  
Your heart and your head made of stone  
Lay in the sand my blood on your hands  
For Gods sake just leave me alone  
Oh no you wont nail me to your tree  
Or hang my head up high  
Restless is all I can be  
Ruthless and reckless you see  
I dont need your  
Save my soul cure  
  
REFRAIN  
  
Force suppression thats what you do  
Feel me whats in it for you  
Listen Im on to your game  
All your lies are the same  
  
REFRAIN
