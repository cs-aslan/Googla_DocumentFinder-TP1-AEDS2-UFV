No one believes me  
Someone conceived me  
A fluke in the night of obscurity  
Played by millions simulcast by a few  
A city no lights such a great view  
Its all very strange its the name of the game  
  
Its all the same its never gonna change  
Its the name of the game  
Over and over and over again  
Time after time after time  
Over and over and over again  
Love is the name of the game  
  
Come around and see me analyze or analogy  
Ill give you a clue what you really need  
If things get bad then things can get worse  
Remember surrender remember the verse  
Its all very strange its the name of the game  
Its all the same its never gonna change  
  
Its the name of the game  
Over and over and over again  
Time after time after time  
Over and over and over again  
Love is the name of the game  
  
I say hold on tight  
Say hey youre doin it right  
As i wish for a full dream flight  
Night after night im a knight  
Over and over and over and over  
And over and over again  
  
Time after time after time  
Over and over and over and over  
Love is the name of the game  
And then it came to me  
Its just a game to me  
Love is the name of the game
