You may travel far far from your own native home  
Far away oer the mountains far away oer the foam  
But of all the fine places that Ive ever seen  
Theres none to compare with the cliffs of Dooneen  
  
Take a view oer the mountains fine sights youll see there  
Youll see the high rocky mountains on the west coast of Clare  
The towns of Kilkee and Kilrush can be seen  
From the high Rocky slopes of the Cliffs of Dooneen  
  
Fare thee well to Dooneen Fare thee well for a while  
And to all the fine people Im leaving behind  
To the streams and the meadows where late I have been  
And the high rocky slopes of the Cliffs of Dooneen  
  
You may travel for far from your own native home  
Far away oer the mountains far away oer the foam  
But of all the fine places that lve ever seen  
Theres none to compare with the Cliffs of Dooneen
