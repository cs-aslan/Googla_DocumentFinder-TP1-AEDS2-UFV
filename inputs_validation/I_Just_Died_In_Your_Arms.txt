Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
  
I keep looking for something  
I cant get broken hearts lie all around me  
And I dont see an easy way to get out of this  
Her diary it sits on the bedside table  
The curtains are closed  
The cats in the cradle who wouldve thought  
That a boy like me could come to this  
  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
It mustve been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
Oh I I just died in your arms tonight  
  
It mustve been some kind of kiss I shouldve walked away  
Is there any just cause for feeling like this  
On the surface Im a name on a list I try to be discreet  
But then blow it again  
Ive lost and found  
Its my final mistake shes loving by proxy  
No give and all take cos Ive been thrilled to fantasy one too many times  
  
Oh I I just died in your arms  
It was a long hot night she made it easy  
She made it feel right  
But now its over the moment has gone  
I followed my hands not my head  
I know I was wrong  
Oh I I just died in your arms
