Bolt up the windows lock all the doors  
Try to remember what a body is for  
Theres bad weather comin the red eyes runnin red  
Lets spend the weekend and never leave that bed  
Turn out the lights like theres no one home  
And cut the wires on the telephone  
Our hearts are pounding like a hurricane  
Makin love to the rhythm of the pourin rain  
Makin love to the rhythm of the pourin rain  
Lets tell ol Monday mornin Please dont come too soon  
The storm is still raging right here in this room  
Oh what a sweet way to spend our time  
Still got a little taste of some real good wine  
Turn out the lights like theres no one home  
And cut the wires on the telephone  
Our hearts are pounding like a hurricane  
Makin love to the rhythm of the pourin rain  
Makin love to the rhythm of the pourin rain  
Oh what a feelins gonna fill my brain  
Next time the weatherman says it looks like rain  
Turn out the lights like theres no one home  
And cut the wires on the telephone  
Our hearts are pounding like a hurricane  
Makin love to the rhythm of the pourin rain  
Turn out the lights like theres no one home  
And cut the wires on the telephone  
Our hearts are pounding like a hurricane  
Makin love to the rhythm of the pourin rain  
Makin love to the rhythm of the pourin rain  
Makin love to the rhythm of the pourin rain
