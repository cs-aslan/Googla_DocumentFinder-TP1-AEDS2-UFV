Lyrics  
Its the first annual global  
Global carnival  
Its the first annual global global carnival  
Its the first annual global  
Global carnival  
Its the first annual global Ah lets get down  
Global  
Carnival  
Global carnival  
We go have a jamboree  
The biggest one youll ever see  
We go revel in every nation  
Its go be a celebration  
Hear the music and feel the beat  
On every corner and every street  
Close the Kremlin the congress too  
Its a worldwide hullabaloo  
At the first annual global  
Global carnival  
At the first annual global carnival What ah say  
At the first annual global  
Global carnival  
At the first annual global carnival  
Ah lets have a party  
Global  
Carnival  
Global carnival  
Israel and Palestine forming up a conga line  
The Ayatollah and the Pope  
Doing a limbo under a rope  
Princess Di and the I Are A  
Well they jamming with a Rasta from Montego Bay  
Forget the left forget the right  
Ah ah we go party tonight  
At the first annual global  
Global carnival  
At the first annual global carnival Ah hum  
At the first annual global  
Global carnival  
At the first annual global carnival  
Global ah talk to me  
Carnival  
Global carnival  
Ah lets do it do it do it do it do it do it  
Sikhs Basques SerboCroatian  
Cambodians all join in the festivities  
Hindu Muslin Jews Christian  
It doesnt matter what ever your proclivities  
But let me make it very clear  
Nobody goes hungry here  
Margaret Thatcher parking cars  
Fidel Castro passing out cigars  
The C I A And the K G B  
Tye swapping se
