The sweetest thing Ive ever known  
Was like the kiss on the collarbone  
Soft caress of happiness  
The way you walk your style of dress  
I wish I didnt get so weak  
Ooo baby just to hear you speak  
Makes me argue just to see  
How much youre in love with me  
See like a queen a queen upon her throne  
  
Chorus  
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know  
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know  
  
I get mad when you walk away dont walk away  
So I tell you leave when I mean stay  
Warm as the sun dipped in black  
Fingertips on the small of my back  
More valuable than all I own  
Like your precious precious precious precious dark skin tone  
  
Chorus  
  
It was the ah  
I tried to explain  
Ah but baby its in vain  
  
Speaking on my mothers phone  
The touching makes me think Im grown you aint grown  
Sweet prince of the ghetto  
Your kisses taste like amaretto  
Intoxicating oh so intoxicating  
How sad how sad that all things come to an end  
But then again Im Im not alone  
  
Chorus
