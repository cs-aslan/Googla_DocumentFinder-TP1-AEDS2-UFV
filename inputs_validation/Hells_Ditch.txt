Lifes a bitch then you die  
Black Hell  
Hells ditch naked howling freedom  
The killers hands are bound with chains  
At six oclock it starts to rain  
Hell never see the dawn again  
Our lady of the flowers  
  
Genets feeling Ramons dick  
The guy in the bunk above gets sick  
In the cell next door the lunatic  
Starts screaming for his mother  
  
Black dildo black hell  
As the Spanish cops ridiculed my gel  
A mugshot I remember well  
Little man how you have suffered  
  
I could hear the screams from up above  
If it aint a fist it isnt love  
As for our lady she kneels down  
Her neck is bent the blade comes down  
Doing There goes the breakfast bell  
Back from heaven back to hell  
Naked howling freedom Hells ditch
