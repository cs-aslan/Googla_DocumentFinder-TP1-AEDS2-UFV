I see that nothins safe  
Insist on playing games  
Some waste their time and more  
I am still popular  
Permission since you fix  
I got to gas  get  
Or just another job  
Oh no surly not  
  
Your rude but youre absolute  
Stalemate ahh too late too late  
  
I thought you were for real  
Just won the river deal  
Dont give me all that crap  
I just escaped your trap  
But didnt you see the joke  
Then youre just chasin smoke  
You found another one  
An old storys done  
  
Your rude but youre absolute  
Stalemate ahh too late too late  
  
Misunderstanding me  
The way you felt so free  
Im gonna jump the gun  
Im gonna cut an run  
Youre gonna do it see  
Ive got no ice in me  
And now the thrill is gone  
An old storys done  
  
Your rude but youre absolute  
Stalemate ahh too late too late
