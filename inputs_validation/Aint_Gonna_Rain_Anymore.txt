Aint Gonna Rain Anymore  
  
Once there came a storm in the form of a girl  
It blew to pieces my snug little world  
Sometimes I swear I can still hear her howl  
Down through the wreckage and the ruins  
  
And it aint gonna rain anymore  
Now my babys gone  
And it aint gonna rain anymore  
Now my babys gone  
  
Now the storm has passed over me  
Im left to drift on a dead calm sea  
And watch her forever through the cracks in the beams  
Nailed across the doorways of the bedrooms of my dreams  
  
And it aint gonna rain anymore  
Now my babys gone  
And it aint gonna rain anymore  
Now my babys gone  
  
Now I got no one to hold  
Now I am all alone again  
It aint too hot but it aint too cold  
And there is no sign of rain  
  
And it aint gonna rain anymore  
Now my babys gone  
And it aint gonna rain anymore  
Now my babys gone  
And Im  
Here Im on my own  
  
She aint coming back no more  
She aint coming back no more  
She aint coming back no more  
Say what you will I dont care  
  
And it aint gonna rain anymore  
Now my babys gone yeah  
And it aint gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby has gone
