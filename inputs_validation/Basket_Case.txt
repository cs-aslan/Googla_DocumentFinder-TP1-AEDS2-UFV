My baby is a basket case  
A bipolar mama in leather and lace  
Face like an angel shes a perfect waste  
My baby is a basket case  
  
Draculas daughter Calamity Jane  
Smoke on the water water on the brain  
Shes pretty as a picture and totally crazed  
My baby is a basket case  
  
Shes gonna make a madman outta me  
Shes gonna make a madman outta me  
  
Shes manicdepressive and schizoid too  
The friskiest psycho that I ever knew  
Were paranoid lovers lost in space  
My baby is a basket case  
  
My babys gonna celebrate  
Im being dragged through the nuthouse gates  
Got my straitjacket on and Im taking her place  
My baby is a basket case  
  
She finally made a madman outta me  
She finally made a madman outta me  
My baby made a madman outta me  
She finally made a madman outta me
