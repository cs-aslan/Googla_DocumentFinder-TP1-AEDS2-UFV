Its too hot for words  
Why bother with conversation  
Dont lets talk or even walk  
If you want to make love okay  
  
Its too hot for words  
Theres nothing like relaxation  
Cant ignore this temperature  
But if you want to make love okay  
  
Lets find a cozy nook  
Beside a babbling brook  
Lets find a shady tree  
Let the love birds talk for you and me  
  
Cause its much too hot for words  
Why bother with conversation  
Goodness knows my heart disclose  
All it dares to say  
All it cares to say  
Its too hot for words
