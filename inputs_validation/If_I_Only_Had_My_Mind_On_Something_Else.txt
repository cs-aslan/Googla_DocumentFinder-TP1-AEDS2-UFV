I could be king of kings wear a crown and all the things  
Id want Id never need  
Id be an ace in an aeroplane and every year Id fly to Spain  
If I could get the nerve to plant the seed  
  
Chorus  
Oh tell me how to say goodbye  
I see her face in myself  
Why tell me why I made her cry  
If only had my mind on something else  
  
Captain of the submarine beneath the icebergs never seen  
A hero with a medal for everyday  
I find me famereach the top  
I keep on pushing never stop  
If I could just forget her name  
  
Chorus  
  
If only had my mind on something else
