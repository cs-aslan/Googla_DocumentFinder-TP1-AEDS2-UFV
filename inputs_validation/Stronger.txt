Intro  
Been through hell now Im hell proof  
Pouring cups of whiskey to get through it  
Oh sweet child of mine gone way too soon  
Lost myself and lost my faith too  
  
Hook  
Ive had my share of ups and downs  
Ive had my share of down and outs  
Baptized in a river and almost drowned  
Thats when I figured out  
Im stronger than ever now stronger than ever now  
Im stronger than ever now stronger than ever now  
Stronger than ever now  
Ohh  
Verse  
Walk through fire now Im fireproof  
Forever wear these scars like tattoos  
Finally found paradise right in my view  
And its killing me that I cant share it with you  
  
Hook  
Ive had my share of ups and downs  
Ive had my share of down and outs  
Baptized in a river and almost drowned  
Thats when I figured out  
Im stronger than ever now stronger than ever now  
Im stronger than ever now Im stronger than ever now  
  
Stronger than ever now  
  
Verse  
Though youre gone you still live in my mind  
The only thing we ran out of is time  
Since you left I aint been quite the same  
I wonder if you miss me do I make you proud  
Know youre watching me I feel your spirit  
I keep you right by my side  
Im stronger than ever now far from perfect  
Life will knock you down get back up  
Fight for whats worth it  
Be strong enough I know its easier said than done  
  
Bridge  
Stronger than ever now  
I been through it now stronger  
Stronger now hey stronger now  
All that I been through some how I found my way out  
Long as I believe in me I know I can make it  
I know youll make it cause youre stronger  
Stronger than ever now  
Stronger
