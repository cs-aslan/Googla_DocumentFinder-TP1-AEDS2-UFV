If you were the Mona Lisa  
Youd be hanging in the Louvre  
Everyone would come to see you  
Youd be impossible to move  
It seems to me is what you are  
A rare and priceless work of art  
Stay behind your velvet rope  
But I will not renounce all hope  
  
And Im right by your side  
Like a thief in the night  
I stand in front of the masterpiece  
And I cant tell you why  
It hurts so much  
To be in love with the masterpiece  
Cause after all  
Nothings indestructible  
  
From the moment I first saw you  
All the darkness turned to light  
An impressionistic painting  
Tiny particles of light  
It seem to me is what youre like  
The look but please dont touch me type  
And honestly it cant be fun  
To always be the chosen one  
  
And Im right by your side  
Like a thief in the night  
I stand in front of the masterpiece  
And I cant tell you why  
It hurts so much  
To be in love with a masterpiece  
Cause after all  
Nothings indestructible  
Nothings indestructible  
Nothings indestructible  
Nothings indestructible  
  
And Im right by your side  
Like a thief in the night  
I stand in front of the masterpiece  
And I cant tell you why  
It hurts so much  
To be in love with a masterpiece  
  
And Im right by your side  
Like a thief in the night  
I stand in front of the masterpiece  
And I cant tell you why  
It hurts so much  
To be in love with a masterpiece  
Cause after all  
Nothings indestructible  
Cause after all  
Nothings indestructible
