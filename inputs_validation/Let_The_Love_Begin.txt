Look at us aint it funny  
Is it just beginners luck maybe  
Ooh with just one touch  
Two different people  
From such different worlds apart  
Has touched each others heart  
Like candles in the dark  
So if its time for us we gotta take it  
Take the chance the chance to make it  
  
Now Let the love begin  
Let the light come shining in  
Who knows where the road will lead us now  
Look at what weve found  
Make this moment turn our hearts around  
It may never come again let it in  
Let the love begin  
  
Ooh here we are so close together  
I can feel the fire starts between us  
Ooh weve come this far  
Too far to stop it now  
If this is meant to be its meant to be  
A chance for you and me for you and me  
Weve found our destiny  
Now were looking at a new forever  
Make this dream come true together  
  
Now let the love begin  
Let the light come shining in  
Who knows where the road will lead us now  
Look at what weve found  
Make this moment turn our hearts around  
It may never come again let it in  
Let the love begin 2x
