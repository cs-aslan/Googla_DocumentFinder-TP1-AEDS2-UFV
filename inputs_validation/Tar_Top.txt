It was July hot cross Georgia on my way to myrtle beach  
I just got my diploma so I set out in search of me  
The honeymoon was over and Alabama was far away  
From being little more than just a southern state  
  
I got a gig down at the Bowery  
I played for tip and watered drinks  
Just a novice in a business  
Thats seldom what it seems  
  
And where are you goin tar top  
Wheres JC and the chosen few  
I saw the flash without TGentry  
And BV left for Malibu  
  
I was July hot and thirty some years down the line  
When the boys touched the nation unaware at the time  
I got to go to Texas California New York too  
A farm boy who is thankful to be standin in his shoes  
  
But in the Bowery hangs the memories  
Of dreams that still come true  
Every time I see the spotlights  
Im one of the chosen few  
  
And where are you going tar top  
JC and the chosen few  
Theres no flash without TGentry  
BV where are you  
  
Where are you goin tar top  
Which direction will you take  
Whats this contraband clamor  
About the music that you make  
  
And where are you goin tar top  
Is it country enough  
Is it contemporary glamor  
No its us just us
