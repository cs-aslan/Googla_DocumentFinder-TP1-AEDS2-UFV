Today he traded his 98 Oldsmobile  
He got a heck of a deal on a new Porsche car  
He isnt wearing his usual gray business suits  
Hes got jeans and high boots with an embroidered star  
Cause today hes forty years old going on twenty  
But dont look for the gray in his hair  
Cause he aint got any  
Hes got a young thing beside him  
That just melts in his hands  
And hes middle aged crazy  
Trying to prove he still can  
Hes got a woman hes loved for a long long time at home  
But the thrill is all gone when they turn down the lights  
And today hes forty years old going on twenty  
And dont look for the gray in his hair  
Cause he aint got any  
And that young thing beside him you know she understands  
Hes just middle aged crazy  
Trying to prove he still can  
Yes hes middle aged crazy  
Trying to prove he still can
