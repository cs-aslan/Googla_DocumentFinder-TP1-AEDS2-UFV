Ooh no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style  
I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile  
  
Last year when I had to send my Christmas cards  
I had to sign my name alone  
But now your name is next to mine  
And theres more love in every line  
Im wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone Ive known  
  
No more blue Christmases theyll all be bright  
No more just pretending to be happy when Im sad  
Going through the motions while others feel glad  
  
No more blue Christmases now that Ive found you  
Oh no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style  
I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile  
  
Last year when I had to buy my Christmas gifts  
I had to do it on my own  
Ooh champagne parties everywhere but without you I just didnt care  
Now theres more than just a Christmas tree to decorate my home  
  
No more blue Christmases now that Ive found you  
Oh no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style  
I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile  
  
No more blue Christmases now that Ive found you  
Ooh no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style  
I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile oh  
I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile  
  
Merry Christmas everyone
