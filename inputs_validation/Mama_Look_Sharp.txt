Mama look sharp  
  
Momma hey momma  
Come looking for me  
Im here in the meadow  
By the red maple tree  
Momma hey momma  
Look sharp  
Here I be  
Hey hey momma look sharp  
Them soldiers they fired  
Oh ma did we run  
But when we turned around  
The battle begun  
Then I went under  
Oh ma am I done  
Hey hey momma look sharp  
My eyes are wide open  
My face to the sky  
Is that you Im hearing  
In the tall grass near by  
Ah momma come find me  
Before I do die  
Hey hey momma look sharp  
Ill close your eyes my Billy  
Those eyes that can not see  
And Ill bury you my Billy  
Beneath the maple tree  
And never again  
Will you whisper to me  
Hey hey oh momma look sharp
