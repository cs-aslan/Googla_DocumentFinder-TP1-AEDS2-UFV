I remember Richard Nixon back in 74  
And the final scene at the White House door  
And the staff lined up to say goodbye  
Tiny tear in his shifty little eye  
He said nobody knows me nobody understands  
These little people were good to me  
Oh Im gonna shake some hands  
  
Somebody line em up line em all up  
Line em up line em all up  
Somebody line em up line em all up  
Line em up line em all up  
  
At that time my heart was all broke  
I looked like ashes and smelled like smoke  
And I turned away from my loving kind  
Try to leave my body and live in my mind  
But its much too much emotion  
To hold it in your hand  
Theyve got waves out on the ocean  
Theyre gonna wear away the land  
  
Somebody line em up line em all up  
Line em up line em all up  
Want you to line em up line em all up  
Line em up line em all up  
  
Oh Ive seen corn in Kansas and Ive seen  
Picket fences and certain cowboy dances  
Ive gone lining up for shows Ive been safely Placed in rows sure I know
how it goes  
  
Another day goes by little time machine  
Im raking my brain over what it might mean  
Just to claim the time and to turn away  
To make today today  
Who waits for you lonely tired old toad  
Its your life laid out before you like  
The broken white line  
Down the center of the road  
  
Line em up line em all up line em up  
Line em all up  
Line em up line em all up line em up  
Line em all up  
  
Yeah big moon landing people are standing up  
Smiles for the loved ones  
They go walking on down the aisles  
Each reengages stepping into the sun  
I watch them turn like pages one by one by one  
  
Want you to line em up line em all up  
Line em up line em all up  
Line em up line em all up line em up  
Line em all up  
  
Indecipherable French grunting
