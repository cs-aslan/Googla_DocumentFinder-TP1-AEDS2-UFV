Baby stands before an open window  
Looking so far away  
She can almost feel the southern winds blow  
Gently touching her restless day  
  
She turns from her window to me  
Sad smile her apology  
Sad eyes reaching to the door  
  
Daylight loses to another evening  
And still she spares me the words goodbye  
Sits alone beside me fighting her feelings  
Struggles to speak but in the end can only cry  
  
Suddenly its so hard to find  
The sound of the words to speak her troubled mind  
So Im offering these to her as if to be kind  
Theres a train everyday leaving either way  
Theres a world you know  
Theres a way to go  
And youll soon be gone its just as well  
This is my opening farewell  
  
A childs drawings left there on the table  
And a womans silk lying on the floor  
I would keep them here if I were able  
To Lock you safe behind this open door  
  
Suddenly its so clear to me  
That Id asked you to see what you may never see  
And now my kind words find their way back to me  
Theres a train everyday leaving either way  
Theres a world you know  
You got a way to go  
And Ill soon believe its just as well  
This is my opening farewell
