You wont forget my eyes  
Ooh deep inside you realize  
Youre gonna see me wherever you go  
Youre gonna hear me on your radio  
There you are in your car  
You hear a voice thats calling  
Do you want me  
Do you want me  
  
Take me to heart  
I promise you a miracle  
Take me to heart  
Youre gonna be mine  
Take me to heart  
You know its just a matter of time  
  
Im always on your mind  
Im the chill that never left your spine  
In the building where you live and breathe  
Im the sound that never lets you sleep  
Down the hall through the walls  
You hear a voice thats calling  
Do you want me  
Do you want me  
  
Take me to heart  
Dont deny the miracle  
Take me to heart  
What more can I say  
Take me to heart  
Surrenders just a motion away
