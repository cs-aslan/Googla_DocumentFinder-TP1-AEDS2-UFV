This pygmy I be clutchin  
Have been lef out on de lawn

De mama were deFlateable  
De trauma to de imfunt  
Be mostly not neGateable  
  
Yo urgin to be exitin  
Because of dem flaminigos  
Be thoroughly perplexin him  
Because of where yo petuh goes  
  
If only you been siderate  
Erbout this lil illiterate  
I wouldna been trudgin cross de san  
Fum way down yonder in Egyplan  
  
Dey callin me brown moses  
Fo dat id sholy what I am  
Ancient an relijermus  
Solemn an prestigimus  
  
Wisdom reekin outa me  
Long wif summa this baby pee  
Minds me of dem River Weeds  
n all dem ignint Bible deeds  
  
Growed up in de Pharoah place  
Lef de sucker in disgrace  
Some dem boys refuse to loin  
Somthin smokin Somthin boin  
  
Somethin borry Somethin blue  
Best keeps a lil paper  
In yo shoe  
Hear me when Is tellin you  
Leavin de midgit were  
Wrong Tdo  
  
Its a terrble thang done did to him  
Left wit de crabgrass  
Over his chin  
  
Sholy one day he will grow

In yo sack o woe

Could ya lends me bout a dollar  
Is a tiny bit broke
