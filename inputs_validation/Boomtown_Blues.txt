Southern sun  
Ridin high  
Winter nights  
Warm and dry  
Youve earned your space buddy  
Youve done your time  
How come youve got no  
Peace of mind  
  
Lots of work  
Everywhere  
Lots of money honey  
Gettin your share  
The folks back home say  
Theyd love to be in your shoes so  
How come youve got those  
Boomtown blues  
  
You cant miss that freezin rain  
Youd have to be insane  
To head back north  
And go through all that again  
  
No chill in the air  
No morning dew  
No change of seasons  
The sky always seems so blue  
The earth aint black and  
The wind aint cold  
All of a sudden now  
You feel so old  
  
Somethins wrong  
And its cuttin deep  
Youre feelin restless and its  
Hard to sleep  
Look what you win but  
Look what you lose  
Stuck here in Heaven  
With these Boomtown blues
