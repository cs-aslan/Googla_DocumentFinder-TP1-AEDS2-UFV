Love is strong and youre so sweet  
You make me hard you make me weak  
Love is strong and youre so sweet  
And some day babe we got to meet  
  
A glimpse of you was all it took  
A strangers glance it got me hooked  
And I followed you across the stars  
I looked for you in seedy bars  
  
What are you scared of baby  
Its more than just a dream  
I need some time  
We make a beautiful team  
A beautiful team  
  
Love is strong and youre so sweet  
And some day babe we got to meet  
Just anywhere out in the park  
Out on the street and in the dark  
  
I followed you through swirling seas  
Down darkened woods with silent trees  
Your love is strong and your so sweet  
You make me hard you make me weak  
  
Its more than just a dream  
I need some time  
We make a beautiful team  
A beautiful team  
  
I wait for you until the dawn  
My mind is ripped my heart is torn  
And love is strong and your so sweet  
Your love is bitter and taken neat  
  
Love is strong and youre so sweet
