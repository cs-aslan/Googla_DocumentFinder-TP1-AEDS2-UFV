Once my love was good enough  
True happiness we knew  
Then fame and fortune came your way  
And made a change in you  
Youll find your ladder of success  
Is not on solid ground  
And when it starts to tumble  
Pick me up on your way down  
Pick me up when dreams are shattered  
When false friends cannot be found  
For you know Ill still be waiting  
Pick me up on your way down  
Youve hit the top but it wont last  
Theres just one way to go  
The world youve chosen is not real  
These things youll come to know  
When folks say they dont know you  
And youve lost your final round  
When you find that you are lonely  
Pick me up on your way down  
Pick me up when dreams are shattered  
When false friends cannot be found  
For you know Ill still be waiting  
Pick me up on your way down
