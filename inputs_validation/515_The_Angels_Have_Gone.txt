515  
Im changing trains  
This little town  
Let me down  
This foreign rain  
Brings me down  
  
515  
Train overdue  
Angels have gone  
No ticket  
Im jumping tracks  
Im changing towns  
We never talk anymore  
Forever I will adore you  
  
515  
All of my life  
Angels have gone  
Im changing trains  
Angels like them  
Thin on the ground  
All of my life  
All legs and wings  
Strange sandy eyes  
  
515  
Train overdue  
Angels have gone  
We never talk anymore  
Forever I will adore you  
Cold station  
All of my life  
Forever Im out here forever
