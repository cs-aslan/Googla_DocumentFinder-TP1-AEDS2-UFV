Where will I wander and wonder  
Nobody knows  
But wherever Im agoing Ill go  
In search of a rose  
  
Whatever the will of the weather  
And whether it shines or snows  
Wherever Im agoing Ill go  
In search of a rose  
  
I dont know where its found  
I dont mind  
As long as the world spins around  
Ill take my time  
  
Ill savour the softness of summer  
Ill wrap up when winter blows  
And wherever Im going Ill go  
In search of a rose
