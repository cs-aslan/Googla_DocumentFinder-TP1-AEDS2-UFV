With all these corks we might need to have the base looked at  
So pop the hood and see whats good I need to a toolin man  
My precious love Im on a roll but my transmissions blown  
I heard a thumpin on the lot  
  
I hear you work in a body shop  
I hear you work in a body shop  
  
You can keep it overnight  
You can do whatever you like  
Working overtime  
Working on the line  
  
You can polish the headlights  
You can smooth out the fender  
You can start the ignition  
We can go on a bender  
  
Stuck to the seat our body heat what will you do with those ice  
This should  get outta here was steppin on the gas  
We gotta bounce were gone past lets let the seat go back  
You take the wheel Ill sit on top  
  
I hear you work in a body shop  
I hear you work in a body shop  
  
You can keep it overnight  
You can do whatever you like  
Working overtime  
Working on the line  
  
You can keep it overnight  
You can do whatever you like  
Working overtime  
Working on the line  
  
Ill work on the engine  
Like we blew a gasket  
Tighten up the suspension  
And you dont have to ask it  
  
I hear you work in a body shop  
I hear you work in a body shop  
  
I would drive to the ends of the Earth for you  
Jumpstart my heart you know what you gotta do  
I would ride through the dark of the night with you  
Cross my heart and hope to die its true  
  
You can keep it overnight  
You can do whatever you like  
Working overtime  
Working on the line  
  
You can keep it overnight  
You can do whatever you like  
Working overtime  
Working on the line  
  
You can polish the headlights  
You can smooth out the fender  
You can start the ignition  
We can go on a bender  
  
I hear you work in a body shop
