Whoa  
  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
Im changing lanes and talkin on the phone  
Drivin way too fast  
And the interstates jammed with gunners like me  
Afraid of comin in last  
But somewhere in the race we run  
Were coming undone  
  
Chorus  
And days go by  
I can feel em flyin  
Like a hand out the window in the wind  
The cars go by  
Yeah its all weve been given  
So you better start livin right now  
Cause days go by  
Oh and a woohoo  
  
Out on the roof just the other night  
I watched the world flash by  
Headlights taillights  
Running through a river of neon signs  
But somewhere in the rush I felt  
Were losing ourselves  
  
And days go by  
I can feel em flyin  
Like a hand out the window in the wind  
The cars go by  
Yeah its all weve been given  
So you better start livin right now  
Days go by  
Oh and a woohoo  
Yeah the days go by  
Oh and a woohoo  
  
We think about tomorrow then it slips away  
Oh yes it does  
We talk about forever but weve only got today  
  
And the days go by  
I can feel em flyin  
Like a hand out the window as the cars go by  
Yeah its all weve been given  
So you better start livin  
You better start livin  
Better start livin right now  
  
Cause days go by  
I can feel em flyin  
Like a hand out the window in the wind  
The cars go by  
Yeah its all weve been given  
So you better start livin right now  
Cause days go by  
Oh and a woohoo  
Yeah these days go by  
Oh and a woohoo  
  
Oh  
So take em by the hand  
Theyre yours and mine  
Take em by the hand  
And live your life  
Take em by the hand  
Dont let em all fly by  
  
Come on come on now  
Yeah  
Come on now  
Oh and a woohoo  
Dont you know the days go by
