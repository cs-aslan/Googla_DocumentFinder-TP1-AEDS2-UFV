Why am I forgotten by the girl I love because my clothes hang on me like a
sack  
I know Im not athletic and look a bit pathetic and wear most of my chest
upon my back  
The nations got an A1 plan and I might turn into a man  
If Id Biceps Muscle and Brawn  
  
Id grow spinach on my chest where the birds could build a nest  
If Id Biceps Muscle and Brawn  
In competitions exhibitions Catch as Catch Catch  
I would win some lovely cups and saucers to match  
The girls would all love my physique Id let them see it twice a week  
If Id Biceps Muscle and Brawn  
  
My ribs at knock knock wouldnt play or rattle on a windy day  
If Id Biceps Muscle and Brawn  
Hercules was far from slim but I could show them more than him  
If Id Biceps Muscle and Brawn  
In competitions exhibitions Catch as Catch Catch  
I would win some lovely cups and sauces to match  
  
The ladies white hope I would be theyd hope to see much more of me  
If Id Biceps Muscle and Brawn  
Id look swell when out of doors in my fifty bob plus fours  
If Id Biceps Muscle and Brawn  
  
My photo in the press youd see to show what bile beans did for me  
If Id Biceps Muscle and Brawn  
In competitions exhibitions Catch as Catch Catch  
I would win some lovely cups and sauces to match  
Id have strength to carry on and something good to sit upon  
If Id Biceps Muscle and Brawn
