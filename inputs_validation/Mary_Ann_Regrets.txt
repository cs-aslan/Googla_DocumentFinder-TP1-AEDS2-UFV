I saved up my money to buy my sweetheart some flowers  
For Saturdays date and I restlessly counted the hours  
Then today in the mail I received a short little note  
And I broke down inside at the message that her mothers wrote  
Mary Ann regrets shes unable to see you again  
Were leaving for Europe next week shell be busy till then  
They know that she loves me but poor boys dont fit in their plans  
Goodbye true love goodbye my sweet Mary Ann  
The weeks have gone by not a word have I heard since then  
In the papers I read of the far away places shes been  
I cant eat I cant sleep for over and over again  
My mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann  
My Mary Ann died they said she just wasted away  
If I could have seen her I know shed be living today  
For we loved each other and if they had left us alone  
Today shed be wearing my ring not a blanket of stone  
Mary Ann regrets
