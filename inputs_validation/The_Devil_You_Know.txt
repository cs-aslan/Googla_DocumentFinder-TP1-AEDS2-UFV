Its all right  
Everything is fine  
You live the perfect life  
Never one immoral thought inside your mind  
  
What they say  
Does it make you feel ashamed  
Isnt everyone the same  
Does it matter that it wasnt your idea  
God is a man  
You know for certain  
The knowledge in and of itself  
Is more than we deserve  
  
So youve tried  
And youve made up your mind  
Somethings still not right  
The devil you dont know is still outside
