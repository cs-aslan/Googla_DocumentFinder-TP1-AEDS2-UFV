I would love to tour the Southland  
In a traveling minstrel show  
Yes Id love to tour the Southland  
In a traveling minstrel show  
Yes Im dying to be a star and make them laugh  
Sound just like a record on the phonograph  
Those days are gone forever  
Over a long time ago oh yeah  
I have never met Napoleon  
But I plan to find the time  
I have never met Napoleon  
But I plan to find the time  
Cause he looks so fine upon that hill  
They tell me he was lonely hes lonely still  
Those days are gone forever  
Over a long time ago oh yeah  
  
I stepped up on the platform  
The man gave me the news  
He said You must be joking son  
Where did you get those shoes  
Where did you get those shoes  
  
Well Ive seen em on the TV the movie show  
They say the times are changing but I just dont know  
These things are gone forever  
Over a long time ago oh yeah
