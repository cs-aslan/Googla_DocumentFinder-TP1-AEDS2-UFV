The lights around the Christmas tree dont burn as bright  
And all around the world it isnt a silent night  
Outside I hear the voices sing the sweetest sounds of caroling  
But somehow theres a sadness in the song  
In our hearts we know that somethings wrong  
  
Chorus  
Its a different kind of Christmas  
In a different kind of world  
Even though it looks the same  
  
Everything has changed  
Its a different kind of Christmas  
  
Children opening gifts with wonder and surprise  
I wish that I could still see through such innocent eyes  
I used to feel so safe inside I had a place to run and hide  
In my daddys arms I felt secure  
No one can protect us anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
Everything has changed  
Its a different kind of Christmas  
  
Sending cards that talk of peace and love and cheer  
Oh thats what we need if wed only believe  
It would be  
  
Chorus  
  
Everything has changed  
Its a different kind of Christmas
