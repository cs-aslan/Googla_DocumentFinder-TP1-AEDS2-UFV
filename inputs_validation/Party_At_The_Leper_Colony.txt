Finger food and an ice cold keg  
It wont cost you an arm and a leg  
Dance all night to a rotten band  
Come on people lets give em a hand  
  
Saturday night its the place to be  
Everybody cut footloose with me  
At the party at the leper colony  
Oh theres a party at the leper colony  
Hey  
  
Met a little lady so pretty and young  
She was quite a little talker till the cat got her tongue  
She oozed up beside me I turned on my charm  
Well pretty soon she was completely disarmed  
  
I said Girl now dont fall to pieces on me  
But she cried her eyes out  literally  
At the party at the leper colony  
Oh theres a party at the leper colony  
Hey hey  
  
Hey now buddy dont you give me no lip  
Sorry I was using your head for dip  
Theres a guy in the hot tub I dont know who  
Wait a minute it looks like Stu  
  
Well hold the phone now what do I see  
Another pretty mama got her eye on me  
At the party at the leper colony  
Oh theres a party at the leper colony  
  
Theres a party at the leper colony  
Party at the leper colony  
Theres a party at the leper colony  
Party at the leper colony  
  
Oh theres a party at the leper colony  
Yeah party at the leper colony  
Well theres a party at the leper colony  
Party at the leper colony  
Hey
