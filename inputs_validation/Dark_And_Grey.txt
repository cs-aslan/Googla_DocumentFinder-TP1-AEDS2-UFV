Fuck off  
  
Unlike me youre gonna run away  
Unlike me youll see another day  
Run like me out on the highway  
I will ride so faaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrr  
Ill probably never make it therrreee  
  
I never went to college I aint got no skills  
I got hair to my shoulders and a bottle of pills  
I got bills stacked up like a turkey club  
I blew my last dime drinkin at the local pub  
  
I am not sunshine  
I am dark and grey  
For this life of sins  
I live each day I pay  
I am not Jesus  
But I died in vain  
Only to relive each day Ill pay  
  
Unlike me youre gonna run away  
Unlike me youll see another day  
Run like me out on the highway  
I will ride so faaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrr  
Ill probably never make it therrrreeee  
  
Rock rock yall  
Rock yall  
To the beat yall  
Ah to the beat yall  
Check it out yall  
Check it out yall  
You cant stop yall  
You cant stop yall  
Rock rock yall  
Rock yall  
To the beat yall  
Ah to the beat yall  
Check it out yall  
Check it out yall  
You come alive yall  
Alive yall  
Come on  
  
I never felt at home although I grew up loved  
I got a junkies mind in a ramblin mans blood  
Got a flood full of thoughts thats caught in a dam  
Somedays Im gone but thats where I am  
Im fit to slip another rippin rhyme  
Im so ahead of the game I feel left behind  
Another dime to boost I got boots of lead  
Hope I live to see this virus spread  
  
I am not sunshine  
I am dark and grey  
For this life of sins I live  
Each day I pay  
I am not Jesus  
But I died in vain  
Only to relive each day I pay  
  
Unlike me youre gonna run away  
Unlike me youll see another day  
Run like me out on the highway  
I will ride so faaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrr  
Ill probably never make it there  
  
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
