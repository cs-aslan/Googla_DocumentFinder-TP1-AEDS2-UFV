Its probably whats best for you  
I only want the best for you  
And if Im not the best then youre stuck  
  
I tried to sever ties and I  
Ended up with wounds to bind  
Like youre pouring salt in my cuts  
  
And I just ran out of bandaids  
I dont even know where to start  
Cause you can bandage the damage  
You never really can fix a heart  
  
Even though I know its wrong  
How could I be so sure  
If you never say what you feel feel  
I must have held your hand so tight  
You didnt have the will to fight  
I guess you needed more time to heal  
  
Baby I just ran out of bandaids  
I dont even know where to start  
Cause you can bandage the damage  
You never really can fix a heart  
  
Oh oh woh oh woh oh ah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh yea  
Oh oh woh oh woh oh ah  
Oh oh yah ya ya  
Yah  
  
You must be a miracle worker  
Swearing up and down that you can fix whats broken yeah  
Please dont get my hopes up no no  
Baby tell me how could you be so cruel  
  
Its like you pouring salt on my cuts  
  
Baby I just ran out of bandaids  
I dont even know where to start  
Cause you can bandage the damage  
You never really can fix a heart  
  
Baby I just ran out of bandaids  
I dont even know where to start  
Cause you can bandage the damage  
You never really can fix a heart  
Oh no no no  
You never really can fix a heart  
Oh no no no  
You never really can fix a heart  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh ya oh ah  
Oh oh oh oh  
You never really can fix my heart
