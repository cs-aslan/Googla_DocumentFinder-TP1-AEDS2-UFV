Theres a new moon over my shoulder  
And an old love still in my heart  
I remember now that Im older  
What you told me the day we had to part  
You promised with the new moon  
Youd be coming back to me  
Now many moons have passed  
Since then Im waiting patiently  
Theres a new moon over my shoulder  
And an old love still in my heart  
So Ill keep on praying  
For your safe return someday  
And that well be the same sweethearts  
As when you went away  
Theres a new moon over my shoulder  
And an old love still in my heart
