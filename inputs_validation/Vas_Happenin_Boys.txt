There once was a group with Liam and Niall  
Vas Happenin boys Vas Happenin boys  
  
They lived with Zayn and their room was vile  
Vas Happenin boys Vas Happenin boys  
  
Did you know Harrys such a slob  
He needs to win X Factor cause he cant get a job  
And Oh Louis needs a boat  
He dresses like he owns one  
Cause hes got no other clothes  
They really need your vote  
Vas Happenin boys Vas Happenin boys  
  
Mick Jagger could be Harrys dad  
Vas Happenin mum Vas Happenin Mick  
  
When Liam sings he makes his face look sad  
Vas Happenin song Vas Happenin sad  
  
And Zayns the master of echoes  
And Niall was raised by leprechauns  
So he wont ever grow  
And Oh Louis needs that boat  
He dresses like he owns one  
And its becoming a joke  
They really need your vote  
  
Vas Happenin boys Vas Happenin boys  
Vas Happenin boys Vas Happenin boys  
Vas Happenin boys Vas Happenin boys
