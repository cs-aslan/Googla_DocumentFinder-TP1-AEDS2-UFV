Im sittin here stoned at Tortilla Jos  
Nobody knows my name and thats alright with me  
She said adios so I said hello  
Don Julio top shelf self help remedy  
  
Sure was good to know you  
I still wanna hold ya  
But I know its over  
You aint coming back  
This aint California  
Im somewhere south of the border  
Im in a mexicoma  
My my my my my my mexicoma  
I know it over  
But the sun still shines on a fool like me  
  
You pulled the plug on what I thought was love  
But I got just enough juice to forget about you and squeeze this lime  
I can see the ocean I can see the ocean  
I can feel the breeze I can feel the breeze  
Almost cant remember how you left me down here on my knees  
  
Sure was good to know you  
I still wanna hold ya  
But I know its over  
You aint coming back  
This aint Oklahoma  
Im somewhere south of the border  
Im in a mexicoma  
My my my my my my mexicoma  
I know it over  
But the sun still shines on a fool like me  
  
Im sittin here stoned at Tortilla Jos  
And nobody knows my name and thats alright with me  
  
My my my my my my mexicoma  
I know it over  
Im in a mexicoma  
My my my my my my mexicoma  
I know it over  
Im in a mexicoma  
My my my my my my mexicoma  
I know it over  
Im in a mexicoma  
My my my my my my mexicoma  
I know it over  
But the sun still shines on a fool like me
