I said how could I write so great beautiful songs  
Someone now thinks Caton wrote them all  
Now I like to speak just about silly things I said  
So today the smurfs again  
How can they be so blue so short so sweet  
Smurf youre like me were three apples tall at least  
But if you ask me why  
I dont know I dont know I dont know  
  
But maybe thats the new concept  
Where the smurfs are like the bees in the garden now  
They live in mushrooms the new sin symbols  
And where the smurfettes forced to sell her  
But how  
Said how  
  
They forced you to submit your soul  
Poor lady in blue she sings  
  
Small shy oh my oh my  
Wont even try  
To make something out of himself  
And if you look please smile  
Hell run a mile  
The poor little silly shy smurf  
  
The smurfette is the Mary Magdalene  
Gargamel is the Bush America  
And if you ask me why  
I dont know I dont know I dont know  
  
And so in my new concept  
The smurfette is risen as feminine  
The smurfs are the archetype  
Of what societies could be  
And Id like to live in mushrooms  
Ill come with you little silly smurfs  
Smurfette dont be worried  
Of being the only woman now  
  
Ill be with you in these dark nights  
When theyll try to submit you  
Poor lady in blue  
Well be together
