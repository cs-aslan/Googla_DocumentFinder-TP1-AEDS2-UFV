Can you tell the moment  
Spring becomes the summer  
Maybe its a moment  
Only known to a tree  
  
Even as were watching  
Blades of grass are growing  
Leaps and bounds so tiny  
That our eyes cannot see  
  
And how does a bud  
Decide its a rose  
Perhaps theres a time  
When it somehow knows it  
  
Can you tell the moment  
If theres such a moment  
When you just become  
What you were not before  
  
Is there any sign or warning  
Or do you awake one morning  
Knowing that you must have turned  
A special corner  
  
Maybe in an April shower  
Something tells a bud to flower  
What is it that tells you  
Youre a child no more
