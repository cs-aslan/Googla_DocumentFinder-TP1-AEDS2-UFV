Well somebody walked up to me  
But I didnt know what to do  
And then somebody said hello to me  
But I didnt know what to do  
Because I think  
That my words will get twisted  
So I bend my back over  
Take a gulp  
Be funny  
Cause I know theres nothin I can do  
  
Then my mother tried to pick me up  
As I was sittin down on the ground  
Something forced my little eyes come open  
But I couldnt make out the sound  
It doesnt matter cause my eyes are lyin  
And they dont have emotion  
Dont want to be social  
Cant take it when they hate me  
But I know theres nothin I can do  
  
When my thoughts start to feel like mine  
Theyre taken from me  
It seems to happen every time  
And the feelings that are fine for you  
Theres somebody there who doesnt think they are true  
So think of something new  
Theres nothing left to do  
  
And then my idols walk next to me  
I look up at them they fade away  
Its a destruction of a mystery  
The more I listen to what they say  
So does that mean thats theres no more doin  
And theres no more thinkin  
And theres no more feelin  
Cause theres no right opinion  
So can you tell me what Im supposed to do
