Every beach has a clown who thinks he knows it all hangten outta santa fe
when surf comes out tomorrow lets go  
And hes always practicing his cowabunga call cowabunga  
But hell never scramble when the big waves start to roll  
Cause theres nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
Theres nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
The kids always know that gremmies talk is cheap ride the hulahan over the
pipeline bonsai to the saddle bowl  
Oh they just try to ignore this ugly creep cowabunga  
His board is always full of dings  
Cause hes always doing stupid things  
And theres nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
Theres nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
Gremmie out of control  
Theres nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
Theres nothing worse than a gremmie out of control  
Theres nothing worse than a gremmie out of control
