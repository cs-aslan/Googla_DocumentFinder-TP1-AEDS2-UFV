If I hear you stalkin  
Looking for sympathy  
You just keep on walkin  
Actin like you dont know me  
Aint nothin new for you  
Honey what you put me through  
Seven years ago today  
There aint no other way  
  
Once bitten now two cents shy  
Almost the apple of your daddys eye  
  
But your love  
Your loves gone bad  
Yea yea yea  
Your love  
Your loves gone bad  
  
If I hear you talkin  
Gettin in my ear  
Listen to the words I say  
Let me make this very clear  
Dont ask for money  
Dont you think my name  
Everything was sunny  
Dream about it aint the same  
  
Once bitten now two cents shy  
Almost the apple of your daddys eye  
  
But your love  
Your loves gone bad  
Yea yea yea  
Your love  
Your loves gone bad  
  
Once bitten now two cents shy  
Almost the apple of your daddys eye  
  
But your love  
Your loves gone bad  
Yea yea yea  
Your love  
Your loves gone bad your love  
Your loves gone bad  
Yea yea yea  
Your loves gone bad  
  
Your loves gone bad  
Your loves gone bad  
So bad
