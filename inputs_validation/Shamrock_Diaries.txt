In waves of people you can lose your feet  
Youve got to stay hard to the ground  
It gets so easy now to lose your way  
When youre ever outward bound  
A church bell ringing in the fading light  
Stops you dead like a cold steel wall  
The ghost of yesteryears is toughing you  
And as sure as God youll fall  
And I see me and I see you  
I see it all just like it used to be  
And all the reasons why it started out  
Hit you hard with every bell  
The choir practice in the empty hall  
Is a sound that you know so well  
Like something lost inside your overcoat  
You find it later by mistake  
You lost it all a thousand years ago  
And you pray its not too late  
And I see me and I see you  
I see it all just like it used to be  
And I see me and I see you  
I see it all just like a diary  
  
Now I remember everything  
Yea I remember how it used to be  
With every note that choirboy sings  
And I see me and I see you  
I see it all just like it used to be
