You sure have a pretty smile  
It sure has been a while  
Since Ive felt your touch  
Youve got the sweetest way  
I think about you every day  
I miss you so much  
  
Chorus  
Oh my pretty little Adriana  
Are you lonesome tonight  
Oh my pretty little Adriana  
Ill find you when it all feels right  
  
Youre so soft and innocent  
The sweetest night I ever spent  
Was being held in your embrace  
Youre such a gentle soul  
Its killing me to know  
When will I see your face
