Im a ghost in the dark and Im yours  
I belong in the past and Im yours  
Like a song you forget and Im yours  
Like a dream in the night and Im yours  
  
The wrong place  
The wrong time  
I dont know  
The wrong face  
Yours or mine  
I dont know  
  
Like a tear when you sleep Ill be yours  
Like a scar that wont fade Ill be yours  
Like a pain in the cold Ill be yours  
Like a fear in the heart Ill be yours  
  
The wrong word when you cry  
I will be  
Like the seed of a lie  
I will be  
Like the germ of disease  
I will be  
Like the last one who cared  
I will be  
  
Like your shadow  
I will haunt you  
Do you remember  
I said to you  
Love is a mountain  
But harder to climb  
It should be forever  
But love is unkind  
To me  
Dont let me down  
  
And you let me down
