I walk along the street  
I look into your eyes  
Im pleasant when we meet  
Im there when you go home  
How many times before  
Could you tell I didnt care  
When you turned your back on me  
I knew wed get nowhere  
Do you believe in youth  
The history of all truth  
A heart thats left at home  
Becomes a heart of stone  
  
Do you believe in truth  
The lies we told of youth  
A cause we call our own  
Beside an empty throne  
How many times before  
Could you tell I didnt care  
When you reached out in your sleep  
And you knew I wasnt there  
My eyes are made of stone  
Just like your sordid home  
How many times before  
Did you leave my soul alone
