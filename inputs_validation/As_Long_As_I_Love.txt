Hurt is no stranger to me  
And oh how well I know misery  
Youve always hurt me  
But I always forgive  
And Ill hurt for as long as I love you  
And Ill love you for as long as I live  
Oh its my fault for loving you so deeply  
Id give you my love completely  
Id give you love but hurt is all you give  
And I hurt for as long as I love you  
And Ill love you for as long as I live  
  
For as long as I love you therell be pain  
Though tears come and go  
My love remains the same  
Ill always forgive you  
You know that I will  
And I hurt for as long as I love you  
And Ill love you for as long as I live  
  
Yes Ive hurt for as long as I loved you  
And Ill love you for as long as I live
