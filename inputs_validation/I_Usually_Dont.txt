Uh uh uh  
Yeah yeah yeah ha ha  
I beep my horn and they come to the car  
Damn right they come to a stall  
Thats right it come with the car  
Now tell your boss you cant come in tomorrow  
My dro come by the jar  
They bring me drinks why come by the bar  
Nah nigga I aint come here to spar  
These hallow tips will come where you are  
I stomp through smooth with the soldiers  
Two steppin movin my shoulders  
Now the moneys rollin in  
We got bottles lined up like bowlin pins  
Mami you standin with a slouch  
Starin at me while Im standin on the couch  
Come and get in the blue flames  
Have a sip of this blue shit and lets rock  
Now you know I dont usually do this  
But you lookin good tonight  
And you know I dont usually do this  
But you gon smoke tonight  
And you know I dont usually do this  
But you gon drink tonight  
And you know I dont usually do this  
But you gon fuck tonight  
Now whos hot Whos not  
I can take the few shots youve got  
I can burn a few knots youve got  
I can blow the few spots youve got  
But I chill I will  
Get it to poppin whenever I feel  
I still shut it down  
And I white and yellow stud it down  
Watch them pretty girls strut it round  
Take the birdies and putt it down  
Like Tiger Woods did it but Im hood with it  
Youve never seen a thug look as good with it  
And I promise that fuck with me  
You better move where Osamas at  
You see Im in here with the white ones on  
Tryin to get fucked up for the lights come on lets go  
Now you know I dont usually do this  
But you lookin good tonight  
And you know I dont usually do this  
But you gon smoke tonight  
And you know I dont usually do this  
But you gon drink tonight  
And you know I dont usually do this  
But you gon fuck tonight
