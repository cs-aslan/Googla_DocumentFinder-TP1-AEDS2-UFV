Catch me as I fall  
Say youre here and its all over now  
Speaking to the atmosphere  
No ones here and I fall into myself  
  
This truth drives me  
Into madness  
I know I can stop the pain  
If I will it all away  
  
Chorus  
Dont turn away  
Dont give in to the pain  
Dont try to hide  
Though theyre screaming your name  
Dont close your eyes  
God knows what lies behind them  
Dont turn out the light  
Never sleep never die  
  
Im frightened by what I see  
But somehow I know  
That theres much more to come  
Immobilized by my fear  
  
And soon to be  
Blinded by tears  
I can stop the pain  
If I will it all away  
  
Chorus  
  
Fallen angels at my feet  
Whispered voices at my ear  
Death before my eyes  
Lying next to me I fear  
  
She beckons me  
Shall I give in  
Upon my end shall I begin  
Forsaking all Ive fallen for  
I rise to meet my end  
  
Chorus x3
