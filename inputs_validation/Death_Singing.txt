In the strawcolored light  
In light rapidly changing  
On a life rapidly fading  
  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
  
With a throat smooth as a lamb  
Yet dry as a branch not snapping  
He throws back his head  
And he does not sing a thing mournful  
  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
In the strawcolored light  
  
He sings a black embrade  
And white opals swimming  
In a childs leather purse  
Have you seen death swimming  
Have you seen death swimming  
  
With a throat smooth as a lamb  
  
Yet dry as a branch not snapping  
He throws back his head  
And he does not sing a thing mournful  
  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
In the strawcolored light  
  
He sings of youth enraged  
And the burning of Atlanta  
And these viral times  
And May ribbons streaming  
And strawcolored curls aturning  
A mothers vain delight  
And woe to the sun  
And woe to the young  
Another hearse is drawn  
Have you seen death singing  
In the strawcolored light
