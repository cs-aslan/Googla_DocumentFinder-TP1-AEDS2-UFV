This is Rock n roll radio  
Come on lets rock n roll with the Ramones  
  
Chorus  
Rockn rock n roll radio  
Lets go  
Rockn rock N roll radio  
Lets go  
Rockn rock N roll radio  
Lets go  
Rockn rock N roll radio  
Lets go  
  
Do you remember Hullabaloo  
Upbeat Shindig and Ed Sullivan too  
Do you remember rock n roll radio  
Do you remember rock n roll radio  
  
Do you remember Murray the Kid  
Alan Freed and High Energy  
Its the end the end of the seventies  
Its the end the end of the century  
  
Do you remember lying in bed  
With the covers pulled up over your head  
Radio playin so no one can see  
We need change and we need it fast  
Before rocks just part of the past  
Cause lately it all sounds the same to me  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Will you remember Jerry Lee  
John Lennon T Rex and old Moulty  
Its the end the end of the seventies  
Its the end the end of the century  
  
Do you remember lying in bed  
With the covers pulled up over your head  
Radio playin so no one can see  
We need change and we need it fast  
Before Rocks just part of the past  
Cause lately it all sounds the same to me  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Chorus  
  
This is rock N roll radio  
Stay tuned for more rock n roll
