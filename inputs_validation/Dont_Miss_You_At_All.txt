As I sit and watch the snow  
Fallin down  
I dont miss you at all  
I hear children playin laughin so loud  
I dont think of your smile  
  
So if you never come to me  
Youll stay a distant memory  
Out my window I see lights going dark  
Your dark eyes dont haunt me  
  
And then I wonder who I am  
Without the warm touch of your hand  
  
And then I wonder who I am  
Without the warm touch of your hand  
As I sit and watch the snow  
Fallin down  
  
I dont miss you at all  
I dont miss you at all  
I dont miss you at all
