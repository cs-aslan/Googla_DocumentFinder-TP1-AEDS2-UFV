Buona sera senorita buona sera  
It is time to say goodnight to Napoli  
Though its hard for us to whisper Buena Sera  
With that old moon above the Mediterranean sea  
  
In the morning senorita well go walking  
Where the mountains and the sun come into sight  
By the little jewlershop we stop and linger  
While I buy a wedding ring for your finger  
  
In the meantime did I tell you that I love you  
Buona sera signorita kiss me good night
