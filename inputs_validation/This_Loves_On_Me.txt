Sittin alone at a table for two when she walked in  
I was down on my second love  
Swore Id never do that again  
She sat down beside me and tried to explain  
That two bad loves dont spoil the whole darn game  
  
The first love lies  
The second lover hurts you deep inside  
Now that youre free  
This loves on me  
  
I thought my life was at the end of its rope  
Without true love there could be no hope  
Then she asked if I would stay for the night  
She said everythings gonna be all right  
The sun came up the very next day  
I knew what she meant when I heard her say  
  
The first love lies  
The second lover hurts you deep inside  
Now that youre free  
This loves on me  
  
She sat down beside me and tried to explain  
That two bad loves dont spoil the whole darn game  
  
The first love lies  
The second lover hurts you deep inside  
Now that youre free  
This loves on me  
  
This loves on me  
Im gonna love away your misery  
Soon you will see  
This loves on me  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
This loves on me  
Im gonna love away your misery  
Now that you see  
This loves on me
