Ooh weve got a live one featherweight icon  
Heroes let im down so he sleeps with the  
Light on  
And theres nothin left to do but kneel down  
And pray  
Sail away with Caesar if youre a non believer  
Everybody get high if youre a  
Diamond geezer  
Its the devil that needs ya so go out and play  
  
Blame yourself its easier  
Theres no need to trouble her you trouble her  
  
Jesus in a camper van he said sorry to  
Leave you but Ive done all I can  
I suppose even the son of God  
Gets it hard sometimes  
Especially when he goes round  
Saying I am the way  
  
And now its four in the mornin yes yes yall in  
No one can shoot but everybodys scoring  
Trust me its boring get down and pray  
  
They told you not to meddle with the bass and the treble  
Theres dust on your needle and you think that  
Youre a rebel  
  
Youre Evel Knievel so get down and pray  
Blame yourself its easier  
Theres no need to trouble her you trouble her  
  
Jesus in a camper van he said sorry to  
Leave you but Ive done all I can  
I suppose even the son of God  
Gets it hard sometimes  
Especially when he goes round  
Saying I am the way  
  
I am the way I am the way I am the way  
I am I am I am I am I am I am the way  
  
Jesus in a camper van he said sorry to  
Leave you but Ive done all I can  
I suppose even the son of God  
Gets it hard sometimes  
  
Jesus in a camper van he said sorry to
