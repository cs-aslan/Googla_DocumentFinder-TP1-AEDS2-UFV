Just say I love her  
Ive loved her from the start  
And tell her how Im yearning  
To say whats in my heart  
  
Just say I need her  
As roses need the rain  
And tell her that without her  
My dreams are all in vain  
  
If you should chance to meet her  
Anytime anywhere  
I was a fool to leave her  
Tell her how much a fool can care  
And if she tells you  
Shes lonely now and then  
Wont you just say I love her  
And want her back again  
  
Wont you just say I love her  
And want her back again
