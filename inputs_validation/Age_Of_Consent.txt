Wont you please let me go  
These words lie inside they hurt me so  
And Im not the kind that likes to tell you  
Just what I want to do  
Im not the kind that needs to tell you  
Just what you want me to  
  
I saw you this morning I thought that you might like to know  
I received your message in full a few days ago  
I understood every word that it said  
And now that Ive actually heard it youre going to regret  
  
And Im not the kind that likes to tell you  
Just what you want me to  
Youre not the kind that needs to tell me  
About the birds and the bees  
  
Do you find this happens all the time  
Crucial point one day becomes a crime  
And Im not the kind that likes to tell you  
Just what I want to do  
Im not the kind that needs to tell you  
  
Ive lost you Ive lost you  
Ive lost you Ive lost you  
Ive lost you  
  
Ive lost you Ive lost you  
Ive lost you Ive lost you  
Ive lost you  
  
Ive lost you Ive lost you  
Ive lost you Ive lost you  
Ive lost you
