Someone is talking  
But its not conversation  
Sounds more like a voice in my head  
It says  
I live in nightmares  
Im the new god of panic  
And Im waiting for you to come home to me  
  
So boy welcome to sleep  
Im gonna make you make you make you bleed  
  
I could be dreaming  
But then maybe thats fatal  
Theres nowhere to hide in your dreams  
Im so uneasy  
Im shaking and nervous  
Im alone in my room and Im scared of it  
  
So dont let me sleep  
Its gonna make me make me make me bleed  
  
My mother told me  
Dont believe in ghost stories  
Theres nothing to hurt you in here  
But she was wrong  
And now its come back to haunt me  
It says it wont leave me alive for long  
  
I dont want to sleep  
Its gonna make me make me make me bleed
