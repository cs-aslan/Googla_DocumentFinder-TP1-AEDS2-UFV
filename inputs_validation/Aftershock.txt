I dont care about the way that ya treated me  
And I aint crying bout the love Im paying for  
No I aint bitching bout the things  
You putting down here in the street  
No I aint going round saying things  
About you I cant repeat  
Hey it aint gonna change overnight  
No and it aint going away without a fight  
No now I aint saying that Im never gonna beg you oh baby come back  
But right now baby  
I dont really want to see your face  
Yeah and thats a fact  
Right now honey  
All I know is what Im feeling inside  
Right now honey  
Im alone and Im swallowing a lot  
Of pride  
And it aint gonna change  
Overnight no  
And it aint goin away without  
A fight  
Living with the aftershock  
Why why why I never thought  
Shed walk  
But now Im living with the  
Aftershock  
And it aint gonna change  
It aint goin away no  
Yeah she opened up my eyes  
Seeing what I want to see  
She kinda took me by surprise  
Showed me what I hadnt seen  
Yeah yeah  
Living with the aftershock  
Yeah yeah living with the aftershock  
My my my I guess that I never  
Thought shed walk  
Living with the aftershock  
And it aint gonna change  
It aint goin away  
I said it aint gonna change without  
A fight  
Im living with the aftershock  
Im living with the aftershock  
Never gonna change
