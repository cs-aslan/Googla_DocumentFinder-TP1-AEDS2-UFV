A busy life keeps a body busy  
With so many same old things to do  
So why not stop a while and take a good look around  
Maybe you will find out something new to you  
Like how do the trees make noises  
And where does the wind come from  
When and why do dragonflies say Hey whats going onA busy life keeps a
body busy  
If you never take the time of day  
To ask yourself Is there something else  
And maybe find the answers just a stones throw away  
A busy life keeps a body busy
