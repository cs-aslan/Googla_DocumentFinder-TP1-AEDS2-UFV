Who wouldve known  
This heart would stumble on someone  
As great as you  
Out of the blue  
  
Who wouldve guessed  
That I would fall so deep  
In a hope as true  
As the one I found in You  
  
Heavens hands  
Lead me to faiths open door  
Im surrounded by a grace  
This soul just cant ignore  
  
Chorus  
Lord Im Living in a love like not other  
Lost in mercy like Ive never known  
Lord Im trusting in a love like no other  
To lead me on  
  
Who wouldve cared  
Enough to reach beyond my thin disguise  
To heal my life  
Who wouldve dared  
  
To wear the shame I carried deep inside  
To be my sacrifice  
Saving me  
From myself in the nick of time  
  
Forgiveness found  
Its way into this heart of mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Unconditionally  
You embrace all that I am  
Its beyond all reason  
Its a love Ill never understand  
  
Chorus
