Ive blessed the day I found you  
I want to stay around you  
And so I beg you  
Let it be me  
  
Dont take this heaven from one  
If you must cling to someone  
Now and forever  
Let it be me  
  
Each time we meet love  
I find complete love  
Without your sweet love  
What would life be  
  
So never leave me lonely  
Tell me you love me only  
And that youll always  
Let it be me  
  
Each time we meet love  
I find complete love  
Without your sweet love  
What would life be  
  
So never leave me lonely  
Tell me you love me only  
And that youll always  
Let it be me  
  
And that youll always  
Let it be me
