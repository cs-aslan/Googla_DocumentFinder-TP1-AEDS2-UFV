Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park  
Do you ever get the feeling  
That youre missing the mark  
Its so cold its so cold  
Its so cold its so cold  
  
Written up in marker on a factory sign  
I struggle with the feeling  
That my life isnt mine  
Its so cold its so cold  
Its so cold its so cold  
  
See the arrow that they shot trying  
To tear us apart took the fire from my belly and  
The beat from my heart  
Still I wont let go  
Still I wont let go  
  
You ooh ooh  
Oh you use your heart as a weapon  
And it hurts like heaven  
  
On every street every car every surface in nature  
And at the streets are rising and youd rather sing  
Dont let them take control  
No we wont let em take control  
  
Yes I feel a little bit nervous  
Yes I feel nervous and I cannot relax  
Im coming round to get us  
Im coming round when they dont know the facts  
  
So on a concrete canvas and a glow in the dark  
On a concrete canvas I will make you a mark  
Armed with the spray can soul  
Let me out with the spray can soul  
  
You ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
Cause you use your heart as a weapon  
And it hurts like heaven  
  
Whoaohoh  
Whoaohoh  
  
Yeah its true when you  
Use your heart as a weapon  
And it hurts like heaven  
  
Oh and it hurts like heaven
