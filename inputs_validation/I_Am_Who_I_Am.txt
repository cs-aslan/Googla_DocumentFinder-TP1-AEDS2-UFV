Perhaps Ill never show this world all I could be  
  
I just cant sing to any man the song he wants to hear  
And I know that some wont like me  
  
Others try to be my friend  
But Im all of me and thats all that I am  
  
Chorus  
And if life is for the living  
  
Then why cant men be real  
  
Stead of hidin in their costumes  
  
Forgettin how to feel forgettin how to feel  
  
We still live in a time when manners cover what is real  
  
Theres a basic fact of life that the times cannot conceal  
That if some are masqueraders  
  
Others live in their facade  
But Im what I am  
  
I cannot be what I am not  
  
Chorus  
  
I may be too honest and offend those who pretend  
  
I dont claim Im always right that Im evrybodys friend  
Perhaps for them its easier to be what they are not  
  
But Im what I am and I just cant play that part  
  
Chorus
