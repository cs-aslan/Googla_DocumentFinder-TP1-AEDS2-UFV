Will you take me pool side  
To feel the summer breeze  
Theres a place that looks inviting  
By the frangipani tree  
A little taste of moonlight  
And a canopy of stars  
  
Oh  
Its a feeling  
Such a feeling  
Something I cannot hide  
Youre the reason Im so high  
  
Ever had the feeling  
Something couldnt be more right  
I feel as if I know you  
And we only met tonight  
Ive got a cool sensation  
I can hardly catch my breath  
  
Oh  
Its a feeling  
Such a feeling  
Something I cannot hide  
Youre the reason Im so high  
  
Oh  
Its a feeling  
Such a feeling  
Something I cannot hide  
On the ceiling  
Im so high  
In the evening  
Im so high  
Such a feeling  
Im so high  
  
The partys almost over  
I dont want tonight to end  
We could be starting something  
You feel more than a friend  
The universe conspired  
For the two of us tonight  
  
Oh  
Its a feeling  
Such a feeling  
Something I cannot hide  
Youre the reason Im so high  
  
Oh  
Its a feeling  
Such a feeling  
Something I cannot hide  
Youre the reason Im so high  
  
On the ceiling  
Im so high  
In the evening  
Im so high  
Such a feeling  
Im so high
