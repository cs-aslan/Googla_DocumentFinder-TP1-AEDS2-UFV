Overwhelming as they are  
Breeding hope by counting stars  
Merge the bitterness the pain  
Which Im sure  
You can explain again  
  
One gets hurt when she feels small  
And shes longing for some peace   
Being the center of it all  
Slow attack but fast release   
Hear the difference in vain  
Out of tune but just not quite the same  
  
Overwhelming as they are  
With their mystifying glow   
Breeding hope by counting stars  
As they hunger for the show   
Hear the difference in vain  
Out of tune but just not quite the same
