On your own  
All alone and crying  
A wounded soul on an island in the blue  
Loves required  
But youre too tired from trying  
Dont Give Up  
Theres love enough for you  
  
Chorus  
Theres love enough for a broken heart  
Love enough for another start  
Love enough in the Fathers arms for you  
When it feels like the tears wont end  
When loneliness is your only friend  
Theres love enough  
Love enough for you  
On His own  
Allone and dying  
He gave up everything for me and you  
Hear your heart  
Its time to start relying  
On the one who had love enough for you  
  
Chorus  
Like a cup thats running over  
Like a well that wont run dry  
From the storm a constant cover  
For a heart the sole supply  
Chorus 2X  
Love enough for you  
Love enough love enough  
Love enough for me  
Love enough for you
