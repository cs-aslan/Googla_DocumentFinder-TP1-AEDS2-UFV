Every time when I think Im closer  
To what I need most  
Here I am standing in line  
Will it be worth the waiting  
Had enough of hard times  
I cant stand no more  
Layin down a new line  
Now I know for sure  
Every heartbreak made me that much stronger  
Good things take that long  
Had enough of hard times  
Theres no stopping us now  
Had enough of hard times  
Theres no stopping us now  
I know I was born to love you  
So glad its you  
Got a new rhyme  
Heres another rhythm got me steppin in time  
Sittin with your head on my shoulder  
Right where you belong
