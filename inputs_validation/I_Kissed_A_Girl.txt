This was never the way I planned  
Not my intention  
I got so brave drink in hand  
Lost my discretion  
Its not what Im used to  
Just wanna try you on  
Im curious for you  
Caught my attention  
  
Chorus  
I kissed a girl and I liked it  
The taste of her cherry chap stick  
I kissed a girl just to try it  
I hope my boyfriend dont mind it  
It felt so wrong  
It felt so right  
Dont mean Im in love tonight  
I kissed a girl and I liked it  
I liked it  
  
No I dont even know your name  
It doesnt matter  
Youre my experimental game  
Just human nature  
Its not what good girls do  
Not how they should behave  
My head gets so confused  
Hard to obey  
  
Chorus  
  
Us girls we are so magical  
Soft skin red lips so kissable  
Hard to resist so touchable  
Too good to deny it  
Aint no big deal its innocent  
  
Chorus
