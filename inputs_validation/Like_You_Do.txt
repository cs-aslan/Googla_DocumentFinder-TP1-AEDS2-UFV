Well Ive seen women who cross their legs  
Before they sit down to the table  
And Ive seen women who look to the sky  
Screamin Lord I believe in the Bible  
And Ive seen hookers dancin through Times Square  
With their heads held up so high  
But Ive never seen a woman  
Who makes me feel  
Woah like you do  
  
Well Ive seen couples holdin hands  
With that glazy look in their eyes  
And Ive seen lovers rollin round in bed  
Screamin as if theyre gonna die  
And Ive seen lovers holdin hands  
And then laughin when their back is turned  
But Ive never seen a woman  
Who makes me feel  
Woah like you do  
  
Well Ive seen women who cross their legs  
Before they sit down to the table  
And Ive seen women who look to the sky  
Screamin Lord I Believe in the Bible  
And Ive seen hookers dancin through Times Square  
With their heads held up so high  
But Ive never seen a woman  
Who makes me feel  
No Ive never seen a woman  
Who can make me feel  
Like you do
