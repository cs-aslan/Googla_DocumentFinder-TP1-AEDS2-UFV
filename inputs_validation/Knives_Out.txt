I want you to know  
Hes not coming back  
Look into my mouth  
Im not coming back  
  
So knives out  
Cut him up  
Dont look down  
Shove it in your mouth  
  
If youd been a dog  
They would have drowned you at birth  
Look into my mouth  
Its the only way youll know Im telling the truth  
  
So knives out  
Cut him up  
Squash his head  
Put him in the pot  
  
I want you to know  
Hes not coming back  
His blood is frozen  
Still there is no point letting it go to waste  
  
So knives out  
Catch the mouse  
Squash his head  
Put him in the pot
