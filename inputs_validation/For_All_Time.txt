Sun comes up on this new morning  
Shifting shadows a songbird sings  
And if these words could have kept you happy  
  
Id do anything  
  
And if you feel alone Ill be your shoulder  
With a tender touch you know so well  
Somebody once said its the soul that matters  
Baby who can really tell  
When two hearts belong so well  
  
Maybe the walls will tumble  
And sun may refuse to shine  
When I say I love you  
Baby youve gotta know  
I dont know  
Thats for all time  
Baby you gotta know  
I dont know  
Thats for all time  
  
Moon shines down on this good evening  
One warm kiss in this cold night air  
For this good love Im receiving  
Ill go anywhere  
Just as long as you are there  
  
And maybe the walls will tumble  
Sun may refuse to shine  
When I say I love you  
Baby youve gotta know  
Thats for all time  
I dont know  
Baby you gotta know  
I dont know  
Thats for all time  
  
Oh Oh oh oh  
The sun in me  
Oh Oh oh oh  
All these words that young lovers say  
  
And maybe the walls will crumble  
And sun may refuse to shine  
When I say I need you  
Baby youve gotta know  
Thats for all time  
I dont know  
Baby you gotta know  
I dont know  
Thats for all time  
  
Baby you can never go  
Baby you gotta know  
See that you never go  
Thats for all time  
Baby you never know  
I dont know  
Thats for all time
