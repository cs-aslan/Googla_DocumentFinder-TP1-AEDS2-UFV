I was a lover a leader of me  
All of the women I knew were my friends  
I was so happy my feet on the ground  
I didnt know I was on the way down  
Cause you dont feel the same  
Its only a game its only a game its only a game  
  
I had a billion or two in the bank  
I gave to charity aint got no thanks  
You gave me all that a woman could give  
Less youre affection I dont want to live  
Cause you dont feel the same  
Its only a game its only a game its only a game  
  
Cause you dont feel the same  
I was a lover a leader of me  
All of the women I knew were my friends  
I was so happy my feet on the ground  
I didnt know I was on the way down  
Cause you dont feel the same  
Its only a game its only a game  its only a game
