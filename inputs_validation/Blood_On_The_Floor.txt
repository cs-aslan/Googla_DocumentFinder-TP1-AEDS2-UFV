Well goodbye world  
Its sad but true  
Got a date with the hangman  
I have to leave you  
I shot my darlin  
Three times of more  
The reason Im goin  
Is blood on the floor  
  
The nights are so lonely  
The days are so long  
Im in the jailhouse  
Cause they say Ive done wrong  
I dont say Im sorry  
I just say Im sore  
The reason Im goin  
Is blood on the floor blood on the floor  
  
Well I came home one night  
She were lyin  
With her legs around  
Another mans bod  
She saw me stared laughin  
But she cried when she saw my gun  
  
Goodbye world  
I guess we must part  
Theyre taking my life  
Cause I shot my sweetheart  
I dont say Im sorry  
I just say Im sore  
The reason Im goin  
Is blood on the floor  
Oh the reason Im goin  
Is blood on the floor  
Oh the reason Im goin  
Is the blood on the floor
