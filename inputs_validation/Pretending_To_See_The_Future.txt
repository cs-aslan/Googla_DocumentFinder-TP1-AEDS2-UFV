Avoiding this is like avoiding a plague  
We cant understand the advances we made  
Weve tried to resist but its so hard to say no  
Were pretending to see what the future will hold  
We appear to be in control of our fate  
Just like soldiers believe theyre in control of a war  
But its moving so fast we cannot see what weve done  
Were losing our eyes just to say that weve won  
  
My minds made up my heart is broke  
My fortunes is made me and I feel so choked  
I cant understand how we could ever believe  
The things we asked for but never received  
  
We never understood the times we asked  
The way we wasted all that passed  
This neglect is final its a stage we must  
Endure to ever hope to see the first  
My minds made up about the things we did  
We never saw we believed we couldnt say what we missed  
  
My minds made up my heart is broke  
My fortunes is made me and I feel so choked  
I cant understand how we could ever believe  
The things we asked for but never received  
  
By making noises which we cannot control  
The things we hoped that wed never forgo  
We appear to be in control of our fate  
Just like soldiers believe theyre in control of a war  
But its moving so fast we cannot see what weve done  
Were losing our eyes just to say that weve won  
  
My minds made up my heart is broke  
My fortunes is made me and I feel so choked  
I cant understand how we could ever believe  
The things we asked for but never received
