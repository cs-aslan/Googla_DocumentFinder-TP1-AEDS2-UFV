G Brooker K Reid C Thompson  
When youre out in the dark  
Nothing to believe in  
And you cant find a way back home  
Theres a man with a secret  
Theres a visionary sister  
Who knows whats right or wrong  
Little by little I turn to the light  
And one day Ill be satisfied  
Like the hand that rocks the cradle  
I gotta be gentle and strong  
The hand that rocks the cradle  
Gonna be the lucky one  
When the wind blows cold  
And you lose your resistance  
Slipping down on the darkest side  
You can push too hard  
You can run too fast  
Dont get lost in the looking glass  
Little by little the wheel turns around  
And one day Ill be satisfied  
Like the hand that rocks the cradle  
I gotta be gentle and strong  
The hand that rocks the cradle  
Gonna be the lucky one
