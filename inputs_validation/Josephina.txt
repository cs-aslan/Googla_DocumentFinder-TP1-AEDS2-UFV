Josephina theres so much I want to know  
Ive known you for all of mine  
But not all of yours  
Youre not a stranger  
No nothing could be further  
I look back and I wonder  
What you were like long before  
Josephina if I asked you would you tell me  
The fact from the fancy  
And the dreams in between  
Tell me a story  
All about yours truly  
Photographs from the past  
Imagine the mystery  
  
Didja get your head lost in a daydream  
Cinderella waiting for her charming  
Did ya break a heart like little girls often do  
Pigtails and painted toes  
All dressed up in your mothers clothes  
Can you shine the light  
Ah can you shine the light  
Oh please can you shine some light  
Yeah can you shine the light  
Shine the light on a shadow  
  
Josephina would you lay down your defenses  
So I can make sense of  
Those colors fading to grey  
Its not that youre hiding  
Something Id never imply  
Yesteryear I may be gone  
Cant say the same for today  
  
Yeah Josephina  
  
Ah Josephina  
  
How else am I to know that all the while  
There was a mischievous look behind that smile  
Its hard to tell when innocence comes and goes  
Im sure that there were times life could be unkind  
Without a shoulder to cry on  
Can you shine the light  
Ah can you shine the light  
Yeah please can you shine some light  
Yeah can you shine the light  
Yeah can you shine the light  
Shine the light on a shadow  
  
Ahahah  
Ahahah  
Ahahah
