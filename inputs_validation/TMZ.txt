Youre sort of famous  
A minor celebrity  
And so it only makes sense  
The world would be  
Obsessed with every  
Single thing you do  
  
Theyre running round  
With their camcorders in the night  
Theyre lurking patiently  
And hoping that they just might  
See something real embarrassing  
You do  
  
The bad hair day and sweatstained tshirts  
Thats the story that  
They are gonna feature  
With exclusive pics  
Of your flabby behind  
You think youre all alone  
But thats right when youll find  
  
A bunch of paparazzi  
Popping out of nowhere  
Cameras in your face  
And then suddenly  
Youre on TMZ  
Youre on TMZ  
  
Following you  
When youre walking down the street  
And asking stupid questions  
While youre trying to eat  
So you cover your face  
Thinking to yourself  
Hey isnt this creepy  
  
And theyre out there praying  
Youll have a big meltdown  
And take them on a little car chase  
Through this whole town  
Theyll be there with you  
When youre going to jail  
First on the scene  
For every wardrobe fail  
  
You just picked up some transvestite  
Seconds later  
Its up on the website  
Get a Vegas wedding  
A quickie divorce  
And theyll be  
Sneaking in  
Snapping pictures of course  
  
And if they ever catch you  
Picking your nose  
Or storming down the street  
On a drunken spree  
Youre on TMZ  
  
Stalking you  
Just waiting by a front door  
Trailing you through  
Airport security  
They were TMZ  
They were TMZ  
  
We caught this Oscar nominee picking up dog poop  
Is that a baby bump  
I pronounce you guilty of leaving the house while fat  
Look whos drinking coffee  
Everything celebrities do is fascinating  
  
Oh let me tell you  
Its getting to the point  
Where a famous person cant  
Even get a DUI  
Or go on a racist rant  
Those guys are all around  
So you really shouldnt dare  
Go to every club in town  
If youve lost your underwear  
  
Seems that every single time  
A star decides to shave their head  
Or ram their car into a tree  
Theyre on TMZ  
  
If they catch you peeing in the bushes  
Later on that night  
Well I guarantee  
Youre on TMZ  
Youre on TMZ  
  
Youre on TMZ  
Every single celebrity  
Knows theyre gonna be  
There on TMZ
