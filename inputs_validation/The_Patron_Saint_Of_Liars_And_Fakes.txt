Im holding out and Im holding on  
To every letter and every song  
I pulled myself out of the day we ever had to meet  
Are you through with me  
  
And when it all goes to hell  
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face  
  
Im all ears and Im all scars  
To hear you tell me Boys like you who try too hard to look not quite as
desperate  
Im hanging on  
But I still know the way to make your makeup run  
so  
  
And when it all goes to hell  
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face  
  
Take this to your grave  
And Ill take it to mine  
Take this to your grave  
And Ill take it to mine  
Take this to your grave  
And Ill take it to mine  
Take this to your grave  
And Ill take it to mine  
  
When it all goes to hell  
When it all goes to hell  
When it all goes to hell
