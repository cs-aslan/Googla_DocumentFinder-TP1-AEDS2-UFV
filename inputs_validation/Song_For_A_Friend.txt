Well youre magic he said  
But dont let it all go to your head  
Well I bet if you all had it all figured out  
Then youd never get out of bed  
No doubt  
All the things that Ive read what he wrote me  
Is now sounding like the man I was hoping  
To be  
Keep on keeping it real  
Cause it keeps getting easier indeed  
Hes the reason that Im laughing  
Even if theres no one else  
He said youve got to love yourself  
  
You say you shouldnt mumble when you speak  
But keep your tongue up in your cheek  
And if you stumble on to  
You better remember that its humble that you seek  
You got all the skill you need  
Individuality  
You got something  
Call it gumption  
Call it anything you want  
Because when you play the fool now  
Youre only fooling everyone else  
Youre learning to love yourself  
  
Theres no price to pay  
When you give and what you take  
Thats why its easy to thank you  
You  
  
Lets say take a break from the day  
And get back to the old garage  
Because lifes too short anyway  
But at least its better then average  
As long as you got me  
And I got you  
You know well got a lot to go around  
Ill be your friend  
Your other brother  
Another love to come and comfort you  
And Ill keep reminding  
If its the only thing I ever do  
I will always love  
I will always love you  
Yes you  
I will always always always always love  
I will always always love  
I will always always love love
