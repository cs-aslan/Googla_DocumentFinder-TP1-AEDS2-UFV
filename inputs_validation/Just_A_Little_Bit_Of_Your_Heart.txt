Verse 1  
Oh oh oh oh  
I dont ever ask you where youve been  
And I dont feel the need to  
Know who youre with  
I cant even think straight but I can tell  
That you were just with her  
And Ill still be a fool  
Im a fool for you  
  
Chorus  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit is all Im asking for  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Verse 2  
I dont ever tell you how I really feel  
Cause I cant find the words to say what I mean  
And nothings ever easy  
Thats what they say  
I know Im not your only  
But Ill still be a fool  
Cause Im a fool for you  
  
Chorus  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit is all Im asking for  
Oh oh Just a little bit oh oh Hallelujah  
  
Bridge  
Just a little bit oh yeah  
I know Im not youre only  
But at least Im one  
I hear a little love is better than none  
Oh babe  
  
Chorus  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit is all Im asking for  
  
Chorus  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart Just a little bit baby  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want Is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart Just a little bit  
Just a little bit of your heart Just a little bit  
Just a little bit is all Im asking for
