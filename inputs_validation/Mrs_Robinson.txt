And heres to you Mrs Robinson  
Jesus loves you more than you will know  
God bless you please Mrs Robinson  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray  
Hey hey hey  
  
Wed like to know a little bit about your for our files  
Wed like to help you learn to help yourself  
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes  
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home  
  
And heres to you Mrs Robinson  
Jesus loves you more than you will know  
God bless you please Mrs Robinson  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray  
Hey hey hey  
  
Hide in the hiding place where no one ever goes  
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes  
Its a little secret just the Robinsons affair  
Most of all youve got to hide it from the kids  
  
Kookookachoo Mrs Robinson  
Jesus loves you more than you will know  
God bless you please Mrs Robinson  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray  
Hey hey hey  
  
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon  
Going to the candidates debate  
Laugh about it shout about it  
When youve got to choose  
Every way you look at this you lose  
  
Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio  
Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you  
Whats that you say Mrs Robinson  
Jotting Joe has left and gone away  
Hey hey hey
