Im a ghost my name is Bill  
I live in a haunted house up on the hill  
All day long all by myself  
I dont have to share with anyone else  
  
Halloween night kids come around  
They knock on my door from all over town  
They open the door cause they think its ok  
Ill show you what I do to scareem away  
  
The ghost says boo Get out of my house  
The ghost says boo Get out of my house  
The ghost says boo Get out of my house  
Get out of my house right now  
  
They look through the windows look through the doors  
  
The ghost says boo Get out of my house  
The ghost says boo Get out of my house  
The ghost says boo Get out of my house  
Get out of my house right now  
  
They get really scared when they hear me say boo  
  
The ghost says boo Get out of my house  
The ghost says boo Get out of my house  
The ghost says boo Get out of my house  
Get out of my house right now
