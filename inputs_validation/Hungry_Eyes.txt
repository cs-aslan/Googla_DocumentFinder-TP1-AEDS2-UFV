Hungry Eyes  
  
  
Ive been meaning to tell you  
Ive got this feelin that wont subside  
I look at you and I fantasize  
You are mine tonight  
Now Ive got you in my sights  
  
With these hungry eyes  
One look at you and I cant disguise  
Ive got hungry eyes  
I feel the magic between you and I  
  
I want to hold you so hear me out  
I want to show you what loves all about  
Darlin tonight  
Now Ive got you in my sights  
  
With these hungry eyes  
One look at you and I cant disguise  
Ive got hungry eyes  
I feel the magic between you  
And Ive got hungry eyes  
Now Ive got you in my sights  
With these hungry eyes  
Now did I take you by surprise  
  
I need you to see  
This love was meant to be  
  
Ive got hungry eyes  
One look at you and I cant disguise  
Ive got hungry eyes  
I feel the magic between you  
And Ive got hungry eyes  
Now Ive got you in my sights  
With those hungry eyes  
Did I take you by surprise  
  
With my hungry eyes
