Dont wear a crown of thorns  
Got no holes in my hand  
Dont accuse me of that crime  
Dont hang me up to dry  
  
Its not me Its not me Its not me  
  
Dont wanna die for your sins  
Got no special powers  
Sacrifice and sacrilege  
Hey man I wanna live  
  
Im not Jesus  
I cant heal you  
  
Taste my blood  
it doesnt taste like wine  
Cant you see this cross isnt mine  
Judas must die for what he has done  
Satans watching with his gun  
  
Its not me  
Its not me  
Its not me  
  
Father son and Holy Ghost  
Say your prayersits your only hope  
Twelve apostles cant help you now  
Ill be back to stake my ground  
  
Im not Jesus  
I cant heal you  
Im not Jesus  
I cant heal you  
  
Dont wear a crown of thorns  
Got no holes in my head  
Dont accuse me of that crime  
Dont hang me up to dry  
  
Im not Jesus  
I cant heal you  
Im not Jesus  
I cant heal you  
Im not Jesus  
I cant heal you
