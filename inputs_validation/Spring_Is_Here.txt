Richard Rodgers Lorenz Hart  
  
Sprinh is here  
Why doesnt my heart go dancing  
Spring is here  
Why isnt the waltz entrancing  
No desire no ambition leads me  
Maybe its becaus nobody needs me  
  
Spring is here  
Why doesnt the breeze delight me  
Stars appear  
Why doesnt the night invite me  
But maybe its because nobody loves me  
Spring is here I hear  
Somebody told me spring is here
