Did you buy your tickets for the war game  
Arent you glad that your sitting in the back  
For the game is deadly having all the players  
Arent you glad its a spectator sport  
  
Cant you hear the cries  
It isnt over  
Cant you smell the fear  
Its all over  
  
If you want to play the game you must have playmates  
Choose your side play guitar  but play to win  
Dont be sad if you loose it it isnt over  
Pick your side and begin the game agian  
It isnt over  
  
Cant you hear the cries  
It isnt over  
Cant you smell the fear  
Its all over  
  
You dont have to play the game if you dont want to  
You can sit at home and hear it on the news  
They will show you colored pictures of the killings  
They want you to feel that youre part of it too  
  
Cant you hear the cries  
It isnt over  
Dont you smell the fear  
Its all over  
Its all over
