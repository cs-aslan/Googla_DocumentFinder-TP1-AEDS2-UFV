J Cole  
They say anythings possible  
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles  
Chasing obscene profits so we aint stopping for the red lights  
Look in my rear view all I see is nggas headlights  
Catch me if you can hoe  
They try and sack me and I scramble  
Look up in the sky youll see exactly where I am bo  
Hey dont you see me man  
Making my wishes come true with no genie man  
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beanie Man  
Im on these rich nggas ass no bikini man  
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man  
Never imagined that the kids would wanna be me man  
Eh could it be that I give the hopeless broke kids hope  
Caught me walking through the mall looking like he seen a ghost  
Silly head to approach whats up young blood  
Aint it strange a year ago today I was counting change  
Yeah hopping trains up in New York city  
Though I gotta thank God cause if you werent with me  
Than I surely woulda died  
You can throw the fork in me

So run back to him while you still can  
He sticking with his wife and kid yeah thats a real man  
I was ashamed all along and I still am  
We let the lust interupt something real damn  
Girl we grown so you gotta play your own position
