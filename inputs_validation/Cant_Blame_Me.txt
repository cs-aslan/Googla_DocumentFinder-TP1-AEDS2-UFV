Baby I want the  
Love you been savin  
Tell me the truth  
Boy why you been waitin  
Oh oh oh oh cant blame me  
  
We could be sweethearts  
We could be never  
Did you forget  
I love you forever  
Oh oh oh oh cant blame me  
  
I can see by now  
You dont want to know  
Cant blame me if I love you so  
  
Ill be your dancer  
A silky eyed lady  
Dreamin of moonlight  
Hopin that maybe  
Oh oh oh oh cant blame me  
  
We could be sweethearts
