Shes so fine makes me lose my mind  
I wish to apply my manhood  
Ill be glad to go to her pad and  
Maybe the whole band could  
  
I got to make a decision  
To avoid a collision  
  
Shes so tuff my knees a little rough  
From crawlin on across her floor  
If shed place an order Id drink her bath water and  
Not even use a chaser  
  
I got to make a decision  
To avoid a collision  
  
Her lips are wet and Id make a bet  
Shes been suckin on her watermellon rind  
Shes a picture of wealth and I know myself  
That Id take what she leaves behind
