I know theres hurt I know theres pain  
But people change Lord knows Ive been no saint  
In my own way regret choices Ive made  
How do I say Im sorry How do I say Im sorry  
  
I was scared I was unprepared  
Oh for the things you said  
If I could undo that I hurt you  
I would do anything for us to make it through  
Draw me a smile and save me tonight  
I am a blank page waiting for you to bring me to life  
Paint me a heart let me be your art  
I am a blank page waiting for life to start  
  
Let our hearts stop and beat as one together  
Let out hearts stop and beat as one forever  
  
How can I erase decisions Ive made  
How do I go back what more can I say  
All that remains are hearts filled with shame  
How do we say were sorry How do we say were sorry  
  
I was scared I was unprepared  
Oh for the things you said  
If I could undo that I hurt you  
I would do anything for us to make it through  
Draw me a smile and save me tonight  
I am a blank page waiting for you to bring me to life  
Paint me a heart let me be your art  
I am a blank page waiting for life to start  
  
Let our hearts stop and beat as one together  
Let out hearts stop and beat as one forever  
  
Id go back in time and Ill realize  
Our spirits aligned and wed never die  
  
Draw me a smile and save me tonight  
Ill be your blank page waiting for you to bring me to life  
Paint me a heart let me be your art  
I am a blank page waiting for life to start  
  
Let our hearts start and beat as one together  
Let our hearts start and beat as one forever
