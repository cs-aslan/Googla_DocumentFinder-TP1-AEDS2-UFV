I put ketchup on my scrambled eggs  
And everybody thinks its funny  
I dont get mad  
I dont laugh cause you dont shave your legs  
But everybody thinks its funny  
  
No need to get mad  
I dont spend my time with anyone  
Who doesnt think Im wonderful  
Or somewhat cash refundable at times  
  
Now Im out here counting airplanes  
Trying to make sense of the change  
And I dont want to be just anybody  
So dont try to figure me out  
I wont try to figure you out  
  
I dont want to be some average anybody  
Now I got friends that ride into the storm  
And ride out of the storm with nothing  
They rode into the storm with  
  
And there seems to be a price for everything  
You get what you pay for then you pay for  
What you already thought you bought before  
  
When youre up between the new sky line  
The city lights and the warm sunshine  
Its a long way down  
When you can count on one hand what you love  
And can count on who you love to help you on your long way down  
  
You end up counting airplanes  
Trying to keep up with these changes  
I dont want to be with anybody else  
So dont try to figure me out  
I wont try to figure you out  
I dont want to be some average anybody
