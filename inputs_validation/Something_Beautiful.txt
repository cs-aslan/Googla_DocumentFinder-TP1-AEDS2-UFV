This is a song for anyone whose ever been  
Knocked down and cant get back again  
Stuck in the corner cant move forward  
All alone and you think youre going nowhere  
This is a song for anyone whose ever stood underneath the sun  
And felt so small two feet tall and so out of place  
  
He sees yo He knows you He loves you  
And He wants you to know that  
  
The life that youve been living the days that youve been given  
Were made for something beautiful  
Life  dont let it pass you by  
Because you were created for something beautiful  
  
Heaven holds a dream thats just for you  
And there are things only you can do  
So step by faith put the past away so step by faith dont be afraid  
Itll take you to a better day put the past and your fears away  
Second to minute to hour to life  
Time always seems to fly  
Its on the go and before you know  
Your days are through  
  
But he sees you He knows you He loves you  
And he wants you to know that  
  
The life that youve been living the days that youve been given  
Were made for something beautiful  
Life dont let it pass you by  
Because you were created for something beautiful  
  
What are you waiting for  
What are you waiting for  
What are you waiting for  
Theres something beautiful
