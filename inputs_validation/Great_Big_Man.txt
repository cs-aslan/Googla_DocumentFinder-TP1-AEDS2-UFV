Rust on your fingers you got trouble at your feet  
Keep the home fires burning but look out for the heat  
cause theres a man at the window who knows just what you think  
And theres a water boy behind you who wont give you a drink  
  
Well its a hard hard time no easy road in sight  
It takes a great big man to win a great big fight  
  
When it comes to dying no matter what you tell  
Theyll let you into a heaven cause you lived your life in hell  
Well theyve got no way to reward you but to let those breezes blow  
And youve got nothing left to do but to let your anger show  
  
Cause its a hard hard time no easy road in sight  
It takes a great big man to win a great big fight  
  
Think about your baby think about your wife  
Think about your banker whos trying to take your life  
Think about this planet thats rolling through the night  
Oh can you turn your back on such a great big fight  
  
You got the muscle big man you got the power  
But youre getting weaker with each passing hour  
Just like a flame in the rain like a light in the night  
Well if its you that must stay well then its you that must fight  
  
Cause its a hard hard time your futures not bright  
It takes a great big man to win a great big  
Great big man to win a great big fight
