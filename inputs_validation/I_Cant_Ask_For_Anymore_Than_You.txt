You could have been a bad girl  
And wasted all my time  
You could have got me mad girl  
And made me lose my mind  
But you did what you have to do  
And every word you said to me was true  
You gave me what I asked for  
And I cant ask for anymore than you  
  
It makes me very proud baby  
To know that youre my girl  
I want to say it loud baby  
I want to tell the world  
That you did what you had to do  
And every word you said to me was true  
You gave me what I asked for  
And I cant ask for anymore than you  
Ive got everything a man could need  
Oh I feel just like a slave that has been freed  
I wont cry myself to sleep no more  
Cause Ive found the love that Ive been looking for  
  
Now I dont have a problem  
Cause I know who I am  
You see I lost my only problem  
When you made me your man  
Cause you did what you had to do  
And every word you said to me was true  
You gave me what I asked for  
And I cant ask for anymore than you
