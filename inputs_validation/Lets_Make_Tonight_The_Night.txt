I see the way he treats you  
I feel the tears you cry  
And it makes me sad and it makes me mad  
Theres nothin I can do baby  
Cause your lover is my best friend  
And I guess thats where the story ends  
So Ive gotta try to keep it inside  
Youll never be never be mine  
  
But if I was the one who was loving you baby  
The only tears youd cry would be tears of joy  
And if I was by your side  
Youd never know one lonely night  
  
If it was my arms you were running to  
Id give you love in these arms of mine  
If I was the one in your life  
  
If I could have just one wish  
Id wish that you were mine  
I would hold you near kiss away those tears  
Id be so good to you baby  
Youre the one I want next to me  
But I guess thats just not meant to be  
Hes there in your life hes sharing your nights  
Ill never be never be never be right  
  
But if I was the one who was loving you baby  
The only tears youd cry would be tears of joy  
And if I was by your side  
Youd never know one lonely night  
  
I want to reach out and feel you beside me beside me  
Right here right now right beside me baby baby  
And take you in my arms right now  
And scream I love you right out loud  
And then someday Ill pray Ill find  
Ill find the strength to turn to you and say  
  
But if I was the one who was loving you baby  
The only tears youd cry would be tears of joy  
And if I was by your side  
Youd never know one lonely night  
  
If I was the one if I was the one the one  
If I was the one in your life
