You give me life like lots of oxygen  
You treat me like I was in love again  
And Id hold you tight tight enough to know  
That you were mine Id never let you go  
  
And its you I miss  
And its you I miss  
So let it out  
And let it out now  
And let it out  
And let it out now now  
  
And you speak to me behind your dark green stare  
And youd let me be as if I wasnt there  
It seemed perfect the concept free from any regret  
Another couple based on teen sex  
You idiot true I was just like you  
We couldnt be torn apart you see we were just like glue  
  
Its you I miss  
And its you I miss  
So let it out  
And let it out now  
And let it out  
And let it out now now  
  
It seemed perfect the concept free from any regret  
Another couple based on teen sex  
You idiot true I was just like you  
We couldnt be torn part you see we were just like glue  
  
Were like glue  
  
So let it out  
Let it out now  
Let it out  
And let it out now now  
  
It seemed perfect the concept free from any regret  
Another couple based on teen sex  
You idiot true I was just like you  
We couldnt be torn apart you see we were just like glue
