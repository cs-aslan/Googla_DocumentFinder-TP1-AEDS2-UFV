It didnt happen for you  
No one wants to hear the truth  
Coming from three political queers  
Plucking the punk rock bloom  
So you break up the band  
And leave us all in tow  
Now we gotta figure out  
Where to go  
I caught it at a rave  
Did it give you vaccination  
I saw it on my TV  
Did it lighten up your load  
And every fuckin DJ  
Did you feel affilliated  
Is telling me Im free  
Like you really had a home  
Free to be a loser  
Were the ticket prices too high  
Free to be a trend  
Were the lights too bright  
Free to be a backlash over and over again  
Was it all a bunch of hype  
You say Im losing inspiration  
One band at a time  
I gotta know theres someone somewhere out there singing for our side  
Where I come up we share the mortar and the glue  
And what we build together we share that too  
And the wind may come and the rain may fall  
But we stand together or we dont stand at all  
Where are you going to now  
Now that the goings gone  
So heres to your survival  
And swimming up the stream  
Crossing over one dam after another  
Until we get to Rock and Roll Heavens gate  
I caught it at a rave  
Did it give you vaccination  
I saw it on the TV  
Did it lighten up your load  
And every fucking DJ  
Did you feel affiliated  
Is telling me Im free  
Like you really had a home  
Free to be a loser  
Were the ticket prices too high  
Free to be a trend  
Were the lights too bright  
Free to be a backlash over and over  
Until I get to Rock and Roll Heavens gate
