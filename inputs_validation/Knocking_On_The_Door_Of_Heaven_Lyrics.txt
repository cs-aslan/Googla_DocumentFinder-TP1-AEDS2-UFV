We will give ourselves no rest  
Till Your Kingdom comes on earth  
Weve positioned watchmen on the walls  
Now our prayers will flow like tears  
For Youve shared Your heart with us  
God of Heaven on our knees we fall  
  
Come down in power reveal Your heart again  
Come hear our cries the tears that plead for rain  
  
Were knocking knocking on the door of heaven  
Were crying crying for this generation  
Were praying for Your Name to be known in all of the earth  
Were watching watching on the walls to see You  
Were looking looking for a time of breakthrough  
Were praying for Your Word to bear fruit in all of the earth  
All of the earth
