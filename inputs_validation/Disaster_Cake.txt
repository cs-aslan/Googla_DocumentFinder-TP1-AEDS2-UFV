If youre gonna make an omelet  
You gotta break an egg  
You want to be in showbiz  
Then you gotta break a leg  
  
Babe youre heading on a journey  
I hate to see you make  
Cause the only food they sell there

Itll grab you by the short hairs

Yeah youre young and youre cool  
But hells full of young fools  
Rest in peace  
  
Yeah I know youre tired of listenin  
And you wish Id just go away  
If I do youll be alone here  
And then youll beg my ass to stay  
  
Babe lifes a paradox for certain  
Like trying to fuck through an earthquake
