I hear a lot of talk about the things you say are good for me to do  
Ive tried cooperation but I dont get nothing coming back from you  
  
So dont you like my face  
No you look just fine  
Dont I know my place  
No youre out of line  
Should I shave off my hair  
Yeah and Ill shave mine  
I dont like the things you try to make me do  
And I dont need you  
I dont need you  
  
What am I gonna do you drive me crazy when you say those things you say  
Every time I see you you have to fight the urge to walk the other way  
  
Dont you like my face  
No you look just fine  
Dont I know my place  
No youre out of line  
Should I shave off my hair  
Yeah and Ill shave mine  
I dont like the things you try to make me do  
And I dont need you  
I dont need you  
  
I dont need you to tell me what to wear  
You can say that I dont care its true  
I dont need you to tell me how to speak  
I wont become some kind of geek like you  
  
Just to hear you talk youd think the world revolves round what youve got to
say  
Now you can give me trouble but Im going to give it back to you some day  
  
You dont like my face  
No you look just fine  
I dont know my place  
No youre out of line  
Should I shave off my hair  
Yeah and Ill shave mine  
I dont like the things you try to make me do  
And I dont need you  
I dont need you
