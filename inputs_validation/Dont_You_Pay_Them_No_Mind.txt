People laugh each time they see us walking by and their whispering just make  
You feel like you wanna cry Keep on walking by my side dont look behind You  
Know I love you so dont you pay em no mind  
People say our love aint gonna last too long And they point at us just like  
Weve been only carry on keep on looking in my eyes and well be fine You
see  
I love you so dont you pay em no mind  
Stay with me and let em see let em know that you love me that you love me
if  
Its true who cares what they do Cause I dont need anyone but you Just you  
And me were gonna make it all alone Let them laugh at us were gonna build  
A world all our own Keep on then keep on holdin on to metheyll learn in  
Time I really love you so dont you pay em no mind You know I love you
you  
Know I cant be without you
