Were a hurricane  
So destructive in the way that we do  
A little bit insane  
But she loves it just the same  
And me too  
  
They say love and insanity  
Are somewhat related  
The way that they make us act  
But baby girl the love between you and me oh  
Is truly the greatest  
Though sometimes we hate it  
  
They cant tell me nothing about no you  
Youre my  
Crazy love  
Cant tell me nothing about how we do  
Cause we got  
Crazy love oh yeah  
  
Im intelligent  
Im not stupid  
Not at all no no no  
But my common sense  
When it comes to you it falls  
Then I do something dumb  
  
They say love and insanity  
Are somewhat related  
In the way that they make us act  
But baby girl the love between you and me  
Is truly the greatest  
Though sometimes we hate it  
  
They cant tell me nothing about no you  
Youre my  
Crazy love  
Cant tell me nothing about how we do  
You and me got  
Crazy love oh yeah  
  
I walk into where you was at then my phone calls get a who is that  
I told her that I worry that we wont last  
She told me you need to worry when I dont ask  
See thats the crazy love I be talking bout  
Gary Coleman face girl what you talking bout  
Make me wanna kick you and that yorkie out  
Then I see that fat ass when you walking out  
How Im gonna tell my baby byebye  
Outfit look crazy on her you my lady gaga  
But you wanna start it first and get the last word  
You wanna lock me down and get the password  
Damn I wanna spray dont use juice  
So in the bedroom I got a few screws loose  
The heads coocoo backshots psycho  
Hit it from the back hard hope you got Geico  
  
They cant tell me nothing about no you  
Youre my  
Crazy love  
Cant tell me nothing about how we do  
You and me got  
Crazy love oh yeah
