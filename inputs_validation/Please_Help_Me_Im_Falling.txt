Please help me Im falling in love with you  
Close the door to temptation  
Dont let me walk through  
Turn away from me darling  
Im begging you to  
Please help me Im falling in love with you  
  
I belong to another whose arms have grown cold  
But I promised for ever to have and to hold  
I could never be free dear  
But when Im with you  
I know that Im losing the will to be true  
  
Please help me Im falling and that would be sin  
Close the door to temptation  
Dont let me walk in  
For I mustnt want you oh but darling I do  
Please help me Im falling in love with you  
Please help me Im falling in love with you
