My karma just ran over your dogma  
I can feel your pain  
If everything is coming your way  
Youre facing the wrong lane  
  
Bullethead  
Bomb the moon until youre crazy dead  
Bbbbbbbullethead  
Got a different kind of true  
Bullethead  
Yes you are in danger  
I drive just like you  
  
How many roads must a man walk down  
Before he admits hes lost  
And do you really really drive this way  
Just to piss me off  
  
Boldly going nowhere  
Trouble busting through  
Yeah Im rolling slowly  
But Im ahead of you  
  
Bullethead  
Bomb the moon until youre crazy dead  
Bbbbbbbullethead  
Got a different kind of true  
Bullethead  
Yes you are in danger  
I drive just like you  
  
Well Im a lovin the horn baby  
Well Im a bullethead  
Comea comea comea come on baby  
Well Im a bullethead  
  
Hurt me  
  
Traffic is giving you trouble  
I can feel your pain  
No light at the end of the tunnel  
Due to budget constraints  
  
Some days youre the dog  
Some days youre the hydrant  
If everything is going your way  
Youre facing the wrong lane  
  
Bullethead  
Bomb the moon until youre crazy dead  
Bbbbbbbullethead  
Got a different kind of true  
Bullethead  
Yes you are in danger  
I drive just like you
