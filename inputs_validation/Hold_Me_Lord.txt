Sixteen days in Bethlehem peddling dope and drinking wine  
Pulling women making gigs steering clear and doing fine  
I moved on down to Galilee trying to find a few new friends  
Im throwing aces everywhere trying to forget the end  
  
Chorus  
Hold me Lord hold me Lord  
Hold me tight Im slipping through  
Hold me Lord hold me Lord  
Hold me tight I beg of you  
  
Im cruising through Jerusalem dust is flying everywhere  
Im dodging bullets making time on the level in the square  
They say you kissed your best friends hand they say you did it for his love  
They say you got in agony the hand fits well into the glove  
  
ChorusRepeat x3
