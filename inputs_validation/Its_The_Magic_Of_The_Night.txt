When the stars are in the skies  
Make a wish then close your eyes  
Are you dreaming  
Angels singing  
Everything is right  
Its the magic of the night  
  
Far horizons made of snow  
Bring the hopes each child will know  
Someones dreaming  
Bells are ringing  
Everything is white  
Its the magic of the night  
  
High up in the sky can you see a shining light  
Can it be that we can see an angel who is flying flying  
  
Can an angel lose their way  
Who of us on earth can say  
Someones dreaming  
Angels singing  
Everything is right  
Its the magic of the night  
  
High up in the sky can you see a shining light  
Can it be that we can see an angel who is flying flying  
  
When the stars are in the skies  
Make a wish then close your eyes  
Are you dreaming  
Bells are ringing  
Angels are in flight  
Its the magic of the night  
  
Angels are in flight  
Its the magic of the night
