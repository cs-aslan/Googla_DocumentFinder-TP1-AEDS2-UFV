Makin our moves turnin the wheel  
Trying to hide the things we feel  
Playin the game passin the blame  
It isnt enough to pretend to make out  
Our hearts are hard in our own hands  
We hold all the cards  
It has to be you has to be me  
Has to be everyone together  
It has to be you has to be you  
Were all trying to make it better  
Has to be you has to be you  
Were so blind that we cant see  
That it has to be you has to be me  
Isnt it sad isnt it strange  
We say we need rearrange  
But never ourselves always somebody else  
Another defence another excuse  
Pointing the finger where we choose  
We just dont believe its ourselves we deceive  
It has to be you has to be me  
Has to be everyone together  
It has to be you has to be you  
Were all trying to make it better  
Has to be you has to be you  
Were so blind that we cant see  
That it has to be you has to be me  
See how we live each to his own  
Everyone scared to be alone  
Still we go on as tho nothing was wrong  
It has to be you has to be me  
Has to be everyone together  
It has to be you has to be you  
Were all trying to make it better  
Has to be you has to be you  
Were so blind that we cant see  
That it has to be you has to be me
