Shouldve kept on goin  
But the hurt was showing  
When she looked at me that way  
I had to stay  
I knew I had to get to know her name  
The town was weary  
She was to marry  
Someone planned years ago  
Her eyes said no  
I knew I had to get to know her name  
And when I got her all alone  
She told me through the tears  
That she didnt really loved him  
But hed waited for so many years  
She said she couldnt break his heart  
Shed rather live with hers  
And though I told her she should leave with me  
She just could not believe with me  
Shouldve kept on goin  
Better that than knowin  
That he made her his wife  
He took her life  
You know I didnt even know her name  
You know I didnt even know her name
