Sunday morning paper dated 1992  
There are cowboys in my kitchen  
Empty bottles on the roof  
Ive been trying to quit these cigarettes  
Ive been trying to think its true  
Maybe shes gone to California  
Maybe Ill go out there too  
Daylight fading come and waste another year  
All the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn  
When she sees the early signs of daylight fading  
She leaves just before its gone  
Daddys on the rooftop with his fingers in  
The gun and I am waiting at the window I am  
Waiting for the one  
Shying in that paper when she walked into my room I said I want to  
Say goodbye to you goodbye to all my friends goodbye to everyone I know  
Daylight fading come and waste another year  
All the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn  
When she sees the early signs of daylight fading  
She leaves just before its gone  
Daylight fading come and waste another year  
All the anger and the elegance are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping round the corners of our lawn  
When she sees the early signs of daylight fading  
She leaves just before its gone
