I said one day Id find the game  
Well now you know Im not insane  
You tried to take me for a ride  
Now all you feel is suicide  
Were two of a kind  
Take what you can find  
But dont blow your mind away  
You led me to another life  
Of work and pain and sacrifice  
I broke away from you somehow  
And look whos goin through it now  
Were two of a kind  
Take what you can find  
But dont blow your mind away  
So now you know the reason why  
Im laughing here and why you cry  
cause you dont mean a thing no more  
And Im just like I was before
