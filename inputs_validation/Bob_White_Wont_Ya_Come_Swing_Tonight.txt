I was talking to the mockingbird  
He says you are the worst hes heard  
Bob White What ya gonna swing tonight  
  
I was talking to the whipporwill  
He says youve got a corny trill  
Bob White What ya gonna swing tonight  
  
Even the owl threw in the towel  
After you sang the gato  
And the flamingo Hollared by jingo  
What a vibrato  
  
Theres a lotta talk about you Bob  
And theyre saying youre off the cob  
Fake it Mister B  
Take it follow me  
Bob White  
Were gonna break it out tonight
