You never lived in the streets though you wish you had  
Not enough talent to play a guitar  
You failed as an artist cause you lacked in the confidence  
Now youre a critic and youre at the top  
The top of what  
You dont believe what you write  
Youre and imposter you dont dont dont believe what you write  
You cant get used to the fact that you aint a kid  
You like to think that you speak for them all  
Youd cut off your nose if you thought it would make you hip  
It drives you crazy you cant be a star Oh aint that tough  
You dont believe what you write  
Youre an imposter you dont believe what you write  
Youre an imposter you dont believe what you write  
Youre an imposter you dont dont dont believe what you write  
You take the credit while others do all the work  
You like to think you discovered them first  
But we all know you moved in after it was safe  
That way you know you could never get hurt  
You like to play god  
Repeat chorus  
Youre just a critic we know why you drink so much  
Jealousy slowly consuming your gut  
The streets that you never knew are just where theyve always been  
Your head is firmly lodged way up your butt where it belongs  
Repeat chorus
