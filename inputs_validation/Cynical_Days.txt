Another years gone by  
The worlds grown older  
Sometimes I heave a sigh  
People grow colder  
  
Every day I do my best to show  
I can make it in this world I know  
But all the bad thoughts that people bring  
My faith in human natures  
Getting pretty thin  
  
Help me get through these cynical days  
Help me get through my cynical ways  
You say its just a passing phase  
Youve got to help me get through these cynical days  
  
Another see through scheme  
People are shallow  
The dark nights closing in  
My dark thoughts follow  
  
I try and make my world a better place  
my efforts seem in vain  
But Im competing in a human race  
falling deeper down the drain  
That value things that just dont count  
Makes me wonder what its all about  
  
Help me get through these cynical days  
Help me get through my cynical ways  
You say its just a passing phase  
Youve got to help me get through these cynical days  
  
Yeah you say its just a passing phase  
Youve got to help me get through these cynical days  
  
Yeah you say its just a passing phase  
Youve got to help me get through these cynical days  
  
Yeah you say its just a passing phase  
Youve got to help me get through these cynical days  
  
Cynical days  
Cynical days
