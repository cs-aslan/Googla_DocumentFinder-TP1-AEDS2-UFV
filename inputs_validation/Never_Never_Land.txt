I know a place where dreams are born  
And time is never planned  
Its not on any chart  
You must find it with your heart  
To come home to Never Land  
  
It might be miles beyond the moon  
Or right here where you stand  
Just keep an open mind  
And then suddenly youll find  
Never Never Land  
  
The treasure when you stay there  
Is precious more than gold  
Once youve found your way there  
You can never grow old  
  
And thats my home where dreams are born  
And time is never planned  
Just think of lovely things  
And your heart will fly on wings forever  
To Never Never Land
