Love spreads her arms  
Waits there for the nails  
I forgive you boy  
I will prevail  
  
Too much to take  
Some cross to bear  
Im hiding in the trees with a picnic  
Shes over there yeah  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
She didnt scream  
She didnt make a sound  
I forgive you boy  
But dont leave town  
  
Cold black skin  
Naked in the rain  
Hammer flash in the lightning  
Theyre hurting her again  
  
Let me put you in the picture  
Let me show you what I mean  
The messiah is my sister  
Aint no king man shes my queen
