Please wrap your drunken arms around me  
And Ill let you call me yours tonight  
Cause slightly brokens just what I need  
And if you give me what I want  
Then Ill give you what you like  
  
Please tell me Im your one and only  
Or lie and say at least tonight  
Ive got a brand new cure for lonely  
And if you give me what I want  
Then Ill give you what you like  
  
When you turn off the lights  
I get stars in my eyes  
Is this love  
Maybe some day  
So dont turn on the lights  
Ill give you what you like  
  
Emotions arent that hard to borrow  
When love is a word youve never learned  
And in a room of empty bottles  
If you dont give me what I want  
Then youll get what you deserve  
  
When you turn off the lights  
I get stars in my eyes  
Is this love  
Maybe some day  
  
Ive got this scene in my head  
Im not sure how it ends  
Is it love  
Maybe one day  
  
So dont turn on the lights  
Ill give you what you like  
  
Ill give you one last chance to hold me  
If you give me one last cigarette  
By now its early in the morning  
Now that I gave you what you want  
All I want is to forget  
  
When you turn off the lights  
I get stars in my eyes  
Is this love  
Maybe some day  
  
Ive got this scene in my head  
Im not sure how it ends  
Is it love  
Maybe one day  
So dont turn on the lights  
Ill give you what you like
