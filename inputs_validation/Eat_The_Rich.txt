Well I woke up this morning  
On the wrong side of the bed  
And how I got to thinkin  
About all those things you said  
About ordinary people  
And how they make you sick  
And if callin names kicks back on you  
Then I hope this does the trick  
cause Im sick of your complainin  
About how many bills  
And Im sick of all your bitchin  
Bout your poodles and your pills  
And I just cant see no humor  
About your way of life  
And I think I can do more for you  
With this here fork and knife  
Eat the rich  
Theres only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now  come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now  spit out the rest  
So I called up my head shrinker  
And I told him what Id done  
He said you best go on a diet  
Yeah I hope you have some fun  
And a dont go burst the bubble  
On rich folks who get rude  
Cause you wont get in no trouble  
When you eats that kinda food  
Now theyre smokin up their junk bonds  
And then they go get stiff  
And theyre dancin in the yacht club  
With muff and uncle biff  
But theres one good thing that happens  
When you toss your pearls to swine  
Their attitudes may taste like shit  
But go real good with wine  
Eat the rich  
Theres only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now  come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now  spit out the rest  
Believe in all the good things  
That money just cant buy  
Then you wont get no bellyache  
From eatin humble pie  
I believe in rags to riches  
Your inheritance wont last  
So take your gray poupon my friend  
And shove it up your ass  
Eat the rich  
Theres only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now  come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now  spit out the rest  
Eat the rich  
Theres only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now  come back for more  
Eat the rich  
Dont stop me now Im goin crazy  
Eat the rich  
Thats my idea of a good time baby
