Right outside this lazy summer home  
You aint got time to call your soul a critic no  
Right outside the lazy gate of winters summer home  
Wonderin where the nutthatch winters  
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away  
  
Chorus  
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world  
The heart has its beaches its homeland and thoughts of its own  
Wake now discover that you are the song that the morning brings  
But the heart has its seasons its evenings and songs of its own  
  
There comes a redeemer and he slowly too fades away  
There follows his wagon behind him thats loaded with clay  
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom and decay  
And night comes so quiet its close on the heels of the day  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own  
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home  
Sometimes we ride on your horses sometimes we walk alone  
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own  
  
Chorus
