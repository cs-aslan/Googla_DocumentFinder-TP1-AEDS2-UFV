Gotta keep it on the down low  
Ill never let my momma know  
Only call him on my cellphone  
Only see him after dark  
  
I met him on the six train  
Just the way he said my name  
The brother had a lot of game  
Had me opened from the start  
  
He scoops me up in his ride  
Friday about a quarter to nine  
So fly and so fun  
And Im so glad that hes all mine  
  
Theres a thug in my life  
How am I goin tell my momma  
Shes gonna say it aint right  
But hes so good to me  
  
Theres a thug in my life  
And hes gonna cause crazy drama  
And when I see him tonight  
Im gonna give him everything  
  
I know his crews kinda shady  
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy  
But hes treating me like a lady  
Gives me everything I need  
  
I dont care whose hatin on me  
Cause every night hes waiting on me  
Hes got mad personality  
A side you never see  
  
My friends tell me to slow down  
But every time that hes around  
My hearts on lock down  
Feel loved and Im so proud  
  
Theres a thug in my life  
How am I gon tell my momma  
Shes gonna say it aint right  
But hes so good to me  
  
Theres a thug in my life  
And hes gonna cause crazy drama  
And when I see him tonight  
Im gonna give him everything  
  
Momma dont worry Im not in a hurry  
I wont disappoint you I wont make you sorry  
Hes the one for me  
Well be together from now til forever  
I know its the real thing if you dont whatever  
And I know its meant to be  
  
Theres a thug in my life  
How am I gon tell my momma  
Shes gonna say it aint right  
But hes so good to me  
  
Theres a thug in my life  
And hes gonna cause crazy drama  
And when I see him tonight  
Im gonna give him everything  
  
Momma dont worry Im not in a hurry  
I wont disappoint you I wont make you sorry  
Hes the one for me
