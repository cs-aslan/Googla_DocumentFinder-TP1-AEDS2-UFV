Do I want to be with you  
As the years come and go  
Only forever  
If you care to know  
Would I grant all your wishes  
And be proud of the task  
Only forever  
If someone should ask  
How long would it take me  
To be near if you beckon  
Off hand I would figure  
Less than a second  
Do you think Ill remember  
How you looked when you smile  
Only forever  
Thats puttin it mild  
  
How long would it take me  
To be near if you beckon  
Off hand I would figure  
Less than a second  
Do you think Ill remember  
How you looked when you smile  
Only forever  
Thats puttin it mild
