I used to be on an endless run  
Believed in miracles cause Im one  
Ive been blessed with the power to survive  
After all these years Im still alive  
  
Im out here kickin with the band  
I am no longer a solitary man  
Everyday my time runs out  
Live like a fool thats what I was about  
  
Oh I belive in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
Oh Oh I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
  
Tattooed your name on my arm  
I always said my girls a good luck charm  
If she can find a reason to forgive  
Then I can find a reason to live  
  
I used to be on an endless run  
Believed in miracles cause Im one  
Ive been blessed with the power to survive  
After all these years Im still alive  
  
Oh I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
Oh Oh I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
  
I close my eyes and think how it might be  
The futures here today  
Its not too late its not too late oh  
  
I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you  
Oh I believe in miracles  
I believe in a better world for me and you
