Dont give me no more goddamn pain  
Baby the time has turned the tide  
I didnt need no ball and chain  
I got the numbers on my side  
I didnt want to love you  
I swear to God its true  
I dont like dreaming of you anymore  
But i but damn my soul I do  
I aint got all the answers  
Im scared to death of you  
I dont like takin chances anymore  
But I damn my soul I do  
whysee I got hit so hard I thought I was dyin  
Then I fell so far I thought I could fly  
Darling from the start if somebodys lying  
Doublecross your heart and dont even try  
Because i sure dont want to need ya  
Id hate to count on you  
Im tired of going crazy anymore  
But i but damn my soul I do  
Dont give me no more goddamn pain  
Baby the time has turned the tide  
I didnt need no ball and chain  
I got the numbers on my side
