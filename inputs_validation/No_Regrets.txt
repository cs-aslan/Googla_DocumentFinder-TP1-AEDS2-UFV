No regrets altho our love affair has gone astray  
No regrets I know Ill always care though youre away  
Somehow our happy romance ended suddenly  
Still in my heart youll be forever mine  
  
No regrets because somebody new looks good to you  
No regrets sweetheart no matter what you say or do  
I know our love will linger when the other love forgets  
Still in my heart youll be forever mine
