The last I heard of you  
You were somewhere on a cruise in the Mediterranean  
So imagine my surprise to see you very much alive  
In the English rain again  
  
And I can still recall wet afternoons  
When we were small and simply childish  
But youve created your own ghost  
And the need you have is more than most to hide it  
  
Oh Chameleon youre stealing your way back into my eyes  
Beyond a shadow of a doubt  
Youre a devil youre a devil in disguise  
Do you really change me or am I going crazy  
Chameleon Chameleon Chameleon youre free again my child  
  
I remember still those lazy summer days  
Wed kill out hunting danger  
And we were alien to all outsiders  
We had no desire to talk to strangers
