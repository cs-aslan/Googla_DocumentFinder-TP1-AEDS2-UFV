I bet youre wondering how I knew  
That Prince Charles and Lady Di were through  
Was waiting in line at the grocery store  
Took a peek at the dirt about Demi Moore  
And it took me by surprise I must say  
When I found out the Pope was gay  
I read it in the tabloids  
Elvis Presleys doing just fine  
They put it in the tabloids  
Got a look at Fergis boobs my my  
Honey honey yeah  
You know JFK didnt really die  
They got a picture and he looks all right  
And Ross Perots hanging out with ET  
This woman had a kid at a hundred and three  
And you could have seen it all for yourself  
Cause its right there upon the shelf  
Oh I read it in the tabloids  
You know Madonna used to be a boy  
I saw it in the tabloids  
Right next to a cure for hemorrhoids  
Honey honey yeah
