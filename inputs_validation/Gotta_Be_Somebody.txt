This time I wonder what it feels like  
To find the one in this life  
The one we all dream of  
But dreams just arent enough  
So Ill be waiting for the real thing  
Ill know it by the feeling  
The moment when were meeting  
Will play out like a scene straight off the silver screen  
So Ill be holdin my breath  
Right up to the end  
Until that moment when  
I find the one that Ill spend forever with  
  
Chorus  
Cause nobody wants to be the last one there  
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares  
Someone to love with my life in their hands  
Theres gotta be somebody for me like that  
Cause nobody wants to go it on their own  
And everyone wants to know theyre not alone  
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere  
Theres gotta be somebody for me out there  
  
Tonight out on the street out in the moonlight  
And damn it this feels too right  
Its just like deja vu  
Me standin here with you  
So Ill be holdin my breath  
Could this be the end  
Is it that moment when  
I find the one that Ill spend forever with  
  
Chorus  
  
You cant give up  
When youre lookin for a diamond in the rough  
Because you never know when it shows up  
Make sure youre holdin on  
Cause it could be the one the one youre waiting on  
  
Cause nobody wants to be the last one there  
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares  
Someone to love with my life in their hands  
Theres gotta be somebody for me  
  
Oh nobody wants to go it on their own  
And everyone wants to know theyre not alone  
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere  
Theres gotta be somebody for me out there  
  
Nobody wants to be the last one there  
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares  
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere  
Theres gotta be somebody for me out there
