Ive been up all night  
Ive been writing this letter  
And I think I might have found a better way  
To tell you all the things Ive got to say  
I put it in writing and youll get it in the mail today  
  
Well I dont know but I cant help feeling  
That you got to stop your doubledealin ways  
Cheatin on me is a crime that never pays  
And thats all in the letter and youll get it in the mail today  
  
Well I would tell you to your face  
But youd just lie to me  
Put you in your place  
But youd just try to defy me  
  
Been up all night  
Pencil and a paper  
And I think I might have found a safer way  
Say goodbye without much more delay  
Well its all in the letter and youll get it in the mail today  
I dont mean tomorrow  
Its all in the letter and youll get it in the mail today  
I dont mean no western union  
Its all in the letter and youll get it in the mail today
