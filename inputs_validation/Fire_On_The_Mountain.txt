We sit secure in timehonored traditions made  
Never wondering where or when the sickle may come  
If we dont seek our knowledge to be greater men  
When the rain starts falling gonna drown before we get our feet wet  
  
We build our ivory towers to protect us from the flood  
A fleet of vessels made of wood so they wont rust  
But can we see the bottom of the bottle when we start to drink  
Theres fire on the mountain fire and its coming our way  
  
Can we pick the pieces up  
Were mending Babylon  
Tryin to right the wrong  
Can we pick the pieces up  
  
Live learn life love die dust gone  
  
Theres fire on the mountain  
  
Can we pick the pieces up  
Were mending Babylon  
Tryin to right the wrong  
Can we pick the pieces up  
  
Live learn life love die dust gone
