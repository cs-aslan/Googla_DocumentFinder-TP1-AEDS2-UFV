La la la la la  
I only want to love you please dont push me away  
Let me in your life  
I wasnt there when he hurt you so why should I  
Have to pay let me in your life  
I want to share your tomorrows so I must beg you  
Today if hes the cause of your sorrows be glad  
That hes gone away  
I need someone let me love you please dont push  
Me away Let me in your life  
La la la la la
