By tomorrow morning  
At the early dawn  
I gotta hit the road  
So long lady  
Till another day right now  
I gotta be movin on  
Theres another town and  
The singer needs a song  
I know youre on your own  
Ill be back before too long  
I gotta do what I gotta do  
And you know how  
My heart loves to run I gotta ride  
  
Keep on ridin  
Keep on ridin now  
  
Theres a city waiting  
And a railroad station  
Where my face is known  
And an old hotel  
That I know so well  
Its a little bit like home  
Its a situation  
Not of my own choosing  
And though a gamblin man  
Would say that I was losing  
I started out to win  
And Ill do it again  
Im never givin in  
Cause if it comes down  
To my heart or to my pride  
Im gonna ride  
  
Keep on ridin keep on ridin  
Keep on ridin yeah  
Keep on ridin keep on ridin  
  
And I know you say  
Im driftin driftin on a dream  
Youd better watch your step boy  
It may not be what it seems  
I just cant shake  
This feeling here inside  
This heart of mine  
Keeps tellin me to ride ride ride
