Your bodies empty now  
As I hold you  
Now gone I miss you  
But I told you  
I remember bad times  
More than good  
Theres no coming back  
Even if we could  
I loved you to deth  
If I cant have you  
Than no one will  
And since I wont  
Ill have to kill  
My only love something  
Ive never felt  
Now youve gone to heaven  
And youll burn in hell  
I loved you to deth  
  
SoloMustaine  
  
And now Im down below  
And what do I see  
You didnt go to heaven  
Your down here with me  
And now coming back  
Baby take me please  
I really think I would  
If you werent such a sleaze  
I loved you once before  
You kept me on a string  
Id rather go without  
Than take what you would bring  
I loved you to deth
