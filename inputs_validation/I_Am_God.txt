Verse 1 Kirk Franklin  
Think Im gonna walk away  
Youre messing up my life today wassup  
This time I refuse to pray  
Still you keep calling me calling me  
I dont wanna see your face  
The thing I love you erased Come on  
Nothing but an empty space  
Now I dont know how to be  
I know it wasnt right for meYea  
What you liking what you need  
I feel like Im in surgery  
Still you cut deeper  
  
My secrets within  
My blanket of sin  
Lord how much longer till ya through with me  
Please take what you need can I get up now  
  
Chorus  
Be still and know I am God  
Be still and know I am God  
  
Verse 2 Toby Mac  
Loving you Lord is my way  
Everything you dont explain  
Somethings I dont want to change  
So you keep breaking me there you go  
Its like Im fighting for my life woo  
You hit me with another light  
I feel like Jacob in the night  
Wont stop till you bless me  
  
My flesh and my will yes father  
Is yours not to kill to kill  
Bringing myself to you come on  
But living sacrifice is more can I get up now

Kirk Franklin  
You win uh huh  
Ive been trying to do it on my own Yes Lord  
But right now I gotta surrender  
You know whats best Say it like you mean it  
Its not easy waiting on you  
Its not easy believing that you got this together  
But without faith it is impossible to please you We recognize you  
So Im gonna stand right here We are still before you  
You got me We are still before you You got me You got me

Be still Im yours and know we know Im yours I am God Im tired of
living on my own Im tired of living on my own  
Be still and know we know I am God You are God
