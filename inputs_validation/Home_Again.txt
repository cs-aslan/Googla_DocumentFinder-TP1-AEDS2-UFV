Home again I turned my collar to the wind started home again  
Home again a place where I can find the friends thats home again  
Well Ive seen everything that I wanted to see  
And I finally see whats important to me Im going home Im going home  
  
Home again Ive been too long upon my way this way dont pay  
Home again too many names I cant recall its coming home  
Well Ive done everything I thought I wanted to do  
When each step I took took me far away from you Im going home Im going home  
  
Home again I cant extend by even time joys aint crime  
Home again somehow I know theres time enough enough to love  
Well Ive had everything that I thought I would need  
Now Im going home Im gonna try my hand of freedom  
Im going home Im going home Im going home
