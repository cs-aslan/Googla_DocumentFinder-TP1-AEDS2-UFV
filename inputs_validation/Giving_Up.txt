If there should be the faintest traces  
Of you in my summer sky  
My heart would pound and race  
And people ask me why  
  
Did I pull those funny faces  
When I walk by the waterside  
I look for things to say  
And still I find you  
  
I wont give up  
Dont talk of giving up  
  
And every night I swear Ive finished  
And when I rise to face the day  
Resolve just fades away  
And so it follows  
  
Trying to find strength of purpose  
I place temptation out of reach  
Then search in every niche  
Until I find you  
  
I wont give up  
Dont talk of giving up  
I wont give it upLove this world  
No thoughts of giving up oh no no no no no  
  
Perhaps its only saints who suffer  
For those needs to which were slaved  
This roaad I walk is paved with good intentions  
The final choice hangs on a wire  
  
And theres no room for feet to stray  
The piper waits for pay  
And still I find you  
I wont give up  
Dont talk of giving up  
  
I wont give upLove this world  
No thoughts of giving up oh no no no no no  
I wont give it upLove this world  
Dont talk of giving up  
  
I wont give it upLove this world  
No thoughts on giving up
