Youre climbing up the ladder on this shaking monkey tree  
Dreams are coming true that are just far beyond belief  
Youre facing every storm thats blowing right into your face  
What happened was its waiting that youre falling in disgrace  
  
You really never know  
But life will always go  
Around around around around  
Around around around around  
Around around around life goes around  
  
Your heading for tomorrow for the better days in life  
But you can only make it if you stand the test of time  
  
You really never know  
But life will always go  
Around around around around  
Around around around around  
Around around around life goes around  
  
Just put a china in your pocket  
Keep it in there as long as you can  
Take the magic and just lock it  
Where youll still find the boy inside of man inside of man inside of man  
  
You really never know  
But life will always go  
Around around around around  
Around around around around  
Around around around life goes around  
  
Well you know sometimes life doesnt go straight  
It doesnt go left  
It doesnt go right  
Sometimes it just goes nowhere  
But in the end  
Life goes around  
  
Around around around around  
Around around around around  
Around around around life goes around  
  
Around around around around  
Around around around around  
Around around around life goes around
