Tears on your pillow thats evidence  
Crying all night it dont make no sense  
Never know what to do so the tears come out  
I used to wonder what this thing was about  
  
Youre so sensitive  
So willing to give  
Girl youre just a cutie yeah yeah  
But everything hits your tender spot  
I think I see just what youve got  
  
Emotion eyes see what they wanna see  
They just wont let it be  
Theres always something goin on  
Emotion eyes cant seem to be without  
Something to cry about  
They just get so emotional  
  
My oh mercy me just what do you see  
Nothing stops those tears from coming  
Whats the matter chile dont you ever smile  
Watching you is really something  
  
You dont need to struggle with your badness  
Cause youre the baddest girl therell ever be  
Youve got to learn to compromise  
Youve got to dry your weeping eyes  
Watch what you see with those  
  
You dont need to struggle with your badness  
Youre just the baddest girl therell ever be  
Youve got to learn to compromise  
Youve got to dry your weeping eyes  
Watch what you do with those
