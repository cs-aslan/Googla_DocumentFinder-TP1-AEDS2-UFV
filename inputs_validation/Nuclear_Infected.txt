Im nuclear infected  
I really dont mind  
I just go out when the sun goes down  
And have a real good time  
  
I can clear out any ballgame  
In a minute and a half  
Just show up  glow up  
And have a real good laugh  
  
When Im happy I glow yellow  
When Im sad I glow blue  
And I glow red hot when Im in bed with you  
  
Im nuclear infected  
Really aint that bad  
In fact its about the best time  
I guess I ever had  
  
Im nuclear infected  
Looking for a mate  
So slip on something lead babe  
And go out on a date  
  
When Im happy I glow yellow  
When Im sad I glow blue yeah  
And I glow red hot when Im in bed with you  
  
Nuclear infected  dont make me angry  
Nuclear infected  dont make shake  
Nuclear infected  dont get me to sneeze  
Nuclear infected  thats a big mistake  
  
I want to live on Three Mile Island  
Where things are clean and neat  
ause we dont have no health freaks  
Clutterin up our streets  
Im nuclear infected I need something to eat  
A China Syndrome Salad with plutonium and cheese  
  
When Im happy I glow yellow  
When Im sad I glow blue  
And I glow red hot when Im in bed with you
