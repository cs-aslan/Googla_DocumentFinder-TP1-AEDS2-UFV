When youre living for the love of  
A lifetime  
You wonder if the waiting will ever end  
And the right from the wrong  
That youve guarded so long  
Is closer that its ever been  
But sometimes a moment of weakness  
Can sacrifice the treasure of time  
And cause you to miss the miracle  
That god longs for you to find  
  
Chorus  
Theres a love he has for you  
Theres a heart that hes been saving  
Theres a joy beyond all measure  
That only comes from waiting  
Theres a love he has for you  
Its more than the hope youre holding to  
And you will find the only love thats true  
Is the love he has for you  
  
When youre torn between today  
And tomorrow  
And holding out for something you  
Cannot see  
Theres a strength you can find  
Knowing in gods own time  
Youll discover what he meant to be  
Cause love like the father intended  
Is more than just a state of the heart  
So dont give up hope in the holding on  
Cause no matter who you are  
  
Chorus
