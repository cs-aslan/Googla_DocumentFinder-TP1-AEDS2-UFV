Youre always dancing down the street  
With your suede blue eyes  
And every new boy that you meet  
He doesnt know the real surprise  
Here she comes again  
When shes dancing neath the starry sky  
Shell make you flip  
Here she comes again  
When shes dancing neath the starry sky  
You kinda like the way she dips  
  
Shes my best friends girl  
Shes my best friends girl  
  
And she used to be mine  
Youve got your nuclear boots  
And your drip dry glove  
And when you bite your lip  
Its some reaction to love
