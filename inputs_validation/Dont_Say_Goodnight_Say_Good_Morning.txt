Thought we could make it on our own  
Looks like we didnt get too far  
Love has found its way back home  
Guess time just couldnt change  
The way we are  
  
That old feeling comes so easy  
When your bodys close to mine  
I think our crazy hearts have finally made their  
Always one more time  
  
Chorus  
Dont say good night say good morning  
We can make it this time if we try  
Dont say good night say good morning  
And in the morning  
Never say goodbye  
  
The nights ours and were alone  
I know Ive wasted too much time  
Chasing rainbows that I could never run out  
Ive come back to make you mine  
  
Dont let the morning come too early  
Dont leave me here to face the day  
Take me in your arms and never let me go  
And dont let the feelings slip away  
  
Chorus x2
