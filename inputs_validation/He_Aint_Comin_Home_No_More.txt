Oh stairs  you look so high tonight  
CLIMBIN UP with all my might  
Where I got no heart to be  
Cause he aint comin home no more  
  
Oh room  Im all alone with you  
Tell me whats a women to do  
When her man is gone  
And he aint comin home no more  
  
Im all choked up  inside me  
Tryna hold back my tears  
You know  I just cant GET USED  
I just cant USED TO this loneliness  
How AM I gonna face the empty years  
  
Oh chair  Oh chair  
You sittin silent there  
Dont you even care  
That my babys gone  yea yea  
And he aint comin home no more  
  
Yes  for my babys gone  
And he aint comin home no more
