747 11 come to bust  
Somebody take me home I wanna live in lust  
When trust is low and stakes are high  
Thats all I ever did in Denver was die  
Thats all I ever did in New York was die  
Thats all I ever did in LA was die  
So put em up put em up to the sky  
And wave goodbye to Miss American Pie  
Cuz you been tellin lies you took it all and abused it  
Whatever happened to the feel good music  
Somewhere somehow someway somebody pulled the plug  
And left me sittin in a dirty little body  
  
I gotta tell you baby lifes been good to me  
And I know that makes you mad  
Cause thats something you cant see  
I got everything I ever wanted  
And Ill never give that back  
Oh I know you hate that fact  
But you aint gotta look at me like that  
I said you aint gotta look at me like that  
Whatchu lookin at  
Whatchu lookin at  
Whatchu lookin at  
Whatchu lookin at  
  
You run around pullin stunts like that  
See never in my life could I front like that  
I aint cut like that I couldnt run like that  
Im a keep it nonfiction and take my hatuh  
Remember back when things looked grim  
I spent a lot of time and money on whims  
I remember the crew remember the good times  
Remember the orange and I remember the sunshine  
Its all gone thats a thing of the past  
The fact remains that it moves real fast  
So why you sit around hopin things might change  
Ill be sittin pretty singin Hey Pockey Way  
  
I gotta tell you baby lifes been good to me  
And I know that makes you mad  
Cause thats something you cant see  
I got everything I ever wanted  
And Ill never give that back  
Oh I know you hate that fact  
But you aint gotta look at me like that  
I said you aint gotta look at me like that  
Whatchu lookin at  
Whatchu lookin at  
Whatchu lookin at  
Whatchu lookin at  
  
Youll hear me comin hummin songs of redemption huh  
Ive been oppressed for less that attention  
I got your extension but Ill probably never call  
Cause this time last year you aint seen me in your crystal ball  
And Im uphauled by things youve done  
Left a trail of wrongs and cant account for one  
Now youre done and Im glad but its a shame youd waste it  
You want this so bad you can taste it  
Detroit love can you feel that feel that  
Thats stick an move can you feel that feel that  
Im on the rack for the two triple zero  
Full failure all American Hero  
  
I gotta tell you baby lifes been good to me  
And I know that makes you mad  
Cause thats something you cant see  
I got everything I ever wanted  
And Ill never give that back  
Oh I know you hate that fact  
But you aint gotta look at me like that  
I said you aint gotta look at me like that  
Whatchu lookin at  
Whatchu lookin at  
Whatchu lookin at  
Whatchu lookin at  
  
Im here to tell you baby lifes been good to me  
I know that makes you mad  
Cause thats something you cant see  
I got everything I ever wanted  
And Ill never give that back  
I know you hate that fact  
But you aint gotta look at me like that  
I said you aint gotta look at me like that  
Whatchu lookin at  
Whatchu lookin at

Whatchu lookin at  
Whatchu lookin at  
Whatchu lookin at
