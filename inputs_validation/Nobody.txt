Nobody nobody will ever love you  
The way that I love you  
Cause nobodys that strong  
Loves bittersweet lifes treasures deep  
No one can keep a love thats gone wrong  
  
Nobody nobody gonna love you  
The way I could  
Cause nobodys that strong  
No nobodys that strong  
  
Nobody nobody is gonna love you  
The way that I love you  
Cause nobody is that strong  
  
Youve had many lovers  
Youll have many others  
But theyll only just break  
Your poor heart in two  
And nobody nobody will love you  
The way I could  
Cause nobodys that strong  
No nobodys that strong
