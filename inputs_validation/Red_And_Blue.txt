I think I love you  
You got ripped jeans  
Im only 19  
What do you wanna do  
  
You got your cigarette  
I got my headset  
Were two of a kind  
Youre spades and Im diamonds  
And you know that too  
  
Yeah you can see clearly  
That I am the one you want  
But I must admit that  
Im everything youre not  
  
Yeah I am red you are blue  
Im old school and youre so new  
But I guess I could forgive you tonight  
When youre cold I like to burn  
I cut lines you wait you turn  
But I guess I could forgive you tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight  
  
Dont shoot  
My heart is on mute  
Our physical dream  
Is only skin deep  
How do you wanna groove  
  
Bang Bang  
Should hear my gun ring  
Youre mine youre there  
Youll hear that  
I am all up inside your head  
  
Now I can see clearly  
That I am the one you want  
But I must admit that  
Im everything youre not  
  
Yeah I am red you are blue  
Im old school and youre so new  
But I guess I could forgive you tonight  
When youre cold I like to burn  
I cut lines you wait your turn  
But I guess I could forgive you tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight  
  
You wont forget me when Im gone  
This feels so good it cant be wrong  
I recommend a one night stand  
I know were just friends  
But youre my kind of man  
Just for tonight  
Just for tonight  
Just for tonight  
  
Even though Im red you are blue  
Im old school and youre so new  
I know we could be great for tonight  
When youre cold Ill make it burn  
Youll never have to wait your turn  
Yeah I guess I could forgive you tonight  
  
Yeah I am red you are blue  
Im old school and youre so new  
But I guess I could forgive you tonight  
When youre cold I like to burn  
I cut lines you wait your turn  
But I guess I could forgive you tonight  
Tonight tonight tonight
