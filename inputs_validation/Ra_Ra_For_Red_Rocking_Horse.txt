Did you think you knew the game  
Did you think that fame and fortunes  
All that I had in my head  
Bang youre dead  
Its not a game Im gonna play with you  
  
Did you think Im high and dry  
Did you think Id hide from the  
Tentacles of the deaf dumb and blind  
Their poison inks behind me  
At the bottom of the sea  
And your criticism doesnt worry me  
And Ill sing  
  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Ride on over all remorse  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Who won the course  
Despite the fact that  
No one bet him  
  
Get out  
Did you think youd tie me up  
Did you think that I would  
Help but dance for your piece of paper  
Theyll tame you and set you  
To licking all the foes  
Zap pow  
  
Did you think that I dont feel  
Did you think that Id simply heal up  
After each ego beating  
We cant go on meeting  
This once in every year  
And in the meantime if we all stand up  
And cheer him up here  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Ride on over all remorse  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Who won the course  
Despite the fact that  
No one bet him  
  
They all took their money out  
And they laid it down down  
On the bright colored manes  
They all took their money out  
But they laid it down down  
On the different names to ours  
  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Ride on over all remorse  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Who won the course  
Despite the fact that  
No one bet him  
  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Ride on over all remorse  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Who won the course  
Despite the fact
