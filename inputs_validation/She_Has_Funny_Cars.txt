Every day I try so hard to know your mind  
And find out whats inside you  
Time goes on and I dont know just who you are  
Or how Im going to find you  
  
You can do whatever you please  
The worlds waiting to be seized  
You can collect all neglect  
Or all the selfrespect you need what you need  
  
And I know And I know And I know  
  
Your minds guaranteed  
Its all youll ever need  
So what do you want with me  
  
We live but once  
But good things can be found around  
In spite of all the sorrow  
  
If you see black  
You cant look back  
You cant look front  
You cannot face tomorrow  
  
Some have it nice  
Fat and round flash paradise  
Theyre very wise to their disguise  
Trying to revolutionize tomorrow  
  
And I know And I know And I know  
  
Your minds guaranteed  
Its all youll ever need  
So what do you want with me
