In the days when I was young I never had to cry  
If I wanted a lover I did not have to try  
But I must have set my expectations far too high  
Guess Im just a silly boy  
  
I guess Im just a silly boy  
There are some things about love that I dont understand  
When you promise your heart you do the best you can  
But no matter how I try behaving like a man  
  
Seems Im just a silly boy  
I guess Im just a silly boy  
This is the last time Ill wait to stand in line  
If you dont come see me Im dropping the boom on you  
  
Cause when you lose me  
Then everyone will see what a silly girl can do  
Dont you tell me that its over  
Dont you make a sound  
  
Til I get to the river or someplace I can drown  
Cause I put my faith upon you and you let me down  
Guess Im just a silly boy  
I guess Im just a silly boy
