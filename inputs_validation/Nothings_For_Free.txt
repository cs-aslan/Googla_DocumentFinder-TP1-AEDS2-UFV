We started out  
With a sin and a lie  
And moved on to whats in it for me  
And when trouble washed up hell we just let it flow by  
And our kindness just washed out to sea  
  
They say Jesus died  
On the old rugged cross  
To save you from people like me  
And Daddy he slaved  
For an uncaring boss  
Cause nothin worth nothins for free  
  
Now saviors they work  
Lots of overtime  
And sinners just try to get by  
And the losers they play  
Til theyve spent their last dime  
With the comfort of knowing they tried  
  
Well they say Jesus died  
On the old rugged cross  
To save you from people like me  
And Daddy he worked  
For an uncaring boss  
Cause nothin worth nothins for free  
  
Well Ive lived a good life  
And Ive lived a bad  
And they both felt like sweet liberty  
And I felt the storm coming  
My redemption at hand  
And everything good comes for free  
  
Well they say Jesus died  
On the old rugged cross  
To save you from people like me  
And Daddy he slaved  
For an uncaring boss  
Nothin worth nothins for free  
  
Well they say Jesus died  
On the old rugged cross  
And nothin worth nothins for free
