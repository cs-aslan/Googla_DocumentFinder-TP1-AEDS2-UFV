Told you before stay away from my door  
Dont give me that brother brother brother brother  
The freaks on the phone wont leave me alone  
So dont give me that brother brother brother brother  
No  
  
I I found out  
I I found out  
  
Now that I showed you what I been through  
Dont take nobodys word what you can do  
  
There aint no Jesus gonna come from the sky  
Now that I found out I know I can cry  
  
I I found out  
I I found out  
  
Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand  
Dont get you nowhere dont make you a man  
I heard something bout my Ma and my Pa  
They didnt want me so they made me a star  
  
I I found out  
I I found out  
  
Old Hare Krishna got nothing on you  
Just keep you crazy with nothing to do  
Keep you occupied with pie in the sky  
There aint no guru who can see through your eyes  
  
I I found out  
I I found out  
  
Ive seen through junkies Ive been through it all  
I seen religion from Jesus to Paul  
Dont let them fool you with dope and cocaine  
No one can harm you feel your own pain  
  
I I found out  
I I found this out  
I I found out
