I like to walk in the summer breeze  
Down Dalling Road by the dead old trees  
And drink with my friends  
In the Hammersmith Broadway  
Dear dirty delightful old drunken old days  
  
Then the winter came down and I loved it so dearly  
The pubs and the bookies where youd spend all your time  
And the old men that were singing  
When the roses bloom again  
And turn like the leaves  
To a new summertime  
  
Now the winter comes down  
I cant stand the chill  
That comes to the streets around Christmas time  
And Im buggered to damnation  
And I havent got a penny  
To wander the dark streets of London  
  
Every time that I look on the first day of summer  
Takes me back to the place where they gave ECT  
And the drugged up psychos  
With death in their eyes  
And how all of this really  
Means nothing to me  
  
Now the winter comes down  
I cant stand the chill  
That comes to the streets around Christmas time  
And Im buggered to damnation  
And I havent got a penny  
To wander the dark streets of London  
  
Every time that I look on the first day of summer  
Takes me back to the place where they gave ECT  
And the drugged up psychos  
With death in their eyes  
And how all of this really  
Means nothing to me  
  
Now the winter comes down  
I cant stand the chill  
That comes to the streets around Christmas time  
And Im buggered to damnation  
And I havent got a penny  
To wander the dark streets of London  
To wander the dark streets of London  
To wander the dark streets of London
