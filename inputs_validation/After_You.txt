So September follows August I dont mind  
So three and four and the fifth comes after two  
Will anything mean anything do I care what tomorrow brings  
I only wonder what comes after you  
  
After you when someone smiles at me I wonder what to trust  
After you Ill be suspicious of anything thats nice  
I dont know that Ill get over you and if I ever do  
Ill never doubt this much again not after you  
  
Loving you its just to good to last forever  
So the world could end tomorrow I wont care  
After you when someone tells me theres no heaven on this earth  
I can say that I know better Ive been there  
  
After you when someone smiles at me Ill wonder what to trust  
After you Ill be suspicious of anything thats nice  
I dont know that Ill get over you and if I ever do  
Ill never doubt this much again not after you
