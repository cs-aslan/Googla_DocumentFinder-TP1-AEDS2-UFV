That old wind thats whipping out there  
Its whistlin your tune  
That wind blew pyramids to Egypt  
And footprints to the moon  
And that old star that you been wishin on  
Is shinin mighty bright  
But its the fire inside your heart  
Thats gonna lead you to the light  
How you ever gonna know  
What its like to live there  
How you ever gonna know victory  
How you ever gonna know  
What its like when dreams become reality  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to hold her  
How you ever gonna know  
What its like to dance  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never take a chance  
You know failure isnt failure  
If a lesson from its learned  
I guess love would not be love  
Without a risk of being burned  
Anything in life worth havin  
Lord it has its sacrifice  
But the gift that youre receiving  
Is worth more than a price  
How you ever gonna know  
What its like to live there  
How you ever gonna know  
What you never knew  
How you ever gonna know  
If youre down here doin  
What the good Lord put you here to do  
How you ever gonna know  
If you could have done it  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to fly  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never dare to try  
Listen not to the critics  
Who put their own dreams on the shelf  
If you want to get the truth to admit it  
You gotta find out for yourself  
How you ever gonna know  
What its like to be there  
How you ever gonna know  
If youre the best  
How you ever gonna know  
What you believe in  
If you dont put it to the test  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to hold him  
How you ever gonna know  
What livin means  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never chase the dreams  
How you ever gonna know  
Your potential  
How you ever gonna know victory  
How you ever gonna know  
What its like when dreams become reality  
How you ever gonna know  
How it feels to hold her  
How you ever gonna know  
What its like to dance  
How you ever gonna know  
If you never take a chance
