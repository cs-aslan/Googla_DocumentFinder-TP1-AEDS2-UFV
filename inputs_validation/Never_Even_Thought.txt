Never even thougt it would happen to me  
Maybe Ive been blind  
Only others can see Im in love  
What am I to do can I let it show  
Do I keep it to myself  
Or should I let her know Im in love  
Do I nurse it in my heart  
Hold it back in my eyes  
Hide it all inside  
Or put on a disguise Im in love  
Have I gotta play games  
Even suffer the pain  
Let the secret out  
Even suffer the doubt Im in love  
I know its all there  
I really wanna share my life  
With someone else  
Will she feel the same  
What am I to docan I let it show  
Do I keep it to myself  
Or should I let her know Im in love  
It isnt so easy when youve broken before  
But it isnt so hard when youre ready for more  
Could you love me  
Give me a simple clue  
Anything will do  
So long as I know  
Whats in me is in you  
Could you love me  
Ive got so much of care to give away  
Theres only one thing I wanna hear you say  
I love you  
Have I gotta play games  
Even suffer the pain  
Let the secret out  
Even suffer the doubt Im in love  
I know its all there  
I really wanna share my life  
With someone else  
Will she feel the same
