Hit the ground hit the ground hit the ground oh oh  
Only sound only sound that you hear is no  
You never saw it coming  
Slipped when you started running  
And now youve come undone and I I I I  
  
Seen you fall seen you crawl on your knees eh eh  
Seen you lost in a crowd seen your colors fade  
Wish I could make it better  
Someday you wont remember  
This pain you thought would last forever and ever  
  
And there youll stand ten feet tall  
I will say I knew it all along  
Your eyes wider than distance  
This lifes sweeter than fiction  
  
Just a shot just a shot in the dark oh oh  
All you got all you got are your shattered hopes  
They never saw it coming  
You hit the ground running  
And now youre onto something I I I say  
  
What a sight what a sight when the light came on  
Proved me right proved me right when you proved them wrong  
And in this perfect weather  
Its like we dont remember  
The rain we thought would last forever and ever  
  
And there youll stand ten feet tall  
I will say I knew it all along  
Your eyes wider than distance  
This lifes sweeter than fiction  
  
There youll stand next to me  
All at once the rest is history  
Your eyes wider than distance  
This lifes sweeter than fiction fiction  
  
Ill be one of the many saying  
Look at you now look at you now now  
Ill be one of the many saying  
You made us proud you made us proud proud  
Ill be one of the many saying  
Look at you now look at you now now  
Ill be one of the many saying  
You made us proud you made us proud proud  
  
And when they call your name  
And they put your picture in a frame  
You know that Ill be there time and again  
Cause I loved you when when you  
  
Hit the ground hit the ground hit the ground oh oh  
Only sound only sound that you heard was no  
Now in this perfect weather  
Its like we dont remember  
The rain we thought would last forever and ever forever  
  
There youll stand ten feet tall  
I will say I knew it all along  
Your eyes wider than distance  
This lifes sweeter than fiction  
  
There youll stand next to me  
All at once the rest is history  
Your eyes wider than distance  
This lifes sweeter than fiction fiction  
  
Its sweeter than fiction  
Its sweeter yeah  
Its sweeter than sweeter  
Sweeter than fiction
