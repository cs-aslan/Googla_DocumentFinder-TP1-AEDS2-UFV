Well theres two sides to every situation  
Yes theres two sides two interpretations  
A laugh is a cry hello means goodbye  
Youre sayin something baby I dont wanna buy  
  
Well theres two sides to every creation  
You and me babe were no revelation  
Well theres darkness in our light and theres wrong in our right  
Theres sorry babe Im workin late tonight  
  
Well theres two sides theres another side of me  
Theres the one you think you live with the one you never see  
Its never really lived but its never really died  
Its never really made it but its tried  
  
Well theres two sides to every conversation  
But with you babe thats no consolation  
Silence is golden let me put you on hold  
Danglin on your love line baby its growin old  
  
Well I dont know how to say it  
Cause I never thought I could  
God know Ive tried so many times  
  
  
But theres two sides theres another side of me  
Theres the one you think you live with the one you never see  
Its never really lived but its never really died  
Its never really made it but its tried  
  
To every creation  
Were no revelation  
One sees the wrong and one sees the right  
The other side of me just caught a flight  
  
Goodbye
