As I look out tonight up at your silver light  
You are the one Im counting on  
Christmas star so warm and wise there  
Can you please tell me  
Where shes gone  
  
She was my stare this eve  
A very breath of me  
How could I let her walk away  
Christmas star tell her Im sorry  
Hope to guide her journey home this day  
  
Christmas star  
If she could just hear me now  
If I could just tell her I care  
And hold her again in my arms  
Christmas star  
Can you see from your sky above  
If shes falling in love or dreaming her dream  
Felling lonesome like me  
  
I should be strong I know  
Should try and let her go  
But Id give my life if I could just believe  
Youll be sending my love back home this Christmas  
Eve  
  
Christmas star  
If she could just hear me now  
If I could just tell her I care  
And hold her again in my arms  
Christmas star  
I would kiss away all these lies  
She would know from my eyes just how precious we were  
  
If only I could reach her  
  
And so old friend up there  
If you can hear my prayer  
Wont you try and help this lonely man believe  
Youll be sending my love back home this Christmas  
Eve  
  
Christmas star  
Christmas star  
So warm and wise there  
Christmas star  
If I could just tell her Im sorry  
Christmas star  
Then maybe shell run to my side  
  
Christmas star  
Hoh Oh  
If she could just hear me now  
Oh How could I ever let her walk away  
Where is she gone  
Where is she tonight  
I need her home to stay  
Yeah  
  
Id give her the love she needs the dreams  
All to grab her in my arms again  
Id give my life my soul  
My heart is breaking please send her home  
Send her home to me this day  
  
It aint christmas without her  
And without her  
It could never be christmas again
