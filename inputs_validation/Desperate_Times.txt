Last night I dreamt of you Abbie Hoffman peddling your books  
I gave five bucks to you the other kids just gave you dirty looks  
I said Im sorry it didnt work out quite the way you planned  
You said Thats silly boy the revolution is at hand  
And if you got a ten spot brother I got a dime  
These are desperate desperate times  
Last night I dreamt of you Pepe Lopez strung out on a stage  
It dont even look like you smiling like sawedoff twenty gauge  
I still remember the Telecaster down around your knees  
Its late November and I think I smell tequila on the breeze  
And if you got the Cuervo honey I got the lime  
These are desperate desperate times  
And if you got the shotgun honey I got the crime  
These are desperate desperate times
