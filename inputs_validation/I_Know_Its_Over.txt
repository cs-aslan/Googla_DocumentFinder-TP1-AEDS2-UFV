Oh Mother I can feel the soil falling over my head  
And as I climb into an empty bed  
Oh well Enough said  
I know its over  still I cling  
I dont know where else I can go  
Oh  
  
Oh Mother I can feel the soil falling over my head  
See the sea wants to take me  
The knife wants to slit me  
Do you think you can help me  
  
Sad veiled bride please be happy  
Handsome groom give her room  
Loud loutish lover treat her kindly  
Though she needs you  
More than she loves you  
And I know its over  still I cling  
I dont know where else I can go  
Over and over and over and over  
Over and over la  
  
I know its over  
And it never really began  
But in my heart it was so real  
And you even spoke to me and said   
If youre so funny  
Then why are you on your own tonight   
And if youre so clever  
Then why are you on your own tonight   
If youre so very entertaining  
Then why are you on your own tonight   
If youre so very goodlooking  
Why do you sleep alone tonight   
I know  
  
Cause tonight is just like any other night  
Thats why youre on your own tonight  
With your triumphs and your charms  
While theyre in each others arms  
Its so easy to laugh  
Its so easy to hate  
It takes strength to be gentle and kind  
Over over over over  
  
Its so easy to laugh  
Its so easy to hate  
It takes guts to be gentle and kind  
Over over  
Love is natural and real  
But not for you my love  
Not tonight my love  
Love is natural and real  
But not for such as you and I my love  
  
Oh Mother I can feel the soil falling over my head  
Oh Mother I can feel the soil falling over my head  
Oh Mother I can feel the soil falling over my head  
Oh Mother I can feel the soil falling over my   
Oh Mother I can feel the soil falling over my head  
Oh Mother I can even feel the soil falling over my head  
Oh Mother I can feel the soil falling over my head  
Oh Mother I can feel the soil falling over my
