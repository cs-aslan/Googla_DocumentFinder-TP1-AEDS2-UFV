Round and round the Christmas tree  
Presents hanging there for you and me  
Lights all shining merrily  
Christmas a week away  
  
Aring around the Christmas tree  
Children making up a melody  
Grownups laughing happily  
Christmas a day away  
  
Wishing hoping boxes to open  
But we agree its right to wait  
Turkey and dressing after the blessing  
And theres just a night to wait  
  
Round and round the Christmas tree  
Opening presents with the family  
One for you and two for me  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
  
Ding dong ding dong ding dong  
Ding dong ding dong ding dong  
Tralalalalalalalala  
  
Round and round the Christmas tree  
Presents hanging there for you and me  
Lights all shining merrily  
Christmas a week away  
  
Lights all shining merrily  
Christmas a week away  
Lalalalalalalalala  
Lalalalalalalalala  
Lalalalalalalalala  
Lalalalalalalalala  
  
Wishing hoping boxes to open  
But we agree its right to wait  
Turkey and dressing after the blessing  
And theres just a night to wait  
  
Round and round the Christmas tree  
Opening presents with the family  
One for you and two for me  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
Oh what a Christmas Day
