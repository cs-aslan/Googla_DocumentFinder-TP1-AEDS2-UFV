Happy happy birthday baby  
Although youre with somebody new  
Thought Id drop a line to say  
That I wish this happy day  
Would find me beside you  
Happy happy birthday baby  
No I cant call you my baby  
Seems like years ago we met  
On a day I cant forget  
Cause thats when we fell in love  
  
Do you remember  
The names we had for each other  
I was your pretty  
You were my baby  
Oh how could we say goodbye  
  
Hope I didnt spoil your birthday  
Im not acting like a lady  
So Ill close this note to you  
With good luck and wishes too  
Happy happy birthday baby
