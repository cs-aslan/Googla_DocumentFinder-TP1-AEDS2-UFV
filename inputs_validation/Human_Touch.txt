I know Ive just gotta get out of this place  
I cant stand any more of that mechanical grace  
Though you say its only industrial squeeze  
It looks like luxury and feels like a disease  
  
Chorus  
Oh give it to me give it to me  
I dont want to know much about much  
Give it to me give it to me  
I need I need I need the human touch  
  
Left with just a house to hold  
Drinking your way to drydock  
Its easy to break up a model citizen  
Living in the state of shock  
  
I just cant believe I am responsible for this  
What the makeup hides cant be hidden with a kiss  
  
When Im talking in tongues I go where you lead  
I dont make you plead oh I need you  
How Id like to fix her in a picture of rage  
How Id like to catch her when shes acting her age  
But when shes laying stretched out on the floor  
Its no mystery to me anymore  
  
Chorus
