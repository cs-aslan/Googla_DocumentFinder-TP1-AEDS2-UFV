Do you remember you said to me  
That you would wait wait for me eternally  
Ive been wondering and Ive been hoping  
your still the same only you can say  
Ill be so glad to be back with you  
Ill do anything you want me to  
  
Thats what I want Ill be so happy back home  
I see your light shine in my window  
And I know I am coming home  
And as the light grows grows ever brighter  
I see your face you are alone  
And when I tell you all the things I have seen  
Youll say that darling you must have been dreaming  
  
Thats what I want Ill be so happy back home  
Electric visions have crossed strange decisions have crossed  
I felt the stars above me I have someone to love me  
Thats what I want Ill be so happy back home  
  
Believe me baby when I say I wish I never never  
never never never be away  
For the things that I see Be meant for the eyes of a time  
And when we walk alone together  
Thats how I want it to be want it to be forever  
  
Thats what I want Ill be so happy  
Thats what I want Ill be so happy  
Thats what I want Id be so happy back home
