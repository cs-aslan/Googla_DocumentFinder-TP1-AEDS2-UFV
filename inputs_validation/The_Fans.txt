Before we ever made the headlines  
Or toured the concert halls  
We survived our share of bar rooms  
Stared at many motel walls  
  
The years in Carolina  
And all the one night stands  
What kept the fires a burnin  
Back then was you the fans  
  
We two stepped out to Texas  
Round and round the dance hall floors  
Played the fair in Minnesota  
I wish we couldve played one more  
  
We hope you remember  
Were just the boys in the band  
And what keeps the fires a burnin  
Is always you the fans  
  
I wish this night could last forever  
Ah but the show must go on  
And well take home the memories  
And well leave you with our songs  
  
Its been good to see yall  
Can we come back again And again and again  
What keeps the fires a burnin  
In us is you the fans  
  
As long as you remember  
The boys in the band  
Well keep the fires a burnin  
For all of you our fans
