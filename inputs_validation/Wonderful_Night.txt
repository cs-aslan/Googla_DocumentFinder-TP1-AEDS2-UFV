Its a wonderful night and the music is right  
Will you dance with me and hold me tight  
I dont know why I feel this way  
Its how I feel when they start to play  
That old song we heard so long ago  
That I wonder if I can remember every word  
  
Its amazing how fast years have gone past  
And that some kinds of love just dont seem to last  
But win or loose I love you still  
Its you I choose and I always will  
And that old song we heard so long ago  
Still reminds me of the girl I used to know  
  
But thats all in a dream thats been over for years  
Now things are what they seem only minus the tears  
  
So I think of you now the way you were then  
And Ill manage somehow to keep trying again  
But I dont mind if you dont write  
Cause I recall that magic night  
And that old song we heard so long ago  
Was more beautiful than the love we used to share  
Yes that old song we heard so long ago  
Was more beautiful than the love we used to share  
Yes that old song
