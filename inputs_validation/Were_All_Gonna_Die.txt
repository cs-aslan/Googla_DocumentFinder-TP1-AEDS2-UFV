Were all gonna die  
When I was a very young boy mamma told me we all gonna die  
Mamma said son love cant be trusted its just another weakness  
We all gonna die  
  
Chorus   
Baby dont cry praise the most high tell you no lie  
Were all gonna die  
Baby dont cry praise the most high tell you no lie  
We all gonna die  
  
Now Im grown seen a lot livin made a few friends  
Gonna get high hoping I dont take more than Im given  
Judgement day comin we all gonna die  
If my wings should fail me lord meet me with another pair  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby getting born old man dien  
Young lady laughin old woman cryin  
Leaving like a lamb comin back like a lion  
Babylon to Zion were all gonna die  
  
Praise the most high were all gonna die  
When I was a very young boy mamma told me were all gonna die  
Mama said son love cant be trusted  
Its just another weakness were all gonna die  
Praise the most high were all gonna die  
If my wings should fail me lord meet me with another pair  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X
