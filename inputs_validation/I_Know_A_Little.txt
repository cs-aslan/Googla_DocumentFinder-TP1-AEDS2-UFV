Yes sir  
  
Well the bigger the city well the brighter the lights  
The bigger the dog well the harder the bite  
I dont know where you been last night  
But I think mama you aint doin right  
  
Chorus  
Say I know a little  
I know a little about it  
I know a little  
I know a little bout it  
I know a little bout love  
And baby I can guess the rest  
  
Well now I dont read that daily news  
Cause it aint hard to figure  
Where people get the blues  
They cant dig what they cant use  
If they stick to themselves  
Theyd be much less abused  
  
Chorus  
  
Play me a little oh yeah  
Yeah  
  
Well if you want me to be your only man  
Said listen up mama teach you all I can  
Do right baby by your man  
Dont worry mama teach you all I can  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I know a little bout love  
Baby I want your best
