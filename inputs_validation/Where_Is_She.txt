A police car was outside your house today  
I havent seen you in a couple of days  
They knocked on your door and then they went away  
Your mother looked scared but she didnt cry  
She didnt cry  
  
On one hand Ive got myself to blame  
But on the other its always the same  
Follow suit  
Shake your head tell me that its a lie  
I dont want you for dead but I want you to die  
Without a good friend on a sunshine  
I know I want survival but you dont know why  
  
Where is she  
Where is she  
Where is my baby girl  
Oh Ive seen you youre crazy  
What have you done with my whole wide world  
  
On one hand Ive got myself to blame  
But on the other its always the same thing  
Follow suit  
Shake your head tell me that its a lie  
I dont want you for dead but I want you to die  
Without a good friend on a bad day  
Without a soft surrender but what do you say  
  
All of these tears that weve cried  
All of these tears that weve cried  
  
Where is she  
Where is she  
Where is my baby girl  
Oh Ive seen you youre crazy  
What have you done with my whole wide world  
  
Where is she  
Where is she  
Where is my baby girl  
Oh Ive seen you youre crazy  
What have you done with my whole wide world  
What have you done with my whole wide world  
What have you done
