Oh if you knew what I know  
Youd be glad to let him go  
A guy that stays true is hard one to find  
Ive heard my old flame is now on your mind  
But if you knew what I know  
Youd be glad to let him go  
Has he told you of the joys that we knew  
Or does he pretend he loves only you  
Cause if you knew what I know  
Youd be glad to let him go  
Someday youll know his love isnt real  
Hell come back to me and then how will you feel  
Cause hell cheat on you like he cheated on me  
So send him back now while your hearts still free  
Cause if you knew what I know  
Youd be glad to let him go  
Youd be glad to let him go
