Last night I lay trembling  
The moon it was low  
It was the end of love  
Of misery and woe  
  
Then suddenly above me  
Her face buried in light  
Came a vision of beauty  
All covered in white  
  
Now the belltower is ringing  
And the night has stole past  
O Lucy can you hear me  
Wherever you rest  
  
Ill love her forever  
Ill love her for all time  
Ill love her till the stars  
Fall down from the sky  
Now the belltower is ringing  
And I shake on the floor  
O Lucy can you hear me  
When I call and call  
  
Now the belltower is ringing  
And the moon it is high  
O Lucy can you hear me  
When I cry and cry and cry
