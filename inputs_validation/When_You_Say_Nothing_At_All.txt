Its amazing how you can speak right to my heart  
Without saying a word you can light up the dark  
Try as I may I could never explain  
What I hear when you dont say a thing  
  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me  
Theres a truth in your eyes sayin youll never leave me  
The touch of your hand says youll catch me wherever I fall  
You say it best when you say nothing at all  
  
All day long I can hear people talking out loud  
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd  
Old Mr Webster could never define  
Whats being said between your heart and mine  
  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me  
Theres a truth in your eyes sayin youll never leave me  
The touch of your hand says youll catch me wherever I fall  
You say it best when you say nothing at all  
  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me  
Theres a truth in your eyes sayin youll never leave me  
The touch of your hand says youll catch me wherever I fall  
You say it best when you say nothing at all
