I beat my machine its a part of me its inside of me  
Im stuck in this dream its changing me I am becoming  
The me that you know had some second thoughts  
Hes covered with scabs and he is broken and sore  
The me that you know doesnt come around much  
That part of me isnt here anymore  
All pain disappears its the nature of my circuitry  
Drowns out all I hear theres no escape from this my new consciousness  
That me that you know used to have feelings  
But the blood has stopped pumping and hes left to decay  
The me that you know is now made up of wires  
And even when Im right with you Im so far away  
I can try to get away but Ive strapped myself in  
I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears  
I can see it killing away all my bad parts  
I dont want to listen but its all too clear  
Hiding backwards inside of me I feel so unafraid  
Annie hold a little tighter I might just slip away  
It wont give up it wants me dead  
Goddamn this noise inside my head
