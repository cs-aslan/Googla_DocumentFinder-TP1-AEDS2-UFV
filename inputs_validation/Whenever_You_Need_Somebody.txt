Heey ooh ooh  
I know that life seems hard cruel and unkind  
A lonesome journey with questions in your mind  
Ill hold your weary hand as you walk down the road  
Remember youre never alone no  
  
Chorus  
Whenever you need somebody  
Whenever you want someone  
To reach out and touch you  
With a love that is strong  
Whenever you need somebody  
Whenever you want a friend  
To chase away the clouds and help the sun shine again  
I will be that friend  
  
If I could have one wish this I would pray  
A heavenly miracle your pain to drift away  
So Ill keep on prayin until that day comes  
Remember that Ill be the one the one  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill give you strength in times youre feeling weak  
Ill give you hope and help you to believe  
Yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna be a friend  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
Im gonna be that friend  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Right by your side  
Im gonna be that friend  
Ooh oooh
