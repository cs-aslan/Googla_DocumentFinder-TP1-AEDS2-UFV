When your loves flown out the window  
And the pain comes through the door  
Once again youve missed the boat  
And youre stranded on the shore  
And you find out that what you had  
Was never yours at all  
Friends and lovers that you knew so well  
Will never take your calls  
So  
You blame the weather  
Ohoh  
Blame the weather  
Ohoh  
Blame the weather  
Ohoh  
Cant you see youre in your prime  
Youre turning creases into lines  
If you play the game  
Youve got to be prepared to take a knock  
You get put down so many times  
But you keep on getting up  
So put your tears away  
And dont forget to worry is a crime  
Nothing bears thinking about too much  
Youll be old before your time  
So  
You blame the weather  
Ohoh  
Blame the weather  
Ohoh  
Blame the weather  
Ohoh  
Cant you see youre in your prime  
Youre turning creases into lines  
The pool of tears you left to drown in  
The helping hands that never came  
The years you lost out to another  
All up in flames  
So  
You blame the weather  
Ohoh  
Blame the weather  
Ohoh  
Blame the weather  
Ohoh  
Cant you see youre in your prime  
Youre turning creases into lines
