How long can this go on are you still actin the same old crazy way  
I think theres something wrong I think somebody took your heart away  
I believe someone took your love away I want to bring love back to stay  
But if somehow I dont get to you youll still be okay  
How long can this lonely night be I sing the same old sad love song  
Its the only song I know its just like me  
And I believe someone took your love away I want to bring love back today  
But if somehow I dont get to you youll still be okay  
I believe someone took your love away I want to bring love back to stay  
But if somehow I dont get to you youll still be okay  
How many times can I tell you the same old story I say the same old line  
I love you baby thats what Im worryin about  
I believe someone took your love away I want to bring you a heart today  
But if somehow I dont get to you youre still okay  
I believe someone took your heart away I want to bring you a heart today  
But if somehow I dont get to you baby youll be okay  
So Ill try try here Im a tryin to find another way to say I really love  
You  
I may not ever win Im gonna sing this song tryin to talk to you  
I belive someone took your love away I want to bring you a heart today  
But if somehow I dont get to you youre still okay
