The earth is crumbling the end is near  
No ones listening Im filled with fear  
Hear the warning in the prophets word  
Day by day were destroying this world  
No more water  
No more blue skies  
No one cares no one tries  
To save what we once had  
World at war a world at war  
Rich and poor rich and poor  
Burn in hell burn in hell  
Hear dooms days bells dooms days bells  
Ringing loud ringing loud  
I see black clouds  
We are making lucifer so proud  
World at war a world at war  
Rich and poor rich and poor  
Burn in hell burn in hell  
Hear dooms days bells dooms days bells  
Ringing loud ringing loud  
I see black clouds  
We are making lucifer so proud  
Blind leading the blind  
No one sees the seventh sign  
Were left behind  
Theres no more hope the day has come  
What we have done cant be undone  
Too many years weve lived in sin  
We know for sure the beast will win  
Fight fire with fire to start to run  
Dont trust a liar like we have done  
Weve lost the battle to the evil one  
Blind leading the blind  
No one sees the seventh sign  
Were left behind
