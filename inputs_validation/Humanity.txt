Humanity  
Auf wiedersehen  
Its time to say goodbye  
The partys over  
As the laughter dies  
An angel cries  
  
Humanity  
Its au revoir to your insanity  
You sold your soul to feed your vanity  
Your fantasies and lies  
  
Youre a drop in the rain  
Just a number not a name  
And you dont see it  
You dont believe it  
At the end of the day  
Youre a needle in the hay  
You signed and sealed it  
And now you gotta deal with it  
Humanity  
Humanity  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
Be on your way  
Adios amigo theres a price to pay  
For all the egotistic games you played  
The world you made  
Is gone  
  
Youre a drop in the rain  
Just a number not a name  
And you dont see it  
You dont believe it  
At the end of the day  
Youre a needle in the hay  
You signed and sealed it  
And now you gotta deal with it  
Humanity  
Humanity  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
Run and hide theres fire in the sky  
Stay inside  
The waters gonna rise and pull you under  
In your eyes Im staring at the end of time  
Nothing can change us  
No one can save us from ourselves  
  
Youre a drop in the rain  
Just a number not a name  
And you dont see it  
You dont believe it  
At the end of the day  
Youre a needle in the hay  
You signed and sealed it  
Now you gotta deal with it  
Humanity  
Humanity  
Humanity  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye
