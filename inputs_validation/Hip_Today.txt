youll be gone tomorrow  
youll be gone tomorrow  
gone tomorrow  
  
youre preoccupied  
with the latest fashion  
hip today hip today  
with wide open eyes  
on the next big thing  
you can cash in  
hip today hip today  
  
no never contrived  
its an overnight sensation  
a clever disguise  
that hides all of your  
pretension  
sallys selling out  
her seashells for souls  
hope i dont die  
before i get old  
  
hip today  
youll be gone tomorrow  
youll be gone tomorrow  
gone tomorrow  
  
dancing in your head  
visions of rave reviews  
hip today hip today  
believing all thats read  
conceiving another guru  
hip today hip today  
  
having made your bed  
falling short of filling shoes  
youve been left for dead  
cause theres always  
someone new  
sallys selling out  
her seashells for souls  
hope i dont die  
before i get old
