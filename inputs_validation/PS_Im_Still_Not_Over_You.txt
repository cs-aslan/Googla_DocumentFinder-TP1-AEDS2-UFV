Whats up  
I know we havent spoken for a while  
But I was thinkin bout you  
And it kinda made me smile  
So many things to say  
And Ill put em in a letter  
And thought it might be easier  
The words might come out better  
Hows your mother hows your little brother  
Does he still look just like you  
So many things I wanna know the answers to  
Wish I could press rewind  
And rewrite every line  
To the story of me and you  
  
Chorus  
Dont you know Ive tried and Ive tried  
To get you out my mind  
But it dont get no better  
As each day goes by  
And Im lost and confused  
Ive got nothin to lose  
Hope to hear from you soon  
PS Im still not over you  
Still not over you  
  
Excuse me I really didnt mean to ramble on  
But theres a lot of feelings that remain since youve gone  
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me  
But it seems theres always somethin right there to remind me  
Like a silly joke or somethin on the tv  
Boy it aint easy  
When I hear our song  
I get that same old feeling  
Wish I could press rewind  
Turn back the hands of time  
And I shouldnt be telling you  
  
Chorus  
  
Did you know I kept all of your pictures  
Dont have the strength to part with them yet  
Oh no  
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste  
But some things a girl can never forget  
  
Chorus
