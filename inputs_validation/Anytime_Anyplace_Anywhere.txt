CHORUS  
Anytime anyplace anywhere  
Ill never forget what we shared  
Comes a day theres a knock on my door  
I hope that youll be standing there  
Ill wonder what youll say if we meet  
On the street one day years from now  
Maybe youll need time to recall  
Oh but I wont need anytime at all  
Now I guess weve come from circle  
Cause were parting as friends  
CHORUS  
Love can make the tears in the rain  
And the brightest flame can fade away  
When you look into the eyes of a friend  
Theres a feeling in your heart that will never end  
After all the songs I sang you  
Theres no doubt in my mind  
CHORUS  
Another roads ahead of me the night moves on  
This heart never lies these tears in my eyes say carry on  
CHORUS  
Any day any week any month any year  
Ill never forget what we shared  
Comes a day theres a knock on my door  
I hope that youll be standing there
