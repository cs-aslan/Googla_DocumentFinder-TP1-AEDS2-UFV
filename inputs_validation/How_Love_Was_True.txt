Ooh love was true yesterday  
I love you evry way  
I saw you standing there  
You gave me cause to stare  
And then I knew I had to have you  
  
You could be mine if you tried  
All that you do is tell me lies  
You think that loves a game  
But I dont feel the same  
I should have known that Ill get the pain  
  
Ooh love was true yesterday  
I love you evry way  
I saw you standing there  
You gave me cause to stare  
And then knew I had to have you
