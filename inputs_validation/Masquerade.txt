This scenes so hypnotic  
Smoking mirrors lights and magic  
Paper faces in gold  
Theres solider boys beauty queens  
Everyones a mystery  
Its got me losing control  
  
Yearning Im yearning for the one to steal my eyes  
Wanna play in this game of disguise  
  
Its a masquerade a love parade  
So wont you stay and dance with me  
All though the night and day  
My masquerade I need you baby  
So stay with me tonight  
  
Masquerade masquerade masquerade masquerade  
Masquerade masquerade masquerade masquerade  
  
Just like a perfect dream  
I dont ever wanna leave  
A thousand freaks in the show  
Ones a tiger ones a lynx  
Ones a king that suffering  
Moving high moving love  
  
Burning Im burning cant you see it in my eyes  
Wanna play in this game of disguise  
  
Its a masquerade a love parade  
So wont you stay and dance with me  
All though the night and day  
My masquerade I need you baby  
So stay with me tonight  
  
Masquerade masquerade masquerade masquerade  
Masquerade masquerade masquerade masquerade  
  
I gotta know the girl behind the mask  
Let me in where you been dont pretend  
Dreamed that I had her alone  
Show your face to me we could be everything  
  
Its a masquerade a love parade  
So wont you stay and dance with me  
All though the night and day  
My masquerade I need you baby  
So stay with me tonight  
  
A masquerade a love parade  
So wont you stay and dance with me  
All though the night and day  
My masquerade I need you baby  
So stay with me tonight  
  
Masquerade masquerade masquerade masquerade  
Masquerade masquerade masquerade masquerade
