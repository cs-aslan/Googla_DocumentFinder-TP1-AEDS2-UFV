Blue blue days and long black nights  
Lonesome tears youre gonna cry for me  
  
And little baby  
Youd better start baby and leave  
  
Think it over before you leave  
I got the love that kind you need  
  
And little baby  
Youd better start baby and leave  
  
Ill rave on with the things you say  
You say youre gonna leave but thatll be the day  
  
Maybe baby you dont know  
I left Peggy Sue a long time ago  
  
Shes the girl on my mind  
Everyday through all the time  
  
And little baby  
Youd better start baby and leave  
  
Ill rave on with those things you say  
You say youre gonna leave but thatll be the day  
  
Maybe baby you dont know  
I left Peggy Sue a long time ago  
  
Shes the girl on my mind  
Everyday through all the time  
  
And little baby  
Youd better start baby and leave  
  
And little baby  
Youd better start baby and leave
