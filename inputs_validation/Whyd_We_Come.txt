Intro  
Everyone says weve come such a long long way  
Were civilized isnt that nice  
Weve gotten so smart  
We know how to blow the whole world apart  
But when it comes to the simple things  
like living together    ha  
Verse  
Whyd we have to come all this way  
Is anything any easier to understand  
Whyd we have to come all this way  
Are we any smarter than primitive men  
We still fall in love though we know better  
Anything at all just to stay together  
Stop wasting all my time  
Chorus  
Why did we come all this way  
Why did we come all this way  
Why did we come all this way  
Why did we come all this way  
Verse  
Whyd we have to come all this way  
We could have quit while we were way ahead  
Whyd we have to come all this way  
We could have just stayed home instead  
The road was long and the journey was hard  
We never even dreamed that wed come so far  
Chorus  
Bridge  
It didnt have to end up like this  
It didnt have to end up like this  
It didnt have to end up like this  
It didnt have to end up like this
