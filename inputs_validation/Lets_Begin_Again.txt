I can still remember  
When we said our wedding vows  
We gave the Lord our hearts and our home  
But lately weve been so busy  
Its changing us somehow  
I wonder if thats why we feel alone  
Chorus  
Lets begin again  
Trust in Him and not our feelings  
Lets leave the loneliness behind  
Take my hand and then  
We can find a new beginning  
Lets begin again  
While theres still time  
Jesus made a promise  
If two of us agree  
The Father up above would hear our prayer  
He is still the healer  
Of hurting families  
And there is hope as long as He is there  
Repeat chorus twice
