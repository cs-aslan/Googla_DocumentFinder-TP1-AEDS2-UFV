Back in the garage with my bullshit detector  
Carbon monoxide making sure its effective  
People ringing up making offers for my life  
But I just want to stay in the garage all night  
  
Were a garage band  
We come from garageland  
  
Meanwhile things are hotting up in the West End alright  
Contracts in the offices groups in the night  
My bummin slummin friends have all got new boots  
An someone just asked me if the group would wear suits  
  
I dont want to hear about what the rich are doing  
I dont want to go to where the rich are going  
They think theyre so clever they think theyre so right  
But the truth is only known by guttersnipes  
  
Theres twentytwo singers But one microphone  
Back in the garage  
Theres five guitar players But one guitar  
Back in the garage  
Complaints Complaints Wot an old bag  
Back in the garage  
All night
