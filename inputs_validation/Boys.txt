Fresh out of school the young girl lose the sound  
Shes gonna go where the young bands hang around  
And its still to right with a voice inside  
Shes screaming dreaming  
And theres no disguise when you look in her eyes shes scheming  
  
Im thinking about the boys  
Shes thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys  
  
There in the dark he starts to touch her hair  
Others go round but right now you dont care  
Well you just dont fight when theyre holding you tight  
That feeling feeling  
Well it looks to good and hes making it so appealing  
  
Im thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys  
  
Still feeling ground as she goes to make the kill  
Watching her move the world is standing still  
cause its still too right with a voice inside  
You screaming dreaming  
And theres no disguise when you look in their eyes shes scheming  
  
Im thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys  
Thinking about the boys
