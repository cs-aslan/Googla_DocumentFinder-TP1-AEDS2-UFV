With the moon and the sun in his eyes  
Hes arriving  
And I dont know what Id do without him  
I got life suddenly  
  
See see me  
Ive got nothing to hide  
See me  
Ive got nothing to hide  
See me  
  
Im leaving my heart in the palm of his hand  
So gently  
I know he knows that I love him  
Though Ive never said is there an easy way  
  
See see me  
Ive got nothing to hide  
See me  
Ive got nothing to hide  
See me  
  
Coming home  
Im coming home  
It feels like Im coming home  
Coming home  
Im coming home  
  
See see me  
Ive got nothing to hide  
See me Ive got nothing to hide  
See see me
