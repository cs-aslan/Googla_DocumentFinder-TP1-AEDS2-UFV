Mexicali Rose stop crying  
Ill come back to you some sunny day  
Every night youll know that Ill be pining  
Every hour a year while Im away  
Dry those big brown eyes and smile dear  
Banish all those tears and please dont sigh  
Kiss me once again and hold me  
Mexicali Rose goodbye  
  
Dry those big brown eyes and smile dear  
Banish all those tears and please dont sigh  
Kiss me once again and hold me  
Mexicali Rose goodbye
