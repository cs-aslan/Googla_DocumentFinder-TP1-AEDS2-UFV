Everybody loves my baby  
But my baby dont love nobody but me  
Nobody but me  
Yes  
Everybody wants my baby  
But my baby dont want nobody but me  
Thats plain to see  
  
Im his sweet Judy  
And he is my loving man  
No time to do his duty  
Loves me like no other can  
  
Everybody loves my baby  
But my baby dont love nobody but me  
Nobody but me  
Everybody wants my baby  
But my baby dont want nobody but me  
Thats plain to see  
  
Now when my baby kisses me  
Upon my rosy cheeks   
I just let those kisses be  
Dont wash my face for weeks  
  
Everybody loves my baby
