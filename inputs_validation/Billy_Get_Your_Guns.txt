I just seen trouble  
Hes calling out your name tonight  
Billy get your guns  
  
You could walk away  
But I know you were born to fight  
So billy get your guns  
  
The bandoleers are strung out  
In the promenade  
Billy get your guns  
  
Billy get your guns  
Theres trouble blowing like a hurricane  
Billy get your guns  
Thats the price on your head for the  
Price of fame  
And itll never change  
Billy get your guns  
  
Theres a whiskey bottle empty  
Sittin on the bar  
Billy get your guns  
And some organ grinder singing  
About some sucker moving on  
Billy get your guns  
  
All the whores are hanging out  
Waiting to get paid  
Billy get your guns  
From some johnny on the spot  
Who said hey keep the change baby  
  
Billy get your guns  
Theres trouble blowing like a hurricane  
Billy get your guns  
Thats the price on your head for the  
Price of fame  
And itll never change  
  
They christened you with whiskey  
And theres fire running through your veins  
Well youre an outlaw just the same  
And every night a bullet wears your name  
  
Ive seen hangman dancing  
Beneath the pale moonlight  
Billy get your guns  
And every stranger that you meet  
Thinks its his lucky night  
Billy get your guns  
  
I dont envy you billy  
But I want to say  
You better get your guns  
cause every outlaw thats died  
Will live to ride again  
Billy get your guns  
  
Billy get your guns  
Theres trouble blowing like a hurricane  
Billy get your guns  
Thats the price on your head for the  
Price of fame  
And itll never change  
Billy get your guns
