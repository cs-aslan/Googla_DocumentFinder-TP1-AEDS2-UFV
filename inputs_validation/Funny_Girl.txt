Funny  
Did you hear that  
Funny  
Yeah the guy said  
  
Honey youre a funny girl  
Thats me  
I just keep them in stitches  
Doubled in half  
  
And though I may be all wrong for a guy  
Im good for a laugh  
I guess its not funny  
Life is far from sunny  
  
When the laugh is over  
And the jokes on you  
A girl ought a have a sense of humor  
Thats one thing you really need for sure  
  
When youre a funny girl  
The fella said A funny girl  
Funny  
How it aint so funny  
Funny girl
