I want to crawl back inside my mothers womb  
I want to shut out all the lights in this room  
I want to start fresh like a baby in a sink  
Scrub away all these thoughts that I think of you  
  
So life moves slowly when youre waiting for it to boil  
Feel like I watch from six feet under the soil  
Still want to hold you and kiss behind your ears  
But I recount the countless tears that I lost for you  
  
But before you finally go theres one thing you should know that I promise  
  
Chorus  
Starting now Ill never know your name  
Starting now Ill never feel the same  
Starting now I wish you never came into my world  
  
I want to crawl back inside my bed of sin  
I want to burn the sheets that smell like your skin  
Instead Ill wash them just like kitchen rags with stains  
Spinning away every piece that remains of you  
  
But before you finally go theres one thing you should know that I promise  
  
Chorus  
Starting now Ill never know your name  
Starting now Ill never feel the same  
Starting now I wish you never came into my world  
  
Its my world its not ours anymore  
Its my world its not ours anymore  
  
Chorus  
Starting now Ill never know your name  
Starting now Ill never feel the same  
Starting now I wish you never came into my world
