Youve got an invalid haircut  
It hurts when you smile  
Youd better get out of town  
Before your nickname expires  
Its the kingdom of the spiders  
Its the empire of the ants  
You need a permit to walk around downtown  
You need a license to dance  
Lifell kill ya  
Thats what I said  
Lifell kill ya  
Then youll be dead  
Lifell find ya  
Wherever you go  
Requiescat in pace  
Thats all she wrote  
From the President of the United States  
To the lowliest rock and roll star  
The doctor is in and hell see you now  
He dont care who you are  
Some get the awful awful diseases  
Some get the knife some get the gun  
Some get to die in their sleep  
At the age of a hundred and one  
Lifell kill ya  
Thats what I said  
Lifell kill ya  
Then youll be dead  
Lifell find ya  
Wherever you go  
Requiescat in pace  
Thats all she wrote  
Maybe youll go to heaven  
See Uncle Al and Uncle Lou  
Maybe youll be reincarnated  
Maybe that stuffs true  
If you were good  
Maybe youll come back as someone nice  
And if you were bad  
Maybe youll have to pay the price  
Lifell kill ya  
Thats what I said  
Lifell kill ya  
Then youll be dead  
Lifell find ya  
Wherever you go  
Requiescat in pace  
Thats all she wrote
