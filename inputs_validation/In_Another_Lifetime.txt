I could hold on for a hundred years  
When all else is gone  
I would still be here  
In a memory of things yet unseen  
Id remember all that weve never been  
And I cannot wait to see  
What life has in store for me  
chorus  
In another lifetime  
It would be forever  
In another world  
Where you and I  
Could be together  
In another set of chances  
Id take the ones Id missed  
And make you mine  
If only for a time  
My life would matter  
In another life  
And Id stay as strong and Id stay as true  
And youd have forever now to think it through  
Coz I believe what wasnt meant to be  
Wasnt meant for now and  
Someday youll see  
In a place and time we never know  
Id be standing there waiting for you  
Repeat Chorus  
Bridge  
You would be mine  
But until that time is now  
Id be holding on somehow  
Repeat Chorus  
Coda  
But until that time  
Ill be holding onto forever  
Until another life
