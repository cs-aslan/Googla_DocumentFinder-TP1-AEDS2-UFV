Half a mile outside Buloxi  
Did I come or did I go  
Seven sirens singin to me  
Why I listen I dont know  
I got some smokes I got some coffee  
My head is ready to explode  
Ill be makin my way further down the road  
Im not much for conversation  
And I dont care for playin games  
Ive heard all the hard luck stories  
Man they all turn out the same  
Im the last lonely survivor  
And Im still carryin their load  
Ill be makin my way further down the road  
Ill be makin my way  
I want to get there some day  
Ill be makin my way  
Past the one eyed Jocks layin rail road tracks in my soul  
Ill be makin my way  
I want to get there some day  
Ill be makin my way  
Past the one eyed Jacks layin rail road tacks in my soul  
Sometimes I wake up with a fever  
Then I just have another beer  
Id like to wake up to a new life  
A million miles away from here  
But I got Beam instead me chasin  
And I live by the legends code  
Ill be makin my way further down the road  
Ill be makin my way further down the road
