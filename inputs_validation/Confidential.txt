You dontt need to give me reasons  
I understand  
Somethings are best kept secret  
And youve done all you can  
I want no recompense  
Just as much as you can give of yourself  
If that makes sense  
  
Ill keep it confidential  
Its secret confidential  
It may come as some surprise  
But I can stay secret from prying eyes  
So dont worry Ill keep it confidential  
Between you and me  
  
Go on tell me that you love me  
Show me you dare  
We may not venture out in public  
At least I know you care  
It cant be guaranteed  
Just give me what you can of yourself  
Thats all I need  
  
Ill keep it confidential  
Its secret confidential  
It may come as some surprise  
But I can stay secret from prying eyes  
So dont worry Ill keep it confidential  
Between you and me  
  
No one will know who I am  
I think its possible only to love  
  
You play such silly games  
But if everyone knew about us Id feel no shame
