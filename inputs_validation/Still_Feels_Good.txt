Oooh oooh oooh come on  
Still feels goodohohoh  
  
That old tshirt you wear to bed  
Hangin off your shoulders by a thread  
The one you ripped off me when we first met  
Still feels good  
  
That old familiar song blarin from my car  
We know every note every word by heart  
Puts a smile on your face cause you know its ours  
And it still feels good  
  
Chorus  
Your fingers hooked around my belt loops  
Leanin up against my ride  
Remember the first time I touched you  
It doesnt matter Ive held you a million times  
Oh and it still feels good  
  
We made some plans had some crazy dreams  
And now that weve reached a few you would think  
That it would get old to you and me  
But it still feels good still feels good  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah and it still feels good baby  
Yeah it still feel goodyeah yeah yeah  
Still feels good  
Still feels good baby
