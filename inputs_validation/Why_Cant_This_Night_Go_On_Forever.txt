Lost in twilight the memories  
Precious moments you and me  
Weve been old friends all through the years  
Picture postcards sharing tears  
  
Whats in our hearts theres never time to say  
Need you tonight lover dont fade away  
Ive seen your city lights  
As I walk away  
Why cant this nightgo on forever  
  
Without love we wont survive  
Run together we rule the night  
Tell me secrets oh that make you cry  
Wheres the laughter we gotta try  
  
Whats in our hearts theres never time to say  
Need you tonight lover dont fade away  
Like a photograph  
That time wont erase  
Why cant this nightgo on forever  
Go on forever and everever and ever
