Dont think about it too much too much too much too much  
Theres no need for us to rush it through  
Dont think about it too much too much too much too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Done saying Im done playing  
Last time was on the outro  
Stuck in the house need to get out more  
Ive been stacking up like Im fundraising  
Most people in my position get complacent  
Come places with star girls end up on them front pages  
Im quiet but I just ride with it  
Moment I stop having fun with it Ill be done with it  
Im the only one thats putting shots up  
And like a potluck you need to come with it  
Dont run from it like HTown in the summer time I keep it 100  
Lot of girls in my time there word to Paul Wall not one fronted  
I was birthed there in my first year man I know that place like I come from
it  
Backstage at Warehouse in 09 like Is Bun coming  
Fuck that is any one coming fore I show up there and aint no one there  
These days I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there  
Back rub from my main thing Ive been stressed out  
Talking to her like back then they didnt want me Im blessed now  
Talking to her like this drop bet a million copies get pressed out  
She tell me Take a deep breath youre too worried about being the best out  
  
Dont think about it too much too much too much too much  
Theres no need for us to rush it through  
Dont think about it too much too much too much too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods  
Money got my whole family going backwards  
No dinners no holidays no nothing  
Theres issues at hand that were not discussing  
Look I did not sign up for this  
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list  
And now hes acting like oh well this is life I guess Nah fuck that
shit  
Listen man you can still do what you wanna do you gotta trust that shit  
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign thats when they appear  
Guess since my text message didnt resonate Ill just say it here  
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment telling herself  
That shes too sick to get dressed up and go do shit like thats true shit  
And all my family from the MTown that Ive been round started treating me
like Im him now  
Like we dont know each other we aint grow together we just friends now  
Shit got me feeling pinned down pick the pen up and put the pen down  
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal but weve been down  
  
Dont think about it too much too much too much too much  
Theres no need for us to rush it through  
Dont think about it too much too much too much too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Dont think about it too much too much too much too much  
Theres no need for us to rush it through  
Dont think about it too much too much too much too much
