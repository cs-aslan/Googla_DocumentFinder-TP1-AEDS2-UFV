Never woulda hitch hiked to Birmingham  
If it hadnt been for love  
Never woulda caught the train to Louisian  
If it hadnt been for love  
Never woulda run through the blindin rain  
Without one dollar to my name  
If it hadnt been  
If it hadnt been for love  
  
Never woulda seen the trouble that Im in  
If it hadnt been for love  
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind  
If it hadnt been for love  
Nobody knows it better than me  
I wouldnt be wishing I was free  
If it hadnt been  
If it hadnt been for love  
  
Four cold walls against my will  
At least I know shes lying still  
Four cold walls without paroll  
Lord have mercy on my soul  
  
Never woulda gone to that side of town  
If it hadnt been for love  
Never woulda took a mind to track her down  
If it hadnt been for love  
Never woulda loaded up a forty four  
Put myself behind a jail house door  
If it hadnt been  
If it hadnt been for love  
  
Four cold walls against my will  
At least I know shes lying still  
Four cold walls without parole  
Lord have mercy on my soul  
  
Never woulda hitch hiked to Birmingham  
If it hadnt been for love  
Never woulda caught the train to Louisian  
If it hadnt been for love  
Never woulda loaded up a forty four  
Put myself behind a jail house door  
If it hadnt been  
If it hadnt been for love  
If it hadnt been  
If it hadnt been for love  
If it hadnt been  
If it hadnt been for love
