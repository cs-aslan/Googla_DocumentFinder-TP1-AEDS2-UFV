I am going where Ive never been  
I am going where theres no sin  
There I will join my lord and my friends  
Yes I am going where Ive never been  
  
Dont be crying thoses bitter tears  
Dont be crying cause Im not here  
Ill be happy for the first time in years  
So dont be crying those bitter tears  
  
I have travelled lifes weary highways  
And my last journey is at hand  
I can hear the Angels calling  
And I am going where Ive never been
