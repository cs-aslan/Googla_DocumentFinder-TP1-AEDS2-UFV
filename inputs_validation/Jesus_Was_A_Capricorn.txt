Jesus was a Capricorn  
He ate organic food  
He believed in love and peace  
And never wore no shoes  
  
Long hair beard and sandals  
And a funky bunch of friends  
Reckon wed just nail him up  
If he came down again  
  
Cause everybodys gotta have somebody to look down on  
Who they can feel better than at any time they please  
Someone doin somethin dirty decent folks can frown on  
If you cant find nobody else then help yourself to me  
  
Eggheads cussing rednecks cussing  
Hippies for their hair  
Others laugh at straights who laugh at  
Freaks who laugh at squares  
  
Some folks hate the Whites  
Who hate the Blacks who hate the Klan  
Most of us hate anything that  
We dont understand  
  
Cause everybodys gotta have somebody to look down on  
Who they can feel better than at any time they please  
Someone doin somethin dirty decent folks can frown on  
If you cant find nobody else then help yourself to me
