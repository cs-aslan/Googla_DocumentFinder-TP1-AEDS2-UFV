Daylights dawns you wake up and yawn  Mr Clean  
A piece of toast from the one you love most  and you leave  
You get the bus in the eight oclock rush  
And catch the train in the morning rain  
Mr Clean  Mr Clean  
  
If you see me in the street  look away  
Cause I dont ever want to catch you looking at me  Mr Clean  
Cause I hate you and your wife  
And if I get the chance Ill fuck up your life  
Mr Clean  etc  
Is that seen  
  
Surround yourself with dreams of pretty young  
Girls and anyone you want but  
Please dont forget me or any of my kind  
Cause Ill make you think again  
When I stick your face in the grind  
  
Getting pissed at the annual office do  
Smart blue suit and you went to Cambridge too  
You miss page three but the Times is right for you  
And mum and dad are very proud of you  
Mr Clean  etc
