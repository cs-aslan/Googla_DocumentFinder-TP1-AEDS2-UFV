Good to see you  
Good to see you again  
Good to see your face again  
Good to see you  
  
Im the suitcase in your hallway  
Im the footsteps on your floor  
When Im lookin down on you  
I feel like I know what my life is for  
  
Good to see you  
Good to see you again  
Good to see your face again  
Good to see you  
  
Ive been down on the endless highway  
I passed on the solid line  
Now at last Im home to you  
I feel like making up for lost time  
  
Good to see you  
Good to see you again  
Good to see your face again  
Its good to see you
