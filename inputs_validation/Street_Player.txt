Id never forget those nameless years  
Street sounds whirling through my mind  
Trouble was often in the air  
So we thought to forget our despair  
  
Cause Im a street player  
And I play you a song Play me a song play me a song  
Cause my heart and soul  
Will carry carry on  
  
City lifes the only way  
Street corners and billiard halls  
Was my home away  
Lessons learned that still help me today  
  
Cause Im a street player  
And Ive seen it all play me a song play me a song  
Hit men and thieves and many a brawl  
But as you will see I still stand tall  
  
It was such a small space and time  
I would never knew that I would find  
A musical past for all to see exciety to ecstasy  
  
I am a streetplayer  
I am a streetplayer  
I am a streetplayer  
  
Cause Im a street player  
And Ive seen it all play me a song play me a song  
  
But as you can see I still stand tall  
  
It was such a small space and time  
I would never knew that I would find  
A musical past for all to see exciety to ecstasy  
  
I am a streetplayer  
I am a streetplayer  
I am a streetplayer  
  
Cause Im a street player  
And Ive seen it all Play me a song play me a song  
The people love your soul  
Dont let them down  
Play your guitar  
Play that funky music child
