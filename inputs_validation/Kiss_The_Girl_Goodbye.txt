Kiss the girl goodbye  
Its time for me to fly  
Wipe the tears away  
Ill be home some day baby  
So baby please wait for me  
Dont want no one to take my place  
Youre the one for me  
And thats the way love should be  
  
Weve been apart so many times before  
One more time wont change things  
Ill even love you more
