Last night I had a dream dreamt I had it all I had it all  
I had one truck one car  
One boat one guitar  
But all these things wouldnt get me too far  
If I didnt have one of you  
  
I work hard every day to bring home all my pay  
I got one house one yard  
One dog who likes to bark  
Wed be cold living the dark if I didnt have one of you  
  
One of you is all I want and all Ill ever need  
One of you is all it takes to make my life complete  
  
Chorus  
This is what I have you have it all  
I got one heart one love  
One dream Im dreaming of  
Wouldnt have known what to give it all to  
If I didnt have one of you  
  
One of you is all I want and all Ill ever need  
One of you is all it takes to make my life complete  
  
Chorus
