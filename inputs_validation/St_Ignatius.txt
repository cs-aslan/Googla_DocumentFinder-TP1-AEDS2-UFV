Outside St Ignatius outside of the law  
You walk by so gracefully I just stand in awe  
Youre a goddess youre the hottest oddity Ive found  
We can go swimmin in our skin and hope that we dont drown  
I could save the water just by drinking it tonight  
I cant find the words to make it right to make it right  
I cant find the words to make it right to make it right  
Tanked up out on Elm Street looking for a ride  
Stretched out on concrete running out of pride  
You need help dear and Im sincere let me be the one  
Im not a big star but Ive got a big car youre too weak to run  
You could save the highway if youd crash with me tonight  
I cant find the words to make it right to make it right  
I cant find the words to make it right to make it right  
I could save the water just by drinking it tonight  
I cant find the words to make it right to make it right  
I cant find the words to make it right to make it right  
Someday when were older deep in loneliness  
Things we said today wont matter no one could care less  
Were just shadows just ask Plato it was all a dream  
Ive had it with Dallas lets burn down the Palace Ill bring the kerosene  
I could save this song if Id just sing real loud tonight  
I cant find the words to make it right to make it right  
I cant find the words to make it right to make it right  
I cant find the words to make it right to make it right
