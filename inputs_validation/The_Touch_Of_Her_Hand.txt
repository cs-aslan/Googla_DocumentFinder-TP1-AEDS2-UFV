Here goes another day  
Im rollin more miles away  
And I would give anything  
To see her tonight  
  
Two more weeks of this endless road  
Another loneliness overload  
Ah but Id wait a hundred years  
For a glimpse of her smile  
And the touch of her hand  
  
The touch of her hand lyin soft in mine  
I feel as tall as the mountains and Im  
Anything I could hope to be  
With the touch of her hand  
  
Halfkept promises  
And dreamers hopes  
Love by phone  
And miss you notes  
And I meant to give so much more  
Well so much for plans  
  
But if she thinks that Ive let her down  
Chasin fools gold from town to town  
You would never know by the love in her eyes  
Or the laugh in her voice  
Or the touch of her hand  
  
The touch of her hand lyin soft in mine  
I feel as tall as the mountains and Im  
Anything I could hope to be  
With the touch of her hand  
  
The touch of her hand lyin soft in mine  
I feel as tall as the mountains and Im  
Anything I could hope to be  
With the touch of her hand  
  
The touch of her hand lyin soft in mine  
I feel as tall as the mountains and Im  
Anything I could hope to be  
With the touch of her hand  
  
The touch of her hand lyin soft in mine  
I feel as tall as the mountains and Im  
Anything I could hope to be
