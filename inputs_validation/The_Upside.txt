Whiteboy gettin ready to do his thing  
UhUhUhUhUhUh  
Heres a new jam for you to cling to  
A funky rhythm that you can swing to  
  
Kid Rock thats me  
And the party jumpin is what Im for seeing  
So just chill or Ill boot you  
Get on me and Ill shoot you  
  
Im fresh to that theres no guessin  
Rock the mic without any fessin  
With your blessin  
I will get stupid you didnt know it  
  
I thought you knew it  
Im the kid that comes exactin  
With my ace the black man  
Two bboys from the Midwest  
  
Rock the shows Cause were professionals  
On the set night and day while the girls say  
  
The Upside Down  
Cant you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
The Upside Down  
Cant you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
  
The bass drops and works its hardest  
For Kid Rock the new young rap artist  
Clockin paper cause I got soul  
Comin at you from the Motor capital  
  
Shakin booties  
Not all the cuties  
Im too cool to be a little fruity  
Drinkin forties every weekend  
  
Im the master whos always speakin  
To some freak and if I freak her  
Its at Red Roof Inn where we sleep cheaper  
But off that topic got to get it  
  
Super dope extremely poetic  
The KIDareOseeKin  
I love girls thats how its layin  
With these jammies  
  
Fuck the grammies  
All I care about is shaking fannies  
And I have been doin it for a long time  
But now Im nineteen  
  
And in my prime  
Waxin booties everyday while the girls say  
  
The Upside Down  
Cant you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
The Upside Down  
Cant you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
  
On the mico is solo  
cause Im the Kid with all the dope lingos  
Only rappin cause I dont sing dope  
Create a jam thats fresh in your bingo  
  
Lace up the Reebox  
Comb the high top  
Black dose with a little hip hop  
And I style it with some uniqueness  
  
You say Im not fresh  
But I could careless  
When I rock the mic  
Im your girl is likin  
  
 women are not lookin  
Create a beat that is fully hookin  
Cause when I get dumb  
People ave fun  
  
 sisco hand me the magnum  
In a hell of a show I always display  
While the girls say  
The Upside Down  
  
Cant you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
The Upside Down  
Cant you turn me inside out  
And round and round
