Theres a flame in the back of my mind  
And its burning for you all the time  
Cause I just want to touch you  
Do you want to touch me too  
  
Now I know that youve heard this before  
But with me it could mean something more  
And I just want to touch you  
Do you want to touch me too  
  
Everybody says were too young  
But I know all the things that they just cant see  
I just want to get inside you  
If youll give just a minute to me ooooh  
  
So Ive said everything that I can  
And Im hoping that youll understand  
That I just want to touch you  
And you want to touch me too
