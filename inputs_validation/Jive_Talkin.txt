Its just your jive talkin telling me lies  
Jive talkin you wear a disguise  
Jive talkin so misunderstood yeh  
Jive talkin youre really no good  
Oh my child youll never know  
Just what you mean to me  
Oh my child you got so much  
You gonna take away my energy  
With all your jive talkin you telling me lies yeh  
Good loving still gets in my eyes  
Nobody believe what you say  
Its just your jive talkin thats gets in the way oh no  
Ta bee rup  
Oh my love youre so good  
Treating me so cruel  
There you go with your fancy lies  
Leaving me looking like a dumb struck fool  
With all your jive talkin you telling me lies yeh  
Jive talkin you wear a disguise  
Jive talkin so misunderstood yeh  
Jive talkin you just aint no good  
You know love talkin is all very fine yeh  
Jive talkin just isnt a crime  
And if theres somebody youll love till you die  
Then all that jive talkin just gets in your eye  
Jive talkin telling me lies yeh  
Good loving still gets in my eyes  
Nobody believe what you say  
Its just your jive talkin that gets in your way
