You the it girl hey hey my inspiration  
My compass spinnin baby its the right destination oh  
Oh come on come on give me what I came for  
I got treasure to hide so lets keep it from the strangers hey  
  
Your waves they wash all over me  
Your tides they pull me back to sea  
When you bite on my lip  
And hold my hand and moan again Ima hold that ass  
When you kiss on my lips  
And hold my hand and moan again Ima hold that ass

Only way you could do that girl to me
