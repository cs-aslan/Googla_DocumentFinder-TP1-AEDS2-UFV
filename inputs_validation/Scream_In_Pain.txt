Its deep insignus  
That knows me well  
Its all around me  
My mind can tell  
  
And all the children  
They know my name  
They scream forever  
I know the pain  
  
Oh feel the pain  
Oh feel the pain  
Oh feel the pain  
Oh feel the pain  
  
Its a sleep insignus  
That knows me well  
Shes got the fever  
Shes hot as hell  
  
And all the children  
They know my name  
When night is coming  
Theyll scream in pain  
  
Oh scream in pain  
Oh scream in pain  
Oh scream in pain  
Oh scream in pain  
  
Yayaya
