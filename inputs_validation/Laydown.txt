BOLLOCKS  
It aint the way that you look at me  
No nor the way you talk  
Could be a dark side coming out of me  
  
But I just like that way that you walk  
And I know what youve got is a thing for me  
And I want that thing awful bad  
Dont mess around  
  
This is too intense  
Im getting hot on the spot  
Tell me just to laydown  
And stay down  
  
For my love  
Laydown  
And stay down  
For my love  
  
Yeah  
Laydown  
Could be the way that youre smiling  
But I dont think so  
  
Could be the jukebox  
But I dont think so  
Could be the way the stars are out tonight  
Were living in some afterglow  
  
Come on come on  
Come on alright  
What youve got is what I need tonight  
Feelin good  
  
I feel alright  
Come on girl  
Dont take all night  
Gonna laydown  
  
And stay down  
For my love  
Laydown and stay down  
For my love  
  
This could be the rainbow bridge  
Crossing over to ShangriLa  
The midnight sky above our heads  
You can be who you are  
  
Tell me to laydown  
Stay down  
For my love  
Laydown  
  
And stay down  
For my love  
Laydown  
Come on why dont you  
  
Laydown  
Come on come on come on  
Laydown  
Come on why dont you just  
  
Laydown tonight  
Laydown  
Come on  
Laydown  
  
Yeah  
Laydown
