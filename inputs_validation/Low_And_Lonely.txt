Low and lonely sad and blue  
Thinking only of little you  
Always trying to keep from crying  
Im low and lonely over you  
  
Do you miss me Say you do  
Tell me darlin tell me true  
Do you yearn dear will you return dear  
Im low and lonely over you  
  
Low and lonely weary too  
Youre the only true love I knew  
Dont be long dear you know its wrong dear  
Im low and lonely over you  
  
Low and lonely sad and blue  
Thinking only of little you  
Always trying to keep from crying  
Im low and lonely over you
