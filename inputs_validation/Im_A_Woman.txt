I am a species born to die  
Understanding this i hardly cry  
Growin up and out ill marry you  
Ill bear your kids and be your mama too cause  
  
Chorus  
Cause im a woman and im a backbone  
Im a woman and im a backbone  
  
Everybody needs one  
  
Goin on i live from day to day  
Give a little heart for my life to pay  
Smile and then i need to cry  
Never knowin if i lie or die  
  
Chorus  
  
Understand you will not see me down  
Both of my feet are on the ground  
Come lay your head upon my chest  
Ill love you hard ill give my best
