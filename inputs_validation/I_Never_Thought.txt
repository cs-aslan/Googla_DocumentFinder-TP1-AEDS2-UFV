Standing with your boys on the corner  
  
I see them look at me walking by  
  
But they dont understand how Im feeling  
  
cause boy you are the apple of my eye  
  
1 I never thought no never  
  
That Id find someone to love me like you do  
  
I never thought in a million years  
  
That you would make every one of my dreams come true  
  
Baby there aint no need for you to worry  
  
cause you can turn your back on me  
  
You know that Ill still be waitin  
  
Right under the sycamore tree  
  
2  Youre all I see youre all I see  
  
I wont let nobody ever come between you and me  
  
See youre all I see  
  
Every time they step to me  
  
I dont pay them any mind  
  
Its all about you and me  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Repeat 2  
  
As clear as the sea  
  
Blow around tropical breeze  
  
I see only we seven seas seven stars  
  
Cooling at the park down in Nassau  
  
Just think you and me love  
  
Say its all move your lips slow  
  
come close to my ear  
  
Its here my dear where your fears come clear  
  
Theres little time left to escape and make best  
  
All I see is three to complete  
  
Making sweet sugar honey all I see  
  
All we need the true life is when we can just be  
  
I never thought in a million years  
  
That you would make every one of my dreams come true  
  
Repeat 1 until fade
