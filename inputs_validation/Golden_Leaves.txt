Do you remember how this first begun  
Teeth were white and our skin was young  
Eyes as bright as the Spanish Sun  
We had nothing we could hide  
  
Now my dear we are two golden leaves  
Clinging desperately to winter trees  
Got up here like a pair of thieves  
While the sirens blare outside  
  
Whats left to say when every words been spoken  
Whats left to see when our eyes wont open  
Whats left to do when weve lost all hope and  
Whats left to break when our hearts are broken  
  
But sometimes  
  
Do you remember how this started out  
So full of hope and now were filled with doubt  
A dirty joke we used to laugh about  
But its not funny anymore  
  
I fear I choke unless I spit it out  
Still smell of smoke although the fires gone out  
Cant live with you but I die without  
  
Whats left to say when every words been spoken  
Whats left to see when our eyes wont open  
Whats left to do when weve lost all hope and  
Whats left to break when our hearts are broken  
  
But sometimes  
  
Whats left to say when every words been spoken  
Whats left to see when our eyes wont open  
Whats left to do when weve lost all hope and  
Whats left to break when our hearts are broken  
  
But sometimes
