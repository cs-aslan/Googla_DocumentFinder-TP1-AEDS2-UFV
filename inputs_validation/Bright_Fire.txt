Dont let waters of caution remove you  
Dont let the fire of saints compel you  
Dont let the lack of their spirit blind your life  
Cause soon its all over youre gonna come through alive  
Well Ive been all over the world five times or more  
And Ive seen the future burn blue before my eyes  
And all through the dust and the green magnesium fire  
Dont let the violence blind you youre gonna come through alive  
And the roses that are offing  
They are real as evening wind  
They are washed by love and suffering  
Cause my love has colored them  
Colored them  
Oooooh oooohhnothing but roses  
Dont dam the river thats running through you  
Stop saving up for time that may never become  
Ive seen the future come true in twenty days  
But dont let is scare you stop thinking about yesterday  
Ive had my share of blue revelations  
And I know that time is a region to be passed  
So all through the dust and green magnesium fire  
I can rest easy now and watch the carnival rolling by  
Cause a rose that will be growing  
In the place where I have hidden  
It is washed by love and suffering  
That my love has colored in  
Look where the roses grow  
Look where the roses grow  
Look where the rooooooooses  
Iiiiiieeeeeeiiiiiiaaaaahhhh  
Look where the roses grow  
Look where the roses grow  
Look where the rooooooooses  
Iiiiiieeeeeeiiiiiiaaaaahhhh  
Look where the roses grow  
Look where the roses grow  
Look where the rooooooooses  
Iiiiiieeeeeeiiiiiiaaaaahhhh  
Look where the roses grow  
Look where the roses grow  
Look where the rooooooooses  
Iiiiiieeeeeeiiiiiiaaaaahhhh
