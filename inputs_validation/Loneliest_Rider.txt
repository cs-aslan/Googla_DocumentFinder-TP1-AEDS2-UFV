A long long time ago there lived an indian boy  
When he came upon this earth he brought his family joy  
A paranoid young brave was he inside his frame was some misery  
He heard the other warriors talking angrily bout the white man taking over
his country  
  
Chorus  
What he didnt know is that some day his ma would be crying  
What he didnt know is that some day his tribe would be dying  
What he didnt know is that some day his fatherd be gone  
What he didnt know is that some day hed be all alone  
  
None of the stories in the schoolbooks said it the truth is gone and theyre
tryin to forget it  
The history books are all onesided the truth is gone and their trying to
hide it  
Who had the land till we came around the indian made his life from the
ground  
And what about the boy that this storys about where his teepee once stood
there now is a town  
  
Chorus  
  
He was the loneliest rider on the plain  
He was the loneliest rider on the plain  
He was the loneliest rider on the plain
