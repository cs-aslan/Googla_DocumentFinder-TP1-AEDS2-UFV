Just another day in the week  
Waiting for an opportunity to step in front of me  
Maybe Im losing my mind  
Searching for another place in another time  
Real love cant be bought  
It is wild and it cant be cought  
Real love cant be sold  
Its another color than gold  
I need your love I just want to buy it  
I need your love Will you help me find it  
I want your love How can you deny it  
I need your love Youve just gotta try it  
I want you now Something that you gotta know  
I need you now My love for you I want to show  
I want your love Im telling you that I belong  
I need your love You and me just cant go wrong  
Standing on top of the world  
Thinking at the joy you bring when you do that thing to me  
You sure know a lot for a girl  
You can bring the good times back get me on the track  
Real love cant be bought  
It is wild and it cant be cought  
Real love cant be sold  
Its another color than gold  
I need your love I just want to buy it  
I need your love Will you help me find it  
I want your love How can you deny it  
I need your love Youve just gotta try it  
I want you now Something that you gotta know  
I need you now My love for you I want to show  
I want your love Im telling you that I belong  
I need your love You and me just cant go wrong  
I need your love

I need your love I just want to buy it  
I need your love Will you help me find it  
I want your love How can you deny it
