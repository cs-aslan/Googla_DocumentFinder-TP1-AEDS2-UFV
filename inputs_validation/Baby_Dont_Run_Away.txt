Baby dont run away from me  
Baby dont go  
Baby Im always thinking of you  
Baby dont run away from my love  
  
You brought me everything Ive wanted  
Lady dont go  
How could I ever live without you  
Lady dont run away from my love  
  
Way out there where the ocean is still  
A calm reflection in the sea  
Sat alone with the stars and the moon  
You turned round to me  
And love was in your eyes to see  
Thats when it happened to you and me  
  
Baby dont run away from me  
Baby dont go  
Baby Im always thinking of you  
Baby dont run away from my love  
  
Way back then it was easy to see  
A calm reflection in the sea  
Sitting still and without any cares  
You turned out to be  
A lover who was sure of me  
Thats when it happened to you and me  
  
Baby dont run away from me  
Baby dont go  
Baby Im always thinking of you  
Baby dont run away from my love
