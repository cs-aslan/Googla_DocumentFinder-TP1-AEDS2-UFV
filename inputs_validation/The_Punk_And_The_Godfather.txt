You declared you would be three inches taller  
You only became what we made you  
Thought you were chasing a destiny calling  
You only earned what we gave you  
You fell and cried as our people were starving  
Now you know that we blame you  
You tried to walk on the trail we were carving  
Now you know that we framed you  
  
GF  
Im the guy in the sky  
Flying high Flashing eyes  
No surprise I told lies  
Im the punk in the gutter  
Im the new president  
But I grew and I bent  
Dont you know dont it show  
Im the punk with the stutter  
My my my my my mmmm my my my  
  
GGGGGgggg generation  
  
PUNK  
We tried to speak between lines of oration  
You could only repeat what we told you  
Your axe belongs to a dying nation  
They dont know that we own you  
Youre watching movies trying to find the feelers  
You only see what we show you  
Were the slaves of the phony leaders  
Breathe the air we have blown you  
  
GF  
Im the guy etc  
  
I have to be careful not to preach  
I cant pretend that I can teach  
And yet Ive lived your future out  
By pounding stages like a clown  
And on the dance floor broken glass  
The bloody faces slowly pass  
The numbered seats in empty rows  
It all belongs to me you know  
  
PUNK  
You declared etc
