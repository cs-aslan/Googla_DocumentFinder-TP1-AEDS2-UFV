Its the darkest hour youre 22  
The voice of youth the hour of dread  
Its the darkest hour and your voice is new  
Love is lost and lost is love  
  
Your countrys new your friends are new  
Your house and even your eyes are new  
Your maid is new and your accent too  
But your fear is as old as the world  
  
Say goodbye to the thrills of life  
When love was good when love was bad  
Wave goodbye to the life without pain  
Say hello your beautiful girl  
  
Say hello to the greater men  
Tell them your secrets theyre like the grave  
Oh what have you done oh what have you done  
Love is lost lost is love  
  
You know so much its making you cry  
You refuse to talk but you think like mad  
Youve cut out your zone and the things have fold  
  
Oh what have you done oh what have you done  
Oh what have you done oh what have you done
