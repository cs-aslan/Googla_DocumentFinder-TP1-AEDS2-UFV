Dont have to humble yourself to me  
I aint your judge or your king  
Baby you know I aint no Queen of Sheba  
We may not even have our dignity  
This could be just a powerful thing  
Baby we can choose you know we aint no amoeba  
  
Chorus  
Are you ready for the thing called love  
Dont come from me and you  
It comes from up above  
I aint no porcupine  
Take off your kid gloves  
Are you ready for the thing called love  
  
I aint some icon carved out of soap  
Sent here to clean up your reputation  
Baby you know you aint no Prince Charming  
We can live in fear or act out of hope  
For some kind of peaceful situation  
Baby how come the cry of love is so alarming  
  
Chorus  
  
Ugly ducklings dont turn into swans  
And glide off down the lake  
Whether your sunglasses are off or on  
You only see the world you make  
  
Are you ready for the thing called love  
Dont come from me and you  
It comes from up above  
I aint no porcupine  
Take off your kid gloves  
  
Are you ready for it  
Are you ready for the thing called love  
Dont come from me and you  
It comes from up above  
I aint no porcupine  
Take off your kid gloves  
  
Are you ready for it  
Are you ready for love baby  
Oh yeah babe  
Are you ready for love
