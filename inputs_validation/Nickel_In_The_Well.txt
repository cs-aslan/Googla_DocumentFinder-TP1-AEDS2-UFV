Ive got a four leaf clover  
I hung a horseshoe on the wall  
I threw salt over my left shoulder  
Ill try anything at all  
To get lucky with you  
I want you so much  
Until you want me too  
I aint gonna give up  
  
Ill throw another nickel in the well  
Tell myself this time maybe itll help  
To make my dreams come true  
Just in case youre out in your backyard  
Lookin up there too  
With a lot of love and a little luck  
Youll fall like I fell  
Ill just cross my fingers  
And throw another nickel in the well  
  
If I could get Houdini  
To teach me a trick or two  
Then maybe you would see me  
In the way I want you to  
Gonna knock on wood  
It aint been easy  
Ive done everything I could  
To make you need me  
  
Ill throw another nickel in the well  
Tell myself this time maybe itll help  
To make my dreams come true  
Just in case youre out in your backyard  
Lookin up there too  
With a lot of love and a little luck  
Youll fall like I fell  
Ill just cross my fingers  
And throw another nickel in the well  
  
With a lot of love and a little luck  
Youll fall like I fell  
Ill just cross my fingers  
And throw another nickel in the well  
  
Yeah just cross my fingers  
And throw another nickel in the well
