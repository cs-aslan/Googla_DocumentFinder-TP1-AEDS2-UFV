Simplicity it works for me  
It keeps me runnin hard and sharp and true  
I focus on the basic stuff  
And pretty soon Im comin up on you  
So much clutter clouds our way  
Fundamentals win the day  
I break you down size you up  
I see a path and then I bust a move  
Before you know well hit you babe  
I finish and Im on to somethin new  
Complex theories have their place  
I like throwdowns in your face  
Its clear when its really really near  
And its everything you need  
Rise and be worthy of the prize  
Get exactly what you need  
Simplicity in everything  
In every single thing you say and do  
Dont get lost in foggy stuff  
Stay on track and let it come to you  
Keep your focus on your goal  
Use that iron hard control  
Use your power and your speed  
Get exactly what you need
