If you missed the train Im on  
You will know that I am gone  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles  
  
A hundred miles a hundred miles  
A hundred miles a hundred miles  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles  
  
Lord Im one Lord Im two  
Lord Im three Lord Im four  
Lord Im five hundred miles away from home  
  
Away from home away from home  
Away from home away from home  
Lord Im five hundred miles away from home  
  
Instrumental  
  
Not a shirt on my back  
Not a penny to my name  
Lord I cant go back home this ole way  
  
This ole way this ole way  
This ole way this ole way  
Lord I cant go back home this this ole way  
  
If you missed the train Im on  
You will know that I am gone  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles  
  
A hundred miles a hundred miles  
A hundred miles a hundred miles  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
