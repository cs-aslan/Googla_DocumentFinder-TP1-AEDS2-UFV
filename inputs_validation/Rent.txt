You dress me up Im your puppet  
You buy me things I love it  
You bring me food I need it  
You give me love I feed it  
  
And look at the two of us in sympathy  
With everything we see  
I never want anything its easy  
You buy whatever I need  
  
But look at my hopes look at my dreams  
The currency weve spent  
I love you you pay my rent  
I love you you pay my rent  
  
You phone me in the evening on hearsay  
And bought me caviar  
You took me to a restaurant off Broadway  
To tell me who you are  
  
We neverever argue we never calculate  
The currency weve spent  
I love you you pay my rent  
I love you you pay my rent  
I love you you pay my rent  
  
Im your puppet  
I love it  
  
And look at the two of us in sympathy  
And sometimes ecstasy  
Words mean so little and money less  
When youre lying next to me  
  
But look at my hopes look at my dreams  
The currency weve spent  
I love you you pay my rent  
I love you you pay my rent  
I love you you pay my rent  
  
Look at my hopes look at my dreams  
The currency weve spent  
I love you you pay my rent  
I love you you pay my rent  
  
Look at my hopes look at my dreams  
The currency weve spent  
I love you you pay my rent  
I love you you pay my rent  
I love you you pay my rent Its easy its so easy  
You pay my rent Its easy its so easy  
You pay my rent Its easy its so easy  
I love you Its easy its so easy  
Its easy its so easy  
Its easy its so easy  
Its easy its so easy  
Its easy its so easy  
Its easy its so easy  
Its easy its so easy
