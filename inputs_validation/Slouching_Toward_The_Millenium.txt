Its time for truth the barker said and poured his self a beer  
Oh yeah forsooth said Ben the Geek but wholl be left to hear  
Theyve driven off the fools and saints and now theyve stole the show  
Its all a bloody circus mates and clowns are in control  
If thats the truth said Marzipan the Midget from the floor  
I know there wont be no demand for Midgets anymore  
We used to be a novelty by simply being small  
But next to them unholy men now Tiny Tim looks tall  
And its harder to matter at all when its all comin down and its all
comin down  
Youve still got your duty to choose how you live or you die thats just the
way it is  
So many warnings to turn this old rascal around  
We better heed em while we got the freedom to try  
 harmonica   
From the bombin over Baghdad to the burnin down at Waco  
In the television courtroom of our trials we can see  
If yow want to kill your parents or cut off somebodys business  
All you got to do is make them hate the victim and youre free  
Like Manuel Noriega Saddam Hussein David Koresh  
And its harder to matter  
We better heed em while we got the freedom to try
