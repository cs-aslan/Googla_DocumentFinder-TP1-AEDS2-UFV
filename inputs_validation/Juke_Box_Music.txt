Theres a lady plays her favright records  
On the jukebox evry day  
All day long she plays the same old songs  
And she believes the things that they say  
  
Other ladies like to prance around  
And flirt and dance the whole night through  
But she just sits and listens to here juke box records  
Cause thats all that she wants to do  
  
She sings along with all the saddest songs  
And she believes the stories are real  
She lets the music dictate the way that she feels  
  
Its only juke box music  
Only juke box music  
Its only music  
Only juke box music  
Only juke box music  
  
Seems to me shes in a fantasy  
Shes livin in a world of her own  
And we all agree that shes a mystery  
Because shed rather be all alone  
  
Evry guy will do his best to try  
To put that music out of her head  
Forget all the songs  
And just dance to the music instead  
  
Its only juke box music  
Only juke box music  
Its only music  
Only juke box music  
Only juke box music  
  
Its all because of that music  
That were slowly driftin apart  
But its only there to dance to  
So you shouldnt take it to heart  
  
Music only juke box music  
Only music only juke box music  
repeat
