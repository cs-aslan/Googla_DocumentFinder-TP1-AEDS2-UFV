You say things with your mouth  
Cobwebs and flies come out  
I hear a second voice  
Behind your tongue somehow  
  
Luckily I can read your mind  
Cobwebs and flies unwind  
They will not take you down  
They will not cast you out  
  
Dear friend here we are again pretending how you think the world is ending
sending signals and red flags in waves Its hard to tell the difference
between blood and water these days I pray that one day youll see that the
only difference between life and dying is one is trying thats all were
gonna do so try to love me and Ill try to save you  
  
Chorus  
Wont you stay alive  
Ill take you on a ride  
I will make you believe  
You are lovely  
End Chorus2x  
  
Your redemption wont go stale  
We are not just setting sail  
On the seas of what we fear  
Treason now is growing near to me  
  
Im coming clean  
God hit me straight on  
God hit me straight on  
  
Chorus2x  
  
You say things with your mouth  
Cobwebs and flies come out  
I hear a second voice  
Behind your tongue somehow  
  
Lovely I can read your mind  
  
Dont be gone 5x  
  
You say things with your mouth  
Cobwebs and flies come out 7x
