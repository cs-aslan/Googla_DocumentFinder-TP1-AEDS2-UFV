Lavender windows and burgundy doors  
Olive green pillows on ebony floors  
The lightest of wine  
Could have been mine  
It should have been mine  
  
Promises kept and promises broken  
Theyre all the same whether silent or spoken  
Theyre not worth a penny  
I didnt make many  
I didnt break any  
  
Roads that are leaving and roads that have gone  
Oh every road moves but the one that Im on  
The score is now even  
And I should be leaving  
Why am I not leaving
