I know you want to be my bedroom thing  
But youre much too young  
Youre the finest thing Ive ever seen  
You just want to have fun  
  
I need someone who can scratch my back  
I need someone who can carry my pack  
I need someone to be with me at night  
Youre gonna make me feel alright  
  
Dont you bother me with petty lines  
I know you ran away from home  
This might come to you as some surprise  
I wish youd leave me alone  
  
I need someone to scratch my back  
I need someone to carry my pack  
I need someone to be with me at night  
Youre gonna make me feel alright
