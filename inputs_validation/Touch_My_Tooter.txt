Buddy whys my brain so muddy  
Why do I feel like putty when she walks into the room  
Touch my tooter smoocher  
  
Sonny it aint all milk and honey  
And I dont think its funny when she starts to groove  
  
Baby aint it pretty lazy and aint it crazy  
When you think its all smooth  
Touch my tooter smoocher  
  
Buddy whys my brain so muddy  
Why do I feel like putty when she walks into the room  
  
Sonny aint it funny  
And I dont think its funny when she starts to groove  
Touch my tooter smoocher  
  
Take it down for me  
Bring it on  
Touch my tooter smoocher  
Ahhhh  
  
Buddy whys my brain so muddy  
Why do I feel like putty when she walks into the room  
Sonny it aint all milk and honey  
And I dont think its funny when she starts to groove
