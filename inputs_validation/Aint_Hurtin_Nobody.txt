Im a walkin down the street like Lucky Larue  
Got my hand in my pocket Im thinkin bout you  
I aint hurtin nobody  
I aint hurtin no one  
  
Theres three hundred men in the state of Tennessee  
Theyre waiting to die they wont never be free  
I aint hurtin nobody  
I aint hurtin no one  
  
Six million seven hundred thousand and thirtythree lights on  
You think someone could take the time to sit down  
And listen to the words of my song  
  
At the beach in Indiana I was nine years old  
Heard Little Richard singing Tutti Frutti  
From the top of a telephone pole  
I wasnt hurtin nobody  
I wasnt hurtin no one  
  
Theres roosters laying chickens and chickens layin eggs  
Farm machinery eating peoples arms and legs  
I wasnt hurtin nobody  
I wasnt hurtin no one  
  
Perfectly crafted popular hit songs never use the wrong rhyme  
Youd think that waitress could get my order  
Right the first time  
  
Shes sitting on the back steps just shucking that corn  
That gals been grinning since the day she was born  
She aint hurtin nobody  
She aint hurtin no one  
  
I used to live in Chicago where the cold wind blows  
I delivered more junk mail than the junkyard would hold  
I wasnt hurtin nobody  
I wasnt hurtin no one  
  
You can fool some of the people part of the time  
In a rock and roll song  
Fifty million Elvis Presley fans  
Cant be all wrong
