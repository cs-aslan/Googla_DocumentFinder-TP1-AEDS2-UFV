Wheres my pal wheres my friend  
All good things must have an end  
Sad things and nothings  
On and on they go  
I guess he went to Mexico  
  
Chorus  
They all went to Mexico  
Buenas dias got to go  
Tengo que obedecer  
Mi corazon  
They all went to Mexico  
Wheres my mule wheres my dray  
Straw hats packed up and gone  
away  
Mule dont go north and dray go slow  
They both went to Mexico  
Wheres my sweetie wheres the face  
That lit dark corners every place  
She put up with me long time you know  
And then she had to go to Mexico  
  
Chorus  
  
wheres my brown dog wheres my hound  
He liked my truck he hung around  
But hes a canine romeo  
And I guess he went to Mexico  
Wheres that woman so sweet so mean  
Her heart was cautious her mind was keen  
She was always looking for the peccadillo  
I hope she went to Mexico  
  
Chorus  
  
Wheres Decembers happy crew  
With German bikes and sidecars too  
They take the truck south to St Louis MO  
Motorcycle all the way to Mexico  
Wheres my luck wheres my grace  
Has it all been just a foolish chase  
Every time I hear that rainy chill wind blow  
I think it might be time to head to Mexico
