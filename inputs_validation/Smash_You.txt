Hangin out on the avenue  
Lookin for something to do  
Didnt know when we first met  
That you would be such a pest  
Dont go callin on the phone  
I dont need your dial tone  
Youve been treatin me so bad  
Youre the best girl that I ever had so  
Oh oh oh baby  
Dont go dont go honey  
Oh dont you know  
You make me wanna smash you  
Fightin on the avenue  
Id knock some sense into you  
But I know its not enough  
You think youre so damn tough  
All this talk about suicide  
Too many pills too many lies  
Baby youre no good you see  
Run run run get away from me  
Oh oh oh baby  
Dont go dont go honey  
Oh dont you know  
You make me wanna smash you  
Fightin on the avenue  
You make me wanna smash you  
Fightin on the avenue  
You make me wanna smash you oh  
Hangin out on the avenue  
Lookin for somethin to do  
Didnt know when we first met  
That you would be such a pest  
I ripped up all your photographs  
They make me wanna smash your head  
Youve been treatin me so bad  
Youre the best girl that I ever had so  
Oh oh oh baby  
Dont go dont go honey  
Oh dont you know  
You make me wanna smash you  
Oh oh oh baby  
Dont go dont go honey  
Oh dont you know  
You make me wanna smash you  
Smash you
