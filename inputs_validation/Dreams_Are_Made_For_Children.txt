Dim the light little man  
And tonight little man  
On a ship of dreams youll sail  
  
Dreams are made for children  
And a dream is a fairytale  
  
You dont need a magic wand  
To see all that lies beyond  
If you just believe in fairyland  
Fairyland appears  
  
Dream away little man  
Dream as long as you can  
Dont grow up I beg of you  
  
Dreams are made for children  
And for children dreams come true
