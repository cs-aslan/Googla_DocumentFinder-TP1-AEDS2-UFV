Im not surprised  
Not everything lasts  
Ive broken my heart so many times  
I stopped keepin track  
Talk myself in  
I talk myself out  
I get all worked up  
Then I let myself down  
  
I tried so very hard not to lose it  
I came up with a million excuses  
I thought I thought of every possibility  
  
And I know someday that itll all turn out  
Youll make me work so we can work to work it out  
And I promise you kid that Ill give so much more than I get  
I just havent met you yet  
  
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm  
  
I might have to wait  
Ill never give up  
I guess its half timing  
And the other halfs luck  
Wherever you are  
Whenever its right  
You come out of nowhere and into my life  
  
And I know that we can be so amazing  
And baby your love is gonna change me  
And now I can see every possibility  
  
Mmm  
  
But somehow I know that will all turn out  
And youll make me work so we can work to work it out  
And I promise you kid Ill give so much more than I get  
I just havent met you yet  
  
They say alls fair  
In love and war  
But I wont need to fight it  
Well get it right  
And well be united  
  
And I know that we can be so amazing  
And being in your life is gonna change me  
And now I can see every single possibility  
  
Mmm  
  
And someday I know itll all turn out  
And Ill work to work it out  
Promise you kid Ill give more than I get  
Than I get than I get than I get  
  
Oh you know it will all turn out  
And youll make me work so we can work to work it out  
And I promise you kid to give so much more than I get  
Yeah I just havent met you yet  
  
I just havent met you yet  
Oh promise you kid  
To give so much more than I get  
  
I said love love love love love love love  
I just havent met you yet  
Love love love love love love  
I just havent met you yet
