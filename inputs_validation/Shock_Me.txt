Your lightnins all I need  
My satisfaction grows  
You make me feel at ease  
You even make me glow  
Dont cut the power on me  
Im feelin low so get me high  
  
Shock me make me feel better  
Shock me put on your black leather  
Shock me we can come together  
  
And baby if you do what youve been told  
My insulations gone girl you make me overload  
  
Dont pull the plug on me no no  
Keep it in and keep me high  
  
Shock me make me feel better  
Shock me put on your black leather  
Shock me we can come together  
Come on  
  
Shock me baby shock me oh yeah  
Shock me baby shock me oh yeah  
  
Shock me make me feel better oh yeah  
Come on and shock me put on your black leather  
Baby Im down to the bare wire  
Shock me we can come together  
Oh yeah I wanna feel your power  
Shock me make me feel better  
Baby Im down to the bare wire  
Shock me put on your black leather  
Baby come on come on shock me
