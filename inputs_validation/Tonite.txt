Now you tell me that the time is right  
Youve let your feeling go  
And you know I wont use them up too fast  
I cant promise you the best there is  
But ooh Im gonna try  
Im never gonna let you go tonite  
  
Tonite the start of a love to remember  
Tonite a love that will never be ended  
Tonite tonite  
  
Let me take you where theres no return  
Where dreams can all come true  
Ive got the feeling weve been holding on too long  
What were feeling is ours alone  
No one will ever know  
Just how we feel about tonite  
  
Tonite the start of a love to remember  
Tonite a love that will never be ended  
Tonite tonite  
  
How many times has love fallen through  
When I left it all up to you  
I took your words when you said  
Its got to be just right  
I need you now I need you now  
  
Tonite the start of a love to remember  
Tonite a love that will never be ended  
Tonite tonite
