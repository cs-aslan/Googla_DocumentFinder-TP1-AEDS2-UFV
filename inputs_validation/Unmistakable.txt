Brian  
Anytime anywhere anyplace  
You could be anyone today  
Maybe I would recognize you On a crowded street  
  
AJ  
Maybe youll take me by surprise  
Will you be the one I had in mind  
  
Chorus emphasis on AJ  
Therell come a day  
When youll walk out of my dreams  
Face to face  
Like Im imagining  
Baby how can I be sure  
That youre the one Im waiting for  
Will you be unmistakable  
  
AJ  
Unmistakable  
  
Nick  
People say were watching our lives  
Through a glass  
Desperately waiting on a chance  
I know youre out there  
Holding on holding out for me  
  
AJ  
How are we to know the time is right  
What if youre here and Im just blind  
  
Repeat Chorus emphasis on Nick  
  
Nick  
How can I know a song I never heard  
How will I know your voice  
When you havent said a word  
  
AJ  
How do I know how this will end  
Before we begin  
  
Nick  
Before we begin
