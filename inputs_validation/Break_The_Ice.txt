Its been a while  
I know I shouldnt have kept you waiting  
But Im here now  
  
I know its been a while  
But Im glad you came  
And Ive been thinking bout  
How you say my name  
Got my body spinning  
Like a hurricane  
And it feels like  
You got me going insane  
And I cant get enough  
So let me get it up  
  
Ooh looks like were alone now  
You aint gotta be scared  
Where you going now  
Im a have to floss on you  
Lets get it blazin  
We can turn the heat up if you wanna  
Turn the lights down low if you wanna  
Just wanna move you  
But youre frozen  
Thats what Im saying  
  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel  
  
So you warming up yet  
  
You got me hypnotized  
I never felt this way  
My hearts beating like an 808  
Can you rise to the occasion  
Im patiently waiting  
Cause its getting late  
And I cant get enough  
So let me get it up  
  
Ooh looks like were alone now  
You aint gotta be scared  
Where you going now  
Im a have to floss on you  
Lets get it blazin  
We can turn the heat up if you wanna  
Turn the lights down low if you wanna  
Just wanna move you  
But youre frozen  
Thats what Im saying  
  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel  
  
I like this part  
Feels kinda good  
Yeah  
  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right  
But you warm up to me  
Baby I can make you feel  
Hot more  
  
Let me break the ice  
Allow me to get you right
