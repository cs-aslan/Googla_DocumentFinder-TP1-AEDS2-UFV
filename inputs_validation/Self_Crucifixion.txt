Im not sleepin the walls are down  
and your hands are icy cold  
under water through che sound of fear  
comes a drowned and cold reply  
and the mist still hangs around the gallows  
like the anger after the violent rain  
  
Chorus  
Die if you will die if you want to  
theres no mistake the ending is clean  
the fire is cold in the ashes of memory  
theres no escape from this hotel  
  
Like a child who lies to win  
then eats of his own flesh  
holy water cant save you now  
youve hungered far too long  
and the words once spoken  
now ring hollow as the mind that  
shatters your flesh with nails  
  
Chorus  
  
Im not sleepin Im alive for you  
you youll try again save yourself  
the dawn takes the night the night takes the sun  
the son takes your sins your sins can be cleansed  
  
Chorus  
  
No escape the ending is clean  
it doesnt have to be this way
