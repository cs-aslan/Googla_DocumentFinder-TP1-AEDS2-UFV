Can you feel me  
Can you feel me  
  
I dont want to open my eyes  
Cause if I do Ill have to leave you and I dont understand why  
my heart wont do what i tell it to  
  
Wash over me with anything but your tears  
Wash over me with anything but my fears  
  
Come on come on  
Can you feel me trying to leave your arms  
Can you hear me begging to stay  
Can you feel me trying to leave your arms  
Can you beg me beg me to stay  
  
I dont want to say goodbye cause if I do  
I may not leave you  
And I dont ever want to cry cause  
Without that I may never breathe you  
  
Wash over me with anything but your tears  
Wash over me with anything but my fears  
  
Come on come on  
Can you feel me trying to leave your arms  
Can you hear me begging to stay  
Can you feel me trying to leave your arms  
Can you beg me beg me to stay  
  
Why dont you warm up these lips  
With your fingertips  
Oh my body just aches at the thought of you saying  
Goodbye  
Oh when you look at me with them gorgeous eyes  
You know that I cant pretend is this the end it feels so right  
So  
  
Can you feel me trying to leave your arms  
Can you hear me begging to stay  
Can you hear me  
Can you feel me trying to leave your arms  
Your arms no  
Can you beg me beg me to stay  
Can you feel me  
Can you feel me  
Can you feel me  
Can you feel me  
  
Beg me to stay  
Can you feel me  
Can you beg me to stay stay stay  
I dont want to open my eyes cause if  
I do I may not leave you  
I dont want to open my eyes cause if  
I do I may not leave you
