We are the Roundheads we dont want kings no more  
Thats why we started the English civil war  
People say were no fun but we disagree  
Especially when explaining parliamentary democracy  
We are particularly excited by the notions of jurisprudence  
  
Thats enough dullness were the Cavalier crew  
Supporting King Charles and everything that hell do  
Puritans bore us its really a crime  
When your parliamentary business cuts our partying time  
  
Roundheads soundheads keep the music down heads  
Rules and regulations led dull but fair  
Cavaliers three cheers wackier head gears  
We live to boogie with our peers Unfair Dont care  
  
I am the king I can do what I like  
Start up a war or a big tax hike  
Got a French wife shes a catholic  
  
O law  
Really King Charles were not quite sure  
  
Insolence Is that how you talk to the Crown  
I am the King Ill just close Parliament down  
  
Ill think you find thats in breach of due process  
Heres what we say to that spit Now clear up this mess  
  
Roundheads soundheads witches should be drowned heads  
Dont believe in crowned heads Parliaments our thing  
Cavaliers three cheers your superiors  
Were all toffs who cry Here Here and God Save The King  
Thats me  
  
Fight Fight Fight Fight Fight Fight Fight Fight  
  
Cavaliers Roundheads The English Civil War  
Why is it called civil May I kill you please Sure  
  
Love civil wars to be fought on this land  
If I get to power Christmas will be banned  
  
No chance Cromwell victory will be mine  
Youll never pass a ban on mince pies and mulled wine  
  
Thats what you think just wait til youre caught  
Ill also scrap theatre music and sport  
Your pathetic war will finish even before its begun  
Weve taken Charles prisoner the Roundheads have won  
  
Oh  
  
Victory three cheers Cavaliers in tears  
No power for years Im the leader of the pack  
Charles head Roundhead hurrah now the kings dead  
Sins binned instead a righteous track  
But well be back
