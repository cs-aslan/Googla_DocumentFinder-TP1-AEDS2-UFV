Dont ask me  
What you know is true  
Dont have to tell you  
I love your precious heart  
  
I  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never tear us apart  
  
We could live  
For a thousand years  
But if I hurt you  
Id make wine from your tears  
  
I told you  
That we could fly  
Cause we all have wings  
But some of us dont know why  
  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never ever tear us apart  
  
I  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never tear us apart  
  
You were standing  
I was there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never tear us apart  
  
I  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided
