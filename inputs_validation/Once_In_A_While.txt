Once in a while I see you  
Once in a while I dont  
And when I when I see you  
I feel like flying over  
Flying over the clouds oh yeah  
  
Oh I want to do something for you  
I could fix your broken shoe  
I dont want to hide  
Oh I want to help you find the clue  
So that we save our own few  
I dont want to hide  
  
I wanted to buy you some flowers  
I went downtown the shops were closed  
But when I saw you smilin  
I felt like flying over  
Flying over the clouds Oh yeah  
Oh I want to do something for you  
Just tell me what to do  
I dont want to hide  
But I know that youll be leaving soon  
But I never will forget you  
I dont want to hide  
  
Why will it take so long  
Until I can see you again Repeat x 2  
And you know  
Its just a dream Oh yeah Repeat x 2  
  
Oh I want to do something for you  
Why will it take so long  
Eh yeah
