All the towers of ivory are crumbling  
And the swallows have sharpened their beaks  
This is the time of our great undoing  
This is the time that Ill come running  
  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
One more time  
  
The light in our window is fading  
The candle gutters on the ledge  
Well now sorrow it comes astealing  
And Ill cry girl but Ill come arunning  
  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
Once again  
  
And gone are the days of rainbows  
And gone are the nights of swinging from the stars  
For the sea will swallow up the mountains  
And the sky will throw thunderbolts and sparks  
  
Straight at you  
But Ill come arunning  
Straight to you  
But Ill come arunning  
One more time  
  
Heaven has denied us its kingdom  
The saints are drunk and howling at the moon  
The chariots of angels are colliding  
Well Ill run babe Ill come running  
  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
One more time
