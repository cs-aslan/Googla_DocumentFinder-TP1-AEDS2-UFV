I was born in the wagon of a travelin show  
My mama used to dance for the money theyd throw  
Papa would do whatever he could  
Preach a little gospel  
Sell a couple bottles of doctor good  
  
Chorus  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
Wed hear it from the people of the town  
Theyd call us gypsies tramps and thieves  
But every night all the men would come around  
And lay their money down  
  
Picked up a boy just south of Mobile  
Gave him a ride filled him with a hot meal  
I was sixteen he was twentyone  
Rode with us to Memphis  
And papa wouldve shot him if he knew what hed done  
  
Chorus  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
Wed hear it from the people of the town  
Theyd call us gypsies tramps and thieves  
But every night all the men would come around  
And lay their money down  
  
Never had schoolin but he taught me well  
With his smooth southern style  
Three months later Im a gal in trouble  
And I havent seen him for a while oh  
I havent seen him for a while oh  
  
She was born in the wagon of a travelin show  
Her mama had to dance for the money theyd throw  
Grandpad do whatever he could  
Preach a little gospel  
Sell a couple bottles of doctor good  
  
Chorus  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
Wed hear it from the people of the town  
Theyd call us gypsies tramps and thieves  
But every night all the men would come around  
And lay their money down
