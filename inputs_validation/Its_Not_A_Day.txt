Verse 1 Gucci Mane  
She so fine itll make you cry  
Make you smile even make you lie  
Make me cum and I dont know why  
Got me acting dumb and I dont know why  
Some say Im sprung and Im young  
And Im dumb full of cum  
Im a fiend you the drug

Baby so fly   
Baby drive  
Im too drunk to drive  
Sliding down Ocean Drive  
Driving a Lambo like New Jersey   
Theres two freaks inside  
Pull up in a  suicide  
I propose a toast  
Got a bitch so bad I wanna boast  
Bae lets get sum to smoke  
Everywhere I go my youngin wanna go

Girl you dope as cancer smoke  
And I think Im a overdose
