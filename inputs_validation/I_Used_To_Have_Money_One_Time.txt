I had Cadillacs in my future  
Debutantes in my past  
I made a deal with the devil for a whole lot of money  
Thinkin it would last and last  
But a fool and his money are bound to part  
And what goes up must come down  
So take my advice dont trust the roll of the dice  
Keep your feet on solid ground  
  
I used to have money one time  
Life of adventure and crime  
I used to have money one time  
Lots of women and wine  
But whos gonna tell a fool Whos gonna tell a fool  
Whos gonna tell a fool That he aint cool  
  
Now thems were hard times back in the eighties bous  
People barely had enough to get by  
But oh not me foot loose and fancy free  
There was nothing to myself Id deny  
So fellas listen to my story now  
Though you have heard this tale befo  
Take care of your needs and watch out for your greeds  
Or that wolf will be at your door  
  
I used to have money one time  
Life of adventure and crime  
I used to have money one time  
Now I aint got a dime  
But whos gonna be the fool Whos gonna be the fool  
Whos gonna be the fool It still aint cool  
  
Whos gonna tell a fool Whos gonna tell a fool  
Whos gonna tell a fool It still aint cool
