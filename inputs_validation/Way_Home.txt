If you dont stop lying on the floor  
You dont know what your dying for  
The last thing that you need is imbeciles and indecision  
The discussion nearly ends  
She says Im leaving my friend  
And I dont wanna see you when Im walking on my way home  
It is always on my way home  
Maria quietly talks to me  
She says Adam what do you see  
The people lying in the  hours of imperception  
And I believe I  the ground  
She says Hey what have you found  
And everything I see is only walking on my way home  
chorus  
Look at all the silly people out there  
Cant you see  
Oh all the silly people lying crying dying  
Believe me and this is what I see  
And if you dont amuse me  
We walk in circles and we walk back between indecision  
Between the currents we will swim  
And then its over my friend  
And everything I see is only walking on my way home  
Look at all the silly people out there  
Cant you see  
Oh all the silly people lying crying ddddying  
Maria she belongs to me in between the garden and the sea  
I walk in circles and the women walks right here beside me  
And if we talk about this town  
I must say Ive been feeling down  
And Ive been sliding all the falls  
Ive seen currents on my way home  
Chorus
