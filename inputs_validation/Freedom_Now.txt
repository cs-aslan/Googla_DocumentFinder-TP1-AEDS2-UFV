They throwed him in jail  
And they kept him there  
Hoping so hed die  
That his body and spirit would waste away  
And soon after that his mind  
  
But every day is born a fool  
One who thinks that he can rule  
One who says tomorrows mine  
One who wakes one day to find  
  
The prison doors open the shackles broken  
And chaos in the street  
Everybody sing were free free free free  
Everybody sing were free free free free  
Everybody sing were free free free free  
  
They throwed him in jail  
And they kept him there  
Hoping his memoryd die  
That the people forget how he once led  
And fought for justice in their lives  
  
But every day is born a man  
Who hates what he cant understand  
Who thinks the answer is to kill  
Who thinks his actions are gods will  
  
And he thinks hes free free free free  
Yes he thinks hes free free free free  
He thinks hes free free free free  
  
Soon must come the day  
When the righteous have their way  
Unjustly tried are free  
And people live in peace I say  
Give the man release  
Go on and set your conscience free  
Right the wrongs you made  
Even a fool can have his day  
  
Let us all be free free free free  
Let us all be free free free free  
Let us all be free free free free  
  
Free our bodies free our minds  
Free our hearts  
Freedom for everyone  
And freedom now  
Freedom now  
Freedom now  
Freedom now  
  
Let us all be free free free free  
Let us all be free free free free  
Let us all be free free free free
