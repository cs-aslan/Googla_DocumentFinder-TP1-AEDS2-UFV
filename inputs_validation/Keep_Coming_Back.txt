You know just how to hurt me  
And how to take all the pain away  
Girl you must be the devil in disguise  
There were times I think you knew  
When I was so afraid of you  
Theres some kind of madness in your eyes  
  
You know a place buried deep in my heart  
Nobody else can see  
Something in you has taken some kind of hold on me  
  
I dont know why I keep coming back to you baby  
I dont know why I keep coming back to you  
To you baby  
  
You say we shouldnt be lovers  
And I say we cant just be friends  
And all this talking just makes me want you more  
  
Youve got a way of confusing a heart  
That nobody else could do  
Why should I try I dont want to get over you  
  
I dont know why I keep coming back to you baby  
Just tell me why I keep coming back to you  
I dont know why I keep coming back to you my baby  
Tell me why I keep coming back to you  
  
Im so in love so in love with the games that you play  
So in love and nothing can keep me away  
  
Youve got a way of confusing a heart  
That nobody else could do  
Why should I try I dont want to get over you  
  
I dont know why I keep coming back to you baby  
Just tell me why I keep coming back to you  
I dont know why I keep coming back to you baby  
Tell me why I keep coming back to you  
I dont know why I keep coming back to you baby  
Tell me why I keep coming back to you  
I dont know why I keep coming back to you baby  
Just tell me why I keep coming back to you
