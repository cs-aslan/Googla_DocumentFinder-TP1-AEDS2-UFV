I watch the days rush by me like a river  
I shouldnt wait but Im scared to touch the water  
I let the phone ring why wont you believe me believe me  
I wait for silence takes a lot not to answer  
  
All I have to say is  
You dont deserve me you dont deserve me  
Im finally walking away  
Cause you dont deserve me and youre not worthy  
  
Chorus  
And I wont let you pull me in  
Because I know youre gonna win  
The war is over but the war is over the war is over  
And I wont fight you anymore  
Ive never been so sure  
The war is over cause the war is over  
  
I used to let you paint a pretty picture  
You got me caught up with your youre my girl forever  
So I forgive you it felt good when youd hold me  
Yeah you owned me  
Now you wish you had really known me  
  
All I have to say is you dont deserve me you dont deserve me  
Im finally walking away cause youll only hurt me  
And youre not worthy  
  
Chorus  
  
This is not my surrender  
Im not running for cover  
Im right here I know you see me  
But your words no longer defeat me  
In the night when youre lonely  
You remember how much you miss me  
So you call but I swear  
You can try a million times youll get the same answer  
  
All I have to say is you dont deserve me you dont deserve me  
Im finally walking away cause youll only hurt me  
And youre not worthy  
  
And I wont let you pull me in  
Because I know youre gonna win  
The war is over but the war is over The war is over  
  
Repeat x7  
The war is over
