Ive got a question for you  
Please grant me an interview  
Dont want to read it in a magazine  
Dont want to see it on the silver screen  
Dont let the craziness tear us apart  
  
Im down on the knees of my heart  
Down here on the knees of my heart  
  
This comes from deep in my soul  
Your sweet love has taken control  
Ill swim across the ocean if you tell me so  
Ill take you to the jump up if you want to go  
It never is too late to make a brand new start  
  
Im down here on the knees of my heart  
Down here on the knees of my heart  
  
Oh how I will sing if you give me everything  
I live for the day when theres nothing in our way  
  
I will be waiting tonight  
Youll find my boat by the light  
Im gonna show you what my love can do  
Out on the ocean all alone with you  
Well find a desert island on an ancient chart  
  
Take me from the knees of my heart  
Take me from the knees of my heart  
Take me from the knees of my heart  
Take me from the knees of my heart
