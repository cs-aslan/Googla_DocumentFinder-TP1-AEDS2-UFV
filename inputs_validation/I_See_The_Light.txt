I crossed the river  
Fell into the sea  
Where the nonbelievers  
Go beyond belief  
Then I scratched the surface  
In the mouth of hell  
Running out of service  
In the blood I fell  
  
Chorus  
Well I  I just want to see the light  
And I  I dont want to lose my sight  
Well I  I just want to see the light  
And I need to know whats worth the fight  
  
Ive been wasted  
Pills and alcohol  
Ive been chasing  
Down the pool halls  
Then I drank the water  
From a hurricane  
And I set a fire  
Just to see the flame  
  
Chorus  
  
I crossed the desert  
Reaching higher ground  
Then I pound the pavement  
To take the liars down  
But its gone forever  
But never too late  
Where the everafter  
Is in the hands of fate  
  
Chorus
