Just a fraction of your love  
Fills the air  
And I fall in love with you  
All over again woo woo woo  
Youre the light that feeds the sun  
In my world  
Id face a thousand years of pain for my girl  
Out of all the things in life that I could fear  
The only thing that would hurt me  
Is if you werent here whoa  
  
Chorus  
I dont wanna go back to just being one half of the equation  
You understand what Im sayin  
Girl without you Im lost  
Cant face this compass at heart  
Between me and love  
Youre the common denominator  
Oh oh oh oh  
Common denominator  
Oh yeah woa  
  
Before youre love was low  
Playing girls was my high  
We chase the game that would put  
My cot in the side aye  
When broken hearts rise up to say  
Love is a lie  
You and I would stand to be loves reply  
  
Out of all things in life that I could fear yeah  
The only thing that would hurt me is if you werent here whoa  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant imagine life without your touch  
And every kiss that you give can fill me up  
And to all the heart aching  
Jealous females hatin  
Imma hold it down for you you  
You woah oh woah  
Youre the common denominator  
Oh yeah woah  
  
I dont wanna go back  
I dont want to go back  
To just being one half of the equation  
  
Chorus  
  
Just a fraction of your love fills the air  
And I fall in love with you all over again
