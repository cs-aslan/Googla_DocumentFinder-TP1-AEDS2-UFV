You opened my eyes  
You make me believe  
That there is a chance for a guy like me  
You opened my eyes  
To a whole new world for me  
Baby dont you know  
That all I wanted was to be by your side  
To find a way to the light through the dark  
You saw the man that I was deep inside ah huh  
Theres a voice  
That was screamin inside of my head  
But I was quiet and peaceful instead  
Yes I have learnt from the things that you said ah huh  
Chorus  
You opened my eyes  
You make me believe  
That there is a chance for a guy like me  
You opened my eyes  
You showed me someone that no one else can see  
You opened my eyes  
You bring me the sun  
You make me believe I am someone  
You opened my eyes  
To a whole new world for me  
I was lost  
I was scared I was losing my mind  
Running away from myself all the time  
Coz there was something I was waiting to find ah huh  
There you were coz God has sent me an angel from above  
You gave me strength and you showed me how to love  
For that Im thankful for the rest of my life ah huh  
You opened my eyes  
You make me believe  
That there is a chance for a guy like me  
You opened my eyes  
You showed me someone that no one else can see  
You opened my eyes  
You bring me the sun  
You make me believe I am someone  
You opened my eyes  
To a whole new world for me  
Now youre gone  
And though it hurts to know youre with someone new  
You know I always wanted the best for you  
You deserve to get the best in life too  
Im grateful for the time with you  
Oooh  
You opened my eyes  
You make me believe  
That there is a chance for a guy like me  
You opened my eyes  
You showed me someone that no one else can see  
You opened my eyes  
You bring me the sun  
You make me believe I am someone  
You opened my eyes  
To a whole new world for me  
You opened my eyes  
You opened my eyes  
You opened my eyes  
You opened my eyes
