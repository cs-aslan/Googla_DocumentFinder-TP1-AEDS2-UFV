Stiff competition  
If I go upyou take me higher  
Stiff competition  
And when Im down you take me higher  
Theres stiff competition all over the world  
I screw you you screw me they screw us  
  
Here we go again  
Oh but we have so much fun so much fun  
When were together  
When were together  
When were togethernow  
I looked hard in your eyes  
It was love at first sight  
  
It took me minutes youre still waiting  
Waiting for your turn you turn  
It wont be long  
Stiff competition  
I work hard every day of my life  
  
Stiff competition  
Get it up you take me higher  
Stiff competition  
All over the world  
The more I get the more I like it  
The bigger they are the harder they fall  
  
Again  
Stiff competition  
Stiff competition  
Stiff competition  
Stiff competition
