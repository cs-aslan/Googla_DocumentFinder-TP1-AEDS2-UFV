Verse  
Youve got a strange look in your eyes  
Nothing to get and no need to lie  
And when the dust come howl at your door  
Youre not afraid its just the role  
  
Its not the way that I want to be  
But I cant explain just how I feel  
Out of my heart and into my soul  
You were the start and you are the go  
  
But it isnt funny the way that you talk about me  
You know I cant change the way that you want me to be  
But I tried to do what I can gone is the life we built in a sec
