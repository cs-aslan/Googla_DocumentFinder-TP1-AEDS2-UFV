Mister frog went acourting and he did ride  
Uhhmm Uhhmm  
Mister frog went acourting and he did ride  
A sword and pistol by his side  
Uhhmm Uhhmm  
  
  
He went down to Missy Mousies door  
Where he had often been before  
  
  
He said Missy Mouse are you within  
Yes kind sir I sit and spin  
  
  
He took Missy Mouse upon his knee  
And said Missy Mouse will you marry me  
  
  
Without my Uncle Rats consent  
I wouldnt marry the presIdent  
  
  
Uncle Rat laughed and shook his fat sides  
To think his niece would be a bride  
  
  
When Uncle Rat gave his consent  
The weasel wrote the publishment  
  
  
Where will the wedding supper be  
Way down yonder in a holler tree  
  
  
What will the wedding supper be  
Two green beans and a blackeyed pea  
  
  
The first guest in was a bumblebee  
He danced a jig with a crookbacked flea  
  
  
The owl did hoot the birds they sang  
And through the woods the music rang  
  
  
They all went sailing cross the lake  
And got swallered up by a big black snake  
  
  
Theres bread and cheese upon the shelf  
If you want any more you can sing it yourself
