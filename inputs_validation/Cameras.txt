Um its hardly a secret  
You aint gon stop tryna get where you going until you reach it  
Always had them bars back in the day  
When the same ones running up on you wasnt speaking  
Look at all your achievements  
You work hard so itd be kinda hard not to believe that  
You party every weekend weekend  
Fuck em all who act like they aint see it then  
All them nights on the plane  
Buses nigga too had to charge it to the game  
Always wanted stardom and the fame  
Learn to out smart em  
And now it aint no stopping the champagne from poppin  
The draws from droppin  
Us seeing muscle cars and coppin em  
Started off just a little less popular yea  
  
Now you got a new place  
You drive a new car  
You smile for cameras live life like a superstar  
Dont care what they say  
You reach for the stars  
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about  
And everyone knows who you are  
  
Never gets boring  
And haters in your face you just ignore em  
Dont know what they talking shit for  
Seems niggas get theres you just tryna get yours therefore  
You left all the people you care for  
Hopped on a plane and got air born  
Seen all the bullshit and fell for it  
But its all good now  
Cause the same ones that talk shit  
Telling everyone you made it  
Then you start seein hoes you dated  
And your thoughts started getting jaded  
Now your lifes sort of different aint it  
Feel your scars knowin what your pain is  
But whats it all worth if its painless  
Say you wanna be famous yea  
  
Now you got a new place  
You drive a new car  
You smile for the cameras live life like a superstar  
Dont care what they say  
You reach for the stars  
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about  
And everyone knows who you are  
  
Are are are are are are are  
Are are are are are are are  
Who you are  
Are are are are are are are  
Are are are are are are are  
Who you are  
  
Always knew I was this good  
But never knew Id be this good  
Them niggas just startin Ive been doing it  
Hear em talk but they aint living my life  
In the dark tryna get in my light  
But chances I dont give em guys twice  
Spendin grands for hoes this is the high life  
And for the cameras posing this the high life  
Bottles raising for my niggas not here  
I pour out a couple sips  
Blew em on the beach I smoke for you on my trips  
Them days I was younger I knew this life was the shit  
But never like this  
Its so amazing we aint gotta duck shots  
We just pour and chase em  
Aint worry bout it cause they gon hate  
Know where Im going look where I came from  
  
Now you got a new place  
You drive a new car  
You smile for the cameras live life like a superstar  
Dont care what they say  
You reach for the stars  
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about  
And everyone knows who you are  
Are are are are are are are  
Are are are are are are are  
Who you are  
Are are are are are are are  
Are are are are are are are
