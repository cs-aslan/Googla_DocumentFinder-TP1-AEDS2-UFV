Kiss me once then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again  
Its been a long long time  
Havent felt like this my dear  
Since I cant remember when  
Its been a long long time  
  
Youll never know how many dreams  
Ive dreamed about you  
Or just how empty they all seemed without you  
So kiss me once then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again  
Its been a long long time  
  
Ah kiss me once then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again  
Its been a long time  
Havent felt like this my dear  
Since I cant remember when  
Its been a long long time  
  
Youll never know how many dreams  
I dreamed about you  
Or just how empty they all seemed without you  
So kiss me once then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again  
Its been a long long time  
Long long time
