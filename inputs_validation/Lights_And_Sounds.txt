Hello you how was the rest  
You made it through but never the less  
I got you out on a wire you be love and ill be a liar  
Tell it all and fill up the air but make it loud cause nobodies there  
Nobodies there nobodies there  
  
Stop turn take a look around  
At all of the lights and sounds  
Let them bring you in  
Slow burn let it all fade out  
And pull the curtain down  
Wonder where youve been  
  
Make it new but stay in the lines just let go  
Keep it inside smile big for everyone even when you know what theyve done  
They gave you the end but not where to start not how to build how to tare it
apart  
So Tell it all and fill up the air but make it loud cause nobodies there  
Nobodies there nobodies there  
  
Stop turn take a look around  
At all of the lights and sounds  
Let them bring you in  
Slow burn let it all fade out  
And pull the curtain down  
Wonder where youve been  
  
Ive got a way to work this out I got a way and you know how  
Ive got a way to work this out I got a way and you know how  
Ive got a way to work this out I got a way  
Ive got a way to work this out I got a way and you know how  
Ive got a way to work this out I got a way and you know how  
Ive got a way to work this out I got a way  
Ive got a way to work this out I got a way and you know how  
Ive got a way to work this out I got a way and you know how  
Ive got a way to work this out I got a way  
  
Stop turn take a look around  
At all of the lights and sounds  
Let them bring you in  
Slow burn let it all fade out  
And pull the curtain down  
Wonder where youve been  
  
Youve earned everything youve found and painted faces frown  
Ill say I knew you when
