Would you like to live in Houston  
Where the cowboys come to town  
Or maybe Pensacola  
Where the sun shines all year round  
Or even New York City  
Where the city never sleeps  
Im offering you the option  
Before you get in too deep  
  
If you can do anything else  
Baby be good to yourself  
You can find a nice place have a good life  
Dont worry bout me Im gonna be alright  
You can make a new start  
You can see yourself clear  
If you can do anything else do it  
But if you cant  
Baby you can stay right here  
  
Theres work up in Seattle  
If you dont mind the rain  
San Diego to Savannah  
Theyd all be glad you came  
But life with me would always be  
A roller coaster ride  
You wont hurt my feelings  
Whatever you decide  
  
If you can do anything else  
Baby be good to yourself  
You can find a nice place have a good life  
Dont worry bout me Im gonna be alright  
You can make a new start  
You can see yourself clear  
If you can do anything else do it  
But if you cant  
Baby you can stay right here  
  
This place might look real good right now  
But looking good dont last  
But if you choose it anyhow  
Ill give you all I have but  
  
If you can do anything else  
Baby be good to yourself  
You can find a nice place have a good life  
Dont worry bout me Im gonna be alright  
You can make a new start  
You can see yourself clear  
If you can do anything else do it  
But if you cant  
Baby you can stay right here
