It may be warm but the snow is going to fall  
Enough to cover us all  
Weve gotta be strong men and follow a path again  
  
Weve got to have faith in something bigger  
Faith in something bigger  
Faith in something big inside yourself  
  
It might be cold but the heat of our love will melt  
The snow we never felt  
Were young and hardy again we bow to weaker men  
  
Weve got to have faith in something bigger  
Faith in something bigger  
Faith in something big inside yourself  
  
The more we learn the less we believe to be true  
The more we prove the more remains to be proved  
Weve gotta be strong men and follow a path again  
  
Weve got to have faith in something bigger  
Faith in something bigger  
Faith in something big inside yourself inside yourself  
  
Faith in something bigger x 8
