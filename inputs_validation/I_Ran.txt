We made a promise  
But whats the difference  
Call me friend what you calling for  
You couldnt take me as I am  
But that was only party chat I ran  
  
You asked me up here  
You said it was gear  
So Liverpool but  
We never understood the slang  
We couldnt sing it like they sang  
But that was carnaby excuses I ran  
  
Like rentadriver  
Insurance freeway  
You can never tell  
You can only drive because experience  
Turns the corner now  
See what happens when you leave it  
  
Call me baby how our love grows  
Supremely simple  
Like baby baby baby  
Youre out of time  
  
Shine shine shine  
Dont call me shine  
But theres no rhythm to your rhyme I ran  
  
Like rentadriver  
Insurance freeway  
You can never tell  
You only drive because experience  
Turns the corner now  
See what happens when you  
Break a promise  
But whats the difference  
Call me friendwhat you callin for  
You couldnt take me as I am  
But that was only party chat I ran
