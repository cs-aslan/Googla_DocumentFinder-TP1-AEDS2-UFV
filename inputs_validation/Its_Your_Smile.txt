I cry the whole night just for you  
My tears will dry that is true  
But I cant live without you one more day  
Youre always in my heart I swear  
And if you call Ill be there  
But I cant live without you one more night  
And I promise I will touch the sky  
If you ask me baby I will die  
Oh babe I saved my life only for you  
  
Its your smile what makes my heartbeat fast  
Its your smile and it will last  
I know that you the one for me  
Its your smile I can never let you go  
Its your smile it always shows  
I know that youre the one for me  
  
You mean everything to me  
Day in day out youre a mystery  
And I cant live without you one more day  
And everyday is a new day  
And I cant sleep to see you stay  
Before my eyes my love cant let you go  
And I promise I will catch a star  
Move a mountain even I know so far  
Oh babe I saved my life only for you
