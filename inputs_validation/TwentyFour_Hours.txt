So this is permanent loves shattered pride  
What once was innocence turned on its side  
A cloud hangs over me marks every move  
Deep in the memory of what once was love  
  
Oh how I realized how I wanted time  
Put into perspective tried so hard to find  
Just for one moment thought Id found my way  
Destiny unfolded I watched it slip away  
  
Excessive flash points beyond all reach  
Solitary demands for all Id like to keep  
Lets take a ride out see what we can find  
A valueless collection of hopes and past desires  
  
I never realized the lengths Id have to go  
All the darkest corners of a sense I didnt know  
Just for one moment I heard somebody call  
Looked beyond the day in hand theres nothing there at all  
  
Now that Ive realized how its all gone wrong  
Gottas find some therapy this treatment takes too long  
Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway  
Gotta find my destiny before it gets too late
