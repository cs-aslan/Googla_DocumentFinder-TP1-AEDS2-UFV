Im a lucky man yes I am  
Living in Heaven down here on earth  
Her Tennessee smile drives me wild  
Dont you know I know what its worth  
Shes every little thing in life that makes me feel good  
  
Chorus  
Shes my radio turned up to 11  
Shes my country song that I just gotta sing along to  
So fine so fine like the finest wine  
Shes my blueeyed dream my summer queen  
I cant believe shes mine all mine  
Mine all mine all mine  
Mine all mine all mine  
  
That cool breeze kiss from her lips  
Is what Im missing when Im gone  
To tell the truth my hearts shot through  
When it comes to love she can do no wrong  
Shes every little thing in life that makes me feel so good  
  
Chorus  
  
Whoa oh whoa oh oh  
She got my heart skippin a beat  
Whoa oh whoa oh oh  
She got me dancin in the street  
  
Chorus  
  
Mine all mine all mine
