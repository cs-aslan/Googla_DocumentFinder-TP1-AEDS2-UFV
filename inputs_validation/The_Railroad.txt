Up each morning at five oclock  
Seem like the noonday sun aint never gonna stop  
The work is hard in a railroad yard  
Hey hey gotta make it today to punch a time card  
Workin on the railroad  
  
Chorus  
Oh you know the railroad is a mighty good line  
Come on and ride the railroad one more time  
Oh you know the railroad is a mighty good line  
Come on and ride the railroad one more time  
  
Dirt and sweat runnin down my back  
Workin on the railroad  
Work all day long up and down the railroad tracks  
Workin on the railroad  
Im a God fearing man and with many I stand  
Workin on the railroad  
And with God weve been working all hand in hand  
Workin on the railroad  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh you know the railroad is a mighty good line  
Workin on the railroad  
Come on and ride the railroad one more time  
Workin on the railroad  
Oh you know the railroad is a mighty good line  
Come on and ride the railroad one more time
