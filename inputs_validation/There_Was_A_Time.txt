Broken glass and cigarettes  
Writing on the wall  
It was a bargain for the summer  
And I thought I had it all  
I was the one who gave you everything  
The one who took the fall  
You were the one who would do anything  
The one who cant recall  
Where she was while she was sleeping  
In another womans bed  
Or the doctors or the lawyers  
Or a stranger that she met  
If theres nothing I can gain from this  
Or anything at all  
Itd be the knowledge that ya gave me  
When I thought I had it all  
  
It was a long time with you  
It was a long time with me  
Itd be a long for anyone  
But looks like its meant to be  
  
Social class and registers  
Cocaine in the hall  
All the way from California  
On the way beyond that stall  
To those nonnegotiations  
To simulate a call  
All the bad of learning evils and your ways around the laws that keep you  
  
Up and sitting pretty  
On a pedestal of men  
And now youre sleeping like an angel  
Near the man who reaped it in  
  
If theres something I can make of this  
Or anything at all  
Itd be the devil hates a loser and you thought you had it all  
  
It was a wrong time for you  
It was a wrong time for me  
It was the wrong time for everyone  
But looks like Im about to see for myself  
  
If I could go back in time to the place in my soulthere all alone  
Lonely tear drops  
Oohare calling you  
But I dont wanna know it now  
cause knowing you it wont change a damn thing  
But there was a time  
  
Yeah there was a time  
Didnt wanna know it all  
Didnt wanna know it all and  
I dont wanna know it now  
  
Oh  
  
Yeah there was a time  
Didnt wanna know it all  
Didnt wanna know it all and  
I dont wanna know it now  
  
Oh  
I would do anything for you  
There was a time  
I would do anything for you  
OhI would do anything for you  
There was a time  
  
There was a time  
Oh I would do anything for you  
Oh I would do anything for you  
Yeah there was a time  
Didnt wanna know it all  
Didnt wanna know it all  
And I dont wanna know it now  
I would do anything for you  
There was a time was a time
