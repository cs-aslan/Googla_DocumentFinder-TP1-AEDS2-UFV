When you see a shooting star in the night  
When you hear the warm wind whisper through the pines  
I want you to know  
  
Chorus  
Itll be me and my infinite love for you  
Its just like I promised you under heaven above  
It will live on long after we kiss goodbye  
Forever by your side  
My infinite love  
  
When you think someone is callin out your name  
When you feel that kind of feelin you cant explain  
Now you will know  
  
Chorus  
  
I want you to know  
  
Chorus  
  
My infinite love  
My infinite love
