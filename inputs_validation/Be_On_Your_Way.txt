Be on you way  
Dont try to say that  
You love me still  
If we couldnt find  
The right dream by now  
Then we never will  
We paid our dues at the door  
And never once saw the stage  
We wrote our share of loves lore  
And never quite filled the page  
So be on your way  
  
Be on your way  
Maybe someday we will  
Meet again  
Try not to cry  
Tears make me think  
How it might have been  
We loved as strong as we could  
But love only got in our way  
We took our time to be free  
Theres nothing much more to say but  
Be on your way
