Hear the whistle blowin so long  
Tellin me I gotta move along  
Coast to coast gonna steal highway  
Railroad boy up in the guiding daybreak  
  
Get no sleep in a boxcar  
Get no piece of line  
They catch you jumpin a freight train  
They give you such a hard time  
  
Movin fast as my time runs out  
Coal is something I can live without  
Railroad fever got me a route  
Like tumbleweed I aint got no roots  
  
You know no peace in a boxcar  
Just cant sleep on a line  
They catch you jumpin a freight train  
They give you such a hard time  
  
East coast towns they are  
Dark and cold  
West coast ladies  
They get right to my soul  
  
But you know  
Cant stand long  
Bet all railroaders  
Are singin my song
