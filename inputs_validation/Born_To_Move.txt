Evry day Im gonna strut that stuff  
When the musics loud I cant get enough  
Singin hi singin hi  
Come on feet teach yourself to move  
  
People shufflin up and down again  
Unhappy faces aint gonna get you in  
Singin hi singin hi  
Come on people teach yourself to move  
  
Hey hey hey all right  
  
Spread the news were goin have some fun  
Let it go movin sonofagun  
Singin hi signin hi  
Come on feet we was born to move  
  
Hey hey lord come on move it now boy
