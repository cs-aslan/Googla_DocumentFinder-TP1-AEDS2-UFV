I told her I wouldnt miss her at all  
As she walked through the door  
I couldnt care less  
If she didnt care anymore  
And with tears in my eyes I lied  
I was glad we were through  
As she drove away crying  
At the famous last words of a fool  
  
Famous last words of a fool  
Famous last words of a fool  
You wont break my heart  
And I dont love you  
Famous last words of a fool  
  
The first night without her would be easy  
I kept tellin myself  
Although Im dyin at the thought of her lyin  
Somewhere else  
Therell be nothin to it  
Ill easily find someone new  
As my breaking heart echoes  
The famous last words of a fool  
  
Famous last words of a fool  
Famous last words of a fool  
You wont break my heart  
And I dont love you  
Famous last words of a fool  
  
You wont break my heart  
And I dont love you  
Famous last words of a fool
