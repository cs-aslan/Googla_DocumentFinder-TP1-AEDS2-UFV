Oh baby child  
  
Its no secret that the stars are falling from the sky  
Its no secret that our world is in darkness tonight  
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moon  
You know I dont see you when she walks in the room  
  
Its no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help  
Its no secret that a liar wont believe anyone else  
They say a secret is something you tell one other person  
So Im telling you child  
  
A man will beg  
A man will crawl  
On the sheer face of love  
Like a fly on a wall  
Its no secret at all  
  
Its no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest  
Its no secret ambition bites the nails of success  
Every artist is a cannibal every poet is a thief  
All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief  
  
Over love  
  
A man will rise  
A man will fall  
From the sheer face of love  
Like a fly from a wall  
Its no secret at all  
  
Lovewe shine like a  
Burning star  
Were falling from the sky  
Tonight  
  
A man will rise  
A man will fall  
From the sheer face of love  
Like a fly from a wall  
Its no secret at all  
  
Oh yeah  
Its no secret that the stars are falling from the sky  
The universe exploded cause of one mans lie  
Look I gotta go yeah Im running outta change  
Theres a lot of things if I could Id rearrange
