You have got a body to  
To make a man just lose his mind  
To give me a shiver send it down to my spine  
Its all because of  
You have got a body to  
To bring a man down on his knees  
Just let me inside dont leave me begging please  
Dont ever go  
Everybody knows  
That Im under the spell of your love  
Got nothing but you on my mind  
Thats the way it goes  
Its no wonder youre tearing my heart  
Simply in pieces tonight  
You have got a body to  
To make a man just sell his soul  
Right to the devil I think after all  
I should have known  
Everybody knows  
That Im under the spell of your love  
Got nothing but you on my mind  
Everybody knows  
And I wonder if you know it too  
I skywrite your name way up high  
In the sky in the sky in the sky  
To bring a man down on his knees  
Just let me inside dont leave me begging please  
Dont ever go  
Everybody knows  
That Im under the spell of your love  
Got nothing but you on my mind  
Thats the way it goes  
Its no wonder youre tearing my heart  
Simply in pieces tonight  
Everybody knows  
That Im under the spell of your love  
Got nothing but you on my mind  
Everybody knows  
And I wonder if you know it too  
I skywrite your name way up high  
In the sky in the sky in the sky  
Skywriter
