Inside my lorry  
I am driving through the night  
Inside my lorry  
The world does look all right  
Five to five I got to drive  
And if you ask me where I go  
I tell you coast to coast is what I do  
Coast to coast you know  
  
Motors noise  
My only choice  
I want to hear it all night long  
Orchestra for my voice  
For my only song  
Hey gotta drive see yall night  
  
Coast to coast thats my life  
Coast to coast all right  
Motors noise  
My only choice  
I want to hear it all night long  
Orchestra for my voice  
For my only song
