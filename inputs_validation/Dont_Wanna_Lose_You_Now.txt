I never thought that I would lose my mind  
That I could control this  
Never thought that Id be left behind  
That I was stronger than you baby  
Girl if only I knew what Ive done  
You know so why dont you tell me  
And I I would bring down the moon and the sun  
To show how much I care  
  
Chorus  
Dont want to lose you now  
Baby I know we can win this  
Dont want to lose you now  
No no or ever again  
  
Ive got this feeling youre not gonna stay  
Its burning within me  
The fear of losing  
Of slipping away  
It just keeps getting closer baby  
Whatever reason to leave that Ive had  
My place was always beside you  
And I wish that I didnt need you so bad  
Your face just wont go away  
  
Chorus  
  
I never thought that I would lose my mind  
That I could control this  
Never thought that Id be left behind  
  
That I was stronger than you  
Dont want to lose to loneliness  
Girl I know we can win  
Dont want to lose to emptiness oh no  
Never again  
  
Chorus
