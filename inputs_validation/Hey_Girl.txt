Hey girl I want you to know  
Im gonna miss you so much if you go  
Hey girl Ill tell you no lie  
Something deep inside of mes going to die  
  
If you say so long if this is goodbye  
Hey girl this cant be true  
How am I supposed to exist without you  
Hey girl dont put me on  
  
Whats gonna happen to me when youre gone  
How will I live how can I go on  
How can I go on  
Hey girl now sit yourself down  
  
Im not afraid to get down on the ground  
And beg you beg you to stay  
Dont go away  
Hey girl
