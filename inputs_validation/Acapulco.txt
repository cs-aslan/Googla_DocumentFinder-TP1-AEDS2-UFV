Theres love in the air  
Well can you feel it now  
Theres love in the air and thats nice  
  
Youre learnin a lot  
About each others ways  
Youre learnin a lot aint that right  
  
You work like a dog to try and get it good  
You work with your heart every day  
You know when youre through  
Youre gonna take your friend and get away  
  
To Acapulco to Acapulco  
Thats where theyll find us  
In sunny blue waters  
Where the sand is warm and friendly  
  
Hey Acapulco hey Acapulco  
I hear you softly calling  
Were sailing around the horn of love  
To Acapulco  
  
Its good and its bad  
When things are going right  
Its good and its bad when they swing  
But you know that youre glad  
You finally get it right  
You know that youre glad so you sing  
  
But at seventy two its hard to get around  
At seventy two but not now  
Its me and its you and we can get around  
Cause we know how  
  
In Acapulco in Acapulco  
Thats where theyll find us  
In sunny blue waters  
Where the sand is warm and friendly  
  
Hey Acapulco hey Acapulco  
I hear you softly calling  
Were sailing around the horn of love  
To Acapulco  
Were sailing around the horn of love  
To Acapulco
