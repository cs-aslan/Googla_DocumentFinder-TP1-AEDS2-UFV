Darling give me your absence tonight  
Take the shade from the canvas  
And leave me the white  
Let me sink in the silence that echoes inside  
And dont bother leaving the light on  
Cause I suddenly feel like a different person  
From the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion  
And I ran my hand oer a strange inversion  
A vacancy that just did not belong  
The child is gone  
  
Honey help me out of this mess  
Im a stranger to myself  
But dont reach for me Im too far away  
I dont want to talk cause theres nothing left to say  
  
So my darling  
Give me your absence tonight  
Take all of your sympathy and leave it outside  
Cause theres no kind of loving  
That can make this all right  
Im trying to find a place I belong  
And I suddenly feel like a different person  
From the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion  
And I ran my hand over a strange inversion  
As the darkness turns into the dawn  
The child is gone  
The child is gone
