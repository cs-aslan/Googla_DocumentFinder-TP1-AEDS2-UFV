Why do you always seem to criticize me  
Seems like everything I do just turns out wrong  
Why dont you come on out and despise me  
So I could pack my bag and baby Id be gone  
  
Remember when you used to call me honey  
Id turn around and call you honey too  
You might think its a joke but it aint funny  
To hurt someone whos so in love with you  
  
Chorus  
A clown puts his makeup on upside down  
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown  
You might think Im here when you put me down  
But actually Im on the other side of town  
  
My bodys in this room with you just catchin hell  
While my soul is drinking beer down the road a spell  
You might think Im listening to your grocery list  
But Im leaning on the jukebox and Im about halfway there  
  
Im sittin on a chair just behind my ear  
Playing dominoes and drinking some ice cold beer  
When you get done talking Ill come back downstairs  
And assume the body of the person you presume who cares  
  
Chorus  
  
Im Across the river on the other side of town  
In my mind Im on the other side of town
