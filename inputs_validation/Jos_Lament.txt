I stayed away so long Jo  
Dont think that I could come back  
Youre doin so well without me girl  
Youd laugh if youd knowd where Im at  
  
You knew me when it was all my world  
Somehow its all passed me by  
But dont let on to my friends Jo dear  
That things aint turned out as planned  
  
You bore my child then I left you aside  
I dont expect you to forgive  
But Jo I can say in a funny old way  
I was sure that I had it made  
  
I still possess a photograph  
My memory to refresh  
But fade it may Jo I can say  
I was sure that I had it made  
  
You bore my child then I left you aside  
I dont expect you to forgive  
But now Im not so young and Im so afraid  
To sleep alone for the rest of my days
