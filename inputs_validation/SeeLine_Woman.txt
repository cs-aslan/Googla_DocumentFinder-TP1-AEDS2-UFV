Yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Alright ye  
  
Seeline woman  
She drink coffee  
She drink tea  
And then go home  
Seeline woman  
  
Seeline woman  
Dressed in green  
Wears silk stockings  
With golden seams  
Seeline woman  
  
Seeline woman  
Dressed in red  
Make a man lose his head  
Seeline woman  
  
Seeline woman  
Black dress on  
For a thousand dollars  
She wail and she moan  
Seeline woman  
  
Wiggle wiggle  
Turn like a cat  
Wink at a man  
And he wink back  
Now child  
Seeline woman  
  
Empty his pockets  
And wreck his days  
Make him love her  
And shell fly away  
  
Seeline woman  
Take it on out now  
Empty his pockets  
And she wreck his days  
And she make him love her  
Then she sure fly away  
She got a black dress on  
For a thousand dollars  
She wail and she moan
