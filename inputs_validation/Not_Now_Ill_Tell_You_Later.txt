Do do do do  
Do do do do do  
Do do do do do do hey  
  
When my dad thought I had become of age  
He said son youre getting to the lovin stage  
  
I said oh yeah oh yeah  
  
its time you stopped being all alone  
Youve got to find a girl you can call your own  
  
I said not now Ill tell you later  
Not now Ill tell you when  
Not now Ill tell you later  
When Im gonna fall in love  
  
Do do do do  
Do do do do do  
Do do do do do do yeah  
  
I met a little girl fine as could be  
I said girl youre the girl that was made for me  
  
She said oh yeah oh yeah  
  
I thought if I tried I just couldnt miss  
So I asked the lil girl for just one lil kiss  
  
She said not now Ill tell you later not now  
Not now Ill tell you when not now  
Not now Ill tell you later  
When Im gonna fall in love  
  
When its time for you to fall in love  
It wont make sense for you to hurry  
Take you time and make up your mind  
Cause the surer you are the less you have to work  
  
Do do do do  
Do do do do do  
Do do do do do do hey  
  
Not now Ill tell you later not now  
Not now Ill tell you when not now  
Not now Ill tell you later  
everybody  
When Im gonna fall in love
