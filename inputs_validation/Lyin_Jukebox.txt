Well Ive been sittin here listenin  
To your songs all night long  
Oh you think youve got it all figured out  
You dont know at all  
  
Everything Ive heard from you  
Its all a pack of lies  
I wouldnt spend another quarter  
For what youve said tonight  
  
Lyin jukebox aint you got a song  
That tells the truth I didnt do her wrong  
Lyin jukebox aint a word of it so  
You know I didnt leave her  
That woman made me go  
  
Well I think youve already said way too much  
And Ive had way too many rounds  
I never fought a jukebox before  
But its time to hit you down  
  
Youve made a whole lotta accusations  
Without one bit of proof  
And if you say I cheated one more time  
Ill pull the plug on you  
  
Lyin jukebox aint you got a song  
That tells the truth I didnt do her wrong  
Lyin jukebox aint a word of it so  
You know I didnt leave her  
That woman made me go  
You know I didnt leave her  
That woman made me go
