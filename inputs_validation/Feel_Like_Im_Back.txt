Hey hey hey hey  
I take it in  
I blow it out  
On the courthouse steps after they throw it out  
Bentley waiting by the curb I spur it out  
Doors dont open they self the chauffeur get out  
My exhale made anything a foggy blur  
I make my way through the reporters and photographers  
I take my ladys hand I shake my attorneys  
Slide in the back seat and lets begin this journey  
Told the driver hold off before we pushed out  
I let my window down and out comes a kush cloud  
Any last words  
Justice has been served  
Now back to the streets thats what the hustlers deserve  
  
Well alright okay  
Ive been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
Im feeling like Im back just like Im back

Said Im feeling like Im back just like Im back  
Said Im feeling like Im back feel like Im back  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
I aint lose a step  
I aint miss a beat  
Thugs have emotions we miss the streets  
We kiss the heat  
We love the block  
We rubber band the money we black glove the glock  
Im screamin free at last free at last  
She used to send me pictures so I could see that ass  
Thats real talk thats a real bitch  
Fly as I left the minx still fit  
They know my name but in case they didnt know so  
Appear in a casket courtesy of loso  
So you should have your shit packed  
Im a need ya to not be here when I get back  
  
Well alright okay  
Ive been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
Im feeling like Im back just like Im back  
Said Im feeling like Im back feel like Im back  
Said Im feeling like Im back just like Im back  
Said Im feeling like Im back feel like Im back
