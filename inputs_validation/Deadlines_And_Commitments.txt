That place we all run to  
It can come down on you  
The expectation can be great  
  
If you should ever tire  
Or if you should require  
A sudden simple twist of fate  
  
Dont hide away  
Theres something to be said for pushing through  
Wed never ride on horses that discourage you  
  
If you should fall upon hard times  
If you should lose your way  
There is a place  
Here in this house  
That you can stay  
  
If you should find romance  
Go on and take that chance  
Before the strategies begin  
  
Deadlines and commitments  
Every morning  
And in the evening  
They can suck you in  
Boy dont I know it  
  
This offer would be standing  
All youve got to do is call  
Dont be afraid to knock on the door  
  
If you should fall upon hard times  
If you should lose your way  
There is a place  
Here in this house  
That you can stay  
  
Im not talking about  
Deadlines and commitments  
Sold out of confusion  
There is a place  
Here in this house  
That you can stay  
  
Catch you darling  
Ill be waiting  
I am on your side  
  
This offer would be standing
