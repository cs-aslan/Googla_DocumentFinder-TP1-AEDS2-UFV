8 oclock get up get outta bed  
I feel like a truck ran over my head  
Another day of stress and sorrow  
Skip breakfast cause I gotta go  
Aint got no time to take it slow  
And I will do my hair tomorrow  
  
I cant take it no more  
Oh no no no  
Is this what Im living for  
  
But my Uncle John from Jamaica  
Keeps on calling every day  
Just buy a ticket and take a  
Summer HoliHoliday  
  
6 oclock my job is still not done  
The life Im living aint no fun  
Too many days of stress and sorrow  
My boss just wont give me a break  
And this is more than I can take  
  
Think I will quit this job tomorrow  
  
But my Uncle John from Jamaica  
Keeps on calling every day  
Just buy a ticket and take a  
Summer HoliHoliday
