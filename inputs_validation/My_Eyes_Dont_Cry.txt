I was a lonely no one  
Living in a vacuum as lifes debris  
Victimized as one whose self deprivation  
Had made for my outer insecurity  
  
I was a he aint nothin  
Living in the slums of loves misery  
Starving from the lack of sweet affection  
Til you came to rescue me  
  
My eyes dont cry no more  
My heart dont ache no more  
Since you walked through my door  
I dont have to no longer be blue  
  
My eyes dont cry no more  
My heart dont ache no more  
Now that loves touched my soul  
All my lonely nights alone are through  
  
I was a Mr Lonely  
Seeing only darkness in the bright of day  
Blind even though my eyes were wide opened  
But then your love sunshined my way  
  
My eyes dont cry no more  
My heart dont ache no more  
Since you walked through my door  
I dont have to no longer be blue  
  
My eyes dont cry no more  
My heart dont ache no more  
Now that loves touched my soul  
All my lonely nights alone are through  
  
Repeat x2  
I dont cry baby baby I dont cry  
I dont cry baby baby I dont cry  
I dont cry baby baby I dont cry  
  
My life was without reason  
Sinking in a hell that had no space or time  
Falling to the burning pit of pain and sorrow  
Until you saved this life of mine  
  
My eyes dont cry no more  
My heart dont ache no more  
Since you walked through my door  
I dont have to no longer be blue  
  
My eyes dont cry no more  
My heart dont ache no more  
Now that loves touched my soul  
All my lonely nights alone are through  
  
I dont cry baby baby I dont cry  
I dont cry baby baby I dont cry  
I dont cry baby baby I dont cry  
I dont cry baby baby I dont cry  
  
My eyes dont cry no more  
My heart dont ache no more  
My nights are not lonely no more  
My tears dont flow no more  
My eyes dont cry my eyes dont cry  
My eyes dont cry no more
