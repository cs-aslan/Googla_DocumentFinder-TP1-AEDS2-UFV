Like the pine trees lining the winding road  
Ive got a name  
Ive got a name  
Like the singing bird and the croaking toad  
Ive got a name  
Ive got a name  
And I carry it with me like my daddy did  
But Im living the dream that he kept hid  
Moving me down the highway  
Rolling me down the highway  
Moving ahead so life wont pass me by  
Like the North wind whistling down the sky  
Ive got a song  
Ive got a song  
Like the whippoorwill and the babys cry  
Ive got a song  
Ive got a song  
And I carry it with me and I sing it loud  
If it gets me nowhere Ill go there proud  
Moving me down the highway  
Rolling me down the highway  
Moving ahead so life wont pass me by  
And Im gonna go there free  
Like the fool I am and Ill always be  
Ive got a dream  
Ive got a dream  
They can change their minds but they cant change me  
Ive got a dream  
Ive got a dream  
I know I could share it if you want me to  
If your going my way Ill go with you  
Moving me down the highway  
Rolling me down the highway  
Moving ahead so life wont pass me by  
Moving me down the highway  
Rolling me down the highway  
Moving ahead so life wont pass me by
