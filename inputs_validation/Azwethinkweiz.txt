Floatin round my brain  
Tryin to think about the other thing  
Than that thought you know Im considering  
What if what I thought  
About who I think I though I was  
Was nothing more than my cerebellum slobbering  
Azwethinkweizm is hard to think about  
But simple to trust  
  
Youll know your on it  
When your brain wont stop to take a break no  
So when donut boy comes askin around  
Tryin to figure out somethin new  
You just smile and say  
Pardon you Im sifting through  
Some particles and farcing through some folds  
Ive stumbled upon a brain fart  
Which melts away your molds  
  
So I think upon that ponder  
While Im pondering the thought  
Just thinkin about the thinkweiz  
Is leaving me distraught  
Well I think I thought  
I saw an Azwethinkweiz  
Lookin like we think we do  
Like we think we do  
  
Some think Im insane  
Cause I think about the other thing  
Than that one thought you call reality  
What if what you thought  
About who you think you thought you were  
Was nothing more than illusion rapidly crumbling  
Azwethinkweism should be a topic we all can trust  
  
Its just to bad it makes your  
Head go zippity crack dang  
So when donut boy comes sniffing around  
Trying to figure out something new  
You just laugh and say Pardon you  
Im sifting through some particles and  
Farcing through some folds  
  
Ive stumbled upon a brain fart  
Which melts away your molds  
So I think upon that ponder  
While Im pondering the thought  
Just thinking about the thinkweiz  
Is leaving me distraught  
  
Well I think I thought I saw an Azwethinkweiz  
Lookin like we think we do  
Like we think we do  
So what if you thought about the thinkweiz  
Was nothing like you think you are  
Youd probably more than likely be a  
Lookyloo lookin like you think you do  
Like you think you do
