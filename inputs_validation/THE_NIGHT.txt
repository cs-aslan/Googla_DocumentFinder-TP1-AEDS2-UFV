Its right for the night  
Thousands of lights  
Show us the way  
Me and my mates  
Will have a good time  
In the amusement arcade  
Unpack your bags  
Were here at last  
For the birds that play ball  
This is it  
Its what its all about  
We worked all week for this  
Lets go  
Go to the pub  
Dance for a while  
Have a drink or so  
Please ourselves  
Do what we want  
Tonights ours  
To have fun  
The night  
Will soon be gone  
It goes too fast  
Lets not waste time  
No need to worry ourselves now  
The night  
The night of our week  
One night  
We remember it well  
No one  
Can take it away  
No one  
Can deny us the night  
The night  
One night  
Hear the sea  
Come tumbling in  
Freezing us all  
Feeling the breeze  
Beating the pier  
As we try and sleep  
It feels so secure  
Along with the sea I mean  
What a pity  
Our weekends gone  
The sea remains  
But thats all  
We had a good time  
While we were here  
Goodnight
