Its too late to turn back now  
There aint no space back there  
And how did I begin to lose my self control  
How did I begin to lose my self control  
  
There aint a thing that you could give me  
With the love forever with me  
Thats the only thing that satisfies my soul  
Thats the only thing that satisfies my soul  
  
Chorus  
I dont want to be the one  
Remember it was only fun  
Two strangers touching in the sun it had to end  
I dont want to be the guy to tell you things that make you cry  
You know as well as I know youre my only friend  
  
There aint a thing that you could give me  
With the love forever with me  
Thats the only thing that satisfies my soul  
Thats the only thing that satisfies my soul  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont want to be the guy to tell you things that make you cry  
You know as well as I know youre my only friend  
You know as well as I know youre my only friend  
Youre my only friend  
My only friend  
My only friend
