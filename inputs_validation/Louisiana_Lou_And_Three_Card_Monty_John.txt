Chorus  
Louisiana Lou and Three Card Monty John  
Oh lord what a natural pair  
Looking for a game fortune and fame  
Waitin just a little farther down the road somewhere  
  
Now Three Card Monty is a gamblin game  
Two black aces and a pretty red queen  
Keep your eye on the lady and lay your money down  
Watch the fastest hand youve ever seen  
  
Texas Hustlin Billy lord hes on the road again  
He was seen in New Orleans the other day  
Now Lou is known as quite a man with a pool cue in his hand  
Wont be long til him and John were headed down that way  
  
Chorus  
  
It was Friday night lord the time was right  
Texas Billy finally made his play  
The game went on into the night and just about dawn  
They were counting Bills money lord headed for LA  
  
Chorus  
  
Waitin just a little farther down the road somewhere
