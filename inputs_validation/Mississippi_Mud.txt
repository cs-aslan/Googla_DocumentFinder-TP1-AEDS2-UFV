When the sun goes down the tide goes out the people gather round and they
all  
begin to shout  
  
Hey Hey Uncle Dud  
Its a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi Mud  
Its a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi Mud  
  
What a dance do they do  
Lordy how Im tellin you  
They dont need no band  
They keep time by clapping their hands  
Just as happy as a cow chewin on a cud  
  
Its a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi Mud  
Lordy how they play it  
Goodness how they sway it  
  
Uncle Joe uncle Jim  
How they pound that mire with vigor and vim  
  
Joy it nearly kill me  
Boy that music trills me  
  
What a show when they go  
Say they beat it up either fast or slow
