The days may come the days may go  
Like the dreams of love that we shared so long ago  
Its the time its the place to realize that I was wrong  
Its too late he wins and its there that you belong  
Its there you will find all the love I couldnt give  
While I live in regret for as long as I may live  
The years will pass but your memory will live on  
Its too late he wins and its there that you belong  
Its there you will find all the love I couldnt give  
Its there you will stay for as long as you may live  
Its the time its the place to realize that I was wrong  
Its too late he wins and its there that you belong  
Its too late he wins and its there that you belong
