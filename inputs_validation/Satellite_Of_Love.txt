Satellites gone  
Up to the skies  
Thing like that drive me  
Out of my mind  
  
I watched it for a little while  
I like to watch things on TV  
  
Satellite of love  
Satellite of love  
Satellite of love  
Satellite of  
  
Satellites gone  
Way up to Mars  
Soon it will be filled  
With parking cars  
  
I watch it for a little while  
I love to watch things on TV  
  
Satellite of love  
Satellite of love  
Satellite of love  
Satellite of  
  
Ive been told that youve been bold  
With Harry Mark and John  
Monday Tuesday Wednesday to Thursday  
With Harry Mark and John  
  
Satellites gone  
Up to the skies  
Thing like that drive me  
Out of my mind  
  
I watched it for a little while  
I love to watch things on TV  
  
Satellite of love  
Satellite of love  
Satellite of love
