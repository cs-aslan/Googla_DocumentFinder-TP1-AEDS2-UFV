You book the hotel Ill pack the bags honey  
You phone the airlines Ill call a cab  
When will you return well that all depends  
Just tell your mother that youre staying with friends  
Cause I know that youre my best friends girl  
But its the weekend I dont give a hell  
  
Ill bring the red wine you bring the ludes  
Your mothers doctor must be quite a dude  
Well hang the Dont Disturb outside our door  
Im gonna rock you till your pussys sore  
  
Oh my sweet Diana I cant wait for the manana  
Theres a hotel down in Mexico just made for two  
But I dont think you trust me and I cant say I blame you  
My reputation precedes me you aint never gonna leave me  
  
Soon as we get there Ill go check in  
Mr and Mrs Smith of Abilene  
You get naked honey Ill get down  
Im gonna chase you around  
  
And round and round and round  
You say you cant stand monotony  
I say what happened to fidelity  
Dirty weekend made for two  
  
Just me and you honey  
I want to love that can last for ages  
not the trash youve been giving to strangers  
  
Dont want to make your two big brothers brothers annoyed  
Do you think youll get the Polaroid
