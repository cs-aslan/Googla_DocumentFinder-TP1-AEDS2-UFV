Chorus  
I watch you sleeping little angel face  
And on behalf of the human race  
Welcome to this crazy place  
  
I watch you sleeping innocent and free  
I dont know what your dreams may be  
You dont know what you mean to me  
  
You have never heard thunder  
You have never seen the rain  
But you can still feel the wonder  
You can still feel the pain  
  
And sometimes you look at me  
So wise and so sure  
I could easily believe you have been here before  
  
Chorus  
  
I wont be here forever  
But as long as Im around  
I promise you I will never let you down  
To help make a world you can feel worthy of  
I will teach you to fly on the wings of my love  
  
I watch you sleeping brave and unaware  
You dont know yet so you dont care  
I want you to know its hard out there  
  
Chorus  
  
I watch you sleeping x6
