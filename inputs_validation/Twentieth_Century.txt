Oh I learned a lesson  
From the twentieth century  
That I dont think we can just dismiss  
After one hundred years  
Of inhumanity  
The lesson that I learned was this  
  
Sometimes the solution  
Is worse than the problem  
Lets stay together  
  
Well I bought a ticket  
To the revolution  
And I cheered when the statues fell  
Everyone came  
To destroy what was rotten  
But they killed off what was good as well  
  
Sometimes the solution  
Is worse than the problem  
Lets stay together  
  
Stay with me  
This century  
Together were better  
  
Oh I learned a lesson  
From the twentieth century  
It may seem somewhat hit or miss  
If youve certainty  
Bout the way its all meant to be  
The lesson that you need is this  
  
Sometimes the solution  
Is worse than the problem  
Lets stay together
