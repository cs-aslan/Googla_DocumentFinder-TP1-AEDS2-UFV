Shes pristine intellectual and verbal  
Every dads living dream  
Upper class behaviour is in her genes  
  
She is smart shes manipulative and gorgeous  
At prom she was crowned as a queen  
But she never takes you behind the scenes  
  
Shes like a  
Sin  Cinderella  
Choked by the world shes in  
Sin  Cinderella  
Surving on vitamins  
Sin  Cinderella  
An angel throughout the day  
But in the nighttime  
Her glory just flies away  
  
She is cool a sophisticated actress  
Playing herself on the screen  
Though her smile is sweet her thoughts are obscene  
  
Pure as white goes to bed thought its still early  
Kisses her father goodnight  
Then shes turning on her working light  
  
Shes like a  
  
In the night if you spot a blue light window  
It could be a new tvset  
Or is someone making friends on the net   
  
Shes a like
