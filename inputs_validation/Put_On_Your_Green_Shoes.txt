Gather round children and you will hear  
The sound of a cricket crying in your ear  
Thats mother nature shes crying out loud  
This old earth needs some loving now so  
Chorus  
Put on your green shoes  
Put on your green shoes  
Mother nature shes calling to you  
To put on your green shoes  
Put on your green shoes and walk with me  
Well go around back and plant a tree  
Help it grow and you will see  
The way the world was meant to be  
Chorus  
Wonder how the world would be  
Without the shade of a redwood tree  
Without all the fish the birds and the bees  
Springtime would be lonely so  
Chorus
