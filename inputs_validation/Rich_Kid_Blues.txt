Havin bad times now Im paying dues  
Got shoes and money good friends too  
I always play to win and always seem to lose  
Thats why I think I got a rich kids blues  
Thats why I think I got a rich kids blues  
  
And I know whats going on  
And I know that the way is too long  
And I know just exactly whats on your mind  
Youll be back and Ill lose you forever  
  
But Im wondering why girl should I ask your name  
All the people standing by are they in my game   
Love is just a story a story without words  
Words are even never seen and never even heard  
  
And I know whats going on  
And I know that the way is too long  
And I know just exactly whats on your mind  
Youll be back and Ill lose you forever
