Youre old enough to know better as soon  
As you can see  
This world is out to get you the way its gotten me  
It starts out in the morning then moves to afternoon  
By the time you reach the evenin youre  
Barkin at the moon  
Between what youre told and what youve seen  
Youll know that its just another show  
Everybody sells somethineverybodys got game  
We all keep believin no one is to blame  
The world keeps getting hotter ice falls in the sea  
We buy a bigger engine and say it isnt me  
Between what we say and what we mean  
Its clean far away from that machine  
We talk on the phone because were alone  
And everyone knows it  
We feel overdue we want something new  
And everyone knows it  
Its time to join with the living time to understand  
Were all in this together weve got to have a plan  
Were facing an extinction every other day  
Theres got to be an answer weve got to find a way  
Between what is dead and what is green  
We learn what to keep and what to burn  
Between what is fair and whats obscene  
Its clean far way from that machine
