I love you girl with all my heart and soul  
I cant understand why you treat me cold  
Your every wish girl is my command  
And thats why I cant seem to understand why  
Girl girl girl why you want to make me blue  
Im askin you girl girl girl why you want to make me blue  
  
One day you say you love me too  
The next day you tell me that we are through  
My love for you is just a game  
But each time we play girl my heart feels the pain  
Girl girl girl why you want to make me blue Oh  
Girl girl girl why you want to make me blue So blue  
  
Woo girl girl girl why you want to make me blue Make me blue  
Oh girl oh girl oh girl tell me why cant you be true Cant be true  
The way you treat me it just isnt fair  
You make it so plain you just dont care  
You have a ball around my time  
Sleepless nights are getting me tired  
Girl girl girl why you want to make me blue  
Im askin you girl girl girl why you want to make me blue Baby  
Girl girl girl why you want to make me blue
