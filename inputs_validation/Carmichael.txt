Silk scarf and a napkin hidden in a drawer  
Two hundred bucks in an envelope labeled Lenore  
  
Maybe she shouldnt see this  
She should never know  
Said the widows best friend Ann  
Ill just take it and go  
Ill give it her the money later  
Say it was in his shoe  
That way shell never find out  
Thatll do  
  
Carmichael was a credit to the force  
In everything he did  
Its like weve got a big hole in our side  
Where he fit  
If any of you officers would like to say a word  
Now would be the time to be heard  
Thank you chief I sure would  
He was a partner of mine  
He was always very careful  
Played it straight down the line  
  
One by one the officers spoke  
And the service drew to a close  
He had no living relatives but his wifewho never showed  
She just couldnt face the menthey all understood  
They got in their cars and drove home  
As directly as they could  
  
Carmichael you asshole  
The new widow sobbed beneath her vale  
Shot down in the line of duty  
Is this how justice never fails  
I wish that things were better  
When we said goodbye today  
But we had our share of good times though along the way  
  
Remember Hey mister Las VegasYou used to be so cool  
We met Wayne Newton down on Pebble Beach and you acted like a fool  
But we both just couldnt stop laughingit seemed so funny to us  
We left our luggage back in the room and almost missed the bus  
That was a great vacationmaybe the best of all  
But goddamn it Carmichael youre dead now and Im talking to the wall  
  
The force got back to normal  
Carmichael was replaced  
For one year nobody parked a car in Carmichaels space
