They dont eat dont sleep  
They dont feed they dont seethe  
Bare their gums when they moan and squeak  
Lick the dirt off a larger ones feet  
They dont push dont crowd  
Congregate until theyre much too loud  
Fuck to procreate till they are dead  
Drink the blood of their so called best friend  
  
They dont scurry when something bigger comes their way  
Dont pack themselves together and run as one  
Dont shit where theyre not supposed to  
Dont take whats not theirs they dont compare  
  
They dont scam dont fight  
Dont oppress an equals given rights  
Starve the poor so they can be well fed  
Line their holes with the dead ones bread  
  
They dont scurry when something bigger comes their way  
Dont pack themselves together and run as one  
Dont shit where theyre not supposed to  
Dont take whats not theirs they dont compare  
  
Rats They dont compare  
Ben the two of us need look no more
