Yeah  
  
Well its a long way from Star Mississippi  
To the big stage Im singing on tonight  
And sometimes the butterflies still get me  
When Im in the spotlight  
  
And some people seem to think that Ive changed  
That Im different than I was back then  
But in my soul I know that Im the same way  
That Ive really always been  
  
Chorus  
Cause a Mississippi girl dont change her ways  
Just cause everybody knows her name  
Aint big headed from a little bit of fame  
I still like wearing my old ball cap  
Riding my kids around piggy back  
They might know me all around the world  
But yall Im still a Mississippi girl  
  
Woo  
  
Well I spent a few weeks in California  
They put my face on the big movie screen  
But that dont mean Ive forgotten where I came from  
Thats just me chasing dreams  
  
Cause a Mississippi girl dont change her ways  
Just cause everybody knows her name  
Aint big headed from a little bit of fame  
I still like wearing my old ball cap  
Riding my kids around piggy back  
They might know me all around the world  
But yall Im still a Mississippi girl  
  
Woo  
  
Cause a Mississippi girl dont change her ways  
Just cause everybody knows her name  
Aint big headed from a little bit of fame  
Still like wearing my old ball cap  
Riding my kids around piggy back  
They might know me all around this world  
But yall Im still a Mississippi girl  
  
Mississippi girl  
Oh oh  
Mississippi girl  
Mississippi girl  
Yeah yeah oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Mississippi girl  
Na  
Na
