Wait for me Ill understand  
I just need time to comprehend your changes  
Theres always been these changes in you  
I remember that there was a time when  
Fears we had we left behind and we danced  
But it seems the more we learn  
We learn that its  
  
Over Over  
Its dangerous this game we play  
Youre killing me with words  
  
Forget if you can  
The way you moved when our hands touched  
You forced me to force you  
Do you remember the dreams  
the nightmares we shared  
The poison of love so pure its deceiving  
And deceit is all we have its got to be over  
  
Over Over  
Its dangerous this game we play  
Youre killing me with words  
Over Over  
Too late to take a chance again its over
