Outside of Macon off a country road  
Justice was forsaken when they let the wrong man go  
Johnny Law was shady first one on the scene  
They called it murder in the first degree  
  
Dead man walkin walkin down the hall  
Judge says guilty but still hes standin tall  
Dead man walkin they say he broke the law  
Takin the life of another man who done his daughter wrong  
  
Chorus  
Light em up lay em down  
Take em out but theres more of us around  
When wrong is right and right is wrong  
Oh theres a dead man walkin tonight  
  
Walk on Repeat x3  
  
If I ask you a question would you tell the truth  
Would you pull the trigger if you were standin in his shoes  
Dead man walkin I know what Id do  
If someone hurt my baby Id be walkin too  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah  
So if I ask you that question would you tell the truth  
Dead man walkin
