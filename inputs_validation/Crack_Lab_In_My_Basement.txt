Ive got a cracklab in my basement  
Im a shining example of a junior acheivement  
Cooking up drugs on my chemistry set  
Twentyseven grand a week is what I get  
Chorus  
Ive got a cracklab in my basement  
Please dont tell my mommy on me  
Ive got a cracklab in my basement  
Every kid needs a hobby  
Im the only kid on my block with an uzi  
All the other fourth graders are jealous of me  
Ill be a millionaire by the time Im thirteen  
Im a perfect example of an American dream  
Repeat Chorus  
My parents are dumb theyll never suspect  
And if they do Ill just tell em its a science fair project  
My cub scout troop does the distribution  
And Im thinking of expanding into prostitution  
Repeat Chorus  
Bridge  
You mix it up You cook it down  
You serve it up out on the playground  
Crack Lab  
Repeat first verse  
Repeat chorus  
Repeat bridge
