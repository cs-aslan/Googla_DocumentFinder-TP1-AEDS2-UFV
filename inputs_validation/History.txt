I wander lonely streets  
Behind where the old Thames does flow  
And in every face I meet  
Reminds me of what I have run from  
In every man in every hand  
In every kiss you understand  
That living is for other men  
I hope you two will understand  
Ive got to tell you my tale  
Of how I loved and how I failed  
I hope you understand  
Ive got to tell you my tale  
Of how I loved and how I failed  
I hope you understand  
These feelings should not be in the man  
In every child in every eye  
In every sky above my head  
I hope that I know  
So come with me in bed  
Because its you and me were history  
There aint nothing left to say  
When I will get you alone  
Maybe we could find a room  
Where we could see what we should do  
Maybe you know its true  
Living with me is like keeping a fool  
In every man in every hand  
In every kiss you understand  
That living is for other men  
I hope you know that I am me so come on  
Im thinking about history  
And Im living for history  
And I think you know about me  
Cause I am  
And one and one is two  
But three is company  
When youre thinking about the things you do  
And youre thinking about the things you do  
I want to tell you my tale  
How I fell in love and jumped out on my bail  
I hope you understand theres more in a smile than in a hand  
In every sky in every kiss  
Theres something that I might have missed  
Why am I going to  
A place that now belongs to you  
But you were weak and so was I  
Lets pick it up lets even try  
To live today so why not smile  
Dont dream away your life Cause it is mine  
Is that a crime is that a crime this life is mine  
The bed aint made but its filled full of hope  
Ive got a skin full of dope
