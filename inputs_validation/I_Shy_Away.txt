  
  
  
  
Since I met you Ive missed you all my life  
  
What I dont know wont hurt me baby  
  
Since Ive known you I can recall the old times  
  
  
Wasnt that your face in my old photographs  
  
Didnt we laugh and talk for hours baby  
  
Really want to see you but baby  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
Dont you know what Im going through  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
I should be loving you but I just shy away  
  
  
I dont ask you about the girls in your life  
  
Cause what I dont know might hurt me baby  
  
I dont question when something feels right  
  
  
Always waiting for the right one  
  
You say I should take my chances darlin  
  
I could fall in live with you but baby  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
Dont you know what Im going through  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
I should be loving you  
  
  
Bridge  
  
I really want to share the love  
  
Share the love to share to love  
  
I really want to share the love  
  
Share the love to share the love  
  
Share the love  
  
  
Always waiting for the right one  
  
You say I should take my chances darlin  
  
I could really fall in love with you but baby  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
Dont you know what Im going through  
  
I dont you know what Im going through  
  
Baby I shy away from your love  
  
I should be loving you but I just shy away  
  
  
Chorus
