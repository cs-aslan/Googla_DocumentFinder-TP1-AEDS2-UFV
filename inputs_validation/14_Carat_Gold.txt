If you see me smile dont think Im acting strange  
I got my just reward for all my pains  
I you see me on the TV talking proud  
Please understand if I dont talk too loud  
Step around and dance a bit  
Polish up the dice  
Set em loose and let em roll  
This is my advice  
Keep your mind a mystery  
Runnin hot n cold  
Shes more than money  
Shes 14 Karat Gold  
  
If you wonder why Im acting up this way  
Gonna cash my chips Im leavin town today  
I got more love than I could ever spend  
So long farewell goodbye this is the end  
  
Step around and dance a bit  
Polish up the dice  
Set em loose and let em roll  
Be as cool as ice  
Keep your mind a mystery  
Runnin hot n cold  
Shes more than money  
Shes 14 Karat Gold  
  
If you get hit by the bug that bit on me  
If you get caught with something soft and sweet  
If you get found with something you cant waste  
Then listen bud let me give you a taste  
  
Step around and dance a bit  
Polish up the dice  
Set em loose and let em roll  
This is my advice  
Keep your mind a mystery  
Runnin hot n cold  
Shes more than money  
Shes 14 Karat Gold  
  
Step around and dance a bit  
Polish up the dice  
Set em loose and let em roll  
Be as cool as ice  
Keep your mind a mystery  
Runnin hot n cold  
Shes more than money  
Shes 14 Karat Gold
