This song aint meant to be pretty  
It aint meant to make you dance  
Theres so many unsolved problems  
Too many empty angry hands  
  
A little child in Ethiopia  
Will die before this song is through  
Poor eyes have only seen sadness  
Oh God show us what to do  
  
Im not preaching Im just singing  
Trying to get a message through  
Im not crazy I think maybe  
The answers with me and you  
  
Here they come  
Take us to your leader  
Take us to your leader  
Think about it  
  
A billion dollars on the arms race  
Billions floating round in space  
OPECs counting out its money  
Hunger stares us in the face  
  
The battlefield is little children  
Caught in a cross fire of hate  
How can we call ourselves Christians  
How can we turn the other way  
  
Im not preaching Im just singing  
Trying to get a message through  
Im not crazy I think maybe  
The answers with me and you  
  
Here they come  
Take us to your leader  
Listen to what theyre sayin  
Take us to your leader  
Think about it  
  
Nostradamus gave us warning  
You will never walk away  
One neutron bomb in the morning  
May just ruin your whole day  
  
Im not preaching Im just singing  
Trying to get a message through  
Im not crazy I think maybe  
The answers with me and you  
  
Here they come  
Take us to your leader  
Listen to what theyre sayin  
Take us to your leader  
Yeah  
  
Take us to your leader  
  
Take us to your leader
