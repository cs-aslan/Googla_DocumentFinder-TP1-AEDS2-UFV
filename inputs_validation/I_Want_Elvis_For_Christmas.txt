Well babybabybaby babybabybaby babybabybaby  
You aint nothing but a reindeer ooh barkin all the time  
Ever since we heard you singin  
Ever since we saw you swingin  
Our hearts lit up like a Christmas tree  
So pleaseplease Elvis spend Christmas with me  
And if you wont  
You aint nothing but a reindeer ooh barkin all the time  
Well if you aint here for Christmas  
Then you aint no friend of mine  
Babybabybaby babybabybaby  
If only you could hear what were sayin  
If Santa Claus could hear us prayin  
There isnt anything that we wouldnt pay  
If you could be here Elvis on Christmasday  
And if you wont  
Ill be so lonely baby Ill be so lonely  
Its gonna be a great romance  
So dont be cruel and love me tender  
Dont give me those blue moon blues  
Come back baby I wanna play house  
And I promise not to step on your blue suede shoes  
I want you I need you I love you  
There aint nobody above you  
Wont you listen to my Yuletide plea  
And pleaseplease Elvis spend Christmas with me  
And if you wont  
You aint nothing but a reindeer barkin all the time  
Well if you aint here for Christmas  
Then you aint no friend of mine  
So Elvis spend Christmas with me
