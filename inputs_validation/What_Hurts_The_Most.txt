I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house  
That dont bother me  
I can take a few tears now and then and just let em out  
Im not afraid to cry every once in a while  
Even though goin on with you gone still upsets me  
There are days every now and again I pretend Im okay  
But thats not what gets me  
  
Chorus  
What hurts the most was being so close  
And havin so much to say  
And watchin you walk away  
And never knowin what couldve been  
And not seein that lovin you  
Is what I was trying to do  
  
Its hard to deal with the pain of losin you everywhere I go  
But Im doing it  
Its hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and Im alone  
Still harder gettin up gettin dressed livin with this regret  
But I know if I could do it over  
I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart  
That I left unspoken  
  
What hurts the most was being so close  
And havin so much to say  
And watchin you walk away  
And never knowin what couldve been  
And not seein that lovin you  
Is what I was trying to do oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Not seeing that lovin you  
Thats what I was trying to do ooh
