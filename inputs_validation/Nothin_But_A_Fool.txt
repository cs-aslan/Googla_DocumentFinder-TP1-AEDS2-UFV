By B Amesbury  
So what do you think  
Maybe hell buy you a drink  
And run his fingers through your hair  
Apologize for having to stare  
But hes never seen such a face  
Whats it doing in such a place  
Says he knows a little spot  
That he thinks youll like a lot  
So he takes you in his car  
Background repeats Hoo hoo hoo  
Says it isnt far  
And you end up at his home  
Ah but you knew thats where you were going  
And he turns his stereo on  
Makes you feel like you belong  
And you end up in his bed  
Youre great was all he said  
Chorus  
Oh youre nothin but a fool  
If you think that he loves you  
Oh youre nothin but a fool  
If you think that he cares  
Youre nothin but a fool  
If you think that he wants you  
Oh youre nothin but a fool  
If you think he cares  
Yeah yeah  
So he lights a cigarette  
Background repeats hoo hoo hoo  
Turns on the tv set  
And you just want to be held for a while  
He dont even wanna smile  
So you try to tell a joke  
He just lights another smoke  
Its getting colder in that bed  
Youre great was all he said  
Background repeats chorus  
Oh youre nothin but a fool  
You silly fool  
If you think that he loves you  
Ah youre nothin but great big fool  
If you think he cares  
Youre nothin but a fool yes you  
If you think that he wants you  
Oh youre nothin but a fool  
If you think he cares  
Musical Interlude  
Just a silly fool ha  
Never thought it would happen to you  
Oh ho ho ho  
Background repeats Hoo hoo hoo  
Now youd really love stay  
But he says hes got a busy day  
And hell call you tomorrow night  
You make sure hes got your number right  
He gives you money for a cab ride home  
Suddenly youre all alone  
Waiting for his call  
And youre staring at the wall  
Ah youre nothin but a fool  
Background repeats chorus  
If you think that he loves you  
Ah youre nothin but a fool  
Silly fool ha  
You never thought it would happen to you  
Youre nothin but a fool  
If you think that he wants you  
Oh youre nothin but a fool  
If you think that he cares  
Youre nothin but a fool  
If you think that he loves you  
Oh youre nothin but a fool  
If you think he cares  
Youre nothin but a fool
