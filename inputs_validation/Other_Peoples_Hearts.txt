Im staying home this evening  
And playing my guitar  
And all the time Im strumming  
Im wondering where you are  
Oh yes I know its over  
I know I shouldnt care  
But I cant get away from you  
It seems youre always there  
How come I dont see you anymore  
How come we lost the magic touch  
Why cant I pick up the telephone  
When I want to call you so much  
Whos going to make me forget you  
And get you off my mind  
I could be out breaking other peoples hearts  
If you werent still breaking mine  
The winters drawing in again  
Another year has passed  
Now I think of things I meant to say  
But the time went by so fast  
I hear youre living in new york these days  
And you dont come here any more  
I keep asking myself so many questions  
But lately I wonder what Im wondering for  
Whos going to make me forget you  
And get you off my mind  
I could be out breaking other peoples hearts  
If you werent still breaking mine  
I let you pass me by  
I never tried too hard  
Though youll never see me cry  
You really made your mark  
How come I dont see you anymore  
How come we lost the magic touch  
And why cant I pick up the telephone  
When I want to hear your voice so much  
Whos going to make me forget you  
And get you off my mind  
I could be out breaking other peoples hearts  
If you werent  
If you werent still breaking mine
