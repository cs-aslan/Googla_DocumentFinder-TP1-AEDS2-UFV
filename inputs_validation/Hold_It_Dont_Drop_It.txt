Chorus  
You dont know what your doin  
What youre doin to me  
Try to stop it cant stop it  
Cause you got what I need  
You got me all open  
And now youre tryin to leave  
Hold it dont drop it dont drop it  
Stop it cant stop it wont stop it  
  
Every time I try to run  
Somethin keeps stoppin me  
I try my best to turn around  
But your touch wont let me leave  
I cant control it  
You put somethin inside of me  
Cause youre a problem  
Boy you must have poisoned me  
  
Chorus  
  
Boy I must be buggin  
Let you play those games I dont understand  
Ill be that yoyo on a string  
  
Roll it down Ill come right back to your hand  
I make excuses  
But we keep on rockin anyway  
But it aint workin  
When I let you go you make me stay  
  
Chorus  
  
Wont let me leave  
Control of me  
You got what I need  
Hold it dont drop it dont drop it  
Stop it cant stop it wont stop it  
Wont let you go  
Cant let you leave  
I need your love  
Inside of me  
You got control  
Control of me  
Hold it dont drop it dont drop it  
Stop it cant stop it wont stop it  
  
Chorus
