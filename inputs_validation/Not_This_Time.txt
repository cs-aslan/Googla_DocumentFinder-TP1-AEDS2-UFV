Oh with a mind that renders everything sensitive  
What chance do I have here  
Put an end put an end  
Put an end to every dream  
When youre near I fear you  
And I forget myself  
  
But not this time  
Not this time  
Not this time baby  
Not this time  
  
I dont know why I give in but I do every time  
And here I am wondering why I did it again  
Tooreeay tooreeo tooreeay tooreeo tooreeays what I say  
To keep me going  
To keep the shit away  
  
I dont know what it is  
But every time youre near I fear you  
And I forget myself  
  
No not this time baby  
Not this time you wont  
Not this time darling  
cmon we all sing  
  
Tooreeay tooreeo tooreeay tooreeo  
Tooreeay tooreeo tooreeay tooreeo  
Tooreeay tooreeo tooreeay tooreeo  
  
Not this time
