No one knows where she comes from  
Maybe shes a devil in disguise  
I can tell by looking in her eyes  
  
Little miss Strange  
Little miss Strange  
  
Little miss Strange came into my parlor  
I dont know just what to ask her  
I dont remember what we did after  
  
Little miss Strange  
Little miss Strange  
  
Little miss Strange came out of the darkness  
Walked across my head I stood beneath the light  
Im talkin bout the dream I had the other night  
  
Little miss Strange  
Little miss Strange
