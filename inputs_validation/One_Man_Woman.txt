Chorus  
Im a one man woman  
I want a one woman man  
Ive got two arms to hold him  
To love him all I can  
Now its a free world we live in  
Its this I understand  
  
But Im a one man woman  
I want a one woman man  
I dont need nobody  
  
Handing me those lines  
Saying I can keep my freedom  
In these modern times  
  
I want a ring on my finger  
For all the world to see  
And when I get home from working  
Hell be waiting here for me  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont want nobody  
Pulling me around  
Loving me then leaving  
For someone else downtown  
If he aint true and steady  
Then he aint in my plans  
Cause Im a one man woman  
I want a one woman man  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause Im a one man woman  
I want a one woman man
