Where the jungle trees are tall  
Grows a flower sweet to see  
Its a purdy flower they call Chincherinchee  
There a boy sang all day long  
To a maiden tenderly  
And he called her in his song Chincherinchee  
While the tom toms played  
He sang his serenade  
In the moonlight  
Sweet Chincherinchee youre divine  
Sweet Chincherinchee say youre mine  
Say youll be mine my whole life through  
Sweet Chincherinchee I love you  
Everyone will agree  
Shes as sweet as can be  
Shes so kissable and caressable Chincherinchee  
Everybody can see  
How exciting is she  
Shes embraceable irreplaceable Chincherinchee  
While the tom toms played  
He sang his serenade     
  
Every night they used to meet  
By a tall banyan tree  
Where he sang his heart to sweet Chincherinchee  
While the tom toms played  
He sang his serenade  
In the moonlight  
Sweet Chincherinchee youre divine  
Sweet Chincherinchee say youre mine  
Say youll be mine my whole life through  
Sweet Chincherinchee I love you  
Sweet Chincherinchee youre divine  
Sweet Chincherinchee say youre mine  
Say youll be mine my whole life through  
Sweet Chincherinchee I love you
