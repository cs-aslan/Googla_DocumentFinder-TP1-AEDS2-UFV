You know I look around at the world and I see all the beauty that God made I
see the forest and the trees and all the things and says in the Bible that he
made them is six days and I dont kn  
Theyre a literal six days or not scientists would say no some theologians
would say yes but I know that jesus christ has been preparing a home for me
and for some of you for two thousand years and if the world took six days
and that home two thousand years hey man this is like living in a garbage
can compared to whats going on up there  
  
Seaside sunset silver linings round the clouds  
  
Birds fly singing making such a joyful sound  
  
Thoughts of heaven somehow seem to fill my mind  
  
But I cant even imagine what it is Im gonna find  
  
I cant wait to get to heaven when youll wipe away all my fears  
  
In six days you created everything  
  
But youve been working on heaven two thousand years  
  
Deep green forests mountains reaching for the sky  
  
Grasslands and deserts your creation fills my eye  
  
Thank you thank you jesus though this beauty is just a taste  
  
Of all your glory Ill see when I pass through those gates  
  
I cant wait to get to heaven when youll wipe away all my fears  
  
In six days you created everything  
  
But youve been working on heaven two thousand years  
  
I cant wait to get to heaven when youll wipe away all my fears  
  
In six days you created all of the world  
  
But youve been working on heaven  
  
Youve been working on heaven holy spirit  
  
Youve been working on heaven two thousand years
