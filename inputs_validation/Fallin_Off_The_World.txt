Found on perspective  
Each time I call you I feel my heart beat  
I want to be there walkin up your street  
It doesnt matter how far I travel  
Crossin the ocean the golden gravel  
Im fallin off the world  
Im callin you do you believe  
Im fallin off the world  
Im callin you  
Tomorrows headline read all about it  
They caught the big one and I dont doubt it  
Across the country theyre paintin stories  
About our failures about our glories  
Im fallin off the world  
Im callin you do you believe  
Im fallin off the world  
Im callin you  
All of those screams of each other must share in the fight  
Nobody knows where their clear spirit goes in the night  
Out of the country it seems so easy  
To keep believin our dream of fiji  
Your image lingers a faded picture  
Your past erased by untold elixir  
Im fallin off the world  
Im callin you do you believe  
Im fallin off the world  
Im callin you  
All of those screams of each other must share in the fight  
Nobody knows where their clear spirit goes in the night  
Im fallin off the world  
Im callin you do you believe  
Im fallin off the world
