I like a woman with a future and a past  
A little attitude problem all good itll make the shit last  
Dont make it too easy girl dont take it too fast  
Yeah thats it right there thats it do it just like that  
Only you can do it just like that  
And I love it when your hair still wet cause you just took a shower  
Runnin on a treadmill and only eating salad  
Sound so smart like you graduated college  
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard  
Knowin you weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool  
Couple things due but you always get it done  
Might have been a time when I loved her too  
But you take that away and youll always be the one  
One I wonder why the moon look nice girl  
Maybe its just right for the night  
You said niggas coming on too strong girl  
They want you in their life as a wife  
Thats why you want to have no sex why you want to protest  
Why you want to fight for your right  
Cause you dont love them boys  
Pussy run everything fuck that noise  
  
Chorus  
I know things get hard but girl you got it girl you got it there you go  
Cant you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go  
Wondering whats on your mind it must be hard to be that fine  
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time  
Its just amazing girl and all I can say is  
Im so Im so Im so Im so Im so proud of you  
Im so Im so Im so Im so Im so proud of you  
Im so Im so Im so Im so Im so proud of you  
Everythings adding up youve been through hell and back  
Thats why youre bad as fuck and you  
  
Bbbbbet I am  
All of them bitches Im badder than  
Mansions in Malibu Babylon  
But I never mention everything I dabble in  
And I always ride slow when Im straddlin  
And my shits so wet you gotta paddle in  
Gotta rrrow gotta row ya boat  
Its Pink Friday Records and OVO  
Done did the pop tour Im the realest still  
The best legal team so the deals is ill  
Its MAC OPI and a fragrance too  
Apparel Im dominating every avenue  
Cobblestone good view little gravel too  
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too  
Cause Im flflfly Im flying high  
Aint got time to talk just hi and bye bitch  
  
But baby if you ask me to take a break  
Ill give it all away dont care what the people say  
Ill be a million billion trillion miles away  
  
He asked my sign I said a Sag  
Im a star sheriff badge  
Whats the point if Im guarding  
Double D up hoes Dolly Parton  
  
Chorus  
  
Im so Im so Im so Im so Im so proud of you  
Im so Im so Im so Im so Im so proud of you  
Im so Im so Im so Im so Im so proud of you  
Everythings adding up youve been through hell and back  
Thats why youre bad as fuck and you know you are
