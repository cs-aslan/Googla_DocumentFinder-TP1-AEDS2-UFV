Seems like such a long time since I held you in my arms  
And felt you close and warm beside me  
Another night is getting late and Im alone with just the ache  
And the memory of you inside me  
Darling Ive never been so blue  
Ive tried to see it through theres nothing I can do  
I wont make it on my own so wont you please hurry home  
Cause nothing seems to matter without you  
Last time I saw you there was nothing we could say  
We knew it was a time for a change  
A time to think you said that night and I lied and said All right  
And I left you in the morning I watched you in the window  
And Mexico will never be the same  
It was time to be apart but somehow it seems this heart of mine  
Will never find a way to live without you  
And now Im out here on the road and Im feeling bought and sold  
And tonight I just cant but think about you  
Darling Ive never been so blue  
Ive tried to see it through theres nothing I can do  
I wont make it on my own so darling wont you hurry home  
Because nothing seems to matter without you  
No nothing seems to matter without you
