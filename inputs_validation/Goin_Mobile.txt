And when I want to go home

Well Im gonna find a home  
And well see how it feels  
Goin mobile  
Keep me movin

I can make it on the road  
Goin mobile  
I can stop in any street  
And talk with people that we meet  
Goin mobile  
Keep me movin  
  
Out in the woods  
Or in the city  
Its all the same to me  
When Im drivin free the worlds my home  
When Im mobile

Make the toast and tea  
When Im mobile  
Well I can lay in bed  
With only highway ahead  
When Im mobile  
Keep me movin

Just a hippie gypsy  
  
Come on move now  
Movin
