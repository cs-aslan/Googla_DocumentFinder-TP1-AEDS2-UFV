The overhead view is of me in a maze  
And you see what Im hunting a few steps away  
And I take a wrong turn and Im on the wrong path  
And the people all watching enjoy a good laugh  
  
Embarrassed with failure I try to reverse  
The course that my tread had already traversed  
So doing the trauma engulfing my dream  
Invaded through what was an unguarded seam  
The torrent of helplessness swept me away  
To the cavern of shame and the hall of dismay  
Inside me a voice was repeating this phrase  
Youve lost it youll never get out of this maze  
  
Youll never get out of this maze  
Youll never get out of this maze  
Youll never get out of this maze  
Youll never get out of this maze  
Youll never get out of this maze  
Youll never get out of this maze  
Youll never get out of this maze
