She got the keys shes got the keys  
She got the keys whats she gonna do with the keys  
  
Im gonna lock my heart and throw away the key  
Im wise to all those tricks you played on me  
Im gonna turn my back on love gonna snub the moon above  
Seal all my windows up with tin so the love bug cant get in  
  
Im gonna park my romance right alone the curb  
Hang a sign upon my heart Please dont disturb  
And if I never fall in love again thats soon enough for me  
Im gonna lock my heart and throw the key  
  
Shes gonna lock her heart and throw away the key  
Gonna lock my heart  
Im wise to all those tricks youve played on me  
Shes gonna turn her back on love gonna snub the moon above  
Seal all my windows up with tin so the love bug cant get in  
  
Im gonna park my romance right alone the curb  
Hang a sign upon my heart Please dont disturb  
And if I never fall in love again thats soon enough for me  
Dont make it too soon  
Im gonna lock my heart  
Shes gonna lock her heart  
And throw away the key  
Shes gonna lock her heart and throw away the key
