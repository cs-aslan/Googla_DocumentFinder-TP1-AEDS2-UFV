I was your steppin stone  
I was your little dogs bone  
But now youve made it without me  
You know all about me  
And thats all right  
  
You cry  
The whole night long  
I try  
Loves right and wrong  
And now the suns sleepin through  
And its down on you too  
Its just not fair  
  
Now what is right is right  
And whats dones done  
But before you come round my door woman  
Gonna see where youre comin from  
Better count up your change  
And put a smile on your mind  
Before you want away for any more of my time  
I couldnt have loved you better  
I could have loved you worse  
I know what comes last baby  
And youve known it from the first  
  
I was your steppin stone  
I was your little dogs bone  
But now youve made it without me  
You know all about me  
And thats all right
