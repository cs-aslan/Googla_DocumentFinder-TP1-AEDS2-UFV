Shoop be doop  
Loves a funny thing  
  
Was only last night I felt you slip away  
I tried so hard to hide the pain inside of me babe  
I held you close but you werent with me  
I felt your mind a thousand miles away  
  
I was a fool to let you break me down  
You think by now that I would know  
Just what to expect from you oh  
Everytime I fall I make myself believe  
That you are changing  
And some day the sun will shine through  
  
Love is a funny thing  
Your love is a funny thing  
Love is a funny thing  
Oooh  
  
I dont wanna fall dont wanna fall in love again  
  
When I first met you your heart was empty  
You were innocent and so full of joy  
But now youve changed and I dont know you  
You played me baby like a toy  
  
You see I was surprised to see you with that girl  
When you said youd never ever ever ever see her again no  
I dont want to control you so baby if shes gonna hold you  
Then why dont you just stay stay where youve been  
  
Love is a funny thing  
Your love is a funny thing  
Love is a funny thing  
Oooh  
  
I never never wanna fall again no no no  
  
Everybody needs someone to hold them through the night  
And everybody needs someone to tell them its alright  
I gave you my heart and you only turned away  
So tell me baby whats going to make you stay  
  
Love is a funny thing  
Your love is a funny thing  
Love is a funny thing  
Oooh  
  
I never ever want to fall in love again
