Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
  
Give it a go why dont you choose me  
Say its not so that you rather lose me  
If youre disposed to say forget it  
You dont suppose you might regret it  
  
Give it a go lets make our break now  
Dont look down your nose or so Ill pick now  
For all we know theres not much time left  
If you give me a no you leave me be runt  
  
Im not saying that you cant find yourself someone better  
Oh no but in the meantime why not give it a go give it a go  
  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
  
Taken away shed all Ive got now  
Catch the bouquet lets tie the knots down  
A beautiful day youre smile has crowned  
If youre looking for love I think you found it  
  
Im not saying that you cant find yourself someone better  
Oh no but in the meantime why not give it a go  
You could be aiming for a cool time you know  
A real twin set up hello  
But in the meantime why not give me a go give me a go  
  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
Give it a go  
  
Im not saying that you cant find yourself someone better  
Oh no but in the meantime why not give it a go  
You could be aiming for a cool time you know  
A real twin set up hello  
But in the meantime why not give me a go give me a go  
  
Give it a go give it a go
