Night is falling  
Were doing the things we do  
You are acting just like me  
Im acting just like you  
Do you remember  
When you were my friend  
Thats the way Id like things  
Just like way back then  
  
Babys sleeping  
Brother is on the run  
I am out undoing  
All the good Ive done  
If you loved me  
Tell you what I would do  
Wrap the world in silver foil  
Bring it home to you  
  
Lately I feel  
That I cant pretend  
I may never ever see  
The likes of you again  
I take a walk I come back home  
Then I sit a spell  
Watch the ponies dance around  
The empty wishing well  
  
Night has fallen  
Ive said the things I did  
The only baby sleeping  
Is when I was a kid  
Do you remember  
When you were my friend  
Thats the way Id like things  
Just like way back then
