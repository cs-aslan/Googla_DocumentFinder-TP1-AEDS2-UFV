Bad news is come to town  
Hes walking  
Three feet off the ground  
Hes ordering another round  
Bound by his own ideas  
Lost doesnt know  
Where she is found  
  
Bad news is fighting mad  
He went and lost  
The biggest prize  
He ever had  
But a prizefighter  
Cant be sad  
When he smiles under  
Golden lights and lamps  
Taking daylight fights  
Again and again  
  
Bad news is come to town  
Hes walking  
Three feet off the ground  
Hes ordering another round  
Bound by his own ideas  
Lost doesnt know  
Where she is gone  
  
Bad news is fighting mad  
He went and lost  
The biggest prize  
He ever had  
But a prizefighter  
Cant be sad  
When he smiles under  
Golden lights and lamps  
Taking daylight fights  
Again and again  
  
Bad news is come to town
