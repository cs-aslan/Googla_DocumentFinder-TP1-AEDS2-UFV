Let me tell you a story from way back  
Truck on down and dig me Jack  
Theres Big Moe little biddy Moe four eyed Moe No Moe  
Look at brother look at brother look at brother  
Eat Moe  
  
Whos the greatest band around  
Makes the cats jump up and down  
Whos the talk of rhythm town  
Five guys named Moe thats us  
  
When they start to beat it out  
Everybody jumps and shouts  
Tell me who the critics all rave about  
Five guys named Moe  
  
We came out of nowhere  
And that dont mean a thing  
We rate high and youll know why  
When you hear us sing sing sing sing sing  
  
High brow low brow they all agree  
Were the best in harmony  
Im telling you folks you really ought to see  
Five guys named Moe  
  
We came out of nowhere  
And that dont mean a thing  
We rate high and youll know why  
When you hear us sing  
  
Were the greatest band around  
Make the cats jump up and down  
Were the talk of rhythm town  
Five guys named Moe  
  
Not one guy No Moe  
Not two guys little biddy Moe  
Not three guys four eyed Moe  
Not four guys Big Moe  
But five guys eat Moe  
Five little guys named Moe Moe Moe Moe Moe  
Thats us
