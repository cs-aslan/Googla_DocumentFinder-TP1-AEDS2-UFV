If you think youre gonna fail  
Well youre probably gonna fail  
So tell me what was all the dreaming for  
And if you think youre gonna lose  
Well youre probably gonna lose  
So whats the point in trying anymore  
  
What youre looking for youll find  
It happens every time  
  
Im not giving up  
Not giving up on you  
You can say youve had enough  
But I wont stop calling  
Im not giving up  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you  
  
When your fragile heart is breaking  
And your confidence is shaken  
I can tell you that weve all been there before  
The first step is hard to take  
But its a choice you gotta make  
When life is waiting through that open door  
  
I wish that you could see  
The way you look to me  
  
Im not giving up  
Not giving up on you  
You can say youve had enough  
But I wont stop calling  
Im not giving up  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you  
  
Oh not so long ago  
You pulled me through  
  
So Im not giving up  
Not giving up on you  
Even if the rain comes down  
And your sky is falling  
Im not giving up  
Not giving up on you  
You can say youve had enough  
But I wont stop calling  
Im not giving up  
Not giving up on you  
You know we can work this out  
If we just keep talking  
Im not giving up  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you  
  
Cause is you think you have a chance  
Then you really have a chance  
I hope you know that I believe in you
