Sail on down the line  
About half a mile or so  
Dont really want to know where youre going  
  
Maybe once or twice  
Time after time I tried  
To hold on to what we got  
But now youre going  
  
And I dont mind about the things youre gonna sail on  
I give all my money and my time  
I know its a shame  
But Im giving you back your name  
Yes Ill be on my way  
I wont be back to stay  
I guess Ill move along  
Im looking for a good time  
  
Sail on down the line  
Funny how the time can go  
Friends says they told me so but it doesnt matter  
It was plain to see  
That a small town boy like me  
Just wasnt your cup of tea  
I was wishful thinking  
I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy  
And you gave me nothing in return  
You know it aint so hard to say  
Would you please just go away  
Ive thrown away the blues  
Im tired of being used  
I want everyone to know  
Im looking for a good time  
Good time  
  
Sail on honey  
Good times never felt so good
