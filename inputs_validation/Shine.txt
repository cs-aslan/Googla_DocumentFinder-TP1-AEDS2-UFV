How long was I sleeping did you wake me didnt feel like all that long  
Do I see the morning no it cant be happen to me  
  
Ive been stuck in the quicksand more the pavement colours black and white
too long  
I could black out completely but I made me make my way back slowly  
  
Its my time to shine do it my way cuz its my time baby  
Its my time to burn start a fire be the one and only  
I said it  
I meant it  
I never will forget it  
Change never happens by itself  
Its my time to burn my time to shine  
Time to make it for myself  
  
How long was I buried couldnt find me laid to rest my heart beats on  
Kept track of the symptoms couldve killed me but you will see  
Im not broken I could be yeah you would be but my heart is much too strong  
Never thought it was easy but I made me I made me slowly  
  
Its my time to shine do it my way cuz its my time baby  
Its my time to burn start a fire be the one and only  
I said it  
I meant it  
I never will forget it  
Change never happens by itself  
Its my time to burn my time to shine  
Time to make it for myself  
  
Dont be sad I know you well its just the way it has to be  
I could never stay the same  
Its always high always low and almost never in between  
There is no one left to blame  
I cant stay  
I have to change  
  
Its my time to shine do it my way its my time baby  
Its my time to burn start a fire be the one and only  
I said it  
I meant it  
I never will forget it  
Change never happens by itself  
Its my time to burn my time to shine  
Time to make it for myself  
  
Make a choice shut up shut up  
Do it your way shut up shut up
