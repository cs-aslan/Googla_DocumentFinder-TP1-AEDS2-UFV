I once had a girl or should I say she once had me  
She showed me her room isnt it good norwegian wood  
  
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere  
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair  
  
I sat on a rug biding my time drinking her wine  
We talked until two and then she said Its time for bed  
  
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh  
I told her I didnt and crawled off to sleep in the bath  
  
And when I awoke I was alone this bird had flown  
So I lit a fire isnt it good norwegian wood
