Im sleepin an right in the middle of a good dream  
Like all at once I wake up  
From somethin that keeps knockin at my brain  
Before I go insane  
  
I hold my pillow to my head  
An spring up in my bed  
Screamin out the words I dread  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
  
This mornin I woke up with this feelin  
I didnt know how to deal with  
An so I just decided to myself  
Id hide it to myself  
  
An never talk about it  
An didnt I go and shout it  
When you walked into my room  
I think I love you  
I think I love you  
  
I think I love you  
So what am I so afraid of  
Im afraid that Im not sure of  
A love there is no cure for  
  
I think I love you  
Isnt that what life is made of  
Though it worries me to say  
That I never felt this way  
  
I dont know what Im up against  
I dont know what its all about  
I got so much to think about  
  
Hey I think I love you  
So what am I so afraid of  
Im afraid that Im not sure of  
A love there is no cure for  
  
I think I love you  
Isnt that what life is made of  
Though it worries me to say  
That I never felt this way  
  
Believe me  
You really didnt have to worry  
I only wanna make ya happy  
An if you say Hey go away  
  
I will  
But I think better  
Still Id better stay around an love you  
Do you think I have a chance  
  
Let me ask you to your face  
Do you think you love me  
I think I love you  
  
Do you think you love me  
I think I love you  
Do you think you love me  
I think I love you  
Do you think you love me  
I think I love you
