You took me for granted  
You took me you took me for granted  
But I landed back on my feet back on  
My feet  
Cause you dont deserve me deserve me  
You dont have the time that I need  
That I want I deserve  
But I got back my nerve  
Did what was right for me  
Im using my head not my heart  
And Im starting new  
Im going to get over you over you  
  
Im not important to you  
Im not important to you  
Im not important to you  
Im not important to you  
  
You happy is all I wanted to see is all  
I wanted to see to see  
And so now thats what  
Im going to be what Im going to be  
Ill waste some time on me  
I gave you my all and you took it  
I saw and you gave nothing back  
Your mind on another track  
Another track another track yeah  
There are plenty of people out there  
Who would care about me  
Youll see  
Youll see  
  
Im not important to you  
Im not important to you  
Im not important to you  
Im not important to you
