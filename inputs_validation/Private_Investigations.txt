Its a mystery to me the game commences  
For the usual fee plus expenses  
Confidential information its a diary  
This is my investigation its not a public inquiry  
  
I go checking out the reports digging up the dirt  
You get to meet all sorts in this line of work  
Treachery and treason theres always an excuse for it  
And when I find the reason I still cant get used to it  
  
And what have you got at the end of the day  
What have you got to take away  
A bottle of whiskey and a new set of lies  
Blinds on the window and a pain behind the eyes  
Scarred for life no compensation  
Private investigations
