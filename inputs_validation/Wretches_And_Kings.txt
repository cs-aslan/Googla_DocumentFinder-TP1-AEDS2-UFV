Theres a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious  
Makes you so sick at heart that you cant take part  
You cant even passively take part  
And youve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels  
Upon the levers upon all the apparatus  
And youve got to make it stop  
  
To save face how low can you go  
Talk a lotta game but yet you dont know  
Static on the wind makes us all say whoa  
The people up top push the people down low  
Get down and obey every word  
Steady get in line if you havent yet heard  
Wanna take what I got dont be absurd  
Dont fight the power nobody gets hurt  
If you havent heard yet then Im lettin you know  
There aint shit we dont run when the guns unload  
And no one make a move unless my people say so  
Got everything outta control now everybody go  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey  
  
Feel alone final blow  
We the animals take control  
Hear us now clear and tall  
Wretches and kings we come for you  
  
So keep face how slow can you go  
Talk a lotta shit and yet you dont know  
Fire on the wind makes you all say whoa  
The people up top and the people down low  
Get down and Im runnin it like that  
The front of the attack is exactly where Im at  
Somewhere in between the kick and the hihat  
The pen and the contract the pitch and the contact  
So get with the combat Im lettin them know  
There aint shit you can say to make me back down no  
So push the button let the whole thing blow  
Spinning everything outta control now everybody go  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey  
  
Feel alone final blow  
We the animals take control  
Hear us now clear and tall  
Wretches and kings we come for you  
Still alone fight our blow  
Filthy animals beat down low  
Steel and bone black and blue  
Run at the sunshine we come for you  
  
From the front to the back and to side to side  
If you feel what I feel put em up real high  
Front to the back and the side to side  
If you feel what I feel put em up real high  
Front to the back and the side to side  
If you feel what I feel put em up real high  
Front to the back and the side to side  
If you feel what I feel put em up real high  
Front to the back and the side to side  
If you feel what I feel put em up real high  
Front to the back and the side to side  
If you feel what I feel put em up real high  
  
When the operation of the machine becomes so odious  
Makes you so sick at heart that you cant take part  
You cant even passively take part  
And youve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels  
Upon the levers upon all the apparatus and youve got to make it stop  
And youve got to indicate to the people run in to the people on it  
And unless youre free the machine will be prevented from working at all  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
