When the rain  
Is blowing in your face  
And the whole world  
Is on your case  
I could offer you  
A warm embrace  
To make you feel my love  
  
When the evening shadows  
And the stars appear  
And there is no one there  
To dry your tears  
I could hold you  
For a million years  
To make you feel my love  
  
I know you  
Havent made  
Your mind up yet  
But I would never  
Do you wrong  
Ive known it  
From the moment  
That we met  
No doubt in my mind  
Where you belong  
  
Id go hungry  
Id go black and blue  
Id go crawling  
Down the avenue  
No theres nothing  
That I wouldnt do  
To make you feel my love  
  
The storms are raging  
On the rolling sea  
And on the highway of regret  
Though winds of change  
Are throwing wild and free  
You aint seen nothing  
Like me yet  
  
I could make you happy  
Make your dreams come true  
Nothing that I wouldnt do  
Go to the ends  
Of the Earth for you  
To make you feel my love
