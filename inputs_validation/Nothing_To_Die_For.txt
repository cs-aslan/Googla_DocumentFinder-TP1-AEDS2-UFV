Old enough to know better  
Too young to core  
Bent on self destruction  
Goin nowhere  
If I had a reason  
I could make it work for me  
If I had an answer  
  
I wouldnt be so hard to see  
Im feelin just the same  
Im feelin just no pain  
Im not goin down the drain  
  
Make my own decisions  
Just go away  
Take the consequences  
Just not today  
Got enough reasons  
Still not workin for me  
Got enough answers  
Still so hard to see  
Somethin is confusin me  
Somethin is abusin me  
Somethin is refusin me life  
  
Let me liveI want to give  
Ive been through hell and back  
So many times before  
Take me there  
I dont care where  
And show me why  
Theres nothin to die for too  
  
Old enough to know better  
Too dead to change  
Went in with a full deck  
Goin out deranged  
  
Thought I had a reason  
Tried it didnt work for me  
I had all the answers  
I was too blind to see  
Mirror man in my eye  
Mirror man make you cry  
Mirror man make you die
