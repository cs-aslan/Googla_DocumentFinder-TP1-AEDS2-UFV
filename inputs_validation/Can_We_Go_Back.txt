Youre complicating things  
I need some room to breathe  
I gotta get back to simplicity  
If you want more than this  
Then tell me what it is I gotta do  
Oh this is killing me  
I need you to see  
That somethings gotta change  
  
Can we go back to the way we used to be  
Back to the butterflies  
Staring deep in your eyes  
Can we go back to how we used to be  
Cause livin and lovin was easy  
We gotta find a way to fool reality  
And go back to the way we used to be  
  
When did we mess it up  
What happened to love  
We had it good  
But it wasnt enough  
We shouldnt let it fade all the way  
Were over thinkin this way too much  
I want you next to me  
But somethins gotta change  
  
Can we go back to the way we used to be  
Back to the butterflies  
Starin deep in your eyes  
Can we go back to how we used to be  
Cause livin and lovin was easy  
We gotta find a way to fool reality  
And go back to the way we used to be  
  
Oh can we go back  
  
No it doesnt have to be this hard  
And this isnt the way we are  
Our love was effortless  
Now its tearin us apart  
Oh Im getting tired of the fight  
We cant pretend that its alright  
Im slowly losing hope  
Baby can we try  
  
Can we go back to the way we used to be  
Back to the butterflies  
Starin deep in your eyes  
Can we go back to how we used to be  
Cause livin and lovin was easy  
We gotta find a way to fool reality  
And go back to the way we used to be
