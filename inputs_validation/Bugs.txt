All these  
I got bugs  
I got bugs in my room  
Bugs in my bed  
Bugs in my ears  
Their eggs in my head  
Bugs in my pockets  
Bugs in my shoes  
Bugs in the way I feel about you  
Bugs on my window  
Trying to get in  
They dont go nowhere  
Waiting waiting  
Bugs on my ceiling  
Crowded the floor  
Standing sitting kneeling  
A few block the door  
And now the questions  
Do I kill them  
Become their friend  
Do I eat them  
Raw or well done  
Do I trick them  
I dont think theyre that dumb  
Do I join them  
Looks like thats the one  
I got bugs on my skin  
Tickle my nausea  
I let it happen again  
Theyre always takin over  
I see they surround me I see  
See them deciding my fate  
Oh that which was oncewas once up to me  
Now its too late  
I got bugs in my roomone on one  
Thats when I had a chance  
Ill just stop now  
Ill become naked  
And with theIll become one
