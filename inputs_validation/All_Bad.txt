Verse  
Its another if it aint one thing  
Instigators like pouring fire on propane  
The wrong thing they be worried about  
Ooh you know females  
And how they like to run their mouths  
  
Wanna be wanna be just like talk like you  
like you you like you  
Misery misery best company  
Dont let them change your mood  
  
Chorus  
They try to get at me They try to get at me  
Behind your back your back your back  
Tryin to tell me that Im just like the others  
But I aint all bad  
  
No no I aint all bad  
All bad all bad  
I aint all bad  
All bad all bad  
  
I might make you mad so mad  
My bad no I aint all bad  
  
Verse 2  
Between us they wanna comment  
Your worst enemy some time be your best friend  
Perfect aint saying that I am  
Proven its proven I dont give a damn  
  
Wanna be wanna be everything I ought to be to you to you  
Envy envy same thing as jealousy  
Jealous of you  
Thats what they do  
  
Chorus  
They try to get at me They try to get at me  
Behind your back your back your back  
Tryin to tell me that Im just like the others  
But I aint all bad

All bad all bad  
I aint all bad  
All bad all bad

My bad no I aint all bad
