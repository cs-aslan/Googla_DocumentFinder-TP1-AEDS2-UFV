For the first time in such a long time  
Ive been feelin theres some reason  
To hold on through the night  
And for the first time since you broke this heart of mine  
I find myself believin  
Its really gonna be alright  
Now youre askin me to let you walk back into my life  
Something I cant bring myself to do  
  
Cause its been hard enough gettin over you  
Ya know you kept me holdin on till the end  
Oh its been hard enough gettin over you  
I dont think that I could say goodbye again  
I could trust you but its out of my hands  
  
I once believed your promises  
Believed in every word you said  
I still love you but my heart wont take the chance  
That all the pain Ive left behind me  
Might be waiting for me up ahead  
Just remember it was you who walked right out of my life  
  
No you dont know what Ive been through  
Cause its been hard enough gettin over you  
Ya know you kept me holdin on till the end  
Oh its been hard enough gettin over you  
I dont think that I could say goodbye  
  
I made a promise to myself  
And this one Im not gonna break  
  
Ive made it without you and Im not about to  
Just turn around and make the same mistake  
Cause its been hard enough gettin over you  
Ya know you kept me holdin on till the end  
Oh its been hard enough gettin over you  
  
I dont think that I could say goodbye  
I dont think I could say goodbye  
I know that I cant say goodbye again
