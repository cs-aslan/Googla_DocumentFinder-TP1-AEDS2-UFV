Josies gone now She cried a lot Had to go away And though I miss her I want
to kiss her Aint it just the way But its no way at all Cos if you knew what
Im goin Through youd know That theres one thing wrong With the way Im
living Aint got no Josie nomore Hey mr dream maker send me a dream This one
is over its not what it seamed And so tonight when I turn out the light Send
me a new dream tonight ooh She didnt say much Just a little touch And she
was on her way Ooh I could have cried then Instead I died then She left me
standing dazed But its no use crying Well thats what everybody Tells me and
they all seem to know That theres one thing wrong With the way Im living
Aint got no Josie nomore Hey mr dream maker send me a dream This one is
over its not what it seamed And so tonight when I turn out the light Send me
a new dream tonight ooh hey mr ooh hey mr hey mr dream maker mr dream

when I turn out the light Send me a new dream tonight aaahhh send me a new
