Eyebrows plucked and toenails cut  
Ill pick you up with a little luck all prim and proper  
Shaven legs and calls to Fred  
It all depends o alright then I can not stop her  
The makeup box has always got  
Ever such a lot of odds and sods in there to offer  
She needs paints to make her face  
And make her late again and again  
So Ill knock her  
The tick is tocker  
Mumbo jumbo words to say  
Are you coming out  
Coming out  
Coming out to play  
With a broken nose on a sunny day  
I would bet  
I would bet  
None of these girls would ever care  
Or get upset  
Or get upset  
  
Short and fat with a fishnet hat  
And a hungry cat in a nice new flat with her Scrabble  
Sits by the phone when shes all alone  
And on her own its a mental home full of babble  
Writes with charm to uncle farm  
With a broken arm in a broken barn feeds the cattle  
She hears the hens as she takes the pen  
And its now and now its then and now and then a little arab friend  
She would saddle  
The dip is dabbled  
  
Kissing curls and boyish girls  
For all the pearls in all the world wouldnt have me  
If I had oil and money to spoil  
Id mix with loyal and I get some royal little lassie  
Im up at nine down the line  
To watch the time till half past five  
I wish theyd sack me  
Shes at home the milkmans home  
To have a farm and seeds to sow  
It makes her happy  
The chip is chappie
