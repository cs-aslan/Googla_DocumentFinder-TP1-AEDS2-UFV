You think youre smart  
You broke my heart  
Left me to cry here alone but youll return  
One day youll learn  
The heart you break may be your own  
You promised me  
Your love would be  
A kind Id never known tho you werent fair  
Youre unaware  
The heart you break maybe your own  
You used my heart for a plaything  
Youll be sorry just wait and see  
One day youll find you are lonely  
And the first one youll think of is me  
Youll look around  
And when youve found  
That you are all alone then youll get wise  
And realize  
The heart you break may be your own  
You used my heart for a plaything  
Youll be sorry just wait and see  
One day youll find you are lonely  
And the first one youll think of is me  
Youll look around  
And when youve found  
That you are all alone then youll get wise  
And realize  
The heart you break may be your own
