Just a loud mouth Yankee I went down to Mexico  
I didnt have much time to spend about a week or so  
There I lightly took advantage of a girl who loved me so  
But I found myself athinkin when the time had come to go  
  
Chorus  
What am I doin hangin round  
I should be on that train and gone  
I should be ridin on that train to San Antone  
What am I doin hangin round  
  
She took me to the garden just for a little walk  
I didnt know much Spanish and there was no time for talk  
Then she told me that she loved me not with words but with a kiss  
And like a fool I kept on thinkin of a train I could not miss  
  
Chorus  
  
Well its been a year or so and I want to go back again  
And if I get the money well Ill ride the same old train  
But I guess your chances come but once and boy I sure missed mine  
And still I cant stop thinkin when I hear some whistle cryin  
  
Chorus
