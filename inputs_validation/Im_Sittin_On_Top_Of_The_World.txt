Sitting on the top of the world  
  
One summer day  
She went away  
She gone and left me  
She gone to stay  
But now she gone  
And I dont worry  
Cause Im sitting  
On top of the world  
  
Worked all the summer  
And worked all the fall  
I had to take my Christmas  
In my overall  
But now she gone  
And I dont worry  
Because Im sitting  
On top of the world  
  
Goin down to the freight yard  
Just to meet a freight train  
Im gonna leave this town  
Well its just got too hard  
But now she gone  
And I dont worry  
Cause Im sitting  
On top of the world  
  
One summer day  
She went away  
She gone and left me  
She gone to stay  
But now she gone  
And I dont worry  
Cause Im sitting  
On top of the world
