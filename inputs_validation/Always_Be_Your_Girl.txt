I listen to my heartbeat and I  
Try to follow where it leads me thats right  
I dont wake up in the shadows anymore  
I can finally breathe  
  
I dig a little deep down searching  
Took a little time to work it through  
But I found everything  
The day that I had you  
  
I once was the lost one  
Like a wayward child  
Now youre the light that leads the way  
  
I can melt the drops of freezing rain  
Ill fly in and save the day  
I will always try to make it  
Better than it was for me  
  
Youll always be the first one in my prayers  
Just close your eyes and I am there  
Its a better world  
Since youre my boy Ill always be your girl  
  
Im picking up all the pieces  
When I put em back together Im like new  
Cause my greatest wish  
Has already come true  
  
Well always be connected baby  
Like a button to a sleeve  
And this lullaby  
Will send you off to sleep  
  
Its hard to imagine  
My life before you  
Cause youre the light that leads the way  
  
I can melt the drops of freezing rain  
Ill fly in and save the day  
I will always try to make it  
Better than it was for me  
  
Youll always be the first one in my prayers  
Just close your eyes and I am there  
Its a better world  
Since youre my boy Ill always be your girl  
  
Ill be holding the wrap if you come on and fall  
There is love after love after all  
  
Well always be connected baby  
Youre like a button on my sleeve  
And this lullaby  oh  
  
I can melt the drops of freezing rain  
Ill fly in and save the day  
I will always try to make it  
Better than it was for me  
  
Youll always be the first one in my prayers  
Just close your eyes and I am there  
Its a better world  
Since youre my boy Ill always be your girl  
Your girl
