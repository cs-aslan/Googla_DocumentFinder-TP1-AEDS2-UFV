I wonder how we got like this  
Your heart wasnt mine to take  
Mine wasnt mine to give  
And love wasnt ours to save  
I shoulda let you when I could  
When the memories  
werent so many or so good  
And one night was such a small price to pay  
  
A small price to pay  
When a touch was all it was  
When the fire was just a candle flame  
Throwing shadows of us  
What I wouldnt give now  
For those long gone yesterdays  
When one night was such a small price to pay  
  
Well I guess wed better go  
Maybe this time for good  
But the last time wasnt though  
But never again sure feels good to say  
And I think back to the times  
When everything I treasured wasnt on this fragile mind  
And one night was such a small price to pay  
  
A small price to pay  
When a touch was all it was  
When the fire was just a candle flame  
Throwing shadows of us  
What I wouldnt give now  
For those long gone yesterdays  
When one night was such a small price to pay  
Back when one night was such a small price to pay
