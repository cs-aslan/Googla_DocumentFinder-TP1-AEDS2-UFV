Dont know what youve got  
Not till you lose it  
You had my love but you only abused it  
Ive had enough of all your excuses and lies  
  
You can look but dont you touch  
You played around girl much too much  
You had it all but you gave it up  
Its too late  
  
What you see is what you dont get  
You had your chance and then you blew it  
I was the one you never knew it  
Now its time to forget  
What you see is what you cant have  
Youre missing out and that is too bad  
I was the one who had the last laugh  
And all youve got is regret  
  
I made up my mind showed your true colors  
One of a kind No youre just like the others  
Im saying goodbye to all your excuses and lies  
And now theres nothing left to say  
So why are you standing in my way  
And dont go begging me to stay its too late  
  
What you see is what you dont get  
You had your chance and then you blew it  
I was the one you never knew it  
Now its time to forget  
What you see is what you cant have  
Youre missing out and that is too bad  
  
I was the one who had the last laugh  
And all youve got is regret  
What you see is what you dont get  
Are you a fool or have you got it yet  
You had it all and then you threw it all away
