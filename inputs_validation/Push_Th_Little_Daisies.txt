When you lie kiss your baby bye bye bye  
And if youre true the whole wide world will laugh with you  
When we see nothings wrong with you and me  
Time will tell it might even bring a wedding bell  
  
If you think that Im a loser  
Well you suck cause you know I aint nothin but a user  
Of your love I cant get enough  
Girl its true the whole wide world is smiling with you  
  
Push th little daisies and make em come up  
Push th little daisies and make em come up  
Push th little daisies and make em come up  
Push th little daisies and make em come up  
  
Sometimes I know and sometimes Im on the go  
But Im comin back so dont give me no flack yeah  
Its all you and its me too  
And its your world yous the girl yous the girl  
Happier than shit things that might go click with me  
Click with you is that love Is that love ohhh

Now just push th little daisies and make em come up  
Watch them grow watch them grow  
As I push the little daisies and make em come up  
Make em come up make em come up
