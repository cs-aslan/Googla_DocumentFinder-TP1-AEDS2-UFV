I can feel the earth begin to move  
I hear my needle hit the groove  
And spiral through another day  
I hear my song begin to say  
Kiss me where the sun dont shine  
The past was yours  
But the futures mine  
Youre all out of time  
  
I dont feel too steady on my feet  
I feel hollow I feel weak  
Passion fruits and holy bread  
Fill my guts and ease my head  
Through the early morning sun  
I can see her here she comes  
She bangs the drums  
  
Have you seen her have you heard  
The way she plays there are no words  
To describe the way I feel  
  
How could it ever come to pass  
Shell be the first shell be the last  
To describe the way I feel  
The way I feel  
  
Have you seen her have you heard  
The way she plays there are no words  
To describe the way I feel  
  
How could it ever come to pass  
Shell be the first shell be the last  
To describe the way I feel  
The way I feel  
  
Have you seen her have you heard  
The way she plays there are no words  
To describe the way I feel  
  
How could it ever come to pass  
Shell be the first shell be the last  
To describe the way I feel  
The way I feel
