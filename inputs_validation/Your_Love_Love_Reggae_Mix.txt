Josies on a vacation far away  
Come around and talk it over  
So many things that Id like to say  
You know I like my girls a little bit older  
I just want to use your love tonight  
I dont want to lose your love tonight  
  
I aint got many friends left to talk to  
Noones around when Im in trouble  
You know Id do anything for you  
Stay the night  well keep it under cover  
  
I just want to use your love tonight  
I dont want to lose your love tonight  
  
Try to stop my hands from shakin  
Somethin in my minds not makin sense  
Its been awhile since weve been all alone  
I cant hide the way Im feelin  
  
As you leave me please would you close the door  
and forget what I told you  
Just cause youre right  that dont mean Im wrong  
Another shoulder to cry upon  
  
I just want to use your love tonight  
I dont want to lose your love tonight  
Yeah  
I just want to use your love tonight  
I dont want to lose your love tonight  
Lose your love  
Lose your love  
Lose your love
