When youre down and troubled  
And you need a helping hand  
And nothing nothing is going right  
Close your eyes and think of me  
And soon I will be there  
To brighten up even your darkest night  
  
You just call out my name  
And you know wherever I am  
Ill come running to see you again  
Winter spring summer or fall  
All you have to do is call  
And Ill be there  
Youve got a friend  
  
If the sky above you  
Grows dark and full of clouds  
And that old north wind begins to blow  
Keep you head together  
And call my name out loud  
Soon youll hear me knocking at you door  
  
You just call out my name  
And you know wherever I am  
Ill come running to see you again  
Winter spring summer or fall  
All you have to do is call  
And Ill be there  
  
Aint it good to know that youve got a friend  
When people can be so cold  
Theyll hurt you and desert you  
And take your soul if you let them  
  
You just call out my name  
And you know wherever I am  
Ill come running to see you again  
Winter spring summer or fall  
All you have to do is call  
And Ill be there  
Youve got a friend  
Youve got a friend  
  
Aint it good to know youve got a friend  
Aint it good to know youve got a friend
