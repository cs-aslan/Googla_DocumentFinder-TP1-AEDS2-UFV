Sleepy town aint got the guts to budge  
Baby this emptiness has already been judged  
I want to go out tonight I want to find out what I got  
  
Youre a strange part of me youre a preachers girl  
And I dont want no piece of this mechanical world  
Got my arms open wide and my blood is running hot  
  
Well take the midnight road right to the devils door  
And even the white angels of Eden with their flamin swords  
Wont be able to stop us from hitting town in this dirty old Ford  
  
Well it dont take no nerve when you got nothing to guard  
I got tombstones in my eyes and Im running real hard  
My baby was a lover and the world just blew her away  
  
Once they tried to steal my heart beat it right outta my head  
But baby they didnt know that I was born dead  
I am the iceman fighting for the right to live  
I say better than the glory roads of heaven better off riding  
Hellbound in the dirt better than the bright lines of the freeway  
Better than the shadows of your daddys church  
Better than the waiting baby better off is the search
