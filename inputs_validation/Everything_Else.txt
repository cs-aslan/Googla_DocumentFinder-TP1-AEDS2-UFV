Natalie  
Mozart was crazy  
Flat fucking crazy  
Batshit I hear  
But his musics not crazy  
Its balanced its nimble  
Its crystalline clear  
  
Theres harmony logic  
You listen to these  
You dont hear his doubts  
Or his debts or disease  
You scan through the score  
And put fingers on keys  
And you play  
And everything else goes away  
Everything else goes away  
  
And you play til its perfect  
You play til you ache  
You play til the strings  
Or you fingernails break  
So youll rock that recital  
And get into Yale  
So you wont feel so sick  
And you wont look so pale  
Cause youve got your full ride  
And your early admit  
So youre done with this school  
And all of this shit  
And you graduate early  
Youre gone as of May  
And theres nothing your  
Paranoid parents can say  
  
And you know that its just  
A sonata away  
And you play  
And you play  
And everything else goes away  
Everything else goes away  
Everything else goes away
