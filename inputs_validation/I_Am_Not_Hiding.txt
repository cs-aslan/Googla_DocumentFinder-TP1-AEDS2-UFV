I was runnin from paradise  
Busy dancin across thin ice  
Then lookin up  
I thought somebody called my name  
But I kept on walkin on down  
On my own way  
  
I was livin but not enough  
Turnin my face  
From the face of love  
Then lookin up  
Im certain I saw your eyes  
And I dont know how  
And I dont know why  
But I know Im home  
  
Chorus  
I am not hiding  
This time Im deciding  
Now Im showin up  
To give it all my love  
I am not hiding  
Now Im standing here  
Shoutin out to heaven  
Runnin no more  
  
Freedom was overdue  
I was starvin for a dream  
And the dream was you  
Then lookin up  
Big love was pourin down  
N I dont know how  
N I dont know why  
But I know Im home  
  
Chorus  
  
The dream of love was more  
Than I could have  
Id almost given it up  
But darlin now its back  
  
I am here  
You are real  
This time Im learnin to feel  
I have found  
Paradise  
Showin up in your eyes  
  
This is all I know  
No more sad goodbyes  
Kiss it all hello  
Im showin up for my life  
  
Oh love is what its all about  
You gotta go in  
To get out  
  
For once in my life  
Ive found my home  
Home in your arms darlin  
All I know is that Im finally home  
Strong enough to see the truth  
You gotta go in  
To get out
