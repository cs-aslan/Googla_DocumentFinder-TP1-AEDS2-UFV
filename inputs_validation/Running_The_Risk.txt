Seeing you watching you  
Watching me  
I hold back my emotions  
I keep them veiled in secrecy  
I cant let go of this thing weve started  
Wasnt looking for love  
No conspiracy of the broken hearted  
I dont know how far to go  
Until Im gone gone gone  
  
I couldnt see the danger  
It was just a little taste of temptation  
I could not read the silence  
That was written on your face  
But here comes that feeling again  
  
And theres nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
Theres nothing more I can say  
Im still running the risk of you walking away  
  
Im lost drowning in a sea of emotion  
Ive got one simple need  
I need you to feel my devotion  
I dont know how far to go  
Until Im gone yeah gone  
  
Its a complicated picture  
Im all tangled up in temptation  
I couldnt read the silence  
That was written on your face  
But here comes that feeling again  
  
And theres nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
Theres nothing more I can say  
Im still running the risk of you walking away  
  
Im running the risk of losing you  
Im walking this tightrope  
Youre my only hope  
Theres nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
Losing you  
  
And theres nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
Theres nothing more I can say  
Im still running the risk of you walking away  
  
Im running the risk of losing you  
Im walking this tightrope  
Darling youre my only hope  
Theres nothing more I can do  
I keep running the risk of losing you  
Im running the risk of losing you  
  
Im telling you honey  
This heart of mine cant run the risk  
Of losing you again  
Everything have made you do  
Im still running the risk of losing you
