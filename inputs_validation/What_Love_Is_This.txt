You never change you are the God you say you are  
When Im afraid you calm and still my beating heart  
You stay the same when hope is just a distant thought  
You take my pain and you lead me to the cross  
  
What love is this that you gave your life for me  
And made a way for me to know you  
And I confess youre always enough for me youre all I need  
  
I look to you I see the scars upon your hands  
And hold the truth that when I cant you always can  
Im standing here beneath the shadow of the cross  
Im overwhelmed that I keep finding open arms  
  
What love is this that you gave your life for me  
And made a way for me to know you  
And I confess youre always enough for me youre all I need  
  
Jesus in your suffering you were reaching your thought of me  
Jesus in your suffering you were reaching your thought of me  
  
What love is this that you gave your life for me  
And made a way for me to know you  
And I confess youre always enough for me  
Youre all I need  
  
What love is this that you gave your life for me  
And made a way for me to know you  
And I confess youre always enough for me  
Always enough for me  
Always enough for me
