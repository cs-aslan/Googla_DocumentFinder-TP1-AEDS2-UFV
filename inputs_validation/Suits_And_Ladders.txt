I got manicured fingers and toes  
I got 4 layers of peesoaked clothes but Im still condescending  
Your as and teeth permanent browned  
Your face is permanently frowned and I have everything I want  
Your lifes gotta really suck  
You gotta hustle all day just to make the bucks  
To get high enough just to forget about what youve become  
Youre the one who lives nowhere  
You think youre lifes more than a game of suits and ladders  
When nothing really matters  
Youre not just fluous youre superfluous  
You dont actually do anything a human redundancy  
  
40 year old Macallans 40 Old English ounces  
Henry the IV double shot  
I just finished a bottle of Old Crow  
I just bought a case of Chateau Margaux not the 95 the 96  
Your house is of corrections  
Your house is full of collections of crap you bought from selling others out  
Youre the one who has nothing  
Your life is a game of unstable bladders when nothing really matters  
You woke up today covered in droppings stock or bird  
When the bottom drops my life wont change a bit but yours will turn to shit  
You are a superfluous man I am a superfluous man  
Youre quite a superfluous man I am a superfluous man
