Good morning good morning  
The church mouse is snoring  
News is out all over town  
Frankie fell in love  
  
Wake up boys wake up  
You drunken choir boys shake it up  
Our Juliet says her Romeos been found  
Frankie fell in love  
  
World peaces gonna break out  
From here on in were eating take out  
She aint gonna be cooking for the likes of us  
Somebody call mama and just tell her  
Frankie fell in love  
  
Einstein and Shakespeare  
Sitting having a beer  
Einstein trying to figure out the number that adds up to this  
Shakespeare said Man it all starts with a kiss  
  
Einstein is scratching  
Numbers on his napkin  
Shakespeare said Man its just one and one make three  
Ah thats why its poetry  
  
World peaces gonna break out  
From here on in were eating take out  
She aint gonna be cooking for the likes of us  
Somebody call mama and just tell her  
Frankie fell in love  
  
Glory glory its the same old story  
Kid there aint nothing anybody can do  
Its gonna happen to you just like  
Frankie fell in love  
  
Good evening good evening  
The church mouse is sleeping  
News is out all over town  
Frankie fell in love
