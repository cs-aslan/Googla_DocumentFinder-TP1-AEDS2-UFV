Listen good  
Dont cry for me  
Dont cry anymore  
  
Now just shut your mouth  
This point of view  
Appeals to me  
  
Listen babe  
Say youve got noone tonight  
  
Same old smile  
That cracked a thousand hearts  
But not mine  
  
Same old line  
Ive read the book  
And I know you well  
  
Listen babe  
Say youve got noone tonight  
  
Whats this feeling  
That I dont believe  
No concern on my face  
  
Whats it for  
You dream of something  
Like I dreamed of you  
  
Listen babe  
Say youve got noone tonight
