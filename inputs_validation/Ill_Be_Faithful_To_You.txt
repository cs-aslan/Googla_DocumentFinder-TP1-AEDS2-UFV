I can see your heart is aching  
She hurt you more than she knew  
Should you ever want to love again  
Ill be faithful to you  
  
Youve been crying like the willow  
When the night bird sings so blue  
Trust was broken but hearts will give  
And Ill be faithful to you  
  
In this world of pain and sorrow  
Where a promise dont hold true  
Heres a vow you can be sure of  
Ill be faithful to you  
  
So let me dry away your lonesome tears  
Like the sun melts morning dew  
And I will wrap you up in true true love  
Ill be faithful to you  
  
And I will wrap you up in true true love  
Ill be faithful to you
