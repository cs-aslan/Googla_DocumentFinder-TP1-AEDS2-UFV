Just beginning to take that love away  
Just beginning to take that love away  
In a minute Ill wash that love away  
Even now we remember what we used to say  
Takes a minute to wash that love away  
Take a clean break wash that love away  
  
Even now we remember what we used to say  
Even now we remember what we used to say  
Well be together if we wash that love away  
  
Whats tha matter   
Have to clean up   
Thats true  
Thats true  
And its taken  
To extreme extent  
Thats why we  
Work so hard to  
Take that love away  
Take that love away  
Take that love away  
Take that love away
