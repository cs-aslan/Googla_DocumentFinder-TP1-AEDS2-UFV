I remember the night you werent at home  
had to work late is what I heard  
Thats what you said  
I can never forget the way it felt  
You needed some time to work it out  
Thats what you said  
And now I feel a fool  
  
Cause late at night I call your name  
Im wondering what for  
Cause Ive seen those other guys  
Sniffin around your door  
  
Whatever happened to the words  
Lovers for all eternity  
Thats what you said  
I was your Romeo you were my Juliet  
Eternally  
Thats what you said  
And now I feel a fool  
  
Cause late at night I hear your voice  
Calling out my name  
Oh I know its just a dream  
But every nights the same  
  
I carried a torch for you through the thick and thin  
You know it dont seem right that I wont see you again  
No no  
  
Late at night I call your name  
Im wondering what for  
Cause I keep seeing those other guys  
Sniffin around your door  
  
I carried a torch for you through the wind and rain  
Ill never forget you but I wont see you again  
No no  
  
I thought your friends all liked me  
I thought I fitted in just right  
Thats what you said  
Soon Ill be gone and youll be free  
You can go find the things that you want  
Thats what you said  
And I wont feel a fool  
  
Cause late at night I still call your name  
Im wondering what for  
Cause I keep seeing those other guys  
Sniffin around your door  
  
What for
