Blackeyed Susan  
You make us nervous  
Because were very aware that you do not care  
  
Oh Blackeyed Susan  
What dont you believe in  
No is always easier than Yes  
Whoo   
  
Blackeyed Susan  
You must insist   
You are a bornagain atheist oh  
  
Oh heavyrings on  
Bitten fingers  
Blackeyed Susan sometimes  
Shakes to break  
So watch it  
  
Oh  
Blackeyed Susan  
Rest and do nothing  
Cause its the only thing that you do quite well  
Aah  
  
Blackeyed Susan  
Rest and do nothing  
Cause its the only thing that you do quite well  
Aah  
  
Blackeyed Susan  
Rest and do nothing  
Cause its the only thing that you do quite well  
Aah  
  
Blackeyed Susan  
Please remember  
We were the first  
We were the first  
Oh
