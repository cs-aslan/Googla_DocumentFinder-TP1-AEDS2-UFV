There you go slipping away into a state of grace  
I know the look that comes across your face  
Its so familiar to me  
Here I am trying to keep you in my line of sight  
Im never certain that you read me right  
Sometimes you dont want to see me  
  
Here we are both of us know were in love  
But that isnt always enough  
I never could rise above it all down I fall  
  
But darling there you go slipping away into a state of grace  
Granted this world is not a perfect place  
Still its the world that Im in  
Here I am talking while  
You dont hear a word I say  
Knowing youre watching me from far away  
Somewhere that Ive never been  
  
Dont you see you lived a different life than me  
It dont mean you have to be afraid of how  
Were not the same dont leave me now  
  
But darling there you go slipping away  
  
How can I get you to stay where you are  
Keep you from going too far  
Holding you here is so hard to do  
Im losing you  
  
And darling there you go slipping away into a state of grace  
Drifting away into your sacred place  
Someplace that Ive never been  
There you go slipping away slipping away into a state of grace  
There you go slipping away into a state of grace  
Yeah drifting away into that sacred place  
  
There you go slipping away
