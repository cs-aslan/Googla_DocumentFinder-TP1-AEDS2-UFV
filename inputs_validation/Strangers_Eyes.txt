All alone a rainy night  
No one around but I fell someone watching me  
I look around the street is bare nobody there  
I wonder what it could be  
As I turned to walk away  
Suddenly I saw his face  
Never minding that we were alone  
Didnt care about the time at the moment I was felling fine  
  
I was looking into strangers eyes  
he caught me by surprise  
They looked right through me  
he looking into my eyes  
Never knew  
Never ever thought that love could be  
thats when he came  
He came and captured me  
  
Like a scene out of a dream I cant believe it  
Kind of strange and familiar  
But in his eyes I get a sign I get a feeling  
I get the feeling he knows me  
Maybe I could stay a while maybe I could make you smile  
I dont have much to do  
Maybe we could walk awhile  
Maybe maybe we could talk awhile  
  
Cant help looking into strangers eyes  
I was looking into strangers eyes  
he caught me by surprise  
They looked right through me  
he looked into my eyes  
Never knew  
Never ever thought that love could be  
thats when he came  
He came and captured me  
  
How was I to know this would happen  
Thought I didnt know I would meet this stranger  
Its the kind of thing that dreams are made of  
And I keep thinking about strangers eyes  
I was looking into strangers eyes  
he caught me by surprise  
They looked right through me  
he looked into my eyes  
Never knew  
Never ever thought that love could be  
thats when he came to me  
He came and captured me
