If youre lovin me like Im lovin you  
Baby were really in love  
If youre happy with me like Im happy with you  
Old Cupid just gave us a shove  
If youre thinkin of me like Im thinkin of you  
Then I know what youre thinkin of  
If youre lovin me like Im lovin you  
Baby were really in love  
I run around in circles  
And turn in fire alarms  
Im nutty as a fruitcake  
When youre not in my arms  
If youre meant for me like Im meant for you  
Baby we fit like a glove  
If youre lovin me like Im lovin you  
Baby were really in love  
If youre lovin me like Im lovin you  
Baby were really in love  
If youre countin on me like Im countin on you  
Old Cupid just gave us a shove  
If youre dreamin of me like Im dreamin of you  
Then I know what youre dreamin of  
If youre lovin me like Im lovin you  
Baby were really in love  
My folks think Ive gone crazy  
And I dont feel too sure  
And yet theres nothin wrong with me  
That weddin bells wont cure  
If you go for me like I go for you  
Baby we fit like a glove  
If youre lovin me like Im lovin you  
Baby were really in love
