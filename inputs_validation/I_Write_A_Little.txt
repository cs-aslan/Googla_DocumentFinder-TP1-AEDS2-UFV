I lay out some paper I take out my pen  
Turn on my table lamp and here I go again  
Its time to write a letter Im in the mood tonight  
Gotta find a way to tell you how I feel inside  
  
So I write a little  
And I cry a little  
Its so hard to find a way  
To say goodbye a little  
But somewhere in the middle  
My emotions interfere  
So I write it a little  
And cry a little tear  
And Ive died a little  
Wishing you were here  
  
God I miss you  
Cant be with you  
I would kiss you oh so good  
Cause youre my only cure for lonely  
Id call if I could  
  
Well Ive died a little  
Wishing you were here  
Wishing you were here  
Well Im writing a little  
And wishing you were here  
And I write a little  
And I cry a little tear  
And Im writing  
And wishing you were here
