I thought you said  
Youd bring home the groceries  
I thought you said youd fill up the tank  
I thought you said youd pull out for me  
A hundredfifty dollars from the bank

I thought you said  
Youd bring me some flowers  
You came home with nothing  
You dirty rat fink  
I thought you said youd  
Clean up the living room  
You said youd do the dishes in the sink  
  
Im sick and tired of your childish behavior  
Youre always coming home completely soused  
Im sick and tired of this shoebox apartment  
When are you going to buy me a house
