Setting sun deals hands of gold  
Theres velvet eyes in Mexico  
Just a fall away  
And all she said was true  
  
Speak in tongues speak in lies  
Drooling livers born to die  
Its a wonder that those guns dont point at you  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Chorus x2  
Keep sayin go on  
Keep sayin go on  
Keep sayin  
You wont live forever  
  
Point and shoot I know just what you mean  
In a world thats full of shit and gasoline baby  
One dogs dead ones on the phone  
Just leave a lung or leave it alone  
Its that same on song again  
I hate it cause its true  
  
Oh oh oo oo  
  
Chorus x2
