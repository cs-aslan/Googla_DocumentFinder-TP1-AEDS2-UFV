I feel a surge coming over me  
I feel it all around my thighs  
And chills going up my legs  
This is the worst coming out of me  
When I cant tell felt like I could die yeah  
And it sends chills up my spine  
  
Yourre sexy sexy  
I got things I want to do to you  
Make me make me  
Make my tongue just go dododo  
Flex it flex it  
Flex your muscles and through the roof  
Arrest it rest it  
Cause youre a criminal  
  
I been laying in this bed all night long  
Dont you think its time to get it on  
But we gotta get it right we cant get it wrong  
Dont you want to feel this fire before its gone yeah yeah  
  
I feel the thirst pouring out of me  
For things that I wanna try  
That echoes in my head  
This is the first time I get to see  
Things Ive never seen in my life yeah  
You make flowers grow under my bed yay  
  
Yourre sexy sexy  
I got things I want to do to you  
Make me make me  
Make my tongue just go dododo  
Flex it flex it  
Flex your muscles and through the roof  
Arrest it rest it  
Cause youre a criminal

Dont you think its time to get it on yeah  
But we gotta get it right get it right we cant get it wrong cant get it

Feeling right back home when Im in your arms  
You played my strings like my guitar  
When I look in your eyes I see all the stars  
  
Would you believe
