Been hidin out  
And layin low  
Its nothing new ta me  
Well you can always find a place to go  
If you can keep your sanity  
They break down the doors  
And they rape my rights but  
They wont touch me  
They scream and yell  
And fight all night  
You cant tell me  
I lose my head  
I close my eyes  
They wont touch me  
Cause I got somethin  
I been buildin up inside  
For so fuckin long  
  
Theyre out ta get me  
They wont catch me  
Im fucking innocent  
They wont break me  
  
Sometimes its easy to forget where youre goin  
Sometimes its harder to leave  
And every time you think you know just what youre doin  
Thats when your troubles exceed  
They push me in a corner  
Jest to get me to fight but  
They wont touch me  
They preach and yell  
And fight all night  
You cant tell me  
I lose my head  
I close my eyes  
They wont touch me  
Cause I got somethin  
I been buildin up inside  
  
Theyre out ta get me  
They wont catch me  
Im innocent  
They wont break me  
  
Some people got a chip on their shoulder  
And some would say it was me  
But I didnt bey that fifth of whiskey  
That you gave me  
So Id be quick to disagree  
  
Theyre out ta get me  
They wont catch me  
Im innocent  
They wont break me  
  
Theyre out ta get me  
They wont catch me  
Im innocent  
So you can  
Suck me  
Take that one to heart
