Another bride Another June  
Another sunny honeymoon  
Another season Another reason  
To make whoopee  
  
A lot of shoes a lot of rice  
The groom is nervous uhh he answers twice  
Its really killin the boys so willin  
To make whoopee whoopee  
  
Picture a little love nest yeah  
Down where the roses cling  
Picture that same sweet love nest  
See what a year can bring  
  
I tell you the boys washin dishes n baby clothes  
Hes so ambitious ooh I tell you he sews  
Its really killin the boys so willin  
To make whoopee whoopee  
  
You see I dont make much money  
Only five uhuh thousand per  
And some judge who thinks hes funny  
Tells me I got to pay six to her  
  
I said now judge suppose I fail  
The judge says Ray son son right on into jail  
Ah you better keep her I think its cheaper  
  
spoken You know what Ive been doin dont you  
crowd goes wild
