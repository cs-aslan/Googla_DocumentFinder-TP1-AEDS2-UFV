I heard about a man walking on the water  
He had hope in his eyes  
He didnt wear a crown or have any money  
He didnt have any lies  
  
He had holes in his pockets  
He had holes in his hands  
He looked like an outlaw talking to his lover  
  
He was a spiritual man  
  
I wanna be a prince not a king or a warrior  
I wanna have a special light in my eyes  
Wanna climb up a mountain find a tree of wisdom  
I wanna feel good when I cry  
  
And maybe someday I could be a teacher  
I want that karma when you touch my hand  
Ill walk through the streets  
Talking to the homeless in winter  
  
I wanna be a spiritual man yeah  
  
I heard about a man who was born in the desert  
He rode for days and nights across the sand  
And one day he came upon an angel  
The angel said Hey you youre gonna be a spiritual man  
  
Last night I saw a man walking toward a club in Harlem  
He had a black case in his hands  
Went through the back door and pulled out his gold companion  
He closed his eyes and played all night like a selftaught spiritual man
