Great expectations I have to find  
I want to tell you what it was like  
My recollection is not too clear  
So much hope and so much fear  
  
Long conversations into the night  
Not like that oh no not so black and white  
The great temptations to try and please you  
Play with you thought and mind and tease you  
If I could tell my story in a song  
Id have to make it fast yes its very long  
Many shades of gray between the right and wrong  
  
Day for night night for day  
All the stories on this way  
Feel the fire burn away  
  
So turn the lights down low come over here  
Stay with me dont go youll see my characters appear  
The storytellers magic doesnt lie  
Hell make you laugh to make you cry  
Real for me is real for you  
What I say is almost true  
  
Day for night night for day  
All the stories on its way  
Feel the fire burn and play  
  
The storys ended now youre on your own  
Lets say a little prayer go home
