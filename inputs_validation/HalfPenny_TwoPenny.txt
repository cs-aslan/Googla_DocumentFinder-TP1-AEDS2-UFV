Half penny two penny gold Krugerrand  
He was exceedingly rich for such a young man  
Sad story old story  
Bring out the band  
Another divorce just a few hundred grand  
  
Half penny two penny back of the queue  
Yes mister poor man this means you  
Justice for money what can you say  
We all know its the American Way  
  
Yes Im gonna shake myself loose  
Back home across the sea  
Where I know that I will be free  
  
Half penny two penny back in the States  
You just couldnt take that African pace  
Yes Mrs Cleaver your sons home to stay  
We all know its the American Way  
  
Yes Im gonna shake myself loose  
Back home across the sea  
Where I know that I will be free  
  
Come here  hey Angelo whats happenin  
Hey Stosh good to see ya  
What the hell you doin  
Were tearing this old building down here  
Oh youre kiddin me Remember when we were kids and we used to come here
every Saturday afternoon to see a cartoon  
Yeah I remember  
Well whats she lost to  
Who knows politicians taxesits a disgrace  
Im not surprised they make me sick They dont make theaters like this any
more  
  
Half penny two penny ashes to dust  
The almighty dollar says In God we trust  
Justice for money how much more can I pay  
We all know its the American Way  
  
Yes Im gonna shake myself loose  
Back home across the sea  
Where I know that I will be free  
I want to be free  
  
Yes Im gonna shake myself loose  
Back home across the sea  
Where I know that I will be free  
We all want to be free
