The future needs a big kiss  
Winds blow with a twist  
Never seen a moon like this  
Can you see it too  
  
Night is falling everywhere  
Rockets hit the funfair  
Satan loves a bomb scare  
But he wont scare you  
  
Hey Sexy boots  
Get on your boots yeah  
  
Free me from a dark dream  
Candy floss ice cream  
All the kids are screaming but the ghosts arent real  
Heres what we gotta be  
Love and community  
Laughter is eternity if joy is real  
  
You dont know how beautiful  
You dont know how beautiful you are  
You dont know  
You dont get it do you  
You dont know how beautiful you are  
  
If some have stuff to blow it up  
Well we are into growing up  
Women are the future  
All the big revelations  
I got a submarine  
Youve got gasoline  
I dont wanna talk about wars between nations  
Not right now  
  
Sexy boots  
No no no no  
Get on your boots yeah  
Not right now  
Foxy boots  
  
You dont know how beautiful  
You dont know how beautiful  
You are  
You dont know  
You dont get it do you  
You dont know how beautiful you are  
  
Sexy boots  
I dont wanna talk about wars between the nations  
Sexy Boots yeah

Let me in the sound  
Let me in the sound sound

Oh God Im going down  
I dont wanna drown now
