Everyone asks  
Are we some kind of lovers  
Everyone asks what youre doing with me  
I know this is not what they want  
Theyre afraid youve been blinded  
But I already know how its going to be  
If anyone should ask  
Say were mated  
For as long as this life lasts  
We are mated  
Why else would you be here right now  
And you know well still be here tomorrow  
Nobody else understands what Im doing  
Nobody else makes me act in this way  
And because they cant comprehend  
What we mean to each other  
They wont leave you alone  
So you know what to say  
I hold you in my heart  
Cause were mated  
In a very special part  
We are mated  
Why else would I be here right now  
And you know Ill still be here tomorrow  
I see things far ahead maybe light  
Maybe beautiful children  
I dont have words Im thinking of  
But its way beyond what they call love
