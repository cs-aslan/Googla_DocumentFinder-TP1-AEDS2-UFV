 feat Lani misalucha recorded by regine velasquez for kris aquinos album   
  
Many nights weve prayed  
With no proof anyone could hear  
In our hearts a hopeful song  
We barely understood  
  
Now we are not afraid  
Although we know theres much to fear  
We were moving mountains long  
Before we knew we could oh yes  
  
There can be miracles when you believe  
Though hope is frail its hard to kill  
Who knows what miracles you can achieve  
When you believe somehow you will  
You will when you believe oh yeah  
  
In this time of fear  
When prayers so often prove in vain  
Hope seems like the summer birds  
So swiftly flown away  
  
Yet now Im standing here  
My hearts so full I cant explain  
Seeking faith and speaking words  
I never thought Id say  
  
There can be miracles when you believe When you believe  
Though hope is frail its hard to kill  
Who knows what miracles you can achieve You can achieve  
When you believe somehow you will  
You will when you believe  
  
They dont always happen when you ask  
And its easy to give in to your fears oh  
But when your blinded by your pain  
Cant see your way straight through the rain  
A small but still resilient voice  
Says love is very near Yeah Yeah  
  
There can be miracles miracles  
When you believe lord when you believe oh ho  
Through hope is frail through hope is frail  
Its hard to kill its hard to kill oh oh  
Who knows what miracles you can achieve  
When you believe ooh ooh  
Somehow you will  
Somehow you will  
You will when you believe  
  
You will when you believe  
Just believe Just believe oh yeah  
You will when you believe
