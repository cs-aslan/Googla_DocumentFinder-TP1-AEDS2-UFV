Intermediate  
Nobody makes me feel the way that you do  
Night times such a thrill when I spend it with you  
Ask me what is on my mind  
So I can tell you true  
  
Aint no big deal  
My love is for real  
I love you still  
Aint no big deal  
My love is for real  
Aint no big deal  
I love you still  
Aint no big deal  
My love is for real  
Baby I love you still  
Aint no big deal  
My love is for real  
Aint no big deal  
Uh uh uh uh uh  
Aint no big thing

Aint no big deal
