I watch a man sitting down the park  
The flashy suit manufactured by the makers  
Hes got a pen and he circles an add  
It makes him laugh cause hes reading dirty papers  
  
26580  
  
She doesnt know but shes getting his call  
Hes talking straight but he wants it in a strange way  
She combs her hair doesnt worry at all  
He could be mad but its just another pay day  
  
26580  
26580  
26580 Oh dial it if you want to know me  
  
She likes to live on the poor side of town  
Shes shacking down with a guy from West Guiana  
The boys around always look at the ground  
Oh what theyd give for a night with that piranha  
  
26580  
26580  
26580 Oh dial it if you want to know me  
  
She doesnt have to make her money that way  
Shes such a pretty young girl  
I guess they love it cause you hear when they stay  
They cry oh oh oh  
  
This guy arrives looking scared as a rat  
He needs her love but he wants it like a brother  
Three hours later he crawls out on his knees  
Shes laughing loud cause hes calling for his mother  
  
26580  
26580  
26580 Oh dial it if you want to know me  
  
26580  
26580  
26580 Oh dial it if you want to know me
