BCockburn  
  
Suns up mm hmm looks okay  
The world survives into another day  
And Im thinking about eternity  
And this ecstasys got a hold on me  
Yeah I had another dream about lions at the door  
They werent half as frightening as they were before  
Im thinking about eternity  
Some kind of ecstasys got a hold on me  
Walls windows trees waves coming through  
Youll be into me and Ill be into you  
Together in eternity  
All this ecstasys got a hold on me  
And Im wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Im wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Big orange flying boat rises off the lake  
Thousandyearold dinosaur doing a double take  
Pointing a finger at eternity  
Im sitting here in the middle of this ecstasy  
Last night again there where lions at the door  
But I wasnt frightened like I was before  
Thinking about eternity  
And the ecstasy thats got a hold on me  
And Im wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Im wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Im wonderin  
  
Solo  
  
Freighters on the nod on the surface of the bay  
One of these days were going to sail away  
Sail into eternity  
All this ecstasys got a hold on me  
And Im wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Tell me where the lions are  
Wonderin where the lions are  
Tell me where the lions are  
Tell me where the lions are  
Tell me where they are  
I wanna know  
Where the lions are
