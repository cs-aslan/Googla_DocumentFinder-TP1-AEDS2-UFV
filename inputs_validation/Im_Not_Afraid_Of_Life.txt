I am not afraid of life  
Of the poor mans struggle  
Of the killers knife  
I am not afraid of life  
Of an insane rage  
Of the minimum wage  
I am not afraid of life  
  
I am not afraid of life  
I am not afraid of life  
  
But I see an old lady with a shopping bag  
And I wonder is life a drag  
  
I am not afraid of pain  
But it hurts so bad  
I feel so mad  
No one see the truth  
Theres nothing to gain  
A life goes down the drain  
Dont want to die at an early age  
  
I am not afraid of life  
I am not afraid of life  
  
But I see a street crazy shivering with cold  
Is it a crime to be old  
  
Theres the threat of the nuclear bomb  
We know its wrong  
We know its wrong  
Is there a chance for peace  
Will the fighting ever cease  
Mankinds almost out of luck  
A maniac could blow us up  
  
I am not afraid of life  
I am not afraid of life  
  
But I get down on my knees and I pray  
Is there hope for the world today
