Just when I wake up and baby you call  
Youre driving my mind up the side of a wall  
Im giving you my best now Im begging you please  
Im not in the mood to see you on your knees  
Sayin you wont run on the street again  
Sayin you will come back runnin back again  
Saying you wont buy on the street again  
Sayin you will come runnin back again  
But you better not call me  
Youd better not cry  
Youd better not wake me up in the morning  
Just a tellin me lies  
No you had better not call  
I used to call her  
Call  
I used to call her  
Just when Im knocked out and baby you call  
I look in your eyes and youre not there at all  
Sayin you wont run on the street again  
Sayin you will come back runnin back again  
Saying you wont buy on the street again  
Sayin you will come runnin back again  
But you had better not call me  
Youd better not cry  
Youd better not wake me up in the morning  
Just a tellin me lies  
No you better not call me  
Youd better not cry  
Youd better not wake me up in the morning  
Just a tellin me lies  
No you had better not call  
I used to call her  
Call  
I used to call her  
Sayin you wont run on the street again  
Sayin you will come back runnin back again  
But you better not call me  
Youd better not cry  
Youd better not wake me up in the morning  
Just a tellin me lies  
But you better not call me  
Youd better not cry  
Youd better not wake me up in the morning  
Just a tellin me lies  
No you had better not call  
I used to call her  
Call  
I used to call her
