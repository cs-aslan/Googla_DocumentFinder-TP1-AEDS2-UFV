Pasolini is me  
Accattone youll be  
I entered nothing and nothing entered me  
Till you came with the key  
And you did your best but  
  
As I live and breathe  
You have killed me  
You have killed me  
Yes I walk around somehow  
But you have killed me  
You have killed me  
  
Piazza Cavour  
Whats my life for  
  
Visconti is me  
Magnani  
Youll never be  
  
I entered nothing and nothing entered me  
Till you came with the key  
And you did your best but  
  
As I live and breathe  
You have killed me  
You have killed me  
Yes I walk around somehow  
But you have killed me  
You have killed me  
  
Who am I that I come to be here  
  
As I live and breathe  
You have killed me  
You have killed me  
Yes I walk around somehow  
But you have killed me  
You have killed me  
  
And there is no point saying this again  
There is no point saying this again  
But I forgive you  
I forgive you  
Always I do forgive you
