Now if you feel that you cant go on  
Because all of your hope is gone  
And your life is filled with much confusion  
Until happiness is just an illusion  
And your world around you is crumblin down  
Darling reach out darlin reach out for me  
  
Chorus  
Ill be there  
To give you all the love you need  
And Ill be there  
You can always count on me  
  
When you feel lost and about to give up  
Cause your best just aint good enough  
And you feel the world has grown cold  
And youre driftin out all on your own  
And you need a hand to hold  
Darlin reach out darlin reach out for me  
  
Ill be there  
With the love that will shelter you  
Ill be there  
With all the love that will see you through  
  
Chorus  
  
I can tell the way you hang your head  
Youre without love and now youre afraid  
And through your tears you look around  
But theres no peace of mind to be found  
I know what youre thinkin youre alone now  
No love of your own  
But darlin reach out  
Darlin reach out for me  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill be there  
With the love that will shelter you  
Ill be there  
With the love that will see you through
