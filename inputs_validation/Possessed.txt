Got tired of being gifted and tormented  
Signed sealed delivered then resented  
I think Ive lost a very nice part of me  
And even though Im only half the man I used to be  
It feels good  
Im flying high again  
Spinning round and round again  
I even like myself again  
Im not exactly sure of what Im after  
But I wont be happy until I get it  
Im either innocent or just plain stupid  
Whats the betting Ill regret it  
But it feels good  
Feels like Im home again  
Feeling safe and sound again  
I even like myself again  
And it feels good  
Im flying high again  
Spinning round and round again  
Ill never touch the ground again  
Feels like Im swimming in a sea of beauty  
Feels like Im going round the bend  
God defend me from my enemies  
God defend me from my friends  
Cos it feels good  
Im flying high again  
Spinning round and round again  
I even like myself again  
And it feels good possessed  
Im coming home again possessed  
Feeling safe and sound again possessed  
Ill never touch the ground again possessed  
Cos  
It feels good
