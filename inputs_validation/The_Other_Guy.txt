Verse  
I know Ill never have him  
But Im there when youre not over his friend  
I listen when you come to me  
But cause of who he is you dont have the time to see  
  
I really feel the way you feel  
Just cause its him dont mean its not real  
Your always sayin your loves true  
I listen but I cant say the same for you  
  
Bridge  
What I offers unreturned  
You dont have time to see me burn  
Youve so far failed to see  
How much youre affecting me  
  
Chorus  
When you think of him  
Im thinkin of the other guy  
Im in love to  
Hes constantly on my mind  
If you werent shared by blood  
Then would you have the time  
I dont get to choose  
Who I dream of at night  
You tell me how you feel  
I feel the same way with the other guy  
So bad its not real  
You cant make me cover it up you know I really try  
You can see by my skin  
I shiver and shake and I follow him with my eyes  
Im nervous and I know its a sin  
But seein him drives me wild inside  
  
Verse 3  
If it was another  
Maybe not your brother  
Would it be ok to let him drive me wild  
But then lookin back  
Youve always turned your back  
Would it be ok to listen to my smile  
  
Verse 4  
Your convinced  
Hes so unperfect  
But Im convinced  
That its worth it  
  
I listen to you goin on and on  
Bout how you and that boy got it on  
You dont have time to listen to me  
Im in love but you cant see  
I dont have opinions you just talk  
But with me you tell me Im stupid to feel what I feel  
I cant run away you only let me walk  
Come on now girl you aint bein real
