Long ago far away  
I felt your lovin glow upon my face  
Was it a dream or just a promise made  
What is my destiny  
Someday Ill find a way to shine  
Leave all these rainy days behind  
I know theres got to be  
Some place warm and bright for me  
Im runnin out of places I can run  
Lookin for a place in the sun  
Darkness hangs overhead  
Close to the point where angels fear to tread  
I close my eyes and think of you instead  
And pray youll be here soon  
Someday Ill find a way to shine  
Leave all these rainy days behind  
I know theres got to be  
Some place warm and bright for me  
Im runnin out of places I can run  
Lookin for a place in the sun  
Sometimes it feels like this whole worlds against me  
And every beaten path is just another winding road  
That tempts me far from you and all thats true  
Ive got to find my way again  
Someday Ill find a way to shine  
Leave all these rainy days behind  
I know theres got to be  
Some place warm and bright for me  
Im runnin out of places I can run  
Lookin for a place in the sun  
Im runnin out of places I can run  
Lookin for a place in the sun  
Just shine down on me sunshine
