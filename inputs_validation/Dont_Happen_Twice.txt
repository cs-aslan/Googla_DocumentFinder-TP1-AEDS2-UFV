I havent seen you in forever  
You havent changed a bit  
You didnt think that Id remember  
But how could I forget  
  
We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car  
Made a wish on every star  
In that clear September sky  
One bottle of wine two Dixie cups  
At three am I fell in love  
For the first time in my life  
And thats somethin  
That just dont happen twice  
  
To this day I still taste that first kiss  
How I prayed it wouldnt end  
In a way seeing you like this  
I guess it never really did  
  
We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car  
Made a wish on every star  
In that clear September sky  
One bottle of wine two Dixie cups  
At three am I fell in love  
For the first time in my life  
And thats somethin  
That just dont happen twice  
  
One bottle of wine two Dixie cups  
At three am I fell in love  
For the first time in my life  
And thats somethin  
That just dont happen twice  
  
Thats somethin baby thats somethin  
Oh thats somethin  
That just dont happen twice
