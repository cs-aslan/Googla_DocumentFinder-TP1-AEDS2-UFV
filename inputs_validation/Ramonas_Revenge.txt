Ramona lived just down the hill from us  
She kept the house ger mother drove the bus an old yellow school bus  
Ramona had a handicap the neighborhood knew well  
Ramona couldnt speak or couldnt spell and that left Ramona at a  
  
Considerable disadvantage among the more fluent  
Although she couldnt write or couldnt talk  
Ramona really had a pretty walk a four letter figure  
Because she couldnt write or speak nobody asked her out  
  
But badeye Thompson hung around the house he was what youd call a  
Familiar figure in the neighborhood  
Well I guess their handicaps were common ground  
Cause badeye Thompson always hung around  
  
He could squint that eye and spit tobacco thirty feet  
Ramona always grinned and stomped her featbecauseto Ramona this was one of  
The finer things in life  
One day Ramona found herself with child  
  
She couldnt speak Her mom was going wild  
Confusion reigned for half a day as one could understand  
The county judge came down to lend a hand and I think it should be noted in  
The interest of justice that the judge was acting in a strictly unofficial
Capacity  
  
The neighbors gathered round Ramonas porch  
The judge said Understand this is not a court  
Ramona squealed as all the breathless neighbors gathered round  
Then closed one eye and puhtui spat upon the ground  
  
And its a familiar old phrase that birds of a feather will flock together  
And justice will be done
