Its too late  
This models out of date  
Got every spare part  
But there aint much heart inside here  
Not like the start  
I was good at the art of survival  
Ive always tried  
To keep my troubles deep inside  
Where I can hide them  
now Im open wide  
  
When it ends  
Again Ill see my friends  
Theyll give me a lift  
Ive been running adrift so easy  
Shifting the gear  
I got nothing to fear from the showdown  
Ill go down quiet  
And kids downstairs making a hell of a din  
Im all alone  
Getting a quote for the wages of sin  
  
Beyond the indigo indigo  
Where the chilly winds winds will blow  
My time is running low  
Going to cross the dark dark river  
Going to see my good lifegiver  
Better cover my yellow liver  
  
Alright  
Im giving up the fight  
I didnt know when  
Id be a stranger again  
In my own land  
The days are OK  
But oh how I hate those long nights  
You understand  
Darling please just hold my hand  
You feel so warm  
In the eye of the storm  
Im going away Im going away Im going away  
See you again someday  
Darling Im going away  
Feel like Im going away this time Im going away
