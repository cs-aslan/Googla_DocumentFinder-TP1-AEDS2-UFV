My old friend I recall  
The times we had hanging on my wall  
I wouldnt trade them for gold  
Cause they laugh and they cry me  
Somehow sanctify me  
Theyre woven in the stories I have told and tell again  
My old friend I apologize  
For the years that have passed  
Since the last time you and I  
Dusted off those memories  
The running and the races  
The people and the places  
There was always somewhere else I had to be  
And time gets thin my old friend  
Dont know why  
Dont know why  
Dont know why  
Dont know why  
  
My old friend this songs for you  
Cause a few simple verses was the least that I could do  
To tell the world that you were here  
Cause the love and the laughter  
Will live on long after  
All of the sadness and the tears  
Well meet again  
My old friendgoodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
My old friend  
My old friend  
Goodbye  
Goodbye
