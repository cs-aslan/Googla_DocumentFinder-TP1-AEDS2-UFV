Theres a land where Ive been told every street is paved with gold  
And its just across the borderline  
When its time to take your turn heres a lesson that you must learn  
You could lose more than youll ever find  
When you reach the broken promiseland every dream slips through your hand  
Youll know its too late to change your mind  
Cause you paid the price to come so far just to wind up where you are  
And youre still just across the borderline  
  
Up and down the Rio Grande a thousand footprints in the sand  
Reveal the secret no one can define  
The river flows on like a breath in between our life and death  
Whos the next to cross the borderline  
  
Hope remains when pride is gone and it keeps you moving on  
Calling you across the borderline  
When you reach the broken promiseland  
And youre still just across the borderline
