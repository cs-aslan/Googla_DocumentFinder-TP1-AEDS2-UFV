Deep waters flow out to the sea  
They never needed you or me  
One summer dream one summer dream  
  
Blue mountains high and valley low  
I dont know which way I should go  
One summer dream one summer dream  
  
Warm summer breeze blows endlessly  
Touching the hearts of those who feel  
One summer dream one summer dream  
  
Bird on wing goes floating by  
But theres a teardrop in his eye  
One summer dream one summer dream  
One summer dream one summer dream
