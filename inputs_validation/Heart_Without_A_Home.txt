Girl I love to watch you  
Youre like candy to my eyes  
Like a movie that youve seen  
But you gotta watch just one more time  
But that smile youre wearing  
Its a beautiful disguise  
Its just something you put on to hide the emptiness inside  
And you seem so lonely  
  
But you dont have to anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
If youre a heart without a home  
Rebel without a cause  
If you feel as though  
Youre always stranded on the shore  
Like a thief in the night  
Let me steal your heart away  
Baby if for reasons what youre looking for  
Ill be yours  
  
Ill be yours  
  
Ill be a new sensation  
One you never had before  
I got a feeling if I gave you some  
Youd probably want some more  
Did you know that Baby  
Youre the bluebird in my sky  
I only wanna make you happy cause  
I love to see you fly  
  
And if you feel lonely  
You dont have to anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill be yours Ill be yours  
  
Ill be the raft in the tide  
Ill be yours  
Ill be the truth in the light  
And whats more  
When no one opens the door  
Ill be the hope that youre looking for  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill be yours
