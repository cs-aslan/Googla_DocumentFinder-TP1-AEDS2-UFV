Im an outdoor kinda man and I really love the land  
From the mountains of Montana to the Alabama sand  
I dont care much about tv cause theres country yet to see  
Id rather be on the lake with a fishin friend  
Im an outdoor kinda man  
  
Give me a cane pole and a shotgun  
And I can have a whole lotta fun  
A soft ole pair of hikin boots  
A pocket knife and a campfire too  
You go out in the woods alone wonder where the big bucks roam  
Whats that noise and your heart beats fast  
Then you smile when a squirrel runs past  
I dont have to get a bear just want to breathe that country air  
Im goin out every time I can  
Im an outdoor lovin man  
  
Im an outdoor lovin man I really love the land  
From the rugged Maine coastline to the Florida Keys sand  
I dont care much about tv cause theres country I aint seen  
Id rather be on the lake with a fishin friend  
Im an outdoor lovin man  
  
I want a mountaintop and a wheat field  
A cool clear lake a rod and a reel  
A fourwheeler a ride on a bike  
A horseback trip a snowshoe hike  
  
The concrete jungle I dont want Id rather be out in the swamp  
My jobs got me tied up so I dream of where the red fern grow  
This weekend Ill find where the river bends and the fish jump high  
Ill be there every time I can  
Im an outdoor kinda man  
  
Im an outdoor lovin man and I really love the land  
From the rugged Maine coastline to the Alabama sand  
All the talk shows on tv they dont do a whole lot for me  
Id rather be in a deer stand Im an outdoor lovin man  
  
Id rather be on the lake with a fishin friend  
Im an outdoor kinda man
