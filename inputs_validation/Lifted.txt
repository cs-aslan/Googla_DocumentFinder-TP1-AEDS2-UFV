Ive got something new for you  
When it hits you wont know what to do  
Relax let me move you  
Dont resist its in the air  
Just one taste will take you there  
Let it flow right through you  
I know youre getting tired of the same old thing  
Imma break the rules gonna change the game  
Youll be screaming my name  
And Imma take you places you never seen  
You couldnt picture this in your wildest dreams  
Dont fear youre here with me  
  
Chorus  
Lets get lifted  
lifted  
Ohh Imma get you high  
Im really gonna blow your mind  
Well get lifted lifted  
Youre gonna feel it in your soul  
And baby you will lose control  
Well get lifted high  
Ohhh ohhhh  
  
Once you take a hit of this  
You wont ever wanna quit  
Youll be so addicted  
Said Ill have you spinning round and round  
Crazy making freaky sounds  
You wont want to come down  
And Ill have you seeing things and hallucinating  
Even walking funny cuz your legs are shaking  
All night well be blazin  
  
Ill take you for a walk to the other side  
We can get high and enjoy the ride  
Hold tight well be alright  
  
Chorus  
Well get lifted  
lifted  
Ohh Imma get you high  
Im really gonna blow your mind  
Well get lifted  
Youre gonna feel it in your soul  
And baby you will lose control  
Well get lifted high  
Ohhh ohhhh  
  
So come and go

Yeah Ill take you there  
Lemme take you there  
Said I will show you

Theres so much I wanna show ya
