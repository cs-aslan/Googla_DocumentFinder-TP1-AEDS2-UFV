I am living without you  
You think everything will be fine  
I find making it hard to lie  
Realize nothing is left inside  
  
Im about to break somebody off  
Going to lose my mind  
Im about to break somebody off  
I feel Im feeling fine  
Im about to break somebody off  
No it wont be fine  
Im about to break somebody off  
  
My lies is going to hurt you  
my fat not going to wait this time  
I play games just to despite you  
I know youre going to believe this time  
  
Im About to break somebody off  
Going to lose my mind  
Im About to break somebody off  
I feel Im feeling fine  
Im About to break somebody off  
No it wont be fine  
Im About to break somebody off  
  
Feel me as Im laughing  
Leaving eating fucking  
Hating all this bullshit  
Maybe I cant stand this  
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck  
I cant stand this  
  
Fuck  
Im about to break somebody off  
Going to lose my mind  
Im about to break somebody off  
I feel Im feeling fine  
Im about to break somebody off  
No it wont be fine  
Im about to break somebody off  
Off off off off
