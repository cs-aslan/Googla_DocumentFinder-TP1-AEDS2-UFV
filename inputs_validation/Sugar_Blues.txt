Now Im not the type to worry  
Especially if its concerning my health  
Oh no Id never worry  
Id much rather do something else  
Im changing my point of view  
Ever since I caught me the sugar blues  
  
Oh that sugar  
It adds a little sweetness in your life  
Oh sugar  
Wont you add a little sweetness to my life  
You see Im changing my point of view  
Ever since I caught me the sugar blues  
  
See Im changing my point of view  
Ever since I caught me the sugar blues  
Yes Im changing my point of view  
Ever since I got me the sugar blues  
You see Im changing my point of view  
Ever since I caught me  
Ever since I caught me the sugar blues  
Oh yes  
I need me a sugar beet  
Im not the type that would complain  
Just give me sugar cane  
Give me  
Gimme  
Gimme  
Gimme  
Sugar
