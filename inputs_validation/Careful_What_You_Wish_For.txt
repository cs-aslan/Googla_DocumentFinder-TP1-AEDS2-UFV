So this is it  
This is what I wished for  
Just isnt how I envisioned it  
Fame to the point of imprisonment  
I just thought the shitd be different  
But something changed  
The minute that I got a whiff of it  
I started to inhale it  
Smell it  
Started sniffin it  
And it became my cocaine  
I just couldnt quit  
I just wanted a little bit  
Then it turned me to a monster  
I became a hypocrite  
Concert after concert  
  
I was raking in the dough  
Rolling in green  
Had the game hemmed up  
Like a sewing machine  
But I was losing my freedom  
There was no where for me  
To not go and be seen  
And just go and be me  
And there was no inbetween  
You either loved it or hate it  
  
Every CD critics gave it a three then three  
Years later theyd go back and rerate it  
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest  
The Marshall Mathers was a classic  
The Eminem Show was fantastic  
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it  
I guess enough time just aint passed yet  
A couple more years that shitll be illmatic  
And eight years later Im still at it  
Divorce remarried  
A felon  
A father  
Sleeping pill addict  
And this is real talk  
I feel like the Incredible Hulk  
My back has been broke and I can still walk  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold  
  
I got a letter from a fan that said  
Hes been praying for me  
Every day and for some reason  
Its been weighing on my mind heavy  
Cause I dont read every  
Letter I get but something told me to go ahead and open it but  
Why would someone pray for you when they dont know you  
You didnt pray for me when I was local  
And as I lay these vocals  
I think of all the shit I had to go through  
Just to get to where Im at  
Ive already told you at least  
  
A thousand times in these rhymes  
I appreciate the prayer but Ive already got  
God on my side  
And its been one hell of a ride hasnt it  
Just watchin it from an opposite standpoint  
Man boys got to look  
Nuts  
And thats the only word I can think of right now  
On how  
To describe the shit  
This is like a vibe you get  
Go ahead and bob to it  
Just watch what you wish for cause I got the shit  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold  
  
I said  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
Cause you just might get it  
And if you get it then you just might not know  
What to do wit it cause it might just  
Come back on you tenfold
