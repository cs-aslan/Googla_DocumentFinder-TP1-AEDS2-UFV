It came as the daybreak  
Must surely arrive  
Opened my eyes just  
To be sure I was alive  
Another day  
Theyre much the same  
Twentyfour hours for me  
To try again  
Im rollin on Im rollin on  
Im rollin on Im rollin on  
  
It came as a judgement  
We all have to face  
Fickle hour you bring me joy  
You bring me disgrace  
Ill take your challenge  
Man against emotion  
Ill wager my beliefs  
Against my sin  
Im rollin on Im rollin on  
Well Im rollin on  
  
Rollin on and on and on forever  
Yes I am  
Rollin rollin rollin on together  
Rollin on and on and on forever  
Rollin rollin rollin on  
  
Yes Im rollin on  
To where I dont care  
Crystal ball  
You let me down again  
Rollin down a road  
Ive never seen  
Meeting people  
Seeing places Ive never been  
Im rollin on Im rollin on  
Im rollin on Im rollin on  
  
Rollin on and on and on forever  
Yes I am  
Rollin rollin rollin on together  
Rollin on and on and on forever  
Rollin rollin rollin on together  
  
Im rollin on Im rollin on  
Im rollin on Im rollin on  
Crystal ball  
You let me down again  
Im rollin on  
Well Im rollin
