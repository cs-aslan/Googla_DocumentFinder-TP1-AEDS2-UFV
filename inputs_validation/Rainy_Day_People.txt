Rainy day people always seem to know when its time to call  
Rainy day people dont talk  
They just listen till theyve heard it all  
Rainy day lovers dont lie when they tell you  
Theyve been down like you  
Rainy day people dont mind if youre cryin a tear or two  
  
If you get lonely all you really need is that rainy day love  
Rainy day people all know theres no sorrow  
They cant rise above  
Rainy day lovers dont love any others  
That would not be kind  
Rainy day people all know how it hangs  
On their peace of mind  
  
Rainy day lovers dont lie when they tell you  
Theyve been down there too  
Rainy day people dont mind if youre cryin a tear or two  
  
Rainy day people always seem to know  
When youre feelin blue  
High stepping strutters who land in the gutters  
Sometimes need one too  
Take it or leave it or try to believe it  
For youve been down too long  
Rainy day lovers dont hide love inside they just pass it on  
  
Rainy day lovers dont hide love inside they just pass it on
