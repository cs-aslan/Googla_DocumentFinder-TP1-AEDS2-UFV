Consumed by self loving pain self loathing bliss  
It ears away burns you like a cancer  
The feelings inside mask your size with your will  
Now you fall from heart and soul  
Break years of frustration  
All too plain to see  
  
Ease into war  
Invade with foul fingers  
Lie to purify  
Crushing whats not you  
  
They say some are born with a blackened heart  
Fell to the curse of a bastard life  
Cursed with a bastard life  
Your lust to celebrate your name  
Will cause your fall  
Cant change years of frustration  
All have yearned to see  
  
The pedestal crumble  
Ignored actor of aggression  
Falsify to slave  
Avoiding all thats true  
  
You stand up then you fall heartless soulless appetite  
Youre crossing almost every line  
Now its time to wash away  
You lost your way  
You crossed the line  
You crossed the line
