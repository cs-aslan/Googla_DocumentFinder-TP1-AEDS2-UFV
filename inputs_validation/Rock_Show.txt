Hold her hand through the black light  
Baby its a forest land of trick slides  
Honey just take your time  
Close her eyes  
  
Im scared she whispered  
As she wants to hide  
Into a back room where  
She paints on a smile  
She hears a sound  
She hears a sound  
  
It could have been love  
It could have been anybody  
Anybody uhoh  
She waited for love  
But there wasnt anybody  
Around so she left  
Town with the rock show  
  
Keep it cool at the freakshow  
Baby its a happy place  
If you lose it honey  
Just take your time  
Close his eyes  
  
Touch me he whispered  
As he walks to the light  
From the window  
Theres visions of  
A house in the night  
He hears a sound  
He hears a sound  
  
It could have been love  
It could have been anybody  
Anybody uhoh  
He waited for love  
But there wasnt anybody  
Around so he left  
Town with the rock show  
  
Hold her tell her that you need her  
Please undress her slowly uhoh  
Never hold the girl too tightly  
She cant breathe when you speak  
Uhoh uhoh uhoh  
  
It could have been love  
It could have been anybody  
Anybody uhoh uhoh uhoh  
We waited for love  
But there wasnt anybody  
Around so we left  
Town with the rock show  
  
Rock show rock show rock show
