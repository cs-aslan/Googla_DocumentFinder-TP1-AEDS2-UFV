talking  
This that boy Sinner Tone better known to yall  
And essay is cocked strong giving you something  
To ride and get high to Im chilling in the studio  
With HTowns finest a nigga they call ZRo  
So go on and bump this shit and to all you  
Niggas who I done jacked in the game  
Fuck yall I got my beams on your ass right  
ZRo  
Everytime you see me Im a different nigga but dont worry  
About my aim Im consistently accurate with the trigger  
My nigga dont count your chickens fore they hatch  
If you owe me some feddy you better pay me Im ignorant bout my scratch  
I dont trust nan nigga cause nothing but hate they be sending me  
Cant determine my friends from my enemies  
I done had partners that done helped me when my life was on the line  
Talking about hitting me right back Im trying to knock this bitch down  
Putting pussy before your partners disrespecting the game  
What about you broke in them titty bars be collecting your change  
Trick nigga with all these bitch niggas are made to bleed  
Since you giving me another reason to blaze the weed  
And I dont want to do another killing another bid  
Theyve been trying to give me the crack since I was a kid  
But I remain calm pill popping smoking and leaning if I wasnt high  
Id leave these niggas choking and screaming  
Chorus  2x  
Ooh child things are gonna get easier  
Ooh boy things will get brighter  
ZRo  
I keep my middle finger pointed out at all times lyrically  
Abuse somebody in all rhymes indodging in felonious to the small crime  
Everybody want to do a song with Ro but none  
Of these niggas want to get down on a couple of zones with Ro  
Fuck rapping I need some right now money its getting crucial  
Ill be jacking for some right now money  
Niggas aint ready for the episodes that I supply  
PCP influenced Im relentless nigga you can die  
Fuck all these niggas and these white folks Im all alone  
No friends cause in the fucking end a nigga dies all alone  
About to meet my maker I hope my life is right  
But its hard to focus when killers try to murder me every night  
I guess this life is really hard now fiending for the day that this war stops  
Pulling my pistol everytime a car stops  
Live by the sword die by the sword nigga my time is borrowed  
I paint this for another tomorrow  
Chorus  2x  
ZRo  
Im crucified by the media because Im loved by the public  
Even though Im rated number one keep your thumbs up and shove it  
They said Im trying to sound like Pac is my confession to that  
Bitch I cant help it if I sound similar when I be stressing the fact  
See Im gone scream it cause I mean it anything less aint excepted  
The fact that Im dark and Im restless is no resort of living reckless  
Rest in peace to my niggas that got caught up in the struggle  
But Im showing love to the niggas that dont want to see me bubble  
But I take that back fuck you I made it to the top ten on my own  
And every bitch in every city is singing my song  
Imagine that I use to sleep on a corner  
Even in year two triple O fuck working Im selling marijuana  
Pulling the bull up over my eyes you just can never tell  
But I know if Im faking I try to rap now one of tapes gone sell  
I predicted being real by staying true to myself  
Now suicide is something I dont want to do to myself  
talking  
Year two tripple O ZRo the new motherfucking don  
Feel that my nigga Cocked Strong from Sinner Tone  
Day one my nigga knowImsaying  
We gone put it down  
Chorus  2x
