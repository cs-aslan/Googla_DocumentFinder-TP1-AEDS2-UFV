As I was walking down the street  
Down the street down the street  
A pretty little gal I chanced to meet  
Oh she was fair to see  
  
Buffalo Gals wont you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo Gals wont you come out tonight  
And dance by the light of the moon  
  
I stopped her and we had a talk  
Had a talk had a talk  
Her feet took up the whole sidewalk  
And left no room for me  
  
Buffalo Gals wont you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo Gals wont you come out tonight  
And dance by the light of the moon  
  
I asked her if shed have a dance  
Have a dance have a dance  
I thought that I might have a chance  
To shake a foot with her  
  
Buffalo Gals wont you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo Gals wont you come out tonight  
And dance by the light of the moon  
  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stockin  
And her heel kept aknockin and her toes kept arockin  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stockin  
And we danced by the light of the moon  
  
Buffalo Gals wont you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo Gals wont you come out tonight  
And dance by the light of the moon
