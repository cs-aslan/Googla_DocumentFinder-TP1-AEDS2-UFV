Another pleasant day in the countryside  
Has ended up in tears on a stormy night  
Cause you cant follow my directions home  
But dont stop now  
  
God knows where the satellites taking us  
I cant tell whats right in front of us  
But I hang on every word  
And dont stop now  
No dont stop now  
You give me something I can write about  
  
You get fooled by the lightning every time  
See the afterimage of my outline  
And you turn the wrong way round  
Well dont stop now  
No dont stop now  
You give me something I can write about  
You give me something I can cry about  
  
In a church house ten miles out of town  
Is the devil gonna track me down  
And travel through a tunnel in the trees  
Just remember thats how you get to me  
  
Theres no number on the house  
The birds are heading south  
Sometimes you have to turn  
The wrong way round  
Sometimes you get too close to nowhere now  
  
This is helpful in the silence  
I wait with a blank piece of paper on the top of my head  
And all I want is something I can write about  
All I want is something I can cry about  
Ooo
