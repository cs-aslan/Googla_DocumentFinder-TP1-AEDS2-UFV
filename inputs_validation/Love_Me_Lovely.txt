Lovely lovely did you see me  
Just as I was crying  
Love me lovely make it easy  
What I say is hard but I am trying  
  
Lovely lovely can you hear me  
Listen to my singing  
Love me lovely while youre near me  
Try and understand the thought Im bringing  
  
Last night I was sleeping  
But I did not know if Id awaken today  
Lie in my keeping only know  
That I cant stay after today  
Im on my way  love me lovely  
Love me lovely  
  
Lovely lovely you cant fool me  
I know that you need me  
Love me lovely now and truly  
Knowing that your love can only speed me  
  
Dont say how it could be  
Or Ill know that youll be crying today  
Just how it should be I dont know  
So this Ill say  
Im on my way  love me lovely  
Love me lovely  
  
Last night I was sleeping  
But I did not know if Id awaken today  
Lie in my keeping only know  
That I cant stay after today  
Im on my way  love me lovely  
Love me lovely
