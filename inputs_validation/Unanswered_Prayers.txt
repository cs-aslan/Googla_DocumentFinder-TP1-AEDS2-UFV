Just the other night a hometown football game  
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame  
And as I introduced them the past came back to me  
And I couldnt help but think of the way things used to be  
  
She was the one that Id wanted for all times  
And each night Id spend prayin that God would make her mine  
And if hed only grant me this wish I wished back then  
Id never ask for anything again  
  
Chorus  
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers  
Remember when youre talkin to the man upstairs  
That just because he doesnt answer doesnt mean he dont care  
Some of Gods greatest gifts are unanswered prayers  
  
She wasnt quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams  
And I could tell that time had changed me  
Inn her eyes too it seemed  
We tried to talk about the old days  
There wasnt much we could recall  
I guess the Lord knows what hes doin after all  
  
And as she walked away and I looked at my wife  
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord  
For the gifts in my life  
  
Chorus  
  
Some of Gods greatest gifts are all too often unanswered  
Some of Gods greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
