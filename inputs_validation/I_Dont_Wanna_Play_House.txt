Today I sat alone at the window and I watched our little girl outside at play  
With the little boy next door like so many times before  
But somethin didnt seem quite right today  
So I went outside to see what they were doing  
  
And then the teardrops made my eyes grow dim  
Cause I heard him name a game and I hung my head in shame  
When I heard our little girl say to him  
I dont want to play house I know it cant be fun  
I watched mommy and daddy and if thats the way its done  
I dont want to play house it makes my mommy cry  
Cause when she played house my daddy said goodbye  
I dont want to play house
