When I would play my song  
You used to sing along  
I always seem to forget  
How fragile are the very strong  
Im sorry I cant steal you  
Im sorry I cant stay  
So Ill put bandaids on your knees  
And watch you fly away  
Im sending you away tonight  
Ill put you on a birds strong wing  
Im saving you the best way I know how  
I hope again one day to hear you sing  
You know were not so far away  
Get on a boat get on a train  
And if you ever think youre drowning  
Ill try to slow the rain  
In two years or so  
Drop me a line write me a letter  
I hope to find youre doing better  
Better than today better everyday  
Im sending you away tonight  
Ill put you on a birds strong wing  
Im saving you the best way I know how  
I hope again one day to hear you sing  
Im saving you the only way that I know how  
I hope again one day to hear you sing  
I hope again one day to see you  
Bring your smile back around again
