All that is gold does not glitter not all those who wander are lost  
  
Yeah you know  
It be buggin me out you know what Im sayin  
That rap how everybody like is using metaphors and all that  
It seems like everybodys some kind of metaphor freak  
Some kind of metaphorical freak or somethin man  
You know what Im sayin Word up  
So you know what Im saying  
You know brothers want to make a movie and all that  
You know how I mean so I figured you know what Im sayin  
Id just make a little movie with a chicken ball  
Check it  
  
If you saw the movie Wall Street I guess you know  
The way ya stack chips and regulate wild dough  
But aint no Gfunk and far from my era  
Tales from the hood your boyz will feel terror  
MCs contaminatin tracks with feces  
You think of pussy until a flick like Species  
Hitech ya my pen got velocity  
Jumpin out the SSL like Virtuosity  
And never question what Im doin to ya girl  
She let me dive deep like her panties is Waterworld  
But all metaphors the only thing in rap  
You brothers need to stop with that  
  
Chorus  
Im goin from  
Hollis to Hollywood but is he good  
Hollis to Hollywood but is he good  
Hollis to Hollywood but is he good  
Hollis to Hollywood but is he good  
  
Check it  
Im makin Speed like Im Keanu Reeves  
But too many True Lies can make a honey please  
She said I know you want this  
Get a Pocahontas  
I got Higher Learnin  
And bangin gets monotonous  
Her ass is classic  
Cheeks was Jurassic  
Servin a Justice  
Poetic the way I last it  
I touch ground real windy with my lyrics  
Make her talk in tongues and feel the Holy Spirit  
Hear it pulling light strings  
Got mad cast a swing  
When I do my thing my ballz is hairy like the Lion King  
Im in the jungle layin down my mack  
You brothers need to chill with that  
  
Chorus  
  
Take me away  
You think I wont fool  
Take me away  
You think I cant fool  
Take me away  
You think I wont fool  
Take me away  
You think I cant fool  
Its kinda like miniature satellites floatin in closets  
Spyin in pockets  
Jumpin out of a helicopter into a football stadium filled with cotton candy  
  
We  
Word up  
So your man got a good job lovin ya so much  
Boss on his back comin home like What the fuck  
But you be on his side through the thick and all the thin  
Thats when LL come in  
Blast a ass like Apollo 13  
Sugar get the cream  
Hoppin dom in every direction  
What a scene  
He cant understand your best friends plan  
Running game while you chill with the Demolition Man  
Good love have fun tight hugs and flowers  
I have your girl runnin off to fake baby showers  
Better get down before ya cryin at home  
I got her standing on the bed gettin closer to the Drop Zone  
Some brothers wont appreciate that  
Aint it scary when you meet a real mack  
Lets run it back  
See the flavors in my lifestyle chill dont even lie to me  
Balls a lethal weapon dick a menace to society  
You aint a playerhater kid you took her off restriction  
I make her tell lies and knock the pulp out of fiction  
Kid you know Im game tight when you hit it tonight  
I hope she screams my name right  
This word is born kid you know why  
  
Chorus  
  
Check it
