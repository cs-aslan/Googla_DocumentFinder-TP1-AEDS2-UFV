Adia I do believe I failed you  
Adia I know I let you down  
Dont you know I tried so hard  
To love you in my way  
Its easy let it go  
Adia Im empty since you left me  
Trying to find a way to carry on  
I search myself and everyone  
To see where we went wrong  
cause theres no one left to finger  
Theres no one here to blame  
Theres no one left to talk to honey  
And there aint no one to buy our innocence  
cause we are born innocent  
Believe me adia we are still innocent  
Its easy we all falter  
Does it matter  
Adia I thought that we could make it  
But I know I cant change the way you feel  
I leave you with your misery  
A friend who wont betray  
I pull you from your tower  
I take away your pain  
And show you all the beauty you possess  
If youd only let yourself believe that  
We are born innocent  
Believe me adia we are still innocent  
Its easy we all falter does it matter  
Believe me adia we are still innocent  
cause we are born innocent  
Adia we are still innocent  
Its easy we all falter But does it matter
