I know Ill be lonesome  
That brings about a little fear  
I know Ill be sad and Ill be blue  
I have given the best of me  
When I forgot to say to you  
What you forgot to say to me  
So long so wrong  
  
I have tried and cared baby it was never enough  
In your mind I never had a clue  
So Ill repave the same old road Im on  
Where I forgot to say to you  
What you forgot to say to me  
So long so wrong  
  
Did we take forever in vain  
Into the past  
Did we think forever was really gonna last  
  
You have tired me with your wanting ways  
You cant buy yourself to be complete  
I have given up caring anymore  
Once you were big in a world thats small  
And now youre all alone  
  
Have we taken forever in vain  
Into the past  
Did we think forever was really gonna last
