Time machines escape the fall  
But cannot climb the prison wall  
Nowhere to go they stumble headlong  
Stumbling back to where they belong  
Are you looking at my signs  
Have you noticed theyre no timelines  
Can you examine them sometimes  
Can you  
Time machines colliding  
Back and forth reuniting  
No real chance to run away  
No noble voices beckon them  
Have you looked at what Ive found  
In the ocean where my thoughts drown  
Can you walk on it sometimes  
Can you  
Time machines well buy them  
Ill ride them with you  
In the dreams of every page  
And phases we go through  
Are you coming to meet with us  
Will you be taking a seat with us  
At any time in the future or the past  
Is there no one to care for you  
With any crosses to bear for you  
Or is the light always there for you fading fast
