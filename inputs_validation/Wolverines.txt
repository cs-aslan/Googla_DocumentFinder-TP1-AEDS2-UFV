on my back i lay it down for plenty  
these bones to crack  
ill scream til its empty  
i learn how to dance with the dog  
shes clandestine ill spit for a foothold  
these nails are mine  
ill bleed til i get hold  
i learn how to dance with the dog  
i set the scales im fishing for murder  
this whore in jail  
ill bang nail in her  
i learn how to dance with the dog  
its a fox its a bird its a snake its a word  
i heard it crawl from my veins  
your name  
its your name  
its your name  
i learn how to dance with the dog
