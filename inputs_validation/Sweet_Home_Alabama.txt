Big wheels keep on turning  
Carry me home to see my kin  
Singing songs about the southland  
I miss ole bamy once again  
And I think its a sin  
  
Well I heard Mister Young sing about her  
Well I heard ole Neil put her down  
Well I hope Neil Young will remember  
A southern man dont need him around any how  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord Im coming home to you  
  
In Birmingham they love the Govnor  
Now we all did what we could do  
Now Watergate does not bother me  
Does your conscience bother you  
Tell the truth  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord Im coming home to you  
  
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers  
And theyve been known to pick a song or two  
Lord they get me off so much  
They pick me up when Im feeling blue  
Now how bout you  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord Im coming home to you
