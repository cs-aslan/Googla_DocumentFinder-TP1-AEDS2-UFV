Baby tell me how  
You expect someone to live a life that way  
Each and every day baby  
Ive been hoping that you will give in  
Give in give in give in  
You mean more to me than just a friend  
  
Kiss me now  
Ive been waiting too long  
Years my dear my dear my dear

And I wish that you were here  
So I could hold you near
