I fell in love with a darkeyed lady  
She seemed to be on her own  
And from nowhere when I came over   
A princess without a throne  
That night as I was takin her home  
I got a feelin that we werent alone  
Keep your hands on the wheel we got a tail there  
Tryin to put us off the road  
What are you gonna do when a man from her past catches up with you  
What are you gonna do when he wants to make a claim on you  
Fast johnny Im flat on the boards   
Fast johnny Im cutting the corners   
Fast johnny Im closin the door   
Fast johnny dont chase me in your car no more  
You know nobody can drive quite like I can  
Runnin every red light in town  
We danced on the floor danced on the street  
Danced as the wheels turned around  
Maybe johnny youll meet your match  
When you look into my chevys eyes  
Keep your engine hot and running  
cause this sweet little honeys gonna take you by surprise  
What are you gonna do when a man from her past catches up with you  
What are you gonna do when he wants to make a claim on you  
Fast johnny Im flat on the boards   
Fast johnny Im cuttin the corners   
Fast johnny Im closin the door   
Fast johnny dont chase me in your car no more  
Repeat and close
