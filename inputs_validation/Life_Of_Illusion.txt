Sometimes I cant help the feeling that  
Im living a life of illusion  
And oh why cant we let it be  
And see through the hole in this wall of confusion  
I just cant help the feeling  
Im living a life of illusion  
  
Pow Right between the eyes  
Oh how nature loves her little surprises  
Wow it all seems so logical now  
Its just one of her better disguises  
And it comes with no warning  
Nature loves her little surprises  
Continual crisis  
  
Hey dont you know its a waste of your day  
Caught up in endless solutions  
That have no meaning just another hunch  
Based upon jumping conclusions  
Endless solutions  
Backed up against a wall of confusion  
  
Im living a life of illusion  
Im living a life of illusion  
Im living a life of illusion  
Im living a life of illusion
