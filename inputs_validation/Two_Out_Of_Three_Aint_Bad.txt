Baby we can talk all night  
But that aint gettin us nowhere  
I told you everything I possibly can  
Theres nothing left inside of here  
And maybe you can cry all night  
But thatll never change the way I feel  
The snow is really piling up outside  
I wish you wouldnt make me leave here  
I poured it on and I poured it out  
I tried to show you just how much I care  
Im tired of words and Im too hoarse to shout  
But youve been cold to me so long  
Im crying icicles instead of tears  
  
And all I can do is keep on telling you  
I want you I need you  
Butthere aint no way Im ever gonna love you  
Now dont be sad  
Cause two out of three aint bad  
Now dont be sad  
Cause two out of three aint bad  
  
Youll never find your gold on a sandy beach  
Youll never drill for oil on a city street  
I know youre looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks  
But there aint no Coup de Ville hiding at the bottom  
Of a Cracker Jack box  
  
I cant lie I cant tell you that Im something Im not  
No matter how I try  
Ill never be able to give you something  
Something that I just havent got  
Theres only one girl Ill ever love  
And that was so many years ago  
And though I know Ill never get her out of my heart  
She never loved me back  
Oh I know  
  
I remember how she left me on a stormy night  
She kissed me and got out of our bed  
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door  
She packed her bags and turned right away  
  
And she kept on telling me  
She kept on telling me  
She kept on telling me  
I want you I need you  
  
But there aint no way Im ever gonna love you  
Now dont be sad  
Cause two out of three aint bad  
I want you I need you  
But there aint no way Im ever gonna love you  
Now dont be sad  
Cause two out of three aint bad  
Baby we can talk all night  
But that aint getting us nowhere
