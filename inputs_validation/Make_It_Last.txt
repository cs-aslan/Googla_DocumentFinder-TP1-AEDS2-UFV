Come on and stay with me for a little while  
Hey cant we spend some time together  
You look so good to me and I like your style  
Come on lets make it last forever

I just want to love you with all my might  
You better believe that Im a good one  
And I wanna guarantee Ill treat you right  
Come on and stay with me for a little while  
Come on and spend some time together  
Whatever it takes Im gonna make you smile  
Hey cant we make it last forever

Puttin all my lovin on the line  
There aint a man that I cant handle  
Give me your love and Ill give you mine
