When will you carry me home like the wounded star in the movie  
When will you carry me home take it back to the start when you knew me  
Cause when you talk to me that way Ill be a million miles away  
I guess its just another day in love  
  
Were battleships driftin in our wee river  
Takin hits sinking its now or never  
Overboard drownin in a sea of love and hate but its too late  
Battleship down  
  
When will you figure it out that you arent always right little darlin  
When will you figure it out that its not worth the fight little darlin  
Cause when you cant think what to say you go and throw it all away  
I guess its just another day in love  
  
Were battleships driftin in our wee river  
Takin hits sinking its now or never  
Overboard drownin in a sea of love and hate but its too late  
Battleship down  
  
But youre too smart and Im too dumb  
With no heart in the middle  
  
Were battleships driftin in our wee river  
Takin hits sinking its now or never  
Overboard falling into the ocean  
Ship to shore drownin in a sea of love and hate but its too late  
Battleship down
