Rudys on a train to nowhere halfway down the line  
He dont want to get there but he needs time  
He aint sophisticated nor welleducated  
After all the hours he wasted still he needs time  
He needs time  he needs time for livin  
He needs time  for someone just to see him  
He aint haid no lovin  
For no reason or rhyme  
And the whole worlds above him  
Well its not as though hes fat  
No theres more to this than that  
See he tries to play it cool  
Wouldnt be nobody fool  
  
Rudy thought that all good things comes to those that wait  
But recently he could see that it may come too late  
  
All through your life all through the years  
Nobody loved nobody cared  
So dim the light dark are your fears  
Try as I might I cant hold back the tears  
How can you live without love its not fair  
Someone said give but I just didnt dare  
What good advice are you waiting to hear  
Hearings alright for them thats all there  
Youd better gain control now  
Youd better show em all now  
Youd better make or break now  
Youd better give and take now  
Youll have to push and shove now  
Youll have to find some love now  
Youd better gain control now  
Now hes just come out the movie  
Numb of all the pain  
Sad but in a while hell soon be  
Back on his train
