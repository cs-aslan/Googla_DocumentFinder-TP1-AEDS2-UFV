Sex and the city and Indian food  
I never tried em not until you  
But lord its lookin like you left me with some habits I cant break  
I feel kinda guilty whenever I cuss  
I lay in bed at night and I think about us  
Maybe its because of all the love you taught me how to make  
  
You changed me baby  
And given enough time girl you might have saved me  
But then again you might have just gone crazy  
Tryin to love a music man  
Dont worry honey  
I understand why you went runnin from me  
I guess I really should have seen it comin  
Ill always die by my own hand  
  
Ran into your daddy last Saturday night  
I had to admit it he might have been right  
Oh all the times he told me that youre just too good for me  
  
You changed me baby  
And given enough time girl you might have saved me  
But then again you might have just gone crazy  
Tryin to love a music man  
Dont worry honey  
I understand why you went runnin from me  
I guess I really should have seen it comin  
Ill always die by my own hand  
  
Oh you changed me baby  
And given enough time girl you might have saved me  
But then again you might have just gone crazy  
Tryin to love a music man  
Dont worry honey  
I understand why you went runnin from me  
I guess I really should have seen it comin  
Ill always die by my own hand  
  
Girl I dont blame you for nothin  
Ill always die by my own hand
