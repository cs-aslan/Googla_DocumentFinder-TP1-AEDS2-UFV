You gotta make your own rules child  
You gotta break your own chains  
The dreams that possess you  
Can blossom and bless you  
Or run you insane  
  
The moment is yours now  
To lay on the line  
The past just dont matter  
Tomorrow wont mind  
  
Lay down beside me  
Show me a sign  
Let me feel your spirit  
Running with mine  
  
I dont deserve you  
Im just a man  
But I swear ill love you  
Just as hard as I can  
  
Storm on the mountain  
Stars in the sky  
Running for glory  
Freedom to fly  
  
Will you remember  
Way down the road  
Somebody loves you  
More than you know
