Can you hear the music can you hear the music  
Can you feel the magic hangin in the air  
Can you feel the magic Oh yeah  
  
Love is a mystery I cant demystify oh no  
Sometimes I wonder why were here  
But I dont care I dont care  
  
Can you hear the music can you hear the music  
Can you feel the magic dancin in the air  
Can you feel the magic Oh yeah  
  
Love is a mystery I cant demystify oh no  
Sometimes I Im dancin on air  
But I get scared I get scared  
  
When I hear the drummer get me in the groove  
When I hear the guitar makes me want to move  
Can you feel the magic floatin in the air  
Can you feel the magic Oh yeah  
  
Sometimes youre feelin youve been pushed around  
And your rainbow just aint here  
Dont you fear dont you fear  
  
When you hear the music trouble disappear  
When you hear the music ringin in your ears  
Can you feel the magic floatin in the air  
Can you hear the magic Oh yeah yeah  
  
When you hear the music ringin in my ear  
Can you hear the music Oh yeah  
Can you hear the drummer Gets you in the groove  
Can you hear the guitar Make you want to move Yeah  
  
Can you hear the music Oh yeah  
Can you hear the music ringin in my ear  
Can you hear the music can you hear the music
