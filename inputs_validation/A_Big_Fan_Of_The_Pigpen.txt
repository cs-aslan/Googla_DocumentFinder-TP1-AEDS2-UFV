Oh to speak on ones feet  
To beat on ones brain  
The popular mechanics are at it again  
A tenement filled with sideshow freaks  
Assembled to downgrade  
An impeccable arrangement  
By the softrock renegades  
And give me time to light  
A sentimental torch tonight  
Im a big fan of the pigpen  
  
Sharper than most  
Cut with exacto  
Gone is all good  
Ex post facto  
Badabada  
Oh oh
