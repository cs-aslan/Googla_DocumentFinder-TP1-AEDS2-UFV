Can it be I stayed away too long  
Did I leave your mind when I was gone  
Its not my thing trying to get back  
But this time let me tell you where Im at  
  
You dont have to worry cause Im coming  
Back to where I should have always stayed  
And now Ive heard the maybe to your story  
And its enough love for me to stay  
  
Can it be I stayed away too long  
Did I leave your mind when I was gone  
Well its not my thing trying to get back  
But this time let me tell you where Im at  
  
I want to want to be where you are ooh aah  
Anywhere you are ooh aah  
I want to want to be where you are ooh aah  
Everywhere you are ooh aah  
  
Please dont close the door to our future  
Theres so many things we havent tried  
I gonna love you better than I used to  
And give you all the love I have inside
