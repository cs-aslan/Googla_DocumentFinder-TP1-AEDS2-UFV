I sing just to know that Im alive  
I play just to feel that Ill survive  
And if theres a second place  
Where  just the case  
I sing just to know that Im alive  
Sugoose Yeah Sugoose Sugoose Yeah Sugoose Sugoose Yeah Sugoose  
Well the mountains they wont move no they dont  
And the people they wont dance and they wont  
I sing I sing I sing I sing  
I sing just to know that Im alive
