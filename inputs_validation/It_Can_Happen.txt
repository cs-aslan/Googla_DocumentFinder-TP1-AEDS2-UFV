You can fool yourself  
You can cheat until youre blind  
You can cut your heart  
It can happen  
  
You can mend the wires  
You can feed the soul apart  
You reach  
It can happen to you  
It can happen to me  
It can happen to everyone eventually  
  
Its a constant fight  
A constant fight  
Youre pushing the needle to the red  
Black and white  
Who knows whos right  
No substitute youre born youre dead  
Fly by night  
Created out of fantasy  
Our destinations call  
  
Look up  
Look down  
Look out  
Look around  
Look up  
Look down  
Theres a crazy world outside  
Were not about to lose our pride  
  
It can happen to you  
It can happen to me  
It can happen to everyone eventually  
  
As you happen to say  
It can happen today  
As it happens  
It happens in every way  
  
This world I like  
We architects of life  
A song a sigh  
Developing words that linger  
Through fields of green through open eyes  
This for us to see  
  
Look up  
Look down  
Look out  
Look around  
So look up  
Look down  
Theres a crazy world outside  
Were not about to lose our pride  
  
It can happen to you  
It can happen to me  
It can happen to everyone eventually  
  
As you happen to say  
It can happen today  
As it happens  
It happens in every way  
  
As you happen to see  
It will happen to be  
Nothing happens to nowhere and nowhere  
  
Solo  
  
Look up  
Look down  
Theres a crazy world outside  
Were not about to lose our pride  
  
It can happen to you  
It can happen to me  
It can happen to everyone eventually  
  
As you happen to see  
It will happen to be  
Nothing happens to nowhere and nowhere  
  
You can fool yourself  
You can cheat until youre blind  
You can cut your heart  
  
You can fool yourself It can happen to you  
You can cheat until youre blind It can happen to me  
  
You can cut your heart It can happen to eveyone eventually  
As you happen to say  
It can happen today  
As it happens  
It happens in every way  
  
You can mend the wires  
You can feed the soul apart  
You can touch your life  
You can bring your soul alive  
It can happen to you  
It can happen to me  
It can happen to everyone eventually  
  
As you happen to say  
It can happen today  
As it happens  
It happens in every way
