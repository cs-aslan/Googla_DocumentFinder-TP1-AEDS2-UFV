Lord dont she make me proud  
She never makes a scene  
By hangin all over me in a crowd  
  
Cause people love to talk  
Lord dont they love to talk  
But when they turn out the lights  
I know shell be leaving with me  
  
When we get behind closed doors  
Then she lets her hair hang down  
And she makes me glad that Im a man     
Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors  
  
My baby makes me smile  
Lord dont she make me smile  
Shes never far away  
Or too tired to say I want you  
  
Shes always a lady  
Just like a lady should be  
But when they turn out the lights  
Shes still a baby with me  
  
When we get behind closed doors  
Then she lets her hair hang down  
And she makes me glad that Im a man     
Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors  
  
Oh no one knows  
What goes on behind closed doors  
 Behind closed doors Behind closed doors   
Behind closed doors
