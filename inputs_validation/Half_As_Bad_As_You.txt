One two three four  
  
You know that I want you  
You know that I need you too  
When you look at me I hope you believe  
That what I say is true  
So Im gonna show ya  
The feelings I have for you  
But you need to know I have no control  
Of the things you make me do  
Well I know you dont understand  
Would you please just give me your hand  
Hand hand hand hand  
  
I dont know how much more I can take more I can take  
Im stuck in a dream and I dont want to wake dont want to wake  
Is this real or is this a mistake  
I know one thing this is true  
I couldnt want anyone half as bad as you  
  
You say that you want me  
You say that you need me too  
But you cant mean the words you say  
The way I know I do  
I said that I love you  
I tell them youre mine  
They just turn and walk away  
It happens all the time  
But I know they dont understand  
Would you please just give me your hand  
Hand hand hand hand  
  
I dont know how much more I can take more I can take  
Stuck in a dream and I dont want to wake dont want to wake  
This is real and it aint no mistake  
I know one thing this is true  
I couldnt want anyone half as bad as you  
  
I hope these words get your attention  
Sometimes I get carried away  
With what I say is it okayayayayy  
  
I dont know how much more I can take  
Stuck in a dream and I dont want to wake  
Cause this is real and its not a mistake  
I know one thing this is true  
You love me and I love you  
I couldnt want anyone half as bad as you
