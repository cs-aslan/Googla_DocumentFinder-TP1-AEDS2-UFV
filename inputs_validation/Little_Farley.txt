Little Farley  
Why you hangin out so long  
I can tell by the people  
Youre runnin with  
That youre singin a different song  
  
Little Farley  
What you hidin in your drawer  
Dont you know that I know what youre doin  
And it aint worth dyin for  
  
Little Farley  
Why you takin that to school  
Livin out your life in Angola  
Really dont sound too cool  
  
Little Farley  
Why you want to take a life  
That little girl they laid to rest today  
She coulda been your wife  
  
Little Farley  
You know that dont belong to you  
What you took in less than a minute  
Mighta took him a month or two  
  
Little Farley  
A boy dont have to be a man  
If you cant decide what you want to be  
Then Im tellin you no one can  
  
Little Farley  
Think about it
