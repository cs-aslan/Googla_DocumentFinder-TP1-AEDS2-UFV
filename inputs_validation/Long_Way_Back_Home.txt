From the railhead to the boatyard  
From the factory to the farm  
From the mine to the mill yard  
Ive weathered the storm  
From the bar room to the bedpost  
Ive wasted my days all I have is my drink  
And the time left to think  
While time slips away  
Just look at my face  
When you tell me goodbye  
Youll see what Im after  
By the look in my eye  
Just walk away and leave me alone  
Its a long way back home  
Now in case you should ask me  
What it is that Ive done  
Id say Im a soldier  
Who once had a son  
But my son doesnt know me  
Thats his right to choose  
Oh say can you see My best friend is me  
Im a friend I could use  
Just look at my face  
When you tell me goodbye  
Youll see what Im after  
By the look in my eye  
Just walk away and leave me alone  
Its a long way back home  
Now the pages have faded  
The story grows cold  
And the plot falls to ashes  
Like the ruins of old  
Those rats in my rafters  
Theyre after my shoes  
And anything else they can find on the shelf  
Ive said they could use  
And just look at my face  
When you tell me goodbye  
Youll see what Im after  
By the look in my eye  
Just walk away and leave me alone  
Its a long way back home  
Its a long way back home
