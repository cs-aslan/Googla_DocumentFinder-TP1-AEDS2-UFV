Sunrise comes and I dont know why  
Living loves and the day does fly  
Soon the moon and baby and I  
Will be lyin side by side  
  
How many of your skies are blue  
How much of your love is true  
Where to get them eyes of green  
Im knowin you know just what I mean  
  
If I have to go I wont be long  
Maybe well move to Tennessee  
Leave these Texas blues behind  
See Susanna and Guy  
  
Well Im in this cold room all alone  
I guess Ill try the telephone  
Itll be busy or she wont be home  
Tomorrow is another day  
  
Sunrise comes and I dont know why  
Living loves and the day does fly  
Soon the moon and baby and I  
Will be lyin side by side
