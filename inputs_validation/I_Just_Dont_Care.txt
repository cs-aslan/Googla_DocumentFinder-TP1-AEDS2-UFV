The indestructible has broken down  
The undeniable is turned around  
And I dont care my love  
I just dont care  
I love you  
The unbelievable has all come true  
I love the changes that youve put me through  
And I dont care you see  
I just dont care  
I love you  
  
I see the magic  
That were making now  
And a veil is lifted  
From my eyes somehow  
And the most amazing thing  
That comes to light  
Is the world looks different  
To me overnight  
  
My friends will tell you  
That Ive lost my cool  
The lovesick schoolboy  
Turning up for school  
But I dont care you know  
I just dont care  
I love you  
  
I see the magic  
That were making now  
And a veil is lifted  
From my eyes somehow  
And the most amazing thing  
That comes to light  
Is the world looks different  
To me overnight  
  
My friends will tell you  
That Ive lost my cool  
The lovesick schoolboy  
Turning up for school  
But I dont care you know  
I just dont care  
I love you  
  
cause I dont care you see  
I just dont care  
I love you  
I love you
