Well now that she is gone  
You wont feel bad for long  
For maybe just an hour or  
Just a moment of the day  
Then blue turns to grey  
And try as you may  
You just dont feel good  
And you dont feel alright  
And you know that  
You must find her  
Find her find her  
You think youll have a ball  
And you wont hurt at all  
Youll find another girl  
Or maybe more to pass the time away  
Then blue turns grey  
And try as you may  
You just dont feel good  
And you dont feel alright  
And you know that  
You must find her  
Find her find her  
And you know that  
You must find her  
Find her find her  
Shes not home when you call  
So you then go to all  
All the places where she likes to be  
But she has gone away  
Then blue turns to grey  
And try as you may  
You just dont feel good  
And you dont feel alright  
And you know  
That you must find her  
Find her find her  
Blue turns to grey  
Blue turns to grey  
Blue turns to grey  
Blue turns to grey
