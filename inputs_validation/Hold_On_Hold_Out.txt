Hold on hold out keep a hold on strong  
The moneys in and the bets are down  
You wont hold out long  
  
They say youll fall in no time at all  
But you know theyre wrong  
Known it all along  
  
Hold on hold out keep a hold on still  
If you dont see what your love is worth  
No one ever will  
Youve done your time on the bottom line  
  
And it aint no thrill  
Theres got to be something more  
Keep a hold on still  
You know what it is youre waiting for  
  
Now you just hold on  
Hold on hold out hold on  
  
Give up your heart and you lose your way  
Trusting another to feel that way  
Give up your heart and you find yourself  
Living for something in somebody else  
Sometimes you wonder what happens to love  
Sometimes the touch of a friend is enough  
  
Hold a place for the human race  
Keep it open wide  
Give it time to fall or climb  
But let the time decide  
  
Sometimes you wonder whats in this for you  
But you wait and you see  
Cause its all you can do  
Just to hold on  
Hold on hold out hold on  
  
For the countless souls beaten by their goals  
Keep a hold on now  
And the ones betrayed by the deals they made  
Keep a hold on  
If you hold your ground itll turn around  
Keep a hold somehow  
  
Hold on hold out keep a hold on tight  
Tonights the night  
Wake up and turn on the light  
You fight and youre right  
Its gonna take all your might  
  
Youre a hold out  
Well Im a hold out too  
But it took me all this time to figure out  
Something you already knew  
  
Will love be true Can it pull you through  
How long How strong  
Some things depend on you  
See I always figured I was going to meet somebody here  
  
And I dont know why  
Why should love come down and suddenly just sweep me away  
I want to fly  
But there are so many things in my way  
  
Anyway  
I guess you wouldnt know unless I told you  
But  
I love you  
Well just look at yourself  
What else would I do  
  
Hold on
