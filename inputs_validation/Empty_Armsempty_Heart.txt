Now you say youre leaving  
Leaving me without a friend  
How can you do what youre doing to me  
How can you say you want to be free of me  
  
Now you say its over  
And your walkin out my door  
Tellin me youre going away for good  
Never coming back and Ill never see you again  
  
Chorus  
  
You left me here with my empty arms  
My empty rooms  
And my empty heart is crying  
  
Nothing is left for me now youre gone  
It just aint right and I know it cant last Im dying  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Lead
