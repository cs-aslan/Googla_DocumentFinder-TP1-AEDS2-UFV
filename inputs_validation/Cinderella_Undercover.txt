When I was young my mind would always wander away  
I couldnt talk never had nothin to say  
But now Im grown nothing much seems to have changed  
I think Im going insane yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Is this a fairy tale are you the seven dwarves  
Did Snow White really die while fighting in the war  
They were the only friends I ever trusted  
Now theyre scattered and livin in the city  
Unlisted numbers Huh  
Cinderella undercover  
I say better alive than dead  
The war is coming but theres nothing much that we can do  
Stuck in a payphone but the operator wont let me through  
I close my eyes but the memories burn in my brain  
I think Im going insane yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I heard a rumor they said its gone nuclear  
I stockpile cigarettes and double bold the door  
A sanctuary for all my friends  
Well stay in bed until the world ends  
So please dont wake me I gotta get some sleep  
Cinderella Undercover  
I say better alive than dead  
I think Im going insane yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Is this a fairy tale this cant be real  
Theres fighting all around theyre shooting in the fields  
They say that values change when hunger or ambition strikes  
Survival is essential at any cost or any price  
The cartoon animals on Old McDonalds farm  
Are nodding off in hotel rooms with needles in their arms  
The seven dwarves HA theres only four alive today  
Cinderellas working for the CIA  
Cinderella the fairy tales over  
You should know you got the scars to prove it  
And your skin isnt as soft as it used to  
But I dont care come on you said it baby  
Cinderella undercover  
I say better alive than  
Cinderella undercover  
I say better alive than dead
