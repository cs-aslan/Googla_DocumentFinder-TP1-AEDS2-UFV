Now I know your secret  
I promise that Ill keep it  
So confidentially  
Between just you and me Ill never leak it  
  
Im the specialist  
I know you cant resist  
Ill bypass your alarm  
No need to twist my arm I insist  
  
If youre looking for a war  
Theres a market for betrayal  
Dont ask me what I saw  
Ya know my secrets not for sale  
Dont ask me what I heard  
Ya know I promised not to say  
I said Id never breathe a word  
Until my dying day  
  
Well seeing is believing  
No use in your deceiving  
For now I know its true  
Its you that holds the clue Ill be leaving  
  
Now Ive got to say goodbye  
You understand I have to fly  
When you get the third degree  
And the truth dont set you free Youve got to lie  
  
If youre looking for a war  
Theres a market for betrayal  
Dont ask me what I saw  
Ya know my secrets not for sale  
Dont ask me what I heard  
Ya know I promised not to say  
I said Id never breathe a word  
Until my dying day
