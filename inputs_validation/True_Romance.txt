Just one glance and I never had a chance  
There and then I knew Id fall in love with you  
You should know that you had me at hello  
I was Juliet and youre my Romeo  
  
Youre my super hero save me from this sorrow  
Sweep me off my feet and fly me away  
You are my Mcdreamy youre my own Mcstreamy  
Brad Pitt and George Clooney dont stand a chance  
Youre my one and only true romance  
  
Just one kiss you swept me off my feet  
And my heart was beating faster than it should  
Just one smile Just one smile and its like a carpet ride  
I can hear the song a whole new world with you  
A whole new world  
  
Youre my Bieber fever yure my Ashton Kutcher  
Im going Lady Gaga papa paparazzi over you  
  
Ooh you are my Mcdreamy youre my own Mcstreamy  
Brad Pitt and George Clooney dont stand a chance  
Youre my one and only true romance  
  
Ill be yours forever and a day  
Our love is here to stay  
You are my one true romance  
  
Loving you is easy  
Though it might sound cheesy  
Im a girl just standing in front of a boy  
Asking him to love her  
When you say nothing at all  
  
Youre my super hero  
Save me from this sorrow  
Sweep me off my feet and fly me away  
Fly me away  
Youre my one and only true romance  
When I fall in love
