Ein zwei drei vier  
I wake up in the morning  
Looking at the street below  
Oh the aggravation down below  
Its no coincidence at all  
The war is over  
But the battle has just begun  
Its still going on  
Still going on  
Why  
Mass migration of people  
Lithuania estonia czechoslovakia poland  
Refugees from all over the european continent  
All traveling to america  
The land of the free  
All traveling to america  
To the great city  
Life in the city  
Started to get me down  
Everybody pushin and shovin  
Aggravation all around  
Aggravation  
Cmon  
Cmon  
Oh baby  
   
Have you had enough  
Have you had enough of all this aggravation  
Fifty years ago this year  
It was fifty years ago this year  
When the aggravation begun  
Its still going on  
Ein zwei drei vier
