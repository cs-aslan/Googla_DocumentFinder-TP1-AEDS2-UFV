Candace Mom look dont roll your eyes at me  
Mom look just come over and see  
Mom look it shouldnt be so hard  
Mom look they built it in the backyard  
Candace Once they made it winter in June  
Linda I didnt see it  
Candace Built a rocket to the moon  
Linda I didnt see it  
Candace Mom they cause me so much pain  
Linda Now Candace  
Candace Once they even gave me Perrys brain  
Linda Oh for crying out loud  
  
Candace They built a submarine a time machine  
A haunted house that made me scream  
Drove cattle through the mall  
Built a giant bowling ball  
Blew me up to fifty feet  
A chariot dragged me down the street  
  
Candace stops to catch her breath  
La la la la la la la la  
  
Candace Made their stupid clothes a fashion craze  
Shoelace tips a household phrase  
Shot me through a circus tent  
Always asked where Perry went  
A lava flow destroy my face  
A giant roller derby race  
Thawed a caveman out of ice  
Built a roller coaster twice
