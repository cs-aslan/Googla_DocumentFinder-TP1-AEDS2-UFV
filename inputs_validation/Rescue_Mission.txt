The Captain touched his swagger stick  
Up to his golden eye  
And boogied through the vestibule  
While bidding us goodbye  
The enemy surrounds us  
And our spirits almost gone  
The Devil take the cavalry  
That sold us for a song  
  
Theres ChiChis on the starboard lads  
And ChiChis in the stern  
And hashish in the hookah pipes  
And bonny grass to burn  
Our mission is a secret  
But were fool enough to try  
Well sail the bloody ocean boys  
Or drink the bastard dry  
  
If Idve been a carpenter the swarthy  
Sergeant said  
Id never seen this ugly thing  
That hangs above my head  
The hell with all your heros  
And the wounds they hope to show  
Im just a simple soldier son  
With one more year to go  
  
The Albatross was tiring  
And the cook was in a stew  
The filthy little cabin boy  
Was whizzing in my shoe  
The Captains wife was aging  
And the first mate heard her scream  
When Tommy slipped tabasco in the  
Captains vaseline  
  
Our time will soon be gone he said  
Its all weve left to lose  
Weve shot our ammunition  
And were all but out of booze  
So heres to Irma Donegal  
Heres to Nellie Blye  
And heres to my old friend he said  
And kissed his ass goodbye  
  
Give off give off You sorry lot  
Give off the Captain cried  
Weve lost our bloody anchor  
And were driftin with the tide  
The swollen surf is pounding  
Like a thousand cannons roar  
And I shake the hand of any man  
Who guides us into shore  
  
Were saved Were saved  
The soldiers said  
Were saved the sailors cried  
And soldiers climbed aboard  
While sailors left from either side  
Some swabbies hit the minefield and  
The rifles got the rest  
And somewhere theres a schooner  
Sinkin slowly in the West
