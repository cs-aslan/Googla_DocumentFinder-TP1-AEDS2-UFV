I used to talk about politics politics politics  
I used to talk about politics but I dont anymore  
I used to talk about communism socialism capitalism  
I used to talk about all those isms but now Im a dad  
And all I talk about is baby poo  
  
Baby poo baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
I used to rant about traffic problems  
Fender benders stupid signs  
I used to fear an accident  
But now I stay at home  
And talk about  
  
Baby poo baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
Sometimes its all brown and gooey  
Sometimes it looks like dijon mustard  
Sometimes its like melted crayon  
Sometimes it just smells like POO  
  
I used to talk about philosophy  
Kafka Descartes Socrates  
I used to think metaphysically  
But now I think the world evolves around  
  
Baby poo baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
Sometimes it feels just like stucco  
Sometimes it feels like Jello pudding  
Sometimes its like avocado  
Sometimes she just pees on me  
  
I used to be real intresting  
Discussing issues of the day  
But now I call up my MP  
And tell her all about my baby poo  
  
Baby poo baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
Baby poo baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo
