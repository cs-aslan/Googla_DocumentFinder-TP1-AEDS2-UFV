Tonight Theyll be no darkness tonight  
Hold tight let your love light shine bright  
Listen to my heart and lay your body next to mine  
Let me fill your soul with all my dreams  
  
Youre a woman Im a man  
This is more than just a game  
I can make you feel so right  
Be my lady of the night  
Youre a woman Im a man  
Youre my fortune Im your fame  
  
These are things we cant disguise  
Be my lady of the night  
Lay back Back in my tenderness  
And take Take all of my sweet caress  
Youve got all of me It cant go wrong if you agree  
Soon two hearts will beat in ecstasy
