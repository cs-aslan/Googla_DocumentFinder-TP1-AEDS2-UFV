See the little girl lost walking through this world alone  
She aint looking for a lover shes just looking for a home  
If you want more than sympathy then look for something else  
Cause shes not true to anyone not even to herself  
  
Shell have sixteen smiling strangers who are handing her a line  
While shes drawing dirty pictures on the black side of your mind  
And that body shell let anybody hold but the devils got her soul  
But if you take her take her easy  
  
Treat her gentle she used to love me  
See the little girl lost pleading silently for help  
Knowing no one understands her she dont understand herself  
Shell feed your hungry ego til you think youre quite a man  
But you better count your fingers when she turns loose of your hand  
  
Cause youre just a game shes playing any way that she can win  
And you aint about to touch her any deeper than her skin  
In that body anybody can control but the devils got her soul  
But if you take her take her easy  
Treat her gentle she used to love me
