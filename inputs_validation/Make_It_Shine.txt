Theres a miracle waiting theres a ticket worth taking  
Theres a reason to believe your eyes  
An ounce of conviction is the only admission  
Yeah its risky but its worth the ride  
And all the dreams that youve held inside  
Yes theyre waiting to break out you just have to try  
  
Make it shine let your heart beat right in time  
Make it shine lay your whole world on the line  
  
Find a clue and unfold it shake the dust off and hold it  
If it tells you something let me know  
So much is forgotten so much worth unlocking  
Wont you tell me how to break the code  
And never worry bout the things you read  
Its so easy to tear down so hard to believe  
  
Too may dreamers are fading shine on shine on shine  
  
Live theres a life to live  
Give theres a gift to give  
Yes theres a reason to make it  
Shine on and make it true  
Work make it work for you  
Yes theres a reason to make it shine  
  
Find a secret and learn it find a key there and turn it  
Do whatever you do through the night  
A skill in your fingers like a memory lingers  
You gotta do it till it comes out right  
You never know till you take a chance  
If youre out on that wire you might as well dance
