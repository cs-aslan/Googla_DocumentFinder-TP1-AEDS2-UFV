There is nothing new  
Put in front of you  
Nothing you dont understand  
Dont try to rationalize  
No one hears your lies  
Only you can comprehend  
  
You dont want to see  
You dont want to hear  
You dont want to feel at all  
Tell me that youve tries  
Mind is open wide  
But youre not listening at all  
  
Please dont question me I dont have the time  
If theres a problem that its easier to set aside  
There is nothing that will make you want to change your mind  
You cant take it  
You cant make it  
You cant make it so why try
