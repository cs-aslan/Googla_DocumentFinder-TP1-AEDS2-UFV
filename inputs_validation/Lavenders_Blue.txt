Lavenders blue  
Dilly dilly  
Lavenders green  
  
When I am King  
Dilly dilly  
You shall be Queen  
  
Who told you so  
Dilly dilly  
Who told you so  
  
Twas my own heart  
Dilly dilly  
That told me so  
  
Call up your men  
Dilly dilly  
Set them to work  
  
Some to the plow  
Dilly dilly  
Some to the fork  
  
Some to make hay  
Dilly dilly  
Some to cut corn  
  
While you and I  
Dilly dilly  
Keep ourselves warm  
  
Lavenders green  
Dilly dilly  
Lavenders blue  
  
If you love me  
Dilly dilly  
I will love you  
  
Let the birds sing  
Dilly dilly  
Let the lambs play  
  
We shall be safe  
Dilly dilly  
Out of harms way  
  
I love to dance  
Dilly dilly  
I love to sing  
  
When I am Queen  
Dilly dilly  
Youll be my King  
  
Who told me so  
Dilly dilly  
Who told me so  
  
I told myself  
Dilly dilly  
I told me so
