Mother mother ocean Ive heard you call  
Wanted to sail upon your waters  
Since I was three feet tall  
Youve seen it all youve seen it all  
  
Watch the men who rode you  
Switch from sails to steam  
And in your belly you can hold the treasures  
Few have ever seen  
Most of them dream  
Most of them dream  
  
Yes I am a pirate two hundred years too late  
Cannons dont thunder theres nothin to plunder  
Im an over forty victim of fate  
Arriving too late arriving too late  
  
But Ive done a bit of smugglin  
Ive run my share of grass  
Made enough money to buy Miami  
But I pissed it away so fast  
Never meant to last  
Never meant to last  
  
I have been drunk now for over two weeks  
Passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks  
But Ive got to stop wishin got to go fishin  
Im down to rock bottom again  
Just a few friends  
Just a few friends  
  
I go for younger women lived with several awhile  
Though I ran them away they come back one day  
And still could manage a smile  
It just takes awhile just takes awhile  
  
Mother mother ocean after all my years Ive found  
Occupational hazard be my occupations just not around  
Feel like Ive drowned but all were frowned  
Feel like Ive drowned
