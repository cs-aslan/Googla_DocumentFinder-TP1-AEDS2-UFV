Ive got no time for fairy stories  
Im not a little girl  
So you can leave me all alone  
And turn off the lights as well  
If you were frightened  
Then listen  
But I dont think youd like it  
Such a nice kid  
  
Nobodys lookin now  
I throw my toys around  
  
Somebodys bein very bad  
I wonder who it can be  
Somebodys goin to get in trouble  
I know it isnt me  
  
Im just a little angel  
But you dont know what Ive done  
When your backs turned  
Nobodys lookin now  
I throw my toys around  
  
Pick up those building blocks  
Chop off the babys locks  
Swing dolly by the hair  
Put down that teddy bear  
Slam dunk that happy clown  
I throw my toys around  
  
Ive got no time for bedtime stories  
Im not a little child  
Everything makes me furious  
And everything makes me wild  
  
If you were frightened  
Then whistle  
And theyll come runnin to you  
As you boohoo  
  
Nobodys looking now  
I throw my toys around  
I throw my toys around  
repeat and fade
