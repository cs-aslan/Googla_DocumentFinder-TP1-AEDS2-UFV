Im climbin this ladder  
My head in the clouds  
I hope that it matters  
Im havin my doubts  
  
Im watchin the skaters  
Fly by on the lake  
Ice frozen six feet deep  
How long does it take  
  
I look out on peaceful lands  
With no war nearby  
An ocean of shakin hands  
That grab at the sky  
  
Im singin this borrowed tune  
I took from the Rolling Stones  
Alone in this empty room  
Too wasted to write my own  
  
Im climbin this ladder  
My heads in the clouds  
I hope that it matters
