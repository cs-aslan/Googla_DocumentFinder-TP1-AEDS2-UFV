The landscape is changing  
The landscape is crying  
Thousands of acres of forest are dying  
Carbon copies from the hills above the forest line  
Acid streams are flowing ill across the countryside  
  
Cause I dont care if youre going nowhere  
Just take good care of the world  
I dont case if youre going nowhere  
Just take good care of the world  
  
Now were rearranging  
Theres no use denying  
Mountains and valleys cant you hear them sighing  
Evolution the solution or the certainty  
Can you imagine this intrusion of their privacy  
  
Token gestures some semblance of intelligence  
Can we be blamed for the security of ignorance
