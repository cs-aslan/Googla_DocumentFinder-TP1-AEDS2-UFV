I want to feel my earth turn over baby  
In this hardened winter ground  
Feel my earth turn over darlin  
Until Im rootless and unbound  
I want to feel my body tremble  
When theres no one else around  
Just this cool clear water runnin  
In this love that Ive found  
Hey baby  
See how it can be  
Every time you reveal yourself to me  
Ill come runnin  
I want to feel myself go under baby  
Where the deepest river bleeds  
I want to feel it pull me under darlin  
Until it drops me to my knees  
I want to know that I could find you  
When theres no more eyes to see  
In this cool clear water runnin  
Youll come runnin to me  
Hey baby  
All my life I have known theres something more  
Love to blind me like the sun  
Deep in dreams I will wash upon your shore  
Now I know that youre the one  
And when I feel my baby callin  
Its like a whisper in a sand  
When the softest rain is fallin darlin  
I will crumble in your hand  
And when all thats left is wonder  
And no need to understand  
Well this cool clear water runnin  
Will be all that I am  
Hey baby  
Will be all that I am  
All that I am
