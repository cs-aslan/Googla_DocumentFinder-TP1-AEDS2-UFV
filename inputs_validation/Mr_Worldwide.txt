Pitbull  
IIIIm involved in the music business  
But the funny thing is half of these fools  
Dont know music dont know business  
Have no business in music what is this  
I learned from the best stayed away from the worst  
Now I send off every verse in a hearse  
Now the every day is 15th and the 1st  
No more food stamps  church  
These boys cant get past 3rd Bass  
They a bunch of Mcs Serchn  
I can care less and you can give  
A fat babys ass if they cars got curtains  
They rap for the block I speak to the globe  
I got them models they holla at them hoes  
Better do your homework babito  
I took the threeohfive worldwide  
I took the threeohfive worldwide wide repeats  
  
Chorus
