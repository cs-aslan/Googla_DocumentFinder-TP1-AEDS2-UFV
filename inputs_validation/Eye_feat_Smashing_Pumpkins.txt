I lie I wait  
I stop I hesitate  
I am I breathe  
I meant I think of me  
  
Is it any wonder I cant sleep  
All I have is all you gave to me  
Is it any wonder I found peace through you  
Turn to the gates of heaven to myself be damned  
Turn away from light  
Its not enough just a touch  
Its not enough  
  
I taste I love  
I come I bleed enough  
I hate Im not  
I was I want too much  
  
Is it any wonder I cant sleep  
All I have is all you gave to me  
Is it any wonder I found peace through you  
Turn to the gates of heaven to myself be damned  
Turn away from light  
Its not enough just a touch  
Its not enough just a touch  
Its not enough just a touch  
Its not enough just a touch  
Its not enough just a touch  
Its not enough just a touch
