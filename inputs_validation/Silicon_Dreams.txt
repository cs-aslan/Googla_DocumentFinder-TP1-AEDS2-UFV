Daily in the news and on the screen  
They want to show you how to look like  
How to be a star  
But if you bignosed without muscles  
You are not attractive  
You dont fit in whats so popular  
Four pounds too much without a suntang  
Selfrespect is fading  
They already tooked away your pride  
California dreamgirl with her brain down in her pussy  
You will never reach her youre too small  
  
Wake up all you idiots dont close your eyes  
And see there is only one thing you can be  
This is just you and nothing else  
Start to believe all in yourself  
Stop to running after visions you dont need  
  
Who is in the mirror  
Do you really trust this face  
Smiles at you so bad and ugly  
This is not yourself anymore  
Will a soul feel well in plastic bodies  
Where it dont belong  
Silicon and lifted faces  
Dont you really know who you are  
  
Dont try to hide  
If you dont look like monroe  
The smile on your face this is real  
Just be yourself thats the deal  
  
California dream man  
With a smile made out of plastic  
Juicy woman dreams that you can buy  
Selling you a dream so far away  
And so fantastic until you realise you wont get high  
  
Now youre close to suicide  
Your dream bursts like a bubble  
All the gossip you once liked is gone  
Your addiction to be skinny is driving you to madness  
I hope now you can see what you have done
