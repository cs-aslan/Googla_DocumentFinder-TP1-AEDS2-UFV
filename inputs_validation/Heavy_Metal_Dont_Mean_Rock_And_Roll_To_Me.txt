Some days I think this old machine is out to get me  
Some days she does what I tell her  
Its like dancing with the widowmaker forty hours a week  
Im talkin bout a big old D10 Caterpillar  
  
I dont know why I like to drive em like I do  
It aint nothin but a hundred and seventyfive thousand pounds of steel  
Could be the money babe could be the power  
Could be I love the way it feels  
Could be I love the way it feels  
  
But you know shes mighty unforgivin and you got to pay attention  
Cause the d10 can be the death of you  
But I get her all fired up and I can feel it in my soul  
And its hard to tell just whos drivin who  
  
I can move Alaska all the way to Beirut  
I can bulldoze a beeline from here to Peru  
I can push the rocky mountains into the sea  
You know heavy metal dont mean rock and roll to me  
  
Im like a modern day mule skinner drivin ten thousand mules  
So say a little prayer every day  
Lord just let me get her turned around without fallin off this mountain  
You know the boss man dont like us treatin his D10 that way  
  
I dont know why I like to drive em like I do  
It aint nothin but a hundred and seventyfive thousand pounds of steel  
Could be the money babe could be the power  
Could be I love the way it feels  
Could be I love the way it feels  
  
Could be I love the way it feels  
Could be I love the way it feels
