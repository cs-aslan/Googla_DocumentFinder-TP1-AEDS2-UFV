With a minutes silence for the dead  
And a minutes silence for the longlost lovers  
No ones really in the mood for beer  
  
With a minutes silence for the child  
And a minutes silence for the grieving mothers  
Theres not much talking going down here  
  
With a minutes silence for the girl  
With a minutes silence for the younger brother  
Things have never been so clear  
  
With a minutes silence for your friend  
With a minutes silence for your longlost folk  
A minutes silence lasts a year  
  
A minutes silence seems a year  
  
And the park is filled with pain  
For this age has laid its claim  
And the streets about to cry  
Cos it longs for passersby  
It longs for passersby
