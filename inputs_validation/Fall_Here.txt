When youre ready for love  
And youve conquered your fear  
And you wanna fall baby  
Fall here  
  
When youve had enough hurt  
And youre tired of the tears  
If you wanna fall baby  
Fall here  
  
Youre broken and jaded  
Say loves overrated  
But I say girl aint that a shame  
With all that he put you through  
I cant really blame you  
But dont let some fool give us all a bad name  
  
When youre ready for love  
And youve conquered your fear  
If you wanna fall baby  
Fall here  
  
When youve had enough hurt  
And youre tired of the tears  
If you wanna fall baby  
Fall here  
  
Fall here  
Right into my world right into my world  
Let me catch you girl  
Let me be the one  
Let me be the one  
  
When youre ready for love  
When youre ready for love  
If you wanna fall I wont let you down girl  
Oh baby let go  
  
When youre ready for love  
And youve conquered your fear  
And youre tired of the tears  
Baby fall baby fall here  
Yeah baby fall here  
Oh baby fall here
