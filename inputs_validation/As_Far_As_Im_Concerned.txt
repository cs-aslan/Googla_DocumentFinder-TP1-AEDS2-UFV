As far as Im concerned I dont believe the words  
They say about you as far as Im concerned  
I think its time they learn that nothing I have heard  
Could make me doubt you as far as Im concerned  
As far as Im concerned Id rather be unhappy dear with you  
Than to look for happiness with someone new  
For always in my heart therell be a flame that burns  
For you alone dear as far as Im concerned  
As far as Im concerned Id rather be unhappy dear with you  
Than to look for happiness with someone new  
For always in my heart therell be a flame that burns  
For you alone dear as far as Im concerned
