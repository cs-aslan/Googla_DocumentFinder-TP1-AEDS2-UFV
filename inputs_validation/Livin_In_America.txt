Straight outta school but still just a fool  
Thought the streets were paved with gold  
He moved off the block and  
Found he was lost  
In a world hed never known  
He had to hustle so he could pay the rent  
Played all the aces and wound up president  
You see its okay  
Got to find your own way  
Keep on trying all day  
And you know your time will come  
Youll get your chance to run  
  
Youre livin in America  
Youre livin in the home of the dream  
Youre livin in America  
Just make it what you want it to be  
  
Soap opera child with hope in her eyes  
Lookin for a starrin role  
She came into town and acted the clown  
Had a long long way to go  
Waitin on tables and pumpin gasoline  
She served and agent  
Now shes a movie queen  
You see its okay  
Got to find your own way  
Keep on tryin all day  
And you know the time will come  
For each and everyone  
  
Youre livin in America  
Youre livin in the home of the dream  
Youre livin in America  
Just make it what you want it to be  
  
Youll stand alone on a long hard road  
With a crowd that you cant see  
Just start by steppin out  
Then let your mind run free  
  
Youre livin in America  
Youre livin in the home of the dream  
Youre livin in America  
Just make it what you want it to be  
  
Its okay  
Youre livin in the USA  
Find your dream  
You know that dream can set  
You free
