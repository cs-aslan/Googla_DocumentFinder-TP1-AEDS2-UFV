As I look into the eyes of Victoria  
Enter the Puppet Master and his wife  
I cant speak Im in shock  
  
Human skulls ancient books  
A strange symbol on the wall black candles burning low  
  
In the gloomy light I see an altar in white  
Oh what is it for It must be a Ritual  
  
In glass jars up on shelves  
I see liquid dark as Hell theres one for every Puppet  
  
I hear the Masters voice magic words from ancient times  
Im feeling strange inside  
Oh as if something has taken my mind  
  
I hear the Masters voice magic words from ancient times  
Im feeling strange inside  
Oh as if something has taken my mind  
In panic I kick the shelf with all the jars  
One of them falls from high above to the floor  
Red Oh so red its blood  
How dare you disturb my work  
  
Demon skull red as Blood  
Its in the symbol on the wall theres something deadly wrong  
  
I feel a sting in my eyes as theyre given eternal life  
All because of the Blood on the floor interrupted Ritual  
  
I hear the Masters voice magic words from ancient times  
Im feeling strange inside  
Oh as if something has taken my mind  
He lures away my soul from its shelter and into the cold  
To him my soul is gold  
Trading souls with this Demon is something he knows  
As well as Hell  
Magic life is his return  
Pain in my skin sin  
I feel some kind of Magic inside
