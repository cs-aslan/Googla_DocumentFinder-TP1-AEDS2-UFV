Happiness  
More or less  
Its just a change in me  
Something in my liberty  
Oh my my  
Happiness  
Coming and going  
I watch you look at me  
Watch my fever growing  
I know just where I am  
  
But how many corners do I have to turn  
How many times do I have to learn  
All the love I have is in my mind  
  
Well Im a lucky man  
With fire in my hands  
  
Happiness  
Something in my own place  
Im standing naked  
Smiling I feel no disgrace  
With who I am  
  
Happiness  
Coming and going  
I watch you look at me  
Watch my fever growing  
I know just who I am  
  
But how many corners do I have to turn  
How many times do I have to learn  
All the love I have is in my mind  
  
I hope you understand  
I hope you understand  
  
Gotta love thatll never die  
  
Happiness  
More or less

Watch my fever growing

Gotta love thatll never die  
No no

Its just a change in me  
Something in my liberty  
Its just a change in me  
Something in my liberty  
Its just a change in me
