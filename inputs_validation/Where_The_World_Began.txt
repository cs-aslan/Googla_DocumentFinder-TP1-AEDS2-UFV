Im tired of being grateful for a chance to take a dive  
Im sick of everything I do just to keep myself alive  
When you cut away the skin that bears the brand  
Standin in the darkness baby there I am  
  
Standin in the darkness  
Someone call my name out  
Standin in the darkness  
Someone put the flame out  
Standin in the darkness  
Baby there I am  
Where the world began  
  
Saw the man in Jamaica he had a shadow on his back  
I recalled the ring of fire and he wore his suit of black  
When the legend and the ocean meet the sand  
Standin in the darkness baby there I am  
  
Standin in the darkness  
Someone call my name out  
Standin in the darkness  
Someone put the flame out  
Standin in the darkness  
Baby there I am  
Where the world began  
  
Everyone is so fabulous hey we all got our gun  
Old Snakeys not a sinner no he just shows us how its done  
When you separate the wretched from the damned  
Standin in the darkness baby there I am  
  
Standin in the darkness  
Someone call my name out  
Standin in the darkness  
Someone put the flame out  
Standin in the darkness  
Baby there I am  
Where the world began
