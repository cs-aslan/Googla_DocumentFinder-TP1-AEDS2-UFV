Big lies  
Surprise  
Youve thought of everything  
It builds your character you know  
No way  
Ok  
So whats the price you pay  
Too late to realize youre broke  
  
Do you think that everything worked out  
Its good to see youve finally made it  
Cant you see youre lying to yourself  
  
But this was all your choice  
Do you think it makes a difference now  
But this was all your choice  
Its good to see it hasnt changed you  
  
Youve tried  
Denied  
Cant win at everything  
Its building character you know  
Dont wait  
Too late  
Youve got a choice to make  
Its time to do what youve been told  
  
Arent you glad that everything worked out  
Its good to see youve finally made it  
Cant you see youre lying to yourself
