Sometimes you be  
Blowin my mind  
If you were mine  
Id take my time  
With you but on the low  
Im shy though  
I front like Im  
So next level fly  
With them other guys  
Really I wanna reach out  
And just touch you  
If you could only realize  
How much I like to  
Come knock knockin  
At your door  
Give ol girl the heave ho  
And give a demonstration  
Of what its like  
  
When its 4 real 4 real  
100 percent 4real  
Hotter than cable tv  
Like something  
Out of your dreams  
Its 4 real 4 real  
Million percent the deal  
So Ill just keep doin me  
And eventually youll see  
Im 4 real 4 real

All my friends say  
Im wastin  
My time on you  
Tryin to dissuade me  
With schemes  
Wanna make you  
Less than you seem  
But Im not that one  
To listen to dumb  
Chicks that want to be  
Where Im gonna be  
Really I wanna reach out  
And just touch you  
If you could only realize  
How much Id like to  
Lay myself  
Down next to you  
Fall asleep  
Watching cartoons  
And wake you up  
With somethin good  
Cause its real  
  
When its 4 real 4 real  
100 percent 4real  
Hotter than cable tv  
Like something  
Out of your dreams
