Since you came into my life  
Its the same old situation  
Empty days and lonely nights  
Filled with bitterness and frustration  
  
Walking lonely in the cold  
Tryin to find the answer  
Spend my money on a crystal ball  
And the charms of a gypsy dancer  
Tryin to break the spell you hold on me  
  
Chorus  
Youre miss misery  
That song you lay on me  
Set me free set me free  
Please please please  
  
Everyday is filled with shame  
My nights are filled with anger  
Hollow lies forced denial  
If you told the truth I cant remember  
  
You know Ive got to find my way  
Got to find a reason  
Got to find your weakness  
So I can end your witchin season  
Got to break the spell you hold on me  
  
Chorus  
  
Cant think how I got myself  
Caught up in this nightmare  
Evil schemes midnight screams  
Come on somebody listen to my prayer  
  
Id give all Ive got to give  
Just to find my way out  
Got it going but I cant let go  
Im trapped on this crazy round about  
Tryin to break the spell you hold on me  
  
Chorus
