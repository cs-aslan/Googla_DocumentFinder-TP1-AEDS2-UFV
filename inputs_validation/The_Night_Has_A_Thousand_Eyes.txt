They say that youre a run around lover  
Tho you say it isnt so  
But if you put me down for another  
Ill know believe me  
Ill know  
cause the night has a thousand eyes  
And a thousand eyes cant help but see  
If you arent true to me  
So remember when you tell those  
Little white lies that the night  
Has a thousand eyes  
One of these days youre gonna be sorry  
cause your game im gonna play  
And youll find out without really trying  
Each time that my kisses stray  
That the night has a thousand eyes  
And a thousand eyes will see me through  
And no matter what i do  
I could never disguise  
All those little white lies  
cause the night has a thousand eyes  
So remember when you tell those  
Little white lies that the night  
Has a thousand eyes
