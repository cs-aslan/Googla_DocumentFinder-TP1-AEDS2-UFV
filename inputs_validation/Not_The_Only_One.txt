I was in a daze movin in the wrong direction  
Feelin that Id always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin that I wasnt the only one  
The lonely one  
  
One chance intervention see what it can signify  
The slightest misapprehension baby  
And wed have passed each other by  
When I heard your sweet voice callin  
Saw your light come shinin through  
I couldnt stop my heart from turning  
Churnin out my love for you my love to you  
  
I was in a daze movin in the wrong direction  
Feelin that Id always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin that I wasnt the only one  
The lonely one  
  
True love or perfection  
It seems like its overdue  
Then just when you least expect it  
It comes sneakin up on you  
When I thought that I was dreaming  
Felt your body close to mine  
Now love takes on a different meaning  
Together till the end of time  
  
I was in a daze movin in the wrong direction  
Feelin that Id always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin that I wasnt the only one  
The lonely one  
  
I was in a daze movin in the wrong direction  
Feelin that Id always be the lonely one  
then I saw your face on the edge of my horizon  
whisperin that I wasnt the only one  
The lonely one
