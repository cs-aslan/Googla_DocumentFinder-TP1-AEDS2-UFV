I feel a separation coming on  
Cause I know that you want to be moving on  
  
And I wish that it would snow tonight  
You pull me in avoid a fight  
Cause I feel  
A separation coming on  
  
Just prove that there is nothing left to try  
Cause the truth  
Id rather wed just both deny  
  
You kiss me with those open eyes  
It says so much  
Its no surprise to you  
But Ive got something left to say  
  
Chorus  
Dont surrender surrender surrender  
Please remember remember December  
We were so in love back then  
Are you listening  
To what they say  
Dont go that way  
Remember remember December  
Please remember  
  
Dont surrender  
  
You said you wouldnt let them change your mind  
Cause when were together fire melts the ice  
Our hearts are both on overdrive  
Come with me lets run tonight  
Dont let  
These memories be left behind  
  
Chorus  
  
I remember us together  
With the promise of forever  
We can do this  
Fight the pressure  
Please remember December  
  
Dont surrender  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont surrender
