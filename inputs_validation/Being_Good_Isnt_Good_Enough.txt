Being good isnt good enough  
Being good wont be good enough  
When I fly I must fly extra high  
And Ill need special wings so far to go  
From so far below  
  
Should I try  
Am I strong enough  
Is there time have I long enough  
Gotta fly and if I fall  
Thats the way its gotta be  
Theres no other way for me  
Being good just wont be good enough  
Ill be the best or nothing at all
