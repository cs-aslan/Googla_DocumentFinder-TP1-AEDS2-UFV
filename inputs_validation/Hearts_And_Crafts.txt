Handing me a looking glass  
You asked me who it was I saw  
But if I was to answer you  
You know Id surely answer wrong  
  
Cause Ive loved you too long  
Ive loved you too long  
  
Turning halfway toward the sun  
You asked me to become your shade  
But why should I be made to run  
At the end of the parade  
  
Love is not that way at all  
Love is not that way  
  
Looking back now toward the start  
You said you thought Id lost my path  
And I asked if you still considered love an art  
And you said No I think its more a craft  
  
And I just turned and laughed  
I just had to turn and laugh
