Verse 1  
Ive spent enough time alone  
Up in my bedroom at home  
Been kinda bored lately  
I hate on all I see  
Its all mundane to me  
This box I painted pains me  
But you could watch me  
You could help me down the rabbit hole with you  
I could go with you  
You could lead the way Id go hand in hand with you  
  
Chorus  
Oh oh oh  
Todays the day Ive been waiting for  
Tomorrow wont come after all  
Yesterday is so far away  
And today is the only day  
Somebody please stop the clock  
Oh oh oh  
Dont ever let this day stop  
Oh oh oh  
I never wanna go home  
No no no oh oh oh  
No no no  
No no no no no  
Oh oh oh  
  
Verse 2  
I used to want to grow up  
I thought that I could be free  
But now Im realizing  
Its cool it aint for me  
Its cool cause all my dreams  
Are more than possibilities  
I get so vicious  
When I dont feel delicious  
I just need a friend  
So much to carry  
These days are kinda scary I dont want the fun to end  
  
Chorus  
Oh oh oh  
Todays the day Ive been waiting for  
Tomorrow wont come after all  
Yesterday is so far away  
And today is the only day  
Somebody please stop the clock  
Oh oh oh  
Dont ever let this day stop  
Oh oh oh  
I never wanna go home  
No no no  
No no no  
No no no no no no no  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
  
Bridge

Imma say todays my day  
Imma say its gonna go my way  
  
Imma say todays my day  
Imma say todays my day  
Imma say todays my day  
Imma say its gonna go my way  
  
Chorus  
Oh oh oh  
Todays the day Ive been waiting for  
Tomorrow wont come after all
