Well I came down here from manhattan  
To see the lights on the mall  
But when I got here early this morning  
Well I couldnt see any at all  
So I walked a little further  
And much to my surprise  
There was a hot cool woman  
In a chevy staring into my eyes  
Ive just got to see the lights  
Ive just got to see the lights  
Ive just got to see the lights  
Alright  
She said now dont walk any further  
Just jump into my car  
And we can head on down the highway  
But youd better not go too far  
Cause my daddy hes big business  
So weve gotta be back by tonight  
But we can still have some fun now  
If we head on downtown to see the lights  
Ive just got to see the lights  
Ive just got to see the lights  
Ive just got to see the lights  
Ive just got to see the lights  
Ive just got to see the lights  
Ive just got to see the lights  
Well we ended up in this cafe  
Bout twentyfive minutes to one  
See she took me to this nightclub  
And the music went on and on  
Well we were set down to get coffee  
When in walked her old man  
No matter how we tried to explain it well  
We couldnt make him understand  
Ive just got to see the lights  
Ive just got to see the lights  
Ive just got to see the lights
