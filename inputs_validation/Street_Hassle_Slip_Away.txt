Believe me thats just a lie  
Thats what she tells her friends  
Theres a real song the real song  
She wont even admit it to herself  
Narrow heart the song lets the people know  
Its a painful song  
Itll only say the truth  
It lasts for sad songs  
Twenty for wish  
Wish it wont make it so a pretty kiss and a pretty face  
Cant have its way  
Therere tramps like us who were born to pay  
  
Love has gone away  
And theres no one here now  
And theres nothing left to way  
But oh how I miss him baby  
Oh baby come on and slip away  
Come on baby why dont you slip away  
  
Love has gone away  
Took the rings of my fingers  
And theres nothing left to say  
But oh how oh how I need you baby  
Come on baby I need you baby  
Oh please dont slip away  
I need your loving so bad baby please dont slip away
