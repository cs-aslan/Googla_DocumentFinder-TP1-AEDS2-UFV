See the pyramids along the Nile  
Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle  
Just remember darling all the while  
You belong to me  
  
See the marketplace in old Algiers  
Send me photographs and souvenirs  
But just remember when a dream appears  
You belong to me  
  
Ill be so alone without you  
Maybe youll be lonesome too  
  
Fly the ocean in a silver plane  
Watch the jungle when its wet with rain  
Just remember till youre home again  
You belong to me  
You belong to me  
  
Ill be so alone without you  
Maybe youll be lonesome too  
  
Fly the ocean in a silver plane  
Watch the jungle when its wet with rain  
Just remember till youre home again  
You belong to me  
You belong to me  
You belong to me
