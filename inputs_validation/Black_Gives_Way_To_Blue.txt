I dont want to feel no more  
Its easier to keep falling  
Imitations are pale  
Emptiness all tomorrows  
  
Haunted by your ghost  
  
Lay down black gives way to blue  
Lay down Ill remember you  
  
Fading out by design  
Consciously avoiding changes  
Curtains drawn now its done  
Silencing all tomorrows  
  
Forcing a goodbye  
  
Lay down black gives way to blue  
Lay down Ill remember you
