If Im not the one you want  
Take your time to figure out  
Im staring at your picture every night  
The scent of you still lingers in my mind  
I wonder if youll only feel alright  
And the sun has come out of the clouds  
And sometimes when I listen to our song  
The night seems so cold and far too long  
I want to call you up cause in the end  
I keep writing letters to my garbage can  
Lately it feels like Im goin crazy  
Baby come and lay down beside me  
If Im not the one you want  
Whos he  
Take your time to figure out  
Youll see  
If Im not the one you want  
Then maybe  
Ill be the one you need  
I feel like its on you I can depend  
Wish I could turn back the hands of time  
Enough of building castles in the sand  
Why cant we be forever  
Lately it feels like Im goin crazy  
Baby come and lay down beside me  
If Im not the one you want  
Then whos he  
Take your time to figure out  
Youll see  
If Im not the one you want  
Then maybe  
Ill be the one you need  
If Im not the one you want  
Then whos he  
Take your time to figure out  
Youll see  
If Im not the one you want  
Then maybe  
Ill be the one you need  
  
Somewhere in the back of my mind  
I know that you will be mine  
Somehow I wish I could rewind  
Leave all the worries behind  
  
If Im not the one you want Ill be the one you need  
Take your time to figure out  
Ill be the one you need  
  
If Im not the one you want  
Then whos he  
Take your time to figure out  
And youll see  
If Im not the one you want  
Then maybe  
Ill be the one you need  
  
Ill be the one you need
