Gitchy goomy gitchy gaddy sit you laddie down on your daddys knee  
And aint it a nice place to be  
Goggin noggin papas rockin like a mockin bird in a windy tree  
And that aint no place for me  
Been there one time been there two times  
Been there three times more than I care to be  
But were gonna make it through Gitchy Goomy  
Life is good life is fine life is warm  
Life is kind can you see it  
Love is great love is right  
Keeps you warm late at night when you need it  
Baby boy daddys joy lifes a toy  
But you dont want to break it  
Like a sweet symphony all you need is the key you can play it

Been there three times more than I care to say  
But youre gonna be OK Gitchy Goomy  
Life is good life is fine life is warm

Keeps you warm late at night when you need it  
Baby boy daddys joy lifes a toy  
But you dont want to break it  
Like a sweet symphony all you need is the key you can play it  
Been there one time been there two times
