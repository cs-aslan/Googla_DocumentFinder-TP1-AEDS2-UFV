Dont sing me lullabies  
I wont close my eyes  
I cant close my eyes  
Its true  
Im doomed  
til dawn  
Shines through  
Got too many things to do  
Got friends to see  
I cant miss a thing  
Its true  
Im through  
Im screwed  
Unglued  
  
I wont close my eyes I cant close my eyes  
I never close my eyes  
You see theyre always there with funny hair  
Oh Im so scared  
  
It happens to me every night  
Cant sleep the clowns will eat me  
They always want to take a bite  
Cant sleep the clowns will eat me  
And if you think this isnt real  
Ill show you wounds that never heal  
To them Im just a happy meal  
Cant sleep the clowns will eat me  
  
Make the coffee black as night  
Help me through the night  
I know their appetite for me  
Im meat  
But Im sweet  
As can be  
And if I do too much booze  
I begin to snooze  
I hear the big old floppy shoes  
Its true  
Im stew  
Unchewed  
  
I wont close my eyes I cant close my eyes  
I never close my eyes  
See theyre always there with that funny hair  
Oh Im so scared  
  
It happens to me every night  
Cant sleep the clowns will eat me  
They always want to take a bite  
Cant sleep the clowns will eat me  
And if you think this isnt real  
Ill show you wounds that never heal  
To them Im just a happy meal  
Cant sleep the clowns will eat me
