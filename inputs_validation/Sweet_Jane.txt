Standin on a corner  
Suitcase in my hand  
Jacks in his corset Jane shes in her vest  
Me babe Im in a rock n roll band  
Riding that Stutz Bearcat Jim  
Those were different times  
All the poets studied rules of verse  
And the ladies they rolled their eyes  
  
Sweet Jane Sweet Jane Sweet Jane  
  
Now Jack he is a banker  
And Jane she is a clerk  
And the both of them save their money  
And when they come home from work  
Sittin by the fire  
Radio just played that classical music for all you protest kids  
The march of the wooden soldiers  
And you can hear Jack say  
  
Sweet Jane Sweet Jane Sweet Jane  
  
Some people like to go out dancing  
And other people like me they gotta work  
And theres even some evil mothers  
Theyll tell you life is just made out of dirt  
That women never really faint  
That villans always blink their eyes  
And that children are the only ones who blush  
And that life is just to die  
But anyone who has a heart  
Wouldnt turn around and break it  
And anyone who ever played a part  
He wouldnt turn around and hate it  
  
Sweet Jane
