Old mister fun is back  
Wonder where hes been hiding at  
Hanging round the edge  
Walls unfortified inside  
  
No different patchwork hack  
Toil away on an unlaid track  
Falls closing in got nowhere to hide  
This time  
  
Finding ceilings low  
Im too big or this rooms too small  
Whys my ceiling anothers floor  
  
Past twisted expected wrap  
Attention span increasingly short  
Hard to breathe this altitude will get you high  
Ive tried  
  
Finding ceilings low  
Im too big or this rooms too small  
Whys my ceiling anothers floor  
  
And nobody can tell you  
Its a moment in time  
That defines and deforms you  
  
Finding ceilings low  
Im too big or this rooms too small  
Whys my ceiling anothers floor  
  
And nobody can tell you  
Its your moment in time  
  
Write me over false reporter  
Cant you let me shine  
Write me over false reporter  
Cant you let me shine  
  
And nobody can tell you  
Its a moment in time  
That defines and deforms you
