I was so lonely without you baby dont know what Im gonna do  
Im goin crazy without you baby look at what Im goin through  
How many times must I tell you I love  
Tell you I love you times before  
Dont believe that Im worth all your kisses  
Im worth more then this  but you ignore  
  
How many birds will I see high and flying  
How many birds will it take till I get you  
I will be crying yeah  
  
Maybe tomorrow youll come walkin my way  
Come talkin my way  youll find out  
My love for you will be stronger then truer  
Ill look at you and theres no doubt  
  
How many birds will I see high and flying  
How many birds will it take till I get you  
I will be crying yeah  
  
I was so lonely without you baby dont know what Im gonna do  
Im going crazy without you baby look at what Im goin through  
Baby baby baby  
My love until the day we say auf wiedersehen
