Warrior in woolworths  
Behind his serville innocence  
Hes the rebel on the underground  
He plots and he schemes  
Humble he may seem  
Shes the rebel of the modern town  
Hes the rebel on the underground  
His roots are in today  
Warrior in woolworths  
Shes the rebel of the modern town  
Doesnt know no history  
Warrior in woolworths  
He threw the past away  
Weapons rule their livesDips on Friday nights  
Youths meet at stockwell tube
