Lucy Rebaar shes a friend of mine  
Later shell go back and redefine the line  
Its getting longer all the time  
Oh yeah  
  
Drinking sunshine she likes the taste of it  
She had a goldmine but then she wasted it away  
You should have seen her yesterday  
Oh yeah  
  
Sent along the way  
Nothing stops the aid  
  
Sugar Daddy loves her madly  
Cosmo Shiva God oh made you a believer  
I dont need to tend her  
Why do I believe you  
Annie wants a baby now  
Annie wants a baby any way she can  
  
Missing pieces shes got a lot of em  
Time decreases I wish I thought of em before  
Before its time to close the store  
Oh yeah  
  
Installation a lonely sick of fame  
Some liberation the only seed we ever plant  
I wanna help you but I cant  
No No  
  
Sent along the way  
Nothing stops the aid  
  
Sugar Daddy loves her madly  
Love her leave her God oh made you a believer  
Be our soldier  
Let her now youve gotten older  
Annie wants a baby now  
Annie wants a baby any way she can

Oh yeah  
Sent along the way
