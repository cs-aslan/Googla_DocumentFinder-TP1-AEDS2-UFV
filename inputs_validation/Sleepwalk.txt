Sleepwalk  
  
Rolling and falling Im choking and calling  
Name after name after name  
  
Sleepwalk  
  
Naked and bleeding the streetlights stray by me  
Hurting my eyes with their glare  
  
Sleepwalk  
  
Helplessly breaking exchanging my faces  
Destined we had to collide  
  
Sleepwalk  
  
Taut on the outside Im crumpling and crawling  
Watching the day drag away  
Spiralling deeper I cant feel my fingers  
Rip round my throat as I dream  
  
Dream  
  
Sleepwalk
