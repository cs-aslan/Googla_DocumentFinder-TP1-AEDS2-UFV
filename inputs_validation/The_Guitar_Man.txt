Who draws the crowd and plays so loud  
Baby its the guitar man  
Whos gonna steal the show  
You know baby its the guitar man  
  
He can make you love  
He can make you cry  
He will bring you down  
Then hell get you high  
Somethin keeps him goin  
Miles and miles a day  
To find another place to play  
  
Night after night who treats you right  
Baby its the guitar man  
Whos on the radio  
You go listen to the guitar man  
  
Then he comes to town  
And you see his face  
And you think you might  
Like to take his place  
Somethin keeps him driftin  
Miles and miles away  
Searchin for the songs to play  
  
Then you listen to the music  
And you like sing along  
You want to get the meaning  
Out of each and every song  
Then you find yourself a message  
And some words to call your own  
And take them home  
  
He can make you love  
He can get you high  
He will bring you down  
Then hell make you cry  
Somethin keeps him movin  
But no one seems to know  
What it is that makes him go  
  
Then the lights begin to flicker  
And the sound is getting dim  
The voice begins to falter  
And the crowds are getting thin  
But he never seems to notice  
Hes just got to find  
Another place to play  
  
Either way  
Got to play  
Either way  
Got to play
