I asked you to stay  
But you said theres no way  
I begged  you call  
And you leave me after all  
I know Im not to blame  
I know you dont feel the same  
Didnt even tell me why  
You just left me here to die  
  
I stand I fall I bounce off these four walls  
You laugh you leave  
And you leave me here alone  
Is this how its gonna be  
Its fine for you and not for me  
Did you even care at all  
You stand I fall  
  
Im guilty too  
Giving up to you  
Well thats my one sin  
Sorry for giving in  
Didnt mean to waste your time  
Thanks for wasting mine  
Could have to tried to let me be  
Would you just set me free  
  
I stand I fall I bounce off these four walls  
You laugh you leave  
And you leave me here alone  
Is this how its gonna be  
Its fine for you and not for me  
Did you even care at all  
You stand I fall  
  
Could I pay you not to
