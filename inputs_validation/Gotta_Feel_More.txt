Ive never seen the sea seem so calm  
Ive never felt the breeze slippin through the trees  
But now Ive got you and its takin so long  
I want to see more  
I gotta feel more  
  
I never felt young til I met you  
Never felt fear til I thought about losin you  
Only a fool would think that its all true  
I want to see more  
I gotta feel more  
  
I gotta feel more more more  
Than Ive ever felt before  
There are deeper places to explore  
Ive seen the world through an eagles eye  
Ive felt the oceans roar  
I still love you to the core  
I just gotta feel more  
  
I never did believe that mountains could move  
Never did believe that the Yankees could lose  
I never thought love could come my way  
I want to see more  
I gotta feel more  
  
I never felt young til I met you  
Never felt fear til I thought about losin you  
Only a fool would think that its all true  
I want to see more  
I gotta feel more  
  
I gotta feel more more more  
Than Ive ever felt before  
There are deeper places to explore  
Ive seen the world through an eagles eye  
Ive felt the oceans roar  
I still love you to the core  
I just gotta feel more
