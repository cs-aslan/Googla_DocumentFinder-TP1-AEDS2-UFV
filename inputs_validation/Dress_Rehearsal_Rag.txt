Four oclock in the afternoon  
And I didnt feel like very much  
I said to myself Where are you golden boy  
Where is your famous golden touch  
I thought you knew where  
All of the elephants lie down  
I thought you were the crown prince  
Of all the wheels in Ivory Town  
  
Just take a look at your body now  
Theres nothing much to save  
And a bitter voice in the mirror cries  
Hey Prince you need a shave  
  
Now if you can manage to get  
Your trembling fingers to behave  
Why dont you try unwrapping  
A stainless steel razor blade  
  
Thats right its come to this  
Yes its come to this  
And wasnt it a long way down  
Wasnt it a strange way down  
  
Theres no hot water  
And the cold is running thin  
Well what do you expect from  
The kind of places youve been living in  
  
Dont drink from that cup  
Its all caked and cracked along the rim  
Thats not the electric light my friend  
That is your vision growing dim  
  
Cover up your face with soap there  
Now youre Santa Claus  
And youve got a gift for anyone  
Who will give you his applause  
  
I thought you were a racing man  
Ah but you couldnt take the pace  
Thats a funeral in the mirror  
And its stopping at your face  
  
Thats right its come to this  
Yes its come to this  
And wasnt it a long way down  
Ah wasnt it a strange way down  
  
Once there was a path  
And a girl with chestnut hair  
And you passed the summers  
Picking all of the berries that grew there  
There were times she was a woman  
Oh there were times she was just a child  
And you held her in the shadows  
Where the raspberries grow wild  
  
And you climbed the twilight mountains  
And you sang about the view  
And everywhere that you wandered  
Love seemed to go along with you  
Thats a hard one to remember  
Yes it makes you clench your fist  
  
And then the veins stand out like highways  
All along your wrist  
And yes its come to this  
Its come to this  
And wasnt it a long way down  
Wasnt it a strange way down  
  
You can still find a job  
Go out and talk to a friend  
On the back of every magazine  
There are those coupons you can send  
Why dont you join the Rosicrucians  
They can give you back your hope  
You can find your love with diagrams  
On a plain brown envelope  
  
But youve used up all your coupons  
Except the one that seems  
To be written on your wrist  
Along with several thousand dreams  
  
Now Santa Claus comes forward  
Thats a razor in his mit  
And he puts on his dark glasses  
And he shows you where to hit  
And then the cameras pan  
The stand in stunt man  
Dress rehearsal rag  
Its just the dress rehearsal rag  
You know this dress rehearsal rag  
Its just a dress rehearsal rag
