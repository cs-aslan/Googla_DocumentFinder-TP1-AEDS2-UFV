Mornin Mrs Campbell  
Lovely day today  
I heard about the fire  
I wonder what the papers say  
  
Lets see now  
Give me fifty shotgun shells  
And a hundred feet of rope  
Just add that to my bill  
  
Says here there aint no hope  
They all were burned alive  
And four packs of cigarettes  
No I think Ill make it five  
  
I heard about the wedding  
Im so happy for the bride  
Why that fire house looked mighty nice  
And the whole town swelled with pride  
  
Weve watched her grow to womanhood  
Shes found an upright man  
Shell learn this life aint easy  
You do the best you can  
  
No no my family aint so good  
My wife just had a spell  
And I cant afford the medicine  
She needs to make her well  
  
Ive been laid off at that factory  
For sixteen months or more  
I came home last Wednesday evenin  
I found her lyin on the floor  
  
Bye now Mrs Campbell  
Say howdy to your son  
You can tell him well go huntin  
When he gets a bigger gun  
  
It was too bad about that fire  
But dont you get me wrong  
Weve gotta teach these people  
How to stay where they belong
