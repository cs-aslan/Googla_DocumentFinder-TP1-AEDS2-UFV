I need a strong girl  
Cause wars where Im going  
I need a war girl  
Who wants to show em  
  
Good people want to be  
Really what they are  
But if you try you will fry  
Plenty before catching fire  
  
I need a strong girl  
Who works on tension  
I need a gendarme  
Cause Im after ascension  
  
When the guns raise hit my back  
On a naked day  
I know I will testify  
No matter what I have to say  
  
Nananananananana  
Strong girl shes like a ocean  
  
I need an eagle  
To be my scanner  
Cause a liar  
Can look like a winner  
  
All the animals  
Are running with the pack  
Im outside tell you why  
I dont wanna fight em back  
  
Strong girl shes like an ocean  
Strong girl shes like an ocean  
Yeah  
  
Strong girl shes like an ocean  
Strong girl shes like an ocean  
  
Strong girl strong girl
