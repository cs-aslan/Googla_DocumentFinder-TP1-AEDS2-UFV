Once I was young  
Yesterday perhaps  
Danced with Jim and Paul  
And kissed some other chaps  
  
Once I was young  
But never was naive  
I thought I had a trick or two  
Up my imaginary sleeve  
  
And now I know I was naive  
I didnt know what time it was  
Then I met you  
Oh what a lovely time it was  
  
How sublime it was too  
I didnt know what time it was  
You hold my hand  
Warm like the month of May it was  
  
And Ill say it was grand  
Grand to be alive to be young  
To be mad to be yours alone  
Grand tosee your face feel your touch  
  
Hear your voice say Im all your own  
I didnt know what time it was  
Live was no prize  
I wanted love and here it was  
  
Shining out of your eyes  
Im wise  
And I know what time it is now  
Once I was old   
  
Twenty years or so   
Rather well preserved  
The wrinkles didt show  
Once I was old  
  
But not too old for fun  
I used to hunt for little girls  
Up my immaginary gun  
But now I ain for only one  
  
I didnt know what time it was  
Then I met you  
Oh what a lovely time it was  
How sublime it was too  
  
I didnt know what time it was  
You hold my hand  
Warm like the month of May it was  
And Ill say it was grand  
  
Grand to be alive to be young  
To be mad to be yours alone  
Grand tosee your face feel your touch  
Hear your voice say Im all your own  
  
I didnt know what time it was  
Live was no prize  
I whanted love and here it was  
Shining out of your eyes  
  
Im wise  
And I know what time it is now
