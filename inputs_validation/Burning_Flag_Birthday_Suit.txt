Dont open life alone  
Contact the empire solutionaries  
They cut the skin  
They peel back the onion  
Reveal the ghost blood  
Fat black gas exudes  
Moves into the mirrored hall of empty values  
  
Canned sister Iowa  
Drive me to the changing room  
Where the counterfeit meets  
And brings its collection of orphans  
  
Leave them in the state grip  
The nurses hate them  
But its up to you and me  
My faithful sineater  
To give them a glorious light bath  
And remove their wrapping  
Their burning flag birthday suit
