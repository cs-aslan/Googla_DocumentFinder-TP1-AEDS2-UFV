Bells ring into the night  
Sounds like a mystery sonnet at night  
Hold your throat and Ill come together  
And see the light that goes away  
Leave my heart down by the water  
It sleeps inside my soul  
It isnt true about your father  
Just hold me down by the water  
This  black as the moonlight  
Look up to see your weakness in the sky  
Nobodys out to buy your story  
Nobody wants to know your reason why  
Hold your hands and throw the water  
In front of me to know how I feel  
Dont put it all into your hero  
Youre gone feeling  
Youre gone feeling  
Youre gone feeling  
Dont want to say that Im through with it  
Just want to be like I am inside  
Right by your side
