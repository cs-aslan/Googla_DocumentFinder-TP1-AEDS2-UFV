Its no use pretending  
Whats done is done  
And you cant turn back the clock  
Its no use pretending  
What you have said  
Will stay inside my head  
Oh its over  
I tried to please you  
But all you could do  
Was talk behind my back  
Now I see through you  
Nothing I could say or do  
Would get to you  
Youve bitten off more than you can chew  
Although Ive got to say were through  
Theres nothing I would rather do  
Than be with you  
Theres more to you than meets the eye  
I must admit you used to try  
But since youve gone the other way  
Your head is in the sky
