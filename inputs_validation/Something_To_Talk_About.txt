People are talkin bout people  
I hear them whisper you wont believe it  
They think were lovers kept under covers  
I just ignore it but they keep saying  
We laugh just a little too loud  
We stand just a little too close  
We stare just a little too long  
Maybe theyre seeing something we dont Darlin  
  
Lets give them something to talk about  
Lets give them something to talk about  
Lets give them something to talk about  
How about love  
  
I feel so foolish I never noticed  
Youd act so nervous  
Could you be falling for me  
It took a rumor to make me wonder  
Now Im convinced Im going under  
Thinking bout you every day  
Dreaming bout you every night  
Hoping that you feel the same way  
Now that we know it lets really show it Darlin  
  
Lets give them something to talk about  
Lets give them something to talk about  
Lets give them something to talk about  
How about love love love love  
  
Lets give them something to talk about  
A little mystery to figure out  
Lets give them something to talk about  
How about love love love love
