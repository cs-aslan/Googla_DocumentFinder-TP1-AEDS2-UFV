Girl this is goodbye for us  
Im afraid theres no two ways about it  
Now you say you need my love But youll just have to learn to live without it  
So goes love  
Dont try to understand it  
So goes Love  
It never goes the way you planned it  
  
When you meant the world to me  
thats the time you said you didnt want me  
You played around in front of me  
Yeah you did everything you could to taunt me  
  
So goes love  
Dont try to understand it  
So goes Love  
When it dies you cant disguise it  
  
Its been said youve made your bed  
And now you have to lie in it  
theres no denying its a shame  
But theres really no one else for you to blame  
  
So goes love  
Dont try to understand it  
So goes love  
It never goes the way you planned it
