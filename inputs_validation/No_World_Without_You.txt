The sweet perfume of flowers in bloom  
Remind me of you  
But youre more than just a memory  
The things that you do to me  
If only you knew  
  
Ive tried hard had to be strong  
Now I dont know if I can go on  
  
Chorus  
Theres no world without you  
I miss you my friend  
Theres no world without you  
This cant be the end  
  
Remember the night holding me tight  
Just me and you  
I remember the day you went away  
What was I to do  
If you came home one of these days  
Would I hold back or would I say  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive tried hard had to be strong  
Now I dont know if I can go on  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres no world without you  
This cant be the end
