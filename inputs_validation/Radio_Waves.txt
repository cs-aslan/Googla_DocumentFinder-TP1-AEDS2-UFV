From the transmitter to the receiver  
Across the ether out of your speaker  
  
Chorus  
Radio waves have life Radio waves have life  
Machines are living too theyre working for me and you  
  
From the transmitter to the receiver  
Across the ether out of your speaker  
To the baltic fleet and atlantic fleet  
Faster than the breeze over stormy seas  
  
Repeat chorus 2  
  
Through america to albania  
Over reagans head under moscows bed  
To the warsaw pact and the nato pact  
Down this cul de sac never turning back  
  
Repeat chorus
