I tried so hard just to get through to you  
But your heads so far  
From the realness of truth  
Was it just a come on in the dark  
Wasnt meant to last long  
I think youve worn your welcome honey  
Ill just see you along as I sing you this song  
  
Time can pass slowly  
Things always change  
Your days been numbered  
And Ive read your last page  
You was just a temporary love  
But honey you aint the first  
Lots of other come before you woman  
Said but you been the worst  
Said you been the worst  
  
So goodbye to you girl  
So long farewell  
I cant hear you cryin  
Your jivins been hell  
So look for me walkin  
Down your street at night  
Ill be in with another  
Deep down inside  
Deep down inside
