The very best part of Halloween  
Is getting more candy than youve ever seen  
Ive got my scariest costume on  
I scare myself when Im all alone  
  
Sun goes down Im all dressed up  
I set out to try my luck  
Walkin up and down the street  
I knock on the door and say  
  
Trick or treat trick or treat Give me something good to eat  
Trick or treat trick or treat Give me something good to eat  
  
The very first house is big and dark  
  
Trick or treat trick or treat Give me something good to eat  
Trick or treat trick or treat Give me something good to eat  
  
The very next house is big and white  
  
Trick or treat trick or treat Give me something good to eat  
Trick or treat trick or treat Give me something good to eat  
  
If you go out Halloween night  
Ill give you a tip thatll make it all right  
Smile at everyone that you meet  
Knock on the door and say  
  
Trick or treat trick or treat Give me something good to eat  
Trick or treat trick or treat Give me something good to eat
