Well Im not just a song anymore  
I just might be the whole damn score  
I might be realing in your head while  
Youre sleeping in your bed at night  
Well Im not just along anymore  
I finally found what Ive been lookin for  
I might be sitting in the passengers  
Side but not along for the ride  
Cause I have control of a home grown situation  
I lay back and then I turn the alarm off and turn out the light  
Theres goin to be some quality sleeping  
cause qualitys keeping the quality up at night  
I am fixed to lay with my arms out and learning to fly  
  
Through the darkest space  
Where I try to catch up to the catch phrase  
To human race I say let the games begin  
Under way say in conditions that we play in  
Maybe things are better this way  
May the games begin today awww  
  
Oh well Cause Im just above  
The aggrevation of love  
And I raise to opimistical fortune and toasting it twice  
Im sitting high on an anytime any day night  
And I laugh to think Im crying my eyes out well isnt it nice  
  
Chorus  
  
An open space when I finally catch up to the catch phrase  
The whole damn world is your toy  
Dont you want some love  
Dont you want things to always stay the same  
Dont you want your love to be the same as the last day
