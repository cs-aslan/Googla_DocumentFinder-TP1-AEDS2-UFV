Riding round in my Cadillac  
Thinking bout the day that I first saw you  
Nothing compares to what we had and baby that wont change  
I want you babe I still want you baby I still want you you  
  
Summer days with my honey  
Worrying about nothing  
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze  
Who knew that kiss was the last one  
I never thought we would change  
Baby Im missing you  
  
We should have been forever but we fell apart  
Might have separated but you took my heart  
Always knew I wasnt really over us  
Sometimes I catch myself  
  
Riding round in my Cadillac  
Thinking bout the day that I first saw you  
Nothing compares to what we had and baby that wont change  
I want you babe I still want you baby I still want you you  
  
Memories last forever so how could I just forget  
Made everything from nothing cause time was always spent  
  
We should have been forever but we fell apart  
Might have separated but you took my heart  
Always knew I wasnt really over us  
Sometimes I catch myself  
  
Riding round in my Cadillac  
Thinking bout the day that I first saw you  
Nothing compares to what we had and baby that wont change  
I want you babe I still want you baby I still want you you
