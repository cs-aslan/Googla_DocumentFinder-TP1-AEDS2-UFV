Who do you think is comin to town  
Youll never guess who  
Lovable hugable Emily Brown  
Miss Brown to you  
What if the rain comes pattering down  
My heaven is blue  
Can it be sending me Emily Brown  
Miss Brown to you  
I know her eyes will thrill ya  
But go slow oh oh  
Dont you all get too familiar  
Why do you think shes comin to town  
Just wait and youll see  
The lovable little Miss Brown to you  
Is baby to me yes yes  
Mark it down
