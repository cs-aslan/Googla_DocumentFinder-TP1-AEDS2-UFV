Take one last look before you leave  
Cause oh somehow it means so much to me  
And if youll ever need me you know where Ill be  
So please call home if ya change your mind  
Oh I dont mind  
  
I guess I saw it comin day by day  
But oh I could not stand the failure  
Before you leave theres just one thing I must say  
Please call home if ya change your mind  
Oh I dont mind  
  
And I know youre used to runnin  
Oh youre lost baby and I aint funnin  
But oh when you call to me well Ill come runnin  
Straight to your side again Ill confide in you  
  
So go on I wont say no more  
My heart aint in it but Ill hold the door  
But just remember what I said before  
Please call home if ya change your mind  
Please call home if ya change your mind  
Oh yeah call home if ya change your mind  
Call home if ya change your mind oh  
Please call home if ya change your mind  
Oh yeah call home baby  
Mmmhmm
