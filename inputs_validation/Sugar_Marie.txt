Well Im all gassed up  
The car is waitin outside  
I got three more hours on this losers job  
And then Ill be ready to ride  
  
I got this cowboy comin with me  
This guys name is Jeffrey Jack  
He can shoot the eyes out of a pool ball  
Hell get those young girls into the sack  
  
Well drop down to the dance hall  
Locals will be kickin up their heels  
Theyll be drinkin Tequila Sunrises  
Until the morning light fills up the window sills  
  
And then Ill be with Sugar Marie  
Shes the only girl I know that can make me forget about me  
Come on and dance with me Sugar Marie  
She dont ask me any questions when its time to leave  
  
She works down at the truck stop  
Where she polishes the spoons  
She gets colas and burgers for the boys  
On those hot summer afternoons  
  
Shes got this girlfriend named Linda  
Lindas got a tattoo that says Christ  
Well she aint half bad to talk to  
And I reckon she looks pretty nice  
  
Well drive down to the dance hall  
Sittin there waitin on me  
Jesus you know it feels pretty good  
And sometimes I need some good old company  
  
And then Ill be with Sugar Marie  
Shes the only girl I know that can make me forget about me  
Come on dance with me Sugar Marie  
And she dont ask me any questions she dont flirt with the other boys  
She belongs to me Sugar Marie Sugar Marie  
  
I never thought I needed no one  
I can make a big enough mess myself  
Oh but when I finally found someone  
And she made me forget myself  
  
Dance with me Sugar Marie  
Shes the only girl I know that can make me forget about me  
Shake that thang for me Sugar Marie  
But she dont ask me any questions when its time to leave  
  
Sugar Marie Sugar Marie  
  
Hey girl I wish we could tear the heart  
Out of this old town tonight
