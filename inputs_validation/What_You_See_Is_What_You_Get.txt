The Dramatics  
  
Some people are made of plastic  
You know some people are made of wood  
Some people have hearts of stone  
You know some people are up to no good  
  
But baby Im for real Im as real as real can get  
If what youre lookin for is real love then  
What you see is what you get  
  
What you see what you see  
Is what you get now is what you get  
X2  
Honey what you see is what you get  
And if youve found the real thing its the best thing yet  
  
Some people are made of lies  
Breed them to shame your name  
But baby I have good intentions  
  
But baby Im for real Im as real as real can get  
If what youre lookin for is real love then  
What you see is what you get  
  
What you see what you see  
Is what you get now is what you get  
X2  
Honey what you see is what you get  
And if youve found the real thing its the best thing yet  
  
But baby Im for real Im as real as real can get  
If what youre lookin for is real love then  
What you see is what you get  
  
What you see what you see  
Is what you get now is what you get  
X2  
Honey what you see is what you get  
And if youve found the real thing its the best thing yet
