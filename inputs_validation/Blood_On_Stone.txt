His bloods on stone  
Its running down the frozen wall  
His hands so cold  
Hes trying not to fall  
Oh will he make it now  
One slip and hes lost  
Its his last chance for freedom  
Its all that hes got  
He feels good so right  
Hot sweat on a cold night  
Breaking free into the wind  
Hes got nothing to lose just win  
Hes just a runaway  
Hes free now and on his way  
Hes almost home  
Just one push and  
Hell take this wall  
Its blood on stone  
From trying not to fall  
Hes made it now  
Where others have not  
Just one last jump to freedom  
Is all that hes got
