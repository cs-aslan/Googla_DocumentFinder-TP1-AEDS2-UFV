On the freeway in the county the sun dont shine  
I feel I feel I feel I feel a Bati man  
And outside my cell deputies creep  
And in this cell all I do is sleep and I dream that Im free  
And Im back on the reef  
Where I throw my net out into the sea  
All the fine hinas come swimming to me  
They hold me and they promise me things  
And when the tides high I cry like a little baby  
Dont give me no right kind a love no Sunday morning  
Dont want no puppy loving  
Hold me babe a new stylee  
Hungry babe a new stylee  
And a angry dog is a hungry dog  
And a hungry dog is a angry dog  
I feel like rocking I wanna with you  
  
Im alive gotta contact home Gotta contact my baby girl  
But I wood never could get up Why does it have to be so damn tough  
With mayates and the eses yes their steady on the floor  
Ill be damned if a man with a shake in his hand will make me feel  
I feel I feel a Bati man  
And I know that Im there someday  
  
Im back on the reef  
Where I throw my net out into the sea  
All the fine hinas come swimming to me  
Hold babe promise me  
With no protection on my erection I wont get no VD  
Dont give me no right kind a love no Sunday morning  
Dont want no puppy loving Gwarn  
Hold me babe got a new stylee  
And a angry dogs a hungry dog  
Hes a naked man is a naked man  
And a wicked dog is a hungry dog  
I feel like rocking I wanna with you
