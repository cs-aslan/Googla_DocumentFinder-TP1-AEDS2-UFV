I hear shes kickin ass across the board  
And rock two hundred thousand higher scorer  
Just in time to save the world of being taken over  
Shes a warrior  
I couldnt play again because the game  
It never end it never even landed on the can  
And never let me in to spend my quarter  
Theres no love for me no more  
  
Say it isnt so  
How she easily come how she easy go  
Please dont tell her that I miss her  
Because I dont  
  
She was the girl with the broadest shoulders  
But she would die before I crawled over them  
She is taller than I am  
She knew I wouldnt mind the view there  
Or the altitude with a mouth full of air  
She let me down and doubt came out until the now became later  
  
Say that it isnt so  
How she easily come how she easy go  
Please dont tell her that Ive been meaning to miss her  
Because I dont  
Not for her  
Its not that Im mad to forgive  
Forget what I said  
  
That Im crazy like the rest of us  
And Im crazier when Im next to her ha  
  
So why after the all of everything that came  
And went I care enough to still be singing of the bitter end and broken eras  
I told you I dont but  
I am only trying to be the best with my intent to cure  
The rest is sure to lay me ease the plural hurts of the words of reverse
psychology  
Thats easier said  
Easier than done  
Please dont dare tell her what Ive become  
Please dont mention all the attention I have drawn  
Please dont bother cause shell feel guilty when Im gone  
  
Because Im crazy like the rest of us  
And Im crazier when Im next to her  
And its amazing how shes selfassured  
And I know shed hate me if she knew my words  
Do I hurt anymore  
Do I hurt well  
I dont  
I dont  
I dont
