General Wolfe beat General Montcalm on the Plains of Abraham  
And because of this they liked him an awful lot in Kingston  
The town was named Kingston in the county Frontenac  
So they spotted an island and they called it Wolfe Island  
Oh its got a couple highways and a really nice restaurant  
Called the General Wolfe and its named after General Wolfe  
Who won a couple of battles and had an island named after him  
Its a really nice place and a good port to smuggle booze in from the States  
Oh the Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
Its a very nice ferry its the Wolfe Island Ferry  
The Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
Its a very nice ferry its the Wolfe Island Ferry  
Oh the Wolfe Island Ferry doesnt carry any wolves  
Or any source of animals except for a couple of seagulls  
Who are really lazy and so they land on the ferry  
And that way they dont have to fly all the way to Wolfe Island  
Oh the Wolfe Island Ferry doesnt carry any fairies  
Cause fairies unlike seagulls dont really mind the flying  
They fly over to Wolfe Island sprinkling fairy dust all over  
Except its really more like battery acid and it burns your skin until you die  
Well theyve got lots of potatos and Anne of Green Gables  
Oh crap thats Prince Edward Island  
Sometimes I get confused when I switch my medication  
But I can see the bunny  
Oh the Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
Its a very nice ferry its the Wolfe Island Ferry  
The Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
Its a very nice ferry its the Wolfe Island Ferry
