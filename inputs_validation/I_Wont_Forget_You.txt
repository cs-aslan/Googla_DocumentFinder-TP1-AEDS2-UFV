Late at night I close my eyes  
And think of how things could have been  
And when I look back  
I remember some words you had said to me  
  
Its better to have lost at love  
Then never to have loved at all  
  
Chorus  
I wont forget you baby  
I wont forget you  
Even though I should  
I wont forget you baby  
I wont forget you  
Even though I should yeah  
  
Sometimes in my head  
I can still see pictures of you  
And I laugh to myself  
When I think of all those crazy things that we used to do  
  
Although miles come between us  
Just between you and me  
  
Chorus  
  
I should let you fade away  
But that just wouldnt be me  
Oh baby  
  
Although miles come between us  
Just between you and me  
  
Chorus  
  
I wont forget you baby
