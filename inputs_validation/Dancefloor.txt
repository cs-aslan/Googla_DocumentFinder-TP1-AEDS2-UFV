Good times bad times baby youre in trouble  
You stole my heart and youre given me up  
And were not even friends so how can we be lovers  
I wanna know the truth  
cause Ive had enough  
Im sick and tired of pleasing you  
Have I had your love  
Is that the best you can do  
You can dream of changing my mind  
But your wasting your time  
cause if you think youve got me right just watch me  
  
On the dance floor  
Gonna lose it in the music  
On the dance floor  
Got my body gonna use it  
On the dance floor  
The best that you never had but now youve lost me  
So come on watch me getting over you  
  
Had your chance but baby you blew it  
You never loved me and baby you knew it  
And every time that you messed with my mind  
I still believed in you  
  
cause Ive had enough  
Im sick and tired of pleasing you  
Have I had your love  
Is that the best you can do  
You can dream of changing my mind  
But youre way out of line  
cause if you think youve got me  
Boy just watch me  
  
On the dance floor  
Gonna lose it in the music  
On the dance floor  
Got my body gonna use it  
On the dance floor  
The best that you never had but now youve lost me  
So come on watch me getting over you
