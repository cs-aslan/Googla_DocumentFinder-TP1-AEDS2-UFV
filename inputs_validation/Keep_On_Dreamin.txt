Words and Music by Jeff Cook and Richard Scott  
I am so happy with you in my arms  
Honey dont you ever leave  
Lay back and love me and tellme youre mine  
Keep on dreamin with me  
  
Your hair is so soft and your eyes are so brown  
Your bodys warm here next to me  
You be my woman and Ill be your man and your love is all Ill ever need  
  
It took so long for me to find you  
Ive been lonely for so long Lonely  
You came into me life to love me  
Now my loneliness is gone  
  
You cant improve on perfection  
And you are perfect for me  
Cast your love in my direction  
and I know that you will see  
  
I am so happy with you in my arms  
Honey dont you ever leave  
Lay back and love and tell me youre mine  
Keep on dreamin with me  
  
Lay back and love me and tell me youre mine  
Keep on dreamin with me  
  
Lay back and love me and tell me youre mine  
Keep on dreamin with me
