There are teddy bears and high school rings  
And old photographs that mamas bring  
That daddies with their young boys playing ball  
Theres combat boots that he used to wear  
When he was sent over there  
Theres 50000 names carved in the wall  
  
Theres cigarettes and theres cans of beer  
And notes that say I miss you dear  
And children who dont say anything at all  
Theres purple hearts and packs of gum  
Fatherless daughters and fatherless sons  
And theres 50000 names carved in the wall  
  
They come from all across this land  
In pickup trucks and mini vans  
Searching for a boy from long ago  
They scan the wall and find his name  
The teardrops fall like pouring rain  
And silently they leave a gift and go  
  
Theres stars of David and rosary beads  
And crucifixion figurines  
And flowers of all colors large and small  
Theres a Boy Scout badge and a merit pin  
Little American flags waving in the wind  
And theres 50000 names carved in the wall
