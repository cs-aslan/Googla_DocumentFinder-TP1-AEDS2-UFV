Ive always been labeled As a rip roarin Hell Raisin kind  
But you know here lately I got other things on my mind  
Like livin and dyin and where Ill spend eternity  
What kind of reward Jesus Have you got out on me  
  
Down here on earth Theres a big price on my head  
But Ive got all my friends and my loved ones wholl cry when Im dead  
And someday well all sing along From the other side  
Cause Ive heard that everyones wanted  
Behind your heavenly gates in the sky  
  
Chorus  
What kind of reward Jesus Have you got on me  
I wonder how the words on my big Wanted poster do read  
And oh how Id love to be taken into your custody  
What kind of reward Jesus Have you got on me
