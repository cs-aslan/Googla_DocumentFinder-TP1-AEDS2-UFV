You think you love Sue  
But when I get thru with you  
You wont ever look at Sue again  
  
Im gonna be so good to you  
Im gonna love you my whole life thru  
Pretty soon youll feel the same  
You wont even know her name  
Ill give ya kisses that she cant beat  
Ill treat you so nice and sweet  
When I get thru with you  
Youll love me too not Sue  
When I get thru with you  
Youll love me too  
  
Im gonna treat you sweet and kind  
Ill drive her right outta your mind  
And you wont know her if you meet  
Walk right by her on the street  
Because I want you and need you so  
Poor Susie will have to go  
When I get thru with you  
Youll love me too not Sue  
When I get thru with you  
Youll love me too  
  
Im gonna be so good to you  
Ill love you my whole life thru  
Pretty soon youll feel the same  
You wont even know her name  
Ill give you kisses that she cant beat  
Ill treat you so nice and sweet  
When I get thru with you  
Youll love me too not Sue  
When I get thru with you  
Youll love me too not Sue  
When I get thru with you  
Youll love me too not Sue
