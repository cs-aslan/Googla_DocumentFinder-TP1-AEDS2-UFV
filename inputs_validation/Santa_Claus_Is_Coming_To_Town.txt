Youd better watch out youd better not cry  
Youd better not pout Im telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
Hes making a list checking it twice  
Hes gonna find out whos naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He sees you when youre sleeping  
He knows when youre awake  
He knows if youve been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rootytoottoots and rumatumtums  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
And curlyhead dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants boats and kiddy cars too  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
The kids in Girl and Boyland will have a jubilee  
Theyre gonna build a Toyland town  
All around the Christmas tree
