Ive got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor  
Reminds me of the times we shared  
Makes me wish that you were here  
Now it seems Ive forgotten my purpose in this life  
All the songs have been erased  
Guess Ive learned from my mistakes  
Open the past and present  
Now and we are there  
Story to tell and I am listening  
Open the past and present  
And the future too  
Its all Ive got and Im giving it up to you  
Loose ends tied in knots  
Leaving a lump down in my throat  
Gagging on a souvenir  
Lodged to fill another year  
Drag it on and on until my skin is ripped to shreds  
Leaving myself open wide  
Living out a sacrifice  
If you got no one and Ive got no place to go would it be alright  
Could it be alright
