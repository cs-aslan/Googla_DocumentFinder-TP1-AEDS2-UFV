Clinging to me  
Like a last breath you would breathe  
You were like home to me  
I dont recognize the street  
  
Please dont close your eyes  
Dont know where to look without them  
Outside the cars speed by  
I never heard them until now  
  
I know you care I know it is always been there  
But there is trouble ahead I can feel it  
You are just saving yourself when you hide it  
Yeah I know you care  
I see it in the way that you stare  
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it  
Ill be saving myself from the ruin  
And I know you care  
  
I use to run down the stairs to the door  
And I thought you were there  
To shape to the comfort of us  
Two lovers loved out of love  
  
Oh but I know you care  
I know it is always been there  
But there is trouble ahead I can feel it  
You are just saving yourself when you hide it  
Yeah I know you care  
I see it in the way that you stare  
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it  
Ill be saving myself from the ruin  
  
I know it wasnt always wrong  
But Ive never known a winter so cold  
Now I dont want my hands in a coat  
But I still hope  
Cause this is how things ought to have been  
And I know the worst of it wasnt all that it seemed  
Why cant I dream  
Do I care to dream  
  
Cause I know you care  
And I know you care  
I know you care  
I know you care  
I know its always been there
