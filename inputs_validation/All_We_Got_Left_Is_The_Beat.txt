hey hey check it out homie  
Man you need to get up out of this spot man  
And get a job man before you get smoked man  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah son  
I know you dont want to hear it man  
But hey man wait hold up loc you got company man  
wheres my guns  
  
When Im ridin on the street I hear gunshots rare shots  
Crack niggas cause they moms missed flips  
So black man really care about politics  
In the ninetys our governments so slick  
I watch CNN sometimes and I realize  
Theyre playin tricks on my mind  
They want a man to work with his hands  
Too young to die and they dont give a damn  
Raremomma got down on her knees  
But not no more god damn it I make cheese  
Im on the move and Ima show and prove  
You might cry to my political groove  
Rest in peace  
Sauce Brothers underneath  
I love you to death while my beats like a reef  
In the middle of the night on the city streets  
The only thing we got left is the beat  
  
Chorus  
All we got left is the beat is the beat yo  
All we got left is the beat huh give it to me  
All we got left is the beat the beat yo  
All we got left is the beat uh  
  
Who brings guns into the USA  
And then makes sure that they come around the way  
Gain the points until the whole race traps  
And teach up my woman that she should call up the cops  
The projects are hell wait a minute  
Theres nothin we do but ride on top of an elevator  
Say the clubs I cant get a job  
Mouth to feed somebodys gettin robbed  
I aint worked but I aint workin for crumbs  
You ever seen a manshelter  
Check out the bombs  
Brother of pain their whole lives are over  
They spent every dime tryin not to be sober  
And all the ladies got bags of clothes  
Theyll be your long lost momma one never knows  
The streets are like a nightmare  
While the presidents secretary is chillin in his leather chair  
  
Chorus  
  
Lemon to a lime lime to a lemon  
When you need a togablack hire black linen  
Your rippers man applause when he cant get a job  
He gets up all of his family and feels like a slob  
The black women dont understand  
Cause they dont realize what it is to be a black man  
In the mornin a brother feels like a jerk  
Seein black women and white men go to work  
So all women fear the brothers aint real  
Cause they wont give us no jobs thats the real deal  
Hold my hand while I get it all together  
They dont deserve me at times of bad weather  
Cause Ima make it out the concrete walls  
And theres another way besides basketball  
Let me go let me do what I do  
Im red black and green then red white and blue  
  
Chorus  
  
Ridin in the street you can feel the city heat  
A little bit of grass and a whole lot of concrete  
Creepin Im standin on the corner  
And you can get robbed if you want to  
Paybacks a mother on the street  
Youre seein gold teeth ya hearin funky beats  
Brothers ride by real slow  
You get leary when they got tinted windows  
Sittin on the steps with a blunt  
Im drinkin Valentine I wasnt raised up front  
My Aunt Ellie always talked about God  
Tell me you never cried cause its so hard  
Government got a hell of a plan  
But word is born they aint destroyin this black man  
  
Chorus x2
