Fucking around in a crap game  
Niggas think Im soft cause now Im in the rap game  
And I dont hang out as much  
Bang out dope cuts  
Standing on stage and Im grabbing my nuts  
But when it comes to getting in a circle  
Im hitting sevens turning broke niggas purple  
Looking for Little Joe and the dumb nigga scream and choke  
When deuce deuce hit the floor yo  
Now which of ya want to fade the twenty  
Im turnin your fat pockets skinny  
Ah yeah Im shaking the ivory  
And boom its like they die for me  
Fool you can get loud get mad hit the joint  
But dont forget my point  
There it is yo  
I put my Nike on the bet so it wont slide  
Money gone cause Im never hitting deucefive  
Im never hitting fourtrey no way  
You want to leave but come on hoe stay  
Nigga see but thatll work  
Poppa needs brandnew shoes and a sweatshirt  
Fool you cant even fuck with that  
And now that Im winning I gots to get my gat  
Cause I see your homies starting to look  
And broke motherfuckers they make the best crooks  
And Im feeling like a baller  
Bucking fools now the circles getting smaller  
Now you want to go and scheme  
Punk niggas like you just love to tripleteam  
So I pick up my money and start walking  
Cause now I let the gat start talking  
Now since yall lost you want to go out like a sucker  
Take that motherfucker
