Attention all nigga rows and nigga hoes  
Weve decided to rob this motherfucker the legal way  
Nobs injecting ourselves to become property on the stock  
In the penal system In the justice system  
  
Penitentiary I hear you calling me  
Penitentiary I hear you calling me  
Penitentiary I hear you calling me  
Penitentiary I hear you calling me  
  
As the world turns it burns while its spinning  
Coming to a fucked up ending  
I cant wait till the day everything in the hood is straight  
And I can hit the purty gates  
Until then the pen is unfair  
Slave ships in the middle of nowhere ma  
I lets my goddamn hair grow ma  
Bellin in court lookin like a scarecrow  
On Capital Hill they them passed a bill  
Coming at me with a fuckedup deal nah  
The judge gave me a L  
But yall cant tell  
I wait and cry in my cell  
Convicted negro superhero  
Speaker at our house  
Takin lyrics in my mouth  
Bitches in the south showin ass mm  
Mix a lot got hoes puttin titties on the glass  
We blast in the west for example  
And rap about this shit over funkadelic samples  
Yo babies see me kill a fool on TV Wilson  
And straight call me a G  
  
Chorus  
Penitentiary I hear you calling me  
Penitentiary I hear you calling me  
Thinkin of illegal ways to get paid  
But it aint shit got to be legit  
  
Bridge  
Southcentral LA  
You can buy your game from the CIA heyhey  
And Southcentral LA  
You can buy your game from the CIA baby  
  
When the evil outweighs the good  
And you only give a fuck about rucks  
The Earth will selfdestruct Bitch  
Fuck the ozone layer bitch Im a player Bitch  
Plus we got a black mayor  
I get sex when I shows flex Boom  
Porbey Rolex Boom  
Which hoe is next Boom  
Would you like a piece of me Not a mate  
Calling you a hoe cause Im fucking on the first day uh  
My world is a onemile radius  
I swear every other hood is the shadiest uh  
Could the crips and bloods be all rotten  
When the trilateral commission is plottin  
What you gonna do when the Earth erupts  
Some niggas gettin nuts outa carafel cups punk  
Fool you on masters woe  
But wont even think about sucking Bob Doe punk  
Asshole from the Senate  
How can you relate to a project tennant  
Motherfuck you and not the court man no corrections  
Tryina get a section of this westside connection  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Bridge  
  
Repeat x3  
Just because you gotta stay  
You aint gotta rot away  
We goin come and get you one day
