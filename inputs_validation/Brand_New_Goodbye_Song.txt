Baby go down to the drugstore buy me a guitar string  
And be sure to wear your coat girl cause it might rain  
Cause honey you know that rain is bad for my guitar strings  
Put on your warm coat honey its gonna be cold tonight  
Put on the one thats warm and long  
Cause youre just before hearin my brand new goodbye song  
Baby Ive tried your doctors they just couldnt make me well  
The higher I tried to climb the further I fell  
Guess it must have blew my mind sniffing the fumes of Hell  
Put on your warm coat honey its gonna be cold tonight  
Put on the one thats warm and long  
Youre just before hearin my brand new goodbye song  
Baby throw away my pillow just before you turn the light  
All youll have next to you now will be the night  
Ill be somewhere wrong youll be somewhere right  
Put on your warm coat honey its gonna be cold tonight  
Put on the one thats warm and long  
Youre just before hearin my brand new goodbye song
