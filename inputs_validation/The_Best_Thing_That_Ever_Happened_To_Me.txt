Ive had my share  
Of lifes ups and downs  
But youve been good to me  
The downs have been few  
I guess some would say  
That Ive been lucky  
Oh but Ive got to say  
That its all because of you  
  
CHORUS  
If anyone should ever write  
My lifes story  
For whatever reason there might be  
Youd be there  
Between each line of pain and glory  
Cause youre the best thing  
That ever happened to me  
  
There have been times  
When times were hard  
But always somehow  
I made it through  
Cause for every moment  
I spent hurting  
There was a moment  
I spent just loving you  
  
CHORUS
