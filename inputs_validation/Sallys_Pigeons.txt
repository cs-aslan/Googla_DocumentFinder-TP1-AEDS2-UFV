When I was eight I had a friend  
With a pirate smile  
Make believe and play pretend  
We were innocent and wild  
Hopped a fence and slammed the gate  
Running down my alleyway  
In time to watch Sallys pigeons fly  
  
We loved to watch them dive and soar  
Circle in the sky  
Free as a bird from three to four  
And never knowing why  
Neighbors pulled their wash back in  
Put away my Barbie and Ken  
Look out overhead  
While Sallys pigeons fly  
  
I had a fools confidence  
That the world had no boundaries  
But instincts and common sense  
Come in different quantities  
  
My heart began to  
Skip to the beat  
Of the boy next door  
She had her eye across the street  
On someone shy and tall  
We lived our dreams  
And challenged fate  
In tears she told me she was late  
And Sally let his pigeons out to fly  
  
On the dresser sits a frame  
With a photograph  
Two little girls in ponytails  
Some twenty one years back  
She left one night with just a nod  
Was lost from some back alley job  
I close my eyes and Sallys pigeons fly  
She never saw those birds again  
And me I cant remember when  
A pirate smile hasnt made me cry  
I close my eyes  
And Sallys pigeons fly
