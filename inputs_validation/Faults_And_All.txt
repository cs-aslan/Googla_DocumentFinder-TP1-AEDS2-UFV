Not so very long from now  
Shell be known all over town  
Cause she waits by her phone from in the car  
She says the limit is the sky  
And tonight shes flyin high  
But Ill hang around and take her faults and all  
  
O Yes she once was mine  
Now shes changed and shes that kind  
With a crowd she has her self a ball  
But shes not that kind of girl  
Shes just hidin from the world  
But Ill hang around and take her faults and all  
  
Shes about as low as a girl can go  
She aint got far to fall  
But when she hits the ground  
Im gonna be around  
Cause I want her most of all  
And when alls been said and done  
Im gonna be the one  
Wholl hang around and take her faults and all  
  
Yeah Ill hang around and take her faults and all
