Tornados spinnin I sit here grinnin  
I think weve all seen this movie before  
This is confusin almost amusin  
Its hard to tell up and down anymore  
When did it get so crazy how did we lose control  
Everybodys shouting how bad it really sucks  
  
Situation normal  
All funked up Were all funked up  
  
We had some leaders and they were cheaters  
But they came out smelling like a rose  
We should reject them but we respect them  
For what they do when the door is closed  
Nothing in this world a simple man can do  
Stand up and be counted aint you had enough  
  
Situation normal  
All funked up Yeah were all funked up  
Were functionally dysfunctional  
Were functionally yeah dysfunctional  
Were all funked up  
  
Dont you know the meaning of the word snafu  
Better known as trouble for me and you  
Murphys law will get ya hes on his way  
Same ole same ole shit a different day
