Got a house full of fortune and they pay me in gold  
For something Id do for free  
But theres still something missing that a  
man cant hold  
Its like a weight over me  
  
So scared the thrill will be gone  
But Im the one who keeps the pressure on  
  
Chorus  
All Ive got is all I need  
But I get no sleep and Im tired to the bone  
All Ive got is all I need  
But I get no sleep and I know Im not alone  
  
Well Im sick of walking round with blood in my eyes  
Just keeping up with this town  
I m a roadrunner racing but I dont see the signs  
Ive got to learn to slow down  
  
My life makes it hard to complain  
But theres times Id take my school days back again  
  
Chorus  
  
Four oclock and Im still counting sheep  
Love to change the system but Im in too deep  
I keep the pressure far away as I can  
But it still comes back again back again yeah yeah  
  
My life makes it hard to complain  
But theres times Id take my school days back again  
  
Chorus  
  
All Ive got is all I need  
But I get no sleep and Im sure Im not alone  
Im not alone yeah
