Warchild your heart is broken  
Your mind is breakin its such a shame  
Warchild your bodys broken  
Your womans taken its not a game  
  
People once shared your wisdom  
Shared your memory shared your dreams  
Now your thoughts have all been shattered  
What once was rhythm are now just screams  
  
Warchild I used to love you  
The whole world loved you we used to care  
Warchild your mind has been emptied  
So all you do now is just sit n stare  
  
People once shared your wisdom  
Shared your memory shared your dreams  
Now your thoughts have all been shattered  
What once was rhythm are now just screams  
  
Your ladys waiting shes hesitating  
Not knowing why  
Warchild the pain youre showing  
The pain is knowing that youre gonna die  
  
People once shared your wisdom  
Shared your memory shared your dreams  
Now your thoughts have all been shattered  
What once was rhythm are now just screams
