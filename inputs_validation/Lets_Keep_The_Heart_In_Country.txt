Everyones here talking and dancing There havin a good time  
  
But its hard to smile when my friends all know I got you on my mind  
  
Hey Im not in the mood to hear another fast dancin song I dont care if
its old country gold or new country soul  
  
Ive had enough of this rocknroll  
  
Lets keep the heart in the country cause thats where it should always be  
  
Dont get me wrong I like to party but tonight I must sit this one out you
see  
  
Because the one I love is leavin bartender bring me whiskey please  
  
Lets keep the heart in the country cause love has torn the heart right out
of me  
  
Now that was great please thank the band for playing that song  
  
It was nice and smooth like this Kentucky brew that I am sipping on  
  
Oh how Ill miss her but I got my music and now Ill get along  
  
I dont feel bad now you see misery loves company in a country song  
  
Lets keep the heart in the country cause thats where it should always be  
  
Dont get me wrong I like to party but tonight I must sit this one out you
see

And lets keep the heart in the country cause love torn the heart right out
of me  
  
And lets keep the heart in the country cause love has torn the heart right
out of me
