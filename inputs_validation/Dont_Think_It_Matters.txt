Maybe Im right or maybe Im wrong  
I got to go on anyway  
Im finding it hard to try and play the right card  
And woman youre getting in my way  
Oh you dont think it matters at all  
No you dont think it matters at all  
No you dont think it matters at all  
  
Im working all night you know Im working all night  
Trying to get something out of my head  
I live for the day when everybody will say  
Its better than all of the rest  
Oh you dont think it matters at all  
No you dont think it matters at all  
No you dont think it matters at all  
  
Maybe Im right or maybe Im wrong  
I just do the best that I can  
I been working all night yeah I work through the night  
Woman cant you understand  
  
Oh you dont think it matters at all  
No you dont think it matters at all  
No you dont think it matters at all
