Oh I saw her near ocean avenue  
Wears a tshirt and her eyes are blue  
She told me that  
Shes living in the heart of LA City now mmm  
We went straight to a night cafe  
Took popcorn coffee and I heard her say  
She told me that  
Shes living in the heart of LA City now mmm  
  
Cinderella girl  youre in my mind  
A girl like you  is so hard to find  
Cinderella girl  Ill miss you so  
Oh Ill never let you go oh no  
  
It was late at night in that night cafe  
Shes eating ice cream when I heard her say  
Please pick me up  
Tomorrow in the heart of LA City now mmm  
At four oclock she took a cap  
I saw her waving never saw her back  
She told me that  
Shes living in the heart of LA City now mmm
