Shes fallen from grace  
Somewhere in space  
The twilight has come and there is no tomorrow  
And night after day  
Shes driftin away  
And time is run out for our lady of sorrow  
Lady dont you cry  
This time youll stay high  
Lately when Ive seen her  
She would smile as if to say  
That the worst was over  
And thered soon be brighter days  
But Im wonderin Im wonderin  
She goes to the door  
And ask just once more  
She gives everything she could beg steal or borrow  
And each time is her last  
But time moves too fast  
And time has run out for our lady of sorrow  
Lady dont you frown  
This time you wont come down  
Just today I watched them as  
They carried her away  
And I can only hope that she  
Has found a brighter day  
But Im wonderin Im wonderin  
Had there been someone near to care what then
