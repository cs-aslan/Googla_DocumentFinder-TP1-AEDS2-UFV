I was looking in the mirror  
Trying to find a new reflection  
Wanna take the road less traveled in  
A different direction  
Make some new mistakes  
Forget the ones I made  
Cry some tears of joy  
And dress more like a boy  
  
Chorus  
And come back as a blonde  
Try a different lipstick on as a blonde  
Will I get whatever I want  
Id be ever so incising  
Eat a lot of icing  
Never have to watch my weight  
Yeah when Im gone  
Im gonna come back as a blonde  
  
I wanna I meet myself as someone else  
Just to see what it feels like  
Take a walk on the other side  
Cause you know that I just might  
Break some different hearts finish what I start  
Im not gonna wait to mess around with fate  
  
Chorus  
  
Im tainted Im tired of being the same yeah  
Im desperate Im bored Im begging for change  
What if youre normal and wanna be strange  
Come back come back come back  
I wanna Come back come back come back  
  
Chorus  
  
As a blonde try a different lipstick on as a blonde  
Will I get whatever I want  
Id be ever so incising cake a lot of icing  
Never have to watch my weight  
Oh when Im gone  
Im gonna come back as a blonde  
Wave my magic wand as a blonde  
Will I get whatever I want  
Id be ever so incising cake a lot of icing  
Never need to wash my face  
Yeah when Im gone Im gonna  
Come back come back come back  
Im gonna come back  
Come back come back come back  
Im gonna come back  
Come back come back come back  
As a blonde
