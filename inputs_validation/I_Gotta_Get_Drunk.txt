Well I gotta get drunk  
And I sure do dread it  
Cause I know just what Im gonna do  
Ill start to spend my money  
Call everybody honey  
And wind up singing the blues  
Ill spend my whole paycheck  
On some old wreck  
And brother I can name you a few  
But I gotta get drunk  
And I sure do dread it  
Cause I know just what Im gonna do  
  
I gotta get drunk I just cant stay sober  
Theres a lot of good people in town  
Whod like to hear me holler  
See me spend my dollars  
And I wouldnt think of lettin em down  
Theres a lot of doctors that tell me  
That Id better start slowin it down  
But theres more old drunkers  
Than there are old doctors  
So I guess wed better have another round  
Well now I gotta get drunk  
  
Well I gotta get drunk
