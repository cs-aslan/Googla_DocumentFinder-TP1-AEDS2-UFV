Every time I touch you  
My heart skips a beat  
Every time I kiss you  
I feel love from my head to my feet  
Somethin deep within me baby  
Sayin you should be mine  
Dont you know baby somewhere  
I got to I got to draw the line  
  
Tell me baby whose side are you on  
Are you wih me or am I all alone  
Whoa baby  
Oh where you been so long  
Since I need you  
Oh wont you please come home  
  
And every mornin I wake up  
Cant hide my tears  
After all the lovin baby  
Weve had through the years  
Its a lonely season baby  
For you to leave leave with no reason babe  
I just cant help believin  
This time youre really really really leavin  
  
Whoa baby whose side are you on  
Are you with me or am I all alone  
Whoa baby  
Oh where you been where ya  
Where have you been so long  
Since I need you woo come on home  
  
Whoa baby whose side are you on  
Since I need you oh  
Whoa baby  
Where you been where you been  
Where you been so damn long  
Since I need you  
Whoa honey honey come home
