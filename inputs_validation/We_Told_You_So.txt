Written By Cohen Performed In Night Magic  
  
Angels We told you so  
We told you dear  
You didnt have  
To come here  
  
The human life  
Is full of quirks  
We cant work it out  
Nothing works  
  
Its a lemon  
This mechanic  
Live love suffer  
Die and panic  
  
It lives it loves  
Suffers and dies  
It eats cows meat  
And apple pies  
  
Dumb dumb dumb  
And full of fear  
Anxiety and strife  
This is the human life  
  
 We have many duties still  
Much gold and silver light to spill  
On anxious boys and frightened girls like you
