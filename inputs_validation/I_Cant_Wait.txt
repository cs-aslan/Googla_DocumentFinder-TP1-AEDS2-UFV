On and on  
My world keeps spinnin round and round  
I am so lost since youve gone away  
Chorus 1  
Day after day Ive been tryin  
To find a way to make you see  
Chorus 2  
I  hate to wonder  
Why  you dont realize  
I  feel like I could die  
Just hold me one more time  
I cant wait  not for a lifetime  
I cant wait  Ive been holding on  
I cant wait  Tell me what to do  
Ill wait for you  
Ooh its been so long  
I wont last another day  
Chorus 1
