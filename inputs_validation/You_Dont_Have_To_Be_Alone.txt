I dont know when we fell apart  
The love that we had was like a work of art  
I used to see Heaven in your eyes  
The angels have fallen from your skies  
Things we said were so wrong  
And I havent held you for so long  
My foolish pride turns me inside  
Why did we tell all those lies  
You can reach for the phone  
You dont have to be alone  
  
Outside the winter seems so cold  
Your heart is frozen like the snow  
And theres no one home to keep you safe and warm  
Your eyes are red because youve cried  
You fell asleep by the fireside  
But theres one thing you should know  
On this Christmas baby  
You dont have to be alone  
  
And I had only one wish on my list oh  
For me you would be the perfect gift oh yeah  
Theres nothing colder than an empty home oh no empty home  
And holidays were never meant to be alone oh to be alone  
The smiles we gave when our hearts were safe  
By each others love and warmth  
Thats subsided now with happiness around  
If I can only find the way to your heart  
  
Outside the winter seems so cold so cold so cold  
Your heart is frozen like the snow frozen like the snow oh so cold  
And theres no one home to keep you safe and warm no one homekeep you safe
and warm yeah  
Your eyes are red because youve cried youve cried  
You fell asleep by the fireside by the fireside  
But theres one thing you should know one thing you should know  
On this Christmas baby  
You dont have to be aloneyeah uh

You dont have to be no no all alone at home  
Ohhhh on Christmas  
You dont you dont have to be alone  
You dont have to bealone alone

Outside the winter seems so cold so cold sing it baby  
Your heart is frozen like a storm frozen like a storm yeah like a storm  
And theres no one home no one home to keep you safe and warm to keep you
