Tow the line  
Tow the line  
  
Wake up your time is nearly over  
No more the supernova  
No action guaranteed  
  
Wake up youve had an operation  
Ideals above your station  
Too much reality  
  
Think about the wasted time spending  
Watching Mother Natures knees bending  
Everybody loves a happy ending  
  
Wake up youre on your own agenda  
Give up the great pretender  
With baby eyes of green  
  
Wake up youre holding on to nothing  
You know youre only bluffing  
As dead as autumn leaves  
  
Think about the wasted time spending  
Watching Mother Natures knees bending  
Everybody loves a happy ending  
  
Dont you just love a happy ending  
Oh yeah well so do I  
And all your love will shine on everyone  
  
The darkness of the day  
A curse in every way  
You try to see the light  
But you dont know why  
Dont know why  
  
They tell you on the phone  
To give your God a bone  
And grow a set of wings like a butterfly  
  
The guardian at the gate  
Reminds you that youre late  
You try to take your time  
But you tow the line  
Tow the line  
  
To children of the world  
And daddys little girl  
The grass is always green on the other side  
So stay and breathe new life  
  
Wake up wake up wake up wake up  
  
Wake up wake up  
Everything is moving faster than you think  
Wake up wake up  
Your pen is running out of ink  
Wake up wake up  
Fill up your bath and kitchen sink  
Wake up wake up  
Theyre really kicking up a stink  
Wake up wake up  
You never found the missing link  
Wake up wake up  
You should be happy in the pink  
Wake up wake up  
Youre in demand but out of sync  
Wake up wake up  
A nod is as good as a wink  
Wake up wake up  
Once more my dear friends to the brink  
  
All your love will shine on everyone
