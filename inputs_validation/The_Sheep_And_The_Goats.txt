And when the son man comes and all the holy angels with him  
Then shall he sit on his glorious throne  
And he will divide the nations before him as a shepherd separates the sheep
from the goats  
  
And she shall put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left  
And he shall say to the sheep come ye blessed of my father  
Inherit the kingdom I have prepared for you from the foundation of the world  
For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat  
I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink  
I was naked and you clothed me  
I was a stranger and you invited me in  
I was sick and I was in prison and you came to me  
Thank you enter into your rest  
  
And they shall answer him yes they shall answer him  
And theyll say lord when  
When were you hungry lord and we gave you something to eat  
Lord when were you thirsty I cant remember  
And we gave you drink  
  
Huh when were you naked lord and we clothed you  
And lord when were you a stranger and we invited you in  
I mean we invited lots of people in lord I could never forget that face  
  
And lord when were you sick and we visited you  
Or in prison and we came to you lord tell us  
In as much as you did it to the least of my bretheren youve done it unto me  
  
Oh yes as much as youve done it to the very least of my bretheren youve
done it  
Youve done it unto me enter into your rest  
Then he shall turn to those on his left the goats  
Depart from me you cursed ones into everlasting fire  
Prepared for the devil and his angels  
  
For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat  
I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink  
I was naked out in the cold in exposure and you sent me away  
I was a stranger and I knocked at your door  
But you didnt open you told me to go away  
I was sick racked in pain upon my bed  
And I begged and prayed and pleaded that youd come but you didnt  
I was in prison and I rotted there  
Id prayed that youd come  
  
I heard your programs on the radio I read your magazines but you never came  
Depart from me  
Lord there must be some mistake when  
Lord I mean when were you hungry lord and we didnt give you something to
eat  
And lord when were you thirsty and we didnt give you drink  
I mean thats not fair well would you like something now  
Would one of the angels like to go out and get the lord a hamburger and a
coke  
Oh youre not hungry yeah I lost my appetite too  
  
Uh lord uh lord when were you naked  
I mean lord thats not fair either lord  
We didnt know what size you wear  
Oh lord when were you a stranger lord  
You werent one of those creepy people who used to come to the door were you  
Oh lord that wasnt our ministry lord we just didnt feel led you know  
Lord when were you sick what did you have anyway  
Well at least it wasnt fatal oh it was  
Im sorry lord I would have sent you a card  
Lord just on last thing we want to know  
When were you in prison lord what were you in for anyway  
I had a friend in levenworth  
Enough  
  
In as much as youve not done it unto the least of my bretheren  
Youve not done it unto me  
In as much as youve not done it unto the least of my bretheren  
Youve not done it unto me depart from me  
And these shall go away into everlasting fire  
But the righteous into eternal life  
And my friends the only difference between the sheep and the goats  
According to this scripture  
Is what they did and didnt do
