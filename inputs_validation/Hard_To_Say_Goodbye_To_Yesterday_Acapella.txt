How do I say goodbye  
To what we had  
Good times that made us laugh  
Outweighed the bad  
  
I thought wed get to see forever  
But forevers gone away  
  
Its so hard  
To say goodbye  
To yesterday  
  
I dont know where this road  
Is going to lead  
All I know is where weve been  
And what weve been through  
  
x2And Ill take with me the memories  
To be my sunshine after the rain  
  
Well its so hard  
To say goodbye  
To yesterday
