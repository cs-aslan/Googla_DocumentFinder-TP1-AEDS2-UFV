Shock got the shock of my life  
Just buckle up girls Im stealin the night  
From the still of the night  
What theyre down to  
Lets see in cold daylight  
  
I gotta get this right  
I gotta get this right  
  
Cause shes all  
And I am low  
Watching you watching her play this game  
Yes shes bold  
Bold enough  
To set fire to your plain  
Her fire to your plain  
  
Pray  
You can pray to your Jane  
I put out the call  
But not to be saved  
Called my deviling kin  
With her yellow Aston Martin  
  
We gotta get this right  
I gotta get this right  
  
Cause shes all  
And I am low  
Watching him watching her play this game  
Yes shes bold  
Bold enough  
To set fire to his plain  
  
She said get in  
And set the SatNav to hell  
Or would it be a purgatory  
  
I gotta get this right  
I gotta get this right  
  
Cause shes all  
And I am low  
Watching you watching her play this game  
Yes shes bold  
Bold enough  
To set fire to your plain  
Her fire to your plain  
  
Her fire  
Bold enough  
Her fire to your plain
