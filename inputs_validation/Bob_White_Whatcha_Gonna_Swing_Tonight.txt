I was talkin to the whippoorwill  
He says you got a corny trill  
Bob White Whatcha gonna swing tonight  
I was talkin to the mocking bird  
He says you are the worst hes heard  
Bob White Whatcha gonna swing tonight  
  
Even the owltells me youre foul  
Singin those lullaby notes  
Dont be a bring down  
If you can swing down  
Gimme those high notes  
  
Theres a lotta talk about you Bob  
And theyre sayin youre off the cob  
Fake it Mister B  
Take it follow me Bob white  
Were gonna break it up tonight
