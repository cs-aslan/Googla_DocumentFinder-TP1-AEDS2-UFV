Ive heard it called by different names  
All over the world but its all the same  
There are so many ways to make love  
A million ways Ive been thinking of oh yeah  
But theres only one way  
Theres only one way to rock  
So many things can get you high  
Im gonna try em all just once before I die  
And you can analyze this situation  
To me its all just mental masturbation  
But theres only one way  
Theres only one way to rock  
Theres only one way  
Theres only one way to rock yeah  
Check the hands on the clock its 805 its time to rock F O  
And this world can disagree  
They dont understand how it can be  
And its not my point of view its a fact  
We all know that its true oh yeah  
Theres only one way  
Theres only one way to rock  
Theres only one way  
Theres only one way to rock  
Crank up the drums and the bass  
Crank up my Les Paul in your face  
F O
