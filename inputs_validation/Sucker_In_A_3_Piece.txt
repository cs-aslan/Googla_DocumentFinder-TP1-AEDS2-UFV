Shes so fine  
How about a nine on a ten scale  
With long legs straight on up to her lunch pail  
Sweet little wishbone oh yeah  
Dont want to break her in half  
Lick up one side and down the other  
Always makes her laugh  
She take me down down down to the bottom  
I got everything you wanted  
Give you everything you need  
Still you want that sugar daddy over me  
She want a sucker sucker in a 3 piece  
A sucker all dressed up in a 3 piece suit  
Im on fire with just one look  
Got me a brand new number  
In my little black book  
But she dont like the way I dress  
She dont like the way I wear my hair  
But when I roll you over baby you dont care  
Just take me down down down down to the bottom  
Give me everything I want  
Give me everything I want  
You dont want that sugar daddy not over me  
She want a sucker sucker in a 3 piece  
A sucker all dressed up in a 3 piece suit  
Oh say it isnt so baby  
You want to sucker  
He just a sucker  
He just a sucker  
Look at all that money baby  
Ya know your sugar daddy  
Youre a sugar mama  
Youre both a bunch of suckers  
Oh how he got a big ole belly  
A stone bald head  
Now listen here honey  
That aint down your alley no  
Hes just a sucker in a three piece  
Sucker in a three piece suit  
Sucker  
Stone cold sugar daddy  
Sucker all dressed up in a three piece suit
