At the center of the earth  
In the parking lot  
Of the 711 were I was taught  
The motto was just a lie  
It says home is where your heart is  
But what a shame  
Cause everyones heart doesnt beat the same  
Its beating out of time  
City of the dead  
At the end of another lost highway  
Signs misleading to nowhere  
City of the damned  
Lost children with dirty faces today  
No one really seems to care  
I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall  
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall  
And so it seemed to confess  
It didnt say much but it only confirmed  
That the center of the earth is the end of the world  
And I could really care less  
City of the dead  
At the end of another lost highway  
Signs misleading to nowhere  
City of the damned  
Lost children with dirty faces today  
No one really seems to care hey
