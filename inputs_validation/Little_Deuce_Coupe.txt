Little deuce Coupe  
You dont know what I got  
Little deuce Coupe  
You dont know what I got  
  
Well Im not braggin babe so dont put me down  
But Ive got the fastest set of wheels in town  
When something comes up to me he dont even try  
Cause if I had a set of wings man I know she could fly  
Shes my little deuce coupe  
You dont know what I got  
My little deuce coupe  
You dont know what I got  
  
Just a little deuce coupe with a flat head mill  
But shell walk a Thunderbird like shes its standin still  
Shes ported and relieved and shes stroked and bored  
Shell do a hundred and forty with the top end floored  
Shes my little deuce coupe  
You dont know what I got  
My little deuce coupe  
You dont know what I got  
  
Shes got a competition clutch with the four on the floor  
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar  
And if that aint enough to make you flip your lid  
Theres one more thing I got the pink slip daddy  
  
And comin off the line when the light turns green  
Well she blows em outta the water like you never seen  
I get pushed out of shape and its hard to steer  
When I get rubber in all four gears  
  
Shes my little deuce coupe  
You dont know what I got  
My little deuce coupe  
You dont know what I got  
Shes my little deuce coupe  
You dont know what I got  
My little deuce coupe  
You dont know what I got  
Shes my little deuce coupe  
You dont know what I got
