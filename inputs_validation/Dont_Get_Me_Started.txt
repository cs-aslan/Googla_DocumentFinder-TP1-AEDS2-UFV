Dont Get Me Started  
  
Dont want to be another craze  
How about rather not see and I turn my face  
Dont want to leave you unfinished  
And resting on the noise that you left  
I dont want to leave you mistaken forsaken  
Lying with the rest  
  
I dont want you to be another  
Touch you talk the conversation  
I dont want you to be another  
Reason for me to leave this situation  
  
Dont get me started  
Dont get me started  
Dont get me started  
Dont get me started  
  
I dont want to be a woman last  
Yeah I wish you another man  
I dont want you to kill my name  
And ask if Im hovering him  
I wont send and gather dust  
In the corners of your world  
Cause believe me when you leave me  
It wont be a minute too soon  
  
Dont get me started  
Dont get me started  
Dont get me started  
Dont get me started  
  
I dont want you to be another  
Touch you talk the conversation  
I dont want you to be another  
Reason for me to leave this situation  
  
Dont get me started  
Dont get me started  
Dont get me started  
Dont get me started  
Dont get me started  
Dont get me started  
Dont get me started  
Dont get me started
