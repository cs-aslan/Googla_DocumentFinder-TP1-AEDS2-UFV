Do you remember the last time I said  
If I ever thought of lying  
Id rather think of dying instead  
And the last time you called me  
To say we were through  
How it took a million tears  
Just to prove they all were for you  
  
But it wouldnt have made any difference  
If you loved me  
How could you love me  
When it wouldnt have made any difference  
If you loved me  
You just did not love me  
  
Cause I know of hundreds of times I could be  
In the most unfaithful arms  
That you always picture me  
Though I cant always show proof I was true  
No one else could change my mind  
Or stop me coming home to you  
  
But it wouldnt have made any difference  
If you loved me  
How could you love me  
When it wouldnt have made any difference  
If you loved me  
You just did not love me  
  
Enough to believe me  
Enough not to leave me  
Enough not to look for  
A reason to be unhappy with me  
And make me regret ever wanting you  
  
It wouldnt have made any difference  
Wouldnt have made any difference
