When you wish upon a star  
Dont let yourself fall fall in too hard  
I fell into you and Im on my back  
An insect decaying in your little trap  
I squirm into you now Im in your gut  
I fell into you now Im in a rut  
I lift you up like the sweetest angel  
Ill tear you down like a whore  
I will bury your god in my warm spit  
Youll be deformed in your porn  
Rock star yeah youre such a dirty dirty  
Rock star yeah dirty dirty dirty  
You eat up my heart and all the little parts  
Your star is so sharp  
It leaves me jagged holes  
I make myself sick just to poison you  
If I cant have you then no one will  
  
You are the one I want and what I want is so unreal  
Im such a dirty Rock star yeah  
I am the one you want and the one you want is so unreal
