Our hand is like a torch each time you touch me  
That look thats in your eyes pulls me apart  
Dont open the door to heaven if I cant come in  
Dont touch me if you dont love me sweetheart  
  
Your kiss is like a drink oh when Im thirsty  
Oh and Im thirsty for you with all my heart  
But dont love me then act as though weve never kissed  
Dont touch me if you dont love me sweetheart  
  
Dont give me something oh that you might take away  
To have you then lose you it wouldnt be smart on my part  
Dont open the door to heaven if I cant come in  
Dont touch me if you dont love me sweetheart  
  
No dont give me something Lord that you might take away  
To have you then lose you it wouldnt be smart on my part  
Dont open the door to heaven honey if I cant come in  
And dont touch me if you dont love me sweetheart  
  
Dont touch me if you dont love me sweetheart
