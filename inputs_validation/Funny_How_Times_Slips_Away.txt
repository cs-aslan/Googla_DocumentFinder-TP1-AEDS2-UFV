Well hello there  
My its been a long long time  
How am I doin  
Well I guess Im doin fine  
Its been so long now and it seems that  
It was only yesterday  
Yeah aint it funny how time slips away  
Hows your new love  
I hope that hes doin fine  
I heard you told him  
That youd love him till the end of time  
Well you know thats the same thing  
That you told me  
Seems like just the other day  
Yeah aint it funny how time slips away  
I gotta go now  
Guess Ill see you hanging round  
Dont know when though  
Never know when Ill be back in town  
But I remember what I told you  
That in time its going to be okay  
Yeah aint it funny how time slips away  
Yeah aint it funny how time slips right on slips right on  
Away away away
