Anybodys dream can fall apart  
Anybodys mask can break  
Couldnt tell you how I wanted you  
Enough to make you want to stay  
I never said the words out loud  
I guess I couldnt get em straight  
Baby give me one more chance  
Before you walk away  
  
Its only only only only my heart talkin  
Yeah its only only only only my heart talkin  
Sayin things I never thought Id say  
Cant you hear me knocking  
I tried to fool you but it wouldnt play  
Cause my heart its talkin its talkin  
Oh baby its talkin  
Talkin to you  
  
Everytime I take it to the edge  
Everytime Im so afraid  
Dont you know I cry my eyes out babe  
Everytime you look away  
Oh I almost dropped a tear  
But I caught it just in time  
Id say those things you want to hear  
If youd help me help me help me try  
  
Its only only only only my heart talkin  
Yeah its only only only only my heart talkin  
Sayin things I never thought Id say  
Cant you hear me knocking  
Tried to fool you but it wouldnt play  
Cause my heart its talkin its talkin  
Baby its talkin  
Talkin to you  
  
Well I dont want to hide away  
Hide away without you baby  
Dont you go and run away  
Come and help me baby  
Just a little help baby  
Oh my little baby

Sayin things I never thought Id say
