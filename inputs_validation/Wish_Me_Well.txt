You know I caught a glimpse thought I understood  
But I left it all far behind  
Now if Id known then what I know now  
Do you think I wouldve been so blind  
Gonna take myself to the wishing well  
Im gonna make myself one last wish  
And if you follow me there better bring what youve found  
Cause my night has come and Im going down  
  
Gonna buy myself a big rocking chair  
And when Im sitting in that then noone will peek  
And my friends will come theyll see what Im suffering from  
How I wish how I wish I could rock myself to sleep  
Gonna take myself to the wishing well  
Gonna make myself one last wish  
If you follow me there better bring what youve found  
Cause my night has come and Im going down
