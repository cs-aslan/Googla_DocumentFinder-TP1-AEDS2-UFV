You are the sunshine of my life  
Thats why Ill always be around  
You are the apple of my eye  
Forever youll stay in my heart  
I feel like this is the beginning  
  
Though Ive loved you for a million years  
And if I thought our love was ending  
Id find myself drowning in my own tears  
  
You are the sunshine of my life  
Thats why Ill always stay around  
You are the apple of my eye  
Forever youll stay in my heart  
  
You must have known that I was lonely  
Because you came to my rescue  
And I know that this must be heaven  
How could so much love be inside of you  
  
You are the sunshine of my life yeah  
Thats why Ill always stay around  
You are the apple of my eye  
Forever youll stay in my heart  
  
Love has joined us  
Love has joined us  
Lets think sweet love
