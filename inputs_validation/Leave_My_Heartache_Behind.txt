The hardest thing Ive ever done  
Is say goodbye to you  
But even though I love you baby  
I know you cant be true  
I walked down that country road  
Out to the big highway  
I caught a ride on an eighteenwheeler  
And Im takin it all the way  
Takin all these blues to the highway  
Tryin to get her out of my mind  
When Im out on the open road  
With the wind in my face  
Ill leave my heartache behind  
Raindrops on my window  
Teardrops from my eyes  
I thought our love was sacred  
Now I know thats just a lie  
So I pack my suitcase  
And head out that old front door  
Better take a long last look now baby  
cause I wont be back no more  
Takin all these blues to the highway  
Tryin to get her out of my mind  
When Im out on the open road  
With the wind in my face  
Ill leave my heartache behind
