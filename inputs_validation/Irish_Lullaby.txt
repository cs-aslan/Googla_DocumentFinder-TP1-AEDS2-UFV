Over in Killarney  
Many years ago  
Me Mither My Mother sang a song to me  
In tones so sweet and low  
Just a simple little ditty  
In her good ould old Irish way  
And Id give the world if she could sing  
That song to me this day  
  
Tooralooralooral Tooraloorali  
Tooralooralooral hush now dont you cry  
Tooralooralooral Tooraloorali  
Tooralooralooral thats an Irish lullaby   
  
Oft in dreams I wander  
To that cot again  
I feel her arms ahuggin me  
As when she held me then  
And I hear her voice ahummin  
To me as in days of yore  
When she used to rock me fast asleep  
Outside the cabin door  
  
Tooralooralooral  
Tooraloorali  
Tooralooralooral  
Hush now dont you cry  
  
Tooralooralooral  
Tooraloorali  
Tooralooralooral  
Thats an Irish lullaby
