Well I dreamed I was standin in the middle of a river  
Someone waited on the other side  
My body shivered in the rushing icy water  
I cried out but no one could hear me  
I tried to swim but it was much too far  
I felt a hand pull me up as I was going under  
Somebodys waiting there to catch you  
You dont have to be afraid now baby  
Nobody really knows for sure  
Just open up your heart  
Dont be afraid someone will catch you if you fall too far  
Sometimes you feel like youre invisible  
Theres a crowd but youre all alone  
Cant they see your heart is breaking  
You pretend that it just doesnt matter  
Try to keep smilin baby hope against hope  
Love is gonna find you and set you free  
Somebodys waiting there to catch you  
You dont have to be afraid now baby  
Nobody really knows for sure  
Just open up your heart  
Dont be afraid someone will catch you if you fall too far  
Too far
