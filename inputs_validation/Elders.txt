When we younger  
There always seemed like  
Some perfect mold  
That were supposed to be  
But now were growing up and  
I see its just not that way  
Now I feel like someones lied to me  
  
Cause Ive been true  
Made good for you  
And now I feel used  
Im asking you  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
To be like you  
  
Tell me now elders  
What were your reasons for  
Making it seem  
Like you were so much more  
If you want to feel good  
Because of our accomplishments  
Why the fuck  
Dont you just do it yourself  
  
Cause Ive tried  
Man Ive tried  
While you all lied  
So now just tell me  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
To be like you  
  
Look at all the families now  
Who dont talk and dont trust  
Because of the way  
That things have been done  
When will you finally learn  
To leave out the bullshit  
And just be straight with us
