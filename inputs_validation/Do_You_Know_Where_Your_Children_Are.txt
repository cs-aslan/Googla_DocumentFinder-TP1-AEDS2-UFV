Father comes home from work and hes scared to death  
Mother cries for her kid in a note she read  
Father runs to the table he said Whats going on  
Mother cries desperately Our little babys gone  
  
Do you know where your children are  
Because its now twelve oclock  
And theres someone out on the street  
Just imagine how scared they are  
Do you know where your children are  
Because its now twelve oclock  
And theres someone out on the street  
Just imagine how scared they are  
  
She wrote that she is tired of stepdaddy using her  
Saying that hell buy her things while sexually abusing her  
Just think that shes all alone somewhere out on the street  
How will this girl survive She aint got nothin to eat  
  
Do you know where your children are  
Because its now twelve oclock  
And theres someone out on the street  
Just imagine how scared they are  
Do you know where your children are  
Because its now twelve oclock  
And theres someone out on the street  
Just imagine how scared they are

Save me cause this it aint no joke  
Save me cause Im out for blood  
Save me cause I dont wanna ignore  
Save me its time I replied

Do you know where your children are  
Because its now twelve oclock  
And theres someone out on the street
