You told me you would be here by my side  
Warming my heart on this cold winters night  
  
Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself  
  
You told me you would bring presents and treats KROQ CD

You told me you would move heaven and earth promo CD remix  
Cheering my spirits with laughter and mirth promo CD remix  
  
Here I sit waiting beside the tree all by myself  
  
Oh could you ever know how much I care  
Could you ever know that out somewhere  
Theres a boy who really hurts  
  
Since Ive found you  
Ive found a girl  
Ive found a thorn  
Ive found a queen  
Now I am warm  
  
Christmas Celebration top  
Christmas celebration  
And all around the nation  
Wont you stay with me tonight cause  
Im running out of fight  
And the pagentry is such a bore  
  
Carolers are singing  
Registers Kachinging  
And the presents are in place  
But Id rather eat some mace  
cause the eggnog always makes me sick  
  
You know how the story goes  
Youve seen it all before  
That man is so obese that he cant get out the door  
  
Christmas to perfection  
Im begging for some action  
And the ringing in my ears  
Is the sound of Christmas cheer  
And theyve knocked me screaming overboard
