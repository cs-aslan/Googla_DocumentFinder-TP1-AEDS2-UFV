Lower the thing the skin of a cat  
Skin it to the left just laying there  
No other thing is luck like that  
And you set it said it said nothing  
  
Went to the party very discouraged  
I watched the litter pile like a wall  
I looked at the river just couldnt forgive it  
It was ladened with all kinds of shit  
Still I admit that I didnt say nothing  
I turned my back walked away  
Got to face the fact that I didnt say nothing  
  
Everyone was dancing I stood over in the corner  
I was listening they were saying this and saying that  
And putting this one down but nothing was delivered  
Nothing good was coming I just stood there  
I couldnt believe it but I didnt say nothing  
I walked the floor then I looked away  
  
Got to face the fact that I didnt say nothing  
How long how long will we make do  
Maybe its time to break on through  
Gonna lift my skirts gonna straighten up  
Gonna get well Im gonna do something  
Gonna face the fact gonna give it back  
And Im gonna do something wont hold my tongue  
Wont hold the thought wont hold the card  
Well Im gonna do something  
Oh my brain I got to complain  
You can refrain but Im gonna do something  
How long how long will we make do  
Maybe its time to break on through  
  
Out in the desert I saw that old cat skinned  
I saw it floating in the river  
I saw and no one seemed to mind  
They sat there they sat there watching the sun  
I saw it float away and I watched the buildings crumble  
Like dust in the hand and we watched the sun  
Spread its wings and fly away  
And in the mountains a cry echoes  
Dont say nothing  
Dont say nothing no  
Dont say nothing no
