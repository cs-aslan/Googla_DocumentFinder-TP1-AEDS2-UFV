With you  baby Im satisfied  making my love to you  
Cause you got me hypnotized  
And you came to me alone girl  
I was a heart thats made of stone girl  
  
And you broke it down in pieces  
And you took me for your own girl  
I lie beneath your ecstasy  
You can pour it all over me  
  
I wont break the chains of loving you  
We got everything  anybody needs  
And its here with me with you  
Baby Im satisfied  makin my love to you  
  
Makin my love  makin my love  
Cause you got me hypnotized  
Before you took me by the hand girl  
I was a statue in the sand girl  
  
I was broken down for reasons  
You could never understand girl  
I was living on desire  
But that was just the way we were  
  
Til you make a world of love in you  
We got everything  anybody needs  
And its here with me  with you  
Baby Im satisfied  making my love to you  
  
Cause you got me hypnotized  
Anytime you wander get yourself back to me girl  
Any cloud youre under  you got to get yourself free girl  
Ahh ahh baby with you  
  
Baby Im satisfied  making my love to you  
Cause you got me hypnotized  oh baby  with you Repeat
