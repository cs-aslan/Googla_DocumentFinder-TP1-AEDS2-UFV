There I go there I go there I go  
Pretty baby you are the soul who snaps my control  
Such a funny thing but every time youre near me  
I never can behave  
You give me a smile and then Im wrapped up in your magic  
Music all around me crazy music  
Music that keeps calling me so very close to you  
Turns me your slave  
Come and do with me any little thing you want to  
Anything baby just let me get next to you  
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes  
Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies  
How I worry about you  
Just cant live my life without you  
Baby come here dont have no fear  
Oh is there a wonder why  
Im really feeling in the mood for love  
Im really feeling in the mood for love  
So tell me why stop to think  
About this weather my dear  
This little dream might fade away  
There I go talking out of my head again oh baby  
Wont you come and put our two hearts together  
That would make me strong and brave  
Oh when we are one Im not afraid Im not afraid  
If theres a cloud up above us  
Go on and let it rain  
Im sure our love together will endure a hurricane  
Oh my baby  
Wont you please let me love you  
And give a relief from this awful misery  
Oh pretty baby you make me feel so good  
Let me take you by the hand  
Come let us visit out there  
In that new promised land  
Maybe there we can find  
A good place to use a loving state of mind  
Im so crazy daddy  
And I never knew what loves all about  
James Moody you can come on in man  
And you can blow now if you want to  
Were through
