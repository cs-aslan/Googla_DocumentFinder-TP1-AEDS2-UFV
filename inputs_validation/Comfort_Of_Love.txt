Paul McCartney  
There once was a time when I thought if I had a house Id be happy  
There once was a time when I thought if I had a car Id be made  
One by one I achieved my ambitions  
But didnt feel like I wanted to feel  
Didnt feel like I wanted it to feel  
I didnt feel like I wanted to feel  
I needed a comfort of love  
Any place and anytime  
I needed a comfort of love  
Just to get me some piece of mind wooh  
I long for the time when the world is a better place to be happy  
I long for the day when the people who went to sleep will awake  
One by one I improved my conditions  
But it doesnt feel like I wanted to feel  
Doesnt feel like I wanted it to feel  
Doesnt feel like I wanted to feel  
I needed the comfort of love  
Any place and anytime  
I need the comfort of love  
To just to get me some piece of mind wooh  
I needed a comfort of love  
Any place and anytime  
I needed a comfort of love  
To just to get me some piece of mind  
Well I needed the comfort  
I needed the comfort  
I needed the comfort of love  
I needed the comfort  
I needed the comforte
