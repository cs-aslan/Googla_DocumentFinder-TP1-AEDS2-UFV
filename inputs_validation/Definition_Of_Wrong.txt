Nothings wrong nothings right  
Theres no obvious solution to this plight  
Keep it locked out of sight  
Even then its just a matter of time uh oh  
  
Nothings right nothings reign  
Im gonna get a tumor in the brain  
Now youre here now youre gone  
  
Oh whats the definition of wrong  
Oh whats the definition of wrong  
Whats the definition of wrong  
Hangin out down the street  
  
Me and my homies and a couple of hos we meet  
Acting shy talking sweet  
Show me the money honey  
Give it to me talk is cheap  
  
Shaken up also ran  
Youd rather stick your head into the sand  
Now youre lame too far gone  
Now whats the definition of wrong  
  
Whats the definition of wrong  
Whats the definition of wrong
