Di di di di di la la la la la la  
In a spaceship over the mountains  
Chasing rainbows in the setting sun  
Leaving heart and home for the city of angels  
I feel my life is undone  
  
There are pathways winding below me  
In pleasure Ive gone where they go  
In the quiet stillness I can hear symphonies  
The loveliest music I know  
  
How can I leave you again  
I must be clear out of my mind  
Lost in a storm Ive gone blind  
Oh how can I leave you again  
  
Oh its been a long time since Ive listened  
Still longer since Ive walked with you  
For the first time I know what Im missing  
Some answers are no longer true  
  
So I question the course that I follow  
Im doubtful and deep in despair  
My heart is full of impossible notions  
Can it be you no longer care  
  
How can I leave you again  
I must be clear out of my mind  
Lost in a storm Ive gone blind  
Oh how can I leave you again  
  
How can I leave you again  
I must be clear out of my mind  
Lost in a storm Ive gone blind  
Oh how can I leave you again
