Your love Im no longer sure of  
Seems theres times youd rather be alone  
And if Im losing you tell me what did I do  
Oh I wonder just where I went wrong  
Even though I still feel the same  
I cant help but feel Im to blame  
Have I done all that I can do to show my love for you  
Oh I wonder just where I went wrong  
Even though I still feel the same  
I cant help but feel Im to blame  
Have I done all that I can do to show my love for you  
Oh I wonder just where I went wrong  
Oh I wonder just where I went wrong
