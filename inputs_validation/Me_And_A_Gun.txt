Verse 1  
5am Friday morning  
Thursday night far from sleep  
Im still up and driving  
Cant go home obviously  
So Ill just change direction  
Cause theyll soon know where I live  
And I wanna live got a full tank and some chips  
It was me and a gun and a man on my back  
And I sang Holy Holy as he buttoned down his pants  
  
Chorus  
Me and a gun and aman on my back  
But I havent seen Barbados so I must get out of this  
  
Verse 2  
Yes I wore a slinky red thing  
Does that mean I should spread  
For you your friends your father Mr Ed  
And I know what this means  
Me and Jesus a few years back  
Used to hang and he said  
Its your choice babe just remember  
I dont think youll be back in three days time so you choose well  
  
Bridge  
Tell me whats right  
Is it my right to be on my stomack of Freds Seville  
And do you know Carolina where the biscuits are soft and sweet  
These things go through your head when theres a man on your back  
And youre pushed flat on your stomach  
Its not a classic Cadillac  
  
Chorus  
Me and a gun and aman on my back  
But I havent seen Barbados so I must get out of this  
I havent seen Barbados so I must get out of this
