I was just walking that day aimlessly  
You picked the perfect day to bump into me perfect day  
Probably should watch the stars in the sky the night before hey  
For some reason we still met at your store  
  
You baby  
Your eyes have a story that they wish to tell  
And I have my whole life  
And I listen well  
  
Hey  
Look Ill be the confidant  
Tell me anything  
Please start it off with how you took your wings  
  
Oh oh ooh  
Theres nothing else that I have seen  
Theres no getting around it or in between  
Youre out of this world  
  
Except youre not green  
Look  
You dont know what you mean to me to me  
  
All my friends meet you and say youre the one  
youre the one youre the one  
And all my meaningless friendships should be done  
I should just leave them alone  
Baby hey hey  
  
You had a friend  
But he did you wrong  
But Im a Godsent sign that reads please move on with me  
  
You taught me to use my heart and to forget my eyes  
use my heart forget my eyes  
And thats the way to his kingdom of eternal life oh hey hey hey  
Since youre an angel baby youre jobs never done  
Too bad the world wont see you when they dial 911  
  
Thats why  
Theres nothing else that I have seen  
Theres no getting around it or in between you oh  
Youre out of this world  
  
Except youre not green  
Look  
You dont know what you mean to me to me  
  
Theres nothing else that I have seen  
Theres no getting around it or in between  
Youre out of this world  
  
Except youre not green  
Look  
You dont know what you mean to me to me  
  
Theres nothing else in this world like you  
Thats why its so complicated what are you afraid of  
  
Oh oh  
Ive been asking everybody what they think  
Yeah yeah  
I dont know why because they dont know you  
  
Oh oh
