Your heart burns for love  
My soul burns for blood  
Ill take you Ill brake you  
Ill crush you Ill brake you  
If you want me Ill need you  
Ill kill you feed from you  
Ill take you down that road that leads to destruction  
  
Ref  
Come and take a walk with me  
Where the angels fear to tread  
Kiss the flame  
Feel the pain  
In the furnace of our love  
  
I cant feed my hunger  
Your youth makes me younger  
Ill hurt you desert you  
Turn your dreams to nightmares  
Ill cheat you Ill eat you  
Ill maim you Ill drain you  
Come to me come to me  
To the dark side where love sleeps  
  
Ref  
Come and take a walk with me  
Where the angels fear to tread  
Kiss the flame  
Feel the pain  
In the furnace of our love  
Come along and talk to me  
Sing a sweet song of despair  
In your body hear the song  
In the furnace of our love  
  
Ill hurt you you love me  
Ill scratch you Ill cut you  
Youll kiss me then miss me  
I laugh at your torment  
Ill have you and own you  
Be hard and cold to you  
Ill be your dark angel  
Ill be your worst nightmare  
  
Ref  
Come and take a walk with me  
Where the angels fear to tread  
Kiss the flame  
Feel the pain  
In the furnace of our love  
Come along and talk to me  
Sing a sweet song of despair  
In your body hear the song  
In the furnace of our love
