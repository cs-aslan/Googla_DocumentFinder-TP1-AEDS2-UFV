Storm warning on the radio  
Flags and banners  
Armageddon on the late night show  
And like my father before  
Weve got love on the barricades  
Sweethearts who miss  
Battle hymns and hit parades  
Armageddon cascades  
Whats my name  
Jack of spades  
Outside my window  
Is darkness and rain  
And Im only dreaming  
Til the sun shines again  
Got nothing but a uniform  
General issue and rules that I will warn  
On my name tags are sewn  
Serial number stamped across my name  
My fate is decided by kangaroo court  
Its insane  
Tin soldiers marching in flame  
Whats my name  
Jack of spades  
Outside my window  
Is darkness and rain  
And Im only dreaming  
Until the sun shines again  
Theres no phoenix rising  
And the futures stillborn  
Dark shadows are dancing  
My coat of colors is torn  
In Euro  
Yeah oh  
Supernova on the Baltic Sea  
Push button logic dehumanizing me  
And it gets a lot like TV  
Weve got children starving in the streets  
Genocides the fashion  
And no man withstands its heat  
Kings and pawns all compete  
First gets the oil and the gold  
Outside my window  
Clouds fill my sky  
And Im only dreaming  
That theres still time to turn the tide  
Theres no phoenix rising  
And the futures stillborn  
Dark shadows are dancing  
My coat of colors is torn  
In Euroshima  
Oh no  
Euro  
Euroshima  
Oh no  
Euro
