Hey Chingedy ching  
Heehaw heehaw  
Its Dominick the donkey  
Chingedy ching  
Heehaw heehaw  
The Italian Christmas donkey  
La la lala lala la la la la  
La la lala lala laeeohda  
Santas got a little friend  
His name is Dominick  
The cutest little donkey  
You never see him kick  
When Santa visits his paisans  
With Dominick hell be  
Because the reindeer cannot  
Climb the hills of Italy  
  
Hey Chingedy ching  
Heehaw heehaw  
Its Dominick the donkey  
Chingedy ching  
Heehaw heehaw  
The Italian Christmas donkey  
La la lala lala la la la la  
La la lala lala laeeohda  
  
Jingle bells around his feet  
And presents on the sled  
Hey Look at the mayors derby  
On top of Dominicks head  
A pair of shoes for Louie  
And a dress for Josephine  
The labels on the inside says  
Theyre made in Brooklyn

Children sing and clap their hands  
And Dominick starts to dance  
They talk Italian to him  
And he even understands  
  
Cumpare sing  
Cumpare su  
And dance sta tarantella  
When Santa Nicola comes to town  
And brings lu ciucciariello
