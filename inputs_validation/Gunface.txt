Gonna go downtown  
Gonna get my gun  
Gonna dress real sharp  
Gonna beat my drum  
I aint gonna lie  
  
Gonna walk so slow  
Gonna talk just right  
And my diamond ring  
Gonna shine so bright  
I aint gonna lie  
  
Ive got a debt to repay  
I aint gonna cry  
I put a gun in your face  
Youll pay with your life  
  
And I got my ears  
And I got my eyes  
And I got my narks  
And my alibis  
I wont waste your time  
  
You made one false move  
You made one mistake  
When the juice is squeezed  
Thats the way it breaks  
Youll pay for your crime  
  
Your tongue lickin way out of place  
Ill rip it out  
Ill stick a gun in your face  
Youll pay with your life  
  
I taught her everything I taught her how to dream  
I taught her everything  
Im gonna teach her how to scream  
I taught her all she knows  
I taught her how to lie  
I taught her everything  
Im gonna teach her how to cry  
  
And you cause me hurt  
And you cause me pain  
And you turned the tap  
On my burning rage  
And I cant put it out  
  
Gonna leave no sign  
Gonna leave no trace  
Gonna leave this town  
In a state of grace  
Give me the power  
  
I got a debt to repay  
I aint gonna lie  
I put a gun in your face  
Youll pay for the crime  
  
I taught her everything  
I taught her how to speak  
I taught her all she knows  
I taught her how to eat  
I half invented her  
And now she acts so chic  
I taught her everything  
But now shes obsolete  
  
I taught her everything  
How to read and write  
I taught her all she knows  
She was a neophyte  
I taught her everything  
I loved to watch her grow  
I taught her everything  
And now I want to see her go  
  
I taught her everything  
I got a debt to repay  
I aint gonna cry  
Ill put a gun in your face  
Youre playing with your life  
  
I taught her everything  
I taught her how to cheat  
I taught her all she knows  
She was so indiscreet  
I taught her everything  
I taught her how to lie  
I taught her everything  
Im gonna teach her how to cry
