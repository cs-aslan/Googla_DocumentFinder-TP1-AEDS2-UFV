Runnin through this business of life  
Raisin sand if Im needed to  
Aint so funny when things aint feelin right  
Then daddys hand helps to see me through  
Sweet as sugar love wont wash away  
Rain or shine its always here to stay  
All these years you and Ive spent together  
All this we just couldnt stand the weather  
  
Like a train that stops at every station  
We all deal with trials and tribulations  
Fear hangs the fellow that ties up his years  
Entangled in yellow and cries all his tears  
Changes come before we can grow  
Learn to see them before were too old  
Dont just take me for tryin to be heavy  
Understand its time to get ready for the storm
