Its easy to feel like  
Youre all alone  
To feel like nobody knows  
The great that you are  
The good thats inside you  
Is trying so hard to break through  
  
Maybe its your time to lift up and fly  
You wont know if you never try  
I will be there with you all of the way  
Youll be fine  
  
Chorus  
Dont let anyone  
Tell you that youre not strong enough  
Dont give up  
Theres nothing wrong with just being yourself  
Thats more than enough  
Some come on and raise your voice  
Speak your mind and make some noise  
And sing  
Hey hey  
Make some noise  
Hey hey yeah  
  
You want to be known  
You want to be heard  
And know you are beautiful  
You have so much to give  
Some change you wanna live  
So shout it out and let it show  
  
You have a diamond inside of your heart  
A light that shines bright as the stars  
Dont be afraid to be all that you are  
Youll be fine  
  
Chorus  
Dont let anyone  
Tell you that youre not strong enough  
Dont give up  
Theres nothing wrong with just being yourself  
Thats more than enough  
Some come on and raise your voice  
Speak your mind and make some noise  
And sing  
Hey hey  
Make some noise  
Hey hey yeah  
  
Bridge  
You cant just sit back and watch the world change  
What matters is what youve got to say  
Theres no one else who can stand in your place  
So come on its never too late  
  
Maybe its your time to lift up and fly  
You wont know if you never try  
  
Chorus  
Dont let anyone  
Tell you that youre not strong enough  
Dont give up  
Theres nothing wrong with just being yourself  
Thats more than enough  
Some come on and raise your voice  
Speak your mind and make some noise  
And sing  
Hey hey  
Make some noise  
Hey hey yeah  
Hey hey  
Make some noise  
Speak your mind and make some noise  
And sing hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Make some noise  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Make some noise  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Make some noise  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Make some noise
