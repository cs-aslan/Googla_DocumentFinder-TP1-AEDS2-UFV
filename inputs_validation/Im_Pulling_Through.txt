Im pulling through and its because of you  
When I was stranded came your helping hand  
Lonely hurt I had not known which way to turn  
Til you said Try smiles not tears just laugh and learn  
  
Im pulling trough and its because of you  
You made me see how lovely life could be  
Lifted up my heart and made me count the cost  
To find Id gained not lost  
  
When I thought that hope was really gone  
You showed me I was wrong  
And you taught me how to carry on  
Thanks for the lift in time and thanks for this song  
  
Im pulling trough and its because of you  
Id do the same for you if your turn came  
Hope it never will  
For Ive been though the mill  
I wont get this debt  
Im pulling trough
