I never knew how good love could be  
All Id ever known was make believe  
So many times Ive played the fool  
Baby til I met you  
Now everything has fallen in place  
You can tell by the smile on my face  
For every lonely tear that Ive cried  
Im that much satisfied  
  
Weve got a fine fine very fine love  
Weve got a fine fine very fine love  
You know it when you find one  
Shining like a diamond  
  
Its so fine fine very fine love  
How did I ever live without your love  
Its the only thing Im certain of  
No matter what Im going through  
I know I can count on you  
  
You are more precious to me every day  
Life is better now in every way  
You dont have to lay the world at my feet  
You have made my world complete  
  
Weve got a fine fine very fine love oh oh  
Weve got a fine fine very fine love  
You know it when you find one  
Shining like a diamond  
Its so fine so fine very fine love  
  
Ive got no apprehensions  
Youve got the best intentions  
Weve got a weve got a weve got a fine fine very fine love  
Weve got a fine fine very fine love  
A very fine

Very fine love ah ha ooh hoo  
So fine hey so fine
