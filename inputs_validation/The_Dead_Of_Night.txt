Were the horniest boys  
With the corniest ploys  
Who take the easiest girls  
To our sleaziest worlds  
  
With our lecherous plans  
In our treacherous hands  
Youd be wasting your time  
Saying no its a crime  
  
All that we live for youll regret  
All you remember well forget  
  
We are the dead of night  
Were in the zombie room  
Were twilights parasites  
With selfinflicted wounds  
  
We are the dead of night  
Were in the zombie room  
Heavenly oversights  
Eating from silver spoons  
  
With our decadent minds  
And our innocent lines  
Youll be playing our games  
With your bodies in flames  
  
When delirious fun  
Has seriously begun  
Youll be down on your knees  
Youll be begging us please  
  
All were demanding youll supply  
All were accused of well deny  
  
We are the dead of night  
Were in the zombie room  
Were twilights parasites  
With selfinflicted wounds  
  
We are the dead of night  
Were in the zombie room  
Heavenly oversights  
Eating from silver spoons
