Come on come on baby  
Let me show you what Im talking about  
You try to be a lady  
But your walkin like a sour kraut  
Looka looka lika lika  
Like you want to get some  
If you never tell a lie  
Then you never have to play dumb  
  
Dirty baby time youre gonna take some  
Pretty baby love youre make some  
Little lady hearts youre gonna break some  
Kinda shady tears youre gonna fake some  
  
Dirty baby weve got a situation  
Pretty baby open invitation  
Little lady what a reputation  
Kinda shady now youre gonna make again  
  
I know you can straddle  
The atmosphere  
A tiny storm in your teacup girl  
I know you can battle the  
Masses dear  
A tiny storm in your teacup girl  
  
Every other day you say  
Youre gonna have to bury em  
Famous last words  
Spoken from the laserium  
Descendants had to record  
Sayin somethin bout Milo  
You can take the a train  
But youre gonna have to lie low  
  
I know you can straddle  
The atmosphere  
A tiny storm in your teacup girl  
I know you can battle the  
Masses dear  
A tiny storm in your teacup girl  
  
Dirty baby time youre gonna take some  
Pretty baby love youre make some  
Little lady hearts youre gonna break some  
Kinda shady tears youre gonna fake some  
  
Dirty baby weve got a situation  
Pretty baby open invitation  
Little lady what a reputation  
Kinda shady now youre gonna make again  
  
I know you can straddle  
The atmosphere  
A tiny storm in your teacup girl  
I know we may never get  
out of here  
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
