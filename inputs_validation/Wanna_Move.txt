Scar  
Hey Forever Im on the grind  
My mind is already made up  
Sippin the finest wine  
To Jamaica  
Everyday that I wake up  
I look up at Christ and think  
Therefore he lifts me up  
So I dont see no haters  
  
Diddy  
Let me get shit in order  
I got sumthin for ya  
You ever seen a black man  
Walk on water  
Nigga talk shit to me  
And Ima try to ignore ya  
Get Disrespectful  
And Ima have to come for ya  
Keep ya gangsta with me now wont go get your lawyers  
Cause my combo quick  
They comin like de la hoya  
Watch asses in the streets  
Cause they will come for ya  
  
Ciara

Big Boi  
Need I remind yall  
I started from the bottom  
But Im destined for the top  
And I aint stoppin  
Till I got em  
Call me clumsy for the weight  
Im droppin records  
But they breakin  
Still standin  
Like the fuse on my cannon  
Blowin weight kid  
Top shelf you gotta reach high to be the best  
Im like Hennessey and coke and xo  
And nothin less  
Im the nigga like big I know you know the rest  
Suppose I was a toad  
And no I aint gonna rest  
Ima bang on  
And make this music that we sang on  
A skunk pussy nigga  
Always got my stink on  
Hang on  
You wasnt shit before we came on  
You know you lame holmes  
You do the same song  
Over and over again you bout to game holmes  
Nigga you dont want nuthin

Dolla eight Nathaniel  
Thats how ya get ya collar poppin  
Now blow out ya candles  
You do it ya dont son

I feel high on the music

Its talkin through the melody  
I can hear it tellin me  
To move  
I feel high on the music  
I feel  
I might losin  
Its talkin through the melody  
I can hear it tellin me to move  
Are you ready to press play  
Are you ready to press play

Nah they aint ready  
They dont believe me yet baby  
Yall dont believe me yet
