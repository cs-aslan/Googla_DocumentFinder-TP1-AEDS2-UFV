You know it hurts me when you lie  
Sometimes it even makes me cry  
Cause Im so in love with you  
If you dont believe what I have said  
Take a look my eyes are red  
Cause Im so in love with you  
But all those sleepless night in bed  
When youve been out somewhere instead  
I wonder if you care and cannot bear the proof  
It hurts too much to face the truth  
To face the truth  
  
A lawyer with a case to prove  
Would sift the evidence then move  
Its the only thing to do  
So why then cant I face the facts  
Sift this evidence that backs  
I am so in love with you  
But all the nights when you have said  
You must be somewhere else instead  
I wonder where you go but darent expose the proof  
It hurts too much to face the truth  
To face the truth  
To face the truth  
  
You are the only one the only one  
  
You know it hurts me when you lie  
Sometimes it even makes me cry  
Cause Im so in love with you  
If you dont believe what I have said  
Take a look my eyes are red  
Cause Im so in love with you  
But all the nights you dont show up  
I know its time I should grow up  
I ask you if you care you stand and stare aloof  
It hurts too much to face the truth  
To face the truth  
To face the truth
