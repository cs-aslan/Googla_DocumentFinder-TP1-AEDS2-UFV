Never doubting  
Always faithful  
She returns  
She says she loves me  
And I could always  
Come to her  
She cant imagine how  
Another lover  
Could turn her head  
And Im so grateful  
That Im still willing  
To have her home  
She says she loves me  
She wont forget me  
And then shes gone  
She thinks that later  
We can pick up the pieces  
And carry on  
And Id forgive her  
Still not suspecting  
She could be wrong  
Now Im so grateful  
Im no longer willing  
To have her home  
Now Im so grateful  
Im no longer willing  
To have her home
