Her skin is salty sweet she wore sandals on her feet  
Side by side we fell asleep in her mothers bed  
She stepped inside of me she said dont ever lie to me  
This heart of mine can be yours  
Yea thats what she said  
But I just played the role broke the heart I stole  
Cause I was young and dumb and fucked up in the head  
  
Chorus   
Do you want to be loved for real do you want to be loved for real  
Do you want to beloved Yes I want to be loved for real  
For real Do you want to be in love for real  
Yes I want to be in love for real  
  
Now Im down by the river taking off my shoes  
Jump in the water wash away these blues  
Now out into the ocean the current takes hold  
Words already been spoken tales already been told  
Hearts already been broken wounds already been healed  
Do you wannabe loved do you want to  
Do you wannabe love for real  
  
Chorus 2x  
Her eyes were hazel brown she laughed the sweetest sound  
And I just loved the way she lit up when she spoke  
She help to ease my pain she stayed through pouring rain  
And I gave her all that she could take till she broke  
She fit me like a glove she taught me how to love  
And for some ass I watched it all go up in smoke Chorus 4x
