One minute Im in Central Park  
Then Im down on Delancey Street  
From the Bowry to St Marks  
Theres a syncopated beat  
  
Whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo  
Im streetwise I can improvise  
Whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo  
Im streetsmart Ive got New York City heart  
  
Why should I worry  
Why should I care  
I may not have a dime  
But I got street savoire faire  
  
Why should I worry  
Why should I care  
Its just bebopulation  
And I got street saviore faire  
  
The rhythm of the city  
But once you get it down  
Then you can own this town  
You can wear the crown  
  
Why should I worry  
Why should I care  
I may not have a dime  
But I got street savoire faire  
  
Why should I worry  
Why should I care  
Its just bebopulation  
And I got street saviore faire  
  
Evrything goes  
Evrything fits  
They love me at the Chelsea  
They adore me at the Ritz  
  
Why should I worry  
Why should I care  
And even when I cross that line  
I got street savoire faire
