This is the boy who burns the books  
This is the way he always looks  
This is the boy who smashed his car  
This is the boy who went too far  
  
Washed his eyes with yellow soap  
He stole his daddys microscope  
All alone or in a crowd  
Never say his name aloud  
  
Now he wants to know your units name  
Where you go and whence you came  
Hes the mechamania boy  
This is the boy who never goes slow  
  
He is the one who destroys his young  
Oh no everybody got a new way to go  
All alone or on the telephone  
He knows the time you spend at home  
  
Oh no never say I didnt tell you so  
Washed his hands of his daddys fate  
He put himself in an alternate state  
In a crowd or all alone  
  
No ones laughing anymore
