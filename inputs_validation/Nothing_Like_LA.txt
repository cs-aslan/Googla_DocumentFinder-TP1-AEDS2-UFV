Chorus  
I can show you the paws my balls  
The Taj Mahals to the strip in MIA  
I can show the waterfalls in Spain and Prague  
To the beach in St Tropes  
I can show you the world girl the world girl  
But aint nothing else like LA  
I can show you the world girl the world girl  
But aint nothing else like LA  
Nothing like LA  
  
When they come to LA they got the wrong impression  
When they come to LA they gotta learn they lesson  
When they come to west coast its such an obsession  
When they come to play it out Im just an exception  
When it comes to girl I need your affection  
Every time you walk by you get my inspection  
All you gotta do now is make your selection  
And it wont be hard to win this election  
  
Chorus  
  
I done been around the world I aint impress  
I cant wait till we hit LAX  
Yea Tokyo is cool and yea I feel the UK  
But cant nothing can fuck with California  
Especially LA and Im feeling the bay  
But aint nothing like rolling down PCH  
Top down west bound its all good  
You dont go Hollywood when youre from Hollywood  
Lets go to the hood and fuck with the haters  
Then head to the Staples Center and hang with the Lakers  
Number six is cool but number twenty four is the champ  
And even D Wade and Chris Bosh know that  
  
Chorus  
  
The BET awards and even the Grammys  
They always pick LA over Miami  
I love Miami I aint dissing Miami  
But where would you rather get robbed for your Grammy  
Aint nothing like Sunset Boulevard  
Compton and Watts if you wanna be hard  
We got it all what you thought not at all  
If you sick of this shit than take a Tylenol  
Its just me and my woman verses all of yall  
And we taking a bow for our curtain call  
The angels are lost they dont wanna be found  
If God is looking for em I can show him around  
  
Chorus
