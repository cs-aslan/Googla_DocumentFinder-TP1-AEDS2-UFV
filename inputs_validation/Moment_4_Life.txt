I fly with the stars in the skies  
I am no longer trying to survive  
I believe that life is a prize  
But to live doesnt mean youre alive  
Dont worry bout me and who I fire  
I get what I desire its my empire  
And yes I call the shots I am the umpire  
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire  
In this very moment Im king  
This very moment I slay Goliath with a sling  
This very moment I bring  
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring  
And I will retire with the crown yes  
No Im not lucky Im blessed yes  
Clap for the heavyweight champ me  
But I couldnt do it all alone we  
Young Money raised me grew up out in Baisley  
Southside Jamaica Queens and its crazy  
Cause Im still hood Hollywood couldnt change me  
Shout out to my haters sorry that you couldnt phase me  
Aint being cocky we just vindicated best believe that when were done  
This moment will be syndicated I dont know this night just remind me of  
Everything that they deprived me of  
Put ya drinks up  
Its a celebration every time we link up  
We done did everything they can think of  
Greatness is what we on the brink of  
  
I wish that I could have this moment for life for life for life  
Cause in this moment I just feel so alive alive alive  
I wish that I could have this moment for life for life for life  
This is my moment I just feel so alive alive alive yeah yeah yeah uh  
  
What I tell em hoes bow bow bow to me drop down to ya knees  
Young Money the Mafia thats word to Lil Cease

Doin target practice all these bitches just aiming to please  
Shout out to the CEO five hundred degrees  
Shout out to the OVO wear rings and fatigues ow  
Niggas wanna be friends how coincidental  
This supposed to be yall year we aint get the memo  
A young King pay me in gold  
Forty got a bunch of weed he aint even rolled  
These niggas be droppin songs they aint even cold  
Weezy on top and that nigga aint even home yet  
Yeah be very afraid  
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away  
Fuck it me and Nicki Nick gettin married today  
And now you bitches that be hatin can catch a bouquet ooh  
Yeah you a star in my eyes you and all them white girls party of five  
Are we drinking a lil more I can hardly decide  
I cant believe we really made it Im partly surprised I swear  
Damn this one for the books man  
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks man  
Im really tryna make it more than what it is  
Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives ah  
  
I wish that I could have this moment for life for life for life  
Cause in this moment I just feel so alive alive alive  
I wish that I could have this moment for life for life for life  
This is my moment I just feel so alive alive alive for life  
  
This is my moment I waited all my life I can tell its time  
Drifting away Im one with the sunsets I have become alive  
  
I wish that I could have this moment for life for life for life  
Cause in this moment I just feel so alive alive alive  
I wish that I could have this moment for life for life for life  
This is my moment I just feel so alive alive alive for life
