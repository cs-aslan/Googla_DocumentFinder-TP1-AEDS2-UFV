Draw me a circle thats perfectly round  
One curving line simple and fine  
Now add two ears and a lopsided nose  
And if you care add some hair  
Now draw two eyes and make them bright  
Because theyve just seen a beautiful sight  
Sketch in a mouth with a radiant grin  
One coming deep from within  
Youve drawn me a circle and now that youre through  
Its a picture of me after being with you
