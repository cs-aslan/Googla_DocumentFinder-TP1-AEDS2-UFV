Verse 1  
I was pickin up your clothes in the closet closet  
I was bout to throw your jeans in the washer washer  
Till I saw a piece of paper sayin tasha Tasha  
I gotta say I found this a bit shockin  
And some reciepts here that say you went shoppin  
You bought some Nikey shoes  
But why you buyin stockings  
Boy how could you lie to me  
I thought you would die for me  
Im not accepting another apology  
  
Chorus  
After three years Ima let it go  
Cant stand around cryin no more  
Got your bags packed sittin by the door  
Ima leave you heart broken on the floor  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
Im standing by your bed  
And so tempted to pull out your iv  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
Im fightin with myself  
I cant hurt you even though you hurt me  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now  
Let me see you try to live without me  
Now wheres your heartbeat  
Flat line on the EKG  
  
Verse 2  
Well I was home late at night watchin tv  
Got a call from my girl sayin Riri  
Saw your man in the club  
I thought he was out of town doin business  
Said that hed be back in three weeks  
Now Im mad mad  
Sittin in the kitchen gettin sad sad  
Lookin at your pictures  
Boy how could you lie to me  
I thought you would die for me  
Im not accepting another apology  
  
Chorus  
After three years Ima let it go  
Cant stand around cryin no more  
Got your bags packed sittin by the door  
Ima leave you heart broken on the floor  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
Im standing by your bed  
And so tempted to pull out your iv  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
Im fightin with myself  
I cant hurt you even though you hurt me  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now  
Let me see you try to live without me  
Now wheres your heartbeat  
Flat line on the EKG

I did you wrong girl I did  
Had a bunch of numbers in my phone girl I did  
But we been in this relationship to long girl  
For you to be listening to your silly home girls  
Better go on girl  
Now baby think about it  
Everything we do they gonna read about it  
Put it on the radio and tv outlet  
Do you wanna see your picture in that paper  
You know them haters  
You hear that 808  
The drum thats my heartbeat  
Im going numb  
I said Rihanna Im feelin stressed  
Im goin under cardiac arrest  
  
Rihanna  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
Im standing by your bed  
And so tempted to pull out your iv  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
Im fightin with myself  
I cant hurt you even though you hurt me  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now  
Let me see you try to live without me  
Now wheres your heartbeat  
Flat line on the EKG
