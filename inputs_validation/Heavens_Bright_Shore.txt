Out on the hills of glory land  
So happy and free at Gods right hand  
They tell of a place of marvelous grace  
On heavens bright shore  
Pilgrims on earth someday will go  
To live in that home forever more  
Trusting in Him who died for sin  
And rose from the grave  
On heavens bright shore on heavens bright shore  
Theres gonna be no more dyin over there  
Not one little grave not one little grave  
In all that fair land that wonderful land  
Not even a tear will dim the eye  
And no one up there will say goodbye  
Just singing His praise through endless days  
On Heavens bright shore on heavens bright shore  
When I must cross that rolling tide  
Therell be someone on the other side  
Welcoming me to that fair land made perfect by love  
When I walk up the milky white way  
Ill see that home coming in a ray  
How great it must be for angels to see  
A pilgrim reach home  
On heavens bright shore on heavens bright shore  
Theres gonna be no more dyin over there  
Not one little grave not one little grave  
In all that fair land that wonderful land  
Not even a tear will dim the eye  
And no one up there will say goodbye  
Just singing His praise through endless days  
On Heavens bright shore  
Just singing His praise through endless days  
On Heavens bright shore
