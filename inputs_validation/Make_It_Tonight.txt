He let the world right in  
So let this tale begin  
He spoke it out loud and clear  
Then he shelved another frozen tear  
Then he spoke it out loud and clear  
But the pain got in  
  
He always runs behind  
Hes only running blind  
From the hurt that  
Your hearts not worth healing  
  
Come on and make it tonight  
Come on this worlds not so bright  
Come on and make it tonight  
  
He looks at the papers the grooves been jammed  
Look at the world gettin off  
On a rhythm that just hits him out of time  
Easy in the mornin he says its easier at night  
Keeps his secrets clothed in white  
Wrapped so tight its gonna blow his mind  
  
Come on and make it tonight  
Come on this worlds no so bright  
Come on and make it tonight  
  
Look up every time I feel like looking down  
I look down every time you wear that pretty gown  
I look up every time I look around  
But remember we always said  
Its be easy on the way  
  
Come on and make it tonight  
Come on this worlds not so bright  
Come on and make it tonight
