I walk up to my door and hate to turn the key  
Emptiness is all that waits inside for me  
Thats how it is when the one you love is gone  
Thats how it is when your house is not a home  
I look around and see things marked with his and hers  
Little things like this just make things that much worse  
Thats how it is since I live my life alone  
Thats how it is since my house is not a home  
Is there a way out for a soul so torn as mine  
Each day I live Im like a prisoner passing time  
Thats how it is ask anyone who lives alone  
Thats how it is when your house is not a home
