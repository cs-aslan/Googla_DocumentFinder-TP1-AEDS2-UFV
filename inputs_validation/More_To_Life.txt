Free to turn like the wind on a summer day  
Heart worn like a ring around the moon  
And your eyes are ablaze reflections of time passing by  
That remind you theres much more to life than standing still  
  
Or running from place to place in the heat of the day  
Just follow your heart and youll see theres more to life  
  
There beyond the horizon theres another day  
Far above the pain and fear you feel  
The power and the peace the greatest sensation of all  
There is much more to life than youll ever know the rise and fall  
  
Therell always be you and me were moving as one  
So follow your heart and youll see theres more to life  
  
We all have our dreams we all have our visions  
But time after time were faced with decisions  
Which road to follow How hard to fight  
Then you wake up and see that theres much more to life  
  
Free in acres of sky on a summer day  
Fire that burns with hope inside your heart  
We are never apart reflections of time passing by  
That remind you theres much more to life  
  
So just follow your heart and youll see  
If you follow your heart youll be free  
Cause theres more to life more to life
