Deep in the bayou en route to LA  
The merchandise is changing sides  
People are hiding and waiting all day  
Til midnight comes around  
Thats when its coming down  
And the dreams of a boy  
And his shortcut to easy street will die  
  
Back in the city shes biting her nails  
Taking it hard  hes doing it for her  
She didnt ask and all he would say  
Its what he had to do  
To make her dreams come true  
But a whisper went round on the dark side of town  
And anything that could go wrong  
Is going wrong right now  
  
Midnight when it all comes down  
Only the brave and the fools are around  
Midnight when it all comes down  
Poor little fool his bravery wont help him now  
  
Touchdown on the water and into the trees  
Hes come so far and this is the easy part  
Just gotta follow the flashlight he sees  
And thats where he gets paid  
His fortune will be made  
But a house in the country  
And an acre of green  
Will always be a dream  
They never even knew his name  
  
Midnight when it all comes down  
Only the brave and the fools are around  
Midnight when it all comes down  
Poor little fool his bravery wont help him now
