Can I introduce myself  
Im a man of panache and wealth  
Sound in mind body soul and health  
Why I wanna kill my wife  
I have this urge to take her life  
  
Been planing for years to get rid of her  
Not divorce I really do mean to kill her  
Shes so full of useless information and trivia  
Thats why I wanna kill my wife  
I have a duty to take her life  
  
Her stupid friends get right up my nose  
They all wear annoyingly sensible clothes  
Theyre all so bleeding grandiose  
You know why I should kill her friends  
Theyre all driving Mercedes Benz  
  
Hell escape down into Mexico  
Sell the house and find a nice young girl  
Hell laugh and sing and he wont work anymore  
  
Should I string her up or strangle her in bed  
Suffocate that little venomous head  
Or perhaps Ill just whip her to death  
Listen do me a favor kill my wife  
  
Do it for mankind take her life  
Or should I act quite cold and deliberate  
Or maybe blow out her brains with a bullet  
Theyll think suicide they wont know who done it  
Im gonna kill my wife Im really gonna take her life  
  
Hell escape down into Mexico  
Go down into Mexico  
Sell the house and find a nice young girl  
Find a nice young girl  
Hell laugh and sing and he wont work no more  
  
The moment of truth has come  
Im at the point of no return  
Ive got my hands locked round her throat  
Im about to kill my wife  
  
Dont stop me now Im gonna take her life  
Too late now Im gonna kill my wife  
Cant help myself Im gonna take her life  
  
Telephone rang and he woke from his sleep  
His wife snoring soundly next to him  
It was all a very nasty dream
