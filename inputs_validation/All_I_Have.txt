Dont take away my heaven dont take away my heart  
Close your eyes to seven but do not tear apart  
Its an endless fire its an endless dream  
I feel love and desire oh its really love it seems  
  
Chorus  
All I have all I need and all I want is you tonight  
All I see and all I feel is just holding you so tight  
All I miss all I dream and all I want is your sweet love  
All I miss is you where ever I go and whatever I do  
  
My love is getting stronger my love is here to stay  
I cant wait no longer baby make my day  
Oh tonight I am lonely so lonely without you  
Know that your the only and that my heart is true  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh its now or never is it no empty way  
I will stay forever baby what can I say  
I miss you like crazy where did you sleep last night  
Nobody knows you baby shouldnt you stay by my side
