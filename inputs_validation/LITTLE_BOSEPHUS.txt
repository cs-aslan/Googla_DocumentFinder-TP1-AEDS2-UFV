LITTLE BOSEPHUS  
WRITER HANK WILLIAMS  
Little Bosephus youre the one makes me feel good inside  
Just to know that youre my son makes my heart swell with pride  
Ive always needed one like you to love and understand  
Now that youve come to fill that place youre my buddy man to man  
There comes a time when every boy grows so cocksure with life  
So that he feels he knows it all and no longer needs advice  
The complicated phase of life is called adolescent age  
And sometimes breaks a fathers heartwish you could skip that stage  
Id like to help you fill your heart with kindness faith and truth  
Protect you from the hands that reach out to destroy manhood and you  
There is so much sorrow and despair to blight the hearts of men  
And the more we learn of love and life the more they come crowding in  
Its just little things at first my son then as we grow older  
Our troubles grow much bigger too and sometimes they overflow  
The poisoned minds and broken hearts will cause strongest men to weep  
Overwhelm souls with bitterness and death would be so sweet  
So we must build a strong defense of love and fortitude  
On character and knowledge son so these ills cannot intrude  
Ah Sonny boy so many things a youngster needs to know  
If he is to find true happiness as down through this life he goes  
Its just a fathers love I guess that comes to every Dad  
That makes me want to shelter you from things that make you sad  
Bosephis boy Im standing by to help you when you call  
For Son you are my flesh and blood and the grandest pal of all
