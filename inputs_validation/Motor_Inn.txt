I met a little girl  
With a heart of stone  
She said she wanna give me  
An instant bone  
  
I took her for a ride  
In my classic car  
We didnt even stop  
At a whiskey bar  
  
Her titties look hard  
And her bootys got a rise  
Soon my hands will be  
Where Im putting my eyes  
  
Steady energy and  urgency  
We got out of the car  
Now here we are  
At the motor inn  
At the motor inn  
At the motor inn  
I guess were living in sin  
  
Shes got three kids and a husband at home  
He doesnt have a clue how to make her groan  
Im waiting in the room gonna do it like hell  
Come on baby come on baby ring my bell  
  
At the motor inn  
At the motor inn  
At the motor inn  
I guess were living in sin  
  
Theres gonna be a war  
So we gotta be quick  
The place is full of desperate horny  
Chicks and dicks  
The expresident is in number six  
I hard can hardly wait to get my licks  
  
At the motor inn  
At the motor inn
