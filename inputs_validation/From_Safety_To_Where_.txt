No I dont know just why  
No I dont know just why  
Which way to turn  
Ive got this ticket to use  
  
Through childlike ways rebellion and crime  
To reach this point and retreat back again  
The broken hearts all the wheels that have turned  
The memories scarred and the vision is blurred  
  
No I dont know just why  
Dont know which way to turn  
The best possible use  
  
Just passing through til we reach the next stage  
But just to where well its all been arranged  
Just passing through but the break must be made  
Should we move on or stay safely away  
  
Through childlike ways rebellion and crime  
To reach this point and retreat back again  
The broken hearts all the wheels that have turned  
The memories scarred and the vision is blurred  
  
Just passing through til we reach the next stage  
But just to where well its all been arranged  
Just passing through but the break must be made  
Should we move on or stay safely away
