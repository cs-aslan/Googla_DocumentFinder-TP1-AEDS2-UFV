Id like That if we could cycle down some lane  
Id like that if we could ride into the rain  
No macs getting wet  
Id be your Albert if youd be Victoria hah hah  
Wed laugh because each drop would make me grow up  
Really high really high like a really high thing  
Say a sunflower  
  
Id like that  
  
Id like that What would you like if we could lay before my fire  
Id like that What would you like if you could slide me from this wire  
Toasting fork Ill be done  
I wouldnt hector if youd be Helen of Troy oh boy  
Wed laugh because each flame would make me grow up  
Really high really high like a really high thing  
Say a sunflower  
  
Id Like that  
  
Id smile so much my face would crack in two  
And you could fix it with your kissing glue  
Id like that  
Yes Id like that  
  
Id like that what would you like if we could float away in bed  
Id like that what would you like if I could row your heart and head  
With you laid on one arm  
Id be your Nelson if youd be my Hamilton what fun  
Wed laugh because each stroke would make me grow up  
Really high really high like a really high thing  
Say a sunflower repeats  
  
Say a sunflower I became  
Id be growing in your lane
