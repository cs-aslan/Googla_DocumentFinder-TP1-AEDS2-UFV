Everyday  
Im on my knees to pray  
Since I kissed you once  
And I held you once  
Things have never been the same  
  
And Ive tried  
God knows Ive tried  
But theres nothing left  
In the world today  
Thats making sense in any way  
  
Even now Im in love with you  
No matter what you put me through  
Therell always be someone like you  
Who lets me down again  
  
But every time  
Ive tried to make you mine  
It seems theres nothing else  
I will ever find  
That will make you stay  
Make you change your mind  
Sad to say  
Its the same thing everyday  
But theres no one else  
In the world today  
That will make it change  
Take the pain away  
  
Even now Im in love with you  
No matter what you put me through  
Therell always be someone like you  
Who lets me down again  
  
And everyday no matter what I do  
Im more and more in love with you  
I cant believe its really true  
You wouldnt really go
