I was sittin with the sun meltin into the horizon  
High in the hills up above Topanga canyon  
And Ive never been to any other place that made me feel more like movin  
Made me feel like movin  
  
Stopped into a shop where I met a young lady  
She thought I ought to move she said livin here could save me  
Oh and Ive never been with any other girl who made me feel more like movin  
She made me feel just like movin  
  
But I used to wonder why people got so excited  
About movin to California  
Ive only been here a week but Ive been enlightened  
To a whole new way of life  
And it makes me feel just like movin
