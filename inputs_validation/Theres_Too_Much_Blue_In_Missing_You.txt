Like the leaves falling off a tree  
I feel your love is dying for me  
You tell me its not the end  
Where is the love that you forsake  
You forsake you forsake  
  
Theres too much blue in missing you  
I believe I was a fool  
Before you say goodbey  
Oh give us one more try  
Yet I cant forget all the love we had  
Theres too much blue in missing you  
Oh believe my heart is true  
Your love slipping away a little bit every day  
Throw it away its such an easy way  
  
Look at me Im the lucky one  
Without feelings you cant be strong  
Though I call you in the night  
To hear your voice Feel you deep inside  
Deep Inside Deep Inside
