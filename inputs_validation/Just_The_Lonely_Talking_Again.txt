Yeah  
Its the second time around  
For you and I boy  
And believe me its confusing me  
Im afraid to say lets make up and Alls forgiven  
But somethin tells me its heading for heartbreak  
So darling please Im praying that  
This time yeah this time will be different  
That you and I can share this dream that I visualize  
  
Chorus  
Tell me are you really ready for love boy  
Or is it just the lonely talking again  
Are you really ready for love boy  
Or is it the lonely talking again  
  
Now the time before  
When we got together  
You promised youd be forever true to me  
But all I got from you  
Was lots and lots of talking  
Lonely nights filled with misery  
  
So baby please please tell me now  
That when I fulfill your needs  
You wont up and leave me  
Even though you know  
Ill let you come back  
  
Chorus  
  
Really need to know  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell me now  
want to know  
Really gotta know  
Are you ready  
Are you ready  
Are you ready  
Tell me are you ready  
Are you ready  
Are you ready  
  
Need to know  
Really want to know  
Really want to know  
Really need to know  
Are we gonna talk  
Are we gonna talk

I need to know  
I really want to know  
You tell me now  
Are you ready  
No no no Need to know
