Your captivating eyes  
The clever way they smile stops him in his tracks  
And add your pretty face you keep him in his place  
Hed do anything you ask  
  
Theyve broken the mold  
More precious than gold  
When youre standing there the world disappears  
  
It would be a crime to ever let you go  
He should be inclined to keep you very close  
No one else compares  
Youre a cut above the rest  
Hed be such a fool if he should ever leave you  
  
Be careful what you do hes so in love with you you might tear him apart  
To watch the way you move its obvious that you were made for breaking hearts  
The pout of your lips those soft fingertips  
The curve of your waist youre perfectly made  
  
Repeat x3  
It would be a crime to ever let you go  
He should be inclined to keep you very close  
No one else compares youre a cut above the rest  
Hed be such a fool if he should ever leave you  
  
Your captivating eyes  
The subtle way you smile sets him in a spin  
The subtle way you smile
