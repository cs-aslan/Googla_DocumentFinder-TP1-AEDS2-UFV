I know that you decided  
I know you deny it  
But I do believe that you dont have to walk this road alone  
Somewhere theres a fire  
Deep inside a fire  
So why wont you just let me be the light inside your heart  
  
Ill be your angel  
Ill be your angel  
Ill be your angel  
When you need me  
You can call me Ill be there  
Ill be your angel  
When youre lonely  
You can feel me Ill be there  
Ill be your angel  
  
Ill be your angel  
Ill be your Ill be your  
Ill be your angel  
Ill be your Ill be your  
Ill be your angel  
Ill be your Ill be your  
  
No more days of silence  
No more soul devided  
And I do believe  
If we just hold on  
Words dont have to be this cold  
Somewhere theres a fire deep inside a fire  
So why wont you just let me be the light inside your heart  
  
Ill be your angel  
Ill be your angel  
Ill be your angel  
When you need me  
You can call me Ill be there  
Ill be your angel  
When youre lonely  
You can feel me Ill be there
