Oh brother man where are you  
I am bucklin from the load  
I have lost my eye for color  
And my heart cant see the road  
Oh sister come and catch me  
Cause my legs their prime has past  
I am breaking from the sorrow  
And my faith is fadin fast  
Mother father help me  
Im your flesh and blood and bone  
Dont you hear me  
Cant you see me  
Am I doomed to live alone  
Without warmth or love or honor  
Like a dog out on the street  
Am I trash cause I cant manage  
Must I grovel at your feet  
  
Im the boy who fought your battles  
And Im the man who won your wars  
Is it over  
Have you used me  
Im no value anymore  
  
Im your mothers  
Wives and daughters  
Im your fathers husbands sons  
Im the lifes blood of this country  
Im the hopeful precious ones  
  
Am I nothing  
Am I no one  
Once a fabric  
Now a rag  
We treat people like theyre nothing  
Were not fit to fly  
Fit to fly  
No no no no no no  
  
Were not fit to fly  
Fit to fly a flag no no no  
Join the Army  
See the world  
The Marine Corps  
Join the Navy  
Were not fit to fly  
Fit to fly the flag
