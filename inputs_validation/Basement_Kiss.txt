Lucy Grace cant show her face down in the North End Road  
For in Belgravia  
Rumors have been whispered and suggestions have been made  
Did you sell your friends out when the heat got too intense  
You say you like the danger but its only a pretense  
You say you need the money  
When everybody knows you can always fall back on your inheritance  
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms  
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide  
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss  
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss  
  
Whos that sneaking round the door  
You cant come here no more  
Cant you go home again  
She used to sit alone for hours  
Spend her evenings watering dried flowers  
  
When her mother came to stay and finally went to bed  
Lucy Grace was in the front room shooting through your head  
She tried to take your breath away and give you something else instead  
  
Next year shell serve her function in that Audrey Hepburn hat  
It still wont suit her much but shell get over that  
Shell be pale and feign indifference as theyre handling out the prizes  
Spilling Daddys pearls of wisdom  
And her ugly sisters tranquillizers  
  
Why were you so tardy putting up your guard  
When you hurt so easily and you try so hard  
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms  
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide  
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss  
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss
