Over time Ive come to feel  
That everything must come apart it seems  
From the little child to the man of power  
From the beggar to the angel of my dreams  
From the thinnest thread we are sewn together  
From the finest string we dangle over time  
From the highest wire do we walk through fire  
Should our balance ever falter  
Should our steps be unaligned  
Such a big storm yeah such a strong wind blowing  
Such a loud voice calling for me to cross the line  
  
Chorus  
But Im not gonna give up the ghost  
No not gonna give up the ghost  
Im not gonna give up the ghost no not gonna give it up  
Cause I havent the strength to hold out too long  
If we both hold on together we can make each other strong  
  
After all were flesh n blood  
After all were flesh n blood  
After all were flesh n blood  
After all were flesh  
After all were flesh n blood  
After all were flesh n blood  
After all were flesh n blood  
After all were flesh  
  
Drop the mask take away the house  
And forget about the income and the car  
Were all the same underneath our shell  
Weve all been to hell and we know what its like  
And weve shared each others sins  
We all know what its like to give up the fight  
Weve all been ashamed at one time or another  
We all have dreams and nightmares too  
  
When it all comes down well look out for each other  
No one else will  
But when I hear the call when I feel the thirst  
When the catcher comes to take my soul  
Hes gonna have to fight me first  
  
Chorus  
  
Every cloud has a silver lining  
And every soul is tender to the touch  
We are made of stone we are made of steel  
And were all the same when we return to dust  
But when I hear the call when I feel the thirst  
When the catcher comes to take my soul  
Hes gonna have to fight me first   
  
Chorus out
