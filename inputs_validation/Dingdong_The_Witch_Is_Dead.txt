Barbra  
Once there was a wicked witch  
In the lovely land of oz  
And a wickeder wickeder  
Wickeder witch that never ever was  
She filled the folks in Munchkin Land  
With terror and with dread  
Till one fine day from Kansas  
A house fell on her head  
And the coroner pronounced her dead  
And through the town the joyous news went running  
The joyous news that the wicked old witch  
Was finally done in  
DingDong The witch is dead  
  
Harold  
Which old witch  
Barbra

DingDong The wicked witch is dead  
Wake up you sleepy head

Get out of that bed  
Wake up The wicked old witch is dead

And ring those bells out
