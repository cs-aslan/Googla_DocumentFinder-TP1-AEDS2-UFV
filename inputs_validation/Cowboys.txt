Cowboys on the road tonight  
Crying in their sleep  
If I was a hungry man  
With a gun in my hand and some promises to keep  
  
Wanted to change the world  
Watch as easy as murder  
Its all headlights and vapor trails  
And circle K killers  
  
And I know I could look at anyone but you now  
I could fall into the eyes of anyone but you now now now now  
So come on come on come on oh come on through now  
Come on come on come on now come on through now  
  
Chorus  
This is a list of what I should have been  
But Im not  
This is a list of the things that I should have seen  
But Im not seeing  
  
Look in your eyes as these fingertips slip on your neck and make you shiver  
I am just turning away from where I should have been  
Because I am not anything  
Oh anything  
Oh  
  
The president is in bed tonight  
But he cant catch his sleep  
Cause all the cowboys on the radio  
Are killers  
And I am gonna leave fuel of you cause you never  
Make her feel like anything  
She said I want him to feel a thing  
But I can feel I cant feel  
  
I know I could look at anyone but you now  
I could fall into the arms of anyone but you now now now now  
So come on come on come on come on oh come on through now  
Come on come on come on oh come on through now  
  
Chorus  
  
Look in your eyes as these fingers on slip in your dress and make you shiver  
I am just turning away from what I shouldnt see  
Because I am not anything  
Oh Anything  
Oh

Everyones is in bed tonight  
But nobody can sleep  
Cause all the satellites  
Are watching through our windows  
  
She says she doesnt love me  
Likebut shes acting but its just  
If she isnt talking  
Mr Lincolns head is bleeding  
On a front row while shes speaking  
  
I said come all you cowboys  
All you blueeyed baby boys  
Oh come on all you dashing gentlemen  
Of summer  
  
Ill wait for you  
And Saturdays a memory  
And Sunday comes to gather me  
Into the arms of God and welcome me  
Cause I believe I believe  
  
And I know I could look at anyone but you now  
I could fall into the eyes of anyone but you now now now now  
So come on come on come onoh come on through now  
Come on come on come on oh come on through now  
  
Chorus  
  
You look in me and so please wont you look at me  
Cause I am not seeing you  
Look at me  
I want to make you look at me  
Or I am not anything  
Oh anything  
No no  
No no
