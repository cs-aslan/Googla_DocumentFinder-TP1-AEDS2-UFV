In this supermarket city  
Among the native smiles  
You have to pay for attention  
And do the best you can  
Theres a raging silence  
And its charged with action  
Got no time for weakness  
cause Im a bad bad man  
  
Down the streets of darkness  
Where they know my name  
Lies a force of evil  
And a destructive plan  
Theres no time for questions  
When you run into danger  
Dont get too close to me  
cause Im a bad bad man  
  
Im working for the la division  
To stop the inner city collision  
Im bringing law and order  
To the twentyfirst century  
  
I dont care for politics  
You can keep your point of view  
Youd be better off without it  
I got my own bad plan  
  
A tough cop has a lonely existence  
A reputation of  
The highest resistance  
A mean runner bringing order  
To the twentyfirst century  
  
I dont believe in passion  
Dont believe in feelings  
I take peace from the wicked  
Run and hide while you can  
I got no time for small talk  
Got no time for offthewall talk  
Dont care who I tread on  
cause Im a bad bad man  
  
Bad bad man Im a bad bad man
