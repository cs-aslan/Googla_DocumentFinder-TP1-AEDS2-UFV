Out to find the truth  
Behind the myth of  
Man eating man  
Finding bodies tied  
Up to a stake  
You cannot understand  
Filled with ignorance  
You watch them eat your friends  
Ask for evidence  
A hook right through your tits  
  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
  
Trying to escape  
They torture you by  
Cutting off your cock  
When youre dead  
Theyll feast upon your flesh  
Your brains theyll  
Eat and chop  
  
Pray if you want  
Pathetic rancid cunt  
Face reality  
Death your final pleasure  
  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces
