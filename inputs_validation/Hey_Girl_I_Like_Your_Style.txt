Hey girl I want you to know  
Im going to miss you so much if you go  
And hey girl Ill tell you no lie  
Something deep inside of me is going to dye  
If you say so long if this is goodbye  
Whoa  
  
Hey girl this cant be true  
How am I suppose to exist without you  
And hey girl now dont put me on  
Whats going to happen to me when youre gone  
How will I live how can I go on  
How can I go on hey girl  
  
Instrumental  
  
Hey girl now sit yourself down  
Im not ashame to get down on the ground  
And beg you baby Beg you to stay  
Dont go away  
  
Hey girl  
Naw naw dont go away  
Hey girl little girl dont go away  
Im beggin you to stay  
Little girl dont go away  
Hey girl little girl dont go away
