Its ok its ok ok relieve me  
Pins in me pins in me in me you kill me  
The lounge fly  
The lounge fly  
The fly you bring me  
I think Im free but the dogs they  
Wont release me  
  
Dont have a nickel or a dollar but you feed me  
My bottles empty but you always refuel me  
I feel Im sinking but you wont let me drown me  
I wanna fuck I wanna fuck but do you need me  
  
I cant give What I take away And the other understands  
She said shed be my woman She said shed be my man  
And I cant live this way  
Please refill my soul  
  
Repeat Above Once Then Continue Down  
  
  
She said shed be my woman She said shed be my man x3  
  
I cant give What I take away And the other understands  
She said shed be my woman She said shed be my man  
And I cant live this way  
Please refill my soul  
  
  
Repeat Below until Song is Over  
She said shed be my woman She said shed be my man
