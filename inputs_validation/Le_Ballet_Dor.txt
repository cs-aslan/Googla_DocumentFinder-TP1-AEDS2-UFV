Wasted time running scared when all of love needs is to be believed in  
All those springs come and gone  
Passed like trains and box cars leaving  
But I would be lying if I didnt tell you the truth  
They will leave you they will leave you  
  
So come now lets go dance to the sirens song  
Come now leave your damage behind and gone  
Some are lost to you  
  
Wasted time running scared all I need is to believe in  
Something like a summer and I know you need somebody just like I do  
And all of these foxes go down in there barrel to hide  
They will leave you they will leave you behind  
  
So come now lets go dance to the sirens song  
Come now leave damage behind and gone  
So come now lets go down to the dance floor  
Come now lose your mind at Le Ballet Dor  
Some are lost some are leaving some are lost some are leaving  
But Im not gone at all Im not going anywhere at all  
Some are lost to you  
Wasted time running scared now autumns fire is ashes on the breeze  
And it spends away like dust on pearls as winter comes to usher in the evening  
All of these drummers go stand on the hillside alone  
They will leave you they will leave you at home  
  
So come home now lets go dance to the sirens song  
Come now leave your damage behind and gone  
So come now lets go down to eh dance floor  
Come now loose your mind at Le Ballet Dor  
So come now Come now lets get out while the gettings good  
Just come now theres no one left in the neighborhood
