Lifes too short to even care at all oh  
Im losing my mind losing my mind losing control  
These fishes in the sea theyre staring at me oh oh  
A wet world aches for a beat of a drum  
Oh oh  
  
If I could find a way to see this straight  
Id run away  
To some fortune that I should have found by now  
Im waiting for this cough syrup to come down come down  
  
Lifes too short to even care at all oh  
Im coming up now coming up now out of the blue oh  
These zombies in the park theyre looking for my heart  
Oh  oh  
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun oh oh  
  
If I could find a way to see this straight  
Id run away  
To some fortune that I should have found by now  
  
And so I run now to the things they said could restore me  
Restore life the way it should be  
Im waiting for this cough syrup to come down  
  
Lifes too short to even care at all oh  
Im losing my mind losing my mind losing control oh  
  
If I could find a way to see this straight  
Id run away  
To some fortune that I should have found by now  
  
So I run now to the things they said could restore me  
Restore life the way it should be  
Im waiting for this cough syrup to come down  
  
One more spoon of cough syrup now oh  
One more spoon of cough syrup now oh
