Every Christmas  
Its always the same  
Im still here waiting  
Praying for you to finally come my way  
  
Its been so long  
Since Ive seen your face  
If Santa cared for me at all then you wouldnt be  
So so far away  
  
Santa isnt listening no  
And Im losing hope  
Oh God if it isnt too much  
Please bring my baby home  
  
Every Christmas  
Counting the days  
Maybe this year will be different  
And I wont be be alone again  
  
Under the mistletoe  
Let it snow  
Come on home  
Every Christmas Ill wait  
  
Oh every Christmas  
I turn on all the lights  
And I make a fire so maybe the smoke can clear  
That youre home tonight  
  
But I just dont know I dont know  
Well know deep inside deep inside  
I know that you should be here but I feel  
Were running running out of time  
  
Oh oh every Christmas  
Counting the days  
Maybe this year will be different  
And I wont be be alone again  
  
Under the mistletoe  
Let it snow  
Come on home  
Every Christmas Ill wait oh yeah  
  
Under the mistletoe  
Let it snow  
Come on home  
Every Christmas Ill wait  
  
Every Christmas  
Every Christmas Ill wait
