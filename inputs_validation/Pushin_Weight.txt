I got lyrics that wake up spirits  
They told me how to make big hits and spend digits  
Can you dig it  
You fed you dead see red  
My lead yo head I fed  
Like you shit  
I got rhymes push that shit like weight  
My nigga Lincoln help me navigate  
Through this hate retaliate its official  
I got that bomb bomb diddy diddy diddy bomb bomb  
When I hit you  
Push the issue  
My ghetto dope is amazin  
The bitch thats with you already know that Im blazin  
Thats by the number we can slumber on the under  
Girl no wonder you got a ass full of thunder  
The frozen Tundra aint cold enough  
And baby aint old enough  
For this game Im rollin up  
Dezamn it feels good to be the don  
Straight legit while niggas like Gotti just sit  
  
Chorus x4  
A yeah yeah  
I push rhymes like weight

I hold zone like a Corleone  
No more fuckin with that homegrown  
Hit the shit we on  
The rolleos and the baguettes  
You still fuckin with them faggots  
We turn haters into maggots  
Oak on the dash but no coke on the hash  
You broke ass niggas learn to mash like me  
Constantly put the hustle down  
With four or five niggas thats musclebound  
Send your head to the taxidermist  
Wont be satisfied till I get my face on a thermos  
You got to earn this you cant take it  
Cant fake it got to live it or we gots to visit  
Who is it the exquisite Don Mega  
Walkin with my entourage I think Im better makin chedder  
You see me sag in my Jag with the rag recognize the flag  
You better get back everybody want to do it like me  
I got it made been makin rap money since the tenth grade  
Chching

Chching

Chorus x4  
  
I keeps a firm grip on my shit when in transit  
Uncandid its the young bandit  
Fresh out the trenches the wood works  
City of the Tempeon where the hoods lurk  
In search of the rich blocks to lick spots and kick rocks  
From shattered glass down the pig locks  
Want tips by the clock  
You niggas scramblin for fouyan  
And settle for crumbs and croutons  
Im out for armored bucks and armored trucks with armed killers  
Bitch niggas get swallowed by the armadillos  
Aint no harmin me the army full honorary niggas you cant see  
So while you pace bitches and Saturns livin jenky  
I hangs with niggas who got patterns on they hankey  
After Ben Frankeys with the big skullen eyes  
You niggas bound and nullified  
Sit back and mine stack it multiply  
  
Repeat x2  
A yeah yeah  
I push rhymes like weight  
I push rhymes like weight  
  
Repeat x2
