Freedom keep walkin  
Keep on your toesand dont stop talkin bout  
Freedom get goin  
Lots to be learned and lots to be knowin bout  
People gotta reach em  
Sit em right down and then you gotta teach em bout  
Freedom gotta win it  
Gotta put yourself smack dab in it  
  
Hey tomorrow  
Now dont you go away  
Cause freedom  
Just might come your way  
  
Freedom keep tryin  
People stay alive and people keep dyin for  
Freedom so dont lose it  
Ya gotta understand ya just cant abuse it  
Freedom get movin  
Never gonna stop till everybodys groovin on  
Love for one another  
Callin some friend and callin some brother  
  
Hey tomorrow  
Youre not so far away  
Mother freedom  
Well know you well someday
