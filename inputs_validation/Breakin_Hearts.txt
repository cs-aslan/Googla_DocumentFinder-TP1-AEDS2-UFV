See that girl  
She put me in a whirl  
Shes got a way of breakin hearts  
Man o man  
I wonder if I can  
Shes got a way of breaking hearts  
Seems like she is always  
Workin on the sly  
Then she tells her poor man  
Good bye  
Holy smoke  
I wonder if theres hope  
Shes got a way of breakin hearts  
I will not tarry  
Im askin her to marry me  
Even though shes got a way of  
Breakin hearts
