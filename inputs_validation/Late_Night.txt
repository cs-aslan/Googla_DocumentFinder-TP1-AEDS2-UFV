Chorus  
Why do why do I do  
Could it wait  
For me to realize that  
I cant make it in there  
Cause Im a traitor  
To believe it  
Pull back your hair  
And stop the show  
  
I got my clock  
Its twenty after  
My mind is numb  
Awaiting stimulant  
And if I break my head  
Dont shake my hand unless  
Youll charge it to  
Your spiritual credit card  
And I will take a step away  
So I cant be that happy  
  
Chorus  
  
I let my breath  
Go slow like longitude  
Ill let my eyes  
Go slow to follow you  
And if I break my head  
Dont shake my hand unless  
You have your pride  
In a drawer in my front desk so  
Dont take a step away  
It doesnt make me feel good  
  
Chorus  
  
Before that  
Right  
In my head  
Break  
And then instead  
Fortytwo hours away  
Where  
Its in my head  
Break  
And then instead  
When you whisper  
Far away  
Another gone to yesterday  
And I will break my head  
Im already here  
Im already here  
Im already here  
  
I dont need anything from you  
You needed nothing from me  
I dont have anything  
That you could give to me  
  
I dont have anything for you  
You needed nothing from me  
Theres nothing that you can give  
To make me feel complete  
  
I dont need anything from you  
You needed nothing from me
