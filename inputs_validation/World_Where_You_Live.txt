Heres someone now whose got the muscle  
His steady hand could move a mountain  
Expert in bed  
But come on now  
There must be something missing  
That golden one leads a double life  
Youll find out  
Tell me  
  
I dont know where you go  
Do you climb into space  
To the world where you live  
To the world where you live  
  
So here we lie against each other  
These four walls can never hold us  
Were looking for wide open spaces  
High above the kitchen  
And were strangers here  
On our way to some other place  
  
But I dont know where you go  
Do you climb into space  
To the world where you live  
To the world where you live  
Oh to the world where you live  
  
Friends come round  
You might remember and be sad  
Behind their eyes is unfamiliar  
  
Do you climb into space  
To the world where you live  
To the world where you live  
Oh to the world where you live  
To the world where you live  
To the world where you live  
To the world where you live  
To the world where you live
