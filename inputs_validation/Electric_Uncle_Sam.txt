I am the plan I am the man who tells you what and when you can  
Im the old one that torments you I am the voice that tells you to  
Dont get caught with your fingers in my pie  
Mess with me and boy youre surely gonna die  
  
If ever youre in doubt about who or where I am  
Im here Im there Im everywhere  
I am your Uncle Sam  
Electric Uncle Sam  
  
You beg me please on bended knees not to sit among these enemies  
If you feel like you want to dance then step aside and take a chance  
Dont get caught with your fingers in my pie  
Mess with me and boy youre surely gonna die  
  
If ever youre in doubt about who or where I am Im here Im there Im
everywhere  
I am your Uncle Sam  
Electric Uncle Sam
