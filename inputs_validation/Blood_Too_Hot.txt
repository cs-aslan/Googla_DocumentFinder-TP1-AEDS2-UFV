I came all around the world just to be with you  
Ive been flying supersonic between black and blue  
I promised Id be there  
And now Im here and I wont go  
Before I give you everything Ive got  
  
You left everything behind just to feel that touch  
To join the family of spiders really means so much  
Theres a storm up in the air  
Its the power we all share  
When it runs through our flesh and blood  
  
If your blood is so hot  
Stand up and rock with me  
If your blood is too hot rock with me  
If your blood is so hot  
Stand up and rock with me  
If your blood is too hot rock with me  
  
I came all around the world like on flying wings  
To hear you screaming out for more still means everything  
Raise your hands up in the air  
I swear to you that Ill be there  
I swear it in the name of rock  
  
If your blood is so hot  
Stand up and rock with me  
If your blood is too hot rock with me  
If your blood is so hot  
Stand up and rock with me  
If your blood is too hot rock with me
