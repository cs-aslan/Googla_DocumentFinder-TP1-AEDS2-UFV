Times gonna come  
Youll want me back someday  
Times gonna come  
Want me want me back someday  
But you are evil woman  
You dont mean me no good at anyway  
You was blind to me baby  
I give you all I can  
You was blind to me baby  
But still I give you all all I had  
But you bbbut you are evil woman  
Im a strong man  
You caused me so much trouble  
I dont wanna see your face no more  
You caused me so much trouble  
Dont wanna see your your face no more  
Cause you are the evil woman  
Dont want you hangin round my door
