Why do you ask of course Im alright  
I guess I wasnt thinking Id run into you tonight  
Do I seem surprised I guess you caught me off guard  
Yes Im really doing fine no it hasnt been that hard  
  
How bout you getting on with your life  
Theres so much to tell you that I wont even try  
My its good to see you how long has it been  
I must admit I think about you every now and then  
  
Like when I open my eyes when I lay down at night  
Every moment ever since the day you said goodbye  
But youll never know cause I keep it inside  
How am I doing without you of course Im alright  
  
Well to tell you the truth I guess I have felt better  
God just look at you wow  
You make it look so easy I can see it on yout face  
Everything we used to be is gone without a trace  
  
If you want to know right now Im sinking fast  
Girl you always could see right behind this mask  
But I wont give it away gonna keep it inside  
How am I doing without you of course Im alright  
  
If you dont want to know the truth of course Im alright
