Headmaster this is my confession  
This time you wont be overjoyed  
I have destroyed what little faith you had in me  
Ive been such a naughty boy  
Headmaster I am at your mercy  
Ive been such a little fool  
Ive dishonored one who trusted me  
I have broken all the rules  
Ive been with those naughty little girls again  
Now those naughty little girls are going to put me to shame  
  
I wish that Id been born with a little more sense  
This time its a serious offense  
I feel like an Innocent victim  
I feel that I just cant win  
Headmaster please give me one chance  
Please help me to act like a man  
Ive let down the school  
Ive broken all the rules  
Ive let down the side  
Ive committed a crime  
  
Headmaster this is my confession  
Ive been such a little fool  
Ive dishonored one who trusted me  
I have broken all the rules  
Ive been such a little fool  
Dont tell all my friends I bent over  
Dont tell them you made me cry  
Dont tell them Ive been sacrificed  
Dont tell all my friends or Ill die  
Headmaster dont beat me I beg you  
I know that Ive let you down  
Headmaster please spare me I beg you  
Dont make me take my trousers down
