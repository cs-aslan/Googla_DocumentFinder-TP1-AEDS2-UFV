It Starts with one thing  
I dont know why  
It doesnt even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme  
To explain in due time  
All I know  
Time is a valuble thing  
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings  
Watch it count down to the end of the days  
The clock ticks life away  
Its So Unreal  
  
Didnt look out below  
Watch the time go right out the window  
Trying to hold on  
But didnt evn know  
I wasted it all just to watch you go  
I kept everything inside  
And even though I tried It all fell apart  
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when  
  
I tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesnt even matter  
I had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesnt even matter  
  
One thing  
I dont know why  
It doesnt even matter how hard you try  
Keep that in mind  
I designed this rhyme  
To remind myself how i tried so hard  
In spite of the way you were mocking me  
Acting like I was part of your property  
Remembering all the times you fought with me  
Im surprised it got so far  
Things arent the way they were before  
You wouldnt even reckognize me anymore  
Not that you knew me back then  
But it all comes back to me in the end  
I kept everything inside and even though I tried it all fell apart  
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when  
  
I tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesnt even matter  
I had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesnt even matter  
  
I put my trust in you  
Pushed as far as I could go  
For all this theres only one thing you should know2x  
  
I tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesnt even matter  
I had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesnt even matter2x
