Oh Lord wont you buy me a Mercedes Benz  
My friends all drive Porsches I must make amends  
Worked hard all my lifetime no help from my friends  
So Lord wont you buy me a Mercedes Benz  
  
Oh Lord wont you buy me a color TV  
Dialing For Dollars is trying to find me  
I wait for delivery each day until three  
So oh Lord wont you buy me a color TV  
  
Oh Lord wont you buy me a night on the town  
Im counting on you Lord please dont let me down  
Prove that you love me and buy the next round  
Oh Lord wont you buy me a night on the town  
  
Everybody  
Oh Lord wont you buy me a Mercedes Benz  
My friends all drive Porsches I must make amends  
Worked hard all my lifetime no help from my friends  
So oh Lord wont you buy me a Mercedes Benz  
  
Thats it
