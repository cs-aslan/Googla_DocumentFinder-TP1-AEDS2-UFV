Jesus cried wept and died  
I guess he went up to heaven  
Ive been downtown such a long long time  
Ill never make it home by seven  
Wont you come and take me home  
Ive been too long at the fair  
And Lord I just cant stand it anymore  
  
Well I went down to Jasons  
Walked til my feet got sore  
But I never knew what laughin was  
Til you walked out the door  
Wont you come and take me home  
Ive been too long at the fair  
And Lord I just cant stand it anymore  
  
You can give my soul to Abraham  
Give my soul to Saul  
Give my bones to Canada  
My teeth they dont hurt at all  
  
I dont know who made the highway  
I guess thats just my pride  
But I have heard the Prince of Darkness  
On his charger ride  
  
The silver blade is gleamin  
The scales are in his hands  
I swear that night is fallin  
Dont you lose another man  
Wont you come and take me home  
Ive been too long at the fair  
And Lord I just cant stand it anymore
