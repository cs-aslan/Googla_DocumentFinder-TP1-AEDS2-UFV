Rock  
Rock rock rock rock rock rock rock  
Rock  
Rock rock rock rock rock rock rock  
  
Rockin headspace  
Im trippin out  
This is my place  
What youre about  
  
If you come over we can fly away  
Together lets go  
  
Chorus  
Take me down and you love me right  
Spin me all around  
I feel so dizzy I fall into you  
You rock me you rock me you rock me  
You rock me in  
Can ya hold me tight and dont let go  
Take me in your arms and bring me closer  
Oh I want you  
You rock me you rock me you rock me  
You rock me in  
  
If you want to we can race  
Im super fast now  
You wanna chase  
I can fake it because youre mine  
Double time now so get in line  
  
If you come over we can fly away  
Together lets go  
  
Chorus  
  
Rock me in  
You rock me in  
  
My world is spinnin round you  
Dont wanna let you down  
Im lost when youre around me  
Take me so far away from here  
  
Look how Im spinnin round you  
Dont wanna let you down  
Im lost and cant be found now  
Take me down take me down  
  
If you come over we can fly away  
Together lets go  
  
Chorus  
  
Rock me in  
You rock me in  
  
Rock me in  
You rock me in  
  
Rock me in  
You rock me in
