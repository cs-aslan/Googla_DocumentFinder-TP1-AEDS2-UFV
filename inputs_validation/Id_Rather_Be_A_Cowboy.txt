Ladys Chains  
Jessie went away last summer a couple of months ago  
After all our time together it was hard to see her go  
She called me right up when she arrived asked me one more time to come  
but living on an LA freeway aint my kind of having fun  
I think Id rather be a cowboy I think Id rather ride the range  
I think Id rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and ladys chains  
  
When we were just beginning it was such an easy way  
Laying back up in the mountains making love for sunny days  
She got tired of picking daisies and cooking my meals for me  
she can live the life she wants to yes its all right with me  
I think Id rather be a cowboy I think Id rather ride the range  
I think Id rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and ladys chains  
  
Id rather live on the side of a mountain than wander through canyons of
concrete and steel  
Id rather laugh in the rain and sunshine and lay down my sundown in some
starry field  
  
Oh but I miss her in the morning when I awake alone  
The absence of her laughter is a cold and empty sound  
But her memory always makes me smile and I want you to know  
I love her yes I love her just enough to let her go  
I think Id rather be a cowboy I think Id rather ride the range  
I think Id rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and ladys chains  
I think Id rather be a cowboy I think Id rather ride the range  
I think Id rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and ladys chains
