Green River Ive come back to you do you remember me  
Do you remember Molly with the soft blue eyes  
I left here with a lot of dreams none of them came true  
What I wanted was here waiting all the time  
Green River did she come here every evening  
Like the neighbors say she did so faithfully  
Green River has shes gone away forever  
She just disappeared one day as she gave upon me  
Green River if you see her wont you tell her Ill return  
All Ive brought her is myself and this little dream  
Please tell her that I love her and my lesson I have learned  
Green River tell her please come back to me
