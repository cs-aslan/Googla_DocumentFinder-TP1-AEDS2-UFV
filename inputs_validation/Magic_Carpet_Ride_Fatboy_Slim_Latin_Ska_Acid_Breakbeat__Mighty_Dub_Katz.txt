I like to dream  
Right between the sound machine  
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night  
Any place it goes is right  
Goes far flies near to the stars away from here  
Well you dont know what we can find  
Why dont you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride  
You dont know what we can see  
Why dont you tell your dreams to me fantasy will set you free  
Last night I held Aladdins lamp and so I wished that I could stay  
Before the thing could answer me well someone came and took the lamp away  
I looked around a lousy candle was all I found  
Well you dont know what we can find  
Why dont you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride  
Well you dont know what we can see  
Why dont you tell your dreams to me Fantasy will set you free  
Close your eyes girl look inside girl let the Sound take you away  
You dont know what we can find  
Why dont you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride  
Well you dont know what we can find  
Why dont you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride
