Start Im might start with this  
Just a single thought followed by words  
I hope I dont miss miss anything  
Write you a letter but its better that you hear me  
  
I suppose I could sing  
Write a song to share the meaning  
Of the love for you Im feeling  
People saying what they will I dont care  
  
Im hearing voices all around  
Im hearing voices calling out  
What would they say  
What would it change  
  
Im hearing voices all around  
Im hearing voices making sounds  
What would they take  
What would they say to me if only I was listening  
  
Catch my 22 Id gladly give it to somebody  
Because I only wanna be with you  
I lost and used your love  
I start to drown and you go and pull me up  
Dont you listen to what they say  
  
Im hearing voices all around  
Im hearing voices calling out  
What would they say  
What would it change  
  
Im hearing voices all around  
Im hearing voices making sounds  
What would they take  
What would they say if I was listening  
  
Come here theres something I should tell you  
Darling dont fear cause I am going going away  
  
Voices all around  
Im hearing voices  
What will they say  
What will they say  
  
Im hearing voices  
Voices all  
Voices all around  
Im hearing voices all around
