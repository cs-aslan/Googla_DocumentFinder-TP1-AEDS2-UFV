A different boss at work  
That might do me well  
Cause Im kinda mad at someone  
Who thinks that they can tell me what to say and do  
Everybodys got a butt and a point of view  
  
Well I used to like to go fishin  
Watch that hook and line  
But I sold my boat and motor  
And everybody wondered why  
  
That aint good  
No that aint good cause that aint me  
  
My wife went to a lawyer  
I never dreamed she would  
Now my address is rock bottom  
And they know me in this neighborhood  
  
That aint good  
No no that aint good I need to get out of here  
  
Watchin these nuts on TV  
Blowin themselves to hell  
So they can all get to heaven  
And my kids want me to tell  
Tell em why  
Did all those people have to die  
  
No that aint good  
Cause I dont know why  
  
Went to church Sunday morning  
Never thought I could  
Prayed to the man to help me  
Get back to being myself like I should  
  
It done me good  
Yeah it done me good  
You gotta look for the good in this world
