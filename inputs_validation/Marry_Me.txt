Say that youll marry me  
Sometimes carry me  
And I will be there forever more  
For you  
  
And if you marry me  
I will give everything  
And I will do anything that you need  
We do  
  
Youll know by the love in my eyes  
And the beat of my heart  
Ill be there  
  
Youll know cause youll never be lonely again  
Anytime anywhere  
This I promise  
If you Marry me  
  
Promise youll stay with me  
Well make some memories  
And maybe a dream or two  
Will come true who knows  
  
This I can say for sure  
All that I have is yours  
Youll never wonder where I stand  
It shows  
  
Youll know by the love in my eyes  
And the beat of my heart  
Ill be there  
  
Youll know cause youll never be lonely again  
Anytime anywhere  
All I promise you I will be  
If youll only say youll Marry me

And Ill love you for all Im worth  
If you say you will Marry me  
Wont you Marry me
