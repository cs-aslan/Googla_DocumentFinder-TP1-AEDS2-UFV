Im like a toy balloon  
And someone cruel has cut the string  
Im drifting out of sight  
My heads too light to find a thing  
Oh baby life is like a cartoon movie  
Being with you makes it groovy  
Everything you do is new to me  
  
And do you feel it too  
Do you find another joy in every little thing you do  
Oh do you feel it too do you find the only thing  
That matters now is me and you  
  
I cant believe my ears  
You know I hear such crazy sounds  
Each time I talk to you  
And walk with you Im off the ground  
Oh baby love is great you just cant top it  
Got the ball we mustnt drop it  
Girl there aint a thing can stop it now  
  
And do you feel it too  
Do you find another joy in every little thing you do  
Oh do you feel it too do you find the only thing  
That matters now is me and you  
Tell me baby  
  
Oh baby life is like a cartoon movie  
Being with you makes it groovy  
Everything you do is new to me  
  
And do you feel it too  
Do you find another joy in every little thing you do  
Oh do you feel it too do you find the only thing  
That matters now is me and you
