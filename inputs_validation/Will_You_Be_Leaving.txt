You may walk away in anger  
Wear your heart upon your sleeve  
You make act like it dont matter  
Keep me laughing while you leave  
But burning bridges wont get me back  
If you change your mind some day  
Why cant we turn this scene around  
Before you walk away  
Will you be leaving leaving me today  
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand  
Crumbling in our hand  
I cant live this scene again  
You may turn away in silence  
While the tears run down your face  
Say theres nothing left to bind us  
Leaving love without a trace  
But if I loved you well  
Youd soon find out why your new love falls some day  
Why cant we burn this heartache down  
Before you walk away  
Will you be leaving leaving me today  
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand  
Crumbling in our hand  
I cant live this scene again  
Will you be leaving leaving me today  
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand  
Crumbling in our hand  
I cant live this scene again
