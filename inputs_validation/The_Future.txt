Give me back my broken night  
My mirrored room my secret life  
Its lonely here  
Theres no one left to torture  
Give me absolute control  
Over every living soul  
And lie beside me baby  
Thats an order  
  
Give me crack and anal sex  
Take the only tree thats left  
And stuff it up the hole  
In your culture  
Give me back the berlin wall  
Give me stalin and st paul  
Ive seen the future brother  
It is murder  
  
Things are going to slide slide in all directions  
Wont be nothing  
Nothing you can measure anymore  
The blizzard the blizzard of the world  
Has crossed the threshold  
And it has overturned  
The order of the soul  
When they said repent repent  
I wonder what they meant  
When they said repent repent  
I wonder what they meant  
When they said repent repent  
I wonder what they meant  
  
You dont know me from the wind  
You never will you never did  
Im the little jew  
Who wrote the bible  
Ive seen the nations rise and fall  
Ive heard their stories heard them all  
But loves the only engine of survival  
Your servant here he has been told  
To say it clear to say it cold  
Its over it aint going  
Any further  
And now the wheels of heaven stop  
You feel the devils riding crop  
Get ready for the future  
It is murder  
  
Things are going to slide  
  
Therell be the breaking of the ancient  
Western code  
Your private life will suddenly explode  
Therell be phantoms  
Therell be fires on the road  
And the white man dancing  
Youll see a woman  
Hanging upside down  
Her features covered by her fallen gown  
And all the lousy little poets  
Coming round  
Tryin to sound like charlie manson  
And the white man dancin  
  
Give me back the berlin wall  
Give me stalin and st paul  
Give me christ  
Or give me hiroshima  
Destroy another fetus now  
We dont like children anyhow  
Ive seen the future baby  
It is murder  
  
Things are going to slide  
  
When they said repent repent
