I got my stitches stitched I got my fixes fixed  
In my aching heads I got my kisses slipped  
Our gossip lips stuttered every word I said I said  
I got your love letters corrected the grammar and sent them back  
Its true romance is dead I shot it in the chest then in the head  
  
And if you wanna go down in history then Im your friend  
Because theyve got me in a band where Ive never seen a heart I couldnt
break  
It was never about the songs it was competition  
Make the biggest scene make the biggest  
  
Which came first the music or the misery  
Were highfashioned were last chances  
Which came first the music or the misery  
Were highfashioned were last chances  
  
Im casullyobsessed and Ive forgiven death  
I am indifferent yet Im a total wreck  
Im every cliche but I simply do it best  
  
And if you wanna go down in history then Im your friend  
Because theyve got me in a band where Ive never seen a heart I couldnt
break  
It was never about the songs it was competition  
Make the biggest scene make the biggest  
  
Which came first the music or the misery  
Were highfashioned were last chances  
Which came first the music or the misery  
Were highfashioned were last chances  
  
Go  
  
I went to sleep a poet and I woke up a fraud  
To calm your nerves Im feeling for my clothes in the dark  
  
Which came first the music or the misery  
Were highfashioned were last chances  
  
Which came first the music or the misery  
Were highfashioned were last chances  
Which came first the music or the misery  
Were highfashioned were last chances
