Verse 1  
Therell be days your heart dont wanna beat  
You pray more than you breathe  
And you just wanna fall to pieces  
And nights those 2 AM calls  
Where dreams become walls  
And you just need a break  
Break on me  
  
Chorus  
Shatter like glass  
Come apart in my hands  
Take as long as it takes girl  
Break on me  
Put your head on my chest  
Let me help you forget  
When your heart needs to break  
Just break on me  
  
Verse 2  
Therell be times when someone you know  
Becomes someone you knew  
But youd do anything to change it  
And words you wanna take back  
But you know you cant  
When the page just wont turn  
And it still hurts  
Break on me  
  
Chorus  
Shatter like glass  
Come apart in my hands  
Take as long as it takes girl  
Break on me  
Put your head on my chest  
Let me help you forget  
When your heart needs to break  
Just break on me  
  
Bridge  
Oh when you need somebody  
When you need somebody right now  
Youre where Ill be  
Break on me  
  
Chorus  
Shatter like glass  
Come apart in my hands  
Take as long as it takes girl  
Break on me  
Put your head on my chest  
Let me help you forget  
When your heart needs to break  
Just break on me  
Break on me  
Break on me baby
