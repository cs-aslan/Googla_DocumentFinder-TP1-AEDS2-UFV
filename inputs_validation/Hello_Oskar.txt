Over there well hes wondering  
Is Oskar there is Oskar all right  
Was never cool not allowed to fit  
He never knew what he liked  
Over there hes the rubberman  
A rubber dress with Betty Page eyes  
Was never cool hell never settle down  
Hes not allowed to drive  
Hell build a bridge then walk around  
Dont ever call him dumb hes not that bright  
Hes just not himself  
I will take you somewhere  
Somewhere to unwind  
Youre tangled up in all this shit  
I will make you mine  
Over there hes a superstar  
A taxi man and a young Einstein
