Pocket full of money  
Got a big smile all on my face  
Boy and I can charm the diamonds  
right off the back of a rattlesnake  
  
But youve got me so confused  
Cut me cold as ice  
I aint used to losing  
Guess Im playing with loaded dice  
  
Well the first time that I saw you  
Said youd just dumped your old man  
Then the next time you was dealin  
Must have dealt me a losing hand  
Woman I tried to win your love  
Just cant pay the price  
Keep throwing in sevens  
I keep on playing with loaded dice  
  
Well I thought I was a hustler  
But you sent me back to school  
Keep playing some new game  
Making up your own rules  
Must be some kind of crazy  
let you fool me twice  
I dont know why  
I keep playing with loaded dice  
  
Well tonight I hit the jackpot  
I was shining like a diamond ring  
Lady luck was smiling  
And the old snake charmer was doing his thing  
  
You saw the tables turn  
man it sure felt nice  
Now we see whos laughing  
Now we see whos playing with the loaded dice  
  
Girl you aint like nothing  
Ive ever seen before  
Keep throwing in aces  
I keep coming back for more  
Guess I should have listened  
But you cant give a fool advice  
Dont know why I keep playing with loaded dice
