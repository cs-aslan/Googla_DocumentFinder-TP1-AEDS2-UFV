Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
One man likes to push a plow  
The other likes to chase a cow  
But thats no reason why they cant be friends  
  
Territory folks should stick together  
Territory folks should all be pals  
Cowboys dance with the farmers daughters  
Farmers dance with the ranchers gals  
  
Territory folks should stick together  
Territory folks should all be pals  
Cowboys dance with the farmers daughters  
Farmers dance with the ranchers gals  
  
Id like to say a word for the farmer  
  
Well say it  
  
He come out west and made a lot of changes  
  
Thats right  
  
He come out west and built a lot of fences  
And built em right across our cattle ranges  
  
Why dont you dirt strangers go back to Missouri Where you belong  
  
We got just as much right here  
  
Shut up  
The farmer a good in criticism  
No matter what the cowman says or thinks  
You seldom see Im drinkin in a bar room  
  
Unless somebody else is buying drinks  
  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
The cowman ropes a cow with ease  
The farmer steals her butter and cheese  
Thats no reason why they cant be friends  
  
Territory folks should stick together  
Territory folks should all be pals  
Cowboys dance with the farmers daughters  
Farmers dance with the ranchers gals  
  
Id like to say a word for the cowboy  
  
You would  
  
The road he treads is difficult and stony  
He rides fer days on end with just a pony for a friend  
  
I sure am feeling sorry for the pony  
  
The farmer should be sociable with the cowboy  
If he rides by an asks fer food and water  
Dont treat Im like a louse  
Make him welcome in your house  
  
But be sure that youve locked up your wife and daughters  
  
They all offend themselves at the same time and fight  
  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
One man likes to push a plow  
The other likes to chase a cow  
But thats no reason why they cant be friends  
  
Gun shot

Break it up ya two ol fools Alright Andrew sing it  
Dumdahdeeumdumdum  
  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
One man likes to push a plow  
The other likes to chase a cow  
But thats no reason why they cant be friends  
  
And when this territory is a state  
An joins the Union just like all the others  
The farmer the cowman and the merchant  
Must all behave theirselves and act like brothers  
  
Ill teach you all a little sayin  
And learn the words by heart the way you should  
I dont say Im no better than anybody else  
But Ill be danged if I aint just as good  
  
I dont say Im better than anybody else  
But Ill be danged if I aint just as good  
  
Territory folks should stick together  
Territory folks should all be pals  
Cowboys dance with the farmers daughters  
Farmers dance with the ranchers gals
