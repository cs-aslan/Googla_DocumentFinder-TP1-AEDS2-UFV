Now they saying were too hot  
New verses please cmon Malice  
  
Hot damn its a new day  
Hot damn but them boys want the money man  
Uhhuh of course fore you say what you say hot damn  
  
My how the boys roam from roaming  
Loc and come home to homes of his own  
No catching up hes in a whole nother zone  
Still true to his roots stay close to the chrome  
  
Haters stay clear of him yall stand cheer for him  
Got up out the game and overcame lets hear it for him  
Keep a new toy so I wonder how could  
I not enjoy life Im reliving my childhood  
  
Big chain monsta whip game bonkas  
Monster truck remind him of Tonka  
Diamond F color plush gold still gutter  
My dealers in the mills motherfuck and I aint studder  
  
Bitter sweet my lifes a musical  
From holding those to Bose gold the Lords beautiful  
Before him Im too shamed to show my face  
But shits so mean I cant help but to fall from grace motherfucker  
  
Hot damn its a new day  
Hot damn but them boys want the money man  
  
Hot damn when the white hit the pan it  
Twists and it tumbles it flips and the fumbles  
I mix it like Gumbo I pitch it so subtle  
I keep hustlers puzzled Feds I got em wondering  
Wondering  
  
What Happened To That boy  
Six maneuver howd I slip into that toy  
Is it the pimp the crook the hustling thing  
The man the music that making a king  
  
Im simply building my Ming  
A million men marchin like condom unverified  
Im the King Kong my verse making the world sing  
My hearts on the sleeve for  
  
Your face is just like mine  
Peeking from bars hoping the sun shines on em  
But you still got to watch the phonies  
Watch your homies we got you homie  
  
Hot damn its a new day  
Hot damn but them boys want the money man  
  
Uhh handle the rock like none other  
Grits over the stove head under the cupboard  
In the kitchen till the fume make me feel smothered  
The way it melt fiends cant believe its not butter  
  
The way it melt he wont cop from none other  
The he who holds Os like Krispy Kremes oven  
Or easy bake pink divvies make  
The presidential should look like strawberry shortcake P  
  
Imagine that Rolls Royce crashed in me unscratched in  
That millionaire boys club fashion  
Uh you niggas is clones  
I hand out styles like ice cream cones the fuck outta here  
  
Thats Pha real my gats is real  
The sl5 is lookin like the Batmobile  
Chrome lids with the matching wheels  
Uh both chains probably match ya deal  
Yall dudes is an act fa real Pusha  
  
Hot damn its a new day  
Hot damn but them boys want the money man  
  
Neither the sun or death can be looked at  
Thats what an O G told me  
That was the exact moment I decided to take a pact  
And if you owe me and if I decided to take it back  
  
It wasnt nicely expect Rosco to put you back in place  
Im what you call a destructive warpath  
Itll be a shell shower in todays forecast  
You a gangsta I cant tell  
  
You diamonds dont glimmer when the light hit it  
Those jewels arent genuine cause if they was Im nice with it  
I woulda been took that  
That skinny stack in your pocket I woulda been shook that  
  
In this world you gotta watch it Im hear to warn ya  
Cats turned informant over snow wrapped in wax  
My sons home crying dont give me no slack  
Just put the motherfucking money in the bag  
  
These words are being said as I hide behind glove and mask  
Coat change not your typical crook  
Im being watched look at the camera lens in the bush  
  
Hot damn its a new day  
Hot damn but them boys want the money man
