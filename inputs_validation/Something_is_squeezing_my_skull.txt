Im doing very well  
I can block out the present and the past now  
I know by now you think I should have  
Straightened myself out  Thank you drop dead  
Something is squeezing my skull  
Something I can barely describe  
There is no love in modern life  
  
Im doing very well  
Its a miracle I even made it this far  
The motion of taxis excites me  
When you peel it back and bite me  
Something is squeezing my skull  
Something I can barely describe  
There is no hope in modern life  
  
Something is squeezing my skull  
Something I cant fight  
No true friends in modern life  
  
Diazepam thats valium Temazepam Lithium HRT ECT  
How long must I stay on this stuff  
Dont give me anymore  
Dont give me anymore  
Dont give me anymore  
Please dont give me anymore  
Dont give anymore  
Dont give anymore  
You swore you would not give anymore  
Dont give anymore dont give anymore  
  
You swore you swore you swore  
You swore you would not give anymore  
Give anymore give anymore give anymore
