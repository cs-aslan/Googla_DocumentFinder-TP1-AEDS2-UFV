The secret of love I thought I understood  
the way its supposed to be  
I never imagined you could blow my theory apart  
But now youre running away with my heart  
  
I dont wanna think about it  
dont wanna think clear dont analyze what Im doing here  
Wanna be impulsive reckless and lose myself in your kiss  
  
Arrows through hearts drawn on a misty window  
Youre taking me home in the rain  
My heart is beating Dont say no  
My head keeps saying take it slow  
  
I dont wanna think about it dont wanna think clear  
dont analyze what Im doing here  
Wanna be impulsive reckless and lose myself in your kiss  
  
Youre giving me a feeling its a sudden rush  
Acting on the moment its spontaneous  
Wo wo oh  
This is not like me to follow my heart so easily  
I am reckless impulsive  
I never imagined you could blow my theory apart  
But youre running away with my heart my heart  
  
I dont wanna think about it  
dont wanna think clear dont analyze what Im doing here  
Wanna be impulsive reckless and lose myself in your kiss  
Youre givin feeling  
Its a sudden rush  
Acting on the moment its spontaneous  
Wanna be impulsive reckless and lose my self in your kiss  
  
Impulsive I wanna be impulsive  
Im gonna be impulsive reckless and lose myself
