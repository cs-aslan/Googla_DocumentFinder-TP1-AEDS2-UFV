There have been times that I wander  
And times that I dont  
Concepts Ill ponder  
And concepts I wont ever see  
God is not one of these  
Former or latter  
Which did you think I meant  
It doesnt matter to me  
  
Bug  
It doesnt matter  
Dont need it  
Bug  
It doesnt matter  
Dont need it  
Bug  
It doesnt matter  
Overrated  
Overrated  
  
Gold in my hand  
In a country pool  
Standing and waving  
The rain wind on the runway  
Spending or saving  
Credit or debt  
Which did you think I meant  
Nothing I see can be taken from me
