Think of you with pipe and slippers  
Think of her in bed  
Laying there just watching telly  
Think of me instead  
  
Ill never grow so old and flabby  
That could never be  
Dont marry her fuck me  
  
And your love life shines like cardboard  
But your work shoes are glistening  
Shes a PhD in I told you so  
Youve a knighthood in Im not listening  
  
Shell grab your sweaty bollocks  
Then slowly raise her knee  
Dont marry her fuck me  
  
When the Sunday sun shines down on San Francisco Bay  
And you realise you cant make it anyway  
You have to wash the car  
Take the kiddies to the park  
Dont marry her fuck me  
  
Those lovely Sunday mornings  
With breakfast brought in bed  
Those blackbirds look like knitting needles  
Trying to peck your head  
  
Those birds will peck your soul out  
And throw away the key  
Dont marry her fuck me  
  
And the kitchens always tidy  
And the bathrooms always clean  
Shes a diploma in just hiding things  
Youve a first in low esteem  
  
When your socks smell of angels  
But your life smells of Brie  
Dont marry her fuck me  
  
And the Sunday sun shines down on San Francisco bay  
And you realise you cant make it anyway  
You have to wash the car  
Take the kiddies to the park  
Dont marry her fuck me  
  
And the Sunday sun shines down on San Francisco bay  
And you realise you cant make it anyway  
You have to wash the car  
Take the kiddies to the park  
Dont marry her fuck me
