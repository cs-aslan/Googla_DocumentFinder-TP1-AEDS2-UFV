I was searchin  
For someone to love me right  
Hear me when I cry  
Keep me late at night  
Jesus came even in my misery  
Wipe the tears from my eyes  
This is what He said  
  
Chorus  
Whatcha lookin 4  
Im the One youre lookin 4  
What youre searchin 4  
You dont have to search no further  
Give you peace and joy  
Fill your life with happiness  
Dont you look no more  
Cause Im the One youre lookin 4  
  
LOVE love never meant that much to me  
Til I saw your face  
I felt amazing grace  
But in the midnight hour  
When I held my pillow tight  
He wiped the tears so I could see  
This is what He said  
  
I never knew love could be so sweet  
The joy You give to me  
Peace and harmony  
I love You so  
More than youll ever know  
What is this that I found that  
Never never lets me down  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
What you want  
Ive got it  
What you need Im the One youre lookin 4  
Its yours  
Im the One youre lookin 4
