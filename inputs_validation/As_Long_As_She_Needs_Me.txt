As long as she needs me  
I know where I must be  
Ill cling on steadfastly  
As long as she needs me  
As long as life is long  
Ill love her right or wrong  
And somehow Ill be strong  
As long as she needs me  
  
If you are lonely  
Then you will know  
When someone needs you  
You love them so  
  
I wont betray her trust  
Though people say I must  
Ive got to stay true just  
As long as she needs me  
  
If you are lonely  
Then you will know  
When someone needs you  
You love them so  
  
I wont betray her trust  
Though people say that I must  
Ive got to stay true just  
As long as she needs me
