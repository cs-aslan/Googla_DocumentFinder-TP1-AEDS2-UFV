When you give your all and youre feeling small dont you cry  
If youre crying loud you wont feel so proud dont you cry  
  
Theres a place to be wont you stay with me you can help us see  
Here we are  
  
Let yourself go by  
You can touch the sky if you try  
  
All youve got to show you may never know what you are  
If you ever try can you tell me why why you are  
Only you will know and you picked your show  
Can you tell me though will you know  
  
If you feel like me you cant help but please who you know  
If youre feelin low will you tell me though who you are  
  
Only you will know and you picked your show  
Can you tell me though will you know  
  
If you feel like me you cant help but please who you know
