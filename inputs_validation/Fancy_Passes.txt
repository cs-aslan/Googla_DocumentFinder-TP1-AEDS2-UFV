Money isnt everything ask anyone whos rich  
It can buy pain and misery or grief  
Though money isnt everything  
I have a paupers itch so though I crave a brave  
Yes Ill take the chief  
  
He bought me a cat Siamese imagine that  
He keeps making fancy passes at me  
All those fine and fancy passes  
  
Oh joy now Ive got sixty feet of brand new yacht  
He keeps making fancy passes at me  
All those fine and fancy passes  
  
He owns New York or Spain but I dont know which  
He got fat in Uptown Manhattan  
Poor Cinderellas got her a fella whos rich  
Every penny hes worth a plenty  
  
He owns United Airlines that as well  
He owns receding hairlines oh well  
Hes not so hip or smart as a whip  
But healthy wise and wealthy  
  
He bought me a summer place  
Somewhere out in outer space  
He keeps making fancy passes at me  
  
What a man youve got Diane  
Did he buy you a mink Passion pink  
And a Cadi too Baby blue  
Youre speaking of My baby love  
Your Romeo My Daddy Dough  
I love him a lot how much has he got  
  
Hes got a plot of ground he found over oil  
Oh my how chic we are  
He bought New Jersey  
So he could call me his girl  
Oh man a feat we are  
  
Chocolate excites my tummy  
He bought me a firm called Yummy  
So hes one of those gents  
With good bizness cents  
And quarters halfs and dollars  
  
Ding dong aint it swell  
They just delivered the liberty bell  
How sad all those Philadelphians will be  
  
Ill get half of what he owns  
To keep up with Mrs L B Jones  
And if he keeps making fancy passes  
Ill start holding evening classes  
  
Ill give him sugar and molasses  
And the life I live Ill live luxuriously  
From those late and evening classes  
That sugar and molasses  
Those fine and fancy passes at me  
My honey yeah
