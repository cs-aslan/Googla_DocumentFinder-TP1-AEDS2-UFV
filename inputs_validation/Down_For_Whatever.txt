Damn  
Im broke  
My feet hurt  
Inside the mind of a car jacker  
And that bitch is slippin  
It makes me wanna creep  
It makes me wanna creep  
  
Damn Im such a G its pathetic  
Here comes the big headed  
Nigga thats dippin  
Sippin on Courvoisier  
Goddamn I must havta floss today  
Now pimpin aint easy but its necessary  
So Im chasin bitches like Tom chased Jerry  
Ill put the pedal to the flouh  
In my twotone Ford Explouh  
You know how its done  
Sounds bumpin  
Aint that somethin  
Jumped on the 110  
Shes flyin in the Blazer  
Like Go Speed Racer  
But I aint gonna chase her  
Like Racer X  
But I wont flex  
Til its time to have sex  
So when you want to get together  
Cause you know a nigga like me  
Is down for whatever  
  
And Im down for whatever  
  
When I was little I didnt want to be like Mike  
I wanted to be like Ike  
Cause  
Papa Was A Rolling Stone in the sixties  
And he liked green like Bill Bixby  
Told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty  
Pokets never skinny  
Played lets get it on in the living room  
And hwne he gets drunk you better give him room  
Cause hell turn the party out sayin This is my motherfuckin house  
And yall gots to go  
Through the door  
And if you cant find the door  
Hell help you with the fourfour  
Talkin much shit on the grass  
And straight down to blast  
Im still in my pjs  
Hes in a turtleneck sweater  
And we down for whatever  
  
And Im down  
Solid Pro is down for whatever  
The Don Jaguar is down for whatever  
And it dont seem to stop  
  
Now  
I dont talk a lot of shit  
But when its time to get busy with these hos lets go  
Cause Id rather see a skinhead dead  
Then my niggas wearin blue or red  
Cause I got the gift  
To hit these hos swift  
And Im smellin like a fifth  
Of somethin  
Yeah thats right  
Im standin in the store  
Koreans  
Act so nice  
Cause I got potentials to blow up a Winchells  
Doughnut  
And you know what  
Im Cool Like That like Digable Planets  
But dont take a nigga for granted  
Cause whether its a verdict of the LA four  
You just dont know  
That this rappinass nigga will change with the weather  
And be down for whatever  
  
And Im down  
Creep  
And Im down for whatever  
  
Ice Cube devoid of pop  
And I will never dance for you trickass niggas  
  
It makes me wanna creep  
It makes me wanna creep
