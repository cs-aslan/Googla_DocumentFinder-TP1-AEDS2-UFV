Ive been where you are before  
No one understands it more  
You fear every step you take  
So sure that your heart will break  
  
Its not how the story ends  
Youll be back on your feet again  
  
Chorus  
Baby this time  
There aint nothing gonna take this heart away  
No more goodbyes  
There aint nothing gonna take my heart away  
  
The pains still alive in you  
For what one man put you through  
You say that were all the same  
But Im called by no other name  
  
We all need a place to run  
Wont you let me be the one  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont keep the dream in you locked outside your door  
Just believe in this love  
And dont be afraid anymore  
  
I need you to please be strong  
Ive waited for you too long  
  
Chorus  
  
This time  
There aint nothing gonna take this heart away  
No more goodbyes  
There aint nothing gonna take my heart away  
There aint nothing gonna take this heart away
