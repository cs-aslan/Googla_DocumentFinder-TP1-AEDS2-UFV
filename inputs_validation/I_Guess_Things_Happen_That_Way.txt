Well you ask me if Ill forget my baby  
I guess I will some day  
I dont like it but I guess things happen that way  
  
You ask me if Ill get along  
I guess I will some way  
I dont like it but I guess things happen that way  
  
God gave me that girl to lean on then he put me on my own  
Heaven help me be a man and have the strength to stand alone  
I dont like it but I guess things happen that way  
  
You ask me if Ill miss her kisses  
I guess I will every day  
I dont like it but I guess things happen that way  
  
You ask me if Ill find another  
I dont know I cant say  
I dont like it but I guess things happen that way
