In a world  
Where people have problems  
In this world  
Where decisions are a way of life  
Other peoples problems they overwhelm my mind  
They say compassion is a virtue but I dont have the time  
  
So many peoplehave their problems  
Im not interestedin their problems  
I guess Iveexperienced some problems  
But now Ivemade some decisions  
Takes a lot of time to push away the nonsense  
Take my compassionPush it as far as it goes  
My interest levels dropping my interest level is dropping  
Ive heard all I want to I dont want to hear any more  
  
What are you in love with your problems  
I think you take ita little too far  
Itsnot so cool to have so many problems  
But dont expect me to explain your indecisions  
Gotalk to your analyst isnt that what theyre paid for  
You walk you talkYou still function like you used to  
Its not a questionOf your personality or style  
Be a little more selfish it might do you some good  
  
In a world where people have problems  
In this world where decisions are a way of life  
Other peoples problems they overwhelm my mind  
They say compassion is a virtue but I dont have the time  
Here we go again
