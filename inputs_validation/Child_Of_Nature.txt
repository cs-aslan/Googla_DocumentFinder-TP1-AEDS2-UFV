I was dreaming of the past  
And my heart was beating fast  
I began to lose control  
I began to lose control  
I didnt mean to hurt you  
Im sorry that I made you cry  
Oh well I didnt want to hurt you  
Im just a jealous guy  
I was feeling insecure  
You might not love me any more  
I was shivering inside  
I was shivering inside  
I didnt mean to hurt you  
Im sorry that I made you cry  
Oh well I didnt want to hurt you  
Im just a jealous guy  
I was tryin to catch your eyes  
Thought that you was tryin to hide  
I was swallowing my pain  
I was swallowing my pain  
I didnt mean to hurt you  
Im sorry that I made you cry  
Oh well I didnt want to hurt you  
Im just a jealous guy  
Watch out  
Im just a jealous guy  
Look out baby  
Im just a jealous guy
