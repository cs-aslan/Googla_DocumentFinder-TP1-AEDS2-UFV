It seems that youve changed in these past few days  
For when I try to kiss you you just push me away  
Now I dont know whats wrong but I dont see how we can go on  
I think your love for me is dying and its all over but the crying  
I called you on the phone just to find out what was wrong  
And the thing you said made my suspicions real  
  
You said tonight again you had to stay with this sick friend  
But that story Im not buying cause its all over but the crying  
Its all over but the crying I never would have thought you were lying  
It sounded so true when you said I love you  
Now I say my goodbying cause its all over but the crying its all over but
the crying
