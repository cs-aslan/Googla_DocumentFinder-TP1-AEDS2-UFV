Block one way Ill find another  
You know youll always be discovered  
If its me you choose I cant lose  
Im in love with you if you love me too yeah  
  
Dont ever change and Ill stay the same  
Well be swimming in the same direction  
And well never lose this connection  
Nothing they can do can stop this army of two  
Were marching to the future yeah its me and you  
  
So just follow my lead repeat after me  
Our faith is the bullet hope is the gun  
And love is all we need  
Now fears on the run  
Weve already won  
Now march with the band raise your right hand  
Weve only just begun
