You want me to go and steal  
A million dollars  
You make me fight an army  
Win and get away  
CHORUS  
Ive got so many things to tell you  
Ive got so many things to say  
You expect me to lay the crown  
Jewels at your feet  
Pour upon you gold and  
Silver too  
Nasty things that you ran away from  
Will catch you up again  
Heroes that you try to be like  
Will make you feel your pain  
Therell you sit alone and lonely  
Everythingll turn gray  
You try to figure out the high  
Life came and made you insane  
You want me to go out and steal  
A million dollars  
I got to hold everybody off  
While you get away
