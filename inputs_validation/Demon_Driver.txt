My one way ride in dead end street  
Leading to victory and glory  
You seek I hide youll find defeat  
My futures in the hands of fury  
You try  but never win  
Cant you see I am the demon driver  
Dont lie it is a sin  
cause you know I am the demon driver  
I live to drive and never wait  
For guardian angels riding by me  
To speed or die Im never late  
Wherever you are there will be  
You try  but never win  
Cant you see I am the demon driver  
Dont lie it is a sin  
cause you know I am the demon driver  
My one way ride in dead end street  
Leading to victory and glory  
You seek I hide youll find defeat  
My futures in the hands of fury  
You try  but never win  
Cant you see I am the demon driver  
Dont lie it is a sin  
cause you know I am the demon driver
