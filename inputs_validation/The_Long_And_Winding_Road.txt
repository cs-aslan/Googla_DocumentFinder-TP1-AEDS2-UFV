The long and winding road  
That leads to your door  
Will never disappear  
Ive seen that road before  
It always leads me here  
Lead me to you door  
The wild and windy night  
That the rain washed away  
Has left a pool of tears  
Crying for the day  
Why leave me standing here  
Let me know the way  
Many times Ive been alone  
And many times Ive cried  
Any way youll never know  
The many ways Ive tried  
But still they lead me back  
To the long winding road  
You left me standing here  
A long long time ago  
Dont leave me waiting here  
Lead me to your door oohoh  
But still they lead me back  
To the long winding road  
You left me standing here  
A long long time ago  
Dont leave me waiting here  
Lead me to your door
