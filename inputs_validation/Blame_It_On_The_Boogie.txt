Ive seen the lightning leave me  
My baby just cant take  
Her eyes off me  
  
Chorus  
Dont blame it on sunshine  
Dont blame it on moonlight  
Dont blame it on good times  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
Dont blame it on sunshine  
Dont blame it on moonlight  
Dont blame it on good times  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
I just cant  
I just cant  
I just cant control my feet  
  
I just cant  
I just cant  
I just cant control my feet  
  
I just cant  
I just cant  
I just cant control my feet  
  
I just cant  
I just cant  
I just cant control my feet  
  
Chorus  
Dont blame it on sunshine  
Dont blame it on moonlight  
Dont blame it on good times  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
Dont blame it on sunshine  
Dont blame it on moonlight  
Dont blame it on good times  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
The magic music grooves me  
The dirty rhythm moves me  
The devils gotten to me  
Through his dance  
  
Im full of funky fever  
And fire burns inside me  
Boogies got me in a  
Super trance  
  
Chorus  
Dont blame it on sunshine  
Dont blame it on moonlight  
Dont blame it on good times  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
Dont blame it on sunshine  
Dont blame it on moonlight  
Dont blame it on good times  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
Sunshine  
Moonlight  
Goodtimes  
Boogie  
  
Sunshine  
Moonlight  
Goodtimes  
Boogie  
  
Dont you blame it  sunshine  
You just got to  moonlight  
You just want to  goodtimes  
Yeah  boogie  
Blame it on yourself  sunshine  
Aint nobodys fault  moonlight  
But yours and that boogie  goodtimes  
Dancin all night long  boogie  
  
Yours and that boogie  sunshine  
Aint nobodys fault  moonlight  
But yours and that boogie  goodtimes  
Dancin all night long  boogie
