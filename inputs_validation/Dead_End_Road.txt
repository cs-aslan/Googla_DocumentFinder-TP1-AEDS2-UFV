Well I feel like Im runnin  
Down that dead end road  
Yes I feel like Im runnin  
Down that dead end road  
I need someone to tell me  
Which way I ought to go  
  
Say goodbye to the mornin  
Hello evenin time  
Say goodbye to the mornin  
Down that road Im plyin  
If I look way beyond me  
Ill be gettin way behind  
  
I cant seem to catch up  
Distance keeps fallin away  
Cant seem to catch up  
Distance keeps fallin away  
Makes no difference where I go  
Dead end road everyday  
  
Lord I feel like Im runnin  
Down that dead end road  
Well I feel like Im runnin  
Down that dead end road  
I need someone to tell me  
Which way I ought to go
