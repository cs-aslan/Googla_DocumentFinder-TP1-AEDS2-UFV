You are welcome in this place  
Welcome in our hearts  
Come and have Your way  
God meet us face to face  
All consuming fire  
Move without restraint  
  
Breathe on us  
Spirit come  
Youre our hearts desire  
  
We stand in the glory of the King  
Knowing that Youre here  
You have set us free  
Youre here  
Let our worship be Your throne  
Amazed by who You are  
Your presence makes us whole  
  
Let the Heavens open  
Let Your Kingdom move  
All our faith and hope in  
Our great God
