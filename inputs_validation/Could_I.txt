I could I could keep you company could  
I could I could keep you so happy can  
I can I can I make you feel really fine  
We could we could we make love this time  
We could we could we make love so fine  
Youre old enough to know from where we  
Come and where we go  
  
And what were here for  
What do you fear for  
Its hard enough to hear the though in mind  
That now youre there  
And then youre gone  
Lets get in  
  
I could I could keep you company could  
I could I could keep you so happy can  
I can I can I make you feel really fine  
We could we could we make love this time  
We could we could we make love so fine  
Youre old enough to know from where we  
Come and where we go  
  
Youre never really tried let yourself be satisfied  
Now dont deny it  
Until you try it  
Youre played the game so long  
You think that life goes on and on  
You better use it  
Before you lose it
