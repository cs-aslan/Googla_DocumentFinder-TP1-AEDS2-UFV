Savoy sides presents a new saxophone sensation  
Its Parkers band with a smooth style of syncopation  
Kansas City born and growing  
You wont believe what the boys are blowing  
You got to come on man  
And take a piece of Mister Parkers band  
  
Youll be riding by bareback on your armadillo  
Youll be grooving high or relaxing at Camarillo  
Suddenly the music hits you  
Its a bird in flight that just cant quit you  
  
You got to come on man  
And take a piece of Mister Parkers band  
  
We will spend a dizzy weekend smacked into a trance  
Me and you will listen to  
A little bit of what made the preacher dance  
  
Bring your horn along and you can add to the pure confection  
And if you cant fly youll have to move in with the rhythm section  
Either way youre bound to function  
FiftySecond Streets the junction  
  
You got to come on man  
And take a piece of Mister Parkers  
Clap your hands and take a piece of Mister Parkers  
Come on man and take a piece of Mister Parkers band
