Look at me I dont know what Im doin  
ever since I looked at you  
How did I get this crazy feelin  
Could it be Im in love with you  
  
Ever since I saw you in the moonlight  
Ive had this feeling through and through  
Since that time I havent done a thing right  
Could it be Im in love with you  
  
Golly gee I dont know where Im goin  
Im tryin to make you see  
Oh boy I got to make her fall in love with me oh  
  
Night after night Im always dreamin  
Why dont you make those dreams come true  
Cant you see how much I really love you  
Why dont you learn to love me too  
  
Golly gee I dont know where Im goin

Why dont you make those dreams come true  
Cant you see how much I really love you  
Why dont you learn to love me too  
Love me too  
Love me too
