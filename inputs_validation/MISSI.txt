Welcome to a brand new day  
Welcome to a brand new day  
Welcome to a brand new day  
Welcome to a brand new day  
  
Word up this shit gon be ill  
Uhhuh uhhuh raw like sushi  
Love paper like Ricky love Lucy  
Pop collars L got heat  
Fifteen years Im thorough on the street  
Flood the rap game with product  
That bullshit video I dont know why you shot it  
The biggest L of them all Hollis to Hollywood  
and I still play the wall yalls get the balls  
motherfucker Duke fold like singles  
Bass from my joint make your clitoris tingle  
Thats my word scrams stupid ass in the club  
You buy a bitch a drink now you falling in love  
I gave yall the love game you thought I was soft  
Now you whining like a bitch over some broad you lost  
Playboy bunny got you feeling all crummy  
Yall niggas want the honey all we want is the money  
  
Chorus  
MI crooked letter crooked letter  
I nigga want to humpthat I  
MI crooked letter crooked letter  
I nigga want to humpthat I  
  
I had a bad shoobydoobie for ya  
Down in Georgetown fucking with the Hoyas  
Looking for a darkskin chocolate chick  
Bowlegged with a perm and the ass was thick  
Blacker the berry  well you know the rest  
She got the most rhythm she ride the best  
Talking midnight black nappy hair with peas in the back  
Scratch my pipe up every time I hit that oow  
She dont look Hawaiian she not Puerto Rican  
No disrespect mami but tonight L creeping  
with the darkest honey I could find  
Cant hit a lightskinned dime all the time  
Get your black ass over here you out your mind  
Ill turn Halle Berry down for you anytime  
Black queen dark and lovely sippin on my bubbly  
First you got to love yourself then you can love me  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I still love you light skin Ill pimp yall too  
When I cruise through your hood girl whatcha gon do  
I heard only pretty boys get to run wit you  
Topless in my six now is that really true  
Baby look at you your whole yellow crew  
Cute baby face but look at what you bout to do  
Sil vous plais ma cherie merci beaucoup  
When my joint up in her mouth she like You speak French too  
  
Chorus x2
