Ive been your lover for too many years  
Im through with wastin my time  
You been out runnin without any fear  
Tell me why I wanna know the reason why  
  
Its easy as it seems Cause its easy as it seems  
  
I keep on hearin your road never bends you aint committin no crime  
I hear youre sleepin with one of my friends tell me why  
I wanna know the reason why  
  
Its easy as it seems Cause its easy as it seems  
When youre walkin out on your dreams you just walk away  
  
I played your boyfriend for too many years you know its drivin me wild  
Ive seen you cryin without any tears like a child  
You wonder all the reasons why  
  
Its easy as it seems And its easy as it seems  
When youre walkin out on your dreams you just walk away  
  
If it takes forever I dont mind if it takes forever Ive got time
