Today Im not myself  
And you youre someone else  
And all these rules dont fit  
And all that starts can quit  
  
What a peculiar state were in  
What a peculiar state were in  
  
Lets play a game  
Where all of the lives we lead  
Could change  
Lets play a game  
Where nothing that we can see  
The same  
  
But well find other pieces to the puzzles  
Slippin out under the locks  
I could show you how many moves to checkmate right now  
We could take apart this life were building  
And pack it up inside a box  
All that really matters is were doing it right now  
Right now
