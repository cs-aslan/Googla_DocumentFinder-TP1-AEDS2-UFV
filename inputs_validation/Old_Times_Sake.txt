If this is our last dance  
Lets take it slowowly  
Lets let our hearts break  
Just for old times sake  
For old times sake  
  
I dont want to be the one  
To say the night is over  
I dont want to be the one  
To say goodbye  
Lets face the music  
Theres no turning back  
Just take my hand  
  
If this is our laaaast dance  
Lets take it slowowly  
Lets let our hearts break  
Just for old times sake  
For old times sake  
  
Baby let me waltz away  
The memories of hard times  
Let me wipe away  
The tears from your eyes  
Can we be tender  
Just one more time  
We have tonight  
  
If this is our laaaast dance  
Lets take it slowowly  
Lets let our hearts break  
Just for old times sake  
For old times sake  
  
For old times sake For old times sake  
Let me walk you home to your door  
For old times sake For old times sake  
Lets have one more night together  
For old times sake For old times sake  
Let me waltz you around across the floor  
For old times sake For old times sake
