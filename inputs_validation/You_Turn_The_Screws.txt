ou turn the screws  
You tear down the bridge  
Flimsy as it is  
Its business like  
You shake my hand  
You break up the band  
Flimsy as it is  
Its open mike  
punk rock  
Red white and blue  
You twist the knife  
Then go home to kiss your wife  
A bigger better slice  
is what youd like  
You kick the sand  
You get the upper hand  
You sell it to Japan  
Its natural  
Punk rock  
Red white and blue  
  
You turn the screws  
Its what you choose to do  
You think that I  
Must turn them too  
You think that I  
Must be so satisfied  
I stay inside  
I wonder why  
  
And the cement mixer gets it all ready  
One good turn at a time  
Then pouring it slowly and steady  
Youre showing me where I can sign  
What I can expect to find  
But how you can you say youll be happy  
When you turn the screws  
  
You turn the screws  
Its what you choose to do  
You think that I  
Must turn them too  
You think that I  
Must be so satisfied  
I stay inside  
I wonder why  
  
You turn the screws  
Its what you choose to do  
You think that I  
Must turn them too  
You think that I  
Must be so satisfied  
I stay inside  
I wonder why
