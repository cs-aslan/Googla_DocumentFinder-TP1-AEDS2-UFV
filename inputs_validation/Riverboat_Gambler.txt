Riverboat gambler  
Drinking alone on the prow  
Chasing your Bourbon with Tennessee gin  
The big games about to begin  
  
Riverboat gambler  
Hiding that Ave up your sleeve  
I can see through all that debonaire style  
The irony bending your smile  
  
And I wont tip your hand  
I wont do you in  
I want to stay near you  
I want you to win  
  
Riverboat gambler  
You can defy all the odds  
You can draw diamonds to fill out your flush  
You can find someone to trust  
  
And I wont steal your chips  
I wont steal your pride  
Wont you take me on faith  
Wont you let me inside  
  
Riverboat gambler  
Under our velvet and lace  
Youre an old vagabond Im a poor waif  
Lets make a place thats safe  
  
Riverboat gambler  
Come on and let me inside
