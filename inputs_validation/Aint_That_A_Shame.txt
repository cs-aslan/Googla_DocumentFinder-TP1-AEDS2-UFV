You made me cry when you said goodbye  
Aint that a shame  
My tears fell like rain  
Aint that a shame Youre the one to blame  
  
Oh well goodbye although Im crying  
Aint that a shame

But aint that a shame  
Oh my tears fell like rain  
Aint that a shame Youre the one to blame yeah  
  
Oh well goodbye although Im crying  
Aint that a shame  
Oh my tears fell like rain  
Aint that a shame Youre the one to blame  
Aint that a shame  
  
Oh well good goodbye although Im gonna cry  
Aint that a shame
