Shes a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer  
  
Nother day nother night  
And she acting like she dont sleep  
Shes a five when she drinks  
But shes a ten when shes on top of him  
  
She dont want love she just wanna touch  
Shes a greedy girl to never get enough  
She dont wanna love she just wanna touch  
Shes got all the moves that make you get it up  
  
Shes a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer

She can win with her eyes closed  
Its insane how she tames  
She can turn you to an animal  
  
She dont want love she just wanna touch

She dont wanna love she just wanna touch  
Shes got all the moves that make you give it up
