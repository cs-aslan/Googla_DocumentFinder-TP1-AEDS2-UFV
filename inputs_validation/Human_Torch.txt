Turned round 6 oclock and Im still sleepin  
I dont have to work on Saturday  
But I do anyway  
Round the corner right on up to the shop  
I come creeping but it dont matter anyway  
  
Cause I know its just as well  
And even so I feel like hell  
You can say that its alright  
But I am wrapped up tight  
And I can see the forest through the trees  
I am on my knees  
I dont know if I am supposed to stay  
Or Im supposed to leave it all behind  
  
The door the world outside still spins  
Waiting there behind the door but I wont let it in  
Not today not tomorrow not next week  
Youre just gonna have to pay five bucks to see the geek  
  
Cause I know its just as well  
And even so I feel like hell  
You can say that its alright  
But I am wrapped up tight  
And I can see the forest through the trees  
I am on my knees  
I dont know if I am supposed to stay  
Or Im supposed to leave it all behind  
  
Please pay your attention high above the center ring  
Up in the rafters 500 feet above the crowd  
My hair is soaked in kerosene  
My clothes are wet with gasoline  
You only get to see this once  
The human torch is going down  
Going down going down going down
