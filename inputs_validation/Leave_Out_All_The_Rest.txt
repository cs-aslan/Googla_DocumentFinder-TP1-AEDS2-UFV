I dreamed I was missing  
You were so scared  
But no one would listen  
Cause no one else cared  
After my dreaming  
I woke with this fear  
What am I leaving  
When Im done here  
So if youre asking me I want you to know  
  
Chorus  
When my time comes  
Forget the wrong that Ive done  
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed  
And dont resent me  
And when youre feeling empty  
Keep me in your memory  
Leave out all the rest  
Leave out all the rest  
  
Dont be afraid  
Ive taken my beating  
Ive shed but Im me  
Im strong on the surface  
Not all the way through  
Ive never been perfect  
But neither have you  
So if youre asking me I want you to know  
  
Chorus  
  
Forgetting  
All the hurt inside youve learned to hide so well  
Pretending  
Someone else can come and save me from myself  
I cant be who you are  
  
Chorus  
  
Forgetting  
All the hurt inside youve learned to hide so well  
Pretending  
Someone else can come and save me from myself  
I cant be who you are  
I cant be who you are
