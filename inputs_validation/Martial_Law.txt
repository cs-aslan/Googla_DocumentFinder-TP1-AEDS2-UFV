Ive declared a truce so stop your fighting  
The marshall is in town  
I wont put up with no big mouth yapping  
At least not while Im around  
This is my friend Ace hes from the 8th precinct  
Nothing goes on that he dont know  
And weve been send cause your arguments  
Have been going on for too long  
And before one of you hurts the other one of you  
Im declaring martial law  
  
I came I saw I declared martial law  
Im the marshall in the city  
The jails are filled with people like you  
You oughta listen to your diddywahdiddy  
Whats a girl like you doing with that lamp  
You better drop it down on the floor  
And son that isnt very smart kicking a hole in that door  
Hey Ace will you take a look at this place  
And get those neighbors out of the hall  
Im declaring martial law  
  
I came I saw I declared martial law  
Im the marshall of the city  
And if you stand away Ive got something to say  
That might even help you  
  
Keep your hands to yourself and keep your big mouth shut  
Dont touch nobody with hate  
And if all youve got is poison in your mouth  
Make sure that you dont speak  
Its 330 in the early morning  
Dont punch dont scratch dont bite  
Try not to take the garbage of the day  
Any place but outside  
  
Now me and Mr Ace are gonna leave this place  
And this fightings gonna end  
And if were called back Im gonna knock you flat  
And stack you end to end  
  
I came I saw I declared martial law  
Im the marshall in the city
