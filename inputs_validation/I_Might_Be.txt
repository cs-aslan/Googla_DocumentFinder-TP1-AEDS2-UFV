Verse 1  
East Atlanta slum man is where I come from  
Pass that bubble thrax and put this bean on your tongue  
Now everything was gravy til your bitch came in  
Bout the same time that that thang kicked in  
Now she aint really pretty but she got a nice body  
Im geeked up thinkin this Buffie The Body  
Aint your name lil Trina cause you look like Janet Jackson  
Im off three double stacks and Im lookin for that action  
Gucci Mane you stupid man I love the way you flowin  
Ridin in my drop but I dont know where Im goin  
On two eighty five I keep ridin in a circle  
The inside of my ride smellin like a pound of purple  
Gucci is your time give me five more minutes  
And a cold orange juice cause Im really really trippin  
Went to the strip club and request that Im da man  
The next thing you know I was throwin rubberbands  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2

But I wish I had a lie detector test right now  
You say you marry well bitch you might be  
But I bet your husband aint Icy like me
