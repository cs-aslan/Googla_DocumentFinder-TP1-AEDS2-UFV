I look in  
your eyes and I can see  
Weve loved so dangerously  
Youre not trusting your heart to anyone  
You tell me youre gonna play it smart  
Were through before we start  
But I believe that weve only just begun  
  
When its this good theres no saying no  
I want you so Im ready to go  
  
Chorus  
Through the fire  
To the limit to the wall  
For a chance to be with you  
Id gladly risk it all  
Through the fire  
Through whatever come what may  
For a chance at loving you  
Id take it all the way  
Right down to the wire  
Even through the fire  
  
I know youre afraid of what you feel  
You still need time to heal  
And I can help if youll only let me try  
You touch me and something in me knew  
What I could have with you  
Well Im not ready to kiss that dream goodbye  
  
When its this sweet theres no saying no  
I need you so Im ready to go  
  
Chorus  
  
Through the test of time  
  
Chorus  
  
Through the fire to the limit  
Through the fire through whatever  
Through the fire to the limit  
Through the fire through whatever
