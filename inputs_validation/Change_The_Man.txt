Dont talk to me about ban the bomb  
Dont talk to me about whos side Im on  
Replace the system with one just the same  
Dont you know that we are all to blame  
Its so easy as an armchair blamer  
Get off your seat and make a personal change sir  
Cant change the system by smashing it down  
Inside route personal revolution  
Chorus  
Change the man  
Rip out the root  
Lets get rid of this insanity  
When the mothers had told the kids straight  
When the fathers felt no more hate  
When a man can walk down the street without fear  
Then thing must change and its not too late
