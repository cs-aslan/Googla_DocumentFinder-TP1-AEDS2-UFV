One girl was called Jean Marie  
Another little girl was Felicity  
Another little girl was Sally Joy  
The other was me and Im a boy  
  
My name is Bill and Im a head case  
They practice making up on my face  
Yeah I feel lucky if I get trousers to wear  
Spend evenings taking hairpins from my hair  
  
Im a boy Im a boy  
But my ma wont admit it  
Im a boy Im a boy  
But if I say I am I get it  
  
Put your frock on Jean Marie  
Plait your hair Felicity  
Paint your nails little Sally Joy  
Put on this wig little boy  
  
Im a boy Im a boy  
But my ma wont admit it  
Im a boy Im a boy  
But if I say I am I get it  
  
Want to play cricket on the green  
Ride my bike across the street  
Cut myself and see my blood  
Want to come home all covered in mud  
  
Im a boy Im a boy  
But my ma wont admit it  
Im a boy Im a boy  
But if I say I am I get it
