Im nobodys baby  
I wonder why  
Each night and day I pray the Lord up above  
Please send me down somebody to love  
  
But nobody wants me  
Im blue somehow  
Wont someone hear my plea and take a chance with me  
Because Im nobodys baby now  
  
Nobodys baby  
And Ive got to know the reason why  
Last week I was walking down the street and met a boy and I said  
Hey Maybe I was meant for you  
But he only shook his head and said Goodbye  
He kept on walking down the avenue  
  
Nobody wants me  
Im mighty blue somehow  
Wont someone hear my plea and take a chance with me  
Because Im nobodys baby now
