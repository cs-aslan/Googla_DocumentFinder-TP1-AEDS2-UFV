You came to me I was alone  
Tried to drag me in to your danger zone  
You told me things got right inside  
And showed me things Id never tried  
You got a hold you wouldnt let go  
You lied and lied and lied  
It was a great big show  
Everything about us looks wrong but I swear it feels right  
people talk people talk I hear them do it  
they think think they knowthey think they know when I never knew it  
youre a gigolo youre gigolo Ive heard it said  
Ive got a sweet nameIve got a sweet name for you instead  
They imagine what must give them a thrill  
Theyll never know for sure but I will  
Everything about us looks wrong but I swear it feels right  
Everything about us looks wrong but I swear it feels right  
Whispering is rude in public places  
its so obviousits so obvious written on their faces  
They think your taking me for a great big ride  
But you know whats more theyre probably right Im hoping on with you
tonight  
You take me up and let me down  
Dont like my friends to come around  
if your not center if your not center of the stage  
You sulk and rant and go into a rage  
Ohohoh but I can leave at any time  
But Id miss the oh so absurd and so sublime  
Everything about us looks wrong but I swear it feels right  
Everything about us looks wrong but I swear it feels right  
Everything about us looks wrong but I swear it feels right
