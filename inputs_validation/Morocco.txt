The astral map thats overhead  
Watch it while it is unfolding  
  
The fabric of the universe  
Out of which this earth is woven  
The moon is a mirror alike  
She returns my loving  
  
Wheels are turning before my eyes  
Reels of film are running by  
I can see miles passing  
  
The astral map thats overhead  
Watch it while it is unfolding  
  
Maybe it wont be that far  
It wont be long before were getting  
To enjoy this setting  
  
Were getting closer to where were heading  
Weve been chosen  
To enjoy this setting  
  
That astral map thats overhead  
Watch it while it is unfolding  
  
Wheels are turning before my eyes  
Reels of film are running by  
I can see miles passing  
  
Into fata morganas I melt  
Onto the buckle of orions belt
