Were living in the land of makebelieve  
And trying not to let it show  
Maybe in that land of makebelieve  
Heartaches can turn into joy  
Were breathing in the smoke of high and low  
Were taking up a lot of room  
Somewhere in the dark and silent night  
Our prayer will be heard make it soon  
So fly little bird  
Up into the clear blue sky  
And carry the word  
Loves the only reason why why  
OPen up the shutters on your windows  
Unlock all the locks upon your doors  
Brush away the cobwebs from your daydreams  
No secrets come between us any more  
Oh say its true  
Only love will see you through  
You know what love can do to you  
Were living in a land of makebelieve  
And trying not to let it show  
Maybe in that land of makebelieve  
Heartaches can turn into joy  
Were breathing in the smoke of high and low  
Were taking up a lot of room  
Somewhere in the dark and lonely night  
Our prayer will be heard make it soon  
So fly little bird  
Up into the clear blue sky  
And carry the word  
Loves the only reason why why  
Open up the shutters on your windows  
Unlock all the locks upon your doors  
Brush away the cobwebs from your daydreams  
No secrets come between us any more  
Oh say its true  
Only love will see you through  
You know what love can do to you
