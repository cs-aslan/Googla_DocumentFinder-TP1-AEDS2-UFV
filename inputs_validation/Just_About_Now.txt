Just about now  
Id be watching you wake up  
Feeling my heart beat with yours  
Just about now  
  
Is when we would make love  
Like all of the mornings before  
But I know it dont help  
To turn the clock back  
  
Cause Im not gonna make it  
Til I face this fact  
  
This is not about trying  
To go back in time  
This is not about where  
Ill be a year down the line  
  
Its just moment to moment  
Surviving somehow  
This is not about then  
This is just about now  
  
Just about now  
Youd pull in the driveway  
And Id be there waving hello  
Run to my arms  
  
Youd kiss me and hold me  
As if youd never let go  
And its just about now  
When the tears start to fall  
  
I wonder if Im gonna make it at all  
  
This is not about trying  
To go back in time  
This is not about where  
Ill be a year down the line  
  
Its just moment to moment  
Surviving somehow  
This is not about then  
This is just about now  
  
Its just moment to moment  
Surviving somehow  
This is not about then  
This is just about now
