Last night while we were talking the way that old friends do  
I suddenly got lost in my yesterdays with you  
I told you that in my heart you would always be the one  
That Id lie waking in the dark pray that you will come  
But I didnt mean to say that  
Somehow it just slipped out  
I swear that I would take it back  
If I could right now  
All I ask is you believe  
Id forgotten where I was  
With you there so close to me  
I thought that we were still in love  
Oh I knew just what Id done when you stood up so fast  
And say the friends that wed become cant hold on to the past  
You said its been a long long time since love came to an end  
If I hadnt learned to draw the line its useless to pretend  
But I didnt mean to say that  
Somehow it just slipped out  
I swear that I would take it back  
If I could right now  
All I ask is you believe  
Id forgotten where I was  
With you there so close to me  
I thought that we were still in love  
I dont think I could take goodbye that much is still the truth  
Wont you forgive me just for one night its what a friend would do  
Coz I didnt mean to say that  
Somehow it just slipped out  
I swear that I would take it back  
If I could right now  
All I ask is you believe  
Id forgotten where I was  
With you there so close to me  
I thought that we were still in love  
Still in love  
I thought that we were still in love
