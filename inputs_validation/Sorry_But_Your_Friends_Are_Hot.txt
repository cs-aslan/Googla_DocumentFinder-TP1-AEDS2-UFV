Go go go go  
  
You are my one and only  
But one can seem so fucking lonely  
Shut up shut up hear me out  
I got a bad habit I cant live without  
  
Something wicked this way comes  
Infidelity infidelity  
Its only sex Im just having fun  
Im the king of unaccountability  
  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder  
I had a guilty heart right from the start  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder  
Its ripping me apart  
  
My hands are tied  
With this feeling comes no conscience do or die  
Im content in misery dont even try  
Understanding all this pain or reason  
Why I dont know maybe youre to blame  
Go go go  
  
Yes you are so blind its easy  
Do anything just to try to please me  
Shut up shut up listen to what I say  
Time is running out you should bail today  
  
Something wicked this way comes  
Guilt inside of me guilt inside of me  
The king of pain Im his only son  
Ill make you wish you never put your trust in me  
  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder  
A guilty heart right from the start  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder  
Its ripping me apart  
  
My hands are tied  
With this feeling comes no conscience do or die  
Im content in misery dont even try  
Understanding all this pain or reason  
Why I dont know maybe youre to blame  
  
Wake up this is never gonna end  
Wait up youre one in ten  
Ill break up your will within and straight up  
Do it all again  
  
If you wait up all night Ill be burning daylight  
Me and my libido are in on the take right  
Break what I want leave you by the wayside  
Promise Ill stop you can trust what I say psyche  
When Im on top youll be droppin down the scale like  
  
My hands are tied  
With this feeling comes no conscience do or die  
Im content in misery dont even try  
Understanding all this pain or reason  
Why I dont know maybe youre to blame  
Go go go  
  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder  
I was born with a devil on my shoulder
