I saw a cat with a machine in his brain  
The man who fed him said  
He didnt feel any pain  
Id like to see that man take out that machine  
And stick it in his own brain  
You know what I mean  
  
I saw a rabbit with its eyes full of tears  
The lab that owned her had  
Been doing it for years  
Why dont we make them pay for every last eye  
That couldnt cry its own tears  
Do you know what I mean  
  
When I tell you that well all be  
Looking for changes  
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures  
And we will learn how to grow  
  
Well I tell you that well all be  
Looking for changes  
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures  
And we will learn how to grow  
When were looking for changes  
  
I saw a monkey that was learning to choke  
A guy beside him gave him cigarettes to smoke  
And every time that monkey started to cough  
The bastard laughed his head off  
Do you know what I mean  
  
When I tell you that well all be  
Looking for changes  
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures  
  
And we will learn how to grow  
  
When were looking for changes  
Were looking for changes  
Were looking for changes  
Were looking for changes in the way we are und  
Yeah yeah off the ground
