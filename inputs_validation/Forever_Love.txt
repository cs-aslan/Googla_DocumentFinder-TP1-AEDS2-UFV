The first time I laid my eyes on you I knew  
Wed spend this life side by side  
I still feel the same though youre so far away  
I swear that youll always be my  
  
Forever love  
I promise you  
Someday well be together  
Forever love  
I wont give up  
No matter what  
Ill be waiting for you  
Forever love  
  
Minutes and hours and years may go by  
But my heart knows nothing of time  
So dont cry just keep me right here in your dreams  
And hold on to these words of mine  
  
Forever love  
I promise you  
Someday well be together  
Forever love  
I wont give up  
No matter what  
Ill be waiting for you  
Forever love  
  
Love is the road to our destiny  
Nothing can change what is meant to be  
Forever love  
  
Oh I wont give up  
No matter what  
Ill be waiting for you  
Forever love  
Forever love  
Forever love
