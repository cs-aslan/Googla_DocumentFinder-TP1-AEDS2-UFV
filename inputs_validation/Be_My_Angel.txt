They say its me  
That makes you do things  
You might not have done  
If I was away  
And thats its me  
That likes to talk to you  
And watches you  
As you walk away  
Dont say its useless  
Dont say forget it  
Dont bring me wishes  
Of silly dreams  
Just say its all  
From too much freedom  
Too many fingers  
And to anything  
They say its you  
That washes the weary  
And brings the night into the day  
If you wont notice  
How can I show you  
All of you worries  
Have all gone away  
Dont leave me lonely  
Dont leave me unhappy  
Just bring me up into your fate  
If you dont need me  
Then dont deceive me  
Letting my freedom turn into stone  
Just be my angel  
If you love me  
Be my angel  
In the night  
Be my angel  
Cause you need me  
Be my angel  
And treat me right  
Dont say you love me  
If you dont need me  
Dont send me roses  
On your behalf  
Just take me down  
And walk through your river  
Down the middle  
And make it last  
Holding on to you  
Holding on to me  
Holding on tight  
Till my love is crossed  
Dont say its useless  
And dont say forget it  
You are my spirit  
Now you are gone
