Shes got a suitcase packed in the trunk trunk trunk  
Shes got a see you later song that went bump bump bump  
Shes got a hurtin heavy heart goin thump thump thump  
Shes leaving  
Shes got a bucket of tears goin drop drip drop  
And that ring on her finger is comin off off off  
Shes got a boyfriend yelling to stop stop stop  
Shes leaving  
  
Should have done this should have done that  
Should have seen it comin guess you dont see nothing when youre runnin
round  
Shes history wrapped in a memory  
Tied up tight with a broken heart strings of the things that will never be  
Shes leaving shes leaving now  
  
She left your dreams in the washing machine chine chine  
Now shes a red light turning to green green green  
Shes a goner if you know what I mean mean mean  
Shes leaving  
  
Should have done this should have done that  
Should have seen it comin guess you dont see nothing when youre runnin
round  
Shes history wrapped in a memory  
Tied up tight with a broken heart strings of the things thatll never be  
Shes leaving  
Oh no shes leaving  
  
Look at her go down right over your road  
Sayin to herself shoulda done this a long time ago  
  
Should have done this should have done that  
Should have seen it comin guess you dont see nothing when youre runnin
round  
Shes history wrapped in a memory  
Tied up tight with a broken heart strings of the things that will never be  
Shes shes shes leaving  
Shes leaving  
  
Shes got a suitcase packed in the trunk trunk trunk  
Shes got a see you later song that went bump bump bump  
Shes got a hurtin heavy heart that went thump thump thump  
Shes leaving Shes leaving  
Shes got a bucket of tears goin drop drip drop  
And that ring on her finger is comin off off off  
Shes got a boyfriend yelling to stop stop stop  
Shes leaving  
Shes leaving man  
  
Look at her go down right over your road  
Shes leaving shes leaving leaving
