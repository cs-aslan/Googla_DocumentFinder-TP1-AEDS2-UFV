Miles from nowhere  
I guess Ill take my time  
Oh yeah to reach there  
  
Look up at the mountain  
I have to climb  
Oh yeah to reach there  
  
Lord my body has been a good friend  
But I wont need it when I reach the end  
  
Miles from nowhere  
I guess Ill take my time  
Oh yeah to reach there  
  
I creep through the valleys  
And I grope through the woods  
Cause I know when I find it my honey  
Its gonna make me feel good yes  
  
I love everything  
So dont it make you feel sad  
Cause Ill drink to you my baby  
Ill think to that Ill think to that  
  
Miles from nowhere  
Not a soul in sight  
Oh yeah but its alright  
  
I have my freedom  
I can make my own rules  
Oh yes the ones that I choose  
  
Lord my body has been a good friend  
But I wont need it when I reach the end  
  
I love everything  
So dont it make you feel sad  
Cause Ill drink to you my baby  
Ill think to that Ill think to that  
Oh yeah  
  
Miles from nowhere  
Guess Ill take my time  
Oh yeah to reach there
