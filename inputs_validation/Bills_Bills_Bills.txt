At first we started out real cool  
Taking me places I aint never been  
But now youre getting comfortable  
Aint doing those things you did no more  
Youre slowly making me pay for things  
Your money should be handling  
  
And now you ask to use my car  
Drive it all day and dont fill up the tank  
And you have the audacity  
To even come and step to me  
Ask to hold some money from me  
Until you get your check next week  
  
You triflin good for nothing type of brother  
Silly me why havent I found another  
A baller when times get hard  
I need someone to help me out  
Instead of a scrub like you  
Who dont know what a mans about  
  
Can you pay my bills  
Can you pay my telephone bills  
Do you pay my automo bills  
If you did then maybe we could chill  
I dont think you do  
So you and me are through  
  
Can you pay my bills  
Can you pay my telephone bills  
Do you pay my automo bills  
If you did then maybe we could chill  
I dont think you do  
So you and me are through  
  
Now youve been maxing out my card  
Gave me bad credit buyin me gifts with my own ends  
Havent paid the first bill  
But instead youre headin to the mall  
Goin on shopping sprees  
Perpetrating to your friends like you be ballin  
  
And then you use my cell phone  
Callin whoever that you thinks at home  
And then when the bill comes  
All of a sudden you be acting dumb  
Dont know where none of these calls come from  
When your mommas numbers here more than once  
  
You triflin good for nothing type of brother  
Silly me why havent I found another  
A baller when times get hard  
I need someone to help me out  
Instead of a scrub like you  
Who dont know what a mans about  
  
Can you pay my bills  
Can you pay my telephone bills  
Do you pay my automo bills  
If you did then maybe we could chill  
I dont think you do do do  
So you and me are through through through  
  
Can you pay my bills  
Can you pay my telephone bills  
Do you pay my automo bills  
If you did then maybe we could chill  
I dont think you do  
So you and me are through  
  
You triflin good for nothing type of brother  
Oh silly me why havent I found another  
You triflin good for nothing type of brother  
Oh silly me why havent I found another
