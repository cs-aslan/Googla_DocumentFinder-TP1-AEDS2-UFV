I used to love the tenderloin  
Until I made some tender coin  
And then I met some ladies from Marin  
We took the highway to the one  
Up the coast to catch some sun  
That left me with these blisters on my skin  
Dont know what I was on  
But I think it grows in Oregon  
So I kept on goin going on right through  
I drove into Seattle rain  
Fell in love then missed the train  
That could have took me right back home to you  
  
Chorus  
Ive been high Ive been low  
Ive been yes and Ive been oh hell no  
Ive been rock n roll and disco  
Wont you save me San Francisco  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Every day so caffeinated  
I wish they were golden gated  
Fillmore couldnt feel more miles away  
So wrap me up return to sender  
Lets forget this five day bender  
Take me to my city by the bay  
  
I never knew all that I had  
Now Alcatraz dont sound so bad  
At least they have a hella fine merlot  
If I could wish upon a star  
I would hitch a cable car  
To the place that I can always call my own  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive been up Ive been down  
Ive been so damn lost since youre not around  
I been reggae and calypso  
Wont you save me San Francisco  
  
To tell you the truth  
I miss everything everything  
Its a wild wild beautiful world  
But theres a wide eyed girl back there  
And she means everything everything  
  
Ive been stop Ive been go  
Ive been yes and Ive been oh hell no  
Ive been rock and roll and disco  
Wont you save me San Francisco  
  
Ive been up Ive been down  
Ive been so damn lost  
Since youre not around  
Ive been reggae and calypso  
Wont you save me San Francisco  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Save me San Francisco  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh  
Wont you save me San Francisco  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Save me San Francisco  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh  
Wont you save me San Francisco
