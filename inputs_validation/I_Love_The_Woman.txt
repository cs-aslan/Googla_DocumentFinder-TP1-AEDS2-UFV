I love the woman an learned a lesson that I cant forget  
Yes I love the woman an learned a lesson that I cant forget  
Yes shes mean an shes evil and now my life is in a solid mess  
Yeah  
She wakes me in the mornin  
Right before the break of day  
Tellin me to get up and go out  
I had a earn myself some pay  
How she scolds me like an orphan  
And treats me like a clown  
And when I need some lovin  
That woman cant be found  
And I love the woman  
And learned a lesson that I cant forget  
Yes shes mean an shes evil  
And now my life is in a solid mess
