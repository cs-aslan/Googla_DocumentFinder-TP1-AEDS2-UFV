  
Theres a flame flame in my heart  
And theres no rain can put it out  
And theres a flame its burning in my heart  
And theres no rain ooh can put it out  
So just hold me hold me hold me  
  
Take away the pain inside my soul  
And Im afraid so all alone  
Take away the pain thats burning in my soul  
Cause Im afraid that Ill be all alone  
So just hold me hold me hold me  
  
Hold on to my heart to my heart to me  
Hold on to my heart to my heart to me  
And oh no dont let me go cause all I am  
You hold in your hands and hold me  
And Ill make it through the night  
And Ill be alright hold on hold on to my heart
