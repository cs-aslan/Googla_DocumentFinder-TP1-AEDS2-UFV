Chorus  
All my exs live in Texas  
And Texas is the place Id dearly love to be  
But all my exs live in Texas  
And thats why I hang my hat in Tennessee  
  
Rosannas down in Texarkana  
Wanted me to push her broom  
Sweet Eileens in Abilene  
She forgot I hung the moon  
And Allisons in Galveston  
Somehow lost her sanity  
And Dimples who now lives in Temples  
Got the law looking for me  
  
Chorus  
  
I remember that old Frio River  
Where I learned to swim  
But it brings to mind another time  
Where I wore my welcome thin  
By transcendental meditation  
I go there each night  
But I always come back to myself  
Long before daylight  
  
All my exs live in Texas  
And Texas is the place Id dearly love to be  
But all my exs live in Texas  
Therefore I reside in Tennessee  
  
Some folks think Im hidin  
Its been rumored that I died  
But Im alive and well in Tennessee
