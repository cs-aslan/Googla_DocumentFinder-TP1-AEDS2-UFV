Theres a new sun  
Risin up angry in the sky  
And theres a new voice  
Sayin were not afraid to die  
Let the old world make believe  
Its blind and deaf and dumb  
But nothing can change the shape of things to come  
There are changes  
Lyin ahead in every road  
And there are new thoughts  
Ready and waiting to explode  
When tomorrow is today  
The bells may toll for some  
But nothing can change the shape of things to come  
The futures comin in now  
Sweet and strong  
Aint noone gonna hold it back for long  
There are new dreams  
Crowdin out old realities  
Theres revolution  
Sweepin in like a fresh new breeze  
Let the old world make believe  
Its blind and deaf and dumb  
But nothing can change the shape of things  
Nothing can change the shape of things  
Nothing can change the shape of things  
Nothing can change the shape of things  
To come
