Chorus  
I think I would if I could kill the emperor  
Lets stop the war and feed the poor lets kill the emperor  
Lets stop the lies the dead cant rise silence every mothers cries  
I think I would if I could kill the emperor  
  
Yo its like resident evil the emperors people dont give a mad fuck about
your life  
Theyll fuck your wife and your kids  
Theyve got people doing bids for being slaves to the dope that they supplying  
Still they keep lying and tell you that its some cartel  
While they waiting on the heaven theyre creating the hell  
They rape the constitution while you wait in your cell  
And for the victors go the spoils and thats oil wells  
Call Orson Welles cause the worlds at war  
And the front line is just outside your front door  
Fuck the New York Times Fuck CNN  
And politicians that pretend to be the working mans friend  
  
Chorus  
  
Yo the emperors a liar the fields are on fire  
Oil prices get higher times about to expire  
Hurricane Katrina and Asian tsunamis  
Adolescent mommies and high school snipers  
Final days are coming get ready for trial  
Americans they live in fifty states of denial  
Have a coke and a smile or some crack in a vile  
You can even buy a pill to keep you hard for a while for these girls gone wild  
In this world at war its the same old whores its the new crusade  
Yo the plan been made they lied to invade  
Im on the palace lawn with my live grenade  
  
Chorus
