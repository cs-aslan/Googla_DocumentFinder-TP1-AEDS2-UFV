Cold Fort Worth beer just aint no good for jealous  
I tried it night after night  
Youre in someone elses arms in Dallas  
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind  
  
Darlin while youre busy burnin bridges  
Burn one for me when you get time  
Cause good memories dont fade so easy  
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind  
  
You left me here to be with him in Dallas  
And I know it hurt you at the time  
I wonder now if it makes a difference  
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind  
  
You left me here to be with him in Dallas  
And I know it hurt you at the time  
I wonder now if it makes a difference  
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind  
  
Does Fort Worth ever Repeats  
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind
