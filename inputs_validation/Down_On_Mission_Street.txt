some say that you may soon be leaving town  
do you tire of chasing all the women around  
will you never be contented with your life  
will you always be the one who wont think twice  
when you go down on your knees  
youre so hard to please  
when you go down on your knees  
youre so hard  down on mission street  
god only knows how you can hurt her  
when you know thats what you do  
how does it feel to be so cruel  
will you never be contented with your life  
will you always be the one who wont look back  
when you go down on your knees  
youre so hard to please  
when you go down on your knees  
it feels like up down on mission street  
julie said your eyes are blue  
your lips are cold as stone  
she picked you up and you put her down  
and messed her place around  
will you never be contented with your life  
will you always be the one who wont think twice  
when you go down on your knees  
youre so hard to please  
when you go down on your knees  
youre so hard  down on mission street  
when you go down on your knees  
youre so hard to please  
when you go down on your knees  
it feels like up down on mission street
