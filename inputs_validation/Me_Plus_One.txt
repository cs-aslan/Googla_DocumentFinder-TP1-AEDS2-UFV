Its time to tell my story  
of a girl I used to know  
Always cried into her pillow  
under pinups on the wall  
She didnt make Italia Conte  
didnt get that TV show  
Then a nice man said hed help her  
with a new portfolio  
  
Missus be Missus E Missus AyouT  
Missus I Missus FyouL  
Im gonna reach the top  
I aint ever gonna stop  
and Im sure gonna ring your bell  
Missus D Missus I Missus FFI  
Missus see Missus youLT  
If ever theres a girl  
that could rock your world  
Then that girl sure is me  
right  
  
Chorus  
So the fun wont start til shes living it up  
feeling good on top of the pops  
Can you make it me plus one  
Dress falls down at the aftershow  
She breaks down in the video  
Think youll find its me plus one  
  
Now this wannabe seniorita  
met a group of likely girls  
Traded posters and the voxpops  
for jetting round the world  
But it didnt make her happy  
and now she flies alone  
The wrong pictures in the paper  
and no one back at home  
  
The people around you  
wont tell you how it is  
Dont you think its gone on long enough  
Take a look at yourself  
Get out of the car  
You know its time  
youve got to let it go
