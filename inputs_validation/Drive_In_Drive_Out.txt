I hear more than I like to  
So I boil my head in a sense of humor  
I laugh at what I cannot change  
I throw it all on the pyre againgo then and do this  
Id do it for you  
When all that I want is so badly to be  
By myself again  
Its going to drive me right out of my brain  
  
Drive in drive out Im leaving  
Drive in drive out  
Ill come back again  
Drive in drive out Im leaving  
Drive in drive out  
  
I dont care if we all turn to waste  
So when I begyou avoid mebecause I smell of dirthungry  
Hungry boyyou wont leave me all alonethe boy wont go  
  
Sooner or later were done  
Sooner or later Im gone  
Because because  
Sooner or later were gone  
Sooner away  
  
Ooh my head is pounding nowgod has all but left me behind  
Not a sense of worryIm going to drive in and drive out again  
Drive in drive out Im leaving  
Drive in drive out Ill come  
Drive in drive out Im leaving  
Drive in drive out  
  
Im over this arrangement  
Around hereemptiness  
Sounded so goodI want to  
Drive you right into my world  
  
Drive in drive out Im leaving  
Drive in drive out Ill come  
Drive in drive out Im leaving  
Drive in drive out
