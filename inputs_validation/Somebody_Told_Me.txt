Breakin my back just to know your name  
Seventeen tracks and Ive had it with this game  
A breakin my back just to know your name  
But heaven aint close in a place like this  
Anything goes but dont blink you might miss  
Cause heaven aint close in a place like this  
I said heaven aint close in a place like this  
Bring it back down bring it back down tonight  
Never thought Id let a rumor ruin my moonlight  
  
Chorus  
Well somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
Its not confidential Ive got potential  
  
Ready lets roll onto something new  
Takin its toll then Im leaving without you  
Cause heaven aint close in a place like this  
I said heaven aint close in a place like this  
Bring it back down bring it back down tonight  
Never thought Id let a rumor ruin my moonlight  
  
Chorus  
  
A rushing rushing around  
  
Pace yourself for me  
I said maybe baby please  
But I just dont know now  
When all I want to do is try  
  
Chorus  
  
A rushing rushing around  
  
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
Its not confidential Ive got potential  
  
A rushing rushing around  
  
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
Its not confidential Ive got potential  
  
A rushing rushing around
