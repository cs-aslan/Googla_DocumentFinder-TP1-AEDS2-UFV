Aaah  
Did I hear you say you love me  
Well baby Ive got to know  
Cause if you really really love me  
Youve got to do things to show  
Dont give me the wrong impression  
By showing me warm expressions  
Put me in the right direction  
With tender love and affection  
Ive been standing on the outside  
Trying to get on the inside  
  
Did I hear you say you need me  
Well baby tell me the truth  
Cause if you really really need me  
My sweetness heres what Ill do  
Cut out all my crazy playing  
Cause for your love I have been laying  
Just tell me that is what youre saying  
And Ill be yours without delaying  
Ive been standing on the outside  
Trying to get on the inside  
  
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say  
I love you  
If you love me honey let me hear you say  
I love you  
Sounds so good  
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say  
I love you  
  
Did I hear you say you want me  
Now please dont give me no mess  
Cause if you really really want me  
Youve got to give me your best  
Put my love life right in the pocket  
And dare someone to try to top it  
And when you think I want to drop it  
Just love me til I beg dont stop it  
Cause Ive been standing on the outside  
Trying to get on the inside  
  
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say  
I love you  
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say
