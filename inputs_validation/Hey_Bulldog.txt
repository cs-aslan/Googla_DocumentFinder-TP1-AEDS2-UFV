Sheepdog standing in the rain  
Bullfrog doing it again  
Some kind of happiness is  
Measured out in miles  
What makes you think youre  
Something special when you smile  
  
Childlike no one understands  
Jackknife in your sweaty hands  
Some kind of innocence is  
Measured out in years  
You dont know what its like  
To listen to your fears  
  
You can talk to me  
You can talk to me  
You can talk to me  
If youre lonely you can talk to me  
  
Big man yeah walking in the park  
Wigwam frightened of the dark  
Some kind of solitude is  
Measured out in you  
You think you know me but you havent got a clue  
  
You can talk to me  
You can talk to me  
You can talk to me  
If youre lonely you can talk to me
