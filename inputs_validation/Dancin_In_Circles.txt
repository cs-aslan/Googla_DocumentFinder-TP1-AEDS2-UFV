Intro  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Lets funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown  
  
Verse 1  
I lay around touch myself to pass the time  
I fell down I wish you were mine  
I close my eyes  
Take a breath and I picture us in a place  
I cant recognize  
PreChorus  
In the fire I call your name out  
ohoohooahhahh  
Up full night tryin to rub the pain out  
ohoohooahhahh  
  
Chorus  
Im singin  
Baby dont cry  
Baby dont cry  
Dancin in circles feels good to be lonely  
Baby dont cry  
Baby dont cry  
Im singin dancin in circles feels good to be lonely  
  
PostChorus  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Lets funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown  
  
Verse 2  
I fool myself  
Swirl around as if Im someone else  
Your hands are mine  
I do a trick  
Pretend that I am you until it clicks  
I come alive  
Come alive  
  
PreChorus  
In the fire I call your name out  
call your name out call your name out  
ohoohooahhahh call your name out  
Up full night tryin to rub the pain out  
ohoohooahhahh rub the pain out  
  
Chorus

Bridge  
Hurts inside but not this time  
All the things that are on my mind  
Vanish as I touch myself  
Call out loud for you  
Oh can you hear me singin  
  
Chorus  
Baby dont cry  
Baby dont cry  
Dancin in circles feels good to be lonely  
Baby dont cry  
Baby dont cry  
Im singin  
Dancin in circles feels good to be lonely  
  
PostChorus  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Lets funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Lets funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown
