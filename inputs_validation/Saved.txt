I opened my eyes  
Barely alive without you  
Feeling no pain Im not the same without you  
  
Save me Save me  
Watching you watching  
Me from afar Im drowning Feeling as though  
Weve been here before Know what I mean  
  
Theres a river in your eyes and Im swept away  
Breaking inside out promising to stay  
Together again a lifetime stranded apart  
  
Save me Save me  
Watching you watching  
Me from afar Im reeling Feeling as though  
Weve been here before Know what I mean  
  
But your river calls to me and Im swept away  
Breaking inside out promising to stay  
Together again a lifetime stranded apart  
  
Save me Save me
