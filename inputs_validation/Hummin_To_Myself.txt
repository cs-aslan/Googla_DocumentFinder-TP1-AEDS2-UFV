Im a singer of love songs  
Songs that are happy and gay  
But how can I sing my love songs  
My lovers gone away  
  
I got the words  
I got the tune  
Ive been rehearsing under the moon  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
  
So Im hummin to myself  
Ive got the place  
Ive got the time  
Ive got a lot of love words that rhyme  
  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
So Im hummin to myself  
Mmm mmm  
I guess it just had to be  
Mmm mmm  
  
Wont someone listen to me  
I got the words and I got the tune  
Id like to croon it under the moon  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
  
So Im hummin to myself  
Well I got the words and I got the tune  
And Id like to croon it under the moon  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
  
So Im hummin to myself  
Mmm hummin to myself  
Well Im hummin to myself  
Im hummin to myself
