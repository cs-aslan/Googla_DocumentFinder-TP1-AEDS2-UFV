Have you ever been kicked to the curb  
When the party finally ends  
Just when I thought that you left me for dead  
You dust me off again  
  
Maybe you thought you could throw me away  
Like a shoe that doesnt fit  
But youve created your Frankenstein  
And now youve gotta live with it  
And here I am  
  
Thought Id turn and walk away  
Guess this aint your lucky day  
  
Too bad if you think Im leavin  
Im here to put you through hell  
Too bad if you dont believe it  
Youve done it to yourself  
Too bad if you think Im leavin  
Who cares if you hate my dog  
Maybe Ill get another  
Just to piss you off  
  
I dont mind tying up the phone  
And sleepin in real late  
Havent you noticed me fillin the fridge  
With all the foods you hate  
And here I am  
Thought Id turn and walk away  
Guess this aint your lucky day  
  
Too bad if you think Im leavin  
Im here to put you through hell  
Too bad if you dont believe it  
Youve done it to yourself  
Too bad if you think Im leavin  
Who cares if you hate my dog
