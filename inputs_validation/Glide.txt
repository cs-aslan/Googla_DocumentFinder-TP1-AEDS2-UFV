Torment the tortured teach me things  
Im so alive  
Speak to the speechless  
you have inside  
  
You can hunt for the hunter  
Hes got nowhere to hide  
You can seek with the seeker  
But hold on for the ride  
  
Keep it coming Im going all the way  
Keep it coming Im going all the way  
Just give me a half a chance  
From throwing it all away  
  
Run to the place that hides the pain  
you have inside  
Cover my chain it hides the strain  
only to glide  
  
You can hunt for the hunter  
Hes got nowhere to hide  
You can seek with the seeker  
But hold on for the ride  
  
Theres nowhere to turn nowhere to run  
You can fly with the fader fly it  
Fly it on the run  
There is nowhere to turn to nowhere  
There is nowhere to run  
You can fly with the fader fly it  
Fly it on the run  
  
Its too late time is gone  
Later on again cause no ones leaving  
  
Look away
