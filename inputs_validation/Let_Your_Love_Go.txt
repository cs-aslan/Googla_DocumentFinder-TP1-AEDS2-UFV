Theres a reason for the life that you live  
And theres pleasin that I know you can give  
And I been crayin the love you been sayin  
So baby wont you give it to me  
  
Youre tellin me no no no  
You dont want to let your love go  
Im tellin you yes yes yes  
You really oughta be gettin some happiness  
  
I made a motion and its out on the floor  
And its a notion that Id love to explore  
Cause I been tastin the love you been wastin  
So baby wont you give it to me  
  
Youre a lady  
And Im here in the palm of your hand  
Such a lady  
How much more do you think I can stand
