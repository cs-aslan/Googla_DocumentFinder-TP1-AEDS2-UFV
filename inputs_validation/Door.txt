Hes a blind man crouching by the pavement  
only seeing with his third eye  
and clutching at the astral shadow  
of every passerby  
  
Hes a wise man trumping all the answers  
shes a wild girl trying to keep his feet on the floor  
in whispered physical litanies  
Stay away from the door  
  
Oh but were all in this together he says  
threelegged race across the floor  
if only youd loosen the handkerchief  
then Id forget the door  
  
Ooh that feels so much better he says  
now you forget everything that Ive said before  
and sit there all by yourself  
while I walk through the door  
  
Theyre a blind man crouching by the pavement  
only seeing with his third eye  
and clutching at the astral shadow  
of the door of a room  
called I
