Who will be the one you run to  
Whenever its dark and cold outside  
And where will you go  
When you need a place to hide  
Baby did you know that Id loved you still  
But I wont relax until  
Youre back in my arms  
Cant you see that my love is real  
Darling anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
And you know Ill find you  
Anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
cause I must remind you  
I would sail a boat across the sea  
I would fly a plane to wherever you may be  
Think you should know  
That my love can only grow  
But if its the last thing that Ill ever do  
I swear that Ill make it back to you  
Before you leave  
Theres one thing that you must believe  
Darling anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
And you know Ill find you  
Anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
cause I must remind you  
I would sail a boat across the sea  
I would fly a plane to wherever you may be  
Think you should know  
That my love can only grow  
But if its the last thing that Ill ever do  
I swear that Ill make it back to you  
Before you leave  
Theres one thing that you must believe  
Darling anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
And you know Ill find you  
Anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
cause I must remind you  
Anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
And you know Ill find you  
Anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
cause I must remind you  
Anywhere you run to  
I will be right behind you  
And you know Ill find you
