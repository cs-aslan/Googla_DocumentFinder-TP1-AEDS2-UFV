Each day Ill do a golden deed  
By helping those who are in need  
My life on earth is but a span  
And so Ill do the best I can  
  
Refrain  
Lifes evening sun is sinking low  
A few more days and I must go  
To meet the deeds that I have done  
Where there will be no setting sun  
  
To be a child of God each day  
My light must shine along the way  
Ill sing His praise while ages roll  
And strive to help some troubled soul  
  
The only life that will endure  
Is one thats kind and good and pure  
And so for God Ill take my stand  
Each day Ill lend a helping hand  
  
Ill help someone in time of need  
And journey on with rapid speed  
Ill help the sick and poor and weak  
And words of kindness to them speak  
  
While going down lifes weary road  
Ill try to lift some travlers load  
Ill try to turn the night to day  
Make flowers bloom along the way
