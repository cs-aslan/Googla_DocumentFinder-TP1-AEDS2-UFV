And I may as well wish for the moon in hand  
  
I own this river I own this town  
All of its climbers and its winos sliding down  
But I cant own her and I never will  
No I cant own her and thats a bitter pill  
  
Taken with rain  
Til the gutter shines like the swirling sky  
Like the swirling sky  
  
Ive got all morning Ive got all year  
Its down in my pocket with the daylight folded there  
But I cant own her and I never will  
No I cant own her and thats a bitter pill  
  
Taken with rain  
How Id wash her hair like the swirling sky  
Like the swirling sky  
  
And when I say I cant own her  
I dont mean to buy her  
Its nothing at all to do with money  
I simply want her in my arms forever more  
Is that an odd request  
Is that something so funny  
  
And I may as well wish for the moon in hand  
Yes theres more chance of that coming true  
  
But I cant own her and I never will  
No I cant own her and thats a bitter pill  
  
So I cant own her Of all the things youve got the thing you want the most
is her  
And I never will And shes the one thing that you just cant have  
No I cant own her Of all the things youve got the thing you want the most
is her  
And thats a bitter pill And shes the one thing that you just cant have  
  
Taken with rain  
Which I swallow down with the swirling sky  
With the swirling sky  
  
But I cant own her  
And I may as well wish for the moon in hand  
No I cant own her  
Yes theres more chance of that coming true
