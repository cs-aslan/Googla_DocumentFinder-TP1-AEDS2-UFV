Ever since I was a little child  
I was told to do no wrong  
The angel in my mamas  
Precious eyes  
Could be a devil with a heart  
Of stone  
  
I couldnt help myself  
Just had to go my way  
Now Ive got hell to pay  
  
Chorus  
Yeah Im a twisted angel  
Flying wild and free  
Yeah Im a twisted angel  
Flying to heaven on a  
Broken wing  
  
Back when I was daddys little girl  
He brought me up on the  
Rolling Stones  
Thrown into the flame  
Thrown into the world  
Thats when I learned how  
To rock n roll  
  
Looks like everything  
Has gone my way  
But Ive still got hell to raise  
  
Chorus  
  
My mama taught me right  
But the devils up my sleeve  
Its made me kind of crazy  
But its all right with me  
  
Chorus
