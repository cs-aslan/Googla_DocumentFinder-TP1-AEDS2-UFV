When I jumped off I had a bucket full of thoughts  
When I first jumped off I held that bucket in my hand  
Ideas that would take me all around the world  
I stood and watched the smoke behind the mountain curl  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
  
Now Im gone and Ill never look back again  
Im gone and Ill never look back at all  
You know Ill never look back again  
I turn my face into the howlin wind  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
  
See my face in the town thats flashing by  
See me standing at the station in the rain  
See me running there beside the car  
I left it all behind again Ill travel far  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
  
When I jumped off I had a bucket full of thoughts  
When I first jumped off I held that bucket in my hand  
Ideas that would take me all around the world  
I stood and watched the smoke behind the mountains curl  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
It took me a long time to get back on the train
