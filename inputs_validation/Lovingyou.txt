Loving is fun when the dangers begun  
And youre makin me run again ohohoh  
When youre calling Im climbing the wall  
I know that Im only to blame  
Feels so divine when youre close to the line  
And theres reason to run again ohohoh  
Make me wait its a beautiful ache  
I know that its part of the game  
  
Ive got mud on my face  
From every thrill of the chase  
But Im fine  
My heart is heavy with dirt  
And every little bit hurts  
I dont mind  
I give as good as Itake  
And boy youre letting me break my rules  
I love the lows and the highs  
You make me twinkle inside  
And Im cool  
  
It doesnt matter what the movies say  
Oh no I like it better when you walk away  
And you can fool me with those golden eyes  
Oh yeah Were on the road to knowing satisfied  
  
Chorus  
Cos loving you dont mean Ilost my groove  
And baby breakfast in bed dont mean Ill get in the mood  
Cos loving you dont make me on your side  
You cant take the diamonds that are in my eyes  
Cos loving you dont mean Ilost my groove  
And baby breakfast in bed dont mean Ill get in the mood  
Cos loving you dont make me on your side  
You cant take the diamonds that are in my eyes  
  
So when the good times fly and its cold outside  
I wont be dancing with myself  
And if the worlds unfair and its cold out there  
I wont be dancing with myself  
So when I got no jive and its cold outside  
I wont be dancing with myself  
I let my heartbeat go cos inside I know  
I wont be dancing with myself  
  
It doesnt matter what the movies say  
Oh no I like it better when you walk away  
And you can fool me with those golden eyes  
Oh yeah Were on the road to knowing satisfied  
  
It doesnt matter what the movies say  
Oh no I like it better when you walk away  
And you can fool me with those golden eyes  
Oh yeah Were on the road to knowing satisfied  
satisfied satisfied satisfied
