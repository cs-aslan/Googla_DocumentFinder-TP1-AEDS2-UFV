I dont know what youve been through  
You might think that I dont care  
But I do  
And Ive tried to understand  
  
Ive tried to understand your abuse  
But youve got no excuse  
And theres no use in lovin  
Anyone who hates themselves  
  
You keep coming back  
So I hold you for a little while  
But I always go when I cant take your sad smile  
Cause I cant stand it when you get so intense  
  
And its all a part of our bad inheritance  
And theres no sense in lovin  
Anyone  
Wont you come back for a while  
  
You could see exactly what youve always meant to me  
But you dont want to know  
You dont want to know  
And you dont know what Ive been through  
  
And if I think that you dont care  
You probably do  
And theres no sense in lovin  
Anyone who hates themselves
