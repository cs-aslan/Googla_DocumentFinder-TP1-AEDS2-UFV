Chorus  
Aint that low down low down dirty mean  
The way youve been treatin me  
Beats all Ive ever seen  
  
I loaned you my brand new car  
Said you was goin for a Sunday drive  
Yeah here it is now four days later  
I dont know if you are dead or alive  
  
I got on the telephone this morning  
Put the word out on the street  
And I heard you was down in Memphis  
With a big man in the drivers seat  
  
Chorus  
  
Got me a hidin in the bushes  
Peekin in the window pane  
Shadow moves along the wall  
I know youre in there with another man  
  
Tried to get in the front door  
Went around to the back door too  
I believe youve got a side track man in there  
Making my sweet love to you  
  
Chorus  
  
Makin my last proclamation  
Gonna lay it on the line  
Baby Im runnin out of patience  
And you are runnin out of time  
  
Tired of all of your mean things  
And all your dirty tricks  
If I ever turn on you baby  
Youre gonna be in some kind of fix  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Yeah so low down I know low down dirty mean ah
