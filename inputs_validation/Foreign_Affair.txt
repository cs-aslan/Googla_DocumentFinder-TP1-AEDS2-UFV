A one in a million chance  
You know the moment that you crossed over the line  
A casual glance  
No one has to read between the lines  
In the south of France it was spring time  
Special feelings come alive  
Theres romance in the air so they say  
Love could be a small cafe away  
  
Love is a piece of cake  
And making love is all there is to eat  
Its a heart out of a lamb  
When you start to feel forever in a kiss  
But you must remember theres no point of refuge  
You only have a part in a lovers play  
And you could be the one left in the dark  
If someone takes a shortcut to your heart  
  
All too soon youre touching for the last time  
No one has to tell you how it is  
Its just a memory two people share  
File it under foreign affair
