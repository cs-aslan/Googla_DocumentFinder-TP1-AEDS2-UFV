I know weve reached the beginning of the end  
I know your love is growing cold for your kiss is barely warm  
Its like the quiet before the night its like the calm before the storm  
When were kissing somethings missing  
And things arent like theyve been  
I know weve reached the beginning of the end  
The beginning of the end for you and me  
I love you but Ive lost you I can see  
I dont know who Ive lost you to  
I dont know where or why or when  
I know weve reached the beginning of the end  
I know weve reached the beginning of the end
