Ive got your picture on my phone  
Your voice in my head  
Im lying here alone  
Restless in a far away bed  
The stars are falling down  
And Im half the world away  
Im just trying to close the distance  
To feel each breath that you take  
  
When the bridge is burning  
And Im losing my faith  
And Im trying to find my way towards the truth  
Like a wild arrow flying  
And Im blindly running  
From everything I thought I knew  
And every road leads home to you  
Home to you  
  
So you got me to believe  
Made me turn on a dime  
The writing on the wall  
Right in front of me  
Every song every rhyme  
  
But I dont need a thousand words  
I need you safe in my arms  
Ill be standing strong  
Ill keep holding on  
When life tries tearing us apart  
  
When the bridge is burning  
And Im losing my faith  
And Im trying to find my way towards the truth  
Like a wild arrow flying  
Now Im blindly running  
From everything I thought I knew  
  
No I aint regretting  
Just how lost Im getting  
Or the red lights Ive been blowing through  
My foot will find the pedal  
As Im counting the lines  
Every road leads home to you  
Every road leads home to you  
  
Home  
The road still leads me home to you  
Sometimes I dont see the signs  
The headlights make me blind  
The road still leads me home to you  
  
Solo  
  
When the bridge is burning  
And Im losing my faith  
And Im trying to find my way towards the truth  
Like the wild arrow flying  
Now Im blindly running from  
Everything I thought I knew  
  
No I aint regretting  
Just how lost Im getting  
Or the red lights Ive been blowing through  
My foot will find the pedal  
As Im counting the lines  
Every road leads home to you  
Every road leads home to you  
Home to you  
Home to you  
Home to you  
Every road leads home to you  
Home to you  
Every road  
Leads home to you  
  
Every road leads home to you
