Well you and I  
Were buddies  
And weve been since we first met  
Me any you  
Well weve sure been through  
Our share of laughter and regret  
Lord knows weve had our bad days  
And more than once weve disagreed  
But youve always been a friend to me  
You can be so stubborn  
Theres times I think you just like to fight  
And I hope and pray  
I live to see a day  
When you say I might be right  
And theres times Id rather kill you  
Than listen to your honesty  
But youve always been a friend to me  
Youve always been  
Time and again  
The one to take my hand  
And show to me its okay to be  
Just the way I am  
With no apology  
Oh youve always been  
And you will till God knows when  
Yes youve always been a friend to me
