Stopped awhile this morning on my way back home  
I had to realize this time that Id be all alone  
Cause she is moving somewhere far away not slow  
And though I tried so hard to please her  
She said she really had to go  
  
Even though this time it really hurts me bad  
Ive been through similarities its not the first break Ive had  
And I just cant let it bring me down so low  
And though I tried so hard to please her  
There must be something more to know  
  
Never thought that we would find our end this way  
It seemed that everything was going fine  
Still with all the things that I can do or say  
It wont change the fate I know so well is mine  
  
So Ill stop and look right past the pain  
Because Ive been in love before and I can love again  
While shes moving somewhere far away not slow  
I know I tried so hard to please her  
She said she really had to go
