Dont damn me  
When I speak a piece of my mind  
Cause silence isnt golden  
When Im holding it inside  
Cause Ive been where I have been  
An Ive seen what I have seen  
I put the pen to the paper  
Cause its all a part of me  
  
Be it a song or a casual conversation  
To hold my tongue speaks  
Of quiet reservations  
Your words once heard  
They can place you in a faction  
My words may disturb  
But at least theres a reaction  
  
Sometimes I want to kill  
Sometimes I want to die  
Sometimes I want to destroy  
Sometimes I want to cry  
Sometimes I could get even  
Sometimes I could give up  
Sometimes I could give  
Sometimes I never give a fuck  
  
Its only for a while  
I hope you understand  
I never wanted this to happen  
Didnt want to be a man  
So I hid inside my world  
I took what I could find  
I cried when I was lonely  
I fell down when I was blind  
  
But dont damn me when I speak  
A piece of my mind  
Cause silence isnt golden  
When Im holding it inside  
Cause Ive been where I have been  
An Ive seen what I have seen  
I put the pen to the paper  
Cause its all a part of me  
  
How can I ever satisfy you  
An how can I ever make you see  
That deep inside were all somebody  
An it dont matter who you want to be  
But now I gotta smile I hope you comprehend  
For this man can say it happened  
Cause this child has been condemned  
So I stepped into your world  
I kicked you in the mind  
An Im the only witness  
To the nature of my crime  
  
But look at what weve done  
To the innocent and young  
Whoa listen to whos talking  
Cause were not the only ones  
The trash collected by the eyes  
And dumped into the brain  
Said it tears into our conscious thoughts  
You tell me whos to blame  
  
I know you dont want to hear me crying  
An I know you dont want to hear me deny  
That your satisfaction lies in your illusions  
But your delusions are yours an not mine  
We take for granted that we know the whole story  
We judge a book by its cover  
And read what we want  
Between selected lines  
  
Dont hail me  
An dont idolize the ink  
Or Ive failed in my attentions  
Can you find the missing link  
Your only validation is in living your own life  
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time  
So I send this song to the offended  
I said what I meant and Ive never pretended  
As so many others do intending just to please  
If I damned your point of view  
Could you turn the other cheek  
  
Dont damn me when I speak a piece a mind  
Cause silence isnt golden  
When Im holding it inside  
Ive been where I have been  
An Ive seen what I have seen  
Put the pen to the paper  
Cause its all a part of me  
Dont damn me  
I said dont damn me  
I said dont hail me  
Ah dont damn me
