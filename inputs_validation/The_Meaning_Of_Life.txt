On the way  
Trying to get where Id like to say  
Im always feeling steered away  
By someone trying to tell me  
  
What to say and do  
I dont want it  
I gotta go find my own way  
I gotta go make my own mistakes  
  
Sorry man for feeling  
Feeling the way I do  
On yeah Oh yeah  
Open wide and theyll shove in  
  
Their meaning of life  
Oh yeah Oh yeah  
But not for me Ill do it on my own  
Oh yeah Oh yeah  
  
Open wide and swallow their meaning of life  
I cant make it work your way  
Thanks but no thanks  
By the way  
  
I know your path has been tried and so  
It may seem like the way to go  
Me Id rather be found  
Trying something new  
  
And the bottom line  
In all of this seems to say  
Theres no right and wrong way  
Sorry if I dont feel like  
  
Living the way you do
