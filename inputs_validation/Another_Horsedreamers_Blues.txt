Margerys dreaming of the middle of the day  
Tiyuri to win  
Perfect Dozen to place  
money is the matter thats been on her mind  
time ticks by her one race at a time  
  
Shes tryin to be a good girl  
And give em what they want  
But Margerys dreaming of horses  
  
Lookin at a green sky  
Sun like a red eye  
Bright blue horses are the fortune she lives by  
Shes tired and lonely  
Scared and depressed  
Her visions of one day go racing the next  
  
Shes trying to be a good girl  
And give em what they want  
But Margerys dreaming of horses  
  
Margie doesnt say anything all the way home  
So afraid shell awake to find shes all alone  
  
Margerys wingspans all feathers and coke cans and  
TV dinners and letters she wont send and  
Every race night is shot through with sunlight  
Trying to hit the big one one last time tonight for  
  
Drunken fathers and stupid mothers and  
Boys who cant tell one girl from another  
So she takes her pills  
Careful and round  
One of these days shes gonna throw the whole bottle down  
  
But shes trying to be a good girl  
And give em what they want  
But Margerys dreaming of  
  
Trying to be a good girl  
And give em what they want  
But Margerys dreaming of horses
