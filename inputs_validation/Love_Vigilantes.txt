Oh Ive just come  
From the land of the sun  
From a war that must be won  
In the name of truth  
With our soldiers so brave  
your freedom we will save  
With our rifles and grenades  
And some help from God  
I want to see my family  
My wife and child waiting for me  
Ive got to go home  
Ive been so alone you see  
  
You just cant believe  
The joy I did receive  
When I finally got my leave  
And I was going home  
Oh I flew through the sky  
my convictions could not lie  
For my country I would die  
And I will see it soon  
I want to see my family  
My wife and child waiting for me  
Ive got to go home  
Ive been so alone you see  
  
When I walked through the door  
My wife she lay upon the floor  
And with tears her eyes were sore  
I did not know why  
Then I looked into her hand  
And I saw the telegram  
That said that I was a brave brave man  
But that I was dead  
I want to see my family  
My wife and child waiting for me  
Ive got to go home  
Ive been so alone you see
