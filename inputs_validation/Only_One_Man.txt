Spoken  
You know ladies and gentlemen  
Please know this  
I really love my man  
And I want exactly what hes got  
And I dont ever mind giving him every  
Bit of my love  
And baby you know  
Ive got a lot to give  
I got fire in my touch  
Theres nothing I wont do  
And I bend over backwards  
Just to give it all to you  
Cause theres only one man  
That can handle all this love  
Cause theres only one man  
That I want to be with tonight  
Cause theres only one man  
That can squeeze me inside  
The one man in my life  
And thats you you and you and you  
Cause theres only one man  
That can handle all this love  
Cause theres only one man  
That I want to be with tonight  
Said theres only one man in my life  
And thats you
