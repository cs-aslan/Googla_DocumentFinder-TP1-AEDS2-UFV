I got a funny feelin that all of you girls  
Had better hold on to your man  
Cause I feel I says I feel  
I feeeeel like breaking up somebodys home  
  
See lying here all alone  
On a rainy night like this  
Starvin for some lovin  
Ohoh what I would give  
What I would give for just one kiss  
Every rain drop I hear  
Against my window pane  
And its beatin through  
So loud and clear  
Words words that speak your name  
  
See I I got no where to turn  
Now that you have gone  
And I feel like  
Breaking up somebodys home  
  
I know its useless  
Hangin on when you belong to someone else  
But I cant shake the feelin  
Oh after all I didnt make this bed  
I got nowhere to turn  
Na na na now na now now that you have gone  
  
I saw the boy last night  
And I believe I caught a chill  
Well I could I could not control the vibration  
And my heart my heart  
My heart justa would not stand still  
I got nowhere to turn  
A now now now now that you have gone  
And I feel like  
Breaking up somebodys home  
Got nowhere a nowhere to run  
And Im so damn tired of being all alone  
And I feel like  
Breaking up somebodys home  
  
I know its useless  
Hangin on when you you you ya  
You belong to someone else  
But I la la la cant shake the feeling  
Oh after all I didnt want it this way  
I swear I did not want it this way  
But I got nowhere a no where to run  
And Im so gddamned tired of being alone  
And I feel like breaking up somebodys home  
Got nowhere a nowhere to run  
And Im so gddamned tired of being alone  
And I I feel like feel like  
Breaking up some muthas home  
One more time  
I I got nowhere to turn  
A nowhere to nowhere to nowhere to turn  
And I feel like I feel like  
Breaking breaking up somebosys home  
I gotta break up somebodys home
