Did you hear that lonesome whippoorwill  
He sounds too blue to fly  
The midnight train is whining low  
And Im so lonesome I could cry  
  
Did you ever see a night so long  
When time goes crawlin by  
The moon just went behind a cloud  
And Im so lonesome I could cry  
  
Did you ever see a robin weep  
When leaves begin to die  
That means hes lost the will to live  
And Im so lonesome I could cry  
  
The silence of a fallin star  
Lights up a purple sky  
And as I wonder where you are  
Im so lonesome I could cry  
  
Yeah II could cryeyeeye  
I could cryeye eyeeyeeye II could cryeye  
I could cryeye ohohohoh  
II could cry I could cry
