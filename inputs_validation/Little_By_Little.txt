Woah ohh

Just dont know any more  
  
But think of what youre saying I really think you should  
Youd better stop complaining it wont do you any good

When you drew your master plan  
But little by little Ill try to make you understand  
Little by little  
I try to make you understand  
  
Oh ohh  
You dont know anymore  
Got so far from the shore  
  
Youre one in a million if you could only see  
Youve less than perfect vision cant see the woods before the trees  
Gonna to shake you till your bell rings youre like a ship thats lost at sea  
But little by little Im going to bring you back to me  
Little by little Im gonna to bring you back to me  
  
Well you gotta get back home  
You gotta get back home  
Cause you gotta change your ways  
You gotta change your ways  
Cant do it all alone  
Cant do it all alone  
Cause youve got too much at stake  
Youve got too much at stake  
So get to it right away  
Ooh woah woaah  
  
Im going to set out on a rescue until this mission is complete  
Oh yes you know Im going to get you Ill make you listen to my plea  
Ah yeah you thought the grass was greener but then it didnt prove to be  
But little by little  
Im going to bring you back to me  
Little by little
