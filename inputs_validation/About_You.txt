Ive been thinking lately about you  
When it hit me from nowhere  
Out of the gray  
Everythings been coming together  
Now that Ive moved beyond myself  
And wrapped my head around something else  
  
Its not about me its gotta be about you  
and everyday I and all I want to see is who your turning me into  
and every way I will not forget that you said youd always bring me through  
To who I want to be making every part of me  
About you every part of me about you ya  
  
Ive been spending so much time disconnected  
I was searching for perfection inside myself  
But I finally turned away from my reflection my reflection  
And saw your world outside my door  
And everything that Im looking for  
  
Its not about me its gotta be about you  
and everyday I and all I want to see is who your turning me into  
and every way I will not forget that you said youd always bring me through  
To who I want to be making every part of me  
About you  
  
So I lay down my pride  
Cause you laid down your life  
And Im giving up all thats holding me back  
And lead me too you  
And you lead me through like you always do  
  
Its not about me its gotta be about you  
and everyday I and all I want to see is who your turning me into  
and every way I will not forget that you said youd always bring me through  
To who I want to be making every part of me  
About you every part of me about you ya
