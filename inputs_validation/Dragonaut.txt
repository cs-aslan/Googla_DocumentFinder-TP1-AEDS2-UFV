Welcome to my world of steel  
Master of my domain  
Cower as the pains unsealed  
Disasters where Ill reign  
  
Father of Sin  
Ill drag you all in  
Bow down as I petrify  
  
Fire in the sky  
Paralysed with fear  
You know youre gonna die  
Dragonaut is near  
  
Icon to the fall of man  
Worshipped like a king  
Fearless as I now condemn  
Every living thing  
  
Father of Sin  
Ill drag you all in  
Bow down as I petrify  
  
Fire in the sky  
Paralysed with fear  
You know youre gonna die  
Dragonaut is near  
  
Father of Sin  
Ill drag you all in  
Bow down as I petrify  
  
Relish the blaze  
Left all in a daze  
He came and consumed and let fly  
  
Fire in the sky  
Paralysed with fear  
You know youre gonna die  
Dragonaut is near  
  
Fire in the sky  
Paralysed with fear  
You know youre gonna die  
Dragonaut is near
