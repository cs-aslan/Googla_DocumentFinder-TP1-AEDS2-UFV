In the morning when I closed my eyes  
You were sleeping in paradise  
While the room was growing light  
I was holding still with all my might  
  
Ohwhat if its true  
What my heart says  
Ohwhatll I do  
What if this feeling becomes hard to part with  
  
You were meant to play your part  
In the design of a desperate heart  
While you gave your love to me  
I was betting I was getting it free  
  
Ohif Id only know  
What your heart cost  
Ohcan we call it a loan  
And a debt that I owe  
On a bet that I lost  
  
In the evening when you see my eyes  
Looking back at you no disguise  
Im not sure who you think youll see  
Im just hoping youll still know that its me  
  
Ohwhat if its true  
Better ask the man inside  
Ohthere seem to be two  
One steals the love  
The other one hides  
  
Yeahcan we call it a loan  
Till Ive paid in full for the seeds Ive sown  
Yeahcan we say that Ive grown in some way  
That we may have yet to be shown  
  
Ohif Id only known  
What your heart cost  
Ohcan we call it a loan  
And a debt that I own  
On a bet that I lost
