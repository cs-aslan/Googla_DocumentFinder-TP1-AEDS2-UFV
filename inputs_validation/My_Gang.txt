You changed your view  
Cause what you see  
Is black and blue  
  
White on the left  
Black on the right  
Nothing seems to fit  
On a new york night  
Have you heard the news  
Are you talking to me  
I said hey there honey do you like what you see  
  
Read about it it never fails  
We dont doubt it its in the mail  
So you want to be in my gang  
Youd better think it through  
Yeah you want to be in my gang  
You have to pay your dues  
  
We sleep at night  
On a bed of nails  
All i know  
Babys got some thrills  
  
White on the left  
Black on the right  
Nothing seems to fit  
On a new york night  
Have you heard the news  
Are you talking to me  
I said hey there honey do you like what you see  
  
Read about it it never fails  
We dont doubt it its in the mail  
So you want to be in my gang  
Youd better think it through  
Yeah you want to be in my gang  
You have to pay your dues
