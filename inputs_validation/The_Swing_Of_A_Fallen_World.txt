Achiever believer  
You saint and cold deceiver  
Its the swing of a fallen world  
Religion tactician  
Dark horse and politician  
Its the swing of a fallen world  
Betray but you wont get away  
  
The damage is done  
A million to one  
I bet we will witness the war of the sun  
The game that we play  
Is now here to stay  
We never can stop what weve sent on its way no  
Its the swing of a fallen world  
The swing of a fallen world  
  
Impeacher false preacher  
Grand man and paltry creature  
Its the swing of a fallen world  
Manslaughter garroter  
Youve slain you roughhoused daughter  
Its the swing of a fallen world  
Bye bye you too will die  
  
The treasure we had  
So crazy and mad  
Was sold out by people who cannot be glad  
A handful of greed  
A contagious seed  
A handful of assholes who never recede  
This adverse evolution  
Mankind knows no solution  
Its the swing of a fallen world  
  
The damage is done  
A million to one  
I bet we will witness the war of the sun  
The game that we play  
Is now here to stay  
We never can stop what weve sent on its way no  
Its the swing of a fallen world  
The swing of a fallen world
