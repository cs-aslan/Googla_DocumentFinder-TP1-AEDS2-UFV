I got a brand new baby and I feel so good  
She loves even better than I thought she would  
Im on my way to her house and Im plumb outta breath  
And when I see her tonight Im gonna squeeze her to death  
Claudette pretty little pet Claudette  
Never make me fret Claudette  
Shes the greatest little girl that Ive ever met  
I get the best lovin that Ill ever get from Claudette  
Oh oh Claudette  
Well Im a lucky man my baby treats me right  
Shes gonna let me hug and kiss an hold her tight  
And when the date is over and were at her front door  
When I kiss her good night Ill holler more more more  
Claudette pretty little pet Claudette  
Never make me fret Claudette  
Shes the greatest little girl that Ive ever met  
I get the best lovin that Ill ever get from Claudette  
Oh oh Claudette oh oh Claudette  
When me an my new baby have a date or three  
Im gonna ask my baby if shell marry me  
Im gonna be so happy for the rest of my life  
When my brand new baby is my brand new wife  
Claudette pretty little pet Claudette  
Never make me fret Claudette  
Shes the greatest little girl that Ive ever met

Oh oh Claudette oh oh Claudette
