Im facing the light  
But fading to black  
Im offering peace  
As Im stabed in the back  
  
Yet Im feeling able  
My house is made up still  
With paper for doors  
  
Ive tryed to hate you  
But feel regret  
Im most uncertain  
Ive lost the bet  
Im waiting to watch it  
Im waiting to see  
Is this my overture Or obituary  
  
Im holding the torch  
But melting my fists  
Im first in the line  
Yet last on the list  
  
Yet Im feeling able  
My house is made up still  
With paper for doors  
  
Ive tryed to hate you  
But feel regret  
Im most uncertain  
Ive lost the bet  
Im waiting to watch it  
Im waiting to see  
Is this my overture Or obituary  
  
Or obituary  
  
I tryed not to choke you No  
But now youre dead No  
Im most uncertain No  
Should I feel regret No  
  
Ive tryed to hate you  
But feel regret  
Im most uncertain  
Ive lost the bet  
Im waiting to watch it  
Im waiting to see  
Is this my overture Or obituery  
  
I tryed not to choke you  
  
Is this my overture Or obituery
