When I look for the love in your eyes  
You turn away  
And theres nothing as loud as the words  
That we never say  
Look at us now  
Standing on the edge again  
Its not too late to try again  
I need some  
  
Chorus  
Evidence of love  
To keep on going  
Show me some evidence of love  
And Ill be here  
I still believe we can see this through  
Theres only so much I can do  
And it doesnt make sense  
Without some evidence of love  
  
Theres a frozen look on your face  
Is it saying goodbye  
Cause theres nothing as cold as the ashes  
When the fire has died  
Talk to me now  
Tell me what youre missing  
Talk to me now  
And try to find your heart again  
I need some  
  
Chorus  
  
Stand and fight  
Gotta say whats on your mind baby  
So much is on the line  
Heres a chance to make it right  
  
Talk to me now  
Tell me what youre missing  
Talk to me now  
And try to find your heart again  
I need some  
  
Chorus
