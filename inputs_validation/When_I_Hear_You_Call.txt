When I  
Look into those bright eyes  
So young  
Always so ready to run  
Then I  
See your change when fun subsides  
And new colors start to arise  
Theres a hidden picture  
That wasnt seen outside  
  
When you run dont tire  
Keep on reaching higher  
Even when the pain and trouble bring you down sometimes  
I will see you through  
Im forever right here with you  
Even when you feel you dont need me around  
  
I will be your friend forever  
I will be your one big brother  
Even when I see you fall  
I will be your father  
When I hear you call  
  
Dont cry  
This is not the end nor goodbye  
But begin  
To know Im with you til the end  
And when you pray  
I will hear every word you say  
And so with all my promises made  
For one like you  
Someone whos especially made  
  
When you run dont tire  
Keep on reaching higher  
Even if the pain and trouble bring you down sometimes  
I will see you through  
Im forever right here with you  
Even if you feel you dont need me around  
  
I will be your friend forever  
I will be your one big brother  
Even when I see you fall  
I will be your father  
Yeah  
  
I will be your friend forever  
I will be your big brother  
Even when I see you fall  
I will be your father  
Yeah  
  
I will be your friend forever  
I will be your big brother  
Even when I see you fall  
I will be your father  
Be your friend your brother  
When I hear you call  
Lift you when you fall  
When I hear you call
