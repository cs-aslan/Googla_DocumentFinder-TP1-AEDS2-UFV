I was born an only son  
Didnt take to the rules like a normal child  
Prisoner of the things Ive done  
Its the price you pay livin fast and wild  
  
Chorus  
Ive spent too many nights lookin over my shoulder  
And the ways of the world make a heart grow colder  
Got nowhere left to hide  
The fight in me has died  
So I must wait for the sunrise  
  
Friend to fear and loaded gun  
Live life like the owner of a heart of stone  
No one touches touch no one  
But the road gets wary when youre all alone  
  
Chorus  
  
Too much done to undo  
No one I can run to  
I need one more chance to live my life again  
  
Chorus
