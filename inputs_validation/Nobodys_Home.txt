Nobodys Home  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
This house is full of people  
But nobodys home  
They all live together  
But theyre living life alone  
Everyone is searching  
For their own identity  
Missing all a family can be  
CHORUS  
Nobodys home  
Cant you see the man and wife  
Who look so very sad  
Nobodys home  
Cant you see the little boy  
Who needs his mom and dad  
If they would only take a little time  
To love eadch other  
They would find the joy  
That they will never find alone  
When nobodys home  
This world is full of people  
But nobodys home  
The streets are always crowded  
But we walk through life alone  
Jesus is calling  
Asking us to change  
And we could be a family in His name  
Nobodys home  
Cant you see the man and wife  
Who look so very sad  
Nobodys home  
Cant you see the little girl  
Who needs a mom and dad  
If they would only take a little time  
To love eadch other  
They would find the joy  
That they will never find alone  
When nobodys home  
This house is full of people
