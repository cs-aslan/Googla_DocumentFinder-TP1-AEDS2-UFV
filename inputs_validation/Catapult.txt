Doctor Davis telephone pleaseDoctor Davis telephone please  
  
Id catapult downtown  
To see the galleries  
And my favorite fiancee  
In a lavender gown  
  
But Im hooked up to a machine  
It performs my daily functions  
Through a tube in my wien  
  
And today that thing malfunctioned  
Like a forest fire  
It burnt a hole in me and I perspired  
  
So there aint gonna be a wedding  
No love affair  
No art to which none compares
