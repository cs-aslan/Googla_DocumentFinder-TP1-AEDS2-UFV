Verse 1  
Can you just stay through the night  
Turn down the bed and the blinds  
Before your turn around  
Can you just stay through the night  
Let me breathe you in til gravity bends  
And we fall through the hole in the light  
Make this our kingdom  
Somewhere where good love conquers and not divide  
  
Chorus  
Cause I may not know a lot of things but  
I feel it in my chest  
Know I wont let the blue flame die  
We cant lose hope just yet  
Cause its once just once in a lifetime  
And were scared to love but its alright  
I may not know a lot of things but  
I know that were surefire yeah  
Know that were surefire yeah  
  
Verse 2  
Cant keep this bed warm on the left side  
When something is cold as a goodbye  
Why dont you turn around  
Ignore all that shit from the outside  
The world is a nightmare  
Wake up and stay here  
Let me be on your side  
Well make this our kingdom  
Somewhere where good love conquers and not divide  
  
PreChorus  
And oh my oh my oh my oh my God  
Im so Im so Im so tired of fighting  
Let go give in let go and give up oh  
  
Chorus  
I may not know a lot of things but  
I feel it in my chest  
Know I wont let the blue flame die  
We cant lose hope just yet  
Cause its once just once in a lifetime  
And were scared to love but its alright  
I may not know a lot of things but  
I know that were surefire  
Know that were surefire  
  
PreChorus  
And oh my oh my oh my oh my God  
Im so Im so Im so tired of fighting  
Let go give in let go and give up oh  
  
Chorus  
I may not know a lot of things but  
I feel it in my chest  
If we just let the blue flame die  
The devil wins this bet  
Oh its once just once in a lifetime  
And youre scared to love but its alright  
I may not know a lot of things but  
I know that were surefire  
Know that were surefire
