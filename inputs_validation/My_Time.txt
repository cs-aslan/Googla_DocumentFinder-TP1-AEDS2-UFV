Yea  
  
Go hard today  
The past is the past you know  
Cant worry the past cause that yesterday  
Its a new day bro  
Im a put it on the line cause its my time  
My day gotta do it now  
Hey hey hey hey  
I gotta stay on my grind cause its my time hey  
My time hey my time hey  
If your with me let me hear you say common  
Ma ma ma ma dah dah dah dah dah  
If your with me let me hear you say  
Ma ma ma ma dah dah dah dah dah  
Its my time  
  
Guess what time it is my my my time  
You can check your I phone better say its Itime  
I dont even need a watch I dont even see a clock  
Soon as a I walk in it feel like me oclock  
Give me a clock every time I check  
Singers dont measure up and try and blame the Pyrex  
Damn Ima do it bigger than a 5ex  
Cant ride with an L so I dont drive Lex  
Games so bickery so full of trickery  
Nursery rhyming hickory dickory  
Blowing that side the hood call it pickory  
Biggie puffy busta victory  
  
Chorus  
Go hard today  
Cant worry the past cause that yesterday  
Im a put it on the line cause its my time  
Hey hey hey hey  
I gotta stay on my grind cause its my time hey  
My time hey my time hey  
If your with me let me hear you say cmon  
Ma ma ma ma dah dah dah dah dah  
If your with me let me hear you say  
Ma ma ma ma dah dah dah dah dah  
Its my time  
  
My time is more like fly time  
Dont call to gettin dressed call it in a sky time  
If you aint a pilot you probably couldnt style it  
Unless you was a stewardess you wonder what to do with this  
First I take the time out then I put the time in  
Money aint everything its more about the timing  
So I got the water mark flawless diamonds  
In other words thats called perfect timing  
I feel like a favor I feel like a savor  
They clockin my neck I feel like Im flavor  
I go so hard  
Damn street fi di di di damn  
  
Chorus  
  
ONine all mine its been a few years  
Now its me bout time  
You know Ive got committed with it since Ive been up in the zone  
Sign the dotted line  
Now is on  
So yall better check your wrist piece why  
Cause its time to make history yeah  
Just hop up here in this hit streak  
Howda howda howda hell you gonna evict me  
You know Im here stay never cocky now  
With bottles we poppin now  
No telling where we stopping now  
And I represent the chick ago  
On the track with FABO  
You know we  
  
Chorus
