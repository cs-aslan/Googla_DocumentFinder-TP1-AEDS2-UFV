Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina  
  
Wishing is good time wasted  
Still its a habit they say  
Wishing for sweets Ive tasted  
Thats all I do all day  
Maybe theres nothing in wishing  
But speaking of wishing Ill say  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning  
  
No one could be sweeter  
Than my sweetie when I meet her  
In the morning  
  
When the morning glories  
Twine around the door  
Whispering pretty stories  
I long to hear once more  
Strolling with my girlie  
Where the dew is pearly early  
In the morning  
  
Butterflies all flutter up  
And kiss each little buttercup  
At dawning  
If I had Aladdins lamp  
For only a day  
Id make a wish  
And heres what Id say  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning  
  
Dreaming was meant for night time  
I live in dreams all the day  
I know its not the right time  
But still I dream away  
What could be sweeter than dreaming  
Just dreaming and drift away  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning  
  
No one could be sweeter  
Than my sweetie when I meet her  
In the morning  
  
When the morning glories  
Twine around the door  
Whispering pretty stories  
I long to hear once more  
Strolling with my girlie  
Where the dew is pearly early  
In the morning  
  
Butterflies all flutter up  
And kiss each little buttercup  
At dawning  
If I had Aladdins lamp  
For only a day  
Id make a wish  
And heres what Id say  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning
