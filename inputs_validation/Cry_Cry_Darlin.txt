Cry cry darlin thats what Ill do  
If you should leave me with the blues  
Cry cry darlin thats what Ill do  
If youre the one that I should lose  
  
For me there will be no moonlight  
If ever we should part  
Cry cry darlin thats all Ill do  
Cause youre the one thats in my heart  
  
Cry cry darlin my eyes would cry  
And never dry if you should go  
Cry cry darlin when shadows creep  
Ill just weep all night I know  
  
You know how much Id miss you  
If ever we should part  
Cry cry darlin thats all Ill do  
Cause youre the one thats in my heart  
  
Oh cry cry darlin thats all Ill do  
Cause youre the one thats in my heart
