Fuck ya head up more than that bullshit ya smokin  
Niggas buzz you in the door but I blew it open  
Ya rhymes is trash that verse aint worth a token  
Try to hop this monotonous murderous thoughts  
When Im plottin this overthrow the government  
Burn the whole metropolis lyrical warfare  
Hiphop Apocalypse strap devils to the chairs  
Start shockin shit Q you I chew through  
We could battle in the projects and give or take the clue  
Flex could get one too the wait Im supplyin  
My crew pop they iron from HTM to the peaks of Mount Zion  
Im ready for the showdown  
Mention my name cowboy watch it go down  
I blow through your clique like Hurricane Floyd  
Keep rappers paranoid kept your bodies in the game  
Is something I cant avoid shit get tricky like Siegfried and Roy  
I seek and destroy

The mic how I strike it got em dialin psychics  
Roll with minds dont give a fuck if you dont like it  
With niggas thats invited without recited ignited  
It burn mad slow and thats why Ill easily light it  
Me and the ghettos reunited all the broads is excited  
Your ass looks stupid tryna fight it  
You wanna get your ass smacked up  
So you can dig into the stash that I stacked up  
But when my Queens niggas flashed then you backed up  
Keep my dogs fed so they can shit when niggas act up  
Its the L nigga dot com dot hot lead red dot on your head be  
And the rappers you idolized that idolized me  
I walk in the spot niggas part like the Red Sea  
And Todds Shop of Horrors we battle to the death tonight  
Theres no tomorrow Im out for revenge  
Like the rebels in Nicaragua but I can take it farther  
Travel back in time fill ya baby bottle with lava
