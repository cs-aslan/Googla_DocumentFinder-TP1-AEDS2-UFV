  
Ya get to the party and yell out  
Whos got the cups  
Youre on a mission  
A mission to get fucked up  
Ya babysit the keg until  
Its spittin out just foam  
Yer just gettin buzzed so  
Theres no talk of goin home  
Beer run Beer run  
The keg is fried lets get  
Another one  
Beer run Beer run  
Its way too early to end the fun  
Beer run Beer run  
The kegs have run dry but weve  
Got money form the door  
We got empties for deposit so we  
Can get a couple more  
Weve only got ten minutes  
To make it to the liquor store  
Get yer ass in gear or this nightll  
Be a fuckin bore  
Beer run Beer run  
The keg is fried lets get  
Another one  
Beer run Beer run  
Its way too early to end the fun  
Beer run Beer run  
Hurry up and name yer poison

Any balltap kegll do  
Fuck that leaky twoprong  
All of em have alcohol  
So just grab the cheapest one  
Lets get back to the party and  
Roll out that barrel of fun  
Beer run Beer run  
The keg is fried lets get  
Another one  
Beer run Beer run  
Its way too early to end the fun  
Beer run Beer run  
Youre on a mission  
A mission to get fucked up
