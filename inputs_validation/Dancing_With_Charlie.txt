Charlie was a loser till that sunny day  
Noone saw him leaving as he sailed away  
Treated like a sinner noone gave a damn  
Till Charlie threw two sixes  
Now hes got them in his hand  
  
Now theyre waiting in line to go dancing with Charlie  
They want to be seen dancing with Charlie  
  
Noone seems to know how  
Noone seems to care  
Doesnt really matter just as long as you are there  
Party in the moonlight free drinks at the bar  
You can bet whats in your pocket that Charlie wont be far  
Now theyre waiting in line to go dancing with Charlie  
They want to be seen dancing with Charlie  
  
Charlie bought a jet plane Charlie rides the sky  
Friends appear from nowhere Charlie gets them high  
Big D was a gambler with everything to lose  
Charlie didnt have anything  
So he didnt have to choose  
  
And theyre waiting in line to go dancing with Charlie  
They want to be seen dancing with Charlie  
And theyre standing in line to go dancing with Charlie  
They want to be seen dancing with Charlie
