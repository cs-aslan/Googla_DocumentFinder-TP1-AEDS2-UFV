On again  
No I newer knew we could go on and on  
They never thought we would be rockin on  
No we never thought we  could be rockin on  
  
Home again  
And it wont be very long before Im gone again  
Now Im gone again  
And its never really long before Im home again  
If you like what I like come rock with me  
If you like what I like  oh Im on again  
No I never knew we could go on and on  
They never thought we would be rockin on  
No we never thought we  could be rockin on  
  
Take a look again  
Is it really very hard to see the signs again  
Were you listening  
When I said that I was giving up my worryin  
If you like what I like come rock with me  
If you like what I like  oh Im on again  
No I never knew we could go on and on  
They never thought we would be rockin on  
No we never thought we  could be rockin on  
  
Oh Im on again  
No I never knew we could go on and on  
They never thought we would be rockin on  
No we never thought we  could be rockin on
