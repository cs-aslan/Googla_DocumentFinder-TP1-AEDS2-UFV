Bridge Andre 3000  
A boy  
To raise  
At a  
Young age  
No help  
From him  
But shes alive  
To be  
Made strong  
But all  
Alone  
Must be  
A pain  
But shes alive  
  
Andre 3000  
The year was 1975  
That night crickets cried  
They knew what was going down  
Three girls travel a long country road  
And one said she thinks its time  
This baby wants to come right now  
  
Bridge  
  
I was scufflin going to school  
I was scufflin working at night  
And you know what  
I truly believe  
And thats why I tell a lot of parents  
Single parents dont tell me what God cant do  
I made sure you had  
I never felt like you should be deprived of anything  
If a man didnt want to take care of his child  
You move on  
And thats what I did  
I moved on

A boy  
To raise  
At at a  
Young age  
No help  
From him  
But shes alive  
  
He always wanted to be a father  
But he never took care of you  
He aint have no money  
He aint have nothin  
How can you care about somebody  
And you never give the welfare of them

At a  
Young age  
No help  
From him  
But shes alive  
To be  
Made strong  
But all  
Alone  
Must  
  
And I knew I had to go that road by myself

Shes alive
