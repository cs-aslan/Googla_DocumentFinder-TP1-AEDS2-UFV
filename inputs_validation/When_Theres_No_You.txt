I walk along an empty street  
And night becomes another dawn  
Its only heartaches that I meet  
And tears that tell me you have gone from me  
  
Is it hard to see that my heart is breaking  
It was yours for the taking  
You said were through  
What can I do when theres no you  
  
This kind of lonliness I found  
Has taken over in my mind  
And it will always be around  
For love like ours Ill never find I know  
  
Did you have to go cause my heart is breaking  
It was yours for the taking  
You said were through  
What can I do when theres no you  
  
My heart is breaking  
It was yours for the taking  
You said were through  
What can I do when theres no you
