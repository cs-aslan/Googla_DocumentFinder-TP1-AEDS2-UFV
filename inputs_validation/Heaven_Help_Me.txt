If you want it you can have it  
Thats what you said  
But I dont want the things that you leave behind  
Take the pictures take the windows and the walls  
But baby wont you leave me my peace of mind  
Oh such a waste of time  
Oh such a waste  
I still want you baby  
  
Heaven help me heaven help me  
Talk to strangers talk to strangers  
Heaven help me  
Over you  
Help me over you  
I cant seem to take these changes  
Everything reminds my heart of you  
  
Thought the first time was the last time  
Wed be here forever  
Now I find Im having to search again  
Itll happen  
Its gotta happen  
Come together  
I just wish somebody would tell me when  
  
Oh such a waste of time  
Oh such a waste  
I still want you baby  
  
Heaven help heaven help  
Heaven heaven heaven help me  
Heaven help heaven help  
Heaven heaven heaven help me  
  
Youre someone elses lady  
So sad without you darlin  
The gods of love cant help me now  
Heaven help heaven help  
Heaven heaven heaven help me
