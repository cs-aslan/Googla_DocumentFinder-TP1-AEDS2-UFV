Gonna take a chance on her one bullet in the cylinder  
And in a moment of passion get the glory like Charles Manson  
  
Gonna smile Im gonna laugh youre gonna get a blood bath  
And in a moment of passion get the glory like Charles Manson  
  
You gotta go go go go goodbye glad to see you go go go go goodbye  
Now I know the score I dont need you anymore dont want  
You cause youre a bore I need somebody good I need a miracle  
Should I take a chance on her one bullet in the cylinder  
  
Gonna smile Im gonna laugh theyre gonna want my autograph  
And in a moment of passion get the glory like Charles Manson  
  
You gotta go go go go goodbye Glad to see you go go go go goodbye  
Goodbye
