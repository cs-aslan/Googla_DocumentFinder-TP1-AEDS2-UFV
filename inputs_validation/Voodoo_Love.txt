Verse  
Im gonna mix a potion up  
Make a special drink for you  
Mmmm hmmm  
Just a little sip and youre never gonna know what hit you  
Yeh  
When Im through  
Aww yeh  
  
Pre  
Now Im not talkin bout movies  
Dont need no happy end  
I just wanna make you love me  
And stay through thick and thin  
Im just gonna use some magic  
Might feel a little drunk  
And if you try to leave me  
Ill lock you in the trunk  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna witch you and stick a pin right in you  
My voodoos so addicting  
3 silver spoons of brandy wine  
Just a frog and a little thyme and  
Baby youll be mine  
With my voodoo love  
Aw yeh  
With my voodoo love  
Aw yeh  
  
Verse 2  
Boy I really knew you were the one  
The moment that I saw your eyes  
Mmm hmmm  
Strong and wise and sweet and quiet  
Yeah youre just my type  
Mmm hmmm  
  
Pre 2  
Now Im not talkin bout movies  
Dont need no happy end  
I just wanna make you love me  
And be my shiny prince  
Im just gonna use some magic  
Might feel a little high  
But well be so enchanted  
And youll feel so alive  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
I always get  
Just what I want  
And boy I really want you now  
So just say yes  
Cant second guess the power of my voodoo love
