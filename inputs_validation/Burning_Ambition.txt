So you think you can own me well youd better just think again  
Youd better watch your steps now woman cause I aint like those other men  
Theres something burning inside me that makes me want to be free  
And when I get these feelings honey you better keep away from me  
  
Theres things in life now baby that I know Ive got to do  
And I need your love now baby to help me see it through  
So you think you can own me well youd better just think again  
Youd better watch your steps now woman cause I aint like those other men
