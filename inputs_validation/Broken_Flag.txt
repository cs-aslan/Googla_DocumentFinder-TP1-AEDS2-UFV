Nodding tho the lamps lit low nod for passers underground  
To and fro shes darning and the land is weeping red and pale  
Weeping yarn from Algiers Weeping yarn from Algiers  
  
Weaving tho the eyes are pale what will rend will also mend  
The sifting cloth is binding and the dream she weaves will never end  
For were marching toward Algiers For were marching toward Algiers  
  
Lullaby tho babys gone Lullaby a broken song  
Oh the cradle was our call When it rocked we carried on  
And we marched on toward Algiers For were marching toward Algiers  
Were still marching for Algiers Marching marching for Algiers  
Not to hail a barren sky Sifting cloth is weeping red  
The mourning veil is waving high a field of stars and tears weve shed  
In the sky a broken flag children wave and raise their arms  
Well be gone but theyll go on and on and on and on and on
