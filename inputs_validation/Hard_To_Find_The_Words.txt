Mama sometimes I feel inside  
Theres nothing I can say  
Nothing I can do  
Could ever match the love you gave  
You taught me how to live  
Told me walk before you run  
And you were always there to pick me up  
Everytime Id have a fall  
  
And mama I know theres been times  
When I didnt always understrand  
By and by we do some growing up  
And it makes just a little more sense  
But sometimes its hard to find the words  
But Ill do the best that I can  
Thank you for the love mama  
Its what made this boy a man  
  
I know the roads been long  
And I know youve seen some rain  
Making the best of what we had  
I never heard you complain  
When I look in the mirror today  
Wondering could I be as strong  
Could I give as much to someone else  
As you gave to your son  
  
And mama I know theres been times  
When we didnt see eye to eye  
By and by we do some growing up  
And we understand the reasons why  
But sometimes its hard to find the words  
But Ill do the best I can  
Thank you for the love mama  
Its what made this boy a man yea  
  
Many years have gone by  
And Ive been living them the best I can  
  
And mama I know theres been times  
When I didnt always understand  
By and by we do some growing up  
And it makes just a little more sense  
But sometimes its hard to find the words  
But Ill do the best I can  
Thank you for the love mama  
Its what made this boy a man yea
