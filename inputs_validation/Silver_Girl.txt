She was a silver girl  
Lost in a high tech world  
She was a golden girl  
Immersed in a hard core world  
She would have preferred  
The last generation  
But thats all right  
Shes on her way  
  
She had the Midas touch  
She was Lady Luck  
Shes got a million bucks  
And she looks like it  
Shes had a few hard times  
Sometimes it blows her mind  
Those papers she never signed  
Sometimes she remembers  
  
Sometimes she was just an actress  
But youll never really know  
A shadow moves across her face  
You cannot see her soul  
Unless she lets you  
See her soul  
  
She was a girlie girl  
Caught in a mans world  
And as her world turns  
She feels so alone  
Still shes a danger girl  
Insane far beyond her years  
On some things shes very clear  
Shes a wild adventurer  
  
Sometimes she was just an actress  
But youll never really know  
A shadow moves across her face  
You cannot see her soul  
  
Sometimes she was just an actress  
But youll never really know  
A shadow moves across her face  
You cannot see her soul  
  
You cannot see her soul  
You cannot see her soul  
You cannot see her soul unless she lets you  
See her soul  
See her soul if she lets you  
See her soul  
  
Sometimes shes an actress  
Youll never really know  
Shadows move across her face  
You cannot see her soul  
You cannot see her soul
