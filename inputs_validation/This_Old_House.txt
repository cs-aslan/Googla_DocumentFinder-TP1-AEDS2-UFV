This old house was once for dancing  
This old house once filled with joy  
With its beauty so entrancing  
Every little girl and boy  
Now its halls are filled with darkness  
Its rooms are dusty cold  
This old house is growing so old  
  
Take a walk into the ballroom  
Now it hardly looks the same  
Now its chandelier is shattered  
Only stillness here remains  
Long ago there was the laughter  
Through the stories that were told  
This old house has grown so old  
  
Carefull of the stairs  
Dont sit on the broken chair  
Peole passing by  
Used to pause out in the square  
Now they go on by  
No one even stops to stare  
Its so all alone  
No one cares  
  
Theyll tear down this house come morning  
Build a new one in its place  
Put an end to all its glory  
Put an end to all its grace  
And the sun will set when evening comes  
Stars will fill the sky   
And stars will fill the sky
