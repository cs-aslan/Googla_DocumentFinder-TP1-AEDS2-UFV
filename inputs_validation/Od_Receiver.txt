Heartbeat  
I cant see you  
Heartbeat  
I can hear you  
I feel you pumping just beyond my door  
I know exactly  
What youve crawled here for  
Cringe down lower  
Youre all dressed in grey  
Me Im still breathing  
Its just not your day  
  
I hear you whisper like an open grave  
OD Receiver I am all you crave  
Youre dying crying I can hear you fall  
Your bony fingers scratching on my wall  
  
OD Receiver  
  
I hear you screaming well at least you try  
Me Im still smiling but I dont know why  
Id call a doctor if I had the time  
But Im so busy with this fix of mine  
  
OD Receiver
