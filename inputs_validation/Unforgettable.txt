Unforgettable  
Thats what you are  
Unforgettable  
Tho near or far  
Like a song of love that clings to me  
How the thought of you does things to me  
Never before has someone been more  
Unforgettable in every way  
And forever more thats how youll stay  
Thats why darling its incredible  
That someone so unforgettable  
Thinks that I am unforgettable too  
  
Unforgettable in every way  
And forever more thats how youll stay  
Thats why darling its incredible  
That someone so unforgettable  
Thinks that I am unforgettable too
