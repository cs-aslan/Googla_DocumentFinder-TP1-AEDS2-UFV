Country livin really gets me down  
So Im headin for the lights of town  
Gonna kiss the country life goodbye  
I got myself a brand new high  
  
Funky music where the lights are bright  
Tell the ladies Ill be there tonight  
Its a paradise of push and shove  
I gotta get back to the streets I love  
  
Chorus  
I tried to fake it I couldnt make it  
Down in my soul Im a city boy city boy  
I tried to hide it its been decided  
Dont you just know Im a city boy boy  
Oh I gotta satisfy it  
Take me up town and let me boogie all night long  
Oh I hate the peace and quiet  
I gotta yell I gotta shout I gotta dance till I burn myself out  
  
I gotta be me I gotta be free  
Welcome me home Im a city boy city boy  
And now I know it well dont I show it  
Mama take a look at your city boy city boy  
  
Music  
  
Bring it on home bring it on home to me  
Bring it on home bring it on home to me  
  
Its the only place Ive ever been  
Where they never pull the sidewalks in  
Lifes a party and you cant go wrong  
Cos Saturday night lasts a whole week long  
  
I tried to fake it I couldnt make it  
Down in my soul Im a city boy city boy  
I tried to hide it its been decided  
Dont you just know Im a city boy boy  
Oh I gotta satisfy it  
Take me up town and let me boogie all night long  
Oh I hate the peace and quiet  
I gotta yell I gotta shout I gotta dance till I burn myself out  
  
I gotta be me I gotta be free  
Welcome me home Im a city boy city boy  
And now I know it well dont I show it  
Mama take a look at your city boy city boy
