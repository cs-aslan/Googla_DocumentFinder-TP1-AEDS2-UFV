Im not one to look behind I know that times must change  
But over there in Barrytown they do things very strange  
And though youre not my enemy  
I like things like they used to be  
And though youd like some company  
Im standing by myself  
Go play with someone else  
I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown  
  
Dont believe Im taken in by stories I have heard  
I just read the Daily News and swear by every word  
And dont think that Im out of line  
For speaking out for what is mine  
Id like to see you do just fine  
But look at what you wear  
And the way you cut your hair  
  
I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown  
  
In the beginning we recall that the word was hurled  
Barrytown people got to be from another world  
  
Leave me or Ill be just like the others you will meet  
They wont act as kindly if they see you on the street  
And dont you scream or make a shout  
Its nothing you can do about  
It was there where you came out  
Its a special lack of grace  
I can see it in your face  
  
I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown
