Wake up  
Youre beautiful loved and blessed  
Feel me I think I do  
  
When you found me I was just a piece of clay  
I was formless you gave me a new name  
With the breath of life I now live abundantly  
All I needed was the potters hand  
And the blood on Calvary thats right  
  
But to much power tell it  
Can can sometimes turn to shame  
To much desire  
Sometimes makes you feel the same come on  
But forgiveness is how you win the game  
I begged for truth now I know the truth  
And that is when you came and said I was  
  
Beautiful loved and blessed  
Im better than the day before  
Cause you made me confess that I am  
Beautiful loved and blessed  
When youre free youre really free indeed  
All you gotta do is just plant the seed  
  
A constant battle to stay ahead of the game  
Is anybody famous when everybody wants fame  
Always trying to break you down  
Thinkin thatll raise em up  
I just wanna be happy  
Come take this bitter cup from me  
  
If I were ever to write my life story  
I could truly say through all the pain and glory  
I was just a piece of clay in need of the potters hand  
Cause when you whispered in my ear  
The words I so now understand oh  
  
Beautiful loved and blessed  
Im better than the day before  
Cause you made me confess that I am  
Beautiful loved and blessed  
When youre free youre really free indeed  
All you gotta do is just plant the seed  
  
Everything you made you said Thats good  
Before the fall of man you said Thats good  
Every time I walk in faith thats good  
You let me see another day thats good  
Before the earth was made you said  
Tamar I will lead the way and youll go far  
Knowledge and understanding  
Understanding is good  
And when I wake up in the morning  
All I hear in my hood is people saying that theyre  
  
Beautiful loved and blessed  
When you rescue me from the darkness  
And our heart just must confess  
Beautiful loved and blessed  
When youre free youre free indeed  
All you gotta do is just plant the seed  
  
Hey hey hey  
Wake up its a new day  
Hey hey hey  
Wave youre hands in the air and say  
Hey hey hey  
Wake up its a new day  
Hey hey hey  
Wave youre hands in the air and say  
  
Beautiful loved and blessed  
You rescued me from the darkness in the wilderness  
But I am beautiful loved and blessed  
No matter what the challenge  
I always pass the test  
  
Thats what I am beautiful  
Thats what I am beautiful  
I dont mean to put nobody down  
Still I must confess that I am  
Beautiful thats what I am  
Thats what I am  
When you wanna give up dont cause you know  
You always got a friend  
  
Thats what I am thats what I am  
Thats what I am  
Beautiful beautiful  
Thats what I am thats what I am  
Thats what I am  
Beautiful beautiful  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
Beautiful beautiful  
Beautiful beautiful
