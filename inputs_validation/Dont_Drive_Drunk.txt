He and his wife have had problems  
That hes played off like nothings wrong  
Til he comes home from work early  
Just to find the girl is gone  
Oh but he gets into the cupboard  
Picks out that bottle of gin  
Drinks like theres no tomorrow  
And decides to take a spin  
  
No dont drive drunk  
Dont drive drunk no  
Dont drive drunk  
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad  
  
Teenager at a live party  
Says give me one for the road  
But hes already so inebriated  
If you lit a smoke hed explode  
But bartender says I dont think so  
Young one says I can deal  
Staggering out he says check you all later  
But I really dont think he will  
  
No dont drive drunk

Dont drive drunk  
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad  
Repeat

Gets pulled over by the law
