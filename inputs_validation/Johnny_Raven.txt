Free and untamed thats how Ive grown  
Settling down aint my nature  
Roots Ill never own  
Oh your smile  
But tell me aint your child  
How can you cage a bird  
Born to be wild  
  
Chorus  
Im Johnny Raven by and by  
Oh Im going to leave your nest girl  
Another nest to try  
Ooh Johnny Raven  
Girl you know I shouldnt have loved you  
Yeah but I gotta leave you  
When my restless heart says goodbye  
  
Look at you little girl  
You feel love so deep  
If I could change in a second  
Id change for you like that  
Stay right here for keeps  
But Im home free for no thrills  
Stray I will  
Seems I gotta need one girl  
Never can feel  
  
Chorus  
  
Everybody knows my name  
Im Johnny Raven yeah yeah by and by  
Im gonna fly  
When you cry part of mes gonna die
