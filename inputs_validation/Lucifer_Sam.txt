Lucifer Sam Siam cat  
Always sitting by your side  
Always by your side  
That cats something I cant explain  
  
Ginger the gentle youre the witch  
Youre the left side  
Hes the right side  
Oh no  
That cats something I cant explain  
  
Lucifer go to sea  
Be a hip cat be a ships cat  
Somewhere anywhere  
That cats something I cant explain  
  
At night prowling sifting sand  
Hiding around on the ground  
Hell be found when youre around  
That cats something I cant explain
