If ever I would leave you it wouldnt be in summer  
Seeing you in summer I never would go  
Your hair streaked with sunlight your lips red as flame your face with a
luster  
That puts gold to shame  
  
But if Id ever leave you it couldnt be in autumn  
How Id leave in autumn I never will know  
Ive seen how you sparkle when fall nips the air  
I know you in autumn and I must be there  
  
And could I leave you running merrily through the snow  
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fires glow  
  
If ever I would leave you how could it be in springtime  
Knowing how in spring Im bewitched by you so  
Oh no not in springtime  
Summer winter or fall  
No never could I leave you at all  
  
No never could I leave you at all
