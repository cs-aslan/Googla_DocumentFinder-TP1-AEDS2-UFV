I get up in the morning  
For my dose of the news  
Crawl right back in the sack girl  
Had enough of the truth  
  
Spend your dollars and rubels  
Buy a piece of the wall  
Build it up in your backyard  
Im so sick of it all  
  
Ooh its a crazy world  
Ooh its a crazy world  
  
Drivin down to the city  
Doin 155  
Better late than never  
Im more dead than alive  
  
We can find the Titanic  
Put a man on the moon  
But we cant fix out backyard  
Man we better start soon  
  
Ooh its a crazy world  
Ooh its a crazy world  
Ooh its a crazy world  
Ooh its a crazy world  
  
I dont want to hear about it  
I wish it would be worlds away  
You know the more I think about it  
The more I feel we need to change  
  
I get up In a crazy crazy world  
We all live In a crazy crazy world  
Ooh yeah Its a crazy crazy world  
I gotta get out Of this crazy crazy world  
  
Goin home to my baby  
Its been another hard day  
Bust my balls for the tax man  
So what else can I say  
  
They spent our money on missiles  
For the third world war  
Now theyre stacked in my backyard  
We dont need them no more  
  
Ooh its a crazy world  
Ooh its a crazy world  
Ooh its a crazy world  
Ooh its a crazy world
