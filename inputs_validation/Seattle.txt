Ridin round and round  
In my car I cant afford to go very far  
It needs a new transmission and new brakes  
  
Parking tickets  
I cannot pay  
Theyre gonna have to tow me away  
Tow me away  
Cause I cant afford to drive  
  
Were outta groceries again  
Aint got no money to spend  
The credit card is maxed out  
So lets get high  
Cause its raining all the time  
And the rains been seeping through my mind  
But I get by  
  
Ive got a nasty rash on my rocker  
I cant afford to go see the doctor  
I know Ill be all right in a couple of weeks  
  
Happy hour  
Thats where were meeting  
Eat for free as long as youre drinking  
Hey that aint no problem  
For you and me  
  
Were outta groceries again  
Aint got no money to spend  
The credit card is maxed out  
So lets get high  
Cause its raining all the time  
And the rains been seeping through my mind  
But I get by  
  
Were outta groceries again  
Aint got no money to spend  
The credit card is maxed out  
So lets get high  
Cause its raining all the time  
And the rains been seeping through my mind  
But I get by  
  
Yeah Im all right Its all right
