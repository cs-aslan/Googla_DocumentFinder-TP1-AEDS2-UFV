Theres 52 ways to murder anyone  
One and two are the same  
And they both work as well  
  
Im coming clean for Amy  
Julie doesnt scream as well  
And the cops wont listen all night  
  
And so maybe Ill be over  
Just as soon as I fill them all in  
  
And I cant remember when I saw her last  
We were running around and having a blast  
But the backseat of the drivein is so lonely without you  
I know when youre home  
  
I was thinking about you  
There was something I forgot to say  
I was crying on a Saturday Night  
  
I was out cruising without you  
They were playing our song  
Crying on a Saturday Night  
  
As the moon becomes the night time  
You go viciously quietly away  
Im sitting in the bedroom where we used to sit and smoke cigarettes  
Now Im watching  
Watching you die
