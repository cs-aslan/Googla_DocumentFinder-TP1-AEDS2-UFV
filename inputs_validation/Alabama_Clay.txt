First time he saw the ground get busted  
He was ten and it was 1952  
His daddy worked hard from sunup to sundown  
And the goin got tough behind them ol grey mules  
  
The farm grew to be a moneymaker  
And the house he lived in grew up room by room  
The boy worked hard but soon got tired of farmin  
So he slipped away one night neath the harvest moon  
  
His neck was red as Alabama clay  
But the citys call pulled him away  
Hes got a factory job and runs a big machine  
He dont miss the farm or the fields of green  
  
Now the citys just a prison without fences  
His job is just a routine he cant stand  
And at night he dreams of wideopen spaces  
Fresh dirt between his toes and on his hands  
  
Then one day a picture came inside a letter  
Of a young girl with a baby in her arms  
And the words she wrote would change his life forever  
So he went to raise his family on the farm  
  
His neck is red as Alabama clay  
Now hes goin home this time to stay  
Where the roots run deep on the family tree  
And the tractor rolls through the fields of green  
  
His neck is red as Alabama clay  
Now hes goin home this time to stay  
Where the roots run deep on the family tree  
And the tractor rolls through the fields of green  
  
His neck is red as Alabama clay
