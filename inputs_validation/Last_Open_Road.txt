How fast can I run  
How far can I go  
These are the questions  
The young want to know  
I met her in Brooklyn  
She was coming from a place  
I said where are you going to  
She said where have you been  
  
cause Im trapped in here  
Set me free  
I know your world let me see  
Take me down that last open road  
Take me down that last open road  
Take me down that last open road  
  
I know there is so much past  
this place  
I see it smile on your jagged  
ragged face  
Something tells me  
something strong  
Theres a world Ive heard of  
So before its gone  
Take me down that last open road  
Take me down that last open road
