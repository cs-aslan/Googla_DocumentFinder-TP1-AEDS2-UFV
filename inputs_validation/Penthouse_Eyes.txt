What you lookin at girl  
  
Shes always checkin with her penthouse eyes  
Makes me stutter gives me butterflies  
Got to have her she pins me up with her penthouse eyes  
  
I want to lie where her eagle flies  
Shes got my love pressure on the rise  
When I see her she really rocks me with her penthouse eyes  
  
Dont need excuse for graspin  
Cant blame the boy for askin  
One look sting you like a honey bee  
But its her eyes gonna set you free  
  
I want to stretch her out in old Levis  
Got to have a little piece of paradise  
I got to have her she pins me up with her penthouse eyes  
  
Dont need excuse for graspin  
Cant blame the boy for askin  
Theres no escape let me tell you no lie  
Shes always lookin with her penthouse eyes
