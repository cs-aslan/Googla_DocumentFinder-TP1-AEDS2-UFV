Saw you layin under my car but you took it too far  
Dont you know  
Held your hand well I knew you slipped away  
Watched your eyes turn to grey in mine  
But youre still lingering  
I see it somehow  
You know what I mean dont you  
Dont you  
Say what you mean  
Ive said it so well  
Me and my own  
I still but youre damned  
My eyes are crying as you slip from my view  
I guess you know it I feel for you  
Yes I do  
Saw you layin under my car but you took it too far  
Dont you know  
Held your hand as you slipped away  
Watched your eyes turn to grey tonight  
Me Im alone  
Im just driving away from the side of you laying in death  
Goodbye before I cry  
I know you feel for me too  
And I do  
But its the end  
Goodbye my friend
