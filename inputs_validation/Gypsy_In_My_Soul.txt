Its just the gypsy in my soul  
Make me pack up my things and go  
It may seem like Im on a roll  
But its just the gypsy in my soul  
  
Layin out in the midday sun  
Tryin so hard not to run  
Looking out at the deep blue sea  
I guess its just the gypsy in me  
  
Jump on that train catch that plane  
Here and there and back again  
  
Well it seems like some kind of cruel fate  
Keep me moving in this restless state  
Sometimes it feels like I dont have any goal  
Its just the gypsy  
  
Catch that train jump on that plane  
Here and there and back again  
  
Well it seems like some kind of cruel fate  
Keep me moving moving in permanent restless state  
Seems like some days I dont have any goal  
Its just the gypsy in my soul  
  
Gypsy in my soul  
Gypsy in my soul
