Your name froze on the winter air  
An empty bench in Soho Square  
Forgotten now I turn away  
Just save me for a rainy day  
But dont be sorry  
I dont want to hear it baby  
  
My feet froze in the winter chill  
I knew Id probably get ill  
But I was praying we could fill  
An empty bench and still  
Youre so sorry  
But I dont want your pity baby  
  
Its all yours now please dont tease  
The pigeons shiver in the naked trees  
And Ill do anything but  
Please dont hurt me  
Just kiss me quick  
Cause its my birthday  
And I feel so small  
I dont know why  
But no Im not too old to cry  
  
An empty bench in Soho Square  
If youd have come youd have found me there  
But you never did cause you dont care  
And Im so sorry baby  
I dont mind loneliness too much  
But when I met you I was touched  
And that was good enough for me  
But do we always have to be sorry  
Why cant we just be happy baby  
  
One day youll be waiting there  
No empty bench in Soho Square  
And well dance around like we dont care  
And Ill be much too old to cry  
And youll kiss me quick in case I die  
Before my birthday  
  
One day youll be waiting there  
No empty bench in Soho Square  
No I dont know the reason why  
Ill love you till the day I die  
But one day youll be waiting there  
Come summertime in Soho Square  
And Ill be painting stars up in the sky  
Before I get too old to cry  
Before my birthday  
I hope I see those pigeons fly  
Before my birthday  
In Soho Square on my birthday
