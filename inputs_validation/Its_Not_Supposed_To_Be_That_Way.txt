Its not supposed to be that way youre supposed to know I love you  
But it dont matter anyway if I cant be there to control you  
And like the other little children youre gonna dream a dream or two  
But be careful what youre dreamin or soon your dreamsll be dreamin you  
Its not supposed to be that way youre supposed to know I love you  
But it dont matter anyway if I cant be there to console you  
You go out to play this evenin play with fire flies till theyre gone  
Then you rush to meet your lover play with real fire till the dawn  
Its not supposed to be that way
