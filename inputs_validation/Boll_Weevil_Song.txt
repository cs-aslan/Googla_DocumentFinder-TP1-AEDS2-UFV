Well the boll weevil and the little black bug  
Come from amexico they say  
Came all the way to texas  
Just alookin for a place to stay  
Just alookin for a home just alookin for a home  
Doodoowopwop  
Well the first time that I seen the boll weevil  
He was asittin on the square  
Well the next time that I seen him  
He had his afamily there  
Just alookin for a home just alookin for a home  
Doodoowopwop  
Well the farmer took the boll weevil  
And he put him on the red hot sand  
Well the weevil said this is amighty hot  
But I take it like a man  
This will be my home this will be my home  
  
Well the f armer took the boll weevil  
And he put him on a keg of ice  
Well the weevil said to the farmer  
This is mighty cool and nice  
This will be my home this will be my home  
Doodoowopwop  
Well if anybody should ask you  
Who it was who sang this song  
Say a guitar picker from aoklahoma city  
With a pair of blue jeans on  
Just alookin for a home just alookin for a home
