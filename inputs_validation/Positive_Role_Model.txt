Here we are  
where we were  
back on everything  
Went too far  
now were fine  
back on everything  
So much for making it day by day  
Back on everything  
Instead of taking another way  
were back on everything  
  
I want a positive role model  
I want a positive role model  
  
My reflection on the street  
Is that the way I walk  
Introspection as I speak  
I need to change the way I talk  
In a changing world  
theres so much you could be  
Why cant you choose your self  
like your enemy  
Have you ever imagined  
a new you  
I could be someone else  
Somebody new  
  
Reinvention  
my intention  
  
I want a positive role model  
I want a positive role model  
I want a positive role model  
I want a positive role model
