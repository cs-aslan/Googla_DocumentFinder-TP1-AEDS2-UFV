Theres such a sad love  
Deep in your eyes a kind of pale jewel  
Open and closed within your eyes  
Ill place the sky in your eyes  
  
Theres such a fooled heart  
Beating so fast in search of new dreams  
A love that will last within your heart  
Ill place the moon within your heart  
  
As the pain sweeps through  
Makes no sense for you  
Every thrill has gone  
Wasnt too much fun at all  
But Ill be there for you  
As the world falls down  
  
Falling  
As the world Falling down  
Falling in love  
  
Ill paint you mornings of gold  
Ill spin you Valentine evenings  
Though were strangers till now  
Were choosing the path between the stars  
Ill leave my love between the stars  
  
As the pain sweeps through  
Makes no sense for you  
Every thrill has gone  
Wasnt too much fun at all  
But Ill be there for you  
As the world falls down  
  
Falling  
As the world Falling down  
Falling  
As the world falls down  
Falling  
Falling  
Falling  
Falling in love  
As the world falls down  
Down Falling  
Falling  
Falling  
Falling in love  
As the world falls down  
  
Falling  
Falling  
Falling  
  
Makes no sense at all  
Makes no sense to fall  
Falling  
As the world falls down  
Falling  
Falling  
Falling in love  
As the world falls down  
Down Falling  
Falling  
Falling in love  
Falling in love love  
Falling in love  
Falling in love  
Falling in love
