Lady luck and a 4 leaf clover  
Wanting this hurt I feel all over  
My life was one special occasion  
Till your leavin ended the situation  
Thats why Im standin on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
Standin on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
My car got repossessed this morning  
Hardest times Ive seen in years  
Lord you got to throw me a life preserver  
Cause Im about to drown in my own tears  
Thats why Im standin on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
Standin on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down
