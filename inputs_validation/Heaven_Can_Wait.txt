Chorus  
Tell the angels no I dont want to leave my baby alone  
I dont want nobody else to hold you  
Thats a chance Ill take  
Baby Ill stay Heaven can wait  
No if the angels took me from this earth  
I would tell them bring me back to her  
Its a chance Ill take maybe Ill stay  
Heaven can wait  
  
Youre beautiful  
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful  
This love I have for you girl its incredible  
And I dont know hat Id do if I cant be with you  
The world could not go on so every night I pray  
If the Lord should come for me before I wake  
I wouldnt want to go if I cant see your face cant hold you close  
What good would Heaven be  
If the angels came for me Id tell them no  
  
Chorus  
  
Unthinkable  
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone  
The time might come around when youd be moving on  
Id turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl  
Cant stand to see nobody kissing touching her  
Couldnt take nobody loving you the way we were  
What good would Heaven be  
If the angels come for me Id tell them no  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh no cant be without my baby  
Wont go without her Id go crazy  
Oh no guess Heaven will be waiting  
Ooh  
Oh no cant be without my baby  
Wont go without her Id go crazy  
Oh no guess Heaven will be waiting  
Ooh  
  
Chorus  
  
Just leave us alone leave us alone  
Please leave us alone
