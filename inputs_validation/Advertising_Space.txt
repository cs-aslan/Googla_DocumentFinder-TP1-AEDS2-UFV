Theres no earthly way of knowing  
Whats in your heart when its stopped going  
The whole world shook  
The storm was blowing through you  
  
Waiting for god  
To stop this  
Im too young and  
And darkness  
Everyone around you was corrupted  
Say something  
  
Theres no dignity in death  
To sell the world your last breath  
Your still fighting over everything you left  
Oh  
  
I saw you standing at the gate  
When Marlon Brando passed away  
You had that look upon your face  
Advertising Space  
And no one learned from your mistakes  
The little profits go to waste  
All thats left in any case  
Is advertising space  
Oh  
  
Through your eyes the world was burning  
Please be gentle Im still learning  
He seemed to say  
As you kept turning up  
  
They poisoned you with compromise  
At what point did you realize  
Everybody loves your life  
But you  
  
A special agent for the man  
Water gates and Vietnam  
No one really gave a damn  
Do you think the CIA did  
  
I saw you standing at the gate  
When Marlon Brando passed away  
You had that look upon your face  
Advertising Space  
And no one learned from your mistakes  
The little profits go to waste  
All thats left in any case  
Is advertising space  
Oh oh  
  
And no one learned from your mistakes  
The little profits go to waste  
All thats left in any case  
Is advertising space  
Ive seen your daughter man shes cute  
I was scared but I wanted to  
Boy she looks a lot like you
