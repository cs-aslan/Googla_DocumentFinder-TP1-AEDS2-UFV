You surely must know magic girl cause you changed my life  
It was dull and ordinary  
But you made it sunny and bright  
I was blessed the day I found you gonna build my whole world around you  
Youre evrything good girl and youre all that matters to me  
  
When my way was dark and troubles were near  
Your love provided the light so I couldnt see girl  
Just knowing your love was near when times were bad  
Kept the world from closing in on me girl  
I was blessed the day I found you gonna build my whole world around you  
Youre evrything good girl and youre all that matters to me  
  
Youre part of evry thought I think each day  
Your name is in evry phrase my lips say  
Evry dream I dream is about you  
Honey I couldnt live without you  
Baby baby baby youre my evrything  
Youre my evrything  
Yes you are youre my evrything  
Girl youre the girl I sing about in evry love song I sing  
Youre my winter baby my summer my fall my spring  
I was blessed the day I found you gonna build my whole world around you  
Youre evrything good girl and youre all that matters to me  
  
Youre my evrything  
Youre my evrything  
Youre my evrything  
Youre my evrything  
  
Youre my evrything  
Youre my evrything  
Youre my evrything  
Youre my evrything
