Nowhere to run I know  
Shes got the best of me  
The deed is done Heaven knows  
She wants the rest of me  
  
Its much too late  
Im caught up in the fantasy  
Theres no escape  
My runnin days are history  
  
Gina Gina girl I surrender  
Gina Gina Im over my head  
Never been in love this way  
Never been in love this way  
  
Been on the loose so long  
Love couldnt hold me down  
The flame in you was so strong  
Girl you turned my heart around  
  
Now Im losin sleep  
Cant get you out of my head  
Think Im in too deep  
Im a slave to every word that you said  
  
Gina Gina girl I surrender  
Gina Gina Im over my head  
Gina Gina its forever  
Never been in love this way  
Never been in love this way
