As long as you hold me Ill get by  
As long as you need me I will try not to die  
I dont want the shame  
I dont want the blame  
I dont want the fame anymore  
  
If only theyd tell me tell me why  
If I could believe them and their lies  
But I dont want their name  
I dont want their pain  
I wont play their games anymore  
  
I always look at the last page of the book  
How will it end  
The suspense robs me of lovers and friends  
  
I dont want the shame  
I dont want the blame  
I dont want the fame anymore
