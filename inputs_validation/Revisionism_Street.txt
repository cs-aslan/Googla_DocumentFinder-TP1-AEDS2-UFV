I saw them standing on a corner  
Bathed in ordinary light  
They turned away and started walkin  
And faded off into the night  
Some years ago they were in fashion  
Tonight they couldnt get a seat  
Theyve got themselves a brand new history  
From Revisionism Street  
Written on Revisionism Street  
  
The years of sacrifice and struggle  
The arc of stardoms natural course  
The inevitable decline  
The wolves waiting at the door  
Lets dig up something really nasty  
Lets get some clay around their feet  
No ones memory is sacred round here  
On Revisionism Street  
  
Well never be in the arena  
Hey well never have to compete  
Well never write a classic novel  
And well never have to be discreet  
  
Alfred Hitchcock Isaac Newton  
Elvis Presley Captain Bligh  
Theyre heroic or pathetic  
Depending on which book you buy  
Charles Dickens Jackie Gleason  
Burn em all turn up the heat  
If theres no truth use innuendo  
This is Revisionism Street  
  
Lets find ourselves some old acquaintance  
Lets see what they have to say  
Some disgruntled exemployee  
Presto Payday  
  
A tree falls in the forest  
A million copies go to print  
Some parasitic little feeder  
Sits back and makes a mint  
Somewhere a babys softly sleeping  
Lts innocence complete  
Unaware theyre workin late tonight  
On Revisionism Street
