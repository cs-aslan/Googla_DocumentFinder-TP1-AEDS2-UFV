I wrote your name in dust on a truck  
As it rolled out of town  
Just in case my love for you  
Might be found  
I cried my tears in a mountain stream  
Theyll sting you one day  
I called your name in a giant cave  
It echoes to this day  
  
So sister youre hearing how I miss her  
But I dont think that shes hearing my calls  
So sister youre hearing how I miss her  
But I dont think that shes hearing my calls  
No I dont think that Im helping my cause  
  
I wrote our names on a subway wall  
Just in case you called  
I rent a room and its just for two  
But where are you  
  
So sister youre hearing how I miss her  
But I dont think that shes hearing my calls  
So sister youre hearing how I miss her  
But I dont think that shes helping my cause  
No I dont think that Im helping my cause  
No I dont think that Im helping my cause  
No I dont think that Im helping my cause  
  
So sister youre hearing how I miss her  
But I dont think that shes hearing my calls  
So sister I need to be with her  
But I dont think that shes hearing my calls  
No I dont think that Im helping my cause  
No I dont think that Im helping my cause
