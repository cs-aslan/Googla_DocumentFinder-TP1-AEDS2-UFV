Tossed into my mind stirring the calm  
You splash me with beauty and pull me down  
You come from out of nowhere  
My glance turns to a stare  
Obsession rules me Im yours from the start  
I know you see me our eyes interlock  
You come from out of nowhere  
My glance turns to a stare  
One minute here and one minute there  
Dont know if Ill laugh or cry  
One minute here and one minute there  
And then you wave goodbye  
Sifting to the bottom every day for two  
All energy funnels all becomes you  
You come from out of nowhere  
My glance turns to a stare  
One minute here and one minute there  
Dont know if Ill laugh or cry  
One minute here and one minute there  
And it hurts inside  
One minute here and one minute there  
And then you wave goodbye
