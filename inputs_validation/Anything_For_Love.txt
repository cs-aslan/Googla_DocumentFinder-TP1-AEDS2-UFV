In my life  
In my time and in each line Ive ever sung  
And in my life  
Was it my imagination or are you still the one  
Who lingers on  
Id do anything for you  
Youd do anything for me  
Wed do anything for love  
Ohh youd use any means  
And I would try any scheme for love  
Wed do anything for love  
Once or twice  
In my loneliness I watched the world go by  
There was I  
One too many miles beyond where you might say  
Some luck was due after all  
We could have touched the sky  
You had no alibi because  
Wed do anything for love  
Ohh I would try any means  
To have you in all my dreams because  
Youd do anything for love  
Not long ago as I remember  
Once upon a dark and windy day  
When love looked like a dying ember  
Before you came to call  
The beauty of it all I though Id lost and yet  
Cause in my life  
There in my mind in it now shines  
A guiding light  
Never again will I lose my way  
Ohh I would not tell a lie and  
You had no alibi because  
Wed do anything for love  
Ohh youd use any means  
And I would try any scheme for love  
Simply anything for love  
Ohh I would do anything  
Just about anything because  
Wed do anything for love  
Anything for love  
Anything for love  
Anything for love
