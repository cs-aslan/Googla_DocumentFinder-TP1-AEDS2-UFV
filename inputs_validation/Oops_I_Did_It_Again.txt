Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
I think I did it again  
I made you believe were more than just friends  
Oh baby  
It might seem like a crush  
But it doesnt mean that Im serious  
Cause to lose all my senses  
That is just so typically me  
Oh baby baby  
  
Chorus  
Oops I did it again  
I played with your heart got lost in the game  
Oh baby baby  
Oops You think Im in love  
That Im sent from above  
Im not that innocent  
  
You see my problem is this  
Im dreaming away  
Wishing that heroes they truly exist  
I cry watching the days  
Cant you see Im a fool in so many ways  
But to lose all my senses  
That is just so typically me  
Baby oh  
  
Chorus  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
All aboard  
Britney before you go theres something I want you to have  
Oh its beautiful but wait a minute isnt this  
Yeah yes it is  
But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end  
Well baby I went down and got it for you  
Oh you shouldnt have  
  
Oops I did it again to your heart  
Got lost in this game oh baby  
Oops You think that Im sent from above  
Im not that innocent
