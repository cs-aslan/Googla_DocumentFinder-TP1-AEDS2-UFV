Three more days and then Ill see  
The people who depend on me  
Three more days and Im home  
  
Not long now until I step inside  
The place where we all reside  
Three more days and Im home  
  
And lifes rolled on and on  
The whole time Ive been gone  
  
I walk around today feeling right  
I dreamt about each one of them last night  
Three more days and Im home  
  
And lifes rolled on and on  
The whole time Ive been gone  
  
When I close my eyes I can see  
The faces of my family  
Three more days and Im home  
  
Everything that I hold dear  
Lies five thousand miles from here  
Three more days and Im home  
Three more days and Im home
