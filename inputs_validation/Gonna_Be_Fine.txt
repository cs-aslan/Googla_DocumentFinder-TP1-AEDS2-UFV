Cant believe you would leave me this way  
Feelin kinda bad from the last things we said today  
Cant believe you would turn and walk away  
You know we do this again and again  
  
pre chorus You say you love me  
I come back with I hate you  
Only takes me a day to  
Realize Im in love with you  
You say its over  
I come back with just stay boy  
If you dont want my love  
Then I have no choice this time  
  
chorusTell me baby what to do  
I aint trippin over you  
Any any other time  
Remember Im gone be fine  
How cant I make mistakes  
I dunno whats up with you  
Any any other time  
Remember Im gone be fine  
  
Said you didnt mean it thats fine  
You wanna take it back cause youre  
Having a change of mind  
Sometimes sayin sorry wont do  
But then some days I just cant do with out you  
Pre chorus 3x

RapOutkast  
Yo yo  
Across the way  
The milkman delivered this  
Everyday on schedule  
Aint good use to cry over spilled lactose  
When you got these vegetables  
The four food groups  
Aint nothing but  
Four ways to keep four families paid  
Oprah went from one line to  
Telling yall silly ass rock upstate  
  
Yeah  
So for one girl  
When I met you  
Ima say this  
Yous was fine  
You traveled around the block  
I let you drive the Lac one time  
Maybe your hearts at stake  
Some of the people around  
You act of fate  
Cuz you cant  
Cake up wake up  
Picture make up  
Straight up like that  
  
Chorus three times fading
