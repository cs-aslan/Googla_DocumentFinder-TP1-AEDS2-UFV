When the twilight hour is sparkling  
And the citys all aglow  
Come with me my darling  
To the place we love to go  
When the frosts upon the window  
Theres a tingle in your toes  
To the fields of virgin white  
For angels in the snow  
Lying on the frozen ground  
Arms go up and legs go down  
How it looks so perfect I dont know  
With the snowflakes all around  
It feels like heavens reaching down  
To tell us here on earth were not alone  
As the rooftops glisten  
And your cheeks turn to rose  
We will lie in wonder making angels in the snow  
With the snowflakes all around  
It feels like heavens reaching down  
Telling us that we are not alone  
The silver moon is shining  
On the winter world below  
How shell smile to see us  
Waving our hellos  
And as each season passes  
I will watch as your wings grow  
Ill always think of you this way  
My angel in the snow
