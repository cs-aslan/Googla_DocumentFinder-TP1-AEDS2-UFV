Hi there  
Should Ive asked you whats your name  
Should youve asked me the same  
But dig  
Lets not be wasting our time  
Lets not lead each other blind  
If you dont want me  
My heart cant strain yeah another time  
  
Theres only twenty four hours in a day  
And that dont leave much time to play  
I dont dig that no way honey  
Coz my heart cant take it no another day  
Listen to me honey  
  
Ive been told by many different girls  
Otis I love you oh boy  
They tell me this from the bottom of their soul  
But they didnt mean it  
Listen I  
  
Ive been let down yo  
Hit the ground  
And called the biggest the biggest fool  
Biggest fool ever walked on this ground  
Listen  
  
I cant stand it no no no no  
To be built up way on up and let down  
Being loved yo is home in my mind  
I dont like that  
I like for it to be from the heart  
  
And I found out later on I was wasting my time  
Just a waste of time yeah  
  
Somebody understand what Im saying  
What I say  
Its just a waste of time  
  
If you dont want me mama  
Dont just leave me hanging  
Dont just let me waste my time no no  
  
Somebody  
Somebody gotta get the message to me  
No I dont wanna
