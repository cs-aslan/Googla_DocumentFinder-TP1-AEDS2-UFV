I hope that gleam that you have in your eye  
Is reflection from the buttons on your blouse  
If its not then were in trouble I can tell you why  
Im old enough to want to and fool enough to try  
  
They dont make women like you anymore  
And since theres not enough to go around  
If you think what I think youre thinking this is what I think  
Id be a crazy fool to turn you down  
  
I hope that smile that you have on your lips  
Is just a smile that you wear all the time  
If its something special then start making up your line  
Im old enough to want to and fool enough to try  
  
Im old enough to want to and fool enough to try
