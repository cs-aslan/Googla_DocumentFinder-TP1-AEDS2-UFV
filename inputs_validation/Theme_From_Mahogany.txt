1  Do you know where youre going to  
Do you like the things that lifes been showing you  
Where are you going to  
Do you know  
  
2  Do you get  
What youre hoping for  
When you look behind you  
Theres no open door  
What are you hoping for  
Do you know  
  
Once we were standing still in time  
Chasing the fantasies  
That filled our minds  
You knew how I loved you  
But my spirit was free  
Laughing at the questions  
That you once asked of me  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Now looking back at all weve planned  
We let so many dreams  
Just slip through our hands  
Why must we wait so long  
Before well see  
How sad the answers  
To those questions can be  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Repeat 2  
Repeat 1 till fade
