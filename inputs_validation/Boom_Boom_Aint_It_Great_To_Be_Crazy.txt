A horse and a flea and three blind mice  
Sat on a curbstone shooting dice  
The horse he slipped and fell on the flea  
Whoops said the flea Theres a horse on me  
  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
Giddy and foolish the whole day through  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
  
Way down South where bananas grow  
A flea stepped on an elephants toe  
The elephant cried with tears in his eyes  
Why dont you pick on someone your own size  
  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
Giddy and foolish the whole day through  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
  
Way up North where theres ice and snow  
There lived a penguin and his name was Joe  
He got so tired of black and white  
He wore pink slacks to the dance last night  
  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
Giddy and foolish the whole day through  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
  
Eli Eli had some socks  
A dollar a pair and a nickel a box  
The more you wear em the better they get  
And you put em in the water and they dont get wet  
  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
Giddy and foolish the whole day through  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
  
Called myself on the telephone  
Just to hear that golden tone  
Asked myself out for a date  
Said be ready bout halfpast eight  
  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
Giddy and foolish the whole day through  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
  
Took myself to the picture show  
Sat myself on the very last row  
Wrapped my arms around my waist  
Got so fresh I slapped my face  
  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy  
Giddy and foolish the whole day through  
Boom boom aint it great to be crazy
