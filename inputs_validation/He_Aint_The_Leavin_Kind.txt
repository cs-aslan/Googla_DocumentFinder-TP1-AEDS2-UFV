They tried their best to drag him out  
Of a courthouse down in Montgomery  
And now they wanna kick him out of school  
And take him off our money  
They can take those words off of paper and stone  
But he aint gone no  
  
Chorus  
He aint the leavin kind  
Hed never walk away  
Even from those who dont believe  
And wanna leave him behind  
He aint the leavin kind  
  
She stayed mad at him for a lot of years  
For takin her husband  
Started losin her faith and thinkin that her life meant nothin  
But when she looks at those kids she raised all by herself  
She knows she had some help yeah she knows  
  
Chorus  
  
No matter what you do  
No matter where you go  
Hes always right there with you  
  
Even from those you dont believe  
And wanna leave him behind  
He aint the leavin kind  
No no  
  
He aint the leavin  
He aint the leavin kind  
He aint the leavin  
He aint the leavin  
  
He aint the leavin kind  
He aint the leavin kind  
He aint the leavin  
He aint the leavin kind  
He aint the leavin kind
