I know youre out there somewhere  
Somewhere somewhere  
I know Ill find you somehow  
And somehow Ill return again to you  
The mist is lifting slowly  
I can see the way ahead  
And Ive left behind the empty streets  
That once inspired my life  
And the strength of the emotion  
Is like thunder in the air  
Cause the promise that we made each other  
Haunts me to the end  
I know youre out there somewhere  
Somewhere somewhere  
I know youre out there somewhere  
Somewhere you can hear my voice  
I know Ill find you somehow  
Somehow somehow  
I know Ill find you somehow  
And somehow Ill return again to you  
The secret of your beauty and the mystery of your soul  
Ive been searching for in everyone I meet  
And the times Ive been mistaken its impossible to say  
And the grass is growing underneath our feet  
I know youre out there somewhere  
Somewhere somewhere  
I know youre out there somewhere  
Somewhere you can hear my voice  
I know Ill find you somehow  
Somehow somehow  
I know Ill find you somehow  
And somehow Ill return again to you  
I know youre out there somewhere  
Yes I know youre out there somewhere  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yes I know its going to happen  
I can feel you getting near  
And soon well be returning  
To the fountain of our youth  
And if you wake up wondering  
In the darkness Ill be there  
My arms will close around you  
And protect you with the truth  
I know youre out there somewhere  
Somewhere somewhere  
I know youre out there somewhere  
Somewhere you can hear my voice  
I know Ill find you somehow  
Somehow somehow  
I know Ill find you somehow  
And somehow Ill return again to you
