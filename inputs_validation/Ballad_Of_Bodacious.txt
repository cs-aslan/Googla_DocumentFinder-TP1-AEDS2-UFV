Bodacious am a whole lotta bull  
Over nineteen hundred pounds  
Hes born in Galry Oklahoma  
And hes the baddest sonsabitch around  
If a Burma bull ever were a super star  
Then Bodacious just might be  
Hes a cream colored beefy brawn  
Fullfledged four footed bovine celebrity  
Whos gonna ride Bodacious  
Whos gonna tame him down  
Look out for Bodacious  
Hes bound to hold his ground  
Here comes Bodacious  
Yall just step aside  
Big and bad Bodacious  
Takes a toll from those who ride  
Young Bo met a man named Tuff Hedeman  
At the start of his buckin spree  
And Tuff became one of the few to make the whistle  
Back in Nineteen Ninety Three  
Tuff tried to ride Bo again at the finals  
In Nineteen Ninety Five  
Bodacious had got a little older and wiser  
Tuff barely came out alive
