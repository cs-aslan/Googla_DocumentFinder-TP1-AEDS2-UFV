Well I know theres a reason  
And I know theres a rhyme  
We were meant to be together  
And thats why  
We can roll with the punches  
We can stroll hand in hand  
And when I say its forever  
You understand  
  
Chorus  
That youre always in my heart  
Youre always on my mind  
But when it all becomes too much  
Youre never far behind  
And theres no one that comes close to you  
Could ever take your place  
Cause only you can love me this way  
  
I could have turned a different corner  
I could have gone another place  
Then Id of never had this feeling  
That I feel today yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh  
  
Only you can love me this way
