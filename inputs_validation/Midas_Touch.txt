You say youre going through changes  
Every day it seems your life is up and down  
And you say that youre looking for an answer  
Everywhere you look it seems you cant be found  
  
Like searching trying to find the rainbow  
No ones ever found it yet its told to be  
But if youre looking for a lover  
Everything you need yeah you can find right here with me  
  
Ive got the Midas touch  
Everything I touch turns to gold oh sugar  
Ive got the Midas touch  
Baby let me touch your body and your soul  
  
Ive got the Midas touch  
Everything I touch turns to gold oh sugar  
Ive got the Midas touch  
Baby let me touch your body and your soul  
  
Now youve been trapped by love  
Someone takes your heart and then says goodbye  
So you say that youll never love another  
Tired of playing games and thats the reason why  
  
But now whenever were together  
Theres a certain feeling that we both agree  
And its time that youve opened up to love  
Cause if you dont ever try then baby you may never see  
  
Ive got the Midas Touch  
Everything I touch turns to gold oh sugar  
Ive got the Midas Touch  
Baby let me touch your body and your soul  
  
Ive got the Midas Touch  
Everything I touch turns to gold oh sugar  
Ive got the Midas Touch  
Baby let me touch your body and your soul  
  
Together you and I were meant to be  
Ill be right beside whenever you need me  
This love we have will never fade away  
You can count on me cause Im here to stay yeah  
  
Ive got the Midas Touch  
Everything I touch turns to gold oh sugar  
Ive got the Midas Touch  
Baby let me touch your body and your soul  
  
Ive got the Midas Touch  
Everything I touch turns to gold oh sugar  
Ive got the Midas Touch  
Baby let me touch your body and your soul
