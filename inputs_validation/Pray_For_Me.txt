Here is where the road divides  
Here is where we realize  
The sculpting of the Fathers great design  
Through time youve been a friend to me  
But time is now the enemy  
I wish we didnt have to say goodbye  
But I know the road He chose for me  
Is not the road he chose for you  
So as we chase the dreams were after  
  
Chorus  
Pray for me and Ill pray for you  
Pray that we will keep the common ground  
Wont you pray for me and Ill pray for you  
And one day love will bring us back around again  
  
Painted on our tapestry  
We see the way it has to be  
Weaving through the laughter and the tears  
But love will be the tie that binds us  
To the time we leave behind us  
Memories will be our souvenirs  
And I know that through it all  
The hardest part of love is letting go  
But theres a greater love that holds us  
  
Chorus
