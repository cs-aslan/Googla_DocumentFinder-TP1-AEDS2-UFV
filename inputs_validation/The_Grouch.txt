I was a young boy that had big plans  
Now Im just another shitty old man  
I dont have fun and I hate everything  
The world owes me so fuck you  
Glory days dont  
Mean shit to me  
I drank a six pack of apathy  
Lifes a bitch and so am I  
The world owes me so fuck you  
Wasted youth and a fistful of ideals  
I had a young and optimistic point of view  
Wasted youth and a fistful of ideals  
I had a young and optimistic point of view  
Ive decomposed yet my guts getting fat  
Oh my god Im turning out like my dad  
Im always rude  
Ive got a bad attitude  
The world owes me so fuck you  
The wifes a nag and the kids fucking up  
I dont have sex cause I cant get it up  
Im just a grouch sitting on the couch  
The world owes me so fuck you
