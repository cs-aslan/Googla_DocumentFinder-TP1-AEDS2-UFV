Last night I met a woman  
Youll recognize her name  
Who in our conversation  
Told me you were her old flame  
Well I didnt want to listen  
But as she told me more  
I learned more about you  
Than I ever knew before  
  
CHORUS  
Youre keepin too many secrets from me  
But baby now Im wise to you  
Youll fool me like the others  
And I know what youll do  
Youll find yourself a new love  
And keep me a secret too  
  
Well I walked up to a counter  
To buy some cigarettes  
And standin there beside me  
Was a gal Id never met  
She pulled out her wallet  
And much to my surprise  
There she held your picture baby  
Right before my eyes  
  
REPEAT CHORUS 2x  
  
Youll find yourself a new love  
And keep me a secret too
