Youve got a face for a smile you know  
A shame you waste it  
When youre breaking me slowly but Ive  
  
Got a world of chances for you  
Ive got a world of chances for you  
Ive got a world of chances  
Chances that youre burning through  
  
Ive got a paper and pen  
I go to write a goodbye  
And thats when I know Ive  
  
Got a world of chances for you  
Ive got a world of chances for you  
Ive got a world of chances  
Chances that youre burning through  
  
Oh Im going my own way  
My faith has lost its strength again  
And oh Its been too hard to say  
Were falling off the edge again  
  
Were at an end  
Were at an end  
  
Maybe youll call me someday  
Hear the operator say the numbers no good  
And that she had  
  
A world of chances for you  
She had a world of chances for you  
She had a world of chances  
Chances you were burning through  
Chances you were burning through  
Chances you were burning through oh  
  
Youve got a face for a smile you know
