Youre a grown woman  
Good at what you do  
Im happy as hell  
When Im alone whit you  
As you stroke my body  
And soothe my brow  
With everything  
That the law will allow  
I pray Dont turn out like your mother  
  
repeat  
  
Im a grown man  
Over 21  
Ive got an ugly face  
But I have a lot of fun  
So if spill a glass  
Or break a dish  
I hear your voice  
And I make this wish  
Please Dont turn out like your mother  
  
Dont turn out  
Dont turn out  
Dont turn out like your mother  
I couldnt stand it  
And Ill be damned if  
Im gonna live with another  
  
So many woman  
Give you so much  
Civilized ways  
And a gentle touch  
A different perspective  
Thats as bright as a button  
But then you wake up one morning  
And it all counts for nothing  
Cos shes turned into her mother  
  
Dont turn out  
Dont turn out  
Dont turn out like your mother  
I couldnt stand it  
And Ill be damned if  
Im gonna live with another  
  
Its not the way she looks  
Its not the food she cooks  
Her kind of indignation  
Dont cause me trepidation  
But to live with a woman like this  
Would take a masochist  
Or someone who could get and could stay permanently pissed  
  
repeat  
  
Youre a grown woman  
Good at what you do  
Im happy as hell  
When Im alone with you  
As you stroke my body  
And soothe my brow  
With everything  
That the law will allow  
  
Im a grown man  
Over 21  
Ive got an ugly face  
But I have a lot of fun  
So if spill a glass  
Or break a dish  
Dont get on to me  
Like some haranguing witch  
  
Dont turn out like your mother  
Dont turn out  
Dont turn out  
Dont turn out like your mother  
I couldnt stand it  
And Ill be damned if  
Im gonna live with another  
  
Its not her looks  
Or the way she cooks  
That wakes me up in a cold sweat  
Its just the knowledge  
That if it happened  
I couldnt drink enough to forget  
  
Dont turn out etc  
Dont end up etc
