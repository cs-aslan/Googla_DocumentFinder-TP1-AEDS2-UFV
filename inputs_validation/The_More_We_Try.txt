Some lessons are forever  
Never need to change  
Write and the word is written  
Then we turn the page  
Some lessons take forever  
Time and time again  
Caught in a battle that you cant surrender  
And can never win  
You tried to make me the boy of your dreams  
Ones that you never could find  
You thought you saw your face in mine  
The more we try  
The more we just get lonely  
Though youve shown me how  
The things you say are true  
The lesson learned is no concern  
If you dont even know me  
To need love is all  
I really learned from you  
The more we try  
The more we just get lonely  
Though youve shown me how  
The things you say are true  
The lessons learned are no concern  
Cause you dont even know me  
Sure youve done what you can do  
But when all our time is through  
To be loved is all I ever needed of you
