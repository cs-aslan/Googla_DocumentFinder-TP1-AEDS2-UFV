Any way you can feel it  
You shouldnt try to conceal it baby  
You got to make up your mind  
Any way I can steal it  
Any way you can deal it to me  
You know the pleasures all mine  
You gotta love it  
You better own it  
You gotta love it  
And god knows it  
You gutta shu uh shove it  
Im gonna make things happen  
Goin round n round n round  
Thats right  
I wanna say youre a firecracker  
I wanna say youre a switchblade knife  
You make your sex a career  
Comin down from an all night tripper  
Pull your foot from the ruby slipper  
Cause you cant get it from here  
You gotta love it  
You better own it  
You gotta love it  
And god knows it  
You gutta shu uh shove it  
Im gonna make things happen  
Goin round n round n round  
Goin round n round n round n round  
I got this feeling deep inside my love  
Overwhelming feeling but I know not what  
One things for sure I aint got time for those  
Who cant relate  
You gotta learn to love the midnight madness  
You gotta revel in the good and badness  
If yin n yang is your thing  
What I gotta do to try and reach ya  
Is it for real or just a double feature  
So lets go throw the I ching  
You gotta love it  
You better own it  
You gotta love it  
And god knows it  
You gutta shu uh shove it  
Im gonna make things happen  
Goin round n round n round
