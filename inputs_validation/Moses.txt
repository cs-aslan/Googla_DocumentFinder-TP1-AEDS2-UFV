Diamonds roses I need Moses  
To cross this sea of loneliness  
Part this red river of pain  
I dont necessarily buy  
Any key to the future or happiness  
But I need a little place in the sun sometimes  
Or I think Ill die  
  
And everywhere is somewhere but nowhere is near  
Everybodys got somebody with their wine and their beer  
But Im a tragic figure in the corner over here  
With an empty apartment and a best friend who is queer Heh  
  
Every time I see him he smiles  
And tells me how well hes walking these miles  
But he never ever asks a single thing about me  
If I died hed hear about it eventually  
Diamonds roses I need Moses  
To cross this sea of loneliness  
Part this red river of pain Ohhh  
  
Cause everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near  
Everybodys got somebody with their wine and their beer  
And Im a tragic figure in the corner over here  
With my bills in the mailbox and some checks that wont clear this year  
  
Everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near  
Everybodys got somebody with their wine and their beer  
So Im just a tragic figure in the corner over here  
Wholl sleep it off til morning and still not know that were  
  
Were all just diamonds and roses I need Moses  
To cross this sea of loneliness part this red river of pain  
To cross this sea of loneliness part this red river of pain  
To cross this sea of loneliness part this red river of pain
