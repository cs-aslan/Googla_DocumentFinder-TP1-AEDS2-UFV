Before you read the lyrics they arent puff daddys they are wayne wonders but
I didnt no how to get on to do it so I put them here  
  
Got somebody shes a beauty  
Very special really and truly  
Take good care of me like its her duty  
Want you right by my side night and day  
  
No lettting go No holding back  
Because you are my lady  
When Im with you its all a that  
Girl I am so glad weve dated  
No letting go No holding back  
No holding Back no  
When Im with you its all a that  
All a that  
  
They say good things must come to an end  
But Im optimistic about being your friend  
Though I made you cry by my doings  
With Keisha and Annesha but that  
Was back then  
  
No lettting go No holding back  
Because you are my lady  
When Im with you its all a that  
Girl I am so glad weve dated  
No letting go No holding back  
No holding Back no  
When Im with you its all a that  
All a that  
  
Really appreciate you loving me  
After all that weve been thru  
Really appreciate you loving me  
All times time  
  
Got somebody shes a beauty  
Very special really and truly  
Take good care of me like its her duty  
Want you right by my side night and day  
  
No lettting go No holding back  
Because you are my lady  
When Im with you its all a that  
Girl I am so glad weve dated  
No letting go No holding back  
No holding Back no  
When Im with you its all a that  
All a that
