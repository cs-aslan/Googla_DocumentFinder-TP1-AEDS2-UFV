Beat up soul  
Looking to find a smile  
Aint nobody here to give you the reason why  
I need the wings of an angel  
Need to find me a way to fly  
  
Come on and dance with me baby  
Dancing my blues away  
Yeah dance with me baby  
Dance til my blues cant stay  
Come on and dance with me baby  
Dancing my blues away  
  
There is something worth knowing  
Written behind those eyes  
Well Ive got tears by the truckload  
Lets laugh til they all run dry  
Lets steal the wings from those angels  
And kiss what we know goodbye  
  
Come on and dance with me baby  
Dancing my blues away  
Yeah dance with me baby  
Dance til my blues cant stay  
Come on and dance with me baby  
Dancing my blues away
