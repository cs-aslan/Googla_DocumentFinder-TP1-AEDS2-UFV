I got blood in my gas tank  
Bones in my steel  
I eat California condor for my Thanksgiving meal  
Im the last superpower  
  
Im the son of a loaded gun  
Im Rapscallion  
When I was young and shiny boy  
I tried to dig my way to China  
  
I met the Rapscallion  
En route from South Carolina  
Then he told me I dont like  
I dont like you  
  
He said Im searching for a colored man  
I said what colors have you seen  
He said I seenem black and brown and red  
But but but the one I seek is green  
  
Then he told me I dont like  
I dont like you  
Im Rapscallion
