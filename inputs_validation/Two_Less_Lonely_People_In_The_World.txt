I was down my dreams were wearing thin  
When youre lost where do you begin  
My heart always seemed to drift from day to day  
Looking for the love that never came my way  
  
Then you smiled and I reached out to you  
I could tell you were lonely too  
One look and then it all began for you and me  
The moment that we touched I knew that there would be  
  
Two less lonely people in the world  
And its gonna be fine  
Out of all the people in the world  
I just cant believe youre mine  
In my life where everything was wrong  
Something finally went right  
Now theres two less lonely people  
In the world tonight  
  
Just to think what I might have missed  
Looking back how did I exist  
I dreamed still I never thought Id come this far  
But miracles come true I know cause here we are  
  
Two less lonely people in the world  
And its gonna be fine  
Out of all the people in the world  
I just cant believe youre mine  
In my life where everything was wrong  
Something finally went right  
Now theres two less lonely people  
In the world tonight  
  
Tonight I fell in love with you  
And all the things I never knew  
Seemed to come to me somehow  
Baby love is here and now theres  
  
Two less lonely people in the world  
And its gonna be fine  
Out of all the people in the world  
I just cant believe youre mine  
In my life where everything was wrong  
Something finally went right  
Now theres two less lonely people  
In the world tonight
