Im a cowboy too I got to wear loafer shoes  
I have to wear a tie and when I wear my hat it makes the baby cry  
Im a station wagon champ Im the king of summer camps  
I love what I do but Im a cowboy too  
I cant go out at night get into barroom fights  
If I ever lost my cool theyd make me tell it all in Sunday school  
Well my horse wouldnt feel at home my neighborhood is zoned  
Some say it aint true but Im a cowboy too  
Im a cowboy too hey you oughta taste my barbecue  
If you ever heard me pickin guitar well you would exclaim he oughta be a star  
Im in love with my wife Im in love with my life  
I sometimes get the blues cause Im a cowboy too  
I could drive a pickup truck if I had six thousand bucks  
I had cowboy boots before but they left marks on the kitchen floor  
I get in trouble wearin a hat and the beer just makes me fat  
Well my kids are buckaroos and Im a cowboy too  
Im a country music fan I buy every tape I can  
The man down where I work said a beard and the hair make me look like a jerk  
Well my wife dont understand shes a Willie and Waylon fan  
I got some people fooled oh but Im a cowboy too
