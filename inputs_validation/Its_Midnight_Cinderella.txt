Its midnight Cinderella  
But dont you worry none  
Cause Im Peter Peter the Pumpkin Eater  
And the party has just begun  
  
I guess youre prince charming  
Wasnt after all  
Cause he sure seemed different right after the ball  
I guess that more than horses  
Are turnin into rats  
And by the way hes walkin  
I can guess where your slippers at  
  
Chorus  
Its midnight Cinderella  
Time that you should know  
Theres gonna be some changes in the way this story goes  
Its midnight Cinderella  
But dont you worry none  
Cause Im Peter Peter the pumpkin eater  
And the party has just begun  
  
Im gonna help you get over  
Bein under that spell  
Youre gonna learn to love midnight  
Inside this pumpkin shell  
I gotta few new magic tricks  
Your Godmother cant do  
And Ill show you want it means to bip bip bip bip boppity boo hoo  
  
Chorus
