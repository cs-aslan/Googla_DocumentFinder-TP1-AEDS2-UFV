Hey hey hey hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey  
  
Its your bed that we sleep in  
Its your smile up on the wall  
Its your night its your weekend  
And when its over its your call  
Your rain your sky your sunshine in my eyes  
Your end your beginning  
Its your world Im just living in it  
  
You leave your mark on everything that you touch  
Youre painting my heart with your calico brush  
The air that I breathe the water I drink the dirt beneath my feet  
No matter how you spin it  
Its your world baby Im just living in it  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey  
  
Im holding on for dear life  
For just one more time around  
Hoping that you might drop by  
The next time you pass through my town  
Your lows your highs I hang on your goodbyes  
Every second every minute  
Its your world baby Im just living in it  
  
You leave your mark on everything that you touch  
Youre painting my heart with your calico brush  
The air that I breathe the water I drink the dirt beneath my feet  
No matter how you spin it  
Its your world baby Im just living in it  
  
Cause I know its turning without me  
And it aint all about me  
Its all about you  
  
You leave your mark on everything that you touch  
Youre painting my heart with your calico brush  
The air that I breathe the water I drink the dirt beneath my feet  
  
You leave your mark on everything that you touch  
Youre painting my heart with your calico brush  
The air that I breathe the water I drink the dirt beneath my feet  
No matter how you spin it  
Its your world baby Im just living in it  
Im just a map dot on your planet  
Its your world baby Im just living in it
