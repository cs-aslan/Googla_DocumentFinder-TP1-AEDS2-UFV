Tell a little white lie  
And then multiply by ten  
And then thats how a heartache begins  
Mix some flowers he bought  
  
With a date he forgot to attend  
And then thats how a heartache begins  
I know about heartaches  
I know all the mistakes  
  
That a young love can make Ive made them  
So lets still be friends  
To the soft violins  
Ive listened while somebody played them  
  
Call his number in vain  
Again and again hes not in  
But then thats how a heartache begins  
Repeat last two verses  
Thats how a heartache begins
