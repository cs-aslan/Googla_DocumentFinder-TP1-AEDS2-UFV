Verse 1  
She said I know I know I know your music  
I prefer your old shit to your new shit  
That song with Pitbull it was kinda cool  
But after that you went left and I couldnt fuck with you  
Well damn couldnt help but appreciate  
That she was bold enough to say this to my face  
She even went as far to give me her Twitter name  
She said I tweeted you and told you the same thing  
But she said I never thought Id meet  
And you cuter in real life than on TV  
You a celebrity  
You could have any girl you want what the hell you want with me  
  
Chorus  
I told her Baby there is a difference  
Between what you really want and what you can get  
I can have anything but I dont want just anything  
I want you tonight I want you  
  
Verse 2  
I said You got you got you got me twisted  
What my celebrity got to do with it  
Just cause I can have dont mean I want them chicks  
I take quality over quantity any day you dig  
She said Im hood though NeYo  
And I know you be on your goody good though NeYo  
Get ratchet yes I could though NeYo  
Mess up your image I probably would though NeYo  
I said You dont scare me  
The word gentleman starts with G  
She said You a celebrity  
You could have any girl you want what you want with me  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
Now that she sat there lookin at me like she wasnt sure  
Questionin my intentions why and what for  
Thinkin He can have actresses singers or models galore  
I work in a nail shop every day in that bitch from 8 until 4  
Shawtys a rose that grows through the cracks in the concrete  
Her mothers body but her brothers knowledge of the street  
Kick all you beautiful lies shawty aint goin for em  
She type stubborn like her daddy but she dont know him  
Got me feelin like I aint good enough  
I aint a Dboy or a thug so I aint hood enough  
Or maybe its the other way around and shawtys self esteem is down  
Not good enough to wife but good enough to fuck nah mama  
Im really tryna get to know  
Whats under your garden not just whats under your clothes  
You feel me  
And dont concern yourself with status I dont  
It aint about what I can have its about what I want you dig  
  
Chorus
