Chorus  
Look what theyve done to my song Ma  
Look what theyve done to my song  
Well its the only thing I could do half right  
And its turning out all wrong Ma  
Look what theyve done to my song  
  
Chorus  
Look what theyve done to my brain Ma  
Look what theyve done to my brain  
Yeah they picked it like a chicken bone  
And they think Im half insane Ma  
Look what theyve done to my brain  
  
Verse  
Wish I could find a book to live in  
Wish I could find a good book  
Cause if I could find a real good book  
Id never have to come out and look at  
Look what theyve done to my song  
  
Na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na  
And if people are buying tears  
Will be rich someday Ma  
Look what theyve done to my brain  
  
But maybe Ill be alright Ma  
Yeah maybe Ill be okay  
Cause if the people are buying tears  
Then well be rich someday Ma  
Look what theyve done to my song  
  
Chorus  
Look what theyve done to my soul Ma  
Look what theyve done to my soul  
Yeah they tied it in a plastic bag  
And they shook me upside down Ma  
Look what theyve done to my song  
  
Outro  
Look what theyve done to my soul
