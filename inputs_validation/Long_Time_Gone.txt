Out on the lonesome highway  
Suitcase and an old guitar  
Just outside Oklahoma City  
Place called Johnnys Roadside Bar  
  
Having fun son of a gun  
I aint fit to be tied  
Im on my way back to Georgia  
Wont you give me a ride  
  
Sometimes it at easy  
When you dont have much to spare  
Traveling light Lord counting on my fifth  
But the little bit hear and there  
  
Shes got the prettiest big brown eyes  
When shes satisfied  
But Im on way back to Georgia boys  
Wont you give me a ride  
  
Im a long time gone  
On my way back home Lord  
Long time gone gone  
  
Im a long time gone  
On my way back home Lord  
Long time gone gone  
  
Im a long time gone  
On my way back home Lord  
Long time gone gone
