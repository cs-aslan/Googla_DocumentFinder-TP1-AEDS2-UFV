I watched the stars oh one by one  
Why you left me so alone  
Oh why oh why you break my heart  
I watched the stars I think of you  
Oh Im just the biggest fool  
Oh why I let you break apart  
Oh why oh why you break my heart  
  
It hurts so good to be in love  
You are the girl Im living for  
It hurts so good to be in love  
Oh I need you more and more  
It hurts so good youre in my heart  
I love you more and more each day  
It hurts so good lets try a start  
Oh baby come what may  
You are with me where I belong  
My heart cant get enough  
  
Whats good for me is good for you  
Oh Ill never make you blue  
Oh why oh why you break my heart  
From coast to coast and sky to sky  
Oh there is no reason why  
Oh why I let you break apart  
Oh why oh why you break my heart
