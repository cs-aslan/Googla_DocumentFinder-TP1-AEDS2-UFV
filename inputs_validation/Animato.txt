Somebody out there better get this  
Not many people can do it like this  
How about some speakers to amplify me  
How about a rhyme to fortify me  
Lifes messy so I clarify it  
Simplifying things for everybody  
  
I need someone whos true  
Someone who does the laundry too  
So what you gonna do  
Please dont forget to followthrough  
I take my diamond shoes  
Someone who tries to be on time  
Do what you said youll do  
I hope you like to followthrough  
  
All that I needs a bit o practice  
My mind is set on bigger business  
This is not a time for reminiscing  
This is something new and interesting  
Why are you trying to classify it  
This is music for all humanity from me  
  
Dreaming of hip hop tunes  
They say youve got the proper tools  
So what you gonna do  
Keep doing things the way you do  
I take my diamond shoes  
Someone who tries to be on time  
Do what you came to do  
I came to see you followthrough  
  
I need someone whos true  
Someone who does the laundry too  
So what you gonna do  
Please dont forget to followthrough  
I take my diamond shoes  
Someone who tries to be on time  
Do what you said youll do  
I hope you like to followthrough
