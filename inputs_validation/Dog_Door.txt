Oh mother I want a dog  
I want a little dog  
I saw a little dog  
His name is happy  
  
Well this is me  
Dont get close to me now  
I could be a shopkeeper  
Well call em  
  
She bout six foot four  
Now shes a wreckingball  
Back over here together  
She brought the bad weather with her  
  
She got me coming through the dog door  
She got me coming through the dog door  
  
Got me a pitchfork  
Oh stepladders  
  
You oughta walk away  
Well you cant but you oughta  
Climb the brick up to the stairs  
She got long black hair  
But dont sit there  
He let me keep the chair  
  
She got me coming through the dog door  
She got me coming through the dog door  
  
Pitchfork pitchfork  
Crowbar crowbar  
Clawhammer clawhammer  
Hot tar hot tar  
  
She got me through her middle name  
But she can make it rain  
Shes a small town jail  
And shes starving in the belly of the whale  
  
She got me coming through the dog door  
She got me coming through the dog door  
  
Pitchfork pitchfork  
Crowbar crowbar  
Clawhammer clawhammer  
Hot tar hot tar
