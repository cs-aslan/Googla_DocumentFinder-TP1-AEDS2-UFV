Yeah uh yeah  
These are my one St Thomas flows  
Me and my nggas and some madonna hoes  
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go  
Discussin life and all our common goals  
Smart kids that smoke weed honor roll  
Look how the champagne diamonds flow  
Find dining pour another another glass when the wine is low  
Im in the crib stackin money from here to the ceilin  
Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin  
These other rappers gettin at it very you feelin  
I hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healin  
Take a look at yourself the mirrors revealin  
If you aint got it you aint got it the theory is brilliant  
People ask how music is goin I heard it pays  
I just came off makin 2 million in 30 days  
Damn I guess it does what the message was  
Sometimes I feel I be spendin my money just because  
But weezy Im just out here reppin us  
Till I get to shake the hand of the man thats blessin us  
Yeah I know these nggas miss the mean lyrics  
Kush got the room smellin like teen spirit  
I asked kindly if noone out here would bring there feet up  
Until I lose for now Im the games single leader  
I fly private so noone tells me to bring my seat up  
And book a suite when me and your favorite singer meet up  
Who you like tell me who it is  
Imma make sure that that women is the next one on my list  
I should call it a night but fck it I cant resist  
This one is for all my nggas from my city tryin to diss  
Without a responce from me you really fail to exist  
And I love to see you fail that feelin there is the sht  
I swear aghh pssy ngga get your bread up  
Enjoy the seat that the steward just forced your ass to let up  
Why your scary ass lookin down pick your head up  
Noone told you your disguise is the most ridiculous gettup  
With nose plugs in now I can smell a set up  
  
So your just wastin your time your just only makin me better  
Yeah I try to tell them dont judge me because you heard stuff  
Chasin cash thats my brother from the surf club  
Damn that ngga always kept it so hood  
Back when we would smoke good  
At the oakwoods  
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch  
Now we just fckin all the btches they warned us about  
Scared for the first time everything has clicked  
What if I dont really do the numbers they predict  
Considerin the fact that Im the one that they just picked  
To write a chapter in history this sht has got me sick  
Lyrics courtesy of wwwKillerhiphopcom  
But if I really do it dont expect to get a split  
Cause this truly is some sht I dont expect you all to get  
Im nervous but Im about to kill it cause they about to let the realist team
in  
Throwin up in a huddle ngga Willie beamin  
Were still throwin touchdown passes  
And tore his frame glasses  
Hopin that someone catch it  
People say that oh drake we started to miss it  
But they need to be a little more specific man is this what yall want  
And my best chris tucker impression  
Ducking your questions  
Fck your suggestions  
Money gets all of my love and affection  
Cars all black like the cover of essence  
Im allergic to comin in second  
But I never sneeze  
Ngga YMOE ngga yeeah  
Uh yeah this want yall want  
Octobers Very Own  
Young Money  
ATF  
Thank me later in this btch wasssup
