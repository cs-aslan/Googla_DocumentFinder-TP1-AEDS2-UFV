Youve been talking in circles now for years man  
Lesson number one is change your attitude  
People would like to help you  
  
All you ever wanted was a picture with the queen  
Ah welcome to london  
When youve arrived well you stay or you leave  
Dont you know youre quite certain  
Nothing is so pretty as it used to be no indeed  
  
Could you entertain us with a song  
With a very special melody  
We could sing along  
And you know you should be grateful  
But I let it pass  
Cause you cant get arrested  
But you could kiss my ass  
In hollywood yeah yeah doo doo doo  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
