Looking at pictures  
On Facebook  
Of your exgirlfriend  
At three in the morning  
  
Never helped anyone  
Never helped anyone  
Never helped  
  
Getting so drunk  
You fall over  
Singing up at lampposts  
At two in the morning  
  
Never helped anyone  
Never helped anyone  
Never helped  
  
Cause its so pure  
You can hardly taste it  
Oh its so pure  
You can hardly taste it  
  
Going to parties  
With friends  
Who are friends of friends  
At one in the morning  
  
Never helped anyone  
Never helped anyone  
Never helped  
  
Eleven oclock in the pub  
Drinking everything in sight  
But still not getting drunk  
  
No never helped anyone  
Never helped anyone  
Never helped  
  
Oh its so pure  
You can hardly taste it  
Oh its so pure  
You can hardly taste it  
  
So just hold on  
When the partys over  
And all your friends  
Are going home with their girlfriends to their dog or beds  
  
Yeah just hold on  
When the partys over  
And you cant help the worlds spinning  
Cause heartbreak goes  
Straight to your head

Never helped me
