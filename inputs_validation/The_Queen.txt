Oh  
Tonight Im gonna show  
Them what Im made up for  
The killer queen inside mes  
Coming out  
Say Hello  
  
Oh  
Tonight I will return  
The fame and riches earned  
With you Id watch them all be burnt  
WhoaOh WhoaOh  
  
Whenever I start feeling strong  
Im called a bitch in the night  
But I dont need these 14carat golds to win  
I am a woman I insist its my life  
  
Chorus  
I can be  
The queen thats inside of me  
This is my chance to release it  
Be brave for you youll see  
I can be  
The queen you need me to be  
This is my chance to be the dance  
Our dream is happening  
I can be the queen  
  
I  
Wind and hurricane  
The stormy sky and rain  
When you run dry Ill flood your pain  
Whoaoh whoaoh  
  
In between the moments of  
The lady Ive become  
A voice speaks through the noise like drums  
Rhompabumpa  
  
Whenever I start feeling strong  
Im called a bitch in the night  
But I dont need these 14carat golds to win  
I am a woman I insist its my life  
  
I can be  
The queen thats inside of me  
This is my chance to release it  
Be brave for you youll see  
I can be  
The queen you need me to be  
This is my chance to be the dance  
Our dream is happening  
I can be the queen  
  
The queeeeeeeeeeeeeen  
The queeeeen  
Queeeeeen  
Queeeeeen  
  
Starry night come inside me like never before  
Dont forget me when I come crying to heavens door  
I will fly on a challenger across the sky  
Like a phoenix so you can remind them of the dream I bore  
  
Repeat x2  
Whoa oh oh  
Whoaoh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Whoaoh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh
