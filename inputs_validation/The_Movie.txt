The movie will begin in five moments  
The mindless voice announced  
All those unseated will await the next show  
  
We filed slowly languidly into the hall  
The auditorium was vast and silent  
As we seated and were darkened the voice continued  
  
The program for this evening is not new  
Youve seen this entertainment through and through  
Youve seen your birth your life and death  
you might recall all of the rest  
Did you have a good world when you died  
Enough to base a movie on  
  
Im getting out of here  
Where are you going  
To the other side of morning  
Please dont chase the clouds pagodas  
  
Her cunt gripped him like a warm friendly hand  
  
Its alright all your friends are here  
When can I meet them  
After youve eaten  
Im not hungry  
Uh we meant beaten  
  
Silver stream silvery scream  
  
Oooooh impossible concentration
