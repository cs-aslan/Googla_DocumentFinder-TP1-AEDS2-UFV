I am down at the water  
My bare feet are numb  
And for aeons now nothing seems real  
now its hard to hold sight  
Through your soft eiderdown  
But I still got my hands on the wheel  
you have set my mind  
Between worlds spinning round  
Im a stranger in my universe  
but I see my sun  
And I know that it will  
Be forever shining on earth  
you can rain down on me  
But you cant darken the sun  
You can cast a spell on the moon  
But you cant kill the sun
