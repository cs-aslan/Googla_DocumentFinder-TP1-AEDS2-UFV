Im gonna wake you up early  
Cause Im gonna take a ride wih you  
Were going down to the Honda shop  
Ill tell you what were gonna do  
Put on a ragged sweat shirt  
Ill take you anywhere you want me to  
  
First gear its all right  
Second gear real riot  
Third gear hang it tight  
Faster its all right  
  
He climbs hills like the magic  
Cause my Honda felt really light  
When I go into the turn  
Stick with me and hang on tight  
I better turn on the lights  
So I can ride my Honda tonight  
  
First gear its all right  
Second gear real riot  
Third gear hang it tight  
Faster its all right
