I could escape this feeling with my China Girl  
I feel a wreck without my little China Girl  
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder  
Saw the stars crashing  
Im a mess without my little China Girl  
Wake up mornings wheres my little China Girl  
I hear hearts beating loud as thunder  
Saw the stars crashing down  
I feel atragic like Im Marlon Brando  
When I look at my China Girl  
I could pretend nothing really meant too much  
When I look at my China Girl  
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow  
Visions of swastikas in my head  
Plans for everyone  
Its in the way of my eyes  
My little China Girl  
You shouldnt mess with me  
Ill ruin everything you are  
Ill give you television  
Ill give you eyes of blue  
Ill give your man the words to rule the world  
And when I get excited  
My little China Girl says  
Oh baby just you shut your mouth  
She says shshshhh
