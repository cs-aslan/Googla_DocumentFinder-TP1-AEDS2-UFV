I Feel The Same Wickid Hungers Calling From Deep  
They Tell Me To Hunt Devil In They Robes And Slippers  
Take Some Rope Clippers A Black Cloak And Scissors  
Now Im Standin In The Back Yard If I Dont Regret  
Steady Sweatin When I Do This Aint No Forgettin  
Enter Through The Back Door While Everybodys Asleep  
I See They Tighty And Neat I Bout To Bloody The Sheets  
Its Gonna Be A Blood Splatter Expert Feild Date  
Because Im Killin Today To Take This Feelin Away  
He Told Me You People Are Here To Ruin Our Cause  
When Im Unsrewin Your Jaws Your Gonna Have To Repaint The Walls  
And Its A Hunger Man Im Hungary Like Im Homeless And Its Thanksgivin  
Thank You For Your sacrifice Your Life Is What You Givin

Chorus2x  
Its A Sickness Life  
I Cant Stop Myself

Now When Nobody Left Im Killin Myself  
Violent J  
Sometimes I Wear My Murda Cloak And Turn Into The News  
I Like To Watch They Speculations Cause They Always Assume  
They Got A Shoeprint Big Deal When I Been  
Burned Up There  
When The Fuck Them Stupid Piggys Gonna Learn Up There  
I Tied A Bitch UpI Had To Duct Tape The Bitch Face  
I Threw Her In The Trunk Got Home And Found Her Suffercated Waste  
I Had To Cut The Bitch Up Just Met To Shut The Bitch Up  
I Never Fucked That Hoe They Said I Did Man She Was A Slut  
Im Sick And Tired Of They Lies Thus Everybody Dies  
Break Into Some Homes  
I Take The Spoon And Bloody Eyes  
Im Nutty Guys  
But You Cant See The Darkness I Do  
Maybe Im Heartless Its True  
But Every Part Is Cause You  
My Daddy Beat Me With A 7 Iron Then Brought Home A Hooker  
My Daddy Beat Her With A Shovel Threw Her In The Cooker  
Next Day I Hate To Say It But You Know What Happened Next  
He Served My Plate And In The Meat I Found A Cotex  
Oh My God  
Chorus2x
