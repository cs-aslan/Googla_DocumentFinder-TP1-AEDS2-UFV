The throat is deep and the mouth is wide  
Saw some things on the other side  
Made me promise to never tell  
But you know me I cant help myself  
  
Now Ive got something you have to see  
They put something inside of me  
The smile is red and its eyes are black  
I dont think Ill be coming back  
  
I dont believe it  
I had to see it  
I came back haunted  
I came back haunted  
  
I said goodbye but I  
I had to try  
I came back haunted  
CCCcame back haunted  
  
Everywhere now reminding me  
I am not who I used to be  
Im afraid this has just begun  
Consequences for what Ive done yeah
