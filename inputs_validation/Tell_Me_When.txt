Tell me when tell me when  
Tell me when will I see you again  
Tell me when will I see you again  
Tell me when will I see you again  
Tell me when  
Kelly took a lifetime searching for the bottom line  
I wasnt in to searching cause I was doing fine  
I wasnt into fighting chasing sweating slaving fretting lacing  
Any waste of effort wasnt part of my design  
Billy was an inspiration positive and kind  
until he let confusion overcome his youthful mind  
Common sense dictated I could never be so blind and then  
then I see you  
  
Tell me when tell me when  
Tell me when will I see you again  
Tell me when will I see you again  
Tell me when will I see you again  
Tell me when  
Happenstance and episode unplanned to load in time  
Coincidence the second chance resounding like a rhyme  
Our paths may cross against the odds to wreck the plans you made  
among the crowd a face that smiles to melt your masquerade  
If only I could see you says a stranger deep inside and lets you know that  
when you were so sure you really lied  
If only I could see you says the voice within your brain  
and quietly insistently it says it once again  
And then I really need to know  
  
Tell me when will I see you again  
Tell me when will I see you again  
Tell me when will I see you again  
Tell me when  
If wouldnt seem so lonely If only if only  
if only I could see you If only if only  
Baby you could be free If only if only  
if only I could see you If only if only  
Youll never have to doubt me If only if only  
if only I could see you If only if only  
Baby you could free me If only if only  
if only I could see you if only I could see you  
If only I could see you if only I could see you  
if only I could see you if only I could see you  
if only I could see you if only I could see you  
if only I could see you if only I could    
  
If only I could see you if only I could see you  
if only I could see you if only I could see you  
if only I could see you if only I could see you  
if only I could see you if only I could    
Tell me when will I see you again  
Tell me when will I see you again  
Tell me when will I see you again
