What is it about you  
Youre big  
Youre loud  
Youre tough nyc  
I go years without you  
Then I  
Cant get  
Enough  
Enough of the cab drivers answering back  
In the language far from pure  
Enough of frankfurters answering back  
Brother you know youre in nyc  
Too busy  
Too crazy  
Too hot  
Too cold  
Too late  
Im sold  
Again  
On nyc

The parade

And a mayor five foot two  
No other town in  
The whole forty eight  
Can half compare  
To you  
  
All  
  
Oh nyc

Amen For nyc Nyc  
The shimmer of Times Square

The pulse  
  
Grace  
  
The beat  
  
Warbucks and grace  
  
The drive Nyc

The citys bright  
As a penny arcade  
It blinks it tilts it rings  
  
Annie  
  
To think that Ive lived here all of my life  
And never seen these things

I give you fair warning  
Up there  
In lights

Go ask the Gershwins or Kaufman and Hart  
The place they love the best  
Though California pays big for their art  
Their fan mail comes addressed to nyc  
Tomorrow a penthouse  
Thats way up high  
Tonight  
The Y  
Why not  
Its nyc
