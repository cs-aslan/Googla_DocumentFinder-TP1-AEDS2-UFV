Red lights on the highway  
Headlights blinding my eye  
Red lights keep me waiting  
White lights drive me insane  
Red lights in the city  
Streetlights high in the night  
Searchlights Im looking for someone  
Red lights young bloods alright  
  
Try as I can but   
I cant keep away  
No no no no way  
  
Red lights she knows what Im here for  
Headlights look me in the eye  
Red lights are you looking for danger  
White lights drives me insane  
  
Try as I can but   
I cant keep away  
No no no not for one day  
  
Red lights no questions  
Streetlights c youths desire  
Red lights burning desire  
White lights c put you to bed   
Red lights in the city  
Streetlights shadow the night  
Sunshine if you need some one  
Headlights that young bloods alright  
  
Try as I can but   
I cant keep away  
Not today  
She brings me to my knees  
Try as I can but   
I cant keep away  
I want you babe  
  
Red lights oh I want you  
Red lights I need it  
Red lights you get too heavy  
Red lights
