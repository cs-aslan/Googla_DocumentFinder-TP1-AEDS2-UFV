The songs that I made in my bedroom and shit  
Finally give a nigga leg room in this bitch  
  
Yeah Cole World make way for the chosen one  
Aint nobody else Id rather be not even Oprahs son  
Mommas youngest getting paper like the oldest one  
We living better guess God felt he owed us one  
Closets barely had no clothes in them  
So you throw my niggas in hoopty but we still bag hoes and them  
These niggas give they heart and soul to them  
I wonder if they know we doving them  
Ass fat so when pinch em pincher like a Doberman  
Run up on em politicing like Keith Olbermann  
Whats your name Where ya from  
Ya got a dream Ill sell ya one  
Come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top  
Wont stop wont stop  
Hey and dont stop  
Now if it dont jam the hoes wont rock  
And if it aint crack then the fiends wont cop  
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you dont got  
  
Gotta see it to believe it  
Gotta see it to believe it  
Gotta see it to believe it  
  
And dont stop  
Now if it dont jam the hoes wont rock  
And if it aint crack then the fiends wont cop  
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you dont got  
  
Gotta see it to believe it  
Gotta see it to believe it  
Gotta see it to believe it  
  
Theres so much pain on my brain I gotta jot it out  
But as of late nigga it aint been shit to pout about  
I turn up the news my blues seem petty  
Cause my view of the city is incredible with no album out  
Im blessed nigga Im blessed  
When Im all alone these words just flow out of my chest  
Turn em into poems they worship Im the best  
And though Im taking long they fck with me none the less  
Yeah enough sleeping I put you niggas to rest  
The only one saying shit is like a nigga got tourettes chyeah  
Unimpressed with you niggas  
You the shit only cause I digested you niggas  
But I digress boy you bout as G as a fcking tie dye vest  
And your wifey is a bird even in her Prada dress  
Want a nigga like me to come and get her out her nest out her nest  
Like come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top  
  
Wont stop wont stop  
Hey dont stop  
  
Now if it dont jam the hoes wont rock  
And if it aint crack then the fiends wont cop  
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you dont got  
  
Gotta see it to believe it  
Gotta see it to believe it  
Gotta see it to believe it
