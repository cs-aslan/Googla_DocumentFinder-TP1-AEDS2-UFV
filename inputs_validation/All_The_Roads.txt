I went down to the river to watch the fish swim by  
But I got to the river so lonesome I wanted to die oh Lord  
And then I jumped in the river but the river was dry  
  
Hes long gone and now Im lonesome blue  
  
I had me a man who couldnt be true  
He made me for my money and she made me blue  
A woman needs a man that he can lean on  
But my leanin post is done left and gone  
  
Hes long gone and now Im lonesome blue  
  
Im gonna find me a river one thats cold as ice  
And when I find me that river Lord Im gonna pay the price Oh Lord  
Im goin down in it three times but Lord Im only comin up twice  
  
Hes long gone and now Im lonesome blue  
  
He told me on Sunday he was checkin me out  
Long about Monday he was nowhere about  
And here it is Tuesday aint had no news  
I got them gone but not forgotten blues  
Hes long gone and now Im lonesome blue
