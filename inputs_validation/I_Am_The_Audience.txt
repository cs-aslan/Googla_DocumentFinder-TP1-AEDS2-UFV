I am the audience  
Theres no doubt no consequence  
I could make the morning papers  
If I use my capers  
Lets be the audience  
I might lose my patience  
Polite applause excepted  
To the ones selected as the audience  
  
Oh Iam the audience  
No doubt no consequence  
Cause Im the audience  
  
Lets be the audience  
I might lose my patience  
Polite applause excepted  
To the ones selected  
I am the audience  
Breakdown the pretence  
No longer be silent  
Lets turn to violence  
  
I am the audience
