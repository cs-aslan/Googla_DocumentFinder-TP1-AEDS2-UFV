When I first met his momma  
She was just nineteen  
Couldnt say for certain who the father was  
I have known him since he was a pup  
And Im gonna raise him up  
If you never knew your daddy  
Like I never knew mine  
It feels like everybody knows youre fatherless  
This boy may not be blood of my blood  
But Im gonna raise him up  
Ill provide for him  
Walk beside of him  
I am strong enough  
Cause its time he knew  
What a son can do  
With a fathers love  
He can change the world  
Yall may have to look at Joseph  
A couple thousand years ago  
When he held a newborn baby he named Jesus  
He said he may not be blood of my blood  
Still Im gonna raise him up  
Ill provide for him  
Walk beside of him  
I am strong enough  
I will show him too  
What a son can do  
With a fathers love  
And he will change the world  
Thirty three years later  
When the son was in his grave  
Broken and abandoned by a world he came to save  
His real dad said hes mine  
Blood of my blood  
And Im gonna raise him up  
Ill provide for you  
Walk beside of you  
I am strong enough  
I have seen from you  
What a son can do  
With a fathers love  
One man changed the world  
And he can change your world  
But you gotta raise him up  
Raise him up
