Sarah Beth is scared to death  
To hear what the doctor will say  
She hasnt been well  
Since the day that she fell  
  
And the bruises just wont go away  
So she sits and see waits with her mother and dad  
Flips through an old magazine  
Til a the nurse with a smile  
  
Stands at the door  
And says will you please come with me  
  
Sarah Beth is scared to death  
Cause the doctor just told her the news  
Between the red cells and white  
Somethings not right  
But were gonna take care of you  
  
Six chances in ten it wont come back again  
With the therapy were gonna try  
Its just been approved  
Its the strongest there is  
I think we caught it in time  
  
Sarah Beth closes her eyes  
She dreams shes dancing  
Around and around without any cares  
And her very first love is holding her close  
And the soft wind in blowing her hair  
  
Sarah Beth is scared to death  
As she sits holding her mom  
Says it would be a mistake  
For someone to take  
A girl with no hair to the prom  
  
Oh just this morning right there on her pillow  
Was the cruelest of any surprise  
And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands  
The proof that she couldnt deny  
  
Sarah Beth closes her eyes  
She dreams shes dancing  
Around and around without any cares  
And her very first love was holding her close  
And the soft wind is blowing her hair  
  
Its quarter to seven  
That boys at the door  
And her daddy ushers him in  
And when he takes off his cap  
They all start to cry  
Cause this mornin where his hair had been  
Softly she touches just skin  
  
And they go dancin  
Around and around without any cares  
And her very first true love was holding her close  
And for a moment she isnt scared
