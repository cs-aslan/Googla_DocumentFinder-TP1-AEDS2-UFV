yeah  
  
eight days a week with my baby at home  
and you know that shes my tender honey  
  
baby Ive been good  
but you know its rough  
when youre spending all of my money  
  
aint no disputin Im your man  
you know I want to tell the world  
  
youre the only woman  
show me what love can be  
youre the only woman  
that understands a man like me  
  
rock and roll is a way of life  
but dont you know it brings me down  
music is my game but when Im home  
I treat a lady like shes wearing a crown  
  
stranded in the storm round Lakewood Way  
you know who comes to mind  
  
shes the only woman  
show me what love can be  
shes the only woman  
that understands a man like me  
  
guitar solo  
  
when Im away with time to kill  
just sittin around gettin high  
thinking about your sweet sweet love  
I want to jump on a plane and fly  
  
sweet little susie  
show me what love can be  
shes the only woman  
that understands a man  
she understands a man  
like me  
  
shes the only woman  
shes the only woman  
shes the only woman
