I got nothing to eat in this old house  
I gotta go out and catch a mouse  
I cant be wrong so I gotta be right  
  
Its eat or be eaten  
  
Somethings hungry like a hunter  
And its probing like a finger  
As the drumbeat keeps things hurrying  
Thats the part thats so appealing  
  
Its the beat that dominates  
Each breath you draw  
Each step you take  
Strike or be stricken  
  
Eat or be eaten yum yum yum yum  
Eat or be eaten  
  
Your skills are highly specialized  
But still that girl can magnetize  
You sense the hunger in her eyes  
  
Its beat or be beaten  
  
Theres no softness in her eyes  
A weird dull glint is in her eyes  
With a stubborn will to tantalize  
  
Like some cheap devil in disguise  
And its troubling me  
Hell its nervy thats what it is  
  
Eat or be eaten  
Beat or be beaten  
Strike or be stricken  
  
The night is dark the night is pulp  
Tilt back your head and take a gulp  
Of air thats screamed a thousand times  
  
The main thing is to victimize  
Its just the night for a conquering tribe  
Oh its just the night for a conquering tribe  
  
Eat or be eaten  
Beat or be beaten  
  
Faster than the arrow flies  
Or the man who smiles while he lies  
Its just the night for a conquering tribe  
And the girls are calling in her yellow dress  
  
That girl is calling in a yellow dress  
She says eat eat eat here boys  
Eat eat eat here boys  
  
And then
