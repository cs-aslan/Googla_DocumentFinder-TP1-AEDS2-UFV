Hello baby its a long time  
I know youre here  
I feel you close to me  
So much to say but  
Making all the words  
I save them all inside  
Then I see you and they disappear  
Like leaves beneath the snow  
And life dont wait for everyone  
And yesterday I let you go  
  
Im watching you tonight  
And I waited for so long  
Ive been living on your memory  
In a world where we were one  
And you told me you could make it on your own  
  
Im watching you tonight  
And its making me cry  
When I lost you I lost everything  
But our love should never die  
Not mine my love is born to be your love  
Oh baby  
To make history near you  
But the moment when I see me in your eyes  
Youre gone youre gone  
  
You can say goodbye if you want to  
I love you but Ill try to understand  
But in my soul I know its meant to be  
Together you and me  
  
But I know you came to fade away  
Like voices in the wind  
And I wonder if you feel my love  
Its stronger than its ever been  
  
Im watching you tonight  
And theres no other one  
All the love we gave eternally  
Now its dying in the sun  
Not mine my love was born to be your love  
Oh baby  
To make history near you  
But that moment when I see me in your eyes  
Youre gone youre gone youre gone
