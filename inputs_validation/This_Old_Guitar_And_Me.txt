This old guitar and me  
And the things that weve been through  
CF Martin built him  
Back in nineteen fortytwo  
I remember when we met  
I was only seventeen  
I spent all my college money  
On a half a dozen strings  
I thought my folks would kill me  
I found out I was wrong  
They said your futures written on your face  
When you sing those travelin songs  
So we headed for Kentucky  
With a suitcase full of dreams  
My roughout books a few Tshirts  
A worn out pair of jeans ooh  
This old guitar and me  
We spent a lot of nights alone  
Well sometimes wed get lucky  
And take bar maid home  
One night stands for breakfast  
Two strangers with the blues  
Wed wake up in the morning  
And both feel a little used  
Well home was just a highway  
Wed roam from town to town  
Just me and that old flattop  
Not caring where were bound  
From Maine to California  
With a five piece travelin band  
Singin songs about the hard times  
That face the common man ooh  
This old guitar and me  
Lord we did the best we could  
One was born a sinner  
And one a piece of wood  
God sent a wooden angel  
To guide me on my way  
We were meant to be together  
Until my dyin day  
Well now my dearest old companion  
Lies underneath my bed  
Well our travelin days are over  
Man but the memories fill my head  
Well Ive settled with my family  
Here in the hills of Tennessee  
To teach my childrens children  
Bout this old guitar and me ooh
