Im dancing like a mad man  
I hope she likesa me  
The chance to be just on my own  
I want to silly be  
  
The club is full of people  
Perhaps they think Im mad  
I close my eyes and I go home  
I feel a little sad  
  
Chorus  
I just cant dance  
My only chance  
  
Im shy shy oh so shy  
  
The girls dont like the way I move  
I think at times Ive lost it  
Do I look like I cant move  
Or do I move exhausted  
  
If I just knew she loves me  
I know I wouldnt care  
But she talks to the barman  
And I think thats unfair  
  
Chorus  
  
Im sad sad oh so sad  
  
And now that girl moves close to me  
I join into her move  
Pretending I enjoy it  
And now I lost the groove  
  
One guy stands tho between us  
Shows up with all his power  
I now feel like an idiot  
Who stands in a cold shower  
  
Chorus  
  
The barman stares at me  
So So drink  
Then turns around  
And pours a wink  
  
I move away  
But play it cool  
I think shes right  
Im just a fool  
  
Chorus  
  
Im shy shy oh so shy
