Oh bring him back  
If hes too much for you  
And you dont know just what to do  
Just send him right on back to me  
Cause Im still the fool I used to be  
  
If its only just for a day  
Ill take him back any old kinda way  
I aint fooling anymore  
Been crying since he walked out the door  
  
Dont know what to do  
Dont know where to go  
You know I love him so  
You know so wont you  
bring him back mmm  
Bring him back  
You know you gotta bring him back  
Bring him back ooh yeah  
Bring him back mmm  
Just bring him back to me  
  
I want you to bring him back  
I want you to bring him back  
I want you to bring him back  
  
Oh bring him back to me  
My life is full of misery  
Let me play with the boy  
Let me be his little toy  
  
Oh bring him back to me  
My life is full of misery  
You know you gotta bring him back  
Ah ha youve gotta bring him back  
Oh bring him back to me  
Oh my life is full of misery
