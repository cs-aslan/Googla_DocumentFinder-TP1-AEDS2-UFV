Verse 1  
Down here Memphis no hanky panky  
And we ride whips on twanky twankys  
Thugged out club scene dranky dranky  
That cristy cristy til we faintn faintn  
Aaaaayyyyyyy  
And they run to the dance floor  
All shape sizes from dime to zero  
Im not Captain Kurt or Captain Nero  
Im just trying to get you and your friend to GO  
Then I dream voices hit my skilo  
Tshirt head band techmarino  
Old school throw back Memphis shobo  
Lorenzo jersey to hide the 4O  
Shawty Creeo and she know Judo  
She say she got some green that will send me to Pluto  
Sorry mommy ya boy dont smizzo  
But you can let your boy burn brain in the G4  
Chorus repeat 2X  
Aaaaaaayyyyyyyyy  
Shake it mommy  
Girl tell me where you get that from  
Put it on me  
Alright alright  
verse 2  
Im like me burning drink but me at the bar and uuhhh  
Me from the hood but me is a star and uuhhh  
You looking right and we can go far if uuhhh  
Ya dont mind spending time with a hustlah  
Yo gotti M down Lil Monster and  
You get it right how bout you be his wifey and  
We cock whips move bricks in a mini van  
Take trips to Hawaii to hula dance  
Aaaaayyyyyyy  
She back in Philippines  
Aaaaayyyyyyy  
Looking right in them Gucci jeans  
She bounce she turn she drop it low  
And I look like damn This bitch is cold  
The monastery monora whatever hoe  
Look Im from Memphis aint seen that shit before  
Down here they twerk and shake it fast  
But we love it cause we watch her crip her ass  
Chorus
