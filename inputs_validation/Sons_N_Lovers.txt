I was your babyyou were my girl  
When I asked you to marry me the tears fell  
  
Sons n lovers sons n lovers waving  
My childhood goodbyeit seems so sad  
Well how long have you been my best friend  
This wont be the end of  
Sons n loverssons n loversshe wont wanna talk anymore about it  
  
You were my lady I was your number one  
When I said I was leaving tears run  
  
Sons n loverssons n lovers breakin  
Tryin not to hurt each others hearts  
Well how long can we exist I know  
We cant go on like this  
Sons n loverssons and loversi dont wanna lie anymore  
  
Was that you I sawwalkin out along the shore  
Was that you I sawtalkin to him  
Was that you I sawputtin his hands in yours  
Thats alright ma you can still love him  
Thats alright ma you can still love  
And through the yearsyou know we will remember  
Time will never take old times away  
How long for you to discover that there still some strings attached to  
Sons n loverssons and lovers  
But I dont wanna play anymore  
Sons n lovers
