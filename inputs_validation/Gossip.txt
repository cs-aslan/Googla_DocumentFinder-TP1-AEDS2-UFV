I hate gossip  
And I dont walk around looking for it you know  
But yesterday it seemed to just wander until it found me  
You know like  
Gossip found me  
Then why dont you just provin it  
How You dont know how to prove it  
Well what you just do is  
  
Stop hatin on a nigga  
That is a weak emotion  
The lady of a nigga  
And you could get tipped  
Like ya waitin on a nigga  
Put a body bag and an apron on a nigga  
  
I give my all behind the mic  
But you could never see if you sit behind the light  
You dont have to pick me to win the title fight  
But Im a wear that championship belt so tight  
And if Im wrong there is no right  
And if Im wrong there is no white  
Im tryna be polite  
but you bitches in my hair like the fucking Police  
My flow is rare these other rappers nice  
These other rappers bark  
Some of em even bite  
But Im much more bright  
I give the game sight  
So before you dim the light you just might might wanna  
  
Think it over think it over ooh  
Think it over think it over baby baby  
  
Stop analyzin critacizin  
You should realize what I am and start epidamizin  
Legitimate I got the heart of the biggest lion  
Im confident like fuck em all pull out my dick and ride it  
My flow sick so sick its like my shit is dyin  
It rains a lot in my city because my citys cryin  
because my citys dyin  
But I emerge from all of that I am a livin pioneer sighin  
Fear God not them  
Steer my Robin Coupe through the streets of the booth and  
Soowoo  
And then I leek a tub in the boot I leave a blood bath  
Sorry theres a tub in the boot now where the drugs at  
Im twisted like the strings on a shoe  
No nigga fuck that  
Im twisted like the strings on a boot  
Now where New Orleans at  
I feel hip hop stole me like a bus pass  
So in your possession I I must ask  
  
Hey havent I been good to you Think it over  
Tell me havent I been sweet to you  
  
Drag my name through the mud  
I come out clean  
Cast away stones  
I wont even blink  
A gun is not a math problem  
I wont even think  
Just leave you dead like the meat under my sink  
Dont believe in me  
Dont believe me  
Ive graduated from hungry  
And made it to greedy  
My flow is like pasta  
Take it and eat it  
But Im a need cheese if Im bakin a ziti  
You niggas want beef  
I want a steak in the weed B  
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where weed be  
Hard body nigga takin it easy  
All about my paper bout my paper like Eazy  
Why do rappers lot of rappers lot of fans lot of rappers lot of rappers  
Lie like actin cut the motherfuckin cameras  
Cut the check nigga fuck your pops  
And make it out to Mr Hip Hop  
  
Im not dead Im alive  
  
And I aint dead Im alive
