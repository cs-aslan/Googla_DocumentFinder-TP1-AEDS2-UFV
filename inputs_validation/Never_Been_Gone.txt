The wind is coming up strong and fast  
And the moon is smiling on me  
Miles from nowhere so small at last  
In between the sky and the sea  
  
Im bound for the island  
The tide is with me  
I think I can make it before dawn  
Its night on the ocean  
Im going home  
And it feels like Ive never  
Ive never been gone  
  
Seagulls cry and the hills are green  
And my friends are waiting for me  
Freak ambition is all a dream  
Let me drown my pride in the sea  
  
Im bound for the ocean  
The tide is with me  
I think I can make it by dawn  
Its night on the ocean  
Im going home  
And it feels like Ive never  
Ive never been gone  
Oh it feels like Ive never  
Ive never been gone
