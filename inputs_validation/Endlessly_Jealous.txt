Jealousy endlessly  
Sweeps through my mind  
Jealousy often causes me to  
Be unkind  
  
Im sorry I said that  
Im sorry I did that  
Im sorry I hit you  
Im sorry Im sorry  
  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Being endlessly jealous of me  
The man that you thought I could be turning red  
With jealousy  
  
Endlessly jealousy  
Eats through my skull  
Endlessly jealousy  
Makes me feel dull  
  
Fighting  
Endless jealous fighting  
I feel my fingers tightening  
Tightening please dont break her arm  
  
Jealously thinking of you  
Of your endless possession of me  
Of my jealousy endlessly jealousy endlessly  
Jealous of you  
  
Sorry running to a phone to say  
Im sorry running out of dimes  
The phone on the street spits at me  
Have a good day  
  
Sorry please you know how I am sorry  
Ive been this way for  
Oh so long endlessly zealously  
Jealous of you  
  
Jealousy endlessly  
Eats through my mind  
Jealousy endlessly  
Makes me be unkind  
  
Im sorry I said that  
Im sorry I did that  
Im sorry I hit you  
Im sorry Im sorry  
  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Being endlessly jealous of me  
Endlessly jealous of you being endlessly  
Jealous of me  
  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Endlessly jealous of you
