I sit in my easy chair  
Ive got so much time to spare  
Because I know in the future day  
Ill have my lions share  
Theres nothing that I like better  
Than getting something for nothing  
Some will tell you that nothings for free  
Obviously theyve not met me  
I live the lifestyle they speak of so highly  
I live the life the life ORiley  
You can have your cake and eat it too  
And theres lots of free lunch for you  
You think youre being cheated you dont have a clue  
You dont know what to do  
I sit in my easy chair  
Ive got so much time to spare  
Because I know in the future day  
Ill have my lions share  
I live the lifestyle they speak of so highly  
I live the life the life ORiley  
Jump in jump in
