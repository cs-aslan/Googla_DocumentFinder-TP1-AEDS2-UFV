Spring is here spring is here  
Life is skittles and life is beer  
I think the loveliest time of the year  
Is the spring I do dont you Course you do  
But theres one thing that makes spring complete for me  
And makes every Sunday a treat for me  
  
All the world seems in tune on a spring afternoon  
When were poisoning pigeons in the park  
Every Sunday youll see my sweetheart and me  
As we poison the pigeons in the park  
  
When they see us coming  
The birdies all try and hide  
But they still go for peanuts  
When coated with cyanide  
  
The suns shining bright  
Everything seems all right  
When were poisoning pigeons in the park  
  
Weve gained notoriety  
And caused much anxiety  
In the Audobon Society  
With our games  
They call it impiety  
And lack of propriety  
And quite a variety of unpleasant names  
  
But its not against any religion  
To want to dispose of a pigeon  
  
So if Sunday youre free  
Why dont you come with me  
And well poison the pigeons in the park  
And maybe well do in a squirrel or two  
While were poisoning pigeons in the park  
  
Well murder them amid laughter and merriment  
Except for the few we take home to experiment  
  
My pulse will be quickenin  
With each drop of strychnine  
We feed to a pigeon  
It just takes a smidgin  
To poison a pigeon in the park
