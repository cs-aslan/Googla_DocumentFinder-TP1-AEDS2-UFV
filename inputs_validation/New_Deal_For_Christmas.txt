Warbucks  
  
I know the Depressions depressing  
  
Grace  
  
The carols are stilled  
The stored arent filled  
  
Warbucks  
  
And the windows are minus the dressing  
  
Grace  
  
The children dont grin  
The Santas are thin  
  
Grace and warbucks  
  
And Ive heard a terrible rumour  
No goodwill no cheer  
  
Warbucks  
  
But well get a new deal for Christmas  
This year  
  
Annie and orphans  
  
The snowflakes are frighting of falling  
  
Molly  
  
And oh what a fix  
No peppermint sticks  
  
Warbucks  
  
And all through the land folks are bawling  
  
Grace  
  
And filled with despair  
Cause cupboards are bare  
  
Warbucks  
  
But Santas got brand new assistants  
Theres nothing to fear  
Theyre bringing a new deal deal for Christmas  
This year  
  
Servants  
  
Bong bong bong bong  
Bong bong bong bong  
  
Roosevelt  
  
On Farley and Perkins  
On Ikes and Wallace  
On Monganthau and Cummings  
  
All  
  
Fill our pockets with dollars  
  
Roosevelt  
  
On Roper and Swanson  
  
Roosevelt and warbucks  
  
Get along Cordell Hull  
  
Orphans  
  
Get along giddy up  
  
Men  
  
Call your committee up  
  
Women  
  
Build every city up  
  
All  
  
Cheer every kiddy up  
Fill every stocking with laughter  
We havent got room for any more gloom  
Lets ring every bell from its rafter  
  
Warbucks  
  
And chime cross the land  
  
Annie  
  
Tomorrows at hand  
  
Warbucks  
  
spoken  
Those happy days that we were promised  
  
Roosevelt  
  
Are finally here  
  
All  
  
Were getting a new deal for Christmas  
Were getting a new deal for Christmas  
Were getting a new deal for Christmas  
Were getting a new deal for Christmas  
Christmas  
This year
