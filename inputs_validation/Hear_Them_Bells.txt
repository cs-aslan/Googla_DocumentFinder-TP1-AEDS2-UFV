Hear them bells the story of our love  
Hear them bells from up above  
My darling I need you more each day  
Id be contented dear  
If only you would say  
Ill be yours forever sweetheart  
Our love is real well never ever part  
To be with you love is my one desire  
And if youll leave me  
Youll set my soul on fire  
Hear them bells the story of our love  
Hear them bells the story of our love  
Hear them bells the storys in their sound  
Hear them bells Im heaven bound  
To be with you love is my one desire  
And if youll leave me  
Youll set my soul on fire  
Hear them bells the story of our love  
Hear them bells the story of our love
