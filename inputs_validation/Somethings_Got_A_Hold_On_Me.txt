Tell Mama  
Etta James  
  
Your dogs aint found a good girl  
One that love you and give you warning  
Now you find that you been misused  
Well how many girls can think all right  
  
Shed embarrass you anywhere  
Shed make her friends think that she didnt care  
Give me the chance and Id been begging  
And I just want to take care of you and I want you to  
  
Tell Mama all about it tell Mama what you need  
Tell Mama what you want and how that girl does things all right  
Let me hear you say
