You called me up on the phone today  
Struggling with the right words to say  
Time can change a thing or two  
Time has changed the lives of me and you  
But you know it could have been different dad  
  
The word brings back a sweet memory  
Im sitting on a bluff on a broken tree  
By my side a distinguished man  
Giving me encouragement telling me I can  
And you know youre not there  
  
You say Son lets forget the past  
I want another chance gonna make it last  
Youre begging me for a brand new start  
Trying to mend a bridge thats been blown apart  
But you know you never built it dad  
  
So I sit here through the night  
And I write myself to sleep  
And time keeps ticking  
  
Time has made you finally realize  
Your loneliness and your guilt inside  
Youre reaching for something you never had  
Turning around now youre looking back  
And you know Im not there  
  
You say Son lets forget the past  
I want another chance gonna make it last  
Youre begging me for a brand new start  
Trying to mend a bridge thats been blown apart  
But you know you never built it dad
