Chorus  
Cuba cuba here I come  
Theres a place in the caribbean sun  
Land of future  
Land of dreams  
Checking for the coast  
  
Cuban cigars  
And the last glass in the bar  
I see the rise and the fall  
Of this down downtown miami  
Give me someone to dance with and love  
When the sun goes down  
While Fidel is growing his hair  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
  
Cuba cuba libre  
Its Ace of base  
Cuba cuba libre  
Uh huh  
  
Shock  
  
Share in the sun  
Givin us some taps  
Thats still the one  
Where coca cola and coke  
Have arrived for consumers  
Its so happy and poor  
Little country down in the south  
We like it  
The people the nature  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Cuba cuba libre  
In the sun in the south  
Its Ace of base  
Cuba cuba libre  
Uhmm ah ahh  
  
Cuba cuba libre  
The world is coming over to yato ya  
x4  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Its so happy and poor  
Little country down in the south  
We like it  
The people the nature  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Cuba cuba libre  
Theres a place in the caribbean sun  
Cuba cuba libre  
The world is coming over to ya  
Cuba cuba libre  
Its Ace of base  
Cuba cuba libre  
Checking for the coast
