Whatever happens  
We left some love along the way  
But it aint reserved  
Well think of some words of love to say  
And well smile oh and be happy anyway  
And well kiss before we say goodnight  
  
And whatever happens  
Therell be some times along the way  
When it isnt easy  
There just cant be sunshine on every day  
Well smile oh and be happy anyway  
And well kiss before we say goodnight  
  
Ive got you in my life  
Together we can reach a higher ground  
Well be alright  
Just as long as youre around  
I wont let you down  
  
Whatever happens  
  
Therell be some good times and some bad  
But it aint easy  
Lets just remember the good times that we had  
And well smile oh and be happy anyway  
And well kiss before we say goodnight  
And well kiss before we say goodnight yeah  
And well kiss before we say goodnight
