Thought Id seen everything there was to see in this world  
Now Im not so sure Ive really seen anything at all  
I thought life could show me no surprises  
And then you came and showed me I was wrong  
I have seen the bluest skies rainbows that would make you cry  
I have seen miracles that moved my soul days that changed my life  
I have seen the brightest stars shine like diamonds in the dark  
Seen all the wonders of the world but Ive never seen a smile  
As beautiful as yours  
I thought Id been everywhere Ive climbed a mountain so high  
Sailed the sea crossed the sky and still I was nowhere at all  
Until that day oh you came to my senses  
And your smile it made sense out of it all  
I have seen the bluest skies rainbows that would make you cry  
I have seen miracles that moved my soul days that changed my life  
I have seen the brightest stars shine like diamonds in the dark  
Seen all the wonders of the world but Ive never seen a smile  
As beautiful as ours  
So beautiful comes one time in a lifetime  
A smile this beautiful Ive never dreamed Id ever see  
I have seen the bluest skies rainbows that would make you cry  
Ive seen miracles moved my soul and days that changed my life  
I have seen the brightest stars shine like diamonds in the dark  
Oh Ive seen the wonders of this world but Ive never seen a smile  
So beautiful oh Ive never seen a smile before as beautiful as yours
