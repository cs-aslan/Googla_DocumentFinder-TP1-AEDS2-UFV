I can see her slowly walking  
Through the empty streets of morning  
Who shes with I cannot tell  
His face fades with the others  
In the endless spell of dreams I know so well  
  
Though she walks with him no more with me  
And I know shes where she wants to be  
Her happiness is there for all to see  
But I find that I still wish it was for me  
  
I can hear her voice still ringing  
Through the empty songs I sing  
And it seems that all the words I find  
To say the things that crowd my mind  
Only bring me closer  
To the things Id rather leave behind  
  
Though I know the games been played  
And I know the mistakes Ive made  
I know I shouldnt be afraid  
To love for love for any time at all  
Is worth the price you pay to fall
