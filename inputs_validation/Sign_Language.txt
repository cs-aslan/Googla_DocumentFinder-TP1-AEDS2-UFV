Im not hungry I eat  
When Im tired I cant sleep  
When Im nervous I speak  
It seems the only thing to do  
In the morning I rise  
Wipe the dream from my eyes  
Contemplate your demise  
Theres just no getting through  
  
Always dream dont apologize  
Life is sweet never close your eyes  
The truth it seems must have passed you by  
At least a million times  
  
Gimme a sign gimme a reason to be here  
Im leading the blind when will you make your motives clear  
Gimme a sign gimme gimme gimme a sign  
After all this time why cant we get it right  
  
So you made me a creep ow  
Im not losing any sleep ow  
Cause my scars are much too deep ow  
Dont start getting precious on me yeah  
  
In the morning I rise  
While your life is paralyzed  
In the sweet smell of disguise  
Theres just no getting through to you  
  
Always dream dont apologize  
Life is sweet never close your eyes  
The truth it seems must have passed you by  
At least a million times  
  
Gimme a sign gimme a reason to be here  
Im out of my mind so shallow and always insincere  
Gimme a sign gimme gimme gimme a sign  
After all this time why cant we get it right

Another drive by love affair  
Why dont you tell someone who cares  
If you care  
  
Gimme a sign gimme a reason to be here  
Im out of my mind when will you make your motives clear
