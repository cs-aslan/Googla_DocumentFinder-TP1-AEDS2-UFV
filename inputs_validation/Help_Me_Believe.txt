I just want to write you a letter I have to be very honest with you right
now  
I dont really know how to say this   
  
I wanna believe  
But Im having a hard time seeing past what I see right now I see right now  
I wanna be free  
But when I try to fly I realize I dont know how no one showed me how  
Wish I could see that this mess Im in will really work out for my good you
said it would  
So if you can hear me can you give me a sign cause I dont feel you like I
should please if you Could  
My faith is almost gone I cant hold on much longer take this cup from me  
  
Chorus  
Help me believe  
Can I believe  
Let me believe  
I wanna believe  
Im no good on my own please give me another chance  
Its hard to believe in what I cant see  
To give you my will cause youre whats better for  
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe believe believe believe  
  
I want you to know  
I wanna believe  
If I never hear Im sorry I can let it go gotta let you go  
Cause its killing me Jesus you know how it feels cause youve been hurt
before dont wanna hurt No more  
Im trying to hear you speak but my heart is growing weaker take this cup
from me  
  
Help me believe  
Can I believe  
Let me believe  
I wanna believe  
Ive been here before and cant take that hurt again  
Its hard to believe in what I cant see  
To give you my will cause youre whats better for  
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe believe believe believe  
  
Believe  
Believe  
  
I wanna believe when I close my eyes on this side Ill wake up with you more
in love with you  
And and finally you will say my race it is over and my work is through
cause I believed in you  
I know dark nights will come and some days therell be no sunshine and youre
too far to see  
  
Help me believe  
Can I believe  
Let me believe  
I wanna believe  
Im no good on my own please give me another chance  
Its hard to believe in what I cant see  
To give you my will cause youre whats better for  
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe believe believe believe
