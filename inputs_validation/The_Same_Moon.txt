When the daylight comes and I look across the room  
I see youre gone  
As the morning breaks and I reach to hold your hand  
I can see see Im the only one  
Well your clothes are gone and your bags are packed  
But the beds still warm where you lay  
Now I need your love to come shining through  
To carry me come carry me away  
  
If you choose a time Ill catch the moon  
Ill see you there  
From wherever I am wherever you are  
Well find somewhere  
I see the same stars in the same sky  
Shining down on you  
Ill be looking up from wherever I am  
And its you Ill see if youre looking too  
  
Therell be days thatll seem much longer  
Some nights will seem so cold  
And its gotta come soon  please dont be too long  
Dont be too long  
  
If you choose a time we can catch the moon  
Ill see you there  
Whenever it is from wherever you are  
Oh well find yes well find somewhere  
Are you looking at the same moon
