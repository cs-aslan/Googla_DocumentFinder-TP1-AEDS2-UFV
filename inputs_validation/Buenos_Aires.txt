Whats new Buenos Aires  
Im new I want to say Im just a little stuck on you  
Youll be on me too  
  
I get out here Buenos Aires  
Stand back you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me  
Just a little touch of star quality  
  
Fill me up with your heat with your noise  
With your dirt overdo me  
Let me dance to your beat make it loud  
Let it hurt run it through me  
Dont hold back you are certain to impress  
Tell the driver this is where Im staying  
  
Hello Buenos Aires  
Get this just look at me dressed up somewhere to go  
Well put on a show  
  
Take me in at your flood give me speed  
Give me lights set me humming  
Shoot me up with your blood wine me up  
With your nights watch me coming  
All I want is a whole lot of excess  
Tell the singer this is where Im playing

Just a little touch of star quality  
  
And if ever I go too far  
Its because of the things you are  
Beautiful town I love you  
And if I need a moments rest  
Give your lover the very best  
Real eiderdown and silence  
  
musical interlude  
Youre a tramp youre a treat  
You will shine to the death you are shoddy  
But youre flesh you are meat  
You shall have every breath in my body  
Put me down for a lifetime of success  
Give me credit Ill find ways of paying
