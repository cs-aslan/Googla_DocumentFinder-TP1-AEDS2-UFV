I call you and you call me  
Its funny how we get on so easily  
Were just friends arent we  
Youve got yours Ive got mine  
And friends are all we ever could be  
  
But Were getting to know each other  
A little too well  
Getting to know each other  
A little too well  
Were starting to show our feelings  
And people can tell  
 Ooh people can tell  
Every time that your eyes meet mine  
  
I light up like a neon sign  
Yes Were getting to know each other  
A little too well  
Getting to know each other  
A little too well  
  
We have lunch evry now and then  
And I find myself humming love songs  
Again and again  
Too many nights Im workin till ten  
And I hope that you know  
That Its hopeless to go on when  
Repeat chorus except last line  
Getting to know each other  
Getting to know each other  
A little too well  
Getting to know each other  
A little too well
