This is what its like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when its all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
  
First of all theres no one to talk to  
When there is they just dont seem to hear  
Words dont seem to matter much anyway  
They cant describe the pain  
They cant explain the fear  
  
Then the nights grow cold and hard to live through  
Still you hate to see the morning come  
Somehow tomorrow doesnt matter much anymore  
The future holds no promise  
Your lifes already done  
  
This is what its like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when its all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
  
The you find your heart no longer flutters  
You no longer look through a lovers eyes  
Whats to see when the world falls down around you  
You simply cant believe it  
But it comes as no surprise  
  
This is what its like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when its all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
  
Whats the sense of failure  
Its such an incredible loss  
Its all the things youll never do  
And all the dreams that will never come true  
  
This is what its like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when its all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
Oh this is just the way a true love ends  
I dont believe a true love ever ends
