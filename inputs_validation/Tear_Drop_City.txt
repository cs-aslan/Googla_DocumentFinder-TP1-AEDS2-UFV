About as low as I felt in a long time  
And I know that I did a wrong at the wrong time  
Its plain to see shes down on me  
And I know shell feel that way for a long time  
  
I was high on top but I didnt know it  
Tell me why did I have to go and blow it  
I used my lines too many times  
And now Ive got a badly hurt heart to show it  
  
Took me too long to discover  
How much I really love her  
Howd I ever end up in this bind  
What a drag  
  
There she goes looking for pretty clover  
No one knows what its like until it over  
Without a doubt I just found out  
And I suppose I never did get to know her  
  
Tear drop city Tear drop city  
Took me to long to discover  
How much I really love her  
Howd I ever end up in this bind  
What a drag  
  
About as low as I felt in a long time
