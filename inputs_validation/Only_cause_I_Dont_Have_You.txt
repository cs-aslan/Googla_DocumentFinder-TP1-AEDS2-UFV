Turn off the music  
Take down the signs  
Pack up the boxes  
Put away the wine  
No toast for the future  
No reward for the find  
  
If looks could kill  
This mirror would do  
Only cause I dont have you  
  
Dont bother with ovations  
Leave off the fanfare  
Let the candles melt down  
Till the smokes all thats there  
Leave the veil in place  
A tear la mer  
I could say it was nothing  
Now that theres nothing new  
Only cause I dont have you  
  
Not built on a wisp or whim  
Twist an arm break a leg  
Tear me limb from limb  
If theres a point youve made it  
If theres a fare Ive paid it  
  
Later on good wishes  
Later on good try  
Im afraid wont do  
Its not justified  
You go from the privy  
And you end up deprived  
On top of the world  
But still theres no view  
Only cause I dont have you
