Wait a minute  
Lets try something different  
This is Luther  
With the masters at work  
  
Last night I had some trouble sleeping  
  
Are you are you are you using me  
Are you are you are you using me  
Are you are you are you using me  
Are you are you are you using me  
  
No more will I let it be  
You called his name out in your sleep  
Youre doing things so suspiciously  
And I think that youre using me yeah  
  
Dont hang on me for security  
Love is never free  
Are you using me  
  
Are you are you are you using me  
Are you are you are you using me  
Are you are you are you using me  
Are you are you are you using me  
  
You pretended like we were friends  
I was blinded by sentiment  
You complicated what love should be  
And I could swear that youre using me  
  
I keep seeing things I shouldnt see  
Ive been watchin you  
Are you using me  
  
Are you are you  
Are you using me  
  
Listen talk to me talk to me talk to me  
Ooh come on now and talk to me talk to me  
Hey talk to me talk to me  
Hey talk to me talk to me  
  
For my money for my money  
For my money for my money  
For my money for my money  
Tell the truth  
For my money for my money  
  
Are you are you are you using me  
Are you are you are you using me  
Are you are you are you using me  
Are you are you are you using me  
  
For my body for my body  
For my body for my body  
For my body for my body  
For my body for my body  
  
Dont hang on to me for security  
Love is never free tell me are you  
  
Using using me using are you using me  
Using using me using are you using me  
  
I keep seeing things I should not see

One time one time Its my desire  
Dont be such a liar
