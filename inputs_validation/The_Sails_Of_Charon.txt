Dark night there is no light  
In the realm of the black magic man  
Souls flight into the cold blight  
Of the destroyers magic land  
Poor man whose spirits are stronger  
Theyre a little too weary  
Youre starting to  
  
Blind man youre suckin your own blood  
Soon black magics dying  
Youd better start crying  
Blind man youre suckin your own blood  
Soon black magics dying  
Youd better start crying  
  
Throw out your evil desire  
The dark kings kingdom is  
Made out of mire  
  
Throw out your evil desire  
The dark kings kingdom is  
Made out of mire  
  
Keep on for the kingdom of light  
There is no darkness there is no night
