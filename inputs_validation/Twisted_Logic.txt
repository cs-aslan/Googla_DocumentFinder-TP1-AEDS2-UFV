Sunlight opened up my eyes  
To see for the first time  
It opened them up  
And tonight rivers will run dry  
But not for the first time  
Rivers will run  
  
Hundreds of years in the future  
There could be computers  
Looking for life on Earth  
Dont fight for the wrong side  
Say what you feel like  
Say how you feel  
  
Youll go backwards but then  
Youll go forwards again  
Youll go backwards but then  
Youll go  
  
Created then drilled and invaded  
If somebody made it  
Someone will mess it up  
And you are not wrong to  
Ask who does this belong to  
It belongs to all of us  
  
Youll go backwards again  
Youll go forwards again  
Youll go backwards again  
Youll go forwards  
  
Youll go backwards but then  
Youll go forwards again  
Youll go backwards but then  
Youll go forwards
