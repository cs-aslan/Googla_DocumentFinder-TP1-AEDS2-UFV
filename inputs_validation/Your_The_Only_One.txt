I know its gonna take some time  
For you to trust this love of mine  
I know he broke your heart in two  
Youve been betrayed and  your afraid  
That I will do the same to you  
  
But youll be safe here in my arms  forever and a day  
Though you dont believe me now  Ill never walk away  
You  You know that Ill be there  when tomorrow comes  
  
 Your the only one   
I know youve heard this all before  
 Your the only one   
Your the one that I adore  
 Your the only one   
You make me shine just like the sun  
 Your the only one   
You bring this heart of mine undone  
 Your the only one   
  
For evry Lie youve ever heard  
You can believe my every word yes you can  
Whatever heaven holds in store  
Through good and bad  Ill be your man  
Stand beside you through it all  
  
But youll be safe here in my arms  forever and a day  
Though you dont believe me now  Ill never walk away  
And you  you know that Ill be there  when tomorrow comes  
  
 Your the only one   
I know youve heard this all before  
 Your the only one   
Your the one that I adore  
 Your the only one   
You make me shine just like the sun  
 Your the only one   
You bring this heart of mine undone  
 Your the only one   
  
I know youve heard this all before  
 Your the only one   
But your the one that I adore  
 Your the only one   
You make me shine just like the sun  
 Your the only one   
You bring this heart of mine undone  
 Your the only one   
  
 Your the only one   
  
Make me shine just like the sun  yes you do  
  
 Your the only one
