She was still just a baby in her mamas eyes  
Daddys little girl only yesterday oh my how time flies  
She learned all about romance from watching tv  
And in one night alone with the boy down the street  
  
Child With child mother to be  
Carryin a secret she know she cant keep  
Child With child lying awake  
Thinking about all the hearts she will break  
  
Will her friends all whisper when she passes by  
Will there be shame or love in her daddys eyes  
She can run from her hometown but she cant run away  
From the new life inside her growing each day  
  
Child With child Mother to be  
Carryin a secret she knows she cant keep  
Child With child lying awake  
Thinking about all the hearts she will break  
  
Shes just a child with child
