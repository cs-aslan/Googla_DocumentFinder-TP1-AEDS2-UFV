Ooh well I got a girl with a record machine  
When it comes to rockin shes the queen  
We love to dance on a Saturday night  
All alone where I can hold her tight  
But she lives on the twentiest floor uptown  
The elevators broken down  
  
So I walked one two flight three flight four  
Five six seven flight eight flight more  
Up on the twelfth I started to drag  
Fifteenth floor Im aready to sag  
Get to the top Im too tired to rock  
  
When she calls me up on the telephone  
Say come on over honey Im all alone  
I said baby youre mighty sweet  
But Im in bed with the achin feet  
This went on for a couple of days  
But I couldnt stay away  
  
Well they sent to Chicago for repairs  
Till its afixed Im ausin the stairs  
Hope they hurry up before its too late  
Want my baby too much to wait  
All this climbin is agettin me down  
Theyll find my corpse draped over a rail  
But I climbed one two flight three flight four
