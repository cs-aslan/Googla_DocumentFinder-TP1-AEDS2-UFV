The years have been so good to you and I my friend  
They brought us to the Autumn wind and left the tears behind  
And whod have dreamed that love could grow so endlessly  
And youd have meant so much to me is it already time  
  
And I will always love you so  
Well hold each other close until its time to go  
And we believed we had forever on our side  
Is it already time  
  
And I will always love you so  
Well hold each other close until its time to go  
And we believed we had forever on our side  
Is it already time  
  
And we believed we had forever on our side  
Is it already time
