Well Ive got this feeling in the back of my head  
I feel like making someones face turn red  
Learning bikes and ditto vices  
Try to look bored and your going places  
  
We are the vegetables  
We are the vegetables  
We are the vegetables  
We are the vegetables  
  
Some music is playing by metal gazers  
Its gone through the stage where everyone makes it  
Do you think that were not good  
All I really know is I think you should  
  
We are the vegetables  
We are the vegetables  
We are the vegetables  
We are the vegetables  
  
Well Ive got this feeling in the back of my head

We are the vegetables  
We are the
