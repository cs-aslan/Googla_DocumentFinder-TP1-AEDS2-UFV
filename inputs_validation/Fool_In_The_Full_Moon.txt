Ive been following women all afternoon  
  
dont turn around  
  
too soon  
  
Ive been following you all afternoon  
  
following you a fool in the full moon  
  
somethings got a hold on me when I get a hold of you  
  
following women  
  
after dark  
  
nobody knows whats in my heart  
  
let your loving be  
  
Im a lechery  
  
I do not spread leprosy  
  
I will not touch but let me see  
  
my buildings burning down and i cannot breathe  
  
following you  
  
who wont believe  
  
perfect peace I cannot perceive  
  
when Im following you Im a fool in the full moon
