I guess its somethin in my brain  
I need whiskey to ease the pain  
But its early in the mornin  
And Im feelin bad again  
  
But if you ever loved me  
Youll go easy on me now  
Fix me up a cup of coffee  
And in a while Ill come around  
  
I think I spent the dogfood money  
But hell love me just the same  
And if you really love me baby  
Help me scrape the mucus off my brain  
  
Its a shame when morning hurts  
Ive seen bad and Ive seen worse  
Its the nature of my bein  
I took some money from your purse  
  
Nthat Frenchman loves to party  
And I know hes not to blame  
But the way youre lookin at me baby  
I just cant help but feel the shame  
  
I think I spent the dogfood money  
But hell love me just the same  
And if you really love me baby  
Help me scrape the mucus off my brain  
  
And if you really love me baby  
Help me scrape the mucus off my brain
