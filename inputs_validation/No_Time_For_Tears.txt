This is no time for tears  
Though our hearts are bleeding  
One for all and all for one for freedom  
  
A bird flies across the sea  
Free as his brother where is the freedom  
Weve been dreaming of for so long  
  
Oh brother waiting is so long  
Life is soon over it cant be wrong  
To cast off chains that still bind us  
Let death remind us we can be strong  
  
Sister dont let me down please dont forsake me  
One for all and all for one for freedom today  
One for all and all for one means freedom today
