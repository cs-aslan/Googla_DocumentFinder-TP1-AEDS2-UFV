Its time to slow it down steadily grinding  
And this is the big Doggy Dogg  
  
And I aint talking about no Air Force Ones  
I just gotta know before you let me get some  
  
Chorus  
Do you have a fresh pair of panties on  
I got to know or you could show me  
Silk cotton seethrough lace your sexy thong  
I got to know or you could show me  
  
Snoop Dogg  
Freakaleek peak peak  
Let a nigga sneak a few peekaboo  
Lets see what we can do  
Im bout freaking you and sneaking you  
Into a quiet place  
So I can look at it face to face  
Let me guess you prefer to wear cotton  
I can tell cause you like squatting  
Your last dude he was so rotten  
And now your love is to be gotten  
Yeah baby girl I can read your mind  
But what Im really trying to do is ready between your pantylines  
I know it seems oh so personal  
But Im just trying to make you feel real comfortable  
I know so what will it be  
And the type of underwear you wear I mean its troubling me  
Can I get a glimpse one for the pimps  
I got one question answer me this then  
  
Chorus  
  
Snoop Dogg  
You came by the chuuch with a whole lot of body  
Got invited to our annual pajama party  
Working that lace I think it was the French cut  
Yeah bitch you got a big ol butt  
Hiding it should be dividing it  
Its real tight now but I got a way to widen it  
And slide in it real smooth like  
with a little bit of Miles Davis to get you in the mood like  
zoom boom hit the poompoom right  
Just to get your groove right  
I can make it happen but it cant happen if you aint good at it  
When you goin let a nigga have a look at it  
Calling all cars yeah baby girl you a star  
But its on you if you want to go real far  
Now let me get a glimpse one for the pimps  
I have one question answer me this  
  
Chorus
