Please believe in me  
Though my love is hard to see  
Now shes gone Shes gone shes gone shes gone  
Ill remain Shes gone shes gone shes gone  
But these tears Shes gone shes gone shes gone  
I cant contain Shes gone shes gone  
So can I count on you to be my light to guide me  
Right through the night beside me  
Is it all right to count on you  
Smile away these blues  
I dont care if Im accused  
Now shes gone Shes gone shes gone shes gone  
I dont mind Shes gone shes gone shes gone  
But I got a feelin Shes gone shes gone shes gone  
Its all designed Shes gone shes gone  
To make me call on you to be my light to guide me  
Right through the night beside me  
Is it all right to call on you
