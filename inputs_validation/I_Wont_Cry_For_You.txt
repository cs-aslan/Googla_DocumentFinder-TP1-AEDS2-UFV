So you lie awake and think about tomorrow  
And you try to justify the things youve done  
But theres no one here to hear your tears falling  
When you turn around you find out that youre the lonely one  
  
And it feels like someones treading on your shadow  
And you always thought that Heaven knows for sure  
And it feels like youre drowning in your tears  
  
So I wont cry for you no I aint gonna cry for you  
And I aint gonna lie for you no I aint gonna cry for you  
Aint gonna cry for you  
  
So you lie awake and think about the sorrow  
Does it really still the fears in your mind  
And you try to realise the things you wanted  
But you take it all for granted and now it makes you blind  
  
And it feels like someones treading on your shadow  
And you always thought that Heaven knows for sure  
And it feels like youre drowning in your tears  
  
So I aint gonna cry for you no I aint gonna die for you  
And I aint gonna lie for you no I aint gonna cry for you  
Aint gonna cry  
  
I aint gonna cry for you I aint gonna cry  
  
So I aint gonna cry for you no I aint gonna die for you  
No I aint gonna lie for you no I aint gonna cry for you  
Aint gonna cry aint gonna cry for you no more  
Aint gonna die I aint gonna die for no more  
Aint gonna lie I aint gonna lie for no more  
  
Aint gonna cry I aint gonna cry for you no more
