Im really close tonight  
And I feel like Im moving inside her  
Lying in the dark  
An I think that Im beginning to know her  
Let it go  
Ill be there when you call  
  
And whenever I fall at your feet  
You let your tears rain down on me  
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain  
  
Youre hiding from me now  
Theres something in the way that youre talking  
Words dont sound right  
But I hear them all moving inside you  
Go Ill be waiting when you call  
  
And whenever I fall at your feet  
You let your tears rain down on me  
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain  
  
The finger of blame has turned upon itself  
And Im more than willing to offer myself  
Do you want my presence or need my help  
Who knows where that might lead  
  
I fall  
Whenever I fall at your feet  
You let your tears rain down on me  
Whenever I fall  
Whenever I fall
