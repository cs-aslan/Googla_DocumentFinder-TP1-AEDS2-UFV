In my home town for anyone who sticks around  
Youre either lost or youre found  
Theres not much in between  
In my home town everythings still black and white  
Its a long long way from wrong to right  
From Sunday morning to Saturday night  
  
Everybody just wants to get high  
Sit and watch a perfect world go by  
Were all looking for love and meaning in our lives  
We follow the roads that lead us  
To drugs or Jesus  
  
My whole life Ive tried to run Ive tried to hide  
From the stainedglass windows in my mind  
Refusing to let Gods light shine down on me down on me  
Everybody just wants to get high  
Sit and watch a perfect world go by  
Were all looking for love and meaning in our lives  
Theres not much space between us  
Drugs or Jesus  
  
Everybody wants acceptance we all just want some proof  
Everyones just looking for the truth  
Everybody just wants to get high  
Sit and watch a perfect world go by  
Were all looking for love and meaning in our lives  
We follow the roads that lead us  
To drugs or Jesus  
Oh I need you Jesus  
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah
