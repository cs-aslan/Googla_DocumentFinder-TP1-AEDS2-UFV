Theres not a day  
I dont think of your name  
The state that Im in  
Youre completely to blame  
No words left to say  
Turn my dreams all to grey  
And Im more and more lost without you  
  
Youre a storm in my head  
That really blew a new day  
A liquid design  
Is what you do to my mind  
No words left to say  
Cause my minds gone away  
And Im more and more lost without you  
  
More and more lost without you  
I was found but then I totally lost you  
Dont know a soul that could ever doubt you  
Thats why Im more and more lost without you  
  
More and more
