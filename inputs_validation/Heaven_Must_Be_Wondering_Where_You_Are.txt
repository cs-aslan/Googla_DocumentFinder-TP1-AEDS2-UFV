Some where up there beyond the blue  
Surely by now somebodys missin you  
I found the angel they must be lookin for  
Heaven must be wondering where you are  
  
When I look into your eyes  
Its so plain to see  
Nothin here on earth describes what you mean to me  
Out of this world when I hold you in my arms  
Heaven must be wondering where you are  
  
Lucky me to be the one to find  
Someone like you this side of paradise  
I know how lost Id be without here sweetheart  
Heaven must be wondering where you are  
  
Some where up there beyond the blue  
Surely by now somebodys missin you  
I found the angel they must be lookin for  
Heaven must be wondering where you are  
  
I found the angel they must be lookin for  
Heaven must be wondering where you are
