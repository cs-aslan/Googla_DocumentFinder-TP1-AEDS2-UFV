Baby we been knowing each other for a long  
long time for somethin like this to just go and break up everything  
  
Here we are just sittin here  
Knowin were all alone  
My Rolleys lookin at me  
Sayin its time to get it on  
You know what I want  
And baby I know what you need  
So stop hesitatin girl  
And give your love to me  
  
Chorus  
All I really want is to love you babe  
Make your body feel like heaven babe  
I just wanna satisfy ya babe  
Thats all I want thats all I want  
I just wanna give ya somethin babe  
Just wanna keep it comin babe  
I just wanna make you happy babe  
Thats all I want thats all I want  
  
Though the fireplace is burnin marshmallows just right  
To who it may concern  
You wont be comin home tonight  
Body parts that he DONT kiss  
Girl I will kiss for you  
Just put this CD on the repeat  
And let me pamper you  
  
Chorus  
  
Now the swimmin pools out back  
Come on and skinny dip baby  
Eat breakfast in the morning  
Thatll be complements of me  
In the middle of the night  
Theres no need for morning here  
So hold your pillow tight  
Cause I wanna do it again and again  
  
Chorus  
  
Til the sun comes up  
Baby well be makin love  
And when the sun goes down  
Still we wont have enough  
Take this love to you  
I will take care of all you need  
Baby lets asure  
I just wanna set you free free  
  
Chorus Repeats
