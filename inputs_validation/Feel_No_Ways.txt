Verse  
I should be downtown whipping on the way to you  
You got something that belongs to me  
Your body language says it all  
Despite the things you said to me  
Who is it thats got you all gassed up  
Changing your opinion on me  
I was only gone for the last few months  
But you dont have the time to wait on me  
  
Hook  
I try with you  
Theres more to life than sleeping in  
And getting high with you  
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do  
And that just didnt sit right with you  
And now youre trying to make me feel a way on purpose  
Now youre throwing it back in my face on purpose  
Now youre talking down on my name on purpose yeah  
And you dont feel no way you think I deserve it  
Worlds worlds worlds famous  
Worlds worlds worlds famous

Instead of the other way
