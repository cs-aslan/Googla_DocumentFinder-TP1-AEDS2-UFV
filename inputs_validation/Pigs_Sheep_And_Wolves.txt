Big and fat  
Pigs supposed to look like that  
Barnyard thug  
Sleeps on straw and calls it a rug  
Yeah thats a rug OK  
Hes walking down the street  
And nobodys gonna argue with him  
Hes a halfaton of pig meat  
  
Up in the hills above the farm  
Lives a pack of wolves  
Never did no harm  
Sleep all day  
Hunt till four  
Maybe catch a couple of rodents  
You know carnivore  
  
Sheep in the meadow  
Nibbling on some clover  
One of the sheep wanders over  
Sits by a rock  
Separated from the flock  
Hes just sitting by a rock  
  
Whered he go  
I dont know  
Well he was here a minute ago  
I dont know  
Sheeps dead  
Got a gash as big as a wolfs head  
Oh God  
  
Big and fat  
Pigs supposed to look like that  
Wallowing in lanolin  
Hes rubbing it into his pigskin  
Police going crazy

Lets get that wolf  
Lets get him  
Lets get that wolf  
Lets get him  
Lets kill him lets get him

Courtappointed lawyer wasnt very bright  
Oh maybe he was bright  
Maybe he just had a late night  
Yeah it was just a late night  
And he files some feeble appeal  
And the governor says forget it  
Its a done deal  
Election I dont care election  
Lets give that wolf a lethal injection  
Lets get him yeah get him  
Lets kill him lets get him  
Lets kill him lets get him kill him  
Lets get him and kill him

Setting up their camera  
Asking everyones opinion  
About pigs sheep and wolves  
  
Big and fat  
Pigs supposed to laugh like that  
This is hilarious  
What a great time  
Im the pig who committed  
The perfect crime

Protesting this behavior  
Its animal behavior  
Animal behavior  
Its pigs sheep and wolves
