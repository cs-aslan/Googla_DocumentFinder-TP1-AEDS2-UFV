So youve made up your mind  
Youre tired of trying  
Time to be scared  
And you wanted to fly  
You cant close your eyes  
Time to beware  
  
But if you believe in the world Im calling  
And if you belong in the world I saw  
And if you believe in the world Im calling  
Youll be strong  
  
So you wasted your time  
You willed it goodbye  
Time to be scared  
You thought you could buy  
Your last piece of mind  
Time to beware  
  
But if you believe in the world Im calling  
And if you belong in the world I saw  
And if you believe in the world Im calling  
Youll be strong  
  
But if you believe in the world Im calling  
And if you belong in the world I saw  
And if you believe in the world Im calling  
Youll be strong
