A tramp found dead in the street just made the news  
Forensics report read drug abuse  
Found a warehouse slip in his sleeve  
Marine corps major downatheel  
  
They got to the place unlocked the shed  
Soon left awestruck stunned amazed  
Among stuff and things lay pledges and bonds  
Up to a few Mil in the end  
  
The sage the fool the sinner  
And what goes for you one cant ever say  
The sage the fool the sinner  
  
One cant foretell fate no way no way  
  
Sassy lady puts on her fav heels  
Mirror checked all done  snow white appeal  
Adjust the dress ready to leave  
Grab some cash cabs outside wipe off a tear  
  
On her way out she turns once more  
To wave her man good  bye  
While in his sleep he recalls thirty years  due to end that night
