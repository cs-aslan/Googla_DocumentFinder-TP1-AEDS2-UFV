All the girls and boys have gone away  
They never really had much to say  
They took off all their clothes and their shoes  
Politely asked to be excused  
  
Theyre the children on parade  
They have a secret they can share  
Theyre the children on parade  
And nobody knows  
And nobody knows  
  
All the broken toys lie on the floor  
Theres no more laughter from down the hall  
Mirror mirror mirror on the wall  
Whatever could have happened to them all  
  
Theyre the children on parade  
They have a secret that they share  
Theyre the children on parade  
And nobody knows  
And nobody knows  
  
All across the world just yesterday  
All the boys and girls just went away  
They left without their clothes or their shoes  
Id love to someday hear all the news  
  
About the children on parade  
And all the secrets that they share  
Now theyre the children on parade  
And nobody knows
