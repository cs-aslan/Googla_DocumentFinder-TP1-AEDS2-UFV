Hello its me its me  
Calling out I can see you  
Hello its me crying out crying out  
Are you there  
  
Hello its me its me  
I want to touch you  
Its me throwing stones from the stars  
On your mixed up world  
  
Been circling round for twenty years  
And in that time Ive seen all the fires and all the liars  
Ive been calling home for twenty years  
And in that time I heard the screams rebound to me  
While you were making history  
  
I could see the fire  
And Ill throw the fire back down
