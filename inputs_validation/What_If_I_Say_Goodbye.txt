What if I say I love you  
Would it mean as much as it used to  
Could it help the hurt that were putting us through  
What if I said goodbye  
  
What if tomorrow you wake up  
And Im not around what you break up  
Would you take one towards me to make up  
What if I said goodbye  
  
What would you do if I did what I should have done long ago  
Is there someone youd turn to as soon as I left  
Someone you already know  
  
What if I say I love you  
Would you want to make up like I do  
Could we possibly salvage the dreams we knew  
What if I said goodbye  
  
What would you do if I did what I should have done long ago  
Is there someone youd turn to as soon as I left  
Someone you already know  
  
What if I say I love you  
Would it mean as much as used to  
Could it help the hurt that were putting us through  
What if I said goodbye
