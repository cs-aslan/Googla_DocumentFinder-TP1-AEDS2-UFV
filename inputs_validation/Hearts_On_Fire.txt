In life there are those decisions  
Which direction you should take  
Its only later that you realize  
All those simple mistakes you make  
I dont like being alone  
Dont want to be by myself  
But since youve gone thats all I can think of  
I cant think of nothing else  
  
Oh I said Im sorry soon I give it up  
You know Im sorry soon I give it up  
You know Im sorry soon I give it up  
Cause my hearts on fire  
My hearts on fire  
  
Whoa can you take me there  
Oh come back and take me there  
Cause I need to be with you  
Be there with you  
  
Yes there is no denying  
Our love is not untrue  
I know Ive lied so many times before  
But deep down theres only you  
I need you here by my side  
Together our love could grow  
But first you have to believe that I want you  
More than youll ever know  
  
Whoa I said Im sorry and I give it up give it up  
You know Im sorry soon I give it up give it up  
You know Im sorry soon I give it up give it up  
Cause my hearts on fire  
My hearts on fire  
  
Whoa can you take me there  
Oh come back and take me there  
Cause I need to be with you  
Be there with you  
  
Give it up give it up give it up  
With it we take our chances  
What will be will be  
But I dont care what the people may think  
Just as long as youre here with me  
Dont like being alone  
Dont want to be by myself  
And since youve gone well thats all I can think of  
I cant think of nothing else  
  
Whoa I said Im sorry and I give it up give it up  
You know Im sorry soon I give it up give it up  
You know Im sorry soon I give it up  
Cause my hearts on fire  
My hearts on fire  
  
Whoa can you take me there  
Oh come back and take me there  
Cause I need to be with you  
Be there with you  
You be there with you  
  
Hearts on fire  
Hearts on fire  
Hearts on fire  
My hearts on fire  
Hearts on fire hearts on fire
