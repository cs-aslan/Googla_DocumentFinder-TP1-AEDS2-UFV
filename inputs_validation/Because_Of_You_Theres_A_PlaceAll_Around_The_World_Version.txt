Theres a place where the streets shine  
With the glory of the Lamb  
Theres a way we can go there  
We can live there be on time  
  
Because of You because of You  
Because of Your love because of Your blood  
  
No more pain no more sadness  
No more suffering no more tears  
No more sin no more sickness  
No injustice no more death  
  
Because of You because of You  
Because of Your love because of Your blood  
  
Oh our sins are washed away  
And we can live forever  
Now we have this hope  
Because of You  
  
Oh well see You face to face  
And well dance together  
In the city of our God  
Because of You  
True true true

Therell be gladness therell be peace  
Therell be wine ever flowing
