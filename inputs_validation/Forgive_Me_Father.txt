Fabolous  
Yea  
Theres a lot of money over here  
Ha Ha  
Thats word to Brooklyn  
Im back I dont know what the fuck is wrong with these niggas  
  
Maybe cause Im eating And these bastards fiend for my grub  
I carry pumps like I serve gasoline to these scrubs  
Have you seen my Aston leaning on dubs  
And they cant afford chrome so they putting Vaseline on they hubs  
Im looking for a girl with a ass like Trina to rub  
Take home and let her watch the plasma screen in the tub  
These niggas hate Im moving so much cash and cream in the club  
And dont pass my green on my bub  
But Im a fly niggag that dont do much to pull her and dick her  
Everyday Im popping a tab and pulling a sticker  
Everyday Im switching the tags and pulling up sicker  
Every K Im loading the mags with bullets to flicker  
And I aint hesitating homie Im pulling it quicker  
So you can act tough After a few pulls on some liquor  
Got em pullin on niggas  
And they wont be goin nowhere for a while  
They might as well pull out a snicker YeYeYea  
  
Chorus  
Forgive me father for I have sinned  
But look at all this money that I spend  
And look at all this jewelry that Im in  
And look at all the places that Ive been  
And look at all the women in those brims  
Look at the blue flames that Im in  
I look at all the bullshit that theres been  
And if I had another chance Id do it again  
  
Anywhere the kid move you know the hammersll be with me  
Poking out the shirt like a Pamela Lee titty  
I went on tour brought the samples of D wit me  
Came back a month later bought a Lambo for threefifty  
Think I throw you grams if you read with me  
Just because you see me on the camera with P Diddy  
Dammit we Pdriddy Now I got G with me  
Along with the third leg that I be rammin in these bitties  
I keep the revolver you hope my gunll jam  
But with the soap its gonna blam  
The info put freckles on your face like Opie Cunningham  
Thats why Im watched by the Feds and scoped by Uncle Sam  
Dope and hunned hundred grams rope and hunned grams  
At the same time our artist get to open Summer Jam  
Hope you understand or use better sense  
These niggas dont want no beef they want lawsuit settlements Nigga  
  
Chorus  
  
Im in a waggy with em passin by ya  
With a baby girl who suck harder than Maggie on a pacifier  
What Im smokinll have you aggie as your last supplier  
When you can smell it through the bag you know thats some fire  
Getting stressed by these hotties is regular  
I got a magazine to press to your body like editors  
Test me somebody Im begging ya  
I got the Gatling gun like Jesse The Body in Predator  
Im a hustler I dont sling no rocks to the fiends now  
Got dudes who sit on corners like a boxer between rounds  
Any other dude who dish rocks want beef  
Cause I chop jobs bigger than Chris Rock front teef  
Im the nigga tearing the walls up in your miss in exchange for a small cup  
Of the Cris  
And while you at probation filling a small cup full of piss  
Im in a coupe with a roof that ball up like a fist Catch up  
  
Chorus  
  
Thats right Ill do it again nigga yea  
Im a motherfucking ghetto superstar nigga  
Desert Storm Street Family we here yea  
Young Gs Salute yea  
Get this fucking money man  
Its a lot of fucking money over here yea  
I dont know what the fuck you doing yea
