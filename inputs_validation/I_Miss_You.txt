To see you when I wake up  
Is a gift I didnt think could be real  
  
To know that you feel the same as I do  
Is a threefold utopian dream  
  
You do something to me that I cant explain  
So would I be out of line if I said  
I miss you  
  
I see your picture  
I smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine  
  
You have only been gone ten days  
But already Im wasting away  
  
I know Ill see you again  
Whether far or soon  
  
But I need you to know that I care  
And I miss you
