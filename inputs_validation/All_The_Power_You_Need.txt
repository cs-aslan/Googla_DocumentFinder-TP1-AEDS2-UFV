My God can never fail  
Hes beem proved time and again  
Trust Him youll see  
Hes got all the power you need  
  
Hes never early never late  
It takes courage and it takes faith  
Trust Him youll see hes got  
All the power you need  
  
He saves forgives and heals  
He takes back what the devil steals  
My debts paid in full  
And every day He does miracles  
  
God dreams turn them into plans  
Too big for human hands  
Trust Him youll see  
Hes got all the power you need  
  
Hes real Hes real  
Faiths a lot stronger than what you feel  
Hes real Hes real  
Im believing for miracles  
  
Trust Him youll see  
Hes got all the power you need
