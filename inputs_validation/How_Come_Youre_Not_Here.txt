Where have you been  
Where have you gone  
And have I done something wrong  
Youre the tooth fairy  
Youre like Santa Claus  
Youre like white noise  
When I want my favorite song  
  
Just come on back  
And come on home  
It aint super smart to leave me alone  
Light a flare pick up the phone  
Im like a stoner babe without my bong  
  
Are you hiding in the closet  
Are you underneath the bed  
Did you go for a long walk off a short pier  
How come youre not here  
Should I worry youve been bitten  
Or somebody got you high  
Quick come back  
Or I might just die  
How come youre not here  
Ive heard some rumors  
About another girl  
I heard shes cute  
But she stores nuts like a squirrel  
And thats all cool  
Ill wait right here  
Til you get bored  
And she gets carded for beer  
Im the one  
Im just that slick  
You wont find better  
Im honey dipped  
There aint a thing  
Thats fake on me  
I miss you baby  
Come home to me  
  
Are you hiding in the closet  
Are you underneath the bed  
Did you go for a long walk off a short pier  
How come youre not here  
Should I worry youve been bitten  
Or somebody got you high  
Quick come back  
Or I might just die  
How come youre not here  
  
Has anyone seen  
Has anyone seen  
Has anyone seen why hes hiding from me  
Can anyone see  
Can anyone see  
Can anyone see lets play hide and seek  
  
Are you hiding in the closet  
Are you underneath the bed  
Did you go for a long walk off a short pier  
How Come Youre Not Here  
Should I worry youve been bitten  
Or somebody got you high  
Quick come back  
Or I might just die  
Quick come back  
Or I might just die
