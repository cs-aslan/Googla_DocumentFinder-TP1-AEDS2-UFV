Youve left my ring by the soap  
Now is that love  
You cleaned me out you could say broke  
Now is that love  
The better better better it gets  
The more these girls forget  
That that is love  
  
You wont get dressed you walk about  
Now is that is that  
A teasing glance has pushed me out  
Now is that is that  
The tougher tougher tougher it gets  
The more my lips frequent  
Now that is love  
  
Beat me up with your letters your walk out notes  
Funny how you still find me right here at home  
Legs up with a book and a drink  
Now is that love thats making you think  
  
Youve called my bluff Im not so hot  
Now is that love  
My assets froze while yours have dropped  
Now is that is that  
Its the cupid cupid cupid disguise  
That more or less survived  
Now that is love  
  
Beat me up with your letters your walk out notes  
Funny how you still find me right here at home  
Legs up with a book and a drink  
Now is that love thats making you think  
  
Youve made my bed the finger points  
Now is that is that love  
The more you more you more you cool down  
The easier love is found  
Now that is love
