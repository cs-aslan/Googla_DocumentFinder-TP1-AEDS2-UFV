Verse 2 Jeremih  
What you women talkin bout  
I only wanna get up there  
A bad bitch rollin up some good  
Light it up and hand me it  
All I wanna do trouble up  
Extendo doubled up  
Tired as fuck aint no more work  
Ease my mind thats where it hurt  
Pull up in somethin that go skrrt

Feel like Ray J for the purp  
Come and let me hit it first  
Ima pass it if its some gas

Smokin Ivory passin plenty tabs  
Roll the Wood up so it can last
