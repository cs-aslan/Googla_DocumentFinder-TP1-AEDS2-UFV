Bestow upon me knowledge  
Wizard allknowing allwise  
I want to rule my kingdom  
Make sweet the breeze not once defiled  
Dethrone the evil princes iron fists in velvet gloves of sin  
Parade the greyrobed monks the vestal virgins  
And wheel the wyverns in  
Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage  
Let me be the protege of five magics  
  
Give me alchemy  
Give me sorcery  
Give me wizardry  
Thermatology  
Electricity  
  
Master all of these  
Magic if you please  
Bring him to his knees  
I master five magics  
Possessed with hellish torment  
I master magics 5  
Hunting the abyss lord  
Only one will stay alive  
He who lives by the sword will surely also die  
He who lives in sin will surely live the lie
