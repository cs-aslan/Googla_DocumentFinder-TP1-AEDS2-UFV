Yonder shes walking  
She comes my way  
Her red dress on  
Her long black hair  
  
Walking like  
Talking like  
Wanting like  
She comes to me  
  
Oh baby I love you so  
I need you now  
I want you back  
I cant go on  
  
Helpless baby  
Evil child  
Ive known you well  
And if you want to stay  
Thats alright  
Thats alright  
  
And now shes gone  
Shes walking away  
Her red dress on  
Her long black hair  
  
Well I love her so  
And now shell come running  
Anytime I say now  
Anytime I say  
  
Oh baby I love you so  
I need you now  
I want you back  
I cant go on  
  
Oh baby I love you so  
I need you now  
I want you back  
I cant go on  
  
Oh baby I love you so  
I need you now  
I want you back  
I cant go on  
  
I love you so baby  
I need you so  
I want you back  
I cant go on
