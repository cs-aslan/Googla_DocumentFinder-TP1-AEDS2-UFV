Ticket lines and places to dine  
Taking baths and drinkin wine  
People ask I say Im doin fine  
  
Motorcycles and for sure the Eiffel Tower  
They were made for two  
A double bed has never felt so empty  
Whats missing in the world is you  
So Ill leave it in your hands now  
  
To come through  
Ill leave it in your hands now  
To come through  
  
I like climbing the mountain  
Im climbing back in the bed  
I love making breakfast for someone instead of me  
  
Taking autumn walks in Central Park  
They were made for two  
Afternoon naps have never felt so crappy  
Whats missing in my life is you  
So Ill leave it in your hands now  
  
To come through  
Ill leave it in your hands now  
To come through  
Ill leave it in your hands now  
To come through  
Im gonna it in your hands now  
To come through  
  
Its like diving into a pool without water  
And praying for rain  
Well my life is a good life anyway  
What I have will do  
But when youre alone  
Youre living in a world with only choices  
And what I choose is you  
So Ill leave it in your hands now  
  
To come through  
Ill leave it in your hands now  
To come through  
Ill leave it in your hands now  
To come through  
Ill leave it in your hands now  
To come through
