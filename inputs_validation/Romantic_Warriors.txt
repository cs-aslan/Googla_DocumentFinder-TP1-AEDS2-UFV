In the nights of lost and found  
Many strangers are around  
Youre nobody until someone will love you  
You cant make it on your own  
When you standing there alone  
Many heartaches keep the world on turning  
Cause you are fooled by your feeling  
You can pay the price of love  
Give me your hand my love  
Give me your heart  
  
Oh oh oh  
Let me be your lover  
Youre undercover yeah tonight  
Oh oh oh  
Let me be your lover  
Romantic warrior yeah tonight  
  
Oh oh oh  
We are all romantic warriors  
Fighting for your love  
Oh oh oh  
We are all romantic warriors  
Fighting for your heart  
Were fighting for your love  
  
Legends have a broken heart  
Theres someone who tore apart  
Oh there must be more to life than this babe  
Idol love cant last through years  
How can love babe last through years   
Youre surrounded baby oh by strangers  
Come let me be your hero  
And Im fighting for your love  
Give me your hand my love  
Give me your heart
