The flowers you gave me  
Are just about to die  
When I think about  
What couldve been  
It makes me want to cry  
  
The sweet words you whispered  
Didnt mean a thing  
I guess our song is over  
As we begin to sing  
  
Chorus  
Couldve been so beautiful  
Couldve been so right  
Couldve been my lover  
Every day of my life  
Couldve been so beautiful  
Couldve been so right  
Ill never hold what couldve been  
On a cold and lonely night  
  
The memories of our lovin  
Still linger in the air  
Like the faded scent of your roses  
They stay with me everywhere  
  
Every time I get my hopes up  
They always seem to fall  
Still what couldve been is better than  
What could never be at all  
  
Chorus  
  
How could I hold what couldve been  
On a cold and lonely night
