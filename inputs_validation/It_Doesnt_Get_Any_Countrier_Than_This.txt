Now mama I know youve always wished me the best  
And Ive found somebody and I think shes gonna pass the test  
Shes a country girl as far as I can see  
Mama I hope shes what you had in mind for me  
  
She likes to go skinny dippin in the heat of the day  
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay  
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss  
Mama it doesnt get any countrier than this  
  
Now mama I know she didnt grow up on a farm  
But she sure knows her way around out behind the barn  
And it aint exactly chores she does at dawn  
But she says shes gonna run me till the cows come home  
  
She likes to go skinny dippin in the heat of the day  
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay  
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss  
Mama it doesnt get any countrier than this  
  
She likes to go skinny dippin in the heat of the day  
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay  
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss  
Mama it doesnt get any countrier than this  
Yeah mama it doesnt get any countrier than this
