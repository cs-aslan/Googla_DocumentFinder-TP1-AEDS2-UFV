feat Cody Simpson  
  
I dont work hard when its easy  
I put in work when its hard  
Girl they never believed in love until I had yours  
This is more than a season  
And Im not just sprung  
Im not afraid to tell you that youre the one  
But when I wake up thinking bout  
The one that I can run to when Im feeling down  
Life is so good when youre around  
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now  
Cause Ill take you home to mama let you meet my friends  
Cause you dont come with drama  
So I want you till the world ends  
Youre way more than worth it  
But I dont feel like I deserve it  
You got the pieces  
Youre my kind of perfect
