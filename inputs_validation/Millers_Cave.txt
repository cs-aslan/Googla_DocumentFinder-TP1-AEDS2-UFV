Way down in the state of Georgia  
Through the swamps and everglades  
Theres a hole in Tiger Mountain  
God help the man who gets lost in Millers Cave  
  
I had a girl had a girl  
In Waycross Georgia Waycross Georgia but she had unfaithful ways  
Made me feel made me feel I was unwanted so unwanted  
Like the bats and the bears in Millers Cave  
  
I couldnt stand the way she did me  
Couldnt take her low down ways  
Before Id stay with a cheatin woman  
Ill go live the bears in Millers Cave  
  
I caught her out caught her out one Sunday morning Sunday morning  
With a man they call Big Dave  
Meanest man meanest man in Waycross Georgia Waycross Georgia  
Id rather fight a Mountain Lion in Millers Cave  
  
I said youll pay both you and Davey  
I must see you in your grave  
They laughed at me and then I shot em  
I took their cheatin schemin bones to Millers Cave  
  
That woman made woman made me feel unwanted so unwanted  
But I showed em I was brave  
Most wanted man in the state of Georgia  
But theyll never find me cause Im lost in Millers Cave  
  
Dark cold cave Millers Cave
