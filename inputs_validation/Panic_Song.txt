Ready for a cheap escape  
On the brink of self destruction  
Widespread panic  
Broken glass inside my head  
Bleeding down these thoughts of  
Anguish mass confusion  
The world is a sick machine  
Breeding a mass of shit  
With such a desolate conclusion  
Fill the void with I dont care  
Theres a plague inside of me  
Eating at my disposition  
Nothings left  
Torn out of reality  
Into a state of no opinion  
Limp with hate
