Love is a cold wind  
When it blows away from you  
As you watch it go it hurts to know  
Theres nothing you can do  
Youre all alone again  
And love is a cold wind  
Love is a rain storm  
But it only rains on you  
And theres no one there who seems to care  
No one to pull you through  
And inside youre never warm  
Cause love is a rain storm  
But when she was here  
Love was a breezy morning  
Filled with the sun  
Warm as her smile  
But now its done  
Love is a cold wind as it blows away from  
So you find your way to yesterday  
What else is there to do  
Youre all alone again and love is a cold wind  
But when she was here  
Love was abreezy morning  
Filled with the sun  
Warm as her smile  
But now its done  
Love is a cold wind  
As it blows away from you  
As you watch it go  
It hurts to know  
Theres nothing you can do  
And youre all alone again and love is a cold wind  
Youre all alone again and love is a cold wind
