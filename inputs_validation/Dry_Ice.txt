Late last night I had a dream  
And she was in it again  
She and I were in the sky  
Flying hand in hand  
I woke up in a cold sweat  
Wishing she was by my side  
Praying that shell dry tears  
Left on my face Ive cried  
  
Chorus  
Oh I love her  
Keep dreaming of her  
Will I understand  
If she wants to be my friend  
  
Ill send a letter to that girl  
Asking her to be my own  
But my pen is writing wrong  
So Ill say it in a song  
Oh I love you more right now  
More than Ive ever loved before  
Heres those words straight from these lips  
Ill need you forever more  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Come ease the pain thats in my heart Repeats  
  
Late last night I had a dream  
And she was in it again  
She and I were in the sky  
Flying hand in hand  
I woke up in a cold sweat  
Wishing she was by my side  
Praying that shell dry tears  
Left on my face Ive cried  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Come ease the pain thats in my heart Repeats
