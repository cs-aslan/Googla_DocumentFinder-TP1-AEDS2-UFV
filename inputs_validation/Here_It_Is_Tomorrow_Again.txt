See the house lights start to blink  
And the sky is turnin pink  
Gosh what will the neighbors think  
Cause here it is tomorrow again  
  
We could share a perfect day  
But weve danced the night away  
Guess youd better hit the hay  
Cause here it is tomorrow again  
  
We saw the sunset in the sky  
Soon well see the dawn  
Mother Natures about to rise  
And Father Time is marchin on  
  
Did you hear my daddy yell  
Weve been leaning on the bell  
Kiss me quick and run like sixty  
Because here it is tomorrow again
