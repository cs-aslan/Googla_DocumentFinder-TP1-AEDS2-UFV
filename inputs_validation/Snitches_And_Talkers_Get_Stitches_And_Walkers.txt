Show me show me show me a starryeyed kid  
I I I will break his jaw  
I wont I wont I wont let him get his hopes up  
No oh oh oh  
And I will save him from himself  
Heres a picture with a note  
No dont turn out like me  
Its only for your own good  
No oh oh oh oh oh  
  
And havent you heard  
The word on the street is  
I lost it called it quits  
Get it into the sun  
Out from behind the gossip  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
This storys getting old  
A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind  
Keep kkeep talking

A homewrecker with a heart of gold  
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind nowowow  ow

Nothing worth living for  
Youre still youre still still worth lying for
