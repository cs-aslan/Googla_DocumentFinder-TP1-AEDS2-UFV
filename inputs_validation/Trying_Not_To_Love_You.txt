You call to me and I fall at your feet  
How could anyone ask for more  
And our time apart like knives in my heart  
How could anyone ask for more  
  
Chorus  
But if theres a pill to help me forget  
God knows I havent found it yet  
But Im dying to God Im trying to  
  
Cause trying not to love you only goes so far  
Trying not to need you is tearing me apart  
Cant see the silver lining from down here on the floor  
And I just keep on trying but I dont know what for  
Cause trying not to love you  
Only makes me love you more  
Only makes me love you more  
  
And this kind of pain only time takes away  
Thats why its harder to let you go  
And nothing I can do without thinking of you  
Thats why its harder to let you go  
But if theres a pill to help me forget  
God knows I havent found it yet  
But Im dying to God Im trying to  
  
Its trying not to love you only goes so far  
Trying not to need you is tearing me apart  
Cant see the silver lining from down here on the floor  
And I just keep on trying but I dont know what for  
Cause trying not to love you  
Only makes me love you more  
  
So I sit here divided just talking to myself  
Was it something that I did  
Was there somebody else  
When a voice from behind me that was fighting back tears  
Sat right down beside me and whispered right in my ear  
Tonight Im dying to tell you  
  
That trying not to love you only went so far  
Trying not to need you was tearing me apart  
Now I see the silver lining of what were fighting for  
And if we just keep on trying we could be much more  
Cause trying not to love you  
Oh yeah trying not to love you  
Only makes me love you more  
Only makes me love you more
