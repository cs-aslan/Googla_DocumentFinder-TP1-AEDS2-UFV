One day youre happy the next day youre blue  
You feel like the whole worlds comin right down on you  
There aint nothin wrong but then there aint nothin right  
Its just the kind of thing that keeps you up all night  
  
Heavy tears in your eyes  
Lord dont they hurt you when you cry  
Heavy tears in your eyes  
And when they hit the ground dont they make a terrible sound  
  
Maybe she loves you and maybe its a joke  
And maybe that fire was just a whole lot of smoke  
You dont feel warm but then you dont feel cold  
Youre just gettin weary youre just gettin old  
Heavy tears in your eyes  
  
And your mind cant take this worry and your heart feels underfed  
Maybe youll wake up tomorrow or maybe youll just stay in bed  
Dont call the doctor and ask his advice  
Cause hes felt the same way himself once or twice  
And there aint no cure for the tear in your eye  
You just gotta sit there you just gotta cry  
Heavy tears in your eyes
