End of the third round  
As I put the phone down  
Chasing the same lines  
Over the old ground  
Im pushing zero  
Where is my hero  
Hes out there somewhere  
left of the middle  
  
And your world falls down  
And youre the calling out  
But its something I cant say  
Though it seems the only way  
But its a game that I cant play  Not today  
  
I got my ticket  
And I got a straight road  
But Im passing the same signs  
Over and over  
  
And my world falls down  
And youre the calling out  
But its something I cant say  
Though it seems the only way  
But its a game that I cant play  Not today  
  
And my world falls down  
And youre the calling out  
But its something I cant say  
Though it seems the only way  
But its a game that I cant play  Not today  
  
I need to tell you  
Trying to get it through  
Its not always easy  
Left of the Middle
