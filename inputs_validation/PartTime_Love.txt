Parttime love  
I need somebody whos consistent  
With me  
Someone already there when I need  
Company  
cause when lm feeling low  
I dont want to have to go out  
Looking  
For a parttime kind of love  
  
And when the dreams and rainbows  
Start to disappear  
Dont want somebody up and running  
Out here  
cause when you stop and start  
Baby its just too hard upon  
My heart  
That parttime kind of love  
  
And I cant take you darling living here  
Wait and see  
I want somebody whos committed  
Now to me  
Somewhere someday youll have  
To take a chance  
So if you like the music baby  
Get up and dance  
  
And if we grow together daring to dream  
I know well find our shares of  
Peaches and cream  
And when the juices flow  
I dont want no no no excuses  
Just want your full time love  
For me  
Just want your full time love  
For me
