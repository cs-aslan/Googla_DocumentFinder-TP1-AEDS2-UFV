Nothin ever ever happens in this town  
Feelin low down down not a lot to do around here  
I thought that I would go right out of my mind  
Until a friend told me the news  
  
He said Hey you know that vacant lot  
Right beside the gas station Well somebody bought it  
And on that spot theyre gonna build a shop  
Where we can go buy bolts and screws  
  
Since then Ive been walking on air air  
I can barely brush my teeth or comb my hair  
Cause Im so excited and I really dont care

In my sleeping bag I camped out overnight  
Right in front of the store then as soon as it was light out  
I pressed my nose right up against the glass  
You know I had to be first in line  
  
Gonna get me a flashlight and a broom  
Want a pair of pliers for every single room of my house  
See those hacksaws Very very soon  
One of them will be all mine

Rows of garden hoses that go on for miles and miles  
Brand new socket wrenches in a plethora of styles  
All arranged alphabetically  
  
And theyre doing a promotional stunt
