Cmon  
  
Baby we could go  
Back to the basics  
Trailer park love  
Wearing them asics  
And gold  
  
I can speak Spanish  
You can sing for the neighbours  
Youve been pretty stupid  
Ever since you got famous  
  
Uhoh uhoh wrong side  
Of the tracks boy  
Uhoh uhoh if only  
Wed go back boy  
  
Cause nobody does it like you  
I like the way that you move  
Thats why I never go through  
With leaving you  
  
Everybodys sayin that  
Youre not good for me  
Your friends all swear  
That youve changed but  
I still keep it O G  
This tune could be a reminder  
Of how it all used to be  
So shut up and come on  
Sing our song  
  
And lets go back to the basics  
Lets go back to the basics baby  
Back to the basics  
When youre not wasted  
I know youll see  
  
Baby we could go  
Back to the basics cmon  
We were best friends  
Crazy and shameless in love  
  
You can mow the lawn for money  
I can make you playlists  
You bought me dime packs  
Felt like we were famous  
  
Uhoh uhoh best I  
Ever had boy  
Uhoh uhoh can you  
Remember that boy  
  
Nobody knew what we knew  
We had it figured out too  
Us against the world just  
Me and you oohooh  
  
Everybodys sayin that  
Youre not good for me  
Your friends all swear  
That youve changed but  
I still keep it O G  
This tune could be a reminder  
Of how it all used to be  
So shut up and come on  
Sing our song  
  
And lets go back to the basics  
Lets go back to the basics baby  
Back to the basics  
When youre not wasted  
I know youll see  
  
We could drive forever my baby  
We could leave it all and never look back  
If you wanted heaven baby  
Sit back in my pink cadillac  
  
Everybodys sayin that  
Youre not good for me  
Your friends all swear  
That youve changed but  
I still keep it O G  
This tune could be a reminder  
Of how it all used to be  
So shut up and come on  
Sing our song  
  
Ooh ooh oohooh  
  
Everybodys sayin that  
Youre not good for me  
Your friends all swear  
That youve changed but  
I still keep it O G  
This tune could be a reminder  
Of how it all used to be  
So shut up and come on  
Sing our song  
  
And lets go back to the basics  
Lets go back to the basics baby  
Back to the basics  
When youre not wasted  
I know youll see
