S Carter K J Garside  
Inside her tower she feels free from harm  
Ill lock her up inside safe and warm  
Shell sleep for winter shell sleep for years  
The gardens overgrown over her tears  
Hide from time  
Hide from time  
Grow the garden year after year  
The roots dug deep she wont be found down here  
Brambles thorns will keep the boys away hey hey  
She needs her sleep she wont play today  
Hide from time  
Hide from time  
Ill keep her heart Ill keep it in one piece  
Ill be with her through years and years of sleep  
Ill make this moment last Ill beat time  
Ill be with her forever make her mine  
Hide from time  
Hide from time
