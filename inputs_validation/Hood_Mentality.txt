Fuck school nigga Ima be a dope dealer  
Ima be a killer yup a urban guerrilla  
Ima stack strilla yeah buy me a villa  
Sell a fiveoh to my Auntie Priscilla  
I dont give a fuck that she look like thriller  
Hit that shit one more time and fuck around and kill her  
Cause I got the heart of a Pittsburgh Steeler  
Black nigga draped in gold with a nine milla  
  
Love money love jail love that penitentiary mail  
Love the way these niggas smell keep comin back cant you tell  
Love to see my mama cry love to see my babies struggle  
Love to see my woman juggle nuts cause she got the hustle  
  
I dont give a fuck how my life go  
Now Ima slave man to this cave man without Geico  
Everybody wanna a car Michael a psycho  
But he aint never came through the hood with a rifle  
Gunnin niggas down cause they dont got the right clothes  
Hit the wrong person cause we shoot just like hoes  
First I was blood thirsty Mr Mr Controversy  
Now I wanna beg for mercy should of took my ass to first  
  
Chorus  
If you dont wanna shake that hood mentality  
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality  
If you dont wanna shake that hood mentality  
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality  
If you dont wanna shake that hood mentality  
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality  
If you dont wanna shake that hood mentality  
How the fuck we suppose to change our reality  
  
Fuck school Nigga if I grow a little taller  
Everybody tell me Ima gonna do it Im gonna be a baller  
So fuck that thinkin fuck that thinkin  
Fuck them Lincolns I want Franklins  
Come back through here with my crew Ima gonna have my own shoe  
Ima gonna be that little fool coming in your living room  
Startin point guard nigga fresh outta middle school  
Either is the NBA or is the NFL  
I dunno what else I can do to keep my ass self outta jail  
I wanna be like Tiger Woods swing that club make you sick  
I wanna be like Pacman Jones I wanna be like Michael Vick  
I wanna be like Barry Bonds I wanna be like OJ Simpson  
Leaders feel leaders prison tell you motherfuckers where to kiss em  
I wanna be all broked up moving all old and slow  
I wanna be a alcoholic just like Barway Joe  
I wanna be a side show kinda like Iron Mike  
Used to have a few Bentley now I just ride a bike  
  
Chorus  
  
Fuck school nigga they aint tryin to educate me  
All they give a fuck is what I memorize lately  
Ima gonna have to teach myself  
Clock that money get that wealth  
I wanna be like Santa Claus  
I dont wanna be no fucking elf  
No kid left behind buddy get the run around  
Cant you motherfuckers see that they tryin to doom us down  
Dont trust the government president is for sale  
He dont give a fuck about a nigga just a oil well  
Sell crack go to jail bust a rap go to hell  
Do I got to sell my soul if I wanna go to Yale  
Go kiss Oprahs ass if you wanna be Gail  
I rather have my ass kissed up in Bloomingdale  
You can go be a pimp you can go be a hoe  
But you only gonna get paid off what you know  
If you dont know shit then you cant work for me  
Cause you read your first book in a penitentiary  
  
Chorus
