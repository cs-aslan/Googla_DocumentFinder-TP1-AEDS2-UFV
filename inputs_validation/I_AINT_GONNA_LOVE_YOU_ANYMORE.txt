No need for you to set alone  
Just waiting by your telephone  
Cause I aint gonna call you any more  
Oh I gave you love and you broke my heart  
And you cheated on me from the start  
And now I aint gonna love you any more  
  
Chorus  
I mean I aint gonna love you any more  
I know I couldnt love you as before  
So Im gonna tell you goodbye  
Dont mind these tears there in my eyes  
Cause I aint gonna love you any more  
  
My darlin I just worship you  
And look what you have loved me through  
You left me with a heart so sick and sore  
  
Oh youre the one that was unfair  
It wasnt in you to play square  
And now I aint gonna love you anymore  
  
Chorus
