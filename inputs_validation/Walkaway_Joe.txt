Mama told her baby  
girl take it real slow  
Girl told her mama  
hey I really gotta go  
hes waitin in the car  
Mama said  
girl you wont get far  
  
This is the story of an average jane  
Ninety miles an hour down a lovers lane  
On a tank of dreams  
Oh if she could have only seen  
But fates got plans that it dont wanna show cause   
  
That boys just a walkaway joe  
Born to be a leaver  
Tell you from the word go  
Destined to deceive her  
Hes the wrong kind of paradise  
Shes gonna know it in a matter of time  
That boys just a walkaway joe  
  
Just a little while into abilene  
He pulls into a station and he robs it clean  
Shes waitin in the car  
Underneath the texaco star  
  
She only wanted love  
Never bargained for this  
She cant help but love him for the way he is  
Shes only seventeen  
And there aint no reasoning  
So shell ride this ride  
As far as it will go but   
  
That boys just a walkaway joe  
Born to be a leaver  
Tell you from the word go  
Destined to deceive her  
Hes the wrong kind of paradise  
Shes gonna know it in a matter of time  
That boys just a walkaway joe  
  
Somewhere in a roadside motel room  
Alone in the silence she wakes up too soon  
And reaches for his arms  
But shell just keep reachin on  
cause the cold hard truth revealed  
What it had known   
  
That boys just a walkaway joe  
Born to be a leaver  
Tell you from the word go  
Destined to deceive her  
Hes the wrong kind of paradise  
But it was just another lesson in life  
That boys just a walkaway joe  
  
All he was was a walkaway joe  
Ooh walkaway joe   
Ooh he was a walkaway joe  
Ooh walkaway joe   
Yes he was a walkaway joe
