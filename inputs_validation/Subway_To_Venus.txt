Step right up and listen please  
Youre gonna get it with the greatest of ease  
Everybody gather round all aboard the underground  
Youve got to get in before you get out  
And gettin out is what its gonna be about  
If you find that you are blind  
Open your bashful mind  
Let my band step inside  
And take you on a cosmic ride  
With honest sounds Ill paint your brain  
For in this song I do proclaim  
That once aboard this moving train  
Ill do my best to ease your pain  
Slinky as my speech may be  
On this trip youll ride for free  
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily  
Space is king or so I sing subway to venus  
Once aboard and feeling smooth  
Like a liquid you will ooze  
Into a state of mind that soothes  
Aw be my quest inside my grove  
Cause what Ive got to give to you  
Is gonna make you wiggle like a wiggley worm  
Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm  
Lifes too short to be in a hole  
So bust into your funkiest stroll  
Space is king or so I sing subway to venus  
Take your body shake it around  
Do the dog on the ground  
And if I cant make you dance  
I guess Ill just have to make you piss your pants  
Space is king or so I sing subway to venus
