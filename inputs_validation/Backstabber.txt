Police voice  
Attention all units attention all units  
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair  
I repeat we have an APB on a man with green hair  
Hes armed with a knife I repeat hes armed with a knife  
Proceed with caution watch your back fellas  
He could be coming at your girlfriend next  
  
Verse 1  
Theres a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward  
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward  
Hell stab you with a sword dont be fooled by his charm  
Hes probably armed with intent to do bodily harm  
Ring the alarm look for a man with green hair  
Check at your girls house he was last seen there  
Hes has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes  
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks  
  
Chorus  
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good  
  
Verse 2  
We got the walkietalkies to keep us all informed  
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms  
Our unit storms in we split the ghetto in sectors  
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors  
Protectors and be sure that you stand close  
Watch each others backs and guard your command post  
And most of all be advised that hes wise  
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys  
  
Chorus  
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good  
  
Verse 3  
Im on a solo mission to find him personally  
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully  
For what he first did to me  
Its sure to be the last  
Following footprints with a magnifying glass  
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell  
Im mad as hell on the trail of the tattle tail  
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar  
Give me your girlfriend or Im gonna kill ya  
  
Chorus  
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good  
  
Verse 4  
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps  
Sneezing at dust and swinging at the spiderwebs  
Inside the depths of his basement  
I taste lint in my mouth then the lights in the place went  
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes  
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs  
None of my guys knew where Im at I was doomed  
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume  
  
Chorus  
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good  
  
Verse 5  
Dealing with backstabbers there was one thing I learned  
Theyre only powerful when you got your back turned  
I yearned for the day that we finally met again  
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine  
He shed his skin then he promised to come clean  
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen  
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home  
Beating him over the head with the telephone  
  
Police voice  
Attention all cars attention all cars  
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect  
Hes going back to the crazy home I repeat  
Hes going back to the crazy home how about that  
  
Chorus x 3  
I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a best friend then  
Why I oughtta  
Stay away from him he aint no good
