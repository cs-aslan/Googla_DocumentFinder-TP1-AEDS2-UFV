They say that Im a crazy cajun always rantin and a ravin

I jumped up in a bar one night when I was feeling alright  
  
Let out a great big AEee and the sheriff said come with me

But a man come and bailed me out and said in his mind there was no doubt  
  
That I could be a big star probably get myself a brand new car  
  
I says you mean your going to pay me just to hear me hollar Aeee  
  
Yes he said thats right son Were gonna make a million  
  
So we went to Nashville town I made a record and it played all around  
  
From then on they were Number 1 but I wasnt having no fun  
  
I miss my Cajun Baby and all that good Aeee  
  
So I went on back to Louisian to find my girl and have a love again
