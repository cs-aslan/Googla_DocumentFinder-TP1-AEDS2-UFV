Lift Your Voices Up  
Raise The Roof Now  
We Are Coming  
Theres No Stopping Us  
Here we go  
  
Let The Creatures of pray  
Raise a clamor round your ears  
Cursing screaming voices full of fear  
Of fear  
  
Its a tale of the fool  
Designed to weaken you  
Full of sound and fury  
And jealous lies  
It triesbut Im free  
  
Wings of vengeance draw nigh  
Wings of vengeance on high  
  
Chorus  
We rule the night  
We rule the night  
We rule the night  
You and I  
  
Marching on to victory  
Your path is paved with scars  
A victim of illusion  
You shoot far so far  
Oh but your reach  
Should always exceed your your grasp  
Or whats a heaven for  
But to last to last  
Die free  
  
Wings of vengeance draw nigh  
Wings of vengeance on high  
  
Chorus
