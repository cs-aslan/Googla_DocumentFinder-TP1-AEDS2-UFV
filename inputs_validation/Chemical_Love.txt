People goin round  
Tellin others they are square  
Around and round in circles  
Is a ride that goes somewhere  
All you need to fly  
Is a heart dying to try  
A chemical love  
Its a chemical love  
  
Aint nothin to it  
Gettin cash when you are broke  
Doin lots of time  
Is worth a little snort of coke  
Infected needles  
Can aid you in no time  
Through chemical love  
Youve got a chemical love  
  
Some people crave for physical love  
Some people crave material love  
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love  
Youve got a chemical jones  
Youve got a chemical love  
  
Yeah a chemical love  
Youve got chemical love  
  
Some people find themselves hooked on the  
weirdest things  
That have nothing to do with living  
Gods gift to us is our life whats ours to him  
If its not our love then nothings given given  
  
Some people crave for physical love  
Some people crave material love  
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love  
Youve got a chemical jones  
For a chemical love
