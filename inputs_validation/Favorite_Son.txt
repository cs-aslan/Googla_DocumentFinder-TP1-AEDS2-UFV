He hit the ground running  
At the speed of light  
The star was brightly shining  
Like a neon light  
  
Its your favorite son  
Its your favorite son  
  
A fixture on the talk shows  
To the silver screen  
From here to Colorado  
Hes a sex machine  
  
Its your favorite son  
Its your favorite son  
  
But isnt it a drag  
Isnt it a drag  
Isnt it a drag  
Its pretty bloody sad  
But isnt it a drag  
  
A cleancut AllAmerican  
Really aint so clean  
His royal auditorium  
Is a murder scene  
  
Its your favorite son  
Its your favorite son  
Oh isnt it a drag  
Isnt it a drag  
Isnt it a drag  
Its pretty bloody sad  
But isnt it a drag  
  
Well no one says its fair  
Turn a teenage lush  
To a millionaire  
  
Now wheres your fuckin champion  
On a bed you laid  
Hes not the AllAmerican  
That you thought you paid  
  
Its your favorite son  
Its your favorite son  
But isnt it a drag
