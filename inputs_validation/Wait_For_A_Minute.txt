Wait just A Minute  
Can Wait just A Minute  
  
Here you are with me  
And if you take my hand babe  
We can go to a place you aint never seen before  
  
Slow dance in the moonlight  
Im just trying to set the mood right  
Im just doing what a dude do  
Do it over and over and over  
  
Quick thing wanna run with me now  
Swift thing just come with me now  
Good steps go to the beat now  
Over and over and over  
  
Its just the way that way that way that do it babe  
All I can say that say the say that Im the it  
But Id be lying babe  
  
Just wanna wait for a minute  
Wait for a minute  
  
Tyga  Rap Vese  
Hold up I dont need no love  
I said that with a straight face baby thats poker  
Feel a lil sober got it mixed in my soda  
I clean up good aropa dopa  
Baby Im the shit but thats a good odor  
Im a young star but my money look Yoda  
Crib on the ocean backyard boat shit  
You hating on the internet I couldnt even notice  
Tickets no service we at the top working  
Poppops is lurking told her dont get nervous  
I dont swerve Suburbans this a gold derby  
Ferarris and horses I snap like Torres  
No rug I floor it girl come feel important  
Im all about a dollar babe banks call me Georgi

You know me Im just tryna  
  
Slow dance in the moonlight  
Im just trying to set the mood right  
Im just doing what a dude do  
Do it over and over and over  
  
Quick thing wanna run with me now  
Swift thing just come with me now  
Good steps go to the beat now  
Over and over and over  
  
Its just the way that way that way that do it babe  
All I can say that say the say that Im the it  
But Id be lying babe  
  
Just wanna wait for a minute  
Wait for a minute
