Shes dressed in black again  
And Im falling down again  
Down to the floor again  
Im begging for more again  
But oh what can you do  
When shes dressed in black  
  
My mind wanders endlessly  
On paths where shes leading me  
With games that she likes to play  
And words that she doesnt say  
Not when were alone  
And shes dressed in black  
  
As a picture of herself  
Shes a picture of the world  
A reflection of you  
A reflection of me  
And its all there to see  
If you only give in  
To the fire within  
  
Dressed in black again  
  
Shadows fall onto me  
And she stands there over me  
And waits to encompass me  
I lay here helplessly  
But oh what can you do  
When shes dressed in black  
  
Dressed in black again
