Whats it all about Alfie  
Is it just for the moment we live  
Whats it all about when you sort it out Alfie  
Are we meant to take more than we give or are we meant to be kind  
  
And if only fools are kind Alfie  
Then I guess its wise to be cruel  
And if life belongs only to the strong Alfie  
What will you lend on an old golden rule  
  
As sure as I believe theres a heaven above Alfie  
I know theres something much more  
Something even nonbelievers can believe in  
I believe in love Alfie  
  
Without true love we just exist Alfie  
Until you find the love youve missed youre nothing Alfie  
When you walk let your heart lead the way  
And youll find love any day Alfie Alfie
