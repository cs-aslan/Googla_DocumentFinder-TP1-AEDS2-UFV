Time to change has come and gone  
Watched your fears become your god  
Its your decision  
Its your decision  
  
Overwhelmed you chose to run  
Apathetic to the stunned  
Its your decision  
Its your decision  
  
You feed the fire that burned us all  
When you lied  
To feel the pain that spurs you on  
Black inside  
  
Noone plans to take the path that brings you nowhere  
Here you stand before us all and say its over  
  
Its over  
  
It might seem an after thought  
Yes it hurts to know youre bought  
Its your decision  
Its your decision  
  
You feed the fire that burned us all  
When you lied  
To feel the pain that spurs you on  
Black inside  
  
Its your decision  
Its your decision  
  
Noone plans to take the path that brings you nowhere  
Here you stand before us all and say its over  
  
Its over  
Its over
