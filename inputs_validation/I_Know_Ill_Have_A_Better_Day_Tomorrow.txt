Well I cant make it through this world by myself  
I need heavens help to make through the day  
And if I go to bed tonight  
And remember to say my prayers  
I know Ill have a better day tomorrow  
  
Chorus  
Cause youve done what you said youd do  
And youve given me lots of love  
And Ive never known such peace  
Since I met you  
Im so proud to be your child  
And Im doing the best I can  
And I know Ill have a better day tomorrow  
  
Well  
  
Chorus  
  
I know Ill have a better day tomorrow
