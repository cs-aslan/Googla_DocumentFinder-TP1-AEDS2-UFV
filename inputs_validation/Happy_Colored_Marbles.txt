Most people are not ok but theyre taking their siestas in the sun  
Got some ideas on the way it should be  
But most of em just carrying on  
  
Happy colored marbles that are rolling in my head  
I put em back in the jacket of the one I love  
Carry that velvet sack full of pretty colored marbles  
And Ill ask you for em back when Im ready and done  
  
Most people are not ok and theyre slackin cause the job aint done  
Fillin up on the poison nut  
And getting down till the dawn  
  
Happy colored marbles that are rolling in my head  
I put em back in the jacket of the one I love  
Carry that velvet sack full of pretty colored marbles  
And Ill ask you for em back when Im ready and done
