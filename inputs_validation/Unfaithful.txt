Story of my life  
Searching for the right  
But it keeps avoiding me  
Sorrow in my soul  
Cause it seems that wrong  
Really loves my company  
  
Hes more than a man  
And this is more than love  
The reason that the sky is blue  
The clouds are rolling in  
Because Im gone again  
And to him I just cant be true  
  
And I know that he knows Im unfaithful  
And it kills him inside  
To know that I am happy with some other guy  
I can see him dying  
  
I dont wanna do this anymore  
I dont wanna be the reason why  
Every time I walk out the door  
I see him die a little more inside  
I dont wanna hurt him anymore  
I dont wanna take away his life  
I dont wanna be  
A murderer  
  
I feel it in the air  
As Im doing my hair  
Preparing for another date  
A kiss upon my cheek  
As he reluctantly  
Asks if Im gonna be out late  
I say I wont be long  
Just hanging with the girls  
A lie I didnt have to tell  
Because we both know  
Where Im about to go  
And we know it very well  
  
Cause I know that he knows Im unfaithful  
And it kills him inside  
To know that I am happy with some other guy  
I can see him dying  
  
I dont wanna do this anymore  
I dont wanna be the reason why  
Every time I walk out the door  
I see him die a little more inside  
I dont wanna hurt him anymore  
I dont wanna take away his life  
I dont wanna be  
A murderer  
  
Our love his trust  
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head  
Get it over with  
I dont wanna do this  
Anymore  
Uh  
Anymore  
  
And I dont wanna do this anymore  
I dont wanna be the reason why  
And every time I walk out the door  
I see him die a little more inside  
And I dont wanna hurt him anymore  
I dont wanna take away his life  
I dont wanna be  
A murderer  
A murderer  
No no no no  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
