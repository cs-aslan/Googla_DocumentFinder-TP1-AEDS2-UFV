Here I go again  
Why does the ghost of love still haunt me  
Its all been cried about before  
Its all been cried about before  
  
Yes its all been cried about before  
Still its everywhere  
Is it crying to be heard  
Dont you think youve had your say  
Dont you think youve had your say  
  
Yes dont you think youve seen your day  
I dont know  
No I dont  
Dont I know  
No I dont  
  
I dont know  
Not knowing if its love  
Is better than no thoughts of love at all  
But its been cried about before  
  
I guess Ill cry for it some more  
Its just the hope for love once more  
Its just the hope for love once more
