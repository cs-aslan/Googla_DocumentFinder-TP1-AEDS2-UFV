Purify  
  
Tear it down  
Strip the layers off  
My turpentine  
Old paint old looks  
Cover up the past  
White heat white light  
Super white bones  
Bones of you and I  
  
Pure if ICant you help me  
Pure if IWont you help me  
Purify you and I  
Purify you and I  
Pure if ICant you help me  
Pure if IWont you help me  
  
You and I Purify x3  
  
Truth and dare  
Peeling back the skin  
Acid wash  
Ghost white  
Ultra clean  
Want to be skeleton  
Clear eyes  
Diamond eyes  
Strip the past of mine  
My sweet turpentine  
  
Pure if ICant you help me  
Pure if IWont you help me  
Purify you and I  
Purify you and I  
Pure if ICant you help me  
Pure if IWont you help me  
  
You and I Purify x3  
  
I can find the dirt on anything  
I can find the dirt on anything  
  
I aint dancing with your skeletons  
I aint dancing with what might have been  
  
Pure if ICant you help me  
Pure if IWont you help me  
Purify you and I  
Purify you and I  
Pure if ICant you help me  
Pure if IWont you help me  
  
You and I Purify  
You and I Purify  
Cmon Purify
