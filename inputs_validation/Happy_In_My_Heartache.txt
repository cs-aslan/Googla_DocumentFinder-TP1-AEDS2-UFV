Coffee is on the table and I  
Just cant seem to wake up this aching heart of mine  
One more day without you and Ill be fine  
I know Im good for waiting but waiting wasted time  
  
Oh and I I dont take it lightly  
The trouble that Ive gone through to get you to know who I am  
Oh and I I cant find a reason to be happy in this heartache  
Cause I should know better than that  
Im better than that  
  
Wicked winds are blowing through the halls  
These old familiar faces are clinging to the walls  
I know its cold but I cant feel at all  
And I know these walls are crumbling  
And I wont stay to watch them fall  
  
Oh and I I dont take it lightly  
The trouble that Ive gone through to get you to know who I am  
Oh and I I cant find a reason to be happy in my heartache  
Cause I should know better than that  
  
But I cant stop loving you  
I dont know what to do  
To keep holding on  
  
Oh and I I dont take it lightly  
The trouble that Ive gone through Ive given you all that I am  
Oh and I I cant find a reason to be happy in my heartache  
Cause I should know better than that  
Oh Im better than that
