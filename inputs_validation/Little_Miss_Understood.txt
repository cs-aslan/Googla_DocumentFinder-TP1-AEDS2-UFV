There has to be a reason  
Why everyone speaks bad of my baby  
I think I know that reason  
And it is oh so sad  
They say she walks the streets  
But thats not strictly true  
Shes got a lot to eat  
And shes not as rich as you  
Shes just a little miss understood  
Thats all  
  
Everyone needs somebody  
To get them through that time  
You may not love that someone  
As much as I love mine  
But if she walks the streets  
Does that condemn her soul  
Or is heaven so complete  
it rejects a heart of gold  
Shes just a little miss understood  
a little miss understood  
A little miss understood  
Thats all  
  
And if she walks the streets  
Does that condemn her soul  
Or is heaven so complete  
it rejects a heart of gold  
Shes just a little miss understood  
a little miss understood  
Shes just a little miss understood  
Thats all  
  
And if she walks the streets  
Does that condemn her soul  
Or is heaven so complete
