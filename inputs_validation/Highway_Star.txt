Nobody gonna take my car Im gonna race it to the ground  
Nobody gonna beat my car its gonna break the speed of sound  
Ooh its a killing machine its got everything  
Like a driving power big fat tires and everything  
  
I love it and I need it I feed it  
Yeah its a wild hurricane  
Alright hold tight Im a highway star  
  
Nobody gonna take my girl Im gonna keep her to the end  
Nobody gonna have my girl she stays close on every bend  
Ooh shes a killing machine shes got everything  
Like a moving mouth body control and everything  
  
I love her I need her I seed her  
Yeah she turns me on  
Alright hold tight Im a highway star  
  
Nobody gonna take my head I got speed inside my brain  
Nobody gonna steal my head now that Im on the road again  
Ooh Im in heaven again Ive got everything  
Like a moving ground an open road and everything  
  
I love it I need it I bleed it  
Eight cylinders all mine  
Alright hold tight Im a highway star  
  
Nobody gonna take my car Im gonna race it to the ground  
Nobody gonna beat my car its gonna break the speed of sound  
Ooh its a killing machine its got everything  
Like a driving power big fat tires and everything  
  
Im a highway star Im a highway star
