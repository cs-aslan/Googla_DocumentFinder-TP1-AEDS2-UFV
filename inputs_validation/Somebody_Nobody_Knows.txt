Alone in a bathroom a young girl is sitting  
And smiling at nothing at all  
And she stares now and then at the eyes of the men  
In the mirror that hangs on the wall  
Shes waiting for someone and knowing theres no one  
Who cares if she comes or she goes  
Just a soul in the shadows the world never sees  
Shes somebody nobody knows  
Chorus  
Someone no ones ever known  
Crying where no one can hear  
Somebodys dying alone  
In a city where nobody cares  
Down in the gutter an old man has fallen  
Like somebody the world threw away  
And the late crowd was leaving and nobody even  
Took the time to look down where he lay  
The old man was crying and helplessly trying  
To wipe off the stain from his clothes  
Just a soul in the shadows that life left behind  
Hes somebody nobody knows  
Chorus  
Someone no ones ever known  
Crying where no one can hear  
Somebodys dying alone  
In a city where nobody cares
