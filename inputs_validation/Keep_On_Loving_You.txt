You should have seen by the look in my eyes baby  
There was somethin missin  
You should have known by the tone of my voice maybe  
But you didnt listen  
You played dead but you never bled  
Instead you laid still in the grass all coiled up and hissin  
  
And though I know all about those men  
Still I dont remember  
Cause it was us baby  
Way before them and were still together  
And I meant every word I said  
When I said that I loved you I meant that I loved you forever  
  
And Im gonna keep on lovin you  
Cause its the only thing I want to do  
I dont want to sleep I just want to keep on lovin you  
Baby Im gonna keep on lovin you  
Cause its the only thing I want to do  
I dont want to sleep  
I just want to keep on lovin you
