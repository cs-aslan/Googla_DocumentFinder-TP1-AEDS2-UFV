So here we are  
Its hour one  
And its a nightmare  
Theres nothing left  
And yet its good to be alive  
Theres no use crying  
Cause the universe is not fair  
The wicked and the innocent  
Are fighting to survive  
  
Chorus  
Child stay down stay down  
You better run for cover underground  
Child stay down stay down  
You better shut your mouth  
Dont make a sound  
  
Human nature is the reason  
For our downfall  
And we deserve it playing God  
With our machines  
Our religions are a prison  
Thats our fatal flaw  
Bombs are flying  
While were sleeping with the enemy  
  
Chorus  
  
Look at me right at me  
When Im telling you to stay down  
Come to me run to me  
I am begging you to stay down  
Cling to me desperately  
All you gotta do is stay down  
Pay attention my child down  
  
Look at me right at me  
When Im telling you to stay down  
Come to me run to me  
I am begging you to stay down  
Cling to me desperately  
All you gotta do is stay down  
Pay attention my child  
  
Chorus  
  
Child stay down stay down  
You better run for cover underground  
Child stay down stay down  
Stay down
