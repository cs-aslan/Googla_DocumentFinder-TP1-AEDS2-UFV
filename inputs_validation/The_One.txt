An all out panic thrashing  
Splitting you in half  
Mistook the sobbing for a laugh  
Travel close concealed  
Ill leave the dorr ajar  
So who has taken you this far  
Youve been here before  
  
Call if you need  
Im right over here  
With a finger on the trigger  
And if you need me  
Fall and youll bleed  
As the demon appear  
Its time to stand deliver  
And if you know me  
  
Chorus  
I am your stand and deliver  
I am your shot golden gun  
I am youre voice in the sliver  
I am I am I am the one  
I am your stand and deliver  
I am your shot golden gun  
I am I am I am the one  
  
Now when you get inside  
Be careful what you say  
Dont be mistaken for the prey  
Low to the ground is best  
Attend to the bizarre  
So who has taken you this far  
Ive seen you before  
  
Call if you need  
Im right over here  
With a finger on the trigger  
And if you need me  
Fall and youll bleed  
As the demon appear  
Its time to stand deliver  
  
Chorus
