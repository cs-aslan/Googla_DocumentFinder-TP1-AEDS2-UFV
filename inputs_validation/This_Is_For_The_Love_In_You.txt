To Italy in one night  
Drop top Bentley Coupe parked in the spotlight  
And you can drive it laced in all white

The man of steel when Im in this  
A mach made in heaven  
When we blend this

Ladies and gentlemen Howard Hewett

See I never met a girl no no  
Who satisfied my mental and physical thing  
When I lay down to sleep and I rest assured  
With the thought that you are right  
Right next to me

Oh your more then just one woman  
You blowin my mind with the love
