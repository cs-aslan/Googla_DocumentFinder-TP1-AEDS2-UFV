I havent lost anything except my mind  
Expect a thousand confessions that you will not find  
I try to take off my head sometimes  
Because I cant escape the memories  
I havent lost anything except my mind except my mind  
  
You could be empty  
And I can be right here empty with you  
Or you could be hollow  
And I can be right here hollow with you  
If you want to say goodbye to everything  
I could say goodbye too  
I can be right here empty with you  
  
I havent wasted anything except my time except my time  
Forget the treasures we burned because well be just fine  
I try to take off my head sometimes  
Because I cant escape for the life of me  
I havent lost anything except my mind my mind  
  
You could be empty  
And I can be right here empty with you  
Or you could be hollow  
And I can be right here hollow with you  
If you want to say goodbye to everything  
I could say goodbye too  
I can be right here empty with you  
  
Instead of going underground  
Instead of calling them out  
Instead of running cause your still breathing  
Instead of swallowing lies  
Instead of buried alive  
Lets twist the knife til they cant stop bleeding  
If you need a confession Im guilty  
Lets chase the knife til they cant stop bleeding  
Do you think I feel sorry Forgive me  
Lets chase the knife til they cant stop bleeding  
Instead of going underground  
Instead of calling them out  
Lets chase the knife til they cant stop bleeding  
  
You could be empty  
And I can be right here empty with you  
Or you could be hollow  
And I can be right here hollow with you  
If you want to say goodbye to everything  
I could say goodbye too  
I can be right here empty with you
