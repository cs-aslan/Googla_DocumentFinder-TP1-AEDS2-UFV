Ive come through many hard trials  
Through temptations on every hand  
Though Satans tried to stop me  
And to place my feet on sinking sand  
Through the pain and all of my sorrows  
Through the tears and all my fears  
The Lord was there to keep me  
For Hes kept me in the midst of it all  
  
Not because Ive been so faithful  
Not because Ive always obeyed  
No its not because I trusted Him  
To be with me all of the way  
But its because He loves me so dearly  
He was there to answer my calls  
He was there always to protect me  
For Hes kept me in the midst of it all

And Hes never let me fall
