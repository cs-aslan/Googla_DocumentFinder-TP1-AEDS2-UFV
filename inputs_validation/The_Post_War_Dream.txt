Tell me true tell me why was Jesus crucified  
Is it for this that daddy died  
Was it for you was it me  
Did I watch too much tv  
Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes  
If it wasnt for the nips  
Being so good at building ships  
The yards would still be open on the clyde  
And it cant be much fun for them  
Beneath the rising sun  
With all their kids committing suicide  
What have we done maggie what have we done  
What have we done to England  
Should we shout should we scream  
What happened to the post war dream  
Oh Maggie Maggie what have we done
