Someday Well Be Together  
Tonights Gone Forever  
The Night Just Comes Falling  
Your Heart It Is Calling  
  
Oh I Know And I Swear  
I Always Will Be There  
There Is You And Me  
Oh Baby Cant You See  
  
Rouge Et Noir  
Rouge Et Noir  
Be The Lady Of My Heart  
Rouge Et Moir  
Rouge Et Noir  
Oh Ill Never Break Apart  
  
Rouge Et Noir  
Youll Break My Heart  
Oh This Love Is So Bizarre  
Rouge Et Noir  
Dont Break Apart  
Be The Lady Of My Heart  
My Heart  
  
I Know You Are Lonely  
I Swear Youre The Only  
You Said You Remember  
That Day In September  
  
When I Promised All My Love  
Baby I Was Dreaming Of  
That You Were Here With Me  
Oh Baby Cant You See
