Let me go please let me go youre hurtin me  
Ive lost all your love so I cant understand  
Are you holding on to just show me you can  
This grip youll have on me is as tight as it can be  
Let me go please let me go youre hurtin me  
Staying here unwanted will be the death of me  
Needing love that you wont give me so desperately  
Its more than I can stand let me go for I still cant  
Let me go please let me go youre hurtin me  
Got no place to go but Ill go anyway  
If I go Ill cry and Ill cry if I stay  
I still love you cant you see and I dont want to be free  
Let me go please let me go youre hurtin me  
Staying here unwanted will be the death of me
