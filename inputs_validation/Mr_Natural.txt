I wake up in the morning  
And I look out at the sun  
Then I think Ill get up go out a while  
And I get out on the run  
Then I say My boy you got to slow down  
And have yourself some fun  
So I lay around and I smoke a while  
And I never get nothing done  
  
I dont care my needs are few  
What in the world am I gonna do  
With a million dollars from I dont know who  
When in the world will I get through  
With living in such great expectations  
With loving some call it infatuation  
  
I go outside and I walk a while  
Singing in the street  
I blow a kiss I give a smile  
To every one I meet  
I buy myself a beer or two  
Just to leave my stone behind  
Sometimes I get so drunk  
I can sing just like a child yeah  
Ooh ooh  
  
I get drunk and I laugh a lot  
Theres something that I hear  
My brain gets loose my soul gets hot  
The music hits my ears  
I hear the music  
Lord it sounds so sweet  
  
Musics hot and I dont mind  
If I dance a step or two  
I do a twitch unwind my spine  
I set my eyes on you  
I watch you move you move so fine  
So fine I never knew  
Making love while dancing  
Is an easy thing to do  
  
Yes its easy It aint hard  
Yes yes its easy It aint hard  
Oh oh its easy Oh no no no  
Oh its easy Come on
