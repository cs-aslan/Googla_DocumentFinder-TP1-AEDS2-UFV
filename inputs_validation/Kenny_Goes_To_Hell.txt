James Hetfeild Little boy your going to hell  
You said bad words threw rocks at the bird  
And now this is your hotel  
You aint going back this aint disneyland its hell  
  
Little boy its time for you to pay  
For hurting that bird and not going to church  
And staring at boobs everyday  
Now you must stand in hell  
  
Hell isnt good hell isnt good hell  
No hell isnt good hell isnt good hell  
  
Adolf Hitler something in german  
George Burns Hey fuckface have you seen Gracie  
Mahatma Ghandi There is orderliness in the universe  
James Hetfield Hell isnt good hell isnt good hell
