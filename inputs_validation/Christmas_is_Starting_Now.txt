Grab some holly and mistletoe  
Cause were gonna go out tonight  
Were gonna bask in the electric glow  
Of a billion little colored lights  
Weve got a lot to do before the dawn  
So with a minimum of introspection  
I think youve better put your mittens on  
Shake your jingle bell in my direction  
  
Sometimes I feel like a big snowman  
Thats fallen under a plow  
But tonight Im on top of the world  
Were gonna bring it around somehow  
  
Christmas is starting now  
Oh yeah  
Christmas is starting now  
Thats right Christmas is starting now  
Oh yeah
