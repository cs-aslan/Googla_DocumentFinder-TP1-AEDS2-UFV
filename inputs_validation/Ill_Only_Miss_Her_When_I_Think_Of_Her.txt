Ill only miss her when I think of her  
And Ill think of her all the time  
Likely Ill spend my days hearing her turn of a phrase  
Things I found hard to praise right now would seem sublime  
  
And the truth is  
Ill only miss her when some stranger laughs  
Cause its still her laugh my heart hears  
Maybe in time I guess the longing will grow the slightest bit less  
  
And there will be moments yes when it disappears  
Ill bet I forget her completely  
In about a hundred years  
The truth is  
  
Ill only miss her when some stranger laughs  
Cause its still her laugh my heart hears  
Maybe in time I guess the longing will grow the slightest bit less  
And there will be moments yes when it disappears  
  
Ill bet I forget her completely  
In about a hundred years
