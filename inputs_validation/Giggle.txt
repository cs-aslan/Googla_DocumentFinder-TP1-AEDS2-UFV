Giggle  
Giggle if you want to  
But I know its still true  
That Hes always gonna love me  
So just laugh out  
If you think Im uncool  
Playin the part of the fool  
Cause I love Him  
Dont you know how I love Him  
Oh well I do  
When I see somebody cryin  
Some person whos real mean  
I want to quickly walk right by him  
But Ill stop for You  
Dear Lord but  
Must I hug him real tight now  
He smells so bad Ill faint  
What will my friends think if I kill my pride I cant  
Well giggle  
Giggle if you want to  
But I know its still true  
That Hes always gonna love me  
So just laugh out  
If you think Im uncool  
Playin the part of the fool  
Cause I love Him  
Dont you know how I love Him  
Oh well I do  
When Im in a sticky situation  
Sitting in a class at school  
Everyone is talking evolution  
No one talks of You  
My hand goes up  
I dont want to be too pushy  
My arm it feels like lead  
But theres such a joy theyre missing saying God is dead  
So giggle  
Giggle if you want to  
But I know its still true  
That Hes always gonna love me  
So just laugh out  
If you think Im uncool  
Always playin the part of the fool  
Cause I love Him  
Dont you know how I love Him  
Oh well I do
