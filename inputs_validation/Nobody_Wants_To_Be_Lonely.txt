Why why why  
Oh ooh ohh  
  
There you are in a darkened room  
And youre all alone looking out the window  
Your heart is cold and lost the will to love  
Like a broken arrow  
Here I stand in the shadows  
In the shadows  
Come to come come to me  
Cant you see that  
  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
Nobody wants to cry  
My bodys longing to hold you  
So bad it hurts inside  
Time is precious and its slipping away  
And Ive been waiting for you all of my life ohh  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
So why why why dont you let me love you  
  
Why ooh ohh yeah why oh why why  
  
Ooh ooh yeah  
Can you hear my voice do you hear my song  
Its a seranade so your heart can find me ohh  
And suddenly youre flying down the stairs  
Into my arms baby ohh  
  
Before I start going crazy  
Going crazy ohh  
Run to me  
Run to me  
Cause Im dying  
  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
Nobody wants to cry I dont wanna cry  
My bodys longing to hold you Im longing to hold you  
So bad it hurts inside  
Time is precious and its slipping away  
And Ive been waiting for you all of my life ohh  
Nobody wants to be lonely  
So why  
  
Why why dont you let me love you  
I wanna feel you need me  
Feel you need me  
Just like the air youre breathing  
Breathing I need you here in my life
