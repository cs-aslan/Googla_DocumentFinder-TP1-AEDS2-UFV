Im waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime  
Reflecting on my past life and it doesnt have much time  
Cause at 5 oclock they take me to the Gallows Pole  
The sands of time for me are running low yeah  
  
When the priest comes to read me the last rites  
I take a look through the bars at the last sights  
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me  
  
Can it be that theres some sort of error  
Hard to stop the surmounting terror  
Is it really the end not some crazy dream  
  
Somebody please tell me that Im dreaming  
Its not easy to stop from screaming  
The words escape me when I try to speak  
Tears flow but why am I crying  
After all Im not afraid of dying  
Dont I believe that there never is an end  
  
As the guards march me out to the courtyard  
Somebody cries from a cell God be with you  
If theres a God then why has he let me go  
  
As I walk my life drifts before me  
Though the end is near Im not sorry  
Catch my soul its willing to fly away  
  
Mark my words believe my soul lives on  
Dont worry now that I have gone  
Ive gone beyond to seek the truth  
  
When you know that your time is close at hand  
Maybe then youll begin to understand  
Life down here is just a strange illusion  
Yeah hallowed be thy name  
Yeah hallowed by thy name  
Yeah
