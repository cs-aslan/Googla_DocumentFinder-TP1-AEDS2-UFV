Do you remember me  how we used to be helpless and happy and blind   
Sunk without hope in a haze of good dope and cheap wine   
Laying on the livingroom floor on those indian tapestry cushions you made  
Thinking of calling our first born jasmine or jade  
Dont do it dont do it dont do it to me  
Dont think about it dont think about it dont think about it dont think
about what it might be  
Dont get up to open the door just stay with me here on the floor  
Its gonna get cold in the 1970s  
You wouldnt listen you thought you knew better you just to had to speak to
that man  
Please believe me Ill visit whenever I can  
Laying in your little white room with no windows and three square sedations a
day  
You plead with the doctor whos running the show  
please dont take jasmine away and leave me alone  
  
Dont do it dont do it dont do it dont do it to me  
Dont think about it dont think about it dont think about it dont think
about what it might be  
Dont get up to open the door just stay with me here on the floor  
Its gonna get cold in the 1970s  
Do you remember me  how we used to be helpless and happy and blind   
Sunk without hope in a haze of good dope and cheap wine   
Now in your little white room with no windows and three square sedations a day  
You plead with the doctor whos running the show  
please dont take jasmine away and leave me alone
