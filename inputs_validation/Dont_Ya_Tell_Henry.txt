Dont ya tell Henry  
Apples got your fly  
  
I went down to the river on a saturday morn  
Alookin around just to see whos born  
I found a little chicken down on his knees  
I went up and yelled to him  
Please please please  
He said Dont ya tell Henry  
Dont ya tell Henry  
Dont ya tell Henry  
Apples got your fly  
  
I went down to the corner at ahalf past ten  
Is lookin around I wouldnt say when  
I looked down low I looked above  
And who did I see but the one I love  
She said Dont ya tell Henry  
Dont ya tell Henry  
Dont ya tell Henry  
Apples got your fly  
  
Now I went down to the beanery at half past twelve  
Alookin around just to see myself  
I spotted a horse and a donkey too  
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few  
The said Dont ya tell Henry  
Dont ya tell Henry  
Dont ya tell Henry  
Apples got your fly  
  
Now I went down to the pumphouse the other night  
Alookin around it was outa sight  
I looked high and low for that big ol tree  
I did go upstairs but I didnt see nobody but me  
I said Dont ya tell Henry  
Dont ya tell Henry  
Dont ya tell Henry  
Apples got your fly
