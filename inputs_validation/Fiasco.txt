Im insane in the brain  
Youre not ready to get caught  
Feel the pain rushing through my vain  
Dont you piss me off pretentious ostentatious  
Other words are spring to my head  
 Emolicious for the shoot posses no spine  
  
And you want me to respect you  
And have none for yourself  
Youre out of control with nobody around to help  
Help help oh oh  
  
Chorus  
This time youre on your own  
Running back to mommy hoping that shes home  
But if shes not there and youre on your own  
To whom shall you then go  
Call it a fiasco call it a fiasco  
1 2 3 4  
  
Hustle mind testify you remain oblivious  
Wanna try to testify in the hope of happiness  
Be the best have success  
Doesnt mean youre Hollywood  
  
Feel blessed not impressed  
By the glamour if you think you could  
  
And you want me to respect you  
And have none for yourself  
Youre out of control with nobody around to help  
Help help oh oh  
  
Chorus  
This time youre on your own  
Running back to mommy hoping that shes home  
But if shes not there and youre on your own  
To whom shall you then go  
Call it a fiasco call it a fiasco  
1 2 3 4  
  
Fiasco fiasco  
  
Chorus  
1 2 3 4  
Im calling Im calling Im calling this a fiasco  
Im calling Im calling Im calling this a fiasco  
Im calling Im calling Im calling this a fiasco
