When youre tempted by another who could thrill you through and through  
Think of all the love Im giving love Ill share with only you  
  
Hold to my unchanging love hold to my unchanging love  
Dont go looking for another hold to my unchanging love  
  
There are men who long to hold you and theyll promise you the world  
Dont be fooled by all their wooing I want you to be my girl  
Baby hold to my unchanging love  
Baby wont you hold to my unchanging love
