War  
  
Our government is fucked  
Sure to bring us down  
The media incites civil unrest  
Hatred can bring you down  
  
Chorus  
War  
I dont want your war  
War  
We dont need your war  
We dont need your war  
War  
  
Military beasts starvin countries  
Drama brings you to your knees  
Spill your blood to save humanity  
Dyin for the food we feed  
  
Chorus  
  
Our government is fucked  
Sure to bring us down  
The media incites civil unrest  
Hatred can bring you down  
  
Injustice drives you crazy  
It drive la insane  
In this generation  
Hatred is the name  
  
Chorus  
War  
  
LA 92  
  
Bastard magic should make you cry  
The answer to the question is we aint gonna die  
  
LA 92  
  
Police can make me under stress  
While all LAs a fuckin mess  
Dont patronize my fuckin ass  
Some heads will get crashed  
  
LA 92  
  
Billys got himself a gun  
Hes goin to fuckin war  
He wont revert to sticks and stones  
Just bullet holes and broken bones  
Chaos chaos chaos chaos  
Dont give a fuck  
  
Covert body knock ya down  
No weight support so taken down  
The jukjock a lock in a cell  
We aint got shit now had enough  
Chaos chaos chaos chaos  
Dont give a fuck  
  
Disorder Repeat x8
