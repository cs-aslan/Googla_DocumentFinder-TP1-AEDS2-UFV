Everywhere is freaks and hairies  
Dykes and fairies tell me where is sanity  
Tax the rich feed the poor  
Till there are no rich no more  
  
Id love to change the world  
But I dont know what to do  
So Ill leave it up to you  
  
Population keeps on breeding  
Nation bleeding still more feeding economy  
Life is funny skies are sunny  
Bees make honey who needs money Monopoly  
  
Id love to change the world  
But I dont know what to do  
So Ill leave it up to you  
  
World pollution theres no solution  
Institution electrocution  
Just black and white rich or poor  
Them and us stop the war  
  
Id love to change the world  
But I dont know what to do  
So Ill leave it up to you
