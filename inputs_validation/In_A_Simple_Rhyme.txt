Well back in the past when I was treated so coldly  
My love life was a darn disgrace  
Needed someone to love and hold me  
Thats one of the reasons that I was out of place  
So this is love Well she finally kissed me  
Had me all worked up inside  
I was in love but Cupid missed me  
She up and left and I almost died  
But I was young and I was far from lonely  
I been that way for a long long year  
Needed a girl to call my one and only  
Is that you  
You think you got the intrest  
Cmon and take the time  
Cause you know I want to be  
Yours in a simple rhyme  
Well aint life grand when you finally hit it  
Im always a sucker for a real good time  
Woke up in life to find I almost missed it  
Aint I glad that love is blind  
But I was young and I was far too crazy  
Been that way for a long long time  
Needed a girl but I was just too lazy  
Now that Ive found you  
You think you got the intrest  
Cmon and take the time  
Im gonna be  
Yours in a simple  
Rhyme  
Rhyme  
She made her mountains sing  
Birds against an icy sky  
And I heard bells ringin  
I think I heard an angel sigh And she said  
Therell be times  
There will be times  
Youre gonna hear the angels singin  
Ah  
Ah  
Ah  
You think you got the intrest  
Cmon and take the time  
Im gonna be  
Yours in a simple  
Rhyme
