I got a crib full of corn and a turnin plow  
But the grounds to wet for the hopper now  
Got a cultivator and a double tree  
A leather line for the hull and gee  
Let the thunder roar and the lighting flash  
Im doing alright for Country Trash  
  
Im saving up dimes for a rainy day  
I got about a dollar laid away  
The winds from the south and the fishings good  
Got a pot belly stove and a quart of wood  
Mama turns leftovers into hash  
Im doing alright for Country Trash  
  
I got a machine and a hunting dog  
A cap I ordered from the catalog  
A good tall tree that shades the yard  
A good fat sow for the winters lard  
Let the thunder roar and the lighting flash  
Im doing alright for Country Trash  
  
Well theres not much new ground left to plow  
And the crops need fertilizer now  
My hands dont earn too much gold  
For security when I grow old  
But well all be equal under the grass  
And Gods got a heaven for Country Trash  
And Gods got a heaven for Country Trash  
Ill be doing alright for Country Trash
