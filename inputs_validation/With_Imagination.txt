Ive travelled many a mile  
And I havent found a home  
Ive travelled many a mile  
And one seeds unsown  
Ill travel another mile  
til I finally find my own  
With imagination  
Ill get there  
  
I started with a dream  
But came to a decision  
I started with a dream  
But now I have a mission  
I have a goal  
To see beyond my vision  
With imagination  
Ill get there  
  
Ive got to be strong shannon  
To climb the next hill  
Ive got to be strong russell  
My fate to fulfill  
And from a strength leroy  
Stronger than my will  
With imagination  
Ill get there  
  
In my fathers house  
No harsh words are spoken  
In my fathers house  
No vows are broken  
In a holy place  
My sould like beams oaken  
With imagination  
Ill get there  
  
When weary is your world  
Go and spin another  
When weary is your world  
Theres heaven to discover  
Here on earth  
Were sister and brother  
With imagination  
Well get there  
  
And if I stand alone  
To my cause Im loyal  
If I stand alone  
Either common or royal  
Im not afraid  
To cross their sea of toil  
With imagination  
Ill get there  
  
With imagination  
Ill get there  
  
With imagination  
Ill get there
