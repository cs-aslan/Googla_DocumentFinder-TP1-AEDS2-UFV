So you think that you have seen her  
When youre lying in between her  
And you tell me that you dont care  
Busy bodies getting nowhere  
Evrybodys getting meaner  
Busy bodies  
Caught in the concertina  
  
You check her outline  
Break her regulations  
You watch her legs through several  
Service stations  
  
Busy bodies  
Very busy  
Getting nowhere  
Nowhere nowhere nowhere  
  
Now youre ready for the merger  
With the company youre part of  
And you do the dirty business  
With your latest sleeping partner  
  
Youre becoming  
Automatic  
Busy bodies  
Out playing with the traffic  
  
You want attention  
You try my patience  
With the best intentions you are nothing but a nuisance  
  
Busy bodies  
Busy busy  
Getting nowhere  
Nowhere nowhere nowhere  
  
Now youve given your performance  
Though the matinee was idle  
And you find that a wave of her right hand  
Could seem so tidal  
  
Just a second  
Satisfaction  
Busy bodies  
Temporarily out of action  
  
You wash and brush up  
You want to dress up  
You want to kiss her  
But shes busy with her makeup  
  
Busy bodies  
Very busy  
Getting nowhere  
Nowhere x6
