All you see are endless skies  
Like an ocean lit by fireflies  
With a long deep breath  
I speak my heart  
Saying things  
Im not sure just what they are  
A feeling catches me by surprise  
You can see forever  
In a lovers eyes  
I can stop myself  
But on I go  
Finding feelings  
I have never known  
Theres hope beyond  
Your wildest dreams  
And the feeling  
Is nothing to extreme  
In a flash  
Tomorrow begins to rise  
You can see forever  
In a lovers eyes  
I can see your world  
Beautiful and new  
And although Im not sure  
Where its leading to  
We will travel on  
Our fate unknown  
And for once  
I know Im not alone  
Its a trade we make  
A sacrifice  
Love never ending  
Is surely worth the price  
If we survive  
Love holds no greater price  
You can see forever  
In a lovers eyes
