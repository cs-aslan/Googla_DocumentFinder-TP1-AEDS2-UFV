Sometimes I think  
Things are overwhelming  
Sometimes I think  
I dont know what Ill do  
But I forget the world  
And everything around me  
Thats what I think  
When I think about you  
  
The streets are filled  
With too many babies  
Black air in a sky of blue  
People pass by  
No life in their eyes  
The concrete jungles  
Really going crazy  
  
Sometimes I think  
Things are overwhelming  
  
The rent is due  
And the pockets are empty  
People ask machines  
For the truth  
No crystal ball  
Can help see it all  
But where we gonna find  
The dreams to feed the babies  
  
Baby life goes on  
Thats what people say  
But Im nowhere  
If you go away  
Id just be looking  
For a brighter day  
  
Sometimes I think  
Things are overwhelming  
What can I do  
Forget about the world  
And everything around me  
Thats what I think  
When I think about you
