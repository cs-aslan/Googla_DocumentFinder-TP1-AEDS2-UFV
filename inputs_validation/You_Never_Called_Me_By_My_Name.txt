Well it was all that I could do to keep from cryin  
Sometimes it seemed so useless to remain  
But you dont have to call me darlin darlin  
You never even call me by my name  
You dont have to call me Waylon Jennings  
And you dont have to call me Charley Pride  
And you dont have to call me Merle Haggard anymore  
Even though youre on my figtin side  
And Ill hang around as long as you will let me and I never minded standing in
the rain  
But you dont have to call me darlin darlin you never even call me by my
name  
  
Well Ive heard my name a few times in your phonebook hello hello  
And Ive seen it on signs where Ive played  
But the only time I know Ill hear David Allan Coe  
Is when Jesus has his final judgement day  
So Ill hang around  
  
Well a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song  
And he told me it was the perfect country and western song  
I wrote him back a letter and told him  
It was not the percfect country and western song  
Because he hadnt said anything at all about mama  
Or trains or trucks or prison or gettin drunk  
Well he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent it to me  
And after reading it I realized  
That my friend had written the perfect country and western song  
And I felt obliged to include it on this album the last verse goes like this
here  
  
Well I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison  
And I went to pick her up in the rain  
But before I could get to the station in a pickup truck  
She got rund over by a damned old train  
And Ill hang around
