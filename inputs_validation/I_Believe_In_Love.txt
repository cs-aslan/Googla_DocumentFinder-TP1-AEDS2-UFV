I see faces  
Coverin an empty I  
Empty spaces  
Where there used to be a soul inside  
  
Nothin and no one ever gets to them  
Seems the wind could blow right through them  
Believin in gods that never knew them  
I believe in love  
  
I believe in love I do  
I believe Im feelin good  
Im feeling love  
feeling love is feeling good  
I believe in love  
Feeling love is feeling good  
  
Worry  
Climbin up your money tree  
Youve got to hide it  
Monkey do what the monkey see  
  
Youre on a oneway street and youre speedin  
Missin the signs you should be readin  
Thats the things youll later be needin  
I believe in love  
  
I believe it nobody sold me  
Always knew it nobody told me  
I believe in someone to hold me  
I believe in love  
  
I believe in love I do  
I believe Im feelin good  
Im feeling love  
feeling love is feeling good  
feeling love is feeling good I believe in love  
feeling love is feeling good  
  
I believe in love  
feeling love is feeling good I believe in love  
Feeling love is feeling good  
I believe in love  
Feeling love is feeling good  
I believe in love  
  
Oh never be lonely  
Sleepin in an empty bed  
Shouldnt feel it just a place to rest my head  
  
But I dont want to find myself one day  
Wakin up and lookin at Monday  
With some whatshername left from Sunday  
I believe in love  
  
I believe it nobody sold me  
Always knew it nobody told me  
I believe in someone to hold me  
I believe in love  
  
I believe in love I do  
I believe Im feelin good  
Everybody should  
I believe Im feelin good  
Believe in it  
Believe in love
