I know where Im goin  
Dont you want to come too  
I got my reservations  
And I got one for you  
The trains leavin just after dark  
Theres always room for a lovin heart  
I know where Im goin  
Dont you want to come too  
  
I know my destination  
Its a waitng for me  
I got no hesitation  
Thats where I want to be  
And by the time that the sun comes up  
Ill be drinkin from a lovin cup  
I know where Im goin  
Dont you want to come too  
  
Chorus  
I know why Im singin  
Dont you want to sing too  
Cant you hear the bells a ringin  
Let the spirit move you  
  
Just close your eyes and let it flow  
Lean your head back let it go  
I know where Im goin  
Dont you want to come too  
  
Chorus  
  
I know where Im goin  
Dont you want to come too  
I got my reservations  
And I got you for you  
I know why Im singin  
Dont you want to sing too  
Cant you hear the bells a ringin  
Let the spirit move you  
Spirit move you yeah  
  
I know where Im goin  
Dont you want to come too  
I know where Im goin  
Dont you want to come too
