Im looking out the window pane  
And I hear the sound of pouring rain  
But youre not here  
Where did you go  
  
I want to know what made you go away  
What went wrong  
Im looking out my window pane  
And I hear the sound of pouring rain  
  
Theres noone here to laugh with me  
To make the dark clouds disappear  
My love what went wrong  
Where did you go  there is no answer  
  
I need you now much more that ever  
Where did you go  why cant you be with me  
Where did you go  we were so tender  
Where did you go  why not surrender  
  
Only you can set me free  
Im looking out my window pane Oh yes  
And I hear the sound of pouring rain  
I think of you of someone who can  
  
Always count on love so true  
And Im here  where are you  
Tell me  
I think of you of someone who can  
  
Always count on love so true  
And Im here  where are you  
Where did you go  there is no answer  
I need you now much more that ever  
  
Where did you go  why cant you be with me  
Where did you go  we were so tender  
Where did you go  why not surrender  
Only you can set me free  
  
Where did you go  there is no answer  
I need you now much more that ever  
  
Where did you go  why cant you be with me  
Where did you go  we were so tender  
Where did you go  why not surrender  
Only you can set me free
