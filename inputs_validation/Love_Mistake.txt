KC  
Take another sipowine  
You gotta get her off your mind  
You can talk about your heartbreak to me  
Ok KC I wish it could be easy  
Just another lesson of the heart  
KC  
We were feelin out of place  
So we made our own escape  
In that New York cafe place to be  
Outsider traveler you and me  
We were laughing about it  
Kept us out of reach  
I wont forget that night  
I wont forget that light  
Through the window and the lace  
Making patterns on your face  
Exposed with all your pain  
I know it hurts the worst  
That very first love mistake  
You said well still be sitting  
Here again someday  
Laughing at ourselves this way  
After time has healed and made it right  
Well still be looking in each others eyes  
And through it all  
Its friends who will survive  
I wont forget that night  
I wont forget that light  
Through the window and the lace  
Making patterns on your face  
Exposed with pain  
I know it hurts the worst  
That very first love mistake  
I wont forget that night  
I wont forge that light  
Through the window and the lace  
Making patterns on your face  
Exposed with all your pain  
I know it hurts the worst  
That very first love mistake
