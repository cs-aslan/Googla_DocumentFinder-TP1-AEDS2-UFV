Another night another drink  
Another time to contemplate and think  
Will I ever ever have anyone to love  
  
Its not that I dont try  
Maybe I try too hard  
Seems like Im living a lie  
So theres a game I just wont learn  
And I wonder will I always be alone  
I take a sip and wonder  
Why I havent anyone to love  
  
I guess Ill say goodnight  
My drinks done and its morning light  
Sorry my friend but you see  
What other ending could there be  
And I wonder will I always be alone  
I take a drink and wonder  
Will I ever have anyone to love
