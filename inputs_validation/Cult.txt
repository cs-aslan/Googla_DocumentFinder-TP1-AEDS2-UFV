Oppression is the holy law  
In God I distrust  
Italic monuments will fall  
Like ashes to dust  
Its war and creed the master plan  
The battles where it all began  
Its propaganda shouts despair  
And sends this virus everywhere  
  
Religion is hate  
Religion is fear  
Religion is war  
Religion is rape  
Religion is obscene  
Religion is a whore  
  
The pestilence of Jesus Christ  
There never was a sacrifice  
No man who hung the crucifix  
Beware the call for purity  
Infections their facility  
Ive made my choice  
666  
  
Carussa Greens a pedophile  
No praying for the priest  
Confession finds a lonely child  
Now preys on the weak  
You think your soul can still be saved  
I think youre fucking miles away  
Scream out loud heres where you begin  
Forgive me Father for I have sinned  
  
Religion is hate  
Religion is fear  
Religion is war  
Religion is rape  
Religion is obscene  
Religion is a whore  
  
The targets fucking Jesus Christ  
The one Id love to sacrifice  
Id nail him to the crucifix  
Beware the call for purity  
Infections their facility  
Ive made my choice  
666  
  
Jesus is pain  
Jesus is gore  
Jesus is the blood that is spilled in war  
Hes everything  
Hes all things dead  
Hes pulling down the trigger pointed at your head  
The fear your shoulded to the front  
Revelation Revolution  
I see through your cracked illusion  
  
The war on terror just drags along  
My holy god its growing strong  
Its propaganda shouts despair  
And sends this virus everywhere  
  
Religion is hate  
Religion is fear  
Religion is war  
Religion is rape  
Religion is obscene  
Religion is a whore  
  
There is no fucking Jesus Christ  
There never was a sacrifice  
No man upon the crucifix  
Beware the call for purity  
Infections their facility  
Ive made my choice  
666
