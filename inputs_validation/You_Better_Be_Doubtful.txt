Tinker you better place another bet  
The rich up in the castle havent finished eating yet  
Theyll throw you a bone or a spatout stone  
But knowing them thats all youll get  
Tailor you better close another shop  
Noone wants your quality make do with what youve got  
Theyll let you survive  
Thell let you get by  
But knowing them theyll let you rot  
  
You better be doubtful  
You better beware  
You better not shout now  
You better not care  
  
Tinker you better buy another boot  
Those Pocock Continental are finally showing through  
Well get you a pair  
From a secondhand fair  
Theyll only have a two  
  
Sailor you better sink a few more ships  
Admiral loony Nelson cannot find his game of risk  
Well lose a few lives  
A couple of tribes  
But knowing him hell like his lips  
  
You better be doubtful  
You better beware  
You better not shout now  
You better not care  
  
From Queen Wilkinds to Queen Victoria  
Weve had a promising side  
From King Callaghan to Bonny Prince Francis  
Weve paid up and weve cried  
Princess Gower and Princess Ferguson  
Weve looked a hard nut to crack  
But were weak at theBack
