You were the sweetest thing that I ever knew  
But I dont care for sugar honey if I cant have you  
Since youve abandoned me  
My whole life has crashed  
Wont you pick the pieces up  
Cause it feels just like Im walking on broken glass  
Walking on walking on broken glass  
The suns still shining in the big blue sky  
But it dont mean nothing to me  
Oh let the rain come down  
Let the wind blow through me  
Im living in an empty room  
With all the windows smashed  
And Ive got so little left to lose  
That it feels just like Im walking on broken glass  
Walking on walking on broken glass  
And if youre trying to cut me down  
You know that I might bleed  
Cause if youre trying to cut me down  
I know that youll succeed  
And if you want to hurt me  
Theres nothing left to fear  
Cause if you want to hurt me  
Youre doing really well my dear  
Now everyone of us was made to suffer  
Everyone of us was made to weep  
But weve been hurting one another  
And now the pain has cut too deep  
So take me from the wreckage  
Save me from the blast  
Lift me up and take me back  
Dont let me keep on walking  
Walking on broken glass  
Walking on walking on broken
