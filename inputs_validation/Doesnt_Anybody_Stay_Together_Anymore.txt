You keep on walking so you dont fall down  
Its the same old story  
You keep on hiding so you cant be found  
Its the same old story  
Oh but I know you youre the one who ran  
You know why its because you can oh  
Its alright cause I dont mind  
Im just trying to help but I wonder why  
Doesnt anybody stay together anymore  
I wonder why doesnt anybody stay together anymore  
  
My friends keep falling and they cant get up  
Its the same old story  
Well one says white and the other one black  
Its the same old story  
And I dont know why you keep emotions walled up  
Your hearts on your sleeve but your sleeve is rolled up  
But its alright cause I dont mind  
Im just trying to help but I wonder why  
Doesnt anybody stay together anymore  
I wonder why doesnt anybody stay together anymore  
  
Things can change from a misunderstanding  
Nobody talks nobody hears oh oh oh  
Makes me wonder why doesnt anybody stay together anymore  
Oh I wonder why doesnt anybody stay together anymore  
  
You keep on looking for that higher ground  
Its the same old story  
Your glass is empty and the chips are down  
Its the same old story  
But I dont know why your emotions walled up  
Your hearts on your sleeve but your sleeve is rolled up  
But its alright cause I dont mind  
Im just trying to help but I wonder why  
  
Doesnt anybody stay together anymore  
I wonder why doesnt anybody stay together anymore  
Oh I wonder why doesnt anybody stay together anymore
