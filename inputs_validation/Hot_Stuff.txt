Im ready for you  
Are you ready for me  
Ive got a burning heart  
It wont let me be  
I feel the hunger my spirit yearns  
Ive got to feed the fever  
Of a love that burns  
  
I walk the street round midnight  
Looking for a little hot stuff  
I cant get enough  
I just cant get enough hot stuff  
Hot stuff hot stuff  
  
Im hard to handle  
Too hot to hold  
I cant seem to satisfy  
My heart an soul  
I need a woman to set me free  
A little Miss Understanding  
To feel the need in me  
  
I walk the street round midnight  
Looking for a little hot stuff  
I cant get enough  
I just cant get enough hot stuff  
Cant get enough hot stuff  
I just cant get enough hot stuff  
Cant get enough  
  
Im ready for you  
Are you ready for me  
Ive got a burning heart  
It wont let me be  
I feel the hunger my spirit yearns  
Ive got to feed the fever  
Of a love that burns  
  
I walk the street round midnight  
Looking for a little hot stuff  
I cant get enough  
I just cant get enough hot stuff  
Cant get enough hot stuff  
Cant get enough hot stuff  
Hot stuff hot stuff  
Hot stuff hot stuff  
Hot stuff hot stuff  
Hot stuff hot stuff  
I just cant get enough hot stuff  
I just cant get enough hot stuff  
Cant get enough hot stuff  
I just cant get enough hot stuff  
  
Hot stuff cant get enough hot stuff
