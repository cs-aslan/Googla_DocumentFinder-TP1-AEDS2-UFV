Go go go go  
Come on and dance with me  
Go go go go  
In to a trance with me  
Go go go go  
And try romance with me  
Dont stop dont stop go go go go  
Go go go go  
The musics bright tonight  
Go go go go  
And hold me tight tonight  
Go go go go  
I fell so right tonight  
Dont stop dont stop go go go go  
This heart of mine is beating overtime  
Its four leaf clover time  
Its love Its love its love its love  
Go go go go  
And swing me round the floor  
Go go go go  
And kiss me more and more  
Go go go go  
What are we waiting for  
Dont stop dont stop go go go go go go  
Go go go go
