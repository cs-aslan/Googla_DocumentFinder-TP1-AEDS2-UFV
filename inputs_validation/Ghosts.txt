Theres a ghost down in the hall  
Theres a ghoul upon the bed  
Theres something in the walls  
Theres blood up on the stairs  
  
And its floating through the room  
And theres nothing I can see  
And I know that thats the truth  
Because now its onto me  
  
I dont understand it  
Hey  
I dont understand it  
Aaow  
  
Theres a tappin in the floor  
Theres a creak behind the door  
Theres a rocking in the chair  
But theres noone sitting there  
  
Theres a ghostly smell around  
But nobody to be found  
And a coughin and a yawnin  
Where a restless soul is going  
  
Dont understand it  
Hey  
Dont understand it  
Hey  
  
And who gave you the right to shake my family  
And who gave you the right to shake my baby she needs me  
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree  
You put a knife in my back  
  
Shot an arrow in me  
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy  
The ghost of jealousy  
  
Theres a tappin in the floor  
Theres a creak behind the door  
Theres a rocking in the chair  
But nobodys sitting there  
  
Theres a ghostly smell around  
But nobody to be found  
And a coughin and a yawnin  
Where a restless soul is going

And who gave you the right to scare my baby she needs me  
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree  
And who gave you the right to take intrusion to see me  
  
And who gave you the right to shake my family  
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby she needs me  
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree  
You put a knife in my back  
  
Shot an arrow in me

A suckin ghost of jealousy  
Aaow  
  
And who gave you the right to shake my family  
And who gave you the right to shake my baby she needs me  
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree
