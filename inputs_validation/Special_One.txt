I know youre someones daughter  
You know Im somebodys son  
We spent our lives until this moment  
Looking for the special one  
  
Nobody gave us the directions  
To this life we have to live  
Although weve both been taken  
Weve got so much left to give  
  
So much left to give  
I know its right behind me  
The blue highway that Ive run  
It led me here to find you  
  
Its worth everything Ive done  
To find my special one  
Now Ive found my special one  
Now Ive found my special one  
  
Maybe we wont find the answers  
Maybe life is just a song  
It may be imagination  
But the vision seems so strong  
  
From the first time that I saw you  
I knew how it would be  
The world is full of wonder  
It takes both of us to see  
  
It takes both of us to see  
I know its right behind me  
The blue highway that Ive run  
It led me here to find you  
  
Its worth everything Ive done  
To find my special one  
Now Ive found my special one
