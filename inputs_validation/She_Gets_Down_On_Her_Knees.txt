Ahah ahah  
Ahah ahah  
  
She gets down on her knees to throw up life  
She gets down on her knees to throw up life  
She gets down on her knees to throw up life  
Thats the only thing she does it good  
  
Mm   
Mm   
  
Room to room flushing away her memory  
Bay to bay washing out her history  
  
Ahah  
She gets down on her knees to make up life  
She gets down on her knees to make up life  
She gets down on her knees to make up life  
Thats the only way she has it good  
  
Shes a mainliner whos never took a main line  
Shes a one liner whos never found the one line  
She goes from one bay to another looking for a liner  
  
Going down down down down to feel the ground  
Coming up up up up to make the flight  
  
Mm   
Mm   
  
Shes a line thrower dip it in a honey bowl  
Shes a line burner rub it in with vinegar and oil  
She goes from one sky to another looking for a liner  
  
Going down down down down to feel the ground  
Coming up up up up to make the flight  
Going down down down down to feel the ground  
Coming up up up up to make the flight  
  
Ah  
Ah  
  
Ah   
Blur patches in the clouded sky  
Too high to catch her tears and sighs  
Looking over tenderly  
  
Ah  
Ah  
Ah  
Ah  
Ah ah
