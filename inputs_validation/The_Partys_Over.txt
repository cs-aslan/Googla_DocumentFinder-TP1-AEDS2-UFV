You never call me up  
When Im alone at night  
What can this poor boy do  
When hes hopelessly in love with you  
So I will tell you now  
This love is fallin down  
Just what more can I do  
When Im hopelessly in love with you  
  
  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love with you  
  
  
So I will tell you this  
Our love is in a fix  
Just what more can I do  
When Im hopelessly in love with you  
  
  
You never call me up  
When Im alone at night  
What can this poor boy do  
When hes hopelessly in love with you  
  
  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love with you  
  
  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love  
Im hopelessly in love with you  
  
  
Oh byebye baby  
The partys over  
I have gone away  
The partys over  
I have gone away  
The partys over  
I have gone away  
The partys over  
I have gone away  
Oo the partys over  
I have gone away
