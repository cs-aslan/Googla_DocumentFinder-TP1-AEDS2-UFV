As you awoke this morning  
And opened up your eyes  
Did you notice the tearstains  
Lining your face were mine  
  
Dont you wonder cant you see  
Whats happening to our lives  
I cant keep living this masquerade  
When my lonely eyes see only your face at night  
  
I only see in infrared  
I cant dream anymore  
cant you see I need too  
I cant stand the pain  
  
Youve gathered all my secrets  
And I dont know who I am  
I even feel alone when youre near  
Cause youll never understand  
  
When we first met I must have seemed  
A million miles away  
Its strange how our lives have touched  
But the time is right  
Ill leave tonight  
Dont look in my eyes  
Cause youve never seen them so black  
  
I only see in infrared  
I cant dream anymore  
cant you see I need to  
I cant stand the pain
