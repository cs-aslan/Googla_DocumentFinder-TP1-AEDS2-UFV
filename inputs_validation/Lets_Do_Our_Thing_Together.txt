I dont need no fields of whiskey  
Dont indulge in beer or wine  
But baby you turn me on  
And blow my everlovin mind  
Now lets do our thing together  
Go out and have a balling time  
You know I dig you doing your thing  
And Ill turn you on when I do mine  
Im not a blueblood or a scholar  
Just a hardworkin boy  
And after five long days  
My body needs a little joy  
Now lets do our thing together  
Go out and have a balling time  
You know I dig you doing your thing  
And Ill turn you on when I do mine  
I am solid sane and sober  
And Im over twentyone  
What I see is what I want  
And what I want is you right on  
Now lets do our thing together  
Go out and have a balling time  
You know I dig you doing your thing  
And Ill turn you on when I do mine  
Im in the mood for a little rockin  
You got to shake it up and shout  
You been a little uptight lately  
Im goin let it all hang out  
Lets do our thing together  
Go out and have a balling time  
You know I dig you doing your thing
