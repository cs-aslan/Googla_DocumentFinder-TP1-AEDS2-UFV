From the window of our honeymoon  
The night looks a might bizarre  
Theyre burning us in effigy  
And smokes blots out the stars  
  
Theyre torturing our servants  
By the light of an armoured car  
Please dont ask if its the end of the line  
As I never could see that far  
  
Tonight Id rather look at you  
How beautiful you are  
If they ask you what are lovers  
Tell them lovers are  
  
Set against the order  
We live outside the law  
Im no hero under torture  
Ill tell them all I heard and saw  
  
I saw everything in you my love  
How beautiful you are  
  
Through a broken telescope  
We focus on the stars  
I dont want my vision magnified  
I dont need to see that far  
  
From the window of our honeymoon  
Draw the curtains cross the bars  
Lets spare ourselves the spectacle  
The problems theirs not ours  
Tonight Id rather look at you  
  
How beautiful you are  
How beautiful you are  
How beautiful  
How beautiful  
How beautiful you are  
You are
