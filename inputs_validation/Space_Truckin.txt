We had a lot of luck on Venus  
We always had a ball on Mars  
Meeting all the groovey people  
Weve rocked the Milky Way so far  
We danced around with Borealice  
Were space truckin round the the stars  
Come on lets go Space Truckin  
  
Remember when we did the moonshot  
And Pony Trekker led the way  
Wed move to the Canaveral moonstop  
And everynaut would dance and sway  
We got music in our solar system  
Were space truckin round the stars  
Come on lets go Space Truckin  
  
The fireball that we rode was moving  
But now weve got a new machine  
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah the freaks said  
Man those cats can really swing  
They got music in their solar system  
Theyve rocked around the Milky Way  
They dance around the Borealice  
Theyre Space Truckin everyday  
Come on
