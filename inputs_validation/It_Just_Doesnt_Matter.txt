Matter matter oh no no  
  
If i havent got any friends  
It just doesnt matter  
If nobody understands well  
It just doesnt matter  
If Im not good to anyone  
It just doesnt matter  
If Im completely alone  
It just doesnt matter  
  
If Ive been misunderstood  
It just doesnt matter  
My best friends think Im no good  
It just doesnt matter  
If my horoscope looks bad  
It just doesnt matter  
My girlfriend even thinks Im mad  
It just doesnt matter  
  
Instrumental  
  
If my world falls apart  
It just doesnt matter  
Ill pick it up right from the start  
It just doesnt matter  
 Me up  
It just doesnt matter  
My children have had enough  
It just doesnt matter  
  
Matter matter oh no no
