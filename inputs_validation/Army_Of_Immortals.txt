Battle hymns did sound the call  
You came to our side  
You heard true metal  into glory  
Ride  
You stood beside us the false ones  
Cried  Your love is judgment  
You gave us life  
You wait in the rain  you walk  
Through the snow We give you  
Our blood We want you to know  
In our eyes yourre immortal   
In our hearts youll live forever   
In our eyes yourre immortal   
In our hearts youll live forever  
We have read your letters   
We have heard your call  
We were brought together   
Cause weve got the balls   
To play the loudest metal  
So hard and so wild and mean   
Youll live forever we were  
Born from your belief  
Metal makes us strong  
Together we belong  forever  
Heres your song We want you  
To know  
In our eyes youre immortal   
In our hearts youll live forever   
In our eyes youre immortal   
In our hearts youll live forevermore  
Metal makes us strong  
Together we belong  forever  
Heres your song We want you  
To know  
In our eyes youre immortal   
In our hearts youll live forever   
In our eyes youre immortal   
In our hearts youll live forevermore
