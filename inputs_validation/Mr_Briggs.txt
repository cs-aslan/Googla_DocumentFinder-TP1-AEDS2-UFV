Mr Briggs is on holiday  
But he stays in his room  
Hes too cold to go out for his evening smoke  
The lady down the hallway  
Is deaf and dumb to what you say  
Shes too busy dreaming of chihuahua dog  
Say goodbye  
Slowly drift away  
To somewhere  
Mr Briggs needs sleep now  
Hes been up for a week  
He can hear a buzz buzz buzzing in his head  
He has a threebar heater  
But it cant keep him warm  
If he bought another then hed have three more  
Say goodbye  
Slowly drift away  
To somewhere  
Mr Briggs while on holiday  
Never left his bed  
Walked around in circles but only in his head  
The lady down the hallway  
Is running out of pills  
She could pull herself together but she knows she never will  
Say goodbye  
Slowly drift away  
To somewhere
