Shes cool as ice Im hypnotized  
My heart is crying just for more  
No guarantee she stays with me  
Shes my dream I cant ignore  
  
How can I just explain to her  
That shes my baby oh I swear  
How can I just explain my love  
  
Chorus  
Oh I am higher than heaven higher than heaven  
In the middle of the night of the night  
Feeling like the greatest lover greatest lover  
And I need you by my side  
Oh one two three lovers live longer  
Oh cant you see love makes me stronger  
  
Shes cool as ice shes cool as ice  
  
Im specialized  in lonely eyes  
I cant explainthe way I feel  
Night after night  the stars shine bright  
Youre my baby oh its real  
  
How can I just explain to you  
Tell me what have I got to do  
How can I just explain my love  
  
Chorus x 2
