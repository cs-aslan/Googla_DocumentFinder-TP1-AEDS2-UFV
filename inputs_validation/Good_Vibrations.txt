I I love the colorful clothes she wears  
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair  
I hear the sound of a gentle word  
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

Shes giving me excitationsOom bop bop excitations

Shes somehow closer now  
Softly smile I know she must be kind  
When I look in her eyes  
She goes with me to a blossom world

Shes giving me excitations
