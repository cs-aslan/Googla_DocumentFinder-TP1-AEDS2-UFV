Down at the best spot  
Its me and JD and they sellin more birds than a pet shop  
The spots hot and everybody nervous  
Thats when the blue car served us  
Oh why did fools had to let loose  
Heard six pops from a deuce deuce  
Big Tom had to push us  
13 niggas runnin straight to the bushes  
For they gats so they could draw down  
But why a motherfucker like me had to fall down  
Not known why I dropped out  
Fuck it still cant afford to get popped out  
So now I gotta jet  
Only ran one block but my shirt soakin wet  
Tryin to see if we got him  
Looked down at my sweatshirt red at the bottom  
Didnt panic but I still looked cracked out  
Yelled to the homies then I blacked out  
  
Woke up in the back of a tray  
On my way to MLK  
That the county hospital jack  
Where niggas die over a little scratch  
Still sittin in the trauma center  
In my back is where the bullet entered  
Yo nurse Im gettin kind of warm  
Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin form  
Coughin up blood on my hands and knees  
Then I heard freeze nigger dont move  
Yo I didnt do a thing  
Didnt want to go out like my man Rodney King  
Still got gaffled  
Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel  
Now Im handcuffed  
Being asked information on my gang affiliation  
I dont bang I rock the good rhymes  
And Im a victim of neighborhood crime  
  
I need to see a MD  
And yall motherfuckers giving me the third degree  
Look at the waiting room  
Its filled to the rim like the county jail day room  
Nobody gettin help  
Since we poor  
The hospital move slow  
Now Im laid out  
People steppin over me to get closer to the tv  
Just like a piece of dog shit  
Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet  
One hour done passed  
Done watched two episodes of MASH  
And when Im almost through  
They call my name and put me on ICU  
Halfway dead  
No respect and handcuffed to the bed  
Now the trauma starts  
Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart  
So I begin the ass kissin  
Just to get looked at by an overworked physician  
Got the chills but my temperatures 103  
Only got a bandaid and an IV  
Thats when I start cussin  
Police steady askin me who did the bustin  
  
Why oh why cant I get help  
Cause Im black I gots to go for self  
Too many black bodies the hospital housin  
So at 10 PM I was Audi 5000
