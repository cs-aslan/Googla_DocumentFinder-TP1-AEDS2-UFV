Beautiful beautiful beautiful truth  
Dont leave because I cant see you  
You know the hours that I passed without you  
Every heartbeat that I chose to flout you  
And how I felt no shame  
I know this problem is of my own making  
I know youre giving here and Im not taking  
But please dont leave this place  
Let me complicate what you made simple  
By looking fancy or sounding boastful  
Please bring me down  
Arid now that I have said whats on my mind  
And its obvious that I am blind  
Please say youll stay  
Spin me round  
Bring me down  
He my sound  
But dont leave
