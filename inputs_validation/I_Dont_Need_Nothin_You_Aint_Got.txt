Well I dont need a caddy to make me happy  
Or a flat up on park avenue  
I dont need riches or treasures  
All those high priced pleasures darling  
All I need is you  
  
Chorus  
I know I dont need nothing you aint got  
If you were coffee in the morning  
Well Id drink that whole pot  
Cause you got everything all them others do not  
Darling I dont need nothing you aint got  
  
Now Lord knows you aint a saint  
Robert Redford you aint  
But you got a heart of gold through and through  
And when it comes to loving  
All that kissing and hugging  
Aint nobody else ever gonna do  
  
Chorus  
  
Well now who thought Id be satisfied  
With just one guy by my side  
Oh Lordy Lordy look at me  
But hon youre different from the rest  
Im here to confess  
That love from you is all Im ever gonna need  
  
Well I dont need a caddy to make me happy  
Or a flat up on park avenue  
I dont need riches or treasures  
All those high priced pleasures darling  
All I need is you  
  
Chorus
