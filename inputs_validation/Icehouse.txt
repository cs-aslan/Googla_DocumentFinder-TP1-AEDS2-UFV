Im playing at ice  
But Im finding it hard  
She didnt break the wall  
She just caught me off guard  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
  
Im just a little bit sorry  
But I havent decided why  
Could it be my memory  
Or did I ever really cry  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
  
Fill my head with your false feelings  
I cant trust anything you say  
Today I missed a special friend  
That never really cared anyway  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes
