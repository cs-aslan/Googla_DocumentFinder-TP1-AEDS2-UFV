This old town aint been the same  
Since this old boys been gone  
Lord I still got some good friends  
But I feel so all alone  
All I hear is disco  
See pretty boys with high heels on  
Well some people sure hate me  
And police dog me round  
Well the only place Im welcome  
Is on the west side of town  
Well Im on the wanted posters  
I cant show my face in town alright  
Play this one for south side  
Jacksonville I love you  
But you dont want me around  
Jacksonville you raised me  
And this is where I got my sound  
Although Im your outlaw  
I still love my hometown all around  
Ahh this is for the west side boys  
This old town aint been the same  
Since your native sons been gone  
Lord I still got some old friends  
But I am so all alone  
All I hear is disco  
See pretty boys with high heels on  
Well you can keep your disco  
Pretty boys with high heels on
