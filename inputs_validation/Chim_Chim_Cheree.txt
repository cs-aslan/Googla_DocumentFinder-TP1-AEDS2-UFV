Chim chimney  
Chim chimney  
Chim chim cheree  
A sweep is as lucky  
As lucky can be  
  
Chim chimney  
Chim chimney  
Chim chim cheroo  
Good luck will rub off when  
I shake ands with you  
Or blow me a kiss  
And thats lucky too  
  
Now as the ladder of life  
As been strung  
You may think a sweeps  
On the bottommost rung  
  
Though I spends me time  
In the ashes and smoke  
In this ole wide world  
Theres no appier bloke  
  
Up where the smoke is  
All billered and curled  
Tween pavement and stars  
Is the chimney sweep world  
  
When thes ardly no day  
Nor ardly no night  
Theres things alf in shadow  
And alf way in light  
On the roof tops of London  
Coo what a sight  
  
I choose me bristles with pride  
Yes I do  
A broom for the shaft  
And a broom for the flume  
  
Though Im covered with soot  
From me ead to me toes  
A sweep knows es welcome  
Wherever e goes  
  
Chim chimney  
Chim chimney  
Chim chim cheree  
When youre with a sweep  
Youre in glad company  
  
No where is there  
A more appier crew  
Than them wot sings  
Chim chim cheree  
Chim cheroo  
  
On the chim chimney  
Chim chim cheree  
Chim cheroo
