Well hello there  
My its been a long long time  
How am I doin  
Oh well I guess Im doin fine  
Its been so long now and it seems that  
It was only yesterday  
Mmm aint it funny how time slips away  
Hows your new love  
I hope that hes doin fine  
Heard you told him yes baby  
That youd love him till the end of time  
Well you know thats the same thing  
That you told me  
Well it seems like just the other day  
Mmm aint it funny how time slips away  
Gotta go now  
Guess Ill see you hanging round  
Dont know when though oh  
Never know when Ill be back in town  
But I remember what I told you  
That in time your gonna pay  
Well aint it surprisin how time slips away  
Yeah aint it surprisin how time slips away
