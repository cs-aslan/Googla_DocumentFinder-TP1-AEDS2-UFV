Hello mudda hello fadda  
Here I am at camp granada  
Camp is very entertaining  
They say well have some fun when it stops raining  
  
I went hiking with joe spivy  
He developed poison ivy  
You remeber leonard skinner  
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner  
  
All the counslers hate the waiters  
And the lake has alligators  
And the head coach wants no sissies  
So he reads to us from something called uylesses  
  
I dont want this should I scare ya  
But my bunk mate has malaria  
You remember jeffery hardy  
Theyre about to organize a searching party  
  
Take me home o mudda fudda  
Take me home I hate granada  
Dont leave me out in the forest  
Where I might get eaten by a bear  
  
Take me home I promise I will not make noise  
Or mess the house with other boys  
O please dont make me stay  
Ive been here one whole day  
  
Dearest fadda darling mudda  
Hows my precious little brudda  
Let me come home if you miss me  
I would even let aunt bertha hug and kiss me  
  
Wait a minute it stopped hailing  
Guys are swimming gals are sailing  
Playing base ball gee thats bedda  
Mudda fudda kindly disregard this letter
