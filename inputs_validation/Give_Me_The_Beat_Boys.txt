Day after day Im more confused  
But I look for the light through the pouring rain  
You know thats a game that I hate to lose  
Now Im feeling the straine  
Aint it a shame  
  
Chorus  
Oh give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll  
And drift away  
  
Beginning to think that Im wasting time  
I dont understand the things I do  
The world outside looks so unkind  
Im counting on you  
To carry me through  
  
Chorus  
  
And when my mind is free you know melody can move me  
And when Im feeling blue the guitars coming through to soothe me  
Thanks for the joy that youve given me  
I want you to know I believe in your song  
Your rhythm and rhyme and harmony  
Youve helped me along  
Youre making me strong  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat chorus 2 times  
  
Now now now wont you take me  
Oh oh take me  
Fly high
