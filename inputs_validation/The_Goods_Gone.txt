I know when Ive had enough  
When I think your love is rough  
  
Chorus  
The goods gone  
The goods gone  
The goods gone  
The goods gone  
The goods gone out of our love  
I know its wrong  
We should enjoy it but  
The goods gone  
The goods gone  
  
Once we used to get along  
Now each time we kiss its wrong  
  
Chorus  
  
Now it aint no fun  
And the goods gone now  
We used to love as one  
But we have forgotten now  
  
I know when Ive had enough  
When I think your love is rough  
  
Chorus  
  
Its gone forever
