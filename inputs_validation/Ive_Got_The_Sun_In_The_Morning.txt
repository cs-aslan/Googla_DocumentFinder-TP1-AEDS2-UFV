Taking stock of what I have and what I havent  
Though I find the things Ive got will keep me satisfied  
Checking up on what I have and what I havent  
Though I find a healthy balance on the credit side  
Got no diamonds got no pearls  
Still I think Im a lucky girl  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Got no mansion got no yacht  
Still Im happy with what Ive got  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Sunshine gives me a lucky day  
Moonshine gives me the Milky Way  
Got no checkbook got no bank  
Still Id like to express my thanks  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning and the moon at night Im alright  
Got no butler got no maid still I think Ive been overpaid  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Shes got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Got no silver got no gold what youve got cant be bought or sold  
Got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Shes got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Sunshine gives me a lucky day  
Moonshine gives me the Milky Way  
Got no diamonds got no pearls  
Still Ms Annies a lucky girl  
Got the sun in the morning sun in the morning  
Got the moon in the evening moon in the evening  
Got the sun in the morning and the moon in the evening  
And Im doing alright  
Got the sun in the morning  
Got the moon in the evening  
Im doing alright
