Ill get by as long as I have you  
Though therell be rain and darkness too  
Ill not complain Ill live with you  
  
Poverty may come to me thats true  
But what care I  
Ill get by as long as I have you  
  
Ill get by as long as I have you  
Though therell be rain and darkness too  
Ill not complain Ill live with you  
  
Poverty may come to me thats true  
But what care I  
Ill get by as long as I have you
