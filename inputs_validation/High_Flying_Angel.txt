While the city starts to sleep  
Shes watching over you  
Smoke hangs on the downtown skyline  
Moon pushes through  
But some peoples on fire tonight  
Wind rushing round their feet  
Someones gonna sleep well tonight  
Word is on the street  
  
So high flyer high flyer  
Fly high tonight  
Fly angel fly higher  
Fly here tonight  
  
Its a tribal thing were seeing  
War paint on the face  
A question of territory pride and space  
People strutting and feathers flying  
Its a sorry scene  
Someones sleeping well tonight  
Word is on the street  
  
So high flyer high flyer  
Fly high tonight  
Fly angel fly higher  
Fly here tonight  
  
Brother my brother  
Dont let me down again  
Mother oh mother  
Wipe away your tears again  
  
High flying bird embraced him  
Held him to her breast  
Soft feathers brushed his face  
Finally came to rest  
Gently rocking him to and fro  
He quietly went to sleep  
Someones found a place of peace tonight  
Word is on the street  
So high flyer high flyer  
Fly high tonight  
Fly angel fly higher  
Fly away tonight  
  
High flyer high flyer  
Fly high tonight  
Fly angel fly higher  
Fly safe tonight
