Nashville tears are lonely signs that point to broken hearts  
Broken lives and families that love has split apart  
Children who miss daddy mommys on the run  
The pleasure that is painful and hidden from the sun  
  
Nashville hearts are lonely words that speak of love gone wrong  
Sad and soulful stories and beautiful love songs  
Foe each and every melody of happiness denied  
You know that theres another one that shows the other side  
  
Country love is kisses in the kitchen  
Country love is honest and its true  
Country love is home with your family  
County loves the way that I love you  
  
Country love is silky nights and warm familiar hands  
Someone whos been there before and always understands  
  
Nashville nights are lonely roads that weve all traveled on  
Sometimes they take you far away or they can bring you home  
If youre lost out on the highway do not deny the dove  
When Nashville nights the question the answers country love  
  
Country love is kisses in the kitchen  
Country love is honest and its true  
Country love is home with your family  
County loves the way that I love you  
  
Country love is kisses in the kitchen  
Country love is honest and its true  
Country love is home with your family  
County loves the way that I love you
