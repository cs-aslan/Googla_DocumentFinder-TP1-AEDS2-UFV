Day drinkin just stinkin out loud  
Sundowns come down along with that nighttime crowd  
Bookends good friends thoughts of the past  
Your time is my time as long as it last  
I felt too good for too long to feel as blue as I do  
Chain smokin all jokin aside  
Wishin and waitin and hesitatin tryin to take it all in stride  
Night flight back home everythings changed  
All night tonight my thoughts rearranged  
I felt too good for too long to feel as blue as I do  
  
Night hawkin talkin out of my head  
Hometown show down give me the lowdown  
But please dont tell me what you think I said  
Give me the feeling Im on the right track  
Catch me a night train I aint comin back  
I felt too good for too long to feel as blue as I do  
I felt too good for too long to feel as blue as I do
