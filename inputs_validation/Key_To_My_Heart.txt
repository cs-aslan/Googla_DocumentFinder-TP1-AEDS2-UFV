Ah Yeah yeah Ahh  
  
I need some time  
To make up my mind mind  
Youve got the key to my heart key to my heart  
Baby dont you ever go away go away  
  
Sitting here thinking about the time we first met  
It brings a smile to my face  
No one else could ever take your place  
Yet Im afraid of falling in love  
The joy the pain that love can bring  
Promise me youll never leave my side  
  
Your kind of love kind of love  
Is very special very special  
Our love sent from heaven above heaven above  
  
Chorus  
I need some time I need some time  
To make up my mind  
Youve got the key to my heart key to my heart  
Baby dont you ever go away too far  
I need you safe in my arms safe in my arms  
Youve got the key to my heart  
Baby please dont you ever leave my side  
  
So weve touched  
I dont wanna rush this feeling  
Relax your mind its all that goes  
I know you ever felt this way before  
Love is to control  
And Im the one you want to hold  
I know that you want me  
And boy you know I really want you too  
  
Your kind of love kind of love  
Is very special very special  
Our love sent from heaven above heaven above  
  
Chorus  
  
I need some time I want you to stay I want you to say  
To make up my mind I want to hold you  
Youve got the key to my heart key to my heart  
Baby dont you walk away too times promise me well never part  
I need you safe in my arms safe in my arms  
Youve got the key to my heart  
Baby please dont you ever leave my side
