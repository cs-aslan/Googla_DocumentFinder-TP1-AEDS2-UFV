You make my eyes run over all the time and youre happy when Im out of my
mind  
You dont love me but you wont let me be dont you ever get tired of hurtin
me  
You must think that I look bad with a smile  
For you havent let me have one in such a long long while  
Still I keep running back how can this be dont you ever get tired of hurtin
me  
  
You must think that I look bad  
Dont you ever get tired of hurtin me
