Alright  
  
Well the night keeps gettin shorter  
And the day keeps getting near  
And your daddy wants to give up his daughter  
But you think you think you dont want him  
  
You got me standing underneath your window  
While youre deliberating on your fate  
And you would really like to let me in though  
But your fiance doesnt know your date  
  
Well if you thinkin life could be much sweeter  
Baby doncha doncha doncha hesitate  
Baby doncha doncha doncha hesitate  
  
Well we could leave tonight for Puerto Rico  
Or we could catch a train to FLA  
Cause with your wedding day around the corner  
I get to thinking that you shouldnt wait  
  
You know that once the ring is on your finger  
Its so much harder for a girl today  
She wont be cozy with a rock n roll singer  
And throw her family and her husband away  
  
Well if you thinkin life could be much sweeter  
Baby doncha doncha doncha hesitate  
Baby doncha doncha doncha hesitate  
  
I just cant wait  
  
Well if you thinkin life could be much sweeter  
Baby doncha doncha doncha hesitate  
Baby doncha doncha doncha hesitate  
  
Baby doncha doncha doncha hesitate  
Baby doncha doncha doncha hesitate  
Baby doncha doncha doncha hesitate  
Baby doncha doncha doncha hesitate  
Baby doncha doncha doncha hesitate
