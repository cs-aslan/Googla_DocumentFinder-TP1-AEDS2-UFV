Stretching out your tightness  
Good enough to make you grow  
  
We are all in favour of this motion  
  
Stretching out your tightness  
Time to open up your whole  
  
When it rains I let myself get wet  
I have always wanted to  
Give something to my brother  
  
Proposing to expose your head  
To something that is like no other  
  
Hit it  
  
Ill stretch you out  
Ill stretch you out my friend  
Ill stretch you out  
  
The the twostep goes from intuition is my liquid fare  
  
We are all in favor of the open air  
  
Three pounds of love and knowledge are expanding in my skull  
Truth be told we let the good times roll  
  
I have always needed to  
Receive it and believe it  
And its moaning and creating love  
  
Tender titilations  
  
Ill stretch you out  
  
Ill stretch you out my friend  
Ill stretch you out  
Im a fish and I can swim all day  
I can swim in so many ways  
Make it up as I go along  
That way it is never wrong  
  
Im a bird and I can fly away  
I can shift in so many shapes  
Make it up as I go along  
That way it is never wrong  
  
Ow  
  
Theres a glowing up around the moon its showing  
We want to play in the water that is flowing  
Very legendary instraplanetary fairy  
  
Varied truths  
Shes making just for you  
  
Yes I have always wanted to  
Give something to this stranger  
  
M m m moving to approve the grove  
A mental transformation
