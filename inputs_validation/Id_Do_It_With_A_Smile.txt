When I used to find troubles come my way  
I always wished they wouldnt stay  
But Im not so sure since you came along  
Whether I was right or wrong  
  
If you ask me would I entertain the lions at the zoo  
By singing in beside them just before their lunch was due  
Would I do it Id do more Id do it with a smile  
  
If you ask me would I take a trip to Paris in the spring  
And see the girls and watch the thrills and never do a thing  
Would I do it Id do more Id do it with a smile  
  
Im not a super sort of man there isnt much that I can do but sing  
Yet if you watch me at a fight I could knock Joe Louis out the ring  
If you ask me to be hypnotized and go into a trance  
Or even pay my income tax just ten years in advance  
Would I do it Id do more ya maam Id do it with a smile  
  
When were all alone noone near to see  
Foolish thoughts occur to me  
Maybe you can guess what theyre all about  
So Ill let the secret out  
If you ask me would I settle down and build a little home  
Carve the ham and push the pram and never never roam  
Would you do it Id do more Id do it with a smile  
  
If you ask me could your mother stay and all your maiden aunts  
Or suggest I take my trousers off so you could wear the pants  
Would I do it Id do more Id do it with a smile  
I dont know much about romance  
That is something Ive been frightened of  
Yet someone taught me how to dance  
So maybe you can teach me how to love  
If you ask me would I sew for you or knit some baby clothes  
Or take the babys nappy off and wipe his little nose  
Would I do it Id do more Id do it with a smile
