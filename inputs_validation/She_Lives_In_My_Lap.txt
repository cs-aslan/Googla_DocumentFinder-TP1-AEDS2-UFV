Whats wrong What are you afraid of  
The Love Below  
  
She stays alone never sheds a single tear  
She stays in the coolest moods clearly woman of the year  
She and all her girlfriends they go out dressed to win  
She comes back to the cooler side of town  
but she lives in my lap  
  
Chorus  
She lives in my lap Repeat x6  
Forever my fiance  
She lives in my lap  
Dont need no chain  
She lives in my lap  
Ill get the courage one day  
  
Make me want you make me miss you  
make me wonder where you are then forget you  
Girl remind me just who we are  
Were oh so close but yet so far  
  
Baby why are you acting like this  
I dont care about any of them  
I care about you  
Baby I Love you  
  
Youve got me open wide I love you  
Just Come inside baby  
Its yours its yours  
Im yours Im yours  
For sure for sure  
Play baby play  
  
Chorus Repeats
