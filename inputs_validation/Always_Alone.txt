Always alone alone and blue Ive got no one to tell my troubles to  
No one to care to call my own it seems that I must always be alone  
  
The day you left you broke my heart I need you so but were so far apart  
You didnt care I should have known that you would go and leave me all alone  
  
There is no one to take your place each night in dreams I see your smiling
face  
Then I awake and find you gone I know that I must always be alone
