Come on my friends  
Lets make for the hills  
They say theres gold but Im looking for thrills  
You can get your hands on whatever we find  
Because Im only coming along for the ride  
  
Well you go your way  
Ill go mine  
I dont care if we get there on time  
Everybodys searching for something they say  
Ill get my kicks on the way  
Over the mountains across the seas  
Who knows what will be waiting for me  
I could sail forever to strange sounding names  
Faces of people and places dont change  
  
All I have to do is just close my eyes  
To see the seagulls wheeling on those far distant skies  
All I want to tell you all I want to say  
Is count me in on the journey  
Dont expect me to stay
