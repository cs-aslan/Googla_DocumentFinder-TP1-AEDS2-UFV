Earnestly I sought You lovingly You found me  
Embraced me as Your child now Ill never be the same

Now all that is within me will rise to glorify  
Singing Hallelujah Hallelujah to my awesome God  
Lift my voice unto my closest friend Ill praise You to the end  
Singing Hallelujah Hallelujah to the faithful one  
Raise my hands in honor of You Lord Ill praise forevermore
