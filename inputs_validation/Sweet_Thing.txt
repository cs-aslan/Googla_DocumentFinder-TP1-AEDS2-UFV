Id be out runnin most every night  
Wed always wind up in one hell of a fight  
The end is comin there aint no doubt  
But theres just that one thing I cant live without  
  
I wont try to stop you  
I cant change your mind  
Its been nice to know you  
Could you leave that sweet thing behind  
  
You take the dishes the silverware  
Well Ill keep the hound dog and this easy chair  
Keep the Ranchero but that TV is mine  
She said You can stick that clicker where the sun dont shine  
  
I know youre leaving  
I cant change your mind  
Its been nice to know you  
Could you leave that sweet thing behind  
  
Well that woman was real mean  
My trailer park drama queen  
Im gonna have bad dreams  
About missing that sweet thing  
Oh Lord I dont know what I am gonna do  
  
Whys a tornado like a redneck divorce  
Either way somebodys bound to lose a mobile home of course  
Well thats my story its sad but true  
Ive only got one request of you  
  
I know youre leaving  
I cant change your mind  
Its been nice to know you  
Could you leave that sweet thing behind  
  
Well I know youre leaving baby  
I cant change your mind  
Its been nice to know you  
Could you leave that sweet thing behind
