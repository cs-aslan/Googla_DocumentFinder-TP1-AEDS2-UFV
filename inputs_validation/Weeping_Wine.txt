If every lover that youd ever known  
Could turn around would you take one  
Or would you really rather be alone  
And full of wrath and when you might please  
Well I dont know babe if you ever have been told  
But youre a tough one to play for  
I tried to be what you were looking for  
Now Im not sure if you ever really knew  
  
You know the world wont wait babe youre crying too late  
And youre drinking on borrowed time  
And the last thing you need is me and my weeping wine  
I guess that the last thing you need is me and my weeping wine  
  
You sit around sticking pins in dolls  
Whats there to fall down and die for  
Youre looking fine baby its well known  
Why does your story have to be so short  
Well pretty soon babe youre gonna show your age  
Cause youre drinking on borrowed time  
And then the last thing you need is me and my weeping wine  
I guess the last thing you need is me and my weeping wine  
  
You know the world wont wait babe youre crying too late  
Youre drinking on borrowed time  
And the last thing you need is me and my weeping wine  
Yeah I guess that the last thing you need is me and my weeping wine  
Me and my weeping wine  
Me any my weeping wine
