I was born by the river  
So I know where the river runs dry  
I couldnt last forever  
  
Accused just for living  
But I know that the living was right  
I couldnt last forever  
Look at me making movies  
Making living like Ive never lived before  
  
And the people wanting out of the river  
Like a poor boy really should  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What you do for me Ill do for you Yeah  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What is blue for me is blue for you  
  
Theres a man who I know  
You know hes got a fist full of dirty dollars  
And I know they wont last forever  
Does he really know what people are saying  
Always feeling sure what he is there saying  
But the others disappear he was alone  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What you do for me Ill do for you  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What is blue for me is blue for you  
  
I go back to the river  
Cause I know where the river runs dry  
I couldnt last forever  
Take the night making movies  
Like a villain never ever seen the night of day  
Dont you know that I cant last forever  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What you do for me Ill do for you  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What is blue for me is blue for you  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What is blue for me is kind of blue for you Yeah
