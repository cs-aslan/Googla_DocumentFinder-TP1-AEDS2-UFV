Take me only for what I am  
Youve got a right to speak your mind  
Youve gotta take a stand  
No one has the right to say  
This is right or that is wrong  
It isnt just one way  
Find common ground  
Go in between  
Things arent always what they seem  
Someday itll be alright  
Changes happen overnight  
People lets give each other room  
If were gonna work it out  
We better make it soon  
Love is love is such a common word  
When its pride we mistake for love  
Isnt that absurd  
Why always take  
The upper hand  
Its better to understand  
Someday itll be alright  
Changes happen overnight  
Someday itll be alright  
Changes happen overnight  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
I believe in love but with no conditions  
Oye mi canto  
And giving in sometimes  
Doesnt make it submission  
Oye mi canto  
Hate is so common its almost tradition  
Oye mi canto  
Come on lets leave it behind  
And make that transition  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto  
Oye mi canto
