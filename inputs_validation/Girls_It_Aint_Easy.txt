Yeah it aint easy  
Girls it aint easy  
To keep the man you love satisfied  
It aint easy  
Girls it aint easy  
To keep the one you love by your side  
  
A womans work is never done  
Never stops it goes on and on  
You work your fingers to the bone  
You gotta be home every time he phones  
  
Sometimes the going gets a little tough  
Seems like my best aint good enough  
Keeps you losing sleep  
Seven days a week yeah  
  
It aint easy  
Girls it aint easy  
To keep the man you love satisfied  
It aint easy  
Girls it aint easy  
To keep the one you love by your side  
  
To keep him happy  
You must sacrifice  
Be ready and willing  
To spend lonely nights  
Do what you can  
Though he seems ungrateful  
Love him so true  
Even though he seems unfaithful  
  
But when his hope is gone  
And life gets him down  
Thats when hell say  
He needs you around  
  
Hard to live with him  
Hard to live without him  
It aint easy no  
  
Oh yeah it aint easy  
Girls it aint easy  
It aint easy  
Girls it aint easy  
  
You got to favor him with understanding  
When understanding is what he needs  
We try hard to give them respect  
All that we get is their regret  
  
But when theyre in trouble  
They need our love and care  
No matter when we gotta be right there  
In between the crying  
Gotta keep trying  
  
It aint easy  
Girls it aint easy ooh ooh ooh  
It aint easy  
Girls it aint easy  
  
It aint easy  
Girls it aint easy yeah ooh  
It aint easy  
Girls it aint easy no
