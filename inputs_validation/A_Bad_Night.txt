Baby youre cool  
And even though youve never been to school  
I know youre fine  
But then you change your mind  
Then you start on driftin  
And fall on behind  
  
Youve been my girl  
Youve been mine  
All of the time  
  
A bad night  
Its gonna be  
A bad night  
I guarantee  
Tonight Ill have  
A bad night  
I know I shall  
  
Ah cause you left me waiting in the corner  
And I know youre never gonna come back for me  
And though you said you loved me  
And said you needed all of my love  
A bad bad bad bad bad night  
Its gonna be  
  
A bad night  
Its gonna be  
A bad night  
I guarantee  
Tonight Ill have  
A bad night  
I know I shall  
  
Maybe if the weather was just a little better  
It might not have happened that way  
But the situation was gettin pretty bad bad  
A bad bad bad bad bad night its gonna be  
  
A bad night  
Its gonna be  
A bad night  
I guarantee  
Tonight Ill have  
A bad night  
I know I shall  
I know I shall
