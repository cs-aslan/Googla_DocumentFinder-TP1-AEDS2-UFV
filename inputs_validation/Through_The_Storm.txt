The storms of life will blow  
Theyre sure to come and go  
They meet me at a time when Im calm and doing fine  
But the captain of my soul hes always on board  
He rocks me in his arms  
While riding through the storm  
  
While riding through the storm  
Jesus holds me in his arms  
I am not afraid of the stormy winds and the rains  
Though clouds become high  
He holds me while I ride  
I found safety in his arms  
While riding through the storm  
  
I have no fear of the raging sea  
Knowing Jesus is there with me  
He can speak to the winds and the waves  
And make them behave  
All powers in his hand  
On sea or dry land  
I found safety in the masters arms  
While riding through the storm  
  
While Im riding through the storm  
Jesus holds me in his arms  
No Im not afraid of the stormy winds and the rains  
Though the tide becomes high  
He holds me while I ride  
I found safety in the masters arms  
While riding through the storm  
  
While riding through the storm  
While riding through the storm  
Yeah while Im riding through the storm  
Jesus holds me in arms while Im riding through the storm  
Let the winds blow I dont care Im riding through the storm  
Let the rains fall down Im riding through the storm with Jesus  
Jesus is the captain of my soul yes yeyeyes  
He is the captain of my soul
