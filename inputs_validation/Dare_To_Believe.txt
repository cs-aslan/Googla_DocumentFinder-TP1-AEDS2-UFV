Dare To Believe  
Words by Ray Boltz Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Youre standing at a mountain  
That you know you cannot climb  
Your enemys approaching  
You hear him coming from behind  
There is trouble all around you  
Theres no place to run away  
But theres a voice  
Thats deep inside you  
Saying its time to stand in faith  
Chorus  
I dare to believe  
That miracles happen  
That mountains still move  
And demons must flee  
For the God that we serve  
He is much more than able  
So dont be afraid  
Stand up and say  
I dare to believe  
Theres a miracle inside you  
Its just a mustard seed of faith  
But by the mighty hand of God now  
You know that tiny seed was placed  
And though this world  
May try to crush you  
It can never keep you down  
Soon the life of God inside you  
Will come breaking through the ground  
Chorus  
No matter what the doubters tell you  
No matter what the devil says  
No matter what anybody  
Anybody else does  
You just keep trusting Jesus  
Youll see and wont be long  
God is right and the doubters are wrong  
Just say  
Chorus 2X  
No dont be afraid  
Just stand up and say  
I dare to believe  
No dont be afraid  
Just stand up and say  
I dare to believe
