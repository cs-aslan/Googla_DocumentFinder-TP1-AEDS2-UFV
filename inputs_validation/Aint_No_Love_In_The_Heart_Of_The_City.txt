Aint no love in the heart of the city  
Aint no love in the heart of town  
Aint no love sure nuff is a pity  
Aint no love cause you aint around  
Baby since you been around  
  
Aint no love in the heart of the city  
Aint no love in the heart of town  
Aint no love sure nuff is a pity child  
Aint no love cause you aint around  
  
Every place that I go  
Well it seems so strange  
Without you love baby baby  
Things have changed  
Now that youre gone  
Why know the sun dont shine  
From the city hall  
To the county line thats why  
  
Aint no love in the heart of the city  
Aint no love in the heart of town  
Aint no love sure nuff is a pity  
Aint no love cause you aint around  
  
Every place that I go  
Well it seems so strange  
Without you love baby baby  
Things have changed  
Now that youre gone  
Why know the sun dont shine  
From the city hall  
Woman to the county line thats why  
  
Aint no love in the heart of the city  
There aint no love in the heart of town  
There aint no love sure nuff is a pity  
Aint no love cause you aint around  
  
There aint no love in the heart of the city  
There aint no love in the heart of town  
Aint no love sure nuff is a pity  
Aint no love cause you aint around  
Cause you aint around
