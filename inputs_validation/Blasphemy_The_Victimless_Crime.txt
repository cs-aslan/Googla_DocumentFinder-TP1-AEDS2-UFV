Ill throw a pie in the face of piety  
Ill torch a torah right off a bridge  
I am a reverend of irreverence  
Im a shill for any sacrilege  
I understand that faith in a deity  
Helps the masses who are having hard times  
But blasphemy like prostitution  
Are clearly victimless crimes  
Blasphemy blaspheyou Jesus Christ the blackest Jew  
  
Blaspheyou blasphemy poisonous pedagogy  
Im an unbeliever Im a heretic  
Im gonna projectile puke off a pew  
Im a trouble making immature imp  
Im gonna turn your other cheek for you  
I understand we all need something to believe in  
I believe Ill never be given wings and  
Im sorry if its up there cuz I didnt think  
A song was gonna hurt its feelings  
Blasphemy speaking deadpan  
Apparently this god has got a master plan  
Now they call foul pure heresy  
But ya gotta wonder does he have a plan B  
  
Horus similar to Mithra Attis analogous to Krishna  
Jesus different name same story  
All based on ancient Egyptian allegory  
My position hasnt been occulted  
It can never be more overstated  
My intelligence has been insulted  
So my tongue lashes out in defense  
Anything that is your holy or sacred  
Im gonna desecrate and use in jest  
But youll never hear a crack about Mohammad  
  
Cause I dont wanna get shot in the chest  
Blasphemy isnt this fun  
Rob a rabbi bugger a nun  
Blasphemy want some more  
Mother Mary the virgin whore
