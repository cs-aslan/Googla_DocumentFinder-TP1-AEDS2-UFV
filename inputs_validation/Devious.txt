I remember one girl  
Saw her again in a magazine  
Front cover big star  
Showing things that Id never seen  
Well maybe  
Can you feel it Can you  
I remember one girl  
Whod believe shed be so devious  
Bad decision bad move  
She told the papers everything  
Well maybe  
Do you need it do you  
Do you want it do you  
Come and get it  
I remember one girl  
Shed only make friends in expensive cars  
Television good wine  
Leather seats and a friend of mine  
Well maybe  
Somethings coming  
Oh no
