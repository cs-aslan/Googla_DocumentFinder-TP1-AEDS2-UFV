There were days when each hour was a war I fought to survive  
There were nights full of nightmares and I dreaded closing my eyes  
There were skies that burst open with a downpour to drown me alive  
But the world took a spark like a match in the dark and the fire brought me to
life  
So Im fanning the flames to climb so high cause theres no other way we can
stay alive  
  
Cause were burning bright as we all unite  
And when its all said and done well shine like the sun so dont let the fire
die  
And well watch the sky as it fills with light  
And though the embers are new whatever you do just dont let the fire die  
  
And youll find therell be mornings when the ashes and embers are cold  
But youll fight with a passion and youll never stop cause you know  
Yeah you know it gets better and your story is yet to be told  
Every push every shove every war every love  
Yeah the coals are beginning to glow  
So Im fanning the flames to climb so high cause theres no other way we can
stay alive  
  
Cause were burning bright as we all unite  
And when its all said and done well shine like the sun so dont let the fire
die  
And well watch the sky as it fills with light  
And though the embers are new whatever you do just dont let the fire die  
  
Dont let the fire die  
It gets better  
Just dont let the fire die no  
  
Cause were burning bright as we all unite  
And when its all said and done well shine like the sun so dont let the fire
die  
And well watch the sky as it fills with light  
And though the embers are new whatever you do just dont let the fire die  
  
And though the embers are new whatever you do just dont let the fire die  
Dont let the fire die
