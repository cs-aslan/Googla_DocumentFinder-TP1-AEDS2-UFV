All change on then merry go line  
Everybody looking for a sign  
Jumping up and down when the switch goes on  
Nobody knows where its coming from  
  
Im here watching keeping well away  
Oh Im gonna live it in my own way  
Singing no mister not me  
Im staying here with guys on free  
In deep water  
  
I see a captain on a distant shore  
Hes got a dream he wants to make it law  
Hes got my number hes got a plan  
He try to get you any way he can  
Wants to own everything he sees  
While Im here well he aint with me  
Singing no mister no way  
I got my own deep water  
Deep deep water
