Been wrong all along  
Ive been wrong all along  
You never hit me more than lightenin  
I cant understand it myself  
I guess I was wrong  
Now that youre gone  
I have to get it on with somebody else  
Ive been wrong all along  
Ive been wrong all along  
  
Like a death at the partys alright  
Its hard to survive on a Saturday night  
Ive been wrong all along  
Ive been wrong all along  
  
So youre feelin alright now  
Im not feelin too good  
You put me on ice  
You better think twice  
Takin it out on a Saturday night  
Ive been wrong all along  
Ive been wrong all along  
  
Like a death at the partys alright  
You ruin my fun on a Saturday night  
Ive been wrong all along  
Ive been wrong all along  
  
Heavens fallin  
I keep callin  
You keep stallin  
Youre more than lucky if you get out alive  
  
Ive been wrong all along  
Ive been wrong all along  
Like a death at the partys alright  
Its hard to survive on a Saturday night  
Ive been wrong all along  
Ive been wrong all along  
  
Well its Saturday night  
Its hard to survive  
Im gettin it on with my baby tonight  
Its hard to tell  
Its all in your mind  
Seems to be all my life its really gone to hell
