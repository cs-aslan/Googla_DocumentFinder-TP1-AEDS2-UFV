A hundred years ago  
I thought happiness was ice cream and football  
But time went by so fast  
Till I couldnt see their attractions at all  
I looked around for other pleasures  
The old man had shown the way then  
Just in time I found women and wine  
  
I marvelled at the way that they united men  
For the working and middle and upper classes  
You didnt need any brains  
Just a taste for booze and a eye for lassies  
Im not basking in reflected glory  
But open any book and I think youll find that  
The greatest men of all time  
Loved women and wine  
Or men and wine  
  
Ah theyll be the death of you  
If something else doesnt get you first  
  
Well Im older now  
And have to take my pleasures in moderation  
Least thats what it says here in this guide to  
Declining years in declining nations  
But just cause Ive slowed up a bit  
Doesnt mean I cant cheer from the touchline  
I hope sons of mine  
Spend lots of time  
On women and wine  
Women and wine
