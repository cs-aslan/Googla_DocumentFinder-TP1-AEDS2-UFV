Waiting for the moment when the moment has been waiting all the time  
Staring at the golden heights wondering are you ready for the climb  
  
Are you ready for this If youre ready to believe it treasure youll find  
Are you ready for that  
Are you ready for this Dont mistake the chance focus your eyes  
Will you take the chance When youre ready to receive it fears left behind  
Well youve got the time  
  
A new perspective a new state of mind  
  
Always on the edge of what could be the greatest moment in this life  
Watching as the theme builds left only to wonder in delight  
  
Youve got to let it go Youve got to let yourself believe in all that can be  
Youve got to let it go  
Wanting to feel Wanting to feel just what it means to be free  
Theres no reason for deceiving Theres no reason for deceiving focus your
eyes  
  
To a new perspective a new state of mind  
  
Sometimes you feel you want to run away from it all  
Sometimes you hear the voices of the past come to call  
But theres no giving up when you are giving it all  
  
Hoping forgiving and loving the qualities of life  
Designing the future were building the dreams taking flight  
  
Are you ready for love  
Are you ready for love  
Are you ready for love  
  
A new state of mind  
  
Waiting for the moment when the moment has been waiting all the time  
Reaching for the golden heights without a doubt youre ready for the climb  
  
Youve got to set it out Youve got to set yourself believing and fortunes

Youve got to set it out  
No escaping No escaping once youve made up your mind  
Theres a reason for your being Theres a reason for your being focus your
eyes
