After laughter comes tears  
  
Yo check yo yo check the script  
Me and the gods get it ripped  
Blunts in the dip forty dogs in my lip  
Had a box Boom Boom the bass will blast  
We was laughing at all the girls that passed  
Conversation brothers had begin to discuss  
Hey yo Ra remember that kid ya bust  
Aw yeah he ran but he didnt get far  
Cause I dropped him heh heh heh heh heh ha  
Not knowin exactly what lied ahead  
My little brother my mother sent him out for bread  
Get the Wonder its a hot day in the summer  
Didnt expect to come across a crazy gunner  
Hey Shorty check it for the bag and the dough  
But he was brave looked him in the eye and said No  
Money splattered him BOW then he snatched the bag  
In his pockets then he jetted up the Ave  
Girls screamin the noise up and down the block  
Hey Rakeem What Your little brother got shot  
I ran frantically then I dropped down to his feet  
I saw the blood all over the hot concrete  
I picked him up then I held him by his head  
His eyes shut thats when I knew he was  
Aw man How do I say goodbye  
Its always the good ones who have to die  
Memories in the corner of my mind  
Flashbacks I was laughin all the time  
I taught him all about the bees and birds  
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words  
  
After laughter comes tears  
  
Me and my man my ace big Moe from the shelter  
Bout to hit the skins from this girl named Thelma  
Now Thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck  
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect  
We was stimmy you know how it is when youre blitzed  
Three oclock in the morning something gots to give  
Moe said hell go first I said Ill take next  
Here take this raincoat and practice safe sex  
He seemed to ignore I said be for real  
Shes not even worth it to go raw deal  
A mans gonna do what a mans gonna do  
He got buttnaked and stuck the power you  
Twenty minutes went by my man went out without a doubt  
Im not pumpin up I am airin you  
Hey yo he came out laughing with glory  
Im surprised hes still livin to tell his story  
But he carried on with the same old stuff  
with Stephanie like a whammy he pressed his luck  
Both tried to be down with OPP  
Aint nothin wrong but he got caught with the HIV now  
No life to live doc says two more years  
So after the laughter I guess comes the tears  
  
After laughter comes tears  
After laughter comes tears
