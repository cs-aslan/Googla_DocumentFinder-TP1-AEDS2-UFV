Heyhey now cant you see  
Thats life  
Take a look around you now  
Some days you shine  
Some days it all unwinds  
  
Flyhigh above your fears  
Be sure  
Never let them rain on you  
And should they fall  
Then after all  
  
Chorus  
Whatever gets you through  
It takes  
Whatever gets you through  
Believe  
Whatever gets you through  
Your life  
  
Im so tired of always finding my world so bare  
Look around you now  
Life isnt always fair  
Whatever gets you through  
Will get you there Repeat  
  
Chorus X2
