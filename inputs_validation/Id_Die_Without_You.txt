Id sacrifice whatevers left of me  
Been livin lies then you set me free  
Youve given more than I ever had  
I give to you all over again  
  
Weve grown so strong  
Over and over again  
Though things have gone wrong  
My love  
  
There is no higher love than we have  
You know Id die without you  
There are no lies we left them behind  
Id surely die without you  
  
Ive never tried tried this hard  
Ive never cried never gone so far  
Even the Gods cant set us apart  
Its engraved deep in our hearts  
  
Weve grown so strong  
Over and over again  
Though things have gone wrong  
My love  
  
There is no higher love than we have  
You know Id die without you  
There are no lies we left them behind  
Id surely die without you
