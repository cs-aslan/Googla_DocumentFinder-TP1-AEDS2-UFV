I think I have everything I need  
It got dark but now I think I see  
The world around is full of arms still reaching out to me  
I hear the notes and belt them back to you  
I feel loved  
Im burning like a fuse  
Im not afraid  
Cause I know Ive got nothing left to lose  
  
I just want to say  
I know I let you down but Im letting out  
And I found a way that I can tell the truth make it up to you  
  
I know that I have always walked the line  
In between of confidence and lies  
So many scenes are full of words I wish I could rewind  
  
But here you are forgiving me again  
Youll never know how real to me youve been  
This is the start of another empty page where I begin  
  
I just want to say  
I know I let you down but Im letting out  
And I found a way that I can tell the truth make it up to you  
  
I left home but theres one thing I still know  
Its always summer in my heart and in my soul  
  
I loved you first I love you still  
I always will  
  
I loved you first I love you still  
I always will  
  
I just want to say  
I know I let you down but Im letting out  
And I found a way that I can tell the truth make it up to you  
  
I left home but theres one thing that I still know  
Its always summer in my heart and in my soul  
Its always summer in my heart and in my soul  
Its always summer in my heart and in my soul
