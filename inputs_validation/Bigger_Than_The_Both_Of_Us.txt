The moons smiling over my shoulder  
I know these same stars will shine when Im older  
So Im keeping heaven on my mind  
Cause a good love is so hard to find  
  
Chorus  
And its bigger than the both of us  
Deeper than the sea  
Tossing on the water riding destiny  
Bigger than the both of us  
Farther than the eye can see  
Were dancing our souls are dancing  
Infinity  
  
You know theres a million ways to fail  
But I know this isnt just a fairy tale  
Its a one in million paradise  
And I know love is the light in your eyes  
  
Chorus  
  
Bigger than the both of us  
Our souls are dancing  
Bigger than the both of us  
Our souls are dancing
