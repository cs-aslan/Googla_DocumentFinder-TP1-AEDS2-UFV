Yeah ay ay  
  
He said Darling dont forget  
There is sweetness left on earth for you and me  
He says Honey no regrets  
We just do our best and die  
I just wanna cry cause youll be  
  
Be good to me be good to me  
I need you now more than ever oh ooooh  
Im faithful me and when youre down  
Ill be around Ill be your every weather  
  
He says this is just today  
It will be okay and I I am listening  
He says you can trust in me  
Youll get all youll need and how can I doubt you  
Cause youll be  
  
Be good to me be good to me

You know what you do to me  
You light up  
Light up the dark and  
Youre all the good within me  
My heart is filled rebuilt
