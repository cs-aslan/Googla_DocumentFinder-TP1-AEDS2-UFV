Im getting bored  
Being part of mankind  
Theres not a lot to do no more  
This race is a waste of time  
  
People rushing everywhere  
Swarming around like flies  
Think Ill buy a forty four  
Give them all a surprise  
  
Think Im gonna kill myself  
Cause a little suicide  
Stick around for a couple of days  
What a scandal if I died  
  
Yeah Im gonna kill myself  
Get a little headline news  
Id like to see what the papers say  
On the state of teenage blues  
  
A rift in my family  
I cant use the car  
I gotta be in by ten oclock  
Who do they think they are  
  
Id make an exception  
If you want to save my life  
Brigitte Bardot gotta come  
And see me every night
