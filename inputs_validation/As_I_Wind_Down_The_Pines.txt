As I wind down the pines  
Its the lines on your face  
Playing on your face  
  
Without thinking so much  
As abandoning thought  
I went through open country  
Over water meadows streams  
  
Lakes and wires and roosts in reeds  
To a nest in the hole of  
This dead  
Tree  
  
To play without stopping or pause  
Not for silence not for applause  
Not without thinking  
And thinkings abandoning thought  
  
As I wind down the pines  
Its the lines on your face  
Playing on your face
