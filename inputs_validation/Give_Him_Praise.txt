Chorus  
Weve come to give Him glory  
And lift Him up  
Weve come to give Him praise for  
All thats Hes done  
Give Him the praise Give Him the praise  
Give Him the praise Give Him the praise  
Give Him the praise  
  
Verse 1  
Now Paul and Silas  
Had no place to go  
Shackles on their feet  
It seemed they had no hope  
But they began to sing their praise  
To the One who holds the key  
By the time their praises reached the throne  
They were dancin free singin  
  
Verse 2  
You may be captive  
In a pool of doubt and fears  
Trying to find the answer  
To the trial youve had for years  
Just begin to sing your praise  
To the One who holds the key  
By the time your praises reach the throne  
You will have the victory  
  
Bridge  
Praise Him repeat  
Give Him the praise Give Him the praise  
Give Him the praise Give Him the praise  
Praise Him
