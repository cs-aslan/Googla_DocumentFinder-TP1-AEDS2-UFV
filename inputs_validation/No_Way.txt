Heres a token of my openness  
Of my need to not disappear  
How Im feeling so revealing to me  
I found my mind too clear  
I just need someone to be there for me  
I just want someone to be there for me  
  
All the static in my attic a  
Shoots down my side nerve  
To the ocean of my platitudes  
Longitudes latitudes its so absurd  
I just need someone to be there for  
I just want someone to be there for  
Someone to be there for  
  
Cause Ill stop trying to make a difference  
Im not trying to make a difference  
Ill stop trying to make a difference  
  
No way  
  
Ooh lets call in an angel  
  
Cause Ill stop trying to make a difference  
Im not trying to make a difference  
Ill stop trying to make a difference  
  
No way  
  
Cause Ill stop trying to make a difference  
Im not trying to make a difference  
Im not trying to make a difference  
No way  
No way no way  
Lets call in an angel  
Whos calling an angel
