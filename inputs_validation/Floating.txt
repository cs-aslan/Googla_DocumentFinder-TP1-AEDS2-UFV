Floating free as a bird  
Sixty foot leaps its so absurd  
From up here you should see the view  
Such a lot of space for me and you  
  
Oh youd like it  
Gliding around get your feet off the ground  
Oh youd like it  
Do as you please with so much ease  
  
Now I know how it feels  
To have wings on my heels  
To take a stroll among the stars  
Get a close look at planet Mars  
  
Oh youd like it  
Gliding around get your feet off the ground  
Oh youd like it  
Do as you please with so much ease  
  
Bouncing about on the moon  
Guess youll all be up here soon  
The candy stores theyll be brand new  
And youll buy a rock with the moon right through  
  
Oh youd like it  
Gliding around get your feet off the ground  
Oh youd like it  
Do as you please with so much ease  
  
Come fly  
Come fly  
Come fly
