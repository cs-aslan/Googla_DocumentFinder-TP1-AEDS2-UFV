My message this evenin  
Is simple indeed  
Wherever you wander  
Whatever your breed  
Theres just one thing baby  
That comes from above  
When push comes to shove  
Thank God for self love  
  
Thank Him Thank Him  
God for self love  
Thank Him Thank Him  
God for self love  
When push comes to shove  
Thank God for self love  
  
When livin gets heavy  
And hope starts to fade  
You just cant continue  
That old masquerade  
Remember the power that comes from above  
When push comes to shove  
Thank God for self love  
  
Thank Him Thank Him  
God for self love  
Thank Him Thank Him  
God for self love  
When push comes to shove  
Thank God for self love
