  
Before you take another step theres one thing you should know  
About the years ahead and how theyll be  
Youll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow  
Cause all I have to offer you is me  
  
Therell be no mansion waiting on the hill with crystal chandeliers  
And therell be no fancy clothes for you to wear  
Everything I have is standing here in front of you to see  
All I have to offer you is me  
  
Sweetheart Ill give you all my love in every way I can  
But be sure thats what you want while youre still free  
The only gold I have for you is in this wedding band  
Cause all I have to offer you is me  
  
Therell be no mansion waiting on the hill  
All I have to offer you is me
