Youre nobody til somebody loves you  
Youre nobody til somebody cares  
You may be king you may possess the world and its gold  
But gold wont bring you happiness when youre growing old  
  
The world still is the same youll never change it  
As sure as the star shines above  
Youre nobody til somebody loves you  
So find yourself somebody to love  
  
The world still is the same youll never change it  
As sure as the star shines above  
Youre nobody til somebody loves you  
So find yourself somebody to love  
So find yourself somebody to love
