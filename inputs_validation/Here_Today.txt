And if I said  
I really knew you well what would your answer be  
If you were here today  
  
Ooh ooh ooh here today  
  
Well knowing you  
Youd probably laugh and say that we were worlds apart  
If you were here today  
  
Ooh ooh ooh here today  
  
But as for me  
I still remember how it was before  
And I am holding back these tears no more  
  
Ooh ooh ooh I love you ooh  
  
What about the time we met  
Well I suppose that you could say that we were playing hard to get  
Didnt understand a thing  
But we could always sing  
  
What about the night we cried  
Because there wasnt any reason left to keep it all inside  
Never understood a word  
But you were always there  with a smile  
  
And if I say  
I really loved you and was glad you came along  
If you were here today  
  
Ooh ooh ooh for you were in my song  
  
Ooh ooh ooh here today
