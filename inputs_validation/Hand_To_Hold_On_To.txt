You can laugh and joke and make fun of your friends  
Spin in the middle when your troubles begin  
Take it nice and easy and always pretend  
That youre coolso coolso cool  
  
Say Imunna hold onto that a while and I will and Ill be tame  
Talk like a jerk on an educated brain  
Be an old girl drivin the young boys insane  
Be a joker a preacherit does not matter  
  
Chorus  
Everyone needs a hand to hold on to  
Everyone needs a hand to hold on to  
Dont need to be no strong hand  
Dont need to be no rich hand  
Everyone just needs a hand to hold on to  
  
Havin good luck with your financial situation  
Play the ponies be the president of the United Nation  
Go to work and be a Hollywood stand  
Drive your four wheel drive right into the mud but  
  
Chorus  
  
And in those hours when youre alone  
And theres nobody there except yourself  
I know ityou want to pick up the phone  
And say Talk to me talk to me somebody please  
Talk to me Yeah  
  
Ohh yeah  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X
