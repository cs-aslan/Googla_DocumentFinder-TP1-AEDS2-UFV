Thanks for the times  
That youve given me  
The memories are all in my mind  
And now that weve come  
To the end of our rainbow  
Theres something  
I must say out loud  
Youre once twice  
Three times a lady  
Yes youre once twice  
Three times a lady  
  
And I love you  
When we are together  
The moments I cherish  
With every beat of my heart  
To touch you to hold you  
To feel you to need you  
Theres nothing to keep us apart  
Youre once twice  
Three times a lady  
And I love you  
I love you
