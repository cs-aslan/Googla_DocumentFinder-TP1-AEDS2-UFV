Since youre not worth my love  
I havent given up  
Im stronger than that  
Im stronger than that  
And though my heart will break  
Im takin back my faith  
Cos right now my world is spinnin too fast  
But you wont be the end of me  
If you were the one you wouldnt hurt me so bad  
You gave me the world  
  
Gave me the world to take it all away  
All you left me was yesterday  
And this space in my heart  
Now its slowly tearin me apart  
Im takin all that I learned from you  
Ill make it something Ill never do  
I cant be who you are  
You taught me how to break a heart  
You taught me how to break a heart  
  
Ill make it through this pain  
My dreams wont call your name  
Im stronger than that  
Im stronger than that  
Cos I still know how to love  
Know that will be enough  
And this moment will fade into the past  
You wont be the end of me  
If you were the one you wouldnt hurt me so bad  
You gave me the world  
  
Gave me the world to take it all away  
All you left me was yesterday  
And this space in my heart  
Now its slowly tearing me apart  
Im takin all that I learned from you  
Ill make it something Ill never do  
I cant be who you are  
You taught me how to break a heart  
You taught me how to break a heart  
  
Im takin all that I learned from you  
Ill make it something Ill never do  
I cant be who you are  
You taught me how to break a heart  
You taught me how to break a heart  
  
Im taking back my faith  
Im taking back my life  
I dont care for who you are  
Cos you taught me how to break a heart  
How to break a heart  
How to break a heart  
Cos you taught me how to break a heart
