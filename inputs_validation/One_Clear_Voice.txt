The whole world is talkin drownin out my voice  
How can I hear myself with all this noise  
But all this confusion just disappears  
When I find a quiet place where I can hear  
  
One clear voice callin out for me to listen  
One clear voice that whispers words of wisdom  
Close my eyes till I find what Ive been missin  
If Im very still I will hear one clear voice  
  
Im always searchin for which path to take  
Sometimes Im so afraid to make mistakes  
From somewhere inside me stronger than my fears  
Just like the sound of music to my ears  
  
One clear voice callin out for me to listen  
One clear voice that whispers words of wisdom  
Close my eyes till I find what Ive been missin  
If Im very still I will hear one clear voice
