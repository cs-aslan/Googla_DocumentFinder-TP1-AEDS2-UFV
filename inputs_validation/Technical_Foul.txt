If youre comin from the street with dirty shoes on your feet  
Thats a technical foul  
If you switch the radio to some  music show  
Thats a technical foul  
  
If you dont shut the door  
After using the frigerator  
Thats a technical foul  
A technical foul  
  
If you touch the thermostat  
Youll get hit with a bat  
Cause thats a technical foul  
You will feel my wrath  
If your hair clogs the drain  
Youll know the meaning of pain  
Cause thats a technical foul  
Ill show you no mercy  
  
Ho this is such bullshitah  
Hey  
In this house we say bull STICK  
Or its a technical foul  
A technical foul  
  
If I dont spray Lysol after moving a bowel  
Thats a technical foul  
If I decide to wash my ass with your monogram towel  
Thats a technical foul  
Please say hiney  
  
If I make fun of your crazy feeties  
Or give sugar cookies to Miss Diabetes  
Thats not really a technical foul  
But possibly a homicide  
  
Can I sleep past three  
If you do youll get a T  
Take a whiz in those flowers  
Ill say hit the showers  
Use this horn as a bong  
Adios Tommy Chong  
Make some long distance calls  
Youll get a kick in the balls  
Oops  
  
Can I walk around with my morning erection  
If you want an automatic ejection  
Cause thats a technical foul  
But Id like to see it anyway  
Just kidding  
  
There are certain rules which apply in ones life  
With your sister friends or imaginary wife  
  
Adam  
I cant believe I havent killed myself  
Here with Wigs McGee and the Furry Elf  
Shes  and hes so small  
How did I get stuck in this shit hole  
Guess Ill have to deal with your demands  
But please dont touch me with your alien hands  
  
Whitey  
 carries over beyond my court  
Whether youre a Jewish guy  or especially short  
I think Ill sing to my   
My imaginary wife is named   
  
Elenore  
They took my wig  
I remember the look in their eyes  
Why oh why  
Wont someone retreive my wig wig wig  
  
I got no right to growl  
Watch out shes on the prowl  
Without my wig I look like an owl  
Hoo hoo  
Oh my God  
  
Dont laugh at her  
Or its a technical foul  
A technical foul  
A technical foul
