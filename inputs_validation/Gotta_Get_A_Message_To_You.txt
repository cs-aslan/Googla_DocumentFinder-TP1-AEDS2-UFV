The preacher talked with me and he smiled  
Said Come and walk with me  
Come and walk one more mile  
Now for once in your life youre alone  
But you aint got a dime  
Theres no time for the phone  
  
Ive just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on hold on  
  
I told him Im in no hurry  
But if I broke her heart  
Then wont you tell her Im sorry  
And for once in my life Im alone  
And Ive gotta let her know  
Just in time before I go  
  
Ive just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on hold on  
  
Well I laughed but that didnt work  
And its only her love  
That keeps me wearing this dirt  
Now Im crying but deep down inside  
Well I did it to him  
Now its my turn to die  
  
Ive just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on hold on  
  
Ive just gotta get a message to you  
Hold on hold on  
One more hour and my life will be through  
Hold on hold on
