Never give an inch  thats what I say son  
When its too tough for everybody else  
Hell its just right for me  
Now my lips are bleeding  
From the selfish things that Ive done  
And my heart it lies at the bottom of the ocean  
Sometimes a great notion  
  
Wanted to make love to my girl  
In the backseat of my car  
So I took her to the drivein picture show  
So I filled her up with  
Lies and a strong love potion  
And Im sittin here watching the movie alone  
Sometimes a great notion  
  
Sometimes the best plans  
Have been known to go astray  
So you better put your seatbelt on  
Just like your worst headache  
Well a bad day dont go away  
And you hit the ground running against your emotions  
Sometimes a great notion  
Sometimes a great notion
