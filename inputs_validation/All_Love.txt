When I push the sheets away from your face  
And watch you sleep all day here  
And when I push you away  
And say you simply cannot stay here  
  
And its all love all love  
Its all love my stupid love  
  
When I say you take away  
The most important parts of me with you  
When Ive had the greyest day  
You add more grey its just your way  
Its true  
  
But its all love all love ohh  
Its all love all love ohh  
Its all love all love ohh  
Its all love my stupid love  
  
You cant be the one to kill the pain anymore  
You let me in but then you slam my fingers in the door  
Ive had enough but I keep asking you to give me more  
  
When I say  
That theres no way  
  
Its all love all love ohh  
Its all love all love ohh  
Its all love all love ohh  
Its all love my stupid love  
  
Its all love all love  
Its all love its all love  
Its all love all love  
Its all love its all love  
Its all love all love  
Its all love its all love  
Its all love my stupid love
