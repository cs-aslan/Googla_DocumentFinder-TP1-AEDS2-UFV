Round about midnight  
I feel the chill closin in  
Living my stage fright  
I need the sun to begin  tomorrow  
  
Thinking bout my life  
And all the changes she made  
And when she went running out  
All the colors fade  to midnight  
  
Chorus  
What a bad week Ive had  
Theres rain on the window  
What a bad week Im sad  
Theres rain on my window  
  
Will I be staying  
Or am I moving in  
Am I still standing  
Ive gotta wait  shes choosing  
  
Chorus  
What a bad week Ive had  
Theres rain on the window  
What a bad week Im sad  
Theres rain on the window  
  
When the sun comes up it dries that rain on the window Repeat x5
