Well honey dont you worry I dont need no bar room queens  
Though Ill admit she sure knows how to fill a pair of jeans  
And Ill admit now darlin shes sure showing me her stuff  
But honey it aint nearly enough  
  
Cause I aint never seen her  
Patch a pair of raged britches  
Stretch a paycheck till it reaches  
Scratch my back right where it itches  
And I aint never seen that and honey till I do  
My heart wont wander very far from you  
  
Now honey you know I honor all the hard times with been through  
I never could have made it with anyone but you  
And I think I know when a ladys really really tough  
And she dont show me nearly enough  
  
Cause I aint never seen her  
Stay up all night with a baby  
Calm me down when I get crazy  
Fix me grits and redeye gravy  
And I aint never seen that and honey till I do  
My heart wont wander very far from you  
  
No I aint never seen her  
Make a six room house a castle  
Teach younguns how to wrestle  
Straighten out my fishin tackle  
I aint never seen that and honey till I do  
My heart wont wander very far from you  
  
No I aint never seen that and honey till I do  
My heart wont wander very far from you
