Gerry Beckley and Bill Mumy  
  
Hey Slim how longs it been  
Five minutes maybe 10  
Cant wait to see you again and again  
First taste of this romance  
Hell baby I almost danced  
Caught myself close to believing  
But every time is a brand new feeling  
Lay me down in cool clear water  
For a moment Ive forgot her  
Still I know where this is leading  
  
Win lose which we choose  
Won once and once refused  
Already burning down the fuse  
Dont wanna be building walls  
Cause everything rising falls  
Its darkness here the lights concealing  
Love it seems is too revealing  
Hidden in some secret place  
Etched in lines around my face  
The ghosts in here are all competing  
Over one more song about love and leaving  
Ummmmm  
  
Down down we all fall down  
Down down we all fall down  
We all fall down yeah we all fall down  
Lets toast to new love blooming  
Its all around and all consuming  
Its a dream youre bound to follow  
Til you find its only hollow  
I can hear the angels grieving  
Over one more song about love and leaving  
Ummmmm
