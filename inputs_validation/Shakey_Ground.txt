Lady luck and the four leaf clover  
Wont be as hurt as I feel all over  
My life for one special occasion  
Til you leave in depth the situation  
  
Well well well standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
Standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
  
My car got repossessed this morning  
Harder times I havent seen in years  
Able to throw me a life preserver  
cause Im about to drown in my own tears  
  
Well well well standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
Standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
  
Well well well standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
  
Standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
Standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
  
Well well well standing on shakey ground  
Shaking shakey ground  
Standing standing  
Standing on shakey ground
