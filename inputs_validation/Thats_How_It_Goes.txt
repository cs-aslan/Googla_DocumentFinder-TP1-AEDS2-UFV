Thats how it goes  
When you feel so sad you feel so low  
Life seems so bad I know I know  
Thats how it goes  
  
Thats how it goes  
You may think its funny  
But it always shows  
Try to hide it honey oh no it shows  
Thats how it goes  
  
Some people say  
Everythings gonna be okay  
Just give it a while  
Youll find youre back  
Back in style  
  
But I dont know life will get better  
I am sure they know  
Sooner or later it shows I know  
Thats how it goes  
  
Its funny to see how easy life can be  
Just sit back and smile  
Youll find that life is worthwhile  
Thats how it goes  
When youre on top the whole world knows  
Wouldnt want to stop it oh no it shows  
Thats how it goes
