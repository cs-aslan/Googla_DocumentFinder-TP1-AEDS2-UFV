The five oclock whistles on the blink  
The whistle wont blow and whaddya think  
My pop is still in the factory cause he dont know  
What time it happens to be  
  
The five oclock whistle didnt blow  
The whistle is broke and whaddaya know  
If somebody dont find out whats wrong  
Oh my popll be workin all night long  
  
Oh whos gonna fix the whistle  
Wont somebody fix the whistle  
Oh whos gonna fix the whistle  
So my poor old pop will know its time for him to stop  
  
Ya ought to hear what my mommy said  
When papa came home and sneaked into bed  
And told her he worked till half past two  
Cause the five oclock whistle never blew
