Man of madness who lives in my head  
Keeping me awake at night he sits on my bed  
He drives me crazy he wont go away  
Playing his game every night and everyday yeahah  
  
My mind feels heavy my body feels weak  
Suicidal thoughts crying out for some sleep  
Impending doom is what Im about  
Think Im going mad without a shadow of doubt  
  
I search for serenity yeah  
Is it really out there  
I dont read the holy books cause they take me nowhere  
I cant hold on yes Im losing control  
Im paying the price now for Selling My Soul  
Selling My Soul  
  
I search for serenity yeah  
Is it really out there  
I dont read the holy books cause they take me nowhere  
I cant hold on yes Im losing control  
Im paying the price now for Selling My Soul  
Selling My Soul  
  
Yeahah  
For Selling My Soul  
Yeahah  
Selling My Soul  
Yeahah  
For Selling My Soul
