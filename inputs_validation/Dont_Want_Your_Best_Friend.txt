Shes got her independence in a hard fast way  
Shes got me chasing shadows with everything I try to say  
Some say shes far too quick some say shes slow to learn  
But all I know is she gave me love that left afterburn  
And its fire feeds me Im hungry still  
So baby listen now Im at your will  
But Im not a flower on your windowsill  
  
Dont want your best friend  
Dont need a Godsend  
Dont want your new trends  
I want you  
  
Shes got a silver sabre with a diamond shine  
Its not an egotrip just her frightened way  
To keep you blind  
Shadow dancing nowhere fast  
You got to meet me half way  
Girl if its gonna last  
  
I remember that first night  
I dream of it still  
I want that feeling and I want that thrill  
Ive always loved you and I always will  
Take me home
