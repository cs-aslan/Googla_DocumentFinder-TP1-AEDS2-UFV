Made up my mind to say goodbye  
Went to the park for the last time  
But when I saw your eyes  
I knew for the first time  
That theres no goodbye between us  
  
Theres no goodbye  
Theres no goodbye  
Theres no goodbye between us  
  
If one day we slip away  
And that may be in the cards  
We will know deep in our hearts  
That theres no goodbye between us  
  
Theres no goodbye  
Theres no goodbye  
Theres no goodbye between us  
  
Theres no goodbye  
Theres no goodbye  
Theres no goodbye between us
