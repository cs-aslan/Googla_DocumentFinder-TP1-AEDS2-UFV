Its been in the past for awhile  
I get a flash and I smile  
Am I crazy  
Still miss you baby  
It was real  
It was right  
  
But it burned to hot to survive  
All thats left  
Is all these ashes  
Where does the love go  
I dont know  
When its all said and done  
  
How could I be losing you forever  
After all the time we spent together  
I had to know why  
I had to lose you  
Now you just become  
Like everything Ill  
Never find again  
  
At the bottom of the ocean  
Dodod dododo  
Dododo dodod  
Dododo dododo  
In a dream you appear  
For awhile you were here  
So I keep sleeping  
Just to keep you with me  
  
I draw a map  
Connect the dots  
With all the memories that I got  
What Im missing  
Ill keep reliving  
Where does the love go  
I dont know  
When its all said and done  
How could I be losing you forever  
  
After all the time we spent together  
I had to know why  
I had to lose you  
Now you just become  
Like everything Ill never find again  
At the bottom of the ocean  
  
This is it  
Let go  
Breathe  
You dont have to  
Love me for me to  
Baby ever understand  
Just know I love the time we both had  
And I dont ever wanna see you sad  
  
Be happy  
I dont wanna hold you  
If you dont wanna tell me  
You love me babe  
Just know Im gonna have to walk away  
Ill be big enough for the both of us  
To say be happy  
  
Dodododododo  
Be happy  
Dodododododo  
Be happy  
Dodododododo  
Be happy
