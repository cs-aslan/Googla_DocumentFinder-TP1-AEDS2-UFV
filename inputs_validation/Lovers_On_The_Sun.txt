Lets light it up lets light it up  
Until our hearts catch fire  
And so the world a burning light  
Theyve never shined so bright  
Well find a way well find a way  
To keep the cold night  
From breaking in over the walls  
Into the wild side  
The hunger satisfies  
  
Were burning up  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
  
Well never know well never know  
What stands behind the North  
But I got a feeling  
Its a feeling thats were dying for  
Just close your eyes and hold your breath  
Because it feels right  
Well keep it moving till we make it to the other side  
And lets enjoy the ride  
  
Were burning up  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
We might as well be lovers on the sun  
  
Lets light it up lets light it up  
Until our hearts catch fire  
And so the world a burning light  
Theyve never shined so bright
