The water shines  
A pebble skips across the face  
A dozen times then disappears  
Not a trace left behind  
The thrower turns and walks away  
A change of mind  
Another start a brand new day  
  
You know Ill change  
If change is what you require  
Your every wish  
Your every dream hope desire  
  
Here comes the mirror man  
Says hes a people fan  
Here comes the mirror man  
  
And if it seems Im not the one you used to know  
Our little friendship left behind not long ago  
Dont feel too hurt  
As distance heals the strongest pain  
Things are much better now  
And just a nagging doubt remains  
  
You know Ill change  
If change is what you require  
Your every wish  
Your every dream hope desire  
  
Here comes the mirror man  
Says hes a people fan  
Here comes the mirror man  
  
Here comes the mirror man  
Says hes a people fan  
Here comes the mirror man
