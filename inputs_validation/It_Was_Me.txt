The first time I met her  
She walked right up to me and said youre who Ive wanted to find  
There was a man she had seen in her dreams and it was me  
She said I cant believe it cause Ive never been in here  
And Ive passed this so many times  
It was her night to find destiny and it was Me  
  
And we danced every song that they played and talked until closing time  
The closer I held her the more I knew her destiny wasnt that far from mine  
Then I saw a reflection of someone unfamiliar looking back when I looked in
her eyes  
The happiest man Id ever seen and it was me  
  
And we danced every song that they played and talked until closing time  
The closer I held her the more I knew her destiny wasnt that far from mine  
She wasnt looking and I wasnt looking  
Aint it funny Thats when love was found  
She still calls it her lucky night  
Yes someone was lucky shes right  
But it was me  
It was me  
It was me
