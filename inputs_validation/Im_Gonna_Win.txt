Another dark night in the city  
And my prospects lookin thin  
The survival of the fittest  
Is the law in the world that I live in  
  
I was not born to be a fighter  
But nows the time I have to learn  
To keep my head above the water  
Gotta play with fire but not get burned  
  
I gotta stand up I gotta face it  
Dont want to lose it  
I want to taste it while its hot  
Dont want to waste it I need it so bad  
  
Im gonna win yeah  
Im gonna win  
You see its a matter of pride  
Deep down inside  
Im gonna win yeah  
Im gonna win  
  
I got no time to sit and wonder  
I got myself to reckon with  
Yeah and life wont drag me under  
Even if it takes all I have to give  
Ill give it all  
  
I gotta stand up I gotta face it  
Dont want to lose it  
Ooh I want to taste it while its hot  
Dont want to waste it my minds made up  
  
Im gonna win  
Im gonna win  
I tell you see when it comes down to the crunch  
Ive gotta beat life to the punch  
Im gonna win  
Somehow I know Im gonna win  
You know  
Ive got to fight to stay alive  
Kick it in to overdrive  
Im gonna win ooh ooh ooh  
Im gonna win  
  
Im gonna win  
Im gonna win  
You see its a matter of pride  
Deep down inside  
Im gonna win  
Gonna win gonna win  
Ooh Ill pay the price  
Gonna win  
No more Mr Nice  
Gonna win  
Hey just watch me roll the dice  
Im gonna win win win  
Im gonna win win gonna win  
Im gonna win  
I know Im gonna win
