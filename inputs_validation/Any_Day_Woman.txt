If you dont love her youd better let her go  
Youll never fool her youre bound to let it show  
Loves so hard to take when you have to fake  
Everything in return you just preserve her  
When you serve her a little tenderness  
If shes a woman shell try to make it last  
If youre a man now youd better end it fast  
Theres no reason here no treason here  
Just the way a womans mind well she has no name  
She has no shame she just loves you  
Its not easy to undo whats done  
Or to speak too freely to just anyone  
And if this takes more than you bargained for  
Boy its time you learn not to talk so loud  
Walk so proud when youre comin on
