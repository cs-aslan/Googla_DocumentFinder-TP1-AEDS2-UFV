Humankind its not fair why should we all live in fear  
Humankind its a test to see whos the very best  
Humankind dont know why no one cares who lives or dies  
Humankind dont look at me look at yourself what do you see  
  
People  always tellin lies they can keep their alibi  
People  knockin at my door how come they want more and more  
People  talkin behind your back most of them drive a Cadillac  
People  starrin at your clothes  I cant take it anymore  
  
Humankind its a shame some dont even know their name  
Humankind are so strange some need to be rearranged  
Humankind dont know why no one cares who lives or dies  
Humankind dont look at me look at yourself what do you see  
  
Beg The humankind during intro part  
Tell me tell me whos to blame for people acting this way  
Tell me tell me whats so wrong if humans just got along  
Tell me tell me tell me please if psychiatric help is what we need
