If I should love again  
If I should love again  
Ill give my love to nobody else but you  
Youve been so dear to me  
Youve made things clear to me  
And I can see the wonderful dreams come true  
  
When hearts are broken  
And romance ends  
One tender word of love is spoken and then it mends  
So heres to love again  
If I should love again  
Ill give my love to nobody else but you  
  
So heres to love again  
If I should love again  
Ill give my love to nobody else but you
