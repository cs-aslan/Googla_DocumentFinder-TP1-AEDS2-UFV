Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
  
Well its time to celebrate your birthday it happens every year  
Well eat a lot of broccoli and drink a lot of beer  
You should be good and happy that theres something you can eat  
A million people every day are starving in the street  
  
Your daddys in the gutter with the wretched and the poor  
Your mamas in the kitchen with a can of Cycle Four  
Theres garbage in the water  
Theres poison in the sky  
I guess it wont be long before were all gonna die  
  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
  
Well whats the matter little friend you think this party is the pits  
Enjoy it while you can well soon be blown to bits  
The monkeys in the pentagon are gonna cook our goose  
Their fingers on the button all they need it an excuse  
  
It doesnt take a military genius to see  
Well all be crispy critters after World War III  
Theres nowhere you can run to nowhere you can hide  
When they drop the big one we all get fried  
  
Come on boys and girls sing along ok  
  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
wow background screaming sound effect  
  
Well theres a punk in the alley and hes looking for a fight  
Theres an Arab on the corner buying everything in sight  
Theres a mother in the ghetto with another mouth to feed  
Seems that everywhere you look today theres misery and greed  
  
I guess you know the Earth is gonna crash into the sun  
But thats no reason why we shouldnt have a little fun  
So if you think its scary if its more than you can take  
Just blow out the candles and have a piece of cake
