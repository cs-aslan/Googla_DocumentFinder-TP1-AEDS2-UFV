My ole donkey went courtin one day  
With a donkey named Melda across the way  
She was twice his age he put up a fight  
Now hes cryin every night  
Oh lemme go darling Melda  
You breaking my back bone  
Lemme go darling Melda  
You breaking my back  
  
Some people say that my donkey is bad  
an that is because hes from Trinidad  
Donkey of mine he wont work at all  
All he want to do is break out him stall
