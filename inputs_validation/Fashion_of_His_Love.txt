I never was the kind of girl  
Thats naturally sure when it comes to love oh no  
I was insecure insecure  
But when it comes to you and me  
I cant deny this feeling Im feeling inside  
Oh no Ive never been like this before  
This before oh no  
  
Chorus  
I seeing all the signs from above  
Im going to be the one that he loves  
I was made for loving him  
The Fashion of his Love  
Oh yeah  
Im gonna be his first and last kiss  
Cause baby I was born to be his  
I was made for loving him  
The Fashion of his Love I love you  
  
You know that Id never cheat on a man  
Cause Im not like that  
Im physically crafted to be  
As fitting as McQueen  
But when it comes to clothing a man  
Im fashionably just designed to be rad  
Oh hes no words that seem to mean  
What I mean no no no  
No I just cant seem to forget you  
No I cant  
But just as long as I met you  
Youre my babe right through  
I was made for you I was made for you  
  
Chorus  
  
They say I need a strong man  
Not just a friend  
But baby must have reached his death  
No more reason to cry or to justify  
How I feel for you  
My love  
I seeing all the signs from above  
Im going to be the one that he loves  
I was made for loving him  
  
Chorus x2
