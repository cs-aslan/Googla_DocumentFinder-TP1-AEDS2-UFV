What do you want from me  
Now you got me  
Now my fingers bleed  
Now theyre staring at me  
Im a coward now  
I hold my peace  
  
Now you tie me up to your feather bed  
And I twist and turn in a Chinese burn  
You wont let go  
You wont let go  
  
Youre inside my head  
Inside my head  
  
What do you want from me  
Now you got me  
Now my energy you suck from me  
And Im holding on for dear life  
  
Quit smothering me  
Quit laughing at me  
Ive got a disease  
An English disease  
It wont let go  
It wont let go  
  
Youre inside my head  
Inside my head  
  
What did you put in that syringe  
Whatever you really said to him  
Is sitting there inside of me  
  
And you bother me  
You possess me  
Youre there again  
Ahead of me  
And I wont let go  
I wont let go  
  
Youre inside my head  
Inside my head  
Inside my head  
Inside my head
