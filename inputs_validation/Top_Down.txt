Blaze it up and well be cruisin

Rev up the engine well be cruisin  
Watch it go down  
Get in my trunk and Ill be ridin

Verse 1  
From a small town  
Cruisin thru the big city  
Where the fellas are cute  
And the girls are pretty  
Its our world so you know  
Its going down  
I aint got a lotta money  
But I got a lotta style  
What what  
  
Hook  
  
Chorus  
Electric city  
Baby youre mine tonight  
Electric city  
Dont you shine bright  
Electric city  
Baby you light the way  
Electric city  
I think that I might stay  
  
Verse 2  
Passed out real  
And I woke up realer  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
Me and my clique  
Goin hard and you feel us  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
Come on let me take you for a ride  
I aint got a lotta money  
But I got a lotta style  
What what  
  
Hook  
  
Chorus x2
