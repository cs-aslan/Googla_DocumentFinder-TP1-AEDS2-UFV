He looks up from second base  
Dads up in the stands  
He saw the hit the run the slide  
There aint no bigger fan  
  
In the parking lot after the game  
He said Dad I thought you had a plane to catch  
He smiled and said Yeah son I did  
  
But lifes not the breath you take  
The breathing in and out  
That gets you through the day  
Aint what its all about  
You just might miss the point  
Trying to win the race  
Lifes not the breaths you take  
But the moments that take your breath away  
  
Fast forward fifteen years  
And a thousand miles away  
Boys built a life hes got a wife  
And a baby due today  
He hears a voice saying I made it son  
Says I told you Dad you didnt have to come  
He smiles and says Yeah I know you did  
  
But lifes not the breath you take  
The breathing in and out  
That gets you through the day  
Aint what its all about  
You just might miss the point  
Trying to win the race  
Lifes not the breathes you take  
But the moments that take your breath away  
  
Just like it took my breath away when she was born  
Just like it took my breath away when Dad took his last that morn  
  
Lifes not the breathes you take  
The breathing in and out  
That gets you through the day  
Aint what its all about  
You just might miss the point  
If you dont slow down the pace  
Lifes not the breathes you take  
But the moments that take your breath away
