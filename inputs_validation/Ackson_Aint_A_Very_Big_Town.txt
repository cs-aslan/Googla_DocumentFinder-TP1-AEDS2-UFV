Tonight at night we get married my friends all say its a shame and disgrace  
And hes loved every woman in Jackson oh but Jackson aint a very big place  
Tomorrow well go walkin I count each one with a tear on her face  
Then Ill know just how many think Im lucky cause Jackson aint a very big
place  
Jackson is a mighty small town where the gossips and the rumors go round  
But the gossips are the ones he turned down and Jackson aint a very big town  
 steel   
Jackson is a mighty small town
