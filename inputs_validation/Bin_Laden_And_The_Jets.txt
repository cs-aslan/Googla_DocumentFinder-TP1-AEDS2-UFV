Bin Laden And The Jets Benny And The Jets  
  
Hey kids have you see Osama  
We havent heard a thing  
Since he telephoned his mama  
  
We checked his favorite cave he didnt stick around  
  
Were gonna have to send some troops to hunt the bastard down  
  
Hey Taliban clerics gonna make them sweat  
Theyre gonna need those towels  
BBBBin Laden and the jets  
  
Radicals think that hes wonderful  
AlQueda thinks hes really keen  
Hes got a bunch of goofs that he calls troops  
You know hes sponsored by a puppet regime ohhh
