Dont look at me  
  
Everyday is so wonderful  
Then suddenly  
Its hard to breathe  
Now and then I get insecure  
From all the pain  
Im so ashamed  
  
I am beautiful  
No matter what they say  
Words cant bring me down  
I am beautiful  
In every single way  
Yes words cant bring me down  
Ohh no  
So dont you bring me down today  
  
To all your friends youre delirious  
Youre so consumed  
In all your doom ooh  
Trying hard to fill the emptiness  
The pieces gone  
Left the puzzle undone  
Is that the way it is  
  
You are beautiful  
No matter what they say  
Words cant bring you down  
Ohh no  
You are beautiful  
In every single way  
Yes words cant bring you down  
Ohh no  
So dont you bring me down today  
  
No matter what we do  
No matter what we do  
No matter what we say  
No matter what we say  
Were the song inside the tune  
Yeah oh yeah  
Full of beautiful mistakes  
  
And everywhere we go  
And everywhere we go  
The sun will always shine  
The sun will always always shine  
And tomorrow we might awake  
On the other side  
  
Cause we are beautiful  
No matter what they say  
Yes words wont brin us down  
Ohh no  
We are beautiful  
In every single way  
Yes words cant brin us down  
Ohh no  
So dont you brin me down today  
  
Ooh ohh  
Dont you brin me down today  
Dont you brin me down ooh  
Today
