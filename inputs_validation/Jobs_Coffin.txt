Jobs coffin looks down  
Jobs coffin looks down  
  
To see what mankind  
Is gonna do  
  
There is a grid  
Of  
Disempowerment  
  
All forces  
Are being called  
To dismantle this  
  
As Jobs coffin looks down  
Jobs coffin looks down  
  
To see  
What youre gonna do  
  
There exists  
A power of old  
Who wanted earth  
To be controlled  
  
But She  
And She alone  
Is her own  
  
She is her own  
  
Jobs coffin looks down  
Jobs coffin looks down  
  
I cant be proud  
Proud of what I have done  
  
Since time  
Why do we women  
Give ourselves away  
  
We give ourselves away  
Thinking somehow  
That will make him  
Want to stay  
  
Make him stay  
  
Jobs coffin looks down  
At the day you  
Shut your power down  
  
You must uncreate  
That  
Destructive tendency  
  
Let your fire  
Start to  
Heal the fury  
Sister its time  
To bring it  
Back online  
  
As Jobs coffin looks down  
Jobs coffin looks down  
  
To see what youre gonna do  
To see what youre gonna do
