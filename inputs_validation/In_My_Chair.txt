I saw her talking now  
My ears were burning  
Her feet started walking now  
They started turning  
My eyes were half open  
But she didnt see me there  
We ran along walking cross the rooftops  
In my chair  
  
Had a car in my pocket  
And we started moving  
A man in a helmet said  
Whats that youre using  
My eyes were half open  
But we didnt see him there  
Put the car back in my pocket  
And Im still here in my chair  
  
My teeth were laughing now  
We couldnt stop smiling  
We danced to the Mystery Band  
Without even trying  
My eyes were half open  
But we didnt see them there  
We ran along walking cross the rooftops  
In my chair
