Is that what time it is  
Im sorry if I woke you with this call  
But all this wine is in my head  
And Im so lonely from it all  
Dont hang up  
Baby hear what I gotta say  
We started out such a beautiful story  
We just cant end this way  
  
I want to come over I want to love you tonight  
I dont care about the time or whos wrong or whos right  
Just say its OK and Ill be on my way  
I want to come over could you get outta bed  
Ill try to unsay all the things Ive said  
Please say its OK and Ill be on my way  
  
Is that what time it is  
Im sorry if Im keeping you from your sleep  
But all these feelings are running through me  
You know I never knew they ran so deep  
Whats that youre sayin  
That just before I phoned  
You were gettin ready to give me call  
Cause you were feelin so alone  
  
I want to come over I want to love you tonight  
I dont care about the time or whos wrong or whos right  
Just say its OK and Ill be on my way  
I want to come over could you get outta bed  
Ill try to unsay all the things Ive said  
Please say its OK and Ill be on my way  
I want to come over  
I comin over  
I want to come over  
Just let me come over tonight
