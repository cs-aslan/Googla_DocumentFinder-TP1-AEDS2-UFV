I get along without you very well Hoagy Carmichael 1939  
  
Ive forgotten everything about you  
Til someone says your name  
Ive forgotten all the reasons I loved you  
Til someone tells me that you rang  
  
The memories are hazy now  
I dont recall at all  
Theres nothing theres nothing there  
Just me  
And I dont understand why  
  
I cant recollect my feelings  
Til someone mentions that they saw you  
I really dont remember all the things you said  
Til someone shows me where you live  
  
Why is everything so hazy now  
I dont recall at all  
Theres nothing theres nothing there  
Just me  
And I dont understand why  
  
I cant recall your smile  
The touch of your hand holding mine  
And I cant remember why  
Holding you seemed so right  
  
The memories theyre hazy now  
I dont recall at all  
Theres nothing theres nothing there  
Just me  
And I dont understand why  
  
Ive forgotten everything about you  
Til someone says your name  
Ive forgotten all the reasons I loved you  
Til someone tells me that you rang
