I had not planned on seeing you  
I was afraid of what Id do  
But pride is strong here am I  
And I just cant let you say goodbye  
  
Please have no fear youre in no harm  
As long as youre here in my arms  
But you cant leave so please dont try  
But I just cant let you say goodbye  
  
What force behind your evil mind  
Can let your lips speak so unkind  
To one who loves as much as I  
I just cant let you say goodbye  
  
The flesh around your throat is pale  
Intended by my fingernails  
Please dont scream and please dont cry  
Cause I just cant let you say goodbye  
  
Your voice is still it speaks no more  
Youll never hurt me anymore  
Death is a friend to love and I  
Cause now youll never say goodbye
