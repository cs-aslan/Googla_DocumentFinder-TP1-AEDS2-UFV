Paradise  
I got man who loves me  
In his life  
He puts no one else above me  
Its paradise  
With everything I ever wanted  
Paradise  
Its just like love should be  
  
Now youre a thief  
Everybody I know knows it  
Youre indiscreet  
Anybody on the street knows  
That you cheat  
The damage that youre doin doesnt  
Cross your mind  
Steal the heart just like a thief  
  
Chorus  
Who but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
Tell me tell me tell me who  
Who but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
Tell me tell me  
Who but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
Who but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
Who but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
  
You got me  
Thinkin I want what youre givin  
You got me  
Wonderin what Im missin  
I can see  
Its the same old fascination  
What a deadly game  
That sends them all right into your flame  
  
Chorus
