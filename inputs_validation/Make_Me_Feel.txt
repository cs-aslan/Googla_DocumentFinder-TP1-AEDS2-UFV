This aint no make believe  
I aint foolin around this time  
You can believe what you want to believe  
Its a sin the way weve wasted our time  
  
Make me feel like I wanna feel  
Baby tear this pain from my heart  
Make me feel like I wanna feel  
Make me feel like I did in the start  
  
Maybe its a change of plan  
Now that your dreams have left me behind  
Or is it another man  
Who didnt care that you were mine  
  
Baby this could be our last chance  
Now youre actin like its no big deal  
Make me feel like I wanna feel  
Make me feel like I did in the start  
  
I can hear I can hear I can hear  
The radio playin your favorite song  
I dont care I dont care I dont care  
I know that something had to go wrong  
  
Baby dont you walk away  
Stay here and listen to my plans  
You can leave make it another day  
Stay tonight and hold me in your hands
