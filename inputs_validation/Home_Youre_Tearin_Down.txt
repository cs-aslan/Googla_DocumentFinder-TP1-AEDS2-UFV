I dont know your name I wouldnt know your face  
But youre right with the one I love out there someplace  
You have an invitation be free to come around  
Come over anytime and see the home youre tearin down  
Once some happy faces would have met you at the door  
But since their daddys gone so much they dont smile anymore  
Theres shattered parts of broken hearts just scattered all around  
Come over anytime and see the home youre tearin down  
 steel   
Ill dry all my tears and have the coffee hot  
Cause I cant sleep a wink no more times all Ive got  
You see the price Im payin for happiness youve found  
Come over anytime and see the home youre tearin down  
Youve told how much you loved him you can surely tell me too  
Id like to know just what youve done to make him turn to you  
I swallow pride and hear you sigh if youll just come around  
Come over anytime and see the home youre tearin down
