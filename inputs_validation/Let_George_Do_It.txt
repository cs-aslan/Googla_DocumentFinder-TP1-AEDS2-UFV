Whats this fierce new change  
Has your juggernaut reached my door  
Am I out of range  
Think another thought before  
Babies are ground up  
In the last big roundup  
Ease your head play it cool in a patio chair  
Try to design a postcard from your mind  
Piggy bank ooooowhee  
If its Heavensent then youll go far  
Listen well to me  
Smoke that 7 cent cigar  
Can that rumble  
And Avogadros Number  
Chorus  
Polaroid galore  
Snap my jelly roll  
Count your change  
For your midnight chore  
Play that sellyoursoul exchange  
Menthol filter tips  
Danglin from your nether lip  
Chorus  
If John Doe writes another book  
With words that just wont quit  
Why must I forge through it  
Let George do it
