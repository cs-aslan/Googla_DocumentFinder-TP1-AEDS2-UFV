I dont know why I feel this way  
I dont know if its right or wrong to laugh at misfortune  
Darkness can never last too long  
  
Every time I think Im falling  
And theres nobody around to hold me up  
And it seems like the world has come to an end  
I look for miles but not a face is friendly  
Then suddenly a hole opens up in the ground  
The bottom of the hole is a raging fire  
I try to jump over but theres no way  
The next thing I know Im going down  
  
Chorus  
Does it hurt  
Oh it really doesnt matter  
Does it burn  
Oh I dont feel a thing  
Does it sting  
Oh yeah it really doesnt matter  
Does it hurt  
Oh I dont give a damn  
When I find myself falling and I hit the bottom  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
When I go down the hole and I hit the bottom  
  
The last time that I fell in love  
The love was milk and honey but the milk turned sour  
The woman became a monster  
And everyone I knew had become a stranger  
And the room went black and my luck was spent  
The floor opened up down I went  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
Coming right back  
Coming right back  
Cause you cant keep me down  
Cant keep me down  
Oh in the ground  
  
Does it hurt  
Oh it really doesnt matter  
Does it burn  
Oh I dont feel a thing  
I dont mind just a little pain  
Ooh oh yeah  
Whoa  
  
Remembering when I was a young man  
How everything seemed to turn against me  
I didnt know a soul it was an alien place  
The sun was covered by a dark cloud  
And though I tried I couldnt find a way to escape  
The only way to go was straight down  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
  
I dont know why I feel this way  
I dont know if its right or wrong to laugh at misfortune  
Darkness can never last too long  
When you laugh in its face  
When you laugh in its face  
I dont know why I feel this way
