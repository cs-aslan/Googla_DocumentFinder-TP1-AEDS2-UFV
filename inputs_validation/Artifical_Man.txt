Scene After his capture Flash is taken to a secret hideout to have  
His brain cleansed and his mind conditioned  
Flash Mr Black and the Mad Scientist sing  
  
Flash I cant believe its happening  
I just want to stay the way that I am  
I dont want to live a lie in an artificial world  
  
Mr Black Lets build an antiseptic world  
Full of artificial people  
Cure all diseases conquer pain  
And monitor the human brain  
And see what thoughts youre thinking  
Observe your feelings  
Secret fears  
Controlling everything you say and do  
And we will build a master race  
To live within our artificial world  
Tell it to the people all across the land  
Were going to build an artificial man  
With the physique of a Tarzan  
And the profile of a Cary Grant  
A superior being  
Totally made by hand  
Throw out imperfection  
Mould you section by section  
Gonna make you the ultimate creation  
  
Flash I can visualise the day  
When the world will be controlled by artificial people  
But I dont want to live a lie in an artificial world  
  
Mr Black Tell the world that we finally did it  
Made a man thats totally programmed  
Preconditioned thoughts and emotions  
  
Pushbutton artificial man  
Did you ever want to live forever  
Well heres your chance to be a total automaton  
Cause weve improved on Gods creation  
An outdated homo sapien  
Make you taller if you want it  
Make your hair grow longer if you need it  
If it doesnt exist then I guess we can breed it  
Therell be no disagreements  
Well dedicate our lives to achievements  
And organise your life and keep it totally planned
