I know great distance still remains  
Between us  
But theres good reason to hold on  
Its the happiest time of the year  
Filled with laughter and good cheer  
As you watch the snow  
Sweet love youll hear me say  
  
Youve got my heart on Christmas  
Inside my soul your love remains  
Loves in our hearts  
On Christmas day  
  
The days and weeks and months go by  
So slowly  
We are both wishing them to fly wishing in the fly  
As the night begins to fall  
Twilight crowns the bedroom cheer drowns in mellow cheer  
Such a rush of joy  
Your love it comforts me  
And I do believe  
  
Loves in our hearts on Christmas  
Though far apart  
As one we pray  
Loves in our hearts  
On Christmas day  
  
Snowflake melts in your eye and turns to tear  
But you cheek it stays dry  
With your warm smile so near  
I have no fear  
Were gonna make it  
Loves in our hearts on Christmas  
Though far apart  
As one we pray  
Loves in our hearts love is in our hearts  
On Christmas day
