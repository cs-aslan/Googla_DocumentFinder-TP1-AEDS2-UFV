Oh Take me back to dear old Blighty  
Put me on the train for London Town  
Take me anywhere  
Drop me anywhere  
Liverpool Leeds or Birmingham  
But I dont care  
I should like to see my  
  
I dont bless them  
Farewell to this lands cheerless marshes  
Hemmed in like a boar between arches  
Her very Lowness with a head in a sling  
Im truly sorry  but it sounds like a wonderful thing  
  
I said Charles dont you ever crave  
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail  
Dressed in your Mothers bridal veil  
Oh  
And so I checked all the registered historical facts  
And I was shocked into shame to discover  
How Im the eighteenth pale descendant  
Of some old queen or other  
  
Oh has the world changed or have I changed  
Oh has the world changed or have I changed  
  
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs  
I swear to God  
I swear  I never even knew what drugs were  
Oh  
So I broke into the palace  
With a sponge and a rusty spanner  
She said  Eh I know you and you cannot sing  
I said  Thats nothing  you should hear me play piano  
  
We can go for a walk where its quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
But when youre tied to your Mothers apron  
Noone talks about castration  
Oh  
  
We can go for a walk where its quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
Like love and law and poverty  
Oh these are the things that kill me  
  
We can go for a walk where its quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
But the rain that flattens my hair  
Oh these are the things that kill me  
  
All their lies about makeup and long hair are still there  
  
Past the pub who saps your body  
And the church wholl snatch your money  
The Queen is dead boys  
And its so lonely on a limb  
Past the pub that wrecks your body  
And the church  all they want is your money  
The Queen is dead boys  
And its so lonely on a limb  
  
Life is very long when youre lonely  
Life is very long when youre lonely  
Life is very long when youre lonely  
Life is very long when youre lonely
