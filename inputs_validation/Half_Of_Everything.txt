You walk in my house with her lipstick over your face  
You tell me you got news for me  
Well do you think I cant see straight  
Do you think I cant recognize her perfume on your clothes  
You tell me you got news for me  
Well I dont need to be told  
Let me guess shes looking for a little peace of mind  
I dont want to cause any more pain  
But could I please have whats mine  
Shes got such a pretty please  
I never could say no  
Well just take her half of everything and then please go  
Now I know right now youre thinking  
Im some crazy kind of fool  
But the truth of the matter is Im just like you  
Shes some kind of voodoo woman  
She said she cant use me anymore  
Thats what she said to me  
She said I cant use you anymore  
I dont need your lovin  
I dont need your kissin  
I dont need for you to tell me  
All that Ive been missin  
I dont need your lovin  
I dont need your kissin  
I dont need for you to tear me down  
And tear me down again  
Every time you give a little more  
She could still use a little more  
Every time you give a little more  
She could still use a little more  
And when you cant give a little more  
She could still use a little more  
She could still use a little more  
She could still use a little more  
Tell her that she done me  
That she done me good  
Tell her that she done me  
Like a lady should  
I never ever seen her and I hope I never do  
I might have to show her just what love can do  
The sun aint gonna shine and the rain is gonna fall  
Cause I put a spell on you  
And all the years I cried  
All the years that I tried  
To save a stillborn love  
I know what youre thinking  
Pretty soon Ill howl at the moon  
But you better believe me  
Cause I was just like you  
Mister read the writing on the wall  
Get out while youre still whole  
While youre still breathing  
I dont need your lovin  
I dont need your lovin  
Kissin  
I dont need your kissin  
Lovin no I dont need  
Tear me down again  
I dont need your lovin  
Mmm lovin  
I dont need your kissin  
Mmm kissin and I dont need  
Tear me down again  
I dont need your lovin  
Yeah  
I dont need your kissin  
No I dont need her to tear me down again
