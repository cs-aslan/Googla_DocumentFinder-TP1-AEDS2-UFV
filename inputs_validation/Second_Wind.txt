Why do we build up all these idols  
Just to watch em fall  
Youre wearin the crown toast of the town  
And no one takes your call  
  
Yeah maybe Ive been down down down down  
But I always come back around round round round  
  
You cant forget about me  
While you werent lookin I was gettin even higher  
Say what you want about me  
Your words are gasoline on my fire  
You can hate me underestimate me  
Do what you do cause what you do dont phase me  
Just when you think Im at the end  
Any second Ima catch my second wind  
  
An airplanes only paper til it finds a breeze  
But dont you know that its the low that makes the high so sweet  
When they try to break break break you  
Thats when you get your break break breakthrough  
  
You cant forget about me  
While you werent lookin I was gettin even higher  
Say what you want about me  
Your words are gasoline on my fire  
You can hate me underestimate me  
Do what you do cause what you do dont phase me  
Just when you think Im at the end  
Any second Ima catch my second wind  
  
Yeah maybe Ive been down down down down  
But I always come back around round round round  
  
You cant forget about me  
While you werent lookin I was gettin even higher  
Say what you want about me  
Your words are gasoline on my fire  
You can hate me underestimate me  
Do what you do cause what you do dont phase me  
Just when you think Im at the end  
Any second Ima catch my second wind
