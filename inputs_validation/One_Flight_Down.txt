One flight down  
Theres a song on low  
And your mind just picked up on the sound  
Now you know that youre wrong  
Because it drifts like smoke  
And its been there playing all along  
Now you know  
Now you know  
  
The reeds and the brass have been waving  
Leading into a single note  
  
In this place  
Where youre arms unfold  
Here at last I see your ancient face  
Now you know  
Now you know  
  
The cadence rolls in broken  
Plays it over and then goes  
  
One flight down  
Theres a song on the low  
And its been there playing all along  
Now you know  
Now you know
