Beat surrender  
Come on boy come on girl  
Succumb to the beat surrender  
All the things that I care about are packed into one punch  
All the things that Im not sure about are sorted out at once  
  
And as it was in the beginning so shall it be in the end  
That bullshit is bullshit it just goes by different names  
  
All the things that I shout about but never act upon  
All the courage and the dreams that I have  
but seem to wait so long  
My doubt is cast aside watch phonies run to hide  
The dignified dont even enter in the game  
  
And if you feel theres no passion  
No quality sensation  
Seize the young determination  
Show the fakers you aint foolin  
Youll see me come runnin  
To the sound of your strummin  
Fill my heart with joy and gladness  
Ive lived too long in shadows of sadness
