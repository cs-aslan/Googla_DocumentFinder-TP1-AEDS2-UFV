Well when I met you at the station  
You were standing with a bootleg in your hand  
I took you back to my little place  
For a taste of a multicolored band  
Were gonna get hi hi hi  
The night is young  
Shell be my funky little mama  
Gonna rock it and weve only just begun  
  
Were gonna get hi hi hi  
With the music on  
Wont say byebye byebye byebye byebye  
Til the night is gone  
Im gonna do it to you gonna do it  
Sweet banana youll never give up  
Were gettin hi hi hi in the midday sun  
  
Well well take off your face  
Recover from the trip youve been on  
I want to lie on the bed  
Get you ready for my polygon  
Im gonna do it to you gonna do it  
Sweet banana youve never been done  
Yes I go like a rabbit gonna grab it  
Gonna do it til the night is done  
  
Were gonna get hi hi hi with the music on  
Wont say byebye byebye byebye byebye  
Til the night is gone  
Im gonna do it to you gonna do it  
Sweet banana youll never give up  
Were gonna get hi hi hi were gonna get hi hi hi  
Were gonna get hi hi hi in the midday sun
