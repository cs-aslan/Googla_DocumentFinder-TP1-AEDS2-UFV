Youre just a stranger in the past  
Just another mug that could never last  
You came up slow but you burned out fast didnt ya  
  
It aint Silver Needles on the run  
No it aint Silver Needles on the run  
It aint Silver Needles on the run  
Shh you make me feel so bad  
  
You thought you was the only one that got messed up  
Me n all the others never had it so rough  
Well how come youre dead and Im still stood up  
  
Well it aint Silver Needles on the run  
Silver Needles on the run  
No it aint Silver Needles on the run  
Oh I remember  
  
All your plans were made on some PR floor  
N all your bags were packed they never reached the door  
Out ordering  your thought exchange  
All your brains were acting strange  
You never lied in dreams before  
There must be more to life than getting sore  
  
What do you think  
I seen in some music paper that you was gone  
And I went right out and wrote you a farewell song  
Boy they had you dead before you was born  
And its a shame  you were such a great mover  
  
But it aint Silver Needles on the run  
No it aint Silver Needles on the run  
Silver Needles on the run  
Silver Needles on the run  
Silver Needles on the run  
Silver Needles on the run  
Next
