Dear Haley  
Can you save me from  
The borrowed cloud Im on  
All youve gotta do is try  
Pray youre just getting by  
  
Hey wait I thought you made it  
Howd your bottled crown fall off  
Tell me howd you get so tired  
Fade it down to the wire  
  
Try living a lie and kicking out  
The same old guise  
Wasting time  
  
So very ordinary  
Wait until my bomb goes off  
See the actors run and hide  
Fake it all in stride  
  
One day we all can say where were gone  
And haunt the ground were from  
Everythings so open wide  
Hear within the divide  
  
Try living a lie and kicking out  
The same old guise  
Wasting time  
  
Aint it the life  
Aint it the life  
Aint it the life  
Got no crime  
Just sail on by  
Sail on by  
Aint it the life  
  
Try living a lie and kicking out  
The same old guise  
Wasting time
