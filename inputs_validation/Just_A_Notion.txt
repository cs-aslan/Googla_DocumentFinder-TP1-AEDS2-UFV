Just a notion thats all  
Just a feeling that youre watchin me  
Every move Im making  
Am I reading your mind  
Cause its almost like youre touching me  
There is no mistaking  
Just a notion  
That youll be walkin up to me  
In a while  
And you smile and say hello  
Then well be dancing through the night  
Knowing everything from there on  
Must be right  
  
Just a notion  
But somehow I know Im not wrong  
If its our destiny theres nothing we can do  
But tonight is very special  
Its the night for me and you
