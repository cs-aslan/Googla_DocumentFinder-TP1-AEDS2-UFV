Polly pretty Polly come go away with me  
Polly pretty Polly come go away with me  
Before we get married some pleasures to see  
She jumped up beside him and away they did go  
She jumped up beside him and away they did go  
Over the mountains and the valleys below  
Billy oh Billy Im afraid for my life  
Billy oh Billy Im afraid for my life  
Im afraid you mean to murder me and leave me behind  
Polly pretty Polly youre guessing about right  
Polly pretty Polly youre guessing about right  
Ive been digging your grave for the best part of your  
Life  
He stabbed her through the heart and her hot blood did  
Flow  
He stabbed her through the heart and her hot blood did  
Flow  
And into the grave pretty Polly did go  
He threw a little dirt over her and started for home  
He threw a little dirt over her and started for home  
Leaving nobody there but the wild birds to moan  
A debt to the devil Billy must pay  
A debt to the devil Billy must pay  
For killing pretty Polly and running away
