Im driving home tonight catching all red lights  
Thats alright cause I dont want to be alone  
Theres nobody waitin there cold and empty bed  
Words I wished Id said come on the radio  
  
Ooh oh oh and I dont know why I do this to myself  
Ooh oh oh I know youre with someone else  
  
But in my mind were somewhere in my car  
And its raining hard on the streetlight glow  
You got your lips on mine its gasoline on fire  
I never will forget you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head  
And your fingertips slide up and down my back  
Breathin hard steamin up the glass  
Id give anything if I could bring you back home  
  
So Ive been sleeping til noon in the same bedroom  
Where I once held you and its breaking my heart  
I should take down all those pictures from my wall  
Promises we made wont fill this empty space  
  
Ooh oh oh and I dont know why I just cant let you go  
Ooh oh oh I know youre never coming back  
  
But in my mind were somewhere in my car  
And its raining hard on the streetlight glow  
You got your lips on mine its gasoline on fire  
I never will forget you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head  
And your fingertips slide up and down my back  
Breathin hard steamin up the glass  
Id give anything if I could bring you back home  
  
But in my mind were somewhere in my car  
And its raining hard on the streetlight glow  
You got your lips on mine its gasoline on fire  
I never will forget you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head  
And your fingertips slide up and down my back  
Breathin hard steamin up the glass  
Id give anything if I could bring you back home
