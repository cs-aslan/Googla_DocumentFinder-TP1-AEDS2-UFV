By Chuck Berry as done by Nazareth  
Nineteeen years old and as sweet as she can be  
Dressed up like a downtown Christmas tree  
Dancin and hummin a rockroll melody  
Shes the daughter of a wellrespected man  
Who taught her how to judge and understand  
Soon she became a rockroll music fan  
Sweet little rock and roller sweet little rock and roller  
Papa dont have to scold her says he cant hardly hold her  
She never gets any older sweet little rock and roller  
Shouldve seen her eyes when the band began to play  
Famous singers sang and barred away  
Stars performed she screamed and yelled Hooray  
Ten thousand eyes were watching her leave the floor  
Five thousand tongues were screaming out More More  
About fifteen hundred waitin outside the door  
Sweet little rock and roller  
Sweet little rock and roller  
Papa dont have to scold her says he cant hardly hold her  
She never gets any older sweet little rock and roller  
Sweet little rock and roller  
Sweet little rock and roller  
Sweet little rock and roller  
Sweet little rock and roller  
Sweet little rock and roller
