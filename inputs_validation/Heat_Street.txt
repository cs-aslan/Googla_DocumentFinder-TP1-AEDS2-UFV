What can I hear Who can I see  
Whats this I fear thats followin me  
Its getting louder its coming near  
I can not stand it Im gettin outta here  
  
Youd better beware now  
Youd better take care now  
The street of the sinner  
So youll never be a winner  
  
The rain is falling around my feet  
The night is calling on this welllit street  
People in doorways just stand and stare  
Castaway shadows that really arent there  
  
Youd better beware now  
Youd better take care now  
The street of the sinner  
So youll never be a winner  
  
What can I hear Who can I see  
Whats this I fear thats followin me  
Its getting louder its coming near  
I can not stand it Im getting outta here  
  
Youd better beware now  
Yeah youd better take care now  
The street of the sinner  
So youll never be a winner  
  
Youll never be a winner  
On heat street
