Say a word for Jimmy Brown  
He aint got nothing at all  
Not a shirt right of his back  
He aint got nothing at all  
And say a word for Ginger Brown  
Walks with his head down to the ground  
Took the shoes right of his feet  
To poor boy right out in the street  
  
And this is what he said  
Oh sweet nuthin  
She aint got nothing at all  
Oh sweet nutin  
She aint got nothing at all  
  
Say a word for Polly May  
She cant tell the night from the day  
They threw her out in the street  
But just like a cat she landed on her feet  
And say a word for Joanna Love  
She aint got nothing at all  
Cause everyday she falls in love  
And every night she falls when she does  
  
She said  
Oh sweet nuthin  
You know she aint got nothing at all  
Oh sweet nutin  
She aint got nothing at all  
  
Oh let me hear you  
Say a word for Jimmy Brown  
He aint got nothing at all  
Not a shirt right of his back  
He aint got nothing at all  
And say a word for Ginger Brown  
Walks with his head down to the ground  
Took the shoes right of his feet  
To poor boy right out in the street  
  
And this is what he said  
Oh sweet nuthin  
She aint got nothing at all  
Oh sweet nutin  
She aint got nothing at all  
She aint got nothing at all  
Oh sweet nutin  
  
She aint got nothing at all  
She aint got nothing at all  
She aint got nothing at all
