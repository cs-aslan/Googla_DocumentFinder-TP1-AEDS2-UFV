If I could write to the kid I was before  
Id tell him youd get everything you ever wanted  
But you will still want more  
Someones gonna tell you  
Who you should wanna be  
So you forget the vision that they didnt want to see  
And when they give up cause they will give up say  
Here I am alive  
  
They say you dont grow up you just grow old  
Its safe to say I havent done both  
I made mistakes I know I know  
But here I am alive  
So many people close to me cut me down  
This is supposed to be a bad luck town  
I jumped I fell I hit the ground  
But here I am alive  
  
If I could write to myself when I was on top of it all  
Id say youre going overboard and when you are falling  
Youre gonna feel so small  
Someones gonna tell you that you deserve the worst  
Theyd say youre never coming back and tell you that youre cursed  
But when they give up cause they always give up say  
Here I am alive  
  
They say you dont grow up you just grow old  
Its safe to say I havent done both  
I made mistakes I know I know  
But here I am alive  
So many people close to me cut me down  
This is supposed to be a bad luck town  
I jumped I fell I hit the ground  
But here I am alive  
  
And when they give up cause they will give up  
Say Here I am alive  
And when they give up cause they always give up  
Say Here I am alive  
  
They say you dont grow up you just grow old  
Its safe to say I havent done both  
I made mistakes I know I know  
But here I am alive  
So many people close to me cut me down  
This is supposed to be a bad luck town  
I jumped I fell I hit the ground  
But here I am alive  
  
Here I am alive  
Here I am alive  
Here I am alive  
Here I am alive  
Here I am alive  
Here I am alive  
Here I am alive  
Here I am  
  
If I could write to the kid I was before
