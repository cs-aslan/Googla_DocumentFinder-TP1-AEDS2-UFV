Tearing me apart with words you wouldnt say  
Suddenly tomorrows moment washed away  
Cause I dont have a reason  
And you dont have the time  
But we both keep on waiting for something we wont find  
  
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday  
With shadows floating over the scars begin to fade  
We said it was forever but then it slipped away  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
  
The final masquerade  
  
All Ive ever wanted the secrets that you keep  
All you ever wanted the truth I couldnt speak  
Cause I cant see forgiveness  
And you cant see the crime  
And we both keep on waiting for what we left behind  
  
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday  
With shadows floating over the scars begin to fade  
We said it was forever  
But then it slipped away  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
  
The final masquerade  
The final masquerade  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
  
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday  
With shadows floating over  
The scars begin to fade  
We said it was forever  
But then it slipped away  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
