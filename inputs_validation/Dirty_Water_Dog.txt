No candidate would I support  
His platform could I endorse  
Another accomplice slinging dirt  
Campaign promises falling short  
I dont belong to any race  
Pledge allegiance to a place  
No borderline in the sand Id trace  
Im just a sucker for a pretty face  
Uncomfortable in the realm of the political  
Positions always been a little left of cynical  
Im fundamentally for the individual  
Preoccupied purely with the physical  
  
When heavy is the weight of the world  
And the river runs a little too deep  
Like a hound dog chasing a bird  
Sometimes a certain toms gotta peep  
Im a peekaboy looking at girls  
And I think I like I think I like I like what I see  
  
I dont want to find religion  
Or another mans opinion  
I cant choose whats not my decision  
When theres only one under the sun  
Theres no need to be denied  
Chew before swallowing pride  
I want to live so let me die  
Oh by the way whats your sign  
  
Cant comprehend the meaning of the metaphysical  
Id rather leave that to your socalled intellectual  
But what I do know I know feels only natural  
Im just a redblooded heterosexual  
  
When heavy is the weight of the world  
And the river runs a little too deep  
Like a dirty water doggin a bird  
Sometimes a certain toms he gotta peep  
Im a peekaboy looking at girls  
And I think I like I think I like I like what I see  
  
When heavy is the weight of the world  
And the river runs a little too deep  
Like a dirty water doggin a bird  
Sometimes a certain toms he gotta peep  
Im a peekaboy looking at girls  
And I think I like like a hound dog chasin a bird  
  
And I think I like  
A dirty water dog  
And I think I like I think I like I like what I see
