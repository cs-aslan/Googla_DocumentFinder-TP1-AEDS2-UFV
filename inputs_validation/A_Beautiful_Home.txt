Theres a beautiful home far over the sea  
There are mansions of bliss for you and for me  
Oh that beautiful home so wonderfly fair  
That the savior for me has gone to prepare  
  
Chorus echo first part of each line part with  marks  
Theres a beautiful home far over the sea  
Theres a beautifu home for you and for me  
And its glittering powr the sun outshines  
And that beautiful home someday shall be mine  
  
In that beautiful home a crown I shall wear  
When the glorified throne that glory to share  
But the joys of that home can never be known  
Till the savior we see upon his white throne  
  
Chorus echo first part of each line part with  marks  
Theres a beautiful home far over the sea  
Theres a beautifu home for you and for me  
And its glittering powr the sun outshines  
And that beautiful home someday shall be mine
