Coming out of my cage  
And Ive been doin just fine  
Gotta gotta be down  
Because I want it all  
It started out with a kiss  
How did it end up like this  
It was only a kiss  
It was only a kiss  
Now Im falling asleep  
And shes calling a cab  
While hes having a smoke  
And shes taking a drag  
Now theyre going to bed  
And my stomach is sick  
And its all in my head  
But shes touching his chest now  
He takes off her dress now  
Let me go  
And I just cant look  
Its killing me  
And taking control  
Jealousy  
Turning saints into the sea  
Swimming through sick lullabies  
Choking on your alibis  
But its just the price I pay  
Destiny is calling me  
Open up my eager eyes  
Cus Im Mr Brightside  
  
Im coming out of my cage

I never  
I never  
I never  
I never
