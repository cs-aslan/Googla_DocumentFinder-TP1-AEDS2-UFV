Im happier than the morning sun  
And thats the way you said that it would be  
If I should ever bring you inside my life  
  
Im happier than the morning sun  
And thats the way you said that it would be  
If I should ever bring you inside my life  
  
All my life I was alone  
Didnt think Id find my part  
Now I see theres joy inside your arms  
  
Every day I searched for the star  
That never was in the sky  
And now I see this star is on earth  
  
And Im happier than the morning sun  
And thats the way you said that I would be  
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life  
  
And I am happier than the morning sun  
And thats the way it will always be  
Ever since the day you came inside of my life  
  
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom  
Bom bom bom I love you  
  
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom  
Bom bom bom I love you  
  
And Im happier than the morning sun  
And thats the way you said that it would be  
If I should ever bring you inside my life  
  
Im happier than the morning sun  
And thats the way you said it would be  
If I should ever bring you inside my life  
  
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom  
Bom bom bom bom bom bom  
  
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom  
Bom bom bom I love you  
  
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom  
  
Bom bom bom I love you  
  
Happier than the morning sun  
Thats the way you said it would be  
If I should ever bring you inside my life  
  
Im happier than the stars above  
Thats the way you said that it would be  
If I should ever bring you inside of my life  
  
I believe that everyone should be  
Happier than the morning sun  
Happier than the morning sun  
Happier than the morning sun  
Happier than the morning sun
