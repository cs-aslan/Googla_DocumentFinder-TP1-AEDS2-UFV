Mmmmmmm  
Sugar coco brown  
She stands five foot three  
Shes all by herself  
It doesnt make no sense to me shes incredible  
Im watching real close close  
But I take it slow slow  
Make sure shes not with anybody anybody  
Very insecure so that now I am sure sure  
I slide right in and next to the Shorty  
  
And say now correct me if Im wrong arent you alone tonight alone tonight  
You got it going on  
Girl your everything I like everything I like  
And Im not trying to bother you  
But girl if you dont mind girl if you dont mind  
Can I keep you company Keep you company  
Baby can I keep you company Keep you company  
  
Smiling at me now  
Such a pretty smile such a pretty smile  
Im figuring her out  
And I really dig her style really dig her style  
We have a couple drinks oh  
Have a couple laughs oh  
Suddenly the nights about to end  
We have one more toast oh  
Than she pulls me close and in my ear she starts whispering  
  
Correct me if Im wrong arent you alone tonight alone tonight  
You got it going on  
Your everything I like everything I like  
And Im not trying to bother you  
But if you dont mind if you dont mind  
Can I keep you company Keep you company  
Baby can I keep you company Keep you company  
  
She said correct me if Im wrong arent you alone tonight alone tonight  
You got it going on  
Your everything I like everything I like  
And Im not trying to bother you  
If you dont mind if you dont mind  
Can I keep you company Keep you company  
Baby can I keep you company Keep you company
