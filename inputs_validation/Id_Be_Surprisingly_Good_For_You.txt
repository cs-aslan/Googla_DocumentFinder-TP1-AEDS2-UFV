Eva Colonel Peron  
Peron Eva Duarte  
  
Eva and Peron  
Ive heard so much about you  
  
Eva and Peron  
Im amazed for Im only an actress a soldier  
Nothing to shout about One of the thousands  
Only a girl on the air Defending the country he loves  
  
Eva  
But when you act the things you do affect us all  
  
Peron  
But when you act you take us away from the squalor of the real  
World  
Are you here on your own  
  
Eva  
Yes oh yes  
  
Peron  
So am I what a fortunate coincidence  
Maybe youre my reward for my efforts here tonight  
  
Eva  
It seems crazy but you must believe  
Theres nothing calculated nothing planned  
Please forgive me if I seem naive  
I would never want to force your hand  
But please understand Id be good for you  
  
I dont always rush in like this  
Twenty seconds after saying hello  
Telling strangers Im too good to miss  
If Im wrong I hope youll tell me so  
But you really should know Id be good for you  
Id be surprisingly good for you  
  
I wont go on if Im boring you  
But do you understand my point of view  
Do you like what you hear what you see  
And would you be good for me too  
  
Im not talking of a hurried night  
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye  
Creeping home before it gets too light  
Thats not the reason that I caught your eye  
Which has to imply Id be good for you  
Id be surprisingly good for you  
  
Peron  
Please go on you enthrall me  
I can understand you perfectly  
And I like what I hear what I see and knowing me  
I would be good for you too  
  
Eva  
Im not talking of a hurried night  
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye  
Creeping home before it gets too light  
Thats not the reason that I caught your eye  
Which has to imply Id be good for you
