Backside melts into the sofa  
My world my TV and my food  
Besides listening to my belly gurgle  
Aint much else to do  
  
Yeah I sweat a lot  
Pants fall down every time I bend over  
And my feet itch  
Yeah  I married a scarecrow  
  
I hate you  
Talkin to myself  
Everybodys starin at me  
Im only bleedin  
  
Someone taps me on the shoulder every 5 minutes  
Nobody speaks English anymore  
Would anyone tell me if I was gettin stupider  
I hate you  
  
Talkin to myself  
You dont feel it after awhile  
You take the beating  
Im a swingin guy  
  
Throw a belt over the shower curtain rod  
And swing     
Toss me inside a hefty  
And put me in the ground  
  
A drink needs me  
I dont  
I aint about to guzzle no tears  
So kiss my ass  
  
Newscasters cockroaches and desserts  
I hate you  
Talkin to myself  
Everybodys starin at me  
  
Im only bleedin  
where are the kids

I think its time I had a talk with my kids  
Ill just tell em what my daddy told me  
YOU AINT NEVER GONNA AMOUNT TO NOTHIN
