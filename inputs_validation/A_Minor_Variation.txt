Some days I have to give right in to the blues  
Despite how I try to keep fightin  
Its a sure shot Im going to lose  
And Ill tell you why  
You think Im crazy  
Its such a sad composition  
But can you blame me  
For whats been causing my bad disposition  
Aint nothing new with my blue situation  
And nothings fine its just a minor variation  
When troubles want to find me I aint hard to find  
They know where I am  
Like a hungry pack of wolves when its feeding time  
They tear up a man  
And its a strange thing  
Cause now it dont really matter  
More of the same thing  
Dont even hurt its been part of the pattern  
But still in all its a small consulation  
I just define it as a minor variation  
Aint now way to fight em darling  
Aint no way around em baby  
Aint now way to take em honey  
Nowhere to hide and believe me Ive tried to shake em  
Im getting to the point where I dont feel the pain  
And Ive had enough  
Im ready for the next time it hits me again  
Cause Ive gotten tough  
It doesnt faze me  
And now Ive made my decision  
I may be crazy  
Its not as though I dont know that condition  
Until Im through with this blue situation  
Pass me the wine its just a minor variation  
Aint nobodys business baby  
Aint nobodys worry darlin  
Aint nobodys problem  
No way to win when youve already been forgotten  
And its a strange thing  
Cause now it dont really matter  
More of the same thing  
Dont even hurt its a part of the pattern  
Until Im through with this blue situation  
Pass me the wine its just a minor variation
