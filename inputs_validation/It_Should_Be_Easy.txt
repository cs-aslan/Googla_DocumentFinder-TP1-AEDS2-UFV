Ive been thinking  
Just sitting thinking  
On why I love you  
And all my reasons  
And if I lost you  
Boy if I lost you  
Id lose myself  
And I wouldnt feel the way I feel now  
  
You bring me sin  
Yes you bring me sin  
You make me feel like a million billion  
Ill let you in  
But dont you break my heart  
Dont you rip me apart  
No dont you rip me apart  
  
Baby love it should be easy  
It shouldnt be complicated  
It should be easy  
I dont know how else to say it  
  
You dont know how to  
  
Ive got visions  
Boy Ive got visions of me and you  
Happily just living  
Now go there out there  
Them beautiful men  
But you my future  
Baby you my right now  
If there was a scale from 1 to 10  
Then my love for you is a million billion  
Boy Ill love you till the day Im dead  
So please dont mess with my head  
Please dont mess with my head  
  
Baby love it should be easy  
It shouldnt be complicated  
It should be easy  
I dont know how else to say it  
  
You dont know how to  
  
La da di  
La di da  
Its the only way to love  
La da di  
La di da  
Its the only way to love To love  
  
I dont know how baby love it should be easy  
It shouldnt be complicated  
It should be easy  
I dont know how else to say it  
  
La da di  
La di da  
Its the only way to love  
La da di  
La di da  
  
You dont know how to
