You can tell everyone  
Love is over and done  
You can pack all your things and go  
  
You can lie to yourself  
And say that theres nothing left  
But theres something that I like you to know  
  
Its never really over  
Even though you say were through  
You may be holding me  
But cant you see  
Its not over if Im not over you  
  
Theres not much I can do  
If its over for you  
Ill just wish you the best  
When you leave  
But you played such a part  
In my life and in my heart  
Youll always be part of me  
  
Its never really over  
Even though you say were through  
You may be holding me  
But cant you see  
Its not over if Im not over you
