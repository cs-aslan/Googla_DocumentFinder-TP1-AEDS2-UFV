I keep playing it inside my head  
All that you said to me  
I lie awake just to convince myself  
This wasnt just a dream  
  
Cause you were right here  
And I shouldve taken the chance  
But I got so scared  
And I lost the moment again  
Its all that I can think about  
Oh youre all that I can think about  
  
Is your heart taken  
Is there somebody else on your mind  
Im so sorry Im so confused  
Just tell me am I out of time  
Is your heart breaking  
How do you feel about me now  
I cant believe I let you walk away when  
When I should have kissed you  
  
I should I should oh I should have kissed you  
I should I should oh I should have kissed you  
I should I should oh I should have kissed you  
I should I should oh I should have kissed you  
  
Every morning when I leave my house  
I always look for you  
Yeah I see you every time I close my eyes  
What am I gonna go  
  
And all my friends say that Im punching over my weight  
But in my eyes i saw how youre looking at me  
Its all that I can think about  
Oh youre all that I can think about  
  
Is your heart taken  
Is there somebody else on your mind  
Im so sorry Im so confused  
Just tell me am I out of time  
Is your heart breaking  
How do you feel about me now  
I cant believe I let you walk away when  
When I should have kissed you  
  
I should I should oh I should have kissed you  
I should I should oh I should have kissed you  
I should I should oh I should have kissed you  
I should I should oh I should have kissed you  
  
When you stood there just a heartbeat away  
When we were dancing and you looked up at me  
If I had known then that Id be feeling this way  
If I could replay I would never have let you go  
No oh never have let you go  
Am I out of time  
  
Is your heart taken  
Is there somebody else on your mind  
Im so sorry Im so confused  
Just tell me am I out of time  
Is your heart breaking  
How do you feel about me now  
I cant believe I let you walk away when  
When I should have kissed you  
  
I should I should oh I should have kissed you  
I should I should oh I should have kissed you  
I should I should oh I should have kissed you  
I should I should oh I should have kissed you  
I should have kissed you
