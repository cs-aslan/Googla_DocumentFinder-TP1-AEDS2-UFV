You can have a lolly pop  
A candy bar a jelly bean  
Ill buy you a rainbow to hang above your door  
  
Its pudding time  
  
Laughter is a sweet you cant put a price on  
When laughters all gone Daddy wont buy you more  
  
Its pudding time children  
  
Money money money to buy you things  
Daddys gonna buy you a diamond ring  
  
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall  
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall  
All kings horses and all the kings men  
Couldnt put Humpty together again  
  
San Franciso the striped bass are dying  
But youre gonna get that brand new bike  
  
Oh joy  
  
Its pudding time  
Its pudding time children  
  
Pudding time children
