Julianna be mine tonight  
The time has come girl and the feelings right  
Love forever not fade away  
A reborn love of yesterday  
  
I cant believe it this love Ive found  
The fevers rising I cant cool it down  
And just like the South Girl were gonna rise again  
Sharing a love that just wont end  
  
Ooo yeah all right  
Be my woman love me tonight  
Ive got a burning love Girl and you feel the same  
See the embers feel the flame  
  
I cant believe in this love Ive found  
The fevers rising I cant cool it down  
And just like the South Girl were gonna rise again  
Sharing a love that just wont end  
  
Ooo yeah all right  
Be my woman love me tonight  
Ive got a burning love Girl and you feel the same  
See the embers feel the flame  
See the embers feel the flame  
  
Ooo yeah all right
