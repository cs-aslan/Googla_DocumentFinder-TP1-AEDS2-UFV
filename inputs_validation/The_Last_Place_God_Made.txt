Ive seen the best of times  
Ive seen the worst of times  
Been around and Ive taken my chances  
But I could never be tied down  
Too many questions not enough answers  
  
Then I laid eyes on you  
I knew right there and then  
This would be more than a passing encounter  
My fate is bound to yours  
Ive found a cause right here  
  
And if this is the last place God made  
And yours is the last face I see  
Just feeling close to you  
Thats good enough for me  
  
Weve seen the best of times  
Weve seen the worst of times  
Been through hell and high water together  
Diamond bright and tear stained memries  
These are the times Ill remember forever  
  
If you believe in me like I believe in you  
Without a care for the why or the wherefore  
I will be there for you  
And youll be there for me  
  
And If this is the last place God made  
And yours is the last face I see  
Just feeling close to you  
Its good enough for me  
  
If this is the last place God made  
You know its the only place I want to be  
Just feeling close to you  
Thats good enough for me  
  
If this is the last place God made  
You know its the only place I want to be  
Just feeling close to you  
Its good enough for me
