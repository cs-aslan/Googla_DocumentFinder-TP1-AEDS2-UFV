Sunday  
Sick o my tears  
Monday morning  
I couldve felt much better  
  
Tuesday  
Youre in my way  
I wish you would type my heart a letter  
  
Place your love  
In my world  
Its for you  
Its made for you  
I need time  
A lot o time  
To get you off my mind  
To get you off my mind  
  
Wednesday  
Nuthins OK  
Thursday afternoon  
I wish I was sleepin  
  
Friday and Saturday sun  
Gettin up early but I cant get nuthin done  
  
Place your love  
In my world  
Its for you  
Its all made for you  
I need time  
A lot o time  
To get you off my mind  
To get you off my mind  
  
Maybe youll come here  
Maybe youll disappear  
Maybe the clouds I fear will turn to flowers in the air  
These cool vibrations  
Theyre hitting me all the time  
Youve got me diggin and divin in the garden of my mind  
  
Its a high  
To watch you fly  
Across the sky  
All the time  
To watch you all the time
