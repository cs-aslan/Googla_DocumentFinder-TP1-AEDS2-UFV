Let the dishes wait no need in dusting  
No reason to clean the dirty floor  
Cause Im sure it doesnt matter  
Now that he has gone away  
I have no plans for the future cause hes not here today  
Let them go to the park and Ill sit alone here in the dark  
No joy left in my heart anymore  
Let me hold on to my memories  
And if I die this way just let it be  
I have no plans for the future cause hes not here with me  
Why should I comb my head  
When I know Im not going anywhere  
Why should I keep right on giving  
When Ive lost my only reason for living  
So go on just go on and have yourself a ball  
I have no plans for the future cause hes not here  
I have no plans for the future cause hes not here at all
