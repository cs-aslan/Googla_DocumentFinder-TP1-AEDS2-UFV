Almost there were almost there  
How wonderful wonderful our love will be  
For you for me  
  
Were almost there where we will share  
A warm caress tenderness a dream come true  
For me for you  
  
Love has waited such a long time  
Now were a kiss apart  
Darling this is the right time  
To let the kisses start  
  
For youre almost mine and soon well find  
Our paradise paradise so rare  
Close your eyes for were almost there  
  
Youre almost mine and soon well find  
Our paradise paradise so rare  
Close your eyes close your eyes  
Close your eyes for were almost there  
Almost there  
Almost there
