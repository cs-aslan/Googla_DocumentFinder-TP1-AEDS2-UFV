Change the mood Im in  
For a little while  
Let me see that grin  
Let me see you smile  
  
No soulful tales that fret and frown  
No woeful wails that get me down  
No rights or wrongs  
Sing no sad songs for me  
  
I only want to laugh  
No time for crying  
I only want to laugh  
No time for tears  
  
I only want to sing  
A song thats happy  
Thats why I only want to walk a street thats sunny  
I only want to see the side thats funny  
  
Im saving all of my tears until tomorrow  
Cause crying all my tears  
Just aint my style  
Im acting like a clown  
But let me be  
Cause even though I know  
The jokes on me  
I only want to laugh  
Only want to laugh  
Only want to laugh  
  
Im saving all of my tears until tomorrow  
Cause crying all my tears  
Baby just aint my style  
Im acting like a clown  
But let me be  
Cause even though the jokes on me oh  
Tell the girls goodbye  
Cause I dont want to cry  
Hey  
I only want to laugh  
Only want to laugh  
Only want to laugh
