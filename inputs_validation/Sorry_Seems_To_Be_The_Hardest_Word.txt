What have I got to do to make you love me  
What have I got to do to make you care  
What do I do when lightning strikes me  
And I wake to find that youre not there  
  
What do I do to make you want me  
What have I got to do to be heard  
What do I say when its all over  
And sorry seems to be the hardest word  
  
Its sad so sad  
Its a sad sad situation  
And its getting more and more absurd  
Its sad so sad  
Why cant we talk it over  
Oh it seems to me  
That sorry seems to be the hardest word  
  
What do I do to make you love me  
What have I got to do to be heard  
What do I do when lightning strikes me  
What have I got to do  
What have I got to do  
When sorry seems to be the hardest word
