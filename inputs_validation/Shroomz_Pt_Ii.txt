Everlast  
Oh this tastes like shit  
Oh thats awful  
  
Xzibit  
Whitey Ford takes the flows yall  
See Im about to have the time of my life Bacardi on ice  
Live from Los Angeles its Saturday night  
While others staty tight were looking for some parties to crash  
I never bounce rock and splash without my Alkaholik stash  
I scooped the homie Tash introduce me to Everlast  
He know where the bitches move fast so we can have a blast  
  
Everlast Xzibit  
I think you know my man Sadat from the Nubian crew  
And I can see youre rolling tight with the Likwit too yeah  
I make room for every crew whose beats be booming  
I know you puffing some weed but are you down with some shrooming  
Shrooming hell nah thats what the white boys be doing  
I got room in the jeep we can mash a few down  
Eat a few bags of shit and we could mash up a town  
See I know this spot where them things will be hot  
We guarantee at least two chickens up in every pot  
So whatcha want whatcha got ay yo eat some of these  
And thrust us all up youll be cool like a breeze  
  
Xzibit Everlast  
Brought me back some orange juice two vitamin Cs  
And the look on my face look like a painful disease  
They tasted awful but by that time I had a jawful  
Just chill ten minutes and its all downhill  
Downhill how does it feel how long does it take to work  
Am I gonna fry my disk does it make my stomach hurt  
Captain Kirk pulled into the night club parking lot  
The line was aroudn the block hurry up and find a spot  
Straight to the bar drinking hennessey and orange juice  
I gotta be trippin that bitch just melted through the floor  
  
Everlast Xzibit  
Yo either Im high or I think that Im dreaming  
Dont take this shot wrong but X you look like a demon what  
And I might start scremaing I think I might puke yeah  
Cause I just heard a voice saying use the voice Luke what the fuck  
  
Xzibit  
Brothers and sisters walking by that I recognize  
Feeling hypnotized Peoples Dilated changing sides  
To my surprise we didnt even have to scrap tonight  
Higher than kites staring at lights this a other type of high  
  
Everlast  
My mouth was dry I forgot how to breathe  
And I just saw some shit that you wouldnt believe  
With this bomb baby palm aint no tricks up my sleeve  
Let me slide up in this mix get some chicks and well leave  
  
Xzibit  
We be stumblin straight from the bar straight to the car  
Feeling like my feet getting stuck to the street  
Went to my house smokin trees playing video games  
Everlast a couple of homies a couple of days  
  
Everlast  
It was me X and Tash we was smokin a J  
With this girl named Michelle and her friend Chantay  
Pumpin Straight Outta Compton by NWA  
Am I talking out loud or just thinkin this way  
  
Xzibit  
Damn I cant find my keys chickens ready to leave  
Theyre ready to bounce yo I think we smoked the whole ounce  
Im roaming the house finding my words hard to pronounce  
Talking to myself see Mariah Gage on the shelf  
For everything stays deep I shoulda known all the cases  
Twentyfive lightnings is what Xzibit is facin  
If somebody catch a slug at my house  
Thats the last time I ever put some stupid ass drugs in my mouth  
Pulled a fifty unloaded the gage at least I thought so  
Except I kept one in the chamber for Vinnie  
Thats what I forgot thats what I lost  
When I pointed the barrel at the floor and the gauge went off
