I remember every touch  
Every flower  
Every word you ever said  
I remember how we looked at each other  
The very first time we met  
Ill never forget  
  
I remember every smile  
Every letter  
Every kiss you gave to me  
How wed talk and youd hold me for hours  
Until Id fall fast asleep  
You said you would always be there  
Should I need your arms around me  
But now that Ive fallen to my knees  
I dont think you give a damn about me  
  
And it feels like  
Were running out of time  
And it feels like  
Im the last thing on your mind  
Oh  
I can touch your skin  
I can hear you breathe  
Baby will you tell me whats wrong  
Cause it feels like youre already gone  
  
Did you leave in the middle of the night  
And forget to say goodbye  
Did you feel it was time to go  
But you didnt wanna see me cry  
It gets harder and harder  
For me to believe  
That you still love me  
So get on with it baby if youre gonna leave  
Its not worth saving  
  
And it feels like  
Were running out of time  
And it feels like  
Im the last thing on your mind  
Oh  
I can touch your skin  
I can hear you breathe  
Baby will you tell me whats wrong  
Cause it feels like youre already gone  
  
My heart is telling me its too late  
To beg you to stay  
You wouldnt hear me anyway  
Yeah  
  
And it feels like  
Were running out of time  
And it feels like  
Im the last thing on your mind  
Oh  
I can touch your skin  
I can hear you breathe  
Baby will you tell me whats wrong  
Cause it feels like youre already gone  
  
Youre already gone  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Cause it feels like  
Youre so gone
