If youre gonna rip my heart out  
Could you use a knife thats dull and rust in color  
Once I die there will be no way that you can cover that scar  
Its hard I know  
  
And if I get a little blood on you  
Finally the world will know youre guilty  
Know youre wrong  
Of taking everything youve gotten from me no heart  
Its hard I know  
  
Chorus  
Mighty King of Avondale  
I just cant let this go  
Real life aint no fairy tale  
I just thought you should know  
  
When youre finished with the surgery  
I really hope that you will turn to me  
And tell me all about the fun you had  
When you were cutting up you were cutting up  
  
Chorus  
Mighty King of Avondale  
I just cant let this go  
Real life aint no fairy tale  
I just thought you should know  
  
Living like a fairy tale  
The mighty King of Avondale  
It all went to his head this royalty  
I stuck a knife into his back  
Inventiveness is what I lack  
Hes always hanging up on loyalty  
  
Chorus  
Mighty King of Avondale  
I just cant let this go  
Real life aint no fairy tale  
I just thought you should know
