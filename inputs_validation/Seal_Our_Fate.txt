Hey hey  
They say its never too late and though  
That might be the case sometimes  
Sad truth of it is opportunity wont knock twice  
Put off until tomorrow but tomorrow might never come  
Gotta think about the future today soon will be long gone  
Where will you be a few years down the line  
Will it be everything youve dreamed of  
Everything youve dreamed of  
Always harder to do what is right  
Sometimes one bad decision can mess up your life  
Seal our fate with the choices we make  
But dont give a second thought to all the chances we take  
Could come up anytime better be wide awake  
Cause we seal our fate with the choices we make  
Seal our fate we seal our fate  
Seal our fate seal our fate with the choices we make  
Surely you say its not as bad as you make it sound  
If we make a mistake we can always turn it back around  
Turn it back around  
Get back on the straight narrow when Im through having all my fun  
After all its my decision Im not really hurting anyone  
Before you know its gotten way out of hand  
In a ways that you had never dreamed of  
You had never dreamed of  
Never worth the price you pay in the end  
Instead of being ahead started over again  
Seal our fate with the choices we make  
Dont give a second thought to the chances we take  
Could come up anytime better be wide awake  
Cause we seal our fate with the choices we make  
Seal our fate yes we seal our fate  
We seal our fate seal our fate with the choices we make
