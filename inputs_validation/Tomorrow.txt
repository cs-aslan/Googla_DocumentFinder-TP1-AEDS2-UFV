These endless days are wait for me  
Tearing my heart that breaks for you  
Im coming home tomorrow  
  
Though youre not lying next to me  
I hear your song that calls to me  
Im coming home tomorrow  
Back in your arms  
  
Tomorrows just a dream I cant detain  
Its like a fall I cant contain  
And though it seems so far away  
Its just a day a lonely day away  
  
The summers gone and I can see  
The seasons end is set me free  
Im coming home tomorrow  
Back in your arms  
  
Tomorrows just a dream I cant detain  
Its like a fall I cant contain  
And though it seems so far away  
Its just a day  
A lonely day away  
  
Tomorrow Im coming home  
Tomorrow Im coming home  
Im so tired and so alone  
  
Its like a dream I cant detain  
Its like a fall I cant contain  
And though it seems so far away  
Its just a day  
A lonely day away
