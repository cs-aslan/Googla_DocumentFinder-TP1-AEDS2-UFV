I can learn to resist  
Anything but temptation  
I can learn to coexist  
With anything but pain  
  
I can learn to compromise  
Anything but my desires  
I can learn to get along  
With all the things I cant explain  
  
I can learn to resist  
Anything but frustration  
I can learn to persist  
With anything but aiming low  
  
I can learn to close my eyes  
To anything but injustice  
I can learn to get along  
With all the things I dont know  
  
You can surrender  
Without a prayer  
But never really pray  
Pray without surrender  
  
You can fight  
Without ever winning  
But never ever win  
Without a fight
