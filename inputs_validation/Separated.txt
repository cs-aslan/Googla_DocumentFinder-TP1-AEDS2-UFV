Oh no no no no  
  
If love was a bird then we wouldnt have wings  
If love was a sky wed be blue  
If love was a choir you and I could never sing  
Cause love isnt for me and you  
If love was an Oscar you and I could never win  
Cause we could never act out our parts  
If love is the bible then we are lost in sin  
Cause its not in our hearts  
  
So why dont you go your way  
And Ill go mine  
Live your life  
And Ill live mine  
Baby youll do well  
And Ill be fine  
Cause were better off separated  
  
If love was a fire then we have lost the spark  
Love never felt so cold  
If love was the light then were lost in the dark  
Left with no one to hold  
If love was a sport were not on the same team  
You and i are destined to lose  
If love was an ocean then we are just a stream  
Cause love isnt for me and you  
  
Why dont you go your way  
And Ill go mine  
Live your life  
And Ill live mine  
Baby youll do well  
And Ill be fine  
Cause were better off separated  
  
Girl I know we had some good times  
Its sad but now we gotta say goodbye  
Girl you know I love you I cant deny  
Cant say we didnt try to make it work for you and I  
I know it hurts so much but its best for us  
Somewhere along this winding road we lost the trust  
So Ill walk away so you dont have to see me cry  
Its killing me so why dont you go  
  
Why dont you go your way oh  
And Ill go mine baby  
Live your life oh  
And Ill live mine Ill live mine  
Baby youll do well Ill be fine  
And Ill be fine  
Cause were better off so much better off  
  
Go your way Go your way  
And Ill go mine Ill go mine  
Live your life Your life  
Ill live mine  
Youll do well ohh hoo  
And Ill be fine  
  
Cause were better off so much better off  
So much better off  
Separated  
  
Im sorry we didnt make it
