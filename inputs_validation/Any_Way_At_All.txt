Ooo  
Hey baby  
Ooo  
  
We never know  
Where the winds of love will carry  
Our hearts unfold  
Into the hands of time  
  
Nothing will ever change  
This love we share  
No matter what it takes  
I will be there  
  
When the sun goes high  
You pray for clouds to break  
Reach up to the sky and pray for it to rain  
When the times get hard you rely on your faith  
Well be together  
If theres any way at all  
It theres any way at all  
  
Dont be afraid  
Cause were in this love together  
Well ride the waves  
Til we reach the other side  
  
Your love is life to me  
None can compare  
Not as I live and breath  
I will be there  
  
When the sun goes high  
You pray for clouds to break  
Reach up to the sky and pray for it to rain  
When the times get hard you rely on your faith  
You know that well be together  
If theres any way at all  
If theres any way  
If theres any way at all  
  
If theres any way at all  
Well be together baby  
If theres any way at all  
Well be together forever and ever  
  
Reach up to the sky and pray for it to rain  
Oh baby  
When the times get hard you rely on your faith  
Well be together  
If theres any way at all  
If theres any way  
If theres any way at all  
Ooo
