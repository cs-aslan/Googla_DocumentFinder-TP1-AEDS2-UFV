I wonder if you think of me  
Somewhere in the shadows of your mind ooooo  
Although our love could never be  
I find I think about you all the time mmm baby  
  
Am I in your fantasies  
The way you always wander into mine ooooo  
And are you longing endlessly  
Just like me deep inside oh baby baby  
  
When the nights are dark and cold  
Do you think of me Do you think of me  
And when youre lying all alone  
Do you think of me Do you think of me  
When you feel the touch of another love  
Do you think of me Do you think of me  
Am I the one youre dreaming of  
Do you think of me Do you think of me  
  
oooo I picture you embracing me  
We drift away and leave the world behind baby  
But its only makebelieve  
Love can be so unkind oh baby baby baby  
  
When the nights are dark and cold ooo  
Do you think of me Do you think of me  
And when youre lying all alone ooo baby  
Do you think of me Do you think of me  
When you feel the touch of another love
