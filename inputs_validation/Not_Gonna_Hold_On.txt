Cant you see we were meant to be oh baby  
Down for each other for eternity oh baby baby  
Let me know if youre out of my life  
Dont hang on Dont hang on to my heart and say byebye  
I used to be the one that you could call on  
Now you like to play around hit me up on what went wrong  
  
Chorus  
Im not gonna hold on to your love baby  
If chances are that Im gonna fall off Repeat x2  
  
Memories like the corner of my mind  
You know just what to do to make my love come down  
I know just what you need but you dont come around  
Let me know if youre out of my life  
Dont hang on to my heart say byebye oh baby  
I used to be the one that you could call on  
Now you like to play around  hit me up on what went wrong  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Im not gonna hold on to your lovin baby  
Look at what youre doing to me baby Repeat x2
