I dont want to cry  
I dont want to say goodbye  
But I will if you wont fight for our love  
It takes more than sayin I love you  
We need more than words to get us through  
I need to feel that you will fight for our love  
We have a history a passionate story  
But lately were more strangers than friends  
All through the ages  
Love really worth savin has been battered and scarred  
But it strengthened the heart and thats who you win the end  
I just want to hold you close to me  
How I miss the way we used to be  
Dont let it die lets you and I fight for our love  
Oh all through the ages  
Love really worth savin has been battered and scarred  
But it strengthened the heart and thats who you win the end  
I just want to hold you close to me  
How I miss the way we used to be  
Dont let it die lets you and I fight for our love  
Dont let it die lets you and I fight for our love
