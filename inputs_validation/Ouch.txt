Lets lets play pretend  
Like youre my friend  
And everything is OK  
  
Then we shall begin  
To put an end  
To all the games that we play  
  
My bodys a temple  
Ill choose who worships it  
Lets keep it simple  
No need for a big deal  
  
So if youre ready  
Just call me on the phone  
Ill be here waiting  
No need to be alone  
  
Ouch your heart youre burning me up  
Please dont stop youre making me blush  
Ouch my God you hit my spot  
I just cant get enough of you of you of you of you  
  
So say how youve you been  
Hows your girlfriend  
Its funny youre here with me  
  
When youre still with her  
And I do prefer  
That we dont feel guilty
