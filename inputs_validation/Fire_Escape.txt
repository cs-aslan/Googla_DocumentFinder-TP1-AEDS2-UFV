Well I dont wanna be President Superman or Clark Kent  
I dont wanna walk around in their shoes  
Cause I dont know whose side Im on  
I dont know my right from wrong  
I dont know where Im goin to  
I dont know about you  
Ill be the rain falling on your fire escape  
And I may not be the man you want me to  
I can be myself how bout you  
I dont wanna make you mad  
I dont wanna meet your dad  
I dont wanna be your dream come true  
Cause I dont know just what Ive found  
I dont know my sky from ground  
I dont know where Im goin toI dont know about you  
Ill be the rain falling on your fire escape  
And I may not be the man you want me to  
I can be myself how bout you  
Ill be the rain falling on your fire escape  
And I may not be the man you want me to  
I can be myself how bout you  
I can be myself how bout you  
I can be myself how bout you
