Take cover young lovers  
Fall apart at the seams  
Its stainless steel thats how I feel  
Youre the girl of my dreams  
  
Well I tried to call you on the phone  
Your dad said that you werent at home  
  
But we are picking up the pieces of our lovin  
Over and over again  
Picking up the pieces lets do it again  
Were picking up the pieces  
Picking up the pieces of our love  
  
Well I need your lovin  
To show me what I am  
And I want your body  
To make me feel like a man  
  
You know that Im down on my knees  
You know its you that I want to please please  
  
Picking up the pieces of our lovin  
Over and over again  
Picking up the pieces lets do it again  
Were picking up the pieces  
Picking up the pieces of our love
