Ooh  
Woohooo  
  
Yeah  
  
When people talk of love  
Ill lead the conversation  
Ill say I feel just fine  
Happy with my situation  
  
But when I look away ha  
People know my mind is straying  
To where I once belonged  
Dreaming about your heart again  
  
your heart again  
Yeh  
your heart again  
Let me in your heart again  
  
Listen to me honey  
  
We laugh to face the blues  
I give your satisfaction  
its your heart again  
Despair was on your mind  
I gave you the right direction  
its your heart again  
  
Sometimes you walk away  
Remember its my heart your breaking  
You forget we were in love  
Now my heart is only filled with pain  
your heart again  
Oh  
your heart again  
Let me in your heart again  
  
Oh my love  
I want you to stay  
Dont leave me now  
Or I just fade away  
All my love  
Dont hurt me this way  
  
Oh  
Forgive me babe  
Do not ever tell me goodbye  
Woohoo  
Tell me yes  
  
Oh  
  
Dont let me wait too long  
Or Ill lose my mind  
  
When people talk of love  
I have no hesitation  
its your heart again  
Tell me what your dreaming of  
Ill hold that conversation for you best  
its your heart again  
  
But when I look away ha  
People know my mind is straying  
Baby to where I once belonged  
Just let me in your heart again  
You heart again  
your heart again  
Oh  
Let me in your heart again  
  
Open the doors for me babe  
To your heart again  
Let me in  
  
Hey live  
Let me live  
Woohoo  
Let me live and live in your heart again
