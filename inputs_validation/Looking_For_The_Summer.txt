Look deep into the April face  
A change is clearly taking place  
Looking for the summer  
  
The eyes take on a certain gaze  
And leave behind the springtime days  
Go looking for the summer  
  
This aint no game of kiss and tell  
The implications how you knew so well  
Go looking for the summer  
  
The time has come and they must go  
To play the passion out that haunts you so  
Looking for the summer  
  
Remember love how it was the same  
We scratched and hurt each others growing pains  
We were looking for the summer  
  
And still I stand this very day  
With a burning wish to fly away  
Im still looking looking for the summer
