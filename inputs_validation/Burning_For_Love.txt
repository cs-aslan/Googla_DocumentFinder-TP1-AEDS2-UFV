Ive been lied to you been cheated  
Ive been cried to you been mistreated  
Ive been watching you you want action  
You need love and I need satisfaction  
  
Chorus  
Im burning for love  
Filled with desire  
I cant stand the heat  
My hearts on fire  
I cant get enough  
Its down to the wire  
Making my move Im looking for you  
Im burning for love  
  
Youre the victim its in your eyes  
Im the suspect and loves the crime  
Tensions mounting bodies shaking  
I cant take the anticipation  
  
Chorus  
  
Now that I got you in my sight  
Cant take another sleepless night  
Oh no no  
You can run but you cant hide  
Youre the only one I need  
To feel the fire inside  
  
Chorus
