Your cheatin heart  
Will make you weep  
Youll cry and cry  
And try to sleep  
But sleep wont come  
The whole night through  
Your cheatin heart  
Will tell on you  
  
When tears come down  
Like falling rain  
Youll toss around  
And call my name  
Youll walk the floor  
The way I do  
Your cheatin heart  
Will tell on you  
  
Your cheatin heart  
Will pine some day  
And crave the love  
You threw away  
The time will come  
When youll be blue  
Your cheatin heart  
Will tell on you  
  
When tears come down  
Like falling rain  
Youll toss around  
And call my name  
Youll walk the floor  
The way I do  
Your cheatin heart  
Will tell on you
