Torn from the heavens they fall from the sky  
And walk the streets among mortal men  
They hide in shadows  
Keepers of the night  
  
Mortal life is weak  
Cant hold back the demons  
The blood pours as rain  
And soon youll be alone  
  
Descending angel  
Stand by my side  
Well face the night  
Descending angel  
  
We guard the gates of hell just one more night  
For in the morning will bring the light  
  
Born and created in the image of a god  
The heavens fall no savior has been sent  
No one to guide us  
Alone we face the night  
  
Mortal life is brief for the rebel angels  
They make their final stand  
  
And soon youll be alone  
Descending angel  
Stand by my side  
And face the night  
  
Descending angel  
Well guard the gates of hell just one more night  
Forever ends tonight
