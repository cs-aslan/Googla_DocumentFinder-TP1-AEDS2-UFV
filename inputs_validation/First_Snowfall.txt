Oh the first snowfall of the winter  
  
Was a day that we all waited for  
  
When it drifted to and frost  
  
Why you shouldve seen the snow  
  
It was near seven feet or more  
  
By the old barn door  
  
  
  
Oh the first snowfall of the winter  
  
What a joy for a boy to behold  
  
In each house youll find a sleigh  
  
That was waiting for this day  
  
And of course down the road a hill  
  
For each Jack and Jill  
  
  
  
Every winter breeze that scurries  
  
Sets the snowflakes up in flurries  
  
Its the good old sentimental season when  
  
Folks put runners on their surreys  
  
And forget about their worries  
  
When a man becomes a boy once again  
  
  
  
Oh the first snowfall of the winter  
  
Jingle bells bring us spells ever dear  
  
Under wintry skies of gray  
  
It was snowing all the day  
  
And it showed no signs of stopping  
  
Every kid with eyes of popping  
  
Will soon be bellywhopping on his ear  
  
  
  
On the first snowfall of the winter  
  
Oh the first snowfall of the year  
  
The first snow of the year  
  
Is just about the best snow  
  
Well Ill say any snow  
  
Is a pretty good show
