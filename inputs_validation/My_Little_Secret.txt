Did anybody see you coming to my house last night  
When I got your message on my beeper  
That you wanna do everything I like  
Alright alright  
  
I like being in the same room as you and your girlfriend  
The fact that she dont know  
That really turns me on  
Shell never guess in a million years  
That weve got this thing going on  
  
Youre my little secret  
And thats how we should keep it  
Its on everybodys mind about you and I  
They think so but they dont really know  
Or wanna know that  
Youre my little secret  
And thats how we should keep it  
We should never let em know  
Never let it show  
If you know like I know  
We should never let it go  
  
If anybody knew that it was you and your house  
That I was creepin to all the time  
Id probably still do it  
Cause I find it hard to keep you off of my mind

Everybody cheats  
But you gotta know how you gotta know when  
You gotta know why my infatuation with you  
Is taking me on an emotional high  
Im caught all up in this love affair baby  
Speculation will bring us stares  
All my friends are talking about it  
Still the truth I cant reveal  
  
Youre my little secret  
And thats how we should keep it  
Its on everybodys mind about you and I  
They think so but they dont really know

As long as Im right here  
You aint never gonna be by yourself  
Cause the love that we share  
It stays on my mind  
Youre always gonna be a little secret of mine
