Oh tell me mama  
Whos that while ago  
Oh tell me mama  
Whos that while ago  
Yes when I come in  
Who went out that back door  
Now dont come here mama  
Im gonna start a ragin stand  
You been out boogiewoogien  
Theres somethin I dont understand  
I want you to tell me mama  
Whos that while ago  
Yes when I come in  
Who went out that back door  
Now this is somethin  
I never seen before  
A man is gettin my money  
Always slammin my back door  
I want you to tell me mama  
Whos that while ago  
Yes when I came in  
Who went out that back door  
Oh I had to wanna kneel down  
You couldnt give the truth  
His hat in his hand  
And his overcoat too  
I want you to tell me mama  
Why cant you be true  
Yes when I came in  
Who went out that back door  
He came by me runnin  
Smellin like a whiskey can  
My hat in his hand  
And my overcoat too  
I want you to tell me mama  
Whos that while ago  
Yes when I came in  
Who went out that back door
