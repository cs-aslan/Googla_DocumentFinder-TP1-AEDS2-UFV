Come they told me parum pum pum pum  
A newborn King to see parum pum pum pum  
Our finest gifts we bring parum pum pum pum  
To lay before the King  
So to honor Him parum pum pum pum  
when we come  
  
Little Baby parum pum pum pum  
I am a poor boy too parum pum pum pum  
I have no gift to bring parum pum pum pum  
thats fit to give our King  
Shall I play for You parum pum pum pum  
On my drum  
  
Mary nodded parum pum pum pum  
The ox and lamb kept time parum pum pum pum  
I played my drum for Him parum pum pum pum  
I played my best for Him  
Then He smiled at me parum pum pum pum  
Me and my drum
