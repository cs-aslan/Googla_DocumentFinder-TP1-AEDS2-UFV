Alone in a room  
Its just me and you  
I feel so lost  
Cause I dont know what to do  
Now what if choose the wrong thing to do  
Im so afraid afraid of disappointing you  
  
So I need to talk to you  
And ask you for your guidance  
Especially today  
When my world seems cloudy  
Guide me until Im sure  
I open up my heart  
  
My hopes and dreams  
Are fading fast  
Im all burned out  
And I dont think my strengths gonna last  
So Im crying out  
Crying out to you  
Lord I know that youre the only one  
Who is able to pull me through  
  
So I need to talk to you  
And ask you for your guidance  
Especially today  
When my world seems cloudy  
Guide me until Im sure  
I open up my heart  
  
So show me how  
To do things your way  
Dont let me make the same mistakes  
Over and over again  
Your will be done  
And Ill be the one  
To make sure the its carried out  
And in me I dont want any doubt  
Thats why  
  
I need to talk to you  
And ask you for your guidance  
Especially today  
When my life is a little bit cloudy  
Guide me until Im sure  
I open up my heart  
  
All I need to do  
Is hear a single word from you  
I open up my heart  
Just one word could make  
A difference in what I do Lord  
I open my heart to you  
  
Youre the lover of my soul  
Captain of my sea  
I need a word from you  
Thats why I open up my heart
