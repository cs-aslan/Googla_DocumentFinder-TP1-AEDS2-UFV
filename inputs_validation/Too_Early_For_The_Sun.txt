I have never known a love like this  
Before in my life  
Tears can turn into bliss  
With only a kiss only a kiss  
  
And I have never held a girl  
Like you so close in my arms  
You appeared in my world  
And offered me hope for one more time  
  
Ive never been so afraid  
That love is just a dream  
Darling Ill awake and youll be gone  
Never believe that Ill love somebody  
Ill love somebody someone like you  
Ill love somebody I could love somebody  
  
Youre too early for the sun  
Too early for the moon  
Too early for the rain  
Coming down on me  
You make me feel so close to home  
So far away like nowhere else Ive never been  
  
Youre too early for the stars  
Too early for the wind  
Too early for my heart  
To open up again  
  
But when I see you I just laugh  
And I believe Im right where Im supposed to be  
  
I have never known a life like this  
Except in my dreams  
One kiss and I was renewed  
Now Im alive I have survived  
  
I have never loved a girl  
Like you except in my dreams  
All my songs are for you  
I finally see my dreams come true  
  
Ive never been so afraid  
That love is just a dream  
Darling Ill awake and youll be gone  
Never believe that Ill love somebody  
Ill love somebody someone like you  
Ill love somebody I could love somebody  
  
Youre too early for the sun  
Too early for the moon  
Too early for the rain  
Coming down on you  
You make me feel so close to home  
So far away like nowhere else Ive never been  
  
Youre just too early for the stars  
Too early for the wind  
Too early for my heart  
To open up again  
  
But when I see you I just laugh  
And I believe Im right where Im supposed to be  
  
Ooh Darling welcome to the wind  
As we sail our ship of dreams into uncharted waters  
Forget about the stars and love will lead you higher  
So girl lets ride the wind  
  
Surrender to the sun  
Surrender to the moon  
Surrender to the rain  
Surrender to the stars  
Surrender to your heart  
Surrender to the wind  
Take a chance  
Open up let me love again  
  
Surrender to the sun  
Surrender to the moon  
Surrender to the rain  
Surrender to the stars  
Surrender to your fears  
Surrender to your tears  
Take a chance  
Open up let me love again
