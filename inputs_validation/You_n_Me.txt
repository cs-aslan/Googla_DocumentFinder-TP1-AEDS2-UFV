Well its five in the morning  
When will you be home  
Im tired of waiting here baby  
All on my own  
All I got for comfort is some cheap red wine  
But the thought of what youre doing gives me no peace of mind  
  
You n me its got to be just you n me  
Cant you see baby  
Cant you see what youre doing to me  
  
I know those page three girls  
In the playboy books  
Aint got nothing on you  
In the way that you look  
But an eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth  
When you get home  
You better give me some truth  
  
Tell me no lies  
When I ask you the questions  
Tell the truth  
Your lies aint gonna make it no more  
Tell me no lies  
Baby youre no exception to the rule  
Because Ive heard it all before  
And babe believe me I never forget  
  
You n me baby baby  
Just you n me  
Cant you see baby  
If you dont stop what youre doing to me  
Im gonna do it to you  
  
Tell me no lies  
When I ask you the questions  
Tell the truth  
Your lies aint gonna make it no more  
Tell me no lies  
Baby youre no exception to the rule  
Because Ive heard it all before  
And babe believe me I never forget  
  
You n me baby baby  
Just you n me  
Cant you see baby  
Cant you see what youre doing to me  
  
You n me baby baby  
Just you n me  
Cant you see baby  
If you dont stop what youre doing to me  
Im gonna do it to you
