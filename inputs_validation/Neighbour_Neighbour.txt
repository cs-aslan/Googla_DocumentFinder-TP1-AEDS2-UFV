Youre so unrespecting  
Youre interfering with my life  
  
Day and night all the time leave me alone  
  
Neighbour neighbour dont you worry what goes on in my home  
Youre always looking for something to gossip about  
You run around from door to door  
Rollin your mouth about things you dont know  
Neighbour neighbour dont you worry what goes on in my home  
Just leave me alone  
  
Neighbour neighbour dont worry how I treat my wife  
You tell everybody we fuss and fight every night well it aint right  
Youve got your troubles my troubles too  
Something bads gonna happen to you  
Neighbour neighbour dont worry what goes on in my home  
Just leave me alone  
  
Day and night all the time yeah  
  
Neighbour neighbour dont worry who knocks on my front door  
Walking and talking and pacing all over the floor  
Peeping sleeping through the hall  
Keeping your big ears glued to my wall  
Neighbour neighbour dont worry what goes on in my home  
You know its true  
  
Youre interfering with my life leave me alone neighbour  
Leave me alone you go your way and Ill go mine  
  
Youre so unrespecting
