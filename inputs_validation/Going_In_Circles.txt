Im an ever rolling wheel  
Without a destination real  
And Im an ever spinning top  
Whirling around till I drop  
  
1  Oh but what am I to do  
My mind is in a whirlpool  
Give me a little hope  
One small thing to cling to  
  
2  You got me going in circles  
Oh around and around I go  
Going in circles  
Oh around and around I go  
Im strung out over you  
  
Im a faceless clock  
With timeless hopes that never stop  
When I feel that way  
You know my souls at stake  
  
Repeat 1  
Repeat 2  
Im strung out over you I need you baby  
Uuh I need I need you baby  
Call me I need you baby  
I need baby my baby my baby  
My baby my baby girl  
  
Ad lib until fade
