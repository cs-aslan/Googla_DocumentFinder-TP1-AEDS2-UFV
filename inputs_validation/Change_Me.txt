Girl Im ready if youre ready now  
Ooh as Im ever gonna be  
If youre with it then Im with it now  
To accept all the responsibility  
Id go outta my way  
To live by the words that you say  
I dont wanna be the same  
  
Maybe you could change me  
Maybe you could change me  
Maybe you could be the light  
That opens up my eyes  
Make all my wrongs right  
Change me change me  
  
Dont fight fire with fire  
If Im screaming talk quieter  
Understanding and patience  
Feel the pain that Im facing  
Be like serenity help reposition my mind  
Take a chance make a difference in my life  
  
Maybe you could change me  
Maybe you could change me  
Maybe you could be the light  
That opens up my eyes  
Make all my wrongs right  
Change me change me  
  
Girl Im ready if youre ready now  
Ooh as Im ever gonna be  
If youre with it then Im with it now
