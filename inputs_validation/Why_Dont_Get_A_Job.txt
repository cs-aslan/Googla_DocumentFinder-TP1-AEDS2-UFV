My friends got a girlfriend  
Man he hates that bitch  
He tells me every day  
He says man I really gotta lose my chick  
In the worst kind of way  
  
She sits on her ass  
He works his hands to the bone  
To give her money every payday  
But she wants more dinero just to stay at home  
Well my friend  
You gotta say  
  
I wont pay I wont pay ya no way  
Nana Why dont you get a job  
Say no way say no way ya no way  
Nana why dont you get a job  
  
I guess all his money well it isnt enough  
To keep her bill collectors at bay  
I guess all his money well it isnt enough  
Cause that girls got expensive taste  
  
I wont pay I wont pay ya no way  
Nana Why dont you get a job  
Say no way say no way ya no way  
Nana why dont you get a job  
  
Well I guess it aint easy doing nothing at all  
But hey man free rides just dont come along  
Every day

He wants more dinero just to stay at home  
Well my friend
