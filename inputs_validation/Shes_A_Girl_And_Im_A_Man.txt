She said she didnt understand  
And so she guessed he was deep  
She swore hed never been to college  
And was too tall to be  
So as she led him to the slaughter  
Thinking shed be laughing last  
Now the lady in the question is his better half  
Shes gotta be the stupidest girl Ive ever seen  
She dont care who why where Ive been  
Shes got a right to be  
With all thats wrong with me  
But she doesnt want to understand  
That shes a girl and Im a man  
He thought that women and drink would make a man out of him  
But the extent of his studies left a jaded man  
So as she led him to the altar he was easily led  
And when they asked him if he did  
Wwell then this is what he said  
Shes gotta be the stupidest girl Ive ever seen  
She dont care who why where Ive been  
Shes got a right to be  
With all thats wrong with me  
But she doesnt want to understand  
That shes a girl and Im a man  
Well shes a girl and Im a man  
Shes a girl and Im a man  
Shes a girl and Im a man  
Shes a girl and Im a man  
Shes a girl and Im a man  
Shes a girl  
Shes gotta be the stupidest girl Ive ever seen  
She dont care who why where Ive been  
Shes got a right to be with all thats wrong with me  
But she doesnt want to understand  
That shes a girl and Im her man  
Every time shes near me  
She gives me any reason to be alive  
Try to get right  
Yeah she looks right through me  
She says youre not cool  
Youre just like me  
Youre a stupid man  
Get over here hold my stupid hand  
Shes all right yeah  
You wouldnt understand  
Sister is a man fan  
Shes gotta be the stupidest girl Ive ever seen  
She dont care who why where Ive been  
Shes got a right to be  
With all thats wrong with me  
But she doesnt want to understand  
That shes a girl and Im a man
