You fell down of course  
And then you got up of course  
And started over  
Forgot my name of course  
Then you started to remember  
Pretty tough to think about  
The beginning of December  
Pretty tough to think about  
Pretty tough to think about  
Yeah yeah pretty tough to think about  
  
Youre looking down again  
And then you look me over  
Were laying down again  
On a blanket in the clover  
The same boy youve always known  
Well I guess I havent grown  
The same boy youve always known  
Same boy youve always known  
  
Think of what the past did  
It couldve lasted  
So put it in your basket  
I hope you know a strong man  
Who can lend you a hand  
Lowering my casket  
  
I thought this is just today  
And soon youd been returning  
The coldest blue ocean water  
Cannot stop my heart and mind from burning  
Everyone whos in the know says  
Thats exactly how it goes  
And if theres anything good about me  
Im the only one who knows
