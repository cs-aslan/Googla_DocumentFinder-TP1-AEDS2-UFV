The breeze will tease the trees  
And whistle by the brook well take a look  
And ripple by your ear to clew you in  
Its lovin time again  
For you and I will find a hideaway for love  
Will always have the right of way  
No need to tell us two its lovin time again  
Lovin time again  
  
Now if the girl for you cant see your point of view  
Lovin time will leave a spell  
The first thing that you know youll have a heart in tow  
The rest is up to you  
The moon will be discreet  
It wont repaet the things you say to me  
Its time we meet so let romance begin  
Its lovin time again lovin time again
