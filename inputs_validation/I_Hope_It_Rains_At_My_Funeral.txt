Cant send no fourteen yearold boy to no school  
The only thing i learned in the years i worked on my daddys farm was  
Son you better get them crops in when it turns cool  
In the magazines I saw the naked women  
I heard about the drinkin and the bars  
If my daddy couldve caught me hed akilled me  
He said You might run boy but you aint gonna get far  
I hit town or you might say that it hit me  
Next mornin there were things I knew more about  
The woman who had taken me in said Country boy youre all right  
The same way I turned her on she turned me out  
The first law I broke right away they got me  
I helped them build the country roads for awhile  
They fed me two times a day and knocked me down about four  
For thirty days I didnt even crack a smile  
I met a nice girl and she said I was her baby  
She let me go and would never tell me why  
I learned what it means to be somebodys baby  
They let you lie in your bed by yourself and cry  
The miles were good but the mileage is turnin my hair gray  
Ive met some people that knew me and call me friend  
Aint no sense in wantin my life to live over  
Id find different ways to make those mistakes again  
So let me say this I never tried to hurt anybody  
Though I guess theres a few that I still couldnt look in the eye  
If Ive got one wish I hope it rains at my funeral  
For once Id like to be the only one dry
