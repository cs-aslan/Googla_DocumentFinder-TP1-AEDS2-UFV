Now Im in the ether  
Look down at time  
I see three children  
Prepare to walk the line  
  
I see them older  
When life is done  
I was a loser  
At the game they won  
  
Come on lets try  
To pick up the peace  
You and I  
On our hands and knees  
Come on lets try  
To touch the Fleece  
Come on lets try  
To pick up the peace  
  
How do old people forget  
That the wars weve seen  
Are bout me longing for you  
You longing for me
