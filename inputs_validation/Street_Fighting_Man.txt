Everywhere I hear the sound of marching charging feet boy  
Cause summers here and the time is right  
For fighting in the street boy  
But what can a poor boy do  
Except to sing for a rock n roll band  
Cause in sleepy London town  
Theres just no place for a street fighting man no  
Hey think the time is right for a palace revolution  
But where I live the game to play is compromise solution  
Well then what can a poor boy do  
Except to sing for a rock n roll band  
Cause in sleepy London town  
Theres just no place for a street fighting man no  
Hey said my name is called disturbance  
Ill shout and scream Ill kill the king Ill rail at all his servants  
Well what can a poor boy do  
Except to sing for a rock n roll band  
Cause in sleepy London town  
Theres just no place for a street fighting man no
