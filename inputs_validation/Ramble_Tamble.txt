Chorus  
Move  
Down the road  
I go  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres mud in the water  
Roach in the cellar  
Bugs in the sugar  
Mortgage on the home  
Mortgage on the home  
  
Theres garbage on the sidewalk  
Highways in the back yard  
Police on the corner  
Mortgage on the car  
  
Mortgage on the car  
  
Chorus  
  
Theyre selling independence  
Actors in the white house  
Acid in digestion  
Mortgage on my life  
Mortgage on my life  
  
Chorus  
  
Ramble tamble tamble  
Ramble tamble tamble  
Ramble tamble tamble
