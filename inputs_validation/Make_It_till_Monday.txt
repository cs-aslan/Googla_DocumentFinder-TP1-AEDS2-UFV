Hey my friend are we gonna make it till Monday  
Another Friday night waiting for a revelation  
I can see a million faces in the condensation  
  
Hey my friend are we gonna make it till Monday  
Hey my friend you better leave now  
Im gonna go my own way  
You said I suffer from inner frustration  
  
In a moment you changed  
Now things werent the same  
You were talking at me not with me  
And your tongue was burning up in flames  
Are you coming back  
Are you coming back  
When Monday comes youll be alone  
With the whole world staring at you  
Better leave now
