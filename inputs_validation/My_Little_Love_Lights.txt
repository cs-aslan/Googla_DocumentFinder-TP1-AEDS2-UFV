This little lovelight of mine are you gonna let it shine  
This little lovelight of mine are you gonna let it shine  
This little lovelight of mine are you gonna let it shine  
Let it shine let it shine let it shine  
  
With your arms wrapped around me my little lovelight will shine  
With your arms wrapped around me my little lovelight will shine  
With your arms wrapped around me my little lovelight will shine  
Let it shine let it shine let it shine  
  
Someday soon you promised me youd make my lovelight shine  
Someday soon you promised me youd make my lovelight shine  
Someday soon you promised me youd make my lovelight shine  
With a kiss your arms around me make it shine  
  
Wee wee hours come and let my lovelight shine  
In the wee wee hours let my lil lovelight shine  
In the wee wee hours let my lil lovelight shine  
Let it shine let it shine let it shine
