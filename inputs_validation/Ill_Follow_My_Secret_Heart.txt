Written by noel coward  
Dont be afraid Ill betray you  
And destroy all the plans you have made  
But even your schemes must  
Make room for my dreams  
So when all I owe you is pain  
Ill still have something of my own  
A little prize thats mine alone  
Ill follow my secret heart  
My whole life through  
Ill keep all my dreams apart  
Till one comes true  
No matter what price is paid  
What stars may fade above  
Ill follow my secret heart  
Till I find love  
No matter what price is paid  
What price is paid  
Ill follow my secret heart  
Till I find love
