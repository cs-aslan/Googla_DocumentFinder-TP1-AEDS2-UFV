Guess I wasnt the best one to ask  
Me myself with my face pressed  
Up against loves glass  
To see the shiny toy Ive been hoping for  
The one I never could afford  
The wide world spins and spits turmoil  
And the nations toil for peace  
But the paws of fear upon your chest  
Only love can soothe that beast  
And my words are paper tigers  
No match for the predators of pain inside her  
  
I say love will come to you  
Hoping just because I spoke the words that theyre true  
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through  
Where theres now one there will be two  
  
I was born under the sign of cancer  
Love will come to you  
Like brushing cloth I smooth the wrinkles for an answer  
Love will come  
Im always closing my eyes and wishing Im fine  
I close my eyes and wish you fine  
Even though I know Im not this time  
Even though I know your not this time  
  
I say love will come to you  
Hoping just because I spoke the words that theyre true  
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through  
Where theres now one there will be two  
  
Dodging your memories a field of knives  
Always on the outside looking in on others lives  
  
I say love will come to you  
Hoping just because I spoke the words that theyre true  
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through  
I have offered up to you  
Where theres now one there will be two  
  
And I wish her insight to battle loves blindness  
Strength from the milk of human kindness  
A safe place for all the pieces that scattered  
Learn to pretend theres more than love that matters
