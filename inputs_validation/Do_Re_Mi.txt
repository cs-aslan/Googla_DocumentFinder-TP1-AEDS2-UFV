Lots of folks back East they say is leavin home every day  
Beatin the hot old dusty way to the California line  
Cross the desert sands they roll gettin out of that old dust bowl  
They think theyre goin to a sugar bowl but heres what they find   
Now the police at the port of entry say  
Youre number fourteen thousand for today  
Oh if you aint got the do re mi folks you aint got the do re mi  
Why you better go back to beautiful Texas Oklahoma Kansas Georgia
Tennessee  
California is a garden of Eden a paradise to live in or see  
But believe it or not you wont find it so hot  
If you aint got the do re mi  
You want to buy you a home or a farm that cant deal nobody harm  
Or take your vacation by the mountains or sea  
Dont swap your old cow for a car you better stay right where you are  
Better take this little tip from me  
Cause I look through the want ads every day  
But the headlines on the papers always say  
If you aint got the do re mi boys you aint got the do re mi  
Why you better go back to beautiful Texas Oklahoma Kansas Georgia
Tennessee  
California is a garden of Eden a paradise to live in or see  
But believe it or not you wont find it so hot  
If you aint got the do re mi
