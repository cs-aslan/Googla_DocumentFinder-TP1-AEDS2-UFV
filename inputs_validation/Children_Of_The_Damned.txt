Harris  
  
Hes walking like a small child  
But watch his eyes burn you away  
Black holes in his golden stare  
God knows he wants to go home  
Children of The Damned  
repeat another 3 times  
  
Hes walking like a dead man  
If he had lived he would have crucified us all  
Now hes standing on his last stand  
He thought oblivion well it beckons us all  
Children of The Damned  
repeat another 3 times  
  
Now it burns his hand hes turning to laugh  
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh  
Melting his face screaming in pain  
Peeling the skin from his eyes  
Watch him die according to plan  
Hes dust on the ground what did we learn  
  
Youre Children of The Damned  
Your backs against the wall  
You turn into the light  
Youre burning in the night  
Youre Children of The Damned  
Like candles watch them burn  
Burning in the light  
Youll burn again tonight  
Youre Children of The Damned
