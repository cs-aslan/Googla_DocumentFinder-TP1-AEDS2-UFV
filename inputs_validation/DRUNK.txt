How do you spell relief  
I get DareyouNK  
Lately Dave since my baby left me  
I do it almost every day  
Its the only thing that Ive found  
Thatll take the hurt away  
  
Well how do you spell relief John

Every night about sundown I get a pain down deep inside  
This old broken heart acts up  
Theres a hurtin in my pride  
Well Ive found a sure fire treatment  
Thatll get me feelin right  
When your memory starts flarin up  
I just head for the neon lights

John Hartford  
  
I dont need no doctor  
Tell me what is wrong  
I can fill my own perscriptions  
And it lasts me all night long  
Its the perfect medication  
For an ailment such as mine  
I forget about the tears Ive cried  
When the whiskey hits my mind  
  
How do we spell relief  
We get DareyouNK  
Lately since my baby left me  
I do it almost every day  
Well I tell ya Johnny  
Its the only thing Ive found  
Thatll take the pain away
