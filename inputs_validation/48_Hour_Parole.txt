Im gettin out and steppin in  
To somewhere where its warmer  
First come will be first served  
Youd better put in your order  
Been out in the cold far too long  
Gonna set the town on fire fire  
If youre not with me you better step aside  
This boys out for the kill kickin higher  
Oh 48 hour parole  
But I got to be a good boy  
Oh 48 hour parole  
Toein the line aint my style  
And I aint looking for trouble  
I wasnt born I was carved out of stone  
So dont try bustin my bubble  
chorus  
verse 1  
verse 2
