I can see you in the morning when you go to school  
Dont forget your books you know youve got to learn the golden rule  
Teacher tells you stop your play and get on with your work  
And be like Johnnietoogood well dont you know he never shirks  
Hes coming along  
  
After school is over youre playing in the park  
Dont be out too late dont let it get too dark  
They tell you not to hang around and learn what lifes about  
And grow up just like them wont you let it work it out  
And youre full of doubt  
  
Dont do this and dont do that  
What are they trying to do  
Make a good boy of you  
Do they know where its at  
Dont criticize theyre old and wise  
Do as they tell you to  
Dont want the devil to  
Come out and put your eyes  
  
Maybe Im mistaken expecting you to fight  
Or maybe Im just crazy I dont know wrong from right  
But while I am still living Ive just got this to say  
Its always up to you if you want to be that  
Want to see that  
Want to see that way  
Youre coming along
