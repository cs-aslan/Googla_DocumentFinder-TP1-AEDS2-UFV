I get up this morning forget about all my plans  
Think about my vacations with my latest man  
Everything I did what I shouldve done  
Why I didnt stay why I didnt run  
Only I hold the key to unlock the door  
I might make mistakes I made them before  
Think I hear about my life as a book  
Think I rather forget but they forced me to look  
Chorus  
mirror image mirror image  
If it isnt in black and white  
it never happened  
mirror image reflection of me  
Do you see what they want you to see  
Looking at my life through mirror image  
Mirror image  
Must I confess everything that Ive done  
Cant a girl go out and have herself some fun  
I dont wanna be judge I dont want the blame  
Living for the day is how I play the game  
There always a dream theres always a stage  
Somebodys looking now its on the front page  
Through my rear view mirror I can see where Ive been  
I forget the beginning and I cant see the end  
Chorus  
Only I hold the key to unlock the door  
I might make mistakes I made them before  
Think I hear about my life as a book  
Think I rather forget but they forced me to look  
Chorus x 2 ad libs
