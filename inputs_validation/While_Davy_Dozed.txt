I stayed the night in your arms  
Over half an hour I stayed awake  
Looking at you  
Your face seemed radiant  
The walls to Steve  
With a crack emerged  
As I held you  
Ooooh  
While nana nenena nenana Davy dozed  
I closed my eyes  
Realised the time is close for us to go  
Hold me oh hold me  
Davy Davy  
Bending like a willowbranch  
He rocks me like a baby  
Ooooh  
I know he loves another lady  
But I still see him in the hallway  
Calling me  
Oh when we danced so closely  
I really felt as though I was melting  
In a pool  
Ooooh  
Oh while nana nana nanana Davy dozed  
I closed my eyes  
Realised the time is close for us to go  
Hold me please hold me  
Davy Davy  
Bending like a willowbranch  
He rocks me like a baby  
Ooooh
