Have you ever had one of those days  
When you really need a friend  
The day drags on and on  
And you think theres no end  
  
Then you know how I feel  
Have you ever had one of those nights  
When you just lie awake  
Starin at the ceiling  
  
Untile the dawn breaks  
Then you know how I feel  
If youve heard goodbye  
And something inside just wont heal  
  
If a memory wont set you free  
And you know that it never will  
Then you know how I feel  
If youve heard goodbye  
  
And something inside just wont heal  
If a memory wont set you free  
And you know that it never will  
  
Then you know how I feel  
Then you know how I feel
