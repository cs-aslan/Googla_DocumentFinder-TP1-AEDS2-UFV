Yo  
Check this here  
There nothin that  
Id rather do  
Than spend some time  
With you  
So why dont  
We just chill  
Make it coco sexy  
You know  
You sure make it right  
Spend some quality time  
You make me want to  
Cha cha cha  
  
Oh baby you sure like to  
Nah nah nah nah nah  
Nah nah nah nah nah  
Weve been hangin out  
Everyday this week  
How about I fix you  
A little something to eat  
And just chill  
We got a while  
Right now just chill  
Parle lil momma right here  
Sippin on Chardonnay  
Slip on that  
Victoria Secret lingerie  
Cause I aint gonna  
Throw my money away  
If I can see you talk it  
Out for me  
  
Chorus  
Talkn it out  
Layin in the cut  
Kissing and rubbin  
Makin sweet lovin  
Damn the club tonight  
Girl lets work it out  
Itll be  
Just me on you  
All night  
From eleven till  
Six in the morning  
I know you like when  
I do you like that  
Just work it out  
  
Now that I got you  
All soaking wet  
I bet you know  
Whats coming next  
You  
Gonna twerk it out  
Ah baby  
Let me tell you how  
What do you think about me  
Twerkin it from your  
Front to your back  
And kickback  
Relax come sit  
Here on my lap shorty  
Tonight Im takin you  
All the way  
Wont stop until you  
Scream my name  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Morning is coming and  
I dont want to let you go  
Lets just lay her in this  
Bed of red rose pedals  
I know that we spent  
But one kiss  
Could make this start  
All over again  
If you want it baby  
Come with me  
  
Its way to trill the way  
You making it feel  
The way you twerkin is  
Oh so sexy  
Oh baby you sure  
Love the part  
Its way to trill the way  
You making it feel  
The way you twerkin is  
Oh so sexy  
Oh baby you sure  
Love the part  
  
Chorus x 2

Damn the club tonight girl  
Lets work it out  
Let me work it  
I wont hurt it  
I know you like when

Just work it out
