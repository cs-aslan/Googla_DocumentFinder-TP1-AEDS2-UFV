The night was black the roads were icy  
Snow was fallin drifts were high  
And I was weary from my driving  
And I stopped to rest for awhile  
  
I sat down at a truck stop  
I was thinking about my past  
Ive had a long streak of that bad luck  
But Im praying its gone at last  
  
Chorus  
Gone at last gone at last  
Gone at last gone at last  
I had a long streak of bad luck  
But I pray its gone at last  
Oo oo oo  
  
I aint dumb  
I kicked around some  
I dont fall too easily  
But that boy looked so dejected  
He just grabbed my sympathy  
  
Sweet little soul now whats your problem  
Tell me why youre so downcast  
Ive had a long streak of bad luck  
But I pray its gone at last  
  
Chorus  
  
Once in a while from out of nowhere  
When you dont expect it and youre unprepared  
Somebody will come and lift you higher  
And your burdens will be shared  
  
Yes I do believe if I hadnt met you  
I might still be sinking fast  
Ive had a long streak of that bad luck  
But I pray its gone at last  
  
Chorus
