If youre feeling lonely  
And think youre the only one  
Left thats alone in a bar  
If you need somebody  
With shoulders to cry on  
Well baby Im not very far  
Just look for my name on a jukebox  
When youre tired of being alone  
Put in a dime  
And Ill take the time  
To sing you a sad country song  
  
If you started drinkin  
And still cant stop thinkin  
About all those all nights alone  
If teardrops start fallin  
And you keep on callin  
To find out theres nobody home  
Just look for my name on a jukebox  
When youre tired of being alone  
Put in a dime  
And Ill take the time  
Ill sing you a sad country song
