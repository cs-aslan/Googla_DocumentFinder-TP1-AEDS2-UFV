Well if youre travelin in the north country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
She once was a true love of mine  
  
Well if you go when the snowflakes storm  
When the rivers freeze and summer ends  
Please see if shes wearing a coat so warm  
To keep her from the howlin winds  
  
Please see for me if her hair hangs long  
If it rolls and flows all down her breast  
Please see for me if her hair hangs long  
Thats the way I remember her best  
  
Im awonderin if she remembers me at all  
Many times Ive often prayed  
In the darkness of my night  
In the brightness of my day  
  
So if youre travelin in the north country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
She once was a true love of mine
