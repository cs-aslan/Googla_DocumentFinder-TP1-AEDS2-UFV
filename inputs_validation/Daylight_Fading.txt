Waiting for the moon to come and light me up inside  
And I am waiting for the telephone to tell me Im alive  
Well I heard you let somebody get their fingers into you  
Its getting cold in California  
I guess Ill be leaving soon  
  
Daylight fading  
Come and waste another year  
All the anger and the eloquence are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping around the corners of our lawn  
When we see the early signs that daylights fading  
We leave just before its gone  
  
She said Everybody loves you  
She says Everybody cares  
But all the things I keep inside myself  
They vanish in the air  
If you tell me that youll wait for me  
Ill say I wont be here  
I want to say goodbye to you  
Goodbye to all my friends  
Goodbye to everyone I know  
  
Daylight fading  
Come and waste another year  
All the anger and the eloquence are bleeding into fear  
Moonlight creeping around the corners of our lawn  
When we see the early signs that daylights fading  
We leave just before its gone
