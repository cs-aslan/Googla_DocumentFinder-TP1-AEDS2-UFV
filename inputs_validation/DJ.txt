Im home lost my job and incurably ill  
You think this is easy realism  
Ive got a girl out there I suppose  
I think shes dancing  
Feel like Dan Dare lies down  
I think shes dancing what do I know  
I am a DJ I am what I play  
Cant turn around no cant turn around no oh ooh  
I am a DJ I am what I play  
Cant turn around no cant turn around no oh no  
I am a DJ I am what I play  
I got believers kisskiss  
Believing me oh  
One more weekend of lights and evening faces  
Fast food living nostalgia  
Humble pie or bitter fruit  
I am a DJ I am what I play  
Cant turn around no cant turn around no ooh  
I am a DJ I am what I say  
Cant turn around no cant turn around ooh  
I am a DJ I am what I play  
Ive got believers kisskiss  
Believing me  
I am a DJ I am what I play  
Can turn around no cant turn around  
I am a DJ I am what I play  
Can turn around no cant turn around  
I am a DJ I am what I play  
Can turn around no kisskiss  
Time flies when youre having fun  
Break his heart break her heart  
He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer  
I am a DJ and Ive got believers  
Ive got believers  
Ive got believers  
Ive got believers in me  
Ive got believers  
I am a DJ I am what I play  
I am a DJ
