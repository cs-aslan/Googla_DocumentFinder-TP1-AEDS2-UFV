Lost in the dark the lovers embrace  
As the last song plays everyone makes for home  
Now its just me and you alone  
  
And I wont really care if we cant meet again  
You just live your life Im just a night to pass  
Youre just a dream that couldnt last  
  
Take me tonight  
Take me tonight  
Take me tonight  
I want you I want you  want me too   
  
No way of knowing just where my lifes going  
Who cares if its wrong or its right  
When all I believe in is just how Im feeling tonight  
  
Oh take me tonight  
Take me tonight  
Take me tonight  
I want you I want you  
  
To fade
