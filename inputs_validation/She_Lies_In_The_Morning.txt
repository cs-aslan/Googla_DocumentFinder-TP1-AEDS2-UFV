She lies in the morning  
Red sky is the warning yes it is  
She lies in the morning  
Red sky is in her eyes  
She cries cause the morning is too long  
She tries but she still cant carry on  
She lies to escape the morning sun  
She dies and the world still caries on  
  
Where did you go  
Why did you fall  
She didnt know theres nothing at all  
  
You killed yourself my love  
Theres nothing left for me  
Life was a pain but now youre free  
You shot your soul my love  
Blew all you had  
Now Im left here feeling bad  
You shot your life away  
For the unreal  
Now theres nothing left to feel  
You made your tracks my love  
You made them deep  
Now theres nothing left but sleep
