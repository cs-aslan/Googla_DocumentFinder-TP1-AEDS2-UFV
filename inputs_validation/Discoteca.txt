Hay una discoteca por acqui  
  
I dont speak the language  
I cant understand the word  
Where angels fear to tread  
Ive sometimes walked and tried to talk  
  
But how can I be heard  
In such a world  
When Im lost  
Im doing what I do  
  
To see me through  
Im going out  
And carrying on as normal  
  
Hay una discoteca por acqui  
  
Te quiero  
Entiende usted  
Digame  
Cuanto tiempo tengo que esperar  
  
I dont speak in anger  
Though the chances that Ive let  
Pass me by  
And now regret I cant forget  
  
Theyre haunting me  
Like a score of unpaid debts  
Is it enough  
To live in hope  
  
That one day well be free  
Without this fear  
Im going out  
And carrying on as normal  
  
Hay una discoteca por acqui  
  
Te quiero  
Entiende usted  
Digame  
Cuanto tiempo tengo que esperar
