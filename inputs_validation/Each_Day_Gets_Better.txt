Where do we go who knows  
But each day gets better I just cant let her go  
Oh no Each kiss gets sweeter I just cant leave her oh no  
  
Ill write a song Ive thought about it for far too long  
But Ive never had someone to sing about until I met her  
Each day gets better  
  
Nobody knows nobody sees nobody understands me like she  
Now that I know what true love means I just hope she stays with me  
  
Where do we go who knows  
But each day gets better I just cant let her go  
Oh no Each kiss gets sweeter I just cant leave her  
  
She wants to breathe  
She wants to be where the grass is green  
She wants to know how loves supposed to be  
She wants it better  
I want to let her know she belongs right here with me  
Shes heard it all but Ill make her see  
Ill make her fall make her believe  
Ill promise her that Ill never leave  
  
Where do we go who knows  
But each day gets better I just cant let her go  
Oh no Each kiss gets sweeter I just cant leave her  
  
I just had to write a song about her  
Tell her I dont wanna live without her  
Tell her I would build my world around her  
Deeper and deeper sweeter and sweeter  
Ill never leave her alone  
  
Where do we go who knows  
But each day gets better I just cant let her go  
Oh no Each kiss gets sweeter I just cant leave her no
