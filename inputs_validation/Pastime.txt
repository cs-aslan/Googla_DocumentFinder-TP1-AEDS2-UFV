Baby would it be too much if I told you that Im in love  
Life has never been better we are closer than ever  
Baby would it be alright if I took a bit of your time  
To tell you my little secret promise that you will keep it  
  
If I was ruler for a day and there were things that I could change  
I wouldnt change a thing thats how much you mean  
  
Youre my favorite pastime and Im so happy youre mine  
We have come so far you know but theres still farther we can go  
Youre my favorite pastime and baby you make me smile  
With the happiness you bring it makes me wanna sing  
  
Baby would it make you scared if I said I want to be there  
To hold you through all the bad times and guide you back to the sunshine  
Cause baby it would make me cry to not have you in my life  
How could I go on breathing when youre the air that Im needing  
  
If I could have my every wish and there were things that I could switch  
I wouldnt switch a thing thats how much you mean  
  
Youre my favorite pastime and Im so happy youre mine  
We have come so far you know but theres still farther we can go  
Youre my favorite pastime and baby you make me smile  
With the happiness you bring it makes me wanna sing  
  
Oh when I look at you I see the future  
Thats happy ever after well make it work  
Though I may not always please you Ill never grieve you  
You lift me up when I am down so happy that Ive found you  
  
Cause baby you are my  
Youre my favorite pastime and Im so happy youre mine  
We have come so far you know but theres still farther we can go  
Youre my favorite pastime and baby you make me smile  
With the happiness you bring it makes me wanna sing  
  
I wanna sing to you  
I wanna sing to you yeah
