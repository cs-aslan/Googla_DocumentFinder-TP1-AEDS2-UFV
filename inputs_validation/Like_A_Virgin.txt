I made it through the wilderness  
Somehow I made it through  
Didnt know how lost I was  
Until I found you  
  
I was beat incomplete  
Id been had I was sad and blue  
But you made me feel  
Yeah you made me feel  
Shiny and new  
  
CHORUS  
Like a virgin  
Touched for the very first time  
Like a virgin  
When your heart beats after first time With your heartbeat  
Next to mine  
  
Gonna give you all my love boy  
My fear is fading fast  
Been saving it all for you  
Cause only love can last  
  
Youre so fine and youre mine  
Make me strong yeah you make me bold  
Oh your love thawed out  
Yeah your love thawed out  
What was scared and cold  
  
CHORUS  
  
Oooh oooh oooh  
  
Youre so fine and youre mine  
Ill be yours till the end of time  
Cause you made me feel  
Yeah you made me feel  
Ive nothing to hide  
  
CHORUS  
  
Like a virgin ooh ooh  
Like a virgin  
Feels so good inside  
When you hold me and your heart beats and you love me  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Ooh baby  
Cant you hear my heart beat  
For the very first time
