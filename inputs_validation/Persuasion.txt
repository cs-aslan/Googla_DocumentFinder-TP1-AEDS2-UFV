You got persuasion  
I cant help myself  
You got persuasion  
I cant help myself  
Something about you baby  
Keeps me from goin to somebody else  
  
Yeah any way you want  
Now now baby  
You put me in a daze  
All the time  
Look what cha got for me baby  
Like the devil in disguise  
  
Something about you baby  
Youre one  
Youre one of a kind  
  
Oh this spell you put on me  
Has just outdone me babe  
I cant keep the rain from comin down  
  
Look out now  
I cant get out from under  
But I wouldnt want to  
Even if I can  
  
Something about you baby  
Make me feel  
Make me feel like a man
