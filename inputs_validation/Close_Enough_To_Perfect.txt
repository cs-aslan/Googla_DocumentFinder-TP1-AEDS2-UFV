Sometimes her morning coffees way too strong  
And sometimes what she says she says all wrong  
But right or wrong shes there beside me  
Like only a friend would be  
And thats close enough to perfect for me  
  
Now shes been known to wear her pants too tight  
And drinking puts her out just like a light  
Heaven knows shes not an angel but shed really like to be  
And thats close enough to perfect for me  
  
She kisses me each morning  
And smiles her sleepy smile  
And she dont have to say it  
I can see it in her eyes  
Dont you worry about my woman  
Or what you think she ought to be  
Cause shes close enough to perfect for me  
  
Well sometimes she gets down and starts to cry  
But then again a lady has a right  
Shes everything I ever wanted shes all Ill ever need  
Shes close enough to perfect for me  
  
She kisses me each morning  
And smiles her sleepy smile  
And she dont have to say it  
I can see it in her eyes  
Dont you worry about my woman  
Or what you think she ought to be  
Cause shes close enough to perfect for me  
  
Oh shes close enough to perfect for me
