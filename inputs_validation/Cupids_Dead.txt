you read the papers today  
  
I read the news today oh boy  
About a tragic comedy  
Newspaper hinted suicide  
The letterhead read dear johnny  
A tainted truth was all it said  
Sleep tight now that  
Youve made your bed  
An arrow that once pierced your heart  
Points to the apple on your head  
  
Three sides to every story  
Yours mine  
And Monday mornings  
  
Cupids dead headlines read  
Cupids dead  
Cupids dead headlines read  
Cupids dead  
  
Oh romeo oh romeo  
Where did our love go romeo  
If you read between the headlines  
You wouldnt be the last to know  
No mystery yet to unfold  
A paperboy left in the cold  
A love was said to never die  
Withered away and just got old  
  
our top story tonight  
Is a crime of passion  
The victim an unidentified man  
Is found in bed wearing only a diaper  
Holding a bow an arrow in one hand  
And clutching a letter in the other  
The letter simply read  
Cupids dead  
  
Extra extra extra  
Read all about it  
  
Cupids dead  
  
Cupid is dead deceased  
I got peace of mind  
Still its hard to forget  
What it leaves behind  
A lot of love lost  
Your feelings are wasted  
Tasted the sweetness  
But now youre faced with  
The thought of being alone  
Nor more companionship  
You can handle it  
Just abandon it  
Leave it behind  
And look for the brighter day  
Give it some time  
Cause it wont come right away  
You gotta be standing strong  
Hold on to your dignity  
Dont sit around  
Saying look what ya did to me  
Its time to move on  
You gotta continue  
To look for a love  
Of a life thats within you  
Cupid is dead now  
Its time to rely on  
Yourself to cope  
You got no shoulder to cry on  
Dead
