Fight fight tooth and nail  
Fight fight tooth and nail  
  
Its the law of the jungle  
The strongest will survive  
And thats the rule I live by  
Think fast and stay alive  
Keep the eye of the tiger  
Gather cunning strength and speed  
Use evry trick you know  
Dont retreat until they bleed  
  
Your hands a dwadly weapon  
Your teeth can rip in two  
Getem before they get you  
Theres no more time to loose  
  
Chorus  
Fight fight tooth and nail  
If you think theyll show you mercy  
You better think again  
You gotta fight  
  
Im akin to the lion the tiger and the bear  
I use what nature gives to rip and  
Slash and tear  
Im really very gentle rather make love  
Than go to war  
But if you try to harm me  
Youll die by netures law  
  
My hands a deadly weapon  
My teeth can rip in two  
A present of death I give you  
Ill run you through and through  
  
Chorus  
  
Once more into the cobras nest  
A poisoned victory  
Blood stains the sands of history  
If youll wage war youll get no pity from me oh no  
  
Chorus
