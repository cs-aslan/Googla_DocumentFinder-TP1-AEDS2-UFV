I am here alone in the falling snow  
And the wind it cools my tears  
I have been so wrong  
I have turned away but the road was long  
And finally I have come to my knees  
I want to be  
  
Where I can walk  
Where I can run  
Where my heart sings  
And I feel the sun  
Where I can trust  
And Im strong enough  
Free like the wind  
Ill run into my Fathers arms  
Im finally home  
  
Oh the winds of change  
They blow slow and cool  
Oh the wandering of a fool  
But I have laid it down  
In my Fathers hands  
Where the weight of suffering  
Is carried by the arms of a cross  
Healing my loss  
  
Where I can walk  
Where I can run  
Where my heart sings  
And I feel the sun  
Where I can trust  
And Im strong enough  
Free like the wind  
Ill run into my Fathers arms  
  
Heaven has reached into my lonely soul  
Loving so deep and so complete  
Til I dont feel alone  
Where the light of love is burning  
Where the past is washed away  
Where I feel the sunlight shining on my face  
Now I can  
  
Walk  
Now I can run  
Now my heart sings  
And I feel the sun  
Now I can trust  
And Im strong enough  
Free like the wind  
Ill run into my Fathers arms  
Im finally home  
  
Now I can trust  
And Im strong enough  
Free like the wind I run  
Into my Fathers arms  
Im finally home
