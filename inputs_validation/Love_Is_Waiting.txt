Ohhoh ohhahhh  
Yeah ohh uhuhuhah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Now were looking on and finding  
Things are looking up  
My life is moving on  
Onto better than the love  
  
Cause Im feelin fine  
And love is love is hard to find  
Its suddenly a game  
And you won this heart of mine  
  
Bridge  
I never believe it  
After all that Ive been through  
So good to receive it  
All alone that I found you  
  
Chorus  
Love is waiting love is waiting  
And this time Im taking it all this time  
So amazing so amazing  
I dont need a reason to fall uh no no  
  
You know everyday you see it  
Love is burning out  
And I just have to say  
Thats the way its turning now  
Well its plain to see  
Baby what you do to me  
What used to be a dream  
Is now everything thats on me yeah  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Moving on moving on baby  
Moving on moving on  
Looking on looking on baby  
Looking on looking on  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus x 4
