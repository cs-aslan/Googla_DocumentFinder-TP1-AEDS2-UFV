Verse 1 Young Jeezy  
Its 345 she pulled up to my house  
Grabbed my strap got the door  
With a blunt in my mouth  
Say Im bout to put the smack down  
You know ill put the smack down  
And now I put the smack down  
She park in the background  
Look at me Im standing tall  
She knows how to keep it up  
We just left the club  
So you know we both drunk as fuck  
30 min in second wind  
Call it cardio  
I go up and down round and round super Mario  
Oh wee oh wee she busting like a Uzi  
Im riding that Suzuki  
She wetting such a jacuzzi  
Call it in code 10  
Get ready for the water flow  
Number 16 terr it up  
  
Chorus Trey Songz

And I dont know if you can handle it I dont know if you can handle it  
But Im thinking about taking it taking it there  
Cause thats the only way you aint get it and you

And Ive been thinking about it all day long all day long shawty  
And that two think I cant handle it but her  
But Im think I might end up taking it  
  
Verse 2 Young Jeezy

She know Im the one to call when she want that good shit  
She know Im the one to call when she wants the hood shit  
Baby looking all good about to meet her all hood  
Jump her in the call yea you know the handle all wood

Yea aint got to take em off for me over aggressive  
About to be an accident just call for progressive
