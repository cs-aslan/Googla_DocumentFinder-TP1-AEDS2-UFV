You need someone to hide behind  
I dont mind well I dont mind  
You need to be alone to unwind  
Thats alright thats alright  
  
Sure I know its hard  
You know that its that way for everyone  
for everyone  
Somethings go wrong  
They sink so low you even blame the sun  
Blame it at the   
Of the shadows on the wall  
Theyre not as bad as they appear  
Could it be that its the season of the shark  
  
You need someone to help you through  
well I dont know I dont know  
Someone to take a chance for you  
I dont know I dont know  
  
I want to be the one to make you fell okay right now  
Someway somehow  
When I fall short  
I sink so low I even blame the clouds  
Blocking out the sun  
And the shadows on the wall  
That is why you fell alone  
Could it be that its the season of the shark  
  
Please dont be afraid  
No matter how much out there scares you so  
Scares you so  
Just look around  
If its not me then someone else you know  
Youre not alone at all  
Ignore the shadows on the wall  
They dont mean a thing  
Could it be that its the season  
I believe that its the season of the shark  
Could it be that its the seas
