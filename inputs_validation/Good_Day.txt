The sky is blue  
But there are clouds in my head  
With big decisions looming ahead  
The sun is out but  
The room is so grey  
So much confusion headed my way  
Get positive try to be gay  
  
News of the world  
Tea and biscuits in bed  
The headlines said that Diana is dead  
She couldnt act much but she put on a show  
She always smiled  
Even when she felt low  
I used to fancy her a long time ago  
  
So today has got to be a good day  
Today is gonna be a good day  
Today is gonna be a good day  
Good day good day good day  
  
Holes in my socks  
And I cant find my shoes  
Its no surprise that Im singing the blues  
So many holes in my life still to mend  
And someone just said  
That the worlds gonna end  
  
So today better be a good day  
Today is gonna be a good day  
Today has got to be a good day  
Good day good day good day good day  
  
If we blow away the past  
With a bloody great blast  
Make it fast make it fast  
So have a good day today  
Because it could be your last  
Make it last make it last  
  
Will it light up the sky  
Will it blot out the sun  
Well weve waited this long  
So it better be a good one  
Good day good day good day  
  
Yeah its gonna be a good day  
Hey baby if you come back home  
Itll be a good day today  
They could drop a small atom bomb  
On the city today  
But if you walk through that door honey  
You know itll be a good day  
  
And now survival is my only aim  
I call friends and see if any remain  
Who was that girl who used to be my flame  
Id call her if I could remember her name  
  
So today is gonna be a good day  
Today has got to be a good day  
Today is gonna be a good day  
Good day good day good day good day  
  
Hey Diana Ive really got to learn  
To take a tip from you  
Put on my makeup and try  
To make the world take notice of you  
Yeah its gonna be good day today  
  
Good day gonna be a good day  
repeat
