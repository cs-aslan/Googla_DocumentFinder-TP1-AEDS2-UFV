They took Your commandments off the schoolhouse walls  
They say Its a crime to even pray within the halls  
But bless the child that lets You in and knows without a doubt  
Once you live inside a heart they cant take You out  
We are soldiers of the Cross  
Weve been found to reach the lost  
In city streets down country roads  
We take You with us everyday and everywhere we go  
Heres to those across the land working in a place  
Where the boss man and the government say they cant share their faith  
But they know all too well theyll lose their job if they get caught  
But to win a soul for Jesus they will risk it all because  
We are soldiers of the Cross  
Weve been found to reach the lost  
In city streets down country roads  
We take You with us everyday and everywhere we go  
In the God of all creation we put our faith and trust  
And give our lives to You cause You gave Your life for us  
We are soldiers of the Cross  
Weve been found to reach the lost  
In city streets down country roads  
We take You with us everyday and everywhere we go  
Everywhere we go
