The name of this tune is Mississippi Goddam  
And I mean every word of it  
  
Alabamas gotten me so upset  
Tennessee made me lose my rest  
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam  
  
Alabamas gotten me so upset  
Tennessee made me lose my rest  
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam  
  
Cant you see it  
Cant you feel it  
Its all in the air  
I cant stand the pressure much longer  
Somebody say a prayer  
  
Alabamas gotten me so upset  
Tennessee made me lose my rest  
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam  
  
This is a show tune  
But the show hasnt been written for it yet  
  
Hound dogs on my trail  
School children sitting in jail  
Black cat cross my path  
I think every days gonna be my last  
  
Lord have mercy on this land of mine  
We all gonna get it in due time  
I dont belong here  
I dont belong there  
Ive even stopped believing in prayer  
  
Dont tell me  
I tell you  
Me and my people just about due  
Ive been there so I know  
They keep on saying Go slow  
  
But thats just the trouble  
Do it slow  
Washing the windows  
Do it slow  
Picking the cotton  
Do it slow  
Youre just plain rotten  
Do it slow  
Youre too damn lazy  
Do it slow  
The thinkings crazy  
Do it slow  
Where am I going  
What am I doing  
I dont know  
I dont know  
  
Just try to do your very best  
Stand up be counted with all the rest  
For everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam  
  
I made you thought I was kiddin  
  
Picket lines  
School boy cots  
They try to say its a communist plot  
All I want is equality  
For my sister my brother my people and me  
  
Yes you lied to me all these years  
You told me to wash and clean my ears  
And talk real fine just like a lady  
And youd stop calling me Sister Sadie  
  
Oh but this whole country is full of lies  
Youre all gonna die and die like flies  
I dont trust you any more  
You keep on saying Go slow  
Go slow  
  
But thats just the trouble  
Do it slow  
Desegregation  
Do it slow  
Mass participation  
Do it slow  
Reunification  
Do it slow  
Do things gradually  
Do it slow  
But bring more tragedy  
Do it slow  
Why dont you see it  
Why dont you feel it  
I dont know  
I dont know  
  
You dont have to live next to me  
Just give me my equality  
Everybody knows about Mississippi  
Everybody knows about Alabama  
Everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam
