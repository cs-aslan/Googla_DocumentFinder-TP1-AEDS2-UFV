Its 5 oclock I think of you  
Live my life without you and Im feeling blue  
I told you lies love fades away  
Oh I loved you baby but didnt say  
Its 5 oclock a lonely night  
And I just remember we were side by side  
I made mistakes you went away  
And now I know the words I didnt say  
  
How can I fall in love  
With a blue eyed coloured baby girl  
How can you tell me we cant be together oh no  
  
The night is gone I couldnt sleep  
I saw the old videos Ill always keep  
Day in day out Im missing you  
Is there just a little chance what I can do  
The night is gone I watched a star  
I have to face the future oh youre so far  
Some lies are true  
Can we stay friends  
Tell me baby when will I see you again  
  
How can I fall in love  
With the girl with the golden hair  
How can you tell me we cant be together oh no
