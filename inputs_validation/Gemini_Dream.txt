Long time no see  
Short time for you and me  
So fine so good  
Were on the road  
Like you knew we would  
  
First night so long  
A state of mind  
What can go wrong  
Were here the time is right  
To rock n roll  
Right through the night  
  
Make it work out  
Make it work  
Make it work out  
Make it work out  
For each other tonight  
  
Stage fright candle light  
You cant let go  
Tonights the night  
Came back for you  
Glad to see  
That you came too  
  
Theres a place a Gemini dream  
Theres no escaping from the love we have seen  
So come with me turn night today  
You gonna wake up  
You know you gonna wake up in a Gemini dream  
  
Turned round to see  
Where weve been  
And what we believe  
In life love  
Take a chance  
See it through  
Youll be glad  
That you came too  
  
Theres a place a Gemini dream  
Theres no escaping from the love we have seen  
So come with me turn night to day  
You gonna wake up  
You know you gonna wake up in a Gemini dream  
  
Long time no see  
The lights go up  
For you and me  
Were here  
The time is right  
To rock n roll  
Right through the night  
  
Living it  
Believing it  
Wanting it  
Make it work out  
Make it work  
Make it work out  
Make it work out  
For each other tonight  
  
Long time no see  
Short time for you and me  
So fine so far so good  
Were on the road  
Like you knew we would
