Baby so you think you can start again  
You got somebody new  
But the same thing keeps happening  
At the moment of truth  
Whoever youre loving  
You will be thinking of me  
  
Chorus  
As long as Niagara falls  
As long as Gibraltar stands  
Til Hell freezes over  
Ill always be your man  
  
Tell me when youre there lying by his side  
Do you make him believe all your needs have been satisfied  
Does he know that your heart is taken forever  
Girl you will always be mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Time cant erase  
What you feel in your heart  
You cant replace the love  
No it doesnt matter how hard you try  
Girl youre gonna miss my loving till the day you die  
Til Hell freezes over  
  
Chorus  
  
As long as Niagara falls  
Until the end of time  
Til Hell freezes over  
You are forever mine  
  
Chorus
