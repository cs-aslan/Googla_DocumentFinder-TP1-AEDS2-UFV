Three thirty in the morning  
Not a soul in sight  
The citys lookin like a ghost town  
On a moonless summer night  
Raindrops on the windshield  
Theres a storm movin in  
Hes headin back from somewhere  
That he never should have been  
And the thunder rolls  
And the thunder rolls  
  
Every light is burnin  
In a house across town  
Shes pacin by the telephone  
In her faded flannel gown  
Askin for miracle  
Hopin shes not right  
Prayin its the weather  
Thats kept him out all night  
And the thunder rolls  
And the thunder rolls  
  
The thunder rolls  
And the lightnin strikes  
Another love grows cold  
On a sleepless night  
As the storm blows on  
Out of control  
Deep in her heart  
The thunder rolls  
  
Shes waitin by the window  
When he pulls into the drive  
She rushes out to hold him  
Thankful hes alive  
But on the wind and rain  
A strange new perfume blows  
And the lightnin flashes in her eyes  
And he knows that she knows  
And the thunder rolls  
And the thunder rolls  
  
The thunder rolls  
And the lightnin strikes  
Another love grows cold  
On a sleepless night  
As the storm blows on  
Out of control  
Deep in her heart  
The thunder rolls
