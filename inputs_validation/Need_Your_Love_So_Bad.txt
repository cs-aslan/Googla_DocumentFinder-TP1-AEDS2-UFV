I need someones hand  
To lead me through the night  
Need someones arms  
To hold and squeeze me tight  
When the night begins  
Im at an end  
Cause I need your love so bad  
Need some lips to feel next to mine  
Need someone to stand up  
And tell my when Im lying  
When the lights are low  
And its time to go  
Thats when I need your love so bad  
So why dont you give it up  
And bring it on home to me  
Or write it on a piece of paper baby  
So it can be read to me  
Tell me that you love me  
Stop driving me mad  
Because I need your love so bad  
I need a soft voice  
To talk to me at night  
Dont wont to worry baby  
I know well make everything alright  
Listen to my plea yeah  
Bring it to me  
Cause I need your love so bad  
Because I need your love so bad
