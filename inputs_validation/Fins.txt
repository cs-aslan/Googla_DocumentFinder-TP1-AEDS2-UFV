She came down from Cincinnati  
It took her three days on the train  
Lookin for some peace and quiet  
Hoped to see the sun again  
  
But now she lives down by the ocean  
Shes takin care to look for sharks  
They hang out in the local bars  
And they feed right after dark  
  
Cant you feel em circlin honey  
Cant you feel em swimmin around  
You got fins to the left fins to the right  
And youre the only bait in town  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
You got fins to the left fins to the right  
And youre the only girl in town  
  
Shes saving up all of her money  
Wants to head it south in May  
Maybe roll in the sand with a rock n roll man  
Somewhere down Montserrat way  
  
But the moneys good in the season  
Helps to lighten up her load  
Boys keep her high as the months go by  
Shes getting postcards from the road  
  
Cant you feel em closin in honey  
Cant you feel em schoolin around  
You got fins to the left fins to the right  
And youre the only girl in town  
  
Sailed off to Antigua  
It took her three days on a boat  
Lookin for some peace and quiet  
Maybe keep her dreams afloat  
  
But now she feels like a remora  
Cause the schools still close at hand  
Just behind the reef are the big white teeth  
Of the sharks that can swim on the land  
  
Cant you feel em circlin honey  
Cant you feel em schoolin around  
You got fins to the left fins to the right  
And youre the only bait in town  
You got fins to the left fins to the right  
And youre the only girl in town
