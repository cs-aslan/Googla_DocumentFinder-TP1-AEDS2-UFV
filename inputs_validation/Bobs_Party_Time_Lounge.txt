Glad you came glad youre here  
Have some champagne imported beer  
Dig down in your dirt bag  
And roll us out a spliff  
  
Been erect here now for thirteen days  
And I came to get relief  
At Bobs Party Time  
Pack my nose with cocaine  
Feed my filthy hole  
  
Bust out the dancin women  
Im prone to lose control  
And if by chance I fall down  
And bust my head on the floor  
Just wrap my wound in a porterhouse steak  
And point me towards the shore  
At Bobs Party Time
