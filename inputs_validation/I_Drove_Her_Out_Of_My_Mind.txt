She gave me my walking papers  
And ran off with someone new  
Cause he bought her things  
My wages couldnt buy  
So I turned to ups and downers  
And everything between  
Still I cant get her good lovin  
Off my mind  
  
Well today I bought a Cadillac  
The kind shes always wanted  
I called and asked her  
If shed like to ride  
She said this is our last date  
I said thats alright with me  
Cause tonight Im driving her  
Out of my mind  
  
Yeah Ill take her on a scenic cruise  
Right off of Lookout Mountain  
Cause she said I never took her out  
When she was mine  
Shell see all seven states  
As we drive to the pearly gates  
Tonight when I drive her  
Out of my mind  
  
All the papers will read Lovers leap  
Again off Lookout Mountain  
Cause I wrote a note  
That called it suicide  
But my epitaph will say  
He killed his pain yesterday  
When he finally drove that woman  
Off his mind  
  
Well now here she comes to greet me  
Dressed to kill and so am I  
Hope she asks me if this  
Cadillac will fly  
And I know that Ill die laughin  
When I show her that it will  
When I drive that woman  
Right out of my mind  
  
Hell Ill take her on a scenic cruise  
Right off of Lookout Mountain  
Cause she said I never took her out  
When she was mine  
Shell see all seven states  
As we drive to the pearly gates  
Tonight when I drive her  
Out of my mind  
  
Theyll say Johnny Cash was quite a smash  
Down here in Chattanooga  
Last night when he drove her  
Out of his mind  
  
Yeah that Cadillac dealers in for a big surprise too  
99 dollars down 99 dollars a month  
Yeah its gonna be just gorgeous  
  
Ooh to the pearly gates  
Ooh to the pearly gates  
Ooh to the pearly gates
