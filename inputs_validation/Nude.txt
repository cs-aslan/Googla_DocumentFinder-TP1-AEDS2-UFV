Dont get any big ideas  
Theyre not gonna happen  
You paint yourself white  
And fill up with noise  
Therell be something missing  
And now that you found it  
Its gone  
Now that you feel it  
You dont  
Youve gone off the rails  
  
She stands stark naked  
And she beckons you to bed  
Dont go youll only want  
To come back again  
  
So dont get any big ideas  
Theyre not gonna happen  
Youll go to Hell  
For what your  
Dirty mind is thinking  
  
And now that you found it  
Its gone  
Now that you feel it  
You dont  
Its gone forever
