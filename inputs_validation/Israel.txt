Youve had your troubles Israel  
Ive seen them all  
But you put the writing on the wall  
Israel Israel yeah  
  
You know Ive seen you fall so many times  
Ive cried for you and thats a crime  
Israel Israel Israel  
  
Where theres sand  
Where theres beautiful sand yeah  
You know you got a kind of feeling  
Thats just grand  
Take me into your arms  
Let me be with you  
Israel Israel Israel  
  
I like the smiles up on your peoples faces  
They make you feel warm embraces  
And I want that kind of smile  
that kind of smile  
Israel you make the whole world think about you  
And if they dont theyll find a reason  
to shout about Israel Israel  
  
Youre the only one Israel Israel  
Tell me all about it  
Tell me all about it  
Tell me all about it  
Oh take me into your arms  
And make me feel your goodness  
Be with me Israel  
Hey hey hey hey  
Oh oh oh  
Take me into your arms  
Let me hold hold you to myself  
Oh I want to Israel  
  
Israel Oh take me back into into your arms  
Israel Israel Israel Israel
