Well the house is arockin  
Dont bother knockin  
Yeah the house is arockin  
Dont bother knockin  
Yeah the house is arockin  
Dont bother come on in  
  
Kick off your shoes start losin the blues  
This old house aint got nothin to lose  
Seen it all for years start spreadin the news  
We got room on the floor  
Come on baby shake sumpin loose  
  
Well the house is arockin  
Dont bother knockin  
Yeah the house is arockin  
Dont bother knockin  
Yeah the house is arockin  
Dont bother come on in  
  
Walkin up the street you can hear the sound  
Of some bad honkytonkers really layin it down  
Theyve seen it all for years and got nothin to lose  
So get out on the floor  
Shimmy til you shake sumpin loose  
  
Well the house is arockin  
Dont bother knockin  
Yeah the house is arockin  
Dont bother knockin  
Yeah the house is arockin  
Dont bother come on in
