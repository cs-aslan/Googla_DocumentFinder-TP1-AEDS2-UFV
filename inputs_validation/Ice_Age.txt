Ive seen the real atrocities  
Buried in the sand  
Stockpiled for safety  
While we stand holding hands  
  
Im living in the Ice age  
Im living in the Ice age  
Nothing will hold  
Nothing will fit  
Into the cold  
Its not an eclipse  
Living in the Ice age  
Living in the Ice age  
Living in the Ice age  
  
Searching for another way  
Hide behind the door  
Well live in holes and disused shafts  
Hopes for little more  
  
Im living in the Ice age  
Im living in the Ice age  
Nothing will hold  
Nothing will fit  
Into the cold  
No smile on your lips  
Living in the Ice age  
Living in the Ice age  
Living in the Ice age  
Living in the Ice age  
Living in the Ice age  
Living in the Ice age  
Living in the Ice age
