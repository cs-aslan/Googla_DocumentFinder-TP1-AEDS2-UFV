Grapefruit  
A bathin suit  
Chew a little Juicy Fruit  
Wash away the night  
  
Drive in  
You guzzle gin  
Commit a little mortal sin  
Its good for the soul  
  
And oh it gets so damn lonely  
When youre on a plane alone  
And if I had the money honey  
Id strap you in beside me  
And never ever leave you  
Leave you at home all alone and cryin  
  
Ten speed  
No need  
My pickup gets me where I please  
Chuggin down the street  
  
But Ill be leavin  
In a little while  
So close your eyes and Ill  
Ill be back real soon  
  
Ah take it Reefers  
Ladies choice Everybody dance  
Here we go  
  
Yes and if I had that money honey  
Id strap you in beside me in your strapless  
And never ever leave you  
Leave you at home all alone and cryin  
  
Grapefruit  
A bathin suit  
You chew a little Juicy Fruit  
Wash away the night  
Yeah you chew a little Juicy Fruit  
Its good for ya soul
