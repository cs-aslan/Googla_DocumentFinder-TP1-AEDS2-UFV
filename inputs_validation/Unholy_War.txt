From the start of life  
To your dying day  
In the dark of night  
And in the burning light of day  
  
Its a bloody fight  
And you cant walk away  
Theres no rest in sight  
And I struggle just to slave  
  
Im tired of living on the front line  
Of this  
  
Chorus  
Unholy war unholy war  
We try we fight until we die  
Unholy war unholy war  
You see you know youll always be  
Unholy  
  
I see your burning fuse  
From a mile away  
You take the worlds abuse  
Then you bow your head in shame  
  
You gotta learn to bite the hand  
That pulls your chain  
Theres too much sanity  
It will make you go insane  
  
Ill fight when were all on the same side  
Of this  
Unholy war unholy war  
We try to fight until we die  
  
Unholy  
When youre all alone  Unholy  
With your thoughts of pain  Unholy  
Youre a burning fuse  Unholy  
  
Can you break the strings  Unholy  
Youre shaking in your boots  
You met your end today   
Try walking in my shoes  
  
Youll see weve all got hell to pay  
And we got battle wounds  
In the lions cage  
Well all be Ws  
  
Beneath the numbers on the page   
As we cry til the battle is over
