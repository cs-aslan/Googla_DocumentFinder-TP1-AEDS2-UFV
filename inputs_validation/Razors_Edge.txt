Never callin unanswered letters  
How you been feelin better  
Never lookin but youre hearin  
Never speakin but youre feeling  
All the silence and its wounding  
Youre not healing just concealing  
  
Play the game play the game  
  
Chorus  
Oh brother to brother all the blood runs red  
Dont roll over dont play dead  
Were all livin on the razors edge  
  
Oh brother to brother all the blood runs ruby red  
Were all victims of the razors edge  
  
All the rules dont mean a thing  
Theyre wasting time  
The memries sting  
Keep your image plant that smile  
Answer questions dont let on  
Make up stories all put on  
Thats your life oh  
Your life is gone  
  
Chorus  
  
You see youre losing yet you still try  
The game just a watches your life go by  
  
Youre playin well  
Youre playin why  
Oh play the game  
  
You see youre losing yet you still try  
The game just awatches your life go by  
Youre playin well  
Oh youre playin the game  
  
Chorus
