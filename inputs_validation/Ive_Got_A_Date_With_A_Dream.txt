Ive got a date with a dream  
A dream divine  
Ive got a date with a dream  
Who may be mine  
  
Ive got to hurry and dress  
To meet him at seven  
When any old corner becomes a corner  
Of heaven blue heaven  
  
Im gonna dance with a dream  
Well dance on air  
Im gonna speak to a dream  
And tell him I care  
  
And when the evening is over  
Ill kiss him goodnight and then  
Ill have a date with a dream  
And meet him all over again
