Im not going down on my knees  
Begging you to adore me  
Can you see its misery  
And torture for me  
When Im missunderstood  
Try as hard as you can  
Ive tried the hardest I could  
To make you see  
How important it is for me  
Here is a plea  
From my heart to you  
Nobody knows me  
As well as you do  
You know how hard it is for me  
To shake the disease  
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these  
Understand me  
  
Some people have to be  
Permanently together  
Lovers devoted to each other forever  
Now Ive got things to do  
And Ive said before  
That I know you have too  
When Im not there  
In spirit Ill be there  
Here is a plea  
From my heart to you  
Nobody knows me  
As well as you do  
You know how important is for me  
To shake the disease  
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these  
Understand me  
  
Here is a plea  
From my heart to you  
Nobody knows me  
As well as you do  
You know how hard it is for me  
  
To shake the disease  
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these
