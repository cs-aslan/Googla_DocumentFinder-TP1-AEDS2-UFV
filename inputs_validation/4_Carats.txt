The doors unlocked  
And you dont even have to knock  
Or you can use the fireplace  
Ill be waiting either way  
  
You come and go  
And no one is supposed to know  
But ever since you caught my stare  
You know I know that you are real  
  
Well Santa Ive been thinking  
And Im just in need one thing  
You to bring me something shiny  
  
Like diamond ring  
Just a little something from Tiffanys  
Or a big ruby  
You know that has always looked good on me  
  
I wont tell I wontt tell anyone  
Anyone  
Ive been good all year long  
Oh Santa make my Christmas Eve  
4 Carats please  
  
Oh oh  
Oh  
  
Its getting late  
I know you have your rounds to make  
But Ive been waiting up for you  
And now the clock has just struck 2  
  
Im looking out my windows  
Looking for a red nose  
My hearts sinking  
Dont forget me  
  
Oh my diamond ring  
Just a little something from Tiffanys  
Or a big ruby  
You know that has always looked good on me  
  
I wont tell I wontt tell anyone  
Anyone  
Ive been good all year long  
Oh Santa make my Christmas Eve  
4 Carats please  
  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
  
Mm something sparkly  
Yellow canaries  
Ooh yea yea  
Mm Im waiting patiently  
Santa dont forget me  
Ooh dont forget me  
  
Oh my diamond ring  
Just a little something from Tiffanys  
Or a big ruby  
You know that has always looked good on me  
  
I wont tell I wontt tell anyone  
Anyone  
Ive been good all year long  
Oh Santa make my Christmas Eve  
4 Carats please  
  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh
