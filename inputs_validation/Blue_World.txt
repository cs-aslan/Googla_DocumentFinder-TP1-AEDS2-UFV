Heart and soul took control  
Took control of me  
Paid my dues spread the news  
Hands across the sea  
Put me down turned me round  
Turned me round to see  
Marble halls open doors  
Someone found the key  
And its only what you do  
That keeps coming back on you  
And its only what you say  
That can give yourself away  
Underground sight and sound  
Human symphony  
Heard the voice had no choice  
Needed to be free  
Fly me high touch the sky  
Left the earth below  
Heard the line saw the sign  
Knew which way to go  
cause its easier to try  
Than to prove it cant be done  
And its easier to stay  
Than to turn around and run  
Its a blue world  
It takes somebody to help somebody  
Oh its a blue world  
Its a new world  
It needs somebody to love somebody  
Oh its a blue world  
Heart and soul took control  
Took control of me  
Paid my dues spread the news  
Hands across the sea  
Put me down turned me round  
Turned me round to see  
Marble halls open doors  
Someone found the key  
And its only what you do  
That keeps coming back on you  
And its only what you say  
That can give yourself away  
cause its easier to try  
Than to prove it cant be done  
And its easier to stay  
Than to turn around and run  
Its a blue world  
It takes somebody to help somebody  
Oh its a blue world  
Its a new world  
It needs somebody to love somebody  
Oh its a blue world  
Its a blue world  
It takes somebody to help somebody  
Oh its a blue world  
Its a new world  
It needs somebody to love somebody  
Oh its a blue world
