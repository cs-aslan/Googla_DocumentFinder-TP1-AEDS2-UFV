Didnt I say  
I wasnt ready for romance  
Didnt we promise  
We would only be friends  
And so we danced  
Though it was only a slow dance  
I started breaking my promises right there and then  
  
Didnt I swear  
There would be no complications  
Didnt you want  
Someone whos seen it all before  
Now that youre here  
Its not the same situation  
Suddenly I dont remember the rules anymore  
  
This night is mine  
Its only you and I  
Tomorrow is a long time away  
This night can last forever  
  
Ive been around  
Someone like me should know better  
Falling in love  
Would be the worst thing I could do  
Didnt I say  
I needed time to forget her  
Arent you running  
From someone whos not over you  
  
How many nights  
Have I been lonely without you  
I tell myself  
How much I really dont care  
How many nights  
Have I been thinking about you  
Wanting to hold you  
But knowing you would not be there  
  
But this night youre mine  
Its only you and I  
Ill tell you to forget yesterday  
This night we are together  
  
This night is mine  
Its only you and I  
Tomorrow is a long time away  
This night can last forever  
  
This night  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
Tomorrow is such a long time away  
This night can last forever
