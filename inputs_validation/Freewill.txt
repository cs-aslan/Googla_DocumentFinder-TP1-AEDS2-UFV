There are those who think that life  
Has nothing left to chance  
With a host of holy horrors  
To direct our aimless dance  
  
A planet of playthings  
We dance on the strings  
Of powers we cannot perceive  
The stars arent aligned  
Or the gods are malign  
Blame is better to give than receive  
  
You can choose a ready guide  
In some celestial voice  
If you choose not to decide  
You still have made a choice  
  
You can choose from phantom fears  
And kindness that can kill  
I will choose a path thats clear  
I will choose free will  
  
There are those who think that  
Theyve been dealt a losing hand  
The cards were stacked against them  
They werent born in LotusLand  
  
All preordained  
A prisoner in chains  
A victim of venomous fate  
Kicked in the face  
You cant pray for a place  
In heavens unearthly estate  
  
Each of us  
A cell of awareness  
Imperfect and incomplete  
Genetic blends  
With uncertain ends  
On a fortune hunt  
Thats far too fleet
