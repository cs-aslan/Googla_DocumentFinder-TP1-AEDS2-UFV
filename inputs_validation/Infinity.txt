Got a hole in my head  
Everything falls right out  
Through my ears through my eyes  
Makes no difference where you are  
You wanna know how I do it  
I do it all right  
You wanna know how I do it  
I do it all right  
I got a hole and Ill never go home  
There aint nothing can fill it up  
I got a hole and Ill never go home  
There aint no one thing  
A new road a new road  
A new road a new road  
You never get right back  
A new road  
You never get it right back  
A new road  
You wanna know how I do it  
You wanna know how I do it  
You wanna know how I do it  
I do it all right  
I gotta hole and Ill never go home  
There aint nothing that can fill it up  
I gotta hole and Ill never go home  
There aint no one thing out there  
Not me with a gun to my head  
I can let it go  
Not me with a gun to my head  
I can let it go  
So I sing
