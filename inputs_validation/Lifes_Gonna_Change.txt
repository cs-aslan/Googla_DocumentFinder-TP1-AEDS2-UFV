Just like tarzanswinging on a vineI move hard left then come back rightMy
life is like a bommerang flowIts far away then its right back homeThe
giant pendulum is swinging to and froThis road were riding on where does it
goAnd maybe soon is gone end than you never know  
  
Chorus  
Hard as I try to get all arrangedLifes gonna changeuhhJust when im used
to the pouring rainThats when the sun starts shinin againLifes Gonna
Change  
  
Why not smilewhile you got your smileThe tears might comeMight last a
whileMight as well livewhile you got your life cause its a little too late
when its time to dieThe giant pendulum is ticking off the daysI only blink
and may have passed awayAnd thats why anytime i turn around its been
amazed  
  
Repeat Chorus  
Just When Im Used To The Pouring RainThats when the sun starts shinin
againLifes Gonna Change  
  
Instrumental  
Sun is gonna shine on me  
  
Repeat Chorus  
Just when im used to the pourin rainThats when the sun starts shinin
againLife is gonna changeRepeat ChorusSings Lifes gonna change till
fadeRepeat Chorus Till Fades
