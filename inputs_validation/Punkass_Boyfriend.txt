So you stayed in my house for about a year  
Ate my food and you drank my beer  
You took my money kept asking for more  
When you disappeared didnt close the door baby  
Wuzzup Wuzzup  
Wuzzup Wuzzup  
Its your punk ass boyfriend  
Then you came around and I bought you a brand new car  
I said I loved you didnt get me very far  
Then another round of give me that and give me this  
Then boom you were gone I got the total dis  
Wuzzup Wuzzup
