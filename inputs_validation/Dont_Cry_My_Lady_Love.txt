Dont Cry My Lady Love by Quicksilver Messenger Service  
Dont cry my sweet love  
You know how I cant stand you crying  
All right my lady love  
I know you have heart begin tryin  
  
Some day in the morning  
When the sunshine wont shine in your window  
You may remember  
That I was the sun in your window  
  
But these things happen all the time  
Theyre always the same  
Ones always crying  
And ones always easing the pain  
  
You say goodbye my lady love  
I dont want the memories to haunt you  
Just look in my eyes babe  
You can change my mind if you want to  
  
But some day that someone  
That you never cared for will start again  
You may remember  
The one boy you wont share your heart with  
  
But these things happen  
And theyre never right on time  
Ones always leavin  
And ones always changin his mind  
  
Another time another place  
Youll know that Id really love you  
Dry your eyes my funny face  
Another place another world about you  
  
Dont you remember  
The way that you once tried to leave me  
And maybe some day  
You may know you really didnt need me  
  
But these things happen all the time  
Theyre always the same  
Ones always crin  
And ones always takin the blame  
Ones always crin  
And ones always takin the blame
