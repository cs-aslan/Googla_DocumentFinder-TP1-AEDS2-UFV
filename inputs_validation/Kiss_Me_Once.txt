Well win a war  
Well be   
Do you feel me  
  
Theres a look in your eyes  
Something is up tonight  
I can feel it  
  
The air is thin  
Were scent of it  
And the dam wont break  
One tear falls tension cracks the walls  
Then relief comes  
  
Me and you  
Baby we made it through  
Me and you  
Weve got some loving to do  
Kiss me once  
And you will watch me fall  
Kiss me twice  
And I will give you my all  
  
Look were still up  
Like twosome should do  
Do you feel me  
Come out for air  
Its dark in there  
Do you love me  
  
Am I broke up  
Its to my rocks  
Tell the face babe  
One tear falls falls tension cracks the walls  
Then relief comes  
  
Me and you  
Baby we made it through  
Me and you  
Weve got some loving to do  
Kiss me once  
And you will watch me fall  
Kiss me twice  
And I will give you my all  
  
Me and you  
Baby we made it through  
Me and you  
Weve got some loving to do  
Kiss me once  
And you will watch me fall  
Kiss me twice  
And I will give you my all
