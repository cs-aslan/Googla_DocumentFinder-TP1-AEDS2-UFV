Theres a light  
A certain kind of light  
That never shone on me  
I want my life to be lived with you  
Lived with you  
  
Theres a waytheres a way everybody say  
To do each and every little thing  
But what does it bring  
If I aint got you If I aint got you  
If I aint got you If I aint got you  
  
Baby you dont know what its like  
Baby you dont know what its like  
To love somebody

The way I love you  
  
In my brain  
I see your face again  
I know my frame of mind  
You aint got to be so blind  
And Im blind yeah Im blind  
  
Im a man  
Cant you see what I am  
I live and breathe for you  
But what good does it do  
If I aint got you If I aint got you  
If I aint got you If I aint got you
