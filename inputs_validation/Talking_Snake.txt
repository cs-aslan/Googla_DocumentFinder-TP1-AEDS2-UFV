Look what you have done  
Ruined every single one  
See what fools they are  
Jealous of a simple star  
  
Feel the 4 winds blow  
Let the sword hang low baby  
Lifes to take  
Says the talking snake  
Everybody should be happy  
Lifes to take  
Says the talking snake  
Everybody should be happy  
To tell the sucking truth  
Everybodys dreams get used  
  
Twist me till I drip  
Liquid of emotions ripped  
  
Every hungry soul  
Hides a hungry fool baby  
Lifes to take  
Says the talking snake  
Everybody should be happy  
Lifes to take  
Says the talking snake  
Everybody should be happy  
Feel the 4 winds blow  
Let the sword hang low baby  
  
Lifes to take  
Says the talking snake  
Everybody should be happy  
Lifes to take  
Says the talking snake  
Everybody should be happy  
Should be happy  
Should be happy
