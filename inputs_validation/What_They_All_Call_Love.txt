It aint about you it aint about me  
Its about this love we found that has to be  
I never questioned that look in your eyes  
And you never doubted how I felt inside  
  
Chorus  
We found passion and grace in each others face  
And our hearts will now beat as one  
For we both know a place where our souls have embraced  
I think its what they all call love  
  
This gift youve given humbles me  
True companions well always be  
For so long weve waited to feel what we feel  
Weve finally tasted something thats real  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I think its what they all call love
