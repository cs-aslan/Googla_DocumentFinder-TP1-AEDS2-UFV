Chorus  
I wont get my crime around  
I hustle baby  
I stay down every time no day  
I hustle baby  
From the track or the trap fo sand  
I hustle baby  
No day I hustle baby no day gotta hustle baby  
I wont get my crime around

From the track or the trap for sand  
I hustle baby  
No day I hustle baby no day gotta hustle baby  
  
Im a crime time hustler man I tried to tell em  
My crew cause its the exconvict convicted fellon  
Banana clips bazmellons of all these stitches telling  
The bitches of bazballers and secrets of shotcallers  
Of better rounds of scopping he said lue atown to Oakland  
Niggas praying and hoping they dont get caught with dope and  
Out a catin and a cripping in Chicago they folking  
Down south we got 36 oles traping and focus  
This is no hocus pocus play the game like locus  
Players vibe up and whittin Im the third cosmoses  
  
Chorus  
  
My pimping is old school and they Chevy with bleak shoes  
Tip tops and flip flops Adidas and suede pumas  
Who nigga fo like whyall they never going change that  
They slang goin where I hang and my bitches they whodarest  
And we all drink doduces of dat go for 5  
Well put that hot heat like between your eyes  
And I keep it under the seat in the summer they sweating me  
Coming down your street with beat sitting on some chesly feet  
Outta town in thats gold rims for shawty be serving them  
Everytime my Chevy stop my rims they still spin  
Atown for life whyall we never going change that  
Still roll with them dope boys on the bow with them Js at
