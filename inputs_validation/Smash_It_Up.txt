Weve been playing now for much too long  
And never gonna dance to a different song  
Im gonna scream and shout till my dying breath  
Im gonna smash it up till theres nothing left  
  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
  
People call me weird oh its such a shame  
Maybe its my clothes must be to blame  
I dont even care if I look a mess  
Dont want to be a sucker like all the rest  
  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Smash it up  
  
Smash it up  
Smash it up  
Smash it up  
  
Smash it up  
And you can keep your crystal glasses  
Smash it up  
And you can see a very deadway end  
Smash it up  
And you can stick a frothy lager  
Smash it up  
Up the fuck with your lesson  
  
Weve been playing now for much too long  
And never gonna dance to a different song  
Im gonna scream and shout till my dying breath  
Im gonna smash it up till theres nothing left  
  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Smash it up  
  
And everybodys smashing things down  
I said everybodys smashing things down
