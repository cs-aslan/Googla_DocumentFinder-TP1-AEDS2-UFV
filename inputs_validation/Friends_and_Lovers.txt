Im a neer do well  
Runnin off black and gold  
Its high time I pulled over  
And walked around a while  
  
Ive seen that porcelain shell  
Erect some skeleton  
And I feel like wed walk well together  
Because in the end we are friends and lovers  
  
If asked of me I would  
Gobble them to bits  
The things that wall us off from  
Where we belong  
  
Whats wrong with you is good  
For whats wrong with me  
And I think maybe we should stick together  
Because in the end we are friends and lovers  
We are friends and lovers  
  
Abandon all the bold  
Weve got to pick  
They only weigh us down and  
Were better than that  
  
If they all throw stones  
Start a collection  
Of everything were not  
And whats because  
You should never have to defend  
Being friends and lovers  
  
Being friends and lovers  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Being friends and lovers
