Im walking out in a forceten gale  
Birds thrown around bullets for hail  
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails  
Your voice is rapping on my windowsill  
  
Yesterdays headlines blown by the wind  
Yesterdays people in a scatterbrain  
Any fool can easy pick a hole  
I wish I could fall in  
A moving target in a firing range  
  
Somewhere Im not  
Scatterbrain  
Somewhere Im not  
Scatterbrain  
Lightning fuse powercut  
Scatterbrain
