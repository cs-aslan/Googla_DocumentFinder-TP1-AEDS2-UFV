If you ever had a clue  
You never acted like you knew  
When you took away the reasons  
And you chopped my heart in two  
Once you start to doubt  
  
When you dont know what its about  
Its time to read the warning signs  
Of a man turned inside out  
For a guy needs a good reason  
Something to prod him on  
When you chopped me up like liver  
It all started going wrong  
So I bought a fiberglass helmet  
Some goggles to match  
  
Im a human bullet baby  
And you havent seen the last  
Of a man turned inside out  
Im a man turned inside out  
So I got myself a position  
And Im working my way up  
Took a three way lucky number  
Now Im heading for the top
