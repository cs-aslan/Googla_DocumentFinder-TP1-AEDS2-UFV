You felt the coldness in my eyes  
And its something Im not revealing  
Though you got used to my disguise  
You cant shake this awful feeling  
  
Its the me that I let you know  
Cause Ill never show I have my reasons  
I hate to say that I told you so  
But I told you so yeah  
  
Theres blood on my hands  
Like the blood in you  
Some things cant be treated  
So dont make me dont make me be myself around you  
  
Straight from your eyes its burying me  
Beautifully so disfigured  
This other side that you cant see  
Just praying you wont remember  
  
Feel the pain that I never show  
And I hope you know its never healing  
I hate to say that I told you so  
But I told you so yeah  
  
Theres blood on my hands  
Like the blood in you  
Some things cant be treated  
So dont make me dont make me be myself around you  
  
Straight from your eyes its burying me  
Beautifully so disfigured  
This other side that you cant see  
Just praying you wont remember  
  
Theres blood theres blood  
Theres blood blood blood  
  
Theres blood on my hands  
Like the blood in you  
Some things cant be treated  
So dont make me dont make me be myself around you  
  
Theres blood on my hands  
Theres blood  
Like the blood in you  
Theres blood  
  
Some things cant be treated  
Theres blood  
So dont make me dont make me be myself around you  
  
Theres blood
