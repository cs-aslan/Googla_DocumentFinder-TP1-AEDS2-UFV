She doesnt own a dress her hair is always a mess  
If you catch her stealin she wont confess  
Shes beautiful she smokes a pack a day wait thats me but anyway  
She doesnt care a thing about that hey  
She thinks Im beautiful Meet Virginia  
  
She never compromises loves babies and surprises  
Wears hiheels when she exercises  
Aint that beautiful  
Meet Virginia  
  
Well she wants to be the Queen  
Then she thinks about her scene  
Pulls her hair back as she screams  
I dont really wanna be the queen  
  
Her daddy wrestles alligators Mama works on carburetors  
Her brother is a fine mediator for the President  
Well here she is again on the phone  
Just like me hates to be alone  
We just like to sit at home and rip on the President  
  
Meet Virginia  
Well she wants to live her life  
Then she thinks about her life  
Pulls her hair back as she screams  
I dont really wanna live this life  
  
She only drinks coffee at midnight when the moment is not  
Right her timing is quite unusual  
You see her confidence is tragic but her intuition magic  
And the shape of her body unusual  
  
Meet Virgina I cant wait to  
Meet Virginia yeah e yeah hey hey hey  
  
Well she wants to be the queen and  
Then she thinks about her scene  
Well she wants to live her life  
Then she thinks about her life  
Pulls her hair back as she screams  
I dont really wanna be the queen  
I I dont really wanna be the queen  
I I dont really wanna be the queen  
I I dont really wanna live this
