Shes right peculiar  
Shell try and fool ya  
But the girl keeps coming apart  
Shes so appealing  
Right off the ceiling  
But the girl keeps coming apart  
What did I tell ya  
Shell buy and sell ya  
Cause the girl keeps coming apart  
Shes so affected  
Im so rejected  
And the girl keeps coming apart  
Dont dont dont dont let it get me down  
Dont let it get me down  
Shes just a screamer  
A nightmare dreamer  
Yeah the girl keeps coming apart  
Shes like a call girl  
Loose ends and all girl  
But the girl keeps coming apart  
White lace and leather  
Shes so together  
But still the girl keeps coming apart  
I feel sedated  
Boxed up an crated  
Cause the girl keeps coming apart  
Dont dont dont dont dont dont  
Dont let it get me down  
Dont let it get me down  
So there she was  
Buns up and kneelin  
I was a wheelin and a dealin  
My ace in the hole so to speak
