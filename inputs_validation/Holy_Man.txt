Called to Madonna  
To give me a line  
She said boy what have you done  
Passing your time with a holy man  
Talking about the moon and sun  
But I cant tell the difference  
Between the fool and wise  
Show me a river to follow  
Away from all these lies  
  
Ive been on my own so long  
Wont you lend me your hand  
Ive been picking up my bones too long  
Wont you understand  
  
Called to the captain  
To put me ashore  
For it looked like no mans land  
Is this the way to follow  
I cried as I shook his hand  
He told me had no answer  
He didnt really hold the key  
I am a simple man  
Was all he said to me  
  
Ive been on my own so long  
Wont you lend me a hand  
Ive been out in the cold too long  
Wont you understand  
Ive been on the road so long  
Wont you lend me your hand  
Ive been out in the cold too long  
Wont you understand  
  
Heard my mother crying  
She was calling out my name  
Whisper in the dark night  
Saying whos to blame  
The hour glass keeps turning  
With not enough sand to see  
I am a holy man  
So dont you bother me  
  
Ive been on my own so long  
Wont you lend me your hand  
Ive been pickin up my bones too long  
Wont you understand  
Ive been on my own so long  
Wont you lend me your hand  
Ive been out in the cold too long  
Wont you understand
