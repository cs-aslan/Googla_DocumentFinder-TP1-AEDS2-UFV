Hold it now  
Wait a minute  
Come on whew  
Just let me catch my breath  
Ive heard the promises  
Ive seen the mistakes  
Ive had my fair share of tough breaks  
I need a new voice a new law a new way  
Take the time reevaluate  
Its time to pick up the pieces  
Go back to square one  
I think its time for a change  
  
There is something that I feel  
To be something that is real  
I feel the heat within my mind  
And craft new changes with my eyes  
Giving freely wandering promises  
A place with decisions Ill fashion  
I wont waste another breath  
  
You can feel the waves coming on  
Its time to take the time  
Let them destroy you or carry you on  
Its time to take the time  
Youre fighting the weight of the world  
But no one can save you this time  
Close your eyes  
You can find all you need in your mind  
  
The unbroken spirit obscured and disquiet  
Finds clearness this trial demands  
And at the end of this day sighs an anxious relief  
For the fortune lies still in his hands  
If theres a pensive fear a wasted year  
A man must learn to cope  
If his obsessions real  
Suppression that he feels must turn to hope  
  
Life is no more assuring than love  
Its time to take the time  
There are no answers from voices above  
Its time to take the time  
Youre fighting the weight of the world  
And no one can save you this time  
Close your eyes  
You can find all you need in your mind  
  
I close my eyes  
And feel the water rise around me  
Drown the beat of time  
Let my senses fall away  
I can see much clearer now Im blind  
  
Ora che ho perso la vista  
Ci vedo di piu  
  
You can feel the waves coming on  
Its time to take the time  
Let them destroy you or carry you on  
Its time to take the time  
Youre fighting the weight of the world  
But no one can save you this time  
Close your eyes  
You can find all you need in your mind  
  
Find all you need in your mind  
If you take the time  
Find all you need in your mind  
If you take the time
