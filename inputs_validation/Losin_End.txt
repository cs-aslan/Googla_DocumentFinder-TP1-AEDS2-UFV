There arent enough words to say  
When all I mean is I no longer love you  
Id like to leave it lie right there  
For the rest aint kind  
Im pickin up my pride and Ill be on my way  
If you no longer need me  
I only had a word or two that I care to say  
Listen baby  
If you should ever find your spirit start to breaking  
When your heart is aching  
Remember me  
I was your fool for really quite a long time  
Til I found out how it feels to play  
On the losing end  
  
When you finally turn and find  
No one around to catch you when youre falling  
To hear you when youre calling  
Oh remember me oh darlin  
When you finally turn and find  
  
No one around  
To catch you when youre falling  
To hear you when youre calling  
From down on the losin end  
Oh aint it just the losin end
