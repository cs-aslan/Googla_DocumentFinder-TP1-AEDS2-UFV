People raise your voices dont get caught in that mess  
Like a fly in a spiders web is it true more is less  
Herded like a happy flock to the big TV slaughter  
Why dont you break that leash said the heifer to the sheep  
Its a new generation  
Its a hallucination  
Its a mystic vibration  
Its just intimidation  
Its the will of the people  
Its the church with the steeple  
Its the sacred devotion  
To an unhealthy notion  
People raise your voices dont get into that trap  
If your friends and your neighbors push  
Why dont you push them back  
Dont you think the time has come  
To stand up and be heard  
Aint no use to try and wait  
For the magic word  
Its a new generation  
Its an infatuation  
Its a beautiful body  
Both erotic and deadly  
Its the fear of the future  
Its just surgeons and sutures  
Its a spandex obsession  
Its a lasting impression  
Do you feel the power  
Do you feel the power  
Baptized in electronic water  
Prodigal sons and beautiful daughters  
With smiles and bows and rosy cheeks  
And the righteous bath  
Death to the freaks  
Do you feel the power  
Do you feel the power  
From the man whose voice sounds reassuring  
Completely firm and so alluring Likes hes lived a thousand times before  
And seen the world from shore to shore  
With the calmness and tranquility that oozes credibility  
With the wisdom and the confidence that seem to scream out common sense  
And it makes you feel just like a babe  
Daddy holding you tight and safe  
Hush babe everythings all right Daddys gonna stay with you tonight  
Now hes got you by the balls he can sell you anything at all  
From morality to diamond rings to genocide to magazines  
From religion to cosmology to the end of a democracy  
Its a new generation  
Its a divine inspiration  
Always ready to follow  
Ever willing to swallow  
All the doctors prescriptions  
All the mystic inscriptions  
Its the spandex obsession  
Its a lasting impression  
Its the calm meditation  
Of a tranquilized nation  
Its a hallucination  
Its a new generation
