I see you walking a vision of light  
But like an illusion your beauty fades into the night  
Youve got the body youve got the moves  
Youve them oh baby I know that aint really you  
If I could get through get you out of your shell  
Its the heart in you girl  
  
Come to my world  
Where love and your freedom  
Come dance to my rhythm  
The rhythm of love  
Come to my world  
Where you can be real  
And express how you feel  
Cos I know you want to be loved  
  
Something magic about tonight  
Ooh you hide your emotions and wait till the moment is right  
Cos once some music gets in your soul  
Yeah its just human nature I know that youll want to let go  
If I could get through its the heart in you girl  
Bring you down to my world  
  
Wont you come in now baby  
The rhythm drives you crazy  
Just pick it up and set it free  
  
Ah oh ah oh ah oh ah oh
