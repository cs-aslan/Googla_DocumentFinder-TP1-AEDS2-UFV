If Im so lost without a friend  
Tell me whos this by my side  
This girl with eyes like gems  
And cool reactions to your lies  
Lies  
La la la la la la lies  
  
You cant repeat what you put round  
All the things that made me cry  
You kicked me when I was down  
And they hurt me all those lies  
Lies  
La la la la la la lies  
  
Ive got my girl and together were strong  
To laugh at you and prove you wrong  
  
I dont insist that you feel bad  
I just want to see you smile  
Dont ever think you made me mad  
I didnt listen to your lies  
Lies  
La la la la la la lies  
  
If Im so lost without a friend  
Tell me whos this by my side  
This girl with eyes like gems  
And cool reactions to your lies  
Lies  
La la la la la la lies  
  
I dont insist that you feel bad  
I just want to see you smile  
Dont ever think you made me mad  
I didnt listen to your lies  
Lies  
La la la la la la lies
