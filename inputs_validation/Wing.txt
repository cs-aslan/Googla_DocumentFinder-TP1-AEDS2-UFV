I was a wing in heaven blue  
Soared over the ocean  
Soared over Spain  
And I was free  
Needed nobody  
It was beautiful  
It was beautiful  
  
I was a pawn  
Didnt have a move  
Didnt have nowhere  
That I could go  
But I was free  
I needed nobody  
It was beautiful  
It was beautiful  
  
And if theres one thing  
Could do for you  
Youd be a wing  
In heaven blue  
  
I was a vision  
In another eye  
And they saw nothing  
No future at all  
Yet I was free  
I needed nobody  
It was beautiful  
It was beautiful  
  
And if theres one thing  
Could do for you  
Youd be a wing  
In heaven blue  
  
And if theres one thing  
Could do for you  
Youd be a wing  
In heaven blue  
  
And if theres one thing  
Could do for you  
Youd be a wing  
In heaven blue
