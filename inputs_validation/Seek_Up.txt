Sometimes I feel like Im falling  
Fall back again fall back again  
Fall back again fall back again  
  
Oh life it seems a struggle between  
What we think what we see  
Im not going to change my ways  
Just to please you or appease you  
Inside a crowd five billion proud  
Willing to punch it out  
Right wrong weak strong  
Ashes to ashes all fall down  
Look around about this round  
About this merrygoround around  
If at all Gods gaze upon us fall  
His mischievous grin look at him  
  
Forget about the reasons and  
The treasons we are seeking  
Forget about the notion that  
Our emotions can be swept away  
Forget about being guilty  
We are innocent instead  
For soon we will all find our lives swept away  
  
Sit awhile with TVs hungry child  
Big belly swelled  
Oh for a price of a coke or a smoke  
Keep alive those hungry eyes  
Take a look at me what you see in me  
Mirror look at me  
Face it all face it all again  
  
Forget about the reasons and  
The treasons we are seeking  
Forget about the notion that your emotions can be  
Swept away kept at bay  
Forget about being guilty I am innocent instead  
For soon we will all find our lives swept away  
  
You seek up an emotion  
And our cup is overflowing  
You seek up an emotion  
Sometimes your well is dry  
You seek up a big monster  
For him to fight your wars for you  
But when he finds his way to you the devils not  
Goingha ha  
  
Say say  
Look at me in my fancy car  
And my bank account  
Oh how I wish I could take it all down  
Into my grave Id save  
Take a look again take a look again  
Take a look again  
Everyday things changestay the same  
  
Forget about the reasons and  
The treasons we are seeking  
Forget about the notion that  
Your emotions can be swept away  
Intentions are not wicked  
Dont be tricked into thinking so  
Soon we will all find our lives swept away  
  
You seek up an emotion  
And our cup is overflowing  
You seek up an emotion  
Sometimes your well is dry  
You seek up a big monster  
For him to fight your wars for you  
But when he finds his way to you  
The devils not goingha ha  
Fall back again fall back again fall back again
