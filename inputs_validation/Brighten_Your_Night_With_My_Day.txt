Daybreak finds you up  
And alive just as though  
You could touch a star  
But sunset seems to leave you weary  
Alone and wondering who you are  
Dont deny that lonely feeling babe  
That keeps stealing on you from deep down inside  
Hey cant you see that its no good  
Concealing a feeling it hurts you to hide  
  
When you can come home to me  
Yes Im happy to hear  
What youve got to say to me baby all the way  
Girl you can count on me  
Watch those shadows fade away  
And brighten your night with my day  
  
Daybreak sunset hot and cold  
Running smiles and tears  
A bright outside to match your foolish pride  
But not a word for the lonely years  
Please come back home to me  
Now you wont have to say  
That youll stay with me baby  
No its not that way  
Just come back home to me  
Watch those shadows fade away  
And brighten your night with my daybreak  
Sunset you dont have to cry no more  
Now everythings gonna be just fine  
Watch out baby here it comes  
Right around the corner here it comes  
Just brighten your night with my day
