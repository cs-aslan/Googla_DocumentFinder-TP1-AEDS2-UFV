My babys gone I have no one who needs me anymore  
I cant go on I have no one to love me anymore  
Time on my hands you on my mind giving in the broken dreams you left behind  
Wherever I go whatever I do my heart keeps blinding me reminding me were
through  
My babys gone  
You took my hand and turned away leaving me within the walls of yesterday  
Wherever I go whatever I do theres no use trying I guess Ill never forget
you  
My babys gone
