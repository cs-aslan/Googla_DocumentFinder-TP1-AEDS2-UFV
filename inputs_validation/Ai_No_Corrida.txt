I hold you I touch you  
In a maze cant find my way  
I think you I drink you  
Im being served you on a tray  
You see girl  
Thats what I go through every day  
Is this the way it should feel  
  
Pinch me Im dreaming  
But if it is dont let me know  
Im drowning dont save me  
Its just the way Id like to go  
You see girl  
You thrill me half kill me  
Thats what you do  
  
Ai no corrida thats where I am  
You send me there  
You dream is my command  
Ai no corrida I find myself  
No other thought  
Just you and nothing else  
You and nothing else  
  
Before my heart saw you  
Each day was just another day  
Night the lonely interlude  
Just came then blew away  
You know girl  
Everything was come what may  
Until you fell in my life  
  
This spell Im under  
Has caught me Im in a daze  
Your lightning and thunder  
Sets my poor heart ablaze  
You see girl  
You thrill me half kill me  
Thats what you do  
  
Ai no corrida thats where I am  
You send me there  
You dream is my command  
Ai no corrida I find myself  
No other thought  
Just you and nothing else  
You and nothing else  
  
Ai no corrida thats where I am  
You send me there  
You dream is my command  
Ai no corrida I find myself  
No other thought  
Just you and nothing else  
You and nothing else  
  
Ai no corrida thats where I am  
You send me there  
You dream is my command  
Ai no corrida I find myself  
No other thought  
Just you and nothing else  
You and nothing else  
  
I hold you I touch you  
In a maze cant find my way  
I think you I drink you  
Im being served you on a tray  
You see girl  
Thats what I go through every day  
Is this the way it should feel  
  
Pinch me Im dreaming  
But if it is dont let me know  
Im drowning dont save me  
Its just the way Id like to go  
You see girl  
You thrill me half kill me  
Thats what you do  
  
Ai no corrida thats where I am  
You send me there  
You dream is my command  
Ai no corrida I find myself  
No other thought  
Just you and nothing else  
You and nothing else
