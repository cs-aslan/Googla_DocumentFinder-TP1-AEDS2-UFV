If I could make it rain today  
And wash away this sunny day down to the gutter  
I would  
Just to get a change of pace  
Things are getting worse but I feel a lot better  
And thats all that really matters to me  
  
Amy hit the atmosphere  
Caught herself a rocket ride out of this gutter and  
Shes never coming back I fear  
But any time it rains  
She just feels a lot better  
And thats all that really matters to me  
  
Weve waited so long for someone to take us back home  
It just takes so long  
And meanwhile the days go drifting away  
And some of us sink like a stone  
Waiting for mothers to come  
  
There has to be a change Im sure  
Today was just a day fading into another  
And that cant be what a life is for  
The only thing she said was she feels a lot better  
And thats all that really matters to me
