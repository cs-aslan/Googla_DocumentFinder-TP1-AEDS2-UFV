You take a deep breath  
And you walk through the doors  
Its the morning of your very first day  
You say hi to your friends you aint seen in awhile  
Try and stay out of everybodys way  
  
Its your freshman year  
And youre gonna be here for the next four years  
In this town  
Hoping one of those senior boys  
Will wink at you and say you know I havent seen you around before  
  
Cause when youre fifteen  
Somebody tells you they love you  
Youre gonna believe them  
And when youre fifteen  
  
Feeling like theres nothing to figure out  
  
Count to ten  
Take it in  
This is life before you know who youre gonna be  
At fifteen  
  
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail  
And soon enough youre best friends  
Laughing at the other girls  
Who they think theyre so cool  
Well be out of here as soon as we can  
  
And then youre on your very first date  
And hes got a car  
And youre feeling like flying  
And youre mamas waiting up  
And youre thinking hes the one  
And youre dancing around the room when the night ends  
When the night ends  
  
Cause when youre fifteen  
Somebody tells you they love you  
Youre gonna believe them  
And when youre fifteen  
  
And your first kiss makes your head spin around  
  
But in your life youll do things  
Greater than dating the boy on the football team  
But I didnt know it at fifteen  
  
When all you wanted  
Was to be wanted  
Wish you could go back  
And tell yourself what you know now  
  
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday  
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine  
And Abigail gave everything she had  
To a boy who changed his mind  
And we both cried  
  
Cause when youre fifteen  
Somebody tells you they love you  
Youre gonna believe them  
And when youre fifteen  
  
Dont forget to look before you fall  
  
Ive found time can heal most anything  
And you just might find who youre supposed to be  
I didnt know who I was supposed to be  
At fifteen  
  
La la la la la  
Your very first day  
Take a deep breath girl  
And take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
