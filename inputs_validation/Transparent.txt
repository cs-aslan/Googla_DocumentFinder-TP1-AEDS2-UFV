Treating your days like a countdown  
Seconds pass by waiting just to blow up  
And you get nothing done  
And this is what you want  
  
Lost touch and  
You turn your back and your some friend  
Sterile conversation  
Learn to talk a good game  
  
Talk your way out  
Its a sure thing  
Testing the ends of what theyll put up with  
You got your chance to say what you wanted to  
  
But you never do  
Stand up to the ones that keep you down  
Now you can see right through it all  
Lost touch and  
  
Tracing your steps you cant begin  
You cant start  
To say what your thinking and why not  
Talk your way out  
  
Its a sure thing  
Testing the ends of what theyll put up with  
Sticking it out til you cant get up  
How many times have you been pacified  
  
Accepting it when youre told theres no way  
Making sure there never will  
Sticking it out til you cant get up  
How many times have you been pacified  
  
Accepting it when youre told theres no way  
Making sure there never will  
Testing the ends of what they put up with
