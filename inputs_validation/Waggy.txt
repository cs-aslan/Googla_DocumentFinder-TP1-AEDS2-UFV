Watching your house shrink away in my rearview mirror  
As I drive away  
Wishing that I could take back all those words  
That meant nothing that I didnt say  
  
Im trying  
To be what you want me to be  
But its so damn hard to keep playing the part  
Of the fool week after week  
  
I think you need some time alone I think you need some time alone  
You say you want someone to call your own  
Open your eyes you can suck in your pride  
You can live your life all on your own  
  
Is this all going to be just another time  
That we play this game  
Ive tried to convince you that things could be different  
But somehow they end up the same  
  
But what  
Did you expect from me What am I supposed to do  
You say that youre starting to feel like youre getting lost  
Well I do too  
  
I dont wanna live this lie again I dont wanna live this lie again  
I know Ill get it right but I dont know when  
Ill open my eyes Ive got something in side  
Ill just jack off in my room until then  
  
Its never over til its done  
And I dont think that youre the one  
Its never over til its done  
And I dont think that youre the one
