How did we end up ending up this way  
I always thought that we could work it out  
At times I wondered if wed last out the day  
But my love was always stronger  
Stronger than my doubt  
Then here we are are we running out of time  
Weve come so far to leave it all behind  
But thats how I feel  
I wanna know how you feel  
  
Id walk all night for you baby  
Stand in the pourin rain  
But you gotta meet me baby half way  
You know that I dont wanna give up  
Do anything to make you stay  
But you gotta meet me baby half way  
  
I couldnt tell you what you meant to me  
I kept those feelings hidden far away  
And hoped that you could tell by looking at me  
Now you know what you needed  
Is too late to say  
  
That I love you more than I ever knew I could  
And I need you now like I never thought I would  
  
Chorus  
  
I thought about livin my life without you  
In this cold cold world  
Well Im no man of steel  
But Id walk on fire for you  
Thats just how I feel  
  
Chorus
