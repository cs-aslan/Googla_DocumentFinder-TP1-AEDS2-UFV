Oh baby you know that it would be untrue  
Know that I would be a liar  
If I was to say to you  
Hey girl you know we couldnt get much higher  
Hey come on baby light my fire  
Come baby light my fire yeah  
Try to set the night on fire  
The time to hesitate is through  
Theres no time to wallow in the mire  
If we try now we can only lose  
And our love may come a funeral pyre  
Hey hey come on baby light my fire  
Come on baby light my fire yeah  
Try to set the night on fire oh baby baby  
Hey hey come on baby light my fire  
Oh baby come on baby light my fire  
Try to set the night on fire yeah baby oh babe  
You know that it would be untrue  
And you know I would be a liar  
Dont let it Incomprehensible and say to you  
Hey baby we couldnt get much higher  
Hey come on baby light my fire  
Come on baby light my fire baby yeah baby  
Try to set the night on fire oh baby  
Hey come on baby light my fire Incomprehensible  
Come on baby light my fire baby  
Try to set the night on fire oh baby baby
