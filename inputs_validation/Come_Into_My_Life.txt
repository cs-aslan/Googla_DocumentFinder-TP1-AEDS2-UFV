No this isnt easy  
But I cant keep runnin from Your love  
Ive been denying way too long  
That theres something deep inside me  
That takes me down the road that leads me to Your door  
I know that I belong there with You  
My human nature would keep me far away  
But God I really need You  
Im asking You to stay  
  
Chorus  
Come into my life  
Change this heart forever  
Let me feel the healing in Your touch  
Take all my hurt away  
Come into my life  
I surrender all my feelings  
Youve got the love Ive needed all along  
Lord I pray that You will  
Come into my life  
  
Oh Im through pretending  
That Ive got everything a man could ever need  
You know Im tired of the lie  
Yeah I was so independent  
But independence never calmed my soul at night  
Now I close my eyes and peace consumes me  
Your love has shown me  
What it is I need to be  
And when I least expect it  
Love becomes more real  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh I ran from You so long  
Never could leave Your touch  
You loved me day by day  
Never leaving a doubt  
So now Im tired of this fight  
And I need Your strength tonight  
You see Ive never been as ready as I am right now  
  
Chorus
