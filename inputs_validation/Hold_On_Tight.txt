Verse  
So wicked in the way he moves  
Dont miss it do not be a fool  
Its a long way its a long way home  
Light inside of me it ignites my bones  
  
Chorus  
He comes to me in my dreams  
And tells me what I need to know  
He makes me feel so at ease  
And guides me to a light so warm  
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight  
Someone tell me I will be alright  
Ill hold on tight  
  
Verse  
Remembering I forever will  
Surrendering just to how it felt  
Its a long way its a long way home  
Light inside of me it ignites my bones  
  
Chorus  
He comes to me in my dreams  
And tells me what I need to know  
He makes me feel so at ease  
And guides me to a light so warm  
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight  
Someone tell me I will be alright  
Ill hold on tight  
  
Bridge  
And when its over fond going gray  
The cinema is fading away  
I gotta make my way through the night  
Passing on with all of my might  
And then Im lost and I cant find the way  
I feel the pieces breaking away  
Hug myself with all of my might  
Dont look down just hold on tight  
  
Chorus  
He comes to me in my dreams  
And tells me what I need to know  
He makes me feel so at ease  
And guides me to a light so warm  
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight  
Someone tell me I will be alright  
Ill hold on tight
