I saw him turn on  
Like a machine in the park  
Saying please come with me  
But youve been there before  
  
I saw him whirr away  
Into the night  
Like a nightmare on wheels  
Saying never again  
  
Id give it all up for you  
Id even be a number just for you  
The strangest living boy  
You could ever wish to see  
  
thats me  
Yellowed newspapers  
Tell the story of someone  
do you know this man   
  
Tomorrow the cure  
Only police ever  
See night time for real  
Turn on the light  
And cry no more no more  
  
I was standing outside your door  
Waiting for the grey men to go  
When my mind turned on me  
With a vengeance I had never known  
  
My own  
Everyone heard  
The voice on the radio  
Saying why move around  
  
And waste my time  
There are no  
Independents anymore  
The tape is a circle  
But who really cares  
  
I saw you behind the wall  
I even heard you laugh at me  
You disgust me tonight  
With your answer to something new  
Thats you
