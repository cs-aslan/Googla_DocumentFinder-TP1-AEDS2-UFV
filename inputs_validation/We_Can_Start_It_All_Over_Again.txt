Oh babe what can I say to you  
Change what youre feeling inside  
Oh babe Ive got to get close to you  
Please dont cast me aside  
You know I hate to see you looking so sad  
I cant stand to watch this good love go bad  
Lets stop and think about the good times that we had  
  
Chorus  
We can start it all start it all all over again  
And we can have it all have it all just a one more time  
We can start it all start it all all over again oh oh oh oh  
  
Oo babe dont look that way at me  
You know youre breaking my heart  
Oo babe Im as sorry as I can be  
Dont let this tear us apart  
Now lets forget about the tears that we cried  
Its gone there aint nothing to hide  
Come on baby why cant we give it one more try  
  
Chorus  
  
Just think about it babe oh oh oh oh  
Just think about it babe  
Oh baby I acted like a fool  
You just trust me baby and Ill make it up to you  
  
I see your smiles returning  
I know you understand  
Come on baby  
All you got to do is take my hand  
I love you baby were gonna start it all again  
Well have it down like nothing before ah  
  
One more time we can start it all start it all all over again  
We can have it all have it all yeah everything  
We can start it all start it all all over again  
We can have it all have it all yeah everything
