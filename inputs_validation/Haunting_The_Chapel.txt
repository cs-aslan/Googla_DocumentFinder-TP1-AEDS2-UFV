The holy cross  
Symbol of lies  
Intimidate the lives of Christian born  
Speak of death  
The words of hate  
Anticipation grows amongst the dead  
Hell has seen  
The priests attempt  
To bring forth their lord of the cross  
Strike of twelve  
Raise the dead  
The chapel comes under attack  
  
The ghosts of sin  
Torment the priests  
Their altar will soon be destroyed  
Heavens palace  
Turning black  
The church now belongs to the dead  
Blackened magic  
Infest with lust  
Lucifer rules supreme  
The crystal ball shows unknown fate  
The last thing thats heard is the screams  
  
Ghosts from hell invade this feeble shrine  
Heavens holy house will fall in time  
Satans morbid soldiers chant in lust  
Destruction of the church well burn the cross  
  
Attacking angels as they pray to god  
Tormented preachers hail the twisted cross  
Haunting the chapel  
Hells demons prevail  
Death has come  
The house of god has failed
