When I watched you walk with him  
Tears filled my eyes  
And when I heard you talk with him  
I couldnt stand his lies  
And now before he tries it  
I hope you realize it girl  
  
Let him run wild  
He dont care baby  
Let him run  
Let him run wild  
Hell find out baby  
Let him run  
Let him run run run run wild baby  
  
Guess you know I waited for you girl  
Hell do the same to other girls  
That he did to you  
Then one day hell run in to one  
Thats gonna hurt him too  
So before he makes you over  
Im gonna take you over  
  
Let him run wild  
He dont care baby  
Let him run  
Let him run wild  
Hell find out baby  
Let him run  
Let him run run run run wild baby  
  
Guess you know I waited for you girl  
All the dreams you shared with him  
You might as well forget  
I know you need a truer love  
And thats what youll get  
And now that you dont need him  
Well he can have his freedom  
  
Let him run wild  
He dont care baby  
Let him run  
Let him run wild  
Hell find out baby  
Let him run  
Let him run run run run wild baby  
Let him run  
Let him run run run run wild baby  
Let him run  
Let him run run run run wild baby  
Let him run
