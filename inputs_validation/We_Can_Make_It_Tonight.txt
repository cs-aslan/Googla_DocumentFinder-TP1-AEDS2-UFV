Im counting on you  
Gotta know the time has come to follow through  
Drive straight through the night  
Just hold on we can make it home before daylight  
  
Theres a voice inside you  
And you know it cant be wrong  
So break away from this pain girl  
Weve held out much too long  
  
Chorus  
We can make it tonight  
If you give me the sign  
And Ill be by your side  
Ive got the feeling its right  
We can make it in time  
We can make it tonight  
  
Fear nothing at all  
Ya gotta know that nothing is impossible  
The things Ive seen with these eyes  
Precious dreams  
That somehow you dont realize  
  
Well theres a thirst inside you  
I know I cant be wrong  
So lets get out of the storm girl  
Weve waited much too long
