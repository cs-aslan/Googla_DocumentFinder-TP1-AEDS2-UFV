Now every once in a while  
Theres a crack in my smile  
Dark voices are talking to me  
Dark voices tell me the way  
  
Its supposed to be  
They said Breakin up  
They said Its hard to do  
But what they say  
  
About breakin up  
Yknow its just not true  
Breakin up its easy to do  
Breakin up its easy to do  
  
Why if you know  
Why did you have to go  
And leave me on t he floor  
About as sick as a dog  
  
Im feeding my face  
Like a blearyeyed hog  
Whyd it have to stop  
With so much good undone  
  
Breakin up its easy to do  
Breakin up its easy to do  
Breakin up its easy to do  
Yknow I break up every time  
  
I break up with you
