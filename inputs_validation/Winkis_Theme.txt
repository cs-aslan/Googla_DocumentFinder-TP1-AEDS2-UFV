talk This jam is dedicated to my brother Winki who is looking down on me
from  
Heaven Watching my every move as usual  
  
chorus  
There but for the grace of god do I go do I go  
There but for the grace of God do I go do I gogo  
Im trying to take my time on this rhyme  
  
But its bustin from the seems  
Like a fantasy and eagerness of dreams  
Im moving all around  
Oh yesIm making leaps an bounds  
Theres so much shit to say no time to write it down  
Im skippin to this and skippin to that  
Ive overflowed my cup  
Im flowin kind of quick I hope you can keep up  
Every aint cool just cause you slap me on my hand  
Therere things about all of yall have got to understand  
Latifah never was a teacher  
Never was a preacher  
Never was a saint  
Never was conceited  
Never was defeated  
Sometimes I get tired sometimes I want to faint  
But I never shut up when things piss me off  
And if I got to curse at you to get my point across  
Thats what I got to do thats how its got to be  
Ive got an angel watching over me  
  
chorus 2 times  
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world  
Yes he did yes he did  
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world  
You dont hear me  
Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world worldworldworld  
The light of my world my world AHHHHH yes he did
