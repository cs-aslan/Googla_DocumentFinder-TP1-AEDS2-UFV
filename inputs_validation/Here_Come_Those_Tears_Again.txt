Here come those tears again  
Just when I was getting over you  
Just when I was going to make it through  
Another night without missing you  
Thinking I might just be strong enough after all  
When I hear your footsteps echoing in the hall  
Baby here we stand again  
Like weve been so many times before  
Even though you looked so sure  
As I was watching you walking out my door  
But you always walk back in like you did today  
Acting like you never even went away  
Well I dont know if I can  
Open up and let you in baby  
Here come those tears  
Here come those tears again  
I can hear you telling me  
How you needed to be free  
And you had some things to work out alone  
Now youre standing here telling me  
How you have grown  
Here come those tears again  
Now youll tell me how to hold them in  
Here come those tears  
Here come those tears again  
Some other time baby  
When Im strong and feeling fine maybe  
When I can look at you without crying  
You might look like a friend of mine  
But I dont know if I can  
Open up enough to let you in  
Here come those tears  
Here come those tears again  
Just walk away  
Im going back inside and turning out those light  
And Ill be in the dark but youll be out of sight
