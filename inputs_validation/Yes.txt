When it started we had high hopes  
Now my backs on the line  
My backs on the ropes  
When it started we were alright  
But night makes a fool of us in daylight  
  
Yeah we were dying of frustration  
Saying Lord lead me not into temptation  
But its not easy when she turns you on  
Since they gone  
  
If youll only if youd only say yes  
Whether you wills anybodys guess  
God only God knows Im trying my best  
But Im just so tired of this loneliness  
  
So up they picked me by the big toe  
I was held from the rooftop then they let go  
Theres only screaming  
Let the windows down  
As I crawl to the ground  
  
If youll only if youd only say yes  
Whether you wills anybodys guess  
God only God knows she wont let me rest  
But Im just so tired of this loneliness  
Ive become so tired of this loneliness
