Somebody told me loves a beautiful thing  
And when I found it all the bells would just ring  
The sun would shine and all the birds would sing  
Then I met you  
  
I searched the planet for that magical girl  
I walked a million miles all over the world  
I found the oysters but never the pearls  
Then I met you  
  
I cant eat  
I cant sleep  
I feel sick  
Im so weak  
  
Love should never feel like this  
I must be doing something wrong  
Ive never felt this way before  
  
Walk in the bathroom and I take a deep breath  
Look in the mirror and it scares me to death  
Look like a junkie thats been strung out on meth  
Since I met you  
  
I cant eat  
I cant sleep  
I feel sick  
Im so weak  
  
Love should never feel like this  
I must be doing something wrong  
Ive never felt this way before  
  
Love should never feel like this  
I must be doing something wrong  
I never felt this way before  
  
Oh ignorance was always bliss  
Love should never feel like this  
  
Love should never ever feel like this  
Ive never felt this way before  
I must be doing something wrong  
No Love should never ever feel like this  
I must be doing something wrong  
Ive never ever felt this way before  
Whats wrong with me
