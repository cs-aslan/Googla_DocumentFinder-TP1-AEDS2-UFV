Jimmy Buffett  
When I pay my bills  
Gonna leave these Tennessee hills  
Take my lady to the sea  
Thats where we both come from  
Thats where we both belong  
Think Ill go back to the Keys  
  
Chorus  
Cause I dont want the thing that brings confusion  
Where people recognize you on a plane  
All I wants the quiet and the comforts  
That livin with my lovely lady brings  
  
Somehow we survived the double talk and jive  
Things are looking better all the time  
I owe her all I can cause she made me understand  
The simple way that we should live our lives  
Chorus  
  
Let me tell you now she can eat her own weight up in crab meat  
And theres plenty of that down there by the sea  
Well were sailing in those warm December breezes  
Sendin picture post cards back to Tennessee  
Repeat chorus
