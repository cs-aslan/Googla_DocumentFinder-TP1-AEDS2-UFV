Responsibility an anchor around my neck  
Dependability made me a nervous wreck  
Accountability I live from check to check  
Volatility neglect and no respect  
  
Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat  
I hit the road to I dont know and look for Tough Shit Street  
  
Oneway ticket nowhere theres no windows on this train  
Cant see where Im headed but Im going there again  
  
Moto Psycho  
Going nowhere everybody is a  
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby  
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour  
Moto Psycho Im a Moto Psycho  
Moto Psycho  
  
You know you cant resist to tell me what I mean  
You gave my mind a twist said that I was unclean  
The actor runs the play and adlibs in between  
Youre all that I resent my thoughts were so obscene  
  
Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat  
I hit the road to I dont know and look for Tough Shit Street  
  
Oneway ticket nowhere theres no windows on this train  
Cant see where Im headed but Im going there again  
  
Moto Psycho  
Going nowhere everybody is a  
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby  
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour  
Moto Psycho Im a Moto Psycho  
  
Oneway ticket nowhere theres no windows on this train  
Cant see where Im headed but Im going there again  
  
Moto Psycho  
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho  
Going nowhere move it or lose it baby Moto Psycho  
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour Moto Psycho  
Where Im headed I dont know but Im shoving off and I hit the road  
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho  
Time and time and time again Im a  
Moto Psycho  
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby  
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour  
Moto Psycho Im a Moto Psycho
