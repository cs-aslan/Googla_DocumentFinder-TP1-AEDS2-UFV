Moved on down  
To sweet home Alabama in 1974  
Had to get out of Music City  
And I had to get off the road  
  
Woman she left and the people  
Wouldnt let me sing nothin but them old  
Sad songs had to get high so I wouldnt cry  
You know they hit pretty close to home  
  
Im feelin better  
Now that Im back on the road  
Getting it together  
Between Macon and Muscle Shoals  
  
I started turnin up loud and looking at the crowd  
And bendin them guitar strings  
Knew all the while though it was my style  
Could they ever forget my name  
  
Rocked ed in Raleigh knocked em outta Nashville  
Just couldnt do no wrong  
People went wild and the band said  
Child better keep on playin your songs  
  
Im feelin better  
Now that Im back on the road  
Getting it together  
Between Macon and Muscle Shoals  
  
Well my life aint the same and I had to change  
And I hope this music will show  
A little bit less of cryin in the beer  
And a little of my own soul  
  
Waylon and Toy and all them boys  
I wanna say thanks to you  
Your fiddle and your steel make me play what I feel  
And I dont feel lovesick blues  
  
Im feelin better  
Now that Im back on the road  
Getting it together  
Between Macon and Muscle Shoals  
  
All came together in my sweet Alabama home  
And Im through forever of tryin to put everybody on  
And Im feelin better  
I got hurt but Im back on the road  
  
Getting it together had to eat a little cornbread  
Ive been eatin that cornbread sleepin on a featherbed  
Drinkin that homegrown  
Writin some new songs do it on get home  
  
Eat a little cornbread lovin on a featherbed  
Smokin that homegrown write a few new songs  
This here musics homegrown
