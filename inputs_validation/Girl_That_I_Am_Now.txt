Mhm mhm mhm oh could he love the girl that I am now  
Tonight Im in his arms but he just dont seem the same  
I cheated and Im guilty my heart cant stand this pain  
I let passions fill my mind from my heart and conscience blind  
I feel Im mighty low and I pray hell never know  
He love the girl I used to be could he love the girl that I am now  
 steel  piano   
It almost breaks my heart when he says that he loves me  
I know that Im not worthy and thats what troubles me  
If he do what I had done could he still feel just the same  
Or would he feel the way I do guilty and a shame  
He love the girl I used to be could he love the girl that I am now  
Mhm mhm mhm oh could he love the girl that I am now
