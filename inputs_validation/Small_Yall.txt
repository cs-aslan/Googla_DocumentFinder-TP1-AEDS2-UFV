Honey you think hes got an attitude  
So you treat him just a little too rude  
Buddy you think shes a little too cold  
So you act like a two year old  
  
Dont it make you feel low Joe  
Dont it make you feel mean Jean  
Dont it make you feel ashamed of yourself  
Dont it make you feel small yall  
  
Boy you say something bad about her brother  
Girl you say something mean about his mother  
Tempers flare and insults fly  
And youre both wanting to die  
  
Dont you feel like a jerk Kirk  
Dont you feel like a ninny Jenny  
Dont it make you feel ashamed of yourself  
Dont it make you feel small yall  
  
Lady you say you dont love him no more  
And mister you kick down the bedroom door  
She calls you names you never heard before  
And now its a full scale war  
  
Dont it make you feel crazy Daisy  
Mentally ill Bill  
Dont it make you feel ashamed of yourself  
Dont it make you feel small yall  
  
Six oclock eight oclock nine oclock ten  
The neighbors all know that youre at it again  
And two little kids just a few feet away  
Hear every word you say  
  
Dont it make you feel bad Dad  
Dont it make you feel wrong Mom  
Dont it make you feel ashamed of yourself  
Dont it make you feel small yall  
  
Dont it make you feel ashamed of yourself  
Dont it make you feel small yall  
  
With a pickle in the middle  
And a mustard on top
