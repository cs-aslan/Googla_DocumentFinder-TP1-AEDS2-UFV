Never thought about the other side oh no  
It was always lets go try to pull some hoes  
And I pulled em like a towtruck  
Since I was a young buck  
  
Guaranteed the hoes always got fucked  
With a onetwo and all that good shit  
I never flipped or tripped or got pussy whipped  
Cause Im KKKK Kid Rock motherfucker  
  
You want to piece of me  
Youre just another sucker  
But oh well you dont bother me none  
Cause me and your girl have lots of fun  
  
You know the one that looks like a model  
Sucks on my nuts like a baby on a milk bottle  
Not cause I make her I wouldnt make her  
But cause I mack her right she loves me all night  
  
With a onetwo and all that good shit  
With a onetwo I take another sip  
With a onetwo and Ill rock this party  
With a onetwo ya better ask somebody  
  
Get down girl and read my mind  
And youll see that its focused on your behind  
You gotta lotta class and dont mind me askin  
But can I go up in your fat ass  
  
And just pump pump pump  
Whats next check your money  
Its scum and its time to jet  
You bet shell be into it more  
  
On the bed the steps and the kitchen floor  
You like the way the KI  
Did it like I said I  
Would could should I do it good  
  
In your neighborhood  
On your fuckin block  
Cause Im the coooool the Kid Rock  
Kid Rock Kid Kid Rock Kid Kid Rock Kid Rock Kid Rock  
Make it nasty  
  
Hoes talk the same shit  
Ya dress like a slob  
But bitches still give a good blowjob  
Up come my drawers and its goodbye  
  
The Kid Rocks just got to fly Cause its 1990  
Time to fuck hoes  
But before ya goin put Jimmy in a lambskin  
And we could bump all night you bet  
  
So get set to jet and go get wet  
Come on outta your girdle and slacks  
And Ill shine that booty like turtle wax  
  
With a onetwo and all that good shit  
With a onetwo I take another sip  
With a onetwo and Ill rock this party  
With a onetwo ya better ask somebody  
Bitch
