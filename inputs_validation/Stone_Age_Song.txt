Im sure youve heard the Stone Age occurred  
For two and a half million years  
But theres more of Stone Age to engage  
Than maybe it first appears  
  
Dinosaurs Neanderthals  
Lets make this clearer  
Didnt live together  
Came from different eras  
Thats not all I can tell you  
So much more to be known

Its all the rage  
  
To skiddlybapdoowa  
  
Brush up on your Stone Age  
  
Oh yeah All right  
  
Its fine to define  
An era Palaeolithic  
But youre gonna have to be  
A little more specific  
Do you mean lower  
When ancient beings first used tools  
Or middle Palaeolithic  
When Neanderthal ruled  
  
Thats when Homo sapiens  
Starts to emerge  
But just in Africa  
Its long before the global surge  
Not till upper Palaeolithic  
Forty thousand years ago  
Did Neanderthal and Homo sapiens say hello  
Neanderthal and Homo sapi  
Living in caveman harmony  
  
Language was invented  
Cave painting art  
Then Palaeolithic ended  
Which meant the start  
Of phase twobedoobedoowap

Buck up on the Stone Age  
  
Oh yeah All right  
  
This is where it starts to  
Get all scientific  
Palaeolithics followed by  
The era Mesolithic  
Then Neanderthals are wiped out  
By the ice age  horrific  
After which the Neolithic age  
Was terrific  
  
Man learned to farm  
Built homes so they could settle  
Then some other folks turned up  
And they discovered metal  
Beaker men from Europe  
Found bronze and outgrown  
The simple and traditional ways of stone  
  
Bronze Age was invented  
By now man was flying  
Cause hot on its heels  
Came the age of iron  
Celts Druids  
Religion then Rome  
By now a distant memory  
Those ages of stone  
  
Shoobydoobydoowap  
  
Since that metallic stage  
  
Skiddlybapdoowah  
  
There was no more Stone Age
