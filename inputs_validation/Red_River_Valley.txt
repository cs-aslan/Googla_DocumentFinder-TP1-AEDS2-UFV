From this valley they say you are going  
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile  
For they say you are taking the sunshine  
That has brightened our pathways awhile  
  
Chorus  
Come and sit by my side if you love me  
Do not hasten to bid me adieu  
Just remember the Red River Valley  
And the cowboy who loved you so true  
  
Ive been thinking a long time my darling  
Of the sweet words you never would say  
Now alas must my fond hopes all vanish  
For they say you are going away  
  
Do you think of the valley youre leaving  
O how lonely and how dreary it will be  
And do you think of the kind hearts youre breaking  
And the pain you are causing to me  
  
Chorus  
  
They will bury me where you have wandered  
Near the hills where the daffodils grow  
When youre gone from the Red River Valley  
For I cant live without you I know  
  
Chorus
