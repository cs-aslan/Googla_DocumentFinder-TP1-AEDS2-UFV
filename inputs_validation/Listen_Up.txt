Listen up  
Whats the time said today  
Im gonna speak my mind  
Take me up to the top of the world  
I want to see my crime  
  
Day by day  
Theres a man in a suit  
Whos gonna make you pay  
For the thoughts that you think  
And the words they wont let you say  
  
One fine day  
Gonna leave you all behind  
It wouldnt be so bad  
If I had more time  
  
Sailing down a river alone  
Ive been tryin to find my way back home  
But I dont believe in magic  
Life is automatic  
But I dont mind being on my own  
No I dont mind being on my own
