Everything is wrong since me and my baby parted  
All day long Im walkin cause I cant get my car started  
Laid off from my job and I cant afford to check it   
I wish someone would come along right into it and wreck it  
Come on I cant get started  
Come on since me and my baby parted  
Come on I cant afford to check it  
I wish someone would come along right into it and wreck it  
Come on  
  
Everything is wrong since Ive been without you  
Every night I lie awake thinking about you  
Every time the phone rings it sounds like thunder   
Some stupid jerk tryin to reach another number  
  
Come on since Ive been without you  
Come on steady thinkin about you  
Come on phone sounds like thunder   
Some stupid jerk tryin to reach another number  
Come on  
  
Now everything is wrong since I last saw you baby  
I really want to see you and I dont mean maybe  
Im doin everything to try to make you see  
That I belong to you and you belong to me  
  
Come on I want to see you baby  
Come on I dont mean maybe  
Come on Im tryin to make you see  
That I belong to you and you belong to me  
Come on  
  
Come on come on come on
