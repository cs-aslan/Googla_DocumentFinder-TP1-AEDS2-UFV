Lately Ive been  
Livin in my head  
The rest of me is dead  
Im dying for truth  
  
Make me believe  
No more left and right  
Come on take my side  
Im fightin for you  
Im fightin for you  
  
Pleased to meet you take my hand  
There is no way back from here  
Pleased to meet you say your prayers  
There is no way back from here  
But I dont care  
No way back from here  
  
Wake me Im ready  
Somethin dont seem right  
I was dreamin and  
I was talkin to you  
  
Memory mend me  
Know Ive seen my share  
Things I cant repair  
Im breakin to you  
Im breakin to you  
  
Pleased to meet you take my hand  
There is no way back from here  
Pleased to meet you say your prayers  
There is no way back from here  
But I dont care  
No way back from here  
  
Pleased to meet you say your prayers  
There is no way back from here  
Pleased to meet you say your prayers  
There is no way back from here  
But I dont care  
No way back from here
