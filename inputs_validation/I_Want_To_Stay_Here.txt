I dont wanna go to the party with you  
I dont wanna go to the dance  
I dont wanna go anywhere with you  
I just wanna stay here and love you  
  
Now that I can be alone with you  
I wont throw away the chance  
Theres no other place like home with you  
I just wanna stay here and love you  
  
All through the week  
I miss you so  
But now that Ive got you  
Im gonna hold you closer and closer and closer  
  
I dont wanna go out walking with you  
And now that I am in this trance  
I dont even know if Ill talk to you  
I just wanna stay here and  
I wanna love you I wanna love you  
  
I just wanna stay here and love you  
I wanna stay here and love you  
Yes I wanna stay here and love you  
Just wanna stay here and love you oohho baby baby  
I wanna stay here and love you  
Yes I wanna stay here and love you
