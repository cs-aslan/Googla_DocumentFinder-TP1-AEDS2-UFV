And promised youd always be  
By my side now youre gone  
And Im waiting patiently

Chorus  
Youve got the Beach Boys and your firms got the Stones  
But I know you wont leave me alone  
Sometimes it seems youre not with me  
It hurts me so much It hurts me so much  
Sometimes it seems youre not with me  
It hurts me so much It hurts me so much  
You are the most youre so rad youre so fresh  
And Im so glad I am yours you are mine  
Show me where and I will sign  
  
Chorus  
Jaime believe me I wont let you down  
cause you are the best lawyer in town  
Sometimes it seems youre not with me  
It hurts me so much It hurts me so much  
Sometimes it seems youre not with me  
It hurts me so much It hurts me so much  
I love you so much I love you so much
