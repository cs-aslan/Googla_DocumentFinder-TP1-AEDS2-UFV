Six foot six he stood on the ground  
He weighed two hundred and thirtyfive pounds  
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love  
He was the kind of a man that would gamble on luck  
Look you in the eye and never back up  
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love  
You cant see it with your eyes  
Hold it in your hand  
But like the wind it covers our land  
Strong enough to move the heart of any man  
This thing called love  
It can lift you up  
Never let you down  
Take your world and turn it all around  
Ever since time nothings ever been found  
Thats stronger than love  
Most men are like me they struggle in doubt  
They trouble their minds day in and day out  
Too busy with living to worry about a little word like love  
But when I see a mothers tenderness  
As she holds her young close to her breast  
Then I thank god that the worlds been blessed with a thing called love  
You cant see it with your eyes  
Hold it in your hand  
But like the wind it covers our land  
Strong enough to move the heart of any man  
This thing called love  
It can lift you up  
Never let you down  
Take your world and turn it all around  
Ever since time nothings ever been found  
Thats stronger than love  
Ever since time nothings ever been found  
Thats stronger than love
