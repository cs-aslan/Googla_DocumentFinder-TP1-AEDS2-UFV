I feel safe  
I feel warm  
When youre here can I do no wrong  
I am cured when Im by youre side  
Im alright yes Im alright  
  
Im safe when I am with you  
And I feel warm if you want me to  
I am cured when Im by your side  
Im alright  
  
Chorus  
Careful where you stand my love  
Careful where you lay your head  
Its true were always there  
Looking out for one another  
  
I feel safe when Im with you  
And I feel warm if you want me to  
I am cured when youre all alone  
Im alright  
  
Chorus  
  
So Id like a quiet town please  
Id like a quiet town  
  
Oh now now  
Oh now now  
And careful where you stand  
And careful where you stand
