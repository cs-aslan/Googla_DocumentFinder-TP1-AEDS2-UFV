Wont you take  
A chance my brother  
Follow me to a time of revelation  
Cant you see that  
Destiny will take a turn  
And show you  
Theres no need to fight  
Cause you know its right  
  
And I finally see where Im going  
I finally know what Im knowing  
Now our journeys only just begun  
  
You wont need to ask forgiveness  
What you find  
Will be your inspiration  
You dont have to pray for glory  
All is equal no more pain  
You know its true its up to you  
  
Cause I finally see where Im going  
I finally know what Im knowing  
Now our journeys only just begun  
  
Over the bridge  
Where you start to believe  
Down at the edge of the rainbow  
Dark is the night  
But weve seen another time  
Follow the light of the shadow  
  
Right or wrong there is no reason  
There will be no hidden destination  
With the strength that you discover  
You can show the way  
How it was meant to be  
For all to see  
  
Cause I finally know  
What Im knowing  
I finally see where Im going  
Now our journeys only just begun
