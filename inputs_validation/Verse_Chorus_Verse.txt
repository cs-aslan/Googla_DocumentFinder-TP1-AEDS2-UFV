And if you save yourself  
You will make him happy  
Hell keep you in a jar  
And youll think youre happy  
Hell give you breather holes  
And youll think youre happy  
Hell cover you with grass  
And youll think youre happy  
  
Chorus  
Now  
Youre in a laundry room  
Youre in a laundry room  
The clues they came to you  
  
And if you cut yourself  
You will think youre happy  
Hell keep you in a jar  
Then youll make him happy  
Hell give you breather holes  
Then youll think youre happy  
Hell cover you with grass  
Then youll think youre happy  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
And if you fool yourself  
You will make him happy  
Hell keep you in a jar  
Then youll think youre happy  
Hell give you breather holes  
Then you will seem happy  
Youll wallow in the shit  
Then youll think youre happy  
  
Chorus
