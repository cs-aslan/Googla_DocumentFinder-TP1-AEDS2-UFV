Dont try to blow out the sun for me baby  
Im not asking for what I know cant be  
All that I ask is a kiss a day  
And Ill give you love thatll never go away  
Yes I will yes I will  
I wouldnt ask you to lift up  
This great big world little baby  
Im not that kind of a girl  
  
All that I ask is a smile or two  
And nothing in this world will be too good for you  
Nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody  
Nobody knows how deep my love for you really goes  
But boy I want you to know  
I wouldnt ask you to hold back the light of dawn baby  
Thats too much to ask to anyone  
  
All that I ask is your loving ways  
And Ill keep you happy  
For the rest of your natural born days baby  
You hear me talking to you  
Ill keep you happy  
Ill keep you happy for the rest of your days daddy  
Just believe me
