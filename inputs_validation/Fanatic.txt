Dont try to tell me the world is changing  
Hearts getting stupid now that is a strange thing  
I got a heartbeat I feel the heat rise  
I got no questions I got no alibis  
  
Love dont know the difference  
Sands and mountains are insignificant  
  
Now dont try to tell me love is dead  
It is your body now it is your head  
I cant stop crying I cant stop screaming  
I cant stop talking I cant stop dreaming  
  
Love is pleasure love is pain  
Sweet sweet summer and bitter rain  
  
I gotta have it I gotta use it  
I gotta own it never lose it  
  
Oh oh whoa whoa  
Im just a fanatic  
  
Yeah  
  
Love love is pleasure love is pain  
Sweet sweet summer and bitter rain  
  
I gotta have it I gotta use it  
I gotta own it never lose it  
I gotta use it I gotta have it  
I feel the heat rise  
  
Love love love  
Yeah  
  
Oh whoa whoaa whoaaa  
Im just a fanatic

Yeah now I gotta have it  
Uh Im just a fanatic
