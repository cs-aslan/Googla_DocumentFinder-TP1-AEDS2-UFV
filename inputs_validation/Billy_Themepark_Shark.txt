Im a shark Im a shark  
A killer of the ocean  
Im a shark Im a shark  
And silently I strike  
Im a shark Im a shark  
Im dumber than a tree  
I only have three thoughts and they are eat swim  Eat  
  
Hes a shark hes a shark  
I was swimming in the ocean  
Hes a shark hes a shark  
I got picked up by a boat  
A team of lonely fishermen sold me to a park  
And now my name is Billy Im a Theme Park Shark  
  
Billy the themepark shark  
Performing tricks for tourists that have payed five bucks a head  
Billy the themepark shark  
He looks just like a killer but hes too wellfed  
  
The sight of blood once put me in a frenzy  
Now it means that its time to clean the pool  
  
Im a shark Im a shark  
Im swimming in a pool  
Im a shark Im a shark  
I dont have to fight for food  
I get three meals a day and some extra on the weekend  
And Im the only shark I know who has a dental plan  
Who has a dental plan  
  
Hes a shark hes a shark  
And Im a big attraction  
Hes a shark hes a shark  
They love to watch me jump  
Ive been the star for years and Ive never been for sale  
At least until the owners think they need a killer whale  
  
Billy the themepark shark  
Jumping out football nets suspended overhead  
Billy the themepark shark  
He looks just like a killer but hes too wellfed  
  
Im a shark Im a shark  
But Im not in my natural habitat  
Hes fat and old and lazy  
But Im happy youre here  
I really hope these activists dont free Billy  
cause out there in the wild Id be dead  
  
The sight of bloodworms put him in a feeding frenzy  
Now it means that its time to clean the pool  
  
Billy the themepark shark  
Performing tricks for tourists that have payed five bucks a head  
Billy the themepark shark  
  
He looks just like a killer in the wild hed be dead  
  
Oh Billy Billy Billy Billy  
The number one attraction of an aqua petting zoo  
Billy Billy Billy Billy  
The poster fish of tourism Iowa
