Harsh words are spoken  
Promises are broken  
Old wounds are opened  
And love walks out that door  
Too proud to make up  
Youre ready to break up  
Too late you wake up  
And love walks out that door  
  
Baby oh sweet baby  
I didnt mean a word that I said  
Well now you know that I love you  
Cant we talk it over in bed  
I never meant to hurt you  
Must have been out of my head  
Tell me that you still want me  
Cant we talk it over in bed  
talk talk talk it over  
  
Harsh words are spoken  
Promises are broken  
Old wounds are opened  
And love walks out that door  
Too proud to make up  
Youre ready to break up  
Too late you wake up  
And love walks out that door  
  
Come on a little closer  
Cant we just forgive and forget  
Everything seems to work out  
I never meant to hurt you  
I must have been out of my head  
Tell me that you still want me  
Cant we talk it over in bed  
  
Dont let it no dont let it slip away  
Oh no baby ooh
