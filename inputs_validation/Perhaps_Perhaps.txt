You wont admit you love me  
And so how am I ever to know  
You always tell me  
Perhaps perhaps perhaps  
  
A million times Ive asked you  
And then I ask you over again  
You only answer  
Perhaps perhaps perhaps  
  
If you cant make your mind up  
Well never get started  
And I dont wanna wind up  
Being parted brokenhearted  
  
So if you really love me  
Say yes but if you dont dear confess  
And please dont tell me  
Perhaps perhaps perhaps  
  
Perhaps perhaps perhaps  
  
If you cant make your mind up  
Well never get started  
And I dont wanna wind up  
Being parted brokenhearted  
  
So if you really love me  
Say yes but if you dont dear confess  
And please dont tell me  
Perhaps perhaps perhaps  
Perhaps perhaps perhaps  
Perhaps perhaps giggle perhaps
