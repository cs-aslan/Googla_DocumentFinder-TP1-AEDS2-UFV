I know you I walked with you once upon a dream  
I know you the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam  
Yet I know its true that visions are seldom all they seem  
But if I know you I know what youll do  
Youll love me at once the way you did once upon a dream  
  
But if I know you I know what you do  
You love me at once  
The way you did once upon a dream  
  
I know you I walked with you once upon a dream  
I know you the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam  
And I know its true that visions are seldom all they seem  
But if I know you I know what youll do  
Youll love me at once the way you did once upon a dream  
  
But if I know you I know what you do  
You love me at once  
The way you did once upon a dream
