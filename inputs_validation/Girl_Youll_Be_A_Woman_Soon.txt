Love you so much cant count all the ways  
Id die for you girl and all they can say is  
Hes not your kind  
  
They never get tired of puttin me down  
And I never know when I come around  
What Im gonna find  
Dont let them make up your mind  
Dont you know  
  
Girl youll be a woman soon  
Please come take my hand  
Girl youll be a woman soon  
Soon youll need a man  
  
Ive been misunderstood for all of my life  
But what theyre sayin girl just cuts like a knife  
The boys no good  
  
Well I finally found what Ive been looking for  
But if they get the chance theyll end it for sure  
Sure they would  
Baby Ive done all I could  
Its up to you  
  
Girl youll be a woman soon  
Please come take my hand  
Girl youll be a woman soon  
Soon youll need a man
