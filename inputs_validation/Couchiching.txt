Theres a town they call Orillia It is there of which I sing  
It is just above Lake Simcoe by Lake Couchiching  
  
Chorus  
Couchiching Couchiching by Lake Couchiching  
Cooooochiching by Lake Couchiching  
Couchiching Couchiching by Lake Couchiching  
Coooochiching  
  
Across the raging Narrows Casino Rama stands  
Where there once were only sparrows people come from other lands  
To the west lie hills aplenty if skiing is your thing  
You can while away the summer by Lake Couchiching  
  
Chorus  
  
In Orillia they had movies and sports and music too  
And all around the shore line were the folks that we all knew  
  
Chorus  
  
Now Ive spent my life in travel now Ive spent my life in dust  
Now Ive spent my life in family now Ive spent my life in trust  
Any way youd like to cut in Itll hit you with a ping  
When you think about Orillia and its by Lake Couchiching  
  
Chorus  
  
When I get my final slumber when I pawn my diamond ring  
I will do my final number by Lake Couchiching  
  
Chorus
