May not know enough about you babe  
That can only come in time  
Only know enough to make you stay  
On my mind  
  
Though I met you only yesterday  
And only for a moment then  
I knew I couldnt let you get away  
I just can see you girl  
  
I can be the one you love  
Let me be the one you need  
Take a look into your heart  
Try to find a place for me  
  
Cant say I cant live without you babe  
Thats just some worn out losers line  
May not know enough about you babe  
But you stay on my mind  
  
Repeat x4  
I can be the one you love  
Let me be the one you need  
Take a look into your heart  
Try to find a place for me
