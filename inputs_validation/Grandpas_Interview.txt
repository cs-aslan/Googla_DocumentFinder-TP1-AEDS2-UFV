Grandpa heres your coffee  
Said Edith as she filled his cup  
Nobodyll find you here  
And Earl is glad you guys showed up  
The way things are downtown  
You might have to stay for awhile  
  
There was a helicopter hovering over your house  
When I talked to your neighbor Kyle  
Who the hell do they think they are  
Invading our home like that  
Grandma and I had to leave so fast  
We couldnt even catch the cat  
  
The helicopter scared the shit out of him  
And it took off down a trail  
Down past the railroad track  
Towards the county jail  
  
Jed you really screwed up now  
What did you have to do that for  
Everybody wants to hang your ass  
And heres a note from Lenore  
Sun touched the cold steel bars  
As she pushed the paper in  
Jed took it up and read it  
And he couldnt hide a grin  
  
Outside the jail window  
A crow flew across the sky  
Completely disappearing behind each bar  
Then a helicopter flew by  
Say hi to Earl and Edith  
Tell m Im doing fine  
Tell m its time for them to let you go now  
They should cut the line  
  
Can grandma come and see me  
I got a new song to sing  
Its longer than all the others combined  
And it doesnt mean a thing  
The noise was unfamiliar  
Generators whirling  
Walkietalkies screaming  
Vans parked in the open field  
  
TV crews and cameras  
They wanted to interview grandpa on the porch  
They came through the gate and across the lawn  
Knocking down Ediths Tiki Torch  
And grandpa saw them there  
Looking through the venetian blind  
Those people dont have any respect  
So they wont get any of mine  
  
I dont wanna talk about Jed  
I dont watch channel 2 or 6 or 9  
I dont have time to talk that fast  
And it aint my crime  
  
It aint a privilege to be on TV  
And it aint a duty either  
The only good thing about TV  
Is shows like Leave it to Beaver  
  
Shows with love and affection  
Like mama used to say  
A little Mayberry living  
Could go a long way  
  
He took Earls shotgun down from the closet  
Loaded up both barrels  
Walked out on the porch and fired m off  
And up walked a woman named Carol  
  
Susan Carol from Early Magazine  
I got some questions to ask  
Well you can stick m where the sun dont shine  
Grandpa said with a gasp  
  
Then he fell face first and let out a sigh  
And Edith ran out in shock  
He was looking at her from down on the floor  
Grandpa looked like he was trying to talk  
  
That guy just keeps singin  
Can somebody shut him up  
I dont know for the life of me  
Where he comes up with that stuff  
  
They laid his head on a newspaper  
With a picture of Carmichael on the front page  
Posing with the little league baseball team  
And a seedy shot of Jed on a motorcycle  
  
Grandpa died a hero  
Trying to stop the media  
Fighting for freedom of silence  
Trying to be anonymous  
  
Share your loving and you live so long  
Share your loving and you live so long  
Share your loving and you live so long  
Live so long
