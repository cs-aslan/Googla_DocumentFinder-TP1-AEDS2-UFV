Taylor Swift  
I use to think that love was for dreamers  
Love at first sight I never believed it  
Had my head on tight I lived in the real world  
But that was until I met you  
Now everything is changed  
  
Ed Sheeran  
Yesterday I was drinking my sorrows away  
On the edge of forever storing my heart away  
On the verge of letting my heart go stray  
And thats when I met you  
And now everything is changed  
  
Taylor Swift  
Oh darling  
You look like your soul is lost  
What couldve happened to make you feel so low  
Dont let the liquor ease your hurt  
Dont let your heart go cold  
  
Ed Sheeran  
Oh darling  
Dont worry Ill be just fine  
Whats a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this  
If I werent drinking then Id be crying  
And I think thats something we both rather miss  
  
Both  
But I guess thats just how the cookie crumbles  
You give your all and watch as your heart tumbles  
Down and down until you cant feel anymore  
  
Ed Sheeran  
Thats the thing about love  
Thats the reason why Ill never fall again  
It hurts when its supposed to make you make you feel good  
  
Taylor Swift  
Well if thats what love is  
Then I dont ever wanna try it out  
But something tells me I should  
  
Even though weve only met each other  
Well work it out together until everything is changed  
Until everything is good
