Hey Im feeling tired  
My time is gone today  
You flirt with suicide  
Sometimes thats ok  
Hear what others say  
Im here standing hollow  
Falling away from me  
Falling away from me  
Day is here fading  
Thats when I would say  
I flirt with suicide  
Sometimes kill the pain  
I can always say  
Its gonna be better tomorrow  
Falling away from me  
Falling away from me  
  
Beating me down  
Beating me beating me  
Down down  
Into the ground  
Screaming so sound  
Beating me beating me  
Down down  
Into the ground  
  
Falling away from me  
Its spinning round and round  
Falling away from me  
Its lost and cant be found  
Falling away from me  
Its spinning round and round  
Falling away from me  
So down  
  
Beating me down  
Beating me beating me  
Down down  
Into the ground  
Screaming so sound  
Beating me beating me  
Down down  
Into the ground  
  
Pressing me they wont go away  
So I pray go away  
  
Its falling away from me  
  
Beating me down  
Beating me beating me  
Down down  
Into the ground  
Screaming so sound  
Beating me beating me  
Down down  
Into the ground
