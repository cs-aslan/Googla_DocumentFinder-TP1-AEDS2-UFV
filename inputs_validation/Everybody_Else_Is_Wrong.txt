At the edge of the world  
The sun pouring down  
We must be heading home  
I completely agree  
Ive just been waiting for the right words to come along  
  
Everybody else is wrong  
Doesnt everyone concur oh no  
Thank you for the vote of confidence  
I feel so much surer now that  
Everybody else is wrong  
  
In the prime of ones life  
One must be aware  
Its such a weary job  
But Ive made up my mind  
Ive just been waiting for the right choice to come along  
  
Please dont turn out the light  
My pen is on fire  
The masterpiece revealed  
Put your wallets in hand  
If youve been waiting for the answer to come along
