So there goes your life  
Disappeared from ever loving friends  
And now a slave to obsession  
Your strange delight  
You lie awake  
  
How your senses ache  
Shaking off the night  
Is there more strange delight  
There goes your self  
In the clear forever out of line  
And there youll stray through obsession  
Your strange delight  
Cant bear this heat  
  
Your poor heart skips a beat  
Tearing off the years  
To when you really cared  
So wheres your soul  
In the field where every story ends  
And then how plain your obsession  
Your strange delight  
So this is hell  
  
Not so hard to tell  
Better men than I  
Have tried your strange delight  
Is there no strange delight
