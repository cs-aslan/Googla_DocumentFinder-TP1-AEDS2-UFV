Now that were alone  
No more hide and seek  
You are the highest dream to me  
And as you softly sleep  
then I can tell you what it means  
  
Locked in my arms like lovers lie  
I will not let you slip away  
Is this the summer of them all  
Is this my night of nights  
that you came to stay  
  
Here you are owner of my heart  
just the way that love should be  
And theres something I must say to you  
if you promise to believe  
that its you Im living for  
and I could not love you more  
  
Seasons may come and seasons go  
but these are the truest words I know  
Face to face eye to eye  
This is the summer of of our lives  
One love that cannot die  
  
Here you are owner of my soul  
never let you say goodbye  
And there is something I must say to you  
we leave the world outside  
and you have come to me at last we start  
  
Open up your heart  
let my deepest love inside  
Im only doing what I have to do  
If you promise to believe  
that I could not love you more  
  
Here you are you are owner of my heart  
just the way that love should be  
And theres something I must say to you  
we leave the world outside  
and you have come to me at last at last we start  
  
Open up your heart  
let my deepest love inside ah  
Im only doing what I have to do  
If you promise to believe  
that its you Im living for  
that its you Im living for  
and I could not love you more
