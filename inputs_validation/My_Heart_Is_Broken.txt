My heart is broken  
My love is gone  
I live without you  
Your pillow cold  
I am forsaken  
I cant go on  
My heart is broken  
My love is gone  
If I hadnt cheated  
While you were gone  
The well that wed  
Been drinkin from  
Wouldnt a dried  
And turned cold  
My days are empty  
My nights are long  
Five cups of coffee  
For the years gone wrong  
If I hadnt cheated  
While you were gone  
The well that wed  
Been drinkin from  
Wouldnt a dried  
And turned cold  
My days are empty  
My nights are long  
My heart is broken  
My love is gone  
My love is gone
