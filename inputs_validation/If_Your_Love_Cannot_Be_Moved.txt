You cant say we shall and not fight through hell  
You cant say we will and not dare to deal  
You cant shout out peace and then vanish in the crowd  
You cant ride the storm without some effect  
You cant steal the spoil and not pay the debt  
You cant wave a sign that spells evil and feel really proud  
You cant sing a song with no melody  
You cant say were one without unity  
You cant form a line if youre sacred to stand alone  
You cant pray for grace and then smack her face  
You cant speak of hope and then crack a joke  
  
You can say youre there but time knows how much youve grown  
Put a face to your somebody  
  
Can you say your name  
Or would you rather stay unknown  
Can you show your face  
Or are you fearful of it shown  
Can you feel your heart  
Or does it beat for you alone  
Lift your glass up high  
Say that your truth will never lie  
If your love cannot be moved  
  
You cant look at me and not see yourself  
You cant say for them and not for who else  
You cant truly bless and not bless the good of all  
You cant serve the rich and desert the poor  
You cant hear their cries and just close the door  
You cant say youre down and not take it to the wall  
You cant benefit from ones detriment  
You cant find the serum and not cure the sick  
You cant free the slave to enslave them differently  
You cant see the right only from your sight  
You cant see the wrong and just go along  
Or is that the way you would want your fate to read  
Put a face to your somebody  
  
Can you say your name  
Or would you rather stay unknown  
Can you show your face  
Or are you fearful of it shown  
Can you feel your heart  
Or does it beat for you alone  
Lift your glass up high  
Say that your truth will never lie  
If your love cannot be moved  
  
You cant make a pledge and then slip the script  
You cant say the words and not move your lips  
You cant be confused and still say you understand  
You cant be a friend but not through thin and thick  
You cant be a click but in danger split  
You cant evenly share and then grab the biggest hand  
You cant say you do but then show you dont  
You cant say you will and make sure you wont  
You cant want for change and not do what you need to do  
  
You cant give up all and then take back all you give  
You cant live to die but you can die to live  
Or is that too much to ask of the you in you  
Put a face to your somebody  
  
Can you say your name  
Or would you rather stay unknown  
Can you show your face  
Or are you fearful of it shown  
Can you feel your heart  
Or does it beat for you alone  
Lift your glass up high  
Say that your truth will never lie  
If your love cannot be moved
