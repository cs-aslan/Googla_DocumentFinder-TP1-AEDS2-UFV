Everyday you call and wear me out  
With nonsense  
All you wanna do is blab about  
Your problems  
I be making bad excuses up like  
Ooh I gotta hang up now  
Cause the house is burning down  
But you never hear them anyway  
Cause you dont shut up  
From the second that I say hello  
Im like ugh You Please no  
No I cant get in a word edgewise  
And you dont notice anyway  
You dont care about what I say  
So I wont be picking up this time  
Bye bye bye
