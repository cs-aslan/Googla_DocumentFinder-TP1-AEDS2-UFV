Theres a shadow just behind me  
Shrouding every step I take  
Making every promise empty  
Pointing every finger at me  
Waiting like a stalking butler  
Who upon the finger rests  
Murder now the path called must we  
Just before the son has come  
Jesus wont you fucking whistle  
Something but the past and done  
Why cant we not be sober  
I just want to start this over  
Why cant we drink forever  
I just want to start things over  
I am just a worthless liar  
I am just an imbecile  
I will only complicate you  
Trust in me and fall as well  
I will find a center in you  
I will chew it up and leave  
I will work to elevate you  
Just enough to bring you down  
Trust me  
Mother Mary wont you whisper  
Something but whats past and done  
Trust me  
I want what I want
