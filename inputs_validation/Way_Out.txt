Lies and love  
Lies love  
Bed wetting son of the great heat  
Its all over me  
Its all under me  
The face aint making what the mouth needs  
  
Wonder more  
Want more  
Than we did before  
Try the new tease  
Well quiet you  
Get over me  
The shit is running and it runs deep  
  
Im way out  
Way out  
  
When you mean it on the inside you still cant to me  
  
Fits around me so tight nuh oh  
Fits around me  
  
Im way out  
Way out  
  
When you mean it on the inside you still cant to me
