I come from a long line  
High and low and in between  
Same as you  
Hills of golden  
Hails of poison  
Times thrown me through  
And I believe Ive come to learn  
That turnin round  
Is to become confusion  
And the golds no good for spending  
And the poisons hungry waiting  
  
What can you leave behind  
When youre flyin lightning fast  
And all alone  
Only a trace my friend  
Spirit of motion born  
And direction grown  
A trace that will not fade  
In frozen skies  
Your journey will be  
And if her shadow doesnt seem much company  
Who said it would be  
  
There is the highway  
And the homemade lovin kind  
The highways mine  
And us ramblers are getting the travelling down  
You fathers build with stones  
That stand and shine  
Heavens where you find it  
And you cant  
Take too much with you  
But daddy dont you listen  
Its just this highway talkin  
  
All things at our life  
Are brothers in the soil  
And in the sky  
And I believe it  
With my blood  
If not my eyes  
I dont know why we cant  
Be brothers here  
I know we should be  
Answers dont seem easy  
And Im wonderin  
If they could be
