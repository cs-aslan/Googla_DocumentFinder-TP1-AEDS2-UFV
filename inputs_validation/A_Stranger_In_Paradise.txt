Take my hand  
Im a stranger in paradise  
All lost in a wonderland  
A stranger in paradise  
If I stand starryeyed  
Thats a danger in paradise  
For mortals who stand beside  
An angel like you  
I saw your face  
And I ascended  
Out of the common place  
Into the rare  
Somewhere in space  
I hang suspended  
Until I know  
Theres a chance that you care  
Wont you answer this fervent prayer  
Of a stranger in Paradise  
Dont send me in dark despair  
From all that I hunger for  
But open your angels arms  
To this stranger in paradise  
And tell him that he need be  
A stranger no more
