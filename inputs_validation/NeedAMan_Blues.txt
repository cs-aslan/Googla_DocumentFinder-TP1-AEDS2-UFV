Another Monday morning  
Another five day week ahead  
Such a lonely weekend  
Sleeping in a half filled bed  
  
Got those needaman blues  
I need a man so bad  
Got those needaman blues  
And its driving me mad  
  
All the evening people  
Dressing up just to get undressed  
And me Im stuck at home  
Losing more and gaining less  
  
Got those needaman blues  
I need a man so bad  
Got those needaman blues  
And its driving me mad  
  
Emptiness inside  
Empty as a glass in my hand  
Whisky friend of mine  
Help me make it easy without  
  
Got those needaman blues  
I need a man so bad  
Got those needaman blues  
And its driving me mad  
  
Baby baby baby  
Goes the singer on my hifi  
Honey honey honey  
My reply  
  
Got those needaman blues  
I need a man so bad  
Got those needaman blues  
And its driving me mad  
  
Emptiness inside  
Empty as a glass in my hand  
Whisky friend of mine  
Help me make it easy without  
  
Got those needaman blues  
I need a man so bad  
Got those needaman blues  
And its driving me mad  
  
Another Monday morning  
Another five day week ahead  
Such a lonely weekend  
Sleeping in a half filled bed  
  
Got those needaman blues  
I need a man so bad  
Got those needaman blues  
And its driving me mad
