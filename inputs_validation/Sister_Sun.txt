Tell me is it really true  
Theres something goin on  
Outside  
I just can feel it  
I heard it on the radio  
Im not allowed to go  
Outside  
I cant believe it  
Theres a big hole in the sky  
Where the radiations breaking through  
And we just sit and stare  
Like the rabbit at the snake  
Theres so much we could do  
But we gotta do it now  
Cause its gettin pretty late  
Better hurry now  
We all need the sun  
We need love and light for everyone  
We need our atmosphere  
To live in here  
We could be so strong  
We overthrow the government and stop  
Whats goin wrong  
Were fighting for the sun  
Its really hard to understand  
The change of sister sun  
As if your sunny smile  
Would turn into a deadly one  
Its not a quality of life  
To live inside a mighty trap  
To have that icecold coke beyond the radiation gap  
There should be more resistance  
Against industrial trusts  
And if theres no solution there should be revolution  
I wonder if we start in time were racing with the seconds  
I wonder if weve got enough to talk to stupid politicians  
We all need the sun  
Hold on to revolution Members of the earth lets fighting for the sun
