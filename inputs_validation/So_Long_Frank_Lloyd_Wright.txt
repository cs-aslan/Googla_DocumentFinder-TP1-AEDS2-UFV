So long Frank Lloyd Wright  
I cant believe your song is gone so soon  
I barely learned the tune  
So soon  
So soon  
Ill remember  
  
Frank Lloyd Wright  
All of the nights wed harmonize till dawn  
I never laughed so long  
So long  
So long  
  
Chorus  
Architects may come and  
Architects may go and  
Never change your point of view  
When I run dry  
I stop awhile and think of you  
  
So long Frank Lloyd Wright  
All of the nights wed harmonize till dawn  
I never laughed so long  
So long  
So long
