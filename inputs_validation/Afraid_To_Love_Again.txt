If every time that you got hurt it left a scar  
And if every dream you ever had broke your heart  
If every time you made a plan the world came to an end  
Then youd know why Im afraid to love again  
If broken dreams are all it seems youve ever known  
And hurts the only thing you can depend upon  
And if you should find misery to be your only friend  
Then youd know why Im afraid to love again  
If every time you look up a cloud should hide the sun  
Pay dearly for each kindness ever shown to anyone  
If everything you try should fail before you can begin  
Then youd know why Im afraid to love again  
Then youd know why Im afraid to love again
