Babys gone shoppin shes lookin around  
Shes checkin out the boys and the clothes about town  
Pick up this drop off that  
Stares at her pictures from the Fotomat  
Oh she likes what she sees  
But shes afraid of what she needs  
  
She should be here with me  
She should be here with me  
  
But I dont make it easy Im no day at the beach  
Just an old road dog gettin harder to teach  
Hang on this planet hang on each twirl  
Scatter my belongings all over this world  
I get more wrapped up each day  
Shes lookin further away  
She should be here with me  
She should be here with me  
  
Instrumental  
  
Not much good at conversation  
I dont want a proclamation  
I just think that we could use  
A little face to face communication  
  
Now Ive been thinkin thinkin this through  
Time to stop all this selfishness  
Both me and you  
Ill stop from here you stop from thee  
Well meet somewhere in the middle  
Darlin I dont care  
I dont want no more heartaches  
Its time to slam on the brakes  
She should be here with me  
  
Babys gone shoppin  
No more bar hoppin  
I dont know but I been told  
Thay city livin gets awfully cold
