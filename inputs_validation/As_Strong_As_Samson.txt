Psychiatrists and Lawyers destroying mankind  
Drivin em crazy and stealing em blind  
Bankers and Brokers ruling the world  
Storing the silver and hoarding the gold  
  
Aint no use in preachers preaching  
When they dont know what theyre teaching  
The weakest man be strong as Samson  
When youre being held to ransom  
  
Famine and hardship in true living colour  
Constant remindersthe plight of our brother  
Daily starvation our diet of news  
Fed to the teeth with a barrage of views  
  
Aint no use in preachers preaching  
When they dont know what theyre teaching  
The weakest man be strong as Samson  
When youre being held to ransom  
  
Black men and white men and Arabs and Jews  
Causing congestion and filling the queues  
Fighting for freedom the truth and the word  
Fighting the war for the end of the world  
  
Aint no use in preachers preaching  
When they dont know what theyre teaching  
Weakest man be strong as Samson  
When youre being held to ransom
