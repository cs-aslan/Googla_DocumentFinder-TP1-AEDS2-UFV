Ive made some decisions  
Never not the best  
Against my better judgment  
I must confess  
  
I went astray so many ways  
So my dreams fall apart  
And came a day Im glad to say  
I followed my heart  
  
That feeling the one Im feeling now  
Oh that feeling that turned me all around  
That feeling oh what love can do  
That feeling that never lets me down  
  
Oh that feeling that always come around  
I never need another  
Its gonna last my whole life through  
That feeling Im feeling for you  
  
Looking in the mirror  
Reflecting on the past  
Memories or misery  
Thats all fading fast  
  
These eyes over my shoulder  
Oh they made me realize  
Ive made the right decision  
The day I recognized  
  
That feeling the one Im feeling now  
Oh that feeling that turned me all around  
That feeling oh what love can do  
That feeling that never lets me down  
  
Oh that feeling that always come around  
I never need another  
Its gonna last my whole life through  
That feeling Im feeling for you  
  
I never need another  
Its gonna last my whole life through  
That feeling Im feeling for you
