Let it bleed until you run dry  
Let it bleed tomorrows never gonna come  
  
Cause the black rain is fallin tonight  
I cant find my way home  
Cause the black rain is fallin tonight  
I cant find my way home  
  
I cant take all of the bad days  
When it rains its better not to go outside  
  
Cause the black rain is fallin tonight  
I cant find my way home  
Cause the black rain is fallin tonight  
I cant find my way home  
  
Going all the way down oh yeah  
Going all the way down its coming down  
  
Let it bleed until you run dry  
Let it bleed tomorrows never gonna come  
  
Cause the black rain is fallin tonight  
I cant find my way home  
Cause the black rain is fallin tonight  
I cant find my way home  
  
Its coming down oh its coming down yeah
