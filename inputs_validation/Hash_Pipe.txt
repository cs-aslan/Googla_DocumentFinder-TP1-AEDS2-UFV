Uhhh  
I cant help my feelings  
Ill go out of my mind  
These playas out to get me  
Cause they like my behind  
I cant love my business  
If I cant get a trick  
Down on Santa Monica where tricks arent for kids  
  
Chorus  
Whoa  
Cmon and kick me  
Whoa  
Cmon and kick me  
Whoaohoh  
Cmon and kick meee  
Whoaohoh  
You got your problems  
Whoaohoh  
I got my eyes wide  
Whoaohoh  
You got your big Gs  
I got my hash pipe  
  
Uhhh  
I cant help my bookies  
They get out of control  
I know that you dont care  
But I want you to know  
The least likely flavor is from the favorite treat  
Abandon the bottle for the taste of her teat  
  
Chorus x2
