Rain please go away  
Leave me alone come another day  
My love is gone this time to stay  
Rain please go away  
  
Its tough to live the whole day through  
Thinkin of her is all I do  
Shes happy now and Im so blue  
Rain shes cold like you  
  
If only the time wouldnt drag so slow  
Find a new love and let it grow  
Im kiddin myself it dont happen that way  
Rain please go away  
  
Rain please go away  
Leave me alone come another day  
My love is gone this time to stay  
Rain please go away
