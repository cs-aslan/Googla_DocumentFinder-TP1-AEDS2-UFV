What if theres no more fun to have  
And all I got is what Ive had  
What if I have forgotten how  
Cut my losses and get out now  
Get out right now  
  
Theres something stronger than me  
Theres something I dont want to see  
A new thing growing in me  
  
It is the hardest thing to  
To watch it grow on top of you  
And see youre just like everyone  
No fun  
  
Theres something stronger than me  
Theres something I dont want to see  
A new thing growing in me  
Theres something I dont want to see  
  
I dont speak that language anymore  
My blood is not that color anymore  
My blood dont shine the same way anymore  
I cannot deny it anymore  
No  
  
Theres something stronger than me  
Theres something I dont want to see  
Got a new thing growing in me  
Theres something I dont want to see  
Theres something stronger than me  
Theres something I dont want to see  
A new thing growing in me
