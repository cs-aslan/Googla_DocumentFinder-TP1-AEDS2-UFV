Somethings wrong in this house today  
While the master was riding the servants decided to play  
Somethings wrong in this house today  
Somethings been going on there may be a price to pay  
Theres evil brewing getting out of control  
And Im helpless I cant put it right  
Something unrighteous is possessing my soul  
And its cold in the heat of the night  
Somethings wrong in this house today  
While the sorcerer slept the apprentice decided to play  
While the master was hiding the servants decided to play  
Might be too much sun or too much of something in the air  
Whatevers happening nobody else is aware  
Theres evil brewing getting out of control  
And Im helpless I cant put it right  
Something unrighteous is possessing my soul  
And its cold in the heat of the night  
Somethings wrong in this house today  
Somethings been going on there may be a price to pay
