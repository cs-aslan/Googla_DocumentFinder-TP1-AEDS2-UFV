Im gonna walk myself into town and ride on back  
Guess it means youre quick and Im clean  
My sparkling machine  
Its only forty minutes by feet  
Ill be back in three  
Ride to the hills at night  
To watch the lights go down and your neighbours fight  
Cause Im the boy to keep you up at night  
  
Its a magic carpet and chrome  
Cant reach me by phone  
A new deck of cards through the wheels  
To show you just deep I feel  
In the rear view mirrors I see  
My dust as youre following me  
Drag to the corner at night  
To watch the lights go down and your parents die  
Cause Im the boy to keep you up at night  
Im the boy to keep you up at night  
  
To keep you decent seven days a week  
Cause its the second best thing I do with my feet  
Watch your ass cause I know where you live  
And which car you drive  
  
I can look anyone in the eye  
Eat my dust as I leave you behind  
Ill follow you to your house  
Do you want to kiss at mine  
Cause Im the boy to keep you up at night  
Im the boy to keep you up at night  
Im the boy to keep you up at night
