Its outrageous to line your pockets off the misery of the poor  
Outrageous the crime some human beings must endure  
Its a blessing to wash your face in the summer solstice rain  
Its outrageous a man like me stand here and complain  
  
But Im tired nine hundred situps a day  
Im painting my hair the colour of mud mud okay  
Im tired tired  
Anybody care what I say No  
Im painting my hair the colour of mud  
  
Whos gonna love you when your looks are gone  
Tell me whos gonna love you when your looks are gone  
Aw whos gonna love you when your looks are gone  
Whos gonna love you when your looks are gone  
Whos gonna love you when your looks are gone  
Whos gonna love you when your looks are gone  
Whos gonna love you when your looks are gone  
  
Its outrageous the food they try to serve in a public school  
Outrageous the way they talk to you like youre some kind of clinical fool  
Its a blessing to rest my head in the circle of your love  
Its outrageous I cant stop thinking about the things Im thinking of  
  
And Im tired nine hundred situps a day  
Im painting my hair the colour of mud mud okay  
Im tired tired anybody care what I say No  
Painting my hair the colour of mud  
  
Whos gonna love you when your looks are gone  
Tell me whos gonna love you when your looks are gone  
Tell me whos gonna love you when your looks are gone  
  
God will  
Like he waters the flowers on your window sill  
Take me Im an ordinary player in the key of C  
And my will was broken by my pride and my vanity  
  
Whos gonna love you when your looks are gone  
God will  
Like he waters the flowers on your window sill  
Whos gonna love you when your looks are gone
