And I dont want you and I dont need you  
Dont bother to resist or Ill beat you  
Its not your fault that youre always wrong  
The weak ones are there to justify the strong  
The beautiful people the beautiful people  
The beautiful people the beautiful people  
The worms will live in every host  
Its hard to pick which one they eat the most  
The horrible people the horrible people  
Its as anatomic as the size of your steeple  
Capitalism has made it this way  
Oldfashioned fascism will take it away  
Theres no time to discriminate  
Hate every motherfucker thats in your way break it away  
Hey you what do you see  
Something beautiful something free  
Hey you are you trying to be mean  
You live with apes man its hard to be clean  
The beautiful people the beautiful people  
The beautiful people the beautiful people  
And I dont want you and I dont need you  
Dont bother to resist or Ill beat you  
Its not your fault that youre always wrong  
The weak ones are there to justify the strong  
Hey you what do you see  
Something beautiful something free  
Hey you are you trying to be mean  
You live with apes man its hard to be clean  
Hey you what do you see  
Something beautiful something free  
Hey you are you trying to be mean  
You live with apes man its hard to be clean
