Rainy night Im all alone  
Sittin here waitin for your voice on the phone  
Fever turns to cold cold sweat  
Thinkin about things we aint done yet  
  
Tell me now Ive got to know do you feel the same  
Do you just light up at the mention of my name  
  
Dont worry baby it aint nothin new  
Thats just love sneakin up on you  
If your whole worlds shakin and you feel like I do  
Thats just love sneakin up on you  
  
Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide  
Once love comes sneakin upon your blindside  
And you might as well try to stop the rain  
Or stand in the tracks of a runaway train  
  
You just cant fight it when a thing is meant to be  
So come on lets finish what you started with me  
  
Dont worry baby it aint nothin new  
Thats just love sneakin up on you  
If your whole worlds shakin and you feel like I do  
Thats just love sneakin up on you
