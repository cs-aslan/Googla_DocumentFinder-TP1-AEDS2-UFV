I shake the dust from this small town  
I turn and follow the western wind down  
I go and pack up my shiny things  
And go yeah just go  
  
Ill find a new life in old LA  
Yeah stupid happy with everything  
I pulled myself down so easily  
I know I know I know  
  
I met Electra when living down  
Saw her spinning around and around  
I never knew much about her past  
I knew enough that I didnt ask  
living isnt a simple thing  
  
I know  
No one ever said its supposed to be  
I know  
July she lied  
  
Living isnt a simple thing for me  
I know ways to make it easier
