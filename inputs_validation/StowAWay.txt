Hey hey I am the stowaway  
Hey hey I am the stowaway  
  
  
My girl turned blue as an iceberg do  
And me Im totally shipwrecked over her  
Baby baby dont blow away  
Hey hey I am the stowaway  
I am the stowaway  
  
  
This is your captain talking to ya  
This is your captain talking to ya  
This is your captain talking to ya  
This is your captain talking to ya  
  
  
Heartache
