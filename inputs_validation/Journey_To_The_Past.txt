Heart dont fail me now  
Courage dont desert me  
Dont turn back now that were here  
People always say  
Life is full of choices  
No one ever mentions fear  
Or how the world can seem so vast  
On a journey to the past  
  
Somewhere down this road  
I know someones waiting  
Years of dreams just cant be wrong  
Arms will open wide  
Ill be safe and wanted  
Finally home where I belong  
Well starting now Im learning fast  
On this journey to the past  
  
Home love family  
There was once a time I must have had them too  
Home love family  
I will never be complete until I find you  
  
One step at a time  
One hope then another  
Who knows where this road may go  
Back to who I was  
On to find my future  
Things my heart still needs to know  
  
Yes let this be a sign  
Let this road be mine  
Let it lead me to my past  
And bring me home At last
