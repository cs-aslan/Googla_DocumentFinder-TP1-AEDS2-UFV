Dont play  
Dont play with my heart  
  
You can stop my heart  
Love is here and now youre gone  
Oh please dont tear apart  
Baby I am so alone  
Were looking on the same stars  
And on the same moon  
What have I done to you lady  
Oh wherever you are please come back soon  
Cant you see Im waiting for you  
  
Oh dont play with my heart  
Dont do that again  
If you tear it apart I cannot be your friend  
Dont play with my heart  
Again and again  
If you tear it apart  
How this love will end  
  
Dont play playing tricks with my heart dont play playing tricks with my
heart dont play playing tricks with my heart dont play playing tricks
with my heart  
Oh you know its true  
I gave you every single day  
Now its up to you  
Baby please dont go away  
  
Oh well find paradise  
And well loose it all  
What have I done to you lady  
Dont tell me no lies  
Just give me a call  
Cant you see Im waiting for you
