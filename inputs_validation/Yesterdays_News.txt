well traveling to the pointthat I I cant stop it  
get so familiar  
never get enough  
talk about it all the time  
just drop it  
damage on your pretty little eyes says it all  
I cant stand to be under your wing  
I cant fly or sink or swimits a lot like falling downstanding up and Im
falling downyour my cup till I understand  
wait a minute and see the pieces dont fit this time  
well yesterdays news is what I have been reading  
see you at the Comet and I end up needing  
know if you were thinking it could have been  
it was nothing its cause nothings what you did  
I cant stand to be under your wing  
I cant fly or sink or swimits a lot like falling downstanding up and Im
falling downyour my cup till I understand  
wait a minute and see the pieces dont fit this time
