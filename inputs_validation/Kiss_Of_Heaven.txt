Im walking a new walk  
Ill never be the same again  
Dancing a new dance in  
Your Holy Spirit Rain  
Your breath of life has overwhelmed me  
And set my spirit free  
Im living a new life underneath Your morning star  
Running a new race in the shadow of Your love  
Your love is immeasurable too deep to comprehend  
  
My Jesus dreammaker  
My Jesus livegiver  
Im living under the Kiss of Heaven  
And Ill never ever be the same again  
  
Im singing a new song in the presence of The King  
Giving You my heart  
That is all that I can bring  
You lit a fire inside of me  
That I thought would never burn again  
I thank You my Father for all Youve done  
And all Youre going to do  
My past behind me and You before me  
I press on for more  
Im living in the embrace of Heaven  
And Ill never ever be the same again
