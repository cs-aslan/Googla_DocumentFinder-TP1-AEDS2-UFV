Makes no difference now what kind of life fate hands me  
Ill get along without you now thats plain to see  
I dont care what happens next cause Ill get by somehow  
I dont worry cause it makes no difference now  
It was just a year ago when I first met you  
I learned to love you and I thought you loved me too  
But now thats all in the past and Ill forget somehow  
I dont worry cause it makes no difference now  
Instrumental  
Now that we have really parted I cant believe were through  
I dont blame myself and Im sure I cant blame you  
I know that something had to happen and it happened somehow  
I dont worry cause it makes no difference now  
After all is said and done Ill soon forget you  
Although I know that it will be so hard to do  
Let things happen as they will and Ill get by somehow  
I dont worry cause it makes no difference now
