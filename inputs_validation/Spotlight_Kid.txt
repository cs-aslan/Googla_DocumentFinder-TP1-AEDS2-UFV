You dont know whats happenin you want to go home  
But theres nowhere to hide  
You walk out on stage your first time alone  
The crowds going wild  
  
And you feel so alive  
You could stand up and take this all night  
They love you but youre in love with the spotlight  
Youre the spotlight kid  
  
Jokers and women they hang round your door  
Theyre all part of the scene  
Just like a junkie youve got to have more  
Its a pleasure machine  
  
And you fly every night  
But the dressing room mirror dont lie  
They love you but youre in love with the spotlight  
Youre the spotlight kid  
  
Your audience died faded away  
Its been so many years since that first matinee  
It seems like an age  
Encore one more time  
  
For the ghosts of the part in your mind  
They love you but youre in love with the spotlight  
  
Youre the spotlight kid  
Youre living in a dream  
Youre the spotlight kid  
Youre in love with the spotlight
