Can you tell me tell me friend just exactly where Ive been  
Is that so much to ask Ill pay you back no matter what the task  
You seem really sure bout something I dont know  
take that load off looks like chests about to go  
Your wasted words already been heard are you really God yes or no  
  
Well all day and half the night youre walkin round lookin such a fright  
Is it me or is it you Id make a wager and Id hope you lose  
Times gone looks like Rome is bout to fall  
Next time take the elevator please dont crawl  
Your wasted words so absurd are you really Satan yes or no  
  
Well I aint no saint and you sure as hell aint no savior  
Every other Christmas I would practice good behavior  
That was then this is now dont ask me to be Mister Clean  
cause baby I dont know how  
Ring my phone bout ten more times we will see  
find that broke down line and let it be  
Your wasted words will never be heard go on home baby and watch it on TV  
  
Weekday soapbox specialty you know what Im talkin bout now  
By the way this songs for you sincerely me
