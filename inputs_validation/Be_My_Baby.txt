Ooh there could be love in your eyes  
I could be loving you deep my baby  
Ooh there could be love in your soul  
I wanna feel the emotion  
  
Ooh there could be love in your heart  
I want to feel it so deep down baby  
Ooh I could love you so bad  
I want to give you devotion  
  
Oh whats the matter with me now baby  
Feelings are mixed up inside  
Come along and be mine only child  
  
Youd better be careful or you might just get  
What you are looking for  
Now Im in chains  
Not exactly what Im looking for  
  
Ooh Im putting magic aside  
I love the look in your eyes now baby  
Ooh it tells me youre mine  
I wanna dive in your ocean  
  
Oh whats the matter with me now baby  
Feelings are mixed up inside  
Come along and be mine only child  
  
Youd better be careful or you might just get  
What you are looking for  
Now Im in chains  
Not exactly what Im looking for  
  
Youd better be careful or you might just get  
What you are looking for  
Now Im in chains  
Not exactly what Im looking for
