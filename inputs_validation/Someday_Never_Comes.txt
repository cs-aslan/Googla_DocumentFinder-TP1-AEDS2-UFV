First thing I remember was asking papa why  
For there were many things I didnt know  
And daddy always smiled and took me by the hand  
Saying someday youll understand  
  
Chorus  
Well Im here to tell you now each and every mothers son  
That you better learn it fast you better learn it young  
Cause someday never comes  
  
Well time and tears went by and I collected dust  
For there were many things I didnt know  
When daddy went away he said try to be a man  
And someday youll understand  
  
Well Im here to tell you now each and every mothers son  
That you better learn it fast you better learn it young  
Cause someday never comes  
  
And then one day in April I wasnt even there  
For there were many things I didnt know  
A son was born to me Mama held his hand  
Sayin someday youll understand  
  
Well Im here to tell you now each and every mothers son  
That you better learn it fast you better learn it young  
Cause someday never comes  
Ooo someday never comes  
  
Think it was September the year I went away  
For there were many things I didnt know  
And I still see him standing tryin to be a man  
I said someday youll understand  
  
Well Im here to tell you now each and every mothers son  
That you better learn it fast you better learn it young  
Cause someday never comes  
Ooo someday never comes
