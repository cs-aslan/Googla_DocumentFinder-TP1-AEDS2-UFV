Ahhhm  
Mhhh  
  
Oh yeah  
  
I would give up everything  
Before Id seperate myself from you  
After so much suffering  
I finally found unvarnished truth  
I was all by myself for the longest time  
So cold inside  
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside  
I felt like dying  
Until you saved my life  
  
Thank God I found you  
Yeah yeah  
I was lost without you  
I was lost  
My every wish and every dream  
Mmmmh  
Somehow became reality  
When you brought the sunlight  
Completed my whole life  
Im overwhelmed with graditude  
Cause baby Im so thankful I found you  
  
Mmmh

Theres nothing in this world I wouldnt do oh no  
To ensure your happiness  
Ill cherish every part of you  
Cause without you beside me I cant survive  
Dont wanna try

If you keeping me warm each and every night  
Ill be allright be allright  
Cause I need you in my life

See I was so desolate before you came to me  
Looking back looking back  
I guess it shows that we were destined  
To shine over the rain to appreciate  
The gift of what we have  
And Id go through it all over again  
To be able to feel  
This way
