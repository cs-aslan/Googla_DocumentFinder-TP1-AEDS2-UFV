Why do you laugh at me when you know I really care  
You sometimes act as though Im not even there  
And yet if you did to me the things I do to you  
I would surely say were through  
  
Chorus  
Dont you know that I love you  
I was hoping youd love me too  
Dont you know that I love you love you  
  
If I seem to you indifferent once or twice  
Its because I was feelin quite that way  
And the time I hung up the phone and didnt speak again  
Well its funny to look back then  
  
Didnt I love you Love you  
Didnt I love you all the time  
Didnt you need me Need me  
Wasnt it a long hard climb  
  
Chorus
