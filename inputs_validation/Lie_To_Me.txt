Chorus x2  
Come on and lay with me  
Come on and lie to me  
Tell me you love me  
Say Im the only one  
  
Experiences have a lasting impression  
But words once spoken  
Dont mean a lot now  
Belief is the way  
The way of the innocent  
And when I say innocent  
I should say naive  
So lie to me  
But do it with sincerity  
Make me listen  
Just for a minute  
Make me think  
Theres some truth in it  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Promises made for convenience  
Arent necessarily  
What we need  
Truth is a word  
Thats lost its meaning  
The truth has become  
Merely halftruth  
So lie to me  
Like they do it in the factory  
Make me think  
That at the end of the day  
Some great reward  
Will be coming my way
