Dont call on me  
When youre feelin footloose  
And fancy free  
Youve done that before  
And like a fool I  
Came back for more  
  
Its all over now  
Ive finally seen my way  
I need you no more  
Not now or any other day  
  
Okay little girl  
Live for yourself in your own little world  
I know that youll find  
Someone wholl play at love  
Be just your kind  
Be just your kind
