Im trying not to wonder what youre doing now and it still hurts somehow  
Our pictures disappeared with communications down and Im living out of town  
But the formula for love was found to be untrue  I wait for you  
To call me up someday and tell me that youre wrongits been too long  
And the formula for love was found to be untrue  I wait for you  
Dont try to tell me that my love for you was wrong  
And dont try to tell me that you knew it all along  
You never loved you dont know how  
And I feel bad for you right now  
  
Im trying not to wonder whose heart youll break this time  
You can bet it wont be mine
