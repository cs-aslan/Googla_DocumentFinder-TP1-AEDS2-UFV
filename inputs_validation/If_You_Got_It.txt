If you got it  
Dont lose it girl its got to be  
The one creative thing thats left for you and me  
If you find it  
Dont lose it all the very next day  
Lock it in your soul and throw the key away  
  
So dont you let it go  
Let it stay let it grow  
Like the snow  
Dont let it melt away  
If you find it  
Then give it girl with all your might  
Forget about yourself youre not the losin kind  
  
If you get it  
Then keep it cool dont let it die  
You may only see it once dont let it pass you by  
So dont you let it go  
Let it stay let it grow  
Like the snow  
Dont let it melt away  
  
If you find it  
Then give it girl with all your might  
Forget about yourself youre not the losin kind  
  
If you get it  
Then keep it cool dont let it die  
You may only see it once dont let it pass you by  
Pass you by dont let it die  
Dont let it go
