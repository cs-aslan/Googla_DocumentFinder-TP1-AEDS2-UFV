Thats when our hearts knew that story untold

The fountain of love founttain of love  
Do you remember I held you so near  
Our loves glowing ember so precious and dear  
We were young lovers strolling near  
The fountain of love the fountain of love

We made a wish and threw in a coin  
And since that day our hearts have been joined  
So all you young lovers wherever you are  
The fountain of love is not very far  
Well go on dreaming of that golden day  
And remember the fountain is not far away
