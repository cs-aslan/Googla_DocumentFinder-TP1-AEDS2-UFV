Youre lining your pockets  
For no other reason  
Than to buy up the things  
That I gave without reasonable pay  
  
Well hello my old friend  
You know Ive been away  
Im not asking for much  
But please remember my name  
  
Cause youve been lining your pockets  
For no other reason  
Than to buy up the things  
That I gave without reasonable pay  
  
Well I wondered through fortune  
And I flirted with fame  
But we never got the money  
We always gave it away  
  
Said youve been lining your pockets  
For no other reason  
Than to buy up the things  
That I gave without reasonable pay  
  
Old benchmark on the park  
He got lost on the world  
But he doesnt seem to know  
About any of it at all  
  
He said  
All the things that I wanted  
You know I had to pay and pay and pay  
And so I say  
  
Youre lining your pockets  
for no other reason  
Than to buy up the things  
That I gave without reasonable pay  
  
Yeah youve been lining your pockets  
For no other reason  
Than to buy up the things  
That I gave without reasonable pay  
  
Youre lining your pockets  
For no other reason  
Than to buy up the things  
That I gave without reasonable pay
