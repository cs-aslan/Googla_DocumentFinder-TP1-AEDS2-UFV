Theres a girl next door to me whos round the bend  
But she wonders why she cant make any friends  
From her garden she could see me  
In her silverclad bikini  
Singing dancing round her fruit tree  
  
Here we go round the lemon tree  
Mister cant you hear me  
Here we go round the lemon tree  
Mister dont come near me  
  
Could I calm her down by throwing stones at her  
If only I could make the right approach to her  
Think Id rather tame a tiger  
Turn those lemons into cider  
Still Id like to get beside her  
  
Chorus  
  
Three oclock in the morning  
I could her her toneless singing  
I could smell her lemon perfume in the air  
I walked up to the window  
In the hope that I might see her  
Could the deadly shade of night still bring her there  
  
Chorus  
  
Morning came and into action went my plans  
Went to meet her dressed in bright green underpants  
I crept in and sang discreetly  
Seemed to change your mind discreetly  
Danced together singing sweetly  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus
