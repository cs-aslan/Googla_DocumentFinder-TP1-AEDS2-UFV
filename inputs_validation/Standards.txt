Oh we make the standards and we make the rules  
And if you dont abide by them you must be a fool  
We have the power to control the whole land  
You never must question our motives or plans   
cause well outlaw your voices do anything we want  
weve nothing to fear from the nation  
Well throw you out of your houses if you get too much  
If we have to well destroy your generation  
  
cause weve built up a frontage and weve gained respect  
theres no one to endanger our position   
  
Standards rule ok  
Standards rule ok  
Standards rule ok  
Standards rule ok  
  
And we dont like people who stand in our way  
Awareness is gonna be redundant  
And ignorance is strength we have God on our side  
Look you know what happend to winston
