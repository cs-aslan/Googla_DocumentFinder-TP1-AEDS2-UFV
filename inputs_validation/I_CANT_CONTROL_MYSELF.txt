I cant stand still cause youve got me goin  
Your slacks are low and your hips are showin  
I take you girl as youre standin there  
Your low cut slacks and your long black hair  
Dont want you goin round with no one else  
Cause when Im with you I cant control myself  
  
Defenses down and you got me shakin  
You got me so that my nerves are breakin  
If you knew me like I know you girl  
Your knees would bend and your hair would curl  
You make me move yea like no one else  
Cause when Im with you I cant control myself  
  
Ive got this feeling thats inside of me  
It makes me think of how things used to be  
It makes me feel alright  
When Im with you at night and we love  
And we love  
  
You thrill me so with this big temptation  
This kind of feelin could move a nation  
And Im okay when Im here with you  
I do the things that you want me to  
I do these things for no one else cause when Im with you I cant control
myself  
  
I cant control myself  
I cant control myself  
I cant control myself  
I cant control myself  
I cant control myself baby
