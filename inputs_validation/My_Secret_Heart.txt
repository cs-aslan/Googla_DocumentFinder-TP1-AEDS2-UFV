I look at your picture  
And stare into space  
I think I must know  
Every line on your face  
And youll never know  
The feelings I keep  
Like the man in the moon  
Youre way out of reach  
  
So dreams are all I have  
Because were worlds apart  
All alone with my secret heart  
  
I write you these letters  
That Ill never send  
Its crazy I know  
But still I pretend  
Though weve never met  
Dont think Im naive  
I know you so well  
Though its all make believe  
  
And dreams are all I have  
Because youre far away  
All alone with my secret heart  
All alone with my secret heart  
  
I must have held your hand  
A thousand times  
And felt your heart was beating  
Next to mine  
Even though its just a lie  
There are no tears in my eyes  
  
If your picture could speak to me  
What would you say  
Maybe youd just have to  
Laugh in my face  
  
And dreams would be much better  
Than reality  
  
All alone with my secret heart
