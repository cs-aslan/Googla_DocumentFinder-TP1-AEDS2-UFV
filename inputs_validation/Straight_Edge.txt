Im a person just like you  
But Ive got better things to do  
Than sit around and fuck my head  
Hang out with the living dead  
Snort white shit up my nose  
Pass out at all the shows  
  
I dont even think about Speed  
Thats something I just dont need  
  
Ive got the straight edge  
  
Im a person just like you  
But Ive got better things to do  
Than sit around and smoke dope  
Cause I know I can cope  
Laugh at the thought of eating ludes  
Laugh at the thought of sniffing glue  
Always gonna keep in touch  
Never want to use a crutch  
  
Ive got the straight edge
