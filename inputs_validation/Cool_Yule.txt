From Coney Island to The Sunset Strip  
Somebodys gonna make a happy trip  
Tonight while the moon is bright  
  
Hes gonna have a bag of crazy toys  
To give the Groanies of the boys and girls  
So dig Santa comes on big  
  
Hell come acallin when the snows the most  
When all you cats are sleepin warm as toast  
And you gonna flip when old Saint Nick  
Takes a lick on the peppermint stick

And fill the stocking by the fire place  
So youll have a yule thats cool
