Neil Young various dates  
Mindless drifter on the roadwhy do I  
Carry such an easy loadwhy do I  
Its how you look and how you feelwhy do I  
You must have a heart of steelwhy do I  
Why do I keep fuckin up  
I can see you on a hillwhy do I  
Comatose but walking stillwhy do I  
Curves beneath your flowing gown why do I  
Only I could bring you downwhy do I  
Why do I keep fuckin up  
Dogs that lick and dogs that bitewhy do I  
Hounds that howl through the nightwhy do I  
Broken leashes all over the floorwhy do I  
Keys left hanging in a swinging doorwhy do I  
Why do I keep fuckin up  
Fuckin upfuckin upfuckin up
