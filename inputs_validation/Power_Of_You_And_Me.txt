Everybodys talking the world is goin round  
Rumors are flying all over the town  
How could a stranger know whats still a  
mystery to me  
  
I dont know what to call it  
I dont know what it is  
I only know for certain Ive never felt like this  
And baby its the one thing I can believe  
  
Theres nothing I fear in this life  
Long as Ive got you by my side  
  
Chorus  
Were mighty as a hurricane tougher than stone  
Stronger than anything Ive ever known  
One look at us together anybody could see  
There aint nothin that can stand up to  
The power of you and me  
  
Were only good together no good on our own  
Everything about you feels just like home  
Before you I dont remember how I got along  
  
You are the spark to my flame  
The only one that burns in your name  
  
Chorus  
So many souls searching for  
What were holding right in our hands  
Youre the woman that makes me a better man  
  
Chorus
