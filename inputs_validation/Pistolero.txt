Pistolero Pistolerowhere do you ride Pistolero Pistoleroyou ride alone

One of brothers five one day vowed to try to make his way  
Joined the cattle drive to Mexicothrew in with some bandidos  
Here he learned the lingo killed the man they call him Pistolero  
Five thousand pesos they put on your head  
Five thousand pesos to get you alive or dead  
Ride on ride hard in vaquero fast as you can to her side  
Ah but por mucho dinero el noveno por nada have died  
  
Pistolero Pistolerowhere do you roam Pistolero Pistoleroon your way home  
Everytime a candle burns waiting there for your return  
The candle is out PistoleroI see the cabin down below  
Pistolero let her gotonight youre mine Pistolero  
Five thousand pesos they put on your head  
Five thousand pesos to get you alive or dead  
Ah Pistolero Look around youyour son has set in the sky  
Oh Pistolero I found you kiss Maria tell Maria goodbye  
Pistolero Pistolero lay your head down  
Pistolero Pistolero six feet underground
