Little blue dreamer go to sleep  
Lets close our eyes and call the deep  
Slumbering land that just begins  
When day is done the little dreamer spins  
  
First take my hand now let it go  
Little blue boy youre on your own  
Little blue wings as those feet fly  
Little blue shoes that walk across the sky  
  
May your path be your own  
But Im with you  
And each day that you grow  
Hell be there too  
And someday when youve grown  
Well follow you  
As you grow  
As you grow  
  
Little blue star that offers light  
Little blue bird that offers flight  
Little blue path where those feet fall  
Little blue dreamer wont you dream it all  
  
Refrain  
  
And in your travels you will see  
Warrior wings think of Daddy  
And if a mama bird you see  
Folding her wings will you remember me  
  
Refrain  
  
As you grow  
As you grow
