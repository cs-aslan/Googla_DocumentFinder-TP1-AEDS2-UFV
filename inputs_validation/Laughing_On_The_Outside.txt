The crowd sees me out dancing  
Carefree and romancing  
Happy with my someone new  
Im laughing on the outside  
Crying on the inside  
Cause Im still in love with you  
They see me night and daytime  
Having such a gay time  
They dont know what I go through  
Im laughing on the outside  
Crying on the inside  
Cause Im still in love with you  
No one knows its just a pose  
Pretending Im glad were apart  
And when I cry my eyes are dry  
The tears are in my heart  
My darling cant we make up  
Ever since our breakup  
Make believe is all I do  
Im laughing on the outside  
Crying on the inside  
Cause Im still in love  
I am still in love with you
