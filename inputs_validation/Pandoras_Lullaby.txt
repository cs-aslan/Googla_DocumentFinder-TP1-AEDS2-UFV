So you hugged the globe  
Now its whirling too fast  
I really got no hope to hang on to the past  
The train has departed the toxins have started  
To announce that none will last  
I cower in the gutter of a world thats not so near  
And I listen to their mutters that are spinning through the air  
The words unspoken the promises broken  
And the ones who really care  
Im the watcher of the scene  
I see our shadows on the screen  
And when the subway brakes to preserve some suicidal bee  
I stop to breathe for a while  
Maybe it was me  
This is the world gliding by  
Like the driftwood beams  
On a lifetimes stream  
The instant fundamental sky for Pandoras lullaby  
  
I see distorted faces coined like gold  
And in their wrinkles programs that commercial gurus told  
A watermark against a spark  
Umbrellas that they hold  
Im gliding in the distance and watch the world go by  
An orbit full of questions a perforated sky  
But I just sit and wonder a bit that they never wonder why
