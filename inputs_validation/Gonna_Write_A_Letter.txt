Im gonna write a letter gonna mail it today  
Just as soon as I think of the words to say  
Ive been needing to send it for nearly a year  
Theres a woman back home whos waiting to hear  
  
I meant to tell you dear Susannah  
Im a long way from Louisiana and you  
And I know I promised to be returning  
Just as soon as Ive saved the money Im earning for you  
  
But Im married to twins and Im living in Peru  
Well Im gonna write a letter  
Get it off my mind  
But you know the words  
Are so hard to find  
  
Sitting thinking with my pen in my hand  
How can I make her understand  
I meant to tell you dear Julia  
  
Im a long way from the States mosquitoes and you  
Ill send some money to help with the kids  
Id like to thank you for all that you did  
Its true Louisiana and Im with Susannah too  
  
Got me a letter it arrived today  
The words I read just blew me away  
I dont believe Ive ever felt so low  
How could Susannah treat me so  
  
She said I meant to tell you my sweet honey  
Im a long way from your love your money and you  
Please dont think me under  
  
And I do believe youll understand me too  
I got a bar and grill with Phil in Kalamazoo
