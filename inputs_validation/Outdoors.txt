All day Ive been inside  
And Ive got the feeling  
Im trapped between the walls  
And underneath the ceiling  
I feel a bit off track  
And now Im trying to get back  
  
Back in the cool cool air  
Where the sun in shining  
Nothings gonna stop me  
Its all in the timing  
Its finally again my turn  
Its time to return  
  
Cause I wont stay inside  
No more no more  
I cannot wait to go outdoors  
Mmmhmmhmmhmm  
Hey hey hey Elmo  
  
Well open up your door  
And be like me  
Open up your door  
And then breathe free  
Look at all the beauty youll feel  
Love love love love  
  
Listen to the music of the wind  
And the birdies sing  
Were just one big family  
And all of nature deserves to be  
Loved loved loved loved loved  
  
So I wont stay inside  
No more no more  
It cannot wait  
Im sure  
Theres no need to run and hide  
Lets go explore  
It feels so great  
  
Lets go outdoors  
  
Do do do do do do do do  
Everyone come on  
Come on out here  
Where the air is fresh and clear  
  
So I wont stay inside  
No more no more  
It cannot wait  
Lets go outdoors  
  
Jason  
Well open up your door  
And be like me  
Open up your door

And youll find the earth  
And the sky is yours
