Memories consume  
Like opening the wounds  
Im picking me apart again  
You all assume  
Im safe here in my room  
Unless I try to start again  
I dont want to be the one the battles always choose  
Cause inside I realize that Im the one confused  
  
I dont know whats worth fighting for  
Or why I have to scream  
I dont know why I instigate  
And say what I dont mean  
I dont know how I got this way  
I know its not alright  
So Im breaking the habit  
Im breaking the habit tonight  
  
Clutching my cure  
I tightly lock the door  
I try to catch my breath again  
I hurt much more than any time before  
I have no options left again  
I dont want to be the one the battles always choose  
Cause inside I realize that Im the one confused  
  
I dont know whats worth fighting for  
Or why I have to scream  
I dont know why I instigate  
And say what I dont mean  
I dont know how I got this way  
Ill never be alright  
So Im breaking the habit  
Im breaking the habit tonight  
  
Ill paint it on the walls  
Cause Im the one at fault  
Ill never fight again  
And this is how it ends  
  
I dont know whats worth fighting for  
Or why I have to scream  
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean  
I dont know how I got this way  
Ill never be alright  
So Im breaking the habit  
Im breaking the habit  
Im breaking the habit tonight
