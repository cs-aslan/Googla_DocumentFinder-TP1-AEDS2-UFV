Now the time has come when all is said and done  
Were back together on the road its time to fly  
No more time to wait you know it feels so great  
Wearin leather on a horse of steel I ride  
I aint waiting to get old Im runnin hot Im never cold  
Kiss my ass if you dont like me I dont care  
I got my wheels I got my friends were on the road again  
Were all crazy gonna ride until we die  
  
Time to burn you losers better learn  
No one controls our goddamn lifes  
Well do just what we feel riding horses made of steel  
Were here to burn up the night  
  
Losers try to put us down its just another day  
I got no money or big house just got life  
I dont like to save its more fun to spend  
If you like metal youre my friend  
And that bike out in the yard well thats my wife  
Dont try to understand me my family never will  
Had to punch my teacher out now hes chilled  
I might stay in school or die in prison  
Either way its my decision one more beer and heavy metal  
And Im just fine  
  
Time to burn you losers better learn  
No one controls our goddamn lifes  
Well do just what we feel riding horses made of steel  
Were here to burn up the night  
  
We are the undefeated were not living in the past  
Were here tonight to kick some goddamn ass  
Feel the power of the wheel lets drink to riding steel  
Livin hard and ridin fast  
  
Time to burn you losers better learn  
No one controls our goddam lifes  
Well do just what we feel riding horses made of steel  
Were here to burn up the night
