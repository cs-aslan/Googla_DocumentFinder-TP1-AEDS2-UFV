Even though its been so long  
My love for you keeps going strong  
I remember the things that we used to do  
A kiss in the rain till the sun shines through  
I tried to deny it but Im still in love with you  
  
I miss you like crazy I miss you like crazy  
Ever since you went away every hour of everyday  
I miss you like crazy I miss you like crazy  
No matter what I say or do  
Theres just no getting over you  
  
I can see the love shinning in your eyes  
And it comes in such a sweet surprise  
If seeing is believing its worth the wait  
So hold on and tell me its not too late  
Were so good together  
Were starting forever now  
  
And I miss you like crazy I miss you like crazy  
Ever since you went away every hour of everyday  
I miss you like crazy I miss you baby  
A love like ours will never end  
Just touch me and were there again  
  
Just one night  
And well have the magic feeling like we used to do  
Hold on tight  
And whatever comes our way were gonna make it through  
  
If seeing is believing its worth the wait  
So hold on and tell me its not too late  
Were so good together  
Were starting forever now  
  
And I miss you like crazy I miss you like crazy  
No matter what I say or do  
Theres just no getting over you  
  
And I miss you baby  
I miss you baby  
All the tender love you gave me  
When a feeling gets this strong  
I know the real thing will come along  
And I miss you  
  
I miss you like crazy baby  
Only your sweet love can make me  
  
I miss you like crazy  
A love like ours will never end  
Just touch me and were there again  
I miss you like crazy  
I miss you like crazy
