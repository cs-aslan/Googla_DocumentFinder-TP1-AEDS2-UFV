Heard it from a friend who  
Heard it from a friend who  
Heard it from another you been messin around  
They say you got a boy friend  
Youre up there every weekend  
Theyre talkin about you and its bringin me down  
  
But I know the neighborhood  
And talk is cheap when the story is good  
And the tales grow taller on down the line  
But Im telling you babe  
That I dont think its true babe  
And even if it is keep this in mind  
  
You take it on the run baby  
If thats the way you want it baby  
Then I dont want you around  
I dont believe it not for a minute  
Youre under the gun so you take it on the run  
  
Youre thinking up your white lies  
Youre putting on your bedroom eyes  
You say youre coming home but you wont say when  
But I can feel it coming  
If you leave tonight keep running  
And you need never look back again  
  
You take it on the run baby  
If thats the way you want it baby  
Then I dont want you around  
I dont believe it not for a minute  
Youre under the gun so you take it on the run  
  
You take it on the run baby  
If thats the way you want it baby  
Then I dont want you around  
I dont believe it not for a minute  
Youre under the gun so you take it on the run  
  
You take it on the run baby  
If thats the way you want it baby  
Then I dont want you around  
I dont believe it not for a minute  
Youre under the gun so you take it on the run  
  
Heard it from a friend who  
Heard it from a friend who  
Heard it from another you been messin around
