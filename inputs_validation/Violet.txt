If theres a way that you could  
Be everything you want to be  
Would you complain that it came too easy  
Just like the games with you and me  
A resolution hard to see  
But thats OK cause I dont  
See things that are plain to see  
  
Ive got a dream to take you over  
Exploding like a supernova  
Im gonna crash into your world  
And thats no lie  
  
You want to give ecstasy delivered  
With certainty  
But youre afraid that the pleasure  
Wont be needed  
In a way were the same two people  
Looking out to sea  
For a wave that would carry all our fantasies  
  
If theres a way to infiltrate you  
Sway your mind and complicate you  
Im gonna crash into your world  
And thats no lie  
  
Let your body move into the doorway  
To the disco inside your head Violet  
Wear a color that you want to cling to  
The color inside your head Violet  
  
Contemplate jealousy intermixed  
With urgency  
A million things take a damned  
Good shot at you and me  
  
If theres a way to infiltrate you  
Sway your mind and complicate you  
Im gonna crash into your world  
And thats no lie  
  
Let your body move into the doorway  
To the disco inside your head Violet  
Wear a color that you want to cling to  
The color inside your head Violet  
  
Im gonna take you  
Ill do my best to break you  
Im gonna take you higher  
And thats no lie  
  
Common sense is a game many  
People dont like to play  
But give it in and the moment takes  
You either way  
  
Ive got a dream to take you over  
Exploding like a supernova  
Im gonna crash into your world  
And thats no lie  
  
Let your body move into the doorway  
To the disco inside your head Violet  
Wear a color that you want to cling to  
The color inside your head Violet  
  
If theres a way that you could  
Be everything you want to be  
Would you complain that it came too easy  
In a way were the same two people  
Looking out to sea  
For a wave that would carry all our fantasies
