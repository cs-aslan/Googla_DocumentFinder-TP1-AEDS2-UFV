Hey kids shake it loose together  
The spotlights hitting something  
Thats been known to change the weather  
Well kill the fatted calf tonight  
So stick around  
Youre gonna hear electric music  
Solid walls of sound  
  
Say Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet  
But theyre so spaced out Bennie and the Jets  
Oh but theyre weird and theyre wonderful  
Oh Bennie shes really keen  
Shes got electric boots a mohair suit  
You know I read it in a magazine  
Bennie and the Jets  
  
Hey kids plug into the faithless  
Maybe theyre blinded  
But Bennie makes them ageless  
We shall survive let us take ourselves along  
Where we fight our parents out in the streets  
To find whos right and whos wrong  
  
Oh Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet  
Oh but theyre so spaced out Bennie and the Jets  
Oh but theyre weird and theyre wonderful  
Oh Bennie shes really keen  
Shes got electric boots a mohair suit  
You know I read it in a magazine oh  
Bennie and the Jets  
  
Oh Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet  
Oh but theyre so spaced out Bennie and the Jets  
Oh but theyre weird and theyre wonderful  
Oh Bennie shes really keen  
Shes got electric boots a mohair suit  
You know I read it in a magazine oh  
Bennie and the Jets
