Saw him sittin on a sidewalk in Fresno  
Braided hair and a tyedyed tshirt on  
Talkin to himself about Vietnam  
About the tour he did and the deal he got  
He saidThis world aint the same if you ask me  
If I could be somewhere else  
Id tell you where Id be  
  
Chorus  
Id be rollin on a river with Creedence  
Stealin kisses from Peggy Sue  
Id be kneedeep in sand on  
A Panama Beach In the spring of 72  
Id be wastin away on the dock of the bay  
Watchin the tide roll in  
He saidWhat I wouldnt give just to  
Live those songs again  
  
Saw him workin the counter at Walgreens  
With a new haircut and a Bachelors Degree  
Talkin to himself about his raw deal  
Cussin Uncle Sam and the GI bill  
He saidThis world aint the same if you ask me  
If I could be somewhere else  
Id tell you where Id be  
  
Chorus  
  
He saidThis world aint the same if you ask me  
If I could be somewhere else  
Id tell you where Id be  
  
Chorus
