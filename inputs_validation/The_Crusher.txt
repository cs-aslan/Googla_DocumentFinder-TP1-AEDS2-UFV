Now I want to wrestle in the garden  
Im on my way to stardom  
I know Im ready I know Im great  
But first Ive got to get in shape  
  
Cause I got my eye on the Russian Bear  
Gonna tear him up I swear  
This guy thinks hes the champion  
Gonna take his belt gonna beat him  
  
Im the Crusher king of the ring 4x  
Im ready for a match with the Russian Bear  
Gonna pile drive him pull his hair  
I might have a foreign object in my trunks  
I might have to use on that punk  
  
Got the hardest hold you can put on anyone  
If youre my victim youre beaten  
Im a lean mean fighting machine  
Powerful and strong like King Kong  
  
Im the Crusher king of the ring 4x  
Started having second thoughts I was scared as hell  
The last thing I wanted was me hearing the bell  
I mean the Russian Bear could probably tear  
Me limb from limb  
Hed probably grin be real happy with himself  
This is not good for my health  
Im not comin outta this dressing room  
And get beaten up by that goon  
  
Go back to Russia  
Go back home  
Dont want to get a broken bone  
Or a lump on my head  
I aint gonna hide under the bed  
  
Im the Crusher king of the ring Repeat x4  
Im the Crusher Crusher Repeat x2
