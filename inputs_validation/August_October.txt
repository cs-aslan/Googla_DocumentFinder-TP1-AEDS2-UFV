Autumn and Friday the winds blew  
July September I knew you  
And now I sit on the sand hill  
I sing our song to the sea  
  
August October  
MidApril November May  
Beckoning hands made you fly  
I cry its curtains today  
  
In August October the grass grew  
The sky was blue and I want you  
Now as I look out my window  
I see the world carry on  
  
August October  
MidApril November May  
Beckoning hands made you fly  
I cry its curtains today  
  
August October  
MidApril November May  
Beckoning hands made you fly  
I cry its curtains today
