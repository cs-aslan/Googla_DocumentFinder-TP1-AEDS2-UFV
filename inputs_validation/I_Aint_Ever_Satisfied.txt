I love the things that scare most folks to death  
But I aint ever satisfied  
Ill stay till the end or till Im gasping my last breath  
But I aint ever satisfied  
No I am never satisfied  
  
I can pretty much come and go as I like  
But I aint ever satisfied  
Hey with no bottomline its hard to know wrong from right  
But I aint ever satisfied  
Ill try anything once but then do it to death  
But I aint ever satisfied  
I expect the worst but I hope for the best  
Oh I aint ever satisfied  
No I aint ever satisfied  
No no no no I am never satisfied  
  
Cant get enough no of nothing  
Ive got seven of everything and more in the till  
But I aint ever satisfied  
You think this is dangerous stuff  
It aint even a thrill  
I aint ever satisfied  
Oh I am never  
No I am never  
I dont know why I aint ever satisfied
