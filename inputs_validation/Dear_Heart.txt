Dear heart  
I wish you could see that  
Dear heart  
You mean the world to me  
  
Man with the broken heart filled with lead  
Suffered and he fought for what he believed  
The fighting is over now the man is dead  
A martyr for the cause  
  
Man with the golden arm his face gone pale  
Taken too much junk hes gone over the rail  
Breathes out a sigh and his body wails  
Hes gonna land in trouble land in jail  
  
Hed give his life give his everything  
To reach that goal and take that last and final fling  
But I guess its just another story  
In the greatest story ever told  
  
Dear heart  
I wish that you could see that  
Dear heart  
You mean the world to me
