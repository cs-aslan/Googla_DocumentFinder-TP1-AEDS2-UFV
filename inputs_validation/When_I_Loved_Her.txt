Well she didnt look as pretty as some others I have known  
And she wasnt good at conversation when we were alone  
But she had a way of making me believe that I belonged  
And it felt like coming home when I found her  
  
She seemed to be so proud of me just walking holding hands  
And she didnt think that money was the measure of a man  
And we seemed to fit together when I held her in my arms  
And it left me feelin warm when I loved her  
  
Chorus  
cause she brightened up the day like the early morning sun  
And she made what I was doin seem worth while  
Its the closest thing to living that I guess Ive ever known  
And it made me want to smile when I loved her  
  
I know some of us were born to cast our fortunes to the winds  
And I guess Im bound to travel down a road that never ends  
But I know Ill never look upon the likes of her again  
And Ill never understand why I lost her  
  
Chorus  
cause she brightened up the day like the early morning sun  
And she made what I was doin seem worth while  
Its the closest thing to living that I guess Ive ever known  
And it made me want to smile when I loved her
