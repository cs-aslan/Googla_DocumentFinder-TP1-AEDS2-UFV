Verse 1  
Wrecking balls downtown construction  
Bottles breaking jukebox buzzing  
Cardboard sign says the lord is coming  
Tick tick tock  
Rumors turn the mills back home  
Parking lot kids with the speakers blown  
We didnt turn it on but we cant turn it off off off  
Sometimes I wonder how did we get here  
Seems like all we ever hear is  
  
Chorus  
Noise  
Yeah we scream yeah we shout til we dont have a voice  
In the streets in the crowds it aint nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
Verse 2  
24 hour television get so loud that no one listens  
Sex and money and politicians talk talk talk  
But there really aint no conversation  
Aint nothing left to the imagination  
Trapped in our phones and we cant make it stop stop  
  
Chorus  
This noise  
Yeah we scream yeah we shout til we dont have a voice  
In the streets in the crowds it aint nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
Bridge  
Every room every house every shade of noise  
All the floors all the walls they all shake with noise  
We cant sleep we cant think cant escape the noise  
We cant take the noise so we just make  
  
Chorus  
Noise  
Yeah we scream yeah we shout til we dont have a voice  
In the streets in the crowds it aint nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
Outro  
All this noise  
Cant take the noise  
Cant take the noise  
Cant stand the noise  
Cant take the noise
