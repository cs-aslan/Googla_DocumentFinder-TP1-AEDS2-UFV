Theres no one to save us its kill or be killed  
Living in a jungle youll hunt with all your skills  
Waiting for a victim your hunger must be fed  
Better see it coming or you will end up dead  
Taste the anger  Im seeing red  
Feel the danger  Sleep when Im dead  
Theres no time for mercy theres no need for sympathy  
Line of fire and chaos in a world of constant greed  
Dont let your guard down theyll be on you in a flash  
Keep it locked and loaded youre heading for a crash  
Theres no second chances  
Youre going full speed  
Headlong into danger  
Your habit needs a feed  
Cant put the brakes on your finished when you stop  
Theres no tomorrow and yesterday is lost
