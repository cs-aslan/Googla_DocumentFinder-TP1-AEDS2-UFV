I put my money in the suitcase  
And headed for the big race  
I felt a chill on my backbone  
As I hung up the telephone  
  
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat  
Running down the back of my neck  
To lose means trouble to win pays double  
And I got me a heavy bet  
  
Cold cold sweat  
  
They say chances on the outside  
Are looking pretty slim  
Ive been so lucky on the inside  
I feel Im going to win  
  
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat  
Running down the back of my neck  
Take a little money theres nothing left to lose  
And I got me a heavy bet  
  
Cold cold sweat  
  
Ive got me a whole months wages  
I havent seen that much in ages  
I might spend it in stages  
And move out to Las Vegas  
  
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat  
Running down the back of my neck  
To lose means trouble to win pays double  
And I got me a heavy bet  
  
Cold cold sweat  
  
I put my money in a suitcase  
They say chances on the outside  
I got a whole months wages  
  
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat  
Stone cold crazy  
Place another bet
