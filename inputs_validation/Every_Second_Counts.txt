Every second counts  
Thats what he says  
Every second counts  
Every single day  
All through the night time  
All through the day time  
Cant let your world pass through and into my way  
  
Every second counts  
He cant slow down  
Every second counts  
See him spin around  
Hes chasing his shadow  
Hes racing the wind  
He tells us to follow  
Where the ice is so thin  
  
I hope youre holding on  
I hope youre holding on  
cause every second counts
