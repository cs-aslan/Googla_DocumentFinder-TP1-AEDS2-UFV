Absent minded me  
Absent minded me  
Im losing a key  
Or missing a glove  
Just like me to lose my love  
Gotta find it absent minded me  
Dizzy dopey me  
Mixedup mopey me  
  
Im way way ahead  
Of the game then it starts  
How did i lose my king of hearts  
Gotta find it absent minded me  
Theres my key  
Gee i left it in the door  
Theres my glove on the shelf  
Now if i dont find my love  
Ill be losing myself  
  
Gotta find him  
Gotta find him  
Absent minded me  
Absent minded me
