Ill take a nicotine caffeine sugar fix  
Jesus dont ya git tired of turnin tricks  
But when your innocence dies  
Youll find the blues  
Seems all our heroes were born to lose  
Just walkin through time  
You believe this heat  
Another empty house another dead end street  
Gonna rest my bones an sit for a spell  
This side of heaven this close to Hell  
  
Right next door to hell  
Why dont you write a letter to me yeah  
I said Im right next door to hell  
An so many eyes are on me  
Right next door to hell  
I got nowhere else to be  
Right next door to hell  
Feels like the walls are closing in on me  
  
My mamma never really said much to me  
She was much too young and scared ta be  
Hell Freud might say thats what I need  
But all I really ever get is greed  
An most my friends they feel the same  
Hell we dont even have ourselves to blame  
But times are hard and thrills are cheaper  
As your arms get shorter  
Your pockets get deeper  
  
Right next door to hell  
Why dont you write a letter to me yeah  
I said Im right next door to hell  
An so many eyes are on me  
Right next door to hell  
I never thought this is where Id be  
Right next door to hell  
Thinkin timell stand still for me  
  
Fuck you  
Bitch  
  
Not bad kids just stupid ones  
Yeah we thought wed own the world  
An gettin used was havin fun  
I said were not sad kids just lucid ones yeah  
Flowin through life not collectin anyone  
So much out there  
Still so much to see  
Times too much to handle  
Times too much for me  
It drives me up the walls  
Drives me out of my mind  
Can you tell me what this meanshuh
