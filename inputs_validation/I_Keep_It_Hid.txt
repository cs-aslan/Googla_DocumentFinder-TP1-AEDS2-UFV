Deep down inside  
I know I still love him  
But hell never know  
Cause Ill never tell  
  
Ill confide that Im thinking of him  
And wishing him well  
I cant walk up to him and say to him  
  
Baby what you been doing  
I still love you like I did  
You know nothings really changed here  
But being the way I am  
I keep it hid  
  
Lately Ive seen  
That look in his eyes  
That just breaks my heart  
He needs me so  
To lean on at this moment  
Oh why cant I walk up to that old love of mine and say  
  
Baby what you been doing  
I still love you like I did  
You know nothings really changed here  
But being the way I am  
I keep it hid  
  
Maybe someday Ill throw off my foolish pride  
This aint so good  
Watching him die this way  
Cause hes the same guy inside  
Oh why cant I walk up to that old love of mine and say  
  
Baby what you been doing  
I still love you like I did  
You know nothings really changed here  
But being the way I am  
I keep it hid
