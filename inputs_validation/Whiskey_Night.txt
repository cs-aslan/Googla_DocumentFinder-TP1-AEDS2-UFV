My eyes are aching from the weight on them  
The pain of living is such a bore  
To make you happy I must bend for you  
But I cant take it anymore  
  
And all the morning birds may laugh at me  
But theyve got the same straight jobs to do  
And I cant see who is the biggest fool of all  
With my eyes all scarred from a whiskey night  
  
I stumbled around with my eyes half closed  
And curse the sun for being so bright  
I hold you close feel your warmth and wonder why  
The river of life for you runs right  
  
And all the morning birds may laugh at me  
But theyve got the same straight jobs to do  
And I cant see who is the biggest fool of all  
With my eyes all scarred from a whiskey night  
  
My head is poundin as Im sittin here  
And my minds not workin like it should  
Come on guitar youve got to save me  
And get me back feelin like I should
