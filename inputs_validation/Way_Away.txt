I think Im breaking out  
Im gonna leave you now  
Theres nothing for me here its all the same  
And even though I know  
That everything might go  
Go downhill from here Im not afraid  
  
Way away away from here Ill be  
Way away away so you can see  
How it feels to be alone and not believe  
Anything  
  
You cant stop me now  
You cant hold me down  
You cant keep me here Im on my way  
I made it this far now  
And Im not burning out  
No matter what you say Im not afraid  
  
Way away away from here Ill be  
Way away away so you can see  
How it feels to be alone and not believe  
Anything  
  
Letting out the noise inside of me  
Every window pane is shattering  
Cutting up my words before I speak  
This is how it feels to not believe  
  
Way away away from here Ill be  
Way away away so you can see  
How it feels to be alone and not believe  
Anything
