Goodbye little darling were parting  
Parting dont always mean goodbye  
Although we have to part youre always in my heart  
Goodbye little darling goodbye  
  
Goodbye little darling Ill miss you  
Miss you as the stars would miss the sky  
I hate to see you go Im gonna miss you so  
Goodbye little darling goodbye  
  
Goodbye little darling Ill love you  
Love you until the day I day  
Please dream a dream of me wherever you may be  
Goodbye little darling goodbye  
  
Please dream a dream of me wherever you may be  
Goodbye little darling goodbye
