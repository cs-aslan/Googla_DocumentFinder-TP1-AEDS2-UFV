I dedicate this song to recession  
Depression and unemployment  
This songs for you  
  
Todays a new day but there is no sunshine  
Nothing but clouds and its dark in my heart  
And it feels like a cold night  
Todays a new day where are my blue skies  
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me  
Tell me its alright  
  
Ill be honest with you  
I almost gave up but a power that I cant explain  
Fell from heaven like a shower  
  
When I think how much better Im gonna be when this is over  
I smile even though I hurt see I smile  
I know God is working so I smile  
Even though Ive been here for a while  
I smile smile  
Its so hard to look up when you been down  
Sure would hate to see you give up now  
You look so much better when you smile so smile  
  
Todays a new day but there is no sunshine  
Nothing but clouds and its dark in my heart  
And it feels like a cold night  
Todays a new day tell me where are my blue skies  
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me  
Tell me its alright  
  
The truth is  
I almost gave up but a power that I cant explain  
Fell from heaven like a shower now  
  
I smile even though I hurt see I smile  
I know God is working so I smile  
Even though Ive been here for a while  
I smile smile  
Its so hard to look up when you been down  
Sure would hate to see you give up now  
You look so much better when you smile  
  
Smile for me  
Can you just smile for me  
Smile for me  
Can you just smile for me  
  
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
  
And while your waiting  
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
And while your praying  
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
Look in the mirror  
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
Always remember  
You look so much better when you smile come on  
  
I almost gave up but a power that I cant explain  
Fell from heaven like a shower now  
  
I smile even though I hurt see I smile  
I know God is working so I smile  
Even though Ive been here for a while  
I smile smile  
Its so hard to look up when you been down  
Sure would hate to see you give up now  
You look so much better when you smile so smile
