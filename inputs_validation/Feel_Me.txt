Verse 1  
No one love you like I love you  
I never cheated never lied  
I never put no one above you  
I gave you space and time  
And now youre telling me you miss me  
And Im still on your mind  
We were one in a million  
Our love is hard to find  
  
PreChorus  
Do you stay up late just so you dont dream  
  
Chorus  
Every time your lips touch another  
I want you to feel me I want you to feel me  
Every time you dance with somebody  
I want you to feel me I want you to feel me  
Do your days get a little bit lonely  
Nights get a little bit colder  
Heartbeat a little bit louder  
Days get a little bit longer  
Nights get a little bit colder  
Heartbeat a little bit louder  
  
Verse 2  
When youre running who you run to  
Where do you go to hide  
When she aint giving you enough to get you through the night  
I wont be caught up in the middle  
Through your highs and your lows  
Baby long as youre not with me youll always be alone  
  
PreChorus  
Do you stay up late just so you dont dream  
  
Chorus  
Every time your lips touch another  
I want you to feel me I want you to feel me  
Every time you dance with somebody  
I want you to feel me I want you to feel me  
Do your days get a little bit lonely  
Nights get a little bit colder  
Heartbeat a little bit louder  
Days get a little bit longer  
Nights get a little bit colder  
Heartbeat a little bit louder
