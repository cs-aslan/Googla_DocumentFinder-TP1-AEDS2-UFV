I dont know why I dont know how  
I thought I loved you but Im not sure now  
Ive seen you look at strangers  
Too many times  
The love you want is of a different kind  
  
All day all day Watch them all fall down  
All day all day Domino dancing  
  
Remember when we felt the sun  
A love like paradise  
How hot it burned  
A threat of distant thunder  
The sky was red  
And where you walked you always  
Turned evry head  
  
All day all day Watch them all fall down  
All day all day Domino dancing  
  
I thought that when we fought  
I was to blame  
But now I know you play  
A different game  
Ive seen you dance with danger  
Still wanting more  
Add another number To the score  
  
All day all day Watch them all fall down  
All day all day Domino dancing  
When you look around you wonder  
Do you play to win or are you just a bad loser  
All day all day All day all day  
  
I dont know why I dont know how  
I thought I loved you but Im not sure now  
I hear the thunder crashing The sky is dark  
And now a storm is breaking Within my heart  
  
All day all day Watch them all fall down  
All day all day Domino dancing  
All day all day Watch them all fall down  
All day all day Domino dancing  
All day all day Watch them all fall down
