Run away to no where  
Too chicken shit to face  
Im gonna go there  
The fear I cannot taste  
You think you got me  
Youre gonna tumble down  
Keep coming for me  
Ill drop you on the ground  
  
I fuck with no one  
Until you get in my face  
  
Break you now  
Mercy I cannot allow  
Through your face my fist will plow  
Watching as your blood pours down  
Lets do this now  
Lets do this now  
  
Youre gonna feel how  
I really am with you  
Youre going no where  
Dont really know what to do  
Its going to go on  
Until you run away  
You cant control me  
You best do in my way  
  
I fuck with no one  
Until you get in my face  
  
Break you now  
Mercy I cannot allow  
Through your face My fist will plow  
Watching as your blood pours down  
Lets do this now  
  
Dont you know that  
You can touch me  
Dont you know that  
You can bring me down  
Oh my life would be so easy now  
If you havent stepped across that line  
Line Line  
  
Break you now  
Mercy I cannot allow  
Through your face My fist will plow  
Watching as your blood pours down  
Lets do this now  
Lets do this now  
Lets do this now  
Lets do this now  
Lets do this now
