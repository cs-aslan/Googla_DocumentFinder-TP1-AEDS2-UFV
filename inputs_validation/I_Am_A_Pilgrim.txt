I am a pilgrim and a stranger  
Traveling through this wearisome land  
Ive got a home in that yonder city good lord  
And its not not made by hand  
  
Ive got a mother sister and a brother  
Who have gone this way before  
I am determined to go and see them good lord  
For theyre on that other shore  
  
Im goin down to the river of Jordan  
Just to bathe my wearisome soul  
If I can just touch the hem of his garment good lord  
Then I know hed take me home  
  
I am a pilgrim and a stranger  
Traveling through this wearisome land  
Ive got a home in that yonder city good lord  
And its not not made by hand
