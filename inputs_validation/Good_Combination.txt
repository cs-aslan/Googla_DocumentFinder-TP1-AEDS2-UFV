Baby dont you worry  
When things aint going right  
Dont be in a hurry  
To run away when youre uptight  
Love is sweet if we stick together  
Solve our problems for forever  
  
Chorus  
Cause we got a good combination  
Yeah we got a good combination  
Cant you see you and me  
Got the key to be happy  
Yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah  
Yeah oh yeah  
  
Baby when youre crying  
Ill love your tears away  
And I will always be trying  
To keep you happy through the years  
As long as we just keep on kissing  
Theres nothing in the world  
We wont be missing  
  
Chorus  
  
As long as we just keep on kissing  
Theres nothing in the world  
We wont be missing  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah We got a good combination  
Yeah We got a good combination  
Yeah We got a good combination  
Yeah We got a good combination  
Yeah We got a good combination
