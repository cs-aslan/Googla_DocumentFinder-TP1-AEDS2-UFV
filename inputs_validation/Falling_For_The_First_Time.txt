Im so cool too bad Im a loser  
Im so smart too bad I cant get anything figured out  
Im so brave too bad Im a baby  
Im so fly thats probably why it  
Feels just like Im falling for the first time  
  
Im so green its really amazing  
Im so clean too bad I cant get all the dirt off of me  
Im so sane its driving me crazy  
Its so strange I cant believe it  
Feels just like Im falling for the first time  
  
Anyone perfect must be lying anything easy has its cost  
Anyone plain can be lovely anyone loved can be lost  
What if I lost my direction What if I lost sense of time  
What if I nursed this infection Maybe the worst is behind  
It feels just like Im falling for the first time  
It feels just like Im falling for the first time  
  
Im so chill no wonder its freezing  
Im so still I just cant keep my fingers out of anything  
Im so thrilled to finally be failing  
Im so done turn me over cause it  
Feels just like Im falling for the first time  
  
Anything plain can be lovely anything loved can be lost  
Maybe I lost my direction what if our love is the cost  
Anyone perfect must be lying anything easy has its cost  
Anyone plain can be lovely anyone loved can be lost  
What if I lost my direction What if I lost sense of time  
What if I nursed this infection Maybe the worst is behind
