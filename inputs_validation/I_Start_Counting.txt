This year next year  
Sometime never  
Paper dreams tied up  
With bits of string  
Darkness comes  
Flowers grow  
Noone knows  
I start counting  
I start counting  
  
Sitting by myself in a secret  
Chasing thoughts through rainbows in my mind yeah  
Changing time  
Tomorrows dream  
In between  
I start counting  
Counting yes I do  
Counting counting counting counting counting  
Oohhoooo five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve etc
