You left me wearing nothing but a shell  
You left me wearing nothing but a shell  
This feeling youve left me  
Is the image of hell  
  
I thought that you loved me  
Ah but then I never could tell  
I thought that you loved me  
But then I never could tell  
This feeling you left me  
Is the image of hell  
  
If you loved me like you said that you did  
Oh then darling you couldnt have done the things  
That you did  
You walk by my door but you dont ring my bell  
You walk by my door but you dont ring my bell  
This feeling youve left me is the image of hell
