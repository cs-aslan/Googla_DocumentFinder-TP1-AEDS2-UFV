I dont like the way you touch my baby if youre smart you turn him loose  
Unless you crave danger or youre crazy cause this gun dont care who it
shoots  
You better take your hands off my baby or theyre gonna bury you in your boots  
  
Keep what Im saying for I aint fooling and this gun dont care who it shoots  
This old gun of mine has no conscience shows no favors as never caught the
tree  
So its all up to you now pay attention cause this gun dont care who it
shoots  
  
Im glad to see youve made a right decision just stuck away youd better pull
up roots  
And lets hope that youll never cross my vision  
Cause this gun dont care who it shoots  
This old gun of mine  
No this gun dont care who it shoots
