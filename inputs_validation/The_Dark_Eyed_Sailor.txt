As I roved out one evening fair  
It bein the summertime to take the air  
I spied a sailor and a lady gay  
And I stood to listen  
And I stood to listen to hear what they would say  
  
He said Fair lady why do you roam  
For the day is spent and the night is on  
She heaved a sigh while the tears did roll  
For my darkeyed sailor  
For my darkeyed sailor so young and stout and bold  
  
Tis seven long years since he left this land  
A ring he took from off his lilywhite hand  
One half of the ring is still here with me  
But the others rollin  
But the others rollin at the bottom of the sea  
  
He said You may drive him out of your mind  
Some other young man you will surely find  
Love turns aside and soon cold has grown  
  
Like the winters morning  
Like the winters morning the hills are white with  
Snow  
  
She said Ill never forsake my dear  
Although were parted this many a year  
Genteel he was and a rake like you  
To induce a maiden  
To induce a maiden to slight the jacket blue  
  
One half of the ring did young William show  
She ran distracted in grief and woe  
Sayin William William I have gold in store  
For my darkeyed sailor  
For my darkeyed sailor has proved his honour long  
  
And there is a cottage by yonder lea  
This couples married and does agree  
So maids be loyal when your loves at sea  
For a cloudy morning  
For a cloudy morning brings in a sunny day
