Coughing Blues Gol Bretdont touch me there  
Bret Im gonna tell you who we are  
  
Well were big rock singers  
we got golden fingers  
And were loved everywhere we go  
That sounds like us  
  
We sing about beauty  
and we sing about truth  
At ten million dollars a show  
Yeah right  
  
We take all kinda pills  
That give us all kinda thrills  
But the thrill weve never known  
Is the thrill that it gets ya  
when you get your picture  
On the cover of the Rolling Stone  
  
Chorus  
Rolling Stone  
Im gonna see my picture on the cover  
Stone  
Gonna buy five copies for my mother  
Stone  
Gonna see my smiling face  
On the cover of the Rolling Stone  
  
I got a freaky old lady named Cocaine Katie  
Who embroiders on my jeans  
I got my poor old grayhaired Daddy  
Driving my limousine  
  
Now its all designed to blow our minds  
But our minds wont really be blown  
Like the blow thatll getcha  
When you get your picture  
On the cover of the Rolling Stone  
  
Chorus  
Spoken Hey I know how  
Solo  
Spoken Beautiful  
  
We gotta lot of little teenaged  
blueeyed groupies  
Who do anything we say  
We got a genuine Indian Guru  
Hes teaching us a better way  
  
We got all the friends that money can buy  
So we never have to be alone  
And we keep gettin richer  
But we cant get our picture  
On the cover of the Rolling Stone  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont know why we aint on the cover baby  
Ah were beautiful fellas  
I aint kiddin you man wed make a beautiful cover  
I mean I can see it right nowwe be up front  
Oh we be smilin Beautiful
