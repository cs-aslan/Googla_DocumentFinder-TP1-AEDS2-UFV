Its in everyone of us  
To be wise  
Find your heart  
Open up both your eyes  
We can all know everything  
Without ever knowing why  
Its in everyone of us  
By and by  
  
Its in everyone of us  
To be wise  
Find your heart  
Open up both your eyes  
We can all know everything  
Without ever knowing why  
Its in everyone of us  
By and by  
  
Its in everyone of us  
I just remembered  
Its like Ive been sleepin forty years  
Im not awake as I can be  
But my seeins better  
I can see through the tears  
Ive been realisin bad  
I bought this ticket  
And watching only half of the show  
But there is scenery and lights  
And a cast of thousands  
You all know you all know what I know what I know  
And its good  
That its so  
  
Its in everyone of us  
To be wise  
Find your heart  
Open up both your eyes  
We can all know everything  
Without ever knowing why  
Its in everyone of us  
By and by and  
  
Its in everyone of us  
By and by
