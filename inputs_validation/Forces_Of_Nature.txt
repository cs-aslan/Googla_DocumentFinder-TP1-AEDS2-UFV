Yeahhh  
  
Opposites attract chemicals react  
But when I look at you  
Deserts need the rain fires feed the flame  
We cant deny whats true  
  
I cant help the way I feel  
Cause you got me yeah  
All these elements are real  
They come from deep within me  
  
I would move heaven and earth for this fire  
For this ocean Id fight for you  
Let this emotional wind take us higher  
Where theres nothing we cant do  
I love you I love you  
This power is greater than the forces of nature  
  
We dont have no walls  
The beauty of it all beauty of it all  
Is waiting in your eyes  
Breathing on my skin  
Just let me take it in  
Under an open sky  
  
I cant help the way I feel  
Cause you got me yeah oh you know I cant  
All these elements are real  
They come from deep within me  
  
I would move heaven and earth for this fire  
For this ocean Id fight for you  
Let this emotional wind take us higher  
Where theres nothing we cant do  
I love you oh I love you I love you  
This power is greater than the forces of nature  
  
Nothing is greater  
Than the energy I get from loving you  
Sooner or later  
Itll take us too forever  
  
I would move heaven and earth for this fire  
For this ocean Id fight for you ohhh  
Let this emotional wind take us higher  
Where theres nothing we cant do nothing we cant do  
  
I would move heaven and earth for this fire for this fire  
For this ocean Id fight for you Id fight for you  
Let this emotional wind take us higher let this emotional wind  
Where theres nothing we cant do nothing we cant do  
I love you I love you baby I love you I love you baby  
This power is greater than the forces of nature
