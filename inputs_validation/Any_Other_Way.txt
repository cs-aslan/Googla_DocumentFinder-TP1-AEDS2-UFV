Nick  
There you go caught you crashin my dreams again  
Just when Im trying to get over you  
I tell my heart but I cant seem to comprehend  
A day without you  
  
AJ  
Now youve carved out a life  
But I wear the scars  
Reminding me by the hour  
That its time to accept thats the way the things are  
I wish I could but  
  
Chorus  
I cant imagine it any other way  
A world without you is only wasted space  
Youre gone and Ill always wonder  
Why it cant be any other way  
Any other way  
  
Brian  
Since you drained all the color out of the sky  
How am I supposed to feel  
Its like Im livin in somebody elses life  
Tell me its not real  
  
Repeat Chorus 2x  
  
Howie  
Like we never had a falling out  
Like the tears had never hit the ground  
Like youre still here  
Youre still here  
  
Brian  
Since you drained all the color out of the sky  
  
Repeat Chorus 2x
