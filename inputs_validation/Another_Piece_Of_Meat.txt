Met her down at that Tokyo place  
Loved her pretty face  
I said Hey youre alright so alright  
I was sitting in her car  
She told me Youre a star and I know you  
  
She said Take me home  
I need love so strong  
Come on and knock me out oh  
Ive been too long alone  
I want hot love you know and I need it now  
  
She said Hey lets go dont put on a show  
Youre just another piece another piece of meat  
She said Hey lets go dont put on a show  
Youre just another piece  
Another piece of meat  
  
Next day she took me out  
To a rough kick boxing show  
Violence really turned her on oh no  
She was screaming for more blood  
Loved it more than any drug I couldnt stand it  
  
I said Hey lets go dont put on a show  
Youre just another piece another piece of meat  
Said Hey lets go dont put on a show  
Youre just another piece  
Another piece of meat
