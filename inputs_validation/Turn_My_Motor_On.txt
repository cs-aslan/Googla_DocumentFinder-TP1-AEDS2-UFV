When we make love you know it feels so fine  
Any way you want it baby I dont mind  
Anything you do you know I cant complain  
Come and kiss me honey here I go again  
I get a kind of power dont know where its from  
Ooee babe you turn my motor on  
I get a kind of power dont know where its from  
Ooee babe you turn my motor on  
When we have fun you it feels alright  
Wanna see you morning afternoon and night  
I dont care where you know I dont mind when  
Just arouse my interest here I go again  
I get a kind of power dont know where its from  
Ooee babe you turn my motor on  
I get a kind of power dont know where its from  
Ooee babe you turn my motor on  
Were all alone now now baby please dont hide  
Come on over here Im gonna swallow your pride  
Dont act cool now baby try romance  
It aint every day that you get a chance like this baby  
You dont have to catch me I aint on the run  
Who wants your brain your bodys too much fun  
Just keep on smiling you aint in no pain  
Move a little closer here I go again  
I get a kind of power dont know where its from  
Ooee babe you turn my motor on  
I get a kind of power dont know where its from  
Ooee babe you turn my motor on  
Oohoo you turn my motor on  
Oohoohoo you turn my motor on
