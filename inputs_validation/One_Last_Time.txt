I wind you up  
Then I wait for the melancholy  
I give you up  
While you sit here in all your glory  
I never thought you would  
I never knew you could  
But now youre gone  
And I dont think I care  
I sold your love  
  
Down the river for a bow and arrow  
Euphoria has just been here  
And shes looking terrible  
I never sung this low  
Its better if you go  
I know youre mine  
I sit here and want you to try  
To love me like a monster  
One last time  
Control me like a father  
  
One last time stay with  
Me till Im stronger one last  
Bound to kick me when Im down  
Dont kick me when Im down  
I never thought you would  
I never understood  
And thats why Im weak and I want  
You to try to make me an  
Example one last time  
  
To drag me through the cycle  
One last time to make  
Me a disciple one last  
Round will get me to the ground  
Youll get me on the ground oh yeah  
Ill see you around  
Yeah Ill see you around  
One last time  
And Ill see you around  
Yeah Ill see you around  
Na na na na na na na
