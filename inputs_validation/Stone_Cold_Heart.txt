All along you did nothing wrong  
Still Im missing something strong  
And I feel I dont belong Oh no  
What should I do  
But tell the truth  
  
Cause its been eating me away  
And Im burning just to say  
That we cant go on this way oh no  
What should I do What can I do  
  
And now I wish that I  
Could give you more than a stone cold heart  
I wish that somebody would have told me  
Then this would have been unnecessary  
Youre asking me why but I just cant lie  
You gave me more than a stone cold heart  
In a million years I never ever thought wed have to end this way  
  
Now weve come this far and we  
Find it hard to just be friends and its better if we end this way  
I dont wanna lead you on no more
