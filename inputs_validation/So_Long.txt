Mystified by the struggle  
To survive my own pride  
Haunted by the demons  
Of my past life  
Who am I and why do I  
Are questions that keep running  
Through my mind  
But underneath this shallow skin  
A brand new me is comin out  
Comin out from within  
  
Chorus  
So long  
Farewell to my old self  
Goodbye to the lie that I cant be someone else  
Cause who I was aint who I am  
I know that Ive been born again  
Those stains of my history are gone gone gone  
So long  
  
Apathy hunting me  
Like some contagious disease  
Hypocrisy hiding in the shadows  
Of the former me  
Doin what comes naturally  
Im not who I want to be  
Im ready to ready to be free  
  
Chorus  
  
Nanana nananana  
Hey hey hey  
So long  
  
Nanana nananana  
Hey hey hey  
So long  
  
Chorus
