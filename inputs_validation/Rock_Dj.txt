Me with the floorshow  
Kickin with your torso  
Boys getting high  
And the girls even more so  
Wave your hands if your not with the man  
Can I kick it  
Yes you can  
I got  
Funk  
You got  
Soul  
We got everybody  
Ive got the gift  
Gonna stick it in the goal  
Its time to move your body  
  
Babylon back in business  
Can I get a witness  
Every girl every man  
Houston can you hear me  
Ground control can you feel me  
Need permission to land  
I dont wanna rock DJ  
But your making me feel so nice  
Whens it gonna stop DJ  
Cos youre keepin me up all night  
  
Singin in the classes  
Music for your masses  
Give no head  
No backstage passes  
Have a proper giggle  
Ill be quite polite  
But when I rock the mic  
I rock the mic  
Right  
You got no love then youre with the wrong man  
Its time to move your body  
If you cant get a girl  
But your best friend can  
Its time to move your body  
  
I dont wanna be sleazy  
Baby just tease me  
Got no family planned  
Houston can you hear me  
Need permission to land  
I dont wanna rock DJ  
But youre making me feel so nice  
Whens it gonna stop DJ  
Cos youre keeping me up all night  
  
I dont wanna rock DJ  
But youre making me feel so nice  
Whens it gonna stop DJ  
Cos your keeping me up all night  
  
Pimpin aint easy  
Most of them fleece me  
Every night  
Pimpin aint easy  
But if youre sellin it  
Its alright  
  
Come on  
  
I dont wanna rock DJ  
But youre making me feel so nice  
Whens it gonna stop DJ  
Cos youre keeping me up all night  
  
I dont wanna rock DJ  
But youre making me feel so nice  
Whens it gonna stop DJ  
Cos youre keeping me up all night
