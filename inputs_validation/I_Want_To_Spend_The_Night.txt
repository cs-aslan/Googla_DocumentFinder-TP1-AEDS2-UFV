I want to spend the night  
With you  
Forever  
  
Every time we wind up spending the night  
Together  
Do you ever feel it  
  
I want to share my life  
With you  
Forever  
  
Ever time we wind sharing a night  
Together  
Do you ever feel it  
  
And when I stay away from you  
I never get to sleep  
I try to hug my pillow  
And pretend that youre with me  
But I cant feel it  
  
Then when we are together  
Its right there for me to see  
I cant keep looking at loneliness  
And trying to call it freedom  
Do you ever feel it  
  
I want to spend the night  
With you  
Forever  
  
Every time we wind up spending the night  
Together  
Do you ever feel it  
  
Repeat x6  
Do you ever want to spend the night
