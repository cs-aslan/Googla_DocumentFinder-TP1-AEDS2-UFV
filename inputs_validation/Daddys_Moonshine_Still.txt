Folks say my daddy wasnt much of a man  
For disobeying the laws of the land  
Folks say that my daddy wasnt fit to kill  
Oh and I know it was true what the people said  
Cause wed allve been better of dead  
Than to live a life of shame and strife  
Cause of daddys moonshine still  
My mama was always sweet and kind  
But she grew old before her time  
Worryin about the way we had to live  
Yeah my daddy put the wrinkles in my mamas face  
He drunk his share of all he made  
And just one more reason I grew to hate  
My daddys moonshine still  
Chorus  
Daddys moonshine still was good for nothin  
But to break mamas heart  
And to tear our home apart  
Make our lives a livin hell  
Them old mason jars that daddy made us wash  
And set them out to sun on our back porch  
Til he got ready to take em up on the hill  
And when daddy got word of the revenue  
He made us kids help hide his brew  
Made us swear that we never knew  
About daddys moonshine still  
Yeah and two of my brothers drove across the state line  
Once a week with a load of moonshine  
And the wounds that came from that wont ever heal  
Cause on a moonshine run one rainy night  
My two brothers lost their lives  
And oh my god how I despise  
My daddys moonshine still  
Repeat Chorus  
Well it broke mamas heart but she understood  
The day that I left home for good  
But I had to find me another way to live  
Well I sent mama money nearly every day  
And how I made it well Id rather not say  
But at least it took me far away  
From daddys moonshine still  
My bootlegging daddy was known quite well  
And he made our home a livin hell  
And I aint forgot it and I know that I never will  
My mama finally died she just gave up  
And daddy finally died from drinkin that stuff  
And bad memories haunt the rest of us  
From daddys moonshine still  
Repeat Chorus
