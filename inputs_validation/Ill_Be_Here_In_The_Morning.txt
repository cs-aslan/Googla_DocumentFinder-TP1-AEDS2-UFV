Theres no stronger wind than the one that blows  
Down a lonesome railroad line  
No prettier sight than looking back  
On a town you left behind  
There is nothin thats as real  
As a love thats in my mind  
  
Close your eyes  
Ill be here in the morning  
Close your eyes  
Ill be here for a while  
  
Theres lots of things along the road  
Id surely like to see  
Id like to lean into the wind  
And tell myself Im free  
But your softest whispers louder  
Than the highways call to me  
  
All the mountains and the rivers  
And the valleys cant compare  
To your blue lit dancin eyes  
And yellow shining hair  
I could never hit the open road  
And leave you layin there  
  
Lay your head back easy love  
Close your cryin eyes  
Ill be layin here beside you  
When the sun comes on the rise  
Ill stay as long as the cuckoo wails  
And the lonesome bluejay cries
