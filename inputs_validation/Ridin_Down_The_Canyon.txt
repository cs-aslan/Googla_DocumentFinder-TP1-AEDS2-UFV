When evening chores are over at the ranch house on the plains  
And theres nothing left to do but lay around  
I saddle up my pony and go riding down the trail  
Just to watch the desert sun go down  
  
White faced cattle lowing sagebrush everywhere  
Granite spires are standing all around  
Ill tell you folks its heaven to go ridin down the trail  
Just to watch the desert sun go down  
  
Ridin down the canyon to watch the sun go down  
A picture that no artist ere could paint  
Cactus plants are bloomin on the mountain side  
I hear a coyote calling to its mate  
  
White faced cattle lowing sagebrush everywhere  
Granite spires are standing all around  
Ill tell you folks its heaven to go ridin down the trail  
Just to watch the desert sun go down
