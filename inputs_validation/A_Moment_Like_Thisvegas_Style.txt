What if I told you it was all meant to be  
Would you believe me  
Would you agree  
Its almost that feeling weve met before  
So tell me that you dont think Im crazy  
When I tell you love has come here and now  
  
A moment like this  
Some people wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this  
Some people search forever  
For that one special kiss  
Oh I cant believe its happening to me  
Some people wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this  
  
And everything changes  
But beauty remains  
Something so tender I cant explain  
Well I maybe be draming  
But till I awake  
Can we make this dream last forever  
And Ill cherish all the love we share  
  
For a moment like this  
Some people wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this  
Some people search forever  
For that one special kiss  
Oh I cant believe its happening to me  
Some people wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this  
  
Could this be the greatest of them all  
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall  
So let me tell you this  
Some poeple wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this  
  
Some people wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this  
Some people search forever  
For that one special kiss  
Oh I cant believe its happening to me  
Some people wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this  
  
Ohh ohhh a moment like this  
Ohh this painful search foreveroh yeah yeah  
Some people wait a lifetime  
For a moment like this A moment like this
