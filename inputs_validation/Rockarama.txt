Wind it up here comes the video  
Its that song again  
Turn it up its on the radio  
  
Charge me up I got electric eyes  
I wont fall down  
Light me up  
Just like a christmas tree  
Or am I seeing things  
  
Wind it up turn it up  
Charge me up never stop  
Wind me up plug me in turn me on  
And give me rocknroll  
Give me rocknroll  
  
Strap me in to the rocket ship  
Im headin for the sun  
Tune me in to the mother ship  
I must be seeing things  
  
Wind it up turn it up  
Charge me up please dont stop  
Wind me up plug me in turn me on  
And give me rocknroll  
  
Rockarama its on the video  
Rockarama on my radio  
Rockarama on the stereo  
Give me rocknroll   
  
Plug me in jack to jack  
Pin me to the wall  
Hey leave that on Im on MTV  
Now Im seein things  
  
Wind it up here comes that video  
Its that song again  
Turn me up Im on the radio  
Or am I hearing things  
  
Wind it up turn it up  
Charge me up dont you stop  
Wind me up plug me in turn me on  
Give me rocknroll  
  
Rockarama its on the video  
Rockarama on my radio  
Rockarama on the stereo  
Give me rocknroll  
Give me rocknroll  
Rockarama its on the video  
Rockarama on my radio  
Rockarama on my stereo  
Give me rocknroll
