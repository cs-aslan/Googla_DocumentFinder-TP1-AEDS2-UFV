Lowlifes on gossip  
Bypass the mind  
Head for the heart  
  
Do you feel love  
  
Its not like I dont care  
We are not going anywhere  
Thinking loud and clear  
Where will I be in a year  
Two hearts slamming  
As one  
Its blood music  
  
Pop up leeches  
You know a climax aint the end of it  
  
Do you feel love  
  
Its not like I dont care  
We are not going anywhere  
Thinking loud and clear  
Where will I be in a year  
Come on  
Two hearts slamming  
As one  
Its blood music
