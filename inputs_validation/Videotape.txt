When Im at the pearly gates  
This will be on my videotape my videotape  
Mephistopheles is just beneath  
And hes reaching up to grab me  
  
This is one for the good days  
And I have it all here  
In red blue green  
Red blue green  
  
You are my center  
When I spin away  
Out of control on videotape  
On videotape  
On videotape  
On videotape  
  
This is my way of saying goodbye  
Because I cant do it face to face  
Im talking to you after its too late  
From my videotape  
  
No matter what happens now  
You shouldnt be afraid  
Because I know today has been the most perfect day Ive ever seen
