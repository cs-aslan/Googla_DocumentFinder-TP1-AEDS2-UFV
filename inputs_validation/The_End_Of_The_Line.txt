When the sirens flash is gone  
And were left to carry on  
All the memories are too few  
  
When the pastors music plays  
And that casket rolls away  
I could live again if you  
Just stay alive for me  
  
Please stay now you left me here alone  its the end of the line  
Please stay I cant make it on my own  its the end of the line  
Make it on my own  
Its the end of the line  
  
Now that you are dead and gone  
And Im left to carry on  
I could never smile cause you  
Wont stay alive for me  
  
Finally  
Your final resting day  
Is without me  
I weep  
And think of brighter days  
What about me  
  
You cant take back the one mistake  
That still lives on after life it takes  
In that one day that changed our lives  
And bitter memories are left behind
