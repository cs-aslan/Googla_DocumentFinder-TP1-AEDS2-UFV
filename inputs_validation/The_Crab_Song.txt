and after all the feelings go I see I still love you so  
I just thought Id let you know now that everythings okay  
And you are on your way back back to where you came  
She said with pain in her heart it was there from the start  
Now I know why everything turns grey but its our own world we paint  
And I want the brightest I want flourescence every day and night  
For the rest of my life open your eyes wont you  
Cant you see youre so beautiful to me  
Dont look back as a matter of fact theres  
A ten foot jack wants to break your back  
You stole his girl you wrecked his world  
Now its your your head that hes gonna twirl  
He wont think once he wont think twice  
Cause he knows just what hes gonna do tonight  
He will commit a crime a crime of love  
And he wont be happy till he sees your blood  
Looking back on when you left me  
Standing in the rain  
Dont look back as a matter of fact theres  
A son of a bitch and hes digging a ditch  
For you my friend my lucky one  
So grab your things its time to run to the other side  
Where love takes pride and your souls  
The only thing that stays alive  
Ma maooba goo goo ga ga  
Hey quit talkin that terminal jive  
Looking back on when I left you  
Crying in pain  
Dont look back1st verse  
Looking back on when you left me  
Standing in the rain incredible pain  
I understand you have to be your own person and thats ok with me  
Hurts hurts hurts like a like a motherfucher  
Love it hurts it kills like a sonofabitch  
That feeling it gets me down inside deep down there  
No further keep going oh man thats right out my system
