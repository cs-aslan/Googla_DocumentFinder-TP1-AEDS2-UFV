Woman I cant live  
Live without you in my life  
Woman I need you  
Keep my mind  Ised  
  
Chorus No matter what I say or do  
So in love with you  
No matter what I say or do  
So in love with you  
  
People Dont understand  
That my heart is in your hand  
And we know this  
  
When Im in your arms  
I am free  
  
Chorus  
  
People everywhere  
You dont understand  
What youre missing  
People everywhere  
Stop for a minute and listen  
If you find love  
If you find love hang on  
  
Chorus  
Na na na
