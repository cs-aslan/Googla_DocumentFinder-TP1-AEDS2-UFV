Dismal Day  
  
I look into my morning mirror  
And it reveals some things to me that I had not been able to see  
I saw someone that Im not sure I want to be  
An empty lonely face was starin back at me  
  
All and all I would have to say  
Its been a rather dismal day  
  
The afternoon was slow in coming  
I drug myself  outside the people that I knew would be there  
And though they walked along pretending not to care  
I knew behind my back theyd point and laugh and stare  
  
CHORUS  
  
And now the evening shadows falling  
I guess its best I lay my hopes to rest for no ones calling my name  
I sit and wait behind a door thats never knocked on  
I live in silence like my phone thats never talked on  
  
CHORUS
