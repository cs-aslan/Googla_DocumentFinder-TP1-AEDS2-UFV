When Im lost I find a way  
I hear voices Feel them surround me  
Pull me from the edge  
I close my eyes and  
And my luck keeps holding strong  
Even when that boot comes down  
Waiting for the revolution but theres no one around except the  
 Hands out of nowhere saving me again  
Theres always something there watching out for me  
If Im suffocating it gives me air  
Finally now I remember  
But where Im going now Im not sure  
Only one thing matters much to me anymore  
Im looking for you  
Can you imagine You cant think  
You wont find a way this time to frighten me  
Youre running scared now always looking  
Over your shoulder for a place  
Where you dont see my face  
When my luck keeps holding so strong  
Even with the state Im in  
Im like a revolution of one even when I stumble I win  
Because theres hands out of nowhere saving me again  
Theres always something there watching out for me  
When Im suffocating it gives me air  
Im like a cat with only a few lives left  
Running from the shadows  
Watching my back waiting for the attack that I know is  
Coming I feel its near
