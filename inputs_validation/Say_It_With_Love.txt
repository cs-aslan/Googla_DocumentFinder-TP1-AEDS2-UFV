Ive been thinkin the way people do  
Bout the things that matter  
To me and you  
Ive decided to do what I can  
And to find the kind of man  
I really am  
I can see the world from here  
And it sometimes makes me  
Want to disappear  
Back to nature thats where we belong  
And with just one truth Ive found  
You cant go wrong  
Wherever you go whatever you do  
Whatever you say say say say  
Say it with love  
I remember a long time ago  
When I heard those guitars  
That I worship so  
I was captured I wanted to stay  
And to hear that kind of music  
Everyday  
Heard the songs around the world  
Saw the smiling faces  
On the boys and girls  
I was destined to play come what may  
And theres just one thing  
I knew I had to say  
Wherever you go whatever you do  
Whatever you say say say say  
Say it with love  
Underneath a sea of doubt  
Theres a million voices shouting  
Let me out  
Let me out  
When we go we never return  
cause theres just one lesson  
That we got to learn  
Wherever you go whatever you do  
Whatever you say say say say  
Say it with love  
Say it with love say it with love  
Say it with love say it with love
