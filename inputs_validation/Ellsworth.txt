Grandma burned the biscuits  
Nearly took the house down with it  
Now shes in assisted livin  
We all knew that day would come  
  
We knew she was too gone to drive  
The day she parked on I65  
Found her on the shoulder cryin  
She didnt know where she was  
  
Its like her mind just quit  
Oh but bring up Grandpa  
Its like someone flipped a switch  
  
A front porch light and a blue DeSoto  
Couple of straws in a CocaCola  
You could see it all goin down  
A handsome boy in army green  
  
A tear on his face down on a knee  
Shaky voice a diamond ring  
Shell put you in that town  
Tomorrow she wont remember what she did today  
But just ask her about Ellsworth Kansas 1948  
  
She takes out his medals  
A cigar box of letters  
Sits and scatters pictures  
Black and whites of days gone by  
  
We started losing her when she lost him  
But to hear her carry on  
Youd swear shes seventeen again  
  
Football games and leaves are cracklin  
Walking her home in his leather jacket  
You can see it all goin down  
A perfect night on a front porch glider  
  
Sayin goodnight for the next three hours  
Her tired eyes grow wide and bright  
When she talks about that town  
Tomorrow she wont remember what she did today  
But just ask her about Ellsworth Kansas 1948  
  
While the world is fading all around her  
Sharin a sundae at the counter  
Hes goin on and on about her  
  
Bet shes right there right now  
Tomorrow she wont remember what she did today  
But just ask her about Ellsworth Kansas 1948
