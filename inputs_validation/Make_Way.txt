Let me tell you how its goin down  
Let me introduce the new show in town  
Playin no games no messin round  
Taking no prisoners hows that sound  
Three young ladies comin out for you  
Yo its been too long since you heard the truth  
So this is the real no substitute  
Weve come to lay it down get it crunk for you  
You tired of hearing songs about things theyve got  
When you are dead broke and aint got a lot  
Got questions and answers they have not  
Thats why we came here to blow up the spot  
Youre ready for something new  
Something more than my new car or my brand new shoes  
My Burberry this or my 22s  
Well listen close as we break it down for you  
chorus 2x  
Make way for the crew shout it  
We comin through shout it  
You know how we do shout it  
Were makin moves shout it  
I know you feel this beat  
So bump it in the clubs  
And bang it in your Jeeps  
Cause you just cant get enough  
We represent for GOD  
Full of life bringing positivity  
Livin right cause thats the way  
Fully clothed and thats okay  
Trying to give a new point of view  
Cause you to think  
The message that your life can be new  
Thats what we bring  
Youre wasting years and air you breath  
No clue about your destiny  
Great is what youre meant to be  
Heres the light for you to see  
Cause were walking different  
We smoke the competition  
We dope were on a mission  
No joke this thing is real  
chorus 2x  
Make way for the crew shout it  
We comin through shout it  
You know how we do shout it  
Were makin moves shout it  
I know you feel this beat  
So bump it in the clubs  
And bang it in your Jeeps  
Cause you just cant get enough

We aint coming just to play  
Weve come to save the day

Yo we from the south shout it  
Gonna make you bounce shout it
