Well its been rainin on and on  
Ever since youve been gone  
Those dark clouds keep rollin in  
And every time I think I might catch myself a glimpse of sunlight  
The bottom falls out again  
Well I can barely keep afloat  
Im up the creek without a boat  
And Ive been adriftin heaven knows how long  
Cause its been rainin forty days and forty nights since youve been gone  
  
Hey well drip drip drip goes the sound of the rain  
The four winds are blowin like a hurricane  
My friends said I should settle for any port in a storm  
Id rather be inside your lovin arms  
Safe and warm  
Girl its been a long time since Ive seen sunshine  
Baby wont you come back home  
Cause its been rainin forty days and forty nights since youve been gone  
  
Aw listen to me now  
I keep starin out the window  
Searchin for a rainbow  
To signal that the storm will end  
Hey cause I know that the rainll keep pourin on the pane  
Until my saint comes back marchin in  
Oh girl its been a long time since Ive seen sunshine  
Baby wont you come back home  
Cause its been rainin forty days and forty nights since youve been gone  
Hey well drip drip drip goes the sound of the rain  
The four winds are blowin like a hurricane  
My friends said I should settle for any port in a storm  
Id rather be inside your lovin arms  
Safe and warm  
Girl its been a long time since Ive seen sunshine  
Baby wont you come back home  
Cause its been rainin forty days and forty nights since youve been gone  
Yeah its been rainin forty days and forty nights since youve been gone
