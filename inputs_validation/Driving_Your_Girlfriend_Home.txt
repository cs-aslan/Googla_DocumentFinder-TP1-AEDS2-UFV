Im driving  
Your girlfriend home  
And shes saying  
How she never chose you  
Turn left she says  
I turn left  
And she says  
So how did I end up  
So deeply involved in  
The very existence  
I planned on avoiding  
And I cant answer  
  
Im driving  
Your girlfriend home  
And shes laughing  
To stop herself crying  
Drive on she says  
I drive on  
And she says  
So how did I end up  
Attached to this person  
When his sense of humor  
Gets gradually worser   
And I cant tell her  
  
Im parking  
Outside her home  
And were shaking hands  
Goodnight so politely
