I dont know about tomorrow  
I just live for day to day  
I dont borrow from the sunshine  
For its skies may turn to gray  
I dont worry oer the future  
For I know what Jesus said  
And today Ill walk beside Him  
For He knows what lies ahead  
Many things about tomorrow  
I dont seem to understand  
But I know who holds tomorrow  
And I know who holds my hand  
Evry step is getting brighter  
As the golden stairs I climb  
Evry burdens getting lighter  
Evry cloud is silver lined  
There the sun is always shining  
There no tear will dim the eye  
At the ending of the rainbow  
Where the mountains touch the sky  
Many things about tomorrow  
I dont seem to understand  
But I know who holds tomorrow  
And I know who holds my hand
