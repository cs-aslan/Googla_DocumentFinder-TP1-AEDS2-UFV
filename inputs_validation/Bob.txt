He spent 15 years  
Getting loaded for 15 years  
Till his liver exploded  
Now whats Bob gonna do  
Now that he cant drink  
The Doctor said What ya been thinking bout  
Bob said thats the point I wont think bout nothing  
Now I gotta do something else  
  
To pass the time  
Had someone shave his head  
He got a new identity  
62 hole air cushioned boots  
And a girl who rides a scooter  
To take him out of town  
They would get away  
Running around  
And as the trucks drive by  
You can hear the mother fuckers go PUNK  
  
A couple of lines an extra thermos of Joe  
Hell be kicking in heads at the punk rock show  
Bobs the kinda guy who knows just what  
Bobs the kinda guy who knows just what to do  
When the doctor tells him to  
Quit your drinking nows the time  
But will he ever walk the line  
To all my friends I feel just great  
But will he ever walk the line  
  
Kicking ass and busting heads  
Red suspenders  
Once a day he shaves his head  
But will he ever walk the line Repeat x2  
  
Bob
