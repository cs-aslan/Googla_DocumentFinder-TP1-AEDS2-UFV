What are you lookin at  
Yeah  
  
I saw this coming  
From a mile away  
I saw a crack  
In the egg  
A little rip  
In the page  
  
I found  
Your necklace  
On the floor  
Underneath the bed  
Where you said  
I was the only one  
  
You thought Id cry  
Youthoughtidcry  
You thought Id lay  
Down and die  
You thought  
Theres no  
Hetting over you  
Haha  
  
And all this time  
Allthistime  
Youve been having  
Your fun  
Ive been having  
Some fun too  
  
Cause it  
Takes one to know one  
Congrats  
Youve met your match  
You think Id lie here  
Heartbroken  
But the knife  
Is in your back  
Inyourback  
  
You left your suit  
You left your tie  
And looked me in the eye  
And swore that it  
Was business baby  
Yeah right  
  
And when you left  
I got a call  
That started it all  
And now  
Its not your business  
Baby  
  
You thought Id cry  
Youthoughtidcry  
You thought Id lay  
Down and die  
You thought  
Theres no  
Getting over you  
Haha
