Faithful to the End  
  
Im saved from the grace that Ive found in You  
All that youve done  
Through the Power of the Cross for me  
Im saved of the mercy Ive found in You  
All that Youre  
The fullness of Your Love For me  
  
Chorus  
All that I have  
Has come from Your hand  
All I ever know is  
Jesus You are faithful to the end  
  
Ill tell of the wonders Ive found in You  
And the love that You shown  
Is higher than the heaven above me  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
More than this world  
Could take me from Your love  
All I ever know is  
Jesus You are faithful  
All I ever know is  
Jesus You are faithful to the end
