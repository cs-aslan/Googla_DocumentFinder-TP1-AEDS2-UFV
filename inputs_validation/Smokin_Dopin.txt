Yeah  
Smoking doping keep your ears open  
Put me on the flier and Im guaranteed to rope in  
Twentythousand people to the place that I play at  
And have em even saying how could someone say that  
Theyre as good as the man who just saw  
Please give me some more  
Of those hooping scooping rhymes you be trooping  
If you dont know the new dance Patti Duken  
Clap your hands stomp your feet snap your fingers  
Im snatching airplay from all you AIDS catching singers  
Its a special delivery on your front step  
My pictures on the cover and the rhymes are in effect  
Cause I love to lay down joints for the playground  
And have you ODn saying yknow J sound  
Righteous the brother did what he had to  
I didnt talk about this so I had you  
Sleeping breathing saying yo he aint keeping  
His promise to astonish from weekend to weekend  
But here it is the jam of all jams  
And from this day forth MCs are getting slammed  
With the  
  
Chorus  
Uhh aww yeah uhh ahh  
Uhh aww yeah uhh ahh  
Uhh aww yeah uhh ahh  
Uhh aww yeah  
  
Im the wise wizard of the microphone swinging it  
Heres a mean joint all the hiphoppers are singing it  
Doing a dance in tight bike pants  
So get up on it hoe youll only get one chance  
To work out the soreness in your muscles  
Do your own thing even the hustle  
MCs Ima torture thats already known  
But while Im torturing them Ima leave you alone  
So you can bump grind and rub up against your partner  
And look wild like youre tryin to get a part in a  
Dirty movie on the hiphop tip  
Now tell me tell you what that brother L aint tryin to flip  
With the  
  
Chorus  
  
Moving grooving admit that youve been  
Shocked and rocked and Im on top and its been proven  
Im selfreliant on stage Im defiant  
All those rumors are small things to a giant  
Im not a cool calm collected type of brother  
Im kind of hype thats why Im a good lover  
In bed Im energetic kind of like a freight train  
Going so crazy I have the girlies saying Wait James  
I do damage use the beef to build a sandwich  
And when Im done shell be saying How did you manage  
To make me feel pleasure from my toes to my head  
On top of that you ran laps around the bed  
So bust out the pumped up funk that Im revealing  
And listen to it while youre in your car wheeling  
On on your Walkman as youre staring at the ceiling  
Or when you and your love is sexappealing  
To the  
  
Uhh aww yeah uhh ahh  
Uhh aww yeah uhh ahh  
Know what Im sayin  
Uhh aww yeah uhh ahh  
Its like a smooth joint you know what I mean  
Uhh aww yeah

Chorus  
  
Marvelous
