I dont care alone you go  
I dont care alone you stay  
But good kind of treatment  
Im bringing you home someday  
Well someday baby  
You aint gonna worry my life anymore  
Now you keep on bendin  
If the dice dont pay  
Cant you see little girl  
Youre living too fast  
But someday baby  
You aint gonna worry my life anymore  
Are you tellin everybody  
In the neighborhood  
Cause you dont love me baby  
You didnt mean me no good  
Yes but someday baby  
You aint gonna worry my life anymore  
Alright
