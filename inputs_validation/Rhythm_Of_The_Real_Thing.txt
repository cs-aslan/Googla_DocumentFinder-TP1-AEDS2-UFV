It was sublime it was thunder  
As my life got torn asunder  
I felt the rhythm of the real thing  
  
Falling down is nothing new  
We all fall down now even you  
I felt the rhythm of the real thing  
  
Delicate and nearly new  
Cherish it and love it too  
Oh the rhythm of the real thing  
  
All fall down or fall in love  
Put it up to high above  
You need the rhythm of the real thing  
  
Colours fly and dull some men  
Exit those who might resent  
The rhythm of the real thing  
  
Theres blood on your shirt  
Is that what you said  
Exit laughing  
Wake up dead  
  
Were alone now been before  
Who can that be at my door  
Is it the rhythm of the real thing  
  
spoken  
  
Dont cry go get him  
Youre mine dont let it  
Its time your credit
