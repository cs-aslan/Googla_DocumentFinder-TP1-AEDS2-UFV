P Diddy  
Yeah can you hear me Yeah  
Theres certain things in life that you can stop  
and theres certain things in life that cant be stopped  
Lets go  
  
And now for your bad bad boys starting at guard  
  
P Diddy  
why yall niggas still talking  
Oh you got a little name little fame little fortune  
What you have is a portion  
Bout the size of the hats in the back of my Porsche and  
So you better use caution knowing Im the boss and  
Im sitting on pyramids flossing  
I dont really gotta talk son  
I can get lost and sit back living off endorsements  
Im a pro kid  
Why you acting like you dont really know kid  
Any records I broke it  
Through the fame and the stardom making my mark on Harlem like Poe did  
I said heres your eviction notice  
But you probably already know this  
I dont mean to be greedy but turn on your TV  
or pick up your CD PD  
  
G Dep  
This is gruesome  
Niggas always grab that mic and salt like they really gon do some  
Whats wrong with you son  
Oh you got a new gun do you know how to use one  
Then you living an illusion living in a used one  
while Im in the Limited cruising  
You aint really got a crew son  
You giving them amusement fuck what your Comic Views meant  
Yous a smoke head  
Ive been doing this since this ProKed  
Broke breads with the cokeheads  
Been down still I get around like a nigga with broke legs on a moped  
I said Im a Top Gun like Gossett  
Run and get your CD and cassette  
Gossip lotta niggas got lip  
But they aint got hot yet til they got Dep  
  
Loon  
Why niggaz lie like that Know they aint fly like that  
Niggaz get fried like that  
And you dont want to die like that  
Have your momma crying like that  
Besides all that Im in to get it frying like that  
Still on the block and move pies like that  
Never my life dealt with guys that rap  
In fact I leave a nigga with his eyes all sad  
Swoll up why yall niggas better hold up  
Any nigga that roll up could get fold up  
Body get ripped up and then sewed up  
Every nigga I fucked with niggas is growed up  
We dont play games get on the stand and say names  
All we do is cock back and spray planes  
Give a fuck if nigga hustle or gangbang  
Nigga try to use they muscle and fang fang  
  
Black Rob  
Keep fronting Ima put a crease in your jaw  
Might catch me squeezing the four  
My nigga I go to war  
And if a nigga want the raw you still gotta come in the store  
whyall never had a runin before with the likes of an outlaw  
Predicate assassin smashin  
Open shit rig scope focus it  
Give niggaz what they posed to get shit  
Oppose the clique I send five close to six  
Hoodfellaz thatll come close your shit  
Niggaz stay with the frozen wrists  
Now the smoke colored big Benz with the top broke off  
Fix your face we back on the paper chase  
Never left so I aint gotta take your place  
Fuck the fake bogus niggaz that aint notice  
the breadwinner threesixfive I stay focused nigga  
  
P Diddy  
Well never stop  
Well never stop  
One of the greatest teams that ever lived  
Its like in our blood  
We gotta be born this way  
Bad Boy baby
