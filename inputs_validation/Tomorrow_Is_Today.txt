Ive been livin for the moment  
But I just cant have my way  
And Im afraid to go to sleep  
Cause tomorrow is today  
  
People tell me life is sweeter  
But I dont hear what they say  
Nothing comes to change my life  
So tomorrow is today  
  
I dont care to know the hour  
Cause its passing anyway  
I dont have to see tomorrow  
Cause I saw it yesterday  
  
So I listen for an answer  
But the feeling seems to stay  
And whats the use of always dreaming  
If tomorrow is today  
  
Still Im waiting for the morning  
But it feels so far away  
And you dont need the love Im giving  
So tomorrow is today  
  
Oh my Goin to the river  
Gonna take a ride and the Lord will deliver me  
Made my bed now Im gonna lie in it  
If you dont come Im sure gonna die in it  
Too late Too much given  
Ive seen a lot of life and Im damn sick of livin it  
I keep hopin that you will pass my way  
  
And some day if your dreams are leavin you  
Ill still believe in you  
  
I dont care to know the hour  
Cause its passing anyway  
I dont have to see tomorrow  
Cause I saw it yesterday  
  
Though Im living and Im singing  
And although my hands still play  
Soon enough it will all be over  
Cause tomorrow is today
