Do you love me women  truly do ya  
Can you feel this feeling going through ya  
Are you of the mind that we should live together through this night  
Or tell me youre my virgin queen and it may not be right  
  
But dont make me say  i cant let you go  
And its breaking me down  
Just thinking of your face and it wont be around  
Just look at me now  
I feel a stranger inside  stealing my pride  
I cant let you go  
And its breaking me down cause you wont be around  
  
When all this world of ours is falling apart  
Ill keep on hanging on and fixing my heart  
Cause evryone is just like me theyre praying in the sun  
And i may be that lucky man surviving when theyre gone  
  
But dont make me say  i cant let you go  
And its breaking me down  
Just thinking of your face and it wont be around  
Just look at me now  
I feel a stranger inside  stealing my pride  
I cant let you go  
And its breaking me down cause you wont be around  
Just look at me now  
I feel a stranger inside  stealing my pride  
I cant let you  cant let you go  
And its breaking my down cause you wont be around  
  
Just look at me now  i cant let you go  
Just look at me now  i cant let you go  
Just look at me now  i cant let you go  
Just look at me now  i cant let you go fade out
