Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
You with that cocktail in your hand  
You in your red Mercedes Benz  
Goin in one ear and out the other  
Cover up the pain with laughter baby  
Im not laughing ha ha ha  
Im not laughing  
  
Hey Al Capone  
Is that who you think you are  
All the girls  
All around the world  
Well they wanna shake your hand  
It wont be long  
Youll need an alibi  
A little bird  
Told me what hed heard  
Is it really true  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
  
Im gonna take you for a ride  
And hit you right between the eyes  
You can hear the pretty music playin well  
Listen to the words that Im saying  
You can hear them calling hear them calling  
  
Hey Al Capone  
Youll need a bodyguard  
Just like that  
Youll be laid out flat  
With a broken heart  
I shot you down  
Whos gonna help you now  
Valentines day  
Better hope and pray  
Theyll be tearing you apart  
Gangster of love Gangster of love  
Gangster of love Gangster of love  
  
I hear conversations  
In restaurants and bars  
I read all the papers  
And what they say is wrong  
Its such a fine fine line  
Such a fine fine line
