We stay up late  
We get no sleep  
My bodys aching  
I got no money left  
My friends say Im loosing it  
You so bad for me  
But thats a good thing  
Love is a good thing  
  
Every room were in  
Gets trashed from floor to ceiling  
Your kiss is killing me  
When I part from your sweet lips  
My dreams of you are censored  
Restless end in sight  
But thats a good thing  
Love is a good thing  
Love is a good thing  
Love is a good thing  
  
The first law of love  
Is all the rules could be re written  
The second law of love  
Is just what we make it  
No question  
Thats a good thing  
Loves a good thing  
  
The first law of love  
Is all the rules could be re written  
The second law of love  
Is just what we make it  
No question  
Thats a good thing  
Loves a good thing  
  
The first law of love  
Is all the rules could be re written  
The second law of love  
Is just what we make it  
No question  
Thats a good thing  
Loves a good thing
