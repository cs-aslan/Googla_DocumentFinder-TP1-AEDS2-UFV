I dont have faith in technology  
Even though we created it  
All this stuff just breaks down anyway  
And you can never get it fixed  
But I do have faith in you  
  
I dont have faith in politics  
But I do believe in the will of the people  
I dont know much about big time religion  
But I believe in the cross on the steeple  
And I do have faith in you  
  
Bridge  
And after all this time the lie becomes the truth  
We traded in our innocence and sacrificed our youth  
But you give me your love the one thing I cant lose  
You believe in me  
And I still have faith in you  
  
Interlude  
  
The more I search for my significance  
Seems the more I disappear  
And I wonder have I made a difference in anybodys life  
Since Ive been here  
And I can hear your laughter its the sweetest sound Ive ever known  
I dont know how love happens  
But I know Im not alone  
And I do have faith in you  
  
Bridge  
And after all this time sometimes I see the truth  
And Im touched by your innocence and  
Now Im not confused  
You give my your love the one thing I cant lose  
You believe in me  
And I still have faith in  
I do have faith in you
