Jessie she stares like a cat with a bird  
That has fallen and broke its wing  
Terri she puts on her makeup  
And wonders what promise the new day will bring  
  
Debbie stays home with the baby  
While I work my hands to the bone  
Yeah I make a living they do the giving  
In a house weve been calling home  
  
Just a house weve been trying to live in  
Just a place weve been calling our own  
Me and my wives have been spending our lives  
In a house weve been calling home  
  
Jessies the youngest she always needs  
Answers to questions that I just dont know  
Terri she cant sit still for a moment  
Shes always in some hurry to go  
  
Debbies been with me the longest  
We spend most of our time on the phone  
Talking in rhymes with no reasons in mind  
For this house weve been calling home  
  
Just a house weve been trying to live in  
Just a place weve been calling our own  
Me and my wives have been spending our lives  
In a house weve been calling home
