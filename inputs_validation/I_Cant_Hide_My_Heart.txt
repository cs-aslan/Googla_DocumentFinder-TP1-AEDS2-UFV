When were in a crowd Im sure youve noticed how  
I love to look at you you you you  
No I cant deny I get hypnotized  
When I look at you look at you look at you  
Oh its the kind of thing that I cant explain  
No matter how I try  
Its no mystery the whole world can see  
How I feel inside feel inside  
  
Oh oh baby  
I cant hide my heart  
Its been that way right from the start  
These feelings I know  
Cant help but show  
And I cant hide my heart  
  
When were all alone oh its just as strong  
When I look at you  
Maybe even more behind these doors  
As Im loving you loving you  
  
Oh oh baby  
I cant hide my heart  
Its been that way right from the start  
These feelings I know  
Cant help but show  
And I cant hide my heart  
  
Baby you never will be lonely as long as Im alive  
Youll always be my one and only for the rest of my life  
Ooooh ooooh  
  
Oh oh baby  
I cant hide my heart  
Its been that way right from the start  
These feelings I know  
Cant help but show  
And I cant hide my heart  
  
I cant hide my heart  
Its been that way right from the start  
I cant hide my heart and I cant hide my heart  
Its been that way right from the start  
I cant hide my heart  
I cant hide my heart
