All of my life Ive dreamed a love would come to me  
Its here and now I know its more that and other love could be  
I never though Id know someone who loved me so  
To go as for to die that His love for me would show  
I searched all over but I still couldnt find  
Someone to give me love to heal my hurt and ease my mind  
I sought affection tried everything new  
Didnt even know that I was lost without a clue  
Chorus  
You have opened my eyes to a greater love  
You have opened my eyes to a greater love  
I used to be so blind but now its clear to me  
How your love was displayed by what you did on Calvary  
Ive got to tell the world that they might hurt you  
To find what Ive found to really see how  
You have captured my soul you have made me whole  
You have set me free cause I have given you control  
You have mended my heart and I have been redesigned  
Lord with everything you are you have been blowin my mind  
chorus  
Its an eternal fantasy that will never ever change  
And you know Hes rearranged my life  
Its and eternal fantasy that will never go away  
Cause its true areEALITwhy  
bridge  
chorus out
