One day I found a love  
Offering peace unto my soul  
I been so happy ever since that day  
Nothing but joy unspeakable  
  
And I know that it came from above  
And Ill let it show  
And Ill let it go  
Take it everywhere I go  
  
Day by day  
Im going to keep Your spirit in my heart  
And even if the world grows cold  
I know Your love for me will never part  
  
Sometimes I feel so inspired  
And other times I just wanna give up  
Thats when I feel Your presence  
Giving me confidence and trust  
  
And I know that it come from above  
And Ill let it show  
And Ill let go  
Take it everywhere I go  
  
Day by day  
Im going to keep Your spirit in my heart  
And even if the world grows cold  
I know Your love for me will never part  
  
Im glad I found Your love  
Its unconditional and its unconditional  
And Ill never let it go  
Let it go let it go  
  
I know that it came from above  
And Ill let it show  
And Ill let it go  
Take it everywhere I go  
  
Day by day  
Im going to keep Your spirit in my heart  
And even if the world grows cold  
I know Your love for me will never part  
  
Day by day  
Im going to keep Your spirit in my heart  
And even if the world grows cold  
I know Your love for me will never part  
  
Day by day  
Im going to keep Your spirit in my heart  
And even if the world grows cold  
I know Your love for me will never part
