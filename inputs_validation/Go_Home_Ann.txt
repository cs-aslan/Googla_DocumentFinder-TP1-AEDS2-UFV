Go home Ann  
Go home Ann  
Go home Ann  
Ann go home  
I had you in my bed last night  
I did what I wanted to do well all right  
Go home Ann its almost funny  
Go home Ann its almost done  
I never said I loved you  
Never said I cared  
This wont last forever  
There is something in my heart  
Go home Ann  
Go home Ann  
Go home Ann  
Ann go home  
I tricked you had my fun  
You could have been anyone  
Go home Ann its almost funny  
Go home Ann its almost done  
I never said I loved you  
Never said I cared  
This wont last forever  
There is something in my heart
