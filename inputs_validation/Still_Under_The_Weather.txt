My first lesson  
In losin love was you  
Learnin to live with your memory  
Was lesson number two  
And I cant lie  
Baby I still cry sometimes  
But Ive come a long way  
Towards gettin you out of my mind  
Im still under the weather  
But Im over the storm  
I still miss the shelter  
Of your lovin arms  
But what I thought would kill me  
Has just made me strong  
Im still under the weather  
But Im over the storm  
Sometimes your memory  
Still gets the best of me  
But that lonely ache in my heart  
Aint as bad as it used to be  
And sometimes the way that Im feelin  
Inside doesnt show  
But I know  
Ill get over you Ive just got a long way to go  
Im still under the weather  
But Im over the storm  
I still miss the shelter  
Of your lovin arms  
But what I thought would kill me  
Has just made me strong  
Im still under the weather  
But Im over the storm  
Im still under the weather  
But Im over the storm
