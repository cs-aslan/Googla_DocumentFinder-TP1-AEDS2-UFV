Going to Rosas Cantina  
Going to Rosas Cantina  
Hoping that shes still there  
Going to Rosas Cantina  
  
Might have been  
The dust in my eyes  
The dust in my eyes  
  
Could have been the neon cactus  
Lighting up the desert sky  
Must have been  
The dust in my eyes  
  
Some would call it suicide  
Some would call it suicide  
I would call it paradise  
Some would call it suicide  
  
Dancing on the table  
Dancing on the table  
Dancing on the table  
When shes  
Drunker than shes able  
Dancing on the table  
  
Some would call it suicide  
I would call it paradise  
Some would call it suicide  
Some would call it hell on earth  
  
Is she right is she wrong  
Will she sing another song  
Wicked as it seems  
Right now  
  
Rosa wants her baby back  
Rosa wants her baby back  
Since hes gone shes losing track  
Rosa wants her baby back  
  
Careful with that cadillac  
Careful with that cadillac  
Careful with that cadillac
