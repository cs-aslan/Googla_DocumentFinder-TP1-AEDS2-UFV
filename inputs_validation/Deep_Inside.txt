Its 3 oclock  
And we ask ourselves  
Where are we now  
It seems weve wondered out of bounds again  
Over and over we ask ourselves why we dont utilize  
Things that are stored  
Deep inside of our brains  
  
Im on my own and I cant see straight  
Am I so stoned that I cant see straight  
Man Ive got to find my way back home  
But Im too deep inside  
Its 4 oclock  
And we ask ourselves  
Where did I go wrong  
  
We passed my house at least an hour ago  
Over and over we ask ourselves why  
Dont we utilize things  
That are stored deep inside of our brains  
Im on my own and I cant see straight  
Am I sooo stoned that I cant see straight  
  
Its 5 oclock  
And we tell ourselves  
We need to get home The sun is creeping overhead again  
Im way too deep inside to go home  
Ive got to get sane
