Were lining up in supermarkets for cancer  
Practically begging to die a long unnatural death  
Would you like some food with your chemicals  
Its being processed with a lot of question marks and uncertainty  
  
Buying organic is becoming a fraud to maximize profits  
Its the same old shit just with a fancy sticker  
Corporations set the standards and capitalize  
They dont need animal testingwere the guinea pigs  
Theyre shoving shit down our throats that dogs wont eat  
Then feigning shock that disease is on the rise  
  
The fda should step in but theyre in bed  
With the very corporations theyre supposed to regulate  
Conflict of interest No  
Theyre not interested in us because money is money  
And were all gonna die anyway
