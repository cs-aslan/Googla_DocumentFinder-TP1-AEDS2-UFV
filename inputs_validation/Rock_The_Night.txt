Ive gone through changes  
Ive gone through pain  
But theres not enough reason for me to go insane  
I know the feeling when it grows  
Im in a rage up from my head down to my toes  
  
You know it aint easy  
Running out of thrills  
You know it aint easy  
When you dont know what you want  
  
Rock now rock the night  
Til early in the morning light  
Rock now rock the night  
Youd better believe its right  
  
I know my limit  
Just what it takes  
When things aint good enough  
I just pull the brake  
Sometimes its easy  
Sometimes so tough  
But just have one thing clear  
I cant get enough
