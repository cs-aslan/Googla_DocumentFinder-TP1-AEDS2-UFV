Youd never know there was some music playin  
Until you talked your way inside the door  
And then a sound like rollin thunder  
Begins to push you right thru the floor  
  
And theres a great white sign  
With big black letters  
That just about explains it all  
  
If you dont like rock n roll  
Well if you dont like rock n roll  
If you dont like rock n roll  
Then its too late now  
Well its too late now  
  
Hey hey  
Of course there was the usual lady  
And she was dressed the way the stories tell  
So bein cool I made a move to grab her  
But you could see she read story well  
  
And then she whipped out a card  
With big black letters  
That just about explained it all  
  
Well if you dont like rock n roll  
If you dont like rock n roll  
Well if you dont like rock n roll  
Then youre too late now  
Then youre too late now  
  
Well if you dont like rock n roll  
Well if you dont like rock n roll yeah  
If you dont like rock n roll  
Well its too late now  
Well youre too late now  
  
If you dont like rock n roll  
If you dont like my rock n roll  
Then youre too late now  
Then youre too late now  
Then youre too late too late now
