If I stay I know Im that Ima share your love and that I couldnt take  
And if I go well be apart and I know my heart would surely break  
So what difference does it make which one I choose  
Either way I lose  
  
Though I know my love is true  
Id die if you ever told me goodbye  
Ever told me goodbye  
And I know she loves you too  
She would do the same as I  
  
What difference does it make which one I choose  
Either way I lose  
Either way I lose  
Either way I lose
