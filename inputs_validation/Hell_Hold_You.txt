Storms may come storms may go  
The pain may linger like melting snow  
The wind may toss you  
To and fro but hell hold you  
Through it all  
  
Hell hold you  
When the tempest rages all around  
Hell hold you  
Plant your feet on solid ground  
Hell hold you  
When the waves come crashing down  
Hell hold you through it all  
  
Hard time will come rain will pour  
You cant see the road anymore  
You hears been washed up  
Upon lifes shore  
But Hell hold you through it all  
  
Hell hold you  
When the tempest rages all around  
Hell hold you  
Plant your feet on solid ground  
Hell hold you  
When the waves come crashing down  
Hell hold you through it all oh  
  
When youre fallin  
Hear Him callin he will come  
In the midst of your storm  
Just hold on tight with all your might  
He will hold you through it all  
  
Hell hold you  
When the tempest rages all around  
Hell hold you  
Plant your feet on solid ground  
Hell hold you  
When the waves come crashing down  
Hell hold you through  
  
Hell hold you  
When the tempest rages all around  
Hell hold you  
Plant your feet on solid ground  
Hell hold you  
When the waves come crashing down  
Hell hold you through it all  
Hell hold you through  
Hell hold you through it all
