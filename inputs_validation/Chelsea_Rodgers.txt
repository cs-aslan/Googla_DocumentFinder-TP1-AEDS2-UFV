A model  
Used to be a role model  
  
I dont know  
Come on Chelsea  
I dunno  
Come on  
  
Ah go ahead now Chelsea Go ahead now  
Uh this for Jersey right here  
Go ahead now  
  
Chorus  
Chelsea Rodgers was a model  
Thought she really rocked the road yes she did  
Kept her tears up in a bottle  
Poured them out to save her soul  
  
Ask her what she liked the most  
She said she liked to talk to Jimis ghost  
Fantasy her friends boast This girl is fly  
Chelseas fly like coast to coast  
  
Hollywood or Times Square  
If the partys fly my girl is there  
Purples on and bounce in her hair  
Twenty first Century hippy Chelsea dont care  
  
Chorus  
  
Try to catch her if you can Come on now together  
You never see her with my man A brother got to jump n the water  
He must be baptized according to the master plan  
Fore she give up the good thing  
Go ahead Chelsea Go ahead Chelsea  
  
No cut diamonds and designer shoes Uh nono  
Because shes too original from her head down to her feet  
Rehab If you want to just dont mean no me  
Chelsea dont eat no meat still got butt like a leather seat  
Go ahead Chelsea Go ahead Chelsea  
  
Chorus  
  
Go ahead Chelsea  
Speak on that horn  
  
Come on  
Next to her they just a fool  
Chelsea read more books than a few  
Moses was a Pharoah in the eighteenth Dynasty  
And Rome was chilling in Carthage in 33 BC  
And the day that we stop counting we live as long as a tree  
Go ahead Chelsea teach me Go ahead Chelsea  
  
Make a promise to your higher self get you nothing fame and wealth  
You dont be chasing nobodies ghost  
Of everything make the most Come on  
  
Chorus x2
