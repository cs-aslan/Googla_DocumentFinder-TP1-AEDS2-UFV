I thought you and me were something special  
Thought you thought that way too  
Now I know that this old boy just aint the  
Best youll think youll ever do  
  
Chorus  
It aint cool to be crazy about you  
It aint suave or debonair  
To let you know I care  
Like I do  
It aint smart to be so reckless with my heart  
I Shouldve known right from the start  
Id end up like a fool  
Believe me it aint cool  
  
All of my friends they tried to tell me  
What and what not to do  
It took a while for them to sell me  
But finally they got through  
  
Chorus
