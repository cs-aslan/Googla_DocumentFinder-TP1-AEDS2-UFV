Oh baby what a place to be  
In the service of the bourgeoisie  
Where can my believers be  
I want to jump into the endless sea  
  
Oh oh the endless sea  
Oh oh the endless sea  
I want to jump into the endless sea  
Let it wash all over me  
  
Above us is a dirty sky  
Full of youths and liquors  
A little girl a little guy  
This air cant get much thicker  
  
Oh oh the endless sea  
Oh oh the endless sea  
Oh oh the endless sea  
Let it wash all over me  
  
And when youre tight for the rent  
You think youre gonna break  
But you know its no damn good  
Just one more phony on the take  
You better go home buddy  
  
I really think  
You better go home buddy  
You better go home buddy  
The endless sea
