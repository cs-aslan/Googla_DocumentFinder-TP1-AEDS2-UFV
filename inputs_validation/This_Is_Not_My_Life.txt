This this is not my life  
This this is not my life  
  
This is not my face  
This is not my place no its just isnt right  
  
This this is not my life  
  
You do you remember me  
Remember the way that it used to be  
  
Do you remember our car  
Do you remember our house  
Do you remember what it was like  
Cause this this is not my life  
  
Chorus  
My life my life Now I live in the shadows  
My life my life Because you are my life  
My life my life  
My life  
  
Youre the only one who can see the real me  
Youre the only one cant you see cant you see  
  
You took away my world  
You took away my world  
  
You took away my smile  
You took away my life  
You took away my reason to live  
  
You you took away my world  
And this is not my life  
And this is not my life  
  
My life my life Cause now I live in the shadows  
My life my life Because you are my life  
My life my life And now its endless night  
My life my life And this is not my life  
My life my life  
My life my life
