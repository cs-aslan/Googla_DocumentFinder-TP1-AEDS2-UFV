Ive pulled down my lace and the chintz  
Oh do you know you have the face of a genius  
Ill send your love to Zeus  
Oh by the time you read this  
Ill be well in touch  
  
Im giving it all in a moment or two  
Im giving it all in a moment for you  
Im giving it all giving it giving it  
This kicking here inside  
Makes me leave you behind  
No more under the quilt  
To keep you warm  
Your sister I was born  
You must lose me like an arrow  
Shot into the killer storm  
  
You and me on the bobbing knee  
Didnt we cry at that old mythology hed read  
I will come home again but not until  
The sun and the moon meet on yon hill  
  
Im giving it all in a moment or two  
Im giving it all in a moment for you  
Im giving it all giving it giving it  
This kicking here inside  
Makes me leave you behind  
No more under the quilt  
To keep you warm  
Your sister I was born  
You must lose me like an arrow  
Shot into the killer storm
