Chorus  
We are going up in flames  
One more night for us to burn brighter  
We are going up in flames  
One last time for us to go higher  
We are going up in flames  
One more night for us to burn brighter  
We are going up in flames  
One last time for us to go higher  
  
Anyway lil nigga dont test the kid  
Even Maury Povich couldnt test the kid  
Even R Kelly couldnt touch the kid  
And even with all your bars you couldnt text the kid  
I got a pool that I never even swam in  
Airports that you bitches never land in  
They be like what you doing Nicki  
Brandin  
Suck a cockpit prepare for landin  
Im brandin I aint talking about Presley  
I keep a sniper I aint talking about Wesley  
Why these bitches so pressed B  
Open my trunk all I gotta do is press B  
Ima violate yall asses like Chris Stokes  
Im the Sandro paid on a big boat  
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat  
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat  
  
Chorus  
  
Won another round Willin get the ref  
Got the clothing line poppin and the wigs is next  
When I fly you know G5 is the jet  
Im the motherfuckin Queen lizabeth  
Meetings with the president of every network  
That is what the fuck I call how to network  
My net worth that net works  
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work  
Chillin with executives  
Check the charts all my winnings are consecutive  
Trillion dollar deficit  
But yall dont hear me though all you bitches deaf as shit  
Bbitches aint got punchlines or flow  
I have both and an empire also  
Sell out shows out in Norway Oslo  
This is the ReUp better cop it while the cost low  
Fflows sick IIll slap a patient  
Im checkin these bitches like an application  
Cause these bitches trippin no navigation  
So its off with your head decapitation  
Ssssend em up in flames like a firemen  
I do the hirin and I do the firin  
That boss shit that you talk I live it  
And Im callin a travel if you dont stay on your pivot  
Bitches  
  
Chorus
