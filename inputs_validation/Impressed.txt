Sweet confetti out looking for a saviour  
Finding it hard to break the change  
Nothing ventured nothing gained  
Ice cream beauty acting on her best behaviour  
Finding it hard to bite her tongue  
Feeling so old as the night is young  
Six foot leaning on a lizard chest  
Two red dragons ironed on his vest  
All that money you deserve the best  
Im impressed  
Im impressed  
Im impressed  
What youve got isnt all that youve been given  
Changing your body like you change your jeans  
Nothing is ever as it seems  
Something tells me its a marriage made in heaven  
Stealing your look from a magazine  
Playing the part from a movie scene  
Six foot leaning on a lizard chest  
Two red dragons ironed on his vest  
All that money you deserve the best  
Im impressed  
Im impressed  
Im impressed  
Everyday is like your birthday  
But the candles burning out Dont you see Dont you see  
Six foot leaning on a lizard chest  
Two red dragons ironed on his vest  
All that money you deserve the best  
Im impressed  
Im impressed  
Im impressed
