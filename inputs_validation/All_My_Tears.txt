When I go dont cry for me  
In my fathers arms Ill be  
The wounds this world left on my soul  
Will all be healed and Ill be whole  
  
Sun and moon will be replaced  
With the light of Jesus face  
And I will not be ashamed  
For my savior knows my name  
  
It dont matter where you bury me  
Ill be home and Ill be free  
It dont matter where I lay  
All my tears be washed away  
  
Gold and silver blind the eye  
Temporary riches lie  
Come and eat from heavens store  
Come and drink and thirst no more  
  
So weep not for me my friend  
When my time below does end  
For my life belongs to him  
Who will raise the dead again  
  
It dont matter where you bury me  
Ill be home and Ill be free  
It dont matter where I lay  
All my tears be washed away
