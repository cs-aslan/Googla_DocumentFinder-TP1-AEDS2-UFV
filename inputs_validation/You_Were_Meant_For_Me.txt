Oooh ooh oo  
I have loved you for so long  
Cant imagine myself with another  
Youre so much a part of me  
Youre inside me  
I wanna be good enough for you  
In everything I do  
Dont you ever set me free  
Id rather be locked up in your arms cant you see  
Theres no place I would rather be  
Ill go wherever your love takes me  
Refrain  
Cause You were meant for me  
As I was meant for you  
You were meant for me  
Together we will always be  
Cause You were meant for me  
You were meant for me  
My love gets stronger day by day  
Strong enough to stand the test of time  
And even when times are rough  
We were tough enough  
Theres nothing I can do  
With you Ill see life through  
No one else can make me feel  
So good with your love so real  
Nothing else can ever replace  
Your kisses and your warm embrace  
Repeat Refrain  
Bridge  
I love you so much baby  
You just drive me crazy  
Im hooked on your lovin touch  
With you this life worth living  
For you Ill keep on trying  
Ill never ever let you down  
Instrumental  
Ill keep holding on  
Instrumental  
Repeat Refrain ad lib fade out
