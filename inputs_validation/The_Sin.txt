Its none of my business  
But if I may  
Remind you of the time  
When you did something you knew was wrong  
It wasnt called a crime  
And Im not saying that you should give  
A sucker an even break  
Im talking about the time  
That you were cruel for crueltys sake  
Im talking about the time  
That you were cruel for crueltys sake  
  
Chorus  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for the sin  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for the sin  
  
Maybe you went and stuck your key  
In somebody elses door  
Maybe you went and helped yourself  
To something that wasnt yours  
Maybe you simply criticized  
Someone you hardly knew  
You ruined part of their life for them  
Part of your own life too  
  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for the sin  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for it then  
  
If and when you feel an ill wind  
Dont be too surprised  
Remember when you should have  
Picked on somebody your own size  
  
Chorus  
  
How am I gonna pay for  
How am I gonna pay for  
How am I gonna pay for the sin
