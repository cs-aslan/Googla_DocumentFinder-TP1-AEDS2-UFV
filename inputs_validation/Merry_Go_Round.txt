When I first met you baby I didnt even know your name  
Yes when I first met you babe I didnt even know your name  
I was feeling so low on the ground  
Bad luck and evil women was to blame  
  
I never realized just how sweet and kind one woman can be  
Yes I never realized people just how sweet and kind one woman can be  
Yes but when I looked in your eyes  
Yeah I knew true love had come to me  
Yeah  
  
Take my hand baby now you hold it tight and dont let go  
Take my hand now hold it tight and dont let go  
Yes cause our love is like a merry go round  
And round forever its gonna go
