The moon goes up I start to sweat call the doctor call the vet my brain goes
numb my blood gets hot all I need is what you got  
  
Im a werewolf baby and here I come Im a werewolf baby and here I come  
  
I lose control I just cant stop you look so good like a big pork chop ripped
my pants ripped my shirt Im gonna eat your  
Mother for dessert  
  
I can smell your blood I can hear you breathe Im gonna eat your heart right
off your sleeve eat you cooked eat you raw Im  
Gonna rip you up like a big chain saw
