I know her footsteps like the back of my hand  
I heard her coming though she was walking on sand  
I could smell her perfume from a 1000 smiles away  
Stuck in my head yeah it stuck in my brain  
She looked so good and I thought she could have been  
A fashion bomb a fashion bomb  
Looked so nervous she look so afraid  
Looked like somebody had just stepped on her grave  
Last night at the control centre  
She lost ccccomplet control oh no  
She lost her mind now shes one of a kind  
A fashion bomb a fashion bomb  
Shes radio active you can see it in her eyes  
Radioactive from her hips to her thighs  
Radioactive she could kill you with one kiss  
Radioactive she said what do you think of this  
Im such a big girl and Im gonna show the world  
Im a fashion bomb a fashion bomb  
I work all day and l work all night  
I sleep on corners where vampires bite  
My place is riddled with machine gun fire  
But I stlll look pretty and my bodys for hire  
Say a goodbye to Joni from the real world  
Say goodbye to Mary shes such a stupid girl  
She knows whats coming but shes got no defense  
She just cant stop it though it doesnt make no sense  
Here comes the bitch shes much too rich to be a fashion bomb  
Ad libs to fade
