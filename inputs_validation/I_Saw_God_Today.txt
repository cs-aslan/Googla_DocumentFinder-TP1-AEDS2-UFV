I just walked down the street to the coffee shop  
Had to take a break  
Id been by her side for eighteen hours straight  
I saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk  
Pushing up through the concrete  
Like it was planted right there for me to see  
The flashin lights the honkin horns  
All seemed to fade away  
In the shadow of that hospital at 508  
I saw God today  
  
Chorus  
Ive been to church  
Ive read the book  
I know Hes here but I dont look  
Near as often as I should  
Yeah I know I should  
His fingerprints are everywhere  
Id just slow down to stop and stare  
Opened my eyes and man I swear  
I saw God today  
  
I saw a couple walking by they were holding hands  
Man she had that glow  
Yeah I couldnt help but notice she was starting to show  
It stood there for a minute takin the sky  
Lost in that sunset  
A splash of amber melted in the shades of red  
  
Chorus  
  
I got my face pressed up against the nursery glass  
Shes sleeping like a rock  
My name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks  
Shes got my nose shes got her mamas eyes  
My brand new baby girl  
Shes a miracle  
I saw God today
