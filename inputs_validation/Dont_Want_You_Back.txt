You hit me faster than a shark attack  
You saw my picture  
On the Backstreets Back alright  
And you were more than just a pretty face  
But how you fooled me Im still amazed baby  
But I should have known that I would be  
Another victim of your sexuality  
But now were done and over with  
I dont want you back  
  
Chorus  
Dont want you back  
Cause youre no good for me  
I know  
Thats all I can say  
Dont want you back  
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go  
I dont want you back  
  
You started going out with socalled friends  
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense  
But there were things that made me realize  
Like all the hundred no thousand lies  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby dont bother telling me your reasons why  
  
Just let us sing this story bout you and I  
Dont want you back  
Thats all I know  
Dont want you back  
All I can say  
Dont want you back  
You know you gotta go  
  
Chorus
