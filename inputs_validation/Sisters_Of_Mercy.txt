Oh the sisters of mercy they are not departed or gone  
They were waiting for me when I thought that I just cant go on  
And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song  
Oh I hope you run into them you whove been travelling so long  
  
Yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control  
It begins with your family but soon it comes around to your soul  
Well Ive been where youre hanging I think I can see how youre pinned  
When youre not feeling holy your loneliness says that youve sinned  
  
Well they lay down beside me I made my confession to them  
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem  
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn  
They will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem  
  
When I left they were sleeping I hope you run into them soon  
Dont turn on the lights you can read their address by the moon  
And you wont make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night  
We werent lovers like that and besides it would still be all right  
We werent lovers like that and besides it would still be all right
