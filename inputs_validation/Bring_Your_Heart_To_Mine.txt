Why am I not surprised I see it in your eyes  
Youre just not happy with your life  
Running from guy to guy  
Living another lie when you should be mine  
  
I saw you on the block today  
Was gonna speak but I walked away  
Couldnt find a single thing to say  
Down the street the thought had still remained  
Girl he must be insane  
How could he treat you that way oh  
  
Just cause he wants to make love  
Doesnt mean that hes in love with you  
And I really hope you hear me this time  
Maybe one day youll wake up  
Then youll have to face up to the truth  
  
I dont want to be a hater  
But he really needs to raise up off you  
And I hope you understand it tonight  
I dont care what it takes girl  
Theres too much at stake girl  
No mountains too high to climb  
To bring your heart to mine  
  
Why do we play this game  
Love cant be contained  
Ive got to make my move oh yeah  
I can feel the flames  
Whenever youre close to me  
I dont know what to do  
  
Ill wait long as I can for you  
Give all that I am for you  
I know hes not the man for you  
In my soul I got plans for you  
Ill be holding on Yeah  
Cause I know that hell be gone ooh  
  
Just cause he wants to make love  
Doesnt mean that hes in love with you  
And I really hope you hear me tonight  
Maybe one day youll wake up  
Then youll have to face up to the truth  
  
I dont want to be a hater  
But he really needs to raise up off you  
Girl I really hope you hear me this time  
I dont care what it takes girl  
Theres too much at stake girl  
Just give me some kind of sign  
And Ill bring your heart to mine  
  
Girl I know sometimes  
That you feel like the sun dont shine  
But if you look real deep inside  
Youll realize you should be mine  
  
Just cause he wants to make love  
Doesnt mean that hes in love with you  
Wont you try to understand me tonight  
Maybe one day youll wake up  
Then youll have to face up to the truth  
  
I dont want to be a hater  
But he really needs to raise up off you  
Girl I swear that what Im saying it right  
I dont care what it takes girl  
Theres too much at stake girl  
Ill come for you anytime  
To bring your heart to mine  
  
Just cause he wants to make love  
Doesnt mean that hes in love with you  
I really hope you hear me tonight  
Maybe one day youll wake up  
And give me your love  
Its killing me but Im trying  
To bring your heart to mine
