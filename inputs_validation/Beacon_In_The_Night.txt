Many souls are driftin on the troubled sea of sin  
The under tow of evil has pulled so many in  
Tonight the troubled ways of sorrow fill our hearts with pride  
And were so blind that we cant see the beacon in the night  
  
The beacon in the night is always shinin  
And darkest clouds can have a silver linin  
Just set your torch for glory then dont turn left or right  
Heavens shore is lighted by the beacon in the night  
  
When the mist of wickedness conceals the beacons light  
And youre driftin through the fog somewhere out in the night  
The one who whispers peace be still and calms the raging sea  
He is the beacon in the night Hell rescue you and me  
  
The beacon in the night is always shinin  
And storm clouds can have a silver linin  
So set your course for glory and dont turn left or right  
Be guided straight to Heaven by the beacon in the night
