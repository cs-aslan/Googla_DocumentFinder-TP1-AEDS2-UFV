Maybe just a good nights sleep  
Would have changed your troubled mind  
From that rather permanent decision  
So tragic so unkind  
Now pain is what youve given  
And sleep is what youll get  
So far away from that sweet baby child  
Who hardly knew you yet  
  
Now hell grow up to be a fighter  
Full of anger full of shame  
Like all the other haunted children  
Who wonder why they came  
And hell be in and out of trouble  
Until he stands up or he falls  
But there will always be a shadow there  
No matter how it goes  
Damn it Rose  
  
Is this another cryptic message  
Or some kind of cosmic quiz  
If theres a lesson to be learned from this  
Well I dont know what it is  
  
You could have given us the finger  
Much more constructively than that  
Now I sit here with the MTV  
And your bloated Burmese cat  
Were being treated to the wisdom  
Of some puffed up little fart  
Doing exactly what I used to do  
Pretensions to anarchy and art  
He speaks the language of a warrior  
He mounts his misinformed attack  
He wears the clothes of a dissenter  
But theres a logo on his back  
And its a hollow rebellion  
As rebellions mostly are  
Its just another raging tempest in a jar  
  
And the seasons keep on changing  
And the wind blows hot and cold  
Wish that you were here with us to watch this tide  
As it ebbs and flows  
Damn it Rose
