kirsty maccoll  
I thought of you when they closed down the school  
And the hospital too  
Did they think that you were better  
They were wrong  
You had so many friends  
They all left you in the end  
cause they couldnt stand the patter  
And Ill see you baby when the clans rise again  
Women and children united by a struggle  
Going down  
Youve got to walk into the water  
With your sister and your daughter  
In this free world  
If I wore your shades could I share your point of view  
Could I make you feel better  
Paint a picture write a letter  
Well I know what youre saying  
But I see the things you do  
And its much too dangerous  
To get closer to you  
And Ill see you baby when the clans rise again  
Women and children united by the struggle  
Going down  
With a pocketful of plastic  
Like a dollar on elastic  
In this free world  
I wouldnt tell you if I didnt care  
And Ill see you baby when the clans rise again  
Women and children united by the struggle  
And the ghettoes are full of mercedes benz  
And youd never hurt a friend  
Who wouldnt tell you  
Its cold and its going to get colder  
You may not get much older  
Youre much too scared of living  
And to die is a reliable exit  
So you push it and you test it  
With thunderbird and rivin  
And Ill see you baby when the clans rise again  
Women and children united in the struggle  
In this free world baby  
Got to take it got to grab it  
Got to get it up and shag it  
In this free world  
Going down  
Youve got to get into the water  
Like a lamb goes to the slaughter  
In this free world baby  
Going down  
With a pocketful of plastic  
Like a dollar on elastic  
In this free world  
I wouldnt tell you if I didnt care
