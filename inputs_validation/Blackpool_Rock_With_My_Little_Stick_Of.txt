Every year when summer comes round off to the sea I go  
I dont care if I do spend a pound Im rather rash I know  
See me dressed like all the sports in my blazer and a pair of shorts  
With my little stick of Blackpool Rock along the promenade I stroll  
It may be sticky but I never complain its nice to have a nibble at it now
and again  
Every day wherever I stray the kids all round me flock  
  
One afternoon the band conductor up on his stand  
Somehow lost his baton  it flew out of his hand  
So I jumped in his place and then conducted the band  
With my little stick of Blackpool Rock  
  
With my little stick of Blackpool Rock  
Along the promenade I stroll  
In my pocket it got stuck I could tell  
Cause when I pulled it out I pulled my shirt off as well  
Every day wherever I stray the kids all round me flock  
  
A girl while bathing clung to me my wits had to use  
She cried Im drowning and to save me you wont refuse  
I said Well if youre drowning then I dont want to lose  
My little stick of Blackpool Rock   
  
With my little stick of Blackpool Rock  
Along the promenade I stroll  
In the ballroom I went dancing each night  
No wonder every girl that danced with me stuck to me tight  
  
Every day wherever I stray the kids all round me flock  
A fellow took my photograph it cost one and three  
I said when it was done Is that supposed to be me  
Youve properly mucked it up the only thing I can see is  
My little stick of Blackpool Rock
