Seems like it was only yesterday  
She was living here  
Yea she was living here  
Lord knows why Hes taken her away  
It isnt very clear no it isnt very clear  
Into every life a little rain must fall  
And losing one you love is like a storm  
But storms are passing  
  
Chorus  
I hear Leesha  
Singing in heaven tonight  
And in between the sadness  
I hear Leesha  
Telling me that shes alright  
  
Life goes on even after life  
Thats what I believe  
Yea thats what I believe  
Leeshas gone but she will still survive  
In a memory that Im keeping here with me  
Silencing the voice of mortal tragedy  
Listening to whispers of the soul  
All is peaceful  
  
Chorus
