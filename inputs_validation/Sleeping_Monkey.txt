Oh the people would come from far and away  
Theyd dance all night till the break of day  
When the caller would holler Dosido  
You knew Uncle Pen was ready to go  
  
Late in the evening about sun down  
High on the hill and above the town  
Uncle Pen played the fiddle Lord a how itd ring  
You could hear it talk you could hear it sing  
  
Oh he played an old piece he called Soldiers Joy  
And he had one he called Boston Boy  
The greatest of all was Ginny Lyn  
To me thats where the fiddlin begin  
  
Chorus  
Oh Ill never forget that mournful day  
When Uncle Pen was called away  
They hung up his fiddle they hung up his bow  
You knew it was time for him to go  
  
Chorus
