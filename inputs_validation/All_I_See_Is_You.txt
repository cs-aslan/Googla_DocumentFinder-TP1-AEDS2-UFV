I tried so hard  
All summer through  
Not to think too much of you  
But the more I try  
The more I find  
I just cant leave the past behind  
  
Times that are happy  
Are times that are few  
And once I was happy  
When I had you  
  
But days have come and gone  
Since you were here  
Nights are twice as long  
Without you near  
Pictures on my mind  
Stand out so clear  
No matter where I am  
Or what I do  
My darling  
All I see is you  
  
Youre there in every dream  
I ever dream  
There at every place  
Ive ever been  
Everyday I find  
Youre in my heart  
And on my mind  
I close my eyes  
But Im not blind  
I see you still  
And when I throw my arms out wide  
I find that youre not by my side  
But one thing is for sure  
Until I do  
All I see is you  
  
Everyday I find  
Youre in my heart  
And on my mind  
I close my eyes  
But Im not blind  
I see you still oh  
  
I wont live again  
Til Im with you  
Oh darling  
I wont love again  
Unless its with you  
  
So until the day  
When you are back with me to stay  
In every way  
All I see is you
