Well Im a jitterbug boy by the shoeshine  
Resting on my laurels and my hardys too  
Life of Riley on a swing shift gears follow my drift  
Once upon a time I was in showbiz too  
I seen the Brooklyn Dodgers playing at Ebbets Field  
Seen the Kentucky Derby too  
Its fast women slow horses unreliable sources  
And Im holding up the lamppost if you want to know  
Ive seen the Wabash Cannonball buddy Ive done it all  
Cause I slept with the lions and Marilyn Monroe  
Had breakfast in the eye of a hurricane  
Fought Rocky Marciano played Minnesota Fats  
Burned hundreddollar bills Ive eaten Mulligan stew  
Got drunk with Louis Armstrong whats that old song  
I taught Mickey Mantle everything that he knows  
So you ask me what Im doing here holding up the lamppost  
Flipping this quarter trying to make up my mind  
And if its heads I go to Tennessee and tails I buy a drink  
If it lands on the edge I keep talking to you  
scat
