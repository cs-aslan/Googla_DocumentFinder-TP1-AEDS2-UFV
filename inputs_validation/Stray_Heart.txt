I lost my way  
Oh baby this stray heart  
Went to another  
Can you recover baby  
Oh youre the only one that Im dreamin of  
Your precious heart  
Was torn apart by me and you  
  
Youre not alone  
Oh oh and now Im where I belong  
Were not alone  
Oh oh Ill hold your heart and never let go  
  
Everything that I want  
I want from you  
But I just cant have you  
Everything that I need  
I need from you  
But I just cant have you  
  
I said a thousand times  
And now a thousand one  
Well never part  
Ill never stray again from you  
This dog is destined for a home to your heart  
Well never part  
Ill never stray again from you  
Youre not alone  
Oh oh and now Im where I belong  
Were not alone  
Oh oh Ill hold your heart and never let go  
  
Everything that I want  
I want from you  
But I just cant have you  
Everything that I need  
I need from you  
But I just cant have you  
  
Youre not alone  
Oh oh and now Im where I belong  
Were not alone  
Oh oh Ill hold your heart and never let go  
  
Everything that I want  
I want from you  
But I just cant have you  
Everything that I need  
I need from you  
But I just cant have you  
  
Everything that I want  
I want from you  
But I just cant have you  
Everything that I need  
I need from you  
But I just  
Just cant have you
