Sweet relief calms me down  
Makes me drown lost and found  
Neighbours complain sheets are stained  
Hotel shower the best around  
Spacing from Paris to new york  
Silver sunglasses silver phone  
Connect us to someone who doesnt know  
About these feelings we cant control  
People they want us to fall down  
But we wont ever touch the ground  
Were perfectly balanced well float around  
Til no one is near do you hear this sound  
Spacing from Paris to new york  
Silver sunglasses silver phone  
Connect us to someone who doesnt know  
About these feelings we cant control  
This strange feeling captures us it generates this huge fuzz  
I miss you all the time I must face I miss your touch and your embrace
