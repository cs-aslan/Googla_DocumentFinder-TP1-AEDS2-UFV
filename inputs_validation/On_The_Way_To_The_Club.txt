On my way to the club  
I fell down a hole  
All the people there  
Said you come alone  
And I I just want to be darling with you  
The musics made that way  
My eyes arent blue  
Theres nothing I can do  
  
So I stayed in the club  
Just rewarding myself  
Happiness could turn into something else  
And I just wanna be darling with you  
The musics made that way  
My eyes arent blue theres nothing I can do
