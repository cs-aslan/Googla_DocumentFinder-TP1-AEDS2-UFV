Did you expect me to reason with thunder  
I still remember when time was frozen  
What seemed forever was just a moment

Hurry up hurry up  
Theres no more waiting  
Were still worth saving

Feel the light  
Shining in the dark of night  
Remember what we forgot  
I know its a long shot  
But were bringing it all back  
Were bringing it all back  
  
Feel the light  
Shining like the stars tonight  
Remember what we forgot  
I know its a long shot  
But were bringing it all back  
Were bringing it all back
