And every time I get to thinking  
Every thought of you I want to shout aloud  
Then I think about the love I have inside me  
How you brought whats inside out  
Now loves made it to the outside  
I want to tell the world of everthing Ive found  
Somehow your love released a spring wound up inside me  
You turned my living upside down  
And I cant tell the bottom from the top  
Am I standing on my head or on my heels  
Is it cloudy is it bright  
Is it day or is it night  
Am I wrong or am I right  
And is it real  
Tell me where you learned the magic  
The spell you used the day you made me fall  
Maybe now I know that love is no illusion  
Im upside down but ten feet tall  
On and on Ive drifted with the tide  
I didnt know that love could move me so  
You fed my life with love and much more besides  
And you showed me which way to go
