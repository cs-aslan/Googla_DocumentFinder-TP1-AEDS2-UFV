Still searching for that boy who had the faith to move a mountain  
Want the fire back  
  
Another question in me  
One for the powers that be  
Its got me thrown and so  
I Put on my poker face  
And try to figure it out  
This undeniable doubt  
A common occurrence  
Feeling so out of place  
  
Guarded and cynical now  
Cant help but wondering how  
My heart evolved into a  
Rock beating inside of me  
So I reel such a stoic ordeal  
Wheres that feeling that I dont feel  
  
Chorus  
There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain  
And like a child he would believe without a reason  
Without a trace he disappeared into the void and  
Ive been searching for that missing person  
  
Under a lavender moon  
So many thoughts consume me  
Who dimmed that glowing light  
That once burned so bright in me  
Is this a radical phase  
A problematical age  
That keeps me running  
From all that I used to be  
  
Is there a way to return  
Is there a way to unlearn  
That carnal knowledge  
Thats chipping away at my soul  
Ive been gone too long  
Will I ever find my way home  
  
Chorus  
  
There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain  
And like a child he would believe without a reason  
Without a trace he disappeared into the void and  
Ive been searching for that missing person  
He used to want to try to walk the straight and narrow  
He had a fire and he could feel it in the marrow  
Its been a long time and I havent seen him lately but  
Ive been searching for that missing person
