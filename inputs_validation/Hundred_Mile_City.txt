So I said Im on the roam so I need a car  
And I know that Im gettin alive  
And I say I got faith and a season  
And I say thats where Im goin to  
  
I get a need and Im wantin to please it  
I got a face and Im wantin to feel it  
The more I feel is the more that I need it  
The more I need is the less I believe it  
  
So Ive got a good love by my side  
Keep on gettin out of love and my pride  
Oh I know keep hurtin my love yeah  
But I swear it aint killin  
  
Get a need and Im wantin to please it  
Got a face and Im wantin to feel it  
I feel is the more that I need it  
All I need is the less I believe it  
  
So I said Im on the roam so I need a car  
And I know that Im stayin alive  
And I say I got faith and a season  
Well I say thats where I live  
  
I get a need and Im wantin to please it  
I got a face and Im wantin to feel it  
The more I feel is the more that I need it  
The more I need is the less I believe it
