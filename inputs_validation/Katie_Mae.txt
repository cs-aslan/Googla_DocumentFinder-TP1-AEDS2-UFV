Well you know Katie Mae is a good girl  
Folks say she dont run around at night  
I made a mistake and she dont run around at night  
Yes you can bet your last dollar Katie Mae will treat you right  
  
Well some folks say she must be a Cadillac  
But I say she got to be a tmodel ford  
Yes she got the shape all right but she cant carry no heavy load  
  
And she walks this life  
Her daddy got oil wells in his backyard  
Every time she got to working that woman she never has to work too hard  
  
I say byebye poor Katie Mae  
These are the last words I got to say  
Cause if I dont meet you tomorrow  
Ill get you early in the next day
