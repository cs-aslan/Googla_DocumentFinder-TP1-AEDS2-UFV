Well if youre ever in los angeles  
And youve got time to spare  
Take a stroll up sunset boulevard  
Youll find the whiskey there  
Gliding round the tables  
With wounderous natural ease  
Serving twostar brandy  
Is the body you have to seeall belonging to  
  
Longlegged linda  
She sure was worth the flight  
Longlegged linda is playing the whiskey  
Tonight  
  
Oh dont boogiewoogie with linda  
tho she dances like a dream  
She acts like shes a thousand  
But shes barely sweet sixten  
She rearranged my braincells  
And took control of me  
So if I miss my plain to jacksonville  
You can guess where Ill still beill be diggin
