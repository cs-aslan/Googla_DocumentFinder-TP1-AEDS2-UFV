When you were just a little girl in Pine Bluff  
Daddy disappeared without a trace  
Now theres no more little girls in Pine Bluff  
They all ran like tears out of this place  
  
Chorus  
Am I too late  
Am I too late  
Tell you that I love you  
Now theyve carried you away  
  
repeat  
  
Never thought that you would see a sickbed  
Never thought that youd stop bein round  
Now I hear youre lost and gone forever  
Just like all the other girls in town  
  
Chorus  
  
Now I hear that you have gone to Heaven  
And if theres one Im sure thats where you are  
Maybe youre the new star in the night sky  
Just outside the moonroof on my car  
  
2x Chorus  
  
Tell you that I love you  
Now theyve carried you away  
Tell you that I love you  
Now theyve carried you away  
Tell you that I love you  
Now theyve carried you away
