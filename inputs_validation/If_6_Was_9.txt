Yeah sing the song Bro  
  
If the sun refuse to shine  
I dont mind I dont mind  
If the mountains fell in the sea  
let it be it aint me  
Alright cos I got my own world to look through  
And I aint gonna copy you  
  
Now if 6 turned out to be 9  
I dont mind I dont mind  
Alright if all the hippies cut off all their hair  
I dont care I dont care  
Dig cos I got my own world to live through  
And I aint gonna copy you  
  
White collared conservative flashing down the street  
  
Pointing their plastic finger at me  
Theyre hoping soon my kind will drop and die  
But Im gonna wave my freak flag high high  
Wave on wave on  
Fall mountains just dont fall on me  
Go ahead on Mr Business man you cant dress like me  
Sing on Brother play on drummer
