Set my sails out on a sunny day  
Pretty soon i was on my way  
Though what for sure it was  
I could not say  
  
Two thousand reasons  
Maybe more  
Eight hundred chances on faraway shores  
Searching for something  
Searching for more  
Deep down inside me burning  
Reasons for the learning  
  
Now you can pick up reasons so easily  
Where youve been and where youve got to be  
And when the truth dont show youll always see  
Lots of reasons  
  
And pretty soon youve got a heavy load  
Dragging those reasons down an endless road  
I got to thinking and i got to see  
So many reasons coming at me  
  
The one that leaves you high and dry  
He says you still owe him theres a reason why  
Hell leave you crying till the tears run dry  
Hes the one always the one with all the reasons  
So many reasons the come and they go  
The reasons for them ill never know  
Ive seen so many theyve come and theyve gone  
Ive turned all mine in and im happy with one  
  
So dont talk of friendship do it to me  
Make me an offer and make it for free  
Dont give me reasons cause i wrote that song  
I only want love now so ill just take the one
