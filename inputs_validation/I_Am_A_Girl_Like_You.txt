Anneliese speaking  
Im savoring my first and last  
Taste of freedom before getting  
Married next week  
  
Erika speaking  
At least youre not an  
Indentured servant  
  
Anneliese speaking  
Indentured servant  
  
Erika  
If Id like to have my breakfast hot  
Madame Carp will make me pay  
And I have to fetch the eggs myself  
And the barns a mile away  
Its cold and wet  
But still I get an omelette on my plate  
But in my head Im back in bed  
Snuggled up and sleeping late  
  
Anneliese speaking  
Really  
  
Erika speaking  
Really But its all right  
I mean Im used to it  
And you  
  
Anneliese speaking  
Well  
  
Erika speaking  
Well  
Anneliese  
If I want some eggs I ring the bell  
And the maid comes running in  
And she serves them on a silver tray  
And she brings a cookie tin  
And while I eat she rubs my feet  
And strolling minstrels play  
But Id rather be in my library  
Reading science books all day  
  
Erika  
Im just like you  
Anneliese speaking  
you are  
Erika  
Youre just like me  
Theres somewhere else wed rather be  
Somewhere thats ours  
Somewhere that dreams come true  
Yes I am a girl like you  
Youd never think that it was so  
But now Ive met you and I know  
Its plain as day  
Sure as the sky is blue  
I am a girl like you  
  
Anneliese speaking  
So youre a singer  
  
Erika speaking  
No I work at Madame Carps penitentiary  
Uh I mean Dress Emporium  
  
Anneliese speaking  
I love Madame Carps dresses  
  
Erika speaking  
I made the one youre wearing  
  
Anneliese speaking  
You made this The design looks so complicated  
  
Erika speaking  
Oh it isnt really  
sings  
First I choose a fabric from the rack  
And I pin the pattern down  
And I stitch it in the front and back  
And it turns into a gown  
Anneliese  
I wear my gown  
Without my crown  
And dance around my room  
Both  
And imagine life without the strife  
Of an unfamiliar groom  
  
Anneliese speaking  
But Id never let my mother know  
I wouldnt want to disappoint her  
  
Erika speaking  
I completely understand  
  
Anneliese  
Im just like you  
Erika  
I think thats true  
Anneliese  
Youre just like me  
Erika  
Yes I can see  
Both  
We take responsibility  
Anneliese  
We carry through  
Erika  
We carry through  
Both  
Do what we need to go  
Yes I am a girl like you  
Anneliese  
Im just like you  
Erika  
Im just like you  
Anneliese  
Youre just like me  
Erika  
Youre just like me  
Both  
Its something anyone can see  
Anneliese  
A heart that beats  
Erika

Both  
A voice that speaks the truth  
Yes I am a girl like you
