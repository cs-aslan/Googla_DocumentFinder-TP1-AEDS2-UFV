I know this feeling inside  
Has just made up my mind  
Im gonna take this chance  
And do whats in my heart  
You always said that  
Youd stand by me  
And help me get along  
So understand  
I must do whats in my heart  
  
I know this feeling inside  
Has helped me to carry on  
So as the days go by  
And the nights that never end  
You play the clubs  
And you play the game  
The next day you will find  
Youll have to try and  
Please that fool again  
Dont you know that  
  
Fools play at games  
Dont you know that  
Fools play at games  
And I know that  
Im not afraid of you  
  
Day after day I feel this way  
That I need to be moving on  
You know I depend on you  
Dont get me wrong  
Ill throw the dice and  
I play the game  
And hope we get along  
Even then I wont be fooled again  
  
So Ive read your words and  
Ive signed my name  
But I cant make up my mind  
If you really care or youre  
Playing your games
