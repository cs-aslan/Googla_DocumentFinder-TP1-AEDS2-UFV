Oh  
Pretty baby  
This feeling i just cant hide  
You got me mystified  
  
Oh  
Pretty darling  
This feeling is deep inside  
You got me mystified  
  
The light that shines around you  
It blinds my eyes  
Theres a magic surrounds you  
Tell me where your secret lies  
  
Oh  
Pretty darling  
This feeling is deep inside  
You got me mystified  
  
Oh  
Pretty baby  
This feeling i just cant hide  
You got me mystified  
  
You got me mystified  
Mystified  
Mystified  
Mystified  
Mystified
