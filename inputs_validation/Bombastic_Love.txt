I am here to testify  
That youre the only one I belong to  
I dont know where to start  
It turned into an art  
Not to show the world that it was you  
Who made me realize not to compromise  
The fact that you and I should need  
Know were gonna get gonna get get  
  
Chorus  
Bombastic Love  
So fantastic  
Where Im completley yours and you are mine  
And Its gonna be exactly like in a movie  
When we fall in love for the first time  
  
Dont know why I feel so insecure  
I never understood what it stood for  
I gotta make sure that blidness wont stop me again  
I cant sit and wait anymore  
You made me realize not to compromise  
The fact that you and I should need  
I know were gonna get  
  
Chorus  
  
Its gonna be bombastic love  
Everything is gonna be alright  
When Im yours and you are mine  
Its gonna be fantastic love  
When I wake up everything is still the same  
And you dont even know my name  
  
Chorus  
  
I know were gonna get  
  
Chorus
