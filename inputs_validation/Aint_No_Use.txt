Aint no use baby  
Im leaving the scene  
Aint no use baby  
Youre too doggone mean  
  
Yes Im tired of paying dues  
Having the blues  
Hitting bad news  
Aint no use baby  
  
Aint no use baby  
Im leaving town  
Aint no use daddy  
Im putting you down  
  
Im gonna change my name  
Things wont be the same  
Cause Im tired of playing your game  
Aint no use baby I tell you aint no use  
  
I tried all these years Lord knows Ive tried  
Yes and I cried deep down inside  
But daddy why complain  
Its all over and youre to blame yeah yeah  
  
Aint no use baby  
Shed them tears  
Aint no use baby  
I cried for years for too many years  
  
You done had your fan  
  
Aint no use  
Aint no use  
Aint no use daddy  
Aint no use
