I still keep her memory around me  
I still hear her voice in my head  
The boxes of books  
That she never took  
And pictures that hang by the bed  
  
With so many promises broken  
Ill place all my dreams on the shell  
And give it my best  
To put her to rest  
Though I cant believe it myself  
  
Goodbye Maria I love you  
How long will you stay in my heart  
Ill try every day  
To get myself to say  
Goodbye Maria goodbye  
  
Ill try to forget how she loved me  
And hope that her memory will end  
But one love around  
My world starts tumbling down  
And here comes that feeling again  
  
Goodbye Maria I love you  
How long will you stay in my heart  
Ill try every day  
To get myself to say  
Goodbye Maria goodbye  
  
I never know why  
You had to leave me here  
Without a rime of reason left to try  
  
Goodbye Maria I love you  
How long will you stay in my heart  
Ill try every day  
To get myself to say  
Goodbye Maria goodbye
