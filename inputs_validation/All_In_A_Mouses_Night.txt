LOVING COUPLE  
I cant see you but I know youre there  
Got to get beside you cause its really cold out here  
Come up close to me youll soon be warm  
Hold me tightly like were sheltering from a storm  
  
MOUSE  
Think I might go out for a stroll  
Into the night and out of this hole  
Maybe find me a meal  
Walking along this new shag pile  
Presents a problem all the while  
Nearly the door  
  
Suddenly he bumps into wood the door is closed  
A voice from the bed hell be exposed  
Which way to run must make for the hole  
But the lights been turned on now hes blind as a mole in coal  
  
Now I can see theyre coming at me  
Theyve blocked off my door I havent a chance in hell  
  
COUPLE  
Come on baby let the poor thing go  
Im not sleeping with that thing around here no  
Alright then Ill fetch a box from below  
Guard him carefully theyre very quick you know  
  
MOUSE  
The doors been opened my chance to escape  
Must run out quick better sorry than late  
Im out on the stairs  
They wont catch me now Ive the run of the house now  
Ill make it downstairs and into the bread bin  
That would be nice  
  
Suddenly he bumps into fur thats very unwise  
A cat is much quicker than men and their eyes  
The chase that ensues can have only one end  
Unless outside help steps in for our friend in need  
  
But now the cat comes in for the kill  
His paw is raised soon blood will spill yes it will  
  
CAT  
Hard luck mouse this is the end of your road  
The signpost says inside me let me bear your heavy load  
But its not to be that final pounce  
Knocks a jar upon his head and lays him out  
  
But its all in a mouses night  
To take on all those who would fight  
  
CATS STORY  
There I was with my back to the wall  
Then comes this monster mouse hes ten feet tall  
With teeth and claws to match  
It only took one blow
