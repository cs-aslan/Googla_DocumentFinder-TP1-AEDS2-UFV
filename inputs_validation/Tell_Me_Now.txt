Three days of spirits  
Tell me now  
Im here like a spell  
Thats bearing me to drive  
  
Tell me now  
That there are three days in a week  
Tell me now  
To make it so  
Make it so I cant speak  
Make it so I cant speak  
Well Im here like a spell  
Thats bearing me to drive  
  
Eyes of blue  
Sea of red  
Take me to  
Where Ive never been dead  
Where Ive never been dead  
Hey its between myself and me  
Its a very lonely place  
Between myself  
Its lonely  
Between myself  
Its a lonely  
Place  
Crimson red  
Yourself  
Back up to me
