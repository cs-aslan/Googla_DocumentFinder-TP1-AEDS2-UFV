Five oclock in the morning  
You aint home  
I cant help thinking thats strange  
Baby I just want you to know  
I wont go through it again  
Yes those clouds are closing in  
  
And I will not accept this as a part of my life  
I will not live in fear  
Of what may be  
And the lessons I have learned  
I would rather be alone than watch you  
Spinning that wheel for me  
  
Youve got a thing about danger  
Aint you getting what you want from me  
Youve got a thing about strangers  
Baby thats what we used to be  
Youve got a thing about danger baby  
I guess the hungry just cant see  
One of these days  
Youre gonna bring some home to me  
  
Six oclock in the morning  
You aint home  
I cant help thinking thats strange  
It seems that everybody takes their chances  
These days  
Oh yeah were standing in the rain  
  
And I will not accept this as part of my life  
  
How can you love me  
When you are playing with my life  
You say give me time and Ill do better I swear  
Give me time and Ill lead you back to despair  
And I dont want to go back there
