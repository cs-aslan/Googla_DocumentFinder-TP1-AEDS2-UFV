Some people tell you  
Theyre trapped in the distance  
And cant get what  
They want most  
They throw a wall  
And then call for assistance  
And make no attempt to get close  
Oh I think you should know  
Youve got to go slow  
Below the surface  
And easy through the waves  
Slow below the surface  
And easy through the waves  
Youre running so fast  
That you cant find the past  
And your future is wearing thin  
Come from behind  
Its a matter of time  
Til you see where youve always been  
Oh I think you should know  
Youve got to go slow  
Below the surface  
And easy through the waves  
Slow below the surface  
And easy through the waves  
Some people tell you theyre in trapped in the distance  
And cant get what they want most  
They throw up a wall and then  
Call for assistance  
And make no attempt to get close  
Oh I think you should know  
Youve got to go slow  
Below the surface  
And easy through the waves  
Slow below the surface  
And easy through the waves  
You know that your  
Life must have a purpose  
You better make a stand  
While you still can
