I had all but given up  
On finding the one that I could fall into  
On the day before you  
  
There was no such thing as a dream come true  
Oh but that was on the day before you  
  
Now youre here and everythings changing  
Suddenly life means so much  
I cant wait to wake up tomorrow  
And find out this promise is true  
I will never have to go back to  
The day before you  
  
In your eyes I see forever  
It makes me wish that my life never knew  
The day before you  
Oh but Heaven knows those years without you  
  
Were shapin my heart for the day that I found you  
Youre the reason for all that Ive been through  
Then Im thankful for the day before you  
Yeah yeah  
  
Now youre here and everythings changing  
Suddenly life means so much  
I cant wait to wake up tomorrow  
And find out this promise is true  
I will never have to go back to  
The day before you  
  
Was the last day that I ever lived alone  
And Im never goin back  
No Im never goin back  
  
Now youre here and everythings changing  
Suddenly life means so much  
I cant wait to wake up tomorrow  
And find out this promise is true  
I will never have to go back to  
Yeah I will never have to go back to  
The day before you the day before you
