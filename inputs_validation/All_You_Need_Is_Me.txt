You hiss and groan  
And you constantly moan  
But you dont ever go away  
And thats because all you need is me  
  
You roll your eyes  
Up to the skies  
Mock horrified  
But youre still here  
All you need is me  
  
Theres so much destruction  
All over the world  
And all you can do is complain about me  
  
You bang your head against the wall  
And say youre sick of it all  
Yet you remain  
Cause all you need is me  
  
And then you offer your one and only joke  
And ask me What will I be  
When I grow up to be a man  
  
Me Nothing  
  
Theres a soft voice  
Singing in your head  
Who can this be  
I do believe its me  
  
Theres a naked man standing  
Laughing in your dreams  
You know who it is  
But you dont like what it means  
  
Theres so much destruction  
All over the world  
And all you can do is complain about me  
  
I was a small fat child in a welfare house  
There was only one thing I ever dreamed about  
Fate has just handed it to me  
  
Whoopee  
  
You dont like me but you love me  
Either way youre wrong  
Youre gonna miss me when Im gone  
Youre gonna miss me when Im gone  
  
You dont like me but you love me  
Either way youre wrong  
Youre gonna miss me when Im gone  
Youre gonna miss me when Im gone
