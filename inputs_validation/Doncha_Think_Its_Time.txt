Ive been yearning for a little romance  
I want to know when you gonna give me a chance  
Kiss me honey tell me your mine  
Doncha think its time  
  
Ive been yearning for a sweet embrace  
Rub my hair till Im a total disgrace  
Kiss me honey make my life divine  
Doncha think its time  
  
I dont want to walk without you  
Walkin right by my side  
It hurts me to see you talkin  
With the other guys  
  
I get so warm when you touch my cheek  
You thrill me so much that I can hardly speak  
Love me honey tell me youre mine  
Doncha think its time  
  
I dont want to walk without you  
Walkin right by my side  
It hurts me to see you talkin  
With the other guys  
  
I get so warm when you touch my cheek  
You thrill me so much that I can hardly speak  
Love me honey tell me youre mine  
  
Doncha think its time  
Doncha think its time  
Doncha think its time  
Doncha think its time
