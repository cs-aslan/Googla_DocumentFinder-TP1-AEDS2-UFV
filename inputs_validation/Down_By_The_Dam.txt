Ambush on her body down by the dam  
She wasnt afraid of anybody until down by the dam  
  
Criminal running from the law  
Hiding in the high grass  
The lady saw death from a mescaline high  
High in the high grass  
And the police aint never around  
When you need them  
But the criminals ready to pounce  
If you get near him  
  
Vigilante fires the flames are gettin higher  
Down by the dam  
Tempers gettin hot oh theres blood for the pot  
Down by the dam
