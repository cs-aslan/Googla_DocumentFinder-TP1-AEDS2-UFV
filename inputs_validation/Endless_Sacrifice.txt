Cold  
Lying in my bed  
Staring into darkness  
  
Lost  
I hear footsteps overhead  
And my thoughts return  
Again  
  
Like a child whos run away  
And wont be coming back  
Time keeps passing by  
As night turns into day  
  
Im so far away  
And so alone  
I need to see your face  
To keep me sane  
To make we whole  
  
Try to stay alive  
Until I hear your voice  
Im gonna lose my mind  
Someone tell me why  
I chose this life  
This superficial lie  
Constant compromise  
Endless sacrifice  
  
Pain  
It saddens me to know  
The helplessness you feel  
Your light  
Shines on my soul  
While a thousand candles  
Burn  
  
Outside this barren room  
The rain is pouring down  
The emptiness inside  
Is growing deeper still  
  
Youre so far away  
And so alone  
You long for loves embrace  
To keep you sane  
To make you whole  
  
Try to stay alive  
Until I hear your voice  
Im gonna lose my mind  
  
Someone tell me why  
I chose this life  
This superficial lie  
Constant compromise  
Endless sacrifice  
  
Moments wasted  
Isolated  
Time escaping  
Endless sacrifice  
  
Moments wasted  
Isolated  
Time escaping  
Endless sacrifice  
  
Over the distance  
We try to make sense  
Of surviving together  
While living apart  
  
Striving for balance  
We rise to the challenge  
Of staying connected  
In spite of circumstance  
  
All youve forsaken  
And all that youve done  
So that I could live out  
This undying dream  
  
Wont be forgotten  
Or taken for granted  
Ill always remember  
Your endless sacrifice  
  
Moments wasted  
Isolated  
Time escaping  
Endless sacrifice  
  
Moments wasted  
Isolated  
Time escaping  
Endless sacrifice
