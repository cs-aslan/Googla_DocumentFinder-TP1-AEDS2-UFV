And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
Ill hold on hold on  
  
I keep listening to my chest for a beat but theres nothing left  
Its been a week since Ive seen you and I still cant believe it  
Cause Im dying inside alone  
  
And in every dream we gotta be apart  
Im like a baby with a broken heart  
But the second that I see you  
You will know how much I need you  
Because Ill never be letting you go  
  
Now you know why  
Im lost without you  
And theres nothing I can do  
Your the one that I cant go without  
And by holding onto you then Ill be holding on forever  
  
Ive got you now and Im not letting go of you  
Never been together long enough  
Because every moment Im with you its like Im holding onto heaven  
  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
Ill hold on hold on  
  
In a symphony baby you would be my melody  
And you would flow like a river slowing going on forever  
Like a feather thats blowing away  
Like everyone that needs a fairytale like every mothers love that never
fails  
Like every game that needs a player and a sinner needs a savior  
Im the villain that your willing to save  
  
Now you know why  
Im lost without you  
And theres nothing I can do  
Your the one that I cant go without  
And by holding onto you then Ill be holding on forever  
  
Ive for you now and Im not letting go of you  
Never been together long enough  
Because every moment Im with you its like Im holding onto heaven  
  
Im willing to wait just to see you another day  
What Im waiting for will wash this pain away  
And its never too late  
  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
Ill hold on hold on  
  
Now you know why  
Im lost without you  
And theres nothing I can do  
Your the one that I cant go without  
And by holding onto you then Ill be holding on forever  
  
Ive got you now and Im not letting go of you  
Never been together long enough  
Cause every moment Im with you its like Im holding onto heaven  
Cause every moment Im with you its like Im holding onto heaven
