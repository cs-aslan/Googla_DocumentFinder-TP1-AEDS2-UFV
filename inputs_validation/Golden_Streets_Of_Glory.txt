Dolly Parton  
Glory to His name oh holy holy  
Theres a city where the streets are paved in gold  
A land where the milk and the honey flow  
And a mansion which for me  
Cause my bible tells the story  
I just hope my feet are clean enough  
To walk upon the golden streets of glory  
Green meadows where the little children play  
No sorrow there just one long happy day  
And none will litter there except the pure and the holy  
I just hope my feet are clean enough  
To walk upon the golden streets of glory  
And when Ive reached my journeys end  
And if Im worthy to go in  
Golden streets of glory I walk on  
And the golden streets of my new home  
Will lead me up to the masters throne  
With the angel band Ill sing  
Glory to His name oh holy holy  
I just hope my feet are clean enough  
To walk upon the golden streets of glory  
Hallelujah I just hope my feet are clean enough  
To walk upon the golden streets of glory  
And when Ive reached my journeys end  
And if Im worthy to go in  
Golden streets of glory Ill walk on  
And the golden streets of my new home  
Will lead me up to the masters throne  
With the angel band Ill sing  
Glory to His name oh holy holy  
I just hope my feet are clean enough  
To walk upon the golden streets of glory  
Hallelujah I just hope my feet are clean enough  
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
