She owes me everything and she knows it  
Ive seen all of the scenes in this movie  
And she blows it at the end  
She keeps talking to me  
Cause she knows that Im a friend  
But I cant keep hearing it over and over again  
I was the one that you came to  
When you broke up with your boyfriend  
Man fuck him  
Girl I was the one that told you fuck them other niggas  
And you still with fuck them other niggas  
Most people learn from the bad things  
I hope that you learn  
And dont crash and burn in the fast lane  
But if you read this letter then you caught me  
This should explain all the ways that you taught me  
  
How to hate a bitch  
That owe you everything  
At least a wedding ring  
Moving on to better things  
So dont you call me talking bout them other fools  
Im not good enough for you  
I thought that we was cool  
If you need a shoulder to cry on girl I wont listen  
Im through fucking with these bitch ass bitches  
  
And I dont love them hoes  
Dont fuck up with Wayne cause when it Waynes it pours  
No really Im on my fuck that bitch shit  
You used to be the shit but now you aint shit bitch  
I had a red bone but she be tripping though  
All that bullshit is for the birds she was pigeontoed  
She used to always say fuck my niggas  
And when I went to jail she fucked my niggas  
Well I guess Im single for the night  
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night  
And if I sound mad then you caught me  
But this shit explains that youre the one that taught me  
  
How to hate a bitch  
That owe you everything  
At least a wedding ring  
Moving on to better things  
So dont you call me talking bout them other fools  
Im not good enough for you  
I thought that we was cool  
If you need a shoulder to cry on girl I wont listen  
Im through fucking with these bitch ass bitches  
  
Coke in the Ciroc  
Forgive and forget bitch I already forgot  
Im over the bitch and she over the top  
They say love is the key somebody changed the lock well  
And I wish I never met ya  
And I heard youre doing you and you heard Im doing better  
And all I had to do was put two and two together  
But that just makes four but not fourever damn  
So much for being the perfect couple  
I put in overtime I was working doubles  
I wish you the best good luck boo  
Weezy F for fuck you  
  
No aint nothing going on  
Girl Im moving on just take your ass home  
Get away from here girl Im so glad youre gone  
This is the last song Im writing for you  
Now I see how you can be  
I dont want you round me  
All you do is down me girl  
How many years I tried to get ya  
Dont even text my phone when it hit ya  
Cause girl you done taught me  
  
How to hate a bitch  
That owe you everything  
At least a wedding ring  
Moving on to better things  
So dont you call me talking bout them other fools  
Im not good enough for you  
I thought that we was cool  
If you need a shoulder to cry on girl I wont listen  
Im through fucking with these bitch ass bitches
