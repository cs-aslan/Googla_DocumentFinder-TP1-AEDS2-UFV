Now excuse if I sound rude  
But I love the way that you move  
And I see me all over you now  
Baby when I look in your eyes  
Theres no way that I can disguise  
All these crazy thoughts in my mind now  
Theres just something about you got the lock  
I got the key  
You know the rest  
You know just where I wanna be  
Dont ever stop controlling me  
I kinda like it when you bring me to my knees  
  
You got me wrapped up  
Around your finger  
Id do anything for your love now  
And when you touch it the feeling lingers  
Takes me up so I high I cant come down  
You got me wrapped up baby  
  
I dont ever wanna give up  
All this spell you got me under  
I see fireworks when we touch now  
Theres just something about you  
Your body fits on mine like a glove  
Let them say whatever they want  
Its too late cause youre in my blood now  
You got the lock  
I got the key  
You know the rest  
You know just where I wanna be  
Dont ever stop controlling me  
I kinda like it when you bring me to my knees  
  
You got me wrapped up  
Around your finger  
Id do anything for your love now  
And when you touch it the feeling lingers  
Takes me up so I high I cant come down  
Girl You got me wrapped up  
You got me so so wrapped up  
Theres just something about you wrapped up  
You got me so so wrapped up  
Theres just something about you

Yeah but heres the only issue since we met  
You kinda turned my world upside down  
And I dont really mind spiderman kissing you  
As long as youre planning on sticking around  
The happiest boy in the world award goes to me  
Not a chance nobody came close to em  
I kinda knew you was troublesome  
You got me wrapped around your finger like bubblegum  
  
Everything that you do  
Every way that you move  
Theres just something about you  
Theres just something about you  
Everything that you do  
Every way that you move  
Theres just something about you

And when you touch it the feeling lingers  
Takes me up so I high I cant come down
