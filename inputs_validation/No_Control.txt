Verse 1 Niall Horan  
Stained coffee cup  
Just a fingerprint of lipsticks not enough  
  
Verse 2 Harry Styles  
Sweet where you lay  
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case  
  
Chorus Louis Tomlinson  
Waking up beside you Im a loaded gun  
I cant contain this anymore  
Im all yours Ive got no control no control  
Powerless and I dont care its obvious  
I just cant get enough of you  
The pedals down my eyes are closed  
No control  
  
Verse 3 Liam Payne  
Taste on my tongue  
I dont want to wash away the night before  
  
Verse 4 Harry Styles  
In the heat where you lay  
I could stay right here and burn in it all day  
  
Chorus Louis Tomlinson  
Waking up beside you Im a loaded gun  
I cant contain this anymore  
Im all yours Ive got no control no control  
Powerless and I dont care its obvious  
I just cant get enough of you  
The pedals down my eyes are closed  
No control  
  
Bridge Zayn Malik  
Lost my senses Im defenseless  
Her perfumes holding me ransom  
Sweet and sour heart devoured  
Lying here I count the hours  
  
Chorus x2  
Waking up beside you Im a loaded gun  
I cant contain this anymore  
Im all yours Ive got no control no control  
Powerless and I dont care its obvious  
I just cant get enough of you  
The pedals down my eyes are closed  
No control
