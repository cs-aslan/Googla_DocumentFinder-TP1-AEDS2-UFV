I cant remember when  
He looked at me and cried  
Said something broke inside of you  
Were my best friend  
Whatever come our way  
You know Im your gal till the eeend  
  
When I finally go away  
I know youll look for me one day  
  
When you let love down  
Oh you let love down  
I dont have to remind you  
But you know that Im around  
When you let love down  
Oh you let me down  
Get a little love down  
Let it down oh oh  
  
I cant remember when  
You put your hands on mine  
But couldnt play in time when we  
Were not together  
Just sing a little song  
Blueberry kisses foreveeer  
  
When I finally go away  
I know youll look for me one day  
  
Oh yeah its so sad  
  
When you let love down  
Oh you let love down  
I dont have to remind you  
But you know that Im around  
When you let love down  
Oh you let me down  
Get a little love down  
Let it down oh oh  
  
Oh oh  
Dont let me down  
Oh dont let me down  
Oh oh  
  
When you let love down  
Oh you let love down  
I dont have to remind you  
But you know that Im around  
When you let love down  
Oh you let me down  
Dont let me down  
Let it down  
Cant let love down  
Let it down  
Wont let love down  
Let it down
