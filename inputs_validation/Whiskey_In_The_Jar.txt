As I was goin over the Cork and Kerry mountains  
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin  
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier  
I said stand oer and deliver or the devil he may take ya  
  
Musha ring dumb a do dumb a da  
Whack for my daddyo  
Whack for my daddyo  
Theres whiskey in the jaro  
  
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny  
I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly  
She swore that shed love me never would she leave me  
But the devil take that woman for you know she tricked me easy  
  
Musha ring dumb a do dumb a da  
Whack for my daddyo  
Whack for my daddyo  
Theres whiskey in the jaro  
  
Being drunk and weary I went to Mollys chamber  
Takin my money with me and I never knew the danger  
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell  
I jumped up fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels  
  
Musha ring dumb a do dumb a da  
Whack for my daddyo  
Whack for my daddyo  
Theres whiskey in the jaro  
  
Now some men like the fishin and some men like the fowlin  
And some men like ta hear a cannon ball a roarin  
Me I like sleepin specially in my Mollys chamber  
But here I am in prison here I am with a ball and chain yeah  
  
Musha ring dumb a do dumb a da  
Whack for my daddyo  
Whack for my daddyo  
Theres whiskey in the jaro  
  
And I got drunk on whiskeyo  
And I love I love I love I love I love I love my Mollyo
