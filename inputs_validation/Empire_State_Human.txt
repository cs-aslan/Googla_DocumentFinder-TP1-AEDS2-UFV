Since I was very young I realized  
I never wanted to be human size  
So I avoid the crowds and traffic jams  
They just remind me of how small I am  
Because of this longing in my heart  
Im going to start the growing up  
Im going to grow now and never stop  
Think like a mountain grow to the top  
  
Tall tall tall I want to be tall tall tall  
As big as a wall wall wall as big as a wall wall wall  
And if Im not tall tall tall then I will grow grow grow  
Because Im not tall tall tall tall tall tall tall tall  
Tall tall tall I want to be tall tall tall  
As big as a wall wall wall as big as a wall wall wall  
And if Im not tall tall tall then I will grow grow grow  
Because Im not tall tall tall tall tall tall tall tall  
  
With concentration  
My size increased  
And now Im fourteen stories high  
At least  
Empire state human  
Just a bored kid  
Ill go to Egypt to be  
A pyramid  
  
Tall tall tall I want to be tall tall tall  
As big as a wall wall wall as big as a wall wall wall  
And if Im not tall tall tall then I will grow grow grow  
Because Im not tall tall tall tall tall tall tall tall  
Tall tall tall I want to be tall tall tall  
As big as a wall wall wall as big as a wall wall wall  
And if Im not tall tall tall then I will grow grow grow  
Because Im not tall tall tall tall tall tall tall tall  
  
Brick by brick  
Stone by stone  
Growing till hes fully grown  
Brick by brick  
Stone by stone  
Growing till hes fully grown  
  
Fetch more water  
Fetch more sand  
Biggest person in the land  
Fetch more water  
Fetch more sand  
Biggest person in the land
