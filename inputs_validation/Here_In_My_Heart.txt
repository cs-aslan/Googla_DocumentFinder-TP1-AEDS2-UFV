If Id have been all you ever wanted  
I wonder how much better Id be  
And I know you think its over  
Cause youre so far away  
But darlin youre still here with me  
  
And I will hold you always  
No matter how far were apart  
You could be anywhere in the world tonight  
But Id still have you here in my heart  
  
I dont try to forget you dont cry over regrets  
And I always know right where you are  
So Ill be happy just to hold you  
Here in my heart  
Till I have you back in my arms  
  
And I will hold you always  
No matter how far were apart  
You could be anywhere in the world tonight  
And Id still have you here in my heart  
Darlin you could be anywhere in the world tonight  
And Id still have you here in my heart
