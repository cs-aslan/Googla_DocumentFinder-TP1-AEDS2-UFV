Ive seen you I saw you I see you  
Without little notice if any at all  
Of you knowing me watchin you  
You walking you talking you smiling  
You styling in everything your body wears  
And thats not just a point of view  
Theyre painting theyre ranting theyre raving  
About Miss Lovely got it going on  
From head down to her toes  
And no one knows better than I know  
Cause Ive been listening to the spirit of  
Your body mind and soul  
  
Its a sensuous whisper  
That makes my body weak  
Its that sensuous whisper  
Thats sweeter than the sweetest sweet  
Its that sensuous whisper  
That makes my psyche say  
Ooh we ooh wee ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we  
  
Can feel you can smell you can taste you  
Though my senses never had the pleasure of  
That lovely wonderment  
But I start to shaking I shiver to think that little sparkle in your eye  
Means you are giving me some kind of hint  
Im ready Im willing Im able  
In fact those words are at the tip of my tongue  
Eagerly waiting for me to say  
Then you smile and whisper how are you  
But when I move my lips and try to speak the words just go away  
  
Its a sensuous whisper  
That makes my body weak  
Its that sensuous whisper  
Thats sweeter than the sweetest sweet  
Its that sensuous whisper  
That makes my psyche say  
Ooh wee ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we  
  
Its that sensuous whisper thats got me trippin out  
Its that sensuous whisper  
That I dont want to do without  
Its that sensuous whisper  
That makes me want to shout  
Ooh we ooh wee ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we  
  
I dont even care how long it takes  
As long as I have you lying next to me  
Cause to wait forever and a day  
Is a small price to pay if its you Im getting  
If its you Im getting Im not quitting  
And that is how Im living  
  
Im clinging not dreaming but scheming  
With my nose against the grind and both my eyes focused upon the prize  
I think it I trust it I know it  
Your love that Ive longed for is gonna be mine  
Good things do come in time  
Im right on the rhythm youre givin  
But this is more than giving up some casual mental telepathy  
The music the candles the champagne and all thats needed  
Is one thing to give it authenticity  
  
Its a sensuous whisper  
That makes my body weak  
Its that sensuous whisper  
Thats sweeter than the sweetest sweet  
Its that sensuous whisper  
That makes my psyche say  
Ooh wee ooh wee ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we  
  
Its that sensuous whisper  
Thats got me trippin out  
Its that sensuous whisper  
That I dont want to do without  
Its that sensuous whisper  
That makes me want to shout  
Ooh we ooh wee ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we  
  
Its a sensuous whisper  
That makes my body rock  
Its that sensuous whisper  
That makes me beg baby dont ever stop  
Its that sensuous whisper  
That always get me hot baby  
Ooh wee ooh wee ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we  
  
Its that sensuous whisper  
That makes me feel alright  
Its that sensuous whisper  
That keep me wanting you morning noon and every single night  
Its that sensuous whisper  
Dont want you out of my sight baby  
Ooh we ooh wee ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we ooh we  
  
Its that sensuous whisper
