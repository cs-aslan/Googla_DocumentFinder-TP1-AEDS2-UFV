Its the sad eyed goodbye  
Yesterdays moments I remember  
Its the bleak streetweek kneed partings I recall  
Its the mistier mists the hazier days  
The brighter sun and the easier lays  
Theres all the more reason for laughing and crying  
When youre younger and life isnt to hard at all  
  
Its the fantastic drowse  
Of the afternoon Sundays  
That bored you to rages of tears  
The unending pleadings  
To waste all your good times  
In thoughts of your middleaged years  
Its the vertical hold all the things that youre told  
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero  
And theres all the more reason  
For living or dying when youre young  
And your troubles are all very small  
  
Out here on the street wed gather and meet  
And scuff up the sidewalk  
With endlessly restless feet  
Half on the time wed broaden our minds  
More in the pool hall  
Than we did in the school hall  
With the down town chewing gum bums  
Watching the night life the lights and the fun  
  
Never wanted to be the boy next door  
Always thought Id be something more  
But it aint easy for a small town boy  
It aint easy at all  
Thinkin it right and doin it wrong  
Its easier from an arm chair  
Waves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness  
Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess  
  
I think Ill be Clint Eastwood  
Jimi Hendrix he was good  
Lets try William the Conqueror  
Now who else do I like
