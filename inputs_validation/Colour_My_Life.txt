If youre wondering why Ive not been speaking my mind sir  
It took so long since I could call this my home  
My shapes of confusion fit holes of frustration  
And theres nothing worse then being home on your own  
  
You can colour my life  
Until it fits with your own  
You can colour my life  
Until it fits with your own  
  
Ive been wondering why youve not been speaking your mind sir  
Ive coloured my life and Ill make no bones  
My shapes of confusion fit holes of frustration  
You can colour my life until it fits with your own  
  
You can colour my life  
Until it fits with your own  
You can colour my life  
Until it fits with your own  
You can colour my life  
Until it fits with your own  
You can colour my life  
You can colour my life
