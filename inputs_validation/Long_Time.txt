Girl Me and the Lods been friends for a mighty long time  
such a mighty long time such a mighty long time  
And girl the thought of leavin you has never crossed my mind  
Well oh oh  
  
Up in the street and misguided never payed attention  
So I got my soul devine players soul decided  
to let my soul confide with the lights of him  
Who the father my bread and my water  
I never bought a cue and into this   
Down in my world are you going let you hypocrites  
Itll take your life to be a Christian man  
I hope you learn everything else  
Is in vein so youre bound to burn  
Gonna break your bone  
Im in a war dont let this life game overrule  
Trying take control of you  
Thats all the devil do  
God was in Jesus God is in us  
But God aint in the barrel of that pistol that you bust  
You can play this game wrong you gotta take it how it goes  
Is there ever a feeling for living if the bodys gone  
I never understood why what can make a man cry  
It can make a man strong when nobodys on his side  
  
Girl girl Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time  
such a mighty long time such a mighty long time  
And girl the thought of leavin you has never crossed my mind  
Never crossed my mind never crossed my mind oooh  
Well oh oh  
  
Back and forth night and day you repeat the same scene  
Standing at the pool a bit time to repent again  
Mostly men have a gun just put that down on circle purpose  
When the poo of the world got me standin by the circle  
Agitate you yes it does this is what you though was love  
Only name same to be lust mixed emotions make you want to bust  
Mamma tryin children cryin dad outta work welfare lying  
Prejudice always see the bottom of the barrel  
Falling down on my knees heavenly father here we go on knowing  
That we get to heaven theres gonna be some open arms  
Judgment was manmade not a  and this I recorded  
But I didnt live the party but I thank that my heart beat  
Gotta make me oh sure Jesus I dont know if theres a hell  
But I know Ive whitnessed hell here all I do is dwell here  
Trying not to trail here saying too much will get you knocked off or locked
up in jail here  
Tell me do you smell fear knowing that we so near  
Trying to take the voices of the truth out the youth ear  
And if you late a time frame you play all kind of mind games  
I aint put my life on the line for a damn thing  
  
Girl Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time  
such a mighty long time such a mighty long time  
And Girl I dont really want to be without you the thought of leavin you
has never crossed my mind  
Never crossed my mind  
Well oh oh  
  
I can never make it I can never ever make it  
Without you baby  
Cause youve been my best friend  
Girl  
When everybody turned their back on me  
You were there when I fell down on my knees  
And I give you all all of me  
And every part of me oooowoooo  
  
Girl me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time  
For long time such a mighty long time  
And girl I dont really want to be without you the thought of leavin you
has never crossed my mind  
Never crossed my mind  
Well oh oh  
  
Im a live I will never leave o no no  
When the people say cmon and go with me  
Cause I will never leave you and youve been my best friend  
nobody understand but they cant look inside of me  
o yeah
