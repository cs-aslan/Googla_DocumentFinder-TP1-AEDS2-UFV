The convoy lights are dead ahead  
The merchantmen lay in their bed  
The thump of diesels hammers down  
In the oily seathe killing ground  
His knuckles white his eyes alight  
He slams the hatch on the deadly night  
A cunning fox in the chickens lair  
A hound of hell and the devil dont care  
  
Chorus  
Running silent running deep we are your final prayer  
Warriors in secret sleep a merchantmans nightmare  
A silent death lies awaiting for all of you below  
Running silent running deep sink into your silent sleep  
  
Chill the hearts of fighting men  
In open ocean wondering when  
The lethal silver fish will fly  
The boat will shivermen will die  
A cast of millionsa part to play  
Killer victim or fool for a day  
Obeying an ordermen have to die  
Us or thema well rehearsed lie  
  
Chorus  
  
The lifeboats shattered the hull is torn  
The tar black smell of burning oil  
On the way down to Davy Jones  
Every man for himselfyoure on your own  
The wolf eyes watch the cross wire  
stern tubes ready aim and fire
