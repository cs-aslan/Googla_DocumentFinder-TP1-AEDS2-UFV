Holy father drink the fire water  
Preaching peace as you go to war  
Politicians making brave decisions  
Always got self interest at heart  
  
We are to you just a drop in the ocean  
Maybe thats true but its only a notion  
You integrate with a friendly intrusion  
We wont get fooled we have come to conclusion  
  
Subterfuge deludes the views of you and me  
Were confused but still we choose to disagree  
Subterfuge consumes us but defiantly  
We refuse to bow down to conformity  
  
Evil mothers hiding under covers  
Always near but just out of sight  
  
Hey big brother watch as we recover  
Cause well never give up the fight  
And we say no  
  
Give us a name and you give us the power  
Watch as we gather our strength by the hour  
You think were blind and weak in decision  
But we see it all from peripheral vision  
  
Subterfuge deludes the views of you and me  
Were confused but still we choose to disagree  
Subterfuge consumes us but defiantly  
We refuse to bow down to conformity  
  
Somebody wins somebody lose  
Some call it subterfuge  
Somebody wins somebody lose  
They fall to subterfuge  
  
Subterfuge deludes the views of you and me  
Were confused but still we choose to disagree  
Subterfuge consumes us but defiantly  
We refuse to bow down to conformity  
  
Somebody wins somebody lose  
Some call it subterfuge  
Somebody wins somebody lose  
They fall to subterfuge
