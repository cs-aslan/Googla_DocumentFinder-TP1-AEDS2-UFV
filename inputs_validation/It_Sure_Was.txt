They said what do you think you would do  
If she told you that shed been untrue   
Id say i wont say I wont be sorry no  
It sure was love while it lasted   
  
They said how will you feel deep inside  
When the love you believed in has died   
I aint sayin it wont hurt me  
It sure was love while it lasted  
  
Ill be livin off of the good times  
That youve given me to face  
I have had my share of the sunshine  
I can stand a little rain  
  
So we dont give a damn what they say  
Weve go something they cant take away  
cause whatever comes tomorrow  
It sure was love while it lasted  
  
It sure was good while it lasted  
It sure was love while it lasted
