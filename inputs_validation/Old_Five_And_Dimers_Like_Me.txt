Ive spent the lifetime making up my mind to be  
More than the measure of what I thought others could see  
Good luck and fast bucks theyre too few and too far between  
Theres catalog buyers and old five and dimers like me  
She stood beside me letting me know she would be  
Something to lean on when everything ran out on me  
Well fenced yards aint hole cards and like is not ever will be  
The reason for rhymers and old five and dimers like me  
  
Well its taking me so long now that I know I believe  
All that I do or say is all I ever will be  
Too far and too high and too deep aint too much to see  
Too much aint enough for old five and dimers like me  
An old five and dimer is all I intended to be  
You know country people dont shine their boots very often  
And they dont shine other folks boots either thank you
