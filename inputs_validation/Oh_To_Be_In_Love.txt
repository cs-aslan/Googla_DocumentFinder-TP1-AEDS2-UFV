As the light hits you as you shift along the floor  
I find it hard to place my face  
Ow did I come to be here anyway  
Its terribly vague whats gone before  
  
I could have been anyone  
You could have been anyones dream  
Why did you have to choose our moment  
Why did you have to make me feel that  
Why did you make it so unreal  
  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
  
All the colors look brighter now  
Everything they say seems to sound new  
Slipping into tomorrow too quick  
Yesterday always too good to forget  
Stop the swing of the pendulum  
Let us through  
  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again
