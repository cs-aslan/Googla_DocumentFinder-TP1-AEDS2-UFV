Oh you sad one  
Playing the Angel  
Isnt so easy where youre from  
  
Oh you wild one  
Devils companion  
You wont stay satisfied for long  
  
Chorus  
I dont want you to change anything you do  
I dont want you to be someone else for me  
  
Oh you dark one  
Eternal outsider  
Caught in the spiders web youve spun  
  
Oh you blind one  
Gentle and kind one  
Seeing the world as a loaded gun  
  
Chorus  
  
Stay as you are the Darkest Star  
Shining for me  
Majestically  
  
Chorus
