I got my eyes on you  
Youre everything that I see  
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly  
I cant get over you  
You left your mark on me  
I want your high love and emotion endlessly  
Cause youre a good girl and you know it  
You act so different around me  
Cause youre a good girl and you know it  
I know exactly who you could be  
  
Just hold on were going home

Its hard to do these things alone  
Just hold on were going home ho oh
