Verse 1  
Used to roll in perfect motion easy  
Lips like Tanqueray  
Tropical sunrises never sleeping  
I dont know what changed  
All I want to do is feel the rhythm of the night  
Youve been running from the dark  
You cant look me in the eyes  
Being called into the heat  
Even if its burning me  
I just need to dance without you  
  
Chorus  
We cant move to this  
We cant even talk boy  
We dont even kiss  
It never works  
We cant move to this  
We cant even talk boy  
We dont even kiss  
Youre not in love  
We cant move to this  
We cant even talk boy  
We dont even kiss  
It never works  
We cant move to this  
We cant even talk boy  
We dont even kiss  
  
Verse 2  
Through the streets and all the places Ive been  
I can see we never had harmony  
I wont go even though Im alone and I know I want out  
I go up without you bringing me down  
Such a rush  
So now Im staying to dance on my own  
On my own  
And all I know is  
  
Chorus  
We cant move to this  
We cant even talk boy  
We dont even kiss  
It never works  
We cant move to this  
We cant even talk boy  
We dont even kiss  
Youre not in love  
We cant move to this  
We cant even talk boy  
We dont even kiss  
It never works  
We cant move to this  
We cant even talk boy  
We dont even kiss  
Youre not in love  
  
Bridge  
Now Im giving you up tonight  
Now Im giving you up tonight  
And Im dancing on my own because  
We cant move together  
Now Im giving you up tonight  
Now Im giving you up tonight  
And Im dancing on my own because  
We cant move together  
Now Im giving you up tonight  
Now Im giving you up tonight  
And Im dancing on my own because  
We cant move together  
Now Im giving you up tonight  
Now Im giving you up tonight  
And Im dancing on my own because  
We cant move to  
  
Chorus  
We cant move to this  
We cant even talk boy  
We dont even kiss  
It never works  
We cant move to this  
We cant even talk boy  
We dont even kiss  
And all I know is  
We cant move to this  
We cant even talk boy  
We dont even kiss  
It never works  
We cant move to this  
We cant even talk boy  
We dont even kiss  
Im not in love
