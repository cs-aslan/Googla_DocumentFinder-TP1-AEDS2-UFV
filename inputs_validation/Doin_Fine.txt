Have you noticed The way people seem today  
Look in their eyes you can feel their uncertainty  
Working hard for what they fear others would think  
Empty hearts are afraid to break away dont be afraid  
We could all use a little sunshine  
Take the day off outside  
Hey look around everythings better now  
And here we are and were doin fine  
If we look inside breath deep and count to ten  
Well find what we need to see us through  
All the way to the end  
Well know all the answers  
Once we stop this judgment game  
And realize deep down were all the same  
We could all use a little sunshine  
Take the day off and smile  
Hey look around everythings better now  
And here we are and getting along fine  
Yeah were doin just fine  
We could all use some sunshine  
Take the day off and smile  
Hey look around everythings better  
And here we are getting along just fine  
Next time we could try a little harder  
And quickly put out the fire  
By working out our differences and  
Finding truth we can all believe in  
Were looking at life from a different side  
Were looking at like from a different side  
And I know that well all be fine  
And I know that well all be fine
