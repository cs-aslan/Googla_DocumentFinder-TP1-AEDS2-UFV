Pick up yourself Joe  
Tell all the rest there is a way out  
If you want to get out  
Help me out  
Everybody thinks he knows the way out  
But nobody dares thats why were stuck in the ground  
Help me out  
  
Staying alive with a trigger in your head  
Staying alive with a trigger in your head  
Welcome welcome to the real side of life  
  
Everybodys smiling nobodys crying  
But everybodys kniving everyone from the back  
Wake up little boy  
Cause youre living in your dreams  
Open your eyes to the real side of life  
  
Staying alive  
  
I try to be good yes you are  
But no one seems to care oh here he goes again  
The harder you try you never tried  
The more they try to break me you never tried anything you  
I try to be good oh here he goes again  
Bu no one seems to care  
The harder I try I told you to do what they told you  
The more they try to break me you damn kid  
Welcome wlecome to the real side of life  
  
Is it dope you want or is it a gun you want  
You spell out what you want  
And then Ill get you what you want  
I want it all and I want it now  
Im gonna go ahead and grab it all  
Just for myself  
  
Staying alive
