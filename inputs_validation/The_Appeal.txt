Lord I stand in Your presence  
Wanting You and needing You  
And I am here and I surrender  
All of me so I can see  
Your will is where I desire to be  
Take all of me  
All that I have and all that I do  
I give it to You Lord its for You  
Just take my hand  
And Ill follow You  
For all that I am  
And all that I do its for You  
You are my song  
Its Your love that keeps me strong  
And You are the light  
In the darkness of my night  
Im lost without You  
Broken without You  
Oh how I need You  
Oh how I need You  
You make life worth living  
Your grace always keep giving  
Im lost without You  
Broken without You  
Oh how I need You  
Oh how I need You  
Lord have mercy Lord have mercy  
Ooh have mercy  
We need Your healing  
Please give us healing  
Lord have mercy  
Have mercy  
Lord have mercy  
Have mercy  
Oh Lord Lord I come  
Broken in this place  
Weak and poor  
For all I have is Yours all Yours  
This life these things  
They cant compare to You  
No wealth no fame can separate  
The one my heart adores  
Yet we take our eyes off You  
Were blind in reaching for the truth  
And now this whole world cries  
Because it realizes  
There is none quite like You  
The earth the stars the universe  
They just repeat these words so true  
Life begins and life will end with You  
Hear me singing  
When I die what will they say about me  
Will the work that Ive done  
Be enough to help someone  
When I die will I draw mens hearts to You  
At the setting of the sun  
Wanna hear You say  
Well done when I die  
Well done well done  
I know He will make me the spirit and the Incomprehensible
