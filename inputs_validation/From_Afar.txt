If I cannot see you from afar  
Look into your eyes that hint of depth  
Hidden inside  
If I cannot hear you from afar  
Whisper in my ear rest assured that  
You are near  
  
And I know not what its like  
The aforementioned  
For the distance between us  
As are the stars I only have you  
In my imagination  
In my imagination  
Just to love you  
From afar  
  
If I cannot kiss you from afar  
Press against your lips taste the sweetness  
Of your breath  
  
If I cannot touch you from afar  
Hold you in my arms keep you warm and  
Safe from harm  
  
Though our circumstances  
Cause separation  
In the absence theres a presence in my heart  
I will surrender Ill surrender to my  
Quiet contemplation  
My quiet contemplation  
Ill just Ill just love you  
From afar  
  
There must be a better way ooooooh  
A better way ooooooh of of passing the time  
I cant seem to get her out  
Out of my  
Get her out of my mind  
  
I dont know what its like  
The aforementioned  
For the distance between us  
As are the stars I only have you  
In my imagination  
In my imagination  
In my imagination  
In my imagination  
  
Just to love you  
Just to love you  
Just to love you
