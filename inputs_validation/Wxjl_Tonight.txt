The way it was in the past  
A long long time ago  
Before staff levels dropped  
They used to listen to the radio  
And listen to the DJs talk  
About the songs they didnt know  
As if it really mattered  
  
Hitpick or phonein show  
I dont want you to go tonight  
Ten thousand watts of power  
News headlines on the hour tonight  
Our music beats the best  
You just dont need the rest tonight  
Once I couldnt care at all  
But I can feel the ratings fall tonight  
And 20 years ago  
Noone seemed to care  
The people must have known  
The DJs role was only there  
To fill in space between the songs  
That talk of love and other things  
As if they didnt matter  
  
Automatic stations came  
And sent them all away  
And now Im left alone  
I havent got a word to say  
And youre the one who makes the choice  
To turn me on or turn me off  
But now it really matters  
  
Hitpick or phonein show  
I dont want you to go tonight  
Ten thousand watts of power  
News headlines on the hour tonight  
Our music beats the best  
You just dont need the rest tonight  
Once I couldnt care at all  
But I can feel the ratings fall tonight  
  
Hitpick or phonein show  
I dont want you to go tonight  
Ten thousand watts of power  
News headlines on the hour tonight  
Our music beats the best  
You just dont need the rest tonight  
Ten thousand watts of power  
News headlines on the hour tonight
