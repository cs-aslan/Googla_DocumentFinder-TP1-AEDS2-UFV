Dark clouds hangin over me  
When will they go away  
Rain is in my eyes and I cant see  
Lifes become just cloudy days  
  
Why she done me like she done  
I guess Ill never know  
She knows I need her more than anyone  
I made a point to let it show  
  
Cloudy days dont the sun ever shine anymore  
Stormy weather will you always be around  
When Im down I cant stand cloudy days  
  
I recall a time when times were good  
Lord it seems so long ago  
But you know they say if rain wont come  
Then love has no chance to grow  
  
Cloudy days dont the sun ever shine anymore  
Stormy weather will you always be around  
When Im down I cant stand cloudy days  
  
Cloudy days dont the sun ever shine anymore  
Stormy weather will you always be around  
When Im down I cant stand  
  
Cloudy days dont the sun ever shine anymore  
Stormy weather will you always be around  
When Im down I cant stand cloudy days  
  
Stormy weather will you always be around  
When Im down I cant stand cloudy days
