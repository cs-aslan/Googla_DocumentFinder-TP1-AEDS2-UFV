Im six foot three with a fist like a hammer  
And I work with the Vice Squad when I can  
And when I pull out my badge they forget all my glamor  
Little guys all surprised take a seat  
Peek at me its a bust Im a man  
Im the prettiest cop on the block  
I set your souls on fire  
Yes Im the prettiest cop on the block  
Im cool and Im so mean  
Oh Im the prettiest cop on the block  
Ive handcuffed your desire  
Ive got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock  
My kids are confused and my wife is in shock  
Im a full blooded man not a weak imitation  
I like to flex my arms in the neon lights  
Im a queen on the street and a king at the station  
Its a secret of mine not a sign Im gonna make that right  
Because Im the prettiest cop on the block  
I set your souls on fire  
Yes Im the prettiest cop on the block  
Im cool and Im so mean  
Im the prettiest cop on the block  
Ive handcuffed your desire  
Ive got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock  
My kids are confused and my wife is in shock  
I must look pretty shocking  
In my bullet proof vest  
With my black lace stockings  
All this hair on my chest  
When the boys see me coming  
All the boys start to run  
They all got their empty holsters  
And I got the only gun  
Because Im the prettiest cop on the block  
I set your souls on fire  
Yes Im the prettiest cop on the block  
Cool and Im so mean  
Yes Im the prettiest cop on the block  
I handcuff your desires  
I got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock  
My kids are confused and my wife is in shock  
Im the prettiest cop on the block  
I set your souls on fire  
Yes Im the prettiest cop on the block  
And Im cool so mean  
Im the prettiest cop on the block  
I handcuff your desires  
Im so pretty Im so pretty so pretty  
Yes Im gorgeous

And Im so mean so mean

But Im pretty and Im mean  
So pretty but Im mean  
And Im pretty
