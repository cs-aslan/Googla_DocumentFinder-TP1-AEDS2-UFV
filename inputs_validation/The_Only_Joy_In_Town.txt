I want to paint a picture  
Botticelli style  
Instead of Venus on a clam  
Id paint this flower child  
You are the air my flowers breathe  
He calls and the ladies turn around  
On the first day of Spring  
Im looking at the only joy around  
  
Hes the only joy around  
The only joy I found  
The only joy in town  
  
The Spanish steps are crowded  
Bunch of bodies brooding there  
Dead pan sidewalk vendors  
Hustling vacant stares  
Making all the more exceptional  
This fool in a flower crown  
On the first day of Spring  
Im looking at the only joy in town  
  
Hes the only joy around  
The only joy I found  
The only joy in town  
  
The Botticelli black boy  
With the fuchsias in his hair  
Is breathing in women like oxygen  
On the Spanish stairs  
In my youth I would have followed him  
All through this TerraCotta town  
On the first day of Spring  
Wed dance and sing  
And be the only joy around  
  
Wed be the only joy around  
The only joy in town  
Hes the only joy Ive found  
All day  
  
At night these streets are empty  
Where does everybody go  
Where are the brash and tender rooms  
In Roman candle glow  
Where are Fellinis circus  
La Dolce Vita clowns  
On the first day of Spring  
Im looking  
At the only joy in town  
  
Hes the only joy around  
The only joy I found  
The only joy in town
