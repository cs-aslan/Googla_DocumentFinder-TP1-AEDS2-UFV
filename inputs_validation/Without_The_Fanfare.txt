I know its the same old song Im singing  
But this time these words are just for you  
Thats the only thing thats new  
I know that Ive sung about a million  
Borrowed lines and phrases from a few  
This ones till as good as new  
Without the fanfare I love you  
By day I move words around like flowers  
I deliver by the afternoon  
cause the piper calls the tune  
Today I made full use of the hours  
I explored the smallest avenue  
And that feeling still came through  
Without the fanfare I love you  
Sure Ive lost my way sometimes  
But Ive had to pay  
Sometimes Ive gone completely overboard  
Moved a million phrases round tried to make them leave the ground  
Still the only line thats soared  
Bidding all the rest adieu  
Sounding still as good as new  
Without the fanfare I love you  
Hello do I still have your attention  
I forgot to mention thanks again from the captain and the crew  
And so without the sweet perfume or roses  
I hope you can still believe its true  
Stripped of all that much ado  
Without the fanfare I love you  
Without the fanfare I love you
