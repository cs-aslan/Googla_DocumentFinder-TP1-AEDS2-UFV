Some people think  
That shes one of those minkcoated ladies  
They say she wakes up at one  
And makes the paparazzi run till dawn  
She wines and dines with Argentines and Kuwaitis  
After she sips margaritas on the White House lawn  
  
Thats not her style I can tell you  
That aint my woman  
Its just not her style I can tell you  
Because Im her man  
  
The papers say  
She was seen in LA with a stranger  
She found a perfect body  
With a Maserati right outside  
  
And then she chartered a Lear  
When she heard her career was in danger  
And gave the pilot  
Somethin extra for a perfect ride  
  
Thats not her style I can tell you  
That aint my woman  
Its just not her style I can tell you  
Because Im her man  
  
Not that shes never d  
One something crazy or done something wild  
Its just that shes better  
At doing whatever suits her style  
And thats not her style  
  
Ive read where its said  
That she sleeps in a bed made of satin  
Shes had her face done in every place you can try  
They say she gets a piece  
  
Of every lease in Manhattan  
And says shes thirty  
When shes really pushing fortyfive  
  
Thats not her style I can tell you  
That aint my woman  
Its just not her style I can tell you  
Because Im her man
