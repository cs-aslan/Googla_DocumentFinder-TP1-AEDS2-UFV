Into the night Ive gotta go  
Thats when the juices start to flow  
Everything will be alright  
  
I might be blind but I can see  
I got the power inside of me  
Everything will be alright  
  
Im never gonna crack under a witchs spell  
Never put her chains on me  
Im never gonna break it  
No Ill never tell  
I know shell never let me be  
  
Party party with the animals  
Party no dogs allowed  
Party party with the animals  
Party no dogs allowed no more  
  
I like it fast I like it slow  
Theres no direction I couldnt go  
Everything will be alright  
  
I like it loud I like it mean  
I got the thunder in my machine  
Everything will be alright  
  
Dancing with disaster is a part of me  
Im never gonna let it go  
Dont know what Im after Im deserting me  
The secret that Ill never know
