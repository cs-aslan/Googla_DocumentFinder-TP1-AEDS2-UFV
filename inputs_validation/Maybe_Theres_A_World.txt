I have dreamt of a place and time  
Where nobody gets annoyed  
But I must admit Im not there yet  
But somethings keeping me going  
  
Maybe theres a world that Im still to find  
Maybe theres a world that Im still to find  
Open up oh world and let me in  
Then therell be a new life to begin  
  
I have dreamt of an open world  
Borderless and wide  
Where the people move from place to place  
And nobodys taking sides  
  
Maybe theres a world that Im still to find  
Maybe theres a world that Im still to find  
Open up oh world and let me in  
Then therell be a new life to begin  
  
Ive been waiting for that moment  
To arrive  
All at once the palace of peace  
Will fill my eyes how nice  
  
Maybe theres a world that Im still to find  
Maybe theres a world that Im still to find  
Open up oh world and let me in  
Then therell be a new life to begin  
  
Ive been waiting for that moment  
To arrive  
All at once the wrongs of the world  
Will be put right how nice
