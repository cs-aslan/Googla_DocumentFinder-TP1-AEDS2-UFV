Every mornin ole Tee Tot come round  
Settinup his shoe shine box in town  
And hed sing Good Mornin Montgomery  
Hed sing Good Mornin Montgomery  
Hed sing Good Mornin Montgomery  
Hes sing Good Morinin Montgomery Alabam  
  
Im so glad dont be sad  
Theres no way you could feel bad  
When this dear man with a tin pan  
Started to play the blues  
  
Met this white boy little Hiram Hank  
Took him in right under his wing  
And hed say Tee Tot make it ring  
And hed say Tee Tot make it ring  
And he would laugh and he would sing  
  
Could you please Show me  
Show me  
Show me show me  
If I could play just like you  
Why Id give anything  
  
Well he learned to play like the old man said he would  
Little Hirams got his name in Hollywood  
I wish that Tee Tot could have stayed around  
Then maybe Little Hiram would not have drowned  
In all those things that does a boy  
That wants to sing no good  
  
Little Hirams musics had a worldwide touch  
And we all owe Mr Rufus Payne so much  
We got peanuts fresh peanuts  
Put your money in the tin cup  
I can see them now with a big smile  
Splittin the days work up  
  
Could you please Show me  
Show me  
Show me show me  
If I could play just like you  
Why Id give anything  
  
Yes Mr Payne and Hiram Hank loved each other so much
