You swallowed my face  
When you kissed me today  
It was sweet but okay  
Thats a little much  
And when we walk down the street  
Youll be right under me  
I cant move two feet without your touch  
  
Ungreatful oh no I am not  
Most women would kill to have what I got I know  
All Im saying is that sometimes baby  
Theres nothing wrong with giving me a little room to breathe  
  
Baby I just need a little space  
A little break  
From you today  
Now I dont want you to go away  
But just for today  
Go over there could you go over there x2  
  
When Im getting ready  
To go out with my peeps  
You be looking at me  
Like can I come too  
Baby where are your friends  
Arent they off watching  
Football or something  
And waiting for you  
  
Ungreatful oh no I am not  
Most women would kill to have what I got I know  
All Im saying is that sometimes baby  
Theres nothing wrong with giving me a little room to breathe  
  
Baby I just need a little space  
A little break  
From you today  
Now I dont want you to go away  
But just for today  
Go over there could you go over there x2  
  
Just back up off of me  
Im not tryna be mean  
But could you give me fifty feet  
Only for a little while  
I know you love to be by my side  
And thats fine  
But every once in a while  
Take your space and give me mine  
  
Baby I just need a little space  
A little break  
From you today  
Now I dont want you to go away  
But just for today  
Go over there
