Took my chances carelessly  
choked on my own cigarette  
You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby  
but you aint seen the worst yet  
  
Now Im reckless gonna have some fun  
and the woman who is dead  
who was out alnight no Im not the only one  
  
And I aint standing never standing  
in the shadow of your love  
shadow of your love  
shadow of your love  
shadow of your love  
  
Wrote my changes helplessly  
yeah but I got no regrets  
Money it was on the table  
so I booked with all the bets  
  
Living like a lemon aint so hot  
and you aint my idea  
of one highrollin shot  
  
No I aint standing never standing  
Chorus  
Big dark clouds hanging over your head  
hope youve heard baby all Ive said  
Youve been told what Ive said  
No use crying youre as good as dead  
  
Now Im reckless gonna have some fun  
and the woman who is dead who is out alright  
now Im not the only one  
  
And I aint standing never standing  
Chorus
