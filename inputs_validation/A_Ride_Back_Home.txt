Chorus  
Hey Jesus can you give me a ride back home  
  
Ive been out here in this world too long on my own  
I wont bother you no more  
If you can just get me in the door  
  
Chorus  
  
When I started out I was so young and so strong  
I just let it roll off my back when things went wrong  
Now its starting to get to me  
All of this inhumanity  
  
Chorus  
  
You wouldnt know it by looking at me now  
But I was showing some promise once upon a time  
But its gone now  
And it aint coming back  
My times come and gone  
Its as simple as that  
  
Hey Jesus this world is just too troublesome for me  
I try to fight off all these devils but Im just too weak  
When Im out here walking all alone  
I feel like taking my life but I wont  
Too big a coward can you give me a ride back home  
  
Chorus x2
