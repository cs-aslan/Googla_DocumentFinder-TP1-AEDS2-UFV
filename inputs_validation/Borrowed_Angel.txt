Her fingers feel so gentle with her hand in mine  
Her hair feels like silk on my arm  
Her lips tell me so tenderly shes mine alone  
Until we part tonight and she goes home  
  
Barrowed angels belong to someone else  
I love my borrowed angel I just cant help myself  
That ring upon her finger dont belong to me  
But she loves me and I know shell save  
Some borrowed time for me  
  
I wish that I could have her more than just tonight  
We cant go on like this it isnt right  
When that lonesome feelin comes aknockin on my door  
Ill call my borrowed angel to ease the pain once more  
  
Barrowed angels belong to someone else  
I love my borrowed angel I just cant help myself  
That ring upon her finger dont belong to me  
But she loves me and I know shell save  
Some borrowed time for me
