Baby picks off your plateyours looks better  
And she throws hers on the floor  
Here in the home of the brave  
And the land of the free  
The first word that baby learns is more  
  
So youre out there floating like a big puffy cloud  
With the pool and the charcoal  
And the kids and the wife  
Til the reruns of your dreams are interrupted  
And you step out into life  
  
And its still gimme gimme what you got  
Gimme gimme what you got  
I said gimme gimme what you got  
I want it I want it  
Gimme gimme what you got  
  
Now its take and take takeover takeover  
Its all take and never give  
All these trumped up towers  
Theyre just golden showers  
Where are people supposed to live  
  
You can arm yourself alarm yourself  
But theres nowhere you can run  
Cause a man with a briefcase  
Can steal more money  
Than any man with a gun  
  
I said gimme gimme what you got  
Said gimme gimme what you got  
Gimme gimme what you got  
Gimme gimme what you got  
  
You got the price of admission  
You dont have to ask permission  
To take somethin from another man  
You cross a lawyer with the godfather baby  
Make you an offer that you cant understand  
  
From Main Street to Wall Street to Washington  
From men to women to men  
Its a nation of noses pressed up against the glass  
Theyve seen it on the TV  
And they want it pretty fast  
  
You spend your whole life  
Just pilin it up there  
You got stacks and stacks and stacks  
Then Gabriel comes and taps you on the shoulder  
But you dont see no hearses with luggage racks  
  
Gimme gimme what you got  
I said gimme gimme what you got  
I said gimme gimme what you got  
I want it I want it  
Gimme gimme what you got
