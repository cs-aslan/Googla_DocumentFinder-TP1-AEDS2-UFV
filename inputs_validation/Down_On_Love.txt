Some people stay all alone and hide  
They dont even want to know the reason why  
Theyve given up on finding someone new  
But new love comes its gonna come for you  
When true love comes its gonna comfort you  
  
Now you say youve got a broken heart  
You oughta know this side of love can leave you torn apart  
Dry your eyes cause your hearts gonna mend  
And maybe tonight youll fall in love again  
Yeah maybe tonight youll fall in love again  
  
But I know I know that youre down on love  
But youre wrong so wrong  
To be down on love  
  
Now love seems so far away  
Your skies are so cloudy  
And the tears come like fallin rain  
Face up to it and dont pretend  
And maybe tonight youll fall in love again  
Yeah maybe tonight youll fall in love again  
Just once in a lifetime youll realize  
When love takes two only one heart cries  
  
But youre wrong so wrong to be down on love  
You know youre not the only one  
See Ive been down on love  
  
In matters of the heart  
You better know before you start  
You cant get down on love  
  
So always be prepared  
To be alone and a little scared  
But never down on love  
  
You see you cant stay down forever girl  
Down on love  
Come on now  
Dont get down on love  
This aint right baby no  
Down on love  
Dont you go through life livin down on love  
Down on love  
Dont you go through life livin down on love  
Down on love  
Dont you go through life down on love  
Down on love  
Down on love
