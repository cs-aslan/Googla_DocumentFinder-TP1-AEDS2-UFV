A hatchet a hammer a bucket of nails  
An all the wood I can find  
Ill build me a cabin on top of the hill  
Got all the plans in my mind     
Where the tree tops talk to the wind  
Where the eagle flies  
Ill bring her to see it the minute Im through  
Wont she light up with surprise  
A hatchet a hammer a bucket of nails  
An just my two hands but with some help from above  
The walls will start risin the roof will go on  
The final touch will be love     
Where the tree tops talk to the wind  
Where the eagle flies  
The preacher will bless us as we hurry to  
Our happy home in the skies     
As soon as were married  
Were movin in to  
Our happy home in the skies     
 A hatchet a hammer a bucket of nails      
Our happy home in the skies
