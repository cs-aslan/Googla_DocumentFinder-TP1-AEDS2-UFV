That limousine in which you made the scene suits you to a T  
If all you want to be is somebody that dont never walk  
That big chateau where you want to go in the south of France  
Gonna end our big romance Dont you do it  
  
Honey dont leave L A that Riviera is so far away  
Begging you sil vous plait they dont know nothing down in St Tropez  
Baby dont leave L A  
  
I heard it said that you had it made with you movie star but oh how right
you are  
If thats really bout the best you can do  
You moved my soul so I played the role of your back door man  
Yes and now I cant really complain cause I love you  
  
Honey dont leave L A that Riviera is so far away  
Begging you sil vous plait they dont know nothing down in St Tropez  
Baby dont leave L A
