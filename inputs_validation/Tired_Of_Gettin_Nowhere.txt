Chorus  
Im tired of gettin nowhere wish I was inspired but its just not there  
I hope this doesnt last cause Im tired of gettin nowhere fast  
  
Woke up this morning and went back to sleep  
The sun was pourin and the rain was gettin deep  
I dont know what Im supposed to do  
Cause everywhere I turn I wind up headin back to you  
  
I dont know how long I will lay here in this bed  
Staring at the ceiling going crazy in my head  
Got to find some meaning some kind of reason to go on  
The only one I had was you and now youre gone and  
  
Chorus  
  
My friends all tell me I should mellow out  
Surely Ive got better things to think about  
Must be something I can find to help me lose these blues  
But the only thing thats on my mind is standing in your shoes  
  
Chorus  
  
Youd think by now Id be exactly where I want to be  
Got what I need know what I need to know  
Im all dressed up but without you theres nowhere to go  
  
Ooh youd think by now Id be exactly where I want to be  
Got what I need know what I need to know  
Im all dressed up but without you theres nowhere to go  
  
And Im so tired of gettin nowhere  
Wish I was inspired but its just not there  
I hope this doesnt last cause Im tired of gettin  
Tired of gettin tired of gettin nowhere  
  
Im tired of gettin nowhere so real tired of gettin nowhere  
Tired of gettin nowhere tired tired of gettin  
Im tired of gettin nowhere ooh yeah wont you say it ooh yeah  
Tired of gettin nowhere fast  get some rest
