Dolly Parton  
Its a dirty job  
But somebodys got to do it  
Better get to it  
Somebodys gotta do it  
Whatever it takes whatever it takes  
Any work at all  
Is better than none  
Better buckle down to it  
Gotta get the job done  
Gotta earn my pay I gotta earn my pay  
I cant wait around on the lottery  
And there aint no millionaires  
Lookin for me  
And somebodys gotta do it do it  
Somebodys gotta do it do it  
Somebodys gotta do it do it  
Somebody  
I can think of better things  
Id rather do  
I might get lucky  
And Im hopin to  
But until I do  
I gotta compromise  
The job aint much  
But at least its mine  
It beats standin  
In the unemployment line  
Put pride aside  
And Ill improvise  
Even if I do get a better job  
Somebody else  
Has gotta fill my spot  
Somebodys gotta do it do it  
Somebodys gotta do it do it  
Somebodys gotta do it do it  
Somebody  
Somebody  
Somebodys gotta do it do it  
Somebodys gotta do it do it  
Its a dirty job  
Its a lowdown dirty job  
Somebody  
Even if the rules are too hard to follow  
Even when pride is too hard to swallow  
Its another day so its another dollar  
Thats what its all about Oh  
Its a dirty job  
But somebodys got to do it  
Better get to it  
Somebodys gotta do it  
Whatever it takes  
Gotta keep the faith  
Any work at all  
Is better than none  
Better buckle down to it  
Gotta get the job done  
Gotta earn my way  
And its a workin day  
The job aint much  
But at least its mine  
It beats standin  
In the unemployment line  
Somebodys gotta do it do it  
Somebodys gotta do it do it  
Somebodys gotta do it do it  
Somebody  
Somebody  
Its a dirty job  
Somebodys gotta do this lowdown dirty job  
Somebody  
Its a dirty job its a dirty job  
Its a lowdown dirty job  
Somebody  
Somebody  
Somebody
