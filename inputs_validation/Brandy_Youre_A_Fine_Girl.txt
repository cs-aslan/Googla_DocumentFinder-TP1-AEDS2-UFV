Theres a port on a western bay  
And it serves a hundred ships a day  
Lonely sailors pass the time away  
And talk about their homes  
  
And theres a girl in this harbor town  
And she works layin whiskey down  
They say Brandy fetch another round  
She serves them whiskey and wine  
  
The sailors say Brandy youre a fine girl youre a fine girl  
What a good wife you would be such a fine girl  
Yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea

Brandy wears a braided chain  
Made of finest silver from the North of Spain  
A locket that bears the name  
Of a man that Brandy loves  
  
He came on a summers day  
Bringin gifts from far away  
But he made it clear he couldnt stay  
No harbor was his home  
  
The sailor said  Brandy youre a fine girl youre a fine girl  
What a good wife you would be such a fine girl  
But my life my lover my lady is the sea  
doodaditdooda ditdoodaditdoodadit  
  
Yeah Brandy used to watch his eyes  
When he told his sailor stories  
She could feel the ocean fall and rise  
She saw its ragin glory  
But he had always told the truth lord he was an honest man  
And Brandy does her best to understand  
doodaditdooda ditdoodaditdoodadit  
  
At night when the bars close down  
Brandy walks through a silent town  
And loves a man whos not around  
She still can hear him say  
  
She hears him say  Brandy youre a fine girl youre a fine girl  
What a good wife you would be such a fine girl  
But my life my lover my lady is the sea  
doodaditdooda ditdoodaditdoodadit  
  
Yeah Brandy youre a fine girl youre a fine girl  
What a good wife you would be such a fine girl  
But my life my lover my lady is the sea
