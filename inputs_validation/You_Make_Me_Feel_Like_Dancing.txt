Youve got a cute way of talking  
You got the better of me  
Just snap your fingers and Im walking  
Like a dog hanging on your lead  
Im in a spin you know  
Shaking on string you know  
  
You make me feel like dancing  
Im gonna dance the night away  
You make me feel like dancing  
Im gonna dance the night away  
You make feel like dancing  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing ahhh  
  
Quarter to four in the morning  
I aint feeling tired no no no no no  
Just hold me tight and leave on the light  
Cause I dont want to go home  
You put a spell on me  
Im right where you want me to be  
  
You make me feel like dancing  
I want to dance the night away  
You make me feel like dancing  
Im gonna dance the night away  
You make feel like dancing  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing  
  
You take me higher  
Im gonna catch on fire cause  
  
You make me feel like dancing  
I wanna dance the night away  
You make me feel like dancing  
Im gonna dance my life away  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing dance the night away  
I feel like dancing dancing ahhh  
  
You really slipped me a potion  
I cant get off of the floor  
All this perpetual motion  
You gotta give me some more  
You gotta give me some more  
And if youll let me stay well dance our lives away  
  
You make me feel like dancing  
I wanna dance my life away  
You make me feel like dancing  
I wanna dance my life away  
You make me feel like dancing  
I wanna dance my life away  
I feel  
You make me feel like dancing
