Wake up wake up my God  
This is not a test and its not too late to come lean  
Get it off your chest  
So steady your hand before your face and concentrate  
Theres got to be some stable ground left to walk on  
  
So tear another page from the book  
Are you asleep or just alone  
Clear this room from your lungs  
And pull yourself together man  
  
On your back youre sleeping in a bed of shame  
Let the light breathe some new life into this room  
Its what keeps you coming back  
Made up of instaiable taste  
Bury your head in your hands and sink into yourself  
  
Just what are you so afraid of  
Youre staring truth in the face so come on down  
  
Youre busy living now arent you  
Youre busy making vows  
Youre coming unglued  
Time is shorter than you kknow  
I know the light is blinding to the naked eye  
So why dont you take steps away from being alone  
I swear its not too late for you  
  
Its all worth reaching for the hand to pull you out  
Wake up and step outside your box  
Wake up
