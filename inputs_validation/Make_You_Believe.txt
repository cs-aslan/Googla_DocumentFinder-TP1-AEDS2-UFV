Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Ill make you believe again  
  
Down on your knees  
She made you feel like youre worthless  
You just dont deserve this no no  
How does it feel  
To think that you gave all you could  
Wish you did but you would  
  
Ill be the ears you talk to  
The doors you walk through  
The arms to hold on to  
Youre save with me  
  
Your hearts been stolen  
Eyes werent open  
Trust is broken  
But Ill make you believe again  
  
Make you stronger  
So well live longer  
Youve lost your faith in love  
But Ill make you believe again  
  
Where do you run  
Who do you turn to and burn to  
cause you though that she was the one  
She threw it away  
Lets do it nothing with pain  
You wont feel love again  
  
Ill be the ears you talk to  
The doors you walk through  
The arms to hold on to  
Youre save with me  
  
Your hearts been stolen  
Eyes werent open  
Trust is broken  
But Ill make you believe again  
  
Make you stronger  
So well live longer  
Youve lost your faith in love  
But Ill make you believe again  
  
Ill give you the strength that you need to forget  
Ill be the last thing that you would regret  
Make you believe in love again  
  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Ill make you believe again  
  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Ill make you believe again  
  
Your hearts been stolen  
Eyes werent open  
Trust is broken  
But Ill make you believe again  
  
Make you stronger  
So well live longer  
Youve lost your faith in love  
But Ill make you believe again  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Ill make you believe  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Ill make you believe again  
  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Ill make you believe again
