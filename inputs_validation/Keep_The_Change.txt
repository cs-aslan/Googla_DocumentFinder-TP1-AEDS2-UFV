Ill keep my freedom  
Ill keep my guns  
Try to keep my money  
And my religion too  
Try to keep on workin  
Try to keep on smilin  
I will keep my Christian name  
And yall can keep the change  
  
Ill keep my heroes  
Pictures on the wall  
Ill keep my family safe  
You bluff when I call  
Im gonna keep my big V8  
Keep my friends the same  
Keep the government outta my business  
And yall can keep the change

How do you like that name  
Ill keep the USA and yall can keep the change  
  
So FOX and friends

Supposed to be talkin about my fathers new CD  
Well two can play that Gotcha Game just wait and see  
Dont tread on me  
  
This countrys sure as hell been goin down the drain  
We know what we need  
We know who to blame  
United Socialist States of America
