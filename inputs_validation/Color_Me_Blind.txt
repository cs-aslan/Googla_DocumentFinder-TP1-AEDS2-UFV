I had a dream  
Last night I was blind  
And I couldnt see  
Color of any kind  
  
Picture the world minus a rainbow  
When day becomes night then where will the sun go  
Dancing alone just me and my shadow  
Color me blind so I can see no evil  
  
Why do we dream in black and white  
Color me blind  
Why do we dream in black and white  
Color me blind  
  
I had a dream  
I was looking over the mountain  
But Ive Ive yet to see the  
The socalled promised land  
  
Picture the world  
Without any color  
You couldnt tell  
One face from the other  
I dont understand  
Why we fight with our brother  
Color me blind  
Just to love one another  
  
Color me color you  
Color me blind
