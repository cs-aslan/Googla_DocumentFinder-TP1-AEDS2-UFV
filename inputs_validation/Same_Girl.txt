Its killing me  
Im losing sleep  
And Im waking up tired of it all  
3 in the morning  
And its starting already  
With my name always involved  
  
I try to get rid of the baggage  
Fake friends I call them hasbeen  
Yeah they lying on stuff  
And I dont care if they dont show me love no  
  
So they want me to lie down  
They want me to crawl  
They want me to cry now  
But Ive never fallen off  
  
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Too damn grown I dont owe nobody  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Too damn grown I dont owe nobody  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Cuz in the end Im still the same girl same girl  
Same girl same girl  
Same girl same girl  
Im just the same girl same girl  
Same girl same girl  
Same girl same girl  
  
Tell me what I gotta do  
Im tryna make it clear to you  
Not dealing with the attitude  
Im tired of tryna make you see that Im still me  
So I check my longitude and latitude  
Youre in my way you better move  
Knowing everyone is tryna bring me down  
Ohh baby ohh baby  
  
So they want me to lie down  
They want me to crawl  
They want me to cry now  
But Ive never fallen off  
  
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Too damn grown I dont owe nobody  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Too damn grown I dont owe nobody  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Cuz in the end Im still the same girl same girl  
Same girl same girl  
Same girl same girl  
Im just the same girl same girl  
Same girl same girl  
Same girl same girl
