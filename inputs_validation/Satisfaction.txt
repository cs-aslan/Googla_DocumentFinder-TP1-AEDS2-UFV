Verse 1  
Saturday night The club was packed But I cant get no action  
The girl I want is frontin hard I cant get no satisfaction  
Thousand people up in the club and the musics thumpin hard  
I must admit that I was slightly anxious to have my card  
Pooled by a girl in a nice tight dress  
The kind that makes ya body wet Hmm I must confess  
I tryed and she said no But fellas yo I cant get no  
Chorus  
I cant get no Yeah  
I cant get no Ya know what Im sayin  
I cant get no Yep Yep  
Satisfaction Ah hey hey hey  
You know what I say  
Thats what I say  
Yeah  
Verse 2  
Girlie at the bar Lookin mighty fly  
She look so fly at the time  
I had to make up You know My mind  
So I walked up to her gently Just so I can speak  
Man she turned around and scoped me down and started doin the freak  
I tryed all I could I even said please  
She moved my hands off her booty Cause she was a skeeze  
Man I had to escape So I could get away  
I told her what was up She said come back another day  
Chorus  
Verse 3  
The partys almost over The clubs about to close  
I saw this girl who rocked my world So I suppose  
Ill take another chance A try at romance  
I couldnt take my eyes off the back of her pants  
I moved very smoothly A nice conversation  
The perfume she was wearing Ooh Sensation  
She seemed kinda worried Like something was wrong  
Tyson at my back I had to move along  
Chorus  
Repeat chorus till fade
