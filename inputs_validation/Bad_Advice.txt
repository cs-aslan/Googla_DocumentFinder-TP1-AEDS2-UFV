She said Tell me what its all about I said Why why why  
Its just something you could do without You better try try try  
She said I cant reach you on the telephone  
I cant call you when youre not at home  
You keep saying that youre all alone  
Thats a lie lie lie  
  
Chorus  
Bad advice had me down and undone Got to try again to believe in myself  
Look at me Im alone in the end Can you see me falling falling down  
I said Mama can you get it straight She said Why why why  
I want to tell you that it just cant wait so lets try try try  
She said I dont care where you might have gone  
I dont care cause youve done me wrong  
You been doin it far too long  
So goodbye bye bye  
  
Chorus  
She said Tell me what its all about I said Why why why  
Its just something you can do without You better try try try  
I cant reach you on the telephone I cant call you when youre not at home  
You keep saying that youre all alone Thats a lie lie lie
