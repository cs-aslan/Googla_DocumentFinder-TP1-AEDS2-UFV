When Im down feeling blue  
I close my eyes oh just to be with you  
Im a dreamer and you know  
Youre my woman and Ill never go  
God put an angel here on earth  
Who gave me more than all Im worth  
Youre my angel in the night  
In the darkness youre the light  
  
Heaven will know oh heaven will know  
My love will grow baby  
Heaven will know  
That I need you so  
I cant say goodbye lady  
  
Heaven will know  
That Ill never let go  
And Im stay until my heart stand still  
No matter what baby  
Feel what you want  
Heaven sent me an angel  
Heaven sent me a star  
  
And its more than a passing phase  
And its more than a good nights days  
And its more than youll ever know  
And youll never be alone
