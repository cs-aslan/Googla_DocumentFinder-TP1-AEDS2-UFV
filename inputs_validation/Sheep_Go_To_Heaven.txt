Im not feeling alright today  
Im not feeling that great  
Im not catching on fire today  
Love has started to fade  
Im not going to smile today  
Im not gonna laugh  
Youre out living it up today  
Ive got dues to pay  
  
And the gravedigger puts on the forceps  
The stonemason does all the work  
The barber can give you a haircut  
The carpenter can take you out to lunch  
  
Now I just want to play on my panpipes  
I just want to drink me some wine  
As soon as youre born you start dyin  
So you might as well have a good time  
  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats go to hell  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goatsgo to hell  
  
I dont wanna go to Sunset Strip  
I dont wanna feel the emptiness  
Old marquees with stupid band names  
I dont wanna go to Sunset Strip  
  
I dont wanna go to Sunset Strip  
I dont wanna feel the emptiness  
Old marquees with stupid band names  
I dont wanna go to Sunset Strip  
  
And the gravedigger puts on the forceps  
The stonemason does all the work  
The barber can give you a haircut  
The carpenter can take you out to lunch  
  
Now but I just want to play on my panpipes  
I just want to drink me some wine  
As soon as youre born you start dyin  
So you might as well have a good time  
  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats go to hell  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goatsgo to hell  
  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats go to hell  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goatsgo to hell  
  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goats go to hell  
Sheep go to heaven  
Goatsgo to hell
