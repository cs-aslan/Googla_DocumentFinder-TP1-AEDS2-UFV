Grass is green  
Like Ive never seen  
Sky above was never so blue  
Now here am I  
No one standing near  
Its a lonely world  
Such a lonely world  
  
The world through a tear  
From days gone by  
The world through a tear  
Too slow to dry  
The world through a tear  
The tear I cry  
  
Just last year  
We wandered here  
And dreamed a dream  
That never would die  
Now only me  
Hopin shell appear  
Its a lonely world  
Such a lonely world  
  
The world through a tear  
From days gone by  
The world through a tear  
Too slow to dry  
The world through a tear  
The tear I cry
