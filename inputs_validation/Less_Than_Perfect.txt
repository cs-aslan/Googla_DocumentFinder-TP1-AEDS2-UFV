I know a song aint good enough to let you know how I feel  
Ill sing it hard Ill sing it sweet to let you know that its real  
If I change my attitude maybe I can conquer you completely  
All the things I say and do everything I learn from you defeats me  
  
And I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
  
I know its wrong to blame the past for everything that I do  
I fool the world most of the time but theres no fooling you  
If I change my attitude maybe I can conquer you completely  
Everything I say and do all I learn from you defeat me  
  
And I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
Let you down  
  
What you see aint always what you get  
No matter how clear it seems  
One minute lovers then the next  
  
Oh oh no  
Oh no  
  
I let you down yeah yeah  
I let you down Repeat x5  
Let you down  
Let you down
