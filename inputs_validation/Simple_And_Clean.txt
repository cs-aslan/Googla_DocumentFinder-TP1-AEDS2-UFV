When you walk away  
You dont hear me say please  
Oh baby dont go  
Simple and clean is the way that youre making me feel tonight  
Its hard to let it go  
  
Youre giving me too many things  
Lately youre all I need  
You smiled at me and said  
  
Dont get me wrong I love you  
But does that mean I have to meet your father  
When we are older youll understand  
What I meant when I said no  
I dont think life is quite that simple  
  
When you walk away  
You dont hear me say please  
Oh baby dont go  
Simple and clean is the way that youre making me feel tonight  
Its hard to let it go  
  
So simple and clean baby  
  
The daily things  
like this and that and what what  
That keep us all busy  
All confusing me  
Thats when you came to me and said  
  
Wish I could prove I love you  
But does that mean I have to walk on water  
When we are older youll understand  
Its enough when I say so  
And maybe somethings are that simple  
  
When you walk away  
You dont hear me say please  
Oh baby dont go  
Simple and clean is the way that youre making me feel tonight  
Its hard to let it go  
  
Hold me  
Whatever lies beyond this morning  
Is a little later on  
Regardless of warnings the future doesnt scare me at all  
Nothings like before
