Lady I know it was hard  
But its much harder to ignore  
Theres a chance and Ill promise  
I wont hurt you anymore  
Hollywood nights were romancin  
You can trust me anytime  
Somewhere oh babe  there is someone  
Oh youre dancing in my mind  
  
Ohoho little queenie  
Im your fool  
Come on teach me the rules  
And I will send an SOS for love  
Ohoho little queenie  
Im your fool  
You need love like I do  
And I will send a SOS for love  
  
Atlantis is calling SOS for love  
Atlantis is calling from the stars above  
Atlantis is calling SOS for love  
Atlantis is calling its too hot to stop  
  
If loving you is wrong babe  
Oh I dont want to be right  
Ive got you under my skin babe  
And baby hold me tight  
Im ready for our romance  
I wait a million years for you  
I love you more than Im saying  
Baby thats for me the truth
