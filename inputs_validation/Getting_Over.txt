Its been three nights or so since I last slept  
Just thinking about the promises you never kept  
And all the times I tried so hard to leave  
In response to words I never could believe  
  
They told me youre crazy  
They said that youve lost your mind  
And Ive got no reason  
To think otherwise  
You told me you loved me  
But I guess that you told me lies  
Now I see the real you  
That hides behind your deep blue eyes  
  
Wait  
And all our time has seemed to fade  
In the end your colors changed  
And were now getting over  
  
Heres all the pictures you never wanted to take  
With your toothless smile that always seemed so fake  
And all the notes you wrote when you got bored  
I dont think I need to read them anymore  
  
Its all to confusing  
When I dont know where to begin  
Itd almost be easy  
If only we could pretend  
But how could I feel you  
When youd never let me in  
And how am I to know where youre coming from  
If you never tell me where youd been  
  
Wait  
And all our time has seemed to fade  
In the end your colors changed  
And were now getting over  
  
Lie for a lie  
But Im not the unforgiving type  
Itll probably just take a while  
Wait for me to get my feet grounded  
Find the love that you never found in me  
I find love on my feet in places youll never be  
Wait til I find my place in the sky and finally see through my clear eyes  
I soon will realize its time for me to say goodbye  
  
You told me you loved me  
But I guess that you told me lies  
Im so sick of the real you  
That hides behind your deep blue eyes  
They told me youre crazy  
They said that youve lost your mind  
And you have showed me nothing  
To prove them otherwise  
  
Wait  
And all our time has seemed to fade  
In the end your colors changed  
And were now getting over  
Again  
Looking back on time wed spent  
Its funny to remember when  
We used to be together
