Huh huh ooh Im just a fool for you  
Huh huh huh huh  
I cant get you off my mind  
No matter what I do  
Im wishing you were here with me  
Makes no difference when it is  
I only think of you  
And Im living out my fantasy  
  
Late at night I run to you  
Being such a lovesick fool  
It might be pouring rain it will be pouring  
Its still the same  
Nothings changed  
All in all I feel no shame  
Im just your fool insane Im just a fool  
  
Chorus  
I keep thinking about you baby  
Oh so tell me what ya gonna do  
Got me thinking about you  
All I want to do  
  
Like a river of wine  
Intoxicate my mind  
Im thinking about you  
Thats what I want to do  
Pick me up lets go down  
Im thinking about it too yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Im thinking about you  
Got me thinking about you  
Im thinking about it too  
  
Make believing is a game  
Thats not for me to play  
Dont you need me just like I need you  
Theres no reason  
Just my heart that makes me feel this way  
And I hope you feel the same way too  
  
Late at night I run to you  
Being such a lovesick fool  
It might be pouring rain it will be pouring  
Its still the same  
Nothings changed  
All in all I feel no shame  
Im just your fool insane Im just a fool  
  
Chorus  
  
It might be pouring rain  
Like a fool insane  
Im just a lovesick fool  
I got this thing for you Im just a Im just a lovesick fool  
Oh just a fool for you  
  
Chorus
