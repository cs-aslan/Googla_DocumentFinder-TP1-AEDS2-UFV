I am the fly on the wall  
My prying eyes are looking through your bottom drawer  
I just came flying through your door  
You didnt notice that your number had been called  
  
I see the mother whos beating the babe  
I see the money  
The pennies you save  
Stored on computers  
From birth to the grave  
  
The fly on the wall  
Hes seeing it all  
  
I am the fly upon the wall  
Youre in the index of the files that stand so tall  
Although your health is rather poor  
We have a place for those who cannot find a cure  
  
I know your income  
Your daily crust  
I know your pleasures  
Your passion  
Your lust  
I know when youre living and I know when youre dust  
  
The fly on the wall  
Hes seeing it all  
  
One is born and one will die its all understood  
The bit thats in the middle doesnt count  
  
I am the fly on the wall  
My prying eyes are looking through your bottom drawer  
I just came flying through your door  
You didnt notice that your number had been called  
  
I see the mother whos beating the babe  
I see the money  
The pennies you save  
Stored on computers  
From birth to the grave  
  
The fly on the wall  
Hes seeing it all I am the fly  
  
I am the fly upon the wall  
Youre in the index of the files that stand so tall  
Although your health is rather poor  
We have a place for those who cannot find a cure  
  
I know your income  
Your daily crust  
I know your pleasures  
Your passion  
Your lust  
I know when youre living and I know when youre dust  
  
The fly on the wall  
Hes seeing it all
