Lover dont love too much  
Its a bad thing a sad thing  
It is heaven to the touch  
Hey everybodys got a moment in their lives  
They cant change

All that I know  
Is that love dont belong heer  
So its better to turn the page  
Watch me walk away my dear

And Ill never give you much  
Hey everybodys got some moment in their lives

In a place you will be all mine
