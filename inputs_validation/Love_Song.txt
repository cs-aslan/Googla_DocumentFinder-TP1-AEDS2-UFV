Ive never written a love song  
That didnt end in tears  
Maybe youll rewrite my love song  
If you can replace my fears  
I need your patience and guidance  
And all your lovin and more  
When thunder rolls through my life  
Will you be able to weather the storm  
Theres so much I would give ya baby  
If Id only let myself  
Theres this well of emotions  
I feel I must protect  
But whats the point of this armor  
If it keeps the love away too  
Id rather bleed with cuts of love  
Than live without any scars  
Baby can I trust this  
Or do all things end  
I need to hear that youd die for me  
Again and again and again  
So tell me when you look in my eyes  
Can you share all the pain and happy times  
Cause I will love you for the rest of my life  
This is my very first love song  
That didnt end in tears  
I think you rewrote my love song  
For the rest of my years  
I will love you for the rest of my Life
