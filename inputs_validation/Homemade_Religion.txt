Stop  
It s 3 15  
You have one minute  
Are you ready  
  
Now think of all things created  
Think of those that you care for  
Think of what youve been blessed with  
And everything that makes you afraid  
  
Wish for anything  
Let yourself dream  
Wish for things to get better  
Until 3 16  
  
Theres a stone in my garden that keeps me committed  
And close to the ground when I feel I should run  
Theres a branch in my window that helps me remember  
To reach out my arms and touch the sun  
  
There are two million ants that live in my sidewalk  
Working together to nurture and feed  
And the old tv set with the sad evening news  
So I never forget how much love we need  
  
Homemade religion  
In my kitchen  
Homemade religion  
  
Think of how youve been feeling  
And how youve made others feel  
Think of what youve been given  
And what you need to heal  
  
Wish for anything  
Try to keep still  
Wish for things to get better  
And maybe they will  
  
There s a plant in the corner that helps me remember  
All of the beauty that grows from a seed  
And the old tv set with the sad evening news  
So I never forget how much love we need  
  
Homemade religion  
In my kitchen  
Homemade religion  
  
Stop
