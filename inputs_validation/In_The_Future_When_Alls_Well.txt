Armed with wealth and good health  
The best of health  
In the future when alls well  
I will lie down and be counted  
In the future when alls well  
  
I thank you  
I thank you with all of my heart  
I thank you  
I thank you with all of my heart  
Lee please stand up and defend me  
In the future when alls well  
Confront what you are afraid of  
In the future when alls well  
  
Every day I play a sad game called  
In the future when alls well  
Living longer than I had intended  
Something must have goneright  
  
I thank you  
I thank you with all of my heart  
I thank you  
I thank you with all of my heart  
Lee please stand up and defend me  
In the future when alls well  
Confront what you are afraid of  
In the future when alls well  
  
Hold me closely if your will allows it  
In the future when alls well  
Pairedoff pawed till I can barely stand it  
The future is ended by a long long sleep  
The future is ended by a long long sleep  
The future is ended by a long sleep
