Theres something strange happening in the neighborhood  
The strangest things youve ever seen  
Theyre all dressed up in their costumes and looking good  
  
Trickortreat its Halloween Halloween  
  
Halloween comes October thirtyone  
Its a creepy crawly night What Night  
Theyre tricks and treats and fun for everyone
