Baby your love it surrounds me but never gives me half a chance  
I need a little heart infection cause love needs a little romance  
And well never ever make it if youre pushin me  
You gotta back up baby or I might leave  
You gotta show me hold me and let love breathe tonight  
  
Give me the right kind of love oh baby  
Give me the right kind of love  
Give me the right kind of love and Ill be yours tonight  
Ill be yours  
  
Baby you want some kind of promise Well nothin is forever these days  
Lovers come and go friends bought and sold everything blows away  
You know everythings changing baby overnight  
You gotta hold on to love but not too tight  
You gotta see it see it its not how long but how right  
  
Give me the right kind of love oh baby  
Give me the right kind of love  
Give me the right kind of love and Ill be yours tonight  
Ill be yours  
  
Just tell me that love is right and look me in the eye  
Ive gotta know your heart tonight before I give away a piece of my life  
  
Oh give me the right kind of love oh baby  
Give me the right kind of love  
Give me the right kind of love oh baby  
Give me the right kind of love  
Oh give me the right kind of love oh baby  
Give me the right kind of love  
Give me the right kind of love oh baby  
Give me the right kind of love  
Give me the right kind of love oh baby  
Give me the right kind of love  
Give me the right kind of love baby  
Give me the right kind of love
