Maybe the lateness of the hour  
Makes me seem bluer than I am  
But in my heart there is a shower  
I hope shell be happier with him  
Maybe the darkness of the hour  
Makes me seem lonelier than I am  
But over the darkness I have no power  
Hope shell be happier with him  
  
I cant believe that she dont want to see me  
We lived and loved with each other so long  
I never thought that she really would leave me  
But shes gone  
Maybe the lateness of the hour  
Makes me seem bluer than I am  
But in my heart there is a shower  
Hope shell be happier with him
