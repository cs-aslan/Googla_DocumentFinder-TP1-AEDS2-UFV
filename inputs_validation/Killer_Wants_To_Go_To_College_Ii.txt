Sal  
I know youre trying to protect me  
Searching for another truth  
With your language and your poetry  
From my ignorance and youth  
  
Hey I did not come to argue  
My life never made much sense  
I just wish that I could hug you  
Youre my only defense  
  
I dont understand your writing  
I could barely sign my name  
All I ever learned was fighting  
But Im not the only one to blame  
  
The streets were dark with danger  
I have to stand up for my friends  
In a land where Im a stranger  
And the hatred never ends  
  
Inmate  
Killer wants to go on T V
