Everything is slower here everybodys got a union card  
They get up on Sunday go to church of their choice  
Come back home cook out in the backyard  
  
And they call this the Great Midwest  
Where the cornfields grow and flow  
Theyre all 5 years ahead of their time  
Or 25 behind I just dont know  
  
And all the young men talk about their 4 wheel drives  
How much money theyre gonna make on Friday night  
And they like to brag about how they mistreat their girlfriends  
Hey lets get drunk party it up start a fight  
  
And they call this the Great Midwest  
Sure make a hell of a car  
And the old hearts they race their way through the night  
The upheaval of who they really are  
  
Growin up under normal conditions television and radio  
Thats just about all of this whole world  
That any of us get to see get to know  
  
And they call this the Great Midwest  
Where you sacrifice body and soul  
No one really wants to get even  
Most of us find it hard enough just lettin go  
  
Dont get me wrong I aint complaining  
I aint braggin nor do I mean to place blame  
Thats just the way things are around here  
And theres a future carryin my name on it  
  
Sayin hey man you gonna stick around here you better get on it  
If youre gonna stick around here  
You better make yourself some real good friends  
  
Well I wasnt born with a silver spoon in my mouth  
So I cant talk about the big city hilife  
You wanna talk about bein bored and runnin  
Away from yourself hell I can talk to you all night  
  
And they call this the Great Midwest  
Where livin is just gettin by  
And people they trade in their happiness  
For a smokestack a big money deal in the sky
