Check it out  
I break a nigga down ugly like Coke up on the scale  
Next step throw a stack up on the third rail  
The undisputed Im never ever diluted or polluted  
You could fuse it if ya choose it cause its deep rooted  
I make ya maggot ass crawl out the gutter  
For underestimating as Im creating the butter  
Cliques get clipped like heavy bricks when Im dropping  
Im wrecking nigga whole shit plus I make a profit  
Wicked with this shout bodies are fished out  
Im wrecking niggas onebyone but then I miscount  
Mispronounced how do LL bounce  
And get ya shit bust I turn ya fagots into mush  
Ya slipping Im gripping microphones real tight  
Then I crack up the speakers in ya Ac all night  
Deliver messages the prophecys in me  
His Royal Highness you minus what you claim to be  
Say what  
  
Chorus x3  
Uh I get da drop on you niggas  
I blow it I make it hot for my niggas  
  
I blow em kaboom but fuck sound effects  
Niggas was sleeping like I was off on a Star Trek  
Select my dialect inspect all my checks  
He claim he getting money but L cast the cheque  
You sell blunt weed Glock block horizons  
Niggas in the projects find ya hypnotizing  
You clowns know when I bring forth the heat  
Hardcore niggas be wearing panties looking sweet  
Im on a journey through the land of fronting niggas  
Nervous motherfuckers with the hands on dirty triggers  
I lay back niggas beef or let my nuts live  
I take my blade insert it until ya guts give  
Execution the destroyer of ya suspect bunch  
What Drama You cant believe how I deliver bomb shit  
Ya brains split the pain hits ya little dick  
  
Chorus  
  
You falling backwards leaning like a dope addict  
Rope niggas claim me packing automatics  
Found his ol Earths burner underneath the mattress  
Go outside the bitch up just like a actress  
I take ya motherfuckers onebyone and show ya how its done  
And dick ya down in front of everyone  
Bitch niggas aint got no type of reason  
To say a bullshit rhyme in LL season  
Im freezing ya bleeding heavily up outcha rectum  
Black and blue trying ta hide up in the spectrum  
I got ya raw ass busting straight flat  
Head up on the place mat ready to waste that  
Operating incorporates stimulating designs  
Lay that motherfuckers shit down nigga resign  
Dont lose ya mind concentrating on how I shine  
You never hear a nigga like me never in time  
I blaze it quick amaze cliques when I flip  
I cant believe you niggas forgot who rip shit  
Its 96 and niggas like to hold they dicks  
Im breaking shit aside ya doctors cant fix  
  
Chorus  
  
Fuck the tricks and all them smooth singing grooves  
Im bringing crews in my ring you swing and lose  
With the blues light my fuse allow me  
To show ya crab ass fake niggas how it be  
My techniques superb when Im pissing on these herbs  
Crystal clear so you can hear every word  
Fuck the goodiegoodie or your moms might hear it  
I gotta keep my title locked down so niggas fear it  
Uh I get da drop on you niggas  
I blow it I make it hot for my niggas  
  
Repeat x2  
Uh I get da drop on you niggas  
I blow it I make it hot
