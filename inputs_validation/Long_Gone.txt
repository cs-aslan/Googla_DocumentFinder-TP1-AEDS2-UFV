Oh well its long gone long gone  
You got my baby and youre long gone  
But Ill be a hangin around  
I know youre gonna put her down  
Shell need someone thats true  
When she wakes up one day  
To find youre long gone long gone  
  
You just wandered into town  
Took her and you started messin around with my baby  
You stole her heart cause she aint used to your kind  
With your fancy clothes and your uptown style  
It didnt take you but a little while to get your way  
Cause your pretty little lies she couldnt see behind  
  
And now its long gone long gone  
You got my baby and youre long gone  
But Ill be a hangin around  
I know youre gonna put her down  
Shell need someone thats true  
When she wakes up one day  
To find youre long gone long gone  
  
Well a man in me would like to fight  
To take you down by the river tonight  
And rearrange your face  
But that would make her hate the site of me  
  
So theres nothing left for me to do  
Standin watchin that the likes of me  
Hurt the girl I love while shes too much  
In love with you to see  
  
Oh well its long gone long gone  
You got my baby and youre long gone  
But Ill be a hangin around  
I know youre gonna put her down  
Shell need someone thats true  
When she wakes up one day  
To find youre long gone long gone
