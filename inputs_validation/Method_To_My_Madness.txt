Ive played the game  still its not worth it  
Like a woman in the rain  
I close my eyes  
Im on the shelf  
I know myself  
  
Ive seen the lights of every city  
Tried to work out where I am  
I close my mind for the day  
I know the way  
  
Ive played the game  still its not worth it  
Like a woman in the rain  
So I close my eyes  
Im on the shelf  
I know my self  
  
Theres never ever anybody to rely on  
There isnt time to count the shoulders I have cried on  
Thats just circumstances  I must take my chances  
But baby you dont know what Im saying  
But I guess thats not true  
And you know thats true  
But theres a method to my madness  
  
Ive played the game  still its not worth it  
Like a woman in the rain  
So I close my eyes for the day  
I know the way
