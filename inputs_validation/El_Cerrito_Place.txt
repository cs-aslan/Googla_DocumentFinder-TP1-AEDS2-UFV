I been hangin round this place I been lookin through your space  
I been waitin for you Ive been waitin for you  
All the places that you go all the people that you know  
Ive been lookin for you Ive been lookin for you  
  
And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place  
They all got somethin in their pockets all got somethin on their face  
They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard  
Singin hallelujah while they dance over the stars  
They all say theyre goin far  
  
Me Ive been lookin for you baby Ive been lookin for you baby  
Ive been lookin for you baby Ive been lookin for you baby  
All night long all night long all night long  
  
Somebody said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land  
So Ive been out here all night lookin for your footprints in the sand  
Did you hear the ocean singing baby did you sing along  
While you danced out in the water to some ol forgotten song  
Were you even here at all  
  
Me Ive been lookin for you baby Ive been lookin for you baby  
Ive been lookin for you baby Ive been lookin for you baby  
All night long all night long all night long  
  
Somehow I wound up in the desert just after daylight  
Where the Joshua Trees grow that little place you always liked  
These pioneer town people aint got too much to say  
And if you ever were here baby they aint givin you away  
  
Now its been two days  
Im still lookin for you baby Ive been lookin for you baby  
Ive been lookin for you baby Ive been lookin for you baby  
All night long all night long all night long  
  
And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place  
They all got somethin in their pockets all got somethin on their face  
  
Somebody said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land  
So Ive been out here all night lookin for your footprints in the sand  
  
Think Ill go back to the city back to El Cerrito Place  
Thats the last time I saw that pretty smile upon your face  
Ive been lookin for you baby
