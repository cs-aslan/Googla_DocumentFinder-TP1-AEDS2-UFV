So every day I see you in some other face  
They crack a smile talk a while  
Try to take your place  
My memory serves me far too well  
  
I just sit here on this mountain thinking to myself  
Youre a fool boy  
Why dont you go down  
Find somebody  
Find somebody else  
My memory serves me far too well  
  
Its not as though we just broke up  
Its not as though it was yesterday  
But something I just cant explain  
Something in me needs this pain  
I know Ill never see your face again  
  
Cmon now  
Ive got to be strong now  
  
Now everybodys talking about this new decade  
Like you say the magic numbers  
Then just say goodbye to  
The stupid mistakes you made  
Oh my memory serves me far too well  
  
Dont you know that  
The years will come and go  
Some of us will change our lives  
Some of us still have nothing to show  
Nothing baby  
But memories  
  
And if these wounds  
They are selfinflicted  
I dont really know  
How my poor heart could have protected me  
But if I have to carry this pain  
If you will not share the blame  
I deserve to see your face again  
  
Cmon now  
You dont have to be so strong now  
Come back  
  
Come back to me darling  
I will make it worth your while  
Come back to your baby  
I miss your kiss  
I miss your smile  
Seems to me the peace I search to find  
Aint going to be mine until you say you will  
Dont you keep me waiting for that day  
I know I know I know  
You hear these words that I say  
  
You cant always get what you want
