She goes for her medical  
Shes passed its a miracle  
Shes up over the moon  
She whistles nonsense tunes  
She wants drinks for everyone  
Shes found a chord that she can strum  
Emotions peaking out  
Her paints all over town  
  
Chorus  
Whats that shes playing  
Annie get your gun  
Whats that shes taking  
The song has to be sung  
Shes gone electric  
Annie wipe them out  
Thats unexpected  
Strum that thing and shout  
Dont pull that trigger  
Annie get your gun  
Dont shoot that singer  
Youre shooting number one number one  
  
Hes not into miracles  
Sees life all to cynical  
The cat has got his tongue  
Now she bangs on his drum  
He says pull the other one  
Bells ring look what you have done  
Emotions leaking out  
Her paints all over town  
  
Whats that shes playing  
Annie get your gun  
Whats that shes taking  
The song has to be sung  
Shes gone electric  
Annie wipe them out  
Thats unexpected  
Strum that thing and shout  
Dont pull that trigger  
Annie get your gun  
Dont shoot that singer  
Youre shooting number one  
  
Get your gun  
Get your gun  
Shes gone electric  
Annie wipe them out  
Thats unexpected  
Strum that thing and shout  
Dont pull that trigger  
Annie get your gun  
Dont shoot that singer  
Annie Annie Annie Annie
