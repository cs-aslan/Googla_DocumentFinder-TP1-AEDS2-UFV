I try hard to resist you  
Pretend that youre not there  
I havent even kissed you  
But dont think that I wont dare  
Cause you get to me baby  
Like no one ever could  
Why dont you come and save me  
Dont tease me like you do  
  
No no no no  
Ay ay I cant do without you  
Nono cant do  I cant do without you  
Ay ay I cant do without you  
  
No matter what they tell me  
Theres nothin like true love  
But if theres no happy ending  
At least you loved then lost  
Thats how I feel about you  
And though it may take some time  
I love everything about you  
And Ive got to make you mine  
  
No no no no  
Ay ay I cant do without you  
I love you baby cant you see I want you baby  
Ay ay I cant do without you  
  
And though you set me up then  
Turn me down  
No matter what you say or do  
Your eyes are telling me you want me too  
Im looking right through you  
  
And what I see is heaven  
Just waiting there for me  
Baby this was meant to happen  
Or Ill never be set free  
  
No no no no  
Ay ay I cant do without you  
No baby cant do  
Ay ay I cant do without you
