I try hard to put you out of my mind  
Every night alone Im thinking about you  
How can I avoid this pain without you  
I wont cry I wont be sorry no more  
I know that this is something Ill get over  
Maybe I could learn to love another  
Its just a matter of time a matter of time  
  
Just because I lock myself in my room  
It doesnt mean that Im afraid to talk to  
Those people I know that might have seen you  
Youll return I keep reminding myself  
I wont look back wont regret a single moment  
Im going to mend this heart inside youve broken  
Its just a matter of time a matter of time  
Its just a matter of time a matter of time
