It is the key to all the doors  
It is the crashing on the shores  
It lives in your steering wheel  
It hides in the wind and rain  
With voices as cold as steel  
Its calling your name  
It is the smile upon his face  
It is the winning of the race  
It lives in the redalert  
It lives in the power game  
Its easy to take to heart  
But harder to tame  
This is the nature of the beast  
This is the nature  
This is the nature of the beast  
This is the nature  
Without all this heat  
Theyll be dancing west to east  
This is the nature of the beast  
It is the glowing in his eyes  
It is the reason for his lies  
Oh how many know youre there  
Oh how many play your game  
Hes always the man to dare  
Youre always to blame  
It is the need to understand  
Oh it is the trigger in his hand  
It lives in the uniform  
It grows from the need to gain  
With faces so old and torn  
Its calling your name  
This is the nature of the beast  
This is the nature  
This is the nature of the beast  
This is the nature  
Without all this heat  
Theyll be dancing west to east  
This is the nature of the beast  
It lives in the redalert  
It lives in the power game  
Its easy to take to heart  
But harder to tame  
This is the nature of the beast  
This is the nature  
This is the nature of the beast  
This is the nature  
Without all this heat  
Theyll be dancing west to east  
This is the nature of the beast  
This is the nature of the beast  
This is the nature  
This is the nature of the beast  
This is the nature  
This is the nature of the beast  
This is the nature  
This is the nature of the beast  
This is the nature
