The other side of The Mountain  
Is where I want to be  
Its a far piece over The Mountain  
But I hope youll go with me  
  
I grew up as a dreamer  
I found that dreams arent free  
Now I want you here with me  
  
Ive lived so long near the mountain  
Its almost part of me  
I want to have it behind me  
It blocks out all I can see  
It looms up dark and ancient  
Its shadow over me  
I want it behind me  
  
All that time all that precious time  
Its gone from you and me  
Were givin up this scene  
Were givin up this scene  
  
Now some will say that were destined  
Some will call it fate  
Me I call it obsession  
Its just like love and hate  
Were prisoners of our passion  
We all seem to find too late  
I hope its not too late  
Were givin up this scene  
Ah babe were givin up this scene  
  
Were gettin out  
Were givin up this scene  
You and me baby  
Yeah were givin up this scene  
You and me baby  
Yeah were givin up this scene
