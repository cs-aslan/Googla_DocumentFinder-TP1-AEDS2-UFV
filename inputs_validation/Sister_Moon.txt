Sister moon will be my guide  
In your blue blue shadows I would hide  
All good people asleep tonight  
Im all by myself in your silver light  
I would gaze at your face the whole night through  
Id go out of my mind but for you  
Id go out of my mind but for you  
  
Lying in a mothers arms  
The primal root of a womans charms  
Im a stranger to the sun  
My eyes are too weak  
How cold is a heart  
When its warmth that he seeks  
You watch every night you dont care what I do  
Id go out of my mind but for you  
Id go out of my mind but for you  
  
My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun  
My hunger for her explains everything Ive done  
To howl at the moon the whole night through  
And they really dont care if I do  
Id go out of my mind for you  
  
Sister moon
