336 its cold I know Im growing old  
With lifes best side on the downward slope  
Its in my own hands I know Ill cope  
My girls with me and all my friends can see  
  
Here I am again  
Early morning cold taxi  
Early morning cold taxi  
  
Done it before do it again  
Know from experience its not in vain  
Shes the best Ive had I cannot see what someone else can do to me  
Its a long way home but loves so warm youll see  
  
Here I am again  
Early morning cold taxi  
Early morning cold taxi  
  
Early morning cold taxi  
Each time I do it I feel so down and out  
Early morning cold taxi  
Though my mind thinks strange Ill keep on no doubt  
  
336 its cold I know Im growing old  
One day well be wed  
This I know for its what she said  
Then no more will my mind be uneasy
