I like Charlie Daniels and  
I love big John Cash  
And I think Waylon Woktosha Jennings  
Is a table thumpin smash  
Playin with Marshall Tucker Band  
Was as good as smokin grass  
But if you dont like Hank Williams  
You can kiss our ass  
  
Cause I think what they done  
Is well worth doin  
And their doin it the  
Best way that they can  
Oh youre the only one  
That you are screwin  
When you put down what  
You dont understand  
  
I love all them Allman Brothers  
Merle Haggard and George Jones  
Shotgun Willie Nelson and them  
Rockin rollin Stones  
Everything the Eagles do  
And Im in love with Linda Rondstat  
Anybody that dont like Hank Williams  
You can kiss our ass  
  
Cause I think what they done  
Is well worth doin  
And their doin it the  
Best way that they can  
Oh youre the only one  
That you are screwin  
When you put down what  
You dont understand  
  
I aint sayin that he was  
The first or the last  
But if you dont like Hank Williams  
You can kiss our ass
