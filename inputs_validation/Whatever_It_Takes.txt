Well Ive been drawing little hearts in the morning paper  
Lookin for a house an a couple of acres  
Youll be mine some time sooner or later and I cant wait  
  
Like a busy ol bee savin up its honey  
Honey Im savin up all my money  
To have you Ill do anything I have to whatever it takes  
  
Whatever it takes to win your love  
I hire me an airplane have it paint your name up in the sky above  
I tell the world Im yours put it on a billboard out on the interstate  
If it takes forever to get us together  
Honey Ill do whatever it takes  
  
Well Ive been yellin your name from a lookout mountain  
Tossing my pennies in a downtown fountain  
Makin my wishes Im hopin theyre countin for loves sake  
  
I swim upstream in a ragin river  
Walk through fire do you get the picture  
I swear I bare anything to get there Whatever it takes  
  
Whatever it takes to win your love  
I hire me an airplane have it paint your name up in the sky above  
I tell the world Im yours put it on a billboard out on the interstate  
If it takes forever to get us together  
Honey Ill do whatever it takes  
  
Whatever it takes to win your love  
I hire me an airplane have it paint your name up in the sky above  
Yeah I tell the world Im yours put it on a billboard out on the interstate  
If it takes forever to get us together  
Honey Ill do whatever it takes  
Well if it takes forever to get us together  
Honey Ill do whatever it takes
