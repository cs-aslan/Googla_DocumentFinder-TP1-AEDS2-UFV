Verse 1 Drake  
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it do not make it  
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum  
They do they do  
And I like to finish what you think you started  
Man you boys just got to Hollywood you boys just started  
You dont know what you just started  
All I do is hang with the young and heartless  
All this for my family man I try my hardest  
Its all I ever did and look where it got him  
Yeah youve been on my mind lately  
Youve still got my number girl you need to call me  
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way  
But you know I always handle that one my way  
Girl let me rock rock rock rock rock your body  
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway  
I cant trust no fuckin body  
They still out to get me cause they never got me  
  
Verse 2 Drake  
They still out to get me I dont get it  
I can not be got and thats a given  
Give a real nigga the number one  
Even though I got like twentyone  
Cannot be me Im a oneofone  
Schooling your ass like 101  
They been out here tryna slide on me  
They been out here telling lies on me  
Everybody looking out for themself  
But they still got they eyes on me  
See me putting in the hard work now aye  
Momma doesnt have to call work now aye  
I decide when I start work now aye  
Problems hit the gym they all work out  
MVP MVP ohnine all the way to sixteen  
Even next season looking like a breeze  
Lot of yall aint built for the league yeah  
Trade you off the team while you in your sleep yeah  
Yall showed me that nothings guaranteed  
And you dont know what you started  
My friends chain so big that he look like the artist  
I cant trust no fuckin body  
They still out to get me cause they never got me
