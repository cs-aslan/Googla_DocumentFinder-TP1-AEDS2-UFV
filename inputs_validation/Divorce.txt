I know just what your thinking  
You want someone to blame  
I know you well cause  
I always feel the same  
  
We always look behind  
We always look behind  
day in day out  
The world is my witness  
Sick from my cultures sickness  
Wish it would all go away  
You feel the same  
We always look behind  
We always look behind  
I want to slow my mind down  
  
Something tells me  
its my cross to bear  
You cant reach me  
you were never there  
Its like water  
under a bridge now  
Ive looked a thousand times  
We always look behind  
We always look behind  
day in day out
