I survived a dreadful accident  
In the car crash of the century  
My shattered hopes collapsed on cold cement  
But in the back of the ambulance Id never felt so content  
A highspeed collision gave a new sense of sight to me  
And now my vision can render the scene  
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris  
Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency  
  
Da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da  
  
I tossed and turned in sterile apathy  
Until the violets arrived for me  
The bouquet burst and blossoms filled the room  
And the police got smaller as they grew taller  
And taught me to bloom  
A highspeed collision gave a new sense of sight to me  
And now my vision can render the scene  
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris  
Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency  
The curtains decayed the daylight poured in  
I was never afraid of the darkness again  
My burns were third degree  
  
But Id been set free  
Cause grace had finally found its way to me  
A highspeed collision gave a new sense of sight to me  
And now my vision can render the scene  
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris  
Happiness returned to me  
  
Da da da da da da  
Happiness returned to me  
Da da da da da da  
Happiness returned to me  
Through a grave emergency  
Da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da  
Through a grave emergency  
Da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da  
Happiness returned to me  
Through a grave emergency
