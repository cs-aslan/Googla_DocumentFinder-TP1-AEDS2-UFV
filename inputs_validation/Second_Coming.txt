God damn man these radio station be buggin  
Man its three oclock in the mornin damn  
This hiphop shit just keep  
Damn we got to slow this shit down man ya know what I mean  
  
Fiends were never waiting in the hill  
They ran one step ahead  
But the jiggy was always there  
  
Upon the project pavement  
There was death enslavement of the mind  
Single mothers are filled with stress  
  
As I lay there with my baby  
We would look from the window and cry  
Then suddenly in the sky  
  
Between the new world ages  
We were blessed and WuTang fills the ear  
With the melody of a train Lord is suddenly here  
  
False MCs are melting  
In the dark all the weak LPs are  
going down  
  
God released the tape out early May  
And I dont think the world can take it  
Cause it took so long to make it  
And the hiphop gamell never be the same  
  
WuTang WuTang WuTang  
  
Upon the project pavement  
There was death enslavement of the mind  
Single mothers are filled with stress  
  
Between the new world ages  
We were blessed and WuTang fills the air  
With the knowledge that God possess  
  
As I lay there with my baby  
We would look from the window and cry  
Then the WuTang sign appears in the sky  
  
Billboards started melting  
In the dark all the weak MCs are  
Going down  
  
God released the tape of Earthly pain  
  
And I dont think the world can take it  
Cause it took so long to make it  
And the hiphop gamell never be the same  
  
And I dont think the world can take it  
Cause it took so long to make it  
And the hiphop gamell never be the same  
  
WuTang WuTang WuTang  
  
WuTang
