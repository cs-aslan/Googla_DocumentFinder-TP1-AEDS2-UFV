I read about how youre slow with the truth  
Like any old Aesops Fable  
But when youre turtleesque Im a hares breath  
Into payment under the table  
But some journalist got his mug shot kit  
And his briefcase on his lap  
But Im tired of being linked with the KGB  
And all that political crap  
  
Cause Ive seen your fascist faces  
On the cover of the national papers  
Staring out in black and white  
From the tall gray walls on the other side  
When I see your fascist faces  
Then I know Ive had enough  
Trying to trace it or erase it  
Is it foolproof or a bluff  
  
If the boy had been blessed hed have been arrested  
On a charge of wearing red shoes  
But if your pants are blue you got nothing to lose  
Itll make you a patriot through and through
