By Bob Dylan  
  
Well if I had to do it all over again  
Babe Id do it all over you  
And if I had to wait for ten thousand years  
Babe Id even do that too  
Well a dogs got his bone in the alley  
A cat shes got nine lives  
A millionaires got a million dollars  
King Sauds got four hundred wives  
Well evrybodys got somethin  
That theyre lookin forward to  
Im lookin forward to when I can do it all again  
And babe Ill do it all over you  
  
Well if I had my way tomorrow or today  
Babe Id run circles all around  
Id jump up in the wind do a somersault and spin  
Id even dance a jig on the ground  
Well everybody gets their hour  
Everybody gets their time  
Little David when he picked up his pebbles  
Even Sampson after he went blind  
Well everybody gets the chance  
To do what they want to do  
When my time arrives you better run for your life  
Cause babe Ill do it all over you  
  
Well I dont need no money I just need a day thats sunny  
Baby and my days are gonna come  
And I grab me a pint you know that Im a giant  
When you hear me yellin Feefifofum  
Well you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle  
You made me to a walkin wreck  
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone  
Then you knocked off my head from my neck  
Well if Im ever standin steady  
Adoin what I want to do  
Well I tell you little lover that you better run for cover  
Cause babe Ill do it all over you  
  
Im just restin at your gate so that I wont be late  
And momma Im ajust sittin on the shelf  
Look out your window fair and youll see me squattin there  
Just afumblin and amumblin to myself  
Well after my cigarettes been smoked up  
After all my liquors been drunk  
After my dreams are dreamed out  
After all my thoughts have been thunk  
Well after I do some of these things  
Im gonna do what I have to do  
And I tell you on the side that you better run and hide  
Cause babe Ill do it all over you
