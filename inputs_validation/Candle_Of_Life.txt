Something you cant hide  
Says youre lonely  
Hidden deep inside  
Of you only  
Its there for you to see  
Take a look and be  
Burn slowly the candle of life  
  
Something there outside  
Says were only  
In the hands of time  
Falling slowly  
Its there for us to know  
With love that we can go  
Burn slowly the candle of life  
  
So love everybody  
And make them your friend  
So love everybody  
And make them your friend  
  
Something you cant hide  
Says youre lonely  
Hidden deep inside  
Of you only  
Its there for you to see  
Take a look and be  
Burn slowly the candle of life  
  
Something there outside  
Says were only  
In the hands of time  
Falling slowly  
Its there for us to know  
With love that we can go  
Burn slowly the candle of life
