You know I hate it when you put your hand inside my head Warren sings
stick  
And switch all my priorities around  
Why dont you go pick on someone your own size instead  
Go on without me Ill just slow you down  
Go on without me Ill just slow you down  
You always say you know me somehow I dont think you do  
Maybe you should buy another vowel  
Youre jumping to conclusions so I cant keep up with you  
Go on without me Ill just slow you down  
Ill just hold you up  
When I fall behind  
Ill just throw your schedule off  
So you get going if youre so inclined  
You know I hate it when you put your hand inside my head  
And switch all my priorities around  
You think youre pretty tricky but youre simply overbred  
Go on without me Ill just slow you down  
Go on  
Go on  
Go on  
Go on
