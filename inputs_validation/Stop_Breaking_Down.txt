Some pretty mama she starts  
Breakin down  
Stop breakin down  
Woo stop breakin down  
The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out  
Well itll make you lose your mind  
  
You Saturday night women  
You love to  
Ape and crown  
You wont do nothin but tear good mans  
Reputation down  
Stop breakin down  
Woo stop breakin down  
The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out  
Well itll make you lose your mind  
  
I gave my baby  
The ninetyninth degree  
Shed just love to throw a pistol  
Down on me  
Stop breakin down  
Hey stop breakindown  
The stuff I got is gonna bust you brains out  
Well itll make you lose your mind
