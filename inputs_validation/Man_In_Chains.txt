Ive only myself to blame  
Now that Im tangled up in chains  
So you say ooh so you say  
Caught in this human cage  
Trapped and Im fired up with rage  
And somebodys got to pay  
I can never talk about it  
I can never say what I want to say  
So Ill take your tip and Ill bite my lip  
And hope it goes away  
You say Im a man of straw  
Well baby Im gonna break your law  
Then its war ooh yes its war  
Love on a thin white line  
Love that was just a waste of time  
Oh not anymore  
I can feel it coming at me  
I can feel it coming like the wind  
But Im locked away and Im bound to stay  
So no one can get in  
Im a man in chains Im a man in chains  
Oh Im a man in chains Im a man in chains  
I only pray that before I die  
Just like a phoenix I will rise and fly  
Tell me whos to blame  
Oh Im a man now Im a man in chains  
There must be a reason why  
Youre pulling the wool down on my eyes  
Its a lie its a lie  
Dragging this ball and chain  
Oh how long can I take this pain  
But somebody has to try yeah  
Oh I can feel the pressure on me  
I can feel it taking me from the start  
Sticks and stones will smash my bones  
But never break my heart  
Im a man in chains Im a man in chains  
Oh Im a man in chains Im a man in chains  
I only pray that before I die  
Just like a phoenix I will rise and fly  
Tell me whos to blame  
Oh Im a man now Im a man in chains  
I can never talk about it  
Oh I can never say what I want to say  
So Ill take your tip and Ill bite my lip  
And hope it goes away  
Im a man in chains Im a man in chains  
Oh Im a man in chains Im a man in chains  
I only pray that before I die  
Just like a phoenix I will rise and fly  
Tell me whos to blame  
Oh Im a man now Im a man in chains
