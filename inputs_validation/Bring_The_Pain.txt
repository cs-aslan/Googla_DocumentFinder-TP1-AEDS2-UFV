I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain  
Lets go inside my astral plane  
Find out my metals based on instrumental  
Record hey so I can write monumental  
  
Methods Im not the king  
But niggas is decay I stick em for the cream  
Check it just how deep can shit get  
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad fish accept it  
  
In your cross color clothes youve crossed over  
Then got totally crossed out and Kris Cross  
Who the boss Niggaz get tossed to the side  
And Im the dark side of the force  
  
Of course its the Method Man from the Wu Tang Clan  
I be hectic and comin for the head piece protect it  
Fuck it two tears in a bucket niggas want the ruckus  
Bustin at me bruh now bust it styles I gets buck wild  
  
Method Man on some shit pullin niggas files  
Im sick insane crazy drivin Miss Daisy  
Out her fuckin mind now I got mine Im Swayze  
  
Is it real son is it really real son  
Let me know its real son if its really real  
Something I could feel son load it up and kill one  
Want it raw deal son if its really real  
  
And when I was a lil stereo  
Stereo  
I listened to some champion  
Champion  
I always wondered  
Wondered  
Will now I be the numba one  
Yo  
  
Now you listen to the Gorgon  
Gorgon  
And the Gorgon summary  
Yo  
And any man that come test me  
Test me  
Me wanna lick out them brains  
Its that why
