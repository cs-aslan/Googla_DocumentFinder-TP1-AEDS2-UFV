Hey there sugar baby  
Saw you twice at the pop show  
You taste just like glitter mixed with rock and roll  
I like you a lot lot  
Think youre really hot hot  
  
I know you think youre special  
When we dance real crazy  
Glamaphonic electronic disco baby  
I like you a lot lot  
All we want is hot hot  
  
Chorus  
Boys boys boys  
We like boys in cars  
Boys boys boys  
Buy us drinks in bars  
Boys boys boys  
With hairspray and denim  
Boys boys boys  
We love them We love them  
  
Oh oh  
  
Baby is a bad boy with some retro sneakers  
Lets go see The Killers and make out in the bleachers  
I like you a lot lot think youre really hot hot  
Lets go to the party heard our buddys the DJ  
Dont forget my lipstick I left it in your ashtray  
I like you a lot lot all we want is hot hot  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Im not loose I like to party  
Lets get lost in your Ferrari  
Not psychotic or dramatic  
I like boys and that is that  
Love it when you call me legs  
In the morning buy me eggs  
Watch your heart when were together  
Boys like you love me forever  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Chorus x3
