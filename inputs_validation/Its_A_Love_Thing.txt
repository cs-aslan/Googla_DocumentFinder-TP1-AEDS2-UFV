Yeah yeah  
Oh its a love thing  
  
I been working all day long  
And Im ready to come on home to you mm mm  
All the other guys roll their eyes  
And dont realize its what I want to do  
Its what I want to do  
They say Im wrapped around your finger  
But they dont understand  
That what we got is more than just a diamond  
On your hand  
  
Baby its a love thing whoa  
Baby its a love thing yeah  
  
Sure I could hang around and complain about  
The way things ought to be  
Yeah theres trouble in the world  
But youre the girl  
Whose open arms are all I really need  
And thats why I come runnin  
To be there by your side  
To let em call me crazy  
But it cant be denied  
  
Baby its a love thing whoa  
Ah baby its a love thing yeah  
  
And its not about the same last name

Its how you make me feel inside  
And the way you hold me every night  
  
Its a love thing whoa  
Oh baby its a love thing yeah  
  
Here we go now

They say Im wrapped around your finger  
But they dont understand  
That what we got is more than just a diamond  
On your hand  
Baby its a love thing whoa  
Oh baby its a love thing yeah  
Come on its a love thing whoa
