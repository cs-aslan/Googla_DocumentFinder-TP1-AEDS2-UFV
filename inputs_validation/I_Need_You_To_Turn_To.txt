Youre not a ship to carry my life  
You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights  
Ive strayed from the cottages and found myself here  
For I need your love your love protects my fears  
  
And I wonder sometimes and I know Im unkind  
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind  
And I need you to turn to when I lose control  
Youre my guardian angel who keeps out the cold  
  
Did you paint your smile on well I said I knew  
That my reason for living was for loving you  
Were related in feeling but youre high above  
Youre pure and youre gentle with the grace of a dove
