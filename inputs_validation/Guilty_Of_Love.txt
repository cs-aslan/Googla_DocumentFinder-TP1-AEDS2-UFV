I believe my love for you  
Is a love that will last forever  
An Im here to testify  
Im a prisoner of your heart  
Baby dont you believe  
When I tell you I love you  
That I really mean it  
Dont you walk away  
Dont you turn your back on me  
  
Im guilty of love  
Its a crime of passion  
Guilty of love  
An theres no doubt about it  
No doubt about it  
  
Im guilty of love  
Im guilty of love  
Im guilty  
In the first degree  
Guilty of love  
Im guilty of love  
Im guilty  
In the first degree  
  
I can never forget the times  
When I took what you gave me for granted  
So I stand accused  
An I plead guilty to the crime  
You can lock me away if you want  
Just as long as your arms are around me  
An I wont mind  
If you just throw away the key  
  
Im guilty of love  
Its a crime of passion  
Guilty of love  
An theres no doubt about it  
No doubt about it  
  
Guilty of love  
Im guilty of love  
Im guilty  
In the first degree  
Guilty of love  
Im guilty of love  
Im guilty  
In the first degree  
  
Guilty of love

Its a crime of passion  
Guilty of love  
An theres no doubt about it  
No doubt about it  
  
Guilty of love

Guilty of love
