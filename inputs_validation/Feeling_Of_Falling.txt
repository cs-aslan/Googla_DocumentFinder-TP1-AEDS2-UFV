Sometimes I miss that feelin of fallin  
Fallin on over the ledge  
You know I miss that feelin of fallin  
Fallin on over the ledge  
And when my mind it gets to worryin  
And I just cant get no rest oh baby oh  
Thats when I call you up instead  
After midnight baby  
Sittin here all alone  
I tried to call your number baby  
But you werent at home  
Ive been a good girl baby  
Im through with all that mess  
But the way Im feeling right now darlin  
You know it scares me half to death  
That I miss that feelin of  
Fallin on over the ledge  
The summer night in Texas baby  
Its too hot and wet to sleep  
I heard you pull up in the distance  
Youre comin to give me relief  
We went screamin down the highway baby  
So much faster than we should  
You pulled me over in the moonlight darlin  
Man I still can feel that hood  
And I miss that feelin  
Oh I wanna fall on over the ledge  
When that rain start fallin I wanna call baby  
I wanna take a real good look at that ledge  
It aint something you get over  
You might think you made it through  
You can turn your head and walk away baby  
But it never takes its eyes off of you and  
Itll push your foot right through the floor board baby  
Make you cut them streamers down and back  
You waste whats precious and you cant afford baby  
It runs your life right off the track  
Itll keep you boilin in that poison  
Only the truly twisted know so well  
You dont need drugs to show you heaven baby  
Cause theres plenty clean in hell  
Id miss that feelin of fallin  
Oh on over the ledge  
Yeah the blues start callin  
Incomprehensible  
Break it down  
Incomprehensible baby  
Oh baby Im gonna crawl  
Crawl into your arm now  
Into your arm now
