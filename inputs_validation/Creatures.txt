I need it  
The sex skin habit  
You could just crawl out  
And forget Im here  
  
I need it  
Love and something  
Id just as soon forget  
So keep it out the papers  
  
I need it  
The sex musicians  
Ill show you something  
While the boys beat time  
  
I need it  
And shes still waiting  
We like to wake up  
In a strange bed romance  
  
One more time for me  
You are the young things fed on garbage and lies  
Please one more time for me  
You are the young things fed on garbage and lies  
Im talking far too much about my shame  
  
I need it  
Creatures calling  
Ill tear my heart out  
But I need some more  
  
I need it  
Im under pressure  
I dont remember  
If her storys true
