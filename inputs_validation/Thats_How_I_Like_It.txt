Let me tell ya  
Where I come from its bix and gravy not champagne caviar  
Got pickup trucks aint no mercedes thats who we are  
Oh Yeah wouldnt change a thing  
I aint no saint sometimes a sinner and I cant tell you why  
But I get up every mornin and thank the man above  
Oh my life is good lemme tell ya how good  
  
Chorus  
Like my women hot and my beer ice cold real fast car and my whiskey old  
I can slow drive down an old dirt road thats how I like it  
I can turn my music way up loud aint nothin better than the sound of a
crowd  
American flag it makes me proud thats how I like it  
  
Listen now aint no cell phone towers you wont catch me online  
Workin with my hands for hours thats how I spend my time  
I wont stand in line for coffee it aint my cup of tea  
Out here in the country we got everything we need oh  
  
Chorus x2
