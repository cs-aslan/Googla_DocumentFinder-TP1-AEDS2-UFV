I like to play Hank Williams Jr records just as loud as they will go  
Im into Lynyrd Skynyrd  
The Allman Brothers and David Allan Coe  
I like Willie Waylon George and Merle  
And a lot of ZZ Top  
They play country soul rock and roll  
I really like Kid Rock  
  
Chorus  
And Im a redneck  
A rocknroll son of the south  
I dont like no new wave disco bands around  
Im gonna drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
Im a long haired redneck rocknroll son of the south  
  
Ive got a 1965 Harley chopper  
It sure makes those women stare  
A dead flamingo wrapped around the cowboy hats I wear  
I can cuss I can fight I can spit I can belch I can raise all kinds of hell  
If you ride to live like I live to ride let me hear some rebel yells  
  
Chorus  
And Im a redneck  
A rocknroll son of the south  
I dont like no new wave disco bands around  
Im gonna drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
Im a long haired redneck rocknroll son of the south  
  
I like my whiskey straight up  
Daqueri just makes me ill  
If someone touches my cowboy hat I get mad enough to kill  
I got a rifle rack in my pickup truck  
Im a four wheelin maniac  
And if you want to race name the place  
Ill show you where its at mother fucker  
  
Chorus  
And Im a redneck  
A rocknroll son of the south  
I dont like no new wave disco bands around  
Im gonna drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
Im a long haired redneck rocknroll son of the south  
  
Im a long haired redneck rocknroll son of the south  
Im a long haired redneck rocknroll son of the south
