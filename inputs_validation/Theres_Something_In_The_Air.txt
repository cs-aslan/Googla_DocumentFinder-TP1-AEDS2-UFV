I know I know your love  
Is like the ocean  
I know for sure your head is in the clouds my love  
Oh I know your love is like a sweet devotion  
Baby baby tell me tell me whats love is all about  
  
Theres something in the air  
Oh bebebaby your love is so unfair  
Oh bebebaby  
Theres something in the air something in the air  
Baby but your love is crazy baby I dont care  
Theres something in the air tonight  
  
Baby but your love will make it always right  
Baby theres something in the air tonight  
Oh I can feel it  
I know we make a night we will remember oh no  
I know we turn the night in million days my love  
I know for sure it like summer in December  
Baby baby nobody knows where is the perfect way
