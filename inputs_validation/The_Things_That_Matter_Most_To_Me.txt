THE THINGS THAT MATTER MOST TO ME  
WRITERS DON PITTMAN BILL TAYLOR THOMAS LAVERNE  
Yes there are many precious memries that Id like to recall  
And there are some things that I would surely like to forget  
Ive been up Lord Ive been down and sometimes just in between  
But you know something neighbors I havent reached to my highest mountain yet  
Yes I know Gods bless me time and time and time and time again  
And these blessings for exceeding my deepest woe  
Ive had the help of loved ones and many friends who stood by me  
And without their favor I would have given up a long long time ago  
I remember my boyhood days back in Faraday Louisiana  
The long hot summer and that cool Louisiana rain  
You know sometimes I wish I could go back and relive yesterday  
Oh Lord and for a while be mamas little boy again  
You know folks the things that matter most in this old world money just cant
buy  
Sweet love precious memries that will live on and on and on  
And I remember Lord when I stumble sometimes fall I wonder why  
Then Ill then Ill never never never walk alone  
Yes these are the things that matter most to me  
Precious memries from your friend Jerry Lee
