Dont want to be an American idiot  
Dont want a nation under the new media  
And can you hear the sound of hysteria  
The subliminal mindfuck America  
  
Welcome to a new kind of tension  
All across the alien nation  
Where everything isnt meant to be okay  
Television dreams of tomorrow  
Were not the ones whore meant to follow  
For thats enough to argue  
  
Well maybe Im the faggot America  
Im not a part of a redneck agenda  
Now everybody do the propaganda  
And sing along to the age of paranoia  
  
Welcome to a new kind of tension  
All across the alien nation  
Where everything isnt meant to be okay  
Television dreams of tomorrow  
Were not the ones whore meant to follow  
For thats enough to argue  
  
Dont want to be an American idiot  
One nation controlled by the media  
Information Age of hysteria  
Its calling out to idiot America  
  
Welcome to a new kind of tension  
All across the alien nation  
Where everything isnt meant to be okay  
Television dreams of tomorrow  
Were not the ones whore meant to follow  
For thats enough to argue
