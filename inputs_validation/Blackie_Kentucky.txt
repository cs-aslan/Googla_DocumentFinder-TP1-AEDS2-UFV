Dolly Parton  
In my home town of Blackie Kentucky  
He came passin through one dark gloomy day  
And I considered myself as lucky  
When he told me he would take me away  
And though he was older it made me no difference  
His promise of riches was all I could see  
At last I could leave the coal mines of Kentucky  
And know something better than sad poverty  
Blackie Kentucky you know that Ill miss you  
But there are other places in the world Id like to see  
So I must take this chance to be somethin more than nothin  
But Ill always hold you in my memory  
But Ive never adjusted to sociable livin  
The friends that he knows theyre all strangers to me  
Thousands of miles from Blackie Kentucky  
In a mansion with a husband that never loved me  
He wont let my family and friends come to visit  
Because they are country and poor hes ashamed  
Oh but Id give my life Lord if I could just go see them  
All thats changed about me is my name  
Blackie Kentucky oh Lord how I miss you  
If I could come back home Id never leave you anymore  
Id like to see my poor hardworking coalminin Daddy  
And Mama and the kids and the friends I knew before  
My world is as black as the coal in Kentucky  
He wont let me leave him  theres no way to win  
Ill take my own life dear God please forgive me  
But Ive got to get back home to Blackie once again  
An Ive left him a note in the mornin hell find it  
Its my last request and he cant refuse me  
Ive told him to bury me back in Blackie Kentucky  
Where my family and my friends can come and visit me  
Blackie Kentucky Im comin home to you  
But different from the way you remember me before  
So make me a place and Ill lay me down to rest  
And Ill sleep in your arms forevermore  
Ill sleep in your arms forever more
