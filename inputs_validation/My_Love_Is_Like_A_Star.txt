The space in between us  
Starts to feel like the worlds apart  
Like Im going crazy  
And you say its raining in your heart  
Youre telling me nobodys there  
To try and fly  
Oh but thats just crazy  
Cause baby I told ya Im here for good  
  
My loves like a star yeah  
You cant always see me  
But you know that Im always there  
When you see one shining  
Take it as mine  
And remember Im always near  
If you see a comet  
Baby Im on it  
Making my way back home  
Just follow the glow yeah  
It wont be long  
Just know that youre not alone  
  
I tried to build the walls  
To keep you safe when Im not around  
But as soon as Im away from you  
You say they come tumbling down  
But its not about the time  
That we dont get to spend together  
Its about how strong our love is  
When Im gone and it feels like forever  
  
My loves like a star yeah  
You cant always see me  
But you know that Im always there  
When you see one shining  
Take it as mine  
And remember Im always near  
If you see a comet  
Baby Im on it  
Making my way back home  
Just follow the glow yeah  
It wont be long  
Just know that youre not alone  
  
You say that time away makes your heart grow out  
But I can stay just to prove you wrong  
Oh look at how far weve come  
Dont you know  
Dont know that youre the one  
  
My loves like a star yeah  
You cant always see me  
But you know that Im always there  
When you see one shining  
Take it as mine  
And remember Im always near  
If you see a comet  
Baby Im on it  
Making my way back home  
Just follow the glow yeah  
It wont be long  
Just know that youre not alone
