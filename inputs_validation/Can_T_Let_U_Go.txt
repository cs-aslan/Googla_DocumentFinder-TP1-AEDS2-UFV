Yo shit  
Im sick of this man  
I cant even take no more  
Cause I hate the fact that I love you so much  
  
And you know what Im sayin  
You dont even understand what this is doin to me  
Everytime I try to get away  
  
I just cant let you go you know what Im sayin  
I just cant let you go  
I never ever want to hurt you  
I just wanna to love ya  
I just wanna to sex ya up  
  
Want to give you everything you need  
Things you want just lay down  
Let me love ya all night long  
I dont wanna to leave ya I just wanna to keep ya  
  
When they saw me they saw you  
Damn the world its just me and my girl  
Thats how I felt every time I thought it was right  
It went left  
  
We used to love and party  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I dont want you no more  
But I cant let you go  
  
So much love and hurt  
And hate people screaming it wont work  
Time and time I say Im gonna leave  
But I cant let you go  
  
This aint funny man you know what man  
You aint even got to wait till in the mornin man  
You can get out of here at night man  
Ahyo clear go rap go shit get out of here   
  
Baby you not gonna like me  
But you not gonna fight me  
You can walk away and say  
I never gave you everything you want thing you need  
  
All we ever do is argue all night long  
I dont want to leave you see you  
With another brother lovin ya sayin  
Damn the world its just me and my girl  
  
Thats how I feel  
When you think everything is real  
But it really aint  
We used to love and party  
  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I dont want you no more  
But I cant let you go  
So much love and hurt  
  
And hate people screaming it wont work  
Time to time I say Im gonna leave  
But I cant let you go  
We used to love and party  
  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I dont want you no more  
But I cant let you go  
So much love and hurt  
  
And hate people screaming it wont work  
Time to time I say Im gonna leave  
But I cant let you go  
  
JD  
Got me walkin around ready to snap  
Got me walkin around lookin for somebody to slap  
Got me goin goin with no pause   
Got me up in Cartier every day just cause  
Got me arguin about little stuff  
  
She dont call lil stuff  
When it get a little rough  
We me kiss and make up  
She want to say what she want to I dont play that  
She want to constantly bring up shit from way back  
  
Got me thinkin about her while Im watchin a flick  
Got me dippin through traffic tryin to get home quick  
Got me talkin to myself Im hatin this  
Got me wantin to wild out like Im Jadakiss  
Got me in a place I never thought I would see  
Got me not wantin to stay and not wantin to leave  
Got me happy  
Got me confused  
Got me wishin I could get it how I used to  
  
We used to love and party  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I dont want you no more  
But I cant let you go  
  
So much love and hurt  
And hate people screaming it wont work  
Time to time I say Im gonna leave  
But I cant let you go  
  
We used to love and party  
Now all we do is argue  
I tell myself I dont want you no more  
But I cant let you go  
  
So much love and hurt  
And hate people screaming it wont work  
Time to time I say Im gonna leave  
But I cant let you go
