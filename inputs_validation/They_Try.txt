Nobody thought that wed last as long as we have  
I guess we showed em  
Now I dont mean to brag  
Were pretty good at keepin what we got goin  
  
I guess we beat the odds  
Hey how bout us  
  
In this crazy world of mirrors and smoke  
Where hearts can get broke and forevers so hard to find  
People still dream and people still hope  
That someday theyll get it right  
A love like yours and mine is why they try  
  
You know Ill kiss you downtown  
Right there on your mouth with everyone staring  
I dont mind if they see just what you mean to me  
Girl thats something worth sharing  
  
Loves a beautiful thing  
Hey let it catch on  
  
In this crazy world of mirrors and smoke  
Where hearts can get broke and forevers so hard to find  
People still dream and people still hope  
That someday theyll get it right  
A love like yours and mine is why they try they try baby  
  
Our best days are up ahead  
Girl we aint done yet  
No far from it  
  
In this crazy world in this crazy world of mirrors and smoke  
Where hearts can get broke and forevers so hard to find  
People still dream and people still hope  
That someday theyll get it right  
A love like yours and mine is why they try  
They try they try
