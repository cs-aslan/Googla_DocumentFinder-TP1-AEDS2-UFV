The bars are crowded with wasted youth  
You just went you didnt know the truth  
You dont know that kid when you look back  
You remember the music paint it black  
  
You had a brother in the movement and he burned his card  
Hes got a job in the white house aint life hard  
You came back a hero on a stolen horse  
You say you dont fit in you cant stay the course  
  
I may be right dont care if Im wrong  
Its a veterans song  
I may be right dont care if Im wrong  
Its a veterans song  
  
The band paraded playing Oh gung ho  
Your country needs you youve got to go  
When you came over they said Soldier go back  
When you came home they put you on the rack  
  
Between agent orange and the jungle and fear  
Youre just surviving to get out of here  
You smoke some more herb and you keep your head down  
Could be your number is on the next round
