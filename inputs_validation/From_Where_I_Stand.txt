Oh Im drawn to you  
Like a burnin flame  
But somebodys waitin  
That bears my name  
Oh Lord knows Id love to love you  
Cause you know Im just a man  
But I cant  
Not from where I stand  
  
You see I made a promise  
When I put on that rign  
And I plan to kep it babe  
Its a sacred thing  
Well heaven knows Im tempted  
I hope you understand  
That I cant  
Not from where I stand  
  
Repeat x2  
Oh from where I stand  
Theres a golden band  
And I swear I couldnt stand  
To lose it all  
So I better run  
While I still can  
Cause I cant babe  
Not from where I stand  
  
No I cant not from where I stand  
Yeah not from where I stand
