Here it is again Monday morning  
And I really got the blues  
But it dont much matter  
I got no need to smile  
And I dont think I will for quit awhile  
  
CHORUS  
So it might as well stay Monday from now on  
Cause it seems that the only one I ever love is gone  
And it just might as well stay Monday from now on  
  
Go away mister sun I cant use you  
Brighten someone elses life  
Let the darkest hide me and carry off my pain  
For theres nothing you can do nothing you can do  
Nothing you can do to make things change  
  
Chorus  
  
Let the darkest hide me and carry off my pain  
For theres nothing you can do nothing you can do  
Nothing you can do to make things change  
And it might as well stay Monday from now on  
Might as well stay Monday from now on
