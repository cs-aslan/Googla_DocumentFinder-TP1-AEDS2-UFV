How Im feeling it doesnt matter  
Cause you know Im okay  
Instead I ask myself why do you hurt me  
When you know you know Im the same  
I know I know that you love me baby  
Theyre trying to take you away from me  
Only over my dead body  
  
I think I killed everybody in the game last year man fuck it I was on though  
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club mm  
Fuck it I was wrong though  
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free  
Nowadays its six figures when they tax me  
Oh well I guess you lose some and win some  
Long as the outcome is income  
You know I want it all and then some  
Shout out to Asian girls let the lights dim sum  
Shots came I dont know where they was sent from  
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from  
Yeah you know me well nigga  
Yeah I mean you aint the only real nigga  
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga  
Slave to the pussy but Im just playing the field nigga yeah  
Are these people really discussing my career again  
Asking if Ill be going platinum in a year again  
Dont I got the shit the world wanna hear again  
Dont Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in  
Man all of your flows bore me paint drying  
And I dont ever be trippin off of what aint mine  
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine  
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time  
Its been that way from the beginning  
I just been playing I aint even know that I was winning  
And this is the only sound you should fear  
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright  
  
Chorus  
I know I know that you love me baby  
Theyre trying to take you away from me  
Only over my dead body  
  
You say Im old news well who the new star  
Cause if Im going anywhere its probably too far  
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States  
Used half of the money to beat my brothers case  
Red wine over Fed time  
But shout out to the niggas thats doing dead time  
And shout out to the bitches there when its bedtime  
And fuck you to the niggas that think its their time  
Yeah dont make me take your life apart boy  
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy  
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin funny guy  
Dont make me break your Kevin heart boy  
Yeah its whatever You know feeling good living better  
I think maybe I was numb to it last year  
But you know I feel it now more than ever  
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay  
Second album Im back paving the way  
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon  
Like this was my comeback season back back in the day  
And I met your baby moms last night  
We took a picture together I hope she frames it  
And I was drinking at the Palms last night  
And ended up losing everything that I came with  
Feel like Ive been here before huh  
I still got ten years to go huh  
And this is the only sound you should fear  
These kids wear crowns over here  
And everything is all right  
  
Chorus
