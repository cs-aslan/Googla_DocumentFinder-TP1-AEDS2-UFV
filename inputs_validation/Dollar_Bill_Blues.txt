If I had a dollar bill  
Yes I believe I surely will  
Go to town and drink my fill  
Early in the morning  
  
Little darling shes a red haired thing  
Man she makes my legs to sing  
Gonna buy her a diamond ring  
Early in the morning  
  
Mother was a golden girl  
I slit her throat just to get her pearls  
Cast myself into a whirl  
Before a bunch of swine  
  
Its a long way down the Harlan road  
Busted back and a heavy load  
Wont get through to save my soul  
Early in the morning  
  
Ive always been a gambling man  
Ive rolled them bones with either hand  
Seven is the promised land  
Early in the morning  
  
Whiskeyd be my dying bed  
Tell me where to lay my head  
Not with me is all she said  
Early in the morning  
  
If I had a dollar bill  
Yes I believe I surely will  
Go to town and drink my fill  
Early in the morning
