Been watching so much TV  
Im thinner than I should be  
Im like a waterlogged ball  
That noone wants to kick around anymore  
An all day morning hairdo  
That no comb can get through  
Its all granola and beer  
A calling card and a silk cut souvenir  
I miss you like sleep  
And theres nothing romantic about the hours I keep  
The mornings when it starts  
I dont look so sharp  
Now I got a heavy heart  
  
I talk a lot about football  
And girls I kissed in grade four  
I piss off my friends  
Im digging a hole just staring at the floor  
Now every tshirts got a wine stain  
Im loving cigarettes again  
I know every tune about guys and girls  
And hurts and hearts and moans  
  
I miss you like sleep  
And theres nothing romantic about the hours I keep  
The mornings when it starts  
I dont look so good  
Now Ive got a heavy heart  
  
Its just a low rent paying palpitating pulp inside my shirt  
But theres a weight thats sitting  
So hard oh God it hurts  
Oh God it hurts  
  
Been watching so much TV  
Im thinner than I should be  
Im like a waterlogged ball  
That noone wants to kick around anymore  
  
I miss you like sleep  
And theres nothing romantic about the hours I keep  
The morning when it starts  
Oh my heavy heart
