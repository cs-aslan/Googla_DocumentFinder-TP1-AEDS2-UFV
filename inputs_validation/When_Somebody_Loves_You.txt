You you remember me  
Like I remember you  
To spend your life  
Go back in you life to the time  
  
I I walk the streets Alone  
I can feel you on my own  
Everyone can see that  
I really felt I Dont Know where youre at  
But Youre With Somebody Else  
  
Chorus  
Somebody wants you  
Somebody needs you  
Somebody dreams about you every single Night  
Somebody Cant Breathe  
Without You its Lonely  
Somebody hopes that someday you will see  
  
That somebodys me  
That somebodys me  
  
How How can we go on  
It was so good but now its gone  
I pray at night that Id pass someone nice  
And Ive Been so Lost  
You were always right here when I was  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge   
Youll Always be in my Life  
And if Im not your Life  
Youre in my Memory  
You You Remember Me  
And Before You Set Me Free  
Listen Please  
  
Chorus
