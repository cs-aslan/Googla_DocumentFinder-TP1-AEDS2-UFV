You know that lately people ask what Im  
Doin sittin home alone all by myself  
They know Im used to bein out and about and they  
Dont know just whats become of myself  
They say the swinger cant swing it no more  
But they dont know what Im hidin behind my door  
Because you know I know Ive never known nobody  
Nobody like you nobody to do what you do  
And when youre leavin poor me all alone  
You got me sittin here sufferin by my telephone  
I been left I been right  
And when Im wrong I know youre gonna make me  
See the light  
Because you know I know Ive never known nobody  
Nobody like you nobody like you  
White other people dancin romancin and chancin  
Their lives every saturday night  
Watchin TV drinkin tea her and me  
And maybe even have us a fight  
Cause an argument can be outta sight  
When you love to argue and you know how to fight  
I dont care about soul  
I dont even care about no rock and roll  
You know I dont care about nothin  
Nobody nobody but you
