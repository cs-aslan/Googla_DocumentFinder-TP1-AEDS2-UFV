Bonnie shades  
And a high top fade  
So low you know on the mic with no aid  
You didnt think in a blink no way  
  
That Id make the grade  
But now you say I use to go to school with him  
I use to go to dot dot bim  
I use to know his older brother  
  
I use to be his eighth grade lover  
Talk is cheap and the speech is weak  
He use to go with me wrong you were my freak  
I never gave a hoot  
  
If a girl was cute  
All I wanted was a piece and a knock the boots  
And then they get dissed  
Crossed off my list  
  
Though a bend in my behind would get kissed  
Just like so world the girls will go low  
Just like Jock Custoe  
And blow  
  
Up come my drawers see ya gotta go  
Its to plain  
Kid Rocks the name  
And I run my game  
  
From Frisco to Maine  
Never fell in love  
Cause Im a girl heartbreaker  
But still I built my skills and Im the  
  
Cause Im the

Stop the madness  
You never had this  
Wild style of my bboy badness  
Runnin the show  
  
Clockin the dough  
And Juliet get fucked if I was Romeo but Im not  
Im Kid Rock  
Flat top and all  
  
Not Michael Jackson spinnin singing off the wall  
But making everyone how I thump like thunder  
Got over like a mother  
While you went straight under  
  
And now you cant stand  
The way I jam  
Hold the mic in my hand  
And rock the whole land  
  
Man get jealous if you want to  
But either way Im gonna do what I have to do  
Cause I work to hard to make ends match  
Started from scrath  
  
And to a lot of crap  
But now Im like a wild horse no one can catch  
And Im a bad mother fucker  
Believe that  
  
Ill pop on top more flop no stop  
Makin every girl in the house want a piece of the rock  
And then Ill bring a new swing  
To make it understand the kids running things  
  
Mostly because Im not an MC faker  
And the rest because Im the
