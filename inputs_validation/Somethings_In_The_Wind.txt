Lately youve changed  
Acting so strange  
If somethings wrong  
Dont drag it on  
  
Cause each time I phone  
Youre never home  
Each time we meet out on the street  
You hardly speak  
  
Ooh baby somethings in the wind  
Ooh baby are we near the end  
I know baby somethings in the wind  
So why pretend  
  
Ooh baby somethings in the wind  
Ooh baby tell me what it is  
Something baby is blowing in the wind  
Out in the wind  
  
Nothing has changed  
Thats what you say  
So how come each date  
You turn up late  
  
You say Im wrong  
Your loves still strong  
So how come each kiss  
Means less and less  
  
Ooh baby somethings in the wind  
Ooh baby are we near the end  
I know baby somethings in the wind  
So why pretend  
  
Ooh baby somethings in the wind  
Ooh baby tell me what it is  
Somethings baby is blowing in the wind  
Out in the wind
