By Richard Thompson  
Greedy people take whats mine  
I can leave them all behind  
And they can never cross that line  
When I get to the border  
Sawbones standin at the door  
Waiting till I hit the floor  
He wont find me anymore  
When I get to the border  
CHORUS  
Monday morning Monday morning  
Closing in on me  
Im packin up and Im arunnin away  
To where nobody thinks of me  
If you see a box of pine  
With a name that looks like mine  
Say I drowned in a barrel of wine  
When I got to the border  
When I got to the border  
CHORUS  
A one way tickets in my hand  
Headed for the chosen land  
My troubles will all turn to sand  
When I get to the border  
A soft girl with yellow hair  
Waiting in that rockin chair  
And if Im weary I wont care  
When I get to the border  
CHORUS  
A dusty road that smells so sweet  
Paved with gold beneath my feet  
And Ill be dancing down the street  
When I get to the border  
When I get to the border  
CHORUS
