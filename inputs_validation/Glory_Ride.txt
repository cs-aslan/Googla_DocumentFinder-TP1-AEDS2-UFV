Winged with steel they fill the air  
The soldiers of fortune will ride  
In the sights of the enemys gun  
Those who have taken their oaths tonight  
Are well prepared they know theyll  
Do or die even if its suicide  
  
Lets take a chance  
As the skies will Burn tonite  
Wasted lives and spirits run free  
On the wings of no return  
  
Dressed to kill where eagles dare  
The fate of a nations at hand  
Is this the answer to the prayers  
Come the dawn through the blood  
Red skies return with tears  
In their eyes and they  
Recall thou shalt not kill  
  
And in the morning  
Theyll take a heros bow  
And make the ever lasting flight  
  
Hear them calling up above all  
Across the skies  
Hear them calling up above from  
The other side  
  
Here them call  
  
Lets take a chance  
As the skies will burn tonite  
Wasted lives and spirits run free  
On the wings of no return  
  
Lets take a chance  
As the skies will burn tonite  
Wasted lives and spirits run free  
On the wings of no return
