Well Im runnin through the world  
With a gun in my back  
Tryin to catch a ride in a Cadillac  
Thought that I was livin  
But you cant really tell  
Been tryin to get away  
From that success smell  
  
You know I need a houseboat and I need a plane  
I need a butler and a trip to Spain  
I need everything  
The world owes me  
I tell that to myself  
And I agree  
  
Im caught in a dream  
So What  
You dont know what Im goin through  
Im right in between  
So Ill  
Ill just play along with you  
  
Well Im runnin through the world  
With a gun in my back  
Tryin to catch a ride in that Cadillac  
Thought I was livin  
But you cant never tell  
What I thought was heaven  
Turned out to be hell  
  
Whoaooh  
When you see me with a smile on my face  
Whoaooh  
Then youll know Im a mental case  
  
Im caught in a dream  
So what  
I dont know what Im going through  
Im right in between  
So Ill  
Ill just play along with you  
  
Whoaooh Oh  
Whoaooh Oh  
Whoaooh
