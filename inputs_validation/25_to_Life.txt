Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Yeah  
Too late  
I cant keep chasing em  
Im taking my life back  
Caught in a change  
Twenty five to life  
  
I dont think she understands the sacrifices that Ive made  
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I wouldve stayed  
But Ive already wasted over half of my life I wouldve laid  
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you  
No more pain bitch you  
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet  
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it  
Now my respect I demand it  
Im a take control of this relationship  
Command it and Im a be the boss of you now goddammit  
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me  
So you better hear me out this much you owe me  
I gave up my life for you totally devoted to you while Ive stayed  
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid  
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats go to work a mess  
Always in a rush to get back to you I aint heard you yet  
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect  
Ive done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness  
And I know that if I end this Ill no longer have nothing left  
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step  
And I wont be coming back so dont hold your fucking breath  
You know what youve done no need to go in depth  
I told you youd be sorry if I fucking left  
Id laugh while you wept  
Hows it feel now yeah funny aint it you neglected me  
Did me a favor although my spirit free youve said  
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept  
Its unfortunate but its  
  
Chorus  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
Too late for the other side  
Caught in a chase  
Twenty five to life  
  
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh  
Cause that aint good enough you expect me to fold myself in half  
Til I snap  
Dont think Im loyal  
All I do is rap  
I can not moonlight on the side  
I have no life outside of that  
Dont I give you enough of my time  
You dont think so do you  
Jealous when I spend time with the girls  
Why Im married to you still man I dont know  
But tonight Im serving you with papers  
Im divorcing you  
Go marry someone else and make em famous  
And take away there freedom like you did to me  
Treat em like you dont need them and they aint worthy of you  
Feed em the same shit you made me eat  
Im moving on forget you oh  
Now Im special Oh I didnt feel special when I was with you  
All I ever felt was this  
Helplessness  
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch  
Chew me up and spit me out  
I fell for this so many times  
Its ridiculous  
And still I stick with this  
Im sick of this but in my sickness and addiction  
Your as addictive as they get  
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em  
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away  
Im addicted  
To the pain the stress the drama  
Im drown in so I guess Im a mess  
Cursed and blessed  
But this time Im a  
Aint changing my mind  
Im climbing out this abyss  
You screaming as I walk out that Ill be missed  
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you  
You left me off your list  
  
Fuck you hiphop  
Im leaving you my life sentence is served bitch  
And its just  
  
Chorus  
  
Too late  
Caught in a change  
Twenty five to life
