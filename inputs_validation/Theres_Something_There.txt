Belle  
Theres something sweet  
And almost kind  
But he was mean  
And he was course  
And unrefined  
And now hes dear  
And so Im sure  
I wonder why I didnt see it there before  
  
Beast  
She glanced this way  
I thought I saw  
And when we touched  
She didnt shudder at my paw  
No it cant be  
Ill just ignore  
But then shes never looked at me that way before  
  
Belle  
New and a bit alarming  
Whod have ever thought that this could be  
True that hes no prince charming  
But theres something in him that I simply didnt see  
  
Lumiere  
Well whod have thought  
  
Ms Potts  
Well bless my soul  
  
Cogsworth  
Well whod have known  
  
Ms Potts  
Well who indeed  
  
Lumiere  
And whod have guessed theyd come together on their own  
  
Ms Potts  
Its so peculiar  
  
Ms Potts cogsworth lumiere  
Well wait and see a few days more  
There may be something there that wasnt there before  
  
Cogsworth  
Well perhaps theres something there that wasnt there before  
  
Ms Potts  
There may be something there that wasnt there before
