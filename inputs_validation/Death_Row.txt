Here I am oh my times rolling slowly by  
21 years old waiting on my turn to die  
Every minute Lord every minute seems like five  
And if it wasnt for the window  
Id wonder if the world outside was alive  
Yeah smokin cigarettes drinkin coffee  
And waiting on my last meal I try to pretend  
  
I try to pretend but this cell is much too real  
Oh I should have left that chick alone  
I curse the day I curse the day she was born now  
Oh the old men they tell me  
They tell me love is akin to hate  
But before I die I just gotta get it straight now  
  
Crush out my cigarette throw away my coffee and scream  
Ahhhhhhh I dont wanna die  
Oh I dont wanna die  
  
Oh its too late theyll be comin for me soon  
Its too late to pray and anyway God cant see this room  
Im startin to sweat now It wont be long now  
I can see  
Theyre gonna put me in that chair  
Theyre gonna put me in that chair and thats how the ends gonna be  
Yeah its gettin cold its gettin colder  
And Im startin to scream Ahh I dont wanna die  
Dont leave me here to die
