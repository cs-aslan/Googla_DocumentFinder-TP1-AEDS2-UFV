Avoir adieu goodnight  
Im too wrong to get right  
But I cant wait forever  
Ive always been alone  
A fool believes hes clever  
  
Dont you wanna go into the hollow  
I wont go alone  
Arent you gonna follow  
  
I live behind my eyes  
Be sure to keep the surprise  
I break what Ive Ive borrowed  
Thats why I always go  
Alone into tomorrow  
  
Dont you wanna go into the hollow  
I wont go alone  
Arent you gonna follow  
  
Into the hollow  
Into the hollow
