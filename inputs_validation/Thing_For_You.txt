Oh Lordy I got to feelin so cold  
You know the mornin it aint too good for my soul  
Ive been workin an in some faraway place  
I got to thinkin about your sweet smilin face  
I got a thing for you if you want me to  
Gonna change all my ways  
Im gonna get off the road Im gonna lighten my load  
I got a thing for you can you feel it too  
I think I better slow down  
All my wanderings done I found my place in the sun  
Ah woman why dyou treat me this way  
You dont believe a single word that I say  
But its the truth now you know Ill be home for good  
So whats with you now I thought that you understood  
I got a thing for you if you want me to  
Gonna change all my ways  
Gonna get off the road Im gonna lighten my load  
There aint a woman alive could ever come close to you  
I wont know how to survive so dont you fake with my view  
You say Im putting you on and soon youll be on your way  
Well woman youre wrong and that is all I can say all I can say  
I got a thing for you an if you want me to  
Gonna change all my ways  
Gonna get off the road Im gonna lighten my load  
I got a thing for you can you feel it too  
I think I better slow down  
All my wanderings done I found my place in the sun  
I got a thing for you  
If you want me to gonna change all my ways  
Im gonna get off the road Im gonna lighten my load
