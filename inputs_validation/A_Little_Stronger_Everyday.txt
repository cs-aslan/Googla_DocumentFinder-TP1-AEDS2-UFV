I was throwin away what I needed most  
It was the Father Son and the Holy Ghost  
A little carnal knowledge is a dangerous thing  
Itll eat a hole in the brain  
Id be the biggest fool in the whole universe  
To trade a heavenly blessing for a worldly curse  
I was a weaker man til I made my stand  
Now I am here to make a change  
  
Chorus  
Im running blind on the wheels of faith  
Im moving to the beat of a heart that prays  
And hangin on every word you said  
I get a little stronger every day  
  
Aint ganna find any help on the TV  
Or written down on the pages of People Magazine  
It takes digging a little deeper into the Good Book now  
For a little sacred adviceoh yah  
  
Chorus   
  
Bridge  
Gettin strong a stronger now every day  
Gettin strong a stronger now every day  
Im getting stronger  
  
Chorus
