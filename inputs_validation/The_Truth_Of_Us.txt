Though it appears were through  
Dont let that illusion make you sad  
We could no more say goodbye  
And if we would have say we never met  
So though we are parting tonight  
Dont be afraid well be alright  
  
The truth of us  
Is simply living a lie  
In a little while  
In a little while  
We will find  
The truth of us  
  
After finding other loves  
Tryin to prove were so aware and free  
But no matter how we run  
Theyre always gonna look like you and me  
So with time out to play out this hand  
We will discover us again  
  
The truth of us  
Is simply living a lie  
In a little while  
In a little while  
We will find  
We will find  
All that was strong  
We will right  
All that is wrong  
The truth of us  
Is simply living a lie  
  
We will find all was strong  
We will right  
All that is wrong  
The truth of us  
Is simply living a lie  
Dont cry Dont cry
