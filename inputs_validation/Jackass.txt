To know you is to hate you  
So loving you must be like suicide  
I dont mind if you dont mind  
Im not the one thats going to die  
I guess I just cant listen  
To this one sided conversation again  
Cause I dont care if you dont care  
No one ever said that life is fair  
  
Everybody loves a joke  
But no one likes a fool  
And youre always cracking the same old lines again  
Youre well rehearsed on every verse  
And that was stated clear  
But no one understands your verity  
  
The center of attention  
Got an honorable mention once again  
Congratulations and salutations  
Youre a figment of your own imagination  
  
Everybody loves a joke  
But no one likes a fool  
And youre always cracking the same old lines again  
Youre well rehearsed on every verse  
And that was stated clear  
But no one understands your verity  
  
To know you is to bait you  
And you fell victim to your own denial  
I dont mind if you dont mind  
If youre wasting all your time
