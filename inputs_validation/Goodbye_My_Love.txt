Goodbye goodbye goodbye my love  
Its time to say goodbye  
Remember me for the fun we had  
Remember me for our love  
  
Be proud that we loved and loved so well  
Dont listen to people who speak from Hell  
Tears yes but lets not be too sad  
Lets hope it wont be all that bad  
  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye my love  
I guess its goodbye  
The rivers may flow and the trees may grow  
But its not the same without you  
  
You said Life isnt so bad after all  
Keep living for us two  
The sun goes up and the moon fades away  
But its not the same without you  
  
Tears yes but dont be too sad  
Lets hope it wont be all that bad  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye my love  
Its time to say goodbye
