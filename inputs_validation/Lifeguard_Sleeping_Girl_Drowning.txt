Always looking for attention  
Always needs to be mentioned  
Who does she  
Think she should be  
The shrill cry through darkening air  
Doesnt she know hes  
Had such a busy day  
  
Tell her sshhh  
Somebody tell her sshhh  
Oh no way no way theres no movement  
Oh oh hooray  
Slowest  
  
It was only a test  
But she swam too far  
Against the tide  
She deserves all she gets  
The sky became marked with stars  
As an outstretched arm slowly  
Disappears  
  
Hooray  
Oh hooray  
No oh oh woh theres no movement  
No oh hooray  
Oh hooray  
  
Please dont worry  
Therell be no fuss  
She was nobodys nothing

The sea was calm  
And another day passes like a dream
