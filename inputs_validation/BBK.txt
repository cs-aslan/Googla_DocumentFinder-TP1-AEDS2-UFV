So youve seen Ive gotten this far  
Please give me some place to worry  
Im not trying to go there so take me away  
Life sometimes pisses me off  
Its never a good trip for me  
Every time I reach for love its taken away  
Night So I play  
  
Give me a sign this is day  
Give me some patience so I pray  
Its time to die Is that what I want  
Theres nothing wrong wanting to be loved  
Is there something wrong with me  
Once in my life Id like to be really set free  
  
Let me be me  
Night So I play  
Give me a sign this is day  
Give me some guidance so I pray  
Its time to die Is that what I want  
  
Take me away  
Taken away  
Take me away  
Taken away  
  
Something I get I got to get home  
Run run run run run run running home  
Where is my home  
Night So I play  
Give me a sign this is day  
Give me some patience so I pray  
Its time to die Is that what I want  
  
Night So I play  
Give me a sign this is day  
Give me some guidance so I pray  
Its time to die Is that what I want
