Look  
If you had  
One shot  
Or one opportunity  
To seize everything you ever wanted  
In one moment  
Would you capture it  
Or just let it slip  
  
Yo  
His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy  
Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti  
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready  
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgettin  
What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud  
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out  
Hes chokin how everybodys jokin now  
The clocks run out times up over blaow  
Snap back to reality oh there goes gravity  
Oh there goes Rabbit he choked  
Hes so mad but he wont give up that easy No  
He wont have it he knows his whole back citys ropes  
It dont matter hes dope he knows that but hes broke  
Hes so stacked that he knows when he goes back to his mobile home thats
when its  
Back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody  
He better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him  
  
Chorus x2  
You better lose yourself in the music the moment  
You own it you better never let it go  
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow  
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better  
  
The souls escaping through this hole that its gaping  
This world is mine for the taking  
Make me king as we move toward a new world order  
A normal life is borin but super stardoms close to post mortar  
It only grows harder only grows hotter  
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him  
Coast to coast shows hes known as the globetrotter  
Lonely roads God only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father  
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter  
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water  
His hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product  
They moved on to the next schmo who flows he nose dove and sold nada  
So the soap opera is told and unfolds I suppose its old partna but the beat
goes on  
Da da dumb da dumb da da  
  
Chorus x2  
  
No more games Im a change what you call rage  
Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged  
I was playin in the beginnin the mood all changed  
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage  
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cipher  
Best believe somebodys payin the pied piper  
All the pain inside amplified by the  
Fact that I cant get by with my nine to  
Five and I cant provide the right type of  
Life for my family cause man these God damn food stamps dont buy diapers  
And its no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer  
This is my life and these times are so hard  
And its getting even harder tryin to feed and water my seed plus  
See dishonor caught up between bein a father and a primadonna  
Baby mama drama screamin on and too much  
For me to want to say in one spot another jam or not  
Has gotten me to the point Im like a snail Ive got  
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot  
Success is my only motherfuckin option failures not  
Mom I love you but this trail has got to go I cannot grow old in Salems
lot  
So here I go is my shot  
Feet fail me not cause maybe the only opportunity that I got  
  
Chorus x2  
  
You can do anything you set your mind to man
