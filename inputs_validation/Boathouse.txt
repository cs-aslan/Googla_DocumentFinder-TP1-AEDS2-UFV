Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
I would rather be at the boathouse out of the daily grind  
Id sooner be down at the boathouse what a way to unwind  
Now I dont wanna know how it feels to be set back  
So Im leavin here on a oneway track  
Id rather be in mosquito alley out of my right hand lane  
Youd rather see my mosquiot tally all that moves is fair game  
Now I dont wanna know how it feels not to be loose  
So Im leavin here on the first caboose  
Im leavin here on the first caboose  
I cant sleep by a gentle ocean and I cant sleep my a water fall  
I cant sleep by a lovely river I cant sleep and I cant sleep  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
I would rather sleep at the boathouse what more can I say  
Id soon eat down at the boathouse let it carry me away  
Now I dont wanna know how it feels to step aside  
So Im leavin here on a wicked ride  
Or I could be back at the alehouse with a flagon or two  
A few blocks south of the jail house with a hole in my shoe  
Now I dont wanna know how it feels to stop a truck  
So Im leavin here and wishin you good luck  
Im leavin here and wishin you good luck  
I cant sleep by a deep ocean I cant sleep by a water fall  
I cant sleep by a lovely river I cant sleep and I cant sleep  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
Id rather be in mosquito alley keepin spiders in line  
Id sooner be down at the boathouse what a way to unwind  
Now I dont wanna know how it feels not to be loose  
So Im leavin here on the first caboose  
Im leavin here on the first caboose  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
