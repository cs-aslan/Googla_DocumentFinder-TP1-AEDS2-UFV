Sin and its ways grow old  
All of my heart turns to stone  
And Im left with no strength to arise  
How You need to be lifted high  
Sin and its ways lead to pain  
Left here with hurt and with shame  
So no longer will I leave Your side  
Jesus Youll be lifted high  
Youll be lifted high Youll be lifted high  
Youll be lifted high in my life oh God  
And I fall to my knees so its You that they see not I  
Jesus Youll be lifted high  
And even now that Im inside Your house  
Help me not to grow prideful again  
Dont let me forsake sacrifice  
Jesus Youll be lifted high  
And if Im blessed with the riches of kings  
How could I ever feel that it was me  
For You brought me from darkness to light  
Jesus Youll be lifted high  
Youll be lifted high Youll be lifted high  
Youll be lifted high in my life oh God  
And I fall to my knees so its You that they see not I  
And Jesus Youll be lifted high  
Oh Jesus Youll be lifted high oh Youll be lifted high  
Oh Youll be lifted high in my life oh God  
And I fall to my knees so its You that they see not I  
Jesus Youll be lifted high yeah yeah
