I cant stay here much longer Melinda  
The sun is getting high  
I cant help you with your troubles  
If you wont help with mine  
I gotta get down  
I gotta get down  
Gotta get down to the mine  
  
You keep me up just one more night  
I cant stop here no more  
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight  
You kept me up till four  
I gotta get down  
I gotta get down  
Or I cant work there no more  
  
Lotta poor man make a five dollar bill  
Will keep him happy all the time  
Some other fellows making nothing at all  
And you can hear him cry  
  
Can I go buddy can I go down  
Take your shift at the mine  
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine  
Thats where I mainly spend my time  
  
Make good money five dollars a day  
If I made any more I might move away  
  
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland Blues  
He cant win for losing  
Lotta poor man got to walk the line  
Just to pay his union dues  
  
I dont know now I just dont know  
If Im coming back again  
I dont know now I just dont know  
If Im coming back again
