Behind her eyes theres curtains  
But theyve been closed to hide the flames  
Remains  
  
She knows there futures burning  
But she can smile just the same  
  
And though her mood is fine today  
Theres a fear theyll soon be parting ways  
  
Standing like a statue  
A chin of stone a heart of clay  
Hey  
  
And though hes to big a man to say  
Theres a fear theyll soon be parting ways  
  
Drifting awayDrifting awayDrifting awayDrifting awayDrifting
away  
Drifting awayDrifting awayDrifting awayDrifting awayDrifting
away
