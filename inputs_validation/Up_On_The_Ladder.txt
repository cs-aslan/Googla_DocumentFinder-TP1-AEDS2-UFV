Im stuck in the TARDIS  
Trapped in hyperspace  
One minute snake charming  
The next in a motorcade  
All the right moves in  
In the right places  
Watch me dance Im a puppet  
You can almost see the strings  
Give me an answer  
Give me a line  
Ive been climbing up this ladder  
Ive been wasting my time  
Up on the ladder  
Were all tied to a stake  
Up on the ladder  
We wait for your mistake  
Up on the ladder  
Try to call out your name  
Up on the ladder  
Youre all the fucking same
