I stop and think for just a while  
Wondering if Hed see me  
Would He think that Im worthwhile  
Cause now I feel so far away  
But I believe yes I believe  
  
His eyes I know they watch me close  
My every move He knows before its even done  
And even though I may be wrong  
He changes me and cleanses me  
  
Oh God search and know my heart  
Longing to be near You Ive tried but cant get past the start  
Oh God wont You show me how  
Lay Your hands upon me and lead me in the Way Everlasting  
  
I know how much Ive hurt You so  
By doing things I know would go against Your heart  
But now Ive come to see myself  
With You in me so patiently  
  
Oh God search and know my heart  
Longing to be near You Ive tried but cant get past the start  
Oh God wont You show me how  
Lay Your hands upon me and lead me in the Way Everlasting  
  
I have never left you on your own My Precious One  
Hold on the time is near Im coming soon  
To take You home with Me  
  
Oh God search and know my heart  
Longing to be near You Ive tried but cant get past the start  
Oh God wont You show me how  
Lay Your hands upon me and lead me lead me oh lead me lead me lead me
there  
  
Oh God search and know  
Search and know
