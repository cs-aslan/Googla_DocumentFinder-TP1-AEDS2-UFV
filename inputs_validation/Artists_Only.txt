Im painting Im painting again  
Im painting Im painting again  
Im cleaning Im cleaning again  
Im cleaning Im cleaning my brain  
  
Pretty soon now I will be bitter  
Pretty soon now will be a quitter  
Pretty soon now I will be bitter  
You cant see it til its finished  
  
I dont have to provethat I am creative  
I dont have to provethat I am creative  
All my pictures are confused  
And now Im going to take me to you
