Hunted down  
Someone said no story no gain  
Wipe the clock right now  
I despise what you crave  
  
I remember you  
When you wore a different face  
Never heard a story of anyone  
Who drove the blacktop insane  
  
Leaning on a stoplight  
Waiting for eventual change  
Whats it matter right now  
Its not so easy to gauge  
  
Every time  
That you ask for more  
Its the sound that makes the colors go blind  
  
And everything comes in threes  
But your face shows two  
Lost in the watershed  
Way out of tune  
  
Aint it hard  
When the spirit doesnt catch you  
Gravitys the winner  
And it weighs you down  
It weighs you down
