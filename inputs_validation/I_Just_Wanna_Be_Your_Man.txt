Hello baby its only me  
I know youre tired its been a long hard week  
I was thinking maybe if you aint got no plans  
I just wanna be your man  
Tonight I wanna be your man  
Know what youre thinking that youve got your doubts  
Im the only one that knows what your dreams are about  
If you say no then I will understand  
I just wanna be your man  
Tonight I wanna be your man  
And all I want is to dream out loud  
We used to think we had it all worked out  
I know that you dont want to be alone  
The streets outside are so damn cold  
You still ever think of you and me as us  
Or another thing we let die and turn to dust  
I wasnt there to clean the cuts  
I want the one who got caught in the ruts  
I was just thinking maybe if you got no plans  
I  
I just wanna  
Tonight I wanna be your man
