Theres a distant sound to the outward bound  
On a lonesome windy night  
A restless sigh as it fades away  
A longing at first light  
Theres a sad resolve that its all gone wrong  
Yet before you turn to go  
It comes to you  
Its really true  
Its your love thats last to know  
  
Well we take our time were polite and kind  
To the strangers that we meet  
And the ones who share the ones who really care  
They dont seem to make us feel complete  
So we stand alone  
And we act so strong  
Were all such worldly souls  
Till we find one day  
Weve lost our way  
And our loves the last to know  
  
So we stand alone  
And we act so strong  
Were all such worldly souls  
Then we find one day  
That weve lost our way  
And our loves the last to know  
Then we find one day  
That weve lost our way  
And our loves the last to know
