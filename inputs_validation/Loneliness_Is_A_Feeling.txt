As the sand dunes of time march on  
The wind blows the storms to the shore  
Sadness and loneliness hand in hand  
Lord I feel no more  
Loneliness is a feeling  
  
Im lost in a world with love all around  
Standing there like a pillar of salt  
Dont know the day my hairs turning grey  
Ooh is the tide coming to take my blues away  
  
Loneliness is a feeling  
Loneliness is a feeling  
Loneliness is a feeling  
  
When she tells you your love was a sin  
You lie in your bed all alone  
And all the children come in to your heart  
Lord I feel no more  
Loneliness is a feeling  
  
Loneliness loneliness  
Loneliness loneliness  
Loneliness loneliness  
Loneliness loneliness
