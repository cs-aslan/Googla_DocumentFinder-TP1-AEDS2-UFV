Some folk leave you courage  
Some folk leave you hope  
Why am I out here hangin  
Like a fool on the end of my rope  
Some folk leave you wisdom  
Some folk throw you signs  
You can never be sure what went on before  
Life is just a matter of time  
Pictures of you clouding my view  
Im following in your footsteps  
Tryin to make some sense of it all  
Maybe its a sign of weakness  
But thats where my footsteps fall  
Im following in your footsteps  
Tryin to hold on to your dreams  
You never got what you wanted  
So I never got what I need  
Im following in your footsteps  
cause thats where your footsteps lead  
Someone must have left me anger  
Someone must have given me hate  
Or why would I stand here shakin  
When theres so many chances to take  
Pictures of you climb into view  
Im following in your footsteps  
Tryin to make some sense of it all  
Well maybe its a sign of weakness  
But thats where my footsteps fall  
Im following in your footsteps  
Watchin my children grow  
Theyll be following in my footsteps  
Takin it down the road  
Were following in your footsteps  
cause thats where your footsteps go  
Were following in your footsteps  
Takin it down the road  
Were following in your footsteps yeah  
cause thats where your footsteps go
