Caught up in wheels of fortune while youve been asleep  
Come on give it up you got whats comin to you  
No use for you to struggle now youre in too deep  
Its gonna be a long long time before its through  
  
Changin wheels of fortune  
Drivin us on and on  
Winnin sometimes losin  
As soon as its here its gone  
  
Im so tired of losin  
But I still play the game  
And I know theres no reason  
Still I go on searchin just the same  
  
Well Ive kicked around your city  
Seen your vanity  
Mister Society can you hear me  
You get your satisfaction and you cover all the action  
But your loaded dice wont help you in the end  
  
Changin wheels of fortune  
Drivin us on and on  
Winnin sometimes losin  
As soon as its here its gone  
  
Im so tired of losin  
But I still play the game  
And I know theres no reason  
Still I go on searchin just the same
