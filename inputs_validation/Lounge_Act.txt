Truth covered in security  
I cant let you smother me  
Id like to but it couldnt work  
Trading off and taking turns  
I dont regret a thing  
  
Ive got this friend you see  
Who makes me feel  
And I wanted more  
Than I could steal  
Ill arrest myself  
And wear a shield  
Ill go out of my way  
To prove I still  
Smell her on you  
  
Dont tell me what I wanna hear  
Afraid of never knowning fear  
Experience anything you need  
Ill keep fighting jealousy  
Until its fucking gone  
  
Ive got this friend you see  
Who makes me feel  
And I wanted more  
Than I could steal  
Ill arrest myself  
And wear a shield  
Ill go out of my way  
To prove I still  
Smell her on you

Ill go out of my way  
To make you a deal  
Weve make a pact  
To learn from who  
Ever we want  
Without new rules  
Well share whats lost and what we grew  
Theyll go out of their way  
To prove they still  
Smell her on you  
They still smell her on you  
Smell her on you
