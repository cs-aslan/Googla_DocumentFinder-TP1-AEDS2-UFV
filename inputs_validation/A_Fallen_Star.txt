A star fell from Heaven  
Right into my arms  
The brightest star I know Ive never seen  
Then I found out that it was  
Only you and all your charms  
You came into my life to fill a dream  
  
A fallen star thats what you are  
The twinkle in your eye came from the sky  
You must have sailed from the Milky Way  
A fallen star thats what you are  
  
The heavens must be lonely now that you are mine  
Im sure theyll miss a star as bright as you  
But the stars will send their blessings and brighter they will shine  
For when they see the dream thats coming true  
  
A fallen star thats what you are  
That twinkle thats in your eye came from the sky  
You must have sailed from the Milky Way  
A fallen star thats what you are  
  
A fallen star
