When Im away from you  
I know what to say and do  
But every time youre near  
My courage disappears ahha  
The words are on my lips  
When my composure slips  
While youre collected and cool  
I make a fool of myself  
  
I want so much to be  
The only love you see  
I fall each time I try  
To look good in your eyes ahha  
Dont know if Ill get through  
Being destroyed by you  
While youre collected and cool  
I make a fool of myself  
  
Hey little girl  
How could you care  
Little girl youre unaware  
Of the love I have to share  
Inside me dying  
Oh Im crying  
  
Lord above please let me see  
Shes the life and breath of me  
How my heart is breakin  
When Im sleepin wakin  
I keep making a fool of myself  
  
I want so much to be  
The only love you see  
I fall each time I try  
To look good in your eyes ahha  
Dont know if Ill get through  
Being destroyed by you  
While youre collected and cool  
I make a fool of myself  
Oh little girl  
How could you care  
Little girl youre unaware  
Of the love I have to share  
Inside me dying  
Oh Im crying
