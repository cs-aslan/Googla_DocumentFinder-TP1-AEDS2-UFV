You left you didnt say goodbye  
You never gave me a reason why  
My tears are dried now its been a while  
Now there you szand youre back again  
Do you think that time stands still do you think that time stands still  
Things have changed Ive rearranged so many things  
Do you think that time stands still do you think that time stands still  
It never has it never will do you think that time stands still  
You wont to start where we left off  
Somebody found the love you lost  
Love has its price weve paid the cost  
We lose and learn now its your turn  
Do you think that time stands still  
Do you think that time stands still  
Oh do you think that time stands still
