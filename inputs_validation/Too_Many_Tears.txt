I used to be the man for you  
Did everything you wanted me to  
So tell me baby  
What did I do wrong  
  
I told you what you wanted to know  
Precious secrets never spoken before  
All Im asking  
Where did I go wrong  
  
Some things are better left unsaid  
But all I do is cry instead  
Now Ive cried me a river  
Thinking how it used to be  
  
Thereve been too many tears falling  
And thereve been too many hearts  
Breaking in two  
Remember what we had together  
Believing it would last forever  
So tell me baby  
Where did I go wrong  
  
Everything I had was yours  
More than I have ever given before  
So wont you tell me  
Did I hurt you so bad  
  
I guess Im fooling myself  
Cause I want you and no one else  
And I cant understand  
Why youre doing these things to me  
  
Thereve been too many tears falling  
And thereve been too many hearts  
Breaking in two  
Remember what we had together  
Believing it would last forever  
So tell me baby  
Where did I go wrong where did I go wrong  
  
Now my heart is breaking  
My whole world is shaking  
Cause I cant understand  
Why youre doing these things to me  
  
Thereve been too many tears falling  
And thereve been too many hearts  
Breaking in two  
Remember what we had together  
Believing it would last forever  
So tell me baby  
  
Where did I go wrong
