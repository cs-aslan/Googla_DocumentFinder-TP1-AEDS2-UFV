I cant help it  
When Im not around you Boy  
Cause all I ever seem to  
Do is drift away  
In dreams about you  
Cause when Im without you Boy  
It always seems like  
Part of me is missing baby  
  
Sometimes I dont call  
Like I dont care at all  
But secretly youre the only thing  
That lifts me up  
And makes me smile  
When Im unhappy  
All you gotta do is call  
And suddenly things dont really  
Seem so bad at all  
  
Boy I need you  
Boy Adore you Boy  
Gotta have you Oh boy  
I wanna feel your touch  
This aint no little crush  
So come and get my love  
Baby anything you want  
Feeling you Boy  
Fiending for you Boy  
Just waiting on you Boy  
When I see you Oh boy  
Im gonna wrap you up  
Inside my love  
And never let you go boy  
Never let you go boy  
  
My heart races when  
My Motorola beeps  
Or my cell rings  
I just make a wish and if its you  
My whole day changes  
Cause when I know  
Youre thinking of me Boy  
Heaven knows  
Suddenly its not so dismal baby  
  
Sometimes I dont call  
Like I dont care at all  
But secretly youre the only thing  
That lifts me up  
And makes me smile  
When Im unhappy  
All you gotta do is call  
And suddenly things dont really  
Seem so bad at all  
  
Boy I need you  
Boy Adore you Boy  
Gotta have you Oh boy  
I wanna feel your touch  
This aint no little crush  
So come and get my love  
Baby anything you want  
Feeling you Boy  
Fiending for you Boy  
Just waiting on you Boy  
When I see you Oh boy  
Im gonna wrap you up  
Inside my love  
And never let you go boy  
Never let you go boy  
  
I What

I wanna feel your touch Why wouldnt you  
So come and get my love Show me where its at  now sing

This aint no little crush  
So come and get my love
