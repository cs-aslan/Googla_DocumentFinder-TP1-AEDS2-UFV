What an unusual name you said  
What a spectacular letter  
You really seem like a prize to me  
And you are so mysterious  
When you are notorious  
Oh what do you mean to me he said  
How do you know me so well  
After only one night I I I I had  
How do I love you tell me  
Though in my mind  
Im indebited to you Im indebited to you  
Always  
  
Theres something he doesnt know about me  
A secret he doesnt show about  
A sensitive sign on his arm  
Oh my ai ai  
She got the skeletons dance when  
Some secrets he know she never tell  
People who keep her alone  
  
And she said how did I know you so well  
Why am I not surprised  
He said baby go to hell and  
That will set demise of your love  
Dont ever pick up the man  
If you dont think hell understand  
Dont ever trust yourself if you  
Have a history of being a loving fool  
  
So thats what she got when she married him  
A lifetime promise to carry him  
Him and his every second of need  
I do not know him so well  
Not more than one night  
Do you still love me oh tell me  
With all of your might  
Im indebited to you in indebited to you  
My lovea
