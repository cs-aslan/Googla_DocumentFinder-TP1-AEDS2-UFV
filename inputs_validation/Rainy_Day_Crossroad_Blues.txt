The sky is fallin and the ground is reachin up  
The rivers goin by and the waters gettin high and I feel like givin up  
Standin in the downpour with these rainy day crossroad blues  
Got those woods on my left city on my right dont want to sleep alone
tonight again  
Hole in my coat hole in my shoes sittin in Mobile singin the blues about
you  
Company people call my house most every day  
Wont let a body concentrate  
Gotta get some peace that way  
Waitin for that water risin think Ill put my guitar in my boat  
Cause Im floatin to the nearest levy just to lay down  
In that sand  
Just pickin wild berries gettin stung by honey bees  
The Lord above and the devil below havin a fight inside of me  
Thinkin  bout my gun maybe that will set me free  
Cause thunder and lightnin are trapped inside of me  
Innocent darlin why you treat your daddy this way  
The price of the question is a mighty hard price to pay  
Cause you brought these rainy day crossroad blues my way  
I cant take it no more
