Youre the one who gives me shelter  
And youre the light that leads me home  
Youre the love that gave forever  
Lord youre all that I know

And all that I am Unto you I surrender  
Lord there is none like you  
And I know that I stand In the arms of forever  
Lord there is none like you  
There is none like you  
Verse 2  
With the world upon your shoulders  
Lord you gave your life away  
If the world I know was over

Bridge  
And I will stand And I will worship You forever For all You are  
And I will stand And all to you I will surrender Ill worship you
forever
