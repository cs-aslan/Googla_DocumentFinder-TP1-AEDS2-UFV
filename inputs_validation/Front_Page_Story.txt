She wakes up  
Shes leaving  
She sets out so assured  
That she can find  
The life that she believes in  
Shes glad now  
Its over  
She never should of gotten so involved  
At least thats what she told him  
And it aint a Front Page Story  
Wont even make the papers  
Somebody breaks a heart in two  
And it happens much too often  
Wont ever make the headlines  
Somebodys broken heart aint new  
Except when it happens to you  
He wonders  
What happened  
He thinks of all the things  
He might have done  
Why shouldnt she believe him  
He wakes up without her  
And never really knows  
Just what went wrong  
But its all wrong without her  
And it aint a Front Page Story  
Wont even make the papers  
Somebody breaks a heart in two  
And it happens much too often  
Wont ever make the headlines  
Another broken heart aint new  
Except when it happens to you  
It aint a Front Page Story  
Wont even make the papers  
Somebody breaks a heart in two  
And it happens much too often  
Wont ever make the headlines  
Somebodys broken heart aint new  
Except when it happens to you  
No no no  
Wont make the headlines  
Somebody breaks a heart in two  
No no no  
Oh no no  
Somebodys broken heart aint news  
Except when it happens to you  
No no no  
Wont make the headlines  
Somebody breaks a heart in two  
No no no  
Oh no no  
Somebodys broken heart aint news
