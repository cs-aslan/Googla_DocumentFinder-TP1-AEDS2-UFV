Theres not a mean bone in my body  
I never could be unkind  
I know were not talking  
But theres something on my mind  
  
It aint rightteous indignation  
I dont plan to rant or rave  
No need for us to fight and fuss  
I just want to say  
  
Have a nice rest of your life without me  
Ill be proud to be a part of your history  
If it makes you happy honey  
Keep talking bad about me  
And have a nice rest of your life without me  
  
I know youre not heartless  
Not callous and youre not cruel  
And I know you dont mean to  
When you treat me like a fool  
  
I believe that your good nature  
Will emerge with someone else  
If I cant be beside you  
I can be beside myself  
  
Have a nice rest of your life without me  
Ill be proud to be a part of your history  
If it makes you happy honey  
Keep talking bad about me  
And have a nice rest of your life without me  
  
Without me  
Dont forget your pocketbook honey  
Or your toothbrush  
Dont forget you toothbrush dear
