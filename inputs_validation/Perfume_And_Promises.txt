A crack in the smile  
But shes always in style while she waits  
Waving goodbye but shes too tired to cry and shes wasted  
A letter he wrote  
But its far too expose so he throws it away  
The sound of regret as its counting the steps back to safe  
  
Chorus  
I dont want to leave you with perfume and promises  
But well never know till we capture and bottle it  
Cause wouldnt it be such a shame  
If all was wasted  
  
Not an inch of the room  
That isnt in bloom or in light  
So we drink till its dawn  
Every drip till its gone and were wasted  
Its a thing of the truth  
But well lie and well look for the perfect escape  
And the moment will go like melted snow in the rain  
  
Chorus  
  
Stay for another morning  
Study the curves on my face  
Stay even when were unknowing  
Stay till they tear you away  
  
Chorus
