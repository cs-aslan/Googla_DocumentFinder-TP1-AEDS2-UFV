Wake up everyone  
How can you sleep at a time like this  
Unless the dreamer is the real you  
Listen to your voice  
The one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue  
Lip and the neck will appear  
  
Chorus  
I dont wanna wake before  
The dream is over  
Im gonna make it mine  
Yes I I know it  
Im gonna make it mine  
Yes Ill make it all mine  
  
I keep my life on a heavy rotation  
Requesting that its lifting you up  
Up up and away  
And over to a table at the gratitude cafe  
  
And I am finally there  
And all the angels theyll be singing  
Ah la la la ah la la la I la la la la love you  
  
Chorus  
  
And timings everything  
And this time theres plenty  
I am balancing  
Careful and steady  
And reveling in energy that everyones emitting  
  
I dont wanna wait no more  
No I wanna celebrate the whole world  
Im gonna make it mine  
Because Im following your joy  
Im gonna make it mine  
Because I I am open  
Im gonna make it mine  
Yes I Im gonna show it  
Yes Im gonna make it mine  
Its mine  
Yes I will make it all mine
