All my hands have made Im laying down  
All that I hold dear my many crowns

Were waiting with worship for more  
Youre the only one that satisfies me

My constant request above all things  
Every hour I wake be near me oh God  
Though Ive tasted and seen of Your great love  
Show me Your glory  
Show me Your glory

Spirit fall open up heavens door  
Were waiting with worship for more

Were safe and secure in Your love  
Youre the only one that satisfies me

Were waiting with worship were waiting with praise  
For the almighty presence of God to invade
