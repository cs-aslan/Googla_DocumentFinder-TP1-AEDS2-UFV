Im sorry if I have misled you  
I never meant to do you wrong  
But I would like to find the answers  
Ive been searching for so very long so long  
  
I know you must be tired of chasing me blues  
When happiness is so hard to find  
Weve been through so many things together  
I can see its hurting you inside  
  
Maybe in the end it all works out  
Or maybe in the end its all wrong  
But I know when its over Ill still love you  
Well be together or Ill be alone  
  
The years have passed and Ive become so jaded  
Im leaving all my dreams behind  
And now that we are here together  
Youre the only thing on my mind  
  
Maybe in the end it all works out  
Or maybe in the end its all wrong  
But I know when its over Ill still love you  
Well be together or Ill be alone  
  
Maybe in the end it all works out  
Or maybe in the end its all wrong  
But I know when its over Ill still love you  
Well be together or Ill be alone
