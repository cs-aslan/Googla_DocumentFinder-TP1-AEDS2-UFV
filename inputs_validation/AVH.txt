I get up and I get down  
I dont know how to take it  
All the pain makes me scream and shout  
I wonder if Ill make it  
I love the feeling when the magic is just right  
Theres no revealing what is hidden in the night  
Riding on a train that I cant control  
No one else to blame and I cant let go  
In the darkness I can feel  
The things that makes me crazy  
Hands of madness cold as steel  
I find it quite amazing  
Never forsaking what a dreamer needs to know  
Rules meant for breaking and the seeds I have to sow  
Riding on a train that I cant control  
No one else to blame and I cant let go  
Its calling me Its calling me  
Its calling me Its calling me  
Im riding on a train that I cant control  
See no evil fear no fright  
Never lose the living  
Keep the targets in your sight  
Know the cards youre dealing  
Never forsaking what a dreamer needs to know  
Rules meant for breaking and I gotta let I gotta it go
