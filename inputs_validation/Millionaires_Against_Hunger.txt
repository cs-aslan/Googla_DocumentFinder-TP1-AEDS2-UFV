Were millionaires  
Against hunger  
  
Im a millionaire  
And I got something to say  
I got a million more thatll take me away  
All those people starvin everyday  
As far as Im concerned why thats okay  
  
Well Im a millionaire too but not like you  
As far as Im concerned I got a job to do  
Ive got to pave the way Ive got to save the day  
Ive got to make it better Ive got to say  
You and I were millionaires  
But were a million miles away from the saint who stares  
Upon the millions who die every day of the week  
Just because they cant get enough to eat  
While we the rich dine on all these feasts  
And everythings fine yeah peaches and creme  
But it just isnt something youve got to realize  
Theres something wrong weve got to open our eyes  
When the world cries we just cant hide  
Eve got a job to do weve got to save some lives  
  
Were millionaires  
Against hunger  
  
Hey hey Mr Millionaire

Hey hey Mr Millionaire  
A spiritual price do you care  
Hey hey Mr Millionaire  
Nice and Wise when you share  
Hey hey Mr Millionaire  
Pave the way take the Grail  
  
Im a millionaire  
And I got something to say  
I got three or four yachts on the Chesapeake Bay  
All those people starvin everyday  
As far as Im concerned why thats okay  
  
Well Im a millionaire too  
All I know that is true is that Ive got more cash than I can use  
I want anything that I can have  
But I dont need nothin and I never have  
Each damn day my hearts set far  
But Ill be okay cause I dont starve  
Kids from the street the losing their emotion so damn snobby so out of touch  
With two hungry people who die as they stare at the city at night  
You know it gives to share  
So listen up you millionaires  
Every woman every man help all you can  
All races unite and I will now concern to the type of problem that helps us
learn  
  
Were millionaires  
Against hunger  
  
Hey hey Mr Millionaire  
Twice as nice when you share  
Hey hey Mr Millionaire  
A spiritual price do you care  
Hey hey Mr Millionaire  
Nice and wise when you share  
Hey hey Mr Millionaire  
Pave the way take the Grail
