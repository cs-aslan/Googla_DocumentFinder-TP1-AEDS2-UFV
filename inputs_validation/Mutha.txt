Mutha dont wanna go to school today  
I think Id rather go outside and play  
  
They keep calling asking me  
If Ill come in  
Is that a sin  
If being lazy is the only reason  
  
Its getting late  
So mutha dont you hesitate  
To pack my lunch  
And Ill be on my way to school  
  
Mutha dont wanna go to school today  
I think Id rather go outside and play  
  
Mutha dont wanna go to school today  
I think Id rather go outside and play  
  
The teachers always looking down  
With her disappointed frown  
Asking me to go sleep somewhere else  
  
My levelheaded mutha  
Always said to one another  
That the truth will always hurt  
If you keep waiting  
I said waiting
