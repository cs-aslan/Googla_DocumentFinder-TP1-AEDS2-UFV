Theres a pack of rabid dogs  
Pawing at my front door  
Theres a pack of rabid dogs  
Pawing at my front door  
  
Theres a swarm of yellowjackets  
Pounding against my window pane  
Theres a swarm of yellowjackets  
Pounding against my window pane  
  
Well hows it gonna be  
Hows it gonna be yeah  
Hows it gonna be  
Hows it gonna be yeah  
  
All the pictures on the wall  
Have fallen to the ground  
The trees bowing to the grass  
In a silent hurricane  
When the landlord calls  
  
Mother Natures come to arms  
Shes in a fighting mood  
Gretas got a gun  
This aint no flower child  
  
Hows it gonna be  
Hows it gonna be yeah  
Hows it gonna be  
Hows it gonna be yeah
