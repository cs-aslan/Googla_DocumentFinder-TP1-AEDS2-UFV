Mortal Eyes Looking Through A Veil Of Dreams  
Hypnotised An Ever Living Soul With Wings  
Think Youre God But You Never Had Control  
Think Youre Loved But Theres No One There At All  
Chorus  
My Colours All Ran Dry And Now I See The World In  
Black And White  
Its Too Late Now Its Time To Kiss The Rainbow  
Goodbye  
Poison Tears Running From A Palsied Face  
Satan Nears Descending On The Human Race  
Think Youre God Dont You Wish You Had Control  
Think Youre Loved But Theres No One There At All  
Chorus  
Listen To The Wind Hear The Gospel Blow  
Tell Me That You Dont Hear What Im Hearing  
And I Will Let You Go  
Look Up To The Sky Put Your Trust In Me  
Tell Me That You Aint Feelin What Im Feelin And I  
Will Set You Free  
Look Into The Flame See The Embers Glow  
Tell Me That You Dont See What Im Seein And I  
Will Let You Go  
Taste The Holy Blood Running From My Veins  
Tell Me That You Aint Feelin What Im Feelin And  
Ill Take Away The Pain  
Yes I Will Now Oh Yes I Will Its Time To Kiss The  
Rainbow Goodbye
