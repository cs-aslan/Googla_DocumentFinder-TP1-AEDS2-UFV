I wanna tell the world that your my girl  
And that Im your man Aw baby  
And I wanna tell the world that you got me  
Why cant we be Aw baby  
I cant put my name on your kiss  
And I cant speak your name from these lips  
We froze and nobody knows  
  
Have to walk out the room everytime you call  
Tellin everybody I aint seen you in so long  
It feels like I aint breating  
This feels worser than cheating  
  
Cuz we out here livin a lie  
Out here livin a lie  
Im out here livin a lie  
Why what makes you smile seem to make you cry  
Im out here livin a lie  
Im out here livin a lie  
We out here livin a lie  
Behind these smiles Im really hurting

Time takes a breathe Aw Baby  
I hear about other relationships that aint true  
I wanna set it right Aw Baby  
And I cant tell nobody how I feel oh  
And I cant tell nobody how we is oh  
  
I wanna hop on the first thing smokin  
Tell our agent to book us a plane

I wanna be near you too  
I wanna wake up wake up  
Right next to you baby
