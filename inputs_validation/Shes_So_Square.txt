Awful plastic boots that come above her ankle  
Dayglo mini skirts just like a pop art spangle  
Digs vanilla fudge buys lipstick by the pound  
Gets that English look resembles Kath McGowan  
Have you seen her hair its a style from heaven  
Ah shes nowhere she thinking this is 1967  
Shes so square shes nowhere  
Shes so square shes nowhere  
Take her to a disco and screaming Lord Sutch it  
Everyone must look but nobody must touch  
What about her car E type is the latest  
How about the Yardbirds Jeff Beck is the greatest  
Have you seen her hair its a style from heaven  
Ah shes nowhere she thinking this is 1967  
Shes so square  
Shes nowhere  
Shes so square  
Shes nowhere
