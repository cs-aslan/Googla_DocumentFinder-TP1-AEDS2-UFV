Verse  
All right  
Shell be jumping up and down  
Trying to fit that ass in  
Took her half an hour just to get that  
All she wanna talk about is party and the fashion  
I dont know where shes going and I do not plan on asking at all  
Cause her spirit is free  
And she lets nobody else in except for me  
If her basement is locked then I swear she would agree  
Im the only one she loves theres no copy of the key  
Homie thats a guarantee  
  
Verse 2  
Dont forget that fendi purse that you put all your cash in  
Kinda hard to concentrate when cameras are flashing  
Other dudes will suffocate her I dont want her gaspin  
Dont know where shes going and I do not plan on asking at all  
Ive never been the type felt a like my connection  
With niggas that wanna fight over women thats not right  
Theres too many in the world homie you could have yo pick  
But I swear that ones my girl I swear that ones my girl
