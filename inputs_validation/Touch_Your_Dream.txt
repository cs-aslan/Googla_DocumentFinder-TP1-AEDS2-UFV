Have you ever seen a dream walking  
Have you ever heard a dream talking  
You are the master of your dreams  
If you pull the right strings  
It could be talking to you  
If you pull the right strings  
It could be walking to you  
  
You are the one to make it happen  
Youre the only one that knows what is  
You are holding the key to your dreams  
Dont hestitate grab the chance  
Before its too late  
  
Chorus  
Reach out and touch your dreams  
  
Dont let them tell you it is impossible  
That is what they told all heroes before  
In a heros mind the word does not exist  
When youre 80 years old  
Thinking about your past  
Regretting every minute of your life  
That youve lost  
You will wonder where the time went  
If you do the right thing  
It could be talking to you  
Dont hesitate grab the chance  
Before its too late  
  
Chorus  
Reach out and touch your drea
