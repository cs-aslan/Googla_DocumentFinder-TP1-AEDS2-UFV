Sweet wonderful you  
You make me happy with the things you do  
Oh can it be so  
This feeling follows me wherever I go  
I never did believe in miracles  
But Ive a feeling its time to try  
I never did believe in the ways of magic  
But Im beginning to wonder why  
Dont dont break the spell  
It would be different and you know it will  
You you make loving fun  
I dont have to tell you youre the only one  
You make loving fun  
Its all I wanna do
