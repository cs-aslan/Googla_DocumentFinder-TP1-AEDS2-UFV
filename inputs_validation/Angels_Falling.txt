I climbed up the tree in the back and got on my roof top  
With my twentytwo its hot with little pops  
Started bustin off shots aimin all at the sky  
I emptied out the gun bustin all at the sky  
Then I went and stole the bow and arrow from my dad  
To the arrow tips I tied gasoline soaked rags  
Climbed up with the Zippo lit em off in the sky  
A trail of black smoke leading off in the sky  
I bought some Chinese stars from the KungFu surplus  
They had em under the glass I made the purchase  
Climbed up and I whizzed em off in the sky  
  
Even stood up on the chimney whizzed em off in the sky  
Then I found a double barrel with shells at WalMart  
I threw it in next to the Faygo in my shopping cart  
I got home climbed up and blew it off in the sky  
320 in the morning bustin off at the sky  
I got a blow gun too a real one at that  
I dip the tips in poison lay up on my back  
And now theyre piercing through the air straight up into the sky  
  
Its like the only thing you hear is into the sky  
I bought a harpoon off the Internet and went up  
And tried to shoot it but the fuckin rip off it got stuck  
I said fuck it and I threw the spear up into the sky  
As fuckin hard as I could I threw it into the sky  
Im sprayin mace up there I throw M80s up there  
Im shootin everything I got I sit and wait in my chair  
Because I hate the sky above whether moon or sun  
Whether rain or snow since the pain begun  
  
Im tryin to aim for the Heavens up into the sky  
Tell me why the love of my life had to die  
Hows she gonna leave me and not even say bye  
I know that shes an angel and theyre lettin her fly  
Every plan I thought we made together was a lie  
She could of hung on I bet she didnt even try  
She left me dry and that no one can deny  
And when she fall from the sky Im askin her why  
  
Chorus x8  
Angels are falling  
Angels are falling  
Falling angels  
Come crashing down to the floor  
Wont stop til I get the one that Im looking for
