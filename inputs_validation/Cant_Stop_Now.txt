I cant say I didnt know what I was doin  
I cant pretend things just got outta hand  
I shoulda kept my distance  
While I was still strong  
But I got caught up in the feelin  
Carried along and its  
Too late baby  
I cant stop now  
  
Well I walked right in with my eyes wide open I did  
And I was blind when you told me  
Youd be mine just as soon as you were free  
I should have kept my distance  
While I was still strong  
But I got caught up in the feelin  
Carried along and its  
Too late baby  
I cant stop now  
  
Cant stop now  
Crazy hearts runnin outta control  
Cant stop now  
And Ill be falling apart somewhere down the road  
I might be headed for a breakdown  
But I cant stop now
