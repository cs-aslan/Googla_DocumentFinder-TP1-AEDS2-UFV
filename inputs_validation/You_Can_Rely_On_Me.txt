Sometimes I rock sometimes I roll  
Sometimes its not me in control  
Sometimes I gotta jump before I know whats below  
Sometimes I gotta drop everything and go  
  
Some days were hot some days were cold  
Some days were carrying a heavy load  
Some days were digging in and the love may not show  
But I want you to know  
  
That you can rely on me yes you can  
You can rely on me to understand you  
You can rely on me for anything  
You can rely you can rely on me  
  
And when life is hinging on regret  
Like you made up your mind and then you second guessed it  
Theres so much you wanna try  
That you havent tried yet  
Hmm I got your back through all of it yes I do  
  
You can rely on me yes you can  
You can rely on me to understand you  
You can rely on me for anything  
You can rely you can rely on me  
  
Its you who brought me back when I was lost  
Everything I learned you taught me  
How to wise up and pay a little more attention  
And you showed me how to listen  
So listen  
  
You can rely on me yes you can  
Hmm hmm  
  
Yeah you can rely on me yes you can  
You can rely on me to understand you  
You can rely on me for anything  
You can rely you can rely on me
