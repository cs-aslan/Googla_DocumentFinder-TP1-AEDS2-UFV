Verse 1  
Alright so this is really fucked up but  
Alright I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude  
And then all of a sudden everything that he fucking did just made me cringe
and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again  
This whole time I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I
guess I could just never write a song and then maybe Id never fell out of
love with him in the first place  
I mean I I dont wanna feel this feeling cause my energys just so strong
that I dont know if Im creating this or this is actually what is meant to
be  
And you know that they say that you gotta think what you want into existence
but you know I havent been too good at making decisions so I have no idea
what the fuck I want I guess  
  
Chorus 1  
Youre giving me a feeling in my head  
Laying in my bed just thinking  
Not really feeling like the one I want  
Takes everything in me not to call him  
I really really really want it too  
I told all my friends Im moving on  
Your baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
  
Verse 2  
You know what in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit
and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby googoo tongue
down my fucking throat  
I mean even in front of your mom  
Dude as if Im not fucking awkward enough  
I mean you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass
bitch and Im not a fucking dumbass bitch  
You know like I hate all that fucking PDA I probably hate it more than your
fucking friends do  
You know its sweet and you couldnt be more opposite of my last dickhead
but you know I just I dont know if I can get over the fucking goo  
  
Chorus 2  
You keep saying again and again  
Were laying in my bed just talking  
And now I now I cant hold it back  
Im feeling like Im gonna vomit  
I dont really want to let go of you  
I heard I change my mind with you often  
Baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
  
Verse 3  
Alright so Im gonna be honest  
Its the super cutey shit thats the main issue here  
I mean Im fucking what  
Look I like when you send me you know the the queen emoji but when I send
back the monkey you know the ones with the the hands over the eyes That
means that shits just getting a little too weird for me  
I mean I dont wanna say it person I just bury my head in your armpit
which weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth  
Like why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do  
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute  
Well that was kind of the best thing in the entire world  
You know maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to
someone giving a fuck  
Im sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit  
I mean look Im really starting to be in this whole thing but no matter
what you do homegirl cant handle the fucking goo  
  
Chorus 3  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
I dont really want  you  
I heard I change my mind with you often  
Baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking
