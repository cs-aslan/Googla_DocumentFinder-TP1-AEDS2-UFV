I dont want a lot for Christmas  
Theres just one thing I need  
I dont care about the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas  
Is you  
  
I dont want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need and I  
I dont care about the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
I dont need to hang my stockings  
There upon the fireplace aahh  
Santa Clause wont make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas Day

More than you could ever know ooo  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas is you

Im just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
  
I wont make a list and send it  
To the north pole for Saint Nick aahh

Hear those magic reindeer click  
  
Cause I just want you here tonight Ohh  
Holding on to me so tightOhh  
What more can I do  
Baby all I want for christmas is you  
You Baby  
  
Oh all the lights are shining  
So brightly everywhere so brightly baby  
And the sound of childrens  
Laughter fills the air Ohh  
  
And everyone is singing Oh yea  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa wont you bring me the one I really need  
Wont you please bring my baby to me  
  
Oh I dont want a lot for Christmas  
This is all Im asking for aahh  
I just want to see my baby  
Standing right outside my door

More than you could ever know ohh  
Make my wish come true

You Baby
