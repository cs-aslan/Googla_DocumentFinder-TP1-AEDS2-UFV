So here am I  
Quite by chance near the phone  
I could call and make you crawl into bed  
  
Questions always questions  
Ill just speak in slow motion  
About obsessions with boys on the floor  
  
Take that smile off your face  
Wipe that tear from your eye  
Dont say sorry for me  
Take that smile off your face  
Wipe that tear from your eye  
Dont say sorry for me  
  
Now look at me  
Like a stormtrooper in drag  
Ill bet you feel exactly like I do  
Its so disgusting  
Im so tired of  
Rhythm and needles in arms  
I dont want your point of view  
  
Nothing to do  
Nothing to steal  
And theres nothing to say  
Nothing to do  
Nothing to steal  
And theres nothing to say  
  
Oh dont cry  
Love it love it  
I need to  
  
Stop it
