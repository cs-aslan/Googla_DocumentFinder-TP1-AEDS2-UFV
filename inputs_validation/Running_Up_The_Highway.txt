Quit my job at the 711  
3d vision and a glance of heaven  
Picked up my six string began to play  
Just one touch and it started to say  
  
All your dreams will come true  
Lovely mansion with a pool so blue  
A red Ferrari and a model for a wife  
Oh yes it looks I was born for the good life  
  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I cant see  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I cant see  
  
A thousand motels waiting to trash  
Tv dinners well I love that bash  
And if you Eddie just say hi  
This partys open so drop on by  
  
All your dreams will come true  
A sunny haven from the inland revenue  
Hot nights in Paris a chance to dance  
Since I signed up Ive been living in a trance  
  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I cant see  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I cant see  
  
Im feeling sick like dawn of the dead  
Ive got marines marching through my head  
Johnboy Walton hes so nice  
So come in this must be paradise  
  
All your dreams will come true  
That lovely mansion with its pool so blue  
A red Ferrari and a model for a wife  
Oh yes it looks I was born for the good life  
  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I cant see  
Running up the highway looking for something  
Looking for something I cant see
