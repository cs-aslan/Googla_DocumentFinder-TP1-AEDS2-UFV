Its my time Its my life I can do what I like  
For the price of a smile  
I got a ticket to ride  
So I keep living cause it feels right  
And its so nice  
And Id do it all again  
This time its forever  
It gets better and I I I like how it feels

Time traveler two time zones give me some of my vodka any zone
