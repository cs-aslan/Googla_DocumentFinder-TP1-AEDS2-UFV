Jackie is a punk  
Judy is a runt  
They went down to the Mudd Club  
And they both got drunk  
Ohyeah  
  
Jackie is a bookie  
Judys taking loans  
They both came up to New York  
Just to see the Ramones  
Ohyeah  
  
And oh I dont know why she wrote that letter  
Oh no oh no  
Oh I dont know why  
We wont forget her oh no  
  
Jackies playing hooky  
Judys playing pool  
They both got caught for cutting  
Got to go to summer school  
Ohyeah  
  
Jackies scalping tickets  
Judys getting harassed  
They both got kicked outside  
Didnt have a backstage pass  
Ohyeah  
  
And oh I dont why she wrote that letter  
Oh no oh no  
And oh I dont know why  
dontt know whats on her mind  
I dont know no I dont know  
  
But I cant stand to see her cryin  
Shes still cryin she aint tryin  
Shes going to get left behind  
Nobody wants you nobody wants you
