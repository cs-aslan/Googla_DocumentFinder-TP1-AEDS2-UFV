Chorus  
Your Mama dont dance and your Daddy dont rock and roll  
Your Mama dont dance and your Daddy dont rock and roll  
But when evening comes around and its time to hit the town  
Where do you go  
You gotta rock it  
  
The old folks say that you gotta end your date by ten  
But if youre out on a date dont you bring her home late cause its a sin  
You know theres no excuse you know youre gonna lose you never win  
Ill say it again  
  
And its all because  
  
Chorus  
  
Everyone gather round let me tell you all about it  
You see I pulled into a drivein and I found a place to park  
We hopped into the backseat where its always nice and dark  
Were just about to move thinkin Bret this is a breeze  
Theres a light in my eye and a guy says Out of the car long hair  
  
Oowee youre coming with me  
Said the local police  
  
Chorus  
  
Play me a little CC  
  
Your Mama dont dance no  
She just dont dance no  
Your Mama dont dance and your Daddy dont rock and roll  
Ah yeah
