Just because all my dresses are just cotton hand me downs  
His family calls me the lower class  
Cause were only poor folks on the other side of town  
They wont let him walk up my path  
  
But my mama says dont worry when they say those things about you  
You remember youre just as good as him  
Just because they got that big house sittin way upon the hill  
Why you dont have to look up to them  
  
Weve got chicken every Sunday and the preacher comes around  
And every Saturday morning daddy takes us all to town  
And wed go to the picture show have picnics on the ground  
Oh thats the lower class then Im glad thats what I am  
  
Cause my mama dont belong to the ladies social set  
My daddy cant afford the country club  
His folks look down on me and they dont let us date  
Cause they think that Im not good enough  
  
But my mama says forgive him honey he aint worth at all  
And if anything youre too good for him  
Just because theyve got money and a big fine house  
Aha we wont take no sad talks off them  
  
Weve got chicken every Sunday and the preacher comes around  
And every Saturday morning daddy takes us all to town  
And wed go to the picture show have picnics on the ground  
Oh thats the lower class then Im glad thats what I am  
  
Weve got chicken every Sunday and the preacher comes around  
And every Saturday morning daddy takes us in to town
