I lit my love and watched it burn  
Asking nothing in return  
Except the lessons I will learn  
From holding crazy faith  
  
Ive been touched by that bright fire  
Down to the root of my desire  
While the smoke it rises higher  
Glowing crazy faith  
  
Youre not asking if I love this man  
I know you dont you dont believe you can  
Yet Ive seen the love open like a dancers fan  
Its crazy I know but my faith says so  
It tells me  
  
Am I a fool for hanging long  
Would I be a fool for being long gone  
When is daylight gonna dawn  
On my crazy faith  
  
The questions will not let me sleep  
The dance is buried way too deep  
But the bottom lover lovers keep  
Made by crazy faith  
  
Youre not asking if I love this man  
I know you dont you dont believe you can  
Yet Ive seen the love open like a dancers fan  
Its crazy I know but my faith says so  
It tells me  
  
Love youre losin those you love  
Let the hope fly from the glove  
Do not search the skies above  
Search your crazy faith  
  
Love is lightning love is ice  
It only strikes the lucky twice  
Once or you will know the price  
And once for crazy faith  
  
Youre not asking if I love this man  
I know you dont you dont believe you can  
Yet Ive seen the love open like a dancers fan  
Its crazy I know but my faith says so
