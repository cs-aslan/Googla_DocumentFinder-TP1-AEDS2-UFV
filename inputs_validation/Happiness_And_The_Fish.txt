I confess  
Everyone is overweight  
And Im obsessed  
Talking is just masturbating  
  
Without the mess  
Addiction leaves you sad today  
And unimpressed  
I cant remember all the names  
  
Everyone you meet today  
Is just so fucking vain  
Bored again by happiness  
And all those friends Ive lost in there Ive lost in there  
  
Im upset  
Happiness is not a fish  
That you can catch  
Imagination cant resist  
  
The laziness  
That pins you down get on your knees  
Everyone you meet is feeling  
Useless and ashamed  
  
Bored again by happiness  
And all those friends Ive lost in  
  
Everyone you meet is feeling  
Useless and ashamed  
Bored again by happiness  
And all those friends Ive lost in there  
  
But I wont remember  
But I wont forget this  
But I wont forget the love  
  
But I wont remember  
But I wont forget this  
But I already felt the love  
I lost in there
