The Lord knows Ive tried  
To do whats right  
For five whole long years I stayed home  
Both day and night  
And I smell trouble  
I smell trouble ahead of me  
Yes worries and trouble  
No they just wont let me be  
People talk about me  
Both night and day  
I cried Lord please forgive them  
And I go the other way  
I smell trouble  
Lord I smell trouble ahead of me  
Yes worries and trouble  
No they just wont let me be  
And from now on  
I will not run and hide  
Im gonna face trouble with a smile  
And hope they pass me by  
I smell trouble  
Lord I smell trouble way up there ahead of me  
Yes worries and trouble  
Lord they just wont they just wont  
They just wont let me be oh no
