Chorus  
How blue can you make me  
How long till I heal  
How can I go on loving you when youre gone  
How blue can I feel  
  
Oh honey why did you leave me  
Aint you got a heart left in your chest  
I swear to you that Im dying  
Cause my mind wont let my body rest  
  
Chorus  
  
If I sink any lower Ill go under  
If I cry anymore Ill go blind  
Oh there aint no relief for this missing you grief  
How long can you torture my mind  
  
Chorus  
  
How can I go on loving you when youre gone  
How blue can I feel
