When I was young it seemed that life was so wonderful  
A miracle oh it was beautiful magical  
And all the birds in the trees well theyd be singing so happily  
Joyfully playfully watching me  
But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible  
Logical responsible practical  
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable  
Clinical intellectual cynical  
  
There are times when all the worlds asleep  
The questions run too deep  
For such a simple man  
Wont you please please tell me what weve learned  
I know it sounds absurd  
But please tell me who I am  
  
Now watch what you say or theyll be calling you a radical  
Liberal fanatical criminal  
Wont you sign up your name wed like to feel youre  
Acceptable respectable presentable a vegetable  
  
At night when all the worlds asleep  
The questions run so deep  
For such a simple man  
Wont you please please tell me what weve learned  
I know it sounds absurd  
But please tell me who I am
