Your eyes say  
Youve been heartache and more  
I know cause girl  
Ive walked that road before  
But baby  
You can just forget  
That word called cry  
Cause Ill be there right beside you  
  
And I got love for you  
Baby all I got to give  
I got love for you for as long as I live  
Let me see your smile now girl  
  
Baby dont look back  
To where youve been  
It wont ever be that way again  
Theres not a lot of things  
That I got plenty of  
But love believe what Im sayin  
  
Cause I got love for you  
Baby all I got to give  
I got love for you for as long as I live  
Its gotta be alright now  
  
Therell be no one doin you harm  
No dont be afraid child  
Love youre safe in my arms  
Gonna be no hurt never no more  
No pain not like before  
No fears baby for sure  
Just love forever more  
  
Cause I got love for you  
Baby all I got to give  
I got love for you for as long as I live  
So hold me tight now  
So hold me tight now  
Baby
