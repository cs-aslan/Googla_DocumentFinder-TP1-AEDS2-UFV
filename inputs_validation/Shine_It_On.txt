Ive had my troubles  
I know youve had your troubles too  
Sometimes when you need a little sunshine  
It keeps rainin down on you  
  
But Im not gonna let it get me down  
Keep on pullin things are gonna come around  
Shine it on  
Shine it on  
  
Little blueeyed woman  
She made me feel so fine  
She got what she wanted  
Then she moved on down the line  
  
Yes I know about the pain  
Tears are gonna fall  
Just like rain  
  
Chorus  
Shine it on  
Look around you see whats goin on  
Shine it on  
Before you end up out there on your own  
Dont let some rainy day steal your heart away  
You got to go on  
Its just the dark before the dawn  
Shine it on  
  
Shine it on  
Look around you see whats goin on  
Shine it on  
Before you end up out there on your own  
  
Dont let some rainy day steal your heart away  
Shine it on  
Look around you see whats goin on  
Shine it on  
  
Before you end up out there on your own  
Shine it on oh baby  
Shine it on shine it on shine it on  
Shine it on
