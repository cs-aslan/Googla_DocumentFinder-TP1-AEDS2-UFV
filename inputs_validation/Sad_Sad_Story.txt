Look at the lady shes the one with the broken heart  
Even so she musnt know that Ive loved her from the start  
She needs a friend now more than a new romance  
Id love to take her in my arms but I cant take the chance  
  
Chorus  
Ooh its such a sad sad story but therell be a happy ending  
Just you wait and see what I can do ooooh  
When you see a lady cryin can you blame a guy for tryin  
To move on in and make his dreams come true  
  
I gotta secret but Im keeping it to myself  
Im bored to tears when my heart hears that she loves someone else  
I tell her Im sorry but its really just a lie  
Cos every time he hurts her Im so happy I could die  
  
Ooh its such a sad sad story but therell be a happy ending  
Just you wait and see what I can do ooooh  
When you see a lady cryin can you blame a guy for tryin  
To move on in and make his dreams come true  
  
I love the lady and I want to make her smile  
I know shes lonely but it only hurts for a little while  
Soon as its over you know the sun is gonna shine  
And when shes ready for someone new guess whos first in line  
  
Ooh its such a sad sad story but therell be a happy ending  
Just you wait and see what I can do ooooh  
When you see a lady cryin can you blame a guy for tryin  
To move on in and make his dreams come true  
  
Ooh its such a sad sad story but therell be a happy ending  
Just you wait and see what I can do ooooh  
When you see a lady cryin can you blame a guy for tryin  
To move on in and make his dreams come true
