Pick me a town  
In any clime  
Where people like  
A rockin time  
And stay awake  
Both day and night  
Till everybodys feelin good an right  
Then throw me  
Smack dab in the middle  
I want to be  
Smack dab in the middle  
Ahhhhh smack dab in the middle boys now  
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul  
Ten Cadillacs  
A diamond mill  
Ten suits of clothes  
To dress to kill  
A ten room house  
Some Bar be Q  
And fifty chicks not over twentytwo  
Then throw me  
Smack dab in the middle  
Oh I want to be  
Smack dab in the middle  
Ahhhhh now boys you can see why I want to be smack dab in the middle now  
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul  
One hundred beds  
with chorus girls  
A street thats paved  
with natural pearls  
a wagon load  
of bonds and stocks  
Then open up the door at Fort Knox  
Then throw me  
Smack dab in the middle

A lot of bread and gangs of meat  
Oodles of butter and somethin sweet  
Gallons of coffee to wash it down  
Bicarbonated soda by the pound  
Then throw me  
Smack dab in the middle

Smack dab in the middle  
Ahhhhh throw me now smack dab in the middle right now  
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul
