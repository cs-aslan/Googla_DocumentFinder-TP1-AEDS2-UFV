Well Im standing by the river  
But the water doesnt flow  
It boils with every poison you can think of  
And Im underneath the streetlight  
But the light of joy I know  
Scared beyond belief way down in the shadows  
And the perverted fear of violence  
Chokes the smile on every face  
And common sense is ringing out the bell  
This aint no technological breakdown  
Oh no this is the road to hell  
  
And all the roads jam up with credit  
And theres nothing you can do  
Its all just pieces of paper flying away from you  
Oh look out world take a good look  
What comes down here  
You must learn this lesson fast and learn it well  
This aint no upwardly mobile freeway  
Oh no this is the road  
Said this is the road  
This is the road to hell
