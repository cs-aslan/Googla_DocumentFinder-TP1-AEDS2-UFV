Verse 1  
Its over the line  a shadow of doubt  
From outside looking at the in crowd  
Tempting voices are calling you  
They look mighty fine  a sight to behold  
But all that glitters is not gold  
Still those voices are calling you  
  
Chorus  
All your missing is a heartache  
A disillusion for a keepsake  
A life of living with your own mistake  
All youre missing in a heartache  
  
Verse 2  
The water is high  youre out on a limb  
Well if you take the fall then its sink or swim  
Clouds of reason will follow you  
Youre kissing the dark  
Youre courting your pride  
You wonder is it greater on the other side  
But they have nothing to offer you  
  
Chorus
