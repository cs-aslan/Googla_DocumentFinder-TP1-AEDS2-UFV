Ah I feel a fountain in my brain  
Icecold water runnin through my pain  
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears  
Heart so sad cause loves gone bad  
  
I see a rainbow all in black  
Must be a sign that you aint comin back  
Wake up at night callin your name  
I see a face on my window pane  
  
Ive been this way since youve been gone  
Without your love I cant go on  
Look in the mirror what do I see  
A cryin face kinda looks like me  
Now wheres the love you promised me  
Wheres he tenderness to comfort me  
  
Everytime some love I choose  
I seem to always be the one to lose  
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears  
Heart fells sad cause loves gone bad  
Loves gone bad heart fells bad  
  
Black crows flying up above  
Its a sign that I live life without love  
Slimes on the man slimes ont the sea  
Slimes everywhere I said Im destined to be  
  
And this world where nothings right  
Since youve been gone I cant sleep at night  
You said youd be true to me  
Instead you made a fool out of me  
Heart feels sad loves gone bad
