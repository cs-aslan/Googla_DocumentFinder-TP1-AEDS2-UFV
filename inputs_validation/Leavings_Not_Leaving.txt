Sometimes a time comes along  
when its time to time to move on  
Youll still be there in everything that I do  
And wherever I go  
Ill remember you  
  
Leavings not leaving  
Cause Im not leaving you behind  
Youll always be with me always be with me  
Part of my heart for all time  
Where Im going  youre going  
Even if its just in my mind  
Leavings not leaving  
Im not leaving you behind  
  
Moments shared there with you  
Theyre the best times that I ever knew  
Theyll still be there when goodbyes are all though  
Ill remember those days  
Ill remember you  
  
Leavings not leaving  
cause Im not leaving you behind  
Youll always be with me always be with me  
Part of my heart for all time  
Where Im going  youre going  
Even if its just in my mind  
Leavings not leaving  
Im not leaving you behind  
  
Ill hold on the memories  
cause in my heart youll be here with me  
Theres no reason to cry  
Goodbye isnt really goodbye  
  
Leavings not leaving  
cause Im not leaving you behind  
Youll always be with me always be with me  
Part of my heart for all time  
Where Im going  youre going  
Even if its just in my mind  
Leavings not leaving  
Im not leaving you behind  
  
Leavings not leaving  
Not leaving you behind  
Im not leaving you  
Im not leaving you behind  
  
Leavings not leaving  
Im not leaving you  
Im not leaving you behind
