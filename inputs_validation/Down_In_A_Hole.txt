Bury me softly in this womb  
I give this part of me for you  
Sand rains down and here I sit  
Holding rare flowers  
In a tomb in bloom  
  
Down in a hole and I dont know if I can be saved  
See my heart I decorate it like a grave  
You dont understand who they  
Thought I was supposed to be  
Look at me now a man  
Who wont let himself be  
  
Down in a hole feeling so small  
Down in a hole losing my soul  
Id like to fly  
But my wings have been so denied  
  
Down in a hole and theyve put all  
The stones in their place  
Ive eaten the sun so my tongue  
Has been burned of the taste  
I have been guilty  
Of kicking myself in the teeth  
I will speak no more  
Of my feelings beneath  
  
Down in a hole feelin so small  
Down in a hole losin my soul  
Id like to fly but my  
Wings have been so denied  
  
Bury me softly in this womb  
Oh I want to be inside of you  
I give this part of me for you  
Oh I want to be inside of you  
Sand rains down and here I sit  
Holding rare flowers  
Oh I want to be inside of you  
In a tomb in bloom  
Oh I want to be inside  
  
Down in a hole feelin so small  
Down in a hole losin my soul  
Down in a hole feelin so small  
Down in a hole outta control  
Id like to fly but my  
Wings have been so denied
