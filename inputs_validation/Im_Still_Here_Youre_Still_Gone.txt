The sun comes up and youre still gone the world goes round and life goes
on  
But life is short and love is long and when the sun goes down youre still  
Gone now aint it strange how we make things right we think things change  
Overnight but then the sun comes up and the night moves on and Im still here  
And youre still gone  
I guess I missed the point I thought I was doin right Id get up early
morning  
And work into the night I was always makin money I shoulda been makin love  
Now the man Im today knows that money aint enought but if I had a chance to  
Give one more thing it wouldnt be a rose or a diamond ring cause you showed  
Me where I went wrong cause Im still here and youre still gone hey I guess  
I missed the point I thought I was doin right Id get up early in the monrin  
And work into the night I was always makin money I shoulda been makin love  
Now the man Im today knows that money aint enough the sun comes up and  
Youre still gone the world goes round and life goes on and you showed me  
Where I went wrong cause Im still here yourre still gone yes Im still  
Here and youre still gone
