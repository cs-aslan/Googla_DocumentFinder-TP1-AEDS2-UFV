Well its eight oclock in Boise Idaho  
Ill find my limo driver  
Mister take us to the show  
I done made some plans for later on tonight  
Ill find a little queen  
And I know I can treat her right  
  
Chorus  
Whats your name little girl  
Whats your name  
Shootin you straight little girl  
Wont you do the same  
  
Back at the hotel  
Lord we got such a mess  
It seems that one of the crew  
Had a go with one of the guests oh yes  
Well the police said we cant drink in the bar  
What a shame  
Wont you come upstairs girl  
And have a drink of champagne  
  
Whats your name little girl  
Whats your name  
Shootin you straight little girl  
For there aint no shame  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Nine oclock the next day  
And Im ready to go  
I got six hundred miles to ride  
To do one more show oh no  
Can I get you a taxi home  
It sure was grand  
When I come back here next year  
I want to see you again  
  
What was your name little girl  
Whats your name  
Shootin you straight little girl  
Well there aint no shame  
What was your name little girl  
Whats your name  
Shootin you straight little girl  
Wont you do the same
