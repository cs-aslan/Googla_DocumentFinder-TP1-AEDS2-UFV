Son of God purest light Lord on high is here tonight  
Stamping through this sacred sky suddenly our eyes behold  
Heavens perfect plan unfold son of God  
  
Son of God love divine timeless one steps in to die  
Who could dream of such a thing with us now the King of Kings  
Man and angels bow and sing singing Hallelujah Hallelujah  
  
Were singing Gloria Hallelujah  
Were singing Gloria Hallelujah  
Were singing Gloria Hallelujah  
Were singing Gloria  
  
Were singing Gloria Hallelujah  
Were singing Gloria Hallelujah  
Were singing Gloria Hallelujah  
Were singing Gloria  
  
Were singing Gloria Hallelujah  
Emmanuel  
Were singing Gloria Hallelujah  
Emmanuel  
Were singing Gloria Hallelujah  
  
Our God is with us  
Emmanuel our God is with us  
Were singing Hallelujah  
Singing Gloria
