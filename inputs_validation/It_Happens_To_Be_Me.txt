Someone longs for you and your caress  
Hes learning now how empty arms can be  
Someone who used to know your kiss not long ago  
That someone happens to be me  
  
How he misses you and must confess  
Without you hes like driftwood on the sea  
Hes just a dreamer who is still in love with you  
That dreamer happens to be me  
  
Ill never know just why we parted  
Its more than I can comprehend  
I only know when you departed  
You started a night that has no end  
  
Perhaps therell come a time when youre alone  
Your heart still haunted by a memory  
If then you chance to find theres someone on your mind  
I hope it happens to be me  
  
Perhaps therell come a time when youre alone  
Your heart still haunted by a memory  
If then you chance to find theres someone on your mind  
I hope it happens to be me  
  
I hope it happens to be me
