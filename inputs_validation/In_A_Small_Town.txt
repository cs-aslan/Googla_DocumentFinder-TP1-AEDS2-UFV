Well Ive been lost in this town  
Even though I know my way around  
Didnt take me long until I found the devil  
With just one word I knew his voice  
Is the one I heard in every choice I made  
Just trying to be a rebel  
In a small town in a small town  
  
If you jumped off of our front porch  
Youd land right where the Civil War was fought  
And its never been forgotten  
Its twenty miles to the interstate  
Theres a Burger King and a Motel Eight  
And the only thing between here and there is cotton  
  
And Jeffrey prays to Jesus asking him please just help us through one more day  
Jenny gets high she wastes her life but me I just ran away  
From a small town from a small town  
  
Sometimes it was heaven sometimes hell  
Kinda like church kinda like jail  
Theres a water tower says Welcome to nowhere  
As soon as I could I was long gone  
My jeans were torn and my hair was long  
Now I cant believe I wanna go back there  
To a small town to a small town  
  
Jeffrey prays to Jesus asking him please just help us through one more day  
Jenny gets high she wastes her life but me I just ran away  
But I knew Id come back some day  
To a small town to a small town  
Oh to a small town to a small town
