Chorus  
Girl happy yes Im girl happy  
Girl happy cant you see  
  
Every girl I see looks good to me  
What crazy way I were to be  
I love a life of nothing but beautiful women  
Well  
  
Chorus  
  
Every time I see a pretty face  
My heart just heads for outer space  
I need a girl to make my life worth of living  
Yes  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive been like this since I was just a baby boy  
First nurse that rocked my cradle made me jump to joy  
Mama keep your daughter out of sight  
Im in a loving mood tonight  
I love a life of nothing but beautiful women  
Well  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive been like this since I was just a baby boy  
First nurse that rocked my cradle made me jump to joy
