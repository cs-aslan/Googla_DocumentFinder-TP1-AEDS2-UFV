Goodday sunlight  
Id like to say how truly bright you are  
You dont know me but I know you  
Youre my favorite star  
Follow you I will so lets get moving  
  
Who needs shelter when the mornings coming  
Absolutely theres no one  
Who needs shelter from the sun  
Not me no not anyone  
  
By your clock the cock rooster crows  
Then off to work where everybody goes  
Slow But eventually they get there  
Picking up the day shift back where all left off  
Confined and pecking at relationships  
You know its only a worthless piece of shit  
  
Who needs shelter when the mornings coming  
Absolutely theres no one  
Who needs shelter from the sun  
Not me no not anyone  
  
Id sleep it all away but the sun wont let me  
Id miss those lovely days of summer  
  
Goodday sunlight  
Id like to say how truly bright you are  
You dont know me but I know you  
Youre my favorite
