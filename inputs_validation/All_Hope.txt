All hope is gone  
Youve lost your guts for fightin  
Youre hangin your head  
and dont know where to turn  
Dont cry dont fear  
Cause I will never leave you  
I give you my life  
If you believe in me  
  
Its amazing how everything turns out so right  
You were lost now youre found by the love by the life  
That you kindely meet its time youre near  
Gonna love you the way Im created to do  
  
All hope is gone  
Youve lost your guts for fightin  
Youre hangin your head  
and dont know where to turn  
Dont cry dont fear  
Cause I will never leave you  
I give you my life  
If you believe in me  
Can you show me that stone Can you tell me that rock  
That is larger than us and can move what is right  
No coincidence Im in love with you  
Gonna love you the way Im created to do  
  
Oh oh oh believe me  
  
Believe me when all hope is gone  
Youve lost your guts for fightin  
Youre hangin your head  
and dont know where to turn  
Dont cry dont fear  
Cause I will never leave you  
I give you my life  
If you believe in me  
  
All hope is gone  
Youve lost your guts for fightin  
Youre hangin your head  
and dont know where to turn  
Dont cry dont fear  
Cause I will never leave you  
I give you my life  
If you believe in me
