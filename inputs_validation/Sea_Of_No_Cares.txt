When youre in love theres no time and no space  
Theres a permanent smile on your face  
Your friends all complain that youre going insane  
But the truth is theyre just afraid  
  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
  
When you decide that what counts is inside  
Your friends all say Its a lie  
But theres no brighter light than the look in her eyes  
When youre walking her home through the night  
  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
  
Let yourself go with the tide  
Theres an angel by your side  
Tonight  
  
Back at the bar getting cynically stoned  
Your friends are drinking alone  
But its funny they dont even cross your mind  
When she asks you into her home  
  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares  
Hey somewhere  
You threw your fear in the sea of no cares
