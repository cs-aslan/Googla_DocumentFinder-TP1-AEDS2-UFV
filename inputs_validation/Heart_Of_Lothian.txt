Wide boys wide boys wide boys  
Born with hearts of Lothian  
Wide boys we were wide boys  
Born with hearts of Lothian  
Wide boys we were wide boys  
These hearts of Lothian  
  
Its six oclock in the tower blocks  
Stalagmites of culture shock  
And the trippers of the light fantastic  
Bow down hoedown  
Spray their pheromones on this perfume uniform  
  
And anarchy smiles in the Royal Mile  
And theyre waiting on the slyboys flyboys wideboys  
Rooting tooting cowboys  
Lucky little ladies at the watering holes  
Theyll score the Friday night goals  
  
I was born with a heart of Lothian  
I was born with a heart of Lothian  
With a heart of Lothian  
  
I was born with a heart of Lothian  
With a heart of Lothian
