Ive got a bone to pick with this world  
But Im not very handsome I cant find a girl  
I asked the aid of the whole universe  
Im not very happy it could be worse  
  
Chorus  
Somebody help me yeahyeahyeah  
Somebody help me yeahyeahyeah  
Somebody please somebody please help me  
  
Ive been searchin all over town  
Tryin to find a girl whod dare to vow  
The birds and the bees are helping me around  
Were turning this whole town upside down  
  
Ive been watching the clock on the wall  
Ive been waiting for my baby to call  
Ive been pacin all the floor  
Waiting for my baby to knock on the door
