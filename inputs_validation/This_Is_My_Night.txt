Im puttin on my makeup  
Its time to wake up  
The owners of the night are calling me  
Im ready and Im willing  
To pull out the happy feeling  
Something specials in the air for me  
  
The night is mine  
Im gonna keep it just right  
An angel in my pocket right  
Feels so right  
This mirrors tellin no lie  
Gonna let this magic shine  
  
CHORUS  
This is my night tonight  
Im gonna do it just right  
Im gonna let this magic shine  
This is my night tonight  
Im gonna do it just right  
Im gonna let this magic shine  
  
I feel like winning  
i dont know the reason  
Something telling me to let it ride  
Got me rockin and reeling  
I dont know what the deal is  
Something special I just cant describe  
  
The night is mine  
Im gonna keep it just right  
On my way to paradise  
Feels so fine  
Feels just like the first time  
Gonna gonna let this magic shine  
  
CHORUS  
This is my night this is my night this is my night  
The night is young let it shine come out  
This is this is my night this this is my night  
This is my my my my my night my my my  
  
This feels so right  
This mirrors tellin no lie  
Im gonna let this magic shine  
Let it shine let it shine  
  
This is my night tonight

Im gonna let this magic shine let it shine  
This is my night my night
