Ive heard it said that the weight of the worlds problems  
Is enough to make the ball fall right through space  
That it aint even worth it to live  
With all thats goin wrong  
Well let me just go down as saying  
That Im glad to be here  
Here with all the same pain  
And laughs everybody knows  
Some men think theyre born to be king  
Maybe thats true  
But I think passing love around  
Is all we were born to do  
Let them build their kingdoms  
Let them make the laws for this world to heed  
Cause you and I make life worth living  
Right here in each others arms  
Im here to love you baby  
No more loneliness yeah  
No more emptiness oh  
Im here to love you yeah yeah  
Let them build their kingdoms  
Let them make the laws for this world to heed  
Cause you and I make life worth living  
Right here in each others arms  
Im here to love you baby  
No more loneliness yeah  
No more emptiness oh  
Im here to love you  
Im here to love you  
Just let me go on loving you  
Dont stop me now while Im feeling this way  
Just let me go on loving you  
Dont stop me now while Im feeling this way  
Just let me go on loving you  
Dont stop me now while Im feeling this way  
Just let me go on loving you  
Dont stop me now while Im feeling this way  
Just let me go on loving you
