I may be wrong I may be right  
Moneys short and time is tight  
Dont even think about those bills  
Dont pay the price we never will  
Were out again another night  
I never have enough  
It will be like this forever  
If we fall in love  
  
Tonight is forever tell me now you dont disagree  
Tonight is forever open the door you hold the key  
  
I may be wrong I may be right  
So dont depend I could lie  
I havent got a job to pay  
But I could stay in bed all day  
Then out again another night  
I never have enough  
It will be like this forever  
If we fall in love  
  
Tonight is forever tell me now you dont disagree  
Tonight is forever open the door you hold the key  
Tonight tonight tonight tonight  
Tonight is the first night  
  
We dont need any more when we dance  
I dont think of the future tonight  
  
Tonight is forever tell me now you dont disagree  
Tonight is forever open the door you hold the key  
  
I may be wrong I may be right  
But I dont give up any night  
You could say conventional  
And I could claim intentional  
Were out again another night  
We never have enough  
It will be like this forever  
When we fall in love  
  
Tonight is forever tell me now you dont disagree  
Tonight is forever open the door you hold the key  
Tonight is forever tell me now you dont disagree  
Tonight is forever open the door you hold the key  
  
Tonight
