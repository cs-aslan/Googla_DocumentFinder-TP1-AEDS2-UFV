Hes forty but he thinks that hes twenty  
Hes got that boyish grin and he grins plenty  
At every pretty girl that hes passin  
He thinks that theyre all his for the asking  
  
Hes never aged a day hear him swear  
Loving cares done wonders for his hair  
Except a few bald spots are showing  
The old roosters back and hes crowing  
  
Chorus  
The Old roosters back and hes crowing  
Age aint taught him nothing and its showin  
One of these days hell wake up and know  
Hes been knocked off his roostin pole  
  
Hes the king of the roost see him struttin  
For punishment that ole boys a glutton  
This old hen might start feather picking  
If he dont stop eye balling the chickens  
  
Adamantly hes taken by the truck load  
He says that hes never gonna grow old  
But Ive got news for him thats quite alarming  
He became a grandpa this morning  
  
Chorus
