Somebody Somebody  
Come to my side  
Im tired Im crying  
Im sick inside  
My woman that woman  
Just wasnt right  
  
Help me now please my friend  
I never felt so bad before  
Never never before  
  
So funny so funny  
Just like a show  
One name two people  
All in a row  
Somebody Somebody  
Someone must go  
  
Help me now please my friend  
I never felt so bad before  
Never never before  
  
I was hurt when I was younger  
By a woman who was cold  
She took my name  
She took my body  
And she threw away my soul  
  
Cant hide I cant hide my misery  
I know my sorrow wont set me free  
She did it dyou see she did it to me  
  
Help me now please my friend  
I never felt so bad before  
Never never before
