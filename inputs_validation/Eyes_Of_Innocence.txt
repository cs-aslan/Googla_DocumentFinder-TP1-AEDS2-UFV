When I look into your eyes  
I can see all your hopes and dreams  
I can feel your warm desires  
And I know youre wanting me  
Youve got to use discretion  
I dont know if its right  
To take away that look from you  
By loving you tonight  
  
Im looking in the eyes  
In the eyes of innocence  
I dont know if its right to feel this way  
Im looking in the eyes  
In the eyes of innocence  
And Im afraid of the way  
You look at me  
  
Something inside keeps telling me  
This is a love that cannot be  
And even though I should not stay  
Cant bring myself to walk away  
Youre holding my affections  
I dont know if its right  
To take away that look from you  
By loving you tonight  
  
Im looking in the eyes  
In the eyes of innocence  
I dont know if its right to feel this way  
Im looking in the eyes  
In the eyes of innocence  
And Im afraid of the way you  
Look at me  
Im looking in the eyes  
In the eyes of innocence  
I dont know if its right to feel this way  
Im looking in the eyes  
In the eyes of innocence  
And Im afraid of the way  
Im afraid of the way  
Im afraid of the way you look at me
