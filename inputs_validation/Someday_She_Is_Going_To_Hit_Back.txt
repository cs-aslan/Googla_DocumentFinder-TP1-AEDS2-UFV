Woman dont like it hurting her this way  
Someday she is going to hit back  
The woman dont like me in her own way  
Someday she is going to hit back  
Woman dont like it treating her like this  
Someday she is going to hit back  
The woman she dont love the lonely  
Someday she is going to hit back  
  
Woman dont like it begging on her knees  
Someday she is going to hit back  
Oh please please dont desert me  
Someday she is going to hit back  
Woman dont like it treating her this way  
Someday she is going to hit back  
There is tenderness in the heart of the lonely  
Someday she is going to hit back  
  
Someday she is going to hit back 4 times  
Woman dont like it 4 times  
Someday she is going to hit back 4 times  
  
She feels so lonely  
Woman dont like it  
She feels so blue  
Woman dont like it  
He has lost her now  
Woman dont like it  
Oh woman you knew what she could do  
Woman dont like it  
  
Woman dont like it says it has to stop  
Someday she is going to hit back  
The woman she says she doesnt love me  
Someday she is going to hit back  
Woman dont like it the woman dont say a lot  
Someday she is going to hit back  
With one last kiss she leaves him lonely  
Someday she is going to hit back
