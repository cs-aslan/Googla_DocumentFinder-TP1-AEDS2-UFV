Just drifting along with the world  
Every motion is paranoid and paralyzing  
Give it up or give em hope  
Let us all survive the wake  
  
We were a race a human race  
Under the glass behind it all  
Watch us crawl so fearfully  
I might be wrong after all  
But werent we just so delicate yesterday  
  
Sit back and think about it  
Sleep it off sleep on it  
Come to and make your motions  
  
Listen up  
  
Theres a calling ahead  
A desperation  
A falling of man  
We are all lost in the sound of separation  
  
Hands in the air and love at our sides  
Theres gotta be something bigger  
With the beating in our throats  
And the tremble in our grip  
This cant be it  
  
Ill come up for peace  
Ill come down for truth  
Ill give in Ill give up for you  
  
The floors are shaking  
And weve lost our step  
Oh Lord have mercy on us all  
  
The Created Void  
Lets do this for each other  
Lets do this for truth  
I give for you you give for me  
Let me take you somewhere I cant explain  
Im stumbling right in front of you now  
I wont refrain from guiding you there  
Normal is not so far  
Was it just a dream  
Or something much more  
We are not alone  
Since you agreed to follow  
Its all in my head if you want you can look inside  
Theres nothing but red and all the mess Ive been  
Its all in the way I say what I dont mean and mean what I dont  
I need to speak of you and what is real  
They will never understand  
What eats at our insides
