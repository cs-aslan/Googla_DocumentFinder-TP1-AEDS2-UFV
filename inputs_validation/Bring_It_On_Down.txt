What was that sound ringing around your brain  
Today was just a blur you gotta head like a ghost train  
What was that sound ringing around your brain  
Youre here on your own who you gonna find to blame  
  
Youre the outcast youre the underclass  
But you dont care because youre living fast  
Youre the uninvited guest who stays till the end  
I know youve got a problem that the devil sends  
  
You think theyre talking bout you but you dont know who  
Ill be scraping your life from the soul of my shoe tonight  
Bring it on down Bring it down for me  
Your heads in a fish tank  
  
Your body and your mind cant breath  
Youre the outcast  youre the underclass  
But you dont care  because youre living fast  
Youre the uninvited guest who stays till the end  
  
I know youve got a problem that the devil sends  
You think theyre talking bout you but you dont know who  
Ill be scraping your life from the soul of my shoe tonight
