I saw the saddest thing other day  
When an old man pass my way  
Walking the streets so all alone  
All because he had no home  
  
But the saddest thing Ive ever seen  
Is a tear from a womans eye  
A tear from a womans eye  
Hmmm  
  
I saw a man no shoes on his feet  
But the saddest thing is to see a woman weep  
A woman is tender thing  
To see her cry a sad sad thing  
  
Nothing touches me deeper inside  
Than a tear from a womans eye  
A tear from a womans eye  
Hmmm  
  
A womans tears dropping on her cheek  
Is like a sound of thunder that loudly it rings  
Cause when I see her cry I know she hurts inside  
  
Yes the saddest thing Ive ever seen  
Is a tear from a womans eye  
A tear from a womans eye  
Hmmm  
  
Sad sad thing is a tear from a womans eye  
A sad sad thing is to see a woman cry  
Sad sad sad thing is a tear from a womans eye  
Sad sad sad thing is to see a woman cry
