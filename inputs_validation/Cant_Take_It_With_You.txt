Cant take it with you  
Everybody knows  
Cant take it with you when you go  
Cant hide your love away  
Save it up for a rainy day  
Ya cant take it with you when you go  
And it hurts so bad when you finally have to show  
  
Chorus  
Cant take it with you  
Everybody knows  
Cant take it with you when you go  
Cant hide your love away  
Save it up for a rainy day  
You cant take it with you when you go  
No you cant take it with you when you go Ooo  
No you cant take it with you when you go oh no  
Play it high or low  
Break the bank in Monte Carlo  
You can play it just the way it falls  
Cut it like you want to  
But it just might come back and haunt you  
Lady Lucks your mama when she calls  
  
Chorus  
  
Hotwire a fast car  
Just to take a ride  
You can run but you sure cannot hide  
Oh tell her a lie  
And live with it til you die but you  
Cant take it with you when you go  
  
Chorus
