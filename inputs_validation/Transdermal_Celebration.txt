Transdermal celebration  
Caused a slight mutation  
In the rift  
It toppled down a nation  
And left the people running for the hills  
But the mutants that I see  
Shine their beauty unto me  
I wish you could see them  
  
Tectonic tribulation  
Formed a crust of green beyond the reef  
Waves fell in formation  
Cause the plants to bend with spiked leaves  
Im growing with the land  
Time has taken my hands and let me touch them  
  
Hey hey  
A billion miles to Mark A  
Lay on the lawn hes already home  
When the morning ray hits his face  
  
Transdermal celebration  
Jets flew in formation  
I could see them  
Dropping the crustaceans  
Leaving trails of flames in their wake  
But where is the mutation  
Who once told me it was safe I cant find him
