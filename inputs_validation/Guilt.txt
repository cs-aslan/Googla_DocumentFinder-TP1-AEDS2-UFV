I feel guilt I feel guilt  
Though I know Ive done no wrong I feel guilt  
I feel guilt I feel guilt  
Though I know Ive done no wrong I feel guilt  
I feel bad so bad  
Though I aint done nothing wrong I feel bad  
I feel bad so bad  
Though I aint done nothing wrong I feel bad  
I never lied to my lover  
But if I did I would admit it  
If I could get away with murder  
Id take my gun and Id commit it  
I never gave to the rich I never stole from the poor  
Im like a curious child give me more  
More more more more more more  
I feel blood I feel blood  
Though I feel it in my veins its not enough  
I feel blood I feel blood  
Though its streaming through my veins its not enough  
I never stole a scarf from harrods  
But if I did you wouldnt miss it  
I never stole a doll from lovecraft  
But if I did you know Id kiss it  
I never stole from the rich I never gave to the poor  
Im like a curious child just give me more  
More more more more more more more more  
I feel guilt I feel guilt  
Though I know Ive done no wrong I feel guilt  
I feel guilt I feel guilt  
Though I aint done nothing wrong I feel guilt  
Guilt guilt guilt guilt  
Guilt guilt guilt guilt
