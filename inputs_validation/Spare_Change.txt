Aching longing  
Save all your hands for me  
Cause I wont share them  
With anything anyone no  
  
I grew from you  
Branches from a dying tree  
But I could save you  
If only you looked for me  
  
You cant break me  
Im a piggy bank on the floor  
Watch all my spare change  
Roll out the door  
Watch all my spare change  
Roll across the floor  
Watching me through  
Your glass door  
  
Save your smile for  
Everybody else you see  
Cause I dont want the  
One that you make for me  
  
You cant break me  
Im a piggy bank on the floor  
Watch all my spare change  
Roll out the door  
Watch all my spare change  
Roll across the floor  
Watching me through  
Your glass door  
Your door  
  
The more that Ive tried  
The more that youve pried  
Yourself away
