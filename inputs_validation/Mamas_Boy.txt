Couldnt keep a secret  
Got a concrete skull  
Couldnt shut up  
Youre an imbecile  
Youre an ugly dog  
Theres nothing to gain  
You couldnt shut up  
Got a bad bad brain  
  
Couldnt hold your tongue  
You were just too young  
Like a two year old  
You told you told  
You are all the same jelly  
Bean brain  
Every ones a secret nerd  
Every ones closet lame  
  
Mamamamamamamamamamas boy  
Dont want to work in a hot dog stand  
Be a busboy messenger or a doorman  
Its an abstract world  
Youre an abstract man  
Abstract city dont give a damn
