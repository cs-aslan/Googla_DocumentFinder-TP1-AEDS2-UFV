Dont give up when you feel you are far away  
You can lose yourself in the sound like its yesterday  
When the world wont stop and it gets too loud  
We can drown it on we can turn it round  
When the music high we can sing alone  
  
Bring us back in time to what we love  
Chorus  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together back together  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together back together  
When we need it most it will bring us close  
Hes what we all belong  
When we need it most it will bring us close  
Hes what we all belong  
Dont give up dont believe it could ever change  
Youre not alone and everybody it feels the same  
When the world wont stop and it gets too loud  
We can drown it on we can turn it round  
When the music high we can sing alone  
Bring us back in time to what we love  
Chorus  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together back together  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together back together  
When we need it most it will bring us close  
Hes what we all belong  
When we need it most it will bring us close  
Hes what we all belong  
Keeps us together and keep us strong  
When were together music plays on and on  
Chorus  
When we ahh when we ahh  
When we ahh when we ahh  
When we need it most it will bring us close  
And hes what we all belong
