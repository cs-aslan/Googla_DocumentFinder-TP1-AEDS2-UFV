Your toy balloon has sailed  
In the sky now  
But now it must fall to the ground  
Now your sad eyes reveal  
Just how badly you feel  
There is no easy way down  
  
The view from the cliffs  
Must have been exciting  
And up to the peaks  
You were bound  
Now youre stranded alone  
And the past is unknown  
And there is no easy way down  
  
And now it isnt very easy  
When you find yourself our on your own  
No it isnt very easy  
When each boat you take  
Is one more mistake  
Theres no one to break your fall  
Lead you back home  
  
We all like to climb  
To the hieights of love dear  
Where our fantasy world can be found  
But you must know in the end  
When its time to decend  
That there is no easy way down  
  
I know it isnt very easy  
When you find yourself out on your own  
No it isnt very easy  
When each road you take  
Is one more mistake  
Theres no one to break  
Your fall  
And lead you back home  
  
We all like to climb  
To the heights of love dear  
Where our fantasy world can be found  
But you must know in the end  
When its time to decend  
That there is no easy way down  
There is no easy way down
