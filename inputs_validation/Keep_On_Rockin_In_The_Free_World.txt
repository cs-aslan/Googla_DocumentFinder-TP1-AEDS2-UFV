Neil Young cover  
  
Colors on the street  
Red white and blue  
People shufflin their feet  
People sleepin in their shoes  
But theres a warnin sign  
On the road ahead  
Theres a lot of people sayin  
Wed be better off dead  
Dont feel like Satan  
But I am to them  
So I try to forget it  
Any way I can  
  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
  
I see a woman in the night  
With a baby in her hand  
Under an old street light  
Near a garbage can  
Now she puts the kid away  
And shes gone to get a hit  
She hates her life  
And what shes done to it  
Theres one more kid  
That will never go to school  
Never get to fall in love  
Never get to be cool  
  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
  
We got a thousand points of light  
For the homeless man  
We got a kinder gentler  
Machine gun hand  
We got department stores  
And toilet paper  
Got styrofoam boxes  
For the ozone layer  
Got a man of the people  
Says keep hope alive  
Got fuel to burn  
Got roads to drive  
  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world
