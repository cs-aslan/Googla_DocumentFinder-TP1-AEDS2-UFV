Maybe hes right  
Maybe Im wrong  
Maybe what Im saying is the way it should be  
Nobody knows when the truth goes by  
But everyone tells me that hes happy  
Maybe hes gone and found some love  
I want to see it for myself  
Everyone says just to let him alone  
But I cant even sleep no more it worries me so  
Why  
Why  
Maybe Im right  
Maybe hes wrong  
And maybe what hes saying is the way it should be  
Somebody tried to explain it to me  
But they couldnt tell me if hes happy  
And I just want to know if hes still happy
