With tears in my eyes dear I begged you to stay  
You couldnt forgive me so you went away  
I made a mistake dear by tellin you lies  
Now I lay awake dear with tears in my eyes  
  
No more to be sweetheart no more to be friend  
Please give me a chance dear and Ill make amends  
My yesterdays haunt me my weary heart cries  
I just cant go on dear with tears in my eyes  
  
If you ever need me oh please let me know  
Wherever you lead me Im willin to go  
The past is a flower that withers and dies  
Ill wake up tomorrow with tears in my eyes  
  
With tears in my eyes dear I begged you to stay  
You couldnt forgive me so you went away  
I made a mistake dear by tellin you lies  
Now I lay awake dear with tears in my eyes
