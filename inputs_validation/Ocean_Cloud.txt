Hes seen too much of life  
And theres no going back  
The loneliness calls him  
And the edge which must be sharpened  
Hes losing it And he knows  
But theres a fighter in his mind and his bodys tough  
The years have been unkind but kind enough  
  
The smell of the earth  
Its his favourite smell  
But hes somehow compelled to the stinging salt hell  
To the place where he hurts and hes scared  
And theres no one to tell  
And no one who doesnt listen  
  
You can take all the boys and the girls in the world  
And Ill trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud  
Ive seen too much of life  
So the sea is my wife and a sweet Ocean Cloud is a mistress Im allowed  
For now  
  
You can take all the boys and the girls in the world  
I wouldnt trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud  
Ive seen too much of life  
So the sea is my wife and a sweet ocean cloud is a mistress Im allowed  
For now  
  
Only me and the sea  
We will do as we please  
  
He remembers the day he was marched to the front  
By the physical knuckle head teacher of games  
Look lads he declared This boys a cream puff  
No guts and no muscles  
No spine and no stuffing  
The whole schoolroom sniggered  
And silently thanked God it wasnt them  
  
But time is revenge All the bullies grow weak  
And must live with faithless women who despise them  
Ill be in Barbados in a couple of weeks  
With a rum on the table and yarns by the yard  
A story to tell and a story to save  
unless she changes her mind  
Ill trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud  
Ive seen to much of life so the sea is my wife  
And the sweet ocean clouds will look down on my boat tonight  
  
The wind changed  
I felt it run beneath my ear  
Like silk drawn across my neck  
A dream of your legs  
Defying gravity in love  
  
The medium wave  
Brought signals here from far away  
Your tender voice riding on the sea spray  
Something in the air  
For those who know the signs  
Something in the air  
A storm  
  
When I was alive  
When I was alive  
Dont wanna remember  
When I was alive  
  
Watch me watch me  
Paint this picture  
Stretchin Hurtin Cursin  
Watch me  
Takin it Takin it Takin it Takin it  
Watch me Watch me God above  
  
Between two planets  
In between the points of light  
Between two distant shorelines  
Here am I  
  
Between two planets  
In the black daylight of space  
Between two heavenly bodies  
The invisible man  
Ripping out the radio  
I want to be alone  
  
You can take all the boys and the girls in the world  
I wouldnt trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud  
Ive seen too much of life  
So the sea is my wife and a sweet Ocean Cloud is a mistress Im allowed  
Ive seen too much of life  
So the sea is my wife  
And the sweet ocean clouds will look down on my bones tonight
