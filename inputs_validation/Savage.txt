Im a night rider burning the highways no brakes I ride  
Tasmanian Devil a mean streak as wide as the sky  
As wild as the night  
Cause Im a wild screaming eagle  
I thunder and roll down the line  
  
No one can see that I got to be free  
All that I needs just to ride in the breeze  
Im running today Im still bound to stay  
Dont tread on me cause Im living to be  
Ssssssavage  
  
Im a fur stroking monster Ill eat you alive  
My heart is my smoking sportster cross me and youll not survive  
My wheels are my life  
  
No one can see that I got to be free  
All that I needs just to ride in the breeze  
Im running today Im still bound to stay  
Dont tread on me cause Im living to be  
Ssssssavage  
Dont dare touch me  
Five hundred seeseeseeseeseesees  
  
No one can see that I got to be free  
All that I needs just to ride in the breeze  
Im running today Im still bound to stay  
Dont tread on me cause Im destined to be  
Savage  
To be free ride in the breeze  
No dont you touch me  
Im running today Im still bound to stay
