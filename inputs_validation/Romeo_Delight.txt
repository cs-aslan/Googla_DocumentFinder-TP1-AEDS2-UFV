I told her never in hell no special reason  
Must a lied cause I aint leavin  
Were in for a very long night  
Heard a vicious rumor from your mamas tongue  
You a desprate woman need a man with a gun  
High crime zone in the city of lights  
Baby please  
Cant take it anymore  
Baby please  
Cant take it anymore  
Im takin whiskey to the party tonight  
And Im lookin for somebody to squeeze  
I aint lookin for somebody to fight  
Baby dont get uptight  
Baby please  
Want to see my ID Try to clip my wings  
Dont have to show you proof of anything  
I know the law friend  
At the leventh hour Im goin back outside  
Give it a try  
Im your last loose end  
Baby please  
Cant take it anymore  
Baby please  
Cant take it anymore  
Im takin whiskey to the party tonight  
And Im lookin for somebody to squeeze  
I aint lookin for somebody to fight  
Baby dont get uptight  
Baby please  
I feel my heart beat  
Feel my heart beat  
Feel my heart beat  
Oh yeah  
Baby please  
Cant take it anymore  
Baby please  
Cant take it anymore  
Im takin whiskey to the party tonight  
And Im lookin for somebody to squeeze  
I aint lookin for somebody to fight  
Baby dont get uptight  
Baby please
