Hell fly his astral plane  
Takes you trips around the bay  
Brings you back the same day

Along the coast youll hear them boast  
About a light they say that shines so clear  
So raise your glass well drink a toast  
To the little man who sells you thrills along the pier  
  
Hell take you up hell bring you down  
Hell plant your feet back firmly on the ground  
He flies so high he swoops so low  
He knows exactly which way hes gonna go  
Timothy Leary Timothy Leary  
  
Hell take you up hell bring you down  
Hell plant your feet back on the ground  
Hell fly so high hell swoop so low  
Timothy Leary  
  
Hell fly his astral plane  
Hell take you trips around the bay  
Hell bring you back the same day  
Timothy Leary Timothy Leary
