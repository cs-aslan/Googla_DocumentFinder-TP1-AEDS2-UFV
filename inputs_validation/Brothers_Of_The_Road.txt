Silent shadows of the night  
Faded with the morning light  
We just wrote another song  
Maybe a word or two is wrong  
Theres so much that could be said  
Its hard to write it in a line  
But when the final word is read  
Maybe something could be said  
For all the brothers of the road  
Just like you we bear a heavy load  
Been through hell and back again  
If we dont lose were bound to win  
  
Somehow they gave it all a name  
Just like a southern hurricane  
We play our music like a storm  
They say a brand new sound was born  
Were all brothers of the road  
Just like you we bear a heavy load  
Been through hell and back again  
If we dont lose were bound to win  
  
Some of us fell along the way  
We came together not too proud to pray  
But the music must go on  
So theres no one left out there all alone  
Were just brothers of the road  
Casting shadows in the night  
Big wheels rolling on and on  
But everythings gonna be all right
