When I wonder where I am  
When I wonder why I take these chances  
I try to breathe  
I say to me believe  
And whatever comes its okay  
  
Cause Im on my way  
To somewhere better  
Im further every day  
Im on my way  
I know it might take until forever  
But everything could change today  
So Im on my way  
To find that place  
  
People say that Im naive  
Cause Im trusting and my heart is open  
But I wont hide  
Im here to find who I am  
And whatever comes is whats right  
  
Cause Im on my way  
To somewhere better  
Im further every day  
Im on my way  
I know it might take until forever  
But everything could change today  
So Im on my way  
To find that place  
  
Ill keep dreamin  
Til I get there  
Ill be free  
So goodbye to yesterday  
Im giving what it takes  
  
Cause Im on my way  
To somewhere better  
Im on my way  
It could take forever  
And everything could change  
It could change today  
Cause Im on my way  
To find that place
