You could shake the stars out of the sky  
Doesnt matter our faiths will collide  
You can pull the plug out  
Watch all the water strain  
Still I know it would be the same  
Still I know it would be the same  
  
I see it in my minds eye  
A world made just for you and I  
So I know its worth the wait  
  
Chorus  
Oh once is enough thats how I feel  
We do this once and for real  
Love is strong enough  
So heres the deal  
We do this once and for real  
  
Im building my life to include you  
So for now I have someone to look for ado  
Im in no hurry no worries youre out there somewhere  
Still I hope you will be here soon  
Still I hope you will be here soon  
  
I see it in my minds eye  
A world made just for you and I  
So I know its worth the wait  
  
Chorus  
  
Im waiting for something  
Im waiting for someone  
Im waiting for you  
  
Chorus
