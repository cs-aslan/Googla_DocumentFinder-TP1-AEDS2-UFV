The emotion it was electric  
And the stars they all aligned  
I knew I had to make my decision  
But I never made the time  
No I never made the time  
  
Chorus  
In the dark for a while now  
I cant stay so far  
I cant stay much longer  
Riding my decision home  
  
Exoneration lost his eraser  
But my forgiver found the sun  
And there are twisted days that I take comfort  
Cause Im not the only one  
No Im not the only one  
  
Chorus  
  
There is a majesty at my doorstep  
There is a little boy in her arms  
Now well parade around without game plans  
Obligations or alarm  
  
Chorus x2  
  
In the dark
