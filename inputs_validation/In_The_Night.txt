Verse 1  
All alone she was living  
In a world without an end or beginning  
Babygirl was living life for the feeling  
But I dont mind I dont mind  
And all the wrongs she committed  
She was numb and she was so codependent  
She was young and all she had was the city  
But I dont mind I dont mind  
  
Bridge  
And I know that shes capable of anything its riveting  
But when you wake up shes always gone gone gone  
  
Hook  
In the night she hears him calling  
In the night shes dancing to relieve the pain  
Shell never walk away I dont think you understand  
In the night when she comes crawling  
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face  
Shell never walk away I dont think you understand  
  
Verse 2  
He sang a song when he did it  
He was cold and he was so unforgiving  
Now she dances to the song on the minute  
Yeah all the time all the time  
It make her weak when she hear it  
And it got her on her knees like religion  
She was young and she was forced to be a woman  
Yeah all the time all the time  
  
Bridge  
And I know that shes capable of anything its riveting  
But when you wake up shes always gone gone gone  
  
Hook  
In the night she hears him calling  
In the night shes dancing to relieve the pain  
Shell never walk away I dont think you understand  
In the night when she comes crawling  
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face  
Shell never walk away I dont think you understand  
  
I dont think you understand  
  
Hook  
In the night she hears him calling  
In the night shes dancing to relieve the pain  
Shell never walk away I dont think you understand  
In the night when she comes crawling  
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face  
Shell never walk away I dont think you understand
