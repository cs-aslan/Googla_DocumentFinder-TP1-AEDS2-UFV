Wannabe yeah you  
Youre just a wannabe  
Do you want to be like me  
  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
  
Feels like a hole inside  
Cant breathe my lungs have dried  
My hearts a bomb  
Ready to go off  
  
A wannabe thats you  
A fucking wannabe  
Why do you want to be like me  
  
You hate yourself  
But rate yourself  
As a number one  
  
You hate yourself  
But rate yourself  
As a number one  
  
Feels like a hole inside  
Cant breathe my lungs have dried  
My hearts a bomb  
Ready to explode  
  
Brings out the prick in me  
Dont think its purity  
I stick in you  
Try to tell yourself  
It aint true  
  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
  
You hate yourself but rate yourself  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
  
You hate yourself but rate yourself  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb  
Dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb
