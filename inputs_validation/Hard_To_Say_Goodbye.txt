Time has been short since you left me  
So I cant help but think  
Of how things between us used to be  
You were a piece of my heart  
And I thought we were swell  
Until you told me you were leaving  
To find a better life for yourself  
Oh I  
  
I wish we were together again  
Loving the way we used to love  
Boy I miss you much  
I wish we were together again  
Oh how Im missing you  
Its so hard for me to say goodbye  
  
You know that I love you  
And for you there aint nothing in this world  
That I wont do  
If you would only come back to me  
And let me show you how loving me could be  
  
I Ive got feelings  
But you act like you dont care  
You treat me so unfair  
  
Love has no meaning  
Since you walked right out my life  
Youve touched a part of me  
Cant you see that Im in need of you  
  
I wish we were together again  
Loving the way we used to love  
Boy I miss you much  
I wish we were together again  
Oh how Im missing you  
Its so hard for me to say goodbye  
  
I wish we were together again  
Loving the way we used to love  
Boy I miss you much  
I wish we were together again  
Oh how Im missing you  
Its so hard for me to say goodbye
