Now I find peace of mind  
Finally found a way of thinking  
Tried the rest found the best  
Stormy day wont see me sinking  
  
Chorus  
I cant conceal it like I know I did before  
I got to tell you now the ship is ready  
Waiting on the shore  
  
Dare to look face the test on the eve  
When you set sailing  
What youve learned what youve earned  
Ship of joy will stop you failing  
  
Chorus  
  
Wind is high so am I  
As the shore sinks in the distance  
Dreams unfold seek the gold  
Gold thats brighter than the sunlight  
Sail away see the day  
Dawning on a new horizon  
Golds insight shining bright  
Brighter than the sun thats rising  
  
Three thousand sails on high are straining in the wind  
A raging sea below is this voyage coming to an end
