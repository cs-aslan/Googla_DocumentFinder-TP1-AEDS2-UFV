A young couple stood under stars in the sky  
They pledged their love with tears in their eyes  
For this was a true love goodbye  
They stood there trembling and couldnt speak  
She tip toed and kissed his cheek  
For this was a true love goodbye  
A true love goodbye they tried not to cry  
With words so true they both said I love you  
Then they parted both broken hearted  
But theyll meet again some day some way  
Beyond this true love goodbye  
A true love goodbye they tried not to cry  
With words so true they both said I love you  
Then they parted both broken hearted  
But theyll meet again some day some way  
Beyond this true love goodbye  
True love true love goodbye bye my love
