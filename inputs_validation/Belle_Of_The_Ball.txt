A vagabond dreamer a rhymer and singer of songs  
Singing to no one and nowhere to really belong  
I met a beautiful lady a pure Southern belle of the ball  
Like Scarlet OHara loved no one and wanted them all  
  
Chorus  
Ill never forget you and love you inspite of your faults  
The good and the bad I want to remember it all  
I did a new dance and you did your Tennessee Waltz  
The partys all over I came uninvited  
Im leaving and taking the belle of the ball  
  
There will always be someone I guess thats the way it should be  
I guess I should know that someone used to be me  
Theyll gather around her soon theyll all look the same  
At the feet of the lady are lovers without any names  
  
Chorus
