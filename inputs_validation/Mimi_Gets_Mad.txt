Ill never grow up I wont try  
I can live with that dont ask why  
I am resigned that this is me  
If I can take it why cant she  
  
I am bad at my best but she will not accept that  
I cant get away with things I might regret  
She makes me get started when nothings ever through  
And I do the best that I can do but  
  
Mimi gets mad when I make her wait  
Mimi gets mad when I phone too late  
But then Mimi gets sad if I hurt myself  
Cant say that about nobody else  
  
Someone should tell her honestly  
She is a fool to count on me  
I swore there would be no delay  
I should have been here yesterday  
  
So I sneak in the door and there she is again  
She could squeeze off a shot just as soon as look at me  
She dont say a word and every word is true  
And if thats the best that I can do then  
  
Mimi gets mad every time Im wrong  
Mimi gets mad when I sleep too long  
But then Mimi gets glad when I do my share  
See no smile but I know its there  
  
There must be a dozen other boys  
She could give her anger to  
Im the only one it doesnt matter what I do  
Its not very pretty but its absolutely true  
That Im still the best that she can do so  
  
Mimi gets mad
