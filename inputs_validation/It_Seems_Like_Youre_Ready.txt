Temperatures rising  
And Your bodys yearnin for me  
Girl lay it on me  
I place no one above thee  
Oh take me to your ecstasy  
  
It seems like youre ready seems like youre ready  
Girl are you ready  
To go all the way  
It seems like youre ready seems like youre ready  
Girl are you ready  
To go all the way  
  
I can smell your perfume  
Step into my bedroom  
Let me love you constantly  
Ohoh your body is my playground  
Let me lick you up and down  
Make you feel like a woman should  
  
It seems like youre ready seems like youre ready  
Girl are you ready  
To go all the way  
It seems like youre ready seems like youre ready  
Girl are you ready  
To go all the way
