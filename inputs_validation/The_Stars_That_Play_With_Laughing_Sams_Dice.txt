The stars up above that play with laughing Sams dice  
They make us feel the world was made for us  
The zodiac glass that beams come through the skies  
It will happen soon for you  
  
And a way we go  
Yeah  
Thank you very much  
Thank you very much  
And now we would like to bring to you our wide lonely friendly neighborhood  
Experience me  
Right now listen  
The milky way express is loaded all aboard  
I promise each and every one of you you wont be bored  
What Im really concerned about  
Is my grandnew pair of butterfly roller skates  
Thank you thank you  
  
No throwing cigarette butts out the window  
No throwing cigarette butts out the window  
Now if you look to your right youll see Saturn  
If you look to the left youll see mars  
I hope your brought your parachutes with you  
Hey look out  
Look out for that door  
Dont open that door  
Dont open that door  
Oh well  
Thats the way it goes  
Hey everything is all right now
