Do I dare show him lovin  
Do I go for double or nothin  
Do I act like I dont care  
Or do I dare  
  
Do I do what my hearts sayin  
Do I hide my love awaitin  
Make believe that hes not there  
Or do I dare  
  
This girls got a problem  
She dont know what to do  
If theres some way of tellin  
When a man is true  
  
Will he love me faithfully  
Will he leave me blue  
Should I run  
Or could this be the one  
  
Do I dare jump in the middle  
Sure I care more than a little  
If he dont fall Ill loose it all  
Tell me do I dare  
  
Do I dare  
Do I dare  
  
Do I tell him that Ive held him  
In my dreams so tight  
Well could I risk one little kiss  
Or should I take a chance tonight  
  
Do I do what my hearts sayin  
Do I hide my love awaitin  
Make believe that hes not there  
Or do I dare  
  
Lord do I dare  
Lord do I dare
