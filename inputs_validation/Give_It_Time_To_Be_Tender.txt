I feel the hunger you feel in your touch  
Burnin my body and soul  
And its freightnin just wantin somebody so much  
So close to losin control  
But darlin dont make me surrender too soon  
Im so afraid of the fall  
Please give it time to be tender  
And pretend that it wont hurt at all  
Slowly be gentle  
Each step of the way  
Ive never been loved before  
Let me believe  
You wont turn away  
After Ive opened the door  
But darlin dont make me surrender too soon  
Im so afraid of the fall  
Please give it time to be tender  
And pretend it wont hurt at all  
Please give it time to be tender  
And pretend it wont hurt at all
