Fare the well my brother please dont stand in my way  
Im going down to that dirty town  
No matter what you say  
You fooled me and you ruled me and you played in every part  
I gotta go its no use me stayin home  
  
Goodbye my sister please dont let me see you cry  
Gonna be a star some day no matter what they say  
And when you hear the crowds all callin and shouting out my name  
Until then my little friend Ill be unsatisfied  
  
So long sweet Melinda dont forget that youre my girl  
Gonna dress you fine and if you give me time  
Make you proud like I said I would  
And if the Champs Elysees no fallacy if I find the world looks like it
should  
Candy cars movie stars street bars then I could stay a while  
  
Well I love you  
Shall I write or phone from Paris or Rome  
And Ill miss you all  
Even tho youre tryin to hold me back  
  
Farewell all my family dont you know I mean you so well  
Please appreciate I must make a break  
Just to see what I can do  
The stage is set so understand I cant hide in the wings no more  
Ive got to go now its no use me staying home  
  
All I can say is I love you  
Shall I write or phone from Paris or Rome  
And I think Im always gonna miss you  
And I love you always  
I think Im always gonna miss ya  
Even tho youre tryin to hold me back  
  
And I love you and I miss you  
If you dont get no mail you know Im in jail  
If you dont get no mail you know Im in jail  
But I love you and I miss you
