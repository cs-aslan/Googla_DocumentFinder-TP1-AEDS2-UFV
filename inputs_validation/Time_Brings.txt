Hearken to me both high and low  
Ill sing for you a song  
Of Kings and Queens and roselipped maidens  
Courting light foot lads  
  
Now love is grand when love is new  
The heart blood it runs strong  
Theres nothing a doting lad wont do  
To keep his princess warm  
  
Hell tease her with poems and promises  
Hell ask her out to dance  
Hell cajole and hell beg  
And hell always win  
In bittersweet romance  
  
Chorus  
For time it comes and time it goes  
It makes the strongest tree to bend  
Kings and Queens have no defence  
Time brings all things to an end  
  
But he goes out with his drinking pals  
His eyes begin to roam  
He forgets all about the browneyed beauty  
Who now sits home alone  
  
Theres no more walks down lovers lane  
Theres no more wine in the sun  
All thats left is a hollow pain  
Time alas youve won  
  
Chorus  
  
Now all who wish for love to stay  
And last your whole life through  
Keep ahead of time me boys  
And never be untrue  
  
Chorus
