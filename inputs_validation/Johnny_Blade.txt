Tortured and twisted he walks the streets alone  
People avoid him they know the streets his own  
Cold blade of silver his eyes they burn so wild  
Mean as a tiger societys own child  
  
Those who try to burn him pay  
You dont do that to Johnny Blade  
Hes the meanest guy around his town  
One look and he will cut you down  
Johnny Blade Johnny Blade  
  
Life has no meaning and Deaths his only friend  
Will fate surprise him where will he meet his end  
He feels so bitter yes hes so full of hate  
To die in the gutter I guess thats Johnnys fate  
  
Rivals all across the land  
He kills them with his knife in hand  
Hes the meanest guy around his town  
One look and he will cut you down  
Johnny Blade Johnny Blade  
Johnny Blade Johnny Blade  
  
Well you know that Johnnys a spider  
And his web is the city at night  
Hes a victim of modern frustration  
Thats the reason hes so ready to fight  
  
Hes the one that should be afraid  
What will happen to you Johnny Blade  
  
Oh he knows his futures decided  
And he aint gonna change it no way  
He was born to die in the gutter  
Hell keep fighting till the end of his days  
  
Been alone all through his life  
His only friend is a switchblade knife  
Hes the one who should be afraid  
What will happen to you Johnny Blade  
  
You fool the people  
Whos fooling who  
Its time to listen  
The fool is you
