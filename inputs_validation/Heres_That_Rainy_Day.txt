Maybe  
I should have saved  
Those leftover dreams  
Funny  
But heres that rainy day  
  
Heres that rainy day  
They told me about  
And I laughed at the thought  
That it might turn out this way  
  
Where is that worn out wish  
That I threw aside  
After it brought my love so near  
  
Funny how love becomes  
A cold rainy day  
Funny  
That rainy day is here  
  
Its funny  
How love becomes  
A cold rainy day  
  
Funny  
That rainy day is here
