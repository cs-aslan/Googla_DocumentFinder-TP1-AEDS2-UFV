Peekaboo  
I can see you  
And I know what you do  
So put your hands on your face  
And cover up your eyes  
Dont look until I signal  
Peekaboo peekaboo peekaboo  
The way that we werent is what well become  
So please pay attention while I show you some  
Of whats about to happen  
Peekaboo  
I know what you do  
Cause I do it too  
Laugh if you want to or say you dont care  
If you cannot see it you think its not there  
It doesnt work that way
