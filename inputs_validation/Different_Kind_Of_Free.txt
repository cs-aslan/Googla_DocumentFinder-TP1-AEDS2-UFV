Broken hearts broken homes  
Theres a war deep in motion  
Fighting hard to find  
Some kind of peace of mind  
  
Breathing in breathing out  
Missing life living doubt  
Searching for a cure  
Some kind of open door  
  
Bring it back to the beginning  
To the first taste of shame  
A fallen world in waiting  
Only one could take the blame  
  
Fast forward to the ending  
One truth remains  
Theres a miracle waiting  
For all who speak His name  
  
Take my life my liberty  
Its all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
Oh I have found eternity  
Its a different kind of free  
  
And they cant take it from me  
Pleading the most worthy cause  
For the innocence we lost  
With his tears of blood  
  
He started freedoms flood  
As the worlds opinions sway  
My beliefs will not be changed  
Nothing ever can take me from His hand  
  
Bring it back to the beginning  
To the first taste of shame  
A fallen world in waiting  
Only one could take the blame  
  
Fast forward to the ending  
One truth remains  
Theres a miracle waiting  
For all who speak His name  
  
Take my life my liberty  
Its all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
Oh I have found eternity  
Its a different kind of free  
  
And they cant take it from me  
Yeah sure I remember  
Matter fact it was just last September  
She still calls it the fall to remember  
  
Little Heather when it all came together  
Said you remember the first time you met us  
She cried when it rained and blamed the weather  
But inside she strained with suicide letters  
  
The kind of cold you couldnt warm with a sweater  
Hardly lasted past December  
Said she was headed down to defeat  
Thats the last youd seen and never had dreamed  
  
Thats the same little Heather Its who you saw last week  
In an instant you couldnt have missed her gleam  
As she listened She looked like a distant queen  
With a difference there for all to see  
  
She found a different a different kind of free  
Take my life my liberty  
Its all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
Oh I have found eternity  
  
Its a different kind of free  
And they cant take it from me  
Take my life my liberty  
Its all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
  
Oh I have found eternity  
Its a different kind of free  
And they cant take it from me  
Take my life my liberty  
  
Its all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
Oh I have found eternity  
Its a different kind of free  
And they cant take it from me  
  
Its so much different  
Its a different kind of free  
And its here for you and me  
Its a different kind of free  
  
And its here to set you free  
Its a different kind of free
