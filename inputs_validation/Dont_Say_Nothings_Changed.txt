Dont say nothings changed with you  
I can hear it in your sighs  
The way that you cant look me in the eyes  
Its spelling out bad news  
So dont say its the same we two  
No I cant say Im surprised  
cause I could see it in your eyes  
And no you dont have to lie  
Baby you dont have to lie  
Why cant it be like yesterday  
The feelings gone  
But I just want to say that I love you know  
And Im holding on for you  
Is that a silly thing to do  
So dont say nothings changed with you  
Now were running out of time  
And Ive got to give up something that was mine  
Oh baby doesnt it seem cruel  
So dont say its the same we two  
cause were already worlds apart  
And now the lonliness will start  
Oh boy youre breaking my heart  
Baby youre breaking my heart  
So dont say nothings changed with you
