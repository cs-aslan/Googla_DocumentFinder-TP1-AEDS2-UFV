Love takes time we all agree  
And times not the easist to cheat  
The water changes one degree  
When will the shiver of this river turn to sea   
The river does no good no harm  
Tempts us like pirates to its charm  
Goddamn this river and its shiver and its charm  
  
If youve got loves A to Z  
Dont go dredging river bed  
Use your fins and use your head  
This rivers hooked the floating dead  
  
Our lives go bounding down the stream  
When will we realise minnow dreams  
The frustration eating you and me  
Our only wish to be the fish that meets the sea  
We cannot tell a he or she  
But us fish can tell a we  
We know the seed we know the tree  
When will my conker conquer thee  
  
If youve got loves A to Z  
Dont go dredging river bed  
Use your fins and use your head  
This rivers hooked the floating dead  
The cheaper woman and myself  
Weve both got ladders in our tights  
When youve been left on the top shelf  
Youve got those ladders in your sights
