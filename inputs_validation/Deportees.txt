The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting  
The oranges are piled in their cresote dumps  
Theyre flying you back to the Mexico border  
To pay all your money to wade back again  
  
My fathers own father he wanted that river  
They took all the money he made in his life  
My brothers and sisters come working the fruit trees  
And they rode the truck till they took down and died  
  
Goodbye to my Juan goodbye Rosalita  
Adios mis amigos Jesus why Maris  
You wont have a name when you ride the big airplane  
And all they will call you will be deportees  
  
Some of us are illega and others not wanted  
Our work contracts out and we have to move on  
But its six hundred miles to that Mexican border  
They chase us like outlaws like rustlers like theives  
  
We died in your hills we died in your deserts  
We died in your valleys and died on your plains  
We died neath your trees and we died in your bushes  
Both sides of the river we died just the same  
  
Goodbye to my Juan goodbye Rosalita  
Adios mis amigos Jesus why Maris  
You wont have a name when you ride the big airplane  
And all they will call you will be deportees  
  
A sky plane caught fire over Los Gatos canyon  
Like a fireball of lightning it shook all our hills  
Who are all these friends all scattered like dry leaves  
The radio says they are just deportees  
  
Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards  
Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit  
To fall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil  
And be called by no name except deportees
