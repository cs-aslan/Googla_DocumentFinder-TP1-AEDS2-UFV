Whitey WhiteyIts my love  
Punk rock to ska disco to blues  
Yo my blue seude shoes got stepped on  
Slept on the style that I hustle  
You want to flex then punk make a muscle  
Im Whitey WhiteyYeah thats right  
Some of yall kiddies want to act uptight  
Comin to the party tryin to spark up fights  
Im puttin out lights boy cause Im  
Whitey Whitey Whitey Whitey  
Im whiter than crack Im harder than drugs  
Im smarter than thugs Im hotter than slugs  
Im faster than sound I came to get down boy dont fuck around  
Youll catch a beat down its comin from  
Whitey Whitey Whitey Whitey  
What you thought I stopped rhymin cause I started signin  
Pickin on a sixstring wrist bling blingin  
Names bell ringin from coast to coast  
Youre rollin with the one that rocks the most  
Im Whitey Whitey Whitey  
Official like referees fuck with me put your egos in jeapordy  
Threats to the right amigos to the left of me  
Part of mes hellish part of mes heavenly  
Whitey Whitey Whitey Boy thats my name  
I dont do it for the wealth I dont do it for the fame  
I do it for the health and I do it for the spirit  
Dont speak the lyric if you cant hear it  
Whitey Whitey Whitey  
If it aint from the heart than it cant be art  
If you aint got proof than it cant be truth  
If it aint got legs than it can not run  
If it aint never started than it cant be done  
Im Whitey Whitey Whitey Whitey Whitey
