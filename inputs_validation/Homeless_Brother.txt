I was walking by the graveyard late last Friday night  
I heard somebody yelling it sounded like a fight  
It was just a drunken hobo dancing circles in the night  
Pouring whiskey on the headstones in the blue moonlight  
So often have I wondered where these homeless brothers go  
Down in some hidden valley were their sorrows cannot show  
Where the police cannot find them where the wanted men can go  
Theres freedom when your walking even though youre walking slow  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can  
That homeless brother is my friend  
  
Its hard to be a pack rat its hard to be a bo  
But livings so much harder where the heartless people go  
Somewhere the dogs are barking and the children seem to know  
That Jesus on the highway was a lost hobo  
And they hear the holy silence of the temples in the hill  
And they see the ragged tatters as another kind of thrill  
And they envy him the sunshine and they pity him the chill  
And theyre sad to do their living for some other kind of thrill  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can  
That homeless brother is my friend  
  
Somewhere there was a woman somewhere there was a child  
Somewhere there was a cottage where the marigolds grew wild  
But some wheres just like nowhere when you leave it for a while  
Youll find the brokenhearted when youre travelling junglestyle  
Down the bowels of a broken land where numbers live like men  
Where those who keep their senses have them taken back again  
Where the night stick cracks with crazy rage where madmen dont  
Pretend  
Where wealth has no beginning and poverty no end  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can  
That homeless brothe
