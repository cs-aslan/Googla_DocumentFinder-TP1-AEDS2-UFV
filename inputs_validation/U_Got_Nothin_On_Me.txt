Summer came and took me by surprise  
California sunshine in my eyes  
Driving with the top down  
We sing along  
To our favorite song  
Nothing could go wrong  
  
Laughing as we gazed under the moon  
You kissed me and it never felt too soon  
Hard to believe that anything  
Could tear us apart  
I wont let you break my heart  
  
Chorus  
Now I know who you are  
You got nothin on me  
I see I should have known it from the start  
You cant tell me lies dont even try  
Cause this is goodbye  
  
Goodbye  
  
Caught you from the corner of my eye  
You smiled at a girl while passing by  
Thought you had me fooled but you were wrong  
I know whats going on  
And it didnt take me long  
  
It wasnt hard to read between the lines  
The necklace in your car that wasnt mine  
Nothing left for you to do or say  
Now Im on my way  
Now its too late  
  
Chorus  
  
Say goodbye to broken promises  
Time to face your carelessness  
Dont bore me with apologies  
And come crawling back on your knees  
  
You got nothin on me  
You got nothin on me  
You got nothin on me  
  
I know who you are  
Now I see I should have known it from the start  
  
You cant tell me lies dont even try  
Cause this is goodbye  
  
Chorus  
  
Goodbye
