Yeah yanahmean  
Just something for all my niggas in the hood  
They always ask me what I got to say to the youths and  
Yanahmean when I do these interviews  
Just want to let em know we ballin  
You gotta strap up cause niggasll test you  
Whenever you feel that pressure  
You let em know everyday of your life is check it  
  
For real we still killin em and each one of em  
You know the flow like caine look its numbin em  
Look what I done to them they want run wit em  
I let em stay few nights but then Im done wit em  
Mami you rollin get your clothin  
You know one sight of the mansion will get em open  
I back out my garage wit new Ferrari  
Cause I been pimpin this game since Atari  
You hardly ever see me loving a hoe  
I tell a bitch Im in love wit my doe  
Cause Im pimping and niggas is bitchin and  
We was the pharmacy now you want prescriptions  
Think Im slippin like I dont grip again  
Go head trip it aint nothing to drop a clip again  
Got my dogs to catch me when Im fallin  
Pass the weed and hennessy I hear it callin  
  
Chorus x2  
Nigga we ballin ready for war and  
Pass the weed and hennessy I hear it callin  
We ballin ready for war and  
Pass the weed and hennessy I hear it callin  
  
Yeah I take a sip of that henny I load that tec up  
I hit the block wit the medicine give em check ups  
You see Im vest up Im ballin at war  
These niggas want to see me off they dont want to see me on but  
Proof Im ballin I put a eighth  
Of that white down in my hood I can finish it by the mornin  
Reup by noon rekick at night  
Half these dudes doing bids couldnt live my life  
And you youngns in the hood want to be like P  
Cause every new gat I cop it begin wit a P  
Like P89 you niggas P92 shit  
You know how dudes This Proof aint for that bullshit  
And these hoes want to roll wit a G  
But once I hit em wit that G I have totin the P cause  
  
Chorus  
  
Yo I hear em callin and every city I travel  
Hoes get at em when they see a nigga ballin  
Keep the steel wit me couple of killas from the hood  
Who blew bail but still they keep it real wit me  
We ride out and we find out where  
Your little address and blow out your hideout yeah  
Who want war hoes they tellin me Es you aint right  
Like this year Im goin go South Pole  
This for them haters think Im slippin I aint  
When I find em hiding I tie em they be missin like weight  
But wait lil nigga dont be missin my point  
I dont miss when I point niggas get killed off point  
And you see I school a little you forfeit the game  
I was young just like em Jay taught me the same  
But I see he hard headed told em stay in his lane  
Cause them OGs home and they layin wit Ks cause  
  
Chorus
