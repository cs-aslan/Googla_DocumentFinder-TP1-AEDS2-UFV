This is it  
Here I stand  
In the light of the world  
Love is grand  
And this love  
I can feel  
And I know  
Yes for sure  
It is real  
  
And it seems as though  
Ive seen your face a thousand times  
And you know  
That youve seen my face before  
And you said that you dont want me  
To come around  
But many times  
Im gonna do it to this love  
  
Ooh yeah  
I never heard a single word about you  
Falling in love wasnt my plan  
I never thought that I would be your lover  
Come on please baby  
Im trustin  
  
This is it  
Here I stand  
With you Ive got the world in my hands  
And this love  
That I feel  
Yes I know  
Thats for sure  
This is real  
  
In my dreams Ive seen your face a thousand times  
But I know  
Never felt this way before  
I look at you  
And I cant believe the love I found  
And I know  
That I can never want for more  
  
I never heard a single word about you  
Falling in love wasnt my plan  
I never thought that I would be your lover  
Come on baby  
Im trustin  
  
This is it  
This is it  
Here I am  
Here I am  
Im in love  
And Im at your command  
Your command  
This love  
That I feel  
That I feel  
Never thought it could feel so real  
  
I can feel you turn the key  
That free my broken heart  
Now Im not afraid to love  
Against some odds  
And youre everything I know  
That I can want and more  
But I really didnt know it until now  
No no  
  
I never heard a single word about you  
Falling in love wasnt my plan  
I never thought that I would be your lover  
Come on baby  
Im trustin  
  
Oh yeah  
I never heard a single  
Word about you  
Falling in love wasnt my plan  
I never thought that I could be your lover  
Come on my baby  
Im trustin  
  
Oh yeah  
I never heard a single  
Word about you  
Oh no  
Come on my baby
