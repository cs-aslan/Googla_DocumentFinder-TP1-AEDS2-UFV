Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo 3x  
  
We had the best years of our lives  
But you and I would never be the same  
September took me by surprise  
And I was left to watch the seasons change  
  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo 3x  
  
Its been so quiet since youre gone  
And everyday feels more like a year  
Sometimes I wish I could move on  
The memories would all just disappear  
  
So many things I shouldve  
Said when I had the chance  
So many times we took it all for granted  
  
CHORUS  
Id never thought this could ever end  
Id never thought Id lose my best friend  
Everything is different now  
Can we stop the world from turning  
  
Id never thought Id have to let you go  
Id Never thought Id ever feel this low  
I Wish I could go back  
And wed stop the world from turning  
  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo 2x  
  
Looking back on better days  
When we were young we thought we knew so much  
And now it seems so far away  
Im wondering If I was good enough  
  
So many things I shouldve  
Said when I had the chance  
So many times we took it all for granted  
  
CHORUS  
Id never thought we would ever end  
Id never thought Id lose my best friend  
Everything is different now  
Can we stop the world from turning  
  
Id never thought Id have to let you go  
Id Never thought Id ever feel this low  
I Wish I could go back  
And wed stop the world from turning  
  
Gone are all the days  
When we swore wed never break  
And now Im left here alone  
  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo 3x  
Oh oh ooo  
  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo  
Id never thought this would ever end  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo  
Id never thought Id lose my best friend  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo  
Everything is different now  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo  
Can we stop the world from turning  
  
CHORUS  
Id never thought this could ever end  
Id never thought Id lose my best friend  
Everything is different now  
Can we stop the world from turning  
  
Id never thought Id have to let you go  
Id Never thought Id ever feel this low  
I Wish I could go back  
And wed stop the world from turning  
  
Oh oh oo Oh Oh oo 2x  
Oh oh oo ooo
