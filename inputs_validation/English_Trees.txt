English trees in my garden  
We planted seeds in a faraway land  
In between the palms and the succulent grove  
  
They lose their leaves in the winter  
Mark the seasons for him and for her  
Once upon a time in the fallen snow  
Up against the sky made a silhouette show  
  
England cries and she plays for him  
The chords entwined like a requiem  
Although its springtime and color is new  
In Regents Park I will mourn for you  
  
And I must be wise somehow  
Cause my hearts been broken down  
  
Its so far to fall  
And so hard to climb  
Nothings sadder I know  
Than the passing of time  
  
Wont forget me  
You wont forget me  
  
English trees in my garden  
Summers missed you my darling  
Yet all your crimes are forgiven  
Yet all your crimes are forgiven  
And I must be wise somehow  
  
And England cries oh  
Theres English trees in my garden
