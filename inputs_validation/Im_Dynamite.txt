I know you see that dont touch sun all over me  
My pain is wet and youll get hurt all over you  
Im another mans woman to you Im just bad news  
Im dynamite so please dont light the fuse  
You turn me on but I cant turn me off I guess the switch is burried in my
mind  
The flame of love is burning just begging to be used  
Im dynamite so please dont light the fuse  
You cannot do the damage that Ill do and the first thing Ill destroy it will
be you  
Too many other hearts and vows that I cant stand to lose  
Im dynamite so please dont light the fuse  
 dobro   
You cannot do the damage  
Im dynamite so please dont light the fuse
