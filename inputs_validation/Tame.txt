Disguise this morning  
Airplane passes  
At the slight angle  
Second one follows  
Reaching no evidence  
Continues to baffle her  
But shes not stupid  
Shes just friendly  
I dont know what to do  
Today is up to you  
Can I pass through you  
Tame tame tame tame  
Applause in background  
Their coffee mornings  
They show Bonanzas and  
What to buy there  
So taste of horrors in  
Oh well citys hot  
You fall to pieces when  
I must be dreaming  
I dont know what to do  
Today is up to you  
Can I pass through you  
And I dont know what to do  
My absence is due  
Can I pass can I
