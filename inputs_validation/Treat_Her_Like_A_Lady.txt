Ooh yeah baby  
Whoawhoaohoh  
Mmm  
  
Now Im the kinda guy who dont believe  
That chivalry is dead no  
Cause I believe a woman should be treated  
With the utmost respect mmmhmm  
  
Dont be afraid dont turn and walk away  
I want to get to know ya well  
Dont be ashamed dont say that loves to blame  
Just come and look me over  
  
Youll find a heart  
Youll find a heart that youve always been lookin for  
How could anybody ask for much more woohoo  
  
Now I like openin doors  
Pickin up Yeah her hanky Yeah off the floor  
Treat her like a lady  
Treat her like lady  
Light her cigarette if she smokes  
Even Help her with her coat well  
Treat her like a lady Treat her like lady  
  
In this world of liberation  
Its so easy to forget mmm  
That its so nice to have a man around  
To lend a helping hand you can bet bet you can baby  
  
When I was young my mama used to say Boy  
A womans like a flower with love on her you shower  
Ever since that day her words never went away  
I always will remember to treat my baby tender  
  
Youll find a heart  
Youll find a heart that youve always been lookin for  
How could anybody ask for much more whoaoohooh  
  
Now I like openin doors  
Pickin up Yeah her hanky Yeah off the floor  
Treat her like a lady Treat her like lady  
Light her cigarette if she smokes  
Even Help her with her coat oh whoa  
Treat her like a lady

Compliment her in her hair  
Even help her with her chair  
Treat her like a lady  
Treat her like lady  
Shes a bad son
