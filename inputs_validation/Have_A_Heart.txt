Lying in bed alone  
Thinkin bout how much I need you  
Oh give me one more chance  
To see you again  
  
If only Id have known  
Was the last time Id be with you  
I would have held on  
And never let you go  
  
Baby just have a heart  
Im begging you  
Let me show you  
How much I need you  
  
Baby just have a heart  
This much is true  
I miss your touch  
Im still in love with you  
  
Here comes another day  
I dont know if I can make it  
Oh Ive just realized  
Its so lonely being free  
  
Runnin from the pain  
Im never gonna shake it  
Oh how I need you  
To take it from me baby  
  
Baby just have a heart  
Im beggin you  
Let me show you  
How much I need you  
  
Baby just have a heart  
This much is true  
I miss your touch  
Im still in love with you  
  
I always thought that I would have the  
Upper hand but now I know that Im  
Really not that strong  
If I could only make you understand  
Id give you the world  
But for a start  
  
Baby just have a heart
