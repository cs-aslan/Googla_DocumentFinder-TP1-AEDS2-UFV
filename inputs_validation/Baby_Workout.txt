Hey you Come on here on the floor  
And lets rock some more  
Come on here on the floor  
Honey lets rock some more yeah  
Now when you get out here dont cha have no fear  
Put your hand on your hip  
And let your backbone flip and work out  
Mama mama move up party move back  
Shuffle to the left wobble to the right  
Now its plain to see youre a heading for me  
But its a natural fact huh I like that so work out  
Work it baby work out honey work out  
Work out baby workout baby work out work it baby work  
Shout until its jumped out work it baby work out  
Work out work out work out work out work all night long  
Round and round and round and round we go  
Round and round I know Dont you know dont you know  
Round and round we go where we stop nobody knows  
Yeah The band is swinging on the stand  
Were moving in were moving out  
People stop right now heres a dance with a shout so work out  
Now when I tell you to shout I want you to jump at it
