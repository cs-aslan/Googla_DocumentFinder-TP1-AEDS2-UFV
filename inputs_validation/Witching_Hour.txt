Come hear the moon is calling  
The witching hour draws near  
Come hear the bell is tolling  
Mortals run in fear  
Prepare the altar now and hear the virgin cry  
Hold fast the sacrifice  
For now its the time to die  
All hell breaks loose  
Hells breaking loose  
  
Unveil the pentagram  
And feel the demons lust  
Come watch the holy men  
Who look on in disgust  
Come taste blood  
And feel the heat of Satans breath  
Look in the skys and see  
The warriors of death  
All hell breaks loose  
Hells breaking loose  
Witching hour  
  
Our work is now complete  
The blood runs fast and free  
And Satan takes his bride  
And crys of blasphemy  
All hell rejoices at the child  
That she will bear  
And Satans only son  
Shall be the worlds despair  
All hell breaks loose  
Hells breaking loose  
Witching hour
