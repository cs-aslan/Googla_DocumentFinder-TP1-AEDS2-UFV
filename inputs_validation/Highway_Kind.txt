My days they are the highway kind  
They only come to leave  
But the leavin I dont mind  
Its the comin that I crave  
Pour the sun upon the ground  
Stand to throw a shadow  
Watch it grow into a night  
And fill the spinnin sky  
  
Time among the pine trees  
It felt like breath of air  
Usually I just walk these streets  
And tell myself to care  
Sometimes I believe me  
And sometimes I dont hear  
Sometimes the shape Im in  
Wont let me go  
  
Well I dont know too much for true  
But my heart knows how to pound  
My legs know how to love someone  
My voice knows how to sound  
Shame that its not enough  
Shame that it is a shame  
Follow the circle down  
Where would you be  
  
Youre the only one I want now  
I never heard your name  
Lets hope we meet some day  
If we dont its all the same  
Ill meet the ones between us  
And be thinkin bout you  
And all the places I have seen  
And why you where not there
