Tell me how you feel when youre all alone no one to say  
I love you and you feel all your hope is gone  
Try to call your best friend  
But hes not there so you wind up feeling empty like no one cares  
  
My brother dont you worry storms dont last always  
Theres a man from glory full of mercy and grace  
  
Hell pick you up hell hold your hand hell ease your pain  
so you can smile again good God Almighty  
  
Tell me how you feel when youre all alone  
No one to say I love you and you feel all your hope is gone  
Try to call your best friend but hes not there  
So you wind up feeling empty like no one cares  
  
My brother dont you worry storms dont last always  
Theres a man from glory full of mercy and grace  
  
Keep your head up smile again  
keep your head up smile again
