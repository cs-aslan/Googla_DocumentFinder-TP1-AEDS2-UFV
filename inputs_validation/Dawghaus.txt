When I woke up this morning  
I wasnt in my bed  
You know I had an itchy itch feeling  
Running round my head  
  
I looked at my watch  
And this is what it said  
You got them dawghouse blues  
Got them in your shoes  
  
Boy you know youre bound to lose  
Well I got up  
And header home right away  
You know I was wondering  
  
Why my baby would say  
She said wait  
She said wait  
Well you been out all night  
  
Got into a fight  
And now you got them dawghouse blues  
I said baby baby baby  
Baby please dont go  
  
I said baby baby baby  
Theres something you should know  
Well that trick you do  
Its not so new  
  
Someday them dawghouse blues are gonna  
Get to you  
You know my woman was waitin  
Stick in hand  
  
She beat me good whew  
Now I dont understand  
I thought there was freedom  
In this here land  
  
I got them dawghouse blues  
Got em in my shoes  
Man you know Im gonna lose  
I said  
I said
