Sunday at six when they close both the gates  
A widowed pair  
Still sitting there  
Wonder if theyre late for church  
And its cold so they fasten their coats  
And cross the grass theyre always last  
  
Passing by the padlocked swings  
The roundabout still turning  
Ahead they see a small girl  
On her way home with a pram  
  
Inside the archway  
The priest greets them with a courteous nod  
Hes close to God  
Looking back at days of four instead of two  
Years seem so few four instead of two  
Heads bent in prayer  
For friends not there  
  
Leaving twopence on the plate  
They hurry down the path and through the gate  
And wait to board the bus  
That ambles down the street
