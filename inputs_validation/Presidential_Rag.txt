You said you didnt know  
That the cats with the birds were there  
And you never go along with that kind of stuff no where  
But that just isnt the point man  
Thats the wrong wrong way to go  
If you didnt know about that one well then what else dont you know  
You said that you were lied to  
Well that aint hard too see  
But you must have been fooled again by your friends across the sea  
And maybe you were fooled again by your people here at home  
Because nobody could talk like you  
And know whats going on  
Nobody elected your family  
And we didnt elect your friends  
No one voted for your advisers  
And nobody wants the men  
Youre the one we voted for so you must take the blame  
For handing out authority to men who were insane  
You say its all fixed up now youve got new guys on the line  
But you had better remember this while you still got the time  
Mothers still are weeping for their boys that went to war  
Father still are asking what the whole damn thing was for  
And People still are hungry and people still are poor  
And on this week of work these days dont feed the kids no more  
Schools are still like prison  
Cause we dont learn how to live  
And everybody wants to take nobody wants to give  
Yes you will be remembered be remembered very well  
And if I live a long life all the stories I could tell  
A mans who falls in poverty of sickness and of grief  
Hell yes  
You will be remembered be remembered very well  
You said you didnt know  
That the that the cats with the birds were there  
Youd never go along with that kind of stuff no where  
But that just isnt the point man  
Thats the wrong wrong way to go  
You did
