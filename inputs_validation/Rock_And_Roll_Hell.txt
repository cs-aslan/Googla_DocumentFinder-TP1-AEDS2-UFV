Been under fire sixteen years just waitin for his time to come  
He fought the lies fought back the tears cant wait to hear that starting
gun  
There aint nobody gonna step on his dreams  
So he held his hands high and screamed  
  
Chorus  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell take me far away  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell I need to get away  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell  
  
Hes on the edge he can feel it in his heart  
This time the pressures really on  
Hes gonna fight it might even steal a guitar  
This time tomorrow hell be gone  
There aint nobody gonna tell him what to do  
Think hes a little like me and you  
  
Chorus  
  
Hes on the run wont stand for second place but his turn may never come  
Hes not a victim you can see it in his face  
But he cant see what hes become  
Well he wants it bad but he wants no charity  
He seems to think its his destiny  
  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell I need to get away  
Get me out of this rock and roll hell  
  
Chorus
