I bet you cant even walk down on a street  
When Im  
Trying to phone you trying to get around you  
 Hear once again in your ear babe  
Ima kick back and try to find  
An originally way to speak my mind  
  
Chorus  
Uhuu take it slow no need to rush  
I gotta think this through  
Dont wanna make you think that all I want  
Its just a physical thing babe  
I just wanna know you  
You must hear this all the time  
I love you but I just wanna love you  
I just wanna love you  
Baby you dont even got to give me your number  
You take mine  
Call me when youre ready  
Call me when youre ready  
  
No I wont lie to you baby  
Your body is meticulous  
But thats not all I see  
When I look at you baby  
Say Im not impatient baby  
Truthfully I will rather wait  
So I dont got to chase  
When the time is right you just give it to me  
  
Chorus  
Uhuu take it slow no need to rush  
I gotta think this through  
Dont wanna make you think that all I want  
Its just a physical thing babe  
I just wanna know you  
You must hear this all the time  
I love you but I just wanna love you  
I just wanna love you  
Baby you dont even got to give me your number  
You take mine  
Call me when youre ready  
Call me when youre ready  
  
Babe we dont have to rush  
We can take our time when it comes to us us  
This is just a night  
Who knows we might just fall in love
