Theres a name for war and killing  
Theres a name for giving in  
When you know another answer  
For me the name is sin  
But theres still time to turn around  
And make all hatred cease  
And give another name to living  
And we could call it peace  
And peace would be the road we walk  
Each step along the way  
And peace would be the way we work  
And peace the way we play  
And in all we see thats different  
And in all the things we know  
Peace would be the way we look  
And peace the way we grow  
Theres a name for separation  
Theres a name for first and last  
When its all for us or nothing  
For me the name is past  
But theres still time to turn around  
And make all hatred cease  
And give a name to all the future  
And we could call it peace  
And if peace is what we pray for  
And peace is what we give  
Then peace will be the way we are  
And peace the way we live  
Yes there still is the time to turn around  
And make all hatred cease  
And give another name to living  
And we can call it peace
