Such a silly silly silly silly fool am I  
Oh I just a silly silly silly silly fool am I  
  
Hey I should have never fallen  
Back in love with you  
Knowin how you get a pleasure  
Breaking my poor heart in two  
You made it sound so convincin  
When you said  
Im your woman youre my man  
Now I really need you  
And I sit here a loser again  
  
I guess Im just a silly silly silly silly fool am I oh I  
Im such a silly silly silly silly fool am I mmm  
  
I should have never trusted  
In my heart to lead the way  
Now my mind is all busted  
Thats a fools price to pay  
  
You made it sound so convincin  
When you said youd never never go away  
I should have never listened  
To anything you had to say  
  
Im such a silly silly silly silly silly silly fool am I yes I am  
Im such a silly silly silly silly fool am I oh  
Such a silly silly dilly silly dilly fool am I oh yeah  
Im such a silly silly silly silly silly fool am I oh yes I am  
Im such a silly silly dilly silly dilly silly fool am I oh yeah  
Im such a silly dilly silly dilly silly fool am I oh  
Silly dilly
