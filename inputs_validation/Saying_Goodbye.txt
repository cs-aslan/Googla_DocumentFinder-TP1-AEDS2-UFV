Saying goodbye  
  
I watched every sun up  
Comin over my tin cup  
Seen every moon changin  
While I slept with the sky  
Felt the chill in the north wind  
Find holes that I cant mend  
This West Texas cowboy is wrestless again  
  
Campfire light dancin  
On the smiles of some good friends  
Wearin the hard times  
In the lines on their faces  
Now the seasons are changin  
And its time I was leavin  
Cause this West Texas cowboy is wrestless again  
  
So Im sayin goodbyeye ridin away  
Sayin goodbyeye again  
Im wishin you well miss you until  
I come back again next year  
  
Lets sing of the good days  
And drink to the ladies  
Till the whiskys all gone  
And their pleasure is mine  
Come sit here beside me  
Sweet lullaby me  
This West Texas cowboy is wrestless again
