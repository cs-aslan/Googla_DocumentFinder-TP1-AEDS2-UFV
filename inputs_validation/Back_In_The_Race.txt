Well Im fallin just about as far as Im gonna fall  
Well Ive never been this slow before that I recall  
And Im gettin tired of people picking on me  
And I aint a goin down from here wait and see  
Theres gonna be a new dawn and a new day  
From this moment on things are gonna break my way  
Im gonna wear a new smile and a new face  
And then Im goin out and get back in the race  
  
Well the people been a walkin on me way too long  
And the way I gotta figure Ive been doin it wrong  
So from now on Im a gonna look out from me  
Im gonna do what I want to be what I want to be  
Theres gonna be a new dawn
