Something about this is precious something about this is sad  
Something about this is better than Ive ever had  
Hard and lean you know what I mean  
How do the roots become tangled why does the spirit grow tired  
Where is the key to your kingdom yes thats my desire  
Chorus  
There are those who live to count the cost  
And then those who count themselves content  
I see heaven wrapped up in a box  
It is you come back to love again in a dream this living dream  
Up in a heap Im not bothered down in the dumps Im okay  
Here in my heart youre the best road that Ill ever take Im serene yeh  
Chorus  
There are those who live to take the chance  
And then more who find themselves content  
I see heaven mapped out in advance  
It is you and thats my journeys end in a dream this living dream  
Im trying to hang on to the essence Im feeling more faint by the day  
It took such a long time to get it I dont want to see it erased  
Chorus  
There are those who live to count the cost  
And then more who count themselves content  
I see heaven wrapped up in a box  
It is you come back to love again in a dream this living dream  
This living dream
