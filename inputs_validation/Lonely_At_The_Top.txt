Tell Franie Im sorry she didnt get to know her dad  
Ill bet hes sorry he didnt get to know you too  
Tell her therell be people singing things that make her sad  
How her daddy felt alone how he was hurtin bad  
I guess that wont be too far from the truth  
  
Yeah its lonely at the top  
Happy is one thing its not  
  
I was jaded suffocated it got too hard to breath  
But I never got as high as I needed to be  
You know life becomes worthless when they steal your dreams  
I just couldnt live with what was left for me  
And I couldnt run far enough from the truth whats the use  
  
Yeah its lonely at the top  
Happys one thing its not  
  
Before you know you find yourself alone and looking down  
No one there can help you stop before you hit the ground  
Its lonely at the top ooh yeah  
  
Tell Franie Im sorry I better kiss her when she cries  
Im sorry I left her never said good bye  
Didnt mean to leave you all alone but then the music died  
Through the song remains the same I couldnt live that lie  
You know that aint too far from the truth  
  
Yeah its lonely at the top  
Happys one thing its not  
  
Before you know you find yourself alone and looking down  
No one there to help you stop before you hit the ground  
Yeah its lonely at the top  
Yeah its lonely at the top  
Its lonely
