Staring right at two thousand AD  
As if mankinds atrocities to man has no history  
But just a glance at life in two thousand BC  
We find traces of mans inhumanity to man  
Theres no mystery  
  
All for one one for all  
Theres no way well reach our greatest heights  
Unless we heed the call  
Me for you you for me  
Theres no chance of world salvation  
Less the conversations peace  
  
We cant pause watch and say no this cant be  
When theres a plan by any means to have  
Cleansing of ones ethnicity  
And we shouldnt act as if we dont hear nor see  
Like the holocaust of six million Jews and  
A hundred and fifty million blacks during slavery  
  
All for one one for all  
Theres no way well reach our greatest heights  
Unless we heed the call  
Me for you you for me  
Theres no chance of world salvation  
Less the conversations peace  
  
When publicly or privately convened  
May love positivity and lifes preservation  
be the basic theme  
And should you put your trust in some  
prophet in life  
Give him trust but your faith must stay  
with the one  
Who gave the ultimate sacrifice for  
  
All for one one for all  
Theres no way well reach our greatest heights  
Unless we heed the call  
Me for you you for me  
Theres no chance of world salvation  
Less the conversations peace
