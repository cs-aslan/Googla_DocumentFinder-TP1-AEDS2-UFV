Love is here  
Love is here  
And oh my darling now youre gone  
Now youre gone  
  
Love is here  
Love is here  
And oh my darling now now youre gone  
Now youre gone  
  
You persuaded me to love you  
And I did but instead of tenderness  
I found heartache instead  
Into your arms I felt so unaware  
Of the loneliness that was waiting there  
  
Look what youve done  
You close the door to your heart  
Look what youve done  
And you turned the key  
Locked your love away from me  
  
Love is here  
Love is here  
And oh my darling now youre gone  
Now youre gone  
  
You made me love you  
You made me love you  
And oh my darling now youre gone  
Now youre gone  
  
You said loving you would make life beautiful  
With each passing day  
But as soon as love came into my heart  
You turned and you walked just walked away  
  
Look what youve done  
You stripped me of my dreams  
Look what youve done  
You gave me faith then took my hope  
Look at me now  
  
Look at me  
See what loving you has done to me  
Look at my face  
Look at my face  
See how cryin has left its trace  
Left its trace  
  
After you made me all your own  
You made me all your own  
Then you left me all alone  
You left me all alone  
You made your words sound so sweet  
Knowing that your love I couldnt keep  
  
Look what youve done  
My heart cries out for your touch  
Look what youve done  
But youre not there  
And the lonely cry fades in the air  
  
Love is here  
Love is here  
And oh my darling now youre gone  
Now youre gone  
  
Love is here  
Love is here  
And oh my darling now youre gone  
Now youre gone  
  
You made me love you  
You made me love you  
Oh my darling now youre gone  
Now youre gone  
  
You made me love you  
You made me love you  
Oh my darling now youre gone  
Now youre gone  
  
You made me love you  
You made me love you
