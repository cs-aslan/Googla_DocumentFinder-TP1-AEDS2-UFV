I went down to the centre of town  
And my feet was a burning ground  
She stood on the corner merrily as can be  
I said hey good lookin wont you come with me  
She said yeah  
I am the stealer  
Came to steal your love  
  
The sun was shining  
The world was right  
I said Tell me baby whacha doin tonight  
Im goin round the corner  
Where the musics loud  
Im tired of the city  
Wont you come on round  
I said yeah  
Im the stealer  
Come to steal your love  
  
Steal your love oh yeah  
  
Goin round the corner  
Where the musics loud  
Im tired of the city  
Wont you come on round  
I said yeah  
I am the stealer  
Come to steal your love  
  
Steal your love  
Steal your love  
Steal your love  
  
I am going to steal you love away  
I am going to steal you love away  
Steal your love
