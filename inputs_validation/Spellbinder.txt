I found out the hard way some things you just cant get  
When I fell in love with a woman I wish I never met  
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time  
I fell easy prey to an innocent way I was so blind  
  
I call out her name I turn around to find her  
Shes a spellbinder  
  
Ive never been a easy man so hard to please  
But she made me feel life was unreal oh Lord how she satisfied me  
I tried to break away but I didnt stand a chance  
She planned it so well I was under her spell I was in a trance  
  
I call out her name I turn around to find her  
Shes a spellbinder  
  
Now do you know what love can do  
Oh no what she puts me through  
It took so long for me to find her  
Now she wont set me free  
Shes a spellbinder  
  
Now do you know what love can do  
Oh no what she put me through  
You say you cant believe believe that its true  
Let the spellbinder put a spell on you
