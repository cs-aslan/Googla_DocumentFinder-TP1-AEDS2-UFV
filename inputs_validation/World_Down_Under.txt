I believe in theres a world down under  
Yeah yeah hey  
I believe in theres a world down under  
  
Wave after wave  
Theres no wall for emotions now for me  
Infinity all day long  
Dream after dream  
Had to live in the presence not in the past  
At least a part will last  
  
All I need is love but loves not easy to find  
Cause Im saying all the time to all like this  
  
I believe in theres a world down under  
Where my heroes are playing with Alice  
Im not alone  
I have been there in a world down under  
Live the dream out today hey  
  
I know its hard  
To be seen as a person when you play  
Alice in Wonderland  
Are kind of figures  
That speak to them  
You dont understand  
Whats driven me to that land  
  
All I need is love but loves not easy to find  
All in all Im saying all the time to all  
  
I believe in theres a world down under  
Where my heroes are playing with Alice  
Im not alone  
I have been there in a world down under  
Live the dream out today hey  
  
I believe in theres a world down under  
Where my heroes are playing with Alice  
Im not alone  
I have been there in a world down under  
Live the dream out today hey
