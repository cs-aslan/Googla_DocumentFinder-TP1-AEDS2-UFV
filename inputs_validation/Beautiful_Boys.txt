Youre a beautiful boy  
With all your little toys  
Your eyes have seen the world  
Though youre only four years old  
And your tears are streaming  
Even when youre smiling  
Please never be afraid to cry  
  
Youre a beautiful boy  
With all your little ploys  
Your mind has changed the world  
And youre now forty years old  
You got all you can carry  
And still feel somehow empty  
Dont ever be afraid to fly  
  
All you beautiful boys  
Creating multiple plays  
You like to fence in your world  
And settle down when youre old  
You can run from pole to pole  
And never scratch your soul  
Dont be afraid to go to hell and back  
Dont be afraid to go to hell and back  
Dont be afraid to be afraid
