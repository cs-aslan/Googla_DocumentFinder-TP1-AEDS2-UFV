I Change the key from see to D  
You see to me its just a minor thing  
He knows everything  
To readjust youve got to trust  
That all the fuss is just a minor thing  
He knows everything  
Its just a minor thing  
And Im a minor king  
He knows everything  
  
Youve got your bit part Mozart  
Hot dart acceleration  
Pop art pistol chasin  
Cat fight intimidation  
  
To read a mind youve got to  
Redefine the line to make your circle sing  
He knows everything  
You make a sound  
The spell is bound to come around  
Its just a minor thing  
  
He knows everything  
Its just a minor thing  
And Im a minor king  
He knows everything  
  
Youve got your bit part Mozart  
Hot dart acceleration  
Pop art pistol chasin  
Cat fight intimidation  
All out interfacing  
Black star motivation  
Vampire sugar junkie  
Data basin infiltration  
  
I Change the key from see to D  
You see to me its just a minor thing  
He knows everything  
To readjust youve got to trust  
That all the fuss is just a minor thing  
He knows everything  
Its just a minor thing  
And Im a minor king  
Its just a minor thing  
And Im a minor king
