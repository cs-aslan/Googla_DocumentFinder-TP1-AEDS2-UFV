My Gods a big God  
He walks among the mountains  
My Gods a big God  
He rises from the sea my Gods a big God  
The stars surround his shoulders  
My Gods a big God but small enough to live in me  
  
My Gods a strong God he made the mighty mountains  
My Gods a strong God but he holds me gently in his hands  
  
My Gods a loud God his fingers snap like thunder  
My Gods a loud God he rocks the hemisphere  
My Gods a loud God he echoes through the ages  
My Gods a loud God but he whispers softly in my ear  
  
My Gods a big God he walks among the mountains  
My Gods a big God he rises from the sea  
My Gods a big God the stars surround his shoulders  
My Gods a big God but small enough to live in me  
  
My Gods a strong God he made the mighty mountains  
My Gods a strong God but he holds me gently in his hands  
My Gods a loud God his fingers snap like thunder  
My Gods a loud God he rocks the hemisphere  
My Gods a loud God he echoes through the ages  
My Gods a loud God but he whispers softly in my ear  
  
Chorus
