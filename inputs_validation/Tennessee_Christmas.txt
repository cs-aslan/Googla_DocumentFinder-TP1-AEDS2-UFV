Come on weather man give us a forecast snoowy white  
Cant you hear the prayers of every childlike heart tonight  
Rockies are callin Denver snow fallin  
Somebody said its four feet deep but it doesnt matter  
Give me the laughter Im gonna choose to keep  
  
Another tender Tennessee Christmas the only Chirstmas for me  
Where the love circles arounf us like th gifts around our tree  
Well I know theres more snow up in Colorado than my roof will ever see  
But a tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me  
  
Every now and then I get a wanderin urge to see  
Maybe California maybe Tinsel TOwns for me  
Theres a parade there wed have it made there  
Bring home a tan for New Years Eve  
Sure sounds exciting awfully inviting still I think Im gonna keep  
  
Another tender Tennessee Christmas the only CHristmas for me  
Where the love circles around us like the gifts around our tree  
Well they say in LA its a warm holiday its th only place to be  
A tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me  
  
Well I know theres more snow up in Colorado than my roof will ever see  
But a tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me  
A tender Tennessee CHristmas is the only Christmas for me
