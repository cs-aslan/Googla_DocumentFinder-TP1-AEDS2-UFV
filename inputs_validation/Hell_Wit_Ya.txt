What is this I heard youve got a new miss  
Just broke up so you know that Im pissed  
They say your faithful I dont believe that shit oh no oh no  
  
Bridge  
Oh Ive tried to act like I dont care  
But it doesnt seem fair youre so good to her  
And Ive tried to pretend I dont see  
All those things that you do you couldnt do for me  
  
Chorus  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didnt wanna treat me right  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didnt wanna treat me right  
Now you got another girl in your life  
Givin her love all day all night  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didnt wanna treat me right  
  
So I hear Ive met the wench before Yeah I remember that time we went to
Pizza Hut and you told me she was your cousin  
I hear you learned to open doors When did you become such a damn gentleman  
  
Bridge  
Oh Ive tried to act like I dont care  
But it doesnt seem fair youre so good to her  
And Ive tried to pretend I dont see  
All those things that you do you couldnt do for me  
  
Chorus  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didnt wanna treat me right  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didnt wanna treat me right  
Now you got another girl in your life  
Givin her love all day all night  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didnt wanna treat me right  
  
What does she do to you to make you give her everything  
Like you never did for me  
Call it jealousy but its killing me  
Cause all the time that you were mine  
You didnt treat me right  
No no no you didnt treat me right no no no Whoa  
  
Chorus  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didnt wanna treat me right  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didnt wanna treat me right  
Now you got another girl in your life  
Givin her love all day all night  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didnt wanna treat me right
