Well Im going out west where I belong  
Where the days are short and the nights are long  
  
And Ill walk a little walk Ill twist a little twist  
Ill shimmy a little shimmy Ill fly a little fly  
Yea were out there having fun in the warm California sun  
  
Well Im going out west out on the coast  
Where the California girls are really the most  
  
Where they walk and Ill walk They fish and Ill fish  
They sin and Ill sin They fly and Ill fly  
Where theyre out there having fun in the warm California sun  
  
Well the girls are frisky in old Frisco  
A pretty little chick wherever you go  
  
And they walk and Ill walk They fish and Ill fish  
They sin and Ill sin They fly and Ill fly  
Where theyre out there having fun in the warm California sun  
  
Were out there having fun yeah in the warm California sun
