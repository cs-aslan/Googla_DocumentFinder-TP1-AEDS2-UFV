Chorus  
Im an Indian outlaw  
Half Cherokee and Choctaw  
My baby shes a Chippewa  
Shes one of a kind  
  
All my friends call me Bear Claw  
Village cheatin is my pawpaw  
He gets his orders from my mawmay  
She makes him walk the line  
  
You can find me in my wigwam  
Ill be beatin on my tomtom  
Pull out the pipe and smoke you some  
Hey and pass it around  
  
Chorus  
  
I aint lookin for trouble  
We can ride my pony double  
Make your little heart bubble  
Like a glass of wine  
  
I remember the medicine man  
He caught runnin water in my hands  
Drug me round by my headband  
Said I wasnt the kind  
  
Chorus  
  
I can kill a deer or buffalo  
With just my arrow and my hickory bow  
From a hundred yards dont you know  
I do it all the time  
  
They all gather round my teepee  
Late at night tryin to catch a peek  
At me in nothin but my buffalo briefs  
I got em standin in line  
  
Chorus
