Seether is neither loose nor tight  
Seether is neither black nor white  
I try to keep her on a short leash  
I try to calm her down  
I try to ram her into the ground yeah  
  
Cant fight the seether  
Cant fight the seether  
Cant fight the seether  
  
I cant see her till Im foaming at the mouth  
Seether is neither big nor small  
Seether is the center of it all  
I try to rock her in my cradle  
I try to knock her out  
I try to cram her back in my mouth yeah  
  
Cant fight the seether  
Cant fight the seether  
Cant fight the seether  
  
I cant see her till Im foaming at the mouth  
Keep her down boiling water  
Keep her down what a lovely daughter  
Oh she is not born like other girls  
But I know how to conceive her  
Oh she may not look like other girls  
But shes a snarl tooth seether Seether  
  
Cant fight the seether  
Cant fight the seether  
Cant fight the seether  
  
I cant see her till Im foaming at the mouth  
Yeah
