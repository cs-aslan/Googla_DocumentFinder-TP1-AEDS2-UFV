My baby dont care for shows  
My baby dont care for clothes  
My baby just cares for me  
  
My baby dont care for cars and races  
My baby dont care for high tone places  
  
Elizabeth Taylor is not his style  
And even Ricky Martins smile  
Is something he cant see  
My baby dont care who knows it  
My baby just cares for me  
  
I wonder whats wrong with baby  
My baby just cares for  
He just says his prayers for  
My baby just cares  
For me
