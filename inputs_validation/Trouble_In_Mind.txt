You know right now Ive got trouble in mind  
Shes a special girl who wants to treat me right  
I can tell by the way that she walks  
A woman of the world who likes the city lights  
I can tell by the way that she talks  
I cant remember where it happened all too fast  
I dont know what you really want me to say  
But when she walked on by there was no turning back  
I knew shed steal my emotions away  
Oh all this talk about whats wrong or right  
We gotta get to the bottom of this tonight  
  
And if I ever get back on my feet again  
I wont give you up ohno  
And we can always look back on what should have been  
But honey right now Ive got trouble in mind Little trouble  
  
The word will get around thats just the way it is  
But dont believe everything that you hear  
Cause when it all comes down to a love like this  
All the rumors will soon disappear  
Oh love can travel on a broken line  
But baby everybody has to take a chance sometime  
  
And if I ever get back on my feet again  
I wont give you up ohno  
And we can always look back on what should have been  
But honey right now Ive got some some trouble in mind  
  
Somehow theres something that Im missin  
I cant let you know ohno  
Right now I gotta try and make you listen  
Ill be back in time  
Waiting at the end of the line  
  
Love can travel on a broken line  
Everybody has to take a chance sometime  
And if I ever get back on my feet again  
I wont give you up ohno  
Cause we can always look back on what should have been  
Cause you know honey right now Ive got trouble in mind  
  
And if I ever get back on my feet again  
I wont give you up ohno  
And we can always look back on what should have been  
But baby right now Ive got trouble in mind  
  
Nothin but trouble  
You know right now Ive got trouble in mind  
You know right now Ive got trouble in mind  
Lock me up and throw away the key  
You know right now Ive got trouble in mind  
Ive got it bad  
You know right now Ive got trouble in mind
