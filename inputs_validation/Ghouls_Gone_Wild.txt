Were gonna have a bash and were glad you finally got here  
Cause were already trashed and the band is really hot yeah  
Were gonna dance our heads off and were gonna keep it tight  
If we keep ourselves together we might make it through the night  
  
Ghouls gone wild wilder than before  
We had a little taste and now we need a little more  
Ghouls gone wild screamin in the night  
Were feelin kinda hungry and we came in for a bite  
  
Ghouls  
Oohwah oohwah  
Ghouls  
Oohwah oohwah  
  
Were gonna raise some hell yeah were gonna rock and roll here  
And the sulfur that you smell well it adds a little soul there  
Were dancin on your grave and were dancin in the street  
Were dancin through the fire and its burnin up our feet  
Burnin up our feet  
  
Ghouls gone wild  
Ghouls gone wild  
Wilder than before

We had a little taste
