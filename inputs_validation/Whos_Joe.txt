Hey Joe what you doing  
It seems like its all going wrong  
Theres a storm in the sky passing over  
And it looks like its going to be strong  
  
Youve got eyes like an old wounded soldier  
They cry tears to be lost in the wind  
  
Hey Joe  
Hey Joe  
Hey Joe  
What are you gonna do  
  
Ill look for you  
And Ill get you home  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Ive got to find you  
Ive got to find you Whatever I do  
  
Ill look for you  
And Ill take you there  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Ive got to find you  
Whatever I do Whatever I do  
  
Hey Joe what you doing  
They say you dont care anymore  
You had your heart broke by a woman  
Now it doesnt work anymore  
She said that you had it coming  
That you were no good from the start  
  
Hey Joe  
Hey Joe  
Hey Joe  
Its time to go home  
  
Ill look for you  
And Ill get you home  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Ive got to find you  
Ive got to find you Whatever I do  
  
Ill look for you  
And Ill take you there  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Ive got to find you  
Whatever I do Whatever I do  
Whatever I do Whatever I do  
Whatever I do Whatever I do  
Whatever I do Whatever I do  
Whatever I do Whatever I do
