Let me sigh let me cry when Im blue  
Let me go away from this lonely town  
Wont be long till my sun will be blue  
Cause I know Im on my last go round  
All the love I could steal beg or borrow  
Wouldnt heal all the pain in my soul  
  
What is love Only a prelude to sorrow  
With a heartbreak ahead for your goal  
Here I go now you know why Im leaving  
Got the blues What can I lose Goodbye  
  
What is love Only a prelude to sorrow  
With a heartbreak ahead for your goal  
Here I go now you know why Im leaving  
I got the blues What can I lose Goodbye
