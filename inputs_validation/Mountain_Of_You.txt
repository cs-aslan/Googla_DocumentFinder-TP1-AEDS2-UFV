I cant wait til its light out  
Theres some things I should get them done  
Tried inhaling some white out  
Ended up with some bleeding gums  
  
Anything I left in the closet  
Shouldnt have a hard time getting out  
If I had the time I could make it  
Seems to be the chances are chasing  
  
All the substance Ive done without  
And all the luck that Ive hated  
Aside from all of the petty doubt  
Cant believe I have made it  
  
Im afraid of the dark now  
Its the sign of a patsy  
Round the time of the door brow  
We should let it come in  
  
Never put your face in the water  
It hurts your eyes when they open up  
Not that any different could matter  
Its just a different conspirit  
  
If theres one thing I could laugh about  
Solve this mess Ive created  
Ive tried a part of the sacred cow  
  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you  
  
If theres one thing I could laugh about  
Solve this mess Ive created  
Ive tried a part of the sacred cow  
  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you  
Mountain of you
