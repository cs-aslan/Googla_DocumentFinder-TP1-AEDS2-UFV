Stuck in a corner  
Are monkeys in cages  
That dont have a number  
To fight one another  
  
Try to recover  
Climb up the ladder  
Look up and you see birds  
Blind as each other  
How long can we suffer  
  
Were as blind as each other  
On the cloud that youre sitting  
Theres one born every minute  
So much to discover  
Ive become a believer  
  
Sisters and brothers  
Who fight one another  
Will mourn and deceive us  
Will find us and keep us  
  
Take us or leave us  
How soon is now yeah  
How long is never  
Im nothing but normal  
With something together  
  
Come on and stick together  
On the cloud that youre sitting  
Theres one born every minute  
So much to discover  
Ive become a believer
