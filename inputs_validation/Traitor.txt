Your feet in your mouth but they never get wet

Traitor traitor  
She just hears what she wants to fill  
She cant help it the girl cant help it  
Destroys her brain shes out of touch  
Just what do you do thats worth so much  
She had to run know what I mean  
You and your convenient dream  
Did she hurt you bet she hurt  
She left me naked she just lost her shirt  
Aint no letter of revenge  
Every line has got to end  
Youre just one woman I cant depend  
See you later traitor
