Ive been out on this highway now  
Five days in a row  
My words all run together  
My feet are moving slow  
Ive got to stop and eat  
While its still light  
Theres a local angel sitting on my right  
Do you believe in love at first sight  
Baby you look good to me tonight  
  
Im ordinarily very shy  
And Id be polite if I had time  
Baby you look good to me tonight  
Tomorrow Ill be good and gone  
Please dont make me wait that long  
Baby you look good to me tonight  
  
I get off at eleven she said  
And walked away  
She poured a cup of coffee and  
She brought it on a tray  
She said it would be nice if you could stay  
Youre the best idea Ive had all day  
Usually I put up a fight but  
Baby you look good to me tonight  
  
Well Im ordinarily very shy  
But I grinned at her as I ate my pie  
Baby you look good to me tonight  
I thought I must be in a dream  
When she asked me if I wanted cream  
Baby you look good to me tonight  
  
All in all you know  
Its not a bad life on the road  
If youve got wheels to roll  
And lucky stars above  
Your destinys your own  
You go as far as you can go  
And if theres time to sleep  
Theres time to make love  
  
I came I saw I conquered  
But I rode off in the sun  
But I know the look she left with me  
Keeps telling me she won  
Her face is the only thing I see  
Whispering those words of prophesy  
  
I may come easy but I dont come free  
Youre never gonna see the last of me  
Baby you look good to me tonight  
I was born to love you now cant you see  
Baby you look good to me tonight  
Im ordinarily very shy  
But I take the time to satisfy  
Baby you look good to me tonight
