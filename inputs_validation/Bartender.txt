If I go  
Before Im old  
Oh brother of mine  
Please dont forget me if I go  
  
Bartender please  
Fill my glass for me  
With the wine you gave Jesus that set him free  
After three days in the ground  
  
Oh and if I die  
Before my time  
Oh sweet sister of mine  
Please dont regret me if I die  
  
Bartender please  
Fill my glass for me  
With the wine you gave Jesus that set him free  
After three days in the ground  
  
Bartender please  
Fill my glass for me  
With the wine you gave Jesus that set him free  
After three days in the ground  
  
Im on bended knees I pray  
Bartender please  
  
When I was young I didnt think about it  
Now I cant get it out of my mind  
  
Im on bended knees  
Father please  
  
Oh and if all this gold  
Should steal my soul away  
Oh dear mother of mine  
Please redirect me if this gold  
  
Bartender you see  
The wine thats drinking me  
Came from the vine that strung Judas from the Devils tree  
His roots deep deep in the ground
