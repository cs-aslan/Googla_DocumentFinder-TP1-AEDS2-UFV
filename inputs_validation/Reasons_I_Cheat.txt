A working day to long when everything goes wrong  
And a boss who dont know Im alive  
  
I once had a notion Id get that promotion but now I barley survive  
A wife to demanding with no understanding  
Of why I stay dead on my feet  
  
A dimly lit tavern a willing young woman  
Are some of the reasons I cheat  
The hair that Im losing and a women whos choosing  
To lay sound asleep by my side  
The bills they are mounting thats when I start counting  
On someone to help sooth my pride  
  
A lady that knows me affection she shows me and a smile so easy and sweet  
The dreams that Ive buried the load that Ive carried  
Are some of the reasons I cheat  
  
My children keep on growing me age keeps on showing  
Like all of my old friends I meet  
So Im getting older my lifes growing colder  
Just some of the reasons I cheat  
Yes Im getting older my lifes growing colder  
Just some of the reasons I cheat
