My mama told me when I was hatched  
Act like a superstar  
Save your allowance buy a bubble dress  
And someday you will go far  
Now on red carpets well Im hard to miss  
The press follows everywhere I go  
Ill poke your eye out with a dress like this  
Back off and enjoy the show  
  
Im sure my critics will say its a grotesque display  
Well they can bite me baby I perform this way  
I might be wearin Swiss cheese or maybe covered with bees  
It doesnt mean Im crazy I perform this way from this way  
  
Ooh my little monsters pay lots cause I perform this way  
Baby I perform this way perform this way  
Ooh dont worry Im okay hey I just perform this way  
Im not crazy I perform this way  
  
Ill be a troll or evil queen  
Ill be a human jelly bean  
Cause every day is Halloween for me  
  
Im so completely original  
My new look is all the rage  
Ill wrap my small intestines round my neck  
And set fire to myself on stage  
Ill wear a porcupine on my head  
On a WHIM  
And for no reason now Ill sing in French  
Excusezmoi qui a PT express yourself  
  
Got my straight jacket today its made of gold lame  
No not because Im crazy I perform this way  
I strap prime rib to my feet cover myself with raw meat  
Ill bet youve never seen a skirt steak worn this way  
  
Dont be offended when you see  
My latest pop monstrosity  
Im strange weird shocking odd bizarre  
Im Frankenstein Im Avatar  
Theres nothing too embarrassing  
Ill honestly do anything  
But wear white after Labor Day  
Cause baby I perform this way  
  
Hope you wont think its cliche if I go nude today  
Dont call the cops now baby I perform this way  
No reason I should regret all the attention I get  
Im not completely crazy I perform this way yeah  
  
I perform this wayhey I perform this wayhey  
Im always deviating from the norm this wayhey  
I perform this wayhey I perform this wayhey  
Im really not insane I just perform this wayhey
