Id rather have Jesus than silver or gold  
Id rather be His than have riches untold  
Id rather have Jesus than houses or land  
Id rather be led by His nail scarred hands  
  
Than to be the king of a vast domain  
Or be held in sins dread sway  
Id rather have Jesus than anything  
This world affords today  
  
Id rather have Jesus than mens applause  
Id rather be faithful to His dear cause  
Id rather have Jesus than world wide fame  
Id rather be true to His holy name  
  
Than to be a king of the best domain  
Or be held in sins dreads way  
Id rather have Jesus than anything  
This world affords today
