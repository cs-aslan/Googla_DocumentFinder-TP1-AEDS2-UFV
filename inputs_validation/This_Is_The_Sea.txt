These things you keep  
Youd better throw them away  
You wanna turn your back  
On your soulless days  
Once you were tethered  
And now you are free  
Once you were tethered  
Well now you are free  
That was the river  
This is the sea  
  
Now if youre feelin weary  
If youve been alone too long  
Maybe youve been suffering from  
A few too many  
Plans that have gone wrong  
And youre trying to remember  
How fine your life used to be  
Running around banging your drum  
Like its 1973  
Well that was the river  
This is the sea  
Wooo  
  
Now you say youve got trouble  
You say youve got pain  
You sayve got nothing left to believe in  
Nothing to hold on to  
Nothing to trust  
Nothing but chains  
Youre scouring your conscience  
Raking through your memories  
Scouring your conscience  
Raking through your memories  
But that was the river  
This is the sea yeah  
  
Now I can see you wavering  
As you try to decide  
Youve got a war in your head  
And its tearing you up inside  
Youre trying to make sense  
Of something that you just cant see  
Trying to make sense now  
And you know you once held the key  
But that was the river  
And this is the sea  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Now I hear theres a train  
Its coming on down the line  
Its yours if you hurry  
Youve got still enough time  
And you dont need no ticket  
And you dont pay no fee  
No you dont need no ticket  
You dont pay no fee  
Because that was the river  
And this is the sea  
  
Behold the sea
