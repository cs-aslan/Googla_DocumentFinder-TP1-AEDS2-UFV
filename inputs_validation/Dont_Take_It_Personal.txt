Shoulda known it when I met you  
Everybody was trying to tell me  
But you had me blinded  
Its all good though  
Now I understand  
  
Verse 1  
What you did was shady girl  
Thought you were my lady girl thats why  
I straight made you girl  
Gave you all the finer things in life  
Homie said to stop the flow  
Told me you were nothing but a ho  
I ignored him though  
And you took me through for sho  
  
Chorus  
I guess this must be why  
Most guys Dont get personal  
Just when we decide  
Its all right We get left alone  
And even though I try I cant hide  
What Im going through  
Thought you would be mine only mine and I fell hard for you  
  
Verse 2  
I guess I shouldnt even trip  
Homie said get over it Ive tried  
But I cant forget  
How you had me open for your lies  
Every other girl I meet  
Cant even trust because Ive seen  
What youve done to me  
Aint no telling when Id be ready  
  
Chorus x2  
I remember when you said I was your only man  
But Im wiser now and Ill never hurt again  
Getting over you if its the last thing that I do  
No we cant even be cool  
I dont need a friend like you  
  
Chorus x3 til fade
