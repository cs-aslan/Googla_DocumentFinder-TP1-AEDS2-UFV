I was lost in darkness and sinking sand  
Well I was barely nothing a broken man  
But you picked up the pieces of my heart in your hand  
Then you came and showed to me loves second chance  
  
Chorus  
Shine on shine on shine on me  
Whenever somethings missing  
Youre exactly what I need  
Your love has shown me the light and now I finally see  
Shine on shine on shine on me  
  
Lord knows that Im not perfect but I sure do try  
And I see the man that I can be in your eyes  
Well there are times I still get lost in yesterday  
But you out the past behind me and you light my way  
  
Chorus  
  
Shine on shine on shine on me  
Wont you keep on shining yeah  
Wont you keep on shining your love  
Down on me baby  
  
Wont you keep on shining yeah  
Wont you keep on shining your love  
Yeah youre exactly what I need baby  
Yeah you are
