I get up when Im down  
I cant swim but my soul wont drown  
I do believe I got flare  
I got speed and I walk on air  
  
Cause God gimme soul in your rocknroll babe  
Cause God gimme soul in your rocknroll babe  
And I get so high I just cant feel it  
And I get so high I just cant feel it  
  
In and out my brain  
Youre runnin through my vein  
Youre my sunshine  
Youre my rain  
  
Theres a light that shines on  
Shines on me and it keeps me warm  
It gimme peace I must say  
I cant sleep cause the world wont wait  
  
Cause God gimme soul in your rocknroll babe  
Cause God gimme soul in your rocknroll babe  
And I get so high I just cant feel it  
And I get so high I just cant feel it  
  
In and out my brain  
Youre runnin through my vein  
Youre my sunshine  
Youre my rain  
  
And I get so high I just cant feel it  
And I get so high I just cant feel it  
And I get so high I just cant feel it  
And I get so high I just cant feel it  
  
In and out my brain  
Youre runnin through my vein  
Youre my sunshine  
Youre my rain
