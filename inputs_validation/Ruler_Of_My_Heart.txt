Ruler of my heart  
Robber of my soul  
Where can you be  
I wait patiently  
  
My heart cries out  
Pain inside  
Where can you be  
I wait patiently  
  
When youre alone  
The going get rough  
Come back come back come back baby  
Ive had enough  
  
Make me a queen  
Happy again  
Here my cry  
And ease my pain  
  
When youre alone  
Going gets rough  
Come back come back come back baby  
Ive had enough  
  
Make me a queen  
Happy again  
Hear me cry  
Ease my pain
