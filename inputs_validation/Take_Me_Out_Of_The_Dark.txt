Just what is it in me  
Sometimes I just dont know  
What keeps me in Your love  
Why you never let me go  
  
And though youre in me now  
I fall and hurt you still  
My Lord please show me how  
To know just how you feel  
  
You have forgiven me  
Too many times it seems  
I feel Im not what you might call  
A worthy Christian after all  
  
And though I love You so  
Temptation finds its way to me  
  
Teach me to trust in You  
With all my heart  
To lean not on my own understanding  
I just forget  
You wont give me what I cant bear  
  
Take me out of the dark my Lord  
I dont wanna be there  
  
Youve never left my side  
You gave Your hand to me to hold  
Oh Jesus Im no longer in the cold  
  
And yet I leave You there  
When I feel satisfied  
Id like to thank You every day  
Not only when I feel that way  
  
Ive never known a Man  
Whod give His life for sinners like me  
And yet because He loves us so  
Hes promised us eternity  
And we can have that promise  
And be His if we have faith  
And just believe  
  
Teach us to trust in you  
With all my heart  
To lean not on my own understanding  
We just forget  
You wont give us what we cant bear  
  
Take us out of the dark My Lord  
Cause we dont want to be alone  
Take me out of the dark My Lord  
We dont wanna be there My Lord  
  
Trust in You with all my heart  
Lean not on my own understanding  
I just forget  
You wont give me what I cant bear  
  
Take me out of the dark My Lord  
Cause we dont want to be alone  
Take me out of the dark My Lord  
I dont want to be there
