Suzy was nine and I was ten  
Right at the time when boys like to think theyre men  
She used to follow us at school  
We really thought that she was a little fool  
And one day we said to her  
We dont want to hurt you girl  
But youd better  
  
Look for a friend of your own Suzyhangaround  
Better come back when youre grown Suzyhangaround  
Nobody wants you around here and thats for sure  
So get off our playground and stay away  
Thats all that weve got to say

Suzy went home to Mamas arms  
Mama said Look shes never done you no harm  
So get off her back and let her be  
Why cant you play together in harmony  
We really didnt know what to say  
But as soon as she went away  
We laughed and said
