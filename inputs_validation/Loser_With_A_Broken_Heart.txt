Many miles of memories many tears I cant forget  
But I know you live inside me yet oh  
Many hours to contemplate many dreams I cant recall  
Many nights Ive felt I was too small  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart yeah  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart yeah yeah  
Its a hard and bitter world when you face reality  
And its hard to be who you want to be oh  
Many miles of memories catch the wind and blow away  
But I know that its over over anyway oh  
But tonight I sit and wonder why you left me here  
After all this time I dont know why you left me here  
If its all behind me you know youll find me oh  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart yeah  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart oh yeah  
But tonight I sit wonder why you left me here  
After all this time I wonder why wonder why you left me here  
If its all behind me you know youll find me oh oh  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart yeah  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart oh yeah  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart yeah  
Im a loser  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart oh yeah  
Im a loser  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart yeah  
Im a loser  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart oh yeah  
Im a loser  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart yeah  
Im a loser  
Nothing more than a loser with a broken heart oh yeah  
Im a loser
