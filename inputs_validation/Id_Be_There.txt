Not a minute goes by that you aint on my mind  
Not a place in my heart that you dont occupy  
I miss you  
  
If I could I would crawl through the phone  
Yeah this drink gets me by but it dont get me home  
Are you sleeping I aint sleeping  
  
So I wrote you a song cause its been so long  
Since I looked in your eyes  
If there was a way I could see you today  
And hold your sweet sweet smile  
Id be there Id be there  
Id be there  
  
Im watching the clock but the clock doesnt care  
Im the star of the show called I wish I was there  
Babe I miss you  
  
And thinking of you puts a smile on my face  
And it makes me forget that I hate this place  
Ive been dreaming  
But I still aint sleeping  
  
So I wrote you a song cause its been so long  
Since I looked in your eyes  
If there was a way I could see you today  
And hold your sweet sweet smile  
Id be there Id be there  
Id be there  
  
Not a minute goes by that you aint on my mind  
Not a place in my heart that you dont occupy  
I miss you  
  
So I wrote you a song cause its been so long  
Since I looked in your eyes  
If there was a way I could see you today  
And hold your sweet sweet smile  
Id be there Id be there Id be there Id be there  
  
Id be there
