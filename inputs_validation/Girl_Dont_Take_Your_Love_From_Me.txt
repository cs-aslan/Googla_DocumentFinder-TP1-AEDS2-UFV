Oh  
Foolish of me I couldnt see  
The forest for the trees  
Youve been so true  
Ive been so cruel to you  
Oh girl please dont leave me  
  
Chorus  
If you stay Ill find a way  
To erase the past  
Baby dont leave me  
Girl dont take your love from me  
Oh girl  
  
What can I say to make you stay  
Baby dont leave me  
Youve been so kind  
It blows my mind to know  
Oh girl I really hurt you  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell me girl its not to late  
And you give me a chance  
To make it up to you  
Dont take your love from me  
Girl dont take your love  
Dont take your love  
  
Bridge  
Girl if you take your love away from me  
Im gonna be in misery  
Your love is the strength that I lean upon  
How will I make it when its gone  
Of all the little things I wanted to say  
I really wanted to do  
Girl this time  
Oh oh girl I really mean it  
  
Chorus  
  
So tell me girl its not too late  
And youll give me a chance  
To make it up to you  
Dont take your love from me  
Dont take your love no no no no no  
Dont take your love  
Dont leave me girl  
  
Dont take your love from me  
Baby dont take your love from me  
Dont take your love from me  
Oh dont take your love from me  
Baby dont take your love from me
