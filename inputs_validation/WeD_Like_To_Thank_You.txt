All  
  
Today were living in a shanty  
Today were scrounging for a meal  
  
Sophie  
  
Today Im stealing coal for fires  
Who knew I could steal  
  
Men  
  
I used to winter in the tropics  
  
Women  
  
I spent my summers at the shore  
  
Fred  
  
I used to throw away the paper  
  
All  
He dont anymore  
Wed like to thank you Herber Hoover  
For really showing us the way  
Wed like to thank you Herbert Hoover  
You made us what we are today  
  
Prosperity was round the corner  
A cozy cottage built for two  
In this blue heaven  
That you  
Gave us  
Yes  
  
Were turning blue  
They offered us Al Smith and Hoover  
We paid attention and we chose  
Not only did we pay attention  
We paid through the nose  
  
In evry pot he said a chicken  
But Herbert Hoover he forgot  
Not only dont we have the chicken  
We aint got the pot  
Hey Herbie  
  
Women  
  
You left behind a greatful nation  
  
All  
  
So Herb our hats are off to you  
Were up to here with admiration  
  
Sophie  
  
Come down and have a little stew  
  
All  
  
Come down and share some Christmas dinner  
Be sure to bring the missus too  
We got no turkey for our stuffing  
So why dont we stuff you  
Wed like to thank you Herbert Hoover  
For really showing us the way  
You dirty rat you Bureaucrat you  
Made us what we are today  
Come and get it Herb
