You give your hand to me  
Then you say hello  
I can hardly speak  
My heart is beating so  
And anyone can tell  
You think you know me well  
But you dont know me  
  
No you dont know the one  
Who dreams of you at night  
And longs to kiss your lips  
And longs to hold you tight  
Oh Im just a friend  
Thats all Ive ever been  
Cause you dont know me  
  
I never knew  
The art of making love  
Though my heart aches  
With love for you  
Afraid and shy  
Ive let my chance to go by  
The chance that you might  
Love me too  
  
You give your hand to me  
And then you say goodbye  
I watch you walk away  
Beside the lucky guy  
Youll never never know  
The one who loves you so  
Well you dont know me  
  
You give your hand to me baby  
Then you say goodbye  
I watch you walk away  
Beside the lucky guy  
No no youll never ever know  
The one who loves you so  
Well you dont know me
