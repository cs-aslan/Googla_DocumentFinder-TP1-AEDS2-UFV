The end has come and found us here  
With our toys scattered all around us here  
The puzzle that we never found an answer for  
Still asks us darlin just what all the games were for  
And here we stand in a box of sand  
Wheres the playground Susie  
  
Youre the one whos supposed to know her way around  
Wheres the playground Susie  
If I dont stay around  
If I dont stay around  
  
The carousel has stopped us here  
It twirled a time or two and then it dropped us here  
And still youre not content with something about me  
But what merrygoround can you ride without me  
To take your hand   
How would you stand  
  
Wheres the playground Susie  
If I decide to let you go and play around  
Wheres the playground Susie  
If I dont stay around  
If I dont stay around  
  
Wheres the playground Susie  
Youre the one whos supposed to know her way around  
Wheres the playground Susie  
If I decide to let you go and play around
