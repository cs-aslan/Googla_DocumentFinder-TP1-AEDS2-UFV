There is a queen of six sevens and nines  
Dust in your garden poison in your mind  
There is a king that will steal your soul  
Dont let him catch you dont let him get control

In the night in the night  
Come and ride your horse  
In the night in the night  
Come and ride your horse  
In the night in the night  
Come and ride your horse
