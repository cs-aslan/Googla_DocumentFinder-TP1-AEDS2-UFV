Youre a slave to the capitalist system  
Which is ruled by the global elite  
What happened to the individual  
What happened to the working class white  
  
They filled his head with so much propaganda  
Entertainment on tv and all kinds of shite  
What happened to the individual  
When he gave up all of his rights  
  
Tell you up is down and wrong is right  
Nothing to hang your hat on cant even get uptight  
  
Youre controlled by the media  
Everything you say and do  
What happened to the individual  
Tell me what happened to you  
Tell you up is down not able to fight  
Keep you docile and complacent cant even get uptight  
Controlled by the media and you dont know what you can do  
They took away your constitution you dont even know what happened to you  
  
Waffle is the language that they taught you taught you to talk  
But you cant even get any angle cause you forgot how keep on walking the
walk  
  
Youre a slave to the capitalist system and its controlled by the global
elite  
Double dealing with the banks behind your back just cant fight
