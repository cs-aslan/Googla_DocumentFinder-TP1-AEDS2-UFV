She is trapped inside a month of grey  
And they take a little every day  
She is a victim of her own responses  
Shackled to a heart that wants to settle  
And then runs away  
Its a sin to be fading endlessly  
Yeah but shes alright with me  
  
She is leaving on a walkaway  
She is leaving me in disarray  
In the absence of a place to be  
She stands there looking back at me  
Hesitates and then turns away  
Shell change so suddenly  
Shes just like mercury  
Yeah but shes alright with me  
  
Keep some sorrow in your hearts and minds  
For the things that die before their time  
For the restlessly abandoned homes  
The tired and weary ramblers bones  
And stay beside me where I lie  
Shes entwined in me  
Crazy as can be  
Yeah but shes alright with me
