Grey skies clouding up the things we used to see with wide eyes  
Maybe everything was meant to be this way  
Will it ever change  
But are we stuck here on our own  
  
Chorus  
Its all gone grey  
Its all gone grey  
  
I found telling you the truth the hardest thing to get out  
I know it wasnt you that made me feel this way  
Will it ever change  
Or are we stuck here on our own  
  
And give it one more try  
I dont know if I would stay  
I feel so much better now  
And baby begging me  
Will leave you so empty inside  
So you shouldnt even try  
  
I know every last regret inside of me is my own  
The way I hold them close has made me be this way  
I will never change  
I know Im stuck here on my own on my own  
  
Given one more try  
I dont know if I would stay  
I feel so much better now  
Where did we go wrong  
I know you still hold on to me  
But its time that you let go  
I gave you things I had  
That I could not get back again  
But Im better off alone  
  
Chorus  
Its all gone grey  
Its all gone grey  
Its all gone grey  
Its all gone grey
