Midnight on the water  
I saw the oceans daughter  
Walking on a wave she came  
Staring as she called my name  
  
And I cant get it out of my head  
No I cant get it out of my head  
Now my old world is gone for dead  
Cause I cant get it out of my head  
  
Breakdown on the shoreline  
Cant move its an ebbtide  
Morning dont get here tonight  
Searching for her silver light  
  
And I cant get it out of my head  
No I cant get it out of my head  
Now my old world is gone for dead  
Cause I cant get it out of my head  
  
Bank job in the city  
Robin Hood and William Tell  
And Ivanhoe and Lancelot  
They dont envy me  
Sitting til the sun goes down  
In dreams the world keeps going round and round  
  
And I cant get it out of my head  
No I cant get it out of my head  
Now my old world is gone for dead  
Cause I cant get it out of my head
