I did something stupid  
Not too long ago  
I broke a heart and then he left me  
That was hard to swallow  
Listened to a lot of Hank Williams  
Singin Cheating Heart  
That record use to make me wanna dance  
  
Well I didnt know what those cheating songs meant  
Back when my friends and I were singing em out loud  
Yeah I didnt know what they meant back then  
But I do now  
  
Yeah I thought I found a new love  
At the bottom of a glass  
He told me to tell the whole dang world  
To go ahead and kiss my ass  
Thank God for Merle Haggard  
Hes right The Bottle Let Me Down  
That record use to make me wanna dance  
  
Well I didnt know what those cheating songs meant  
Back when my friends and I were singing em out loud  
Yeah I didnt know what they meant back then  
But I do now  
  
Oh now I found the one that matters  
The man Im never letting go  
Im alive more than Ive ever been  
Freer than Ive ever known  
Yeah I always did believe the Chicks  
A Cowboy Would Take Me Away  
That record always makes me wanna dance  
  
Yeah I didnt know what those love songs meant  
Back when my friends and I were singing em out loud  
Yeah I didnt know what those love songs meant  
But I do yeah I do now Oh I do now  
Oh I do now
