There is a wind my Billy and its awful strong  
Come for you and anyone whos helped you along  
  
But I want to live live live and let the stars shine bright  
Yes I want to live live live and let it on alright  
  
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall  
I dont want to fight it Billy cause I want to go  
  
Theres a Northern wind Billy blowin up a southern change  
And a Northern wind really makin me feel kinda strange  
Theres a Northern wind Billy blowin up a southern change  
And a Northern wind really makin me feel kinda strange  
  
And with this gun goes everything I want to say  
Not for you but for anyone who takes it away  
Let it fill his life life life until theres nothing left  
Let it kill his wife wife wife until he goes to bed  
  
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall  
I dont want to fight it Billy cause I want to go  
  
Theres a Northern wind Billy blowin up a southern change  
And a Northern wind really makin me feel kinda strange  
Theres a Northern wind Billy blowin up a southern change  
And a Northern wind really makin me feel kinda strange
