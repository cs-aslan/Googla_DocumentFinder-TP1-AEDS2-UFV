Theres no time to wallow in my cheer  
Tis mine to make my life a better place for my song  
Near my blues will be gone  
Bracing my joy till june  
Theres no time to bellow hardships done  
The devil knows Ive cried but the tears turn to plans  
Drafting thoughts work at hand  
Leaving woes behind  
Theres no time  
Theres no time  
People Im just a pupil  
Learning the facts from A to Z  
And maybe come tomorrow  
Ill be what I can be  
Theres no time to follow friends and fools  
Tis wine that makes a man the bitter bliss of his day  
Reminiscing foolish times when hes grey  
Lord let me save my mind  
Theres no time  
Theres no time
