Paint them a picture Jane  
And you can hang it on the wall  
Tell them its me they see  
Dont tell them why Im small  
  
If they ask you why Im crying  
Just tell them someone is dying  
And that he was just a friend  
Dont let em see that you pretend  
Paint them a picture Jane  
Put it in a frame  
One with lots of colors  
Sign it with your name  
Sign your name  
Sign your name  
  
Paint them a picture Jane  
Like the one you painted for me  
Tell them that Im in love  
But dont tell them they will see  
If they ask you why Im crying  
Just tell them someone is dying  
And that he was just a friend  
Dont let em see that you pretend  
Paint them a picture Jane  
Put it in a frame  
One with lots of colors  
Sign it with your name  
Sign your name  
Sign your name
