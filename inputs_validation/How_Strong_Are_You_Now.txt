Verse 1  
When she told you goodbye you didnt flinch  
When she looked back you didnt even budge an inch  
You stood there like a stone but now thats shes gone  
  
Chorus  
How strong are you now without her around  
You cant even keep one little bitty tear from falling down  
Tell me how strong are you now  
  
Verse 2  
Before she left you told yourself it cant hurt that much  
Now your double over like you took a punch  
No she aint coming back tell me how much can you take of that  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
Whats that rule that you live by a tough guy never cries  
How strong are you now without her around  
You cant even keep one little bitty ear from falling down  
Tell me how strong tell me how strong are you now  
How strong are you now oh whats that rule you live by  
You say tough guys never cry how strong are you now
