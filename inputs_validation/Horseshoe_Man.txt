In the land of the broken hearted  
People lookin for the horseshoe man  
Theyve been picking up little pieces  
Theyve been puttin em all in his hand  
  
And the way the story started  
Two lovers long ago  
Took a vow to live with heart break  
Took a chance but how could they know love  
  
How could they know love  
Love how could they know love  
  
Horseshoe mans been working his magic  
Fixin heart break everywhere  
Hes the one we all can count on  
When were lost and dont know where love is  
  
He takes the pieces in his hand  
And shakes em up like he doesnt care  
He says there will always be heart break  
Because love is everywhere  
  
Love I dont know about love  
Love I dont know  
  
Love dont care if youre wrong or right  
Love dont know if youre black or white  
Love aint lookin for perfection  
Loves the answer  
Loves the question  
  
Love I dont know about love  
Love I dont know  
Love I dont know about love  
Love I dont know about love
