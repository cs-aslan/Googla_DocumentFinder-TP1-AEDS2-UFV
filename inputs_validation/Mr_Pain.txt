Met my first love down in Texas  
In a club in San Anton  
Both of us were lonely  
Had no one to call our own  
So we danced and laughed til closin time  
And had no place to go  
So with the top pulled down drove all night  
Run off to Mexico  
But my blond haired blue eyed cowboy  
Turned out to be bad news  
Disappeared one morning  
Left his old boots and the blues  
Now theres been so many others  
But none of them were true  
The only one I could count on  
To keep me company is you  
  
Chorus  
Mr Pain oh its you again  
Never really wanted us to be such friends  
You always seem to show up  
When Im all alone  
Thats when you move right in  
And make yourself at home  
Mr Pain Oh Mr Pain  
  
Well youd think by now that Id have learned  
To see through your disguise  
A heartache really shouldnt be  
So hard to recognize  
But you wear so many face  
Every line is new  
And somehow I just always end up  
Wakin up with you  
  
Mr Pain oh its you again  
Never really wanted us to be such friends  
Never fail to find when Im all alone  
Thats when you move right in  
And make yourself at home oh Mr Pain
