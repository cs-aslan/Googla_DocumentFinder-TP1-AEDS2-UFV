Ive this creeping suspicion  
That things here are not as they seem  
Reassure me  
Of why do I feel as if Im in too deep  
Now Ive been praying  
For some way to show them Im not what they see  
Yes I have done wrong  
But what I did I thought needed be done  
I swear  
  
Chorus  
Oh unholy day  
If I leave now I might get away  
Oh bu this weighs on me  
As heavy as stone an as blue as I go  
  
I was just wondering if youd come along  
Hold up my head when my head wont hold on  
Ill do the same if the sames what you want  
If not Ill go  
I will go a  
  
long way  
From that fools mistake  
and now forever pain  
Go run I will run and Ill be ok  
  
Chorus  
  
long way  
To bury the past for I dont want to pay  
Oh how I wish this  
To turn back the clock and do over again  
  
Chorus  
  
I need do  
To stay in your arms see you smile hold you close  
And now it weighs on me  
As heavy as stone and a bonechilling cold  
  
I was just wondering if youd come along  
Tell me you will
