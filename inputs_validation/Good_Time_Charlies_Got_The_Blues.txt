Everybodys gone away said theyre moving to LA  
Theres not a soul I know around everybodys leavin town  
Some caught a freight some caught a plane find the sunshine leave the rain  
They said this townll waste your time I guess theyre right its wastin mine  
Some gotta win some gotta lose good time Charlies got the blues  
Good time Charlies got the blues  
  
You know my heart keeps telling me youre not a kid at thirtythree  
You play around you lose your wife you play too long you lose your life  
I got my pills to ease the pain cant find a thing to ease the rain  
Id love to try and settle down but everybodys leavin town  
Some gotta win some gotta lose good time Charlies got the blues  
Good time Charlies got the blues
