Could it be just that Im crazy  
Could it be the way I feel this time of year  
When a certain situation seems to bring the best out of me  
I dont care  
  
When shes standing close beside me  
Something turns inside me  
Brings my senses to the point of no return  
  
And I dont know what it is but I love  
And I dont know what it is but I want it to stay  
And I love it  
  
And it seems to be around me  
Even though noone can see  
They seem to care  
When a certain situation seems to bring the best out of me  
I dont care  
  
When shes standing close beside me  
Something turns inside me  
Brings my senses to the point of no return  
  
And I dont know what it is but I love  
And I dont know what it is but I want it to stay  
And I love it
