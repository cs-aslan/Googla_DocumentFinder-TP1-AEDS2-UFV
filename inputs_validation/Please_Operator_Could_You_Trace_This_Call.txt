Chorus  
Please operator could you trace this call  
Find out where Im drinking  
Which dirty beer hall  
And send a cab driver to call for me here  
No need to describe me  
Cause I aint all here  
  
She told me to get lost  
And thats what I did  
But Ive done it so well  
I dont know where I hid  
And she swore that she never will see me again  
Hell Ill never find me  
In the shape that Im in  
  
Chorus  
  
Now I had to ask myself  
If I were me  
And I was out drinking  
Well where would I be  
Then I thumb nailed the label  
And there I appeared  
Hiding out in a bottle  
Behind a threeday old beard  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I may be lonely  
But Im never alone  
Cause Ive been beside myself  
Since shes been gone  
  
Oh please operator could you trace this call  
Find out where Im drinking  
Which dirty beer hall  
And send a cab driver to call for me here  
And if he can find me  
Ill buy him a beer  
  
Please operator could you trace this call  
Find out where Im drinking  
Which filthy beer hall  
And send a cab driver to call for me here  
Ill be beside myself  
Pouring down beer
