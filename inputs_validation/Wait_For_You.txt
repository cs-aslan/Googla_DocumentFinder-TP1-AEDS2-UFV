I never felt nothing in the world like this before  
Now Im missing you and Im wishing  
You would come back through my door  
Why did you have to go  
  
You could have let me know so now Im all alone  
Boy you could have stayed but you wouldnt give me a chance  
With you not around its a little bit more than I can stand  
And all my tears they keep runnin down my face  
Why did you turn away  
  
So why does your pride make you run and hide  
Are you that afraid of me  
But I know its a lie what you keep inside  
This is not how you want it to be  
  
So baby I will wait for you  
Cause I dont know what else I can do  
Dont tell me I ran out of time  
If it takes the rest of my life  
  
Baby I will wait for you  
If you think I find it just aint true  
I really need you in my life  
No matter what I have to do  
Ill wait for you  
  
Been a long time since you called me  
How could you forget about me  
You gotta be feeling crazy  
How can you walk away  
When  
Everything stays the same  
I just cant do it baby  
  
What will it take to make you come back  
Boy I told you what it is and it just aint like that  
Why cant you look at me  
Youre still in love with me  
Dont leave me crying  
  
Baby why cant we just start all over again  
Get it back to the way it was  
If you give me a chance I can love you right  
But youre telling me it wont be enough  
  
So baby I will wait for you  
Cause I dont know what else I can do  
Dont tell me I ran out of time  
If it takes the rest of my life  
  
Baby I will wait for you  
If you think I find it just aint true  
I really need you in my life  
No matter what I have to do  
Ill wait for you  
  
So why does your pride make you run and hide  
Are you that afraid of me  
But I know its a lie what youre keeping inside  
That is not how you want it to be  
  
Baby I will wait for you  
Baby I will wait for you  
If its the last thing I do  
  
Baby I will wait for you  
Cause I dont know what else I can do  
Dont tell me I ran out of time  
If it takes the rest of my life  
  
Baby I will wait for you  
If you think I find it just aint true  
I really need you in my life  
No matter what I have to do  
Ill wait for you  
Ill be waiting
