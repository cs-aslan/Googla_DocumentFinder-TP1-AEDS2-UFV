Well Im going away to live  
Wont be back no more  
Going back down south child  
Lord now dont you worry ma  
  
Woman Im trouble  
Trouble and all worried mind  
Well I just cant be satisfied  
Just cant keep on crying  
  
Well I feel like snapping  
Pistol in your face  
Going to let some graveyard  
Lord be your resting place  
  
Woman Im trouble  
Trouble and all worried mind  
Yeah i just cant be satisfied  
Just cant keep on crying

Hear my doorbell ring  
Looking for my baby  
Lord seen a doggone thing  
  
Woman Im trouble  
Trouble and all worried mind  
Yeah I just cant be satisfied  
Just cant keep on crying  
  
Yeah I know my little old babe  
She gonna jump and shout  
That old train be late man  
Lord I come walkin out  
  
Woman Im trouble  
Trouble and all worried mind  
Yeah I just cant be satisfied  
Just cant keep on crying
