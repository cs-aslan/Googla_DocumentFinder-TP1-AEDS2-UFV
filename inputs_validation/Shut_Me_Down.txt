May not be what you think you want  
I dont fit your mold of perfection  
You see me break so many hearts  
Which explains your constant rejection  
  
But I know when its real  
And I wanna show you girl  
But every time that I try  
Shut me down shut me down  
Shut me down down down ohh  
You shut me down down down ohh  
Shut me down down down ohh  
You shut me down down down ohh  
  
For what its worth Im in love with you  
Said for what its worth Im in love with you  
For what its worth Im in love with you  
Said for what its worth Im in love with you ohh  
  
You believe that Im messing round  
That it cant be real what Im saying What Im sayin  
But Ive never felt what I feel right now  
So believe me girl I aint playing  
  
Cause I know when its real  
And I wanna show you girl  
But every time that I try  
Shut me down shut me down  
You shut me down down down ohh  
You shut me down down down ohh  
Shut me down down down ohh  
You shut me down down down ohh  
  
For what its worth Im in love with you  
Said for what its worth Im in love with you  
For what its worth Im in love with you ohh  
Said for what its worth Im in love with you ohh  
  
Ohh  
  
But I know when its real  
And I wanna show you girl  
But every time that I try  
Shut me down shut me down  
You shut me down down down ohh  
You shut me down down down ohh  
You shut me down down down ohh  
You shut me down down down ohh  
  
For what its worth Im in love with you  
Said for what its worth Im in love with you Im in love with you  
For what its worth Im in love with you  
Said for what its worth Im in love with you  
  
For what its worth Im in love with you  
Said for what its worth Im in love with you ohh
