Steamboat waiting by the waterside  
Sunlight shining on the morning tide  
Got my ticket in my hand  
Got some celebrating planned  
  
Cant remember when I felt so fine  
Ive been waiting such a long long time  
Just to hear those engines hum  
Look out dreamboat here I come  
  
And I say dream on dreamboat let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
All aboard make it fast  
Thank the lord Im coming home at last  
  
If you love me like you did before  
Be there waiting on the distant shore  
When my steamboat comes inside  
Then I know well be alright  
  
And I say dream on dreamboat let your love light ride  
Stem on steamboat to the other side  
Turn the crank change the gear  
Raise the flag and lets get out of here  
  
Feels so good to know that soon Ill see  
Youve been saving all your love for me  
For honey if theres any doubt  
Just be sure I dont find out  
  
And I say dream on dreamboat let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
Cast the line check the fuse  
save some time this aint no pleasure cruise  
  
Tell the captain not to take too long  
Keep that big wheel turning fast and strong  
Fires are burning down below  
Come on steamboat dont be slow  
  
And I say dream on dreamboat let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
Wind the springs set the course  
Pull some strings before I turn to force  
  
Dream on dreamboat let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
Ring the bell sound the horn  
Move like hell Im heading back where I was born  
  
And I say dream on dreamboat let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
All aboard and make it fast  
Thank the lord Im coming home at last  
  
And I say dream on dreamboat let your love light ride  
Stem on steamboat to the other side  
Turn the crank change the gear  
Raise the flag and lets get out of here  
  
Dream on dreamboat let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
Cast the line check the fuse  
save some time this aint no pleasure cruise  
  
Youre me dreamboat yes you are  
And I say dream on dreamboat let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
Ring the bell sound the horn  
Move like hell Im heading back where I was born  
  
Youre my dreamboat yes you are
