Many days have faded away and the time has passed  
Those were memories that have been by so fast  
I cant see you  
I cant hear you  
But I feel you  
  
I would find you  
I would find you  
Well I would find you  
I would find you  
I would find you  
  
Now that we know that weve been there and the time is running out  
That message was from the Lord without a doubt  
I cant see you  
I cant hear you  
But I feel you  
  
Could it be that I feel so all alone  
Its you thats driving me mad  
You wont leave me alone  
  
You have touched my soul  
You have touched my soul  
Now hear me  
  
Could it be that you feel so all alone  
If its me thats driving you mad  
Oh I would leave you alone  
Oh yes I would
