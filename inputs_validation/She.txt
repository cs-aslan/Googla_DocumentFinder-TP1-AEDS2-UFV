Verse 1  
She puts her spirit in a nightcap  
She always knows where the crowds at  
She puts her mouth round the cigarette  
I put it out cause she likes that  
She always dance when its raining  
Hey whens it startin baby  
She looks at me like shes waiting  
Making time go slow when they show her the table  
  
PreChorus  
Bright lights but shes fading  
Feels right shes crazy  
Bright lights but shes fading  
Feels right shes crazy  
  
Chorus  
She wants somebody to love to hold her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way  
She wants somebody to love to kiss her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way

Shes crying out that she loves me  
Holding my hands so I wont leave  
Cause baby dont wanna be lonely  
She says I just want you to hold me

Bright lights but shes fading  
Feels right shes crazy

She wants somebody to love in the right way
