Its your chance take her hand to the floor when I walk to the floor  
Girl if you see something you like then let him know  
Cause you only got one chance for your first dance  
Yeah you never forget your first dance  
So take advantage of the slow dance  
  
When I close my eyes I see me and you at the prom  
Weve both been waiting so long  
For this day to come  
Now that its here lets make it special  
I cant deny  
Theres so many thoughts in my mind  
The DJs playing my favorite song aint no chaperons this could be  
The night of our dreams  
  
Only if you give give the first dance to me  
Girl I promise Ill be gentle I know we gotta do it slowly  
If you give give your first dance to me  
Im gonna cherish every moment  
It only happens once once in a life time  
  
I couldnt ask for more were rockin back and forth  
Under the disco ball were the only ones on the floor  
I cant deny so many thoughts in my mind  
The DJs playing my favorite song now were all alone heres the opportunity  
  
Only if you give give the first dance to me  
Girl I promise Ill be gentle I know we gotta do it slowly  
If you give give your first dance to me  
Im gonna cherish every moment  
It only happens once once in a lifetime  
  
Everybody says that we look cute together lets make this a night  
The two us remember no teachers around to see us dancin close  
Im tellin you our parents will never know  
Before the lights go up and the music turns off  
Nows the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss  
Your glass slippers in my hand right here well  
Make it before the clock strikes nine  
  
If you just give give the first dance to me  
Girl I promise Ill be gentle but we gotta do it slowly  
If you give give the first dance to me well cherish every moment  
It only happens once once in a lifetime  
  
Girl if you see something you like then let him know  
Cause you only got one chance for your first dance  
Yeah you never forget your first dance  
So take advantage of the slow dance  
  
If you give give the first dance to me  
Im gonna cherish every moment  
Cause it only happens once in a lifetime
