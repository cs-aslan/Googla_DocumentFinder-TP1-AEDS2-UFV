Every day is an endless dream  
Of traffic lights and gasoline  
Watching as the world passes me by  
All my friends have gone away  
Leaving empty strangers in their place  
The empty fills me up sometimes  
  
I am only waiting  
For someone to break my heart  
I am only waiting for someone  
Ive got these words that Ive been saving  
For a song that I cant start  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart  
  
Every nights the same to me  
Alcohol and scripted scenes and looking  
For some answers I wont find  
A hundred different shades of gray  
A million miles and nothing seems to change  
I aint changed in such a long time  
  
I am only waiting  
For someone to break my heart  
I am only waiting for someone  
Ive got these words that Ive been saving  
For a song that I cant start  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart  
  
I am only waiting  
For someone to break my heart  
I am only waiting for someone  
Ive got these words that Ive been saving  
For a song that I cant start  
While I am waiting  
For someone to break my heart
