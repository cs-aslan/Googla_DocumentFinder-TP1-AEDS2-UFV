Let me tell you about a girl I know  
Had a drink about a hour ago  
Sitting in a corner by herself in a bar in downtown hell  
  
She heard a noise and she looked through the door  
And saw a man shed never seen before  
Light skin light blue eyes a doublechin and a plastic smile  
Well her heart raced as he walked in the door  
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar  
My brand new car is parked right outside  
Howd ya like to go for a ride  
And she said Wait a minute I have to think  
He said Thats fine May I please buy you a drink  
One drink turned into three or four and they left and got into his car  
And they drove away someplace real far  
  
Now babe the time has come  
Howd ya like to have a little fun  
And she said If we could only please be on our way I will not run  
  
Thats when things got out of control  
She didnt want to he had his way  
She said Lets go  
He said No way  
Come on babe its your lucky day  
Shut your mouth were gonna do it my way  
Come on baby dont be afraid  
If it wasnt for date rape Id never get laid  
  
He finished up and he started the car  
He turned around and drove back to the bar  
He said Now baby dont be sad in my opinion you werent halfbad  
She picked up a rockthrew it at the car hit him in the head now hes got a
big scar  
Come on party people wont you listen to me  
Date rape stylee  
  
The next day she went to her drawer look up her local attorney at law  
Went to the phone and filed the police report and then she took the guys ass
to court  
Well the day he stood in front of the judge he screamed She lies that
little slut  
The judge knew that he was full of shit and he gave him twenty five years  
And now his eyes are full of tears  
One night in jail it was getting late  
He was buttraped by a large inmate and he screamed  
But the guards paid no attention to his cries  
  
Thats when things got out of control  
The moral of the date rape story it does not pay to be drunk and horny  
But thats the way it had to be  
They locked him up and threw away the key  
Well I cant take pity on men of his kind  
Even though he now takes it in the behind  
  
But thats the way it had to be  
They locked him up and threw away the key  
Well I cant take pity on men of his kind  
Even though he now takes it in the behind  
Date rape  
  
She didnt want to she didnt want to she didnt want to she didnt want to  
Take it
