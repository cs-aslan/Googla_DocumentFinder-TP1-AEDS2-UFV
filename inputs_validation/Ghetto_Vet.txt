Life  
Niggas used to come and get me  
When it was time to disagree with an enemy  
Pass the Hennessy it gives me energy  
Packed the gat in the small of my back  
Where these niggas at I clear the whole pack  
Talkin shit cause Im down for my set Im a vet  
Smokin on a wet cigarette  
who these niggas think they are  
wishin on a ghetto star I represent my tar  
I start bustin and they scatter like water bugs  
cause these westside niggas is harder thugs  
Enslave us but nothin can save us from sportin Ben Davis  
Shootin at your neighbors  
cause sometimes I feel like a nut dont give a fuck when I open ya up  
Hot rocks fly from the back seat and  
Busta ass niggas run like a track meet  
An if you crawl in the middle bleed mo dinner little what  
Killer king is the hospital  
Feelin numb from the bullets I hum  
And when they hit black mothers have fits I dont give a shit  
  
Fool Im a vet you can bet that  
I could dance underwater and not get wet check it  
Its rainin bullets and Im still there  
  
For life Im still there  
My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass  
Up early in the morning takin out the trash  
Feelin like a loser alcohol abuser  
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser  
One on the peddles the other on the handle bars what  
Tryin be ghetto stars they said  
Are you from the west side is it so  
I said hell yea and who want to to know me  
In slow mo fo fo slugs face down in the mud  
Puddle full of blood left for dead  
The pain starts to spread now I cant feel my legs  
I meet doctor who at King Drew medical center  
As I enter I see you  
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital  
I said I cant move my legs he said dont try to  
Now this aint the end my friend but youll probably never walk again  
I sit there motionless holdin this pain inside contemplating suicide  
At night I jerk and jerk  
But my dick dont work it dont even hurt damn  
Now whod ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube  
I be pissin through a tube fool Im a vet  
  
Fool Im a vet you can bet that  
I could dance underwater and not get wet check it  
Its rainin bullets and Im still there  
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair  
  
Fuck a VA they need GA  
Gang hospital for a crippal now Im drinkin rippal  
Same corner same hood Im still there  
With bandannas tied to my wheel chair  
To all the hood rat hoes Im fine  
They mad cause my tongue get tired  
Now everybody want to put they dope on me  
Sayin I wont get searched by the LAPD  
Im sitting on a doorway duece five  
Dependin on neck to keep my ass alive  
I dont got folks but my arms about a one six  
My fuckin legs lookin like tooth picks  
Some times I cant deal got to beg the be Gs to roll me up the hill  
Put me on the porch now Im on the torch smokin cocaine  
Just to maintain nothin to gain nutin to lose  
And last night I couldnt make it to the bathroom  
Feelin like a two year old you cant get a sip from the brew I hold  
Nigga its the only friend to a stranger AKA handicap gang banger  
Theres a lot in my life I regret becomin a ghetto vet  
Fool Im a Vet  
  
Repeat x2  
Fool Im a vet you can bet that  
I could dance underwater and not get wet check it  
Its rainin bullets and Im still there  
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair  
  
Life  
Yea  
Life  
Yea  
Life  
Life  
Dedicated to all the ghetto vets  
For every nigga that done took one for the hood
