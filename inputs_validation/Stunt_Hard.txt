Chorus  
I did it all on my own  
Turned a chair to a throne  
Im a king in this world  
Stunt hard  
I put my whole city on  
To some things that they never wouldve known  
If I didnt  
Stunt hard  
And every night is a premiere  
If I ever disappear  
Best believe Im comin back  
Stunt hard  
Got rich went broke and got rich again  
On that same shit again  
All I ever do is  
Stunt hard  
  
Drake  
I tell her  
Im getting motherfuckin busy  
So many spins my records is motherfuckin dizzy  
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like Who Is He  
But I bet a million she tell you thats motherfuckin Drizzy  
And Im focused on my survival  
Keep an eye on the door focus on my arrival  
Who do you look up to when youre better then your idols  
And how you posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed  
Im everything you just havent become  
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasnt been done  
Now hopefully let them see  
What they say that Im gon be  
And if not our whole future does in the memory of me  
Get your team in order assembly is key  
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea  
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be  
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty  
Pick a lane pick a lane Thats all I ever heard  
But Im just trying to swerve  
Without hitting the curb  
Thats why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them  
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them  
I am not them I Photoshop them out  
Cause they dont understand what Im about  
Yeah  
The Chris Paul  
Of this fall  
Sittin this tall  
I float high  
Goodbye  
I will miss yall  
  
Chorus  
  
Lil Wayne  
If I dont do nothin Imma stunt my ass off  
Money sittin in the pocket bout to get a passoff  
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off  
And I got them beach bitches like David Hasselhoff  
Baby Im an acrobat Sweetie Im a stunt devil  
You cant get on my level cause I am so unleveled  
Im a young rebel  
And I got a baby face

Chorus  
  
Nutt Da Kid

Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans

And I go hard and I dunk like Vince Carter

Dont he look like a black grizzly in that black fur  
And the feds will never get me  
Like a backwards

Ask her
