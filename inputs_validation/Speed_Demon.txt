Im headed for the border  
Its on my mind  
And nothin really matters  
Ive got to be on time  
Look in the view mirror  
Is he hot on my tracks  
Is he getting nearer  
I feel some heat is on my back  
  
Chorus  
Speed demon  
Speedin on the freeway  
Gotta get a lead way  
Speed demon  
Doin it on the highway  
Gotta have it my way  
Speed demon  
Mind is like a compass  
Im stoppin at nothin  
Speed demon  
He say Pull over boy and get your ticket right  
  
And nothin gonna stop me  
Aint no stop and go  
Im speedin on the midway  
I gotta really burn this road  
  
Chorus  
  
Speed demon youre the very same one  
Who said the futures in your hands  
The life you save could be your own  
Youre preachin bout my life like youre the law  
Gonna live each day and hour like  
For me theres no tomorrow  
  
Go Go Go Aaow  
  
Chorus
