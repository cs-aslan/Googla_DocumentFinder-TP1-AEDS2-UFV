Im alive and I can breath the air  
I can hurt you  
I can float up here  
so soft and tingling  
You cant catch me  
Im floating away  
  
I woke up  
And went down next door  
Im getting up with nothing on my mind  
I went down the stairs  
With a pain in my head  
I should have never got out of bed  
  
Then everything shattered  
Just at the point that mattered Repeat x 2  
Aha  
  
Im alive I can breath the air  
I can hurt you  
I can fall down there  
Right into you your mind  
Dont put it around  
You cant catch me  
And carried away  
  
I woke up I woke up every day  
Theres nothing nothing to say  
Half way down the stairs  
I feel a pain in my chest  
I should never have got out of bed  
  
Then everything shattered  
Just at the point that it mattered Repeat x 2  
Aha  
  
Im alive Im can breath the air  
I can hurt you  
Half way down the stairs  
I get a pain in my chest  
I should never got out of bed  
  
I should never ever ever  
I should never
