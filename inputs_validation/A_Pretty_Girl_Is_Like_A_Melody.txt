I have an ear for muSic and I have an eye for A maid  
I like A pretTy girlIe with each pretTy tune thats played  
  
They go toGethEr like sunNy weathEr goes with the month of may  
  
Ive studIed girls and muSic so Im qualIFied to say  
  
Chorus  
  
A pretTy girl is like A melODy that haunts you night and day  
  
Just like the strain of A hauntIng reFrain  
  
Shell start upOn A marAThon and run ARound your brain  
  
You cant es cape shes in your memORy By mornIng night and noon  
  
She will leave you and then come back AGain  
  
A pretTy girl is just like A pretTy tune
