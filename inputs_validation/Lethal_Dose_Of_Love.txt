Wild thing  
  
Shouldve known better  
With a girl like you  
You satisfied my every need  
What a little heartbreaker  
You turned out to be  
Prettiest face Ive ever seen  
Oh dance little sister you turn me on  
You make my blood run hot  
Killer legs in that short black dress  
Baby you was born to rock  
  
I dont mind you foolin me around  
Just dont let me out of your jail  
I dont mind you messin me up  
I tell all my friends  
Its a lethal dose of love  
  
Lethal dose of love watch out  
Lethal dose of love  
Lethal dose of love  
Lethal dose of love  
  
Should ve know better  
With a girl like you  
Youre totally misunderstood  
I hear them talkin  
In this one horse town  
You scandalize the neighborhood  
My family was shocked by your  
The color of your lips and hair  
Even my brother hes a God fearin man  
Poor boy had to sit and stare  
  
I dont mind you foolin me around  
Just dont let me out of your jail  
I dont mind you messin me up  
I tell all my friends  
Its a lethal dose of love  
  
Lethal dose of love  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Lethal dose of love  
Lethal dose of love  
  
I hear the clickin  
Of your heels on the stairs  
You dont talk and I dont ask  
What a little difference  
Some eyeliner makes  
Tomorrow youll be back in class  
Although my blueprint for happiness  
Depends on you  
Ill cook and clean and be your slave  
Ill tie you up but I wont tie you down  
Baby I might even shave  
  
I dont mind you foolin me around  
Just dont let me out of your jail  
I dont mind you messin me up  
I tell all my friends  
Its a lethal dose of love  
  
Lethal dose of love
