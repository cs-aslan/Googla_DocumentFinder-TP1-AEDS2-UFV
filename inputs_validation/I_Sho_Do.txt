You took my love and ran away  
What did you expect me to say  
I gave you everything I could  
But you werent giving up baby  
What you should  
I Sho doNeed You  
I Sho DoWant You  
Im in need of what youve got  
It makes my blood boiling hot  
You told me baby A long time ago  
That youd never ever leave me  
Never no more  
I Sho DoNeed You  
I Sho DoWant You  
I Sho DoWish For You  
I Sho DoWalk the Floor All Night Long  
When you see me baby standing alone  
Come and help me baby Cause Im out on my own  
You see it aint easy in the streets  
But what youve got baby could help me to my feet  
I Sho DoNeed You  
I Sho DoWant You  
I Sho DoWish For You  
I Sho DoWalk the Floor All  
Night Long
