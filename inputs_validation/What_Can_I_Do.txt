My man done left me on a midnight train  
He said he wasnt thinking of ever coming back again  
He told me he wanted me to find somebody else  
He done left me here all by myself  
Tell me  
  
What can I do  
What Im still in love with you  
Tell me what can I do  
What Im still in love with you baby  
  
When it first started it was all good  
The things you done to me I never thought that you would  
Didnt give me a reason why it had to end  
I cant believe you left me for another ladyfriend  
  
You know Ive been searching for someone  
Who could share that special love with me  
  
I thought you was the one I gave my trust to you  
Im such a fool I want you back  
Tell me what am I to do  
  
What can I do  
What Im still in love with you  
Tell me what can I do  
What Im still in love with you baby  
  
Im sitting by the phone all alone  
Tell me what can I do tell me tell me  
  
What can I do  
What Im still in love with you  
Tell me what can I do  
What Im still in love with you baby  
What can I do  
What Im still in love with you  
Tell me what can I do  
What Im still in love with you baby
