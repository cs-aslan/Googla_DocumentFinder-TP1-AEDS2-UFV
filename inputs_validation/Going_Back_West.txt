I was born and raised in the ghetto  
Talk with me and youll know  
I wasnt satisfied with living on the side  
I started looking around for a possibility  
  
Listen to my story of what became of me  
I met a businessman  
Who said he had some friends back east  
So why dont you come along  
Well we can help you at least  
Well make you into a big star  
By playing your guitar  
But the joke was on me  
They left me flat to see  
  
Going back west  
Yes I know Ill make out alright  
Going back west  
Where my musics playing all night  
Going back west going back west  
I think Ill do alright  
  
Going back west  
Yes I know Ill make out alright  
Going back west  
Where my musics playing all night  
Going back west going back west  
I think Ill do alright  
  
Struggling for recognition identity and respect  
I got a lot of promises  
They told me not to fret  
So we will stand by you  
If the going gets rough  
But when I started thinking  
They didnt even bluff  
  
Bout a year has come and gone  
And left me standing here  
Thinking how it could have been  
For still I aint nowhere  
They surely took me for a ride  
Trampled on my pride  
But I hold my head up high  
Got no more tears to cry  
  
Going back west  
Yes I know Ill make out alright  
Going back west  
Where my musics playing all night  
Going back west going back west  
I think Ill do alright  
  
Going back west  
Yes I know Ill make out alright  
Going back west  
Where my musics playing all night  
Going back west going back west  
I think Ill do alright  
  
Going back west  
Yes I know Ill make out alright  
Going back west  
Where my musics playing all night
