You cant believe what you see Its individuality  
This world has made me who I am  
But you cant comprehend  
So you blindly consume their lies  
  
Evil wears a great disguise  
You have you no conscience man  
This is what made me who I am  
  
The social damage  
Controls your thoughts  
No minds of your own  
So you blindly march  
  
Live like this till the end  
Your lives Ill never understand  
I know I came from nothing  
Your all irrelevant to me  
  
And I dont want your help  
I hope you burn in hell  
Live by your own rules dont pretend  
Yeah zombies blindly follow trends  
  
Cant you see yourself  
Just like everyone else  
Cant you see yourself  
Just like everyone else  
  
Youre trapped inside this mirror  
Nobody wants to break out  
Break out  
  
Someone tell me whos controlling all these marionettes
