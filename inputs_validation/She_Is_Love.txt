Oh when the sunshine beckons to ya  
And your wings begin to unfold  
The thoughts you bring and the songs you sing  
Are gonna keep me from the cold  
  
And if the sword is here among ya  
And its words may wound my soul  
You can fill me up with what youve got  
cause my hearts been keeping old  
  
She is love  
And her ways are high and steep  
She is love  
And I believe her when she speaks  
Love  
And her ways are high and steep  
She is love  
And I believe I do believe her when she speaks  
  
Youre in all my thoughts of passion  
And the dreams of my delight  
Whatever stirs my mortal frame  
Will you keep it warm at night  
  
I dont know where you come from  
No I havent got a clue  
All I know is Im in love  
With someone who loves me too  
  
She is love  
And her ways are high and steep  
She is love  
And I believe her when she speaks  
Love  
And her ways are high and steep  
She is love  
And I believe I do believe her when she speaks  
  
She is love  
And her ways are high and steep  
She is love  
And I believe her when she speaks  
She is love  
And her ways are high and steep  
She is love  
And I believe I do believe her when she speaks  
I do believe her when she speaks  
I do believe her when she speaks  
I do believe her when she speaks
