Its four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Woke up the wanting in me  
Wishing Id never met her knowing if Id forget her  
How much better off she would be  
The longer that I hold on and the longer that it goes on the harder that its
gonna be  
Its four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
Ive never deserved her God knows when I hurt her  
Thats the last thing I wanna do  
She knows but she cant tell how she feels but I know  
Too well what shes going through  
And if I love her so much I dont know why I cant do  
The right thing and just let her be  
Its four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
Last night I told her this time its all over  
Making ten times I told her goodbye  
Last night we broke up this morning I woke up  
And for the tenth time Im changing my mind  
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her than most foolish men will ever
see  
Its four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
Four in the morning once more the dawning just woke up the wanting in me
