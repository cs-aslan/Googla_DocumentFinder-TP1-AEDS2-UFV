Yo Turn that click off  
  
My music is soothing  
But its also been provin  
That it can put you in the mood to  
Jump out your car while its movin  
You been waitin on this moment  
My sermon is like a omen  
Im servin Im Erick Sermon  
I saw the window was open  
And I jumped through it  
My shit if you dont get pumped to it  
I quit heres my rhyme book  
Go ahead and thumb through it  
And pick what you want from it  
Rummage and find something  
You can use to jump someone  
And roll up bumpin  
Im constantly copin over you  
Squattin shit has gotten to the point  
Where I aint even writin no more Im just jottin  
This is chicken scratch shit is sickenin  
Ive been kickin ass off bullshit  
Throwaway rhymes pick a batch  
I live for the love of rap you crazy  
Ive made beats for JayZ for free  
Page me you need a beat you Cannabis  
Then its Dres fee you Kay Slay the fees waved  
I stay beefin with jd till the day Dre 2ways me  
That its okay to stop blazin him  
Oops I put it out I apologize now  
Its too late G its on tape  
And the tape leaped Say What You Say mothafucka  
Drama King Kay Slay mothafucka We dictate these mixtapes mothafucka  
Xzibit blaze little gay midget cocksucka
