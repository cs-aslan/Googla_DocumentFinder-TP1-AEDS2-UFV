You only hold me up like this  
Cause you dont know who I really am  
Sometimes I just want to know what its like to be you  
Were making out inside crashed cars  
Were sleeping through all our memories  
I used to waste my time dreaming of being alive now I only waste my time
dreaming of you  
  
Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness  
All of our moves make up for the silence  
And oh the way your makeup stains my pillowcase  
Like Ill never be the same  
  
Ive got headaches and bad luck but they couldnt touch you  
Im not trying  
You only hold me up like this
