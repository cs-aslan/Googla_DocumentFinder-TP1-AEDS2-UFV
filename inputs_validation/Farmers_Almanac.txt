Well the farmer prayed for a better year  
And the crops were good like the Lord did hear  
But his barn burned down with winter near  
The answer came in white and black  
In the farmers almanac it says  
If a man could have half his wishes he could double his trouble  
  
A sweet old lady was eightyfour  
When her kinfolks came for a month or more  
Now from overwork shes on the other shore  
Much too late was yall come back  
And it says in the farmers almanac it says  
Visitors and fish smell after three days  
  
Our leader was a silver tongued man  
He deceived the people of the land  
And when he got caught he couldnt stand  
Its a little offbeat and a little offtrack  
But it says in the farmers almanac it says  
In rivers and bad government the lightest things flow to the top  
  
Rod said I dont believe in God  
Rod died and lies beneath the sod  
For God did not believe in Rod  
Life is a troubled and a weary track  
But it says in the farmers almanac it says  
Feed your faith and your doubts will starve to death  
  
The little boy followed the honeybee  
And it flew straight to the honey tree  
He got stung but got the honey free  
Consolation for the things you lack  
Is in the farmers almanac it says  
God gives us the darkness so we can see the stars  
  
He came home three hours late from work  
Said I had a flat and fell in the dirt  
She said You gotten lipstick on your shirt  
Well it turned out like Jill and Jack  
And it says in the farmers almanac it says  
Lies have to be covered up truth can run around naked  
  
He said Honey you know Im true  
I just look at other women thats all I do  
Then she caught him with her best friend Peggy Sue  
Sometimes some women will look back  
And it says in the farmers almanac it says  
Theres a lot of difference in window shoppin and shop liftin  
  
I sat down at a shoeshine stand  
I had a real slow shoeshine man  
I said you dont pop that rag like some of em can  
He looked at me and then he sat right back  
It says in the farmers almanac it says  
The trouble with the world today is  
Theres too much poppin and not enough shinin
