Listen closely hear the music playing  
Let it take you to places far away and  
Relax your senses just do what you want to do  
No need for questions

And its so amazing  
Oh how you cant escape it  
The moment takes you  
And never lets you go  
  
Cant you feel the music in the air  
Close your eyes let the rhythm take you there  
Doesnt matter who you are or where youre from  
Come and dance to the music of the sun  
Forget about your troubles its alright  
Let them go til we see the morning light  
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one  
Come and dance to the music of the sun the sun

Cant explain the feeling  
Like the sunlight brings the life new meaning  
No need for stress no need for stress  
Save that for another day
