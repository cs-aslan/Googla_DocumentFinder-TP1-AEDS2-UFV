ChorusRepeat x2  
Shout  
Shout  
Let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
Come on  
Im talking to you  
Come on  
  
In violent times  
You shouldnt have to sell your soul  
In black and white  
They really really ought to know  
Those one track minds  
That took you for a working boy  
Kiss them goodbye  
You shouldnt have to jump for joy  
You shouldnt have to shout for joy  
  
Chorus  
  
They gave you life  
And in return you gave them hell  
As cold as ice  
I hope we live to tell the tale  
I hope we live to tell the tale  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
And when youve taken down your guard  
If I could change your mind  
Id really love to break your heart  
Id really love to break your heart  
  
Chorus
