Gimme a hand there Michael  
Ill give you a hand then too  
Gimme a hand there Michael  
Id give you my heart if I could  
  
Throw myself at the ground  
Look away before I hit  
  
Give me a lift here Larry  
Ill give you a lift here too  
Give me a lift here Larry  
Id give you my horse if I could  
  
Throw myself at the ground  
Look away before I hit  
  
Gimme a kiss there Tuesday  
Ill give you a kiss there too  
Ill give you a kiss there Tuesday  
Id give you my heart  
Id give you my heart if I could  
  
Throw myself at the ground  
Look away before I hit
