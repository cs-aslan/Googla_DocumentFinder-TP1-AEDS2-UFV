If your the girl that I know this the rest of this line is unclear  
Than your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk  
If your the chick I saw in the tall grass looking at someone through tinted
blue glass than your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk  
  
Cause Ive never been this close before to someone who didnt seem to mind
Ive never found hellos before Ive only found goodbyes  
If your the girl I met in my daydreams handing out flowers and chocolate ice
cream than your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk  
If your the girl that I talked to and said do you mind if I love you than
your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk  
  
Cause Ive never been this close before to someone who didnt run and hide
Ive never found hellos before Ive only found goodbyes  
If your the girl I met in my daydreams handing out flowers and chocolate ice
cream than your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk  
If your the girl that I talked to and said do you mind if I love you than
your more than welcome to my share of the sidewalk
