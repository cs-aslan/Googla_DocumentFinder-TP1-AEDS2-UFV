On golden wings  
She flies at night  
With her dress  
Its blinding white  
Countless diamonds  
And her long blonde hair  
The queen is coming  
So you better be aware  
Her plums and flowers  
Theyre never the same  
Blue and silver  
Its all her game  
Flying dragons  
And enchanted woods  
She decides she creates  
Its her reality  
  
In her world of dreams and make believe  
She reigns forever  
With all her glory  
  
Unicorns appear in her sight  
The fireflies lead her trough these woods at night  
In search of the legendary amulet  
And its secret  
In the big oak there is a door  
Which will lead her  
To the wizard shore  
And shell ask him  
For the wind to sail her home  
To the world where she belongs  
  
In her world of dreams and make believe  
She reigns forever  
With all her glory  
In this world of endless fantasy  
She makes it happen  
Its her reality  
  
In her world of dreams and make believe  
She reigns forever  
With all her glory  
In this world of endless fantasy  
She makes it happen  
Its her reality
