Jesus walked upon the earth  
On the shores of Galilee  
Hed say to His disciples  
Let the little children come to me  
I wonder if up in heaven  
Do you suppose well see  
Little children asking  
What was I supposed to be  
Chorus  
What was I supposed to be  
What were my eyes supposed to see  
And why did I taste of death  
Before I even drew a breath  
Laid my head at my mothers breast  
To sleep  
Oh Jesus  
Chorus  
Was I to be a prophet  
Used in the ministry  
A doctor who would find a cure  
For some terrible disease  
Even if Id been born imperfect  
Why couldnt my parents see  
That Id have been made perfect  
When you came back for me  
Oh Jesus  
Chorus  
Oh Jesus what was I supposed to be  
Oh Jesus what was I supposed to be
