Is this just a matter of  
Me getting what I needed  
Till I was safe upon the other side  
Of the international dateline  
And its just a matter of  
Me keeping myself seated  
Till the pilot killed the overdrive  
And landed in a place where you cant  
Find me there  
Find me there  
  
When you hold one chance  
And you break your hands  
When the secrets safe  
And you call my name  
Then I am gone  
  
Im tired of you and me tired of you and me  
And the space thats in between space thats in between  
And I would rather be somewhere with better thoughts and warmer air  
Im tired of trying to be tired of trying to be  
Somebody different than me different than me  
Im tired of trying to shine it on  
When the lights go out tonight Im gone  
Ill run from here  
Run  
  
When you hold one chance  
And you break your hands  
When the secrets safe  
And you call my name  
When the hurt gets real  
And you still cant feel  
When you cant escape  
And you cannot stay  
Then I am gone  
  
Safe upon the other side  
Of the international dateline  
I landed in a place that you cant find  
You cant find me there  
You cant find me there  
  
When you hold one chance  
And you break your hands  
When the secrets safe  
And you call my name  
When the hurt gets real the hurt gets real  
And you still cant feel still cant feel  
When you cant escape cant escape  
And you cannot stay  
Then I am gone  
  
Safe upon the other side  
Of the international dateline  
I landed in a place that you cant find  
  
When the last plane leaves  
And you cry for me  
When you lie awake  
And you feel it break  
Then I am gone
