Its snowing angels on my front porch  
Take a broom and sweep one in  
Im such a lucky guy such a lucky guy  
Even though my shoes have broken  
I cant deny my toes  
The right to fresh air  
And the joy of poking through  
Its snowing angels  
Hope Ill catch me one  
  
Its snowing angels  
By my window  
Take a net and fish one in  
Im such a lucky guy such a lucky guy  
Even though I got no money  
This bear wont be hibernating  
Or Id miss the sight of all the honey strolling by  
Its snowing angels  
Hope Ill catch me one  
  
Im such a lucky guy such a lucky guy  
Even though my shoes have broken  
I cant deny my toes  
The right to fresh air  
And the joy of poking through  
Its snowing angels  
Hope Ill catch me  
Hope Ill catch me  
Hope Ill catch me one
