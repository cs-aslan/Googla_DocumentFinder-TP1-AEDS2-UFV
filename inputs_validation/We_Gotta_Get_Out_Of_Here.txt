Its such a small town rodeo  
Such famous people here with nowhere to go  
Well it dont get to me i think its the pits  
I got no friends i want to split  
  
The daily papers seek a desperate face  
The television cameras join in the chase  
Its much fun interviewing urban decay  
I grab the microphone away  
  
dance no dance no dance no dance no  
We gotta get out of here  
We gotta get out of here right now  
We gotta get out of here  
We gotta get out of here right now  
  
Hey rock and roll feel the holes in my brain  
I promise you ill never come here again  
Its all so sad what a waste of a night  
Cause nothings wrong but nothings right hey  
  
So dont get along out of my way  
Im not a robot ive got something to say  
Its such a joke are you ready to go  
Here comes that beat again oh oh oh oh  
  
dance no dance no dance no dance no  
We gotta get out of here  
We gotta get out of here right now  
We gotta get out of here  
We gotta get out of here right now  
We gotta get out of we gotta get out  
We gotta get out of here right now  
We gotta get out of we gotta get out  
We gotta get out of here right now  
repeat while ellen speaks

Come on cant you do anything i want to do  
Lets dance come on please just once for me  
I never get to do anything like this  
Youre such a drag you know that  
Everything for you everything for you nothing for me right  
What are we gonna do go home and watch the super bowl  
Reruns of the mohammed ali uh marlene dietrich fight what  
There must be somebody here who wants to dance with me  
There must be a lot of people here who would like to dance with me you know  
That  
Come on one two three four  ill jump right up and do the bump come
on  
  
Listen this place gets really good this place gets really  
I heard that the that the the spoon comes down and the moon comes down and  
The stars and all sorts of great stuff happens in a little while
