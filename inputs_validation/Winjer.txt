Stay there  
Im having a whinge  
A winjer  
Today  
Today  
I could be a diamond  
I brought anything  
On a winjer  
Having a whinge  
Everything  
Everything looks miserable  
When youre the winjer  
Opinion in the house a flame  
When youre the winjer  
Im having a laugh  
Im having a laugh  
With the roof off and the sunlit  
Take your top off  
Take your  
Take your top off  
You look happy now  
You look happy now  
No spikes  
Having a laugh  
Warm grass around you  
Warm grass around you  
Warm grass around you  
On a winjer  
Today could be a diamond  
I could be a diamond  
About anything  
Everything looks miserable  
When youre the winjer  
Im Im Im  
Im having a laugh  
With the roof off  
And the sunlit  
Take your top off  
Take your top off  
Bird in the hall moonlight  
Follows the road  
Warm grass around you  
Warm grass around you  
Stay there
