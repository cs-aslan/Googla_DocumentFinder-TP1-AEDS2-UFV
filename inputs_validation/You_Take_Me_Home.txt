I was blinded by the city lights  
LA livin up the crazy life  
Lookin back on how far Id come  
Not quite sure what I was runnin from  
  
A million miles away from the world I knew  
Whod ever thought itd lead me back to you  
  
Chorus  
You take me to front porch swings  
Mama singin Cheatin Heart  
Yeah what a rush  
Catchin lightnin bugs in a mason jar  
  
You take me to county fairs  
Bedtime prayers  
Old wooden rockin chairs  
And all the things I loved I thought were gone  
You take me home  
You take me home  
  
Took awhile to finally come around  
And separate all that was lost and found  
If theres one thing by now I better know  
The grass aint greener where it doesnt grow  
  
I needed someone who would love me like you do  
To lead me back to the simple truth  
  
Chorus  
  
Summer heat  
Lifes so sweet  
And dancin on daddys feet  
And all the things I loved I thought were gone  
You take me home  
You take me home  
You take me home
