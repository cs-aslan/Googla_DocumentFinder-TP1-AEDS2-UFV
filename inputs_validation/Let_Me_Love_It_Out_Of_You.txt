I know youre mad  
And Im to blame for that  
Yes Im sorry again  
For the things I did the words I said  
If I could Id take it back  
Why waste the wine in this glass  
The love in this room  
To making up girl  
Were so good at that  
  
Come on over sit back down by me  
Let me have it take it out on me  
Dont hold back take your time  
Until you forgive me  
Turn down the lights lock the door  
Leave out leavin on the floor  
I know youre angry inside  
Let me love it out of you tonight  
  
I see that smile  
Youre tryin so hard to have  
Who youre tryin to fool  
I know your game I know you girl  
Damn youre sexy when youre playin it cool  
Why waste the wine in this glass  
The love in this room  
To making up girl  
Were so good at that  
  
Come on over sit back down by me  
Let me have it take it out on me  
Dont hold back take your time  
Until you forgive me  
Turn down the lights lock the door  
Leave out leavin on the floor  
I know youre angry inside  
Let me love it out of you tonight  
  
Why waste the wine in this glass  
The love in this room  
To making up girl  
Were so good at that  
  
Come on over sit back down by me  
Let me have it take it out on me  
Dont hold back take your time  
Until you forgive me  
Turn down the lights lock the door  
Leave out leavin on the floor  
I know youre angry inside  
Let me love it out of you tonight  
  
Let me have it let me have it take your time  
Let me lay you down and hold you close  
And tell you how much I need you  
Let me have it let me have it
