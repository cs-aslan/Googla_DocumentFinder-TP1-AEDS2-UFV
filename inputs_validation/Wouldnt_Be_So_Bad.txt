Take me back to Anona street  
Fill my glass again  
With a bittersweet  
Cause I dont wanna see  
The life I have  
Thought the next time around  
Wouldnt be so bad  
  
Same mistake that I made before  
Ill be waking up  
On the kinlin floor  
While the bells are ringing  
So low and sad  
Thought the next time around  
Wouldnt be so bad  
  
Same mistake that I made before  
Ill be waking up  
On the kinlin floor  
I remember how  
I made you mad  
Thought the next time around  
Wouldnt be so bad  
  
I Thought the next time around  
Wouldnt be so bad  
Thought the next time around  
Wouldnt be so bad
