The hills are full of secrets  
Owls watch by night  
Down in town the bars are full  
And the drunks are picking fights  
These are things I know  
But the facts are filtered through  
All the ways I want you  
All the ways I want you  
  
219 freight train  
Moaning somewhere near  
I see you in the distance  
But I cant get there from here  
Hard to believe its happening  
But my whole worlds shrunken to  
All the ways I want you  
All the ways I want you  
  
Stars look down and laugh at me  
I ought to take a bow  
Dont have to tell them lifes hard sometimes  
Theres one falling now  
Nobodys here beside me  
I can talk about it to  
All the ways I want you  
All the ways I want you  
All the ways I want you
