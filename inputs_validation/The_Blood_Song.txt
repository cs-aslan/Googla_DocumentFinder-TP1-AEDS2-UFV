So many different religions  
And so many different churches  
And if God really loves me  
Then why does life keep hurting me  
Have you ever asked any of these questions  
Well my friend Ive got the answer just listen  
  
You have the power  
To make the seasons change  
The river flows for you  
The wind whispers Your name  
For me you left Your throne  
And traded crown for thorns instead  
Im safe within not by Your skin  
But because Your blood was red  
  
Some say Youre black youre white  
They question if youre real  
We treat you like we treat ourselves  
I wonder how you feel  
To see your children fight in spite  
of the tears for us youve shed  
Doesnt matter what color you are  
As long as your blood was red  
  
For its strong enough to wash away my sins  
And its pure enough to cleanse me deep within  
And its real enough to find me when Im lost  
Great enough to die upon the cross  
It doesnt matter what color you are  
As long as your blood was red  
  
We may be different but  
The God we serves the same  
Yet every Sunday we separate  
And bring the Father pain  
Your name is higher than any other  
Yet You took my place instead  
And now my sins are washed away  
Because Your blood was red  
  
For its strong enough to wash away my sins  
And its pure enough to cleanse me deep within  
And its real enough to find me when Im lost  
Great enough to die upon the cross  
It doesnt matter what color you are  
As long as your blood was red  
  
Oh precious is the flow  
That makes me white as snow  
No other fount I know  
Doesnt matter what color you are  
As long as your blood was red  
Doesnt matter what color you are  
As you are as long as your blood was red  
Doesnt matter what color I am  
As long as my blood was red
