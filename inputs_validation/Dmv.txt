Ive been to hell I spell it I spell it DMV  
Anyone thats been there knows precisely what I mean  
Stood there and Ive waited and choked back the urge to scream  
And if I had my druthers Id screw a chimpanzeecall it pointless  
  
When I need relief I spell it THC  
perhaps you may know vaguely what I mean  
I sit back and smoke away huge chunks of memory  
As I slowly inflict upon myself a full lobotomycall it pointless  
  
Barbecues tea kettles gobs of axle grease  
There comes a time for every man to sail the seas of cheese  
Now lifes a bowl of bagel dogs but there are unpleasantries  
Cold toilet seats dentist chairs and trips to DMVcall it pointless  
  
Ive been to hell I spell it I spell it DMV  
Anyone thats been there knows precisely what I mean  
Ive stood in line and waited near an hour and fifteen  
And if I had my druthers Id screw that chimpanzeecall it pointless
