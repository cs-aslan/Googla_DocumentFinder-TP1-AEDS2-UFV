Have you seen me I just might be your little baby  
Have you seen me Im lookin at you with grown up eyes  
Every milk carton and highway billboard sign says maybe  
Have you seen me or have you only seen my disguise  
  
I had a fight with mama and she said she couldnt stand me  
I had a fight with papa and he really likes to swing his fist  
Im sick and tired of all those stupid rules they hand me  
They try to make me feel I have no right to exist  
  
Have you seen me well Ive seen you  
Ive seen what the grown ups do  
Ive seen I can do that too  
Have you seen me  
  
Well Im older now than I was the day I vanished  
You might not even know me if you saw me passin by  
Others take your place in the dark world of the banished  
On vicious streets where no one hears me cry  
  
Well you cant run you cant hide  
turn your face walk inside  
Cant close your doors because Im yours  
Have you seen me  
  
Well Im fighting in Nicaragua Im fighting in Afghanistan  
In Israel I wear a gun in Palestine a rock is in my hand  
In Africa you see me starve in America they just throw me away  
But Im making history that other kids will read about some day  
  
Have you seen me well Ive seen you  
Ive seen what the grown ups do  
Ive seen I can do that too  
Have you seen me  
Have you seen me  
Have you seen me  
Have you seen me
