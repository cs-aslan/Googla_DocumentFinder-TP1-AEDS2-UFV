All at once  
I finally took a moment  
And Im realizing that  
Youre not coming back  
And its finally hit me all at once  
All at once Ive started counting teardrops  
And at least a million fell  
My eyes began to swell  
And all my dreams were shattered all at once  
  
Ever since I met you  
Youre the only love Ive known  
And I cant forget you  
Though I must face it all alone  
  
Chorus  
All at once Im drifting on a lonely sea  
Wishing youd come back to me  
And thats all that matters now  
All at once Im drifting on a lonely sea  
Holding on to memories  
And its hurt me more than you know  
So much more than it shows  
All at once  
  
I looked around and found that you were  
With another love  
In someone elses arms  
And all my dreams were shattered all at once  
All at once the smile that used to greet me  
Brightened someone elses day  
She took your smile away  
And left me with just memories all at once  
  
Ever since I met you  
Youre the only love Ive known  
And I cant forget you  
Though I must face it all alone  
  
Chorus x2
