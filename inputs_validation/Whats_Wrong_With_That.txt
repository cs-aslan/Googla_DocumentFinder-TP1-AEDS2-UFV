I may be rotten to the core  
And stop me if you think I am  
A kid in a candy store  
The same as any dirty old man  
I know Im not the first to see  
I guarantee Im not the last  
  
So take some good advice from me  
Just try it once before you ask  
I hear an enticing voice  
Live it up live it up do it now boy  
I dont like the other choice  
Live it up live it up  
  
Chorus  
Whats wrong with that  
Whats wrong with the fountain of youth  
Whats wrong with that  
Whats wrong with a little self delusion  
  
Who you think is foolin who  
And who will be the last to laugh  
Heres another lame excuse  
Youre old enough to be her dad  
Ive heard all the reasons why  
Give it up give it up take a powder  
I turn them my blindest eye  
Give it up give it up  
  
Chorus  
  
Whats wrong with that  
Whats wrong with a flower in bloom  
Whats wrong with that  
Whats wrong with a little self delusion  
  
Days dont hide secrets of the heart  
Only you and I do  
Little white lies rip you right apart  
And any way they want to  
Life goes by done before you start  
I cant wait around to satisfy you  
  
Chorus
