Love is a stranger  
In an open car  
To tempt you in  
And drive you far away  
  
Chorus  
And I want you  
And I want you  
And I want you so  
Its an obsession  
  
Love is a danger  
Of a different kind  
To take you away  
And leave you far behind  
And love love love  
Is a dangerous drug  
You have to receive it  
And you still cant  
Get enough of the stuff  
  
Its savage and its cruel  
And it shines like destruction  
Comes in like the flood  
And it seems like religion  
Its noble and its brutal  
It distorts and deranges  
And it wrenches you up  
And youre left like a zombie  
  
Chorus  
  
Its guilt edged  
Glamorous and sleek by design  
You know its jealous by nature  
False and unkind  
Its hard and restrained  
And its totally cool  
It touches and it teases  
As you stumble in the debris  
  
Chorus
