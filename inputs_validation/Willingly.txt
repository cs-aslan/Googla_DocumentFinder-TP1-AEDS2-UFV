When I was just just a young boy  
My mama said to me  
Dont fall in love willingly  
  
Now that is all forgotten  
Unwilling memory  
  
But if you change your mind  
I will walk the line  
Ill follow  
Willingly  
  
We used to talk about it  
But now it seems the wind has blown your way  
And I have come to doubt it  
That you and I will ever love again  
  
Cause good enough is one thing  
That I will never be  
And I admit it all  
Willingly  
  
And now the times are changing  
The things Ive seen before dont look the same  
My life is rearranging  
But falls apart with whispers of your name  
  
And though I swear to love you  
With all sincerity  
Ill slowly fade away  
  
Willingly  
  
The sun is on my shoulders  
Perhaps its colder for Ive lost some pride  
Or maybe its the absence  
Of all the joy I felt right by your side  
  
And when the storm was over  
I found your memory  
And I will hold it warm  
Willingly
