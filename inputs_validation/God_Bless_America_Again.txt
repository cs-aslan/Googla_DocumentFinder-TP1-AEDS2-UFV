God bless America again  
You see all the troubles that shes in  
Wash her pretty face dry her eyes  
And then God bless America again  
  
God I sure do wish Youd bless America again  
You know like You did way back when it all began  
You blessed her then but we just sorta kinda take it for granted  
And never did ask again  
  
So God just hold her hand thats all  
And if she should stumble please dont let her fall  
  
God bless America again  
You see all the troubles that shes in  
Wash her pretty face dry her eyes  
And then God bless America again  
  
You know I dont understand to everythin Im readin here  
About whats wrong with America  
And if You dont have a lotta good learnin  
I guess theres a lotta things You dont understand  
  
But let me say this God shes like a mother to me  
And though all I am or ever hope to be I owe to You and to her  
Wash her pretty face dry her eyes  
And then God bless America again
