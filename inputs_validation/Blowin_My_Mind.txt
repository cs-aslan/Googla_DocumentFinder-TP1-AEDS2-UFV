Coolin in the shade  
Sippin on lemonade  
I hear a knowck on the door who is it  
Kim comin to pay me another visit  
She tells me that Im on her mind  
And a player like me is very hard to find  
I like the way she licks her lips starin in my eyes  
I must admit shes got some juicy thighs  
I like the way she wears her hair and the tight skirts fit  
Thats why I got her in my mix  
All she wants to do is hit the sheets and keep it goin  
Thats why Im mind blowin  
  
Mind blowin blowin my mind  
  
Ten minutes past I got my eyes on her ugh  
Shes shaped like an hour glass  
I like the red lipstick she took a Popsicle out  
And put it in her mouth quick  
She whispered in my ear saying those things that only  
A mac would like to hear  
You see I like a girl that really turns me on  
Twist with her walk and sexy on the telephone  
She tells me she dreams of me she wants to be with me  
And not another memory  
But for now we can hit the sheets baby  
And keep it goin now Im mind blowin  
  
Now the heat is on my fingers still in her hair  
Now shes reaching for my underwear  
Im thinking I should make her wait  
For another day oh I forget sherris on the way  
Off came the top shes looking in my eyes  
Here we go with the big surprise  
I guess I cant resist it hands all over my body  
As she puckered up and kissed  
Uh off came the pumps Im checkin out the rump  
Shes got a lotta junk in her trunk  
And finally we hit the sheets and kept it goin  
Now Im mind blowin
