Give Me Your Hand  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
I was climbing up a mountain  
Headed for the top  
My feet started sliding  
And I almost fell off  
I landed on a rocky ledge  
Suspended in the air  
And I cried out in despair  
I said Is anybody out there  
Anybody there at all  
Then I saw Him reaching down  
And I heard Him call  
chorus  
Give me your hand Ill lift you up  
Dont be afraid  
You just have to trust  
I have been there in the place you stand  
Theres no need to fear  
Thats why Im here  
Give me your hand  
How can I repay you  
You truly saved my life  
The Savior smiled  
And He said Thats alright  
Tomorrow when youre climbing  
Look around you on the way  
There are many others to be saved  
Crying Is anybody out there  
Anybody there at all  
Reach out to them remember me and call  
chorus repeat  
Theres no need to fear  
Thats why Im here  
Give me your hand  
Theres no need to fear  
Thats why Im here  
Give me your hand
