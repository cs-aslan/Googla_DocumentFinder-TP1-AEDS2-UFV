Little man youre cryin I know why youre blue  
Someone took your kiddycar away  
Better go to sleep now  
Little man youve had a busy day  
  
Johnny won your marbles tell you what well do  
Dad will get you new ones right away  
Better go to sleep now  
Little man youve had a busy day  
  
Youve been playin soldier the battle has been won  
The enemy is out of sight  
Come along there soldier put away your gun  
The war is over for tonight  
  
Time to stop your schemin time your day was through  
Cant you hear the bugle softly say  
Time you should be dreamin  
Little man youve had a busy day  
  
Time you should be dreamin  
Little man youve had a busy day
