Nor the pain and the sorrow caused by my mistakes  
Wont repent to a mortal whom is all to blame  
Now I know I wont make it  
There will be a time well get back our freedom  
They cant break whats inside  
  
Ill face it cause its the heart of everything  
  
Open up your eyes  
Save yourself from fading away now dont let it go  
Open up your eyes  
See what youve become dont sacrifice  
Its truly the heart of everything  
  
Open up your eyes open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes its the heart of everything  
Open up your eyes open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes open up your eyes  
  
Stay with me now Im facing my last solemn hour  
Very soon Ill embrace you on the other side  
Hear the crowd in the distance screaming out my faith  
Now their voices are fading I can feel no more pain  
  
Ill face it cause its the heart of everything  
  
Open up your eyes  
Save yourself from fading away now dont let it go  
Open up your eyes  
See what youve become dont sacrifice  
Its truly the heart of everything  
  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes  
Save yourself from fading away now dont let it go  
Open up your eyes  
See what youve become dont sacrifice  
Its truly the heart of everything
