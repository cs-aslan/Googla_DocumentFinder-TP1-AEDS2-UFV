Verse 1  
Its always been a mystery to me  
How two hearts can come together  
And love can last forever  
But now that I have found you I believe  
That a miracle has come  
When God sends the perfect one  
Now gone are all my questions about why  
And Ive never been so sure of anything in my life  
  
Chorus  
I wonder what God was thinking  
When He created you  
I wonder if He knew everything I would need  
Because He made all my dreams come true  
When God made you  
He must have been thinking about me  
  
Verse 2  
I promise that wherever you may go  
Wherever life may lead you  
With all my heart Ill be there too  
From this moment I want you to know  
Ill let nothing come between us  
And I will love the ones you love  
Now gone are all my question about why  
And Ive never been so sure of anything in my life  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Bridge  
He made the sun He made the moon  
To harmonize in perfect tune  
One cant move without the other  
They just have to be together  
And that is why I know its true  
Youre for me and Im for you  
Cause my world just cant be right  
Without you in my life  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Tag  
He mustve heard every prayer Ive been praying  
Yes He knew everything I would need  
When God made you  
When dreams come true  
When God made you  
He mustve been thinking about me
