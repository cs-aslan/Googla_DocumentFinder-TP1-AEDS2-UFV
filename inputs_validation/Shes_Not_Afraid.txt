She sneaks out in the middle of the night yeah  
Tight dress with the top cut low  
Shes addicted to feeling of letting go oh ohoo let it go  
  
She walks in and the room just lights up  
But she dont want anyone to know  
That Im the only one who gets to take her home oh ohoo  
Take her home  
  
But everytime I tell her that I want more  
She closes the door  
  
Shes not afraid of all the attention  
Shes not afraid of running wild  
How come shes so afraid of falling in love  
Shes not afraid of scary movies  
She likes the way we kiss in the dark  
But shes so afraid of fffalling in love  
Ohoo  
  
Maybe shes just trying to test me  
Wanna see how hard Im gonna work  
Wanna see if I can really tell how much shes worth  
What your worth  
  
Or maybe all her friends have told her  
Dont get closer hell just break your heart  
  
But either way shes teasing me  
And its just so hard So hard  
  
Cause every time I tell her how I feel  
She says its not real  
  
Shes not afraid of all the attention  
Shes not afraid of running wild  
How come shes so afraid of falling in love  
Shes not afraid of scary movies  
She likes the way we kiss in the dark  
But shes so afraid of fffalling in love  
Ohoo  
  
What about all the things we said  
Talking on the phone so late  
I cant let her get away from me Ohh  
  
When I say that I cant do it no more  
Shes back in my door  
  
Shes not afraid of all the attention  
Shes not afraid of running wild  
How come shes so afraid of falling in love  
Shes not afraid of scary movies  
She likes the way we kiss in the dark  
But shes so afraid of fffalling in love Ohoo ohoo  
Shes not afraid  
Shes not afraid Ohoo ohoo
