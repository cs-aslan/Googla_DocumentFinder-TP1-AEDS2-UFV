I hit the highway and I checked the time  
I see the sunrise and it makes me want to change my mind  
Oh I got it bad  
I stopped for a coffee in a nowhere town  
A pretty waitress says Hey whats the frown  
Boy you got it bad  
Well so many times you told me before  
If you dont like it well theres the door  
This time Ive gone for good and I got it bad  
  
I got it badder than a broken heart  
Badder then the devils smile  
And I cant face bein apart  
I guess Ill have to leave but meanwhile  
Oh I got it bad  
  
Moonlight on the water still looks the same  
Pretty girl beside me but I dont know her name  
Guess I got it bad  
Im too weak to say no too lonely to care  
Ill believe her if she says hey baby  
I got to love to spare  
Well tomorrow Ill take it like a man  
Tonight Im taking all I can  
This time I went for good and I got it bad  
  
I got it badder than a broken heart  
Badder then the devils smile  
And I cant face bein apart  
I guess Ill have to leave but meanwhile  
Oh I got it bad  
  
I got it badder than a broken heart  
Badder then the devils smile  
And I cant face bein apart  
I guess Ill have to leave but meanwhile  
Oh I got it bad  
  
I got it badder than a broken heart  
Badder then the devils smile  
And I cant face bein apart  
I guess Ill have to leave but meanwhile  
Oh I got it bad
