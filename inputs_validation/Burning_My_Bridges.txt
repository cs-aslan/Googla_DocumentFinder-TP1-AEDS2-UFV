Well you hoot and you holler and you make me mad  
And Ive always been under your heel  
Holy christ what a lousy deal  
Now Im sick and tired of your tedious ways  
And I aint gonna take it no more  
Oh no no  walkin out that door  
  
Burning my bridges cutting my tie  
Once again I wanna look into the eye  
Being myself  
Counting my pride  
No unright neighbours gonna take me for a ride  
Burning my bridges  
Moving at last  
Girl Im leaving and Im burying the past  
Gonna have peace now  
You can be free  
No one here will make a sucker out of me
