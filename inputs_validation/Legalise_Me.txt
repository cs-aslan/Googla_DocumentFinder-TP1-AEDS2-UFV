Legalize me  
Oh I want the legal right to be me  
Only me  
Legalize me  
Bail me jail me  
But theyre never gonna nail me  
Pharmaceutically  
  
I was sleeping like a baby in bed  
When I woke up  
To a voice in my head  
Were all outta rooms  
Try down the road is what I said  
Im just a farmer  
And I grow marijuana  
  
Oh baby doll  
Can yo tell that I like that  
Oh baby doll  
Were gonna rattle your combinations  
Up and down  
  
Legalize me  
Oh I gotta gotta gotta feel free  
Really free  
Legalize me  
Wake me shake me  
If theyre gonna come and take me  
Make it legally  
  
I been campaigning for  
The rights of the meek  
Ive been holed up  
In a tree most the week  
Hey sir your crush boxes  
Are starting to leak  
Theyre saying never  
But well wait here  
Forever and ever and ever and ever  
  
Oh baby doll  
Can yo tell that I like that  
Oh baby doll  
Were gonna rattle your combinations  
Up and down  
  
And if I want to shake my hair  
In the sun  
Dont try to flail me  
For offending anyone  
I dont take Prozac  
And Ill never own a gun  
Im just a farmer  
But I swear Id never harm her  
  
Oh baby doll  
Can yo tell that I like that  
Oh baby doll  
Were gonna rattle your combinations  
Up and down
