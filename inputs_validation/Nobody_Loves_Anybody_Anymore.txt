Nobody loves anybody anymore dear  
Nobody loves anybody anymore  
Life aint what it used to be  
Or seemed to mean before  
The moon is just the moon  
The stars are only stars  
And if it dont come easy now  
It aint worth fighting for  
Nobody loves anybody anymore dear  
  
Im back being me again  
And youre back being you  
Stronger for the loving war  
That weve been through  
We both took a look ahead  
And closed the door  
Nobody loves anybody anymore dear  
Nobody loves anybody anymore  
  
Maybe you believed in me  
And I believed in you  
Baby weve been fooled before  
Everything we ever dreamed  
Aint never ever coming true  
Nobody loves anybody anymore dear  
Nobody loves anybody anymore
