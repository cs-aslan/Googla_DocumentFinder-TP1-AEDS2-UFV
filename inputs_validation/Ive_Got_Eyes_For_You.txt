When I look at you I think many strange things  
And its hard to express all of my feelings  
I belong to a girl you hang around with  
But I must admit Ive got eyes for you  
  
I had to call and tell you just how I felt  
You should know by now that  
When youre near my heart melts  
I belong to a girl you hang around with  
But I must admit Ive got eyes for you  
  
Eyes for you eyes for you  
Yes I must admit Ive got eyes for you  
  
In my sleep I call your name  
No one to blame I cant explain  
And every time I see you its the same thing  
And I try to escape from looking your way  
I belong to a girl you hang around with  
But I must admit Ive got eyes for you  
  
Must admit Ive got eyes for you mm  
I must admit Ive got eyes for you
