Here we are in a warm embrace  
As cozy as a kitten by a fireplace  
The lights are dim with a mellow glow  
The musics playin soft n low  
  
And everythings rosy oh yea  
Comfy n cozy uh huh  
Everythings rosy yea yea  
Comfy n cozy hmm hmm hmm  
  
Lets forget the whole world outside  
Nothing else matters just you and I  
Lets unhook the old telephone  
Cause we just want to be left alone  
  
With everythings rosy yea yea yea  
Comfy n cozy uh huh huh  
Everythings rosy yea yea yea  
Comfy n cozy hmm hmm hmm hmm  
  
Wanna put another log on the fireplace  
But I cant stand leavin your embrace hmm hmm hmm hmm  
  
Baby now everythings rosy oh yeah  
Comfy n cozy uh huh  
Everythings rosy oh yeah  
Comfy n cozy uh huh  
Everythings rosy yea yea  
Comfy n cozy
