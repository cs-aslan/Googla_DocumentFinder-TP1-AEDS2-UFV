Ive been searching  
For a pot of gold  
Like the kind you find  
At the end of the rainbow  
  
Ive been dreaming  
Thought it was in vain  
Ah But now youre here  
Cant believe that youre back again  
  
Now I know I cant lose  
As long as you follow  
Im gonna win  
Im gonna beg steal or borrow  
As Long as you follow  
  
Ive been wandering  
Gone away too far  
But the road was rough  
To get back where you are  
  
And the sun went down  
Never seem to rise  
Ah but now youre here  
With the light shining in your eyes  
  
Now I know I cant lose  
As long as you follow  
Im gonna win  
Im gonna beg steal or borrow  
  
Yes I can live today  
If you give me tomorrow  
As long as you follow  
  
Now I know I cant lose  
As long as you follow  
Im gonna win  
Im gonna beg steal or borrow  
  
Yes I can live today  
If you give me tomorrow  
As long as you follow
