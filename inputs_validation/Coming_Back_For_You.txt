Looking at the same sky that we used to live under  
Are you thinking about the love that I took from us  
When you close your eyes  
Do you see me love  
Am I keeping you awake  
Whatcha scared about  
Are you giving up  
When you know you know you know  
  
You know that Im coming back for you  
Dont you worry girl  
Dont you worry girl  
You know that Im coming back for you  
Dont you worry girl  
Ill be back for you  
So you better wait up  
Keep the bed warm for me  
All  whisper on me  
Giving that love and emotion that I know  
Cause I really mind what you do  
Ill be back for you  
Coming back for you  
  
I know there are millions of miles in between our hearts  
But I will come running for you I dont care how far  
When you close your eyes  
Do you see me love  
Am I keeping you awake  
Whatcha scared about  
Are you giving up  
When you know you know you know  
  
You know that Im coming back for you  
Dont you worry girl  
Dont you worry girl  
You know that Im coming back for you  
Dont you worry girl  
Ill be back for you  
So you better wait up  
Keep the bed warm for me  
All  whisper on me  
Giving that love and emotion that I know  
Cause I really mind what you do  
Ill be back for you  
Coming back for you  
  
You know that Im coming back for you  
Dont you worry girl  
Dont you worry girl  
Im coming back for you  
Dont you worry now  
Dont you worry now  
  
You know that Im coming back for you  
Dont you worry girl  
Dont you worry girl  
You know that Im coming back for you  
Dont you worry girl  
Ill be back for you  
So you better wait up  
Keep the bed warm for me  
All  whisper on me  
Giving that love and emotion that I know  
Cause I really mind what you do  
Ill be back for you  
Coming back for you
