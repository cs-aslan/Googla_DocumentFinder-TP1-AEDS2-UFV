I dont wanna go back home  
I dont wanna kiss goodnight  
Let us paralyze this moment til it dies  
  
To the end of the earth  
Under the Valley of the Stars  
Theres a car crashing deep inside my heart  
  
Take a ride through the avenues  
Across the Great Divide  
Theres a siren screaming Im alive  
It cries  
  
Red alert is the color  
Of your paper valentines  
Intertwined on this moment passing by  
  
Take a ride through the avenues  
Across the Great Divide  
Theres a siren screaming Im alive  
It cries  
  
Red alert is the color  
Of your paper valentines  
Intertwined on this moment passing by  
  
Do you wanna be my valentine  
  
So come away with me tonight  
With cigarettes and valentines  
  
Cigarettes and valentines
