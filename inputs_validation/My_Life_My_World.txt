verse 1  
Some things money just cant buy  
From what I seen now thats a God damn lie  
Been involved in some other shit ran from the government  
Landed the mother ship thanks for the ride  
My niggaz still bang like the wrath of cain  
Fast lane smack ya bodyguard and take ya chain  
And its all in another days work for me  
I spit the truth the truth gone set yall free so  
Whats my antidrug drugs  
Antidrugs is when I cant get none for fun  
I drop flows punk the punk rappers  
Load clips for nines and clap with gun clappers  
Listen too many motherfucking cooks in ya kitchen  
Missin the most important part of life cause you bitchin  
Bitchin so much you should tuck ya nuts  
And dick between ya thighs and color your eyes  
And wax your legs and buy some bras and thongs  
And go crazy in the nightclub for sisqos songs  
You a hook motherfucker with the jordache look  
Bring lead with ya heat so the beef can cook  
chorus xzibit  
Whos sticking to the script like pistol grip  
Xzibit tradition of xcellence  
Hit em up this westside gsb  
Openbar all night drinks for free  
Victory cause we make history  
Niggaz actually have the audacity  
We the shit from the get and we set to win  
Straight hard on a bitch yall sensitive  
singing  
My life my world x to the z  
The streets done took so much from me  
Fuck what you heard this is realityyyyy  
I close my eyes and pray just to see  
Another day I live to breathe  
My life my world this is realityyyyy

verse 2  
I done had sleep for dinner natural born sinner  
Watched fiends suck crack through car antennas  
Now that we winning motherfuckers aim to get us  
The game is vicious constant hostile conditions  
For the times I dropped jewels and nobody would listen nope  
A new position got a couple of pots to piss in  
Got the aim of oswald nigga I aint missin  
If everybody eating who the fuck gone clean the kitchen  
I got vision and a real deep suspicion  
About a lot of rappers reps and they street conditions  
Everybody got bricks of yay claim they do crimes that pay  
And tell you that it paved the way bullshit  
Well only a few niggaz really came up this way  
With gunplay daytoday quick to blow you away  
Trying to sound like snoop trying to ball like dre  
I just think you mutherfuckers aint got shit to say  
chorus xzibit  
Whos sticking to the script like pistol grip  
Xzibit tradition of xcellence  
Hit em up this westside gsb  
Openbar all night drinks for free  
Victory cause we make history  
Niggaz actually have the audasity  
We the shit from the get and we set to win  
Straight hard on a bitch yall sensative  
singing
