Dont know what Im doing  dont know where Im going  
Leading me to ruin  I should have traded you in  
Yeah you think youre something but youre no good for me  
  
Dont know if I care  dont know if Im there  
I just sit and stare  making love to thin air  
Yeah youre being insulted but youre no good for me  
Na na na na na na na na no good   
  
I do lots of good  surprised at what you would  
Dont call me no crud  I really think Im good  
Yeah you think youre something but youre no good for me  
  
Try to call the tune  Ill probably go and rue it  
Ill just get it groomed  all sorts of other clues  
Yeah youre being insulted but youre no good for me  
  
I get by the local peer group and their pressures  
I can wash the dishes  my soups can taste delicious  
Yeah you think youre something but youre no good for me  
  
Ive forgotten how you feel  to me youre looking real  
Come on lets make a deal  think of where you live  
Yeah you think youre something but youre no good for me  
Na na na na na na na na no good   
  
Ive forgotten how you feel  to me youre looking real  
Come on lets make a deal  think of what you need  
Yeah youre being insulted but youre no good for me  
Yeah youre being insulted but youre no good for me
