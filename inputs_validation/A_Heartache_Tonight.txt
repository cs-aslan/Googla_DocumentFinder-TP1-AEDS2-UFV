Cant say were lovers cant say were friends  
Dont even know if ill see you again  
But against your warm body I felt so alive  
And you got me over a heartache tonight  
My heart was broken my hurt was deep  
I had lost something I wanted to keep  
Lookin for comfort when you caught my eye  
And you got me over a heartache tonight  
Chorus  
  
Sweet conversation a drink and a dance  
Led to an evening of making romance  
And I dont even care if its wrong or its right  
cause you got me over a heartache tonight  
  
2nd chorus  
  
Yes you got me over a heartache tonight  
Stirring up passion brought me back to life  
Oh and it may not last but who know it just might  
But you got me over a heartache tonight  
Yes you got me over a heartache tonight
