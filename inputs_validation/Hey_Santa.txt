If everyday was Christmas  
If we could make believe  
If everyone would give a little more  
Thered be harmony  
  
The city is covered in snow tonight  
The children are fast asleep  
Im waiting for him  
But hes no where in sight  
And I wonder if he can hear me  
  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa Santa  
I wish with all my might  
Hey Santa Santa  
Bring my baby home tonight  
  
Why does it feel like its colder than winter  
Even by the fire side  
My baby said that hed be home for Christmas  
And now its almost midnight  
  
Christmas lights up and down the street  
Are such a sight to see  
But all the presents by the tree  
They dont mean a thing til hes with me  
  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa Santa  
I wish with all my might  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa Santa  
If you hear me wont you hurry bring my baby tonight  
  
I know your sleigh is full inside  
But wont you stop and give my baby a ride  
Ill be waiting by candle light this Christmas  
Ohhh  
  
Christmas lights up and down the street  
Are such a sight to see  
But all the presents by the tree  
They dont mean a thing Santa please here me  
  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa Santa  
I wish with all my might  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa Santa  
If you hear me wont you hurry bring my baby tonight  
  
Christmas lights up and down the street  
Presents by the tree  
I hear a knock  
Oh can it be  
My wish is staring back at me  
  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa Santa  
I guess you heard me tonight yeah  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa Santa  
Im underneath the mistletoe with my baby tonight  
  
Sleigh ride sleigh ride repeat  
Its Christmas Time  
Hey Santa
