Your face is looking like  
Someone you forgot you used to know  
You were looking for rhymes and reason  
They forgot the things you used to know  
You came to rely on good fortune  
Your mothers screaming low  
With the sky in the eye  
And jump through the window  
  
Youve made your own room at the top  
Well its getting thin on air  
Still you look at me from your most expensive chair  
And when youre feeling fit to drop  
And you find theres no one there  
Still you look at me from your most expensive chair  
  
You dont wanna shout about it  
When theres nothing you care to know  
Your friends they just laugh about it  
In the places that you never go  
You cannot deny your good fortune  
Your friends they wont let go  
See your hair is in place  
And see away from the window  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Youre the judge how high it hangs  
When your castles made of sand  
Because the people who kill the king  
Are the people who move from within  
You cant rely on good fortune  
Your friends are crying low  
Kick your feet from the chair  
And let it slip from the gallow  
  
Repeat chorus
