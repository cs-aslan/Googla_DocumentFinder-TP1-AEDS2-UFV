Our love could never take a middle road  
Our love is always on a tightrope  
Sometimes Im glad just to see you there  
But most times Im afraid yes Im afraid  
  
I miss you but I dont wanna tell you  
I need you but I dont want you to know  
Sometimes Im glad just to know youre here  
But most times Im afraid yes Im afraid  
  
Why didnt anybody tell me  
That there were more heartaches to learn  
Why didnt anybody tell me  
There were more corners to turn  
  
I dreamt of us we were on a middle road  
Holding hands and going all the way  
Sometimes Im afraid Im afraid that we are here  
But most times I hold my dream I hold my dream  
  
Why didnt anybody tell me  
That there were more streetlights to leave  
Why didnt anybody tell me  
The turn of the wheel was never to cease  
  
Why didnt anybody tell me  
That there were more streetlights to leave  
Why didnt anybody tell me  
The turn of the wheel was never to cease  
The turn of the wheel was never to cease
