Girl oh you came to me  
Touched my life  
Girl how you sheltered me  
Touched my life  
  
Its the joy you gave to me  
When I was on my own alone  
  
Girl your lips touching mine  
Ooh so fine  
Girl softly touching me  
Ooh so fine  
  
Shes the smile in my heart that sings  
Is a song for you again  
  
Ooh she opened up the door  
She made my life once more  
Yes she opened  
Ooh you opened up the door  
Ya made my life once more
