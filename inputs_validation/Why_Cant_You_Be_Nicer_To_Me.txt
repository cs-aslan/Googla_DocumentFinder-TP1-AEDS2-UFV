Somebodys screaming  
Looking at the ceiling  
Everythings so funny  
I dont have any money  
People dont even know me  
But they know how to show me  
  
Why cant you be nicer to me  
  
My pride is dying  
I think Im all done lying  
Nobodys sharing  
So I stop caring  
All alone and walking  
Nobodys talking  
  
Why cant you be nicer to me  
  
Well the wind is blowing  
Where am I going  
Off a bridge and falling  
Nobodys calling  
On the ground and laying  
Nobodys praying  
  
Why cant you be nicer to me
