Hell have another piece of pie  
Shell have a double reuben rye  
She works hard at eating well  
Thats why I love her  
  
Shes got a couple of pony kegs  
Her arms are bigger than my legs  
And when she holds  
Me I cant breathe  
  
Thats why I love her yeah  
Im her butter shes my bread  
Shes like mobile waterbed  
And when I get on top of her  
I cant touch the mattress  
  
And when her flesh begins to sag  
Shes like a human sleeping bag  
I feel so cozy safe and warm  
Shes my insulation  
  
I always know where she sat  
And when shes on me I get flat  
Some broken ribs a punctured lung  
Thats why I love her  
  
Shes my phillie Im her stud  
Her bean is bigger than my pud  
Its like feeding a tictac to a whale  
Thats why I love her
