How can you live  
With nothing at all  
  
Where do you run  
Where do you go  
When the holes in your truth  
Are starting to show  
  
And the rain comes  
And the world is on my head  
Crave the sun  
But I cant get out of bed  
  
How can you take  
Without giving back  
How does it work  
When its really cracked  
  
How does it feel  
And no wonder  
Hearts and minds have  
been won  
How does it feel  
And I wonder  
How its all come undone  
  
And the rain comes  
And the world is on my head  
Crave the sun  
But I cant get out of bed  
  
Want it you got it youre sorry  
You bought it youre sliding  
Want it you got it youre sorry  
You bought it cant hide it  
Tell me who do you see  
Cause you look a lot like me  
  
How can you take  
Without giving back  
Who do you see  
Cause you look a lot like me  
  
Want it you got it youre sorry  
You bought it youre sliding  
Want it you got it youre sorry  
You bought it cant hide it  
Want it you got it youre sorry  
You bought it youre sliding  
Want it you got it youre sorry  
You bought it cant hide it  
  
And the rain comes  
And the world is on my head  
Crave the sun  
But I cant get out of bed  
  
Want it you got it youre sorry  
You bought it youre sliding  
Want it you got it youre sorry  
You bought it cant hide it  
Tell me who do you see  
Cause you look a lot like me  
  
You look a lot like me  
You look a lot you look a lot like me whoah  
You look a lot like me whoah  
You look a lot like me whoah  
You look a lot like me whoah  
You look a lot like me whoah
