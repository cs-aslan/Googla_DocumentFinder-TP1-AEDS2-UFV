Heaven loves ya  
The clouds part for ya  
Nothing stands in your way  
When youre a boy  
  
Clothes always fit ya  
Life is a pop of the cherry  
When youre a boy  
  
When youre a boy  
You can wear a uniform  
When youre a boy  
Other boys check you out  
You get a girl  
These are your favourite things  
When youre a boy  
  
Boys  
Boys  
Boys keep swinging  
Boys always work it out  
  
Uncage the colours  
Unfurl the flag  
Luck just kissed you hello  
When youre a boy  
  
Theyll never clone ya  
Youre always first on the line  
When youre a boy  
  
When youre a boy  
You can buy a home of your own  
When youre a boy  
Learn to drive and everything  
Youll get your share  
When youre a boy  
  
Boys  
Boys  
Boys keep swinging  
Boys always work it out
