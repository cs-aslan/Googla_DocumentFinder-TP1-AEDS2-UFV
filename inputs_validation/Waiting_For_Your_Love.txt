Hands dont let her go cause then the midnight icy winds will blow  
Eyes give every drop this aint the way that shouldve made her stop  
Arms just let her know no one fills the place she used to grow  
Smile dont leave me now cause youre the reason shes here anyhow  
  
Words be gentle when you speak into her heart  
Cause if it breaks she may not come again  
  
Chorus  
Ive been waitin for your love and its been here all the time  
Right in front of me  
Ive been sittin waitin for your love and all the time its been here  
Right in front of me  
  
Look forget your pride she might kiss as youre like even tide  
Song be in her heart especially when were apart  
Love be by my side cause if she leaves there aint no place to hide  
Soul be with her now cause youre the first one she knew anyhow  
  
Words be gentle when you speak into her heart  
Cause if it breaks she may not come again  
  
Chorus  
  
Words be gentle when you speak into her heart  
Cause if it breaks she may not come again  
  
Ive been sittin waitin for your love and all the time its been here  
Right in front of me  
Draw the line Ill step across even further I give in you got me yeah  
Ive been sittin waitin for your love and all the time its been here  
Right in front of me yeah  
Just separated by ten thousand miles youre not alone girl you got me yeah  
Guess I neednt tell you that Im not around Im inside you got me yeah  
Ive been waitin for your love its been here all the time  
Right in front of me
