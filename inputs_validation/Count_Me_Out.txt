What kind of love is this that leaves me feeling cold  
You look right through me what see nobody knows  
Youre in a world all by yourself  needing no one else  
Feeling so secure  
  
Youre on the road to nowhere left your past behind  
Whats to become of me should feelings be denied  
Another time another place would i be the same old face  
For you to have around  
  
Theres no way in theres no way out im caught in the middle  
Why must you leave my heart in doubt  
We have a one way love that flows from me to you  
Theres nothing more for me to lose  
  
Were through with talking now we know that its the end  
Weve played our foolish games amd its useless to pretend  
It seems like only yesterday that love had come to stay  
How could we be so blind  
  
Theres no way in theres no way out im caught in the middle  
Why must you leave my heart in doubt  
We have a one way love that flows from me to you  
Theres nothing more for me to lose  
  
I dont know where your heart is or whats inside your head  
If this is love you said it if this is love forget it  
If this is love then count me out
