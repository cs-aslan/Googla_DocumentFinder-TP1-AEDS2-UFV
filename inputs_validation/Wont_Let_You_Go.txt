When your fire has turn to ashes  
Youre screaming your heart is bleeding  
When youre feeling like theres no reason

Cause when youre all alone and its cold and theres no one to hold  
When youre feeling lost and theres nowhere theres nowhere to go  
When youre feeling sad dont forget you can reach for my hand  
When youre feeling down just remember  
I wont let you go I wont let you go  
I wont let you go I wont let you go
