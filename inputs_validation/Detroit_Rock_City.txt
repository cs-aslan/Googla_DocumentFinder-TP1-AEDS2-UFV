I feel uptight on a Saturday night  
Nine o clock the radios the only light  
I hear my song and it pulls me through  
Comes on strong tells me what I got to do  
I got to  
  
Get up  
Everybodys gonna move their feet  
Get down  
Everybodys gonna leave their seat  
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City  
  
Get up  
Everybodys gonna move their feet  
Get down  
Everybodys gonna leave their seat  
  
Getting late  
I just cant wait  
Ten oclock and I know I gotta hit the road  
First I drink then I smoke  
Start the car and I try to make the midnight show  
  
Get up  
Everybodys gonna move their feet  
Get down  
Everybodys gonna leave their seat  
  
Movin fast doin ninety five  
Hit top speed but Im still movin much too slow  
I feel so good Im so alive  
I hear my song playin on the radio  
It goes  
  
Get up  
Everybodys gonna move their feet  
Get down  
Everybodys gonna leave their seat  
  
Twelve oclock I gotta rock  
Theres a truck ahead lights starin at my eyes  
Oh my God no time to turn  
I got to laugh cause I know Im gonna die  
Why  
  
Get up  
Everybodys gonna move their feet  
Get up  
Everybodys gonna leave their seat
