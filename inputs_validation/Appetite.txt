Usher Usher yeah man true story  
Real Gs wit me on this one ya ya ya ya  
  
Verse 1  
Wifey home wedding band Im a lucky man  
Youd think Id be satisfied and truthfully yes I am  
But lately only late at night I find it hard to sleep  
Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets  
My Mac is in my backpack Im surfing on the sites  
Im chatting this aint cheating just telling myself a lie  
And its almost like Im caught up and living another life  
Man Im hungry for something I need to feed this appetite  
  
Chorus  
Tempted I must confess but I better not make a mess  
Better give my girl my best put my bs under arrest  
Cause I love my lady  
Fellas if ya love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies appetite for
the ladies  
Coulda picked up the phone could of ended up doing wrong  
Man I miss home but I ate my dinner at home cause I love my lady  
Fellas if ya love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies appetite for
the ladies  
  
Verse 2  
Im not trying to be late rush through security gates  
With weather in Atlanta all out going flights delayed  
No rooms left in the Mandarin I gotta figure out a play  
Sparked up some conversation she was going the same way  
We started talking business she handed me a card  
We exchanged information I rented me a car  
While Im driving she calling Im thinking this is how it starts  
Fine as hell but I dont wanna break my babys heart no no no  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
They call me USHER RAYMOND  
And I just wanna do right by my lady  
But lately I been slippin up fantasies bout dimes on the side  
Dark tint on my ride I gotta 10 in ride I can hide  
I cant lie lie but ever since I put that band on my hand  
More and more chicks trying to get at me  
Then I dont know what to do  
Just trying to handle my grown man BI  
Got a girl I dont want to lose I dont want to lose  
Break her heart I do want to do I dont want to be that fool  
Make that move  
Bend them a bit but never break the rules bend a bit but never break the
rules  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
She got the door locked and the lock dont fit your key  
Yeah you punching up her numbers in the ADT  
Youll be wondering how the hell I let this happen to me  
Better not feed feed feed that appetite  
Now your babys gone you putting out an APB  
And some other brother been tossing up your PYT  
Get caught slippin you gone wish you would of listened to me  
Brother dont feed feed feed that appetite
