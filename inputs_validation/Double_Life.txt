In the dark so all alone  
Slowly reach for the telephone  
A message waits just for you  
A secret place another rendezvous  
  
Its not always honesty  
That is the best policy  
But little lies can give you away  
Though youll deny it if they say maybe youre just  
  
Leading a double life  
Friends in the daytime strangers at night  
Leading a double life  
Can it be wrong when you know that its right  
  
The other side of the Berlin Wall is  
Not far enough to avoid the call  
Somebody knows somebodys seen  
Somebody knows right where youve been  
And that youre just  
  
Leading a double life  
Friends in the daytime strangers at night  
Leading a double life  
Can it be wrong when you know that its right  
  
Nowhere to hide though we both might try  
Im schizophrenic and so am I  
Double life a double life a masquerade  
You know we all live a masquerade  
I know youre out there  
  
Leading a double life  
Friends in the daytime strangers at night  
Leading a double life  
Can it be wrong when you know that its right
