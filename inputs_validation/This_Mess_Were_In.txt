Can you hear them  
The helicopters  
Im in New York  
No need for words now  
We sit in silence  
You look me  
In the eye directly  
You met me  
I think its Wednesday  
The evening  
The mess were in and  
  
The city sun sets over me  
  
Night and day  
I dream of  
Making love  
To you now baby  
Lovemaking  
Onscreen  
Impossible dream  
And I have seen  
The sunrise  
Over the river  
The freeway  
Reminding  
Of this mess were in and  
  
The city sun sets over me  
  
What were you wanting  
I just want to say  
Dont ever change now baby  
And thank you  
I dont think well ever meet again  
And you must leave now  
Before the sunrise  
Above skyscrapers  
The sin and  
The mess were in and  
  
The city sun sets over me
