Glen Sharrock  
It took a long time  
But now Im gonna be laughing  
A very long time  
When all I could feel was sad  
A very long time  
But now its gonna be worth it  
Cause I just found a friend to make me glad  
Im feeling food feeling better  
Im feeling best  
I feel a cut above the rest  
Im gonna put it to the test  
Feeling good feeling better  
Feeling best  
Feeling good feeling better  
Im feeling best  
I hope it doesnt sound like Im blowing my own trumpet  
Cause all I wanna do is join up with the band  
When you feel good  
You gotta come right out and say it  
Ive been so long at sea and Ive just seen land  
Im feeling food feeling better  
Im feeling best  
I feel a cut above the rest  
Im gonna put it to the test  
Feeling good feeling better  
Feeling best  
Feeling good feeling better  
Im feeling best
