Loves been here and gone  
But the memry keeps holding on  
Now I know how love is if I can live through this  
Loves been here and gone  
When theres love your heart is strong  
But it weakens when love goes wrong  
Now Ive known that power dealt the parting hour  
Loves been here and gone  
Ive loved once but never again a closed heart just wont let love in  
Hopin only to you oh what can I do loves been here and gone  
 piano   
Ive loved once but never again
