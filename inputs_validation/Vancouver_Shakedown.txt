We only came here to play rocknroll  
Share some times with some people we know  
Drink some wine  
Give us some time  
  
We aint no wise boys we aint no fools  
We tried to play clean and keep to the rules  
We take and we give just playin our gig  
But we got laid over  
  
Ya we was done over  
Somebody tell us whats goin down  
Dont need another Vancouver shakedown  
Six miles high six miles along  
  
Chasin the sun weve come to sing you a song  
Deliver our goods  
Were just rocknroll dudes  
All these behind us and one more to go  
  
Fly to Vancouver to do the lastshow  
Its got to be good like we know that it should  
But we got laid over  
Ya we was doneover  
  
Somebody tell us whats goin down  
Dont need another Vancouver shakedown  
Vancouver shakedown
