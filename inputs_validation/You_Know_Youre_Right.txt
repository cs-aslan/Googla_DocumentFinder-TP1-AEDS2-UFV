I would never bother you  
I would never promise to  
I will never follow you  
I will never bother you  
Never say a word again  
I will crawl away for good  
  
I will move away from here  
You wont be afraid of fear  
No thought was put into this  
I always knew it would come to this  
Things have never been so swell  
And I have never failed to fail  
  
Pain  
Pain  
Pain  
You know youre right  
You know youre right  
You know youre right  
  
Its so warm and calm inside  
I no longer have to hide  
Theres talk about someone else  
Steaming soon begins to melt  
Nothin really bothers her  
She just wants to love herself  
  
I will move away from here  
You wont be afraid of fear  
No thought was put into this  
I always knew itd come to this  
Things have never been so swell  
And I have never failed to fail  
  
Pain  
Pain  
Pain  
Pain  
Pain  
You know youre right  
You know youre right  
You know youre right  
You know youre right  
You know youre right  
You know youre right  
You know youre right  
You know youre right  
You know youre right  
You know youre right  
You know youre right  
You know youre right  
You know your rights  
You know your rights  
You know your rights  
Pain
