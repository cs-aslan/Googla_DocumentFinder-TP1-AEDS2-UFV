I dont mind you comin here  
And wastin all my time  
Cause when youre standin oh so near  
I kinda lose my mind yeah  
Its not the perfume that you wear  
Its not the ribbons in your hair  
I dont mind you comin here  
And wastin all my time  
  
Chorus  
I guess youre just what I needed  
Just what I needed  
I needed someone to feed  
I guess youre just what I needed  
Just what I needed  
I needed someone to bleed  
  
I dont mind you hangin out  
And talkin in your sleep  
It doesnt matter where youve been  
As long as it was deep yeah  
You always knew to wear it well and  
You look so fancy I can tell  
I dont mind you hangin out  
And talkin in your sleep  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont mind you comin here  
And wastin all my time  
Cause when youre standin oh so near  
I kinda lose my mind yeah  
Its not the perfume that you wear  
Its not the ribbons in your hair  
I dont mind you comin here  
And wastin all my time  
  
Chorus x2
