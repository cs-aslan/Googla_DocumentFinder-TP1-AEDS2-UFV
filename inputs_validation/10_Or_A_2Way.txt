Precious fingers she knows how to hold the poison  
Lick it dip it and for no particular reason  
She crawls on the floor  
Slides against the door  
Precious fingers shows her blossom in this season  
  
Doesnt matter shell be doing it her way  
Doesnt care if its a 10 or a 2 way  
Doesnt matter shell be doing it her way  
Every night every day  
  
I  
Never meant to show up here anyway  
Im  
Only fucking you till the seasons change  
  
Treasure deep between the places that you hold dear  
Came to her to act as if we are in love here  
Lying across this chair  
Fingers everywhere  
To the follies of the angels up above yea  
  
Doesnt matter shell be doing it her way  
Doesnt care if its a 10 or a 2 way  
Doesnt matter shell be doing it her way  
Every night every day  
  
I  
Never meant to show up here anyway  
Im  
Only fucking you till the seasons change  
  
When you come be a good girl  
Hold your breath make it last long  
It is called death  
The little death death girl  
  
I  
Never meant to show up here anyway  
Im  
Only fucking you till the seasons change  
  
I  
Never meant to show up here anyway  
Im  
Only fucking you till the seasons change
