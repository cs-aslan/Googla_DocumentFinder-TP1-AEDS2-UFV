Mama said she said its gonna be alright  
Yes she did well come to bed and turn out the light  
Shes sleeping there shes dreaming through her life  
Yes she is  
Well you know youve done no wrong  
All you done is sing this song  
You sing this song yeah  
On a Saturday night  
On a Saturday night  
Everything is alright  
Thats when the bad man meets his fate  
Sitting there youre feeling only second rate  
Youre sorry now youve come a little bit too late  
Yes you did  
But when you come around  
You only bring you down  
You feel a clown yeah  
On a Saturday night  
On a Saturday night  
Everything is alright yeah  
Mama said she said its gonna be alright  
You know she said youve got to see the coming light  
You know you are youre riding through your life  
Yes you are  
Well you know youve done your best  
All you needs a little rest  
Youve done your best yes  
On a Saturday night  
On a Saturday night  
Everything is alright  
Everything is alright  
Saturday night  
Saturday night
