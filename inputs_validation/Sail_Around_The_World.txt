I WOULD SAIL AROUND THE WORLD  
LOOK FOR GOLD AND DIVE FOR PEARL  
BUT I KNOW I WILL NEVER GET TO GO  
I WOULD LIKE TO WIN A PRIZE BE IN EVERYBODYS EYES  
BUT ITS TRUE I WOULD PROBABLY NOT GET TO  
  
MY LIFE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SIMPLE  
NO ONE EVER KNOWS WHEN I COME AND GO  
AND MY DREAMS ARE ENDING AT SUNRISE  
AND DREAMING JUST DONT MAKE IT SO  
  
SO IVE LIVED WITHOUT REGRETS  
WOULDNT CHANGE A THING AND YET  
NOW AND THEN WISH THAT I COULD START AGAIN
