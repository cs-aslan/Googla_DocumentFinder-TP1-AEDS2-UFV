If youve got a lover and youve made your mind up  
You dont want my love anymore  
If youre gonna leave and nothings gonna stop you  
And youre absolutely sure  
I want to try to change your mind or waste your precious time  
Or talk you out of leaving tonight  
Just dont ask me to pretend that Ill fall in love again  
The minute you walk out that door  
Im gonna miss you Im gonna miss  
Every touch and every kiss  
Im gonna miss you girl when you go  
More than youll ever know  
I dont know what I will do dont even have a clue  
Cant think that far ahead right now  
Do the things you want to guilt should never haunt you  
Ill go on without you somehow  
You dont have to call and get em I dont need no friend  
I could never see you that way  
So dont spare me the lie and Ill promise not to cry  
Baby when you walk away  
Im gonna miss you Im gonna miss  
Every touch and every kiss  
Im gonna miss you girl when you go  
More than youll ever know  
Im gonna miss you Im gonna miss you  
Im gonna miss you  
Im gonna miss you Im gonna miss you  
Im gonna miss you  
I wont try to change your mind no waste your precious time  
Or talk you out of leaving tonight  
Just dont ask me to pretend that Ill fall in love again  
The minute you walk out that door  
Im gonna miss you Im gonna miss  
Every touch and every kiss  
Im gonna miss you girl when you go  
More than youll ever know
