The time has come  
For me to talk to you  
And I dont mean  
To hurt your pride  
But everybody needs a friend sometimes  
To make you see the light  
  
Chorus  
In the game of life  
The strong survive  
Were on a oneway street  
We gotta make it out alive  
And never let em drag us down  
In the game of life  
We live and die  
Another breath begins  
Another chance to win the fight  
From the moment that you hit the ground  
In the game of life  
  
Youre born to hunt  
And never run away  
And then youre hunted  
By the prey  
The wounded deer  
Leaps highest to the sun  
Until his day is done  
  
Chorus  
  
Here comes the morning  
Its time to play  
The game of life  
The game of life  
  
Chorus
