Something inside  
My heart  
And it feels like magic  
Its changing my life  
Since you came to me  
Everything is so bright I see  
You touched my heart  
And gave me love so real  
This time around I wanna let it show  
Theres something special  
In my heart you ought to know  
I feel for you  
I mean I truly love you  
In my heart and in my soul  
You are my love  
You are my all  
I feel for you  
I mean always love you  
Because to me  
You are a dream  
Come true  
Love grows  
Everyday  
And its hard to deny it  
You inspire me all the way  
The joy you bring  
Makes my heart keep on singing  
And all I wanna do  
Is to remain close to you  
This time around I wanna let it show  
Theres something special  
In my heart you ought to know  
I feel for you  
I mean I truly love you  
In my heart and in my soul  
You are my love you are my all  
I feel for you  
I mean Ill always love you  
Because to me you are a dream  
Come true  
You are my angel in disguise  
You are the reason I survive  
With you each moment is worthwhile  
You make me smile  
And if without you  
Surely I cry  
I feel for you  
I mean I truly love you  
In my heart and in my soul  
You are my love you are my all  
I feel for you  
I mean Ill always love you  
Because to me you are a dream3x  
Thats what I feel for you
