On a rainy day  
  
Just let a smile be your umbrella  
On a rainy rainy day  
And if your sweetie cries just tell her  
That a smile will always pay  
  
Whenever skies are gray  
Dont you worry or fret  
A smile will bring the sunshine  
And youll never get wet  
  
So let a smile be your umbrella  
On a rainy rainy day  
  
Just let a smile be your umbrella  
On a rainy rainy day  
And if your sweetie cries just tell her  
That a smile will always pay  
  
Whenever skies are gray  
Dont worry or fret  
A smile will bring the sunshine  
And youll never get wet  
  
So let a smile be your umbrella  
On a rainy rainy day  
  
Just let a smile be your umbrella  
On a rainy rainy day  
On a rainy rainy day  
On a rainy rainy day
