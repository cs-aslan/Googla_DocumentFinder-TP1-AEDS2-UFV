Sweet sweet sounds will fill the air  
  
Every days a holiday when your lips meet mine  
The musics keepin time with our love  
You are here and so am I  
The weathers quite divine  
So pass me round your wine lovely one  
  
All I need is just one hit to get me by  
Cause baby when your near Im halfway high
