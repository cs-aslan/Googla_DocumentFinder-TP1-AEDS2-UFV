I remember when I was a very little girl our house caught on fire  
Ill never forget the look on my fathers face as he gathered me up in his
arms  
And raced through the burning building out to the pavement  
I stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in
flames  
And when it was all over I said to myself  
Is that all there is to a fire   
  
Is that all there is  
Is that all there is  
If thats all there is my friends  
Then lets keep dancing  
Lets break out the booze  
And have a ball  
If thats all there is  
  
And when I was 12 years old my father took me to the circus the greatest
show on earth  
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears and a beautiful lady in pink
tights flew high above our heads  
And as I sat there watching the marvelous spectacle I had the feeling that
something was missing  
I dont know what but when it was over I said to myself  
Is that all there is to a circus   
  
Is that all there is  
Is that all there is  
If thats all there is my friends  
Then lets keep dancing  
Lets break out the booze  
And have a ball  
If thats all there is  
  
Then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world  
We would take long walks by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each
others eyes  
We were so very much in love Then one day he went away  
And I thought Id die but I didnt  
And when I didnt I said to myself  
Is that all there is to love   
  
Is that all there is  
Is that all there is  
If thats all there is my friends  
Then lets keep dancing  
  
I know what you must be saying to yourselves  
If thats the way she feels about it why doesnt she just end it all   
Oh no Not me Im in no hurry for that final disappointment  
For I know just as well as Im standing here talking to you  
When that final moment comes and Im breathing my last breath  
Ill be saying to myself   
  
Is that all there is  
Is that all there is  
If thats all there is my friends  
Then lets keep dancing  
Lets break out the booze  
And have a ball  
If thats all there is
