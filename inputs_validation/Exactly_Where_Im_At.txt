Lets begin with the past in front and all the things that you really dont
care about now  
Youd be exactly where Im at  
And to think youve got a grip well look at yourself your lips are like two
flaps of fat  
They go front and back and flappidy flappidy flap  
  
Im on stage its all an act Im really scared that I may fall back on the
abstract  
Itd be exactly where Im at  
  
If youre to be  
The roaming eye well pry it open and let me tell you why it sees  
The harsh realities  
  
Lets begin with the past in front and all the things that you really dont
care about now  
Youd be exactly where Im at
