Its a kind of magic  
Its a kind of magic  
A kind of magic  no way  
One dream one soul one prize  
One goal one golden glance of what should be  
Its a kind of magic  
One shaft of light that shows the way  
No mortal man can win this day  
Its a kind of magic  
The bell that rings inside your mind  
Is challenging the doors of time  
Its a kind of magic  
The waiting seems eternity  
The day will dawn of sanity  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Is this a kind of magic  
Its a kind of magic  
There can be only one  
This rage that lasts a thousand years  
Will soon be done  
This flame that burns inside of me  
Im hearing secret harmonies  
Its a kind of magic  
The bell that rings inside your mind  
Is challenging the doors of time  
Its a kind of magic  
Its a kind of magic  
This rage that lasts a thousand years  
Will soon be will soon be will soon be done  
This is this is a kind a kind of magic yeah  
There can be only one one one one  
This rage that lasts a thousand years  
Will soon be done  done
