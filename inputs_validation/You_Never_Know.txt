Whoa whoa whoa  
You dont know  
  
Whoa whoa whoa  
Whoa whoa  
You dont know  
  
You walk around and baby theres something youre missing  
Hallucinations happen in your head  
This look youre giving me is not even focusing  
Something I did or maybe something I said  
  
Chorus  
You never know baby  
You never know baby  
You never know baby  
You never know  
You judge us all by the lie that was told baby  
You never know baby  
You never know  
  
Yeah  
Whoa whoa  
You dont know  
  
I speak these words  
But baby you dont even listen  
These things I say  
Just going through your head going through your head  
Ive got my gun  
But Im low on ammunition  
I am like a book that is waiting to be read  
  
Chorus  
  
Do you ever wonder  
Dont you ever wonder baby  
Whos spell your under  
Dont you ever wonder baby  
Do you ever wonder  
Dont you ever wonder baby  
Weve got your number  
Dont you ever wonder  
  
You never know  
Do you ever know  
Do you ever know  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh  
Whoa oh  
Whoa oh  
  
You dont know  
Whoa whats the source of all this  
Baby youve been dishin  
Could they be lies that maybe youve fed that you fed  
Consider well the kind of stream where youve been fishin  
Im like a book thats waiting to be read  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby you never know  
Whoa whoa whoa  
You never know  
You dont know  
Whoa whoa whoa  
Whoa whoa you dont know
