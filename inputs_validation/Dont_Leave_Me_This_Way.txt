All of my life all of my life  
Ive been searching for a love like ours  
Somewhere to stay somewhere safe in your arms  
I was so sure  
Are you really saying your hearts changing  
Do you really mean goodbye  
  
Dont leave me this way no no  
Dont tell me its over  
Weve only begun and our love is so young  
Youre leading me nowhere  
Dont leave me this way  
Dont leave me this way  
  
Say whats on your mind one thing at a time  
And I promise you well talk it through  
Dont walk away theres so much more to say  
Though my words seem lost on you  
Cant believe youre talking like were just friends  
Cant you see the tears I cry  
  
Dont leave me this way no no  
Dont tell me its over  
Weve only begun and our love is so young  
Youre leading me nowhere  
Dont leave me this way  
Dont leave me this way  
  
Are you really saying your hearts changing  
Do you really mean it this time  
Baby  
  
Dont leave me this way oh no  
Dont tell me its over  
Weve only begun and our love is so young  
Youre leading me nowhere  
Dont leave me this way  
Dont leave me this way  
No dont tell me that its over  
Weve only begun and our love is so young  
Dont leave me now  
  
Dont leave me dont leave me this way dont leave me this way  
Dont leave me dont leave me this way oh youre gonna leave me now  
Dont leave me dont leave me this way  
Dont leave me dont leave me this way  
  
Dont leave me this way  
If youll just take a little bit of time  
You just might want to change your mind  
Dont leave me this way  
Dont leave me this way
