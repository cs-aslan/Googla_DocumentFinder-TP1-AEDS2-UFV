Verse 1  
He could be a sinner or a gentleman  
He could be your preacher when your soul is down  
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but  
Hell never love you like I can can  
  
He could be a stranger you gave a second glance  
He could be a trophy of a one night stand  
He could have your humour but I dont understand cause  
Hell never love you like I can can can  
  
Chorus  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
Hell never love you like I can can can  
Hell never love you like I can can  
  
Verse 2  
A chance encounter of circumstance  
Baby hes a mantra keeps your mind entranced  
He could be a silence in this mayhem but then again  
Hell never love you like I can can can  
  
Chorus  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
Hell never love you like I can can can  
Hell never love you like I can can can  
Hell never love you like I can can can  
  
Bridge  
We both have demons that we cant stand  
I love your demons like devils can  
If youre still seeking an honest man  
Then stop deceiving lord please  
  
Chorus  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
Hell never love you like I can can can  
  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
Hell never love you like I can can can  
Hell never love you like I can can can  
Hell never love you like I can can can
