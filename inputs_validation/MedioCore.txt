Mediocore its not forsaken the music theyre makin  
Will leave you with a feeling of indifference  
How was the band  
They were okay not great but pretty good  
They played the songs I knew they would  
Some old some new the same formula stay true  
We can concur its mediocre  
  
Sing sing a sing make it simple so all the kids can sing along  
  
Mediocore the list keeps growin the melodies that have been stolen  
Remind me of songs sung in the seventies you might fool the kids  
But you dont fool me you ever heard of something called aboriginality  
  
Is it absurd to compose music no ones ever heard  
Predictability like a bosom will comfort them  
My arch enemy lowest common denominator  
  
Mediocore its under powered the riffs are all deflowered  
Its spreading faster than British tooth decay  
Are you ready to rock How you all doin tonight  
You condescending fucks make me want to puke and laugh the same  
  
Im one to speak this song sounds like 50 songs youve heard before medio
core
