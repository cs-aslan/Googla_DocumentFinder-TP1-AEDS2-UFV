Break it you buy it  
Nothings for free  
Especially my body  
Especially me  
Break it you bought it  
I pray that you dont  
Dont do what all guys do  
Do what all guys do  
  
Just forgetting to be social  
When you turn to dishonest  
Think that running the streets worthy  
That just turns months into weeks into days  
I aint wanna be cordial  
Im just speaking to your conscience  
  
You want to take it but I wont give it away  
Leave me in a mess I never made  
Tryin to play a game I never learned  
No one ever wins a love charade  
  
You think that youre the only that ever say  
You love me when its over  
  
Break it you buy it  
This ones on me  
Dont start a riot  
Dont cause a scene  
Start up a fire  
Pray that you dont  
Dont do what all guys do  
Do what all guys do  
  
Just forgetting to be social  
When you turn to dishonest  
Think that running the streets worthy  
That just turns months into weeks into days  
I aint wanna be cordial  
Im just speaking to your conscience  
  
You want to take it but I wont give it away  
Leave me in a mess I never made  
Tryin to play a game I never learned  
No one ever wins a love charade  
  
You think that youre the only that ever say  
You love me when its over  
  
You shoulda took your time  
Did it right when you had me baby  
You shoulda took your time  
Shoulda took your time when you had me  
You shoulda took your time  
Did it right when you had me baby  
She was playing games all those love charades  
  
You want to take it but I wont give it a away  
Leave me in a mess I never made  
Tryin to play a game I never learned  
No one ever wins the love charade  
  
You think that youre the only that ever say  
You love me when its over
