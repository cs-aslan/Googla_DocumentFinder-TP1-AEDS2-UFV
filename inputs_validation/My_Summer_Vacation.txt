This is the final boarding call for flight 1259  
Departing from Los Angeles final destination to St Louis  
Thank you  
  
Damn G the spots gettin hot  
So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot  
Police looking at niggas through a microscope  
In LA everybody and they momma sell dope  
They trying to stop it  
So what the fuck can I do to make a profit  
Catch a flight to St Louis  
Thats cool cause nobody knew us  
We stepped off the plane  
Four gang bangers professional crack slangers  
Rented a car at wholesale  
Drove to the ghetto and checked in a motel  
Unpacked and I grab the threeeighty  
Cause where we stayin niggas look shady  
But they cant fade South Central  
Cause bustin a cap is fundamental  
Checkin out every block close  
Seein which one will clock the most  
Yeah this is the one no doubt  
Bust a you Bone and lets clear these niggaz out  
  
Hey hey man whats up nigga  
Yo well this Lench Mob nigga  
  
Now clearin em out meant casualties  
Still had the LA mentality  
Bust a cap and out of there in a hurry  
Wouldnt you know a driveby in Missouri  
Them fools got popped  
Took their corner next day set up shop  
And its better than slangin in the Valley  
Triple the profit makin more than I did in Cali  
Breakin off rocks like Barney Rubble  
Cause them markass niggas dont want trouble  
And we aint on edge when we do work  
Police dont recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts  
Getting bitches and they cant stand a  
Nineteenninetyone Tony Montana  
Now the shits like a war  
Of gang violence where it was never seen before  
Punks whirl when the gat bust  
Four jheri curl niggas kickin up dust  
And some of them are even lookin up to us  
Wearing our colors and talkin that gang fuss  
Giving up much love  
Dyin for a street that they aint even heard of  
But other motherfuckers want to stand strong  
So you know the phrase once again its on  
  
TV announcer  
Top of the news tonight gangs from South Central  
Los Angeles which are known for their driveby shootings  
Have migrated into East St Louis  
Leaving three dead and two others injured  
No arrests have been made  
Police say this is a nationwide trend  
With similar incidents occurring in Texas Michigan and Oklahoma  
female voice repeating in background  
If it can happen here it can happen anywhere  
  
Boom my homie got shot hes a goner black  
St Louis niggas want they corner back  
Shooting in snowy weather  
Its illegal business niggas still cant stick together  
Fuckin police got the fouroneone  
That LA aint all surf and sun  
But we aint thinkin bout the boys  
Feudin like the Hatfields and McCoys  
Now the shits gettin tricky  
Cause now they lookin for the colors and the khakis  
Damn the spots gettin hot from the battle  
About to pack up and start slangin in Seattle  
But the NARCs raid about six in the morning  
Try to catch a nigga while hes yawnin  
Put his glock to my chest as I paused  
Went to jail in my motherfuckin drawers  
Tryin to give me fiftyseven years  
Facell be full of those tattooed tears  
Its the same old story and the same old nigga stuck  
And the public defender aint givin a fuck  
The fool must be sparkin  
Talkin about a double life plea bargain  
You got to deal with the Crips and Bloods by hand G  
Plus the Black Guerilla family  
And the white pride dont like Northside  
And its a riot if any more niggas die  
No parole or probation  
Now this is a young mans summer vacation  
No chance for rehabilitation  
Cause look at the motherfuckin years that Im facin  
Ima end it like this cause you know whats up  
My life is fucked
