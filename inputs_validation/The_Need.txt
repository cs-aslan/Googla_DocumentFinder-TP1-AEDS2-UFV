Get the need  
Get it  
Im in the movies  
  
Hello young thing  
Im an old film star  
Maybe youve seen my picture  
  
I need it  
Like an old newsreel  
Im just fading away  
  
Bang bang dear  
Ive got the needles  
And Ive got the need  
If youd be so kind  
  
Come on and feel the need in me  
Come on and feel the need  
Feel it  
  
Hello young thing  
Ive got reverse instructions  
In the back of my car  
  
I need it  
Dont cry till this thing is over  
And my friends applaud  
  
Bang bang dear  
When can we do this again  
And put it all on film  
  
Hello young love  
Ive got something to show you  
And please dont be ashamed  
  
Im the man  
Im the atrocity film star  
And Ive got the need
