I was alone  
My love was an endless night  
You came to me  
Lover you made it right  
I understand sometimes  
It may not show  
So Im taking the time  
To let you know  
  
CHORUS  
Im aware of your love  
 repeat 7 times   
  
  
A heavy load  
Upon me every day  
But with your smile  
Youve taken it all away  
Ive never been a man  
Of many words  
But cant you see now  
Im trying to say  
  
  
CHORUS  
  
  
You are the inspiration  
Of every word I say  
I swear sometimes I know  
You try to give me death to pay  
The way you hold me in the night  
You make me feel all right  
This is the only way  
To tell you Im trying  
Baby Im trying Im trying  
Im trying Im trying  
 repeat 2 times
