It started when the neighbors saw my fancy new TV  
That opens up the gate outside my home  
And lets me let in anyone I really want to see  
And keep out all them other dudes I dont  
  
Then one by one they started comin over to perform  
And someone played Temptation on kazoo  
Nellie got as naked as the day that she was born  
And it sure was all over Baby Blue  
  
Chorus  
Ive got electric eyes two big dogs and a minefield  
And miles and miles and miles of barbedwire fence  
But the biggest show in town is in my driveway  
And we aint had a good night sleepin since  
  
Orville Bakers showin us the fastest draw in town  
Cora Lees clackin on her spoons  
Ol Jesses trick dog sure does look dead lyin on the ground  
And Jesses wife is ahowlin at the moon  
  
Charlys ugly daughter sure can tap dance  
Mable Thatchers walkin on her hands  
And just as I was leavin for the kitchen for a snack  
Ol Lulla Bell amazed us with her fans  
  
Chorus  
  
Froneys got an act thats hard to follow  
Norman plays a nimble tamborine  
You should see what Sara Lee can swallow  
And ol Billy does a wicked Mr Clean  
  
Good Lord if Idve known this future when I started  
Believe you me Id never change a thing  
I got a closed circuit circus in my bedroom  
And a world full of whackos in the wings  
Get em Burt  
  
Chorus
