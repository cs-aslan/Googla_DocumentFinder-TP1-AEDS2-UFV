Have you heard about trouble throughout the land  
With the fascists and the left wing militants  
Out of work executives are killing themselves  
And the IRA are killing everybody else  
Dont panic dont lose control  
Keep your head keep ahold  
Act normal theres nothing wrong  
Stay cool just carry on  
  
You gotta live life and be yourself  
You cant live life for anyone else  
You gotta live life thats all you do  
Nobody gonna live your life for you  
  
Dont get depressed when you read in the press  
About world revolution and social unrest  
Try not to panic when you switch on the news  
And see crooked politicians and the unemployment queues  
Its only life its really fine  
So dont you believe all you read in the headlines  
Live life see it through  
Carry on its all you can do  
  
You gotta live life for yourself cant live for anyone else  
You gotta live life thats all you do  
Nobody gonna live their life for you  
  
Extra verse from long version  
Trendy intellectuals always take action  
For every cause thats ever been in fashion  
Weekend revolutionaries protest and sing  
Because theyre dedicated followers of any old thing  
They got every solution for every revolution  
They live in the slums just like the poor people do  
But theyd rather sniff coke instead of glue  
Rightwing fascists beat up the blacks  
Then they salute the Union Jack  
You cant pretent theres nothing wrong  
Its not the end so just carry on  
  
Oh lifes a mother oh lifes a mother  
Oh lifes a mother oh lifes a mother  
  
You gotta live life for yourself cant live life for anyone else  
You gotta live life
