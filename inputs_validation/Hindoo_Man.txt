Over there in India a Hindoo resides smoking his hoakam all day  
Opium and bits of rope and fag ends besides a wise man from the East
Whitechapel way  
Hes got a lovely palace on the beach  
Hes the Hindoo Howdoo Hoodoo Yoodoo man  
Hes got twelve bedrooms with eight wives in each  
Hes the Hindoo Howdoo Hoodoo Yoodoo man  
  
Hes got one wife who wears a veil it covers half her face  
From her nose right to her toes youll see nothing else but space  
Shell dance and waggle her San Fairy Ann  
For the Hindoo Howdoo Hoodoo Yoodoo man  
  
He practices his magic in the Eastern bazaar  
Slave girls come under his spell  
When he puts on the fluence  
They dont know where they are  
He does Indian tricks and dirty tricks as well  
Now what he fancies always does him good  
Hes the Hindoo Howdoo Hoodoo Yoodoo man  
  
He lives on rice roast beef and Yorkshire pud  
Hes the Hindoo Howdoo Hoodoo Yoodoo man  
He wears a dishcloth round his waist  
His favourite wife called Nellie  
Said Youd look well if the darned thing fell  
Youd have nowt to cover your  
He said Who cares I could always wear a fan  
Im a Hindoo Howdoo Hoodoo Yoodoo man  
  
He looks just like a Nabob of renown  
Hes the Hindoo Howdoo Hoodoo Yoodoo man  
A Nabob two bob three bob half a crown  
Hes a Hindoo Howdoo Hoodoo Yoodoo man  
A Princess brought him jewels and said  
For all your love I yearn  
But jewels could not compare with what  
He went and gave her in return  
Hes ninety nine but he does all he can  
For a Hindoo Howdoo Hoodoo Yoodoo Man
