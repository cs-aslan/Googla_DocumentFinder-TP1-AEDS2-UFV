Theres a lost river that flows  
In a valley where no on e goes  
Where the wild waters rush  
Rumbles deep in the hush  
  
Gone far from there now  
Lord Ill be back somehow  
To where the lost river winds  
In the shadow of the pines  
  
Oh lost river now Im coming back  
To the potbelly stove where the firewoods all stacked  
Oh Quebec girl go with me  
Oh my bell my fleur de lis  
Where the lost river winds  
In the shadow of the pines  
  
Now every body knows  
Where that lost river flows  
Its someplace hes lost  
Behind bridges that hes crossed  
  
Well hed like to return  
But his bridges are all burned  
And hes much too far down  
To return to higher ground  
  
Oh lost river now Im coming back  
To the potbelly stove where the firewoods all stacked  
Oh Quebec girl go with me  
Oh my bell my fleur de lis  
Where the lost river winds  
In the shadow of the pines  
  
Oh lost river far over the ridge  
Now is it too late for me to build me a new bridge  
To the bright golden time  
When her love was still mine  
And the world was still wild  
Like the heart of a child  
  
Oh lost river now Im coming back  
To the potbelly stove where the firewoods all stacked  
Oh Quebec girl go with me  
Oh my bell my fleur de lis  
Where the lost river winds  
In the shadow of the pines  
  
Where the lost river winds  
In the shadow of the pines
