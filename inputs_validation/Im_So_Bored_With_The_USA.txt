Yankee soldier  
He want to shoot some skag  
He met it in Cambodia  
But now he cant afford a bag  
  
Yankee dollar talk  
To the dictators of the world  
In fact its giving orders  
An they cant afford to miss a word  
  
Im so bored with the USA  
But what can I do  
  
Yankee detectives  
Are always on the TV  
Cause killers in America  
Work seven days a week  
  
Never mind the stars and stripes  
Lets print the Watergate Tapes  
Ill salute the New Wave  
And I hope nobody escapes  
  
Im so bored with the USA  
But what can I do  
  
Move up Starsky  
For the CIA  
Suck on Kojak  
For the USA
