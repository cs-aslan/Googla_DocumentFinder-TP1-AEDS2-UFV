Yo I was a fiend before I became a teen  
I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream  
Music orientated so when hiphop was originated  
Fitted like pieces of puzzles complicated  
Shot grabbed the mic and try to say  Yes yall  
They tried to take it and say that Im too small  
Cool Cause I dont get upset  
I kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug then I jet  
Back to the lab without a mic to grab  
So then I add all the rhymes I had  
One after the another one then I make another one  
To dis the opposite then ask if the brothers done  
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine  
But I dont need a cigarette know what I mean  
Im raging ripping up the stage and  
Dont it sound amazing cause every rhyme is made and  
Thought of cause its sort of an addiction  
Magnetized by the mixing

But back to the problem I gotta habit  
You cant solve it you silly rabbit  
The prescription is a hypertone thats thorough when  
I fiend for a microphone like heroin  
Soon as the bass kicks I need a fix  
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix  
And Ill put you in a mood or is it a state of unawareness  
Beware its the reaniamator  
A menace to a microphone a lethal weapon  
An assasinator if the people aint stepping  
You see a part of me that you never seen  
When Im fiending for a microphone  
Cause I take it to the maximum I cant relax see Im  
Hype as a hypochondriac cause the rap be one  
Hell of a antidote something you cant smoke  
More than dope youre trying to move away but you cant youre broke  
More than cracked up you should have backed up  
For those who act up need to be more than smacked up
