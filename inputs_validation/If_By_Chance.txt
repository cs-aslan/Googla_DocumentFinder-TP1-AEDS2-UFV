It might just be too deep  
Weve turned your love into a hate  
I cant wake you from this sleep  
I cant lure you with this bait  
And when youre all alone at night  
I feel for you I fight the fight  
I need to know that where you go  
Is real enough for me to know  
And if by chance Id drown for you  
Would you believe at last its true  
That all my soul was yours to take  
Would you believe I wasnt fake  
It might just be too late  
Weve turned your heart into a stone  
I cant save you from this fate  
I cant help you be alone  
And if by chance Id drown for you  
Would you believe at last its true  
That all my soul was yours to take  
Would you believe I wasnt fake  
Blood is thicker than water  
That could be a bunch of lies  
What makes me think I ought to  
Hold reins on all the ties  
And if by chance Id drown for you  
Would you believe at last its true  
That all my soul was yours to take  
Would you believe I wasnt fake  
And if by chance Id drown for you  
Would you believe at last its true  
That all my soul was yours to take  
Would you believe I wasnt fake
