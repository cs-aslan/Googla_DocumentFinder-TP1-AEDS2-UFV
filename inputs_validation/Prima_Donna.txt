Ill go down fightin  
But rather be delightin  
All the people that come to see  
The Devils from Chicago  
Now where the hell do they go  
When we get in our limousines  
  
Cause we just want to be  
Where its all going on  
But tell me what do you do  
When its over  
And everyone who  
Loved you is gone  
Theyre gone  
I said theyre gone  
  
Youre our kind of people  
Youre the church  
And were the steeple  
But were all inside the hall  
If weve got what you need  
Then well give you the speed  
To get up and have a ball  
  
Cause we just want to be  
Where its all going on  
But tell me what do you do  
When its over  
And everyone who  
Loved you is gone  
  
Youre just another  
Prima Donna of rock n roll  
So please let me know  
When you want me to go
