Hes at it again  
And hes gonna win  
Gonna take it for a hell ride anyway  
Hes on your side  
Gonna throw you aside  
And let the vultures pick apart whats left  
Seems like everything was just a fraction of a second from being okay  
So run and hide cause were all gonna die  
And let the vultures pick apart whats left  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
Hes at it again  
Hes at it again  
And it makes great television watching the world end  
Hes at it again  
Hes gonna win  
Gonna take it for a joyride anyway  
Youre standing in line better make up your mind  
And let the bastard pick apart whats left of you  
Seems like everything was just a fraction of a second from being a dream  
So run and hide cause were all gonna die  
Let the government decide whats left  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
Hes at it again  
Hes at it again  
And it makes great television watching the world end  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
Walk around I see  
Million possibilities  
Well I know  
Nowhere to go  
And I cant comprehend  
Things this real seems so pretend  
I know I dont know  
But Ill be back  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
And it makes great television watching the world end  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
Ill be back  
And it makes great television watching the world end  
Ill be back
