I see the cold mist in the night  
And watch the hills roll out of sight  
I watch in evry single way  
Inside out outside in evry day  
  
The sun can warm the coldest dawn  
And move the movement on the lawn  
I learn in evry single day  
Inside out outside in evry way  
  
And there you are  
Making it up but youre sure that it is a star  
And boy youll see  
Its an illusion shining down in front of me  
  
And then youll say  
Even in time we shall control the day  
When what youll see  
Deep inside base controlling you and me  
  
And one peculiar point I see  
As one of many ones of me  
As truth is gathered I rearrange  
Inside out outside in inside out outside in  
Perpetual change  
  
And there you are  
Saying we have the moon so now the stars  
When all you see  
Is near disaster gazing down on you and me  
  
And there youre standing  
Saying we have the whole world in our hands  
When all youll see  
Deep inside the worlds controlling you and me  
  
Youll see perpetual change  
Youll see perpetual change  
  
And there you are  
Making it up but youre sure that it is a star  
And boy youll see  
Its an illusion shining down in front of me  
  
And then youll say  
Even in time we shall control the day  
When what youll see  
Deep inside base controlling you and me  
  
As mist and sun are both the same  
We look on as pawns of their game  
They move to testify the day  
Inside out outside in inside out outside in  
All of the way  
Ah Ah
