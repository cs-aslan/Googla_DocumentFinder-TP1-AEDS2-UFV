Let me tell you a story  
Let me shovel some dirt  
Long time no sugar  
And its starting to hurt  
Somethings flattening my cola  
Somethings wrong with my brew  
Somethings rotten in idaho  
And I dont know what to do  
Going going gone with the red eye distress  
Going going gone on the red eye express  
Only go around once  
Gotta quench that thirst  
Gotta grab that gusto  
Gotta get there first
