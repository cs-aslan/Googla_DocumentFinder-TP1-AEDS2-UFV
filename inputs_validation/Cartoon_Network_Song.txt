Hi Im Robbys sister I guess thats plain to see  
When we watch cartoon cartoons Im happy as can be  
I think samurai Jack is cool And Dexters laboratory  
I miss watching power puff I miss watching T V  
  
Well livin the tour bus aint that bad  
But I feel like I lost all that I have  
  
On Cartoon Network I miss you so  
On Cartoon Network where did you go  
Grim and evil how I love that little brain  
Johnny Bravo can I smack you once again  
  
I hope youve learned a lesson here  
Treasure what you have dont make the mistake I made  
The rockstar life is sad  
  
Well livin on the tour bus is pretty bad  
And now Im sure I know the meanin in my life  
The love within my soul  
The reason I wake up each day and its  
  
Cartoon Network I miss you so  
My Cartoon Network where did you go  
My Cartoon Network
