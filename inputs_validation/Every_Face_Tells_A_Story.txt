Theres no need for you to tell me  
I can see the way you feel  
I just know without you saying  
What is a lie and whats real  
Every face tells a story  
Its hard to hide a lie  
Every face tells a story  
And yours is saying goodbye  
Somethings going on and I know it  
You cant keep it from me  
Your smile cannot hide what you feel inside  
And I dont like what I see  
Every face tells a story  
Its hard to hide a lie  
Every face tells a story  
And yours is saying goodbye  
Youre always telling stories  
Youre always telling me lies  
Youre always telling stories  
If you want to leave me leave me  
No good living a lie  
You can pretend that were not gonna end  
But your eyes are saying goodbye  
Every face tells a story  
Its hard to hide a lie  
Every face tells a story  
And yours is saying goodbye  
Youre always telling stories  
Youre always telling me lies  
Youre always telling stories  
Tell me I got a right to know  
Pour your little heart out to me baby  
You know you know I dont want to let go  
Every face tells a story  
Its hard to hide a lie  
Every face tells a story  
And yours is saying goodbye
