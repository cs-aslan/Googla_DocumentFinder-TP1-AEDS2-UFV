All right you guys feel funky tonight ah yeah  
This is an old Memphis song old Memphis song  
  
I used to smoke  
Five packs of cigarettes a day  
It was the hardest thing  
To put them away  
I drink four or five bottles of wine  
I kept a glass  
In my hand all the time  
Breaking those habits was hard to do  
But nothing compared to the changes  
You put me through  
  
Trying to live my life without you babe  
Its the hardest thing Ill ever do  
Trying to forget the love we once shared  
Its the hardest thing Ill ever have  
  
All right I said  
  
I had the worst reputation in town  
For chasing all the women around  
I thought changing my way of living  
Was hard to do  
But its nothing compared to the changes  
That you put me through  
Ive done everything Ive tried to do  
But its gonna take a miracle  
To get me over you  
  
Trying to live my life without you babe  
Its the hardest thing Ill ever do  
Trying to forget the love we once shared  
Its the hardest thing Ill ever have
