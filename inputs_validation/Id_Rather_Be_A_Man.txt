You dont fool me with your tinted eyes and makeup  
The firebird hides in shadow when you wake up  
Your golden hair is black  
Your jeans are tight but your hide is slack  
Try it on the company but you dont fool me  
  
Well Id rather be a man than play my role like you do  
Id rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
Id rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
Id rather be a man cause a man dont crawl like you do  
  
You dont fool me with your easy lies and fables  
You wont see me in ten buck furs and sables  
You sparkle like a snake  
The wine is real but the glass if fake  
Blame it on the apple tree but you dont fool me  
  
Well Id rather be a man than play my role like you do  
Id rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
Id rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
Id rather be a man cause a man dont crawl like you do  
  
Your golden hair is black  
Your jeans are tight but your hide is slack  
Try it on the company but you dont fool me  
  
Well Id rather be a man than play my role like you do  
Id rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
Id rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
Id rather be a man cause a man dont crawl like you do  
  
Id rather be a man cause a man dont crawl like you do  
  
Id rather be a man cause I wouldnt wanna be like you
