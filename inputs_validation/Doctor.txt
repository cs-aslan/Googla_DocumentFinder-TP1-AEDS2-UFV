Doctor can you help me please  
Im laying on the floor  
I need a glass of something  
Like you gave me once before  
Ill send my little messenger  
Hell bring the money to you  
Hell slowly make his way back home  
Therell be no horror show today my friends  
And me well be up and get away  
CHORUS  
If I fill your every need  
You wont feel so empty  
In my web Ill bet your life  
Youre dead before youre thirty  
Doctor can you help me please  
I trust you like my mum  
I know that you wont stop me turning  
All the whole world on  
You know that Ill always come to you  
When everything goes wrong  
You pick me up dont let me go down  
To the horror show today my friend  
And me well be up and get away
