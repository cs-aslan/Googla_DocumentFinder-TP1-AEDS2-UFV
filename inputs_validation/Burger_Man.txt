My charcoals getting red hot  
Put your order in my hand  
Wont you let me show you what I got  
Sizzlin in the pan  
  
Any way you want it baby  
I am your burger man  
  
If you need good hot grillin  
Try my burger stand  
If you need a slice of thrillin  
Im the baddest in the land  
  
Any way you want it baby  
I am your burger man  
  
Did you want double meat  
How bout some fries on the side  
  
Once you try my burger baby  
Youll grow a new thyroid gland  
I said just eat my burger baby  
Make you smart as Charlie Chan  
  
You see the hot sauce cant be beat  
Sit back and open wide
