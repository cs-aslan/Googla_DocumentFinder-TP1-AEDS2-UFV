Cover of Sons of Freedom song  
  
Last night I saw you standing in the rain  
So tired I must have been dreaming again  
It aint easy easy when youre on your own  
It aint easy easy when youre all alone  
  
Ill revenge you  
Ill revenge you  
Ill find you  
Nobody sees your pain  
Just make sure you dont sell your soul  
Just make sure you dont sell your soul  
  
Last night I saw you backing up all afraid  
So tired I must have been dreaming again  
It aint easy easy 2nd Avenue  
It aint easy easy those things you put me through  
  
Ill revenge you  
Ill revenge you  
Revenge you  
I found you  
Nobody sees your pain  
Just make sure you dont sell your soul  
Just make sure you dont sell your soul  
Just make sure you dont sell your soul  
  
How long now baby
