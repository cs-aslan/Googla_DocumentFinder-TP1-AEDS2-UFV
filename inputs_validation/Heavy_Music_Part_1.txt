Ahh come on with me baby  
Were gonna have a good time  
Dont you ever listen to the radio  
When the big bad beat comes on  
I know you gotta dig it  
I know you cant stop it  
Cause the bottom comes on so strong  
  
Talkin bout heavy music

Dont you ever feel like goin insane  
When the drums begin to pound  
Aint there ever been a time in your life  
You couldnt believe what the band is puttin down about
