Baby Grace is the victim  
She was 14 years of age  
And the wheels are turning turning  
For the finger points at me  
  
Alls well  
But I have not been to Oxford Town  
Alls well  
No I have not been to Oxford Town  
Toll the bell  
Pay the private eye  
Alls well  
20th century dies  
  
And the prison priests are decent  
My attorney seems sincere  
I fear my days are numbered  
Lord get me out of here  
  
Alls well  
But I have not been to Oxford Town  
Alls well  
But I have not been to Oxford Town  
Toll the bell  
Pay the private eye  
Alls well  
20th century dies  
  
This is your shadow on my wall  
This is my flesh and blood  
This is what I couldve been  
  
And the wheels are turning and turning  
As the 20th century dies  
If I had not ripped the fabric  
If time had not stood still  
If I had not met Ramona  
If Id only paid my bill  
  
Alls well  
But I have not been to Oxford Town  
Alls well  
But I have not been to Oxford Town  
Toll the bell  
Pay the private eye  
Alls well  
20th century dies  
  
This is my bunk with two sheets  
This is my food though foul  
This is what I could have been  
  
Toll the bell  
Pay the private eye  
Alls well  
20th century dies  
Toll the bell  
Pay the private eye  
Alls well  
20th century dies  
Alls well  
20th century dies  
Alls well  
  
Alls well alls well  
Toll the bell  
Pay the private eye  
Alls well  
20th century dies  
Toll the bell  
Pay the private eye  
Alls well  
20th century dies
