If this world were mine  
I would place at your feet  
All that I own  
Youve been so good to me  
If this world were mine  
  
Id give the flowers the birds and the bees  
And itd be your love beside me  
That would be all I need  
If this world were mine  
Id give you anything  
  
If this world were mine  
I would make you a king  
With wealth untold  
You could have anything  
If this world were mine  
  
Id give you each day so sunny and blue  
And if you wanted the moonlight  
Id give you that too  
If this world were mine oh baby
