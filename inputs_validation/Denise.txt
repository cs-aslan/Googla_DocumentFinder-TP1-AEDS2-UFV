Denise Denise  
Gal whats on your mind  
Denise Denise  
Gal whats on your mind  
You got your eyes closed  
Heaven knows that you aint blind  
  
Well I can see you smiling  
But oh your mouth is inside out  
I can see you smiling  
But youre smiling inside out  
Well I know youre laughin  
But what are you laughin about  
  
Well if youre tryin to throw me  
Babe Ive already been tossed  
If youre tryin to throw me  
Babe Ive already been tossed  
Babe youre tryin to lose me  
Babe Im already lost  
  
Well what are you doing  
Are you flying or have you flipped  
Oh what are you doing  
Are you flying or have you flipped  
Well you call my name  
And then say your tongue just slipped  
  
Denise Denise  
Youre concealed here on the shelf  
Denise Denise  
Youre concealed here on the shelf  
Im looking deep in your eyes babe  
And all I can see is myself
