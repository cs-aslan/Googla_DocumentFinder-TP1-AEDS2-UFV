Just ask me once  
Dont ask me twice  
Never ask me three times  
I dont give that much advice  
I took my chance at the first opportunity  
To wander through this world  
And to do what comes so naturally  
Once is enough  
Just ask me once  
Once is enough  
Just ask me once  
  
Sometimes youre first  
Sometimes youre last  
Then again youre somewhere  
In your days of future passed  
If you can find yourself and know just where you are  
Dont let the wind turn you  
Youre stronger than you think you are  
Once is enough  
Just ask me once  
Once is enough  
Just ask me once  
  
Once I was rich  
Once I was poor  
Once I was noone  
I aint noone anymore  
Once in a lifetime theres a chance that comes your way  
Take it with both your hands and be somebody for a day  
Once is enough  
Just ask me once  
Once is enough  
Just ask me once
