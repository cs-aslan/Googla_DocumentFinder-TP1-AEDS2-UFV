  
Its hard to be tied to you  
When your rock keeps is falling down  
Dudududuuu nananana  
Its hard to be tied to you  
When this rock keep falling down  
Dudududuuu nananana  
Out here in the open  
Underneath the sun  
Out here where Im hoping  
Someday youll be the one  
Out here on the open  
I get to keep whats mine  
Its hard to live up to you  
When youre never doing anything wrong  
Dudududuuu nananana  
Its hard to live up to what you think of yourself  
You know youve got to be putting me on  
Dudududuuu nananana  
Out here in the open  
Underneath the sky  
Out here where Im hoping  
I wanna get my wings and fly  
Out here on the open  
I get to speak my miiiiind  
Got to get yourself up right  
So what you finally tell you that youre too uptight  
Hey hey  
Thats what I say  
Youve been working at the carwash way too long  
You know that life is just about another funky song  
Hey hey hey hey thats what you say  
Out here in the open  
Underneath my name  
Somebodys gonna pay attention to me  
Someday everybodys gonna pay attention to me  
And out here in the open I get the chance to shine  
Out here in the open yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah  
Somebodys gonna pay attention to me  
Someday everybodys gonna pay attention to me  
Out here in the open  
I get the chance to shine  
I get the chance to shiiiiiine
