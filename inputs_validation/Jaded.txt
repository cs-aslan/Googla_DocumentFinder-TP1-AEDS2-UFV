Somebody keep my balance  
I think Im falling off  
Into a state of regression  
The expiration date  
Rapidly coming up  
Its leaving me behind to rank  
Always move forward  
Going straight will get you nowhere  
There is no progress  
Evolution killed it all  
I found my place in nowhere  
Im taking one step sideways  
Leading with my crutch  
Got a fucked up equilibrium  
Count down from nine to five  
Hooray Were gonna die  
Blessed into our extinction
