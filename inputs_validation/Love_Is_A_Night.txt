Hangin out in new orleans  
Diggin on the bourbon scenes  
Just feelin the vibes of the oncoming days  
There aint no texan chaparral  
To hide away all those southern belles  
Just thinking about that georgian gal conjures a crazw  
  
Love is a night  
Who really cares if its wrong or its right  
And all that I care  
Youve been some life and love I could share  
  
Got a thing in tennessee  
She aint about to marry me  
Theres never been a time she says yes and means no  
I had a case in carolin  
From makin love on rose wine  
Its strange how they come and they go  
  
Love is a night  
Who really cares if its wrong or its right  
And all that I know  
Youve been some life and love on the road  
  
Love is a night  
I only know the moment is right  
As for the ladies Ive known  
They mean so much when youre all alone
