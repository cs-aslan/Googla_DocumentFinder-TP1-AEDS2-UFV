I feel the blues coming on  
Cause I feel you being gone  
Its something I wish I could lose  
Babys gone blues  
  
There aint no sunshine in sight  
Cause youre gonna leave me tonight  
My heart is sure feeling bruised  
Babys gone blues  
  
Chorus  
Oh love has gone wrong  
Its so hard on my heart going from good into gone  
There aint no easy way back into nights before you  
Babys gone blues  
Babys gone blues  
  
Its like a razor on me  
Knowing you want to be free  
Im standing here feeling used  
Babys gone blues  
  
There aint no dreams coming true  
I wont recover from you  
There aint no heartache like you  
Babys gone blues  
  
Chorus
