Over the mountain  
Down in the valley  
Lives a former talkshow host  
Everybody knows his name  
  
He says theres no doubt about it  
It was the myth of fingerprints  
Ive seen them all and man  
Theyre all the same  
  
Well the sun gets weary  
And the sun goes down  
Ever since the watermelon  
And the lights come up  
  
On the black pit town  
Somebody says whats a better thing to do  
Well its not just me  
And its not just you  
  
This is all around the world  
  
Out in the Indian Ocean somewhere  
Theres a former army post  
Abandoned now just like the war  
And theres no doubt about it  
It was the myth of fingerprints  
Thats what that old army post was for  
  
Well the sun gets bloody  
And the sun goes down  
Ever since the watermelon  
And the lights come up  
  
On the black pit town  
Somebody says whats a better thing to do  
Well its not just me  
And its not just you  
  
This is all around the world  
  
Over the mountain  
Down in the valley  
Lives the former talkshow host  
Far and wide his name was known  
He said theres no doubt about it  
It was the myth of fingerprints  
Thats why we must learn to live alone
