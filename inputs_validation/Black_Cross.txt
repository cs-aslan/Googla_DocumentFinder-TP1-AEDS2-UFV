All I got is a Black Cross  
And two crabs in my left eye  
What you say you want you want  
Like a lump in your right thigh  
  
Were going left on right  
And I dont want to see you again  
Going left on right  
And I dont wanna be your friend  
Were going left on right  
And I dont want to see you again  
Going left on right  
And I dont wanna be your friend  
  
You the users of the wheel  
Stink of oil and electric eels  
Users of forbetten tools  
We must be the fools  
  
Were going left on right  
And I dont want to see you again  
Going left on right  
And I dont wanna be your friend  
Were going left on right  
And I dont want to see you again  
Going left on right  
And I dont wanna be your friend  
  
Cancel the world  
Erase history  
There is no future  
As far as I can see  
  
Were going left on right  
And I dont want to see you again  
Going left on right  
And I dont wanna be your friend  
Were going left on right  
And I dont want to see you again  
Going left on right  
And I dont wanna be your friend
