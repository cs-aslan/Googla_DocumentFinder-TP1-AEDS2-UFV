Wont you let me walk you home from school  
Wont you let me meet you at the pool  
Maybe Friday I can  
Get tickets for the dance  
And Ill take you  
Wont you tell your dad Get off my back  
Tell him what we said bout Paint It Black  
Rock n Roll is here to stay  
Come inside where its okay  
And Ill shake you  
Wont you tell me what youre thinking of  
Would you be an outlaw for my love  
If its so well let me know  
If its no well I can go  
I wont make you
