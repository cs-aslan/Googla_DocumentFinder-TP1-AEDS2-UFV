Its the ones that smoke blunts with ya seen ya picture  
Now they wanna grab a gun and come and getcha  
One time for the homie dj screw  
Already Im feelin throwed in this bitch  
  
Im so high even when Im comin down  
Just met a girl said she from the HTown  
I said my name is Drizzy and aint nobody realer  
A cup inside a cup smokin ghost face killah  
Got these boppers goin crazy  
  
Nigga Im the man I sent your girl message  
Said I see you when I can  
She send me one back but I aint never read it  
Cause pussies only pussy and I get it when I need it and  
  
Im tellin you when homies runnin down in the winter  
And I be riding rims with tires in it thinner  
Air force stun fly charters over seas full of Don Perian  
And the water for the Ds  
  
Dont know why it happens every time we alone  
But here we are again and I swear Im in my zone  
So Ima sip this drink till that motherfucker gone  
Than you go get undressed and we gon get it on  
  
I dont give you the time you deserve from me  
This is something I know I know I know  
So tonight Ill just fuck you like were in Houston  
Taking everything slow so slow so slow but I do it to her  
  
Draped up and dripped out know what Im talkin bout  
Three in the morning get it poppin in the parking lot  
Its on once again and I never pretend  
A nigga stay G till the end yeah  
  
I swear like every time we find ourself in this situation  
I just get that feeling like I mean Houston candy paint  
Switching colors in the light its about like 11 P M  
And you just roaming through the city bumpin that screw  
  
Big Mo ugk Lil Keke  
It feel like everything just moving slow  
Lets take my time I pace it baby  
Yeah Im gone
