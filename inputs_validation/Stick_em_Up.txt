Until there was you we didnt know what to do but I dont give a fuck about
the things that I blew  
Sucker MC dont you love me want to have me want to que me one two three
Its just a modest proposal from a boy antisocial scraping the skin of our
culture civilized vulture Do me in dont make me sin Im doing so good I
cant go through it again  
  
I bomb the mic like a fascist Mussolini comin through with no remorse from
the dark you wont see me Rise up from the sea like a godzilla straight up
through your mind with my armour plated drilla I dont give a fuck what you
think about this shit aint in it for the money never out to make a hit If
you cant take it like I said get a grip cause Im here to fucking stay like
the warts on your dick  
  
Stick em up  
  
So wont you make a man out of me Ive gotta be connected computerized son
of a bitch makes me itch sucker for life I cant decide darkness or light
or just a heavenly fright Stick it Im tired Im bored Im trying so hard
and I cant be adored So the sound brakes through from one tone gives me no
choice I cant be alone  
  
Stick em up  
  
Like Darth Vader I surprise you with my skills I knock your ol ass out like
a bag of sleeping pills I got to rip things up like my name was Jack the
Ripper Theres a party at your house cause your mama is a stripper Slice
through the scene like a knife through peanut butter Get your ears cleaned
out motherfucker I didnt stutter S W A R E Z I got this whole thing
right down to a T  
  
Stick em up
