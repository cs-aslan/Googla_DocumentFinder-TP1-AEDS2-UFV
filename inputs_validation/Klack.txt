Strong Arm Steady we ready its time to ball out  
When vocal chords spit cold shit they never thaw out  
Industry tried to pigeonhole I had to crawl out  
Hear my name bein called out nuclear fallout  
Full body armor with bangers we goin all out  
Garbage bags in trunk of the car it wont stall out  
Hit you where you stay hogtied you gettin hauled out  
Crush the whole car its well planned and thought out  
Try to attain fame from beef you went the wrong route  
Scrape a 38 on your teeth I knock em all out  
I know you aint fuckin with me dawg cmon NOW  
Underestimate run up on its on now  
Have your niggaz plottin revenge and puttin songs out  
Demise by design blueprints is drawn out  
Flood crack back in the hood its been a long drought  
Show you what this gangster killa Cali is all about  
  
Chorus  repeat 2X  
KLACK  for the niggaz that bang in the inner city and  
KLACK  for the enemies creepin to come and get me  
Be thankful if you get away alive  
You wouldnt kill or wont let nothin die so keep it movin  
  
Xzibit  
Yo You dont like how Im livin well FUCK YOU  
Nastradamus style make every line come through  
Dont make me spit predict your last action  
Last man standin yeah last man laughin yeah  
Assassin crosshairs smile for the birdie CLICK  
Hit you long range high powered 3030 shit  
If you never heard of a heavy assault rifle  
Hit targets a mile away from the top of the Eiffel woo  
Knock the soul out of your body stay plottin like Bin Laden  
to swoop down and crash your party  
All bark no bite SHIIIT we dont bark nigga  
We bite to the white then shake til the afterlife  
Hard work and sacrifice whos your daddy  
Make you want to drop erything and move to Cali  
We classic go head speak my name  
And Ima lay your ass down like the All Star game cmon  
  
Chorus  
  
possibly Strong Arm  uncredited  
Sawedoff shotgun shoot through your shoulderblade  
Bitchmade niggaz get hit with a hand grenade  
Blow up your Escalade then I hit the road  
and Im back in the hood lookin for somethin to smoke  
Everytime I use the element of surprise  
With a gun thats big enough to make an elephant hide  
I elevate my rhythm by hustlin crack addicts  
Get locked but when Im released Im back at it  
See Mitch know the time in front of me the birdie and  
Phil got the customers comin to get it early we  
came a long way from police chasin us  
for dope in our socks and angel dust  
Yeah klack for the strippers in clubs shakin they titties  
This macll have you bitch niggaz runnin like P Diddy  
Ill bang you comin out the side of your mouth  
We the reason why you stay in the house Stizzle Gang  
  
Chorus  
  
unimportant ad libs to end
