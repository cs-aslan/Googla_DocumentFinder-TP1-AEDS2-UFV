Theres a time and place everywhere I go  
Where the river meets the sea  
Somewhere between the gates of dreams  
And the turning of the key  
Theres a cutting edge theres a real fine line  
And its caught in come and go  
And youre leaving what you thought you knew  
To what youve come to know  
When the twilight turns at the end of day  
And the angels kiss the moon  
Theres a diamond sun everywhere she goes  
And there aint no other way  
Im gonna dream tonight  
By that pale moonlight  
Till the morning comes my way  
  
Im walking tall  
And Im walking fine  
And Im up there  
With that girl of mine  
  
And Im standing in the twilight now  
Yeah Im standing by her side  
Oh Im gazing in that gate of dreams  
Underneath that midnight sky  
Cause theres a diamond sun everywhere she goes  
And there aint no other way  
Im gonna dream tonight  
By that pale moonlight  
Till the morning comes my way  
  
Im walking tall  
And Im walking fine  
And Im up there  
With that girl of mine
