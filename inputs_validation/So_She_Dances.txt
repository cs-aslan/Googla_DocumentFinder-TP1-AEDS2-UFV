A waltz when she walks in the room  
She pulls back the hair from her face  
She turns to the window  
To sway in the moonlight  
Even her shadow has grace  
  
A waltz for the girl out of reach  
She lifts her hands up to the sky  
She moves with the music  
The song is her lover  
The melodys making her cry  
  
So she dances  
In and out of the crowd like a glance  
This romance is from afar  
Calling me silently  
  
A waltz for the chance I should take  
But how will I know where to start  
Shes spinning between  
Constellations and dreams  
Her rhythm is my beating heart  
  
So she dances  
In and out of the crowd like a glance  
This romance is from afar  
Calling me silently  
  
I cant keep on watching forever  
I give up this view just to tell her  
  
When I close my eyes I can see  
The spotlights are bright on you and me  
Weve got the floor  
And youre in my arms  
How could I ask for more  
  
So she dances  
In and out of the crowd like a glance  
This romance is from afar  
Calling me silently  
  
I cant keep on watching forever  
And Im giving up this view just to tell her
