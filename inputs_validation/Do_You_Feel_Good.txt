When we were lovers you called me names  
But time goes on and you were gone  
I got told you youre a big shot for the ties  
And take it from behind  
  
Now you took a new flat in a different town  
And rumors are youre wealthy now  
For that high class dress shows you earn well  
Where strangers come and go  
  
Do you feel good do you feel fine  
Did you achieve what you had in mind  
Do you live cool not too confined  
What can you tell this old heart of mine  
  
Some busty companion claims to know you well  
Does night shift at some place somewhere  
Said theres no one who has fun your way  
In Moscow Rome LA  
  
I wish I knew  
Jolly understand  
And you never call  
  
Do you feel good do you feel fine  
Did you achieve what you had in mind  
Do you live cool not too confined  
What can you tell this old heart of mine  
  
Well I got no objections  
Im old enough you know  
But its weird this night I seem to know you  
Better than before  
  
Do you feel good do you feel fine  
Did you achieve what you had in mind  
Do you live cool not too confined  
What can you tell this old heart of mine
