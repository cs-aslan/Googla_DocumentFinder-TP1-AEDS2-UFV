Dont burn the pig  
Throw it in the water again  
See if it float or sink  
Dont burn the pig  
  
What Will Become of Me  
Disputed Between A Song And An Outro Of Jimi Thing  
I was falling always  
And now Im falling this way  
What will become of me  
When Im all far away  
  
Im spinnning down  
Im spinning up  
Upon this way  
Wondering what will become of me  
When Im all far way  
  
Im spinning down  
Im all away  
A greater way  
  
What Will Become of Me
