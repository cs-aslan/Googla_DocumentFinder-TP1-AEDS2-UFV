When we start adancing Im a nervous wreck  
Your kinda shaking has a rare effect  
I cant stop aflipping over what youre doing  
That kinda beat can drive a man to ruin  
Slow down baby can ya hear me shout  
Stop Youre knockin me out  
  
Crazy bout your rhythm when youre rocknrolling  
All Im asking honey is that you control it  
Your dancing is entrancing oh yes indeedy  
But my one objection is youre much too speedy  
Slow down baby can ya hear me shout  
Stop Youre knockin me out  
  
We go dancing and everything is fine  
Were romancing the music is divine  
Then the band starts to syncopate  
You jump from thirty three to seventy eight  
  
Spinning like a record on a record machine  
Youve got me going dizzy over your routine  
The way ya shake your shoulders and the way ya twist em  
Starts a chain reaction in my nervous system  
Slow down baby can ya hear me shout  
Stop Youre knockin me out  
  
Oh now we go dancing everything is fine  
Were romancing the music is divine  
Then the band starts to syncopate  
You jump from thirty three to seventy eight  
  
Spinning like a record on a record machine  
Youve got me going dizzy over your routine  
The way ya shake your shoulders and the way ya twist em  
Starts a chain reaction in my nervous system  
Slow down baby can ya hear me shout  
Stop Youre knockin me out  
Slow down baby can ya hear me shout  
Stop
