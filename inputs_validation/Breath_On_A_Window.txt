I mending fence along the road  
Barely holding together  
Mapless zone the road signs holes  
Keep ahead of the weather  
Long past time to close dead eyes  
Find a break in the highway  
Out here Im invisible  
Very few going my way  
  
Breath on a window showing tic tac toe  
Rear view reflecting there aint nobody home  
  
Ghost town strip of misery  
I aint feeling no better  
Road kill heart inside of me  
Follow it to the letter  
Sundown brings a welcome change  
Everything thats hiding  
More at home in landscapes strange  
Are you selling Im buying  
  
Breath on a window showing tic tac toe  
Rear view reflecting there aint nobody home  
Cigarette burn holes outline an old soul  
Connect the dot scribbling  
And you would never know  
  
Failed to heed the signal  
Thought you got through just in time  
Crashing hard upon your ego  
Penetrated from the side  
  
Id let you go but youre always in the way  
Im the damage done your scar of yesterday  
  
Id love to go but youre always in the way  
Im the damage done your scar of yesterday  
  
Id love to go but youre always in the way  
Im the damage done your scar of yesterday  
  
Id love to go but youre always in the way  
Im the damage done your scar of yesterday  
  
Id love to go but youre always in the way  
Im the damage done your scar of yesterday
