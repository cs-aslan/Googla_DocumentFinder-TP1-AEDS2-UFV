Take a litle walk to the edge of town  
Go across the tracks  
Where the viaduct looms  
Like a bird of doom  
As it shifts and cracks  
Where secrets lie in the border fires  
In the humming wires  
Hey man you know  
Youre never coming back  
Past the square past the bridge  
Past the mills past the stacks  
On a gathering storm comes  
A tall handsome man  
In a dusty black coat with  
A red right hand  
  
Hell wrap you in his arms  
Tell you that youve been a good boy  
Hell rekindle all the dreams  
It took you a lifetime to destroy  
Hell reach deep into the hole  
Heal your shrinking soul  
Hey buddy you know youre  
Never ever coming back  
Hes a god hes a man  
Hes a ghost hes a guru  
Theyre whispering his name  
Through this disappearing land  
But hidden in his coat  
Is a red right hand  
  
You aint got no money  
Hell get you some  
You aint got no car Hell get you one  
You aint got no selfrespect  
You feel like an insect  
Well dont you worry buddy  
Cause here he comes  
Through the ghettos and the barrio  
And the bowery and the slum  
A shadow is cast wherever he stands  
Stacks of green paper in his  
Red right hand  
  
Organ solo  
  
Youll see him in your nightmares  
Youll see him in your dreams  
Hell appear out of nowhere but  
He aint what he seems  
Youll see him in your head  
On the tv screen  
And hey buddy Im warning  
You to turn it off  
Hes a ghost hes a god  
Hes a man hes a guru  
Youre one microscopic cog  
In his catastrophic plan  
Designed and directed by  
His red right hand  
  
Organ solo  
  
Extra verse from dj Spooky Remix From Scream 2 Soundtrack  
Hell extend his hand real slowly for a shake  
Youll see it coming toward you real slowly for a shake  
Grabbing at your peril buddy cause you know you aint  
Getting near much as he will take  
  
Hes a  
  
Hes mumbling words you cant understand  
Hes mumbling word behind his red right hand
