I havent fucked much with the past  
But Ive fucked plenty with the future  
Over the skin of silk are scars  
From the splinters of stations and walls Ive caressed  
  
A stage is like each bolt of wood  
Like a like a log of Helen is my pleasure  
I would measure the success of a night by the way by the way I  
By the amount of piss and seed I could exude  
Over the columns that nestled the PA  
  
Some nights Id surprise everybody by skipping off  
With a skirt of green net sewed over  
With flat metallic circles which dazzled and flashed  
The lights were violet and Incomprehensible white  
I had an ornamental veil I cant bear to use it  
  
With the way my hair was cropped I craved craved covering  
But now that my hair itself is a veil  
And the scalp inside is a scalp of a crazy  
And a sleepy Comanche lies beneath this netting of skin  
  
I wake up I am lying peacefully  
I am lying peacefully and my knees are open to the sun  
I desire him and he is absolutely ready to seize me  
In in in in in heart I am a Muslim in heart I am an American  
In heart I am Muslim in heart Im an American artist and I have no guilt  
  
I seek pleasure I seek the nerves under your skin  
The narrow archway the layers the scroll of ancient lettuce  
We worship the flaw the belly the belly  
The mole on the belly of an exquisite whore  
He spared the child and spoiled the rod  
I have not sold myself to God
