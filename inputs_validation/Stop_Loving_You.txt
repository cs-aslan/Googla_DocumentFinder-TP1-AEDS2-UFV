Reflections in my mind thoughts I cant define  
My heart is racing and the night goes on  
I can almost hear a laugh coming from your photograph  
Funny how a look can share a thousand meanings  
Well intended lies contemplating alibis  
Is it really you or is it me Im blaming  
A distant memory flashes over me  
Even though youre gone I feel you deep inside  
  
Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes  
  
Chorus  
I cant stop loving you time passes quickly and chances are few  
I wont stop till Im through loving you girl  
  
Theres a window in a heart Ive tried to look through from the start  
Youre never really sure what someone else is thinking  
Someones broken something new another altered point of view  
Just a certain someones conscience playing  
  
I held it in my hand I did not understand  
What lives inside the wind that cries her name  
Tried to catch a shooting star what seems so close cant be that far  
Im living in a dream thats never ending  
  
Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes  
  
Chorus  
  
Dancing with that look thats in your eyes  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant stop loving you time passes quickly and chances are few  
I wont stop till Im through loving you loving you
