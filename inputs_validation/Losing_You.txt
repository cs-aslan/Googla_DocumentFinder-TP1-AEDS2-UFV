Teardrops tell me that Im losing you  
Lost and lonely and Im losing you  
Dreams remind me that Im losing you  
Heartaches find me and Im losing you  
  
If you could forget that love affair  
I wonder  
If you could how much would you still care  
  
Its no use now for Im losing you  
No excuse now yes Im losing you  
I love you much more than yesterday  
In sorrow  
I love you less than tomorrow  
I love you with all my love today  
But I guess I threw your love away  
Im losing you  
What can I do  
I dont want to but Im losing you
