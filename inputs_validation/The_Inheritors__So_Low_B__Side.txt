Brother dont lose that firestick no way  
The night is coming thin  
Might tire to light that stick  
Brother dont lose that stick no way  
  
Dont lose that heating fork no way  
Dark    s coming down  
Need someone to eat off the ground  
Need something to eat     today  
  
Brother dont lose your bares no way  
Dont know which side were on  
Blue then its green then its brown  
Mines hard and its red and its coming my way  
  
We all be together  
And we all turn the same land  
And if the man cant be the child  
Then the devil will take the man  
  
Get you behind me quick  
Hey brother dont lose that stick  
Need something to light my way today  
  
Brother dont start no slowing down today  
Come here with your big ideas  
Shooting inbetween your ears  
Come here with your big ideas today
