They say he didnt have an enemy  
His was a greatness to behold  
He was the last surviving progeny  
The last one on this side of the world  
He measured half a mile from tip to tail  
silver and black with powerful fins  
They say he could split a mountain in two  
Thats how we got the Grand Canyon  
Some say they saw him at the Great Lakes  
Some say they saw him off the coast of Florida  
My mother said she saw him in Chinatown  
but you cant always trust your mother  
Off the Carolinas the sun shines brightly in the day  
The lighthouse glows ghostly there are night  
The chief of a local tribe had killed a racist mayors son  
and hed been on death row since 1958  
The mayors kid was a rowdy pig  
spit on Indians and lots worse  
The old chief buried a hatchet in his head  
life compared to death for him seemed worse  
The tribal brothers gathered in the lighthouse to sing  
and tried to conjure up a storm or rain  
The harbor parted and the great whale sprang full up  
and caused a huge tidal wave  
The wave crushed the jail and freed the chief  
The tribe let out a roar  
The whites were drowned  
the browns and reds set free  
but sadly one thing more  
Some local yokel member of the NRA  
kept a bazooka in his living room  
and thinking he had the chief in his sights  
blew the whales brains out with a lead harpoon  
Well Americans dont care for much of anything  
land and water the least  
And animal life is low on the totem pole  
with human life not worth much more than infected yeast  
Americans dont care too much for beauty  
Theyll shit in a river dump battery acid in a stream  
Theyll watch dead rats wash up on the beach  
and complain if they cant swim  
They say things are done for the majority  
Dont believe half of what you see  
and none of what you hear  
Its a lot like what my painter friend Donald said to me  
Stick a fork in their ass and turn them over theyre done
