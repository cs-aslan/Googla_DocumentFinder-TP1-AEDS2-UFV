ZRo  
Since I been out by myself I keep that bitch Nina with me  
If you my enemy you dont want to be the last nigga that seen her with me  
ZRo haters be making my attitude rude  
Fuck around and get stole on if you fuck up my moves  
Dude finally I found myself I had to stop  
Blowing that kick em cause eventually I would of drowned myself  
Already need a anger management class  
See if a busta cross me it dont matter the situation I damage his ass  
Soldier thats what I be so bitch  
Why you trying to play me like a HOE  
Turn me loose so I can make it to the TOP  
Its like Im in a bucket full of seeareAbe s but I keep climbing  
And I keep on rhyming while they be bumping they gums  
Looking at my diamonds whining and blinding no dumping they guns  
Cause they cant see me bitch Im invisible to the hate  
Thugged off in my kitchen cutting chemicals in my cakes  
Chorus  
Talking down on me from a safe place now Im in your face  
What you gon do now  
Barrettas and Rugas on my person they would do ya if I burst em  
What you gon do now  
Mo City my block showing no pity for cops if you trespass  
You done fucked up now  
No busting in the sky first one through your thigh second ones a chest blast  
I done lucked you out now  
ZRo  
Niggas be cool in my face but hate behind my back  
Talk down on me in front of me but not behind my gat  
I bet you wont do that I bet you scared of that iron  
Perpetrating like you a gorilla selling drinks in line  
You aint never seen the Pen nigga the penitentiary  
They talk rehabilitation but look at what it did to me  
I smoke mo and sip mo than ever before  
Motherfuckers be on my nerves so I lean on that dro  
Trying to keep on dropping a bomb on the bitchmade  
Dont be looking surprised yall made it this way  
I got a Vendetta with lifts that be trying to sink me  
Sending police after me and trying to link me  
To aggravated robbery and strongarm jacking  
Trying to throw me off my note so I cant do no stacking  
Johnny Cochran over lawyer got me out on bail  
Looking for niggas that was plotting on receiving my mail  
Chorus  2x
