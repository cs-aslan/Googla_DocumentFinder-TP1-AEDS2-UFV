Hey Now  
Im speaking once again  
Oh yeah  
My name is in your head  
So strange  
These people that you have  
Thats right my friend  
Its all just where youre at  
This is how I like to play  
This is how I feel these days  
This is how I like to play  
This is how I feel these days  
Take me  
Conceal me where you like  
You will see it open  
From within I will rise  
Like seasons  
Your flavour will die  
On and on these people  
Theyll listen every time  
This is how I like to play  
This is how I feel these days  
This is how I like to play  
This is how I feel these days
