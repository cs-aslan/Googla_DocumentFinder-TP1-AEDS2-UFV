This old town is filled with sin  
Itll swallow you in  
If youve got some money to burn  
So Take it home right away  
Youve got three years to pay  
But Satan is waiting his turn  
  
This old earthquakes gonna leave me in the poor house  
It seems like this whole towns insane  
On the thirtyfirst floor a gold plated door  
Wont keep out the Lords burning rain  
  
The scientists say  
Itll all wash away  
But we dont believe any more  
Cause weve got our recruits  
And our green mohair suits  
So please show you ID At the door  
  
This old earthquakes gonna leave me in the poor house  
It seems like this whole towns insane  
On the thirtyfirst floor a gold plated door  
Wont keep out the Lords burning rain  
  
A friend came around  
Tried to clean up this town  
His ideas made some people mad  
Cause he trusted his crowd  
So he spoke right out loud  
And they lost the best friend they had  
  
This old earthquakes gonna leave me in the poor house  
It seems like this whole towns insane  
On the thirtyfirst floor a gold plated door  
Wont keep out the Lords burning rain  
  
On the thirtyfirst floor a gold plated door  
Wont keep out the Lords burning rain  
  
On the thirtyfirst floor a gold plated door  
Wont keep out the Lords burning rain
