Well I cant control the universe  
cause I am only a man  
And Ive been in the papers but they wont tell me who I am  
And if you really need a new philosophie  
well theres one that makes sense  
The one I profess  
  
Chorus  
I say hey whatever  
Let your beauty come alive  
Let your colour fill the sky  
And say hey whatever  
Why dont you liberate your mind  
Let your colour fill the sky  
  
All the worlds in waiting room  
And were standing in line  
I found the answer to the question  
What makes this time  
Oh wont let them change your story  
wont let them change your thought  
so let the gurus and philophers hit you on  
  
Chorus  
Hey Whatever  
Let your beauty come alive  
Let your color fill the sky  
And say hey whatever  
Why dont you liberate your mind  
Let your colour fill the sky  
  
So I am taking a seat at the roulette thing  
Weve just been in a wheel  
Should I bet or take what comes  
Dont change how I feel  
Youre a champion of science  
Youre just some freak show fool  
What cannot be proved no no can still be true  
  
Chorus  
And I say hey whatever  
Let your beauty come alive  
Let your colour fill the sky  
And say hey whatever  
Why dont you liberate your mind  
Let your colour fill the sky  
Hey whatever  
Let your beauty come alive  
Let your colour fill the sky  
And say hey whatever  
Why dont you liberate your mind  
Let your colour fill the sky  
  
Aaaahh  
Hey whatever
