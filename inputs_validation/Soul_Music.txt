You came into my life I dont have to wonder no more  
I can feel it all in my soul  
Its soul music its deep down in my soul feel the burn  
I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul  
Its deep down in my soul its soul music  
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul  
Its deep down in my soul  
Yo first took breath in Hemstead Long Island  
Born American ancestry from Ireland  
You aint knowin me you better stop smilin  
Aint nothin funny once my dummies start whilin  
You talkin loud now all a sudden its silent  
Your premenitions say its about to get violent  
You want permission just to blink your own eyelid  
I got my soldiers everywhere they go I win  
No stick moves aint no cap peeling  
Where I come from real men dont catch feelings  
We dont rhyme about fake jacks or drug dealin  
The shit I drop will leave all your brains on the ceiling  
Mass appealin done it since the 80s  
Rock rhymes for my dogs sing songs for my ladies  
Spend money like crazy aint got no babies  
If I dont make it in Heaven Ill run shit in Hades  
Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul  
Its deep down in my soul its soul music  
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul  
Its in my soul soul music  
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul  
Its deep down in my soul soul music  
Tryin to find an explanation deep down in my soul  
Its deep down in my soul  
Yo I shit on competition spit on percussion  
Beats are bone crushin one deep Im bum rushin  
Guns they get stuck in someone starts buckin  
The jewels that Im truckin got pimps upchuckin  
You cant hold me down you cant hold my hand  
A full grown man with the one God plan  
I represent the colors that never run  
God bless DMC God bless Reverend Run  
RIP for the JMJ  
Tell BIG and Scott LaRock that we all say hey  
Be like 2Pac or be like Kid N Play  
Do you want to burn out or just fade away  
And I can rock the mic without no delay  
With my head to the ground everytime I pray  
You can catch a heart attack or get blown away  
Cause this type of shit happens everyday  
Feel the burn I can feel it in my soul  
Its soul music its deep down in my soul  
Feel the burn its in my soul  
Its soul music its deep down in my soul feel the burn  
Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul  
Its deep down in my soul its soul music  
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul  
Its in my soul soul music  
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul  
Its deep down in my soul soul music  
Tryin to find an explanation deep down in my soul  
Its deep down in my soul feel the burn
