He sees her at the same time every night  
At the Mexican discotheque  
She gives him french kisses  
He gives her french cigarettes  
They sit at the same table every time  
The lights are low  
But their eyes shine  
Just digging the music  
From those sweet soul bands  
  
She keeps him outta fights  
Holds on to his hand  
He whispers slowly tonights the night  
Months of planning so its gotta be right  
Under the table her bag is busting at the seams  
She made sure to bring everything  
  
Moonlighting theyre leaving everything  
Moonlighting theyre losing all their friends  
Moonlighting its the only way  
Its frightening but it means theyll stay  
Together theyre gonna make it together  
  
His blue Morris van is parked in an alley  
Just by Montague street  
His friend Eddie he did the respray  
So he couldnt drive it all last week  
And it cost most of the money  
That he had saved up  
To pay Eddies receipt  
But he figures its worth it  
Cause the disguise is a must  
When they go missing  
Theyre gonna look for the van first  
She whispers slowly itll be alright  
I took some cash from my building society  
And my monthly check came in just right  
If only they knew they werent giving it away  
  
915 Monday morning at the printing works  
The boss notices someones not clocked in  
And the water department  
Of the council offices has a message  
That Mrs Parks daughter is missing  
Meanwhile the Carlisle turnoff of the m6 motorway  
Drinking cold black coffee eating hot cup cakes  
She stares at him with his beard unshaved  
Wonders at his powers of staying awake  
He whispers slowly you did just fine  
They shared the driving all through the night  
She laughs my mother will have lost her mind  
Were only ten miles to Gretna  
Theyre three hundred behind
