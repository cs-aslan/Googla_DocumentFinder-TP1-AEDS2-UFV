Poured the goldfish bowl into daddys hat  
Then I painted stripes on the family cat  
Broke two teeth only yesterday  
Im the angel in the Christmas play  
  
In department stores do it just because  
Pull the whiskers off of the Santy Claus  
I bite his leg and I run away  
Im the angel in the Christmas play  
  
Daddy laughs he bends in half  
When I wear angel hair  
But wait until he takes a spill  
My halos on the stair  
  
Well I gotta go before the mailman stops  
And he feels that glue in the letter box  
See you all when its Christmas Day  
Im the angel in the Christmas play  
  
Made a snowman holding a Christmas wreath  
Used my grandpas specs and my grandmas teeth  
Cut the hair off my dads toupee  
Im the angel in the Christmas play  
  
And in school today brought a jar of ants  
You should see my teacher do a dance  
Hope she dont take my part away  
Im the angel in the Christmas play  
  
I put on my angel gown  
And boy did momma laugh  
She didnt guess it was her best dress  
The one I cut in half  
  
On the roof today gave em all a scare  
I put on my wings tried to fly through the air  
Hope that bumps gonna go away  
Im the angel in the Christmas play
