Hope you didnt burn too many bridges  
On your way back to haunt my heart  
Cause its safe behind these stones and ridges  
You know how us healin victims are  
I take comfort where I find it  
In the neon and the crowds  
I guess someone like me designed it  
This place where old flames arent allowed  
  
Chorus  
Theres a border you can cross  
Theres a wall that you can climb  
The space is drawn too wide  
Between your world and mine  
Youre already broke my heart  
And I won let you break my mind  
As far as your memory goes  
Thats where I draw the line  
  
Ill bet this isnt how you planned it  
Ive picked myself up off the ground  
These legs are shakin but theye standin  
And I won let you knock me down  
  
Chorus  
  
Thats where I draw the line
