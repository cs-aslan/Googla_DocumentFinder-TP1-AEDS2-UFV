Id cry like a baby if you told me goodbye  
Id feel like a snowball on the fourth of July  
If you ever said you were leaving for good  
Id weep like a weeping willow honest I would  
  
Id cry like a baby with a busted balloon  
Id let out a wail that would be heard on the moon  
Our love was so splendid dont end it so soon  
Dont leave me here sighing asobbing and asighing  
Crying like a baby for you

Crying like a baby for you
