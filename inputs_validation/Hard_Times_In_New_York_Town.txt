Come you ladies and you gentlemen alisten to my song  
Sing it to you right but you might think its wrong  
Just a little glimpse of a story Ill tell  
Bout an east coast city that you all know well  
  
Its hard times in the city  
Livin down in New York town  
  
Old new york city is a friendly old town  
From Washington heights to Harlem on down  
Theres amighty many people all millin all around  
Theyll kick you when youre up and knock you when youre down  
  
Its hard times in the city  
Livin down in New York town  
  
Its a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate  
To Rockefeller plaza n the Empire State  
Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird  
Old mister empire never says a word  
  
Its hard times from the country  
Livin down in New York town  
  
Well its up in the mornin tryin to fins a job of work  
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt  
If you go a lot o money you can make yourself merry  
If you only got a nickel its the Staten island ferry  
  
And its hard times in the city  
Livin down in New York town  
  
Mister Hudson come asailin down the stream  
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream  
Bought your city on a oneway track  
If I had my way Id sell it right back  
  
And its hard times in the city  
Livin down in New York town  
  
Ill take all the smog in California  
N every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains  
N the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines  
Its all much cleaner than the New York kind  
  
And its hard times in the city  
Livin down in New York town  
  
So all you newsy people spreadin the news around  
You seen listen to m story listen to m song  
You seen step on my name you seen try n get me beat  
When I leave New York Ill be standin on my feet  
  
Hard times in the city  
Livin down in New York town
