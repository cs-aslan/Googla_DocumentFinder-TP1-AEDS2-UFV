Why should I care  
If I have to cut my hair  
Ive got to move with the fashions  
Or be outcast  
I know I should fight  
But my old man hes really alright  
And Im still living at home  
Even though it wont last  
  
Zoot suit white jacket with side vents  
Five inches long  
Im out on the street again  
And Im leaping along  
Im dressed right for a beach fight  
But I just cant explain  
Why that uncertain feeling is still  
Here in my brain  
  
The kids at school  
Have parents that seem so cool  
And though I dont want to hurt them  
Mine want me their way  
I clean my room and my shoes  
But my mother found a box of blues  
And there doesnt seem much hope  
Theyll let me stay  
  
Zoot suit etc  
Why do I have to be different to them  
Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend  
We have the same old row again and again  
Why do I have to move with a crowd  
Of kids that hardly notice Im around  
I have to work myself to death just to fit in  
  
Im coming down  
Got home on the very first train from town  
My dad just left for work  
He wasnt talking  
Its all a game  
Cause inside Im just the same  
My fried egg makes me sick  
First thing in the morning
