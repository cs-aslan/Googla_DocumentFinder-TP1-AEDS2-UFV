Drug stabbing time  
Well I got working on the Ford line  
A paying off the big fine  
Drug stabbin time  
  
Drug stabbin time  
Is from nine to nine  
Nobody wants a user  
Nobody needs a loser  
So kick him out that door  
An dont answer it no more  
  
Drug stabbin time  
Its a Greenwich Mean Time  
Your friends all hate each other you think  
Youve got another  
But whos at the door  
Dont answer it no more  
  
Drug stabbin time  
In a bedroom crime  
Theres a tape recording on a telephone line  
An its ringin from the floor  
So dont answer it no more  
  
Now I was lying in my room  
It was raining drugs all afternoon  
I hear this car pull up outside  
Comes to a stop like skreeee  
  
Someones in a hurry  
N someone better worry  
Cos these four guys all had on their feet  
A pair of black shoes shining and neat  
I thinks  
  
Black shoes on  
No thats bad news  
Here they come charging up the stairs alright  
Sonny just tell us where  
  
Drug stabbin time  
Dont ask me mate  
Working on the ford line  
Paying off the big fine  
Drug stabbin time
