Forty detectives this week  
Forty detectives strong  
Takin a stroll down love street  
Strollin is that so wrong  
Can I get my codependant  
  
Hump de bump doop bodu  
Bump de hump doop bop  
Hump de bump doop bodu  
  
Oh no  
  
Bump de hump doop bodu  
Hump de bump doop bop  
Bump de hump doop bodu  
  
Bump bump  
  
It must have been a hundred miles  
Or any of a hundred styles  
Its not about the smile you wear but  
The way we make out  
  
When I was an allaloner  
Nothing but a twobeach comber  
Anybody seen the sky Im  
Im wide awake now  
  
Workin the beat as we speak  
Workin the belle du monde  
Believe in the havoc we wreak  
Believin is that so wrong  
Can I get my codependant  
  
Hump de bump doop bodu  
Bump de hump doop bop  
Hump de bump doop bodu  
  
Bump de hump doop bodu  
Hump de bump doop bop  
Bump de hump doop bodu  
  
Bump bump  
  
Cmon  
  
It must have been a hundred miles  
Any of a hundred styles  
Its not about the smile you wear but  
The way we make out  
  
When I was an allaloner  
Nothing but a twobeach comber  
Anybody seen the sky Im  
Im wide awake now

Listenin to what I said  
And try to get it through your head  
A little bit of circumstance and  
A chance to make out  
  
Livin in a citadel  
Its hard enough to be yourself  
Waiting for the bell to toll and  
Im wide awake now  
  
It must have been a hundred miles  
Or any of a hundred styles  
Its not about the smile you wear but  
The way we make out  
  
When I was an allaloner  
Nothing but a twobeach comber  
Anybody seen the sky Im  
Im wide awake now
