Im out of my mind  
And its only over you  
Im out of my mind  
And its only over you  
People think Im crazy  
  
But they dont know  
Thought love had failed me  
But now theyre watching it grow  
Angel please dont go  
I miss you when youre gone  
They say Im a silly girl  
  
But Im not a fool  
People say they know me  
But they dont see  
My hearts your future  
Your future is me  
Angel please dont go  
I miss you when youre gone  
They say Im a silly girl  
  
But Im not a fool  
Im out of my mind  
And its only over you  
Im out of my mind  
And its only over you
