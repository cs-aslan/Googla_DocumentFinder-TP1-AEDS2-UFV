Whats so wrong  
Why the face so long  
Is it over  
And where you going that  
You no longer belong here  
And distance tells you that  
Distance must come between love  
Where have you been luv  
When the mistake we made  
Was in never having planned to fall in love luv  
  
Singing this song  
Singing along  
Makes it easier for me to see you go  
But in doing so  
Im letting you go  
It only serves to show me  
That Im still in love with you  
  
Singing this song

So whats so wrong  
Why the face  
So long  
Are you changing  
And where you been to that  
You no longer remember  
And distance tells you that  
Distance must come between love  
Where have you been luv  
  
Its just the chance we took  
Having never planned to fall in love luv  
Having never planned to fall in love luv  
Having never planned to fall in love luv  
Luv
