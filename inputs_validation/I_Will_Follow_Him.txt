I will follow Him  
Follow Him wherever He may go  
And near Him I always will be  
For nothing can keep me away  
He is my destiny  
  
I will follow Him  
Ever since He touched my heart I knew  
There isnt an ocean too deep  
A mountain so high it can keep  
Keep me away away from His love  
  
I love Him I love Him I love Him  
And where He goes  
Ill follow Ill follow Ill follow  
  
I will follow Him  
Follow Him wherever He may go  
There isnt an ocean too deep  
A mountain so high it can keep  
Keep me away away from His love  
  
I love Him  
Oh yes I love Him  
Ill follow  
Im gonna follow  
True love  
Hell always be my true true love  
Forever  
Now until forever  
I love Him I love Him I love Him  
And where He goes  
Ill follow Ill follow Ill follow  
Hell always be my true love  
My true love my true love  
From now until forever  
Forever forever  
  
There isnt an ocean too deep  
A mountain so high it can keep  
Keep me away away from His love
