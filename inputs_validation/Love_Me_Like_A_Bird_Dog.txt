Savin all your money  
For a rainy day limousine  
Teenage baby send you  
Full friction magazine  
I dont know how she do it  
  
Up down turnaround  
Four on the floor tonight  
When she did what she was doin  
She was rubbin me the wrong way right  
Push come to shove  
Give it one more try  
Dont miss your water  
Until the well runs dry  
  
Love Me Like A Birddog  
Never Learn to Fly  
  
Bareback baby  
Tell me whats on your mind  
If its the same old same old  
Slap you on the back behind  
I dont know how you do it  
Tell me one time  
About how it used to be  
You got the judge and jury  
Swinging from the highest tree  
Push came to shove  
Give it one more try  
Dont miss your water  
Until the well runs dry  
  
Love Me Like a Bird Dog  
Never learn to fly  
Ask me no questions  
Ill tell you no lies  
  
Love Me Like a Bird Dog  
Never learn to fly  
Ask me no questions  
  
Bass drum beating  
Like a hot damn house on fire  
Love lovers quarrels  
Always seem to make the body cry  
I dont know how she do it  
Tell me one time  
About how it used to be  
She got the judge and jury  
Swinging from the highest tree  
Push came to shove  
Give it one more try  
You dont miss your water  
Until the well runs dry  
  
Love Me Like a Bird Dog  
Never learn to fly  
Ask me no questions  
Ill tell you no lies
