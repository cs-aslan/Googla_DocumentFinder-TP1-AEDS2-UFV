Donna has a nine year old kid  
In another months time shes expecting twins  
She says she can quit anytime she likes  
But I know shes on a mission tonight  
Donna get off that crack says the sign on the third floor flat  
Donna get off that crack just say no get your life back  
Dont pay no bills dont pay the rent  
But you dont forget where the money went  
And who will you turn to when the moneys all gone  
Youll wonder why why you were born  
Donna get off that crack says the sign on the third floor flat  
Donna get off that crack just say no get your life back  
Shes down on the dealing floor  
She just wants to do one more  
One more time and then shell quit  
One more dance just one more hit  
Remember Frank he cut a dash  
So much style so much class  
Blown away for the coat on his back  
The kid that did it sold his coat for crack  
Donna get off that crack says the sign on the third floor flat  
Donna get off that crack just say no get your life back  
Shes down on the dealing floor  
She just wants to do one more  
One more time and then shell quit  
One more dance just one more hit  
Donna get off that crack says the sign on the third floor flat  
Donna get off that crack just say no get your life back
