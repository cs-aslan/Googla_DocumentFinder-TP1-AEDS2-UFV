Im gonna ease your mind Im gonna write a line  
And write a letter to you  
Im gonna let you know that Ill be coming home  
And make it better with you  
I sang a sad lullaby  
I left you all alone to cry  
Well I need you oh my  
Just to sing a lullaby  
It wont be very long before I right my wrongs  
And make it better with you  
Its such a crying shame I had to break away  
To find the same old road  
But now Im getting wise and Ive realized  
That thats a the way that it goes  
So put a smile upon your face  
Let me know Ive found my place  
Weve got no time to waste  
Cos all the time for heavens late  
Now dont you be afraid its gonna be the same  
Ill make it better with you  
Im gonna ease your mind Im gonna write a line  
And write a letter to you  
Im gonna let you know that Ill be coming home  
And make it better with you  
I sang a sad lullaby  
I left you all alone to cry  
Well I need you oh my  
Just to sing a lullaby  
It wont be very long before I right my wrongs  
And make it better with you
