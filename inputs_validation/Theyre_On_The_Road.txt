Its the season of the golden leaves  
When the wind turns into a bitter breeze  
  
I was walking through the oak leaves on the hill  
With my lady oh shes got a strong will  
And I see her through these everclouded eyes  
This time its goodbye and I cant answer why  
  
Maybe its because I aint quite shy of running yet  
Or maybe its because Im the hometown boy in the spotlight  
But my roots aint in the ground  
Theyre on the road  
  
Settle down was all I ever heard from her  
If you cared she said you would weigh my words  
But my life doesnt ride on the factory road  
Baby dont ask me why I cant even pretend to know
