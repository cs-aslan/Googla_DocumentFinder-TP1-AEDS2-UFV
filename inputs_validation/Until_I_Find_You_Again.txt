Lately Ive been trying  
To fill up my days since youre gone  
The speed of love is blinding  
And I didnt know how to hold on  
My mind wont clear  
Im out of tears  
My hearts got no room left inside  
  
How many dreams will end  
How long can I pretend  
How many times will love pass me by  
Until I find you again  
  
Will the arms of hope surround me  
Will time be a fairweather friend  
Should I call out to angels  
Or just drink myself sober again  
I cant hide its true  
I still burn for you  
Your memory just wont let me go  
  
How many dreams will end  
How long can I pretend  
How many times will love pass me by  
Until I find you again  
  
Id hold you tighter  
Closer than ever before  
Yeah  
No flame would burn brighter  
If I could touch you once more  
Hold you once more  
  
How many dreams will end  
How long can I pretend  
How many times will love pass me by until I find you again  
Til I find you again
