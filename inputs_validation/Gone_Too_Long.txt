I been gone too long  
Too long gone too long  
I been travelin hard  
I just cant get back home  
Its hard to believe I done all that much wrong  
  
I want to find me a seven  
Sevens aint so bad  
Sevens about the best friend  
This poor boy ever had  
You get you a seven  
One and six dont seem so sad  
  
I aint bein alone  
Bein alone too long  
Im sick of singin this same ol lonesome song  
Im gonna find me a seven and darlin  
Im comin home  
  
Its lonesome down along this ol highway  
Darlin I aint stayin here  
I dont intend to stay  
You may not want me Im comin home anyway  
  
When the sun comes creepin  
Over the mountain side  
I at least lay down and tell myself I tried  
I aint like somebody gonna sit  
In no ditch and cry  
  
I been gone too long  
Too long gone too long  
Travelin hard I just cant get back home  
Its hard to believe I done all that much wrong  
  
Too long gone  
Too long gone too long  
Travelin hard I just cant get back home  
Its hard to believe I done all that much wrong  
Its hard to believe I done all that much wrong
