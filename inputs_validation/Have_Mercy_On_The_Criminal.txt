Have you heard the dogs at night  
Somewhere on the hill  
Chasing some poor criminal  
And I guess theyre out to kill  
  
Oh there must be shackles on his feet  
And mother in his eyes  
Stumbling through the devildark  
With the hound pack in full cry  
  
Have mercy on the criminal  
Who is running from the law  
Are you blind to the winds of change  
Dont you hear him any more  
  
Praying Lord you got to help me  
I am never gonna sin again  
Just take these chains from around my legs  
Sweet Jesus Ill be your friend  
  
Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam  
While you lie on a cold damp ground  
Youre taking in the face of a rifle butt  
While the wardens hold you down  
  
And youve never seen a friend in years  
Oh it turns your heart to stone  
You jump the walls and the dogs run free  
And the graves gonna be your home
