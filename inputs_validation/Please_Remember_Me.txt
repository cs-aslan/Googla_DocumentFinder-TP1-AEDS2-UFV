All our tears have reached the sea  
Part of you will live in me  
Way down deep inside my heart  
The days keep coming without fail  
New wind is gonna find your sail  
Thats where your journey starts  
  
Chorus  
Youll find better love  
Strong as it ever was  
Deep as the river runs  
Warm as the morning sun  
Please remember me  
  
Just like the waves down by the shore  
Were gonna keep on comin back for more  
Cause we dont ever want to stop  
Out in this brave new world youll see  
Ovr the valleys and the peaks  
And I can see you on the top  
  
Youll find better love  
Strong as it ever was  
Deep as the river runs  
Warm as the morning sun  
Please remember me  
  
Remember me when youre out walking  
When snow falls high outside your door  
Late at night when youre not sleeping  
And moonlight falls across your floor  
And I cant hurt you anymore  
  
Youll find better love  
Strong as it ever was  
Deep as the river runs  
Warm as the morning sun  
Please remember me  
  
Please remember me
