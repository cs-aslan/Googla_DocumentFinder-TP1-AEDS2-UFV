I know Im artificial  
But dont put the blame on me  
I was reared with appliances  
In a consumer society  
  
When I put on my makeup  
The pretty little mask not me  
Thats the way a girl should be  
In a consumer society  
  
My existence is elusive  
The kind that is supported  
By mechanical resources  
  
My existence is elusive  
The kind that is supported  
By mechanical resources  
  
I want to be Instamatic  
I want to be a frozen pea  
I wanna be dehydrated  
In a consumer society  
  
In a consumer society  
In a consumer society
