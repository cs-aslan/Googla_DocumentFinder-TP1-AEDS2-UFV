Everybody weve got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody weve got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody weve got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody weve got to fight for ourselves  
  
So many people so many problems  
There in the pretty city lights  
Where weve thrown it all away  
Well if life is here before my eyes  
Then I find it hard to see  
How the methods that were told to use  
Are gonna make us free  
Until then I say  
  
Everybody weve got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody weve got to fight for ourselves  
  
All through the mystery  
All through the heartache  
Shes got the only single thing  
That Ill never throw away  
Oh if lightning strikes for a second time  
Will you come and pull me through  
Its a battle that we all must make  
So show me what to do  
And you said  
  
Everybody weve got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody weve got to fight for ourselves  
  
Well theres a feeling growing that is in this land  
Theres a soul thats burning and its your hand  
Everybody weve got to fight for ourselves

Oh so many people now theres so many problems  
There in the pretty city lights  
Where weve thrown it all away  
Well if life is here before my eyes  
Then I find it hard to see  
How the methods that were told to use

Everybody weve got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody weve got to fight for ourselves  
  
Well theres a feeling growing that is in this land  
Theres a soul thats burning and its your hand  
Everybody weve got to fight for ourselves
