Sixteen years and she lets em show  
Little bitty queen dancin on the floor  
High heeled shoes keep her right on time  
Body makes a little boy lose his mind  
And she knows  
She Cant Do Anything Wrong  
  
Musics hot and the night is loud  
Rhythm from the band burnin through the crowd  
Little sixteen shes goin strong  
She loves to rock and roll it all night long  
And she knows  
She Cant Do Anything Wrong  
  
Every daddys son wants a closer look  
Every boy want to try to set his hook  
She likes playin numbers if it takes all night  
If she goes home alone itll be alright  
  
Workin hard tryin to make it last  
Shes too young to even have a past  
The only child of a mother who prayed  
That her daughter wouldnt never turn out this way  
And she knows  
She Cant Do Anything Wrong  
  
Every daddys son wants a closer look  
Every boy want to try to set his hook  
She likes playin numbers if it takes all night  
If she goes home alone itll be alright  
  
Sixteen years and she lets em show  
Little bitty queen dancin on the floor  
She knows She Cant Do Anything Wrong
