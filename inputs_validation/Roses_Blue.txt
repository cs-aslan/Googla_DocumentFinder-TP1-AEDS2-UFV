I think of tears I think of rain on shingles  
I think of rain I think of roses blue  
I think of Rose my heart begins to tremble  
To see the place shes lately gotten to  
Gotten to gotten to  
  
Shes gotten to mysterious devotions  
Shes gotten to the zodiac and Zen  
Shes gotten into tarot cards and potions  
Shes laying her religion on her friends  
On her friends on her friends  
  
Friends who come to ask her for their future  
Friends who come to find they cant be friends  
Because of signs and seasons that dont suit her  
Shell prophesy your death she wont say when  
Wont say when wont say when  
  
When all the black cards come you cannot barter  
No when all your stars are stacked you cannot win  
Shell shake her head and treat you like a martyr  
It is her blackest spell she puts you in  
Puts you in puts you in  
  
In sorrow she can lure you where she wants you  
Inside your own selfpity there you swim  
In sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you  
And only with your laughter can you win  
Can you win can you win  
  
You win the lasting laurels with your laughter  
It reaches like an arm before you sink  
To win the solitary truth youre after  
You dare not ask the priestess how to think  
How to think how to think  
  
I think of tears I think of rain on shingles  
I think of rain I think of roses blue  
I think of Rose my heart begins to tremble  
To see the place shes lately gotten to  
Gotten to gotten to
