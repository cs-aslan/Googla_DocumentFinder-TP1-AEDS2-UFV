Sat out a card game in a motel room  
Dont let the muzak drive you crazy late at night  
They tell me its all part of the deal Im in  
Well I close my eyes put memory into sight  
Every time I see you smile  
Now the lady tabs your case leaves you thinking  
An hour or so I hope shes right on time  
And you dream away your touchdown destination  
Now single file and put yourself back in line  
But oh every time I see you smile  
Now this old world dont give much for choosing  
You can spend a lifetime driving yourself wild  
But I can take its punches laughing  dont mind losing  
Just as long as I get to see you smile every once in a while
