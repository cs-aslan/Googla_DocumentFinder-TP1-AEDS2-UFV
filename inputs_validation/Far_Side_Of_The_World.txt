Ramadan is over  
The new moons shown her face  
Im halfway round the planet  
In a most unlikely place  
  
Following my song line  
Past bamboo shacks and shops  
Behind a jitney packed like sardines  
With bananas piled on top  
  
I ran away from politics  
Its too bizarre at home  
Away I flew tuned into Blue  
Maybe Amsterdam or Rome  
  
Awakened by a stewardess  
With Spain somewhere below  
On the threshold of adventure  
God I do love this job so  
  
So while I make my move  
On the big board game  
Up and down a Spanish highway  
Some things remain the same  
Girls meet boys  
and the boys tease girls  
Im heading out this morning  
For the Far Side of the World  
  
Oh I believe in song lines  
Obvious and not  
Id ridden them like camels  
To some most peculiar spots  
  
They run across the oceans  
Through mountains and saloons  
And tonight out to the dessert  
Where I sit atop this dune  
  
I was destined for this vantage point  
Which is so far from the Sea  
Ive lived it in the pages of SaintExupery  
  
From Paris to Tunisia  
Casablanca to Dakar  
I was riding long before I flew  
Through the wind and sand and stars  
  
Caravan  
Ride that hump  
And Timbuktus a jillion bumps  
Sleeping bags and battle flags  
Are coiled and furled  
Thats the way you travel  
To the far side of the world  
  
A Sunset framed by lightening bolts  
Burns a lasting memory  
And a string of tiny twinkling lights  
adorn the sausage tree  
While the embers from the log fire  
Flicker fly and twirl  
Then drift off toward the cosmos  
From the Far Side of the World  
Well its Christmas and my birthday  
and so to that extent  
The Masai not the wise men  
Are circling my tent  
I teach them how to play guitar  
They show me how to dance  
We have rum from the Caribbean  
And Burgundy from France  
  
New Years Eve in Zanzibar  
With Babu and his boys  
High up on the rooftop  
You can relish all the noise  
  
They are dancing on the tables  
People bouncing like gazelles  
Two 001 is ushered in  
With air raid horns and bells  
  
Time to sing time to dance  
Living out my second chance  
  
Cobras and sleeping bags are coiled and curled  
Thats the way it happens  
On the Far Side of the World  
  
Back at home its afternoon  
Six thousand miles away  
I will still be there when I get through  
Attending this soiree  
  
There are jobs and chores and questions  
And plates I need to twirl  
But tonight Ill take my chances  
On the Far Side of the World  
Thats the way it happens  
On the Far Side of the World
