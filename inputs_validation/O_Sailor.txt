Im undecided about you again  
I can be right that youre not here  
Its double sided cause I ruined it all  
But also saved myself  
By never believing you dear  
Everything good I deem too good to be true  
Everything else is just a bore  
Everything I have to look forward to  
Has a pretty painful and very imposing before  
Oh sailor whyd you do it  
Whatd you do that for  
Saying theres nothing to it  
Then lettin it go by the boards  
Oh sailor whyd you do it  
Whatd you do that for  
Saying theres nothing to it  
Then lettin it go by the boards  
I have too been playing with fiftytwo cards  
Just cause I play so far from my vest  
Whatever Ive got Ive got no reason to guard  
What could I do but spend my best  
Oh sailor whyd you do it  
Whatd you do that for  
Saying theres nothing to it  
Then lettin it go by the boards  
Oh sailor whyd you do it  
Whatd you do that for  
Saying theres nothing to it  
Then lettin it go by the boards  
And after waiting fighting patiently on my knees  
All the other stuff tired itself out first not me  
And in its wake appeared the touch and call of a different breed  
One of the steps is getting wise and got me there and then got me  
And what a thing to know what could be instead  
Oh what a blessed curse to see  
Took the agenda from its place in my bed  
Made a merry paramour of me  
Oh sailor whyd you do it  
Whatd you do that for  
Saying theres nothing to it  
Then lettin it go by the boards  
Oh sailor whyd you do it  
Whatd you do that for  
Given the eyes to view it  
As it goes by the boards  
Oh sailor whyd you do it  
Whatd you do that for  
Saying theres nothing to it  
Then lettin it go by the boards  
Oh sailor whyd you do it  
Whatd you do that for  
Saying theres nothing to it  
Then lettin it go by the boards  
Oh sailor whyd you do it  
Whatd you do that for  
Given the eyes to view it  
As it goes by the boards  
Oh sailor whyd you do it  
Whatd you do that for  
Given the eyes to view it  
As it goes by the boards
