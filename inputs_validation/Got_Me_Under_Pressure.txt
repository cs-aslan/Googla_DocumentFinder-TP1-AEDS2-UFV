She likes wearin lipstick she likes French cuisine  
But she wont let me use my passion unless its in a limousine  
  
She got me under pressure  
She got me under pressure  
  
She likes the art museum she dont like Pavlovs dog  
She fun at the mind museum she likes it in a London fog  
She dont like other women she likes whips and chains  
She likes cocaine and filppin out with great Danes  
Shes about all I can handle its too much for my brain  
  
Its got me under pressure  
Its got me under pressure  
  
Im gonna give her a message  
Heres what Im gonna say  
Its all over  
She might get out a nightstick  
And hurt me real real bad  
By the roadside in a ditch  
  
Its got me under pressure  
Its got me under pressure  
  
Its got me under pressure  
Its got me under pressure
