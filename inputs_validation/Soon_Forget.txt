Sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a Corvette  
Thinks hell get the girl hell only get the mechanic  
Whats missing Hes living a day hell soon forget  
  
Thats one more time around the sun is going down  
The moon is out but hes drunk and shouting putting people down  
Hes pissing hes living a day hell soon forget  
  
Counts his money every morning the only thing that keeps him horny  
Locked in a giant house thats alarming  
The townsfolk they all laugh  
  
Sorry is the fool who trades his love for hirise rent  
Seems the more you make equals the loneliness you get  
And its fitting hes barely living a day hell soon forget  
  
Thats one more time around and there is not a sound  
Hes lying dead clutching Benjamins never put the money down  
Hes stiffening were all whistling a man well soon forget
