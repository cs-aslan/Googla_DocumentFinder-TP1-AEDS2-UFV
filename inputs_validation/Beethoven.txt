Take a girl like that  
And put her in a natural setting  
Like a cafe for example  
Along comes the boy  
And hes looking for trouble  
With a girl like that  
With a girl like that  
Who knows what theyll decide to do  
Who knows what theyll get up to  
Id love to know  
Wouldnt you  
  
I love to listen to beethoven  
  
You think you know just what you want  
But you have used that weapon agianst me  
Did I tell you I was lying by the way  
When I said I wanted a new mink coat  
I was just thinking about  
Something sleek  
To wrap around my tender throat  
I was dreaming like a texan girl  
A girl who thinks shes got the right to everything  
A girl who thinks she should have  
Something extreme  
  
I love to listen to beethoven
