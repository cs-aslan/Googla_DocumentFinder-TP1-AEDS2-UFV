Brown shoes dont make it  
Brown Shoes dont make it  
Quit school why fake it  
Brown shoes dont make it  
  
Tv dinner by the pool  
Watch your brother grow a beard  
Got another year of school  
Youre okay hes too weird  
Be a plummer  
Hes a bummer  
Hes a bummer every summer  
Be a loyal plastic robot  
For a world that doesnt care  
Thats right  
  
Smile at every ugly  
Shine on your shoes and cut your hair  
  
Be a jerkgo to work  
Be a jerkgo to work  
Be a jerkgo to work  
Be a jerkgo to work  
Do your job and do it right  
Lifes a ball  
Tv tonight  
Do you love it  
Do you hate it  
There it is  
The way you made it  
  
A world of secret hungers  
Perverting the men who make your laws  
Every desire is hidden away  
In a drawer in a desk by a Naugahyde chair  
On a rug where they walk and drool  
Past the girls in the office  
  
We see in the back  
Of the City Hall mind  
The dream of a girl about thirteen  
Off with her clothes and into a bed  
Where she tickles his fancy  
All night long  
  
His wiles attending an orchid show  
She squealed for a week to get him to go  
But back in the bed his teenage queen  
Is rocking and rolling and acting obscene  
Baby baby   
Baby baby   
Cimmie then cakes uh  
If I do Im gonna lose my  
  
And he loves it he loves it  
It curls up his toes  
She wipes his fat neck  
And it lights up his nose  
But he cannot be fooled  
Old City Hall Fred  
Shes nasty shes nasty  
She digs it in bed  
Thats right  
  
Do it again ha  
And do it some more  
Hey that does it by golly  
And shes nasty for sure  
Nasty nasty nasty  
Nasty nasty nasty  
Only thirteen and she knows how to nasty  
  
Shes a dirty young mind corrupted  
Corroded  
Well shes thirteen today  
And I hear she gets loaded  
  
If she were my daughter Id  
What would you do Frankie  
If she were my daughter Id  
What would you do Frankie  
Check this out  
Smother my daughter in chocolate syrup  
And strap her on again oh baby  
Smother that girl in chocolate syrup  
And strap her on again oh baby  
Shes my teenage baby  
She turns me on  
Id like to make her do a nasty  
On the White House lawn  
Smother my daughter in chocolate syrup  
And boogie till the cows come home  
  
Time to go home  
Madge is on the phone  
Got to meet the Gurneys and a dozen gray attorneys  
Tv dinner by the pool  
Im so glad I finished school  
Life is such a ball  
I run the world from City Hall
