To finger paint is not a sin  
I put my middle finger in  
Your monthly blood is what I win  
Im in your house now let me spin  
  
Python power straight from Monty  
Celluloid loves got a John Frusciante  
Spread your head and spread the blanket  
Shes too free and Im the patient  
  
Black and white a red and blue  
Things that look good on you  
And if I scream dont let me go  
A purple stain I know  
  
Knock on wood we all stay good  
Cause we all live in Hollywood  
With Dracula and Darla Hood  
Unspoken words were understood  
  
Up to my ass in alligators  
Lets get it on with the alligator haters  
Did what you did did what you said  
Whats the point yo whats the spread  
  
Black and white a red and blue  
Things that look good on you  
And if I scream dont let me go  
A purple stain I know  
And if I call for you to stay  
Come hit the funk on your way  
Its way out there but I dont care  
Cause this is where I go  
  
Knock on wood we all stay good  
Cause we all live in Hollywood  
With Dracula and Darla Hood  
Unspoken words were understood  
  
Its way out there  
But I dont care  
Cause this is what  
I want to wear  
  
Knock on wood we all stay good  
Cause we all live in Hollywood  
  
To finger paint is not a sin  
I put my middle finger in  
Your monthly blood is what I win  
Im in your house now let me spin  
  
Feather light but you cant move this  
Farley is an angel and I can prove this  
Purple is a stain upon my pillow  
Lets Sleep weeping willow  
  
Black and white a red and blue  
Things that look good on you  
And if I scream dont let me go  
A purple stain I know  
And if I call for you to stay  
Come hit the funk on your way  
Its way out there but I dont care  
Cause this is where I go  
  
Knock on wood we all stay good  
Cause we all live in Hollywood  
With Dracula and Darla Hood  
Unspoken words were understood  
  
Its way out there  
But I dont care  
Cause this is what  
I want to wear  
  
Knock on wood we all stay good  
Cause we all live in Hollywood
