Bout the baddest girl I ever seen  
Straight up outta movie scene  
Who knew she was a drama queen  
Thatll turn my life to Stephen Kings  
Up late night like she on patrol  
Checkin everything like Im on parole  
I told her its some things she dont need to know  
She never let it go oh  
  
Chorus  
Okay okay okay okay you will never stop it now  
You never stop it now  
Okay okay okay you will never stop it now  
We need to drop it now drop it drop it  
  
Cause I dont want no robocop  
You movin like a robocop  
When did you become a robocop  
No I dont need a robocop  
  
Just looking at your history  
Youre like the girl from misery  
She said she aint take it to this degree  
Well lets agree to disagree  
I know she kinda crazy but it turns me on  
Keep it up enough to keep it going on  
I told her its some things she dont need to know  
She never let it go oh oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause I dont want no robocop  
You movin like a robocop  
When you become a robocop  
Somebody please make it stop  
  
Stop drop roll pop  
Bitch Im cold  
Aint use to being told stop  
So I can never be your Robot  
Fast or slow  
You can stay you can go  
Now that you know now that you know  
Yea I had her before but that happened before  
You get mad when you know  
Soldiers dont ask me no more  
  
Chorus  
  
Okay  
Okay  
Okay hey hey
