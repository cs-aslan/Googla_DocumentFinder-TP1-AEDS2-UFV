We are all equal but were individually different  
and able to reach the impossible if we try  
We find faith and strength in the most unlikely places  
and love sometimes eludes us but we try  
We keep searching and one day we find  
Life goes on and around like a wheel  
it keeps on turning thats the deal  
Why are we running  
Were running so fast to keep from falling behind  
Problems come and they go and  
in the end what will you show  
Why are we worried  
We worry so much worry about falling behind  
Is it really all about the thing  
of what you wear and what you think Ill think  
Who has more  
Arabs and Jews at war I dont care anymore  
Its always the same tired story  
How many dead in the name of some god  
And whats the difference  
Dont give a damn about their differences  
Nothings sacred once the shooting starts  
Life goes on like a wheel  
it keeps on turning thats for real  
Why are we running  
Were running so fast to keep from falling behind  
What may come and what may go  
and in the end what will you show for all your worries  
Why worry so much why worry about falling behind  
The plans already in motion  
it happens whether we say  
The old world order is over  
intelligence and love win the day  
I wont regret one moment  
life is too short for that bring it on  
Life goes on and around like a wheel  
it keeps on turning thats the deal  
Why are we running  
Were running so fast to keep from falling behind  
Problems come and they go and  
in the end what will you show  
Why are we worried  
Why worry so much Dont worry about falling behind
