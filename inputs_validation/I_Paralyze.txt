I wont waste your time  
By pretending I am something else  
You got eyes to see  
I live a modesty of someone else  
Im reading your mind  
I know what you like  
I peeped into your fantasies  
  
Chorus  
It works every time  
Im confident  
I can take you  
I can take you anytime  
I paralyze  
Body and soul are immobilize  
Honey if its green  
Like a dollar bill  
Dont get caught up  
In a power of a win  
  
Earth is gonna shake  
Watch me elevate your expectations  
Oh why is this happening  
Youll be furthering your education  
I think it all out  
I know what to say  
To get you on my side  
  
Chorus  
Got a way of  
Got a way of  
Getting what I want  
Got a way of  
Got a way of  
Getting what I want  
Got a way of  
Got a way of  
Getting what I want  
Got a way of  
Got a way of  
Getting what I want  
  
Chorus  
Better watch your step  
I paralyze  
Body and soul are immobilize  
I can see you are a man  
Wholl never quit  
Im so glad  
Cause I think  
Im gonna like it
