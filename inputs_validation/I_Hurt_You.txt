I been crying like a woman  
Because Im mad mad mad like a man  
If youd been in the SS in 43  
Youd have been kicked out for cruelty  
  
I hurt you  
Cause you hurt me  
So I hurt you  
Cause you hurt me  
  
I been wondering about your dependency  
Your idea of defiance is a modern day mystery  
Arms and chest are cold  
When your back is on fire  
And the only time you come clean  
Is when youre talking to your buyer  
  
I hurt you  
Cause you hurt me  
So I hurt you  
Cause you hurt me  
  
Forget our philosophies  
That we admired when we were young  
And our popular points of view  
They cant mean much or nothing  
Or something or anything  
Cause we cant say I love you  
  
I hurt you  
Cause you hurt me  
So I hurt you  
Cause you hurt me  
  
Happy birthday darling and thank you for the schooling  
Your correction mistress warned me and she wasnt fooling  
Never trust a user with your television overnight  
When the show he wants to video is Dallas on a Tuesday night  
Dont try to paint your masterpiece under artificial light
