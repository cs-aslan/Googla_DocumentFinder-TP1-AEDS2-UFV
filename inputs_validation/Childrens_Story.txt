Everlast  
Once upon a time not long ago  
when people wore pyjamas and lived life slow  
When laws were stern and justice stood  
and people were behaving like they ought to good  
There was a little boy who was misled by another lil boy  
and this is what he said  
Me and you Guy we gonna make some cash  
robbing old folks and making the dash  
They did the job money came with ease  
but one couldnt stop its like he had a disease  
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother  
Tried to rob a man who was a DT undercover  
the cop grabbed his arm he started acting erratic  
He said keep still boy no need for static  
punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap  
But little did he know the lil boy was strapped  
the kid pulled out a gun  
He said Whyd you hit me  
the barrel headed straight for the cops kidney  
The cop got scared the kid he starts to figure  
Ill do years if I pull this trigger  
So he cold dashed and ran around the block  
cop radios in to another lady cop  
He ran by a tree there he saw this sister  
a shot for the head he shot back but he missed her  
Looked round good in expectations  
so he decided hed head for the subway stations  
But she was coming so he made a left  
he was running top speed till he was outta breath  
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him  
then he made his move to an abandoned building  
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor  
opened up the door there guess who he saw  
Dad the dope fiend shooting dope  
who dont know the meaning of water nor soap  
He said I need bullets hurry up run  
the dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun  
He went outside but there was cops all over  
So he get into a car it was a stolen Nova  
Raced up the block doing 83 crashed into a tree near university  
Escaped alive though the car was battered  
He ratatattatted and all the cops scattered  
Ran out of bullets but still had static  
grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic  
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full of lead  
He told the cops back off or honey heres dead  
deep in his heart he knew he was wrong  
so he let the lady go and he starts to move on  
sirens sounded he seemed astounded  
Before long the lil boy got surrounded  
he dropped the gun so went the glory  
And this is the way I got to end this story  
he was only nineteen in a madmans dream  
I saw the cops shoot the kid I still hear him scream  
this aint funny so dont you dare laugh  
Just another case bout the wrong path  
straight and narrow or your soul gets cast  
Good night
