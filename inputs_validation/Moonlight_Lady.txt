Whos gonna tell you goodnight  
Whos gonna put out the light  
I love you and love is almost crazy  
Slippin through the so and sos  
Over all the fields we go  
Moonlight lady  
  
Dont wanna tell you so long  
Dont wanna mess up your song  
Feelin like I do Im almost crazy  
Choosin all the red blue jeans  
Watchin people be so mean  
Moonlight lady  
  
Im on fire  
And I can hardly breathe  
Time goes by  
And all alone  
My poor heart grieves  
  
I love you just cause I do  
I didnt plan it with you  
But now were here we might as well accept it  
Were together for all time  
Marching through the fields of dimes  
Moonlight lady
