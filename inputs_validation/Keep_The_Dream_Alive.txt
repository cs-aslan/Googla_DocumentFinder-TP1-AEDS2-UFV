Four Seasons seconds flicker and flash Im alone  
A lonely scream provides the scene  its no hope  
Every night I hear you scream but you dont say what you mean  
This was my dream but now my dream has flown  
  
Im at the crossroads waiting for a sign  
My life is standing still but Im still alive  
Every night I think I know  
In the morning where did it go  
The answers disappear when I open my eyes  
  
Im a stranger to this place where real life and dreams collide  
And even though I fall from grace I will keep the dream alive  
I will keep the dream alive  
  
Four Seasons seconds flicker and flash Im alone

Im a stranger to this place where real life and dreams collide  
And even though I fall from grace I will keep the dream alive  
Im a stranger to this place where real life and dreams collide  
And even though I fall from grace I will keep the dream alive
