Sometimes Im happy  
Sometimes Im blue  
My disposition depends on you  
I never mind the rain from the skies  
As long as I have the sun in your eyes  
  
Sometimes I love you  
Sometimes I hate you  
When I hate you  
Its because I love you  
Thats how I am  
So what can I do  
Im happy when Im with you
