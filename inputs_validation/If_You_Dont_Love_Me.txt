You can tell me anything  
You can tell me anything  
Ill believe you  
  
You know it too  
Share the truth with lies  
Set aside one flies  
Will you realise  
  
Chorus  
If you dont love me  
You dont love me  
I will know  
If you dont love me  
You dont love me  
  
You can ask me anything  
You can ask me anything  
I will do it  
  
You know it too  
Nothing that Ill do  
If you want me to  
And its all so true  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill know
