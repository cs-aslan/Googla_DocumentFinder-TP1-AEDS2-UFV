Here we go another funky style  
Peace to my brothers on Rikers Isle  
Introducin the crew thats goin a mile  
To get behind the ropes stop actin wild  
This here part is like section one  
So you can bugaloo and set fire to your buns  
Early mornin light is yet to come  
And when it come well get buggy in the sun  
Females let your hair down  
Cause this is how we do it when we go uptown  
With the funky sound the razzamatazz  
You give me to the sploshers you can get youra blast  
Enter at your own risk some brothers got weapons  
Yet youre still steppin the beats so funkafied  
And answer to the bone peoplell be dancin alone  
Leanin on the wall next to grandmas mop  
With the funky funky groove thats far from pop  
Doseydo your partner all night long  
And all you mothers bring your kids along  
  
Chorus  
Yo Uncle whats up whats up

Suck it like a hoover and do ya whole maneuver

But when I do it yeah Im doin it for yall  
Asiatic automatic your funky fanatic without no static  
Flippin on the freak like Im acrobatic

Get on down to the sureshot sound

And all the words whos next to be the teachers pet  
Downhome monkey corn fed original  
And what you do is up to you the individual  
This is the place to be for whyall underage brothers  
With the rebel mentality  
Sweet young freaks sayin Rock me Armadayus  
Skin so smooth lookin all   
Video to video tape to tape  
Walkin through the jam in search of a playmate  
Party is packed like a rich mans fridge  
Too many people in the crib  
The situation is sweaty and crazy like Eddy  
And yes we are ready to funk it up steady  
Aint nothin here petty  
Trip down to your laundaray Im ready  
Hold your horse and baby feel the force  
And get jaws off no matter what the cost  
Come out to cloth get hot like a stove  
Early in the mornin were dancin in robes  
To a funkafied sweaty greazy groove  
I know the Marley remix to make you move  
  
Chorus
