Inside of every heart there is a seed  
My mama watered mine and raised me to be  
A rose a rose or some greater thing  
Mama youre beautiful to me  
Oh my Daddy I want you to know  
Your little baby girl became that rose  
The bloom the bloom blushed deeper red  
With every drop of sacrifice you bled  
Chorus  
Theres no growing without any pain  
Theres no flowers without the rain  
We are bound together by blood thats flowing through us  
And thats the way it is with love  
I have a vision a hope and a dream  
I see a hill across a healing stream  
Where the Rose arose to set us free  
And the Cross became a family tree  
Chorus  
Circle of God comes around  
And turns us into special things somehow  
And one day well hold little flowers of our own  
And well sacrifice so that they can grow  
Chorus
