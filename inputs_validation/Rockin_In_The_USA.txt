Im flyin in a 747 Im passing by the pearly gates  
And Im comin real close to Heaven  
And my guitar just cant wait it just cant wait  
  
In France really had the chance yeah there was plenty romance  
Ive been to England too there wasnt much to do  
One thing I know is true what I would rather do is  
  
Rockin in the USA  
Nowhere else Id rather stay  
Rockin and arollin rockin and arollin  
Rockin in the USA  
  
Germany was really neat Japan had lots to eat  
And Denmark was great but I just cant wait rockin in the USA
