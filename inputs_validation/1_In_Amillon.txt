How did I get here I turned around and there you were  
I didnt think twice or rationalize  
Cause somehow I knew  
  
That there was more that just chemistry  
I mean I knew you were kind of into me  
But I figured its too good to be true  
  
I said Pinch me wheres the catch this time  
Cant find a single cloud in the sky  
Help me before I get used to this guy  
  
They say that good things take time  
But really great things happen  
In the blink of an eye  
  
Thought the chances to meet somebody  
Like you were a million to one  
I cannot believe it youre one in a million  
  
All this time I was looking for love  
Trying to make things work that werent good enough  
Till I thought Im through said Im done  
And stumbled into the arms of the one  
  
Youre making me laugh about the silliest stuff  
Say that Im your diamond in the rough  
When Im mad at you you come with your velvet touch  
  
Cant believe that Im so lucky  
I have never felt so happy  
Every time I see that sparkle in your eyes  
  
They say that good things take time  
But really great things happen  
In the blink of an eye  
  
Thought the chances to meet somebody  
Like you were a million to one  
I cannot believe it youre one in a million
