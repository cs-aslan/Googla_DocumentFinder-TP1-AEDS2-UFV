Every picture has its shadows  
And it has some source of light  
Blindness blindness and sight  
The perils of benefactors  
The blessings of parasites  
Blindness blindness and sight  
Threatened by all things  
Devil of cruelty  
Drawn to all things  
Devil of delight  
Mythical devil of the everpresent laws  
Governing blindness blindness and sight  
  
Suntans in reservation dining rooms  
Pale miners in their lantern rays  
Night night and day  
Hostage smile on presidents  
Freedom scribbled in the subway  
Its like night night and day  
Threatened by all things  
God of cruelty  
Drawn to all things  
God of delight  
Mythical god of the everlasting laws  
Governing day day and night  
  
Critics of all expression  
Judges in black and white  
Saying its wrong saying its right  
Compelled by prescribed standards  
Or some ideals we fight  
For wrong wrong and right  
Threatened by all things  
Man of crueltymark of Cain  
Drawn to all things  
Man of delightborn again born again  
Man of the laws the everbroken laws  
Governing wrong wrong and right  
Governing wrong wrong and right  
Wrong and right
