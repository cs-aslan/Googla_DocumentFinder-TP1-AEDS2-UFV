Here we stand today  
Like we always dreamed  
Starting out our life together  
The light is in your eyes  
Love is in our hearts  
I cant believe youre really mine forever  
  
Been rehearsing for this moment all my life  
So dont act surprised  
If the feeling starts to carry me away  
  
On this day  
I promise forever  
On this day  
I surrender my heart  
Here I stand take my hand  
And I will honor every word that I say  
On this day  
  
Not so long ago  
This earth was just a field of cold and lonely space  
Without you  
Now everythings alive  
Now everythings revealed  
And the story of my life  
Is all about you  
  
So if you feel the cool winds blowing  
Through your nights  
I will shelter you  
Im forever here to chase  
Your fears away  
  
On this day  
I promise forever  
On this day  
I surrender my heart  
Here we stand like our plan  
Please say youll always look at me this way  
On this day
