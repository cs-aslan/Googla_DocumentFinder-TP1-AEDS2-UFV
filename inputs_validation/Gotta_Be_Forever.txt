Let me hear a little backing track  
  
Gotta be forever gotta be forever  
Im giving it up Im giving it up  
  
I know youre wondering where Ive been  
Sweet songs of love got me coming in  
Wanted to leave yeah just walk away  
But this is real and Im here to stay  
  
Well so afraid of being sad and blue  
Talked to myself and said Im over you  
But now its time for me to make you see  
These chains of love got a hold on me  
  
I never felt this way before  
Cant get enough want more and more  
Love will keep together  
Gotta be forever gotta be forever  
  
Never knew love would make me feel this way  
You make me happy and Im gonna stay  
Whenever life was getting out of hand  
I turned to you and you would understand  
  
You lift me up when Im feeling down  
I got my feet back on solid ground  
You make me smile when I wanna cry  
Im gonna love you til the day I die  
  
I never felt this way before  
Cant get enough want more and more  
Love will keep together  
Gotta be forever gotta be forever  
  
Im giving it up Im giving it up  
And Im here to stay  
  
I never felt this way before  
Cant get enough want more and more  
Love will keep together  
Gotta be forever gotta be forever  
  
I never felt this way before  
Cant get enough want more and more  
Love will keep together  
Gotta be forever gotta be forever  
  
I never felt this way before  
Cant get enough want more and more  
Love will keep together  
Gotta be forever gotta be forever  
  
I never felt this way before  
Cant get enough want more and more
