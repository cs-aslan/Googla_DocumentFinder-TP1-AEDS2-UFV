You say I know its a waste of time  
Theres no use trying  
So scared that lifes gonna pass you by  
Your spirit dying  
Not long ago  
I could feel your strength and your devotion  
What was so clear is now overcast  
With mixed emotions  
Deep in your heart is the answer  
Find it I know it will pull you through  
  
Get on your feet  
Get up and make it happen  
Get on your feet  
Stand up and take some action  
  
I think its true that weve all been through  
Some nasty weather  
Lets understand that were here  
To handle things together  
You gotta keep looking onto tomorrow  
Theres so much in life  
Thats meant for you  
  
Get on your feet  
Get up and make it happen  
Get on your feet  
Stand up and take some action  
Get on your feet  
Dont stop before its over  
Get on your feet  
The weight is off your shoulder  
  
Get up and make it happen  
Stand up stand up stand up and take some action  
Gotta get on your feet yeah yeah  
Dont stop before its over  
Get on your feet  
The weight is off your shoulder  
Get on your feet  
Get up get up get up and make it happen  
Get on your feet  
Stand up  stand up and take some action  
Get on your feet
