Call me irresponsible  
Call me unreliable  
Throw in undependable too  
  
Do my foolish alibis bore you  
Well Im not too clever I  
I just adore you  
  
So call me unpredictable  
Tell me Im impractical  
Rainbows Im inclined to pursue  
  
Call me irresponsible  
Yes Im unreliable  
But its undeniably true  
That Im irresponsibly mad for you  
  
Do my foolish alibis bore you  
Girl Im not too clever I  
I just adore you  
  
Call me unpredictable  
Tell me that Im so impractical  
Rainbows Im inclined to pursue  
  
Go ahead call me irresponsible  
Yes Im unreliable  
But its undeniably true  
Im irresponsibly mad for you  
  
You know its true  
Oh baby its true
