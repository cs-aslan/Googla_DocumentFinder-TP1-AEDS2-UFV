My tattle tale is a cute little girl  
My tattle tale she puts your heart in a whirl  
My tattle tale is ashakin me true  
I say Im gonna tell my mammy on you  
My tattle tale has a goodnight kiss  
My tattle tale has a heart you will miss  
My tattle tale she makes ame blue  
When she says Im gonna tell my mammy on you  
Sweet baby can we date to the show  
Oh honey I feel so low  
Cmon darlin break the first piece  
What do I tell my history teacher  
My tattle tale now I think you should know  
My tattle tale is not so slow  
My tattle tale can get you too  
When she says Im gonna tell my mammy on you  
Oh yes I am
