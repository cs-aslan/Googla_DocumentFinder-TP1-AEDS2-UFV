Sometimes Im in a jam  
Ive gotta make a plan  
It might be crazy  
I do it anyway  
No way to know for sure  
I figure out a cure  
Im patchin up the holes  
But then it overflows  
If Im not doin too well  
Why be so hard on myself  
Nobodys perfect

Again and again  
Til I get it right

You live and you learn it  
And if I mess it up sometimes  
Nobodys perfect  
Sometimes I work a scheme  
But then it flips on me  
Doesnt turn out how I planned  
Gets stuck in quicksand  
But no problem cant be solved  
Once I get involved  
I try to be delicate  
Then crash right into it  
But my intentions are good yeah yeah yeah  
Sometimes just misunderstood  
Nobodys perfect

Again and again  
Til I get it right  
Nobodys perfect  
You live and you learn it  
And if I mess it up sometimes  
Nobodys perfect  
I gotta work it  
I know in time Ill find a way  
Nobodys perfect  
Sometimes I fix things up  
And they fall apart again  
Nobodys perfect  
I know I mix things up  
But I always get it right in the end  
You know I do  
Next time you feel like  
Its just one of those days  
When you just cant seem to win  
If things dont turn out the way you planned  
Figure something else out  
Dont stay down try again yeah
