Here certified unsound I feel like you  
Theres someone Ive found so far hes true  
Out of me theres a voice which keeps calling  
Im hiding alone crazy I know and I am  
Tied to your strings and twisted  
Im just waiting to show the others who know  
And I am tied to your strings and twisted  
So medication still the devil in me  
So into make believe your smile I see  
Out of me theres a voice which keeps calling  
Im hiding alone crazy I know and I am  
Tied to your strings and twisted  
Im just waiting to show the others who know  
That I am tied to your strings and twisted  
Hold me in this tiny room sedated here Ill stay  
Next to me I beg of you dont throw the key away  
Out of me theres a voice which keeps calling  
Im hiding alone crazy I know and I am  
Tied to your strings and twisted  
Im just waiting to show the others who know  
That I am tied to your strings and twisted  
Im hiding alone crazy I know and I am  
Tied to your strings and twisted  
Im just waiting to show all the others who know  
That I am tied to your strings and twisted  
Im going crazy boy look out  
Tied to your strings and twisted Look out boy
