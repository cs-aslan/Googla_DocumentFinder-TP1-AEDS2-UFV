Dance to the beat  
Of the living dead  
Lose sleep baby  
And stay away from bed  
Raw power is sure to come  
A runnin to you  
If youre alone  
And you got the shakes  
So am I baby  
And I got what it takes  
Raw power will surely come  
Running to you  
Raw power got a healin hand  
Raw power can destroy a man  
Raw power is more than soul  
Its got a son called rock and roll  
Raw power honey just wont quit  
Raw power I can feel it  
Raw power baby cant be beat  
Poppin eyes and flashin feet  
Everybodys always tryin to tell me  
What to do  
Dont you try  
Don t you try to tell me what to do  
Look in the eye  
Of the savage girl  
Fall deep in love  
In the underworld  
Raw power is sure to come  
Runnin to you  
If youre alone  
And you got the fear  
So am I baby  
Lets move on out of here  
Raw power is sure to come  
A runnin to you  
Raw power got a magic touch  
Raw power is much too much  
Happiness is guaranteed  
It was made for you and me  
Raw power honey just wont quit  
Raw power I can feel it  
Raw power honey cant be beat  
Get down and kiss my feet  
Raw powers got no place to go  
Raw power honey it dont want to know  
Raw power is a guaranteed OD  
Raw power is laughin at you and me  
And this is what I want to know  
Can you feel it  
Can you feel it  
Can you feel it  
Can you feel it  
Raw power  
Can you feel it
