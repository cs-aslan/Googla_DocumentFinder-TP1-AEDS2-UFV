Caught up in the daily grind  
Hard to find some peace of mind  
Round here lately  
  
Trying to escape the beaten path  
To near the wrath of the world  
It just had me crazy  
Ooh crazy  
  
Just something to look forward to  
Along with you  
I still get lost in you baby  
Its always you baby  
  
Chorus  
Its all that comes together  
Were meant two animals  
Weve got something sacred  
Youve become a ritual  
Our spirits feed each other  
We never get our fill  
Onward for your sweet religion  
Youve become my ritual  
  
When I am with you all time stands still  
If I had the will then  
Pressure just doesnt phase me  
  
You more than take my breath way  
You captivate we levitate  
You amaze me  
Ooh baby  
  
Chorus  
  
My ritual  
I want you baby  
  
Celebrate the love we found  
Make my world go round  
In your arms where I belong  
Makes me love all night long  
All night long  
  
Youre all I see  
Heavens here with me  
Need this time alone  
Send my spirit free  
Free  
  
Chorus  
  
My ritual
