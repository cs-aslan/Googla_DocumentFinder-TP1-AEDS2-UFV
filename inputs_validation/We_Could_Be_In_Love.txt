Be still my heart  
Lately its mind is all its own  
It would go far and wide  
Just to be near you  
  
Even the stars shining up bright  
Ive noticed when youre close to me  
Still it remains a mystery  
  
Anyone whos seen us  
Knows whats goin on between us  
It doesnt take a genius  
To read between the lines  
  
And its not just wishful thinking  
Or only me whos dreaming  
I know what these are symptoms of  
We could be in love  
  
I ask myself why  
I sleep like a baby through the night  
Maybe it helps to know  
Youll be there tomorrow  
Dont open my eyes ooh hoohoo  
  
Ill wake from the spell Im under  
Makes me wonder how tell me how  
I could live without you now  
  
And what about the laughter  
The happy ever after  
Like voices of sweet angels  
Calling out our names  
  
And its not just wishful thinking  
  
Or only me whos dreaming  
I know what these are symptoms of  
We could be in love  
  
All my life I have dreamed of this  
But I could not see your face  
Dont ask why to such distant stars  
Can fall right into place  
  
And its not just wishful thinking  
Or only me whos dreaming  
I know what these are symptoms of  
We could be in love  
  
love  
  
Oh it doesnt take a genius  
To know what these are symptoms of  
We could be oh hoh we could be  
We could be in love we could be  
We could be in love
