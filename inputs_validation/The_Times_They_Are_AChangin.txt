Come gather round people wherever you roam  
And admit that the waters around you have grown  
And accept it that soon youll be drenched to the bone  
If your time to you is worth savin  
Then you better start swimmin  
Or youll sink like a stone  
For the times they are achangin  
  
Come writers and critics who prophecize with your pen  
And keep your eyes wide  
The chance wont come again  
And dont speak too soon  
For the wheels still in spin  
And theres no tellin who  
That its namin  
For the loser now  
Will be later to win  
For the times they are achangin  
  
Come senators congressmen  
Please heed the call  
Dont stand in the doorway  
Dont block the hall  
For he that gets hurt  
Will be he who has stalled  
Theres a battle  
Outside and its ragin  
Itll soon shake your windows  
And rattle your walls  
For the times they are achangin  
  
Come mothers and fathers  
Throughout the land  
And dont criticize  
What you cant understand  
Your sons and your daughters  
Are beyond your command  
Your old road is rapidly agin  
Please get out of the new one  
If you cant lend your hand  
For the times they are achangin  
  
The line it is drawn  
The curse it is cast  
The slow one now will  
Later be fast  
As the present now  
Will later be past  
The order is rapidly fadin  
And the first one now  
Will later be last  
For the times they are achangin
