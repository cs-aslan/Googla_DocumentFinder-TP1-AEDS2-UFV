Its not like I made myself a list of new and different ways  
To murder your heart  
Im just a painting thats still wet  
If you touch me Ill be smeared youll be stained  
Stained for the rest of your life  
  
So turn around and walk away  
Before we confuse the way we abuse each other  
If your not afraid of getting hurt  
Then I am not afraid of how much I hurt you  
Im well aware Im a danger to myself  
  
Are you aware Im a danger to others  
Theres a crack in my soul you thought was a smile  
What ever doesnt kill you  
Is gonna leave a scar  
What ever doesnt kill you  
Is gonna leave a scar  
Im more like a silver bullet  
Than Im like a gun  
Im not easy to hold  
  
Im moving fast and if I stay in your heart  
Im certain that this will be the end of your life  
So turn around walk away  
Before we confuse the way we abuse each other  
If your not afraid of getting hurt then I am not afraid  
  
How much I hurt you  
Im well aware Im a danger to myself  
Are you aware Im a danger to others
