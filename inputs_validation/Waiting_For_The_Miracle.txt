Baby Ive been waiting  
Ive been waiting night and day  
I didnt see the time  
I waited half my life away  
There were lots of invitations  
And I know you sent me some  
But I was waiting  
For the miracle for the miracle to come  
I know you really loved me  
But you see my hands were tied  
I know it must have hurt you  
It must have hurt your pride  
To have to stand beneath my window  
With your bugle and your drum  
And me Im up there waiting  
For the miracle for the miracle to come  
  
Ah I dont believe youd like it  
You wouldnt like it here  
There aint no entertainment  
And the judgments are severe  
The Maestro says its Mozart  
But it sounds like bubble gum  
When youre waiting  
For the miracle for the miracle to come  
  
Waiting for the miracle  
Theres nothing left to do  
I havent been this happy  
Since the end of World War II  
  
Nothing left to do  
When you know that youve been taken  
Nothing left to do  
When youre begging for a crumb  
Nothing left to do  
When youve got to go on waiting  
Waiting for the miracle to come  
  
I dreamed about you baby  
It was just the other night  
Most of you was naked  
Ah but some of you was light  
The sands of time were falling  
From your fingers and your thumb  
And you were waiting  
For the miracle for the miracle to come  
  
Ah baby lets get married  
Weve been alone too long  
Lets be alone together  
Lets see if were that strong  
Yeah lets do something crazy  
Something absolutely wrong  
While were waiting  
For the miracle for the miracle to come  
  
Nothing left to do  
  
When youve fallen on the highway  
And youre lying in the rain  
And they ask you how youre doing  
Of course youll say you cant complain  
If youre squeezed for information  
Thats when youve got to play it dumb  
You just say youre out there waiting  
For the miracle for the miracle to come
