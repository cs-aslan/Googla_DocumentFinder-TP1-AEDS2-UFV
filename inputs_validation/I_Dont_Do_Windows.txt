You treated me like a doggone dog for so long  
But I went along to keep peace in our home  
But theres some things that I just wont do  
I think its time that I told them to you  
I dont do windows and I wont go to hell for you  
  
Although honey hell is what you put me through  
Ill do the clothes if you wont come unglued  
And Ill clean the stove to keep you in a good mood  
But youve been mean to me sometime  
I think I better tell you whats on my mind  
I dont do windows and I dont come to work til nine  
And if you make me mad I wont come to work any time  
  
I want Sundays off so I can go out and play golf with all the boys  
Honey Im tired of being just one of your toys  
And theres one more thing that you dont understand  
I wanna be treated like a natural man  
I dont do windows and I dont play second hands  
I said I dont do windows and I wont play second fiddle in your band
