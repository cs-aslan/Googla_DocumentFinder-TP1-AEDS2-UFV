Dolly Parton  
I cry awake at night and hug my pillow  
And pray that I will die before I wake  
No such luck  
Another day of cryin  
Dont know how much more my old heart can break  
Flooded with these memories and emotions  
The tears like rain keep on falling down  
They say that Ill forget  
But my face is just as wet  
As it was the day you left this town  
Drowning in this endless endless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
Its relentless and Im defenseless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
I cant believe that I can talk about it  
I never thought Id live to see this day  
But a broken heart wont kill you  
You just want to die  
But you have to go on livin anyway  
I feel it through and through  
And Ive never been so blue  
And I cried a river over you  
Drowning in this endless endless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
Its relentless and Im defenseless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
Oh Im drowning in this endless endless  
Drowning in this endless endless  
Drowning in this endless endless  
Drowning in this endless stream of tears
