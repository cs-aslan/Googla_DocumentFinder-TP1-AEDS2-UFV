Now Im behind glass  
Ill talk to you  
The telephone lines blind  
You have defaced my face  
I bet you laughed at me  
You bright young things  
And now I need noone  
I miss you so  
  
Please push no more  
Please push no more  
  
Now its all over for sure  
Ill walk back home  
We must all come down  
We all grow old  
We are close we are hurt  
So that was love  
And love she kills me  
It needs to so  
  
Please push no more  
Please push no more  
  
Please push no more  
Please push no more
