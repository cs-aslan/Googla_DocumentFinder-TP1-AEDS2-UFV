It dont really matter what you do  
It dont matter baby  
Baby I dont want to be in your shoes  
It dont really matter what you do  
Still never feel doubt about you  
Baby you aint got nothing to prove  
Still never feel doubt about you  
  
A b c d e f  
We picking up right where we left out  
And I took a reassess  
When I get back you going to take that off  
In the mural I hate me state me  
I make money  
Money dont make me  
Hey honey what do you take me for  
Dont look at me like Im crazy  
Dont ever think daddy faze me  
You aint fit to do that  
You aint crazy  
You aint built like that  
Hey baby what it feel like  
Just forget I said it screw it  
It dont really matter what you do when you do it  
  
It dont really matter what you do  
It dont matter baby  
Baby I dont want to be in your shoes  
It dont really matter what you do  
Still never feel doubt about you  
Baby you aint got nothing to prove  
Still never feel doubt about you
