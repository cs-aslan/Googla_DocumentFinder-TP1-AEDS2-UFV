Aint it great to be alive  
Aint it great to breathe  
Aint it great to have hit songs hidden up my sleeves  
I aint silly and my songs aint cute  
I dont fly like a bird I just shine for loot uh  
You can believe I aint close to done  
You talk hits youve never been close to one  
  
You aint supposed to run you can tell them I said that  
Quick from the get you know my hearts where my heads at  
Ill keep it comin with the oh oh  
Ill keep it comin with the oh oh

Spent the last six months sittin out in the cold  
You know I cried for help but I got put on hold  
We dropped double wide and you thought it would fold  
It wasnt lookin good but now your uncle went gold  
  
Sold five hundred thou like plow  
Pushed one million everybody went how  
Now Im two plus sittin two plush  
I dare your punk ass to ask me what  
I sold the farm and bought it right back  
I was sittin in the red but now Im back in the black uh  
  
Im in tact went from broke to plastic  
All my hoopties turned into classics  
Ive outlasted singin yes yes yall  
Got em all kinda hopin Ill return their calls  
And just when you thought that there was nothin to see  
You heard me comin around the corner hummin follow me  
And here I am Im live and direct  
Im makin everybody wonder what Im gonna do next  
I dont flex because thats not my style  
Ill be singin what Im bringin baby all the while and I  
  
Ill keep it comin with the oh oh  
Ill keep it comin with the oh oh  
Ill keep it comin with the oh oh  
Ill keep it Ill keep it Ill keep it  
  
Ill keep it comin with the oh oh  
Ill keep it comin with the oh oh  
Ill keep it comin with the oh oh
