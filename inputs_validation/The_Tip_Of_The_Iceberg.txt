Welcome back  
Winter once again  
And put on your warm fuzzy sweater  
Cause youll feel much better when  
  
The snowflakes fall  
Gently to the ground  
The temperature drops  
And your shivers freeze all the rivers around  
But I keep you warm  
  
If speeds a pro  
Inertia must be a con  
Cause the cold wind blows at precise rates  
When Ive got my ice skates on  
  
If all the roads  
Were paved with ice that wouldnt thaw or crack  
I could skate from Maine to Nebraska  
Then on to Alaska and back  
Cause you keep me warm  
  
Peer over the edge  
Can you see me  
Rivulets flow from your eyes  
Paint runs from your mouth  
Like a waterfall  
And your lungs crystallize  
  
Ill travel the subzero tundra  
Ill brave glaciers and frozen lakes  
And thats just the tip of the iceberg  
Ill do whatever it takes  
To change  
  
Farewell powdery paradise  
Wed rather skate on the thinnest ice  
Fingers failed us before they froze  
Frostbite bit down on all our toes  
  
Snow drifts build up and enfold us  
As we wait out this winter storm  
So we snuggle close in the darkness  
And keep each other so warm
