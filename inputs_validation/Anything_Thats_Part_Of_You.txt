I memorized the note you sent  
Go to all the places that we went  
I seem to search the whole day through  
For anything thats part of you  
  
I kept a ribbon from your hair  
A breath of perfume lingers there  
It helps to cheer me when Im blue  
Anything thats part of you  
  
Oh how it hurts to miss you so  
When I know you dont love me anymore  
To go on needing you  
Knowing you dont need me  
  
No reason left for me to live  
What can I take what can I give  
When Id give all of someone new  
For anything thats part of you
