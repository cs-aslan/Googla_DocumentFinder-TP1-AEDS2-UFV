Hey Ho Lets Go  
Hey Ho Lets Go  
Hey Ho Lets Go  
Hey Ho Lets Go  
  
Youre fallin in a straight line  
Youre going through a tight wind  
The kids are losing their minds  
The Blitzkrieg Bop  
  
Were piling in the back seat  
Were generating steam heat  
Pulsing to the backbeat  
Blitzkrieg Bop  
  
Hey ho lets go  
Shootem in the back now  
What they want I dont know  
Theyre all reved up and ready to go  
  
Theyre forming in a straight line  
Theyre going through a tight wind  
The kids are losing their minds  
The Blitzkrieg Bop  
  
Theyre piling in the back seat  
Theyre generating steam heat  
Pulsating to the back beat  
The Blitzkrieg Bop  
  
Hey ho lets go  
Shootem in the back now  
What they want I dont know  
Theyre all reved up and ready to go  
  
Ya  
  
Hey Ho Lets Go  
Hey Ho Lets Go  
Hey Ho Lets Go  
Hey Ho Lets Go
