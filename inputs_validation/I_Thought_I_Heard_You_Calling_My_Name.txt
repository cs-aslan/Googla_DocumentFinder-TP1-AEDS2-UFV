I said goodbye to you this mornin  
With only these words to explain  
I said Id found someone I love better  
But I still hear your voice call my name  
  
I thought I heard you callin my name  
Funny I still feel this way  
Your voice seem so close but I knew  
That by now you were many miles away  
  
I walk through the streets of the city  
People passing by think its so strange  
Im talkin but theres no one beside me  
I thought I heard you call my name  
  
I thought I heard you callin my name  
Funny I still feel this way  
Your voice seems so close but I knew  
That by now youre many miles away  
  
I thought I heard you callin my name
