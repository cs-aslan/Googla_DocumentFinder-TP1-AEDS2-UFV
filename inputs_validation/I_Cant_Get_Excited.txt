Every since feeling now would take my life into a year ago  
You say you love me again  
I cant say what I cannot do  
Its been too long without someone  
How could you let me sink this far away from you  
Now youre here wondering why you cant get near  
  
I cant get excited cant get excited  
Theres a thousand things to do  
I cant do anything with you  
I cant get excited cant get excited  
You can see me look right through  
I dont feel like I used to do  
  
Im turning back the pages now  
I pleaded with you all so many times  
Trying just to make you see  
Hoping that I might be the one  
So come down love me and itll be alright  
The time to bring back love is not tonight  
I never thought Id have to say  
that you should leave and go your way  
  
I cant get excited cant get excited  
Theres a thousand things to do  
I cant do anything with you  
I cant get excited cant get excited  
You can see me look right through  
I dont feel like I used to do  
  
Not in love still not in love with you  
Not in love Im still not in love with you  
Not in love still not in love with you  
Not in love  
  
Tell me why you cant leave me lonely  
Tell me why Im taking a chance on you  
Taking a chance on you  
Taking a chance on you  
Taking a chance on you  
  
I cant get excited cant get excited  
Theres a thousand things to do  
I cant do anything with you  
I cant get excited cant get excited  
You can see me look right through  
I dont feel like I used to do  
  
Cant get excited I cant get excited  
You can see me look right through  
I dont feel like I use to do  
Cant get excited I cant get excited  
Theres a thousand things to do  
I cant do anything with you  
I cant get excited cant get excited
