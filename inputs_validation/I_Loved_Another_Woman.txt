My babys gone and left me  crying by myself  
My babys gone and left me  crying by myself  
I loved another woman  I lost my best gal  
  
She was a real good woman  she didnt me no harm  
She was a real good woman  she wouldnt do me no harm  
But I loved another woman  now shes up and shes gone  
  
Well come back baby  I know I treated you wrong  
Well come back baby  I know I treated you wrong  
I loved another woman  now I wont do that no more
