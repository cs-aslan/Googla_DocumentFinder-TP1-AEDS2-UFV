Why should I cry I never done you wrong  
I kept my vows you left me all alone  
You told me you loved me you told me a lie  
Why should I pay Tell me why should I cry  
You knew I worshiped you right from the start  
Gave you my love never thought that wed part  
You didnt care enough to even say goodbye  
Why should I pay Tell me why should I cry  
You know I miss you now that youre gone  
Life can be sad when youre livin all alone  
But darlin Ill forget you your memory will die  
Why should I pay Tell me why should I cry
