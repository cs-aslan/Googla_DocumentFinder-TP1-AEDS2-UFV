That day That day  
What a mess what a marvel  
I walked into that cloud again  
And I lost myself  
And Im sad sad sad  
Small alone scared  
Craving purity  
A fragile mind and a gentle spirit  
  
That day That day  
What a marvelous mess  
This is all that I can do  
Im done to be me  
Sad scared small alone beautiful  
Its supposed to be like this  
I accept everything  
Its supposed to be like this  
  
That day That day  
I lay down beside myself  
In this feeling of pain sadness  
Scared small climbing crawling  
Towards the light  
And its all that I see and  
Im tired and Im right  
And Im wrong  
And its beautiful  
  
That day That day  
What a mess what a marvel  
Were all the same  
But no one thinks so  
And its okay  
And Im small and Im divine  
And its beautiful  
And its coming  
And its already here  
And its absolutely perfect  
  
That day That day  
When everything was a mess  
And everything was in place  
And theres too much hurt  
Sad small scared alone  
And everyones a cynic  
And its hard and its sweet  
But its supposed to be like this  
  
That day That day  
When I sat in the sun  
And I thought and I cried  
Cause Im sad scared small  
Alone strong  
And Im nothing and Im true  
Only a brave man can break through  
And its all okay  
Yeah its okay  
  
That day That day  
I lay down beside myself  
In this feeling of pain sadness  
Scared small climbing crawling  
Towards the light  
And its all that I see and  
Im tired and Im right  
And Im wrong  
And its beautiful  
  
That day That day  
What a mess what a marveleous mess  
Were all the same  
But no one thinks so  
And its okay  
And Im small and Im divine  
And its beautiful  
And its coming  
And its already here  
And its absolutely perfect
