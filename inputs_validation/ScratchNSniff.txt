They were two lonely folks doin the dos and donts  
And got the notion together theyd be happy  
Thought theyd lose the crowd n do the mess around  
Decided to make it snappy  
  
Just a twist of fate they didnt hesitate  
Now they had another party to lean on  
She made him jump and sang he made her share that thang  
  
Looks like they gonna have a ball aint nothin wrong at all  
Wo they gonna have a ball  
  
They got to askin what if they had to scratchnsniff  
To find out what it is they are after  
Got the ants out their pants n took the chance on romance  
Made some plans to make it forever  
Now several years have gone they still gettin along  
They know what true love is made of  
Now they know that lifes a trip with all its bumps and dips  
  
They gonna help one another along  
Nothin wrong at all still havin a ball  
Lord they really gettin it on  
  
Time is on their side they got nothin to hide  
Never had no secrets between them  
He dont need to accuse her use her or abuse her  
And she feels the same for him  
  
And those vows they made said nothin bout slaves  
And didnt mention rentin to own  
They can take the stand that walkin hand in hand  
What they got is gooder than gold  
  
Aint nothin wrong at all wo they gonna have a ball  
Yeah they really got it all  
Love is true hearts desire without its just a funeral pyre  
Got to let your true love grow its all you got thats gooder than gold  
  
Lets get it on yall
