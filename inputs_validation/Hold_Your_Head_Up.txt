And if its bad  
Dont let it get you down  
You can take it  
And if it hurts  
Dont let them see you cry  
You can make it  
  
Just hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head high  
  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head high  
  
And if they stare just let them  
Burn their eyes on you moving  
And if they shout dont let it change  
A thing that youre doing  
  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head high  
  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head high  
  
Hold your head up  
Hold your head up  
Hold your head up  
Hold your head up  
  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head high  
  
And if they stare just let them  
Burn their eyes on you moving  
And if they shout dont let it change  
A thing that youre doing  
  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head high  
  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head high  
  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head high  
  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head high  
  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up woman  
Hold your head up
