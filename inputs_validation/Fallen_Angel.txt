Fallen angel  
  
Everyone I see reminds me of you  
I keep turnin round  
Expectin you to be there  
I keep seein our past  
Through my looking glass  
But fallen angel  
Where are you now  
  
After all these years  
I remember the tears  
When we parted you said  
Dont forget me  
You were ridin so high  
Now theyre passin you by  
Girl Ive never forgot you  
Please come and get me  
  
Livin without you is  
Hard enough anyway  
But knowin youre hurtin  
Makes it so much worse every day  
  
I just wanna love you  
Any way that I can  
And watching you cry wasnt  
Part of my plan  
  
Tell me how did it feel  
In your promised land  
That you chose as  
Your pain and your pleasure  
A temporary sanctuary  
Oh fallen angel  
Im your real treasure
