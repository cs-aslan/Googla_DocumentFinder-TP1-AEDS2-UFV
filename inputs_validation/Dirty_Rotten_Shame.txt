I recall the good old days  
But thankfully theyve gone  
Now the ponies all are broken nags  
That stumble as they groan  
And throw the jockeys from their throne  
When there are pitches left to dodge  
And lions left to tame  
But its nothing but a dirty rotten shame  
Its a dirty rotten shame  
That when youre frivolous and strong  
It isnt youth its fearlessness  
That has been wasted on the young  
The cruel are in the cradle  
And the bishops in the bag  
Its nothing but a dirty rotten shame  
  
Now I find life a millionaire  
That brags for rags and jewels  
A snarling pup is wild enough  
But as his anger proves  
Hes left to sharpen useless tools  
That tear and graze and finer phrase  
But few are worth the name  
Its nothing but a dirty rotten shame  
  
Its a dirty rotten shame  
And that is not an idle boast  
When all your courage and your strength  
Will leave you as you need it most  
When there are lamps to dampen  
And cauliflowers to flip  
Its nothing but a dirty rotten shame
