Sometimes theres a time you must say goodbye  
Though it hurts you must learn to try  
I know Ive got to let you go  
But I know anywhere you go  
Youll never be far  
Cause like the light of a bright star  
Youll keep shining in my life  
Youre gonna be right  
  
Here in my heart  
Thats where youll be  
Youll be with me  
Here in my heart  
No distance can keep us apart  
Long as youre here in my heart  
  
Wont be any tears falling from these eyes  
Cause when loves true love never dies  
It stays alive forever  
Time cant take away what we have  
I will remember our time together  
You might think our time is through  
But I still have you  
  
Here in my heart  
Thats where youll be  
Youll be with me  
Here in my heart  
No distance can keep us apart  
Long as youre here in my heart  
  
I know youll be back again  
And till then  
My love is waiting  
  
Here in my heart  
Thats where youll be  
Youll be with me  
Here in my heart  
No distance can keep us apart  
Long as youre here in my heart  
  
Tracy I Love You
