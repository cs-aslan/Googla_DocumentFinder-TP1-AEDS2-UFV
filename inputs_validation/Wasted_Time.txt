I Used to think that weve come too far to give up now  
Now I see that youre really not the one for me  
I constantly try to show my love do everything  
But now I think if I voice my love how wrong could it be  
  
Chorus  
I never knew it before I always thought Id be sure  
I plan to be with only you forever  
But how can we just go on  
Now that I know its so wrong  
We cant spend another day together  
  
You should go I no longer feel like wasting time  
With you goodbye cause I dont need you with me  
Its time you know that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time and its all because of you  
  
I was blind couldnt see the writing on the wall  
In my mind you were the only one to be with me  
I cant believe that it took so long to figure out  
The games you play now the truth is clear I have no doubt  
  
Chorus  
  
You should go I no longer feel like wasting time  
With you goodbye cause I dont need you in my life  
Its time you know that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time and I wont waste my time with you no more  
You should go I dont want to feel like wasting time  
With you goodbye you can leave you can leave  
Its time you know that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time and I never knew  
  
Chorus  
  
You should go I no longer feel like wasting time  
With you goodbye  
Its time you know that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time  
Everything I tried to do but it did not work  
You should go I no longer feel like wasting time  
With you goodbye  
Its time you know that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time
