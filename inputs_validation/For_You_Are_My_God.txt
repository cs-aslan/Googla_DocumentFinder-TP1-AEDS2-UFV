You are the hope of my soul  
You are the sun in my world  
I lay down my heart  
My lifes in your loving hands  
More than my hopes and my dreams  
More than what my eyes could see  
Your love consumes me  
You grace is all that I need  
Chorus  
For you are my god  
You are my king  
Ill sing your name  
And Ill shout out your fame  
In your presence is where I belong  
For you are my god  
You are my king  
Jesus you only you are my everything
