Heaven knows youre with me now  
Heaven knows that youre here  
I feel your breath all around me now  
And all the pain just disappears  
It goes away it goes away  
  
And it only hurts when you cry  
Im alone inside when theres tears in your eyes  
I cant hide and say Im fine  
But it only hurts when you cry  
  
You carry too much on your shoulders  
I cant wait till you let me down  
Cause the only thing were getting is older  
This time never comes back around  
You just gave it gave it away  
  
And it only hurts when you cry  
Im alone inside when theres tears in your eyes  
I cant hide and say Im fine  
But it only hurts when you cry  
When you cry  
  
Heaven knows youre with me now  
And Ill do my best to hold on  
Cause nothing is worth all this fighting now  
And I wont give up till its gone  
Make it go away go away  
Make it go away go away  
  
Cause it only hurts when you cry  
Im alone inside when theres tears in your eyes  
I cant hide and say Im fine  
But it only hurts when you cry
