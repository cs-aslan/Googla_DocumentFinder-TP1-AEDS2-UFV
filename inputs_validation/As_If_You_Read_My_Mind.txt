Close your eyes til the morning  
Close your eyes til the early dew  
Get inside what youve been missing  
Are the very first words that I heard coming from you  
  
Take a chance on the secret  
That you hide for beneath your dreams  
Use your wildest imagination  
You just tell me what it is and I will make it be  
  
As if you read my mind  
As if you touched my soul  
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go  
  
Lets get high on the happy  
With a toast to you and me  
Love is here just for the giving  
And between us weve got all the love well ever need  
  
As if you read my mind  
As if you touched my soul  
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go  
  
As if you read my mind  
As if you touched my soul  
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go  
  
As if you read my mind  
As if you touched my soul  
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go  
  
As if you read my mind  
As if you touched my soul  
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go
