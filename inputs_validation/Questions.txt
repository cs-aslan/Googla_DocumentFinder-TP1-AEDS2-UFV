Its everything we do while were here  
A fear or a thought a feeling or a dream  
Touch it and taste it breathe it all in  
Say what you feel things arent what they seem  
Why live why breathe  
Why breed why die  
These questions all tied up inside  
Its all or nothing or what you make it  
A prize or a secret Which path do you take  
Decisions and gambles a goal to be scored  
Risks and lies We all make mistakes  
Why live why breathe  
Why breed why die  
These questions all tied up inside  
Thoughts without pictures  
Looks without seeing  
Words without reason  
Touch without feeling  
Life is your reward  
Not to be ignored  
Why ask the questions when theres no answer  
Why play the game when theres no way to win  
Why ask the questions when theres no answers  
Why seek the truth when the truth is within
