Does it diminish your  
Supercapacity to love  
  
Walk like a matador  
Dont be chickenshit  
And turn breezes into rivulets  
  
Flamencosweep the air  
And weave the sun  
And stamp your feet for everyone  
  
Does it exhibit your  
Natural tendency to hate  
  
Maybe a prostitute  
Could teach you  
How to take a compliment  
  
Maybe Ill go to New York  
Ill drag you there  
You said no one drags me  
Anywhere  
  
Does it diminish your  
Supercapacity to love
