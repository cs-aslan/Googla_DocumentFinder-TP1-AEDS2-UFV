Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I wont feel blue  
Like I always do  
Cause somewhere in the crowd theres you  
  
I was sick and tired of everything  
When I called you last night from Glasgow  
All I do is eat and sleep and sing  
Wishing every show was the last show  
Wishing every show was the last show  
So imagine I was glad to hear youre coming  
Glad to hear youre coming  
Suddenly I feel all right  
And suddenly its gonna be  
And its gonna be so different  
When Im on the stage tonight  
  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
Suppper Trooppper  
Smiling having fun  
Suppper TrooppperFeeling like a number one  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I wont feel blue  
Suppper Trooppper  
Like I always do  
Suppper Trooppper  
  
Cause somewhere in the crowd theres you  
  
Facing twenty thousand of your friends  
How can anyone be so lonely  
Part of a success that never ends  
Still Im thinking about you only  
Still Im thinking about you only  
There are moments when I think Im going crazy  
Think Im going crazy  
But its gonna be alright  
Youll soon be changing everything  
Everything will be so different  
When Im on the stage tonight  
  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
Suppper Trooppper  
Smiling having fun  
Suppper Trooppper  
Feeling like a number one  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I wont feel blue  
Suppper TrooppperLike I always do  
Suppper Trooppper  
Cause somewhere in the crowd theres you  
  
So Ill be there when you arrive  
The sight of you will prove to me Im still alive  
And when you take me in your arms  
And hold me tight  
I know its gonna mean so much tonight  
  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
Suppper Trooppper
