If Im caught at a dance party without my dancin shoes  
And everybody dances on my bare feet  
Shame on me  
If Im mindin my business just doin the right thing  
And you try to front me off in the street  
Shame on you  
If a familys waiting for that special blessing to  
Come their way  
But they aint tryin to get on their knees and pray  
Shame on them  
And if we live in a time where every nations fightin  
Round the world  
Yet we cant all agree that peace is the way  
  
Chorus  
Shame on us  
Shame on me Shame on you Shame on them Shame on us  
Shame on us  
Shame on me Shame on you Shame on them Shame on us  
So what the fuss  
  
If I gotta get up early in the morning for a job  
Interview  
And I forget to set the stupid alarm  
Shame on me  
If my children are playin outside like little children do  
And you come round there tryin to bring them some harm  
Shame on you  
Should I be drivin through a Klantown find a restaurant  
To get me some food  
And someone says hey boy we dont serve your kind  
Shame on them  
And if we live in a democracy and you dont use your  
Power to vote  
Knowin some would like to turn back the hands of time  
  
Chorus  
  
If Im hooked on a habit knowin damn well it could  
Cost me my life  
Yet I keep doin what I should do without  
Shame on me  
If youre locked in a marriage and your other half  
Just gives you abuse  
Yet youve convinced yourself that theres no way out  
Shame on you  
If were jammin the music and somebodys got the  
Audacity  
To say that they can jam it better than us  
Shame on them  
And should there be just a handful that believe that  
We are totally free  
And theres no need to fight for equality  
  
Chorus
