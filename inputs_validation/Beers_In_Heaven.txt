Beers In Heaven  
Tears In HeavenEric Clapton  
  
Wont it be a shame  
If theres no beers in Heaven  
Is God the one to blame  
If theres no beers in Heaven  
  
I must confess  
That Ill be pissed  
If God says He wont allow  
Beers in Heaven  
  
Is the preacher wrong  
He says theres no beers in Heaven  
How can you party on  
If theres no beers in Heaven  
  
No Michelob  
No Bud No Strohs  
Then I know I just cant go  
There to Heaven  
  
Beer is a friend to Man  
Beer helps you take command  
  
Beer makes things ok  
Beer helps to get you laid  
Get you laid  
  
Its gonna be a shame  
If theres no beers in Heaven  
Im not the one to blame  
If theres no beers in Heaven  
  
What will I do  
Without cold brew  
Now I know I just cant go  
There to Heaven
