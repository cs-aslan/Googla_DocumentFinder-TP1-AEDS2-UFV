Temptation  
Why wont you leave me alone   
Lurking every corner  
Everywhere I go  
  
Self Control  
Dont turn your back on me now  
When I need you the most  
  
Constant pressure tests my will  
My will or my wont  
My self control escapes from me still  
  
Hypocrite  
How could you be so cruel   
And expect my faith in return   
  
Resistance  
Is not as hard as it seems  
When you close the door  
  
I spent so long trusting in you  
I trust you forgot  
Just when I thought I believed in you  
  
Whatre you doing  Whatre you doing   
  
Its time for me to deal  
Becoming all too real  
Living in fear  
Why did you lie and pretend   
This has come to an end  
Ill never trust you again  
Its time you made your amends  
Look in the mirror my friend  
  
That I havent behaved as I should  
Everything you need is around you The only danger is inside you  
I thought you could control life but its not like that There are things
you cant control  
  
Lets stare the problem right in the eye  
Its plagued me from coast to coast  
Racing the clock to please everyone  
All but the one who matters the most  
  
Reflections of reality  
Are slowly coming into view  
How in the hell could you possibly forgive me   
After all the hell I put you through  
  
Its time for me to deal  
Becoming all too real  
Living in fear  
Whyd I betray my friend   
Lying until the end  
Living life so pretend  
Its time to make my amends  
Ill never hurt you again
