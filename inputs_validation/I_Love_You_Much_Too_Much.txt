I love you much too much  
Ive known it from the start  
But yet my love is such  
I cant control my heart  
I love you much too much  
I ask myself what for  
And darling when we touch  
I love you more  
Perhaps I hold your heart too tightly  
But who am I to say  
If I should hold it lightly  
It might slip away  
I love you much too much  
Youve never really known  
I love you oh so much  
Im yours alone  
Perhaps I hold your heart too tightly  
But who am I to say  
If I should hold it lightly  
It might slip away  
I love you much too much  
Youve never really known  
I love you oh so much  
Im yours alone
