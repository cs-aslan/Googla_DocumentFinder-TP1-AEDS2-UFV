Not like I need to depend upon anyone  
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all  
One more anthem for the knowitall  
I wont be standing up for long Id better learn how to crawl  
Learn how to crawl  
  
In ten minutes Ill be laying out flat on the floor  
  
Like I need to defend my own innocence  
So what I did it I admit it and Im pleading the fifth  
One more anthem for the knowitall  
I wont be standing up for long Id better learn how to crawl  
Learn how to crawl  
  
In ten minutes Ill be laying out flat on the floor  
  
Eight minutes Im losin it a little bit  
Five minutes your description might be starting to fit  
Three to go and Im forgetting all that Ive ever known  
I wont be standing up for long Id better learn how to crawl  
  
Not like I need to depend upon anyone  
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all  
One more anthem for the knowitall  
I wont be standing up for long Id better learn how to crawl  
Learn how to crawl  
  
In ten minutes Ill be laying out flat on the floor  
I cant stand up at all cant see nothing at all  
In ten minutes Ill be laying out flat on the floor
