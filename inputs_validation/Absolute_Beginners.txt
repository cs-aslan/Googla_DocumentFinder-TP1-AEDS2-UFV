Ive nothing much to offer  
Theres nothing much to take  
Im an absolute beginner  
And Im absolutely sane  
As long as were together  
The rest can go to hell  
I absolutely love you  
But were absolute beginners  
With eyes completely open  
But nervous all the same  
  
If our love song  
Could fly over mountains  
Could laugh at the ocean  
Just like the films  
Theres no reason  
To feel all the hard times  
To lay down the hard lines  
Its absolutely true  
  
Nothing much could happen  
Nothing we cant shake  
Oh were absolute beginners  
With nothing much at stake  
As long as youre still smiling  
Theres nothing more I need  
I absolutely love you  
But were absolute beginners  
But if my love is your love  
Were certain to succeed  
  
If our love song  
Could fly over mountains  
Sail over heartaches  
Just like the films  
Theres no reason  
To feel all the hard times  
To lay down the hard lines  
Its absolutely true
