Candace Me myself and I  
Dont see eye to eye  
Me myself and I  
Dont get along  
Me myself and I  
Can finally say goodbye  
This collaboration always felt so wrong  
Busting Candace Theres two of us on the scene  
And I dont want to sound mean  
But Ill tell you that Im happy without me  
Ive been holding me back  
But now Im on my own track  
Were done Finito Im free  
  
Romance Candace From here on out  
We can both exist peacefully  
Without all of this struggle and internal strife  
Busting Candace Internal strife  
Romance Candace Now that were separate we can do anything  
So dont let the door hit you  
Have a nice life  
Busting Candace Have a nice life  
  
Busting Candace Im through with myself  
Im better off without her  
Romance Candace Myself and I  
Busting Candace Im through with myself  
Im better off without her  
Me myself and I  
Dont get along  
Romance Candace Without her
