Were so ordinary  
Cant seem to break the hold  
Of every clown thats come before us  
And every story thats yet to be told  
And even though the paints not dry yet  
Theres someone with their tongue hanging out  
Cause something sour dont taste so bad  
When you can muzzle someone needs to shout  
And everyone whos watching now  
At the movie thats always re run  
Can throw a laugh and a stick in the pinks  
Who overrated or loud or were young  
And anyone whos looking out  
Just waiting for tall guys to fall  
Can rest assured in blankets now  
That nobody can be that small  
  
Bring him round the court house now  
Were lying naked and ugly and cold  
Dont play around the edges  
Play with something thats dusted and old  
And when were lying crying defensless  
Be sure that you get in a lay  
Cause something sour dont taste so bad  
Now theyll be forgetting you everyday  
  
And everyone whos watching now  
At the movie thats always re run  
Can throw a laugh and a stick in the pinks  
Who overrated or loud or were young  
And anyone whos looking out  
Just waiting for tall guys to fall  
Can rest assured in blankets now  
That nobody can be that small
