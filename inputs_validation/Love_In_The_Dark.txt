Verse 1  
Take your eyes off me so I can leave  
Im far too ashamed to do it with you watching me  
This is never ending we have been here before  
But I cant stay this time cause I dont love you anymore  
Please stay where you are  
Dont come any closer  
Dont try to change my mind  
Im being cruel to be kind  
  
Chorus  
I cant love you in the dark  
It feels like were oceans apart  
There is so much space between us  
Maybe were already defeated  
Ahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah every things changing  
  
Verse 2  
You have given me something that I cant live without  
You mustnt underestimate that when you are in doubt  
But I dont want to carry on like everything is fine  
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight  
Please dont fall apart  
I cant face your breaking heart  
Im trying to be brave  
Stop asking me to stay  
  
Chorus  
I cant love you in the dark  
It feels like were oceans apart  
There is so much space between us  
Maybe were already defeated  
Ahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah everything changing  
  
Bridge  
Were not the only ones  
I dont regret a thing  
Every word Ive said  
You know Ill always mean  
It is the world to me  
That you are in my life  
But I want to live  
And not just survive  
  
Instrumental Break  
  
Chorus  
Thats why I cant love you in the dark  
It feels like were oceans apart  
There is so much space between us  
Maybe were already defeated  
Ahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah everything changed me  
And IIIII dont think you can save me
