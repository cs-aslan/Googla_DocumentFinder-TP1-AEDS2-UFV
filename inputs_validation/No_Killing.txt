We dont want no killing Lord  
I dont want to see my brother die  
We dont want no killing Lord  
I dont want to to see my sister cry  
I dont want to see  
I dont want to see I I I I I  
I know that bad things are going down  
I I know that loneliness is all around  
I know that the world is starved for love  
Love  
Why know that theres good  
And theres evil  
And theres evil  
Disguised as good  
Theyre knocking at my door  
Theyre knocking at my door  
Dont let them in  
Dont let them in  
I think its the Milwaukee Police  
I think its the police  
I think its the polizei  
I think its the polizei I I I  
Everyday everyday everyday everyday  
I need your love love  
And its a bad bad score  
And I need you all the more  
I need your love  
Love
