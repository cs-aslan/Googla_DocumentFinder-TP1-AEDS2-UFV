We still have dreams  
And tears of love  
We make it babe  
Were strong enough  
We still have dreams  
Youve got a friend  
Young hearts are free  
Until the end  
  
Baby Ive been lonely for so long  
Lady Im tired of being alone  
Save me cause everybody needs some love  
Got a date with an angel baby  
Be my for ever lady  
  
Baby no one can ever love you more  
Lady Im the man youre looking for  
Save me my heartbeat is a loving beat  
Got a date with an angel baby  
Be my for ever lady
