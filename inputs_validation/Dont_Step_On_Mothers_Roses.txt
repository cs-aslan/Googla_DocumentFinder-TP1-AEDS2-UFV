We all were called to come back  
To the old home on the farm  
Mothers passed away what a mournful day  
And as my daddy watched  
His eyes were filled with pain and hurt  
When someone stepped upon a rose  
And crushed it in the dirt  
Dont step on Mothers roses Daddy cried  
She planted them the day she was my bride  
And every time I see a rose I see her smilin face  
She made my darkest days look bright  
Round the old home place  
Dont step on Mothers roses let em grow  
The way they did since many years ago  
Theyll bloom for me each year  
And Ill have Mother near  
Dont step on Mothers roses let em grow  
Years have passed away  
And how the old home place has changed  
Daddy had to go we all miss him so  
Children pick the roses as they go along the way  
But when their petals are abused I hear my daddy say  
Dont step on Mothers roses Daddy cried  
She planted them the day she was my bride  
And every time I see a rose I see her smilin face  
She made my darkest days look bright  
Round the old home place  
Dont step on Mothers roses let em grow  
The way they did since many years ago  
Theyll bloom for me each year  
And Ill have Mother near  
Dont step on Mothers roses let em grow
