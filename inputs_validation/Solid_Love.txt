We got a break  
Unbelievable  
We got a break  
Right in the middle of this  
Hollywood heartache  
We got this solid love  
All around the town  
Good hearts are going under  
Love bandits con and plunder  
Let nobody put asunder this solid love  
  
We got a chance  
Hot dog darlin  
We got a chance  
No more no more  
Flybynight romance  
We got this solid love  
Love has always made me  
Feel so uneasy  
I couldnt relax and just be me  
More like some strange disease  
Than this solid love  
  
Tested and blessed darlin  
Im gonna give you my very best  
Youre my hope  
Youre my happiness  
You  
Open my heart you do  
You open my heart  
You do  
Yes you do
