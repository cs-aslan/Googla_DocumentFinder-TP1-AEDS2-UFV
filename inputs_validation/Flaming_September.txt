The summer dying  
September lives in flames  
The sisters dancing  
No happy ending to the game  
Dont bother to call me  
Think Ill stay here just the same  
  
Chorus  
Flaming September  
What can you give me that is true  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
All the life I gave to you  
  
The summer dying  
September lives in flames  
My youth lies bruised and broken  
No happy ending to the game  
Dont bother to tell me  
Ill live on here just the same  
  
Chorus  
  
Flaming September  
What can you show me that is true  
My heart remembers  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
All the life I gave  
To you  
  
Flaming September  
Flaming September
