Rise and fall back up against the wall  
What goes around is coming back and haunting you  
Its time to quit cause you aint worth the shit  
Under my shoes or the piss on the ground  
  
No one loves you and you know it  
Dont pretend that you enjoy it and you dont care  
Cause now I wouldnt lie or tell you all the things you want to hear  
Cause I hate you cause I hate you cause I hate you cause I hate you  
  
I heard your sick sucked on that cancer stick  
A throbbing tumor and a radiation high  
Shit out of luck and now your time is up  
It brings me pleasure just to know your gonna to die  
  
No one loves you and you know it  
Dont pretend that you enjoy it and you dont care  
Cause now I wouldnt lie or tell you all the things you want to hear  
Cause I hate you cause I hate you cause I hate you cause I hate you  
  
Dickhead fuckface  
Cocksmoking motherfucking  
Asshole dirty twat  
Waste of semen I hope you die hey  
  
Red eye code blue Id like to strangle you  
And watch your eyes bulge right out of your skull  
When you go down head first into the ground  
Ill stand above you just to piss on your grave  
  
And no one loves you and you know it  
Dont pretend that you enjoy it and you dont care  
Cause now I wouldnt lie or tell you all the things you want to hear  
Cause I hate you cause I hate you cause I hate you cause I hate you
