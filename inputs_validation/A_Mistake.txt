Im gonna make a mistake  
Im gonna do it on purpose  
Im gonna waste my time  
Cause Im full as a tick  
And Im scratching at the surface  
And what I find is mine  
And when the day is done and I look back  
And the fact is I had fun fumbling around  
All the advice I shunned and I ran  
Where they told me not to run  
But I sure had fun  
So Im gonna fuck it up again  
Im gonna do another detour  
Unpave my path  
And if you want to make sense  
Whatcha looking at me for  
Im no good at math  
And when I find my way back  
The fact is I just may stay or I may not  
Ive acquired quite a taste  
For a well made mistake  
I want to make a mistake why cant I make a mistake  
Im always doing what I think I should  
Almost always doing everybody good  
Why  
Do I want to do right of course but  
Do I really want to feel Im forced to  
Answer you hell no  
Ive acquired quite a taste  
For a wellmade mistake I want to  
Make a mistake why cant I make a mistake  
Im always doing what I think I should  
Almost always doing everybody good  
Why
