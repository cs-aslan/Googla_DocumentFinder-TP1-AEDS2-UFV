Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like its gonna sweep my world away  
I wanna stop at Carmangale and keep on going  
That Duquesne train gon rock me night and day  
  
You say Im a gambler you say Im a pimp  
But I aint neither one  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Sounding like its on a final run  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like she never blowed before  
Little light blinking red light glowing  
Blowing like shes at my chamber door  
  
You smiling through the fence at me  
Just like you always smiled before  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like she aint gon blow no more  
  
Cant you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like the skys gonna blow apart  
Youre the only thing alive that keeps me going  
Youre like a time bomb in my heart  
  
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling  
Must be the mother of our Lord  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like my womans on board  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like its gon blow my blues away  
You old rascal I know exactly where youre going  
Ill lead you there myself at the break of day  
  
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed  
Everybody telling me shes gone to my head  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like its gon kill me dead  
  
Cant you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing through another no good town  
  
The lights on my native land are glowing  
I wonder if theyll know me next time round  
I wonder if that old oak trees still standing  
That old oak tree the one we used to climb  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like shes blowing right on time
