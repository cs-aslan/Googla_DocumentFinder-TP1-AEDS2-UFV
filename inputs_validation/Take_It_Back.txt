Its so fucked I am here doing this  
Its bullshit things dont end like this  
  
Im calling  
Staring into this place  
Where I cease to exist  
Wondering why do things always end up like this  
  
Chorus  
Jon Fly  
Take to the sky another dream of empty  
Jon Lies  
Of promises denied by a forgiving  
Jon God  
Who eats his young youre nothing you fucking  
Jon Fraud  
My belief was betrayed I lost my faith in you  
Jon Try  
To understand the sorrow and the  
Jon Why  
Of a light that should still be burning  
Jon Bright  
The angel in flight with a dog by his  
Jon Side  
When you took him away I lost my faith in even you  
  
Its so fucked I am here doing this  
Its bullshit things dont end like this  
  
Im calling  
Staring into this place  
Where I cease to exist  
Wondering why do things always end up like this  
  
Chorus  
Jon Fly  
Take to the sky another dream of empty  
Jon Lies  
Of promises denied by a forgiving  
Jon God  
Who eats his young youre nothing you fucking  
Jon Fraud  
My belief was betrayed I lost my faith in you  
Jon Try  
To understand the sorrow and the  
Jon Why  
Of a light that should still be burning  
Jon Bright  
The angel in flight with a dog by his  
Jon Side  
When you took him away I lost my faith in even you  
  
As I feel emptiness growing in my heart  
I cant help but scream into hating you  
I bet you think its funny  
You give us a gift and then you take it back  
  
Chorus  
Jon Fly  
Take to the sky another dream of empty  
Jon Lies  
Of promises denied by a forgiving  
Jon God  
Who eats his young youre nothing you fucking

When you took him away I lost my faith in even you  
  
As I feel emptiness growing in my heart  
I cant help but scream into hating you  
I bet you think its funny
