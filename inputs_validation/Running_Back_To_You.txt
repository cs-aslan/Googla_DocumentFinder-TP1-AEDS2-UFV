Boy youve been running around too long  
And I think youre running out of time  
No more jumping in and out of my bed  
Its time for me to draw the line  
So you think that you call me the only one  
Then walk out the door  
And you think that you can run around having fun  
And just come back for more  
I think that youre living in a fantasy  
Its got to be them or me  
So if you try it one more time  
Baby dont expect me to come running back  
  
Running back to you  
Then youll think about love all the good love  
I gave to you  
I wont come running  
Running back to you  
And Ill find someone somebody else to give it to  
  
Boy hope you see before to late  
I wont play the fool no not this time  
And Ill show you just how wrong you are  
To think I just cant get you out of my mind  
  
So you think that you can just play me off  
Then walk out the door  
And you think that you can just run around  
And come back for more  
I think that youre living in a fantasy  
Its got to be them or me  
And if you dis me once more  
Baby dont expect me to come running back  
  
Running back to you  
Then youll think about love  all the good love  
I gave to you  
I wont come running  
Running back to you  
And Ill find someone somebody else to give it to  
  
You cant just dis me when you want to  
Or come and go when you want to  
I hear youre playing around when you want to  
Any time that you want to  
Or just tell me lies when you want to  
I got more than you want ah  
Oh and by the way  
  
Running back to you  
Then youll think about love all the good love  
I gave to you  
I wont come running  
Running back to you  
And Ill find someone somebody else to give it to
