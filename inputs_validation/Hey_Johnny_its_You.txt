You got a dream youve got it bad  
But its just another one of those fads  
Just a joke gone up in smoke  
Leaves you dangling on the end of a rope  
Lost your money in a parking lot  
It was funny but its all youve got  
Youre walking home with sticky clothes  
And a very healthy overdose  
Oh Johnny its you and youre a love child  
Oh Johnny its you and youre a love child  
Aint got no shoes  
Aint got no job  
Aint got no decent banks to rob  
Aint got no rent  
You pitch a tent  
But the parking meter moneys spent  
You need a girlfriend like a kick in the head  
Sleeping all night solo with the grateful dead  
Yeah you know it aint easy  
Oh Johnny its you yeah Johnny its you and youre a love child  
Oh Johnny its you yeah Johnny its you and youre a love child  
Chorus repeats  
Youve got a dream youve got it bad  
But its just another one of those fads  
Its just a joke gone up in smoke  
Leaves you dangling on the end of a rope  
Youre walking home with stiky clothes  
And a very healthy overdose  
Yeah you know it aint easy  
Oh Johnny its you yeah Johnny its you and youre a love child  
Oh Johnny its you yeah Johnny its you and youre a love child
