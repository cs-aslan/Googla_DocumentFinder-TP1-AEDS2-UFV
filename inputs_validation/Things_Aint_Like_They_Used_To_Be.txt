Chorus  
Are you wondering why  
No one talks any more  
And all you hear  
Is the cry for war  
Are you wondering if  
There are people who  
Hurt inside the same as you  
  
There are greyfaced men always telling me  
Things aint like they used to be  
You kids have got no self respect  
Wake up old man to your neglect  
Its dog eat dog  
Its hand to mouth  
Its east and west  
Its north and south  
Just like you drummed it into me  
Things aint like they used to be  
  
Ill tell you why I cant afford  
To hang my hopes upon your word  
And when Im done Ill join the queue  
And take my chance no thanks to you  
Its in or out  
Its stop and go  
It isnt what  
Its who you know  
Ive heard you now can you hear me  
Things aint like they used to be  
  
Ancient rules for ancient men  
But this is now and that was then  
Dont lay your heavy hand on me  
And sink me in your poison sea  
Its us and them  
Its me and you  
Its guessing games  
Its what to do  
Exactly like you said to me  
Things aint like they used to be  
  
Chorus  
  
Are you wondering why  
No one talks any more  
And all you hear  
Is the cry for war  
Are you wondering if  
There are people who  
Hurt inside the same as you
