Oooooh Ooohhoooh  
Ooooohoooh  
Its such a mystery  
How he found something in me  
That I never knew was there  
He uncovered it so easily  
He turned me like a season  
And I began to change  
He wrapped himself all around me  
Now Ill never be the same  
  
Thats how love works  
Thats how love moves  
Like a river running through you  
Sometimes it lifts you  
As high as Heaven  
It consumes you thats a given  
Thats how love moves  
Ohh thats how love moves  
  
Ive seen walls that could never be broken  
Come atumblin down oh yes I have  
Ive heard the voice of love calling  
Without making a sound  
See I was touched by an angel  
The day he took my hand  
I know that hes the miracle  
That makes me eveything I am  
  
Thats how love works  
Thats how love moves  
Like a river running through you  
Sometimes it lifts you  
As high as Heaven  
It consumes you thats a given  
Thats how love moves

Oh sometimes its a storm  
Sometimes it reaches forever  
With its everlasting arms

Like a river running through you  
Sometimes it lifts you  
High as Heaven
