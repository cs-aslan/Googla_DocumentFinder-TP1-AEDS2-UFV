Were seeking employment  
Were ready and strong  
Knockin em down in the city  
  
Were knockin em down  
We dont care where they fall  
Knockin em down in the city  
And we dont tare what your name is  
Were only here to knock em down  
  
Were coming to your house to state our appeal  
Knockin em down in the city  
It doesnt take long cause the message is clear  
Knockin em down in the city  
You can change situations  
Go ahead and knock em down  
  
The world has its problems but I cant see how  
Knockin em down in the city  
I want expression and I get it now  
Knockin em down in the city  
And I dont care what your name is  
Im only here to knock em down  
  
Are you ready  
Are you ready to knock em down
