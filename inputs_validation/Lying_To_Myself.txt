I believed in you  
WhyD you leave when you  
Said that youD never let me go  
All I gave was love  
WasnT that enough  
Tell me the truth I need to know  
Refrain  
I can say to myself that I donT need you beside me  
That IVe finally put it all behind me but  
Chorus  
ID only be lying to myself  
And ID only be dreaming of what  
I know would not come true  
Coz no matter what I do  
To try to think IM doing well  
Reality is that IM still not over you  
I go everyday  
Trying to find my way  
Drifting into the empty roads  
Cryin every night  
These tears so hard to fight  
What do I do I just donT know  
Refrain  
I can say to myself that I never needed you anyway  
And after all IVe nothing more to say  
Repeat chorus  
Bridge  
I thought that it was never ending  
I thought that we were not pretending it was real  
I know my heart will soon be mending  
And after the rain the sun will soon reveal  
That I  
Chorus ii  
I have been lying to myself  
And I I have been dreaming of what  
I thought would not come true  
I know after what IM going through  
I will be doing well  
And when the day comes  
I know what ILl say is true  
That reality is IM finally over you
