If this is the life you crave honky tonks night and day  
Well I guess I have to learn to like it too  
Ill try hard to be like you I wanna do the same you do  
Ill meet you on your side of town because its you  
I could never love another if we go down well go together  
I wanna ride where the tight care is you  
Where the wine and liquor flow stay there till its time to close  
Right or wrong Ill tag along because its you  
 steel   
I could never love another  
Right or wrong Ill tag along because its you
