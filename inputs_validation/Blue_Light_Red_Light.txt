I live in a tiny closet  
A lukewarm cold water flat  
With room for a couple of cinders  
A mouse a hole and a trap  
I dont worry about the flights  
Or count the stairs  
cause I know  
Someones there  
  
I took a high paying sweepingup job  
Dusting after somebody else  
Seeing that theres clean on the windows  
Convincing the snow to melt  
I dont worry about the ride  
Or the subway fare  
cause I know  
Someones there  
  
One day well move uptown  
Or even out to the country side  
And for every leaf on a tree  
Well add one cub to the pride  
  
Who cares if the floor aint level  
Or if the ceiling falls in  
Haunted by the devil  
And ghosts and boogeymen  
I cant be concerned  
Why should I care  
No place Id go alone would compare  
cause I know  
Youre there
