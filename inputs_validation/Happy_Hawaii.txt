Agnetha Frida Early this morning I drove in the rain  
Out to the airport to get on the plain  
Hey Honolulu Im going to happy Hawaii  
Alice has been there she said it was fun  
  
Swimming and surfing enjoying the sun  
Hey Honolulu Im going to happy Hawaii  
After all I had to go through Im making no plans  
But I but I believe love gives me a second chance  
  
Guess Ive been working a little to hard  
Need a vacation Ill send you a card  
From Honolulu a greeting from happy Hawaii  
Its so exciting why should I pretend  
  
In a few hours the plane will descend  
Hey Honolulu Im going to happy Hawaii  
I can imagine the beach and the sand  
Walking with someone and holding his hand  
  
Hey Honolulu Im going to happy Hawaii  
After all I had to go through Im making no plans  
But I but I believe love gives me a second chance  
Ive got a feeling the dream will come true  
  
Someone is waiting and I forget you  
Hey Honolulu Im going to happy Hawaii
