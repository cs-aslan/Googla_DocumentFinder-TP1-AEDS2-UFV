My frustration wont subside Ive been tried time after time  
But its not my style to quit there is more to life than this  
In obscurity or fame were all playing in this game  
Searching for something searching for something  
  
Looking looking looking you will find find you will be fine  
  
Saturday in the morning and the rain kept falling  
Brother didnt get no sleep now hes really feeling beat  
But there is no time to waste as the devil test his faith  
He just walks away on a mission to complete  
  
Looking looking looking you will find find you will be fine  
Looking oh find you will be fine  
  
She has her hand on her jaw as she wonders away  
What will tomorrow bring will her dreams just disappear  
She find words are hard to say so she prays everyday  
She must find a way may the pieces fall into place  
  
Frustration wont subside Ive been tried time after time
