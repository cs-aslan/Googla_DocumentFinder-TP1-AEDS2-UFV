Lets dance  
Stop to fight  
We do the paradigm shift tonight  
Yeah its a natural drift alright  
  
And its coming up out of the blur  
Out of your mind from deep below  
The hidden harmonies discover  
Chaos which means order  
Evolutions not a model of yours  
  
For quietness is stronger than motion and silence is stronger than sound  
Were listening to the tone which is not played  
Nothing is what we want  
Nothing is what we get  
  
Nut the holistic moment of all  
Yes that is the way  
Do you hear the river flow  
  
You talked yourself into wrong questions  
You dont care about the answers  
You let the others be the good ones  
Youre part of the deathbringing system  
  
Theres no place where you can hide  
Stop chasing the wrong gods of time  
Im running out of time  
Time kills  
  
Youre lowering hopes much too much getting into the grind much too much  
And losing faith in your abilities  
The loyalty to your beloved system of belief must surrender  
To chaos which means order evolutions not a model of yours  
  
For quietness is stronger than motion  
Do you hear the river flow  
Do you hear it
