Youre the only one and only  
My hearts beating for  
I love you need I say more  
Now and ever well be together  
Of that you can be sure  
I love you need I say more  
  
I dont know just what it is  
That youre needing to hear me say  
The way that Im feeling is more than mere words can describe  
All this discussion could never  
Do justice to something so heavenlymade  
Id rather tell you  
With touches how I feel inside  
  
Let me hold you let me show you  
What true loves all about  
In these arms of mine I know you will find  
You wont do without anymore  
Ill love you forever need I say more
