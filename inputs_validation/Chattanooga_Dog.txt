Theres a fairground down in Chattanooga  
Where a kiddie train runs up and down the track  
Theres an old black hound that always hangs around  
And he chases that train down and back  
And Ive been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog  
Even though I know you dont care  
Ive been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog  
And it aint gonna get me anywhere  
  
Well Im thinking that youre like that old train anybody gets a ticket to
ride  
Im like that pup I wont ever give up Id do anything to be by your side  
Ive been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog  
  
Every day when the kids come for playing to ride that ole kiddie train once
more  
Theres that old faithful hound with his tongue hangin down  
And runnin till his feet get sore  
And Ive been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog
