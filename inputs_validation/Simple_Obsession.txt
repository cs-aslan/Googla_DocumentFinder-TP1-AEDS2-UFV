Simple Obsession  
What about us  
What about us  
What about us  
What about us  
What about us  
  
What about us  
Lets think about tomorrow  
With you not in my life  
What about love  
As I try to make it every day  
I live even for the day  
Out of what you go  
For its hard to say goodbye  
  
My simple obsession  
What about us  
What about us  
What about us  
I dont know what Im gonna do without you  
What about us  
What about us  
What about it  
What about us  
My simple obsession  
  
What about love  
Everyday Im fighting from this pain  
Im doin everything to be alright  
What about love  
As my beating heart keeps tellin me  
I dont want nobody in live but you  
I dont want to go  
For its hard to say goodbye  
  
My simple obsession  
What about us  
What about us  
What about us  
I dont know what Im gonna do without you  
What about us  
What about us  
What about love  
What about us  
My simple obsession  
  
What about us  
What about us  
What about us  
What about us  
My simple simple simple obsession  
My simple simple simple obsession  
My simple simple simple obsession  
My simple simple my simple obsession  
What about us  
What about love  
What about live  
I dont know what Im gonna do without you  
What about us  
What about it  
What about it  
What about love  
What about live  
What about pain  
What about love  
What about us

Oh my simple obsession
