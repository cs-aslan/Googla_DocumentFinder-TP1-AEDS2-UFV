Everybody gathered where the river runs wider  
At the edge of town  
To see if that Eddie Lee Vaughn baptism  
Was really gonna go down  
Folks bet hard earned money  
That water wouldnt change a thing  
They set the odds at a hundred to one  
His soul wouldnt never come clean  
Then the preacher said  
People take a moment or two  
There something we need to do  
Pray for the fish  
They wont know whats coming  
When the sin starts rolling off the likes of him  
Lord be with em they aint done nothin  
Please wont you leave them just a little bit a room to swim  
Pray for the fish  
  
Well the preacher ducked em under  
That cool clear water  
Then he did it again  
Eddie came up yelling  
Lord in heaven halleauh  
Im a brand new man  
Well the water got to bubbling  
Sky got to rumbling  
And the thunder backed up the choir  
The fish started jumpin  
It was like they was swimmin  
In a lake of fire  
Then Eddies momma stepped out of the crowd  
And started yelling out loud  
Pray for the fish  
They wont know whats coming  
When the sin starts rolling  
Off the likes of him  
Lord be with em  
They aint done nothing  
Please wont you leave em  
Just a little bit a room to swim  
Pray for the fish  
  
He said everybody cross your fingers  
Fold your hands  
Pray for ole Eddie  
But before we say amen  
Pray for the fish  
  
Lord be with em  
They aint done nothin  
Please wont you leave em  
Just a little bit a room to swim  
Pray for the fish  
Lord pray for the fish
