There were times when I thought there was nothin in this world  
There was nothin in this world for me  
Everywhere I looked there was trouble in my life  
Trouble far as I could see  
Hey theres a man doin alright  
Whats his philosophy  
He come over here and whispered in my ear  
Youre the Buddha youre the Christ  
Youre the Mohammed and the Mother Mary  
So who am I so nervous and shy  
To be brilliant and talented  
Its the light not the dark that frightens us most  
And the power lies in our head  
You playin small doesnt help at all  
The world need the things you give  
Switch yourself on turn the pressure on  
Youre the Buddha youre the Christ  
Youre the Mohammed and the Mother Mary  
There are times when I think theres plenty in this world  
Theres plenty in this world for me  
Anytime I see trouble in my life  
It becomes an opportunity  
Now theres a chance to make the world dance  
You do it unconsciously  
Help this Winter turn into Spring  
Youre the Buddha youre the Christ  
Youre the Mohammed and the Mother Mary
