When youve tried most everything and nothings taking you higher  
When you come to realize youve been playing with fire  
Hear me when I say to you its really down to your heart  
  
Its the beginning of a new love in sight  
Youve got the way to make it all happen  
Set it spinning turning roundabout  
Create a new dimension  
When we are winning we can stop and shout  
Making love towards perfection  
  
Ive been all around the world and seen so many faces  
Young and old a story told filling in my spaces  
Now without a trce of doubt I feel it every hour  
  
Its the beginning of a new love inside  
Could be an ever opening flower  
No hesitation when were all about  
To build a shining tower  
No explanations need to work it out  
You know weve got the power  
  
Parallel our sights  
And we will find that we we need to be where we belong  
Parallel our heights  
Display our rights and wrongs and always keep itSTRONG  
  
Its the beginning of a new love in sight  
Could be an ever opening flower  
No explanations need to work it out  
You know weve got the power  
  
Its the beginning of a new love inside  
Youve got the way to make it all happen  
Set it spinning turning roundabout  
Create a new dimension  
When we are winning we can stop and shout  
Making love towards perfection
