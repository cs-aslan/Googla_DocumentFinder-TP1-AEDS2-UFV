All alone not by myself  
Another girl bad for my health  
Seen it all through someone else and I  
Another girl bad for my heath  
  
Celebrated but undisturbed  
And serenaded by the terror bird  
Its seldom seen and its never heard Im  
Serenaded by the terror bird  
  
Never in the wrong time or wrong place  
Desecration is the smile on my face  
The love I made is the shape of my space  
My face my face  
  
Disintegrated by the rising sun  
A rolling black out of oblivion  
And Id like to think that Im your number one  
Im rolling black out of oblivion  
  
I wanna leave but I just get stuck  
A broken record runnin low on luck  
Theres heavy metal coming from your truck  
And Im a broken record running low on luck  
  
Never in the wrong time or wrong place  
Desecration is the smile on my face  
The love I made is the shape of my space  
My face my face  
  
We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise  
Coca Cola doesnt do the justice she enjoys  
We could all come up with something new to be destroyed  
We could all go down  
  
I love the feeling when it falls apart  
Im slow to finish but Im quick to start and  
Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark  
And Im slow to finish but Im quick to start  
  
Never in the wrong time or wrong place  
Desecration is the smile on my face  
The love I made is the shape of my space  
My face my face  
  
Never in the wrong time or wrong place  
Desecration is the smile on my face  
The love I made is the shape of my space  
My face my face  
Yeah
