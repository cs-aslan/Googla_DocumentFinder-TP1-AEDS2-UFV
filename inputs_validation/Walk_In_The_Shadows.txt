What You say youre through with me  
Im not through with you  
Weve had what others might call love  
You say its over now  
Whats done whats through  
You cant stay away you need me  
I need you  
  
When the fire starts the pains too much  
For your mind  
You need attention whats good is only mine  
I can cure the hunger that burns in your heart  
Just come to me  
Ill take you home  
Well walk in the shadows  
By day well live in a dream  
Well walk in the shadows  
  
You say you dont feel safe alone tonight  
Cause you feel the pressure building in your head  
Our secrets safe for one more night  
But when the morning comes remember  
Ill be with you  
  
Well walk in the shadows  
By day well live in a dream  
Well walk in the shadows  
One day youll be with me  
If only you believe
