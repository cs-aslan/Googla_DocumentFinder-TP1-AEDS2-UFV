More than anything in this world  
I just want you to be my woman  
More than anything in this world  
I want to be your man  
  
Id walk through fire  
Stand in the rain  
Ill go to hell and back  
On a plane  
  
Id scale the mountains  
Swim the seas  
I beg for mercy  
Down on my knees  
  
More than anything in this world  
I just want you to be my woman  
More than anything in this world  
I want to be your man  
  
I caused you sorrow  
Ive caused you pain  
But love is all we will have to gain  
I searched to whole world oh I  
And I want you to be my baby  
  
More than anything in this world  
I just want you to be my woman  
More than anything in this world  
I want to be your man
