Everyday I have to cry some  
Everyday I have to cry some  
Dry the water from my eyes some  
Everyday I have to cry  
  
There was a little boy I had planned to marry  
This was my love I didnt want to share it  
I thought that love would make my life bright and sunny  
He said he couldnt love me cause he didnt have no money  
  
So everyday I have to cry some  
Everyday I have to cry some  
Dry the water from my eyes some  
Everyday I have to cry  
  
I got me a boy  
I guess I really loved him  
Every night now I was thinking of him  
But you cant mix love with money  
cause if you do its gonna hurt somebody  
  
So everyday I have to cry some  
Everyday I have to cry some  
Dry the water from my eyes some  
Everyday I have to cry  
  
Although I know that hes just a poor boy  
Is it wrong to love cause hes not a rich boy  
Every time you mix love with money  
Every time you hurt somebody  
  
So everyday I have to cry some  
Everyday I have to cry some  
Dry the water from my eyes some  
Everyday I have to cry  
  
Everyday I have to cry  
Everyday I have to cry  
Oh oh
