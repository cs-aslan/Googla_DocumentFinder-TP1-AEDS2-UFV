Said you took a big trip  
They said you moved away  
Happened oh so quietly  
They say  
  
Shoulda took a picture  
Something I could keep  
Buy a little frame  
Something cheap  
For you  
  
Everyone says hi  
  
Said you sailed a big ship  
Said you sailed away  
Didnt know the right thing  
To say  
  
Id love to get a letter  
Like to know whats what  
Hope the weathers good  
And its not too hot  
For you  
  
Everyone says hi  
Everyone says hi  
  
Everyone says  
Dont stay in a sad place  
Where they dont care how you are  
Everyone says hi  
  
If the money is lousy  
You can always come home  
We can do the old things  
We can do all the bad things  
If the food gets you leery  
You can always phone  
We could do all the good things  
We could do it we could do it  
We could do it  
Dont stay in a bad place  
Where they dont care how you are  
  
Everyone says hi  
Everyone says hi  
Everyone says hi  
And the girl next door  
And the guy upstairs  
Everyone says hi  
And your mum and dad  
Everyone says hi  
And your big fat dog  
Everyone says hi  
Everyone says hi  
Hi hi hi hi
