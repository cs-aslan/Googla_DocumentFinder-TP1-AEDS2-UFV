Dreaming of the Queen  
Visiting for tea  
You and her and I  
And Lady Di  
  
The Queen said Im aghast  
Love never seems to last  
However hard you try  
And Di replied  
  
That there are no more lovers left alive  
No one has survived  
So there are no more lovers left alive  
And thats why love has died  
Yes its true  
Look its happened to me and you  
  
Then carriages arrived  
We stood and said goodbye  
Diana dried her eyes  
And looked surprised  
  
For I was in the nude  
The old Queen disapproved  
But people laughed and asked  
For autographs  
  
And there were no more lovers left alive  
No one had survived  
So there were no more lovers left alive  
And thats why love had died  
Yes its true  
Look its happened to me and you  
  
I woke up in a sweat  
Desolate  
  
For there were no more lovers left alive  
No one had survived  
So there were no more lovers left alive  
And thats why love had died  
Yes its true  
Look its happened to me and you
