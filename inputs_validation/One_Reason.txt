We had each other  
And we never knew how much we had  
Hurt one another  
till we took the good and turned it bad  
  
But now were so much wiser  
And we both know score  
Can we try just once more  
  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we shouldnt fall in love again  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we couldnt give our all again  
If you miss me like I miss you  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we shouldnt fall in love again  
  
Lets make it better  
Now that we can see where we went wrong  
Get back together  
In each others arms we belong  
  
Lets put the past behind us  
Weve both had time to heal  
So if you feel like I feel  
  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we shouldnt fall in love again  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we couldnt give our all again  
If you miss me like I miss you  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we shouldnt fall in love again  
  
If you need me like I need you  
Oh baby thats the one reason  
Why we ought to fall in love again  
  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we shouldnt fall in love again  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we couldnt give our all again  
If you miss me like I miss you  
Oh baby give me one reason  
Why we shouldnt fall in love again
