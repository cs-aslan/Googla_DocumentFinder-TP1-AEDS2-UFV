Dum dum dum rat oh too lets go steady again  
Dum dum dum rat oh too lets go steady again  
Lets go steady again like we did before  
Lets go steady again and be lovers once more  
Wear the ring around your neck like you used to do  
Dont you know its wrong to break up  
Cmon baby lets kiss and make up  
Lets go steady again like in the past  
Lets show all of our friends that our love can last  
I dont care of who was wrong  
Come back here where you belong  
Cmon baby lets go steady again  
Mondaywe said goodbye  
Tuesdayall we did was cry  
WednesdayI almost lost my mind  
ThursdayI was feelin blue  
Fridaywas the same way too  
Never had a day sad as Saturday  
Even Sunday was no fun day  
Lets go steady again like we used to do  
Say youre ready and then we can start anew  
Seven days we didnt speak its been a long and lonely week  
Cmon baby lets go steady again  
Dum dum dum rat oh too lets go steady again  
Dum dum dum rat oh too lets go steady again  
Dum dum dum rat oh too lets go steady again
