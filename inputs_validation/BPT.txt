I was in the county with lions most of these rappers be lyin

Thats a principle of proof the definition of logic  
That this nigga is a bitch  
Every chance he get he dogdin  
Brought back this West Coast shit and this the motherfuckin thanks I get  
All the licks I split from the houses I hit  
They brought him more cases in jail but a nigga aint snitch  
Thats how its sposed to go down  
Held it down didnt nobody else go down
