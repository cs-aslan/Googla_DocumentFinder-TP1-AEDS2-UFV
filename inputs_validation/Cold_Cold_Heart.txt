I tried so hard my dear to show that youre my every dream  
Yet youre afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme  
Now a memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart  
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart  
  
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue  
And so my heart is paying now for things I didnt do  
In anger unkind words are said they make the teardrops start  
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart  
  
Yeah there was a time when I believed that you belonged to me  
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory  
  
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart  
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart  
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
