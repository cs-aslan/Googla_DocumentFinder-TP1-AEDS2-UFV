In the temple of gods  
The day had come to come together  
In the early morning sun  
They saw that girl that come to heaven  
  
They ask her bout life on earth  
If it was getting any better  
She told em someone took her life  
If they could send her back  
Just one more time  
She knew that someone feels so blue  
  
Wouldnt it be nice hold on  
To spread the wings and fly dont kill the butterfly  
To see him one more time hold on  
To be a yellow butterfly dont kill the butterfly  
  
Hes been sitting on the bay  
Lost inside a cloud of darkness  
When I saw the butterfly  
Dancing in the wind  
The story goes  
He knew that she was still so close  
  
Wouldnt it be nice hold on  
To spread the wings and fly dont kill the butterfly  
To see him one more time hold on  
To be a yellow butterfly dont kill the butterfly
