When Were laying in bed  
And Were laying in love  
You and the blackness  
Fit me like a velvet glove  
Thats why I go crazy  
When you flick on your lamp  
Im dreaming  
  
Hang on to the night  
Hang on to the night  
Hang on to the night  
I dont want to see  
That dawn light  
Burn your window  
  
When were feeling drunk  
In a city park  
Put away that torch  
Im changed in the dark
