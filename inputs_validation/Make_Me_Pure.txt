Some will sing a song  
To reel em in  
Its a song I sung before  
And a song Im gonna sing again  
I mean every word  
I dont mean a single one of them  
Oh Lord make me pure  
But not yet  
  
Tell a joke  
Tell it twice  
If no one else is laughing there why am I  
I split myself both times and laugh till I cry  
Oh Lord please make me pure  
But not yet  
  
I dont have to try  
I just dial it in  
Ive never found a job that for me was worth bothering  
I got a ton of selfish genes and lazy bones  
Beneath this skin  
Oh Lord make me pure  
But not yet  
  
Smoking kills  
Sex sells  
Ive got one hand in my pocket but the other one looks cool as hell  
I know Im gonna die so my revenge is living well  
Oh Lord make me pure  
But not yet  
  
I stopped praying  
So I hope this song will do  
I wrote it all for you  
Im not perfect but you dont mind that do you  
I know youre there to pull me through arent you  
  
So I look for love  
I like the search  
And Ill be standing for election all across the known universe  
Let every president get the country she deserves  
Oh Lord make me pure  
But not yet  
  
And Ive been seeing  
Somebodys wife  
She said shed leave him for me and I said that wasnt wise  
You cant lie to a liar because of all lies  
Oh Lord please make me pure  
Not yet
