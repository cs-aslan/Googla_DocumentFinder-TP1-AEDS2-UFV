Think about what you want  
Think about what you got  
And all things thatll heal or hurt you  
Cause when that big barns full of peaches  
It dont matter what the preacher preaches  
The days are warm and the weathers full of virtue  
  
Yeah Jack and Jill went up the hill  
To fetch a pail of water  
Jack fell down and broke his crown  
Cause he was messing with the preachers daughter  
  
Open up your wings make a dead man sing  
Such a good good thing just cant be wrong  
Oh no no you cant get too much love  
Oh dont you feel it in your belly  
Go get you some  
You cant get too much love  
Oh time is right for loving so come on come on  
  
Can you feel it in your belly come on  
  
Mamas in the kitchen  
Daddys in the field  
Baby girl has gone to town cause she like the way it make her feel  
Swimming in the river rolling in the mud  
When the juice is dripping of your chin  
One peach is not enough  
You cant get too much love  
So if you feel it in your belly come on come on  
You cant get too much love  
Oh the time is right for loving come and get you some  
You cant get too much love  
Oh give it up give it up give it up give it up  
  
Oh the light that shines upon the gift that everyone has for the taking  
And happiness so pure as this is surely worth the making  
  
Yeah Jack and Jill went up the hill  
To fetch a pail of water  
Jack fell down and broke his crown  
Cause he was messing with the preachers daughter  
  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love love love love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love love love love  
  
You cant get too much love  
Oh if you feel it in your belly go get you some  
You cant get too much love  
Oh the time is right for loving so come on come on  
You cant get too much love  
Gonna eat your belly jelly til the kingdom come  
You cant get too much love  
So give it up give it up give it up give it up
