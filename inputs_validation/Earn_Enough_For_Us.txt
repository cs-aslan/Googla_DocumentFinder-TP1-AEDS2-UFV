Ive been praying all the week through  
At home at work and on the bus  
Ive been praying I can keep you  
And to earn enough for us  
  
I can take humiliation  
And hurtful comments from the boss  
Im just praying by the weekend  
I can earn enough for us  
  
Found a house that wont repair itself  
With its windows cracking  
And a roof held together with holes  
Just because were on the bottom of the ladder  
We shouldnt be sadder  
Than others like us  
Who have goals for the betterment of life  
Glad that you want to be my wife but honest  
Ive been praying all the week through

So youre saying that were going to be three  
Now a fathers what Ill be  
Dont get me wrong Im so proud  
But the belts already tight  
Ill get another job at night but honest  
  
I can take humiliation  
And hurtful comments from the boss  
Im just praying by the weekend

I can earn enough for us  
I can earn enough for us
