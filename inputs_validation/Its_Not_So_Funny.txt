Verse 1  
Walking round the town with nothing to do  
Rocknroll ringin in my ears  
Why adjust my mind just singin the blues  
Got to find a way out of here  
  
Chorus  
Its not so funny  
Just a kid nobody listens to me  
Aint got no money to do what I want  
Somethings got to set me free  
  
Verse 2  
You say when you grow up youll have what you want  
And everything that you need  
What is the use of having it all  
If you listen and never be seen  
  
Chorus  
  
If I could suddenly be older  
Id show them all and bring them down to my size  
  
Verse 3  
My parents tell me youre not the only one  
Theres a lot of kids around like you  
If all of us kids got together for fun  
Wed show you a thing or two  
  
No no no  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Its not so funny  
I aint got no money  
Its not so funny  
I aint got no money  
Its not so funny
