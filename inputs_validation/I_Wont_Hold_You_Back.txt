If I had another chance tonight  
Id try to tell you that the things we had were right  
Time cant erase the love we shared  
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared  
  
Now youre gone Im really not the same  
I guess I held myself to blame  
Time cant erase the things we said  
But it gives me time to realize that youre the one whos sad  
  
You know I wont hold you back now  
The love we had just cant be found  
You know I cant hold you back now  
  
Now that Im alone it gives me time  
To think about the years that you were mine  
Time cant erase the love we shared  
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared  
  
You know I wont hold you back now  
The love we had just cant be found  
You know I cant hold you back now  
  
You know I wont hold you back now  
The love we had just cant be found  
  
You know I cant hold you back now  
The love we had just cant be found  
  
You know I cant hold you back now  
The love we had just cant be found  
  
You know I cant hold you back now  
The love we had just cant be found
