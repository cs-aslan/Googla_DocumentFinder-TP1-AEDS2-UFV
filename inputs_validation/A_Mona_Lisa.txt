I Heard my Lisa say  
I cant believe you could leave me looking this way  
When ever music plays I smile and I cant feel anything  
All I want to sayAll I want to say  
Is everythings all right and Im ok  
Heard my Lisa today  
say he wants to paint the same me every single day  
whats wrong with him anyway  
Cuz sometimes I cant feel anything  
All I want to sayAll I want to say  
Is everythings all right and Im ok Im ok  
My bodys mapped before me  
On a flying carpet through the sky  
The same things that destroy me  
Well hang there waiting for me upon a wall outside of me yeah  
Heard my Lisa say  
god blesses the same things every single day  
Howd he miss me anyway 7 days and I cant feel anything  
My paint is smeared upon his wall  
Its a portrait we are 4 feet tall Just Leanardo passing days  
With a Mona Lisa cant feel anything All I want to sayAll I want to say  
Is everythings all right and Im ok all I want to sayall I want to say  
Is everythings all right and Im ok 7X
