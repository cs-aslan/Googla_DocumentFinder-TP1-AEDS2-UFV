How many tears must we cry before learning  
Things that we have theyre for real and were losing  
Cant get close enough to you cause youre just too far away  
  
Why do you believe that weve got something coming  
You took it all left me standing here with nothing  
Cant get close enough to you cause youre just too far away  
Too far away  
  
In your world you must be dreaming if you think you can survive  
Taking all and giving nothing thats a crime  
What makes you something special what about me Im here too  
You dont care what Im feeling and thats the truth  
Cant get close enough to you cause youre just too far away  
  
All I need is understanding and the right to survive  
Only you could see the warnings and pass them by  
What makes you something special what about me Im here too  
You dont care what Im feeling and thats the truth  
Cant get close enough to you cause youre just too far away  
Too far away  
Cant get close enough to you cause youre just too far away  
  
How many tears must we cry before learning  
Things that we had theyre for real and were losing  
Cant get close enough to you cause youre just too far away  
Too far away too far away too far away
