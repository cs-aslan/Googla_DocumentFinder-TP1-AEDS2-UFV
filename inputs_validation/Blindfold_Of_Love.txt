I keep bumpin into trees  
Eyes wide open I cant see mississippi downtown  
Were in the blindfold of love  
I cant find my way downtown  
Everything spins around and around mississippi downtown  
Were in the blindfold of love  
  
I was hooked right from the start  
And its tearing me apart  
That little girls got a bear hug on my heart  
I stay worried all the time  
I cant get it off my mind mississippi downtown  
Were in the blindfold of love  
  
Mississippi downtown Mississippi downtown  
  
Im as lost as I can be  
Being in love is killin me mississippi downtown  
Were in the blindfold of love  
I cant see across the street  
To recognize the friends I meet mississippi downtown  
Were in the blindfold of love  
  
I was hooked right from the start  
And its tearing me apart  
That little girls got a bearhug on my heart  
I stay worried all the time  
I cant get it off my mind mississippi downtown  
Were in the blindfold of love  
  
Mississippi downtown Mississippi downtown  
  
Well I was ahooked right from the start  
And its tearing me apart
