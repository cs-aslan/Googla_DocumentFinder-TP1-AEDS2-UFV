Im a rabbit in your headlights  
Scared of the spotlight  
You dont come to visit  
Im stuck in this bed  
  
Thin rubber gloves  
She laughs when shes crying  
She cries when shes laughing  
  
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away  
Away away away  
  
Im a rabbit in your headlights  
Christian suburbanite  
Washed down the toilet  
Money to burn  
  
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away  
  
If youre frightened of dyin and youre holding on  
Youll see devils tearing your life away  
Butif youve made your peace  
Then the devila are really angels  
Freeing you from the earth from the earth from the earth  
  
Rotworms on the underground  
Caught between stations  
Butterfingers  
Im losing my patience  
  
Im a rabbit in your headlights  
Christian suburbanite  
You got money to burn  
  
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away  
Away away away  
Away away away
