Youre always finding out  
About the things that people never talk about  
I didnt ask to know  
But now Im compensating as I go  
I know the script Im in  
Im only thoughts of heaven trapped in flesh and skin  
And from the world of men  
I try to tighten up the code again  
And the code is a play  
A play is a song  
A song is a film  
A film is a dance  
Boot me up on the Zen Machine  
Log me onto the Zen Machine  
Load me down  
Everybody get ready  
Hook me into the Zen Machine  
Sharing time on the Zen Machine  
Load me up  
Everybody get ready  
Sometimes its clear to me  
Then for a moment Im in timeless ecstasy  
There are no reasons why  
And everyones a passerby  
But when theyve gone to bed  
A fires burning on the screen and in my head  
And on a windy day  
You can smell it from a mile away  
And the smell is a note  
A note is a taste  
A taste is a hue  
A hue is a touch
