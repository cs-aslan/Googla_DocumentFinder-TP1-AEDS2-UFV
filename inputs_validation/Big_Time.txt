Im on my way Im making it  
Ive got to make it show yeah  
So much larger than life  
Im going to watch it growing  
  
The place where I come from is a small town  
They think so small  
They use small words  
But not me  
Im smarter than that  
I worked it out  
Ive been stretching my mouth  
To let those big words come right out  
  
Ive had enough Im getting out  
To the city the big big city  
Ill be a big noise with all the big boys  
Theres so much stuff I will own  
And I will pray to a big god  
As I kneel in the big church  
  
Big time  
Im on my wayIm making it  
Big time big time  
Ive got to make it show yeah  
Big time big time  
So much larger than life  
Big time  
Im going to watch it growing  
Big time  
  
My parties all have big names  
And I greet them with the widest smile  
Tell them how my life is one big adventure  
And always theyre amazed  
When I show them round my house to my bed  
I had it made like a mountain range  
With a snowwhite pillow for my big fat head  
And my heaven will be a big heaven  
And I will walk through the front door  
  
Big time  
Im on my wayIm making it  
Big time big time  
Ive got to make it showyeah  
Big time big time  
So much larger than life  
Im going to watch it growing  
Big time big time  
My car is getting bigger  
Big time  
My house is getting bigger  
Big time  
My eyes are getting bigger  
Big time  
And my mouth  
Big time  
My belly is getting bigger  
Big time  
And my bank account  
Big time  
Look at my circumstance  
Big time  
And the bulge in my big big big big big big big
