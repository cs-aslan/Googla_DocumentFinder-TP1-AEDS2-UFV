Nobody  
Can tell me  
I know  
I know better now  
  
Youre a kid  
Youre a brat  
Clean up your room  
Throw out the trash  
  
When I was your age  
I heard it all  
Like livin under  
Your Marshall law  
  
I would think it was  
For my own good  
I would think it was true  
  
Nobody  
Can tell me  
I know  
I know better now  
  
Gotta be in early  
Gotta go to school  
They dont like my friends  
I dont like those rules  
  
Im not a criminal  
Im not on drugs  
Dont wait up for me  
Im out havin fun  
  
I would think it was  
For my own good  
I would think it was true  
  
Nobody  
Can tell me  
I know  
I know better now  
  
Nobody  
Can tell me  
I know  
I know better now
