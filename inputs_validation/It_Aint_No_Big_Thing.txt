You tell me to find somebody new  
That youre not for me Im not for you  
It dont matter if youre right or wrong  
It aint not big thing just say so long  
  
Its been fun and laughter all the way  
I will live to love another day  
I will be alright cant you tell  
It aint not big thing just say farewell  
  
It aint not big thing I wont be blue  
Just so youre happy and your dreams come true  
It aint not big thing my losing you  
Just aint no big thing Ill get over you  
  
It aint not big thing to see you go  
It aint not big thing that you dont know  
It aint not big thing Ive been lying  
It aint not big thing that Im crying  
It aint not big thing that Im dying
