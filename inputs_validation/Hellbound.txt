Eminem  
Yo Slim Shady  
Yo Ill fuckin Ill  
Ill puke eat it and freak you eww  
Battle Im too weeded to speak to  
The only key that I see to defeat you  
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you  
And force feed you em both and on each feet is a cleat shoe  
Ill lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse  
Youll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you  
Bitch I aint no fuckin G Im a cannibal  
I aint tryin to shoot you  
Im tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you  
Wrap you in rope and plastic stab you with broken glass  
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress  
Coke and acid black magic cloaks and daggers ahhh  
Fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis  
Im so bananas Im showin up to your open casket  
To fill it full of explosive gasses  
And close it back with a lit match in it  
While I sit back and just hope it catches  
Blow you to fragments  
Laugh roll you and smoke the ashes  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
I see the light at the end  
But every time I take a step it gets dim  
Tell me is this hell were livin in  
If so heavens got to be better  
But if were hellbound whatever lets go down  
  
JBlack  
Am I the worst Because I never go to church never  
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse  
Ima drink til my liver rot see the doc  
Leave the ER then hit a bar for a liquor shot til the liver spot  
One day we all gon die  
But when I die Ima be so high  
That Ima get up and walk leavin the concrete bare  
With the chalk outline still there  
I smoke til I choke and I sex a lot  
I got a cross on my chain but its just a rock  
Now if I pray every night night  
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight  
You feel me God I done did so much shit while on Earth  
I smoke I drink I curse and to make matters worse  
I bust my gun first and then I chat with your corpse  
Since way back I was one to never like backtalk  
See me at the pearly gates in line wearin a Nordface  
Nickel nine at my waist God done lost faith  
Angels greet me but I dont reply back  
Just show me to my quarters and oh yeah wheres Thai at  
  
Chorus  
  
Masta Ace  
Analyze the strength of my game like Lee Corso  
Call me a lost soul with a vest on my torso  
And of course yo yall know Im no stranger to danger  
Like Christ in a manger feel a whole range of my anger  
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound  
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds  
My pen bout as sharp as a dagger walk with a swagger  
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her  
Ten blocks untie the bitch and I still bag her  
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager  
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel  
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel  
Everyday I grow more older and more colder  
Fly you to Colorado roll you over with a Boulder  
I know you want to retaliate but you wont dare  
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just dont care  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
But every time I take a step it gets dim tell me is this hell were livin in
