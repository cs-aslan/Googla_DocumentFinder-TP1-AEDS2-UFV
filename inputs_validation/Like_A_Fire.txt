Verse 1  
Like a fire  
Shut up in my bones  
I want the world to know  
That you are God  
With a passion  
Burning deep within  
I want the world to know  
That you live  
  
Verse 1  
Let your presence come and saturate  
Every part of me  
Make me new  
Let your spirit come and move within  
Fill me once again  
I need more  
  
Chorus  
Jesus Im desperate for you  
Jesus Im hungry for you  
Jesus Im longing for you  
Cause Lord you are  
All I want  
  
Bridge  
Come like a flood  
And saturate me now  
Youre all I want  
Come like the wind  
And sweep through out this place  
Youre all we want
