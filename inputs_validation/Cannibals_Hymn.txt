You have a heart and I have a key  
Lie back and let me unlock you  
Those heathens you hang with down by the sea  
All they want to do is defrock you  
I know a river where we can dream  
It will swell up burst its banks  
Babe and rock you  
But if youre gonna dine with them cannibals  
Sooner or later darling youre gonna get eaten  
But Im glad youve come around  
Here with your animals  
And your heart that is bruised but unbeaten  
And beating like a drum  
  
I will sit like a bird on a fence  
Sing you songs with a happy ending  
Swoop down and tell you that it dont make sense  
To attack the very thing youre defending  
Didnt I just buy that dress for you  
That pink paper pinafore that you keep mending  
Well if youre gonna dine with the cannibals  
Sooner or later darling youre gonna get eaten  
But Im glad youve come around  
Here with your animals  
And your heart that is banging and beating  
And banging like a gong  
  
I can see that theyve hurt you dear  
Here is some moonlight to cloak us  
And I will never desert you here  
Unpetaled among the crocus  
Allow me my love to allay your fear  
As I swim in and out of focus  
But if youre gonna dine with the cannibals  
Sooner or later darling youre gonna get eaten  
But Im glad youve come around  
Here with your animals  
And your heart that is bruised but bleating  
And bleeding like a lamb  
Banging like a gong  
Beating like a drum
