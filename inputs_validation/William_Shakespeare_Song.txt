My name is Shakespeare William  
I owned a feather quill I am  
The writer most familiar to you  
  
My way with words amazes me  
Came up with so many phrases me  
That still the number dazes me too  
  
Oh Youve got the be cruel to be kind  
If truth were known Love is blind  
Yet each of these quotes you will find  
Its what I do  
  
Seen better days Thats one of his  
Ah Salad days He is the biz  
All the worlds a stage  
They call me Billy Whizz  
  
May seem kind of scary  
Im a walking dictionary  
Sturdy with the wordy Shakespeare  
  
Quality of mercy is not strained  
Such stuff as dreams are made  
Off with his head  
My phrases youll note  
  
This is the short and long of it  
Brevity is the soul of wit  
As good luck would have have it  
You can quote  
  
Oh you suffered Greeneyed jealousy  
Please do not Stand on ceremony  
I wrote The Queens English  
Queens English I wrote  
  
Its Greek to me Thats a Shakespeare line  
Meal and drink to me He was the first to combine  
Infinite variety  
Yeah that was one of mine  
  
Dont call me flakey  
Im William Shakey  
Not lazy with the phrasey  
Shakespeare  
  
I was the greatest I was ace  
To find a better writer thats A wild goose chase  
I was truly brilliant which is why I sing  
You cant have too much of a good thing  
  
If music be the food of love play on  
  
Et tu Brute Did you ever know  
Forever and a day From a Shakespeare show  
Good riddance Fair play  
Pure as the driven snow  
  
High time Lie low  
Wherefore art thou Romeo  
The nations favourite bard  
Shakespeare  
  
Dooby dooby dooby  
To be or not to be  
Schooby dooby dooby  
Shakespeare
