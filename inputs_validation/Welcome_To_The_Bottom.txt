Welcome home its been a while  
Weve been expecting you  
You try to deny your family  
Oh but we came through so  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
The waters gone and the grain is back  
Its not exactly where you wanna be  
But were the only true friends youve ever had  
This company loves your misery so  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Welcome to the moment  
To the highlight of your life  
Welcome to the horror  
And theres no where you can hide  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
The acid burns and it takes its toll  
But we all get used to it  
Theres no give and take  
Its just push and pull  
It only hurts for a bit so  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Welcome to the moment  
To the highlight of your life  
Welcome to the horror  
And theres no where you can hide  
Welcome to the bottom  
  
Its so endearing how you thought you could change  
We know youll be happy  
You just need someone to blame  
Welcome back were back  
Were glad you know your place  
Its always there for you  
  
Welcome to the moment  
To the highlight of your life  
Welcome to the horror  
And theres no where you can hide  
Welcome to the moment  
To the highlight of your life  
Welcome to the horror  
And theres no where you can hide  
  
Welcome  
Welcome  
Welcome to the bottom
