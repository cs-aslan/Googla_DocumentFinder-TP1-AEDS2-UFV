Dont stop isnt it funny how you shine  
Dont stop isnt it funny how you shine  
Here the sea spray give  
I was with her  
Were under the ship so get me over  
  
Now that was me listen  
Now she fishes now listen  
There was no one out there we used  
There is the news for me useless  
  
Now so much waste  
How well be teased  
Dont stop isnt it funny how you shine  
Dont stop isnt it funny how you shine  
  
Oh wont you just ask me youre an imbecile  
Whats the matter for everyone I feel  
Pain blues singer  
Hes playing just a guitar from the top  
  
I wake I still look I feel loose  
Were all here now whose the first ease into my heart  
He must be one of us  
  
Dont stop isnt it funny how you shine  
Dont stop isnt it funny how you shine
