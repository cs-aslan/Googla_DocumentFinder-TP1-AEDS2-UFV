Old Queen Cole got to take control  
You drinking whiskey and wine and it tastes just fine  
For you now Nicki life is getting tricky  
And youre running out of gas driving way too fast  
  
Full throttle in gear trying hard to steer you  
Toward immaculate conception heavy metal perception  
Theres a world thats all around you and no one will ever find you  
For you thats ok cause tomorrows just another day  
  
Rock roll butter bread remember what yo mama said  
Hey its just yo life why dont you find the biggest knife  
You can find now baby yeah you acting like a lady  
You got blood on your pants and I know that you can dance  
  
Queen Cole Queen Cole got to take control  
You drinking whiskey and wine and it tastes just fine  
For you now Nicki life is getting tricky  
And youre running out of gas driving way too fast
