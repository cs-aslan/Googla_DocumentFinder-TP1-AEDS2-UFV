Her lips were waitin  
Her eyes looked sad  
The dreams of a lifetime  
A year gone bad  
The dreams of a lifetime  
Told me wrong  
Everything is all right  
And now its gone  
Dont blame me  
Please be strong I know Im not wrong  
Here comes the nightime  
Lookin for a little more  
Waitin on the right time  
Somebody outside the door  
Dont blame me  
Please be strong I know Im not wrong
