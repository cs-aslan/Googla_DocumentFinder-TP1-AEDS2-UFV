Traveled the world in million ways  
Catching the palm in familiar gaze  
Everyone lives by two hard eyes  
Theres no one with time to laugh or cry  
Theres no one to tell us what were living for  
  
And though I tried to be a good man  
I just know that Ill be losing very soon  
And there are times and there are motions  
When I do believe Im going out of tune oh  
  
Ive been around a long long while  
Looking for sun to make me smile  
But still multiply their daily bread  
Theyre thinking their lives put times ahead  
It must be a mighty funny way to feel  
  
And though I tried to be a good man  
I keep finding out theres nowhere to begin  
And so I think Ill go on singing  
And in time I hope that we can all join in oh
