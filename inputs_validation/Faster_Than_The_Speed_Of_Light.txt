Step inside the dream machine  
Youre on a power drive  
Feel the passion of the beast  
Watch her come alive  
  
Oh youre almost there ride on silver air  
You better hold on tight shes fire in the night  
  
Chorus  
Faster than the speed of light  
Hugging all the curves  
Hang on to your life  
Faster than the speed of light  
Supercharged and flying low  
Shes liquid dynamite  
  
Got your hands upon the wheel  
The pedal to the floor  
Now its time for nerves of steel  
Hear the engine roar  
  
Oh you shoot the thrill heading for the kill  
No control tonight shes liquid dynamite  
  
Repeat Chorus twice
