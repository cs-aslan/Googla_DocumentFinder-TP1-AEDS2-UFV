The worlds spinning round like a looney balloon  
Heading for a collision with Saturn and Mars  
And were narrowly missing the man in the moon  
Spinning out of control crashing into the stars  
  
Have we all lost our gravity reason and sanity  
Is this the price that we pay  
Have we now lost our way on this looney balloon  
Drift away just drift away  
  
Its so easy to just drift away  
Drift away just drift away  
Drifting away on this looney balloon  
The air is running out the computers gone down  
  
The mechanic just panicked hes nowhere to be found  
So automatic control is just spinning us round  
No point screaming in space you just cant hear a sound  
Now the pilots gone mad he just jumped overboard  
  
With a lunatic smile on his face  
And he laughed as he cut the umbilical chord  
Now hes drifting forever in space  
Drift away just drift away  
  
Its so easy to just drift away  
Drift away just drift away  
Drifting away on this looney balloon  
Were out of control on this looney balloon  
  
Narrowly missing the planets and stars  
Even optimists say that its all gloom and doom  
Weve got to get somewhere or hit something soon  
First class and economy we all played the game  
  
For selfish profit and gain  
So together well all go insane on this looney balloon  
Drift away hey just drift away  
Drifting away on this looney balloon  
  
Drift away hey just drift away  
Drifting away on this looney balloon  
Drift away hey  
Drift away Drift away
