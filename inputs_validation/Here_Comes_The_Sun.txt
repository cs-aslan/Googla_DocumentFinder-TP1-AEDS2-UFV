Little darling  
Its been a long long lonely winter  
Little darling  
It seems like years since its been here  
  
Here comes the sun  
Here comes the sun and I say  
Its all right  
  
Little darling  
The smiles are returning to their places  
Little darling  
It seems like years since theyve been there  
  
But here comes the sun  
Here comes the sun and I say  
Its all right  
  
Little darling  
I see the ice is slowly melting  
Little darling  
It seems like years since theyve been there  
  
And here comes the sun  
There goes the snow and I say  
Its all right  
Its all right  
  
I see the ice is slowly melting  
Little darling  
It seems like years since theyve been there  
  
Here comes the sun  
There goes the snow and I say  
Its all right  
Its all right  
  
Little darling  
The smiles are returning to their places  
Little darling  
It seems like years since theyve been there  
  
Here comes the sun  
I said here comes the sun and I say  
Its all right
