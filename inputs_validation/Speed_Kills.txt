Get on the ball boys Let catch that train and get on  
  
Well run your Chevy down the highway doing 95  
Got his V8 engine buzzing like a hive  
Gotta catch that mail train just to stay alive  
  
Well he wrote his baby a letter when he was in pain  
Well he told his little baby Dont want to see you again  
Well hes gotta drop that letter gotta catch that train  
  
Gotta beat it to the crossing before he gets to town  
Got to keep that whistle humming keep it to the ground  
Gotta catch that mail train gotta flag it down  
Roll on boy  
  
Well hes squealing around the bend tracks are getting near  
Well the roaring of the engine passing in his ear  
Well he aint gonna make it
