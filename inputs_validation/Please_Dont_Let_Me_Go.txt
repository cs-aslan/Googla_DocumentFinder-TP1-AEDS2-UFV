Where do I begin  
Should I tell you  
How bad I need you now yeah  
Youre underneath my skin  
But Im confused  
My head is spinning all around  
I waited so long  
I need to know darling  
What is on your mind  
  
Normally I try to run  
And I might even want to hide  
Cause I never knew what I wanted  
Till I looked into your eyes  
So am I in this alone  
What Im looking for is a sign  
That you feel how I feel for you  
Baby please dont let me go  
Baby please dont let me go  
Baby please dont let me go  
No please dont let me go  
Baby no no no no  
  
Badabadeebaba  
What else can I say Can I say  
My heart is beating double time yeah  
And do you feel the same Do you feel the same  
Dont leave me in the dark no  
But baby dont put out this spark no  
I waited so long  
I need to know darling  
What is on your mind  
  
Normally I try to run  
And I might even want to hide  
Cause I never knew what I wanted  
Till I looked into your eyes  
So am I in this alone  
What Im looking for is a sign  
That you feel how I feel for you  
Baby please dont let me go  
Baby please dont let me go  
Baby please dont let me go  
No please dont let me go  
Baby no no no no  
  
Caught in the inquisition  
Under these conditions  
I need a definition  
Is it love that were sharing  
Show me that youre caring  
You see my fascination  
Tell me Im not mistaken  
Give me the information I need  
One two three  
  
Normally I try to run  
And I might even want to hide  
Cause I never knew what I wanted  
Till I looked into your eyes  
So am I in this alone  
What Im looking for is a sign  
That you feel how I feel for you  
Baby please dont let me go Dont let me go  
Baby please dont let me go Please dont let me go  
Baby please dont let me go Dont let me go  
No please dont let me go  
Baby no no no no
