Listen to me and Ill sing you a song  
And the time will go by  
Till you never know where its gone  
Talk to me and Ill tell you my life story  
Walk with me and Ill tell you my dreams of glory  
There we are walking hand in hand  
Somewhere on the sand  
At the end of the land  
And the edge of the shining sea  
  
Drifting through time and space  
On the face of a little blue ball  
Falling around the sun  
One in a million billion twinkling lights  
Shining out for no one in the middle of the night  
Here we are sparks in the darkness  
Speaking of our love  
Burning down forever and forever  
  
Oh I dont know if I told you  
But you hold my heart in your hand  
And I found out something about you baby  
Without you  
Im a lonely man  
  
So though I never say that I love you  
I love you darling I do Carly I do love you  
And though we are as nothing  
To the stars that shine above  
You are my universe you are my love  
Here we are like children forever  
Taking care of one another  
While the world goes on without us  
All around us
