Theres closets in my head where dirty things are kept  
That never see the light of day  
I want to drag them out go for a walk  
Just to see the look thats on your face  
Sometimes I cant be straight I dont want to hurt you  
So forgive me if I tell a lie  
Sometimes I come on cold but dont believe it  
I will love you till the day I die  
  
I believe in doing things backwards  
Take heed start doing things in reverse  
  
Here comes trouble theres nothing wrong when I relax  
Im talking to myself youre coming with me  
Teaching you how to distort the facts  
Sometimes I cant be straight I dont want to hurt you  
So forgive me if I tell a lie  
Sometimes I come on cold but dont believe it  
I will love you till the day I die  
  
I believe in doing things backwards  
Take heed start doing things in reverse  
  
Frost on the window pane the sound of pouring rain  
All makes me glad of you  
Though I am far away I am always with you  
  
Know the answer before you know the question  
Pull yourself together baby push with all your might  
Im all alone always alone  
Though I am far away  
I am always with you
