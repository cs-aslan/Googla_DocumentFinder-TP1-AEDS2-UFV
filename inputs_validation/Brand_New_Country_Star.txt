Well he out grew his sequin suit  
Sold his Trailways bus  
Let his hair get a little too long  
Duck tails bit the dust  
His custom made pearl inlaid guitar  
slipped from his hands  
And in its place a new electrical one  
He had flown in from Japan  
  
Cause hes a cheeseburger eatin  
Abandoned Sunday meetin  
Brand new country star  
He rides around in a Lincoln Continental  
No steer horns on his car  
Oh the record man say hes the livin end  
Theyre gonna spin him right to the top  
Yea hes a hot roman candle from the Texas panhandle  
  
He can either go country or pop  
Got a good ole friend name of Texas Ben  
Tells him all the spots to play  
And a sweet little lady he calls her sexy Sadie  
Shes with the boy night and day  
Theyre gonna open up a chain of fancy bowling lanes  
The first one in his old home town  
And on ribbon cutting day theyll come from miles away  
The folks will all gather round
