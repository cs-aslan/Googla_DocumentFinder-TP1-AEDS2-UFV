Time it tells living in my home town  
Wedding bells they begin easy  
Live it down baby dont talk that much  
Baby knows but baby dont tease me  
In the park we could go walking  
Drowned in the dark or we could go sailing  
On the sea  
  
Always here always on time  
Close call was it love or was it just easy  
Money talks when people need shoes and socks  
Steady boys Im thinking she needs me  
  
I was just sipping on something sweet  
I dont need political process  
  
I got this feeling that theyre gonna break down the door  
I got this feeling they theyre gonna come back for more  
See I was thinking that I lost my mind  
But its been getting to me all this time  
And it dont stop dragging me down  
  
Silently reflection turns my world to stone  
Patiently correction leaves us all alone  
And sometimes Im a travel man  
But tonight this engines failing  
  
I still hear the children playing  
  
Kick the can kick the can skip and blackjack  
Steal a car and ring a roundrosy  
Rock and roll candyland bogeyman  
  
Run away and give me your sneakers  
  
Acid rain when Abel looked up at Cain  
We began the weeping and wailing  
A hurried high from pestilence pills and pride  
Its a shame we could have gone sailing  
But heaven knows  
Heaven knows everything  
Tranquilize  
  
I got this feeling that theyre gonna break down the door  
I got this feeling they theyre gonna come back for more  
See I was thinking that I lost my mind  
But its been getting to me all this time  
And it dont stop dragging me down  
  
Silently reflection turns my world to stone  
Patiently correction leaves us all alone  
And sometimes Im travel man  
But tonight this engines failing  
  
I still hear the children playing  
Dead beat dancers come to us and stay  
  
Cause I dont care where youve been  
And I dont care what youve seen  
Were the ones who still believe  
And were looking for a page  
In that lifeless book of hope  
Where a dream might help you cope  
With the Bushes and the bombs  
Uh huh Tranquilized
