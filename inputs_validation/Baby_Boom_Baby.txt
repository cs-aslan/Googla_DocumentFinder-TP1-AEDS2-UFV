Somehow the season always brings  
A picture of you baby boom baby  
Holding on for everything  
You figured youre due little turtleneck girl  
The moon on your shoulder  
The wind in your lovely hair oh what a night  
We sat on the beach and watched  
As the sun rose into the Summer air  
  
You said we couldnt miss what we never knew  
Something about something that you had to do  
Sitting on the sand with a hole in my shoe  
  
I had no way of knowing where  
You might have been time goes by  
All on my own I imagine you  
A life in between all own my own  
Wrote a long letter but it never made it  
Out of my head oh oh  
Somehow reading your name it wasnt the same  
As leaving the thing unsaid  
  
How come I miss what I never knew  
Drag out the past just to paint it blue  
And spend my days with a dream of you  
  
Oh after the fall here Im trying  
To find our name on the wall  
It was neither yours nor mine  
It was something of the two combined  
From a time spent out of time  
  
I work hard to see that you remember my name  
Nod your head yes  
Do all I can to make you want to see me again  
Oh what a night  
Got a letter from the mail  
Got a message from the telephone  
Seems youre working in town  
Moving around living alone  
  
Now Im caught in the spotlight  
Walking the wire  
My feet are frozen and my hearts on fire  
What do I do if my dream come true  
La la la la la la la la
