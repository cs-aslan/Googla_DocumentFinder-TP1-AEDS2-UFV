Cinderella stay awhile  
Youre the one  
Thats Im lookin for  
Cinderella bring your smile  
  
All around me sunbeams  
Start to fall  
Being my dear so near  
Please dont disappear  
Now that you are here  
Stay awhile  
  
Cinderella I just know  
That the magic slippers  
Going to fit  
Cinderella do not go  
  
Youre my princess  
I am sure of it  
This is love for sure  
Loving sweet and pure  
Love that will endure  
Stay awhile  
  
When you speak the angels all sing  
His is the kind og magic you bring  
  
Cinderella stay awhile  
This is like a fairytale with you  
Cinderella bring your smile  
  
All my fairy tales are coming true  
When my only fear  
Is being my dear so near  
Please dont disappear  
Stay awhile  
  
Fairytales makebelieve and you  
  
Cinderella stay awhile  
Dont you go
