Shared glasses and cigarettes  
Theres a lock up inside of me  
And I have so many regrets  
This isnt how things used to be  
And neevr satisfied  
Guess what I stop fucking tryin  
Guess up and guess you didnt know your  
  
But its always you  
Im always wrong anything like you  
And I always got awar with you  
And I lose yeah yeah  
Im a sell it dude gotta keep coming back to you  
Cause its feeling like dejavu  
My head spinnin around and got me sayin  
  
Chorus  
I I I  
Your way 2 complicated  
I I I I I cant no longer take it  
I I I I were no good let s just base it  
I I I I cause your way 2 complicated  
  
Here such a snobby girl  
  
Used to think you were a queen  
Damn shawty did rain on my parade  
Same old silly games you play  
This is such a waste of time  
Im starting to think that youre insane
