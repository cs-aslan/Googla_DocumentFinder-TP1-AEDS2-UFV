Dont give up  
Its just the weight of the world  
When your hearts heavy  
I I will lift it for you  
  
Dont give up  
Because you want to be heard  
If silence keeps you  
I I will break it for you  
Everybody wants to be understood  
  
Well I can hear you  
Everybody wants to be loved  
Dont give up  
Because you are loved  
Dont give up  
Its just the hurt that you hide  
  
When youre lost inside  
I Ill be there to find you  
Dont give up  
Because you want to burn bright  
If darkness blinds you  
I I will shine to guide you  
Everybody wants to be understood  
  
Well I can hear you  
Everybody wants to be loved  
Dont give up  
Because you are loved  
You are loved  
  
Ah  
Dont give up  
Its just the weight of the world  
Dont give up  
Everyone needs to be heard  
You are loved
