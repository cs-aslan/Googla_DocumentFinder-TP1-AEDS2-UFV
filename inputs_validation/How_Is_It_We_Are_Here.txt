How is it we are here on this path we walk  
In this world of pointless fear filled with empty talk  
Descending from the apes as scientistpriests all think  
Will they save us in the end were trembling on the brink  
  
Mens mighty minemachines digging in the ground  
Stealing rare minerals where they can be found  
Concrete caves with iron doors bury it again  
While a starving frightened world fills the sea with grain  
  
Her love is like a fire burning inside  
Her love is so much higher it cant be denied  
She sends us her glory its always been there  
Her loves all around us its there for you and me to share  
  
Mens mighty minemachines digging in the ground  
Stealing rare minerals where they can be found  
Concrete caves with iron doors bury it again  
While a starving frightened world fills the sea with grain  
  
How is it we are here  
How is it we are here  
How is it we are here
