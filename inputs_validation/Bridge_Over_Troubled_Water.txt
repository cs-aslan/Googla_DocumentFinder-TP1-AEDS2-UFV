When youre weary and feeling small  
When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all  
Im on your side when times get rough and friends just cant be found  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  
  
When youre down and out when youre on the street  
When evening falls so hard I will comfort you  
Ill take your part when darkness comes and pain is all around  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  
  
Sail on silver girl sail on by  
Your time has come to shine all your dreamsre on their way  
See how they shine if you need a friend Im sailing right behind  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind  
I will ease your mind
