Nobody on the road  
Nobody on the beach  
I feel it in the air  
The summers out of reach  
Empty lake empty streets  
The sun goes down alone  
Im drivin by your house  
Though I know youre not at home  
  
But I can see you  
Your brown skin shinin in the sun  
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on baby  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone  
  
I never will forget those nights  
I wonder if it was a dream  
Remember how you made me crazy  
Remember how I made you scream  
Now I dont understand what happened to our love  
But babe Im gonna get you back  
Im gonna show you what Im made of  
  
I can see you  
Your brown skin shinin in the sun  
I see you walkin real slow and youre smilin at everyone  
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone  
  
Out on the road today I saw a black flag sticker on a Cadillac  
A little voice Inside my head said Dont look back You cannever look back  
I thought I knew what love was  
What did I know  
Those days are gone forever  
I should just let them go but  
  
I can see you  
Your brown skin shinin in the sun  
You got that top pulled down and that radio on baby  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone  
  
I can see you  
Your brown skin shinin in the sun  
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on baby  
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone
