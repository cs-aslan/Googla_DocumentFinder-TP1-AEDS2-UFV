He rides on his horse and cart Charlie does  
Working from six until nine  
Collecting old rags and used bicycles  
Old iron of description of any kind  
  
Here comes Charlie Charlie the Ragman  
Throw out your old clothes for Charlie and Fred  
Earning a living off things weve discarded  
Earning enough for the board and the bed  
  
You hear him shout Rags and old iron  
Everyone knows him that way  
Once a week they come round calling  
How long its been I cant say  
  
Chorus  
They live all alone in a hovel  
He puts his money away  
Taking enough to just live on  
And at the end of the day  
Hes saving enough  
To put Fred out to graze  
  
Has anyone seen Charlie lately  
Charlie just aint been around  
Everyones seen Fred is grazing  
Chewing the grass from the ground Repeat  
  
Children say Charlie is happy  
Giving balloons to the angels instead  
Where is Charlie Charlie the Ragman  
Dont throw your clothes out
