Verse 1  
Ive seen the blood Ive seen the broken  
The lost and the sights unseen  
I want a flood I want an ocean  
To wash my confusion clean  
I cant resolve this empty story  
I cant repair the damage done  
  
Chorus  
We are the fortunate ones  
Whove never faced oppressions gun  
We are the fortunate ones  
Imitations of rebellion  
  
Verse 2  
We act it out we wear the colors  
Confined by the things we own  
Were not without were like each other  
Pretending were here alone  
And far away they burn their buildings  
Right in the face of the damage done  
  
Chorus  
We are the fortunate ones  
Whove never faced oppressions gun  
We are the fortunate ones  
Imitations of rebellion  
  
Bridge  
Rebellion rebellion  
We lost before the start  
Rebellion rebellion  
One by one we fall apart  
We fall apart We fall apart We fall apart  
  
Chorus  
We are the fortunate ones  
Whove never faced oppressions gun  
We are the fortunate ones  
Imitations of Imitations of  
We are the fortunate ones  
Whove never faced oppressions gun  
We are the fortunate ones  
Imitations of rebellion  
Rebellion rebellion rebellion
