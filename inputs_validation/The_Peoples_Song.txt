My hands are tied behing my back my face is red with hate  
I know Ive tried to be the better man but I cant accept this fate  
  
Its seems every time I cross the line and wonder that  
Am supposed to figure which way you want to go  
And I can see that misery is plaguing you  
And Im supposed to be there when you have no one  
  
Take my hand ill take from where you stand  
My mind is made up and I cant take the people falling  
Down on me but thats the way its gotta be  
our 2 worlds cant coexist  
I cant promote a lie that I wanna watch you crying
