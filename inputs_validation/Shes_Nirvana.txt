Do you dare to taste her soul  
Do you like to trick control  
Did you think this world was real  
Realize this was the deal  
shes ether fire  burns away all the dire  
You will feel her touch for a while  
do you see her through the waves  
Do you think its her who saves  
With a blink of radiant eye  
Would you really dare to try  
shes like a fawn  just appears and then gone  
What remains will be just this one song  
shes eternity behind her disguise  
You have almost seen a world in her eyes  
But youve known that it would never be born  
Shes flown away like a leave in a storm  
shes bliss  shes ether  shes dark  shes nirvana
