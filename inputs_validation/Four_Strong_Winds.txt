Think Ill go out to Alberta  
Weathers good there in the fall  
I got some friends that I could go to working for  
Still I wish youd change your mind  
If I ask you one more time  
But weve been through this a hundred times or more  
  
chorus Four strong winds that blow lonely  
Seven seas that run high  
All those things that dont change Come what may  
If all the good times are all gone  
Then Im bound for movin on  
Ill look for you if Im ever back this way  
  
If I get there before the snow flies  
And if things are lookin good  
You could meet me if I send you down the fare  
But by then it would be winter  
Not too much for you to do  
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there
