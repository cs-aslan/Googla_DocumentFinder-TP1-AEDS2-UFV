Fly like an eagle  
An outlaw of the sun  
Stealing round your bedroom door  
A case of hit n run  
Sinner sinner  
Im no angel you can see  
  
So I will tell you now  
And I wont say it again  
Dont mess with me  
Oh baby dont mess with me  
  
Ride like a demon  
The devils only son  
A whiskey drinking son of a bitch  
Ive only just begun  
Sinner sinner  
Im no angel you can see  
  
I told you once before  
And I wont say it again  
Dont mess with me  
Dont mess with me  
  
Soothe me baby like I soothe you  
Treat me baby like I treat you  
Soothe me baby like I soothe you  
Treat me baby like I  
  
Fly like an eagle  
An outlaw of the sun  
Never take what sleeps around  
But always get your fun  
Sinner sinner  
Youre no angel I can see  
  
I told you once before  
And I wont say it again  
Dont mess with me  
Dont mess with me  
cause Im a sinner  
  
And sinners aint the loving kind
