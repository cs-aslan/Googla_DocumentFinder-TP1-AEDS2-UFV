Feat The Buddy Cole Trio  
  
In a little Spanish town  
Twas on a night like this  
Stars were peekabooing down  
Twas on a night like this  
  
I whispered be true to me  
And she sighed si si  
  
Many skies have turned to gray  
Because were far apart  
Many moons have passed away  
And still shes in my heart  
  
We made a promise  
And we sealed it with a kiss  
In a little Spanish town  
Twas on a night like this  
  
Many skies have turned to gray  
Because were far apart  
Many moons have passed away  
And still shes in my heart  
  
We made a promise  
And we sealed it with a kiss  
In a little Spanish town  
Twas on a night like this
