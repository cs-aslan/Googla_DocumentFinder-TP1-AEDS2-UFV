I never been too good at doing right  
Done mostly wrong most all my life  
I never found a place to settle down  
Baby I do believe I found it now  
  
Im gonna walk that line  gonna tote that barge  
Gonna lift that bale  gonna work real hard  
Doin anything that you want me to  
Baby Im gonna walk that line for you  
  
Ooh Im gonna walk that line for you  
Ooh Im gonna walk that line for you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Ooh Im gonna walk that line for you  
  
Well straight and narrow if ever was my past  
Everlasting love never seem to last  
I used to be a Tomcat out on the prowl  
But baby Im just your puppy dog now  
  
Im gonna walk that line  gonna tote that barge  
Gonna lift that bale  gonna work real hard  
Doin anything that you want me to  
Baby Im gonna walk that line for you
