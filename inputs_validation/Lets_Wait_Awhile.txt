Theres something I want to tell you  
Theres something I think that you should know  
Its not that I shouldnt really love you  
Lets take it slow  
When we get to know each other  
And were both feeling much stronger  
Then lets try to talk it over  
Lets wait awhile longer  
  
Lets wait awhile  
Before its too late  
Lets wait awhile  
Before we go too far  
  
Remember that special night  
When all of the stars were shining bright  
  
But on that very first night  
It wasnt quite right  
  
Lets wait awhile  
  
Before its too late  
  
Lets wait awhile  
  
Our love will be great  
  
Lets wait awhile  
Before we go too far  
  
I didnt never give up on you Lets wait awhile  
Awhile before its too late  
  
You know you cant rush love  
  
Ooh hoo hoo  
Lets wait awhile  
Ooh hoo hoo  
Before its too late  
Lets wait awhile  
Wait awhile  
Our love will be great  
Lets wait awhile  
Wait awhile ooh  
Before we go too far oh oh ooh  
  
La da lee de da da de de de da da da da la da  
La da lee de da da de de de da da da da la da da  
La da lee de da da de de de  
Before we go too far
