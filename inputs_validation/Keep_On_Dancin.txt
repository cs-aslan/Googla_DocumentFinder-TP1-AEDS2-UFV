Verse 1  
People like to talk because they dont know what to say  
Running from the truth because the truths too much to take  
I keep raising glasses cause I only got today  
I just keep moving I just keep moving  
  
Chorus  
You can hurt me Ill find another  
You can love me youll be my lover  
Happy in rain or thunder  
Baby I keep  
I keep on I keep on I just keep on dancing  
I just keep on dancing  
I just keep on dancing  
  
Verse 2  
Can you see my see my headlights  
You can come ride shotgun with me  
Whatever you like ever you like  
Every time I look at those stars  
Know they aint got the answers for me  
But Ill be alright Ill be alright  
  
Chorus  
You can hurt me Ill find another  
You can love me youll be my lover  
Happy in rain or thunder  
Baby I keep  
I keep on I keep on I just keep on dancing  
I just keep on dancing  
I just keep on dancing  
You can hurt me Ill find another  
You can love me youll be my lover  
I just keep on dancing
