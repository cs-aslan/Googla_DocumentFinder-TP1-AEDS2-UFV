You say that all you want are the simple things  
Long walks on lonely beaches guitars with nylon strings  
But underneath youd rather leap through a hoop of fire  
You shy away from lips that want that want to kiss you  
Tonguetied on formal evenings wealth dont impress you  
But if you ask me you like the heat in a hoop of fire  
And its hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire  
Your pulse that races when Im close reads like a hoop of fire  
Your pulse that races when Im close reads like a hoop of fire  
No late nights making love in secret places  
You feel pressure all around you mistrust in strangers faces  
But dont pretend you wouldnt spend some time in a hoop of fire  
And its hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire  
Your pulse that races when Im close reads like a hoop of fire  
Your pulse that races when Im close reads like a hoop of fire  
But dont pretend you wouldnt spend some time in a hoop of fire  
And its hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire  
Your pulse that races when Im close reads like a hoop of fire  
Your pulse that races when Im close reads like a hoop of fire  
Your pulse that races when Im close reads like a hoop of fire
