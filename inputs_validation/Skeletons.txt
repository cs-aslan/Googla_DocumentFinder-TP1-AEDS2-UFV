Skeletons in your closet  
Itchin to come outside  
Messin with your conscience  
In a way your face cant hide  
  
Oh things are gettin real funky  
Down at the old corral  
And its not the skunks that are stinkin  
Its the stinkin lies you tell  
  
What did your mama tell you about lies  
She said it wasnt polite to tell a white one  
What did your daddy tell you about lies  
He said one white one turns into a black one  
  
So its gettin ready to blow  
Its gettin ready to show  
Somebody shot off at the mouth and  
Were gettin ready to know  
  
Its gettin ready to drop  
Its gettin ready to shock  
Somebody done turned up the heater  
Ana its gettin ready to pop  
  
Crevices in your pantry  
Now what do we have in here  
Havin a daytime nightmare  
Has always been your biggest fear  
  
Oh things are gettin real crucial  
Up the old wazoo  
Yet you cry why am I the victim  
When the culprits whyoyou  
  
What did your mama tell you about lies  
She said it wasnt polite to tell a white one  
What did your daddy tell you about lies  
He said one white one turns into a black one  
  
So its gettin ready to blow  
Its gettin ready to show  
Somebody shot off at the mouth and  
Were gettin ready to know  
  
Its gettin ready to drop  
Its gettin ready to shock  
Somebody done turned up the heater  
Ana its gettin ready to pop  
  
Its gettin ready to seep  
Youre gettin ready to freak  
Somebody done picked up the talk box  
Were gettin ready to speak  
  
Its gettin ready to jive  
Youre gettin ready to gel  
Somebody done gone let the lid off  
Were gettin ready to smell  
  
Theyre gettin ready to deal  
Youre gettin ready to ill  
Somebody done just dropped the big dime  
And theyre gettin ready to squeal  
  
Its gettin ready to turn  
Were gettin ready to learn  
Somebody done fired up the brimstone  
And youre gettin ready to burn  
  
Its gettin ready to shake  
Youre gettin ready to ache  
Somebody done snitched to the news crew  
And its gettin ready to break  
  
Youre gettin ready to lie  
Theyre gettin ready to spy  
Somebodys been put on the hot seat  
And youre gettin ready to fry
