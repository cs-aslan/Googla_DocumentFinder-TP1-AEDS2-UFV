You stand in front of the band  
With all those scarves in your hands  
I see you play imaginary guitars  
You people shaking your heads  
Right till the end of the set  
You really turn me on wherever we are  
  
Cant live cant live without you  
Cant live cant live without you  
Cant live cant live without you  
Cant live cant live without you  
  
Put your hands in the air  
So I can see you are there  
I want to see all your lights shining on  
Want you to stand up and dance  
Gonna leave you no chance  
To take a breath between each single song  
  
Cant live cant live without you  
Cant live cant live without you  
Cant live cant live without you  
Cant live cant live without you  
  
Stand up and shout  
Were ready to rock were ready to roll  
Stand up and shout  
Are you ready are you ready  
Come on and get it  
  
Cant live cant live without you  
Cant live cant live without you  
Cant live cant live without you  
Cant live cant live without you
