Do you know whats worth fighting for  
When its not worth dying for  
Does it take your breath away  
And you feel yourself suffocating  
Does the pain weigh out the pride  
And you look for a place to hide  
Did someone break your heart inside  
Youre in ruins  
  
One twenty one guns  
Lay down your arms  
Give up the fight  
One twenty one guns  
Throw up your arms into the sky  
You and I  
  
When youre at the end of the road  
And you lost all sense of control  
And your thoughts have taken their toll  
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul  
Your faith walks on broken glass  
And the hangover doesnt pass  
Nothings ever built to last  
Youre in ruins  
  
One twenty one guns  
Lay down your arms  
Give up the fight  
One twenty one guns  
Throw up your arms into the sky  
You and I  
  
Did you try to live on your own  
When you burned down the house and home  
Did you stand too close to the fire  
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone  
  
When its time to live and let die  
And you cant get another try  
Something inside this heart has died  
Youre in ruins  
  
One twenty one guns  
Lay down your arms  
Give up the fight  
One twenty one guns  
Throw up your arms into the sky  
  
One twenty one guns  
Lay down your arms  
Give up the fight  
One twenty one guns  
Throw up your arms into the sky  
You and I
