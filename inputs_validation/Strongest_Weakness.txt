I smoked my last cigarette  
Threw that nasty habit away  
Laid down my last dollar on my last bet  
Didnt ever win anyway  
  
Gave up the wine and whiskey  
Cause everybody said I should  
But Im givin up on quittin you baby  
Cause it feels so damn good  
  
You are my strongest weakness  
Cant get enough cant give you up  
You are my deepest secret  
I know its wrong but I cant go on  
  
And I try try try  
I ask myself why why why  
My strongest weakness  
  
You been runnin around for a long time now  
I know all the games you play  
Sooner or later you will put me down  
Gonna have to face it someday  
  
But baby every time you hold me  
And I get another taste of your kiss  
I feel a power comin over me  
That my body just cant miss  
  
You are my strongest weakness  
Cant get enough cant give you up  
You are my deepest secret  
I know its wrong but I cant go on  
  
I try try try  
I ask myself why why why  
My strongest weakness  
  
Why cant you just say no  
Strongest weakness  
I said why cant I let you go  
Strongest weakness  
  
Why why do I keep keep breakin down  
Strongest weakness  
I said why cant I turn around  
Strongest weakness  
  
You know I try try try  
I ask myself why why why  
I give in to you baby  
You are my strongest weakness  
  
Strongest weakness  
Cant get enough cant give you up  
Deepest secret  
Deepest secret  
  
Strongest weakness  
Strongest weakness  
Deepest secret  
You are you are  
Strongest weakness
