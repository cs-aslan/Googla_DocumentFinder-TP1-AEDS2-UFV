I have seen the rain  
I have felt the pain  
I dont know where Ill be tomorrow  
I dont know where Im going  
I dont even know where Ive been  
But I know Id like to see them again  
  
Spend my days just searching  
Spend my nights in dreams  
Stop looking over my shoulder baby  
I stopped wondering what it means  
Drop out burn out sold your home  
Oh they said I shouldve been more  
Probably so if I hadnt been in that crazy damn Vietnam war  
  
I have seen the rain  
I survived the pain  
Oh Ive been home 30 years or so  
And Im just stepping off of the plane  
  
Spend my days in searching  
Spend my nights in dreams  
Stop looking over my shoulder baby  
I stopped wondering what it means  
Drop out burn out sold your home  
Oh they said I shouldve been more  
Probably so if I hadnt been in that crazy damn Vietnam war  
  
We have seen the rain together  
We survived the pain forever  
Oh its good to be home again  
Its good to be with my friends  
Oh its good to be home again  
Its good to feel the rain
