Theres no end theres no beginning  
To the old mans story  
Does he still remember me  
From lives gone by  
Oh I see his spirit rising  
Upon the back of time  
Ive got nowhere to hide  
Will he keep a place for me  
  
He is the king of all kings  
The keeper of light  
He holds eternitys wings  
  
In his eyes an oceans burning  
Swollen seas of tears  
Troubled mind the beating  
War drums in his ears  
No one ever hears his warning  
Am I the one he calls  
When they tell me theyre afraid  
Some say Ill be put away  
  
He is the king of all kings  
The keeper of light  
He holds eternitys wings  
My blood will spill my blood  
  
My blood will spill my blood  
  
In the wisdom of the prophets  
Never ending tale  
Open up the eyes  
Within your mind he says  
Crowned in his ancient glory  
Theres a king within us all  
Some will say its all in vain  
That he doesnt have a name  
  
He is the king of all kings  
The keeper of light  
He holds eternitys wings
