You came to me  
You said you were my friend  
I shared my art and my mind  
You found it easier  
To steal than create  
Then call it yours though its mine  
  
You cant fight what is right  
Face the truth liar  
You cant feel you just steal  
Face the truth liar  
  
You smile in my face  
When I turn around  
You stick a knife in my back  
You think youre clever  
You know youre insane  
Youre lies are not white they are black  
  
You cant fight what is right  
Face the truth liar  
You cant feel you just steal  
Face the truth liar
