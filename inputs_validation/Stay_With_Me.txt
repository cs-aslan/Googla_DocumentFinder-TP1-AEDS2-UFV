Where did you go  
When things went wrong baby  
And who did you run to  
To find a shoulder  
To lay your head upon  
Baby wasnt I there  
Didnt I take good care of you  
  
Oh no I cant believe you leaving me  
  
Stay with me baby  
Stay with me baby  
Wont you stay with me baby  
I cant go on  
  
Who did you touch  
When you need tenderness  
I gave so much  
And in return I found happiness  
Baby what did I do  
Maybe I was too good too good for you  
  
No no I cant believe you leaving me  
  
Stay with me baby  
Stay with me baby  
Wont you stay with me baby  
I cant go on  
  
Remember  
You said youre always gonna need me  
Remember  
You said youd never ever leave me  
Remember remember Im asking you begging you  
  
Stay with me baby  
Stay with me baby  
Wont you stay with me baby  
I cant go on cant go on  
  
Stay with me baby  
Stay with me stay with me baby  
Wont you stay with me baby  
I cant go on
