And its all in how you mix the two  
And it starts just where the light exists  
Its a feeling that you cannot miss  
And it burns a hole  
Through everyone that feels it  
  
Well your never gonna find it  
If your looking for it  
Wont come your way  
Well youll never find it  
If your looking for it  
  
Shouldve done something but Ive done it enough  
By the way your hands were shaking  
Rather waste some time with you  
  
And you never would have though in the end  
How amazing it feels just to live again  
Its a feeling that you cannot miss  
It burns a hole through everyone that feels it  
  
Shouldve said something but Ive said it enough  
By the way my words were faded  
Rather waste some time with you
