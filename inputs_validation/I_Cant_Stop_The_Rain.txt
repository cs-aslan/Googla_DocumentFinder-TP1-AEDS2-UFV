This is New York yo  
Its getting dark  
  
Night falls on the city  
Finds me all alone  
Makes me wonder  
Should I just go on home  
  
And I walk up the stairs  
To see if youre sill there  
Would you mind if  
I found you alone  
  
Then a cold wind came callin  
Strange how it knew itd bother me  
See the night would fade  
But the pains gonna stay  
Makes me wonder  
Have you ever made love to me  
  
I cant stop the rain here it comes again  
Lightnin strikes across the sky  
Oh I cant stop the rain here it comes again  
Lightnin only blinds my eyes  
  
Aint it sad  
When the only love I ever had  
Just slips away  
Right through my fingers  
  
Aint it a shame when I think of your name  
The only memory I have is it  
  
I cant stop the rain here it comes again  
Lightnin strikes across the sky  
Oh I cant stop the rain here it comes again  
It takes a witch to curse that goddamn sky  
  
I cant stop the rain here it comes again  
Lightnin strikes across the sky  
Oh I cant stop the rain here it comes again  
Cause lightnin only blinds my eyes  
  
Oh I cant stop the rain here it comes again  
Cause lightnin only blinds my eyes  
  
Cant stop it blinds my eyes
