They call to her from across the street  
But they dont know her name  
Shes in the wrong place at the wrong time  
Whos to blame  
  
She wonders how to change  
the life shes living  
She wonders if shell ever get away  
As far as I can see the writings on the wall  
  
Theres no return we live we learn  
The game goes on and on and  
Que sera  
I like you but I dont  
  
Really want to take you home  
Que sera  
Its a lonely life  
Living on my own  
  
Que sera  
Whats it gonna be whats it gonna be  
She left her home when she was seventeen  
Simply disappeared in the rain  
  
Those were bad times so it was high time  
She knows shed do it again  
She wonders how  
shes gonna make a living  
  
She wonders if shell make it through the day  
As far as I can see Ive seen it all before  
A lonely girl in a big bad world  
The game goes on and on and  
  
Que sera
