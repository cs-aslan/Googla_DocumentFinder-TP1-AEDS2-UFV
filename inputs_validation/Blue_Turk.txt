Im lazy you know it  
Im ready for the second show  
Amazin thing growing  
Just waitin for the juice to flow  
  
But youre so very picturesque  
Youre so very cold  
Tastes like roses on your breath  
But graveyards on your soul  
  
Im hurting Im wanting  
Im aching for another go  
Youre squirming wet baby  
Nothin bad comin very slow  
And its burnin holes in me  
  
Youre so very picturesque  
Youre so very cold  
It tastes like roses on your breath  
But graveyards on your soul whoaoh  
  
One spastic explosion  
Two pressurecookers go insane  
It makes me act crazy  
I shiver but I love this game  
  
Youre so very ordinary  
Youre so very lame  
Tastes like whiskey on your lips  
And earthworms rule your brain
