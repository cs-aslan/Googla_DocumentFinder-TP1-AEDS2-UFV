Well its getting late have you seen my mates  
Tell me when the boys get here  
Its seven oclock and I got to rock  
Got to get a belly full of beer  
  
Well my old mans drunker than a barrel full of monkeys  
And my old lady she dont care  
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots  
A handful of grease in her hair  
  
Oh dont give us none of your aggravation  
We had it with your discipline  
Saturday nights alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this dance alight  
Saturday nights the night I like  
Saturday nights alright alright alright  
  
Well theyre packed pretty tight inside here tonight  
Im looking for a dolly to see me right  
I can use a little muscle to get what I need  
And have a little drink and shout out Shes with me  
  
A couple of the sound that I really like  
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike  
Im a juvenile product of the working class  
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass  
  
Oh dont give us none of your aggravation  
We had it with your discipline  
Saturday nights alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this dance alight  
Saturday nights the night I like  
Saturday nights alright alright alright  
  
Oh dont give us none of your aggravation  
We had it with your discipline  
Saturday nights alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this dance alight  
Saturday nights the night I like  
Saturday nights alright alright alright  
  
Saturday Saturday Saturday  
Saturday Saturday Saturday  
Saturday Saturday Saturday  
Nights alright  
  
Saturday Saturday Saturday  
Saturday Saturday Saturday  
Saturday Saturday Saturday  
Nights alright  
  
Saturday Saturday Saturday  
Saturday Saturday Saturday  
Saturday Saturday Saturday  
Nights alright
