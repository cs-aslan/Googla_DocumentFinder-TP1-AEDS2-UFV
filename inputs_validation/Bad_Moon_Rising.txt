I see a bad moon rising  
I see trouble on the way  
I see earthquakes and lightnin  
I see bad times today  
  
Dont go round tonight  
Its bound to take your life  
Theres a bad moon on the rise  
  
I hear hurricanes a blowin  
I know the end is commin soon  
I fear rivers over flowing  
I hear the voice of rage and ruin  
  
Hope you got your things together  
Hope you are quite prepared to die  
Looks like weer in for nasty weather  
One eye is taken for an eye
