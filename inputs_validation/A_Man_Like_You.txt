A man like you a man like you  
Could be my new beginning  
And get me on the winning side of life  
If I had you a man like you  
All the fairy tales I dreamed about  
Just a breath ago would all come true  
  
If I had you baby  
If I had a man like you  
  
A man like you baby just like you  
Id share all of the precious things  
That Ive been saving deep within my soul  
Well a man like you and baby  
A little ol sweet girl like me  
The two of us together  
Ride the waves forever and well be home free  
  
Well dont you feel it yeah  
I need a man like you  
And all I want is to know  
I need you by my side yeah  
And I want to protect you baby  
From all things in life  
Well I do yeah  
  
Oh what I wouldnt do for a man like you  
A man like you a man like you
