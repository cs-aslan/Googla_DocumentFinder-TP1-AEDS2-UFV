Hello tomorrow and goodbye to yesterday  
Weve been waiting for this moment  
And we still dont know what to say  
We may never find the answers  
or know the reason why  
Why we both decided we should say goodbye  
  
Nothing but good things are coming my way  
If you are going please let me stay  
You bring me down when Im getting high  
You turn me on I amplify  
  
123 times youve broken me Broken Me  
123 123  
  
I wont bleed like this forever  
Im down to ride but my wings are severed  
Blindside blitz evacuation  
Im stuck in hell your on vacation  
  
123 times youve broken me Broken Me  
123 123  
  
Chorus  
Ive been waiting  
Waiting for the day  
Ive been waiting  
Waiting for the day  
Im still waiting for tomorrow  
Tired of living in yesterday  
Ive been waiting  
Waiting for the day Id be over you  
  
Oceans devotions these notions run dry  
Floating away and I dont know why  
Spend all my days in a bottle thinking  
Youre like an anchor got me sinking  
  
123 times youve broken me Broken Me  
123 123  
  
Say goodbye now and mean it forever  
Got to move on and keep it together  
Forget the things that youve said and youve done  
Thats in the past here comes the sun  
  
123 times youve broken me Broken Me  
  
Chorus  
  
Hello tomorrow and goodbye to yesterday  
Weve been waiting for this moment  
And we still dont know what to say  
We may never find the answers  
or know the reason why  
Why we both decided we should say goodbye  
  
Chorus  
  
Hello tomorrow  
123  
Id be over you hello tomorrow  
123  
Id be over you
