And I wrote my happiest songs  
Every child may joy to you  
Whats wrong  
Nothing but the real  
It is you that needed something stronger  
  
I need something stronger  
  
If you have a problem dont hesitate to ask for assistance  
  
Whats wrong  
  
Whats wrong  
Nothing  
  
Whats wrong  
  
Whats wrong  
  
Whats wrong  
Wha wha wha wha wha  
  
Can you feel this  
What is that buzzing  
Are you now or have you ever moved slowly  
  
I need something stronger  
  
  
  
  
Whats wrong  
Whats wrong  
  
Whats wrong  
Its just a matter by you looking it thats all
