When the lights are low you know Im going to go  
To my hotel chambermaid  
Im going to jump the garden and come on hard all night  
While the rivers rolling outside the window  
Going to see her going to get love  
Going to shut the bellboy out tonight  
  
When the world is dead Im going to make the bed  
With my hotel chambermaid  
Shell bring the coffee in the morning with a smile  
She dont ask where I come from  
I crept in and I soon will be done  
Going to shut the bellboy out tonight  
  
I aint got a million dollars  
No one I can call mine  
But Ill push on cushion me some way  
Aint got no future at least thats what they say  
This girl is going to take those kind of blues away  
Hotel chambermaid  
Hotel chambermaid  
  
Room service can you help me  
I want a hotel chambermaid  
I didnt pay my bill but then I had my fill all night  
While the rivers rolling outside the window  
Going to see her going to get love  
Going to shut the bellboy out tonight  
  
While the rivers rolling outside the window  
Going to see her going to get love  
Going to shut the bellboy out tonight
