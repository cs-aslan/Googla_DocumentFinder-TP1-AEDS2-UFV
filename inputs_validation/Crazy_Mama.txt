Well youre crazy Mama  
With your ball and chain  
And your sawn off shotgun  
Blown out brains yeah  
  
You can scandalize me  
Scorn my name  
You can steal my money  
And that dont mean a doggone thing  
  
Cause if you really think you can push it  
Im going to bust your knees with a bullet  
Your crazy mama ah yeah  
  
Well your old time religion  
Is just a superstition  
You going to pay high prices  
For your sacrificises  
  
Well your blood and thunder  
Sure cant faze me none  
If your going to keep on coming  
Im gonna take it all head on  
  
If you dont believe Im going to do it  
Just wait till you get hit by that bullet  
  
Dont think I aint thought about it  
But it sure makes my shackles rise  
And cold blood murder  
Make me want to draw the line  
  
Well your crazy mama  
With your ball and chain  
Plain psychotic  
Plain insane  
  
If you dont think Im gonna do it  
Just wait for the thud of the bullet
