Sympathy just doesnt mean  
That much to me  
Compassions not  
The fashion in my mind  
And if youre looking for  
A shoulder to cry on  
Dont turn your head my way  
Cause Id rather have  
My music any day  
  
You and I are  
Masters of our destiny  
We look for consolation all the time  
Until we find out things are not  
What they were meant to be oh no  
And if it doesnt suit our mood  
Well call it crime  
  
Dedications not an obligation  
Or a figment of  
Someones imagination  
Its the only way they say  
To live from day to day  
To make each passing way  
A small sensation  
  
Dreams are the possession of  
The simple man  
Reality the fantasy of youth  
But living is a problem that  
Is common to us all  
With love the only  
Common road to truth
