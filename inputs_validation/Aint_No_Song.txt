There aint no melody and I cant find a harmony  
If there were a way to say it you know I would have played it  
Well Im a man of few words trying to find a rhyme  
And finally it occurred to me that Im wasting my time  
  
There aint no rhyme or reason aint no time or season  
Aint no way around it I know I would have found it  
There aint no song in the whole wide world could hardly sing without you  
There aint no song in the whole wide world to tell you the way that I feel  
  
Painters use their eyes to show us what they see  
But when that canvas dries we all see it differently  
There aint black or white there aint no day or night  
There aint no way around it you know I would have found it  
  
There aint no song in the whole wide world could hardly sing without you  
There aint no song in the whole wide world to tell you the way that I feel  
No no no I might as well pack it on up  
Not even this songs gonna tell you the way that I feel
