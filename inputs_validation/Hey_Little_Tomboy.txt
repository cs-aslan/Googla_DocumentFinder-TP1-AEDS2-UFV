Hey little tomboy sit here on my lap  
I got things that I gotta tell you  
No more skateboards put away your baseball mitt  
Your rough livin days are through  
You could find places to go  
You could see that boys love you so  
Theyre doin it all over the world  
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy  
Time to turn into a girl  
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy  
Theyre doin it all over the world  
Hey little tomboy Ive had my eyes on you  
Thinkin what a girl you could be  
Mmm I smell perfume lets try some cutoff jeans  
Look at all the changes I see  
Im gonna teach you to kiss  
Youre gonna feel just like this  
Theyre doin it all over the world  
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy  
Time to turn into a girl  
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy  
Theyre doin it all over the world  
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy  
Im gonna make you a girl  
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy  
Youd make a beautiful girl  
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy  
Theyre doing it all over the world
