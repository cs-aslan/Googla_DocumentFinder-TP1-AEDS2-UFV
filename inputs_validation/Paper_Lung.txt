Its too late its too late now  
To pry away to pry away  
  
The candle burns on both ends  
So where does it leave us  
Standing emptier than we ever left you  
With your head in the water its getting harder to breathe  
So stand up stand up  
  
Its too late to pry away  
  
Dont get me wrong  
Im just as scared as you are now  
They dropped us off here with no direction  
But you never even tried to fight the current  
Watch the water pouring faster into your lungs  
So breathe in breathe in  
  
Its too late to pry away  
  
But its hard to hear me when youre sinking  
  
Swim here I wanna see you  
Wash it down wash it down  
  
How can you sleep here Ive been  
I dont believe it a single word you sold to me  
  
Youre burning for the last time  
I swear Im done with all your fears  
  
Its too late to pry you away from the undertow  
I watch it take you then I walk away
