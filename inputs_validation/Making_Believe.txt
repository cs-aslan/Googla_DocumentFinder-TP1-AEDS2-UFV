Making believe that you still love me  
Its leaving me alone and so blue  
Still Ill always dream but Ill never own you  
Making believe its all I can do  
  
Cant hold you close when youre not whit me  
Youre somebodys love youll never be mine  
Making believe Ill spend my lifetime  
Loving you and making believe  
  
Making believe I never lost you  
But my happy hours are so few  
My plans for the future will never come true  
Making believe what else can I do
