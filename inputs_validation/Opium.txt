Why  
I wonder why you sigh  
Theres no reason  
Theres no reason for you to cry  
Dont  
Dont believe your own lies  
Theres no reason  
Theres no reason for you to sigh  
  
Music  
Music is opium for free  
Try a little try to consume me  
Music is Prozac for free  
Dont get stuck in greed  
  
Why  
Why dont you dare to speak  
Silence  
Silence will tighten our leash  
Happy  
Happiness is not for lease  
Silence  
Silence will tighten our leash  
  
Music  
Music is opium for free  
Try a little try to consume me  
Music is Prozac for free  
Dont get stuck in greed  
  
Music  
Silence  
Happy  
Theres no reason  
  
Music  
Silence  
Happy  
Theres no reason
