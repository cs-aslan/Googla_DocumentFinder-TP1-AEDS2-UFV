Ive read the bible Ive read Dylan  
Im reading people now  
Because it is much more chilling  
I sit on a satellite  
With the stars made of gold  
Theres life through that hollow lens  
I know supersatellite  
I watch the traffic  
I find the seeds  
Theres one man in particular  
Whos not what he seems  
I cant focus in  
On the lies in his head  
Hes convinced that his blood is blue  
But its red  
Supersatellite  
Nothing dazzles me  
I am in his dreams  
Nothing is shocking  
Transparent human being  
On the soul inside the world  
Far better than the eye inside the mind  
Fuck you I am you you hear me  
Stop crying stop crying
