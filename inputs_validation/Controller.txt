Theres someone knockin on my door  
Theres someone knockin on my door  
I think theyre looking for me  
I think theyre looking for me  
Pretend there aint nobody home  
Dont make a sound dont even move  
Dont give them nothing to see  
I think theyre looking for me  
I got to run  
I got to run  
I got to run  
I got to run  
I got to run  
Theres someone crawling in my yard  
Theres someone creeping on my roof  
Theres someone tapping my phone  
I feel it deep in my bones  
They want to probe my intuition  
They want to find out what I know  
Why dont they leave me alone  
Why dont they leave me alone  
I got to run  
I got to run  
I got to run  
Might be the catcher  
Or the controller  
Cant be too careful  
I take precautions  
Theyre very clever  
I got to run  
Faceless surgeons armed with razors  
Cut out our imagination  
Repeat first verse  
repeat chorus  
Faceless surgeons armed with razors  
Cut out our imagination  
Its a strange thing  
Deadly reason  
Razors cut with such precision  
Probing deep without detection  
Razors never lie  
But its all right  
I think theyre looking for me  
I think theyre looking for me  
I think theyre looking for me  
I think theyre looking for meeeeeeeeeee
