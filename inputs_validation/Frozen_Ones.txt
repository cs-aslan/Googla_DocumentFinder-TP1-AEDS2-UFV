Marching across our own screens  
Our faces form all our needs  
The futures not returning  
All bridges built for burning  
How can there be anything wrong  
Arent we the frozen ones  
One day Ill just erase the tape wave goodbye and fade away  
Get lost in the frost again  
Clean the ashes of my face at the bottom of your suitcase  
Find a sunset turn away  
How can there by anything wrong  
Arent we the frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
We walk around inside each other visiting the empty rooms  
Put me on Ill put you on too  
You knew Id have to follow you because you saw Im hollow too  
But its so nice being I too  
How can there by anything wrong  
Arent we the frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
Chorus  
Were nowhere  
We dont care who led us here  
Noone will care when were gone  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
Too many pictures on my screen and all of them are screaming at me  
Thought I had this insulation  
The only way to stop the flood whenever feelings get too real  
Is to cut the information  
How can there be anything wrong  
Arent we the frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
Chorus  
The frozen ones  
Repeat and fade
