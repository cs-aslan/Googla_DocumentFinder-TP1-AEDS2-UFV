Only time can bring the peace of mind you treasure  
Only love can really break your heart  
But we must feel the pain before the pleasure  
Only then can we tell them apart  
We are never too afraid of taking chances  
Searching in the dark with no concerns  
But its always the same with all romances  
Its the heart that never seems to learn  
Thinking that its finally my turn  
Like a fool believing every word  
You tell me that its over but thats not what I heard  
Cause my heart just never seems to learn  
Many times Ive wished that love had never found me  
After knowing all the pain it brings  
Always hoping to feel your arms around me  
Without fear of losing everything  
Its the heart that will awaken all the senses  
And the senses light up the soul  
But we hide what we feel with more pretenses  
Than the pride that comes before the fall  
Thinking that its finally my turn  
Like a fool believing every word  
You tell me that its over but thats not what I heard  
Cause my heart just never seems to learn  
How can I ever find what Ive always wanted  
With a heart that never seems to learn  
Never seems to learn
