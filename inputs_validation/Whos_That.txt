Whos that kissin in the corner  
And whos that talkin on the phone  
Whos that smilin like a soldier  
And why you tellin me to go  
  
Whos that drinkin all the Daniels  
And whos that sittin in the rain  
Whos that readin all my annuals  
And whys it sunny once again  
  
As blind as a bat  
As wise as an owl  
Let go of me let go of me now  
Who is that who is that who is that  
  
Whos that playin a sonata  
And whos that mimicin my nerves  
Whos that actin like Sinatra  
And why has angel dressed in furs  
  
So whos that walkin like the penguin  
And whos that handin me a stout  
Whos that always never ending  
And no I didnt even come  
  
So whos that dancin kind of reggea  
And whos that askin for a fight  
Whos that Is it necassary  
To kick me out into the night  
  
Whos that drinkin all the Daniels  
And whos that sittin in the rain  
Whos that readin all my annuals  
And whys it sunny once again
