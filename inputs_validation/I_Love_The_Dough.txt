Hah what I like this  
Uhh uhh I like this  
What Uhh what  
Uhh  
  
We push the hottest Vs peel fast  
through the city play Monopoly with real cash  
Me and Biggie and the models be shaking they saditty ass  
And parotta be somethin you cats got to see  
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones  
Bein broke is childish and Im quite grown  
Run up in the club with the ice on me and Paisan  
Scope the spot out see somethin nice and Im gone  
You cats is home screamin the fights on  
Im in the fifteen hundred seats watchin Tyson  
Same night same fight  
But one of us cats aint playin right I let you tell it  
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons  
And tell me you wont ball every chance you get  
and any chance you hit we live for the moment  
Makes sense dont it Now make dollars  
Cats pop bottles bone chicks that favor Idalis  
and rack up frequent flier mileage  
  
Gotta let it show I love the dough hey  
I love the dough more than you know  
Gotta let it show I love the dough hey  
  
Im poppin Magnums while Jigga bag somethin  
Watch is platinum got jet lag from  
flights back and forth pop corks of the best grapes  
Make the best CDs and the best tapes  
Dont forget the vinyl take girls break spinals  
Biggie be Richie like Lionel shit  
You seen the Jesus dipped to H classes  
Ice project off lights chick flashes  
Blind your broke asses even got rocks in big mustaches  
Rock top fashions  
Aint shit changed except the number after the dot  
on the Range way niggaz look at me now kinda strange  
I hate yall too  
Rather be in Carribean sands with Rachael  
Its unreal out the blue Frank White got sex appeal  
Bitches used to go Ewww  
Still tote steel tryin to see five mil  
off the single for real  
You aint fazin the amazin  
While your guns raisin mine is blazin  
See you on see me all talkin to sweetness  
Take it for weakness and leave quick  
Blocker Roca Fella Bad Boy collabo  
Two MCs with mad dough ju know  
  
I love the dough more than you know  
Gotta let it show I love the dough hey  
I love the dough more than you know  
Gotta let it show I love the dough hey  
  
Miraculous pockets stay full  
Niggaz skip the bull cause we matadors  
Snatch the P89s that we pack in the drawers  
And we clappin doors in your Acuras  
Snap like cameras on amateurs  
Make you all dance hold a hammer to yours  
Jig and Big rock ice no cracks or flaws  
Erybody got a part to play back to yours  
Run up in your crib now crack your doors  
Watch the real players live its a habit to floss  
Play the charts like the Beatles yall adapt you lost  
And toast Cristal on behalf of yall  
Too bad for yall aint too many as bad as yours  
truly do we we laugh at yall  
Little bastards yall  
  
Uhh uhh  
We hit makers with acres  
Roll shakers in Vegas you cant break us  
Lost chips on Lakers gassed off Shaq  
Country house tennis courts on horseback  
Ridin decidin cracked crab or lobster  
Who say mobsters dont prosper  
Niggaz is actors niggaz deserve Oscars  
Me Im critically acclaimed slug past your brain  
Reminesce on dames who coochie used to stink  
When we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links  
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places  
Tito smile everytime he see our faces  
Cases catch more than outfielders  
Half these rappin cats aint seen war  
Couldnt score if they had point game they lame  
Speak my name I make em dash like Dame  
  
I love the dough more than you know  
Gotta let it show I love the dough hey  
I love the dough more than you know  
Gotta let it show I love the dough hey  
I love the dough more than you know  
Gotta let it show I love the dough hey
