Pass Hell pain but no Coumbaya

But too late my lifes to great to wait

I wake up every morning in the canopy bed  
Slip a kiss to the Miss you the man she says  
Mirror mirror need I call  
You know uno bad breath an all  
Times I been fed up still didnt let up  
Stead a doin dirt did work and kept my head up  
Set up  
For the future much love to my girl  
North Pole got my butt cold sittin on top of the world  
An Im feelin so high  
Touch the ceiling the sky  
You say I smile cause Im on top of the pie  
But yo the cream can only finance the smile for a little while  
My grin got longevity got family backin me  
Thats why Im livin happily  
Ever after love and laughter  
Hussle cause I wants to not cause I have to  
Ask yourself who made the polar caps melt  
FP the phenomenon true Don Juan Jon Blaze  
The Fonz aint seen my Happy Days  
The track plays Im in the shades singin a phrase

They say the clothes dont make the man  
Take my hand  
Watch me freak this  
Ahmommys tryin ta creep this  
Tryin to entice me to let it off  
But nah why not cmon baby you saw Set It Off  
Proposition by trio in Rio  
Menage Trois down at the Marde Gras  
But nah my clothes by Versace  
My attitude cocky the sym its Imanyaki  
Like a felon no tellin what I do next  
I dont front cause Im paid but I do flex  
Southwestern crib like a villa  
Vacation on a mountain in Manilla  
Rhyme spilla real thrilla  
An its real clear  
Yall talkin East and West Im talkin hemispheres  
My papa raised no fool  
So many zeros on my check its like oooooooooooohh
