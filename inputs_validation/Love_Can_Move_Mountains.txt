Aone two three four  
  
A cynical mind wont help you through the night  
And it cant hold you up when youre too tired to fight  
Where you didnt have the strength to look after yourself  
You find all that you need for somebody else  
  
Love can move mountains  
Love can move mountains  
Love can move mountains yes it can  
Love can move mountains  
  
That impossible task youre thinking of  
Is one you can complete when youre driven by love  
And the strength that you find wont go slipping away  
Once it enters your soul its reborn every day  
  
Love can move mountains  
Love can move mountains  
Love can move mountains yes it can  
  
So if youre lucky enough to live  
To see love come your way  
Be thankful every day that it stays  
Wo that it stays  
  
A cynical mind wont help you through the night  
And it cant hold you up when youre too tired to fight  
  
But love can move mountains  
Love can move mountains  
Love can move mountains yes it can  
Love can move mountains  
Love can move mountains yes it can  
Love can move mountains  
Love can move mountains  
Love can move mountains
