What about the time  
You were rollin over  
Fall on your face  
You must be having fun  
  
Walk lightly  
Think of a time  
Youd best believe  
This thing is real  
  
Put away that gun  
And this part is simple  
Try to recognize  
What is in your mind  
  
God help us  
Help us lose our minds  
These slippery people  
Help us understand  
  
Whats the matter with him Hes alright  
I see his face The lord wont mind  
Dont know no games Hes alright  
Love from the bottom to the top  
  
Turn like a wheel Hes alright  
See for yourself The lord wont mind  
Were gonna move Right now  
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel  
  
I remember when  
Sittin in the tub  
Pulled out the plug  
The water was runnin out  
  
Cool down  
Stop acting crazy  
Theyre gonna leave  
And well be on our own  
  
Seven times five  
They were living creatures  
Watch em come to life  
Right before your eyes  
  
Backsliding  
How do you do  
These slippery people  
Gonna see you through
