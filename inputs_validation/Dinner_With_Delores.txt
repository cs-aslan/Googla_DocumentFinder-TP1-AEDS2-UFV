Dinner with Delores  
Must be some kind of sin  
Like a Brontosaurus  
She was packin it in  
The first night we dined  
And by the next time  
This girl was eatin all but the tip  
  
And by the stroke of midnight  
She wanted some more more  
Showin dirty movies  
Like some kind of whore  
But she was wastin her time  
Cause there wasnt a line  
That would make me come round her door  
  
Dinner with Delores  
Must be some kind of sin  
Her bells just abroken bells just broken  
Since 1984  
Dancin Dancin like a white girl white girl  
On disco dirty floors  
Damn Delores pick another subject please  
Introduce the carpet 2 something other than your knees  
  
Like a real confession  
No one could be more made up than you  
Nothins left for guessin  
What a shame  
Boo hoo Boo hoo  
  
Delores  
Delores  
  
Id call you a friend  
But it must be a sin  
And Ive run out of cheeks to turn  
  
Dinner with Delores  
No more  
Thats the end
