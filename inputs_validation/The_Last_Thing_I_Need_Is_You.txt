Oh hey what a glorious day its been  
Oh lord look at the mess Im in  
My car broke down  
So I waited for a shuttle bus  
It never came instead I got the rain  
  
I broke a heel I chipped a nail  
I lost the dog How could I feel  
On days like these on days like these  
  
The last thing I need is you  
And your black and white views  
Pushing me over  
Making a bad day worse  
What are you a curse  
  
Hey why cant you see on days like this  
The last thing I need is  
  
AGee whizz what a barrel of fun its been  
Oh yeah laugh at the mess Im in  
Hey hey what a triple odd place to be  
The doctor says that its not good for me  
  
I broke a tooth I tore my shirt  
I lost the zip of my favorite skirt  
Then you told me that I was a bore in bed  
  
The last thing I need is you  
And your black and white views  
Pushing me over  
Making a bad day worse  
What are you a curse  
  
Hey why cant you see  
On days like this  
The last thing I need is  
  
Baa baa babaa baa  
Baa baa babaa baa  
Baa baa babaa baa  
Baa baa babaa baa  
  
The last thing I need is you  
And your black and white views  
Pushing me over  
Making a bad day worse  
What are you a curse  
  
Hey why cant you see  
When Im in a rush or last in a cue  
When I need a break The last thing I need is
