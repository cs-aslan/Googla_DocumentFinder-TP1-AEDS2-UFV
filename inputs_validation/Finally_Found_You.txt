You know Im gon get ya yeah  
Whatever it takes to get there

Like everybody else does  
  
Forget about your friends they dont care where we go  
If they do well get lost in a crowd of people

Together baby we go we go  
  
In this crazy world of choices Ive only got a few  
Either youre coming with me or Im coming with you

Okay so can I get love too much to ask for  
Really so tough  
Find yourself moving with sex of the drums  
Got my hands full grabbin all these girls girls  
Hands up hands up dance floor chillin while I hold two cups  
Cant stop spilling cause Im drunk as fuck  
And my song comes on and the club goes nuts  
Every time the side goes seems to ya sleep best that to ya know  
Running around and doing all these shows  
Round the whole globe I come and you go girl  
And you need to think of it  
Just wrap for the night baby live a bit  
With a place to hit and your pants to zip  
You can make a scene and party are you into it  
  
In this crazy world of choices Ive only got a few  
Either youre coming with me or Im coming with you  
Cause I finally found I finally found you  
  
Finally finally finally found you  
Finally finally finally found  
Finally found I finally found you  
  
You know Im gonna get yeah
