If you ever leave me baby  
Leave some morphine at my door  
Cause it would take a whole lot of medication  
To realize what we used to have  
We dont have it anymore  
  
Theres no religion that could save me  
No matter how long my knees are on the floor  
Ooh so keep in mind all the sacrifices Im makin  
Will keep you by my side  
Will keep you from walkin out the door  
  
Cause therell be no sunlight  
If I lose you baby  
Therell be no clear skies  
If I lose you baby  
Just like the clouds  
My eyes will do the same if you walk away  
Everyday it will rain  
  
Ill never be your mothers favorite  
Your daddy cant even look me in the eye  
Ooh if I was in their shoes Id be doing the same thing  
Sayin there goes my little girl  
Walkin with that troublesome guy  
  
But theyre just afraid of something they cant understand  
Ooh but little darlin watch me change their minds  
Yea for you Ill try Ill try Ill try Ill try  
Ill pick up these broken pieces til Im bleeding  
If thatll make you mine  
  
Cause therell be no sunlight  
If I lose you baby  
Therell be no clear skies  
If I lose you baby  
Just like the clouds  
My eyes will do the same if you walk away  
Everyday it will rain  
  
Dont you say goodbye  
Dont you say goodbye  
Ill pick up these broken pieces til Im bleeding  
If thatll make it right  
  
Cause therell be no sunlight  
If I lose you baby  
Therell be no clear skies  
If I lose you baby  
Just like the clouds  
My eyes will do the same if you walk away  
Everyday it will rain
