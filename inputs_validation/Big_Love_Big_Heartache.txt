Oh yes I know its true  
The more you fall in love  
The more your heart can break in two  
Now that youve said goodbye  
  
For every tender kiss  
Ive had the tears I cry  
I gave my heart and soul  
All the love I knew  
  
Oh how much it hurts me now  
To know that we are through  
  
Ill always feel this way  
My arms will be so empty  
Youll return some day and say  
Your love yes your big love  
Will be here to stay  
Till then its  
  
Your love yes your big love  
Will be here to stay
