I cant explain about last night  
Though things didnt look just right  
Please believe me there was nothing wrong  
I thought about you baby all night long  
Cross my heart hope to die  
Well I wouldnt tell you no lie mmm  
  
Talk about a piece of rotten luck  
You do a friend a favor and you wind up stuck  
She couldnt hold a candle to you no siree  
Very hard to handle like a Model T  
Cross my heart hope to die  
Well I wouldnt tell you no lie  
  
Please believe me when I say  
Wild horses couldnt drag me away  
From you cause I dont have to look too hard  
To see what Ive got in my own back yard  
So be forgiving and forget  
Dont say my alibis all wet   
I miss those kisses from your honeycomb  
This humble bumble bee just wants to fly back home  
Cross my heart hope to die  
Well I wouldnt tell you no lie  
  
I wouldnt tell you no lie  
No no no no no no  
I wouldnt tell you no lie
