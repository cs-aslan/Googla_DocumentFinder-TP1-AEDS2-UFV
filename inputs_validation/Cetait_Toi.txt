Here I am again  
In this smoky place  
With my brandy eyes  
Im talking to myself  
You were the one  
You were the one  
  
Here I go again  
Looking for your face  
And I realize  
That I should look for someone else  
But you were the one  
You were the one  
  
Im looking for comfort  
That I can take  
From someone else  
But after all  
I know there is no one  
That can save me from myself  
You were the only one  
  
Me revoici  
Dans ce bar enfume  
Avec mes yeux ivres  
Je me parle a moi meme  
Cetait toi  
Cetait toi  
  
Me revoici  
Cherchant ton visage  
Et je realise  
Que je devrais en chercher une autre  
Cetait toi  
You were the one  
  
Je recherche laffection  
Quune autre pourrait me donner  
Mais apres tout  
Je sais quil ny a personne  
Personne qui puisse me sauver  
Tu etais la seule  
  
Im looking for comfort  
That I can take  
From someone else  
But after al  
I know there is no one  
That can save me save me from myself  
You were the only one
