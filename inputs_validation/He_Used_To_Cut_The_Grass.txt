Joe  
Im out at last  
Boy the world sure looks different  
Wow    theres hardly anything fun to do  
Since they made music illegal  
But Im hooked  
I got the habit  
Ive got to have it  
I need to play  
But theres no musicians anymore  
Theyre all gone  
Wait Ive got it  
Ill be sullen and withdrawn  
Ill dwindle off into the twilight realm  
Of my own secret thoughts  
Ill walk through the parking lot  
In a semicatatonic state  
And dream of guitar notes  
To go with the loading zone announcements

Turn it down  
Turn it down  
I have children sleeping here  
Dont you boys know any nice songs  
Im calling the police  
I did it  
Theyll be here    shortly  
Im not joking around anymore  
Youll see now  
There they are    theyre coming  
Just listen to that mess would you  
Every day this goes on around here  
He used to cut my grass     
He was a very nice boy     
He used to cut my grass     
He was a very nice boy     
He used to cut my grass     
He was a very nice boy     
He used to cut my grass     
He was a very nice boy     
  
Central Scrutinizer  
  
This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER    Yes    he used to be a nice boy   
He used to cut the grass    But now his mind is totally destroyed by music
Hes so crazy now he even believes that people are writing articles and
reviews about his imaginary guitar notes and so continuing to dwindle in the
twilight realm of his own secret thoughts he not only dreams imaginary guitar
notes but to make matters worse dreams imaginary vocal parts to a song
about the imaginary journalistic profession
