Chorus  
Gonna go down fightin  
Gonna go down fightin  
Cause I know that Im right and  
Im gonna go down fightin for your love  
  
Well I know what your thinkin  
You got me up against the wall  
But the higher that your flyin  
The further down you gotta fall  
Now dont you be fooled by my shakin knees  
Cause I can fight dirty and when Im scared  
I get mean  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I know youre thinkin  
That the odds is on your side  
But the first thing you gotta learn is  
That it just dont come down to size  
I can see the seeds of doubt  
Begin to grow on your face  
If you want to back down now  
You know thats no disgrace
