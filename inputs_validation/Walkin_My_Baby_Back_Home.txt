Natalie  
Gee Its great after being out late  
Walking my baby back home  
Arm in arm over meadow and farm  
Walking my baby back home  
  
Nat  
We go along harmonizing a song  
Or Im reciting a poem  
Owls go by and they give me the eye  
Walking my baby back home  
  
Natalie  
We stop for awhile he gives me a smile  
I snuggle my head to his chest  
We started to pet and thats when I get  
My powder all over his vest  
  
Nat  
After I kinda straighten my tie  
She has to borrow my comb  
One kiss then we continue again  
Walking my baby back home  
  
Nat  
Shes fraid of the dark so I have to park  
Outside of her door till its light  
  
Natalie  
Now I say if he tries to kiss me Ill cry  
  
Nat  
Id try her tears all through the night  
  
Both  
Hand in hand to a barbque stand  
  
Nat  
Right from her doorway we roam  
Eats and then its a pleasure again  
  
Both  
Walking my baby  
Talking my baby  
Loving my baby  
I dont mean maybe  
Walking my baby back home  
  
Natalie
