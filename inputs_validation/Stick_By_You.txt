Im gonna stick by you everyday  
I wont let you down now  
No matter what they say  
I wont let them get to you no way  
Ill stick by you  
Im going to stick by you  
Now I know  
No matter what tomorrow brings  
I wont let you go  
I wont let them get to you oh no  
  
Ill stick by you  
And when the laughter seems to fade away  
And Mr Sun becomes a rainy day  
Oh I dont matter cause youll know anyway  
I wont let you down  
Im gonna stick by you  
Ill stick by you  
  
Going to stick by you now I know  
No matter what tomorrow brings  
I wont let them get to you no  
Ill stick by you Ill stick by you  
Ill stick by you Ill stick by you
