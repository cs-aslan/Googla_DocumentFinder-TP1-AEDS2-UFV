Worthy You are worthy  
Much more worthy than I know  
I cannot imagine  
Just how glorious You are  
And I cannot begin to tell  
How deep a love You bring  
O Lord my ears have heard of You  
But now my eyes have seen  
  
Youre worthy  
Youre worthy  
Youre worthy  
Youre worthy to be praised  
Forever and a day  
  
Glory I give glory  
To the One who saved my soul  
You found me and You freed me  
From the shame that was my own  
And I cannot begin to tell  
How merciful Youve been  
O Lord my ears had heard of You  
But now my eyes have seen  
  
Well sing an anthem of the highest praise  
Well sound an anthem of Your glorious name
