Everything has a reason  
At least thats what they all say  
And Ive lost my count of the seasons  
I dont know whats been makin me stay  
  
Manys the times that youve hurt me  
Thats just the way that you live  
Many a time is forgotten  
But I never said that I can forgive  
  
Chorus  
So baby dont cry cry me a river  
And baby dont try to wash over me yeah  
Baby dont cry my ship is now sailin  
And Ive wasted all my time in your sea  
And Ive wasted all my time in your sea  
  
Now that your toys have been broken  
I guess you want company  
There is no point in you callin  
cause Im headed for my own destiny  
  
Now everyone has a problem yeah  
Lord knows youve always been mine  
The nights are always the hardest  
But tonight some how I know Ill be fine  
  
Chorus
