I was born with my hand in a fist  
And my eyes shut tight  
Any wonder that I cannot resist  
Punchin blindly in a fight  
The first time I saw swans flyin to the sun  
I wanted to be one  
  
Like every mothers son  
When I saw my life had begun  
I wanted to be someone  
Like my brother and my one and only father  
And like every mothers son  
  
I was raised within a cause  
With a purpose to fulfill  
I was taught to defend what was mine  
And instructed not to kill  
My small mortal eyes can see eternity  
In the clouds that dissolve and then regroup endlessly  
  
Like every mothers son  
When a man showed me how to use a gun  
I wished Id never need one  
Like my brother and my one and only father  
And like every mothers son  
  
Everything in domesticity  
Assumes its role better than me  
Im a displaced person whose culture let me down  
I raise my own daughters in a pornographic town  
  
Like every mothers son  
Ive lost some and some Ive won  
Now Im waiting for a new dawn  
Like my brother and my one and only father  
And like every mothers son
