Chorus  
You could meet somebody you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun  
Life in the shadows aint no fun  
  
Its easy getting up there  
Never think of coming down  
Not hard to say I want you  
When youre floating on a cloud  
But you know that lonely feeling  
When nothings going right  
Cause its only the beginning  
Of a cold and sleepless night  
  
Chorus  
  
You could meet somebody you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun  
Your only chance is to turn and run  
  
Its harder getting up there  
And its painful coming down  
And now you cant see clearly  
Beneath the thunder cloud  
And the loneliness gets longer  
When nothings going right  
And things aint getting any better  
With another sleepless night  
  
Chorus  
  
You could meet somebody you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun  
Your only chance is to turn and run
