The blue of blue  
Is mostly grey  
Aint no silver line  
No brighter day  
Last of the coming up  
Didnt come my way  
Looks like Im down here to stay  
Down to stay  
  
So kick me I wont feel a thing  
My senses have all been run  
And theres nothing left of the used to be  
But the weeping thats just begun  
That sour taste too late  
But now I duck my head  
And no cradle rocks this empty bed  
If cryings not good for me  
Then I guess Im doing wrong  
So I sing this crying song  
Cry along  
  
You packed it in too soon  
You lose me but not your nerve  
Well I guess I know its what I deserve  
Crazy to think that I could keep you on reserve  
And so the curtain falls  
Curtain falls
