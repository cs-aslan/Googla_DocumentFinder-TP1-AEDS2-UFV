In Japanese  
As my hair is touching your shoulders  
Red winds are singing all over town  
Oriental HeyHo Shes gonna be there climbing the stair  
Flag waving up in the air  
Shes gonna be there jungle somewhere  
And Boy  Take your eyes away from her  
And Boy  Lay them on another girl  
Shes a Teaser Japanese  
Shes a Teaser Japanese  
Shes a Teaser Japanese  
And Boy  Youre gonna get burned Queen of Arts  
HeyHo Eyes of black meet eyes of blue  
Beast and Beauty wave goodbye  
Sayonara Moon up in the sky  
And Boy  Take your eyes away from her  
in Japanese I wish to say many things   
But you are not here  
I want to ask you a lot   
But you are not here  
You promised to be back soon  
Was it only to comfort me  
I do want to see you again  
And Boy  Take your eyes away from her  
in Japanese  
I beg you to return to me
