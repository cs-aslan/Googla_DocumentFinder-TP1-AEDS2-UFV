I began to spoke my brains holding the grip of a giant vice  
It was all very good  
Floating higher and higher a wonderful feeling  
  
Die Die Die  
  
Im watching closely just to see  
So I can rest in peace  
I put my face close make sure youre not breathing  
You look so nice so pretty dress  
Youre painted skin can say the rest  
Until they bury you I wont believe it  
  
Breathing Not breathing Breathing Not breathing  
  
How can it feel so right when its so right  
Now that youre dead its gonna turn me on  
Youre not like Jesus Christ youre just gone  
Now that youre dead its gonna turn me on  
  
Breathing Not breathing Breathing  
  
I see that nothing in your eyes  
Could turn me cold as ice  
I steal a kiss to make sure youre not breathing  
We picked you out a pretty cage  
Scribbled some bullshit on the grave  
Until they bury you I wont believe it  
  
Breathing Not breathing Breathing Not breathing  
  
How can it feel so right when its so right  
Now that youre dead its gonna turn me on  
Youre not like Jesus Christ youre just gone  
Now that youre dead its gonna turn me on  
  
Life as precious as it is Ive waited for this day  
Ive waited for your death for you to fade away  
As precious as it is Ive waited for this day  
Ive waited for your death for you to fade away  
As precious as it is Ive waited for this day  
Ive waited for your death for you to fade away  
As precious as it is Ive waited for this day  
Ive waited for your death for you to fade away  
  
How can it feel so right when its so right  
Now that youre dead its gonna turn me on  
Youre not like Jesus Christ youre just gone  
Now that youre dead its gonna turn me on  
  
How can it feel so right when its so right  
Now that youre dead its gonna turn me on  
Youre not like Jesus Christ youre just gone  
Now that youre dead its gonna turn me on
