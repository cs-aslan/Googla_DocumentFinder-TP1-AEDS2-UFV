I am the entertainer  
And I know just where I stand  
Another serenader  
And another longhaired band  
Today I am your champion  
I may have won your hearts  
But I know the game youll forget my name  
And I wont be here in another year  
If I dont stay on the charts  
  
I am the entertainer  
Im dressed in the style  
I wear all kinds of sparkles  
I flash the crowd my smile  
But when the night is over  
And I stand without my clothes  
Perspiration stains and varicose veins  
My eyes look shot  
My bellys got a pot  
And theres a pimple on my nose  
  
I am the entertainer  
Been all around the world  
Ive played all kinds of palaces  
And laid all kinds of girls  
I cant remember faces  
I dont remember names  
Ah but what the hell  
You know its just as well  
Cause after a while and a thousand miles  
It all becomes the same  
  
I am the entertainer  
I bring to you my songs  
Id like to spend a day or two  
I cant stay that long  
No Ive got to meet expenses  
I got to stay in line  
Gotta get those fees to the agencies  
And Id love to stay but theres bills to pay  
So I just dont have the time  
  
I am the entertainer  
I come to do my show  
Youve heard my latest record  
Its been on the radio  
Ah it took me years to write it  
They were the best years of my life  
It was a beautiful song  
But it ran too long  
If youre gonna have a hit  
You gotta make it fit  
So they cut it down to 305  
  
I am the entertainer  
The idol of my age  
I make all kinds of money  
When I go on the stage  
Ah youve seen me in the papers  
Ive been in the magazines  
But if I go cold I wont get sold  
Ill get put in the back in the discount rack  
Like another can of beans  
  
I am the entertainer  
And I know just where I stand  
Another serenader  
And another longhaired band  
Today I am your champion  
I may have won your hearts  
But I know the game youll forget my name  
I wont be here in another year  
If I dont stay on the charts
