If youre looking for me  
Youll find me resting in the shade  
Of the mountains and trees  
Beneath the cool summer breeze  
And I dont mind if you stay  
Everybodys alone  
Everybodys alone  
People talking to me  
Someone saying that Im not the same  
Thats not so easy to be  
But when Ill learn to be free  
I wonder if Ill miss the pain  
Everybodys alone  
Everybodys alone  
All I want you to know  
Is that I love you so much  
I can hardly stand it  
When everybodys alone  
Everybodys alone  
Everybodys alone  
Everybodys alone
