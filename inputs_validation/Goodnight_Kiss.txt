Goodnight kiss in your nightgown  
Lavender in your bed  
So innocent as you lie down  
Sweet dreams that run through your head  
  
Are you lonely without Mommys love  
I want you to know Id die for that moment  
Youre just a poor girl  
Afraid of this cruel world  
Taken away from it all  
  
Its been 5 years to the day and  
My tainted bloods still the same  
I cant help acting this way and  
Those bastard doctors are gonna pay  
  
Im so lonely without babys love  
I want you to know Id die for one more moment  
Im just a poor girl  
Afraid of this cruel world  
Taken away from it all
