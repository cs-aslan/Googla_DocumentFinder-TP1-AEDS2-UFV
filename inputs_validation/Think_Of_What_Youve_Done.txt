Chorus  
Is it true that Ive lost you  
Am I not the only one  
After all this pain and sorrow  
Darlin think of what youve done  
  
Heart to heart dear how I need you  
Like the flowers need the dew  
Lovin you has been my life love  
Lord I cant believe were through  
  
Chorus  
Well Ive go back to Colorado  
Where the mountains meet the sky  
It was here I learned to love you  
And Ill stay here till I die  
  
Chorus Twice
