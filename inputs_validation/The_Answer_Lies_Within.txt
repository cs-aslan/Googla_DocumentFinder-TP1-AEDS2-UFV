Look around  
Where do you belong  
Dont be afraid  
Youre not the only one

Dont let it end  
Dont let a day go by in doubt  
The Answer Lies Within  
  
Life is short  
So learn from your mistakes  
And stand behind  
The choices that you make  
  
Face each day  
With both eyes open wide  
And try to give  
Dont keep it all inside  
  
Dont let the day go by  
Dont let it end  
Dont let a day go by in doubt  
The Answer Lies Within  
  
Youve got the future on your side  
You gonna be fine now  
I know whatever you decide  
Youre gonna shine  
  
Dont let the day go by  
Dont let it end  
Dont let a day go by in doubt  
Youre ready to begin  
  
Dont let a day go by in doubt  
The Answer Lies Within
