They said release Remote Control  
But we didnt want it on the label  
They said Fly to Amsterdam  
The people laughed but the press went mad  
  
Ooh ooh ooh someones really smart  
Ooh ooh ooh complete control thats a laugh  
  
On the last tour my mates couldnt get in  
Id open up the back door but theyd get run out again  
At every hotel we was met by the Law  
Come for the party  come to make sure  
  
Ooh ooh ooh have we done something wrong  
Ooh ooh ooh complete control even over this song  
  
They said wed be artistically free  
When we signed that bit of paper  
They meant lets make a lotsa monee  
An worry about it later  
  
Ooh ooh ooh Ill never understand  
Ooh ooh ooh complete control  lemme see your other hand  
  
All over the news spread fast  
Theyre dirty theyre filthy  
They aint gonna last  
  
This is Joe Public speaking  
Im controlled in the body controlled in the mind  
  
Total  
Seeon control  that means you
