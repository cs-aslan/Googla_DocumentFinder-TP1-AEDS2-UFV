Weve been around forever  
Look at us now together  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
Saying hello to men friends  
Smiling across a friends friends  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile if you dare  
  
Well stand around forever  
Regardless of time or weather  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
Looking for love and getting  
Nothing thats worth regretting  
But wondering why we travel so far  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile if you dare  
  
To speak is a sin  
Youd better beware  
But once in a while  
A smile if you dare  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile if you dare  
  
To speak is a sin  
Youd better beware  
And once in a while  
A smile if you dare oh
