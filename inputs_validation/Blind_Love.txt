Trying to hold a love that wants to go  
Is like trying to catch a falling flake of snow  
It glimmers while it can but it will melt between your hands you know  
To keep alive a love that wants to die  
You teach the birds to swim and all the fish to fly  
But gills are made for water and feathers for the sky yknow  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh x2  
  
To find a love thats new where do you start  
Its like trying to find the light switch in the dark  
But falling over mess you left unaddressed inside your heart  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh x2  
  
But I will find love thats a blind love  
Its the kind of love I need  
Oh well Ill find love thats a blind love  
Its the kind of love I need  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh x4
