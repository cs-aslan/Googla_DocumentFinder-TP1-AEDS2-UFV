Verse 1  
They say sing what you know  
But Ive sung what they want  
Some folks do what theyre told  
But baby this time I wont  
When I look through that door  
I know the truth from lie  
Some things Ive done before I cant justify  
  
PreChorus  
There are kings in my past  
Things no one can be proud of  
But I stand in the light Ive cast  
And turn away from any lack of love  
Oh when I walked through that door  
I say here I go  
You see me and nothing more  
Im singing what I know  
  
Chorus  
I know better  
I know better  
  
Verse 2  
Legend is just a name  
I know better than to be so proud  
I wont drink in all this fame  
Ill take more love than Im allowed  
  
PreChorus  
I wont hide or cut it off from where it came  
My history has brought me to this place  
This power and the color of my face  
  
Chorus  
And I know better  
I know better  
  
Bridge  
Ill rise from the floor if I dont win  
Ill bust open that door so let me in  
And if music chooses me to sing I let her  
Ill sing what I know yes  
  
Chorus  
I know better oh  
I know better yes  
I know better  
I know better
