Long for the sailor beneath the skies  
Long for the white dove no matter where she flies  
Long for the stranger you know so well  
  
Pray for the soldier whos wounded bad  
Pray for the dreamer hes still so sad  
Pray for the stranger you know so well  
  
Cause Im coming home  
  
Now the time has come  
  
For me to come back home  
  
Long for the eagle on wings so strong  
Long for the hunter he wont be long  
Long for the stranger you know so well
