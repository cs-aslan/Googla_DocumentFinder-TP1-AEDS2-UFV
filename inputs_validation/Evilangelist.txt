Little lamb come out of the rain  
Youll catch your death in the cold  
A helping hand come ease your pain  
In peace youll rest in our fold  
I can be a watch towering light  
For all those who cant see  
Ill separate the truth from the lies  
Blind faithful come follow me  
Evilangelist  
Your name is on my list  
Yeah Im your evilangelist  
In what God you trust  
Close your eyes while I hypnotize  
A friend in need to confess  
Youve been denied the cock crowed thrice  
Surrender all you possess  
Evilangelist  
Your name is on my list  
Yeah Im your evilangelist  
I was betrayed by a kiss  
So many claim to come in thy name  
Promising peace theyll bring  
Lest you taste the fruit of the vine  
Theyre just wolves in sheeps clothing  
Evilangelist  
Your name is on my list  
Yeah Im your evilangelist  
In what God you trust
