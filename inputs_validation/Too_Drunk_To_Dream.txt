Can you hear that lonesome moanin  
Is that you or is that me  
My broken heart aint aching for nothing  
That I cant touch or I cant see  
  
And do you hear that lonesome cryin  
Thought I made it stop its singin  
But my hands lay there on the bottle  
And I just drank till my heart would be  
Too drunk to dream  
  
So baby you can leave if you wanna  
There aint no drinkin when the bottle is dry  
Sugar you can leave if you want to  
I aint got no more tears to cry  
  
Do you hear that lonesome shuffle  
Of my feet walking out of the bar  
And I stumble down the same damn streets  
My daddy done stumbled before  
  
So baby you can leave if you wanna  
All the flowers in your garden have died  
Baby Im gonna have to warn you  
I aint got no more tears to cry  
  
Well sugar you can leave if you want to  
There aint no drinkin when the bottle is dry  
Baby Im gonna have to warn you  
I aint got no more tears to cry
