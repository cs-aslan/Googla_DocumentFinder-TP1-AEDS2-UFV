I found myself  
In a cross condition  
Maybe it was her  
Maybe it was me  
Somethins wrong  
There was somethin missin  
I couldnt stand to stay  
So I had to leave  
  
A half a tank of gas  
Brought me this distance  
Half a mind to run  
Got me this far  
Theres a woman willin  
Where there aint no witness  
Cept the one that lives  
In my heart of hearts  
  
My heart of hearts  
Wont lie to me  
It wont tell me things  
That I cant believe  
I better stop this thing  
Before it starts  
Cause it dont feel right  
To my heart of hearts  
  
I could be tastin  
Stolen kisses  
But that might  
Tear my world apart  
When it all comes down  
To my wish of wishes  
Id have to go with  
My heart of hearts  
  
My heart of hearts  
Wont lie to me  
It wont tell me things  
That I cant believe  
I better stop this thing  
Before it starts  
Cause it dont feel right  
To my heart of hearts  
  
I better stop this thing  
Before it starts  
Cause it dont feel right  
To my heart of hearts  
  
My heart of hearts  
Wont lie to me
