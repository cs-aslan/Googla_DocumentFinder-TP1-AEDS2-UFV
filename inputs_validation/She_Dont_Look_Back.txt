Shes got a way of getting so inside you  
That you think shes gonna steal your soul  
Shes got a way of making sure that you cant let go  
Shes got a trail of broken hearts behind her  
Like a shadow where no shadows cast  
I aint the first one and I doubt that Ill be the last  
Too longtoo late  
Youre wrong  
To ever think shed wait  
  
She dont look back  
She dont look back  
The lady dont look back  
  
And when shes gone shes gone  
You can never tell just what shes after  
You can never read it in her eyes  
And in her laughter theres no hint of compromise  
You can stare into the fire forever  
You can squeeze a stone until it bleeds  
But you will never find the kind of love she needs  
Too muchtoo late  
Youre such a fool to think shed wait  
  
She dont look back  
She dont look back  
The lady dont look back  
  
She dont look back  
She dont look back  
The lady dont look back
