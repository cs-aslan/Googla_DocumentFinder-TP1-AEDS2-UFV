I knew the end was in sight in sight  
And now youre walking out on me on me  
Youre wondering where the little tears can be can be  
Well baby

All my little tears are all dried out oh yeah  
Now that you say were through  
Im all cried out over you  
  
Last night I knew we were through were through  
It hurt cause I still loved you loved you  
Went home and couldnt fall asleep asleep  
Cause sleep just wont come into eyes that weep that weep  
And thats why
