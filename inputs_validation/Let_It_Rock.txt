Well up in the evening down in Mobile Alabama  
Working on the railroad with the steel driving hammer  
Gotta make some money to buy some brand new shoes  
Trying to find somebody to take away these blues  
She dont love me hear them singing in the sun  
Paydays coming and my work is all done  
Later in the evening when the sun is sinking low  
All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow  
Sitting in a tepee built right on the tracks  
Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back  
Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about  
Weve got an offschedule train comin two miles about  
Everybodys trembling and running around  
Picking up their money tearing the tepee down  
Foreman wants a penny  about to go insane  
Trying to get the workers out the way of the train  
Engineer blowing the whistle loud and long  
Cant stop the train gotta let it roll on
