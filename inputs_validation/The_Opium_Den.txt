 Dahinter schimmern die sterne  
May I introduce myself  
Im your poison  
Im gonna kill you tonite  
I do it slowly you gonna like it  
You remember me for the rest of your life  
But it wont last very long hang on  
It wont last very long so hang on  
To the opium den  
I hang out here every nite  
Im just waiting Im just waiting for you  
You gonna like what i you gonna like it  
You gonna like what I do  
But it wont last very long hang on  
It wont last very long so hang on  
To the opium den  
May I introduce myself  
Im your poison Im gonna kill you tonite  
I do it slowly you gonna like it  
You remember me for the rest of your life  
But it wont last very long hang on  
It wont last very long so hang on  
To the opium den  
It offers you comfort  
As everything about it  
It is mild without reason  
And for all it is perfect  
And it is there where I go now  
And it is there where I now go  
And it is there where I now go  
It is there Where i Now Go
