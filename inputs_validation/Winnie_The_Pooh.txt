I must a walked a mile  
Until I got to the rabbits house  
Mama rabbit cooked a soup for me  
And papa rabbit read a story out loud  
  
And then I went out to play yeah  
With my big big friend  
His name is big big Ben  
  
Winnie the pooh  
Winnie too too  
Is Winnie  
Winnie the pooh  
  
Hes my best best best best absolutely  
Best best friend  
His name is Winnie  
Winnie the pooh  
  
Theres a tree  
Not too far from here  
With the biggest honey hivewow  
That youve ever seen  
  
Papa rabbit said  
I shouldnt leave  
But I cant stop my feet now  
They just walk and walk  
  
But theres just a little problem  
Theres a million bees  
But they wont get to me  
  
Winnie the pooh
