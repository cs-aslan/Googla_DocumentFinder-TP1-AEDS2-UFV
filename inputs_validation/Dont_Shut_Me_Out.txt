Dont shut me out maybe baby  
We should talk about it  
Cause youve got your doubts but maybe baby  
They might be unfounded  
  
Have a little faith youll make it through  
Id never hesitate to talk to you  
If you tell me just whats weighing on your mind  
Maybe it could help you sleep tonight  
So dont shut me out  
  
Dont be so proud dont ya know that  
Before a fall it leaves ya  
And itll take you down baby that aint  
Where I want to see ya  
  
The sunll rise tomorrow come what may  
And youll feel better than you do today  
And in time youll cry no more  
I know cause my hearts been there before  
  
And here I am when you need someone  
My shoulders yours to cry upon  
And everybody now and then  
Needs and understanding friend around  
So dont shut me out

And you will find the answer every time  
Every road you travel on will lead  
To where it is your hearts supposed to be
