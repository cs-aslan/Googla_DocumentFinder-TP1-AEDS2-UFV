She says theres ants in the carpet  
Dirty little monsters  
Eating all the morsels  
Picking up the rubbish  
Give her effervescence  
She needs a little sparkle  
Good morning TV  
Youre looking so healthy  
  
Chorus  
We all say  
Dont want to be alone  
We wear the same clothes  
Cause we feel the same  
We kiss with dry lips  
When we say goodnight  
End of a century oh its nothing special  
  
Sex on the TV  
Everybodys at it  
The mind gets dirty  
As you get closer to thirty  
He gives her a cuddle  
Theyre glowing in a huddle  
Good night TV  
Youre all made up  
And youre looking like me  
  
Chorus  
  
Can you eat her yes you can  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Oh end of a century oh its nothing special
