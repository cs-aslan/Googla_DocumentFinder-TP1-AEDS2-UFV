When you tried to kiss me  
I only bit your tongue  
When you tried to get me together  
I only came undone  
When you tried to tell me  
The one for me was you  
I was in your mattress back in 1982  
  
Daria I wont be soothed  
Daria I wont be soothed over like  
Smoothed over like milk  
Silk a bedspread or a quilt  
Icing on a cake  
Or a serene translucent lake  
Daria Daria Daria  
I wont be soothed  
I wont be soothed  
  
When you tried to tell me  
Of all the love you had  
I was cleaning oil from beaches  
Seeing only what was bad  
When you tried to feed me  
I only shut my mouth  
Food got on your apron  
And you told me to get out  
  
Daria I wont be soothed  
Daria I wont be soothed over like  
Smoothed over like milk  
Silk a bedspread or a quilt  
Icing on a cake  
Or a serene translucent lake  
Daria Daria Daria  
Daria Daria Daria  
Daria I wont be soothed  
I wont be soothed
