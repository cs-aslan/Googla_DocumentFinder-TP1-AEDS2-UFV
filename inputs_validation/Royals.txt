Ive never seen a diamond in the flesh  
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies  
And Im not proud of my address in the torn up town  
No post code envy  
  
But every songs like gold teeth Grey Goose trippin in the bathroom  
Blood stains ball gowns trashin the hotel room  
We dont care were driving Cadillacs in our dreams  
But everybodys like Cristal Maybach diamonds on your timepiece  
Jet planes islands tigers on a gold leash  
We dont care we aint caught up in your love affair  
  
And well never be royals royals  
It dont run in our blood  
That kind of luxe just aint for us  
We crave a different kind of buzz  
Let me be your ruler ruler you can call me Queen Bee  
And baby Ill rule Ill rule Ill rule Ill rule  
Let me live that fantasy  
  
My friends and I weve cracked the code  
We count our dollars on the train to the party  
And everyone who knows us knows that were fine with this  
We didnt come from money  
  
But every songs like gold teeth Grey Goose trippin in the bathroom  
Blood stains ball gowns trashin the hotel room  
We dont care were driving Cadillacs in our dreams  
But everybodys like Cristal Maybach diamonds on your timepiece  
Jet planes islands tigers on a gold leash  
We dont care we arent caught up in your love affair  
  
And well never be royals royals  
It dont run in our blood  
That kind of luxe just aint for us  
We crave a different kind of buzz  
Let me be your ruler ruler you can call me Queen Bee  
And baby Ill rule Ill rule Ill rule Ill rule  
Let me live that fantasy  
  
Ooh ooh oh  
Were bigger than we ever dreamed and Im in love with being queen  
Ooh ooh oh  
Love is great without a care  
We arent caught up in your love affair  
  
And well never be royals royals  
It dont run in our blood  
That kind of luxe just aint for us  
We crave a different kind of buzz  
Let me be your ruler ruler you can call me Queen Bee  
And baby Ill rule Ill rule Ill rule Ill rule  
Let me live that fantasy
