Well youve got me workin so hard lately  
Workin my hands untill they bleed  
If I was twice the man I could be  
Id still be half of what you need  
Still you lead me and I follow  
From the small of your back up to your chin  
Over to the tip of your switchblade  
As you pull it out as you stick it in  
  
Twist twist twist  
It can go a little deeper  
Twist twist twist  
Im wearin these chains  
Twist twist twist  
You make it hurt real good  
Twist twist twist  
I love the pain  
  
Well you just leave me nailed here  
Hanging like Jesus on this cross  
Im just dying for your sins  
An aide to the cause  
  
Twist twist twist  
It can go a little deeper  
Twist twist twist  
Im wearin these chains  
Twist twist twist  
You make it hurt real good  
Twist twist twist  
I love the pain  
  
Wrap my soul in bandages  
Im tired of this war  
Go ahead and cut me  
I cant even feel it anymore  
  
Twist twist twist  
It can go a little deeper  
Twist twist twist  
Im wearin these chains  
Twist twist twist  
You make it hurt real good  
Twist twist twist  
But I love  
Love the pain  
  
Twist twist twist  
It can go a little deeper  
Twist twist twist  
Im wearin these chains  
Twist twist twist  
Make it hurt real good  
Twist twist twist  
I love the pain  
  
Twist twist twist  
Twist twist twist  
Twist twist twist  
Twist twist twist  
  
Turn it on Turn it on  
  
Is this on  
Oh  
Im so tired I cant get to sleep  
The squeaking of the bed  
Is right in time with the song thats repeating in my head  
Its uncomforting to remember  
How I used to like a good fuck every once in awhile  
I just wanted you to know  
That when I do it  
  
I only think of you
