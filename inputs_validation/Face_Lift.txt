I went so numb on Christmas day  
I couldnt feel my hands or feet  
I shouldnt have come  
She made me pay  
For gleaming with Donald down her street  
She put blame on him  
And shame on me  
She made it all seem so tawdry and cheap  
Oh lets be nice Mama open up your gifts  
You know happiness is the best face lift  
  
I mean after all she introduced us  
Oh but she regrets that now  
Shacked up downtown  
Making love without a license  
Same old sacred cow  
She said Did you come home to disgrace us  
I said Why is this joy not allowed  
For Gods sake Im middleaged Mama  
And time moves swift  
And you know happiness is the best face lift  
  
Oh love takes so much courage  
Love takes so much shit  
He said Youve seen too many movies Joni  
She said Snap out of it  
Oh the cold winds blew at our room with a view  
All helpful and hopeful and candlelit  
We kissed the angels and the moon eclipsed  
You know Happiness is the best face lift  
  
We pushed the bed up to the window  
To see the Christmas lights  
On the east bank across the steaming river  
Between the bridges lit up Parislike  
This river has run through both our lives  
Between these banks of our continuing delights  
Bless us dont let us lose the drift  
You know Happiness is the best face lift
