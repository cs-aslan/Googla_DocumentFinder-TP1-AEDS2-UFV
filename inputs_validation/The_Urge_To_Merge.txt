Though I think I really know you  
And you think you know me  
And were as close at two people  
Could ever hope to be  
Still I cant escape the feeling  
That no matter what I do  
Ill never understand what it feels like to be you  
I get the urge to know you better  
To make our spirits one  
I want to see us be together  
As close as we can come  
I get the urge to merge  
I get the urge to merge with you  
I get the urge to merge  
I get the urge to merge with you  
Have you ever wanted something  
You just had to possess  
And it turned into obsession  
And wouldnt let you rest  
There are times I cant help wishing  
I could melt right into you  
Hear every word youre thinking  
Feel everything you do  
I feel trapped inside my body  
And theres nothing I can do  
Want to leap across the wall  
Thats keeping me from you  
To break what cant be broken  
To say what cant be spoken  
If only for a moment  
To touch your soul  
I get the urge to know you better
