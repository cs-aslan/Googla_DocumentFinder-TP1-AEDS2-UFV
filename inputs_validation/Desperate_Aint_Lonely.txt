I try not to drink  
cause if I sit and think Ill go crazy  
Desperate aint lonely  
Though Ive been high  
Pockets are empty  
In the daytime Im lonesome in the nightime Im sad  
  
The letter I wrote  
Took words from my throat I was saying  
Lay on the roadside  
I guess the mailman was drunk  
The message was urgent  
How lazy a state where you dont live noone  
  
So I try not to drink  
cause if I sit and think Ill go crazy  
Desperate aint lonely  
Though Ive been high  
Pockets are empty  
In the daytime Im lonesome in the nightime Im sad
