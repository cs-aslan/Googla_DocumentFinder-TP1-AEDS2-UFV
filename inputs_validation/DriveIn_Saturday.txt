Let me put my arms  
Around your head  
Gee its hot lets go to bed  
Dont forget to turn on the light  
Dont laugh babe itll be alright  
Pour me out another phone  
Ill ring and see  
If your friends are home  
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome  
Can lend us a book we can read up alone  
  
And try to get it on like once before  
When people stared in Jaggers eyes  
And scored  
Like the video films we saw  
  
Chorus  
His name was always Buddy  
And hed shrug and ask to stay  
Shed sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid  
And turn her face away  
Shes uncertain if she likes him  
But she knows she really loves him  
Its a crash course for the ravers  
Its a Drivein Saturday  
  
Jung the foreman prayed at work  
That neither hands nor limbs would burst  
Its hard enough to keep formation  
Amid this fall out saturation  
  
Cursing at the Astronette 8  
Who stands in steel  
By his cabinet  
Hes crashing out with Sylvian  
The Bureau Supply  
For ageing men  
  
With snorting head he gazes to the shore  
Which once had raised a sea  
That raged no more  
Like the video films we saw  
  
Chorus  
  
Its a Drivein Saturday repeat
