This feeling never leaves you alone  
You pull the trigger on your own  
Youre hiding in your safe place  
Hiding with your eyes shut tightly  
On the way to the hospital  
  
Not will you ever rest your head  
You end up feeling mostly dead  
Pretending youre the last one  
Hiding with your eyes shut tightly  
On the way to the hospital  
  
Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
  
It never used to hurt before  
It isnt funny anymore  
Youre feeling so alone now  
Funny how you wish some way that you could die at the hospital  
  
Youre quiet on the car ride home  
Youre waiting for your head to explode  
Youre hiding in your safe place  
Hiding with your eyes shut tightly  
All the way to the hospital  
  
Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
Before I close my  
Before I close my eyes  
I hope to give it up  
Take off my  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
And leave the lies to the liars  
  
He thinks he fooled them all  
Hip hip hooray hip hip hooray  
He thinks he fooled them all  
Hip hip hooray hip hip hooray  
Hip hip hooray hip hip hooray  
  
Before I cross my heart and hope to die at all  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
Before I close my  
Before I close my eyes  
Im gonna give it up  
Take off my mask  
I take off my mask  
And leave the lies to the liars  
Leave the lies to the liars  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Leave the lies to the liars  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Leave the lies to the liars  
Hey hey hey
