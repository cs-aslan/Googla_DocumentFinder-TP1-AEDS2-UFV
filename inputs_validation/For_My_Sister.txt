Just yesterday  
You were looking up to me  
And You would ask me  
What I thought  
  
But now Im sitting here  
All alone with my tears  
Lookin at my life  
That Ive bought  
  
Where did I go yeah  
My eyes they will show  
  
And little me  
Please forgive me  
I couldnt see  
You hurting inside  
 Little me  
 Little me  
No more into you  
Little me oh no  
No ways ii must confess oh no  
No ways ii must confess oh no
