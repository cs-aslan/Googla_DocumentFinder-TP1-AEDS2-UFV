Those cocky little fires you started in the night  
The independent claims that just meant Hold me tight  
The bruises on your body that you swore were from a fight  
Ill pass at your insistence  
Alsatians fall unconscious at the shadow of your call  
One glance from your direction and the government will fall  
Whole continents of misery dont bother you at all  
But for me you have persistence  
  
Chorus  
Run all day run all night  
Do or die do or die  
Got to run for your life  
Do or die do or die  
  
Id like to leave so would you kindly look the other way  
You tell me to be honest but Ive nothing left to say  
Just like your feet my goddess my brain has turned to clay  
An end to all resistance  
  
Chorus x 3  
Run all day run all night  
Do or die do or die  
Got to run for your life  
Do or die do or die
