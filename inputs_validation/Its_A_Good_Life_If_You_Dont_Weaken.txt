When the colour of the night  
And all the smoke for one life  
Gives way to shaky movements  
Improvisational skills  
A forest of whispering speakers  
Lets swear that we will  
Get with the times  
In a current health to stay  
Lets get friendship right  
Get life daytoday  
In the forgetyerskates dream  
Full of countervailing woes  
In diverseasever scenes  
Proceeding on a needtoknow  
In a face so full of meaning  
As to almost make it glow  
  
O for a good life we just might have to weaken  
  
And find somewhere to go  
Go somewhere were needed  
Find somewhere to grow  
Grow somewhere were needed  
  
When the colour of the night  
And all the smoke for one life  
Gives way to shaky movements

Lets swear that we will

In a current health to stay  
Lets get friendship right  
Get life daytoday

O for a good life we just might have to weaken  
  
And find somewhere to go  
Go somewhere were needed  
Find somewhere to grow  
Grow somewhere were needed  
Find somewhere to go  
Lets go somewhere were needed  
Find somewhere to grow  
We grow where we are needed
