Belle  
If I could give a gift to you  
To hold to your heart dear  
Id give the Christmas memories  
To hold throughout the year  
  
And when you have them all I think  
Theres something more Id bring  
The gift of Christmas laughter now  
So you could learn to sing  
  
La la la la its Christmas time  
Memories everywhere  
Singing of hope peace to mankind  
And love is in the air  
  
And every foolish notion leads to feelings that might start  
To make the prayers the children pray  
Come true in all our hearts  
  
Beast  
If you could give a gift to me  
To hold to my soul dear  
Id love to see you smile upon my face  
Without a fear  
  
And when youve smiled your fear away  
Theres something more youd bring  
The gift of gifts remembering  
How I first learned to sing  
  
Both  
La la la la its Christmas time  
Memories everywhere  
Singing of hope peace to mankind  
And love is in the air  
  
And every foolish notion leads to feelings that might start  
To make the prayers the children pray  
Come true in all our hearts
