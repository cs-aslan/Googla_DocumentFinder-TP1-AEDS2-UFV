Thousands of people  
Live in this town  
And I had to run into him  
When I saw him there  
On that busy street  
Those feelings came back again  
  
There was no where to run  
No where to hide  
He walked up to me  
Looked in my eyes  
  
And still  
The world stood still  
I couldnt move  
And all I could feel  
Was this aching in my heart  
Saying I loved him  
Still  
  
He said howve you been  
Its great to see you again  
Youre really a sight for sore eyes  
I said I cant complain  
Oh Im doin fine  
We talked  
As the people rushed by  
  
We laughed about old times  
And all we went through  
Thats when he hugged me  
And said Ive missed you  
  
And still  
My world stood still  
I couldnt move  
And all I could feel  
Was this aching in my heart  
Saying I loved him  
Still  
  
Thats when she walked up to him  
He said this is my wife  
I gave my best smile  
But I was dying inside  
He said we gotta go now  
Its getting late  
It was so good to see you  
And then they walked away  
  
And still  
My world stood still  
I couldnt move  
And all I could feel  
Was this aching in my heart  
Saying I loved him  
Still
