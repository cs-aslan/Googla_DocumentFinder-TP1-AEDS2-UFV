Give me the highway  
Lord knows I love to roam  
Give me the highway  
Well I can hear the lonesome whistle moan  
White lines neon signs  
Have always been my home  
Give me the highway  
Cause I was born a rollin stone  
Down every road I travel  
Lord to you might look the same  
But maybe you might tell me  
Every towns got a different name  
Id like to find a woman  
That wont hellbent to tie me down  
Someone to be content  
To go anywhere Im bound  
Give me the highway  
Lord knows I love to roam  
Give me the highway  
Well I can hear the lonesome whistle moan  
White lines neon signs  
Have always been my home  
Give me the highway  
Cause I was born a rollin stone  
Give me the highway  
Lord knows I love to roam  
Give me the highway  
Well I can hear the lonesome whistle moan  
White lines neon signs  
Have always been my home  
Give me the highway  
Cause I was born a rollin stone  
Give me the highway  
Cause I was born a rollin stone
