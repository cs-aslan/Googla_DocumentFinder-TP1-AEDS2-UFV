In a manger like Christ I lay  
Yellow fever yellow hay  
Feel the rhythm sweetest sound  
Making breaking sacred ground  
Id give you a piece of my love for free  
But whatever I say youll never see  
Acquire a taste for a different sound  
Make or break it this side of town  
  
Life will never be the same  
In PortRoyal town I hear it coming  
The shaking of the ground  
Theyre stealing in the day  
In PortRoyal town the children are running  
  
Ever strange the lives we lead  
So detached from the things we need  
Signs of greed in everyone  
Instant eviction and the blood on a gun  
Just when you think youve found it  
Spinning world I want to spin around it  
What is wrong This pain wont peel  
The fibres of my life wont heal
