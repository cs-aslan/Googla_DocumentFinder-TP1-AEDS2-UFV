Ive been wonderin if its time  
To say whats on my mind  
Cause Im in the dark  
What was in your heart  
  
Whats in your heart  
I dont even know your name  
But the thought of you remains  
Suddenly my pulse is jumping  
Do you feel the same  
  
Talk it over with my friends  
And I guess it all depends  
How you really feel but can you comprehend  
You could be just around the corner now  
Hoping this love is yet to be found  
  
Its not too late to call my name  
So dont you look the other way  
Open your eyes and youll see  
My heart wont wait dont hesitate  
We got a chance weve gotta take  
It feels like you could be  
Forever part of me  
  
Can be right under my skin right under my skin  
I dont know where to begin  
Would I look the fool  
Should I play it cool  
Or jump right in  
  
How am I supposed to know  
Whether I should come or go  
Think its time we let our feelings show  
We might let the moment just pass us by  
Then its gone in the blink of an eye  
  
Its not too late to call my name  
So dont you look the other way  
Open your eyes and youll see  
My heart wont wait dont hesitate  
We got a chance weve gotta take  
It feels like you could be  
Forever part of me
