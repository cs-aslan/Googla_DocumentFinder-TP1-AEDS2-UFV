I still want your lovin  
And I still need your lovin  
But I cant live a life of lovin in vain  
Last night I saw you awalkin  
Talkin with another  
Overheard you tell her  
Our love dont mean a thing  
And as I walked away dear  
My heart broke down inside me  
I still want your lovin  
And I still need your lovin  
But I cant live a life of lovin in vain  
Id rather be a poor girl  
Not a penny to my name  
Than to know my life  
Would all be lived in vain  
Id rather be alone dear  
If you dont want to change  
I still want your lovin  
And I still need your lovin  
But I cant live a life of lovin in vain  
I still want your lovin  
And I still need your lovin  
But I cant live a life of lovin in vain
