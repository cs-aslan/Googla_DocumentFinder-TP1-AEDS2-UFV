So you got a little heartbreak  
Feeling like a dumb chump  
Laying in left field  
Cant believe you got dumped  
Everything gone wrong  
But youre listening to the right song  
  
Grab yourself a cheap seat  
Floating or flying  
Anything southbound  
Heading to the islands  
Grab a little white sand  
Maybe get your blues tanned  
  
Riptides rippin  
The sunsets dippin  
You smile that smile  
Keep on sippin  
  
Time flies  
Sitting in the sun  
When youre feeling numb  
Time flies  
When youre having rum  
When youre having rum  
  
Yeah you find a little beach bar  
Down on the water  
Sail away the Captain  
Feeling Jolly Roger  
Talking to a cutie  
Heading for the booty  
  
Riptides rippin  
The sunsets dippin  
You smile that smile  
Youll be saying  
  
Time flies  
Sitting in the sun  
Yeah when youre getting some  
Time flies  
When youre having rum  
When youre having rum  
  
Yeah  
  
Riptides rippin  
The sunsets dippin  
You smile that smile  
Youll be saying  
  
Time flies  
Yeah when your in the sun  
Yeah when youre feeling numb  
Time flies  
  
Time flies  
Sitting in the sun  
Yeah when youre getting some  
  
Time flies  
When youre having rum  
When youre having rum  
When youre getting some  
When youre feeling numb
