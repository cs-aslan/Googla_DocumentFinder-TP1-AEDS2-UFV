Cant say I dont love her  
Still I cant pretend  
That my heart is torn just knowing that Im losing my bestfriend  
If its easier said and done  
Then someone tell me why  
Though I try  
I cant find the words to say goodbye  
  
I could tell her that Im sorry  
Hope shell understand  
She will have to do with someone else  
All that we have planned  
Id rather her hear the truth  
Than hurt her with a lie  
So I tried  
But I cant find the words to say goodbye  
  
Now I know  
I have to go  
Theres no other way  
But goodbye is not what I can bring myself to say  
  
If I told her see you later  
Then I might be wrong  
cause this voice inside is driving me  
To find where I belong  
I know I must leave her now but everytime I try  
Dont know why  
Ibut I cant find the words to say goodbye  
Dont know why  
I cant find the words to say goodbye
