Green are your eyes  
In the morning when you rise  
Dont you be afraid my love  
To lie by me  
Your father will not know  
Love can be broken  
Though no words are spoken  
Dont you be afraid to lie  
By me my love  
Your father will not know  
Love dont cry  
Ill not try  
Dont you be afraid to lie  
By me my love  
Your father will not know  
Yes love dont you cry  
Ill not try  
Dont you be afraid to lie  
By me my love  
Your father will be told someday  
About our wedding day
