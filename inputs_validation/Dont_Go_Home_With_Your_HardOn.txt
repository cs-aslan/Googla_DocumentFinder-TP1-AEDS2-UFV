I was born in a beauty salon  
My father was a dresser of hair  
My mother was a girl you could call on  
When you called she was always there Repeat x5  
  
Ah but dont go home with your hardon  
It will only drive you insane  
You cant shake it or break it with your Motown  
You cant melt it down in the rain  
  
You cant melt it down in the rain  
You cant melt it down in the rain  
You cant melt it down in the rain  
  
Ive looked behind all of the faces  
That smile you down to you knees  
And the lips that say Come on taste us  
And when you try to they make you say Please  
  
When you try to they make you say Please  
When you try to they make you say Please  
When you try to they make you say Please  
When you try to they make you say Please  
  
Ah but dont go home with your hardon  
  
Here comes your bride with her veil on  
Approach her you wretch if you dare  
Approach her you ape with your tail on  
Once you have her shell always be there  
  
Once you have her shell always be there Repeat x4  
  
Ah but dont go home with your hardon  
  
So I work in that same beauty salon  
Im chained to the old masquerade  
The lipstick the shadow the silicone  
I follow my fathers trade  
  
I follow my fathers trade  
Yes I follow my fathers trade  
Yes I follow my fathers trade  
Yes I follow my fathers trade  
  
Ah but dont go home with your hardon  
It will only drive you insane  
You cant shake it or break it with your Motown  
You cant melt it down in the rain Repeats
