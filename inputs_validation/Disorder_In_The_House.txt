Disorder in the house  
The tub runneth over  
Plasters falling down in pieces by the couch of pain  
  
Disorder in the house  
Time to duck and cover  
Helicopters hover over rough terrain  
  
Disorder in the house  
Reptile wisdom  
Zombies on the lawn staggering around  
  
Disorder in the house  
Theres a flaw in the system  
And the fly in the ointments gonna bring the whole thing down  
  
The floodgates are open  
Weve let the demons loose  
The big guns have spoken  
And weve fallen for the ruse  
  
Disorder in the house  
Its a fate worse than fame  
Even the Lhasa Apso seems to be ashamed  
  
Disorder in the house  
The doors are coming off the hinges  
The earth will open and swallow up the real estate  
  
I just got my paycheck  
Im gonna paint the whole town grey  
Whether its a night in Paris or a Fresno matinee  
  
Its the home of the brave and the land of the free  
Where the less you know the better off youll be  
  
Disorder in the house  
All bets are off  
Im sprawled across the davenport of despair  
  
Disorder in the house  
Ill live with the losses  
And watch the sundown through the portiere
