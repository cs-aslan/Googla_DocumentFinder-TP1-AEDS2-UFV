Chorus  
Well I never really knew you til you said goodbye  
You said its finally over heres the reasons why  
You said youve heard enough of all those little lies  
I never really knew you til you said goodbye  
  
I thought I made you happy but youve proved me wrong  
I thought I was the one that really turned you on  
When I came home tonight all my things were gone  
I guess gettin over me didnt take you long  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Well you said youd heard enough of all those little lies  
I never really knew you til you said goodbye  
No I never really knew you til you said goodbye
