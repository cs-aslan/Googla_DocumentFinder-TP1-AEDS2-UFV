Keri  
I Used To Move Around  
Im Feeling Kinda Stuck These Days Because Of You  
And Id Be On The Highway  
If Only I Could Leave My Place Because Of You  
I Used To Be A Talker  
But I Aint Got Nothing Good To Say Because Of You  
And I Be Trying To Hide But its Written All On My Face  
  
So I  
I Really Thought You Were The One The Only One  
I Guess That I Was Wrong  
Then You Turned Out You Wasnt It  
The Opposite  
Of Everything I Thought So  
  
What Do You Do After Love  
After Love  
What Can You Say When Its Said And Done  
Nothing At All  
cause you Cant Hide A Heart Break  
Yea I know  
And You Cant Stop These Tears From Falling Down  
So What Do You Do What Do You Do  
What Do You Do After Love  
After Love

PDiddy

I Remember That First Day  
That I Saw Her Face  
The Feeling I Had Sorta Felt Like My Birthday  
Beautiful I Must Say  
She Was My Earthquake  
Cute Face Nice Shape  
She Made My Earth Shake  
Ima Try And Keep The Faith  
Do It Like The Church Say  
She The One For Me And I Dont Care What Him Or Her Say  
Thought I Had A Home Run  
But Im Just At First Base  
I Found Out In The Long Run  
Just Another Heart Break  
So How Much Can My Heart Take  
You Was Like Air To Me  
You Know I Wouldnt Leave  
I Needed You To Breathe  
See Life Is But A Dream  
So Is Love And I Believe  
If You Ever Been In Love  
You Would Know What I Mean  
Yea So Lord Help Me Please  
I Wanna See The Light  
She Keep Telling Me Im Wrong  
But I Know Im Right  
Im Tryin To Ignore  
cause I Dont Wanna Fight  
I Know I Make Mistakes  
But Still I Need Her In My Life  
  
Keri  
Tell Me How Im Supposed To Heal This Open Wound Because Of You  
And Tell Me Who Woulda Thought That Id Ever Be Trying To Get Over You  
Im Stuck In The Moment Of Memories Of Me And You  
And I Can Get Over It But I Aint Sure If I Want To  
  
cause You Have Made Your Bed Now you Gotta Lie In It  
you Gotta Lie In It Babe  
Now All The Things you Said Dont Mean A Thing  
Dont Mean A Thing To Me No  
  
I Cant Believe I Gave you One  Last  Shot  
I Let It Ride Now Baby Its  Your  Stop  
I Was Supposed To Leave  Now The Jokes On Me  
It Took A While To Finally Come To My Senses  
But What  
  
What Do You Do After Love Ooh Ooh  
What Can You Say When Its Said And Done  
When Its Over Oh  
cause you Cant Hide A Heart Break Yea I Know  
And You Cant Stop These Tears From Falling Down  
So What Do You Do Ooh Ooh  
What Do You Do After Love  
After Love Baby  
After Love  
  
PDiddy  
Yea I Know you Hear Me  
Listen To Me Please  
But This Is What You Need To Do  
Pay Attention  
She Know Who Im Talking To And I Know you Listening  
I Think About You All The Time If Not Every Minute  
I Promise Hurting You Was Never My Intentions  
Its Something Bout Your Style The Way That you Present It  
Every Fantasy I Ever Had You Was In It  
I Apologize For Every Time That You Might Have Cried  
Theres Not Enough Words To Describe How I Feel Inside  
Guardian Angel Sent From The Skies  
I Always Knew You Woulda Made A Beautiful Bride  
And Thats Why  
I Wish You Coulda Stayed So Much  
But I fucked Up  
And Went And Betrayed Your Trust  
You Know Theres No More  
Dolce And Gabbana Gucci Prada Trips To Nevada  
And I Admit What You Heard Is Probably True  
But Outta All These Girls The Only One I Love Is You  
I Love You  
  
Keri  
Im Broken But Im Hoping Somebody Put Me Back Together 4x  
  
What Do You Do After Love  
What Can You Say When its Said And Done  
When its Over  
Cos you Cant Have A Heart Break  
And You cant Stop Your Tears From Falling Down  
So What Do You Do What Do You Do  
After Love
