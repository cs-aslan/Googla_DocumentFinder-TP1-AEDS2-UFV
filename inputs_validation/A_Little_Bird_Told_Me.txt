A little bird told me that you love me  
And I believe that you do  
This little bird told me I was fallin  
Fallin for no one but you  
  
Theres no use denying  
I might as well confess  
Of all the girls I know dear  
Im sure I love you best  
  
The little bird told me wed be happy  
And I believe that its true  
This little bird told me wed be married  
Yea Yea And I believe that its true  
  
Well have a pretty cottage  
Not too far  
All fenced in like a movie stars  
Well call him Ace  
Lying there by the fireplace  
A goldfish pond and a wishing well  
Everything is gonna turn out swell  
  
A little bird told me wed be happy  
Yea yea And I believe that its true  
For I believe that its true  
Dont you know that I believe that its true  
Well baby I believe that its true
