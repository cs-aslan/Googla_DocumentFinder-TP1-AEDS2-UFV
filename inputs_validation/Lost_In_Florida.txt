Lost in Florida lost in Florida  
Heres the ocean and heres the sand but I dont know where I am  
Heres a seashell and heres a fish heres a turtle and heres a wish  
If you find me take me home if they dont want me leave me alone  
If you find out they forgot me take me back to ole Sopchoppy  
Lost in Florida lost in Florida  
Heres an oyster and heres a clam but I dont know where I am  
Heres a gator and heres a bear but I dont worry and I dont care  
If you find me take me home  
Lost in Florida lost in Florida  
Heres the skyline and heres the land but I dont know where I am  
Call me Bobby or call me Paul but dont call me north at all  
Lost in Florida lost in Florida lost in Florida lost in Florida
