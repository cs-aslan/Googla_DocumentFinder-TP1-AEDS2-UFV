Come on step inside and you will realize  
Tell me what you need tell me what to be  
Whats your vision  
Youll see what do you expect of me  
I cant live that lie  
Hate  
  
I sing my words Im fucked at dealing  
with your lifes dead bodies everywhere  
You  
  
Really want me to be a good son why  
You make me feel like no one  
Let me strip the plain let me not give in  
Free me of your life inside my heart dies  
Your dreams never achieved dont lay that shit on me  
Let me live my life  
  
Hate  
I sing my words Im fucked at dealing  
With your lifes dead bodies everywhere  
  
You  
Really want me to be a good son why  
You make me feel like no one  
You want me to be something I can never ever be  
I sing my words I thought that didnt  
With your lifes dead bodies everywhere  
  
You  
Really want me to be a good son why  
You make me feel like no one  
Dead bodies everywhere
