Now its just you and me my blue friend  
And you say that its you that shes thinking of and our affair must end  
But if its you that shes thinking of  
I think my broken heart might mend  
  
Well its my turn to talk your turn to think  
Your turn to buy my turn to drink  
Your turn to cry my turn to sink  
Down in the blue chair down in the blue chair  
  
Now Ive made up my mind Ive made my mistake  
And I know that she cries for you when shes barely awake  
Well shes going to bend your mind  
Well I hope it dont break  
  
Now its my turn to talk your turn to think  
Your turn to buy my turn to drink  
Your turn to cry my turn to sink  
Down in the blue chair down in the blue chair  
  
Down in the blue chair  
We can watch our troubles rise  
Like smoke into the air and drift up to the ceiling  
  
Down in the blue chair  
You can feel just like a boy or a man  
And next minute you can find yourself kneeling  
  
Down in the blue chair  
Theyre boasting of loving the daylights  
Right out of her in the small hours  
  
Down in the blue chair  
You say that your love lasts forever  
When you know the night is just ours oh  
  
And still I want her right now  
Not in a minute hour or day  
And wherever she is tonight I want her anyway  
I suppose she never said to you you were just in the way  
  
Now its my turn to talk your turn to think  
Your turn to buy my turn to drink  
Your turn to cry and my turn to sink  
Down in the blue chair down in the blue chair  
Down in the blue chair down in the blue chair  
  
Down in the blue chair down in the blue chair  
Down in the blue chair down in the blue  
Blue becomes you  
Down in the blue chair
