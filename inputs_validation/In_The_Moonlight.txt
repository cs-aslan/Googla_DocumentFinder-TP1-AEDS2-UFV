In the moonlight  
Gettin why I ought to get back  
Its a this day is sure to relapse  
Its getting closer to upends  
  
In the moonlight  
Given two lost wings  
A beautiful star I see  
A wonderful sense of feeling  
  
In the moonlight  
Feel its a love draw nearer  
Darkened days I spent in  
A night bird is following you all the time  
  
Under a starlined ceiling  
In darkness I see  
All your senses revealed  
In the moonlight  
  
Its its the love draw nearer  
Darkened days I spent in  
A night bird is following you all the time  
Its a love draw nearer  
  
Darkened days I spent in  
A night bird is following you  
Is following you  
A night bird is following you all the time
