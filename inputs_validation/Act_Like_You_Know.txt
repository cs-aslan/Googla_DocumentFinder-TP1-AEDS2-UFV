Big Will and TraKnox  
Yo yo yo yo jump  
When I tell you make your way up to the front  
Addicted to the way I kick it I know what you want  
The don jiggy catering to what your feeling  
Pack it to the floor up to the ceiling  
Shake  
What ya momma gave you baby dont let nothing break  
Yo watch cause we dont care how much time its gonna take  
Dance floor packed and its looking like a lake  
Its abduction heres your instructions  
Slide  
Get up off that wall girl stop trying to hide  
Tracking aphrodisiac wont be denied  
Chill with that cigarette take it outside  
Messing with my vibe  
I dont like that  
Bounce  
Im a press your player when it counts  
Party like a lamb and a wolf about to pounce  
The don jiggy catering to what youre feeling  
Pack it to the floor up to the ceiling  
  
Chorus  
Bring it on the nothing  
Aint no time for fun things come on  
Just let it flow jump on  
Act like you know  
The only floor is jumping  
Ooh these girls are something come on  
Just let it flow jump on  
Act like you know  
  
IIII called Jazzy Jeff on the phone  
I said Im downstairs waiting Jeff come on  
I told him theres this hot spot we gotta burn  
He said Man after last weekend havent you learned  
Yo look here last week was a mistake  
That mommy trying to dish out what she couldnt take  
Come back me dancing like wow like this thing is a game  
One little move on her and she bust into flames whoosh  
The whole club running trying to ruin my night  
I told her roll around little shell be alright  
Then everybody mad at me all up in my face  
Somebody shouldve told that girl to stay in her place  
You feel a little heat baby girl Im behind ya  
And hopefully your burnt Gucci dress will remind ya  
Of how serious I am maybe its crazy why yall  
But if you want to play hunny go get a baby doll  
Holla at me  
  
Chorus  
  
Uh uh huh  
Check and make sure Im looking cute for huh  
Check and make sure Im packing lute for huh  
Cause Im about to shut down the bar for huh  
And later open up my car door for huh  
7 PM I leave the set and then  
No more acting back to rapping again  
Red carpet hectic getting me in  
What happened last week sure it could happen again  
Mos def full funk when ya looking at the front looking like a jet magazine
beauty of the month  
Shades low laying liggy low on the cut  
Told myself youre the one to shake it up with  
Bounce  
Over to your table can get me on announce  
Observe the curves body fat about an ounce  
Hormones pumping out dangerous amounts  
Grabbed ya arm turn around girl  
Jump  
Move when I tell ya make your move up to the front  
Addicted to the way I kick it I know what ya want  
The don jiggy catering to what youre feeling  
Pack it from the floor up to the ceiling  
Come on  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Come on
