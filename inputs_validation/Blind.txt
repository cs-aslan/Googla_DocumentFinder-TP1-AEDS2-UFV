Signs  
Signs are lost  
Signs disappeared  
Turn invisible  
Got no sign  
Somebody got busted  
Got a face of stone  
And a ghostwritten biography  
Dogs start to run in  
Hungry for some food  
Dogs start atwitching  
And theyre looking at you  
It was light  
By five  
Torn all apart  
All in the name of democracy  
Hes hurt  
Hes dying  
Claimed he was a terrorist  
Claimed to avert a catastrophe  
Someone shoulda told him  
That the buck stops here  
No one ever said  
That he was involved with thieves  
And theyre blind blind  
Blind blind blind blind blind  
Blind blind  
Blind blind blind blind blind  
  
No sense of harmony No sense of  
Time Dont mention harmony Say  
What is it What is it What is it Give  
A little shock and he raises his hand  
Somebody shouts out says What is  
It What is it What is it  
He was shot down in the night  
People ride by but his bodys still alive  
The girl in the window what has she  
Done She looks down at me  
Says I dont want to die  
  
And Im blind blind  
Blind blind blind blind blind  
Blind blind  
Blind blind blind blind blind  
Somebody could have told us where they go  
Crawling all around looking for foot foot footprints  
Now tell me what the Hell have we become  
Some dirty little bastards What the Hell is going onyou  
No sense of harmony No sense of  
Time Dont mention harmony Say  
What is it What is it What is it Give  
A little shock and he raises his hand  
Somebody shouts out says What is  
It What is it What is it  
He was shot down in the night  
People ride by but his bodys still alive  
The girl in the window what has she  
Done She looks down at me   
Says I dont want to die  
  
Theyre blind and theyre blind  
Blind blind blind blind blind  
Blind blind  
Blind blind blind blind blind  
Blind blind  
Blind blind blind blind blind  
Blind blind  
Blind blind blind blind blind
