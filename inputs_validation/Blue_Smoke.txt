Blue smoke climbin up the mountain  
Blue smoke windin round the bend  
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train  
That I am ridin in  
I left a note I wrote Im leaving  
And I wont be coming back  
Blue smoke rolling rolling rolling  
Rolling rolling down the track  
Oh clickadee clickadee clickadee clack  
Just stay on track an never look back  
Choochoo choochoo woowoowoo  
Blue smoke is comin through  
  
Oh I know Im gonna miss you  
But I hope it aint for long  
And I wonder if youre even gonna notice that Im gone  
Oh it hurts to know you cheated  
And it hurt to know you lied  
But it hurts me even worse to know you never even tried  
  
I packed my suitcase full of heartaches  
Headin to the train depot  
And I bought a oneway ticket  
On that train they call Blue Smoke  
I left the station straightup midnight  
Feelin lonely lost and blue  
In a trail of blue smoke with my heart broke  
Said goodbye to you  
  
Blue smoke climbin up the mountain  
Blue smoke windin round the bend  
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train  
That I am ridin in  
I left a note I wrote Im leaving  
And I wont be coming back  
Blue smoke rolling rolling rolling  
Rolling rolling down the track  
Oh clickadee clickadee clickadee clack  
Just stay on track an never look back  
Choochoo choochoo woowoowoo  
Blue smoke is comin through
