If anything it should have been a better thing  
From underneath you  
Staring at the ceiling  
Its another world of chocolate bars  
And baseball cards and it hides  
Inside of all this tension that Im feeling  
But its all inside of you  
And its all inside of you  
  
Surprise Surprise  
I miss your hair you miss my eyes  
And this solitude is my confidence eroding  
So We slide inside of someones mouth  
And someones eyes until  
Theres a sound of something intimate exploding  
But its all inside of you  
Its all inside of you  
  
I wish that Id had anesthetized and sterilized and then  
I wouldnt have this evidence congealing  
Surprise surprise  
Another pair of lips and eyes  
And thats the consequence from actually feeling  
But its all inside of you  
Its all inside of you
