You took my breath away  
I want it back again  
Look at the mess Im in  
I dont know what to say  
I dont know how to feel  
You dont care anyway  
All I can do is wait  
You took my breath away  
  
You took this song of mine  
And changed the middle bit  
It used to sound alright  
But now the words dont fit  
Its getting hard to rhyme  
Impossible to play  
Ive tried it many times  
You took my breath away  
  
One day when the sun is shining  
There will be that silver lining  
  
You knocked my headlights out  
So turn them on again  
I cant see where Im going  
I cant tell where Ive been  
I dont know how to feel  
This hasnt been my day  
Seems like Ive lost a wheel  
You took my breath away  
  
You took my breath away  
You took my breath away  
You took my breath away
