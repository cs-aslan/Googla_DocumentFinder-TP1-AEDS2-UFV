I found the pieces in my hand  
They were always there  
It just took some time for me to understand  
You gave me words I just cant say  
So if nothing else  
Ill just hold on while you drift away  
  
Cause everything you wanted me to hide  
Is everything that makes me feel alive  
  
Chorus  
The cities grow the rivers flow  
Where you are Ill never know  
But Im still here  
If you were right and I was wrong  
Why are you the one whos gone  
And Im still here  
  
Im still here  
  
Youve seen the ashes in my heart  
You smile the widest when I cry inside and my insides blow apart  
I try to wear another face  
Just to make you proud  
Just to make you put me in my place  
  
But everything you wanted from me  
Is everything that I could never be  
  
Chorus  
  
Maybe tonight its gonna be alright  
I will get better  
Maybe today its gonna be okay  
I will remember  
  
I held the pieces of my soul  
I was shattered  
And I wanted you to come and make me whole  
Then I saw you yesterday  
But you didnt notice  
You just walked away  
  
Cause everything you wanted me to hide  
Is everything that makes me feel alive  
  
Chorus  
  
The lights go out the bridges burn  
Once you go you cant return  
But Im still here  
Remember how you used to say  
Id be the one to run away  
But Im still here  
  
Im still here
