Lets go  
  
Its three oclock at the Triple Rock  
Another round of watching batty talk  
  
Its where you wanna get snowed in when you can  
Snowing outside its ten below  
  
Is it day or night we dont care or know  
What we know is we dont want to be anywhere but here  
  
Please dont make us leave  
When in Minnesota and youve got a drinking quota  
  
Im seeing double at the triple rock  
Were still here watching batty talk  
  
Then undress and get out the top 10  
The One question still remains  
  
How much more oran can we take  
Ill let you know when the medication wears off  
  
Im a religious drunk  
And this is where I pray  
  
Were a church of alcoholics  
Cant bring up the congregation  
  
Give us air to breathe through carbonation  
We are at the good church and your feltching on bar stools  
  
Were praying that the tabs will keep the holy water flowing  
He keeps a communion and a long night of confessions  
  
Coming home after noon seems to raise a lot of questions  
When in Minnesota and youve got a drinking quota
