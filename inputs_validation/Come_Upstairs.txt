Sitting in a car here  
After a party where weve seen  
Everyone weve known for years  
Well Ive known you for years  
Oh but now its all changed  
And all of my feelings  
Have been rearranged  
  
Chorus  
Come upstairs  
Well be all alone  
Come upstairs  
No one will know  
Come upstairs  
We can take of the phone  
Come upstairs  
You can take of my clothes  
  
Say that it feels good  
Maybe too good to say that it feels like a dream  
You want to knock on some wood  
Well Ill give you some wood  
And Ill give you some fire  
Ill give you myself  
And I will show you my desire  
  
Come upstairs  
Well have a few laughs  
Come upstairs  
Well take a bath  
Come upstairs  
Its only one flight  
Come upstairs  
You can stay overnight  
  
Ill give you some wood  
Yeah Ill give you some fire  
Ill give you myself  
And I will show you my desire  
  
Chorus
