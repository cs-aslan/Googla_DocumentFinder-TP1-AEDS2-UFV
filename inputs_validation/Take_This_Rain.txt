It used to be there were two sets of footprints in the sand  
And there were two silhouettes in the sunset hand in hand  
But now here beside the sea are the footprints of three  
And I cant find my own  
Among the directions theyre all going  
  
Baby its alright  
Break this chain of love and madness  
Its alright  
Take this rain as your new address  
  
Its alright  
Take this rain  
Its alright  
Take this rain  
  
Cause Ive been running all over creation out of my mind  
Trying to keep our hearts beating together all of the time  
Going crazier every day  
Watching our love slipping away  
  
Cause youre the only home Ive ever wanted  
And the only light Ive known  
  
But baby its alright  
Break this chain of love and madness  
Its alright  
Take this rain as your new address  
  
Its alright  
Take this rain  
Its alright  
Take this rain  
Youre going to be free  
  
Some people go through life seeing just what they want to see  
Take the way I went on believing  
You might still believe in me  
And I still want the love I always thought our love could be  
But some things cant be changed  
Take this rain  
  
Youre going to hear my voice in the morning calling your name  
And know my love and my desperation were one and the same  
And where our footprints used to be  
Therell be nothing but the sea  
And the tide and the wind and the open sky  
And the unbroken horizon  
  
Baby its alright  
Break this chain of love and madness  
Its alright  
Take this pain and all this sadness  
  
Its alright  
Make this rain into your fortress  
Its alright  
Take this rain  
  
Its alright  
Take this rain  
Its alright  
Take this rain  
Youre going to be free
