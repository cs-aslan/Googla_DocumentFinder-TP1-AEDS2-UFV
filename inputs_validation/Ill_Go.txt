Theres a star in the palm of my hands  
And I think its yours  
You dont want me  
Then Ill understand  
You deserve much more  
When I brought it  
Down from the sky you almost forgot it  
It was new back when you gave a dam  
What ya need Ill go and get it  
  
But if I dont come back  
Girl your love was worth it  
Thats the one thing Ill know  
And if I dont make it back  
Girl remember that  
That I said Id go baby  
Girl your love is so hard  
But it takes me so far  
But I dont care Ill go  
If I dont make it home  
But at least now you know  
Girl for you Ill go  
  
Got my heart in the palm of your hands  
Now you sure thats yours  
If you dont want it  
I wont understand  
Cause I came so far  
When you tossed it  
It took forever to find the place where you lost it  
Now your gone with my heart out the door  
Well its here girl  
Dont forget it  
  
But if you dont come back  
Girl your love was worth it  
Thats the one thing I know  
If you dont make it back  
Girl remember that  
That I said Ill go for you  
Girl remember that  
That I said Id go baby  
Girl your love is so hard  
And it takes me so far  
But I dont care Ill go  
If I dont make it home  
But at least now you know Ill go
