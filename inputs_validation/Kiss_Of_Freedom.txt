Looking out at the open space  
Theres a new war beginning  
God my head is spinning  
I had to live cause I thought it was too late  
To far arised  
Now I am breathing  
Now I am seeing  
All the love that is flowing  
Confidence is growing  
Riding high on the magic carpet  
Way ahead of time  
  
Well taste the kiss of freedom  
It calls our name  
And everyone will shine  
Truth is yours and mine  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
Well taste the kiss of freedom  
It calls our name  
And everyone will shine  
Truth is yours and mine  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
  
Who cares about right or wrong  
When its down to the feeling  
Sets my head on wheeling  
You know it takes no warning signs  
To know whats going on  
And the hands  
Are touching hands  
When we turn to eachother  
From the sky to the cudder  
And untill our lifetime is coming down  
Im living on  
Well taste the kiss of freedom  
It calls our name  
And everyone will shine  
Truth is yours and mine  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
Well taste the kiss of freedom  
It calls our name  
And everyone will shine  
Truth is yours and mine  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
  
Looking out at the open space  
Theres a new war beginning  
God your head is spinning  
Flying over the wide horizon  
Far away from time  
  
Well taste the kiss of freedom  
It calls our name  
And everyone will shine  
Truth is yours and mine  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
Well taste the kiss of freedom  
It calls our name  
And everyone will shine  
Truth is yours and mine  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
  
Well taste the kiss of freedom  
It calls our name  
And everyone will shine  
Truth is yours and mine  
Ohohoh ohohoh  
  
Well taste the kiss of freedom  
It calls our name  
And everyone will shine  
Truth is yours and mine
