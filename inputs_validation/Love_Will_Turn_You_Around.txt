You can run you can hide never let it inside  
Keep livin your life in the dark  
But sooner or later that gentle persuader  
Is gonna catch up with your heart  
Make you a dreamer believer  
Believin in love  
  
Right when a mans doin all that he planned  
And he thinks hes got just what he needs  
Life will deliver a shock that will shiver  
And drivin him down to his knees  
Make him start givin livin  
Livin again  
  
Chorus  
Well its your mind that tricks you in believin every time  
Love will turn you around turn you around  
Well its your heart that talks you into to stayin where you are  
Love will turn you around turn you around  
  
Out of the blue she reaches for you  
And you tell her you dont have the time  
So you move away fast but you know it wont last  
Cause you cant get her off of your mind  
Thoughts are burnin turnin  
Theyre turnin around  
  
How do you know when to stay or to go  
And how do you know when its real  
You dont need a sign to make up your mind  
You got your heart at the wheel  
You want to start sharin carin  
Carin again  
  
Chorus  
  
Love will turn you around turn you around  
Love will turn you around turn you around  
Turn you around
