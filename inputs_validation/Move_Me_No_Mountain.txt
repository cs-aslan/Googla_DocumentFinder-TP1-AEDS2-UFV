Just as sure as I live  
I will love you alone  
You belong in my arms  
You belong in my home  
I dont expect you to be  
Someone else that youre not  
All I expect you to give  
Is all that youve got so  
CHORUS  
Move me no mountain  
Turn me no tide  
Swim me no ocean  
Long deep and wide  
Just say you love me baby  
Long strong and true  
But move me no mountain  
To prove that you do  
But move me no mountain  
To prove that you do  
Fill my life with your love  
Youre my bread youre my wine  
Fill my life with your love  
And Ill fill yours with mine  
Youll never hear me cry  
Tears of regret  
Its fine with me if all I see  
Is all I get  
Oh  
Just say you love me baby  
Just love me baby  
Long strong and true  
Move me no mountain  
Turn me no tide  
Swim me no ocean  
Long deep and wide  
Just love me baby  
Long strong and true  
Move me no mountain  
Turn me no tide  
Swim me no ocean  
Long deep and wide  
Just love me baby  
Say that you do  
Just love me baby
