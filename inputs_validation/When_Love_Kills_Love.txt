When love kills love  
Suddenly I think I always knew  
I had my share of mistakes  
Made quite a few  
Finally I know and thats for sure  
I dont look back in anger anymore  
Suddenly the sun comes up again  
Theres a new beginning  
When we pass the end  
Finally I know and thats for sure  
I dont look back in anger anymore  
When love kills love  
Will someone rescue me  
When love kills love  
Its cutting through so deep  
Suddenly I wake up from the dream  
Someone tells me  
Ive been talking in the sleep  
Finally I know and thats for sure  
I dont believe in daydreams anymore  
When love kills love  
Will someone rescue me  
  
When love kills love  
Its cutting through so deep  
Well life goes round  
And upside down  
Its pretty mad  
When love kills love  
Will someone set me free  
When love kills love  
Its cutting through so deep  
How can we choose  
When all we lose  
Is all we have  
We run away  
From all the pain  
We run away  
From all the pain  
When love kills love  
Will someone rescue me  
When love kills love  
Its cutting through so deep  
When love kills love  
When love kills love  
When love kills love  
When love kills love
