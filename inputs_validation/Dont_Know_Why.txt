I waited til I saw the sun  
I dont know why I didnt come  
I left you by the house of fun  
I dont know why I didnt come  
I dont know why I didnt come  
  
When I saw the break of day  
I wished that I could fly away  
Instead of kneeling in the sand  
Catching teardrops in my hand  
  
My heart is drenched in wine  
But youll be on my mind  
Forever  
  
Out across the endless sea  
I would die in ecstasy  
But Ill be a bag of bones  
Driving down the road alone  
  
My heart is drenched in wine  
But youll be on my mind  
Forever  
  
Something has to make you run  
I dont know why I didnt come  
I feel as empty as a drum  
I dont know why I didnt come  
I dont know why I didnt come
