One two three well  
I ran away from you  
Thats all I ever do  
And though I started here  
I ran away from you  
  
Im gonna come on in  
And see it through  
  
I ran away from you  
Thats all I ever do  
  
And when I heard you call to  
Come back to me  
And though I should stay  
I dont have the stomach to  
  
Everyone I know  
Says Im a fool mess with you  
Everyone I know  
Says its a stupid thing to do  
  
I have your love on call  
And yet my day is not so full  
There might be nothing left to do  
So I ran away from you  
  
Im gonna come on in  
My eyes are closed  
  
I can feel it there  
The suns so close  
Im gonna come on out  
And burn the sky  
  
A star arose in my own cage  
Im stuck in line  
And in a cage  
  
Just a single star  
I sing for  
  
Everyone I know  
Says Im a fool mess with you  
Everyone I know  
Says its a stupid thing to do  
  
I have your love on call  
And yet my day is not so full  
And I did not know what to do  
And so I ran away from you
