I cant lie  
I was attracted too  
Somehow the feelings  
Were so strong inside  
But Im not free to be  
In love with you maybe  
Things would be different  
In another place and time  
  
And I cant give you  
All you want me to  
And I know you deserve  
The best from me  
But I cant give you more  
Of all that you long for  
I would have loved you  
In another place and time  
  
Dreams arent always bound to come true  
But thats no reason you should cry  
  
Cause I would have loved you  
Really loved you  
In another place and time  
  
Im hurting deep inside  
Just want you to know  
Oh I would have loved you  
Oh yeah in another place and time  
  
Fate cant always be led by you  
The time aint right for you and I  
  
In another place and time  
In another place and time
