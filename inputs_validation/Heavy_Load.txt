At times it seems too rough things just drag me down  
Its hard to find the strength to just one more round  
When I need help I know where to go  
cause youre the best friend that I could ever know  
Being taught the words from you  from what is true  
Someone to share the pain that Im going through  
And its a heavy load that I bear and its a heavy crown that I wear  
As I travel down this road its a heavy load its a heavy load  
  
Its a heavy load that I bear and its a heavy crown that I wear  
So help me one more time its such an uphill climb  
As I travel down this road its a heavy load  
Lord its a heavy load Lord its a heavy load Lord its a heavy load  
Lord its a heavy load Lord its a heavy load
