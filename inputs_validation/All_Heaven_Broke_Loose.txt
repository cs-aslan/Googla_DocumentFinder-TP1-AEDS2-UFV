All heaven broke loose  
It hit me like a shot right out of the blue  
All heaven broke loose  
I was shaken by the power of love  
Taken by the power of you  
  
If I dont get to heaven  
For the things that Ive done  
I guess its all just history now  
Too late to be the innocent one  
I know that Ive been led astray  
Love has torn me apart  
But each day is a victory now  
Since you have given peace to my heart  
Oh I was a little bit crazy then  
Wheels kept turnin around  
And I kept losin ground  
Till you stopped me from fallin again  
  
Chorus  
  
The love that youve given me  
Is a love that is true  
And each time I feel like running  
I come running home to you
