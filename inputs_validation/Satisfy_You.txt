All I want is somebody whos gonna love me for me  
Somebody I can love for them  
All this money dont mean shit  
If you aint got nobody to share it with  
Love rules the world you feel me  
1  
R Kelly  
He dont understand you like I do  
No hell never make love to you like I do  
So give it to me  
Cause I can show you bout a real love  
And I can promise anything that I do  
Is just to satisfy you  
Puffy  
When it hurt I ease the pain girl caress your frame  
Get them worries off your brain girl Im in your corner  
Do what you want its your thing girl I persist and try but  
We one in the same girl it aint a game  
So I cant play with you I wanna lay with you  
Stay with you pray with you grow old and gray with you  
In good and bad times well always make it through  
Cause what we got is true no matter what they say to you  
I could straight lace you not just appearance  
Stimulate your mind strengthen your spirits  
Be that voice of reason when you aint tryna hear it  
You want it but you fear it but you love it when you near it  
Sit her on the sofa get a little closer  
Touch you right do it like a mans suppose to  
Knew you was the one thats why I chose you  
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier  
Repeat 1  
Your soul aint a toy you aint dealin with a boy  
Feel emptiness inside I can fill that void  
When you spend time with your woman and listen  
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten  
I cant impress you with the cars and the wealth  
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself  
Id rather show you its heartfelt make your heart melt  
And prove to you youre more important than anything else  
Worthwhile special like my first child  
When I see your face its always like the first time  
Our eyes met I knew wed be together in a trijet  
I wanna give you things that I didnt buy yet  
Hold you mold you dont know let me show you  
Aint no tellin what we could grow to  
Let it be known I told you  
And Imma be there for whatever you go through my loves true  
Repeat 1  
R Kelly  
Dont let him sing you a sad song No baby  
Waiting for love like this too long  
You dont have to wait you dont have to wait on him baby  
All that you need I can give you  
You dont have to wait you dont have to wait on  
I do satisfy you  
You dont have to wait on him  
Puffy  
Im the light when you cant see  
Im that air when you cant breathe  
Im that feeling when you cant leave  
Some doubt some believe some lie cheat and deceive  
So its only you and me  
When you weak Ill make you strong heres where you belong  
I aint perfect but I promise I wont do you wrong  
Keep you away from harm my love is protected  
Ill wrap you in my arms so youll never feel neglected  
Ill just make you aware of what we have is rare  
In the moment of despair Im the courage when youre scared  
Loyal down for you soon as I saw you  
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you  
Be around for you plant seeds in the soil  
Make love all night bending bed coils  
Youre a queen therefore I treat you royal  
This is all for you cause I simply adore you  
Repeat 1 until fade  
Puff  
This one right here goes out to all my  
Sisters
