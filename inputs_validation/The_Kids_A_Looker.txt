He cant dance or sing  
He cant do anything  
But what the hell  
The kids a looker  
Just add cash and stir  
And there you are  
Another nonsense nonstar  
La la la da da da la la la  
  
Theres no pretense  
This kid is dense  
But what the hell  
The kids a looker  
Just add cash and stir  
And the crass consumers line up  
Shoulder to shoulder  
La la la da da da la la la  
  
Sometime through the night  
The kid shed his life  
So very sad  
However do not call this number again  
Were busy molding the face  
Of the kids replacement yeah  
La la la da da da la la la
