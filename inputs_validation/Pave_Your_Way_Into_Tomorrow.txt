Pave your way into tomorrow  
  
Living for today is part of living for tomorrow  
For tomorrows something we all have to find  
Its blanket black at midnight  
So your faith must be your nightlight  
To erase the fear of darkness from your mind  
You have to pave your way into tomorrow  
Youve got to live and let your brother live as well  
Youve got to pave your way into tomorrow  
And let your love of living cast its spell  
  
Gentle raindrops falling people streams that keep on growing  
Till they build a raging river deep and wide  
Lifes just a big river and if each man is a giver  
We might help to make the ocean satisfied  
Youve got to pave your way into tomorrow  
Youve got to live and let your brother live as well  
Youve got to pave your way into tomorrow  
And let your love of living cast its spell  
And let your love of living cast its spell
