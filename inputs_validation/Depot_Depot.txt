Depot depot what am I doing here  
Depot depot what am I doing here  
I aint coming I aint going  
My confusion is showing  
Outside the midnight wind is blowing Sixth Avenue  
Im gonna paint myself blue  
At the depot  
  
I watch the taxis pull up and idle  
I cant claim title to a single memory  
He offered me a key  
Cause opportunity dont knock  
He has no tongue and she cannot talk  
Youre gonna shuffle when you walk  
At the depot  
  
This peepingTom needs a peephole  
And an uptempo song  
To move me along  
When I find this depot baby  
Im on a roll just like a pool ball baby  
Im gonna be there at the roll call maybe  
At the depot  
  
Outside the midnight wind is blowing Sixth Avenue  
Oh tell me what a poor boy to do  
At the depot  
Im on a roll just like a pool ball baby  
Im gonna be there at the roll call maybe  
At the depot  
The depot
