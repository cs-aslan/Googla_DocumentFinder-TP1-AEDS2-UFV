These are the original ones  
See the way she walks down the street  
Watch the way she shuffles her feet  
May she holds her head up high as she goes walking bye  
  
And she throws her hands out so fast  
And shes not just one of the pack  
My baby always the one to try the things theyve never done  
And just because of that theyre saying  
  
Shes a rebel and shell never be any good  
Shes a rebel cause she never never does what she should  
And just because she doesnt do what everybody else does  
Thats the reason why I can give her all my love
