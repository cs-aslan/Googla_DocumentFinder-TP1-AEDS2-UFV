I see you smiling at me  
And I fall into a daydream  
Dont know what all of this means  
Oh is it love  
Logic is slipping away  
My hearts on a runaway train  
  
Im gone yes Im gone yes Im gone and  
It feels so right  
  
Each time I look in your eyes  
So glad you came into my life  
Much more than an emotional high  
Oh this is love  
I know that Ive made up my mind  
Ill stay for the rest of my life
