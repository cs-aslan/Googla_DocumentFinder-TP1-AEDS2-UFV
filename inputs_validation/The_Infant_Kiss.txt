Say good nightnight  
I tuck him in tight  
But things are not right  
What is this An infant kiss  
That sends my body tingling  
Ive never fallen for  
A little boy before  
No control  
  
Just a kid and just at school  
Back home theyd call me dirty  
His little hand is on my heart  
Hes got me where it hurts me  
Knock knock Whos there in this baby  
  
You know how to work me  
All my barriers are going  
Its starting to show  
Let go Let go Let go  
I cannot sit and let  
Something happen Ill regret  
Ooh he scares me  
  
Theres a man behind those eyes  
I catch him when Im bending  
Ooh how he frightens me  
When they whisper privately  
Dont Let Go  
  
Windywailey blows me  
Words of caress on their lips  
That speak of adult love  
I want to smack but I hold back  
I only want to touch  
  
But I must stay and find a way  
To stop before it gets too much  
All my barriers are going  
Its starting to show  
Let go Let go Let go  
Dont let go
