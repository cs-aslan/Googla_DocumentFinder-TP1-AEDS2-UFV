Workin like a dog fo de boss man  
Workin for de company  
Im bettin on the dice Im tossin  
Im gonna have a fantasy  
But where am I gonna look  
They tell me that love is blind  
I really need a girl like an open book  
To read between the lines  
  
Chorus  
Love in an elevator  
Livin it up when Im goin down  
Love in an elevator  
Lovin it up till I hit the ground  
  
Jackis in the elevator  
Lingerie second floor  
She said can I see you later  
And love you just a little more  
I kinda hope we get stuck  
Nobody gets out alive  
She said Ill show ya how to fax in the mail room  
Honey and have you home by five  
  
Chorus  
  
In the air in the air honey one more time not it aint fair  
Love in an elevator  
Lovin it up when Im goin down  
  
Love in an  
Elevator  
Goin down  
  
Chorus  
  
Gonna be a penthouse pauper  
Gonna be a millionaire  
Im gonna be a real fast talker  
And have me a love affair  
Gotta get my timin right  
Its a test that I gotta pass  
Ill chase you all the way to the stairway honey  
Kiss your sassafras  
  
Chorus  
  
Do you care Do you care  
Honey one more time now it aint fair  
Love in an elevator  
Livin it up when Im goin down
