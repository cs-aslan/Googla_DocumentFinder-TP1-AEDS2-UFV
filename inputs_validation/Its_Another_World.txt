Its another world when Im with you  
Roses everywhere blue skies up above everybody is in love  
Its another world when Im with you and thats where I wanna be  
Never a day goes by when Im blue theres no tears in my eyes when Im with
you  
Its another world when Im with you  
Nights are made for love days are never long nothing nothing can go wrong  
Its another world when Im with you and thats where I wanna be  
 steel   
Never a day goes by when Im blue theres no tears in my eyes when Im with
you  
Its another world when Im with you  
And its here right now let me hold you close love you know just grows and
grows  
Its another world when Im with you and thats where I wanna be
