Rain on the brain  
Now theres flowers in your window  
She well shes so strange  
I dont know anything about her  
But if its all the same to you  
Heres what Im gonna do  
Im gonna write a song  
Gonna sing it to everyone  
And then Ill sing it to you  
cos it was you that wrote it too  
This could be the last train  
  
Search within yourself for feelings  
Everybodys got them  
You left me on the shelf  
And now theres noone to rely on  
But if its all the same to you  
Heres what Im gonna do  
Im gonna buy a gun  
Gonna shoot eberything everyone  
And then Im coming for you  
cos it was you that drove me to  
This could be the last train  
  
Woowoo  
Woowoo  
Woowoo  
Woowoo  
Rear window  
Wit the room in her hair  
And on her jacket  
Theres a picture of che guevara  
As he sits beneath the tree  
But thats not important  
But he look a bit like me  
If you took all the little feelings in your heart  
And took all those little feelings apart  
Oh well now  
Whats the point in doing all of that
