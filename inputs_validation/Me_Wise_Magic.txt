I know what youre thinkin  
what youre thinkin is easy to see  
I know what youre dreamin  
I have those same dreams  
WhoaReachin to the feet of God  
Lookin for a sign  
It was right here all the time time time time  
I am you and you are me  
  
Do You believe Dont you trust me Me Wise Magic Ow Baby its all right  
If you could see through my eyes Me Wise Magic  
  
I feel you breathin dont you trust metrust me  
I feel you agreein I know what you need whoa  
Dont you lie just you listen through me  
My words at best to you a fortune coo coo cookie  
Who are you and where are we  
  
Do You believe Dont you trust me Me Wise Magic Yeah yeah Woahohoh  
If you could see See through my eyes Me Wise Magic  
  
A little zen headed your way  
Youll get it halfway down the interstate  
Four days from now It all blows clear  
A Buddhist riff for your inner ear
