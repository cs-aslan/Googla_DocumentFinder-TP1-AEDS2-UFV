Yes Ive packed up my clothes  
Im moving away from your door  
Lord Ive packed up my clothes  
Said Im moving away from your door  
Ive been your fool for so long  
Babe I wont play that fool no more  
I gave you all my money  
I work as hard as I can  
I came home early one morning  
I found you with another man  
Babe Ive packed up my clothes  
Im moving away from your door  
Said Ive been your fool for so long  
And Lord I wont play that fool no more  
  
solo  
  
So goodbye baby  
you dont even care  
Yes I had a love so strong for you  
but you treat me so unfair  
Said Ive packed up my clothes  
Im moving away from your door  
You know Ive been your fool for so long  
And babe I wont play that fool no more
