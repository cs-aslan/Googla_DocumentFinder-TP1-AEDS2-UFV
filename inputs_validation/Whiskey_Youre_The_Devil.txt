Now brave boys were on the march  
Off to Portugal and Spain  
Drums are beating banners flying  
The Devil at home will come tonight  
  
So its go fare thee well  
With a too da loo ra loo ra doo de da  
A too ra loo ra loo ra doo de da  
Me rikes fall too ra laddieo theres whiskey in the jar  
  
Oh whiskey youre the devil youre leading me astray  
Over hills and mountains and to Amerikay  
Youre sweetness from the Bleachner and spunkier than tea  
Oh whiskey youre my darling drunk or sober  
  
The French are fighting boldly  
Men are dying hot and coldly  
Give every man his flask of powder  
His firelock on his shoulder  
  
So its go fare thee well  
With a too da loo ra loo ra doo de da  
A too ra loo ra loo ra doo de da  
Me rikes fall too ra laddieo theres whiskey in the jar  
  
Oh whiskey youre the devil youre leading me astray  
Over hills and mountains and to Amerikay  
Youre sweetness from the Bleachner and spunkier than tea  
Oh whiskey youre my darling drunk or sober  
  
Says the old man do not wrong me  
Dont take me daughter from me  
For if you do I will torment you  
When Im dead my ghost will haunt you  
  
So its go fare thee well  
With a too da loo ra loo ra doo de da  
A too ra loo ra loo ra doo de da  
Me rikes fall too ra laddieo theres whiskey in the jar  
  
Oh whiskey youre the devil youre leading me astray  
Over hills and mountains and to Amerikay  
Youre sweetness from the Bleachner and spunkier than tea  
Oh whiskey youre my darling drunk or sober  
  
Oh whiskey youre the devil youre leading me astray  
Over hills and mountains and to Amerikay  
Youre sweetness from the Bleachner and spunkier than tea  
Oh whiskey youre my darling drunk or sober
