Liquid melancholy dreams  
Tell me what it means  
Cause you drive me crazy  
Driftwood wont you float me down your stream  
Tell me what it means  
  
Cause you drive me crazy  
Cause youre crazy beautiful  
Cause youre crazy beautiful  
Cause youre crazy beautiful  
  
Dont go looking in my eyes tonight  
Dont go telling me lies tonight  
Dont go promising the skies tonight  
When youre crazy  
Cause youre crazy beautiful  
Cause youre crazy beautiful  
  
Listen all I need is you  
Wont you tell me what to do  
Cause you drive me crazy  
Baby is it pulling on your heart  
Is it tearing you apart  
  
Cause you drive me crazy  
Cause youre crazy beautiful  
Cause youre crazy beautiful  
  
Dont go looking in my eyes tonight  
Dont go telling me lies tonight  
Dont go promising the skies tonight  
When youre crazy  
Cause youre crazy beautiful  
Cause youre crazy beautiful  
Cause youre crazy beautiful  
  
If you dont need me I think Ill go  
If you dont want me tell me no  
If you dont need me I think Ill go  
Oh oh oh  
  
Dont go looking in my eyes tonight  
Dont go telling me lies tonight  
Dont go promising the skies tonight  
When youre crazy  
Cause youre crazy beautiful  
Cause youre crazy beautiful  
Cause youre crazy beautiful
