Nobody likes you  
Everyone left you  
Theyre all out without you  
Having fun  
  
Where have all the bastards gone  
The underbelly stacks up ten high  
The dummy failed the crash test  
Collecting unemployment checks  
Like a flunkie along for the ride  
  
Where have all the riots gone  
As your citys motto gets pulverized  
Whats in love is now in debt  
On your birth certificate  
So strike the fucking match to light this fuse  
  
The town bishop is an extortionist  
And he dont even know that you exist  
Standing still when its do or die  
You better run for your fucking life  
  
Its not over till youre underground  
Its not over before its too late  
This citys burnin  
Its not my burden  
Its not over before its too late  
  
Theres nothing left to analyze  
  
Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself  
And where will we all go when its too late  
  
And dont look back  
  
Youre not the Jesus of Suburbia  
The St Jimmy is a figment of  
Your fathers rage and your mothers love  
Made me the idiot America  
  
Its not over till youre underground  
Its not over before its too late  
This citys burnin  
Its not my burden  
Its not over before its too late  
  
She said I cant take this place  
Im leaving it behind  
  
Well she said I cant take this town  
Im leaving you tonight
