Well she was lookin out the window  
And I was starin at the door  
The dog was sleepin on the sofa  
This place has never been this quiet before  
You cant pretend it never happened  
You cant pretend its still the same  
You cant say you were only jokin  
You cant keep thinkin things can go on this way  
  
CHORUS   
Some things you cant take back  
Though you wish you could  
Some things you cant take back  
Though the glass has been broke  
And the milk has been spilled  
And your loves on the line  
Some things you cant take back  
When someone says theres no tomorrow  
When the writings on the wall  
After all have cried and spoken  
And your poor heart has taken such a fall  
  
REPEAT CHORUS   
If I could reset the clock and go back in time  
Id erase the thoughts that went through my mind  
You know I never would leave  
And Id still have you with me  
You cant pretend it never happened  
You cant pretend its still the same  
You cant say you were only jokin  
You cant keep thinkin things can go on this way  
  
REPEAT CHORUS   
Some things you cant take back  
Cause in the cold light of day the pieces all blew away  
And now Im livin a lie  
Some things you cant take back
