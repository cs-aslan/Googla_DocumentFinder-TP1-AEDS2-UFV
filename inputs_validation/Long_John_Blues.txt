Doctor Long John My dreams are full of Doctor Long John  
I got a dentist whos over seven feet tall  
I have a dentist whos over seven feet tall  
His name is Doctor Long John  
And he answers every call  
  
You know I went to Long Johns office  
I said Doctor the pain is killing me  
I went to Long Johns office  
I said Doctor the pain is killing  
He said Dont worry baby  
Its just your cavity needs a little filling  
  
He took out his trusty drill  
Told me to open wide  
He said he wouldnt hurt me  
But he filled my whole inside  
Long John Long John dont you ever go away No  
Cause you thrill me when you drill me  
And I dont need no novocain today  
  
Oh when he got done drilin he said  
Now Miss Midler that is going to cost you ten  
I was prepared to pay twenty  
Yeah yeah when he got done drillin he said  
Baby that is going to cost you ten  
But if it ever starts in to throbbing  
Come back and see old Long John  
Again and again and again and again and again  
Oh yeah Yow  
  
Long John I sold my heart to Doctor Long John and I will never never be the
same  
Oh thats so heavy I just gotta lay back
