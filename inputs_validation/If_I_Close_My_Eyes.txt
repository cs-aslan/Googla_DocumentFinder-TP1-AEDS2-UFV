If I close my eyes I can fly  
I can drink the rain and taste the sky  
I can catch the wind and make it mine  
Like the sun Ill shine  
Suddenly a door opens wide  
To a thousand paths Ive never tried  
Follow follow me I hear them say  
And youll find your way  
Maybe dreams are dreamed so that we can see  
Just how real the dawn can be  
How the dawn can be comes as no surprise  
If I simply close my eyes
