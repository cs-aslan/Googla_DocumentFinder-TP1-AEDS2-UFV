I can remember when we walked together  
Sharing a love I thought would last forever  
Moonlight to show the way so we can follow  
Waiting inside her eyes was my tomorrow  
Then something changed her mind her kisses told me  
I had no lovin arms to hold me  
  
Every day I wake up then I start to break up  
Lonely is a man without love  
Every day I start out then I cry my heart out  
Lonely is a man without love  
  
Every day I wake up then I start to break up  
Knowing that its cloudy above  
Every day I start out then I cry my heart out  
Lonely is a man without love  
  
I cannot face this world thats fallen down on me  
So if you see my girl please send her home to me  
Tell her about my heart thats slowly dying  
Say I cant stop myself from crying  
  
Every day I wake up then I start to break up  
Lonely is a man without love  
Every day I start out then I cry my heart out  
Lonely is a man without love  
  
Every day I wake up then I start to break up  
Knowing that its cloudy above  
Every day I start out then I cry my heart out  
Lonely is a man without love  
  
Every day I wake up then I start to break up  
Lonely is a man without love  
Every day I start out then I cry my heart out  
Lonely is a man without love
