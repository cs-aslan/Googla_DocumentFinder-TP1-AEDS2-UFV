Tell me anybody  
Now do you really give a damn for me  
I said tell me anybody  
Do you really give a damn for me  
  
Oh cause I just got to tell you  
About a thing thats bothering me  
I was a rambling pony  
I would roll I would roll  
I would roll from town to town  
I was a rambling pony  
I would roll from town to town  
  
Yes just looking for a sweet woman  
And making my love come on down  
  
If I need anybody  
Baby I would take you home with me  
If I need anybody  
Baby I would take you Baby I would take you  
Baby I would take you home with me  
Whoa but I dont need nobody  
I dont anybody but him and me  
  
And youre sitting there so green  
Believe me man Im just the same as you  
I said youre sitting there so green  
Believe me man Im just the same as you  
You want me to make a last cry Ill be satisfied  
And thats exactly what I mean to do
