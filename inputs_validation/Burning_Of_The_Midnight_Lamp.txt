The morning is dead  
And the day is too  
Theres not much left here to lead me  
But the velvet moon  
All my loneliness I have felt today  
Its a little more than enough  
To make a man throw himself away  
  
And I continue  
To burn the midnight lamp  
Alone  
  
Now the smiling portrait of you  
Is still hangin on my frowning wall  
It really doesnt really doesnt bother me too much at all  
Its just the ever falling dust  
That makes it so hard for me to see  
That forgotten earring layin on the floor  
Facing coldly towards the door  
  
I continue  
To burn the midnight lamp  
Lord alone  
  
Loneliness is such a drag  
  
So here I sit to pace  
That same old fire place  
Gettin ready for the same old explosion  
Goin through my mind  
And soon enough time will tell  
About the circus in the wishing well  
And someone who will buy and sell for me  
Someone to toll my bell  
  
And I continue  
To burn the some old lamp  
Lord alone  
Darlin cant ya hear me callin you  
So lonely  
Gotta blow my mind  
Lonely
