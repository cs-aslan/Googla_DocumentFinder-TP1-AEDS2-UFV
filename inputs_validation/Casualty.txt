Driving home I was miles away  
When I thought that I saw your face  
Late at night a lightning flash  
Put reality in its place  
I never saw the warning signs  
Til it was too late  
  
Im a casualty  
A victim of my own circumstance  
A casualty a hopeless case  
That never stood a chance at all  
  
I never knew what hit me  
Like somebody put out the light  
I was going crazy  
Couldnt tell if it was day or night  
I must have lost direction  
A simple hit and run  
  
Im a casualty  
A victim of my own circumstance  
A casualty a hopeless case  
That never stood a chance at all  
  
Out of control on a one way street  
Feeling myself beginning to slide  
Out of my head too blind to see  
That you were there just for the ride  
  
Living this life in tragedy  
Why did this happen to me  
  
Im a casualty  
A victim of my own circumstance  
A casualty a hopeless case  
That never stood a chance at all  
  
I never stood a chance  
Im a casualty  
Im a casualty  
Im a casualty
