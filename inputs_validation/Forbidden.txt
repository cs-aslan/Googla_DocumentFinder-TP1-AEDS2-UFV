If I had to live again Id change everything  
Cause everything I do you know that I cant win  
You say it isnt right but you say it isnt wrong  
How the hell am I supposed to please everyone  
  
Tell me what it is that Im supposed to do  
I aint here for everybody but I aint here for you  
You said it isnt right but you said it isnt wrong  
I wish somebody could tell me what it is that Ive done wrong  
  
The best things in live arent given these things aint for you and me  
Every time you shout forbidden makes me wonder what you see  
The best things in live arent given these things aint for you and me  
Every time you shout forbidden makes me wonder what you see  
  
You know its gonna get you now and you know it starts to bring you down  
  
Tell me what it is that Im supposed to do  
I aint here for everybody but I aint here for you  
It seems I have to fight for all the things I want  
Wish somebody could tell me what it is that Ive done wrong  
  
The best things in live arent given these things aint for you and me  
Every time you shout Forbidden makes me wonder what you see  
The best things in live arent given these things aint for you and me  
Every time you shout Forbidden makes me wonder what you see  
  
Its forbidden  
  
The best things in live arent given these things aint for you and me  
Every time you shout Forbidden makes me wonder what you see  
The best things in live arent given these things aint for you and me  
Every time you shout Forbidden makes me wonder what you see  
Makes me wonder what you see
