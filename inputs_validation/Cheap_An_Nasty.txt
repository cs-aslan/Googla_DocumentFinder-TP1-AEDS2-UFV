Come on baby  
  
I get so confused  
But my heart knows youre one of a kind  
Leather an lace an angels face  
Riding on a one track mind  
Youre fully loaded with cruise control  
My four wheels rock with your back seat roll  
  
Youre cheap an nasty  
All you want to do is give it up give it up  
Cheap an nasty  
Come on an do the dirty with me  
  
I get so excited babe when Im invited  
To ride in your limousine  
You drive it every day burn it every night  
I wonder how you keep it so clean  
Smooth accelerator you get me so loose  
You keep your motor running till I run out of juice  
  
Youre cheap an nasty  
All you want to do is give it up give it up  
Cheap an nasty  
Come on an do the dirty with me  
  
Cheap an nasty  
  
I never knew it could be this way  
An I never thought Id ever complain  
But gimme a second just to catch my breath  
Babe before you do it again  
  
All the boys call your name  
Down the wishing well  
Baby when you go  
Youre like a cat out of hell  
  
Youre cheap an nasty  
All you want to do is give it up give it up  
Cheap an nasty  
All you want to do is give it up give it up  
Cheap an nasty  
All you want to do is give it up give it up  
Cheap an nasty  
Come on an do the dirty with me  
  
Come on an do the dirty  
Come on an do the dirty  
Come on an do the dirty with me  
Come on an do the dirty with me
