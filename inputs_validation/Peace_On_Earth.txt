Heaven on earth  
We need it now  
Im sick of all of this  
Hanging around  
Sick of sorrow  
Sick of pain  
Sick of hearing again and again  
That theres gonna be  
Peace on earth  
  
Where I grew up  
There werent many trees  
Where there was wed tear them down  
And use them on our enemies  
They say that what you mock  
Will surely overtake you  
And you become a monster  
So the monster will not break you  
  
Its already gone too far  
Who said if you go in hard  
You wont get hurt  
  
Jesus could you take the time  
To throw a drowning man a line  
Peace on earth  
Tell the ones who hear no sound  
Whose sons are living in the ground  
Peace on earth  
No whos or whys  
Noone cries like a mother cries  
For peace on earth  
She never got to say goodbye  
To see the color in his eyes  
Now hes in the dirt  
Thats peace on earth  
  
Theyre reading names out over the radio  
All the folks the rest of us wont get to know  
Sean and Julia Gareth Ann and Brenda  
Their lives are bigger than any big idea  
  
Jesus could you take the time  
To throw a drowning man a line  
Peace on earth  
Tell the ones who hear no sound  
Whose sons are living in the ground  
Peace on earth  
  
Jesus this song you wrote  
The words are sticking in my throat  
Peace on earth  
Hear it every Christmas time  
But hope and history wont rhyme  
So whats it worth  
This peace on earth  
  
Peace on earth  
Peace on earth  
Peace on earth
