Hootie Hoo  
Follow the funk from the skunk  
And the dank that is crunk in the Dungeon  
It goes on and on and on like that  
Going out to the Jeeps and hoes in the llac  
Ah Suki Suki  
All day and day any day every damn day  
I be thinking about the good ol days when I was a whippersnapper  
Used to try to get a kiss but now it be them draws Im after  
Im just a Southernplayalistic pimp  
I used to sling a fat rock but now Im serving hemp  
I never even smoked a gram of crack but yo Im dope  
Mo doper than a junkie or a Pooky cause its on  
So each one teach one I be claiming true  
To East Point and College Park and the things I used to do  
Around ATL home of the pimps and the money makers  
Club niggas Magic City and them Southern players  
I never said I was a gangsta but I will do ya  
So Hallelujah Hallelujah  
One for the players at the crib drinking drinks  
And two is for the sound Hootie Hoo that I make  
  
Chorus  
Hootie Hoo  
Tight like hallways smoked out alwaysHootie Hoo  
Yeah Hootie Hoo  
Big Boi on the left Andres on my right  
Tight like hallways smoked out always Hootie Hoo  
  
Now playing these bitches is my favorite sport  
But aint no game when they be calling your name in the court  
Oh its Saturday night I guess that makes it alright  
Got an obese twenty sack fully packed its so tight  
That its busting out the seams yes sir Im set  
Oh but let me tuck the 380 before I jet  
Hops off in the Lac with Big Gipp you got a light Hootie Hoo  
Communication device dun went off twice  
Should I answer the call yes Im macking em all  
We met em up in the mall recall Players Ball  
Well its Players Ball 2 so I guess Ill call you  
Later on and then your whole crew can fall through  
Now later on done got here  
I takes a peek now let me see what do we got here  
Draws falling down like niggas in a driveby  
I got up in them draws and I told her bye bye  
About two weeks later she called me with some bullshit  
Talking bout her period late guess what I did  
Click  
No it couldnt be me Not me  
  
Chorus  
  
Uh well you know we getting blizzard cause we got that chicken gizzard  
In the dungeon and scope but some of you niggas cant cope with it  
So Opie hip hop to the front to the back and it dont stop  
From the streets of ATL to the slums of College Park  
So god almighty no its Outkast for the 94 era  
You heard the players call we taking it to another level  
So lujah Halle let me get a swallow of that Martel  
And you may go to hell  
  
Set sail with a nigga from ATL Southwest that is  
Its that Southern ses in your chest that is  
One mo gen for my friend who dont take  
No bullshit from no bitch who is stank  
I aint the sugar daddy nigga who will make you  
Silly of you to think that I would but I will lay you  
Down like some bolos you can throw those  
Head til Im dead yes its now your broke hoes  
Dont get me wrong to disrespect is not my shit  
But if you fall in this category then youse a bitch
