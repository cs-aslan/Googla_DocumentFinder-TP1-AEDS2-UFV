I was born to serve justice  
But I dont sermonize  
Good is good  
Bad is bad  
And I never compromise  
  
They lock me in a rocket  
Made of flesh and bone  
Ill meet you in the war zone  
With my fists of stone  
  
Im a super cop  
Im a super cop  
  
My bodys a machine  
Made to synchronize  
Every time Im called to action  
Make me recognize  
When the forces of corruption  
Do the tyrannize  
Then I shift to overdrive  
And start to pulverize  
  
Im a super cop  
  
Eliminate the foe  
With karate chops  
Im a super cop  
Im a super charged cop  
And I cant be stopped  
  
Im a super cop  
  
I was born to serve justice  
Get my name  
Im a super cop  
  
Kung fu action is my game  
Im a cop now  
A super cop now  
  
He drives around in a world turned upside down  
Im a cop now  
A super cop now  
  
Hes gotta round up all the evil clowns  
Im a cop now  
  
A super cop now  
  
What he sees just makes him want to cry  
Im a cop now  
A super cop now  
  
He works alone cause if he dont hell die  
  
spoken the truth and protect  
The motto I ascribe to  
With equal justice  
For the down and out or well to do  
Im a super cop  
A gangsters worst nightmare  
One man demolition team  
Ill send them into disrepair  
  
Hes been fighting  
Fighting for so long  
  
Im a super cop  
  
Hes been righting  
Righting every wrong  
  
Im a super cop  
  
Now hes hiding  
From the long arm of the law  
  
Im a cop now  
A super cop now  
He gets up and tries to save the world  
  
Im a cop now  
A super cop now  
He goes out and tries to find a girl  
  
Im a cop now  
A super cop now  
If youre a punk hell aim straight for your belt  
  
Im a cop now  
A super cop now  
He makes the news every time he kicks some butt  
  
Super cop  
Super cop  
Super cop  
Super cop
