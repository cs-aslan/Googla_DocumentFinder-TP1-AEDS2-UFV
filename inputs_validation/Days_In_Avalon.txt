Im nearing the end  
Or the beginning  
Whichever one finds me  
And Im counting the tears  
And the blessings  
That Ill leave behind me  
  
I could not ask for more  
You were the one thing worth livin for  
  
Chorus  
I will remember days in Avalon  
I will remember nights in your arms  
I will remember days in Avalon  
And I will recall every moment  
Of my days in the sun  
  
As I embrace the twilight  
The memories surround me  
I would have been lost  
Sure as the rain comes  
If you hadnt found me  
  
Each breath I breathe is for you  
I never knew how to live til you taught me to  
  
Chorus  
I will run through the door  
Im not afraid anymore  
And the light that I see is your eyes  
Once again Ill be whole  
I will live in your soul  
Longer than the rest of our lives  
  
Chorus
