I whispered you  
Words I thought Id never say  
We played the game  
But then we tossed the rules away  
Could deny it  
Justify it  
But we both know we went too far  
Oh I can feel you  
And I need you  
No matter wherever you are  
  
Chorus  
I dont want to watch my love come crashing down  
But I cant lie to my heart  
I dont really want your memory hangin round  
But baby I just cant lie to my heart  
  
I have loved you  
Longer than youve even known  
When you hurt I hurt  
Im your flesh and youre my bone  
If I could only  
Be two people  
Darlin I swear wed both be with you  
Oh I know Im selfish  
But Im helpless  
I want you and nothing else will do  
  
Chorus  
  
I wont pretend anymore  
Been hiding too long  
I wont go on like before  
Im not that strong  
I can feel it when Im near you  
Its not healthy to need you this way  
Try to fight it get inside it  
But this pain is stronger than me and it wont go away  
  
Chorus
