An afternoon of sad affairs  
Shared in the hope of mending broken dreams  
The constant struggle after simple pleasures  
Finds us perfect strangers you and I  
  
You know I hate to see you cry  
And through the tears that fall like winter rain  
You say youre tired of merely just surviving  
Weve so much in common that were  
  
Chorus  
Perfect strangers singing perfectly in tune  
From separate corners of the room  
Held together by our hunger to get by  
Perfect strangers you and I  
  
Lets make a toast to no regrets  
Wet down the painful sting of sweet love lost  
Let evening find us whispering in our whiskey  
Come and sit beside me for a while  
  
You know I love to see you smile  
And if perhaps youre only passing through  
At least we tried to reach an understanding  
And for just one moment we were  
  
Chorus x 2
