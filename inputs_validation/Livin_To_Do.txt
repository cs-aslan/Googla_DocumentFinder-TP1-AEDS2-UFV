A message comes down Its a warning  
Its not your time oh no it aint but its coming  
Now what makes us think were here forever  
When life is gone life is gone before you know its over  
  
A church in the raina sad congregation  
An old friend I knew  
When I look at the endI understand now  
I got livin to dotheres still livin to do  
  
With every breath comes deeper meaning  
I dont want to waste I dont want to waste one single minute  
Tears fall from the sky angles are cryin  
They cry for thosewho dont know that theyre dyin  
  
I wait for the suna chance at a new day  
Theres no time to lose  
When I look at the endI understand now  
I got lovin to dotheres still lovin to do  
When I look at the endI understand now  
I got lovin to do  
Whoa  
Theres still livin to do
