Ay can I talk to you for a minute

If you let me I will show you how I like what I see

Aint no way aint no way

The way girl the way you look to me now to me now

With jeans and a body that curves like you like you  
I dont really care what they say  
When it comes to a difference of age  
I can show you all the things Ill do  
Break your heart never raise my voice  
Girl let down your guard  
I know its a lot to ask trust in me  
But I can make a difference right now youll see

Cant you see what you holding me that does to me  
Every time you walk pass

Swervin in my 645 or SU me leanin over the seat  
Handin you your own set of keys showin you just how the team got you  
Trust and believe these words from me been said before

Cant nothin come about well take it slow
