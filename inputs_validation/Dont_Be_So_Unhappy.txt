Sadly thats how youre feeling  
Sorry my heart was deceiving  
I want you to know our time had its reason  
Long before my love was gone  
I felt that this would go wrong  
Chorus  
Dont be so unhappy  
Your life has just begun  
Dont be so unhappy  
There are wars that cant be won  
Daddy I gave you a hard time  
Forgive me for being so dumb deaf n blind  
Broke hurt hate habibi  
We cant erase cant rewind  
Long before my love was gone  
I felt that us would turn out wrong  
Chorus  
Long before my love was gone  
I felt that things would go wrong  
Chorus
