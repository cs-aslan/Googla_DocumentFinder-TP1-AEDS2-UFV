I took my baby on a river boat cruise  
And she was well aware  
I was excited about the way things could have been  
Cause in it I dont care  
I want a face no one can recognize in disguise  
Someone called out my name  
They thought of taking pictures autographs then they grab  
My joy has turned to pain  
  
Father always told me  
You wont live a quiet life  
If youre reaching for fortune and fame  
I feel the pressure setting in Im living just to win  
Im down in my pain dont you feel it  
Its the price of fame you pay the price of fame  
So dont be feelin no pain  
Its the price of fame its the price of fame  
So dont you ever complain  
  
Im on the cover of the magazine what a scene  
They know my every dos  
Just sign your name on the dotted line youll be fine   
That always bothers me  
Get in your car you wanna take a ride look behind  
Someone is following you  
You try to get away you turn real fast but too bad  
They know your every move  
  
My father always told me  
You wont live a quiet life  
If youre reaching for fortune and fame  
I feel the pressure setting in Im living just to win  
I bleed all this pain dont you ever complain  
  
Its the price of fame you pay the price of fame  
So dont you ever complain  
Its the price of fame you pay the price for fame  
So dont be feelin no pain  
  
Its the price of fame you pay the price of fame  
Father never lies my father never lies  
My father never lies  
So dont be feelin this way boy  
  
Id like to take some time and get away then theyll say  
Is that boy still alive  
The week in village what a thrill  
Only the strong survive  
  
My father always told me  
You wont live a quiet life  
They startin to wonderin where have you been  
I feel their envious looks at me  
Their mistaken jealousy  
Then stand here in my shoes  
And then get a taste of my blues  
  
Its the price of fame  
You pay the price of fame so dont you ever complain  
Its the price of fame  
You pay the price of fame  
So dont be feelin this way  
Its the price of fame  
You pay the price of fame so dont you ever complain  
  
Its the price of fame you pay the price of fame  
Father never lies my father never lies baby  
My father never lies  
So dont be feelin no pain boy
