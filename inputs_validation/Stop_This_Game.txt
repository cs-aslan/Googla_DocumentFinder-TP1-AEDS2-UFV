Well I cant stop the music  
I could stop it before  
Now I dont want to hear it  
Dont want to hear it no more  
No more  
  
I cant stop the music  
I could stop it before  
Now I dont want to hear it  
Dont want to hear it no more  
  
All I want to do is stop this game  
Its gonna really end  
Stop this game  
Its such a touchy touchy thing  
  
Hey livin with you  
Is all I wanted before  
Ive changed you didnt  
Dont want to see you no more  
  
All I want to do is stop this game  
Its gonna really end  
Oh stop this game  
Its such a touchy touchy thing  
  
Well we were walkin before we could crawl  
And you were lovin just emotion just all  
Its just emotion wasnt music at all  
Now I cant stop the music  
Now I dont want to hear it no more  
No more no more no more  
  
Stop this game  
Its gonna really end  
Stop this game  
Its such a touchy touchy thing  
  
I cant stop the music stop this game  
I could stop it before its gonna really end  
Now I dont want to hear it stop this game  
Dont want to hear it no more its such a touchy touchy thing
