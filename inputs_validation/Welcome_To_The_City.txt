Two dollar tips and the lipstick cigarettes  
Get yourself a job with your fingertips  
Too many tickets for the backseat matinee  
Two hours later and youre looking for another face  
Dont ask for love  
Dont ask for pity  
Dont ask for me  
Welcome to the city  
  
Four hundred dollars bus a room in the city  
With a whole lot of people and a hole in the ceiling  
Freeze in the winter die in the summer  
Seventeen kids next door without a mother  
Hey if you see me coming up the stairs  
Please dont confuse me with someone who cares  
  
Welcome to the city Im glad you made it baby  
Im really  
  
You got some letter its a recommendation  
Your best friends ex sent a copy to the station  
And he knows some agent through a distant relation  
An inside connection with a map and directions  
Ah too bad you came  
Too bad you waited  
Too bad for you  
Youre overeducated  
  
Welcome to the city Im glad you made it baby  
Im really glad  
  
Dont ask for love  
Dont ask for pity  
Dont ask for me  
Welcome to the city
