Upon this threshold of disaster  
The birth of the eleventh plague  
The fires burn at night I begin to doubt the smell of burning flesh will ever
fade away  
  
The touch of death is all around us  
A thousand corpses block our way  
A manmade germ makes almost everyone commit suicide just to rise and eat
their dead  
Night of the living dead  
  
Were hunting humans whaoooooo  
Were hunting humans whaoooooo  
Were hunting humans  whaooooo  
Were hunting humans  
Its killing time every day  
  
I cant control this eerie feeling  
An evil screaming in my head  
I dont think Ill last the night  
There is no cure for this genocide or resurrection of the dead  
Night of the living dead  
  
Were hunting humans whaoooooo  
Were hunting humans whaoooooo  
Were hunting humans  whaooooo  
Were hunting humans  
Its killing time every day
