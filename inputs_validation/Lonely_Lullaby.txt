Symphony of silver tears  
Sing to me and sooth the ring in my ears  
Overcast these gloomy nights wear on  
But Im holding fast because its darkest just before the dawn  
  
I sang my princess fast asleep  
Cause she was my dream come true  
Oh Annmarie believe me I loved you  
  
But now those lonely lullabies  
Just dampen my tired eyes  
Because I cant forget you  
Because I cant forget you  
  
Ill dissolve when the rain pours in  
When the nightmares take me  
I will scream with the howling wind  
Cause its a bitter world and Id rather dream  
  
Dizzy love turned a star lily pink  
And hung above our lids too flushed to blink  
But icy blue froze the fairytale cold  
Though I treasured you and you sparkled with someone to hold  
  
I sang my princess fast asleep  
Cause she was my dream come true  
Oh Annmarie believe me I loved you  
  
But now those lonely lullabies  
Just dampen my tired eyes  
Because I cant forget you  
Because I cant forget you  
  
Ill dissolve when the rain pours in  
When the nightmares take me  
I will scream with the howling wind  
Cause its a bitter world and Id rather dream  
  
Ill dissolve when the rain pours in  
When the nightmares take me  
I will scream with the howling wind  
Cause its a bitter world and Id rather dream  
And Id rather dream  
  
Annmarie Ill never forget you  
Annmarie Ill never forget you  
Annmarie remember me  
Ill never forget you  
Annmarie remember me  
Ill never forget you  
Annmarie remember me  
Ill never forget you
