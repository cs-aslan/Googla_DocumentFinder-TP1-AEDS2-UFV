A little piece of something  
Falling gently down down down  
No one understands you like I do  
  
Id rather be beside you  
Everything we know so well  
Tell me what you feel now  
Show me what you think of it  
  
Its not about us anymore  
Its all about the reasons  
That we think were fighting for  
Its not about hate  
Its not about pain we always feel  
I know we have our problems  
But were not the only ones  
Its not about you its not about me  
Its not about anger  
Its more about the loneliness we feel  
  
How can I begin to  
Ask for some forgiveness  
For all that we have taken  
Theres nothing left now  
  
Just a little piece of something  
Falling gently down down down  
No one understands you no no  
Like I do  
Theres nothing left now  
  
Its not about us anymore  
Its all about the reasons  
That we think were fighting for  
Its not about hate  
Its not about pain we always feel  
I know we have our problems  
But were not the only ones  
Its not about you its not about me  
Its not about anger  
Its more about the loneliness we feel  
  
Its not about us  
Its not about hate  
Its more about the loneliness we feel can you feel it  
Its not about anger  
Its not about wanting  
I know we have our problems  
But were not the only ones were not the only ones  
Its not about you its not about me
