The first Noel  
The angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds  
In fields as they lay  
  
In fields where they Lay  
Keeping their sheep  
On a cold winters night  
That was so deep  
  
They looked up  
And saw a star  
Shining bright in the east  
Beyond them far  
  
And to the earth  
It gave great light  
And so it continued  
Both day and night  
  
NoelNoel  
NoelNoel  
Born is the king of Israel
