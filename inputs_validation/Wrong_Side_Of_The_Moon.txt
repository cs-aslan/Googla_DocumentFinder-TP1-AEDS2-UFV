Across the ocean shes been waiting to hear  
If loves a secret to all the things she fears  
Was it tiptoe around my pillow talk  
Theyll come the only boy she had with any thought  
  
The heart pretends Im not so far away  
She said tomorrow and Im here today  
  
I miss her now and I say its only true  
I feel like Im on the wrong side of the moon  
Wrong side of the moon  
  
Im forgettin to remember to forget  
All the memories locked in my head  
Ill be home then youll hear what I say  
It seems forever started only yesterday  
My heart keeps time which passes very slow  
When youre lonely without a place to go  
Ive got the lonesome ocean blues  
I feel like Im on the wrong side of the moon  
Wrong side of the moon  
  
Across the ocean theres a heart that beats for me  
Beat beating waiting patiently  
Pulls us together when were apart  
Keeps the devil from playing with your heart  
But Ill pretend were not so far away  
Im home tomorrow or maybe its today  
Across the ocean theres nothing else to do  
It feels like youre on the wrong side of the moon  
Wrong side of the moon Wrong side of the moon  
Wrong side of the moonWrong side of the moon  
Wrong side of the moon  
Wrong side of the moon  
Wrong side of the moon  
Wrong side of the moon
