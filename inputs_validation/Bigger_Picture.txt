Im starting to see a bigger picture  
Im beginning to color it in  
Im starting to see a bigger picture  
Im beginning to color it in  
  
My soul the sky my heart a sun  
my mind a world  my only one  
My thoughts the people the world around  
My dreams the kings  or the clowns  
  
Im starting to see a bigger picture  
Im beginning to color it in  
Im starting to see a bigger picture  
Im beginning to color it in  
  
The continents and the seven oceans  
bound the range of my emotions  
My time is long but not forever  
My moods are the changing wind and weather  
  
Im starting to see a bigger picture  
Im beginning to color it in  
Im starting to see a bigger picture  
Im beginning to color it in  
  
Color it in   
Color it in
