Colored rubbers and a bedroom set  
I wouldnt know it if it hit me  
You take a little step and then it feels like love  
I think I better get a little of it in me  
Give me a kiss  
I think it feels like love  
Give me a kiss  
I think it feels like sunshine  
Cmon baby light me up  
I wanna look into your eyes until I go blind and  
  
Chorus  
You think that you can do without me  
I cant do anything at all  
You think that you can do without me  
But I dont believe in Sundays  
And I dont believe in anything at all  
  
Your mother make you in a parking lot  
My mother made me out of flesh and wire  
Try to remember what you might forget  
I try to remember everything  
Try to remember so you dont disappear  
Try to remember so you dont fade away  
Your mother made you out of smoke and rain  
Your mother made you in a fire thats faded  
  
Chorus  
  
I wanna touch you for the things Im losing  
I wanna touch you for my selfrespect  
Give me a reason or I might stop breathing  
Give me a reason why Im soaking wet  
Gotta stop breathing cause the sky is falling  
I might go out and watch the moon explode  
Give me directions to the highway crossing  
Ill go lie down in the middle of the road  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont believe in Sundays  
And I dont believe in anything at all  
I dont believe in anything at all
