Hold hands with the person to your right  
Hold hands and try to look sincereo  
Tell them though you dont know their name  
That you still can feel their pain  
Yeah you still can feel their pain  
Well sing Jerusalem now boys  
As we build a land fit for zeros  
Its all that I can do to stop  
Fake tears from welling up  
Fake tears from welling up  
  
If you thought this was your country  
You can just forget it  
Youre too old youre too poor  
Youre too posh  
Youll never get in here wearing that my dear  
  
Dont smoke dont smack  
Dont eat red meat  
This is a tolerant land fit for zeros  
And if youre lost just hear my call  
Mediocrity is all Mediocrity is all  
  
If you thought this was your country  
You can just forget it  
Youre too old youre too poor  
Youre too posh  
Youll never get in here wearing that my dear  
  
The past is all forgotten now  
This is a young modern land  
Fit for zeros  
And if we fight its only when  
Were guaranteed to win  
And should you just stray  
Just hear my call  
Mediocrity is all  
Mediocrity is all
