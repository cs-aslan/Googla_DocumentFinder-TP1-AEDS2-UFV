Tell me what do people do  
When there aint nothin to do  
When theres nobody else around to do  
Nothin with or to  
Have you ever been in that position in a small town motel room  
Where the diners all close at nine  
And the trucks keep a rollin by  
And you just cant get to sleep  
Even though theres nothin on your mind  
  
Tell me what do people say  
When there aint nothin to say  
When theres nobody else around to help you pass the time of day  
Have you ever stared at the ceiling  
Till you thought youd lose your mind  
Looked for a wall that you could climb  
Still you just cant get to sleep  
Even tho theres nothin on your mind  
  
Have you ever been stuck in a small town motel  
Lookin all around but there aint nothin to see  
In a never endin mind bendin troublin position  
Sayin why did it happen to me  
  
Tell me what do people do  
When there aint nothin to do  
When theres nobody else around to do  
Nothin with or to  
Have you ever been in that position in a small town motel room  
Where the diners all close at nine  
And the trucks keep a rollin by  
And you just cant get to sleep  
Even though theres nothin on your mind  
  
Tell me what do people do  
When there aint nothin to do  
When theres nobody else around to do  
Nothin with or to  
Hope you never in that position in a small town motel room  
Where the diners all close at nine  
And the trucks keep a rollin by  
Till you just cant get to sleep  
Even though theres nothin on your mind
