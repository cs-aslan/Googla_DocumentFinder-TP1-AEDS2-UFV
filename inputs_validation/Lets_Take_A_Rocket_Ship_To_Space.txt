Lets take a rocket ship to space  
I hear its a real swinging place  
There isnt much air or gravity there  
The stars will make your heart race  
  
Lets take a rocket  
Lets take a rocket  
Lets take a rocket ship to space  
  
Lets take a saucer to the stars  
Look out moon move over Mars  
The Martians all rock  
To Bassie and Bach  
So bring your maracas and your jazz guitars  
Lets take a saucer to the stars  
  
Instrumental interlude  
  
Lets take a rocket  
A crazy kind of rocket  
Lets take a rocket ship to space  
Voiceover Its the final frontier baby
