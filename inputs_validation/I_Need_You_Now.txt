Why did you go  
Why did you run away  
Is there someting I can do  
Im standing here  
Oh I dont know what to say  
Feeling helpless without you  
  
I dont care what you said and what youve done  
For me youre still the one  
Refrain  
I need you now  
Its the only thing that you should know  
Heres my declaration  
I need you now  
Searching for you wherever you go  
Looking for salvation  
I need you now  
I hear your voice  
When Im so alone at night  
Want to hold you in my arms  
I see your eyes  
Shining so warm and bright  
Wanna fall into your charms  
I dont care what you said and what youve done  
For me youre still the one  
Refrain I need you now  
Its the only thing that you should know  
Heres my declaration  
I need you now  
Searching for you wherever you go  
Looking for salvation  
I need you now  
Bridge  
Oh I need you here and now  
Need to get to you somehow  
Tell the world that I will show my love to you
