Yeah isnt it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack
communication  
How beautiful our kids will be girl I dont need convincing  
How every conversation starts with this time will be different oh  
Oh the ideas fun  
Oh the ideas fun  
Oh the idea is so fun every time  
At least we try for home run every time  
  
Swangin eyes closed just swangin  
Same city same friends if youre looking for me  
Same city same friends if youre looking  
Ill be here just swangin  
Dont talk to me like Im famous  
And dont assume cause I dont expect assumptions babe  
Im just tryna connect with somethin babe yeah swangin eh  
  
She just wanna run around the city and make memories that she can barely
remember  
And Id allow her talk about pussy power  
Yea she just wanna run over my feelings  
Like she drinkin and drivin in an 18 wheeler and Id allow her  
Talk about pussy power  
She used to say You can be whoever you want even yourself  
Yeah I show up knowin exactly who I was and never leave as myself  
But when it falls apart Im always still down  
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground  
Cause you would learn to love people and use things and not the other way
around  
  
Swangin eyes closed just swangin  
Same city same friends if youre looking for me  
Same city same friends if youre looking  
Ill be here just swangin eh  
Dont talk to me like Im famous eh  
And dont assume cause I dont expect assumptions babe  
Im just tryna connect with somethin babe Ill be here just swangin  
  
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is  
She call and tell me be here before the sun up I be dressed before we hung up  
I take Eglinton to 401 east and  
Exit at Markham road in the east end  
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping  
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend  
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends  
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness  
I hate stoppin for gas this late cause this niggas creepin and I like how
were creepin  
Summer is comin know you could feel it  
20 on pump whatever I aint got enough to fill it  
Wont knock on your door  
My uncle say You drive my whip like its yours  
I got the pedal to the floor  
Im on my motherfuckin way swangin  
  
Dont fall asleep on me hang in there  
Ill be there just swangin

I treat you good girl like youre famous

But dont fall asleep on me hang in there  
Im on the road right now swangin girl
