The way you work day out and day in  
And still find time for us too  
  
I love the fact that youre there for me when I feel down  
No matter what Im going through  
Lately Ive been questioning myself  
Am I good enough for you  
  
Am I worthy of  
Am I man enough  
Am I strong enough  
To maintain this love  
You got me questioning  
Got me wondering  
Could I be that man  
That can keep you happy  
  
I know that therell be times when Ill be miles away  
And youll be all alone  
I constantly fight my insecurities  
When I cant reach you by phone  
And oh lord knows that Im only human  
So please forgive me if I ask so many silly questions  
I know that you truly love me  
But fear has me second guessing

To maintain this love  
You got me questioning  
Got me wondering  
Could I be that man  
That can keep you happy
