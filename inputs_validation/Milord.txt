Raise the window  
Its getting hot in here  
All these breathers  
And all of these suckers  
Shake my hand now  
Pleased to meet you but  
Skin is pretty  
But underneath youre a monster  
Are we friends now  
Am I your brother  
Can we bleed together  
Are we lovers  
Lets sew our pants together  
1 2 3 4 5  
Lets climb right in forever  
6 7 8 9 10  
Then wont we all be so clever  
If we sew our pants together  
Wake the next morning  
One below the waist  
But you want poached eggs  
And I want to go to the bathroom  
What do we do now  
What do we make of this  
Can my blood flow  
Apart from your stitch  
Lets sew our pants together  
1 2 3 4 5  
Lets climb right in forever  
6 7 8 9 10  
Then wont we all be so clever  
If we sew our pants together  
Lets set our hair on fire  
Lets throw our hearts in the mire  
Lets sell our eggs to any buyer  
Weve made a liar of desire  
Lets sew our pants together  
Lets sew our pants together  
Weve made a liar of desire  
Weve made a liar of desire  
Weve made a liar of desire  
Weve made a liar of desire
