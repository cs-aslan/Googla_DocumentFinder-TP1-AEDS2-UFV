A bowling wind is whistling in the night  
My dog is growling in the dark  
Somethings pulling me outside  
To ride around in circles  
I know that you have got the time  
Coz anything I want you do  
Youll take a ride through the strangers  
Who dont understand how to feel  
In the deathcar were alive  
In the deathcar were alive  
  
Ill let some air come in the window  
Kind of wakes me up a little  
I dont turn on the radio  
Coz they play shit like You know  
When your hand was down on my dick  
It felt quite amazing  
And now that that is all over  
All weve got is the silence  
In the deathcar were alive  
In the deathcar were alive  
So come on mandolins play  
  
When I touched you  
I felt that you still had your baby fat  
And a little taste of babys breath  
Makes me forget about death  
At your age youre still joking  
It aint time yet for the choking  
So now we can own the movie and see each other truly  
In the deathcar were alive  
In the deathcar were alive  
I want to ear some mandolins
