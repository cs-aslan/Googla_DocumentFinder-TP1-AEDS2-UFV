Georgia I love your big magnolia trees Texas I love to feel the prairie breeze  
Tennessee you made me what I am today but its got to be Kentucky for me  
She loves me and she knows where I am Kentucky you are my motherland  
Say hello to the rivers and the trees oh its got to be Kentucky for me  
 guitar   
New York thats a fine place to go Colorado my its pretty covered with the
snow  
California sunshine just brings me to my knees oh but its got to be Kentucky
for me  
My flesh and my blood is buried there I believe that Jesus blessed the briar  
Big world I have seen your majesty but its got to be Kentucky for me  
Oh its got to be Kentucky for me
