Sometimes I wonder if everything changed  
How could we make out  
And now suddenly thunder and everythings changed  
Theres this big dark cloud  
Hovering  
  
Hovering hovering hovering  
You always said that wed make it through  
Troubling stumbling fumbling  
For the words to say that Im leaving you  
Im leaving you  
  
We go through the motions like everythings settled  
But its inside out  
And it makes us uncomfortable still holding on  
When theres all this doubt  
Hovering  
  
Hovering hovering hovering  
You always said that wed make it through  
Troubling stumbling fumbling  
For the words to say that Im leaving you  
Im leaving you  
  
And maybe were just older  
Just a little older  
cause the fact that this is over  
The fact that this is over with yous been  
  
Hovering stumbling fumbling  
For the words to say that Im leaving you  
Im leaving you  
  
You always said wed make it through  
You always said wed make it through
