A pocketful of hearts ababy you collect em  
A pocketful of hearts and then you go and wreck em  
A pocketful of hearts cause you just neglect em  
For a love thats new  
A pocketful of hearts crazy how you get em  
A pocketful of hearts alove em and forget em  
A pocketful of hearts ababy you condemn em  
One more fool me too  
Play with fire and youll get burned  
The storys always true  
You never dreamed a heart like yours  
Could ever be so blue  
A pocketful of hearts one is gonna haunt you  
A pocketful of hearts one is gonna taunt you  
A pocketful of hearts when he doesnt want you  
Youll be cryin too
