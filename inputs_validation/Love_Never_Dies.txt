You say you saw the dark side  
Baby I know  
It Gets you through the night  
And love is like a red rose baby and so  
Its coming around again  
If we can take the same direction well find  
The road that never ends  
But love never dies  
It goes on forever love never dies  
Love never dies it goes on forever  
This is the love youve been talking about  
You led her in till she couldnt get out  
You made the little girl cry  
No sad stories to deny  
I go through holy war for you baby you know  
You say you aint got a prayer  
Ill answer if you call for me  
Baby Im yours  
To God above I swear  
I only wanna live in the shadow you make  
The soul never lies  
But love never dies it goes on forever  
Love never dies love never dies  
It goes on forever  
You better run to the heart of the flame  
She dont change like the sun in the rain  
She dont understand why  
You made the little girl cry  
Love never dies it goes on forever love never dies  
Love never dies it goes on forever  
this is the love youve been talking about  
You led her in till she couldnt get out  
You made the little girl cry  
No sad stories to deny  
You better run to the heart of the flame  
She dont change like the sun in the rain  
She dont understand why  
You made the little girl cry  
repeat fade
