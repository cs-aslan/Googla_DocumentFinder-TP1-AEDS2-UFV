You cant fuck with the criminal rapping over gangsta shit  
First I load the clip and then I make the hit  
I know some yall cant fade this  
Lench Mob niggas are the craziest  
So you and your boys are ass out  
When Im rollin in a seven deuce glass house  
The Mob aint nothing but a menace  
When we get the motherfucking dog in us  
Playing them old beats  
Im pouring out some of my beer for my homies  
Ready to peel your cap  
You cant believe Faces of Death on wax  
Some say the Mob aint positive  
Man fuck that shit cause I gots to live  
How I live and you could either give a fuck punk  
Yo or get your ass bucked  
Some rappers are heavensent  
But SelfDestruction dont pay the fucking rent  
So you can either sell dope or get your ass a job  
Id rather roll it wit the Lench Mob  
  
To be down with the Mob is simple  
Mind your own you want a spot find your own  
And take mine if youre badder than the strong man  
I do the right thing I do the wrong thing  
Do anything cause I aint faking the scene  
Its all about how much bacon you bring  
And if you see something from the gat I will stuff it  
Yo you aint seen nothing  
Cause if you testify youre living blind  
Cause in the city you live and let die  
Rolling with the fools One Time cant beat  
On my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet  
He said I know you I said you might  
My name is Ice Cube I did a song you didnt like  
So he soaked me up like Bounty  
Had to do a week in the county  
A piece of cake it was just like a party  
Cause in the county you know everybody  
No I didnt kill or steal or rob  
Locked up for what cause Im rollin wit the Lench Mob  
  
If you know a female thats rollin with the Lench Mob  
Watch your step cause the gat is kept  
In the purse like my homegirl YoYo  
You gotta be down and you cant be a hoe no  
Cause if you are Ill be the first one to bust you out  
After my crew Ill be the first one to rush you out  
Get the picture or bitch  
Youll get the eightysix  
If she want to try and mix  
Business and pleasure make up your own mind  
You gotta be a hoe on your own time  
Dont sleep cause even on a solo creep  
Yo the Mob is still deep  
And well play ya just like a nitwit  
You thought you got with the crew you cant get with  
So get the noose ready for the lynching  
Now 235 is what Im benching  
But nowadays its still not enough  
I got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush  
Give me the gat step back and watch me do the job  
Rolling with the motherfucking Lench Mob
