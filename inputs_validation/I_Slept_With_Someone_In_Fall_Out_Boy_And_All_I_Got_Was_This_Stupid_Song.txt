I found the cure to growing older  
And youre the only place that feels like home  
Just so you know youll never know  
And some secrets werent meant to be told  
I found the cure to growing older  
  
Im the first kid to write of hearts lies and friends  
And I am sorry my conscience called in sick again  
And Ive got arrogance down to a science  
Oh and Im the first kid to write of hearts lies and friends  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
Douse yourself in cheap perfume its  
So fitting so fitting of the way you are  
You cant cover it up  
Cant cover it up  
  
Find a safe place brace yourself bite your lip  
Im sending your fingernails and empty bottles youve sipped  
Back to your family cause I know you will be missed  
So you can find a safe place brace yourself  
  
They call kids like us vicious and carved out of stone  
But for what weve become we just feel more alone  
Always weigh what Ive got against what I left  
So progress report I am missing you to death  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
Someone old  
No one new  
Feeling borrowed  
Always blue  
Someone old  
No one new  
Feeling borrowed  
Always blue  
Someone old  
No one new  
Feeling borrowed  
Always blue  
Someone old  
No one new  
Always borrowed  
Always you  
  
I found a cure to growing older  
I found a cure to growing older  
  
ChorusRepeat x2
