Many nights Ive stood here by this window  
Wondering if Id always be alone  
No one here to share this lonely bedroom  
But that was long before she came along  
  
Heaven only knows shes not an angel  
But I was blessed the day she came to me  
And when I close my eyes and lay beside her  
Ill swear I can almost hear her wings  
  
I never stopped to watch an evening sunset  
Or tired to count the stars up in the sky  
I never knew the world held so much beauty  
Until I saw it through my babys eyes  
  
Heaven only knows shes not an angel  
But I was blessed the day she came to me  
And when I close my eyes and lay beside her  
Ill swear I can almost hear her wings  
  
And when I close my eyes and lay beside her  
Ill swear I can almost hear her wings
