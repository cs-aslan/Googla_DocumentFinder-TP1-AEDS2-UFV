Turn up the bass turn up the treble  
Im about to take you to a whole other level  
Dj turn off what youre playing  
I want the whole club to hear what Im saying  
Because this girl means too much to me  
And now were on the floor and shes touching me  
And if I wanna take her home  
Its gonna be better than what they do on the radio  
  
Its gotta be the crunkest  
Its gotta be the loudest  
Its gotta be the best song she ever heard  
I gotta tell her how I feel  
I gotta let her hear the best song she ever heard  
Dont need for me to write it  
I just gotta picture her smiling  
And if you feel that way go ahead and kiss your baby  
And now weve got the whole stadium in love  
  
Turn up the lights give me a mic  
Im about to sing and do it just as she likes  
Jump of the stage crowd surfing all the way  
You know its right just do the wave  
Girl just move your body like a snake  
And if you wanna get with me  
Put your hands in the air show me that energy  
  
Its gotta be the crunkest  
Its gotta be the loudest  
Its gotta be the best song she ever heard  
I gotta tell her how I feel  
I gotta let her hear the best song she ever heard  
Dont need for me to write it  
I just gotta picture her smiling  
And if you feel that way go ahead and kiss your baby  
Now weve got the whole stadium in love like eh eh  
  
Homie kiss your girl  
Shwaty kiss your man  
We can see you on the kissing  
Now show me some love  
Show me some love  
Now look her in the eye see baby I love you  
I never put no one above you  
And if you feel that way  
Go ahead and kiss your baby  
And now weve got the whole stadium in love like eh eh   
And if you feel that way  
Go ahead and kiss your baby  
And now weve got the whole stadium in love like eh eh   
Eh eh eh eh  
Oh oh oh
