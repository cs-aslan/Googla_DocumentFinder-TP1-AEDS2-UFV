Javert and constables break up the fight  
Valjean picks himself up and looks for Cosette who is with Marius  
  
Javert  
Another brawl in the square  
Another stink in the air  
Was there a witness to this  
Well let him speak to Javert  
Msieur the streets are not safe  
But let these vermin beware  
Well see that justice is done  
  
Look upon this fine collection  
Crawled from underneath a stone  
This swarm of worms and maggots  
Could have picked you to the bone  
I know this man over here  
I know his name and his trade  
And on your witness Msieur  
Well see him suitably paid  
  
Valjean and Cosette have disappeared  
  
But wheres the gentleman gone  
And why on earth did he run  
  
Thenardier  
You will have a job to catch him  
Hes the one you should arrest  
No more bourgeois when you scratch him  
Than that brand upon his chest  
  
The constables search for Valjean  
  
Javert  
Could it be hes some old jailbird  
That the tide now washes in  
Heard my name and started running  
Had the brand upon his skin  
And the girl who stood beside him  
When I turned they both had gone  
Could he be the man Ive hunted  
Could it be hes Jean Valjean  
  
Thenardier  
In the absence of a victim  
Dear Inspector may I go  
And remember when youve nicked him  
It was me who told you so  
  
Javert  
Let the old man keep on running  
I will run him off his feet  
  
Everyone about your business  
Clear this garbage off the street
