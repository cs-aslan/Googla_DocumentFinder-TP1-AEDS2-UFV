You say youre a minute from the deep end  
You cut cold the courtesy its sink or swim now  
and your bodys aching for a breath Ill give it to you  
With a trap door to take in of all of this  
  
Come away come away now  
You wont stand from a fall  
Hear me say it  
Come away come away now  
Cause your too close to me to come  
  
Ive seen the foolish shame the ways  
You just kept crying with his own surprises  
And your Trojan horse is big enough to save them all  
And youre not a foolish one at all  
  
Come away come away now  
You wont stand from a fall  
Can you hear me say it  
Come away come away now  
Cause your too close to me to come  
  
Yes youre too close  
  
Lost the feeling you know  
Youre the victim of  
Kick start the clothes let it go  
You dont need them  
Only flesh blood and bones Im the same old guy  
  
If I were to know today  
  
Come away come away now  
You wont stand from a fall  
Hear me say it  
Come away come away now  
Cause your too close now  
  
Ooh ooh  
Come away  
Oh
