There are times when Ive wondered  
And times when Ive cried  
When my prayers they were answered  
At times when Ive lied  
But if you asked me a question  
Would I tell you truth  
Now theres something to bet on  
Youve got nothing to lose  
  
When Ive sat by the window  
And gazed at the rain  
With an ache in my heart  
But never feeling the pain  
And if you would tell me  
Just what my life means  
Walking a long road  
Never reaching the end  
  
God give me the answer to my life  
God give me the answer to my dreams  
God give me the answer to my prayers  
God give me the answer to my being
