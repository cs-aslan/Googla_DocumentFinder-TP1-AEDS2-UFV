The finer feelings the finer feelings  
  
You cant give to me  
Anything  
I couldnt get for myself  
I have needs as much as any man  
And I understand the feelings well  
  
I can still have a true heart  
With a free mind  
A good life  
With a good time  
  
Chorus  
But what is love  
Without the finer feelings  
Its just sex  
Without the sexual healing  
Passion dies  
Without some tender meanings  
It aint love  
Without the finer feelings  
  
I get passionate  
Just like you  
But I have a little selfcontrol  
You just show your selfish attitude  
Your emotion leaves me cold  
  
I can still have a true heart  
With a free mind  
A good life  
With a good time  
  
Chorus  
  
The finer the finer  
The finer feelings  
  
I can still have a true heart it aint love  
With a free mind it aint love  
A good life  
With a good time feelings  
  
Chorus
