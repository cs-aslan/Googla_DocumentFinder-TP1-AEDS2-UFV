Well theres something about  
Watching a crime  
That makes me want to go out  
And make it all mine  
Theres something about  
Seeing your face  
That makes me want to go out  
Tonight  
I got a bad disease  
I got a bad disease  
To fall into  
Yeah its true  
Theres something about  
Seeing him die  
That puts it all into perspective and I  
Want to stay home  
Be Left alone  
Someone make my mind up  
So I dont have to decide  
I got a bad disease  
I got a bad disease  
To fall into  
Yeah I do  
Theres some reason why  
I cant sit still  
Every waking moment  
  
I feel so unfulfilled  
I try to lie down  
But I dont know how  
Baby when Im sleeping  
It feels less like I am dreaming  
Oh my god  
I got a bad disease  
I got a bad disease  
Its got me down  
On my knees  
Theres a fear I have  
A feeling real bad  
Im fine now if I find out that Im not  
Ill be sad  
I try to quiet  
Thoughts in the night  
Oh they got me thinking  
Ill be happier just drinking  
Its not true  
I got a bad disease  
I got a bad disease  
Its got me down  
On my knees  
I got a bad disease  
Will no one help me please  
Not even you
