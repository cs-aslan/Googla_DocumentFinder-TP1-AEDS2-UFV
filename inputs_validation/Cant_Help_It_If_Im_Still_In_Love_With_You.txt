Today I passed you on the street  
And my heart fell at your feet  
An I cant help it if Im still in love with you  
Somebody else stood by your side  
And he looked so satisfied  
An I cant help it if Im still in love with you  
  
A picture from the past came slowly stealing  
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you  
An suddenly I got that old time feeling  
An I cant help it if Im still in love with you  
  
Its hard to know anothers lips will kiss you  
And hold you just the way I used to do  
Heaven only knows how much I miss you  
I cant help it if Im still in love with you  
  
An I cant help it if Im still in love with you
