I believed in fairy tales  
In magic spells and wishing wells  
And pirate sails  
And once I thought Id never fall in love  
That shows how much I knew  
I believed in Superman  
In Santa Claus the world of Oz  
And wonderland  
But one by one those fantasies have failed  
While you keep shining through  
I still believe in you  
  
I could never doubt your kiss  
No other love  
Fills me like this  
If you take a chance youll see  
I believe in you  
Believe in me  
  
Other dreams may turn to dust  
But I dont care  
If youll be there  
Ill always trust  
Cause I believe with all my heart and soul  
This dream we share is true  
I still believe in you
