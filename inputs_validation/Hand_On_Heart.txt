All eyes were staring  
You floated through the room  
Armed with your razor smile  
Cutting to the bone  
My voice fell useless  
You flashed a quick hello  
Feeling the fool  
Could you tell it showed  
  
But that was sometime ago  
A memory vague and fading slow  
Of somewhere Id been  
  
Hand on heart  
A promise a word and a voice  
Hand on heart  
A rhythm of hope and choice will keep us together  
  
I dont know if I  
Can reach that high  
Its a long way to fall  
Hauntingly holding  
My fate with a gaze  
Like a child mesmerized  
By the candles flame  
Oh what lies behind those eyes  
I could only guess  
That certain way you stood  
Apart from the rest  
  
Now where is sometime ago  
When everything moved in slomotion  
Caught by my watering eye  
  
Hand on heart  
A promise a word and a voice  
Hand on heart  
A rhythm of hope and a vision of choice  
Hand on heart  
Promising Ill never go  
Hand on heart  
For reasons youll never know  
  
Together through thick and thin  
Lose or win Ill be there for you  
Strange how the mind changes  
Time and time again  
Things once important now  
Pale in comparison  
  
Hand on heart  
A promise a word and a voice  
Hand on heart  
A rhythm of hope and a vision of choice  
Hand on heart  
Promising Ill never go  
Hand on heart  
For reasons youll never know  
  
I promise girl hand on heart
