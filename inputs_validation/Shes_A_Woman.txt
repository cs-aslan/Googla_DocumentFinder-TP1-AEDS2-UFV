She got everything I need  
She makes me smile she makes me bleed  
Cause shes a woman  
  
She got the end she got the means  
Shes in my heart and in my dreams  
An it makes me cry I want to make her mine  
  
She aint black but she got soul  
She aint young she aint old  
She shine like silver burn like gold  
Cause shes a woman shes a woman  
  
She got everything I need  
She got comfort she got speed  
Shes a woman shes a woman  
  
She do me bad she do me good  
She got the Gypsy in her blood  
Cause shes a woman shes a woman  
  
She aint black but she got soul  
She aint young she aint old  
Shine like silver burn like gold  
Shes a woman shes a woman  
  
She got a fire in her eyes  
I know she sees through all my lies  
Cause shes a woman shes a woman  
  
I know Im the danger zone  
If I leave her all alone  
Cause shes a woman shes a woman  
  
She aint black but she got soul  
She aint young she aint old  
Shine like silver burn like gold  
Shes a woman woman  
Shes a woman shes a woman  
  
Shes a woman woman  
Shes a woman  
  
She got everything I need  
She make me smile she make me bleed  
Shes a woman shes a woman  
  
She got the end she got the means  
She make me shiver in my jeans  
Cause shes a woman shes a woman  
  
She aint black but she got soul  
She aint young she aint old  
She shine like silver burn like gold  
Cause shes a woman shes a woman
