Shes got a way about her  
I dont know what it is  
But I know that I cant live without her  
Shes got a way of pleasin  
I dont know what it is  
But there doesnt have to be a reason  
Anyway  
  
Shes got a smile that heals me  
I dont know why it is  
But I have to laugh when she reveals me  
Shes got a way of talkin  
I dont know what it is  
But it lifts me up when we are walkin  
Anywhere  
  
She comes to me when Im feelin down  
Inspires me without a sound  
She touches me and I get turned around  
Shes got a way of showin  
How I make her feel  
And I find the strength to keep on goin  
Shes got a light around her  
And everywhere she goes  
A million dreams of love surround her  
Everywhere  
  
She comes to me when Im feelin down  
Inspires me without a sound  
She touches me and I get turned around  
Shes got a smile that heals me  
I dont know why it is  
But I have to laugh when she reveals me  
Shes got a way about her  
I dont know what it is  
But I know that I cant live without her  
Anyway
