I should have stolen every moment  
Now theres a page with not enough on it  
Where we belong  
I guess Ill never understand it  
Why do we take it all for granted  
Until its gone  
Cause then its gone  
  
Love who you love  
With all that you have  
And dont waste the time that flies so fast  
Love who you love  
And say that you do  
Hold on as tight as theyll let you  
Love who you love  
  
Give all ya got like its your last day  
Your heart and soul before its too late  
And pull em in  
So close enough that they can feel it  
With every single breath that youre breathin  
Breathe it in again and again  
  
Chorus  
Love who you love  
With all that you have  
And dont waste the time that flies so fast  
Love who you love  
And say that you do  
Hold on as tight as theyll let you  
  
Hold on hold on  
Love who you love  
Say that you do  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Love who you love  
Love who you love  
Love who you love  
  
Hold on keep on holding on  
Yeah with every single breath youre breathing  
  
Love who you love  
Love who you love  
Again and again and again and again
