Why dont you just give in  
Just like a Siamese twin  
I mean to stick to you  
Until you do  
I wont take it on the chin  
Youll never leave me flat  
Im not a last years hat  
That you can cast aside  
Ive got my pride  
And I wont stand for that  
You cant brush me off  
As you would a speck of powder you may try  
But you cant brush me off  
You cant shout me down  
You can yell but Ill yell louder you can try  
But you cant brush me off  
You can say youre out but Ill keep phoning  
You can tell me goodbye  
You can tell me but I  
Wont go  
No  
You cant leave me cold  
As you would a plate of chowder you may try  
But you cant brush me off

What is this all about  
Youve got me wrong no doubt  
I give you all my time  
Believe me Im  
Not looking for some way out  
I want you for my wife  
Sharing my care and strife  
And that may not be fun  
For when its done  
Youre stuck with me for life  
You cant brush me off  
As you would a fresh mosquito you may try  
But you cant brush me off  
You cant rub me out  
Like a spot on my tuxedo you may try  
But you cant brush me off  
You can cut me dead but I wont mind it  
You may injure my pride  
Still Ill never decide  
To go  
No  
You cant drop me fast  
As you would a live torpedo you may try  
But you cant brush me off  
3  
You cant brush me off  
Like a colored pullman porter you may try  
But you cant brush me off  
You cant lock me out  
Like a frightened farmers daughter you may try  
But you cant brush me off  
You can drop a hint but I wont take it  
You can tell me bad news  
I intend to refuse  
To go  
No  
You cant give me back  
As you would a leaded quarter you may try  
But you cant brush me off
