Hot town summer in the city  
Back of my neck gettin dirty n gritty  
Been down isnt it a pity  
Doesnt seem to be a shadow in the city  
All around people lookin half dead  
Walking on the sidewalk hotter than a match head  
But at night its a different world  
Go out and find a girl  
Come on come on and dance all night  
Despite the heat itll be alright  
Babe dont you know its a pity  
The days cant be like the nights  
In the summer in the city  
In the summer in the city  
Cool town evening in the city  
Dressed so fine and looking so pretty  
Cool cat looking for a kitty  
Gonna look in every corner of the city  
Till Im wheezing like a bus stop  
Runnin upstairs sayin meet you on the roof top  
But at night its a different world  
Go out and find a girl  
Come on come on and dance all night  
Despite the heat itll be alright  
Babe dont you know its a pity  
And the days cant be like the nights  
In the summer in the city  
In the summer in the city  
Hot town summer in the city  
Back of my neck gettin dirty n gritty  
Been down isnt it a pity  
But doesnt seem to be a shadow in the city  
All around people lookin half dead  
Walking on the sidewalk hotter than a match head  
But at night its a different world  
Go out and find a girl  
Come on come on and dance all night  
Despite the heat itll be alright  
Babe dont you know its a pity  
The days cant be like the nights  
In the summer in the city  
In the summer in the city  
Hot city  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
In the city
