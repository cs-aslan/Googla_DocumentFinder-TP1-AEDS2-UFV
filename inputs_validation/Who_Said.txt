Im more than just your average girl  
I like to turn me up and show the world  
Aw yeah  
Cause some can talk the talk  
But this girl just wants to rock  
Im individual  
Im not like anyone  
  
I can be glamorous  
Just like you see in all the magazines  
I can be cool as ice  
Or anything I wanna be  
Wooo  
  
Who said who said  
I cant be Superman  
I say I say  
That I know I can  
Who said who said  
I wont be president  
I say I say  
You aint seen nothin yet  
  
Oh yeah  
Yeah  
Go on and make some noise  
Every girl has her choice  
To lead their own parade  
I do it my way  
Ow  
  
I can be soft and sweet  
Or louder than the radio  
I can be sophisticated  
Or totally go outta control  
Wooo  
  
Who said who said  
I cant be Superman  
I say I say  
That I know I can  
Who said who said  
Im not electrified  
I say I say  
  
Theres no holdin back  
Stayin right on track  
Cause you control the game  
So let em know your name  
No limitations on imagination  
Imagine that  
Yeah  
  
Who said who said  
I cant be worldwide  
I say I say  
Time is on my side  
  
Who said who said  
I cant be 10 feet tall  
I say I say  
That I can have it all  
  
Who said who said  
I cant be Superman  
I say I say  
That I know I can  
Who said who said  
I wont be president  
I say I say  
You aint seen nothin yet  
You aint seen nothin yet  
Whoa  
Yeah  
Who said  
Cmon  
Yeah  
Thats right
