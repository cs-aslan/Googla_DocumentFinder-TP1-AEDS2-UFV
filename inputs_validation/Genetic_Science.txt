Youve got a diamond ring  
Its just another hollow thing  
Youve got your career  
You chose boredom over fear  
Youve got a righteous cause  
All I see are fatal flaws  
All I see are fatal flaws  
  
youve got the newest style  
It wont be new in a little while  
Youve got the future too  
I dont mind leaving that to you  
Youve got plans and goals  
All I see is full of holes  
All I see is full of holes  
  
youve got the human race  
Youve got Jesus just in case  
Youve got your eternity  
A few short years is enough for me  
Ive got my defiance  
Youve got your genetic science  
Youve got your genetic science
