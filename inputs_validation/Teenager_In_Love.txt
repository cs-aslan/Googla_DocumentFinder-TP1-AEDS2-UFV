Each time we have a quarrel  
It almost breaks my heart  
Cause Im so afraid  
That we will have to part  
Each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
One day I feel so happy  
Next day I feel so sad  
I guess Ill learn to take  
The good with the bad  
Cause each night  
I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
I cried a tear for nobody but you  
Ill be a lonely one  
If you should say were through  
Well if you want to make me cry  
That wont be so hard to do  
If you should say goodbye  
Ill still go on loving you  
Each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
I cried a tear for nobody but you  
Ill be a lonely one  
If you should say were through  
Well if you want to make me cry  
That wont be so hard to do  
And if you should say goodbye  
Ill still go on loving you  
Each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
Why must I be a teenager in love
