Here I sit all by myself  
Wonderin how she could put our love on a shelf  
A crowd of people they pass me by  
But all I can do is hang my head and cry  
  
Chorus  
Blame it on a sad song in the night  
I dont want anyone but you to make it right  
Blame it on a sad song in the night  
Well its an old familiar feelin  
Girl its got my heart reelin  
Dont want to hear a sad song in the night  
Anymore  
  
I know when we first started out  
I was your only love and you had no doubt  
But songs of the heart dont last forever  
But dont you give up on love cause you never say never  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause not a day goes by that I dont think about you  
Oh moment to moment I get lost in time  
And many years from now when I hear that song come on the radio  
All those feelings will come back to haunt me  
My heart will let me know  
  
Chorus  
  
Blame it on a sad song  
You can blame it on a sad song baby  
Blame it on blame it on a sad song
