I start to part to halves of  
My heart in the dark and I  
Dont know where I should go and  
The tears and fears begin to multiply  
  
Take a time in a simple place  
On my bed where my head rests on a pillow case  
And its said that a war s led but I forget that  
I let another day go by  
  
I want to be afraid  
But it seems that these days  
Im caught under water  
And Im falling farther  
My heart s getting harder  
Im calling my Father  
Am I screaming to an empty sky  
  
Empty sky no way thats me  
Cause one half of my heart is free  
Empty sky no way thats me  
Cause the other half of my hearts asleep  
  
Chorus  
Sing a song but dont believe  
Blasphemy is just for me  
Hypocrite take your pick  
Cause the poison s on my lips  
Can I understand you 4x  
End Chorus  
  
Lights camera action  
Satisfaction at your fingertips  
No ones lacking stuff  
But its not enough when it seems  
We have enough stuff just to blow stuff up  
  
Lights camera stop  
Were killing ourselves  
Just to get to the top  
And we wont stop talking about what we got  
And how we all love it when were loved a lot  
  
Enough about you lets talk about me  
And everybody thinks Im just so free  
Free Did you hear the verse that came first  
And how my whole body s waging a war on me  
  
I bet you didnt know something thats absurd  
Theres a word Ive said more than any other word  
Its sorry Im sorry  
And I pray that the word was heard  
  
Chorus  
  
I want to be alive  
When you see my eyes  
Can I see your eyes  
  
Can I see your eyes 5x  
  
I want to be alive  
When you see my eyes  
Can I see your eyes  
Can I see your eyes  
  
Let the water  
Wash away  
Everything that youve become  
On your knees  
Today is gone  
And tomorrow is sure to come  
  
Tomorrow is sure to come
