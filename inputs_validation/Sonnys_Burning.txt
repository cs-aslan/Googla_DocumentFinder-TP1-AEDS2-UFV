Have you heard how Sonnys burning  
Like some bright erotic star  
And He lights up the proceedings  
And raises the temperature  
Flame on Flame on  
  
  
Now Ive seen to Sonnys burning  
Someday I think Ill cut him down  
But it can get so cold in here  
And he gives off such an evil heat  
Flame on Flame on  
Hail my incubatic incubator  
  
  
Now pay witness to Sonnys burning  
Warming the damp and rotten seed  
Warming the damp and rotten seed  
That blooms into the DEMON FLOWER  
Now both fire and flowers consume me  
Flame on Flame on  
  
  
Evil heat is running through me  
Flame on Flame on  
Sonnys burning pits into me  
Flame on Flame on  
Sonnys burning holes into me  
Dont interrupt Dont interrupt  
Flame on Flame on
