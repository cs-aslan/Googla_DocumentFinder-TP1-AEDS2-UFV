Uptown girl  
Shes been living in her uptown world  
I bet she never had a back street guy  
I bet her mama never told her why  
  
Im gonna try for an uptown girl  
Shes been living in her white bread world  
As long as anyone with hot blood can  
And now shes looking for a downtown man  
Thats what I am  
  
And when she knows what  
She wants from her time  
And when she wakes up  
And makes up her mind  
  
Shell see Im not so tough  
Just because  
Im in love with an uptown girl  
You know Ive seen her in her uptown world  
Shes getting tired of her high class toys  
And all her presents from her uptown boys  
Shes got a choice  
  
Uptown girl  
You know I cant afford to buy her pearls  
But maybe someday when my ship comes in  
Shell understand what kind of guy Ive been  
And then Ill win  
  
And when shes walking  
Shes looking so fine  
And when shes talking  
Shell say that shes mine  
  
Shell say Im not so tough  
Just because  
Im in love  
With and uptown girl  
Shes been living in her white bread world  
As long as anyone with hot blood can  
And now shes looking for a downtown man  
Thats what I am  
  
Uptown girl  
Shes my uptown girl  
You know Im in love  
With an uptown girl  
  
My uptown girl  
You know Im in love  
With an uptown girl  
She my uptown girl  
You know Im in love  
With an uptown girl  
My uptown girl
