Wear something warm when its wet  
Oh I know you hate to be told  
Im so afraid youll forget  
You know how easy you catch cold  
Dont stay out late at a party  
You feel bad next day when you do  
And leave on a light when youre home alone at night  
I still care what happens to you  
I guess I shouldnt be concerned  
I guess I still havent learned  
I cant worry about you after all were through  
But I still care what happens to you  
I still care what happens to you
