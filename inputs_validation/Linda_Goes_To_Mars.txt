I just found out yesterday that linda goes to mars  
Every time I sit and look at pictures of used cars  
Shell turn on her radio and sit down in her chair  
And look at me across the room as if I wasnt there  
Chorus  
Oh my stars my lindas gone to mars  
Well I wish she wouldnt leave me here alone  
Oh my stars my lindas gone to mars  
Well I wonder if shed bring me something home  
Something somewhere somehow took my linda by the hand  
And secretly decoded our sacred wedding band  
For when the moon shines down up on our happy humble home  
Her inner space gets tortured by some outer space unknown  
Repeat chorus  
Now I aint seen no saucers cept the ones upon the shelf  
And if I ever seen one Id keep it to myself  
For if theres life out there somewhere beyond this life on earth  
Then linda must have gone out there and got her moneys worth  
Repeat chorus  
Yeah I wonder if shed bring me something home
