Right from the sky we are born crazy  
Right from the sky we are born to be wild  
Right from the sky we are born crazy  
Right from the sky we are born to be alive  
  
Day by day same of story  
Same of life starts to get boring  
Always working always strained  
Gotta be quick cause I cant be late  
Always moving in one direction  
Searching for this thing   
Cant get lost gotta be on the track  
When you move ahead you can never look back  
Then time is come when you gotta break free  
To make the choice to be wild to be happy  
How fun And dont let your mind go flat  
Thats  and thats what is said  
Grab it taste it hold it make it  
Dont think about the chance just take it  
Life is short no time to be lazy  
Get on your feet its time to get crazy  
  
Dont walk that we walk like this  
Break the rules I know you wont miss  
Just be crazy just be wild  
Just be free like an innocent child  
Show the world you dont give a damn  
Dont let society ruin your plans  
Dont be afraid to say what you feel  
Take a little break forget that its real  
Let the masses go their own way  
You go your way Ill go my way  
Let your mind control your movement  
Who cares that theres no room for improvement  
Jump shout dance scream  
Activate you act in your dreams  
Remember this when it all seems hazy  
Get on your feet its time to get crazy
