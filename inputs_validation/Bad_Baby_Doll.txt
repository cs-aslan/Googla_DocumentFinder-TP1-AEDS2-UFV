I had a heartache I cried a tear  
There was a girl I met she doesnt care  
Oh bad baby doll whats wrong with you  
Why did you leave this way  
When you tore the love we shared I cried  
When you told me that you love me oh you lied  
Well Im findin out again into love I shouldnt fall  
Oh whywhywhy oh my baby doll  
  
Sometimes I sit around Im feelin all alone  
I try to call you but you wont pick up that phone  
Ooh bad baby doll look what you do I cant go on this way  
Why cant we get together to explain  
Just why Ive left you standin in the rain  
Well Im findin out again into love I shouldnt fall  
Oh whywhywhy oh my baby doll
