Dreamer why dont you think like everybody else  
People dont you care bout what they say  
Deceivers they break you down and make you pay  
Brothers they dont understand any word you say  
  
All your life you are fighting  
Theyre trying to force you in  
  
When the time has come  
Youll not be alone  
Cause walls broke down  
Theyll see they were wrong  
When the time has come  
Therell be more of you  
With all their strength  
Youll show them the truth  
  
Mistreaters they dont care but fear your will  
Sisters they dont understand any word you say  
  
All your life you are fighting  
Theyre trying to force you in  
  
When the time has come  
Youll not be alone  
Cause walls broke down  
Theyll see they were wrong  
When the time has come  
You aint no fool  
Cause walls broke down  
They stop being cruel  
When the time has come  
Therell be more of you  
With all their strength  
Youll show them the truth  
  
Dreamer why cant you be like everybody else
