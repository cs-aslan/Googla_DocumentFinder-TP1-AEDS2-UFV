weve got a lot of questions  
weve got a lot to learn  
so tired of solving problems  
too many bridges burned  
we see it all so clearly and still we close our eyes  
why should we understand it  
what good is knowing why  
I know that life can be filled with these changes  
I know theres times when it feels like Im falling  
I know something in my life will change again  
  
now Ive got a lot of questions  
Ive got a lot to learn  
Im tired of solving problems  
too many bridges burned  
I cant change whats in the past  
I want to move ahead  
I want to understand it  
give me the reason why  
  
Im tired of running these circles in my life  
Ive seen the future it changes before my eyes  
and I know that there is something thats going to change in my life  
I know my life will change again
