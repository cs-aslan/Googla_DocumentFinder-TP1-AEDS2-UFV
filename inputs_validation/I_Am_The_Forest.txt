Ill always be with you for as long as you please  
For I am the forest but you are the trees  
Im empty without you so come grow within me  
For I am the forest and you are the trees  
And the heavens need romance so love never dies  
Youll be the stars dear and Ill be the sky  
And should any of this find us let them all be forewarned  
That you are the thunder and I am the storm  
And Ill always be with you for as long as you please  
For I am the forest and you are the trees  
Ill always be with you for as long as you please  
For I am the forest but you are the trees  
  
Ill always be with you for as long as you please  
For I am the forest but you are the trees
