Little girl youre so fine  
With that body you gotta be mine  
Was a brownie and I was a scout  
Baby I never knew how you shook it about  
Do me a good deed give me what I need  
If you move like that Ill give you whats in store  
You wont come back asking me for more  
IIToo hot aint slept so well  
Young boys troubles arent doing me well  
Give me your kisses every night  
I want to shake you and hold you tight  
I want to shake  
  
Since I met you I aint slept so well  
Young boy trouble arent doing me well  
Give me your kisses every night  
I want to shake you and hold you tight  
Come on and shake ah shake
