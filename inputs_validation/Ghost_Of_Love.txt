When you look in my eyes you know that Im gonna lie  
But you look in my eyes for the ghost of love that died  
And when you see him you should believe him  
He wont deceive you Hes never Leavin  
I used to feel the way hes feelin  
  
Before I fell for you I thought love was just a rage  
But we left the book of love signed in blood on every page  
They say it makes you feel so alive  
But thats the biggest of all the lies  
For every sting part of you dies  
  
So look into my eyes for the ghost of love that died  
I dont believe in second chance  
Coz thats not love thats just romance  
And I know the endin well in advance  
  
So look into my eyes for the ghost of love that died
