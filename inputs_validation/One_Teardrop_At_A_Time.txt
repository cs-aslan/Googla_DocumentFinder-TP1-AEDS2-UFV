One teardrop one teardrop  
I know that Ive cried a lot today and my hearts gonna hurt the same old way  
Cause Im losin the love I thought was mine  
The heartaches brought one teardrop at a time  
One teardrop at a time keeps telling me that wont be long until youll be
leaving me  
When you go Im gonna cry one more time  
Ill take back my heart one teardrop at a time  
No matter how many tears I cried that old familiar feeling stays inside  
My heart for you wont leave just in time  
Ill cry you from my heart one teardrop at a time  
One teardrop at a time
