I told my girl byebye bye  
And I really didnt mean it  
Said I met somebody new so fine fine  
And I really didnt mean it  
  
Out of my head to say the things I said  
I didnt mean a word  
Think jealousy just took a hold of me  
I hope shell ignore the things she heard  
No doubt about it My heart is in her hands  
With every moment Im waiting for a second chance  
Maybe an angel Will come and help her see  
I cant face the world if she dont love me  
  
I told my girl byebye bye  
And I really didnt mean it  
Said I met somebody new so fine fine  
And I really didnt mean it  
When I walked away I cried cried  
And I really didnt mean it  
So she took me back cause she knew I I  
Really didnt mean it  
  
Dear one from me take my apology  
I need you back  
I promise I know o never let you go  
Is there a chance to see you baby  
They talk about all the love that we still share  
From her emotion I barely miss your happiness  
Youre missing and mourning the way it used to be  
I know its true but I dont believe

I want you back Im gonna be a little smarter  
I want you back Im gonna try a little harder  
Shes good Shes fine and always on my mind  
I know our love will stand the test of time  
Shes my girl and my best friend  
And I really didnt mean it  
Her love is love so fine and so for real  
I want the world to know the way I feel
