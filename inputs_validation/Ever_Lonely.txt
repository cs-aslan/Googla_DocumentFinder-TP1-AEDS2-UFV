Chorus  
If youre ever lonely you can call on me  
Ill be here for you all youve got to do is call  
Im always waiting here for you  
All youve got to do is keep on trying till your call gets through  
  
For so many years I have been your friend  
And weve through everything time and time again  
But I want you to know that I still believe in you  
All youve got to do is keep on trying till your call gets through  
  
Youve gotta keep trying even though the road gets hard  
Youve gotta keep going on even though he broke your heart  
And if you ever need a friend I will be here for you  
All youve got to do is keep on trying till your call gets through  
  
Chorus
