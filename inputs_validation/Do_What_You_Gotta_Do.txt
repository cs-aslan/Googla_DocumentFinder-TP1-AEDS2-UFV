Sometimes youve got to take the heat  
If youre gonna walk down the mean street  
Take the heat and you see it through  
Cause sometimes it comes down to  
Do what you gotta do  
Sometimes it goes right down to the wire  
And you might have to walk through the fire  
Walk on boy all the way through  
Sometimes it just comes down to  
Do what you gotta do  
Well theres people thatll tell you  
Its just no use  
And theres people thatll tell you  
That youre gonna lose  
People thatll tell you  
Anything youre gonna listen to  
Do what you gotta do  
Someday theyre going to call your name  
Theyll come looking for some one to blame  
Whats your name boy  
Hey you just tell them true  
Cause they cant take the truth from you  
So do what you gotta do  
Well theyll call you a hero or a traitor  
But youll find out that sooner or later  
Nobody in this world is gonna do it for you  
Do what you gotta do  
There aint nobody in this world  
Thats gonna do it for you  
Do what you gotta do
