Im sweatin bullets for breakfast  
Slipping outta my range  
Another night on a meat hook  
Just tryin to pickle my brain  
Why the hell are you running  
And what are you standing for  
A lightweight with the baggage  
Slung out the door  
  
So roll us on up in shrinkwrap  
It sounds like a good place to hide  
Cause heads an tails its a night on  
Well be there til the end of the line  
  
I asked out the back  
To find a word in a cloud  
Told me something that I already knew  
Now if youre waiting for luck  
To come and touch you up  
You better wear yourself a goodlookin suit  
Dont you come around asking  
Cause I aint got an answerin mind  
Im gonna get real damn familiar  
With something with ice  
  
So set us on up in the corner  
And throw over that bottle o wine  
Cause heads and tails its a night on  
Well be there till the end of the line  
Well be there till the end of the line  
Well be there till the end of the line  
Dont expect us now to understand  
Or trust in the way that it feels  
Chasin up the coins into the ocean  
And choppin up the carriages to fight the locomotion alright  
  
I had a win in Kansas  
A birthday in North Albany  
The most ungrateful tourist  
You ever dragged an old friend to see  
  
Kick out the jams it aint no fuckin exam
