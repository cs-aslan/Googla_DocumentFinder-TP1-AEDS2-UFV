Every single night when I go down to the west coast  
The people seem dead like Im dancing with their ghost  
Nothing in this world keeps me more on my feet  
Than your sweet lovin oooh your lovin  
  
What happened to days when you were mine  
The way you looked so God damned fine  
Guess Ill be alone this summertime  
  
Cause Im a sad girl dancing on my own  
Long way far away from home  
Some day I will find you in the sunset  
Im a sad girl searching for a dream  
Just know that were on each others team  
Some day I will find you you bet  
But now youve left me  
Singing this sweet song  
Hold me never held me for too long  
Love me your love was porous like a rock  
Maybe you just forgot  
That I loved you
