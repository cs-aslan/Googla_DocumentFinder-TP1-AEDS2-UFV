Ive got ripplin water to wake me  
To the mornin my woman and love  
Tall pine trees are pointin us easily to heaven above  
Blue spruce clinin to the grade in the evening  
They take the chill away fine  
Cut the telephone line and the storys the same  
  
Theres a worn red chair by the window  
That we found at a sale down the way  
When some old women said that they  
Needed more room for the winter  
People like pullin at the stuffin when they sit down  
It helps passin the time  
Cut the telephone line and the storys the same  
  
And oh like a bubble on a windy day  
I start to flutter when I hear you say  
That you feel to good to go away  
And you make me feel fine  
And you make my world a warmer place  
By the sparklin of your diamond face  
On a frayed spot put a little lace  
And you make me feel fine  
Warm as the mountain sunshine  
On the edge of the snow line  
In a meadow of columbine  
  
Oh little Jennifer Id give a penny for  
What you got on your mind  
Seems like most of the time youre lyin there dreamin  
Maybe in your visions youve seen how omniscient is  
Slightly less than divine  
Cut the telephone line and the storys the same  
  
Ripplin waters flowin through the pipes  
In the walls that are keepin me warm  
The closest Ive been to my family for days is my music  
Silently starin at the mornin sky  
Its just like hearin her callin my name  
Cut the telephone line and the story might change  
  
And oh like a bubble on a windy day  
I start to flutter when I hear you say  
That you feel to good to go away  
And you make me feel fine  
And you make my world
