It starts feeling now  
It makes no inference of difference  
It still wont see its his  
Faint from lack of air  
It makes a whistle with a twistle  
But no one can hear  
I didnt stay long  
I had to go away to stay  
As long as I could  
So Im happy here  
Cause here is where the heart is  
I know you think that too  
Into another  
You and me  
Am I dead  
Sleep in Harlows bed  
Into another  
You and me  
Am I dead  
Sleep in Harlows bed  
Listening to our tune  
With headphone and volume on  
I can read your lips  
And in a clinical term  
I hear it said  
Everything is beautiful but nothing hurt  
Into another  
You and me  
Am I dead  
Sleep in Harlows bed  
Into another  
You and me  
Am I dead  
Sleep in Harlows bed
