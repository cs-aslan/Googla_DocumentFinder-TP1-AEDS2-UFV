Yeah this is a story of a famous dog  
Of a dog that chases its tail will be dizzy  
Met her snake ass at a barbecue bash  
She had a lot of ass and a twenty dollar stash  
Of some of that superb erb  
She said I got the chronic so fuck whatcha heard  
Ice Cube do you wanna hit this  
This shit is hype sho you right  
Soon as she passed me the J and a lighter  
Me and this hoodrat bitch got tighter  
Talkin all day on the blanket  
With her ass jacked up beggin me to spank it  
Lookin like a host from the Barbary coast  
Nigga dont wanna get burnt like toast  
Whassup wit deez nuts in ya meouth

Took her to the six dollar hole in the wall  
And I like how shes holdin the balls  
Gobble gobble from the incision  
Stuff that bitch and it aint Thanksgiving  
Didnt even have to fuck all night long  
Take me home damn its on  
Jumped out the cover snatched off the rubber  
Met the hoes mother yo whassup

Not just knee deep she was OG deep  
When she did the freak with me  
Yeah this is a story of a famous dog  
Of a dog that chases its tail will be dizzy  
I bumped this hoe on the danceflo  
Where you wanna go She said I dont know  
I thought I had a treat in the passenger seat  
Now her ass wanna get somethin to eat  
From where She said Dennys I figure  
I said hell naw cause they dont like niggaz  
Lets go to my house and order Dominos  
And maybe I can get the bitch out her clothes  
Got to the panties her ass started fightin  
And Im thinkin bout my dog Mike Tyson  
Took her ass home all alone  
Whoaoh there go the phone

And your man dont know youre gettin fucked by a thug

Doin what the fuck you wanna do  
And its cool cause you got a purse full of rubbers

Of a dog that chases its tail will be dizzy
