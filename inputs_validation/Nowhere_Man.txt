Hes a real nowhere man  
Sitting in his nowhere land  
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody  
  
Doesnt have a point of view  
Knows not where hes going to  
Isnt he a bit like you and me  
Nowhere man please listen  
You dont know what youre missing  
Nowhere man The world is at your command  
  
Hes as blind as he can be  
Just sees what he wants to see  
Nowhere man can you see me at all  
Nowhere man dont worry  
Take your time dont hurry  
Leave it all till somebody else  
Lends you a hand  
Ah la la la la  
  
Doesnt have a point of view  
Knows not where hes going to  
Isnt he a bit like you and me  
Nowhere man please listen  
You dont know what youre missing  
Nowhere man The world is at your command  
Ah la la la la  
  
Hes a real nowhere man  
Sitting in his nowhere land  
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody  
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody  
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
