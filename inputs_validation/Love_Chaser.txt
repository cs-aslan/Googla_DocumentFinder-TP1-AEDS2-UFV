Someones at your door tonight  
Someone wants your love  
Is it real or just imagination  
You decide to wait inside til the break of dawn  
In dreams you see yourself seeking affection  
  
Hell know just who you are  
Hell know just where youve been  
Hell know just what to do  
  
Love chaser  If you look deep in his eyes  
Then youre in for a big surprise  
He can take your breath away  
Theres nothing you can do or say  
  
You can feel that someones at your back  
You can hear his pounding heart  
But something tells you not to be afraid  
Cause even in the darkest night  
Someones at your side  
But when morning comes it all starts to fade away
