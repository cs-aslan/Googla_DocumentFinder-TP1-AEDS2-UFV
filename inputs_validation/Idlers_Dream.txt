My heart it skips a beat when I behold  
The light thats shining through your eyes of gold  
From heavenly blood you seem to spring  
From heavenly waters you can drink  
  
Ill meet you on a day that never ends  
Ill greet you in a way that heaven meant  
You lay me down gently on the leaves  
You cover me over in my sleep  
  
I never did say that I wish I could  
I never could pray cause its just no good  
I hope you dont break my heart of stone  
I dont want to scream out loud  
  
And wake up on my own  
And as I close my eyes  
And the sky turns red  
I realize just what you are  
  
Youre an idlers dream  
And youre singing ShangriLa  
  
ShangriLa  
ShangriLa  
ShangriLa
