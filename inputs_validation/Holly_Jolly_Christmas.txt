Have a holly jolly Christmas  
Its the best time of the year  
I dont know if therell be snow  
But have a cup of cheer  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And when you walk down the street  
Say hello to friends you know  
And everyone you meet  
  
Oh ho the mistletoe  
Is hung where you can see  
Somebody waits for you  
Kiss her once for me  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And in case you didnt hear  
Oh by golly have a holly jolly Christmas this year  
  
Oh ho the mistletoe  
Is hung where you can see  
Somebody waits for you  
Kiss her once for me  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And in case you didnt hear  
Oh by golly have a holly jolly Christmas this year
