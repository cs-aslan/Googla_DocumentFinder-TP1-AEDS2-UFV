Hear the voice of experience  
A word from the wise  
Grab opportunity  
While youre alive  
  
Cause if you follow the crowd  
Cause if you act like a coward  
Youll end up yelling out loud  
  
Hold back  
Youll regret it someday  
Choke on that  
Dont let it pass you by  
Hold back  
You better seize the hour  
  
You look in your history books  
You delve in the past  
Stalin and Roosevelt  
Both took their chances  
And George grasped the nettle  
Its do or dare  
From the banks of the Delaware  
  
Yeah dont hold back  
Trust your gut reaction  
Be bold be bold baby  
If you dont take chances  
You wont make advances  
Hold back yeah  
  
Dont matter if you aint so good looking  
If you aint sharp as a blade  
Dont be afraid  
Dont hold back  
  
Life is passing you by  
Choke on that  
Keep on moving keep on moving  
Gotta run with the crowd  
  
Youll end up in the madhouse  
Shouting the cold walls down  
Yeah dont hold back  
  
Hold back  
Youre messing with your life  
Hold back  
Yeah life goes by fast sometimes  
  
Be bold be bold be bold be bold baby  
Youre wasting your time  
I want your attention  
So pin back your ears  
  
Ive been climbing this tree of promises  
For over forty years  
Your vision get broken  
And bust on the ground  
So watch me watch me rebound  
  
Yeah dont hold back  
Youre wrecking your life  
Choke on that  
Dont hold back  
No dont hold back  
Youre messing with your life
