Well I dont know why I was dreaming about you  
But I do know that I was dancing without you  
Then you smiled and I was lost  
You fall in love why count the cost  
  
All I gave to you  
All you made me do  
I react when I hear people ask  
  
Chorus  
Was it worth it  
Yes its worth living for  
Was it worth it  
Yes its worth giving more  
  
If Id had my way this would have happened much sooner  
But until that day it was only a rumour  
All at once you changed my life  
And led me in to paradise  
  
Where I had to do  
What I wanted to  
I react when I hear people ask  
  
Chorus  
  
I reserve the right to live  
My life this way and I dont give  
A damn when I hear people say  
Ill pay the price that others pay  
  
Because its worth it  
Yes its worth living for  
Because its worth it  
Yes its worth living for  
  
All I gave to you  
All you made me do  
I react when I hear people ask  
  
Chorus  
  
And I reserve what  
The right to live where  
My life this way how  
I couldnt give  
A damn when I what  
Hear people say who  
Ill pay the price  
That others pay  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont know why  
I never thought Id fall in love  
I dont know why  
I dont know why  
I never thought Id fall in love  
I dont know why  
I dont know why
