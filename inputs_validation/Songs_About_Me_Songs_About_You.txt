You can move it on down the highway  
You can turn another page  
And when you finally get to the old folks home you can finally act your age  
I can make a million dollars  
And you can spend it as fast as it comes  
And you can sit there and cry on a bed full of lies  
And be thinking that you got you some  
  
Theyll be songs about me  
Theyll be songs about you  
Theyll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Because I aint wrote no songs like that yet  
No I aint wrote no songs like that yet  
  
You can hear me on the radio  
You can see me on TV  
Youll have to dig you a hole just to find your soul  
And get you a word from me  
You can run as fast as a hour glass  
You can fly as high as the wind  
You can be as strong for as long as you like  
But youll end up right back where you been  
  
Theyll be songs about me  
Theyll be songs about you  
Theyll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Because I aint wrote no songs like that yet  
No I aint wrote no songs like that yet  
  
I got a song for every occasion  
I been told I got a way with words  
I been told Id be loved forever  
I been sold on the lies that I heard  
I been bold in my days  
Been gold in my ways  
Been packed up and rolled out  
And thrown out the way  
I belong to a song for as long as I say  
But Ill always have a song to play  
  
Theyll be songs about me  
Theyll be songs about you  
Theyll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Cause I aint wrote no songs like that yet  
  
Theyll be songs about me  
Theyll be songs about you  
Theyll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Cause I aint wrote no songs like that yet  
  
No I aint wrote no songs like that yet  
No I aint wrote no songs like that yet  
Baby I aint wrote no songs like that yet  
No I aint wrote no songs like that yet  
No I aint wrote no songs like that yet  
No I aint wrote no songs like that yet  
No I aint wrote no songs like that yet  
Baby I aint wrote no songs like that yet
