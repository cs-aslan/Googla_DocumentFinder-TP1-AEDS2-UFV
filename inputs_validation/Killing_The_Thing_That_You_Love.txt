Brick by brick you built a mansion  
Piece by piece it seems  
Youre tearing it down  
  
Once you walked so tall and handsome  
Now nobody even wants you around  
Now youre just some kind of  
Leftover clown  
Now youre like Quasi Modo crying  
  
As you look in the mirror  
At what youve become  
Killing the thing that you love  
Like Lennons assassin  
Lennons assassin  
  
Reaching for Venus De Milo  
But shes never gonna hold you tight  
You plant plutonium silos  
Then you blister from the sun thats too bright  
Like a vampire stepping into the light  
Just a victim of your own greed as you  
  
Look in the mirror  
At what youve become  
Killing the world that you love  
Like Lennons assassin  
Lennons assassin  
  
The genius of a generation  
Blown away just like a leaf on the wind  
And now youre looking for salvation  
But you cant forget the places youve been  
And you cant erase a lifetime of sin  
And you cant escape the answers as you  
  
Look in the mirror  
At what youve become  
Dredging the river for what you have done  
Killing the thing that you love  
Like Lennons assassin  
Lennons assassin
