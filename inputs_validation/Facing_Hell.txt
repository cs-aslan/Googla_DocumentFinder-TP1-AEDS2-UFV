You make promise of protection  
To a future after life  
To the final resurrection  
And to eternal paradise  
  
But then Im blinded with temptation  
And to every mortal sin  
Is it God that sits there waiting  
Or will the darkness suck me in  
  
Lets wake up the dead  
Oh yeah  
Its better that never you know  
More tears are shed  
Oh yeah  
Im praying that youll never know  
That Im facing hell  
  
Oh the children sit and listen  
The belief was in their eyes  
In a land without tomorrows  
Through the night you hear their cries  
  
But then your eyes just skip the pages  
Of a book that never ends  
Is it God that sits there waiting  
Do you hear the call again  
  
Lets wake up the dead  
Oh yeah  
Its better that never you know  
More tears are shed  
Oh yeah  
Im praying that youll never know  
That Im facing hell  
  
Its just crazy world we live in  
And Im out of my mind  
You pray tomorrow but your leaving today  
Evil one is coming and hes knocking your door  
Cause todays the day youll pay  
  
Lets wake up the dead  
Oh yeah  
Its better that never you know  
More tears are shed  
Oh yeah  
Im praying that youll never know  
  
Lets wake up the dead  
Oh yeah  
Its better that never you know  
More tears are shed  
Oh yeah  
Im praying that youll never know  
  
That Im facing hell  
That Im facing hell  
That Im facing hell  
That Im facing hell
