Youre not worth it babe  
The trouble you bring the noise you keep  
And you dont even care yeah  
  
Im so sick of you babe  
Nights wasted Im through faking  
You dont turn me on  
You dont do anything at all  
  
Baby I cant stand the sight of your face  
Baby I dont even want to hear your name  
  
Dont know what I saw  
But I aint seeing it now  
Woke up this morning bitterness in my mouth  
  
Guess I fell too fast  
Guess I learned my lesson  
So much for true love  
Ill take this chivas instead oh yeah  
  
Youre too high maintenance babe  
All the time you spent trying to fit in and no one even cares yeah  
Its so rediculous babe  
Watching you turn as I burn  
Its like youre not even there yeah  
  
Baby dont you try and hold my hand  
Maybe you should keep your eyes on your new girlfriend  
  
Dont know what I saw  
But are you seeing it now  
Woke up this morning biterness in my mouth  
Guess I fell too fast  
Guess I learned my lesson  
So much for true love  
Ill take this chivas instead oh  
  
Ill take this chivas instead  
Of your bed  
It wasnt even good  
Trust me  
I must have been so so so so lonely  
You are crap yeah  
You should keep your eyes on your new little brat Yeah  
Its hard not to look I know  
Im amazing  
I love you Chivas
