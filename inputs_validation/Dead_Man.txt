Sailing on my every step Inching off of the earth  
Is magnified by the things Ive done  
The thing that Ive become  
  
Every lift of my hand Coffee cup up and back  
Is magnified by the things Ive done The things Ive seen the things Ive
caused  
  
Im a dead man walking  
  
The hammer that I once brung down now hovers over me  
Cast a shadow across onto me  
  
The hallways are all mocking me  
What Ive become theyre all mocking me  
  
Im a dead man walking A dead man walking A dead man walking  
Im a dead man walking Dead man walking Dead man walking
