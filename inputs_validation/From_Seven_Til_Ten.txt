From Seven Til Ten  
Wait here for me Ill get the key  
Darlin I wont be long  
The place isnt much but as soon as we touch  
  
Anywheres home away from home  
Its a very nice room do you like my perfume  
I wanted everything to be just right  
Theres so little time for a love of this kind  
  
It cant even last through the night  
We have to steal all the love that we feel  
And were feelin like stealin again  
Well never be free so its gotta be  
  
Lovin from seven till ten  
Lovin from seven till ten  
Do you see a trace of love on my face  
I know shell have on the light  
  
Look in my eyes can he see how I cried  
While you were lovin me tonight  
We have to steal all the love that we feel  
And were feelin like stealin again  
  
Well never be free so its gotta be  
Lovin from seven til ten  
Lovin from seven till ten
