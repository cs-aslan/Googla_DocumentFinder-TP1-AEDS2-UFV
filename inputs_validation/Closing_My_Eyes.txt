Now its the same as before  
And Im alone again  
  
With no sorrow for myself  
And Im blaming no one else  
  
And closing my eyes  
And seeing you standing there  
  
Now its the same as before  
Youve touched me with your love  
  
And though youre in my heart  
Were still a world apart  
As now Im back to the time  
Where I would search for a dream  
But no use to try anymore as before  
Someday Ill die and maybe then Ill be with you  
  
So Im closing my eyes  
To hear the people laugh  
  
For theyre all aglow  
Not knowing where to go  
  
But is it asking too much  
When the question is what to do  
With the life Ill have  
It seems I know nothing now  
Except my love for you  
And the strength in my hands  
To go on feeding your smile
