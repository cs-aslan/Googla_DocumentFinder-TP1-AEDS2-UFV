Who are you in the other hours  
When your hairs undone  
And your guards let down  
When youre all alone in your all nightgown  
Are you the life of the party then  
Sitting by yourself again  
Where are you in the other hours  
Are you in a secret place that calls  
When youre by yourself with in your walls  
Are you undressed with someplace to go  
Off to catch your private show  
Why do you greet the morning  
Draping your heart in a shroud  
Why must your life be a sideshow  
Played to an ignorant crowd  
How are you in the other hours  
Do you pray for morning to arrive  
Do you wonder how you can stay alive  
Are you at peace in a troubled mind  
Hoping no one else would find  
Youre only playing dumb  
til the other hours come  
piano  
Who do you think youre fooling  
Turning your face from the light  
Clearly youre turning to something  
That are revealed by the night  
What are you in the other hours  
Are you queen of some abandoned song  
Thinking how your crown of jewels had shone  
Youre sitting there with no one to reign  
You think no one sees your pain  
And no one hears your drum  
So the other hours come
