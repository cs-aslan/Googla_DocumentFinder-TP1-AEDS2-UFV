Youre the hunter Im the game  
Since we met Im not the same  
The hunger in you cant be satisfied  
  
You had a secret strategy  
To take control and capture me  
I lost my will and now Im paralyzed  
  
We made a slave to love  
Thats what Ill always be  
A victim of your touch  
You stole my soul and now Im just a slave to love yeah  
  
It took one night at your hotel  
To fall from grace into your spell  
I cant believe you brought me to my knees  
  
You kiss me once and love me twice  
Im on your mental sacrifice  
Your targets touch was hot and aim to please  
  
We made a slave to love  
Thats what Ill always be  
A victim of your touch  
You stole my soul and now Im just a slave to love  
  
Oh Im being used  
Been held hostage for so long  
Is this a one way love affair  
Really wrong  
  
We made a slave to love  
Thats what Ill always be  
A victim of your touch  
You stole my soul and now Im just a slave to love  
  
Just a slave to love  
  
Just a slave to love  
A victim of your touch
