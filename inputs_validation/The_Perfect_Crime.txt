Girl listens to mom  
So she lights a match and pretends to sleep  
While everything burns  
Man drives nowhere  
So he pressed the pedal hit a few dogs  
And felt good  
Boy hears teachers words  
So he closed his eyes and stepped in front  
Of a train  
Woo  
Woops  
Sorry bout that  
Its just an accident  
Revenge  
Nobody forgets  
Chop it into bits  
The bitterness is hard to hide  
It smells like homicide  
Just nod and say its OK  
I can hear your voice echo  
OK I liedits really the voice  
Of the guy who kicked your head in  
Look in the mirror  
It seems youre drinking miniature  
And soon enough your gone  
Woops  
Sorry bout that  
Its just an accident  
Revenge  
Nobody forgets  
Chop it into bits  
The bitterness is hard to hide  
It smells like homicide  
Just nod and say its OK  
No one saw the perfect crime  
I cant wait for the next time  
The bitterness is hard to hide  
It smells like homicide  
Just nod and say its OK  
You try to make the moment  
Last you sold it right in half  
You die and have a nice day  
Woops  
Sorry bout that  
Its just an accident
