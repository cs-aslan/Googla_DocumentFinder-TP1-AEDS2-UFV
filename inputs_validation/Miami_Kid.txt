50 Cent  
Yeah nigga Ha ha  
Lets go nigga this is what it is  
Tupac cut his head bald  
Then you wanna cut yo head bald You pussy nigga  
Tupac wear a bandana  
You wan wear a bandana  
Tupac put a cross on his back  
You wanna put 2 crosses on yo back  
Nigga you aint Tupac This is Tupac  
  
Verse One 2Pac  
They say more money and women are funny  
But in this tragic endings I can make a million and still not  
Get enough for spendin  
And since my life is based on sinnin Im hellbound  
Id rather be buried than be worried diffrent than be held down  
My game plans to be trained well  
Military mind of a thug lord sittin in a cemetary car  
Ive been lost since my adolescent callin from Jesus  
Ballin as a gangsta wonderin if you see this  
Young black male crack sales got me three strikes  
Livin in jail this is hell enemies die  
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listenin  
Got my hands on my semishotgun everybodys snitchin  
Please God can you understand me bless my family  
Guide us all before we fall into insanity  
Im makin a point for all my people to be warlike  
Buy some shit to have you stupid bitches all tight  
  
Chorus  
Go niggas wanna get on thats right  
I gots some niggas in my click that make they muthafuckin jaws tight now  
  
Go niggas wanna get on thats right  
I gots some niggas in my click that make they muthafuckin jaws tight now  
  
Pitbull  
Im doing the impossible  
I gotta big flow thats unbelievable  
Im achieving the unachievable  
Im taking over like coke and baking soda  
The streets are waiting for me  
But for those who dont know me dont hate on me come on homie  
  
Yall should know me better  
Dont be mad cause Im a go getter from the bottom to ny to la  
Cubans and Essays and old school Chevys  
Blacks and Hispanics getting money I know yall cant stand it  
Thats why I say fuck em that just gives me more reason to buck em  
If youre felling lucky then dog press your luck  
And watch how quickly you get stuck Ill make sure when they hold you down  
You wont get up Dade County bet that up  
  
For building me the way Ive been built to the day I get killed  
Ima get money and run through bitches like Wilt the Stilt  
Chamberlain empty the chamber in in your face  
And leave your brains outa place  
Thats what happens to slow niggas that think they can live life at a fast
pace  
To them boys on the way to Tennesse listening to mj G breaking there burrs
down in Eightballs  
Be careful with them keys  
Dont hesitate to squeez watch out from them feds  
Cause they hate yall  
Bank accounts over seas when them Feds come for me all they gonna find is cds
and tapes dog  
Sipping hypnotiq and hennessy I know yall envy me but l wont let my tallent
go to waste dog  
  
50 Cent  
Now since youre cryin for mercy I promise  
My successll be the death of you  
Lo and behold you sold your soul  
Nigga theres nuttin left of you  
Look in the mirror ask yourself who are you  
If you dont know who you are how could your dreams come true  
Motherfucker I sat back and watched  
You pretended to be Pac you pretended to be hot  
But youre not now  
I see it so clear  
You cant take the pressure you pussy  
I warned you not to push me  
You see me and chills run up your spine  
Hardly even in the same war but your heart aint like mine  
Press they look at me like Im a menace  
I was playin with guns  
While your momma had your punk ass playin tennis  
  
Chorus
