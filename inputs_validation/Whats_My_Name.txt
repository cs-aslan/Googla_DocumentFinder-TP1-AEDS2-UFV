What the hell is wrong with me Im not  
Who I want to be  
I tired spot cream an I tried it all Im crawling up the wall  
  
Whats my name naaaamenaaaamenaaaame  
  
I tried to join a pingpong club sign on the door said all full up  
I got nicked fighting in the road an the judge didnt even know  
  
Whats my name  
  
Dad go pissed so I got clocked  
Couldnt hear the Tannoy so he lost the lot  
Offers Mum a bribe through the letter box  
Drives you fucking mad  
  
Whats my name  
  
Now Im round the back of your house at night  
Peeping in the window  are you sleeping tight  
I laugh at your locks with my celluloid strip  
An you wont know who came  
  
Whats my name
