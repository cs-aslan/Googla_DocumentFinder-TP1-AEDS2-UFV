You looked around but it wasnt there  
You cant ignore the voice of reason  
You cant be what you want so you better be what you are  
You fought your way to an inch of freedom  
You did your best and they didnt care  
Youve had your share and you have your reasons  
You cant be what you want so you better be what you are  
  
So we begin our story  
Beleaguered and taken down  
Everybody wants a piece of whats going on  
Afraid youll become dull and boring  
In a suit that doesnt fit  
Everybody wants a piece of whats going on  
You cant mean what you said  
Youre not sorry for a word of it  
Everybody wants to get ahead  
Now its not too late to say youre sorry  
  
Youre alright  
The Compromise  
Youve backed yourself into a corner  
You looked around and it wasnt there  
Youre such a sucker for superstition  
You cant be what you are  
So you better be what you want
