When the storms of the day have all blown away  
Along with fair weather friends  
Theres a place I can go where the wind doesnt blow  
Its the best place Ive ever been  
  
Youre a sight for sore eyes  
When I need a friend  
Youre a sight for sore eyes  
Let the healing begin  
  
When the chips are all down and theres no one around  
To count on like I count on you  
I just picture your face and let it erase  
All the pain Im goin through  
  
Youre a sight for sore eyes  
When I need a friend  
Youre a sight for sore eyes  
Let the healing begin  
  
When I get lost and I cant find my way  
And theres nowhere to turn at the end of the day  
  
Youre a sight for sore eyes  
When I need a friend  
Youre a sight for sore eyes  
Let the healing begin  
  
Youre a sight for sore eyes  
Let the healing begin
