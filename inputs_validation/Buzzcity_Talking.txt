What makes you wander far  
Dont know who you are  
Now if the vibe is right  
Ill go out tonight  
  
Cause its Buzzcity talking  
Its Buzzcity talking  
Go and find a late night bar  
If Im not back leave the door ajar  
Its Buzzcity talking  
Talking to me  
  
We have sickness in our hair  
We have time to spare  
You close another door  
Break another law when its  
  
Fast night goes fast  
Oh Oh Oh
