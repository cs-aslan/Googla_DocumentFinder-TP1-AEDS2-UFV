The river keeps on rolling  
My life stream keeps on flowing  
Only you know what youre doing to my soul  
My dreams call on tomorrow  
My love knows all my sorrow  
Only you know what youre doing to my soul  
  
Stay with me and well find a way  
Ill be your night if youll be my day  
Through the dawn and beyond the sky  
We can fly you and I  
Only you know what youre doing to my soul  
  
The river keeps on rolling  
My life stream keeps on flowing  
Only you know what youre doing to my soul  
Only you know what youre doing to my soul
