You took my love I thought I was the only one  
You took my love it feels like you did it for fun  
You took my love but my heart keeps telling me youre the one  
You took my love took my love  
  
Loquita I dont play you know what time it is with me

Yaoh Im in the club and the place is poppin  
Sipsippin bub and the bass is knockin  
Times are great cause Im with my crew  
But my smile is fake cause Im missing you  
Baby you know that I didnt learn my lesson  
Shoulda gave you more time more love and affection  
And when I see you later with that other guy  
Keep telling myself a player aint suppose to cry  
  
You took my love I thought I was the only one  
You took my love it feels like you did it for fun  
You took my love but my heart keeps telling me youre the one

She took my love and played me for a sucker  
But it dont even matter cause you know I still love her  
She took my heart and threw it on the ground  
But it dont even matter cause I still want her around  
  
Shes such a love taker shes such a love taker  
Its guaranteed that shes a professional heart breaker  
But a great love maker all in a sheet  
She made my heart skip a beat  
But for now shes as cold as they come  
Not mags no life and no guns  
She took my love  
  
You took my love I thought I was the only one  
You took my love it feels like you did it for fun  
You took my love but my heart keeps telling me youre the one  
You took my love took my love  
  
Repeat x8  
Love
