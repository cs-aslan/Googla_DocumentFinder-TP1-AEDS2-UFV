I am a man of constant sorrow  
Ive seen trouble all my days  
Ill say goodbye to Colorado  
Where I was born and probly raised  
  
Your mother says I am a stranger  
My face youll never see no more  
But theres one promise darling  
Ill see you on Gods golden shore  
  
Through this open world Im about to ramble  
Through ice snow sleet and rain  
I am about to rob the mornin railroad  
Perhaps Ill die on that train  
  
Im goin back to Colorado  
Place that I started from  
If Id knowed how bad youd treat me  
Honey I never would have come
