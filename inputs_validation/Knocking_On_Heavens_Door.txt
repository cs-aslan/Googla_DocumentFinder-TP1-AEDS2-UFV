Mama take this badge from me  
I cant use it anymore  
Its getting dark too dark to see  
Feels like Im knockin on heavens door  
  
Knockknockknockin on heavens door  
Knockknockknockin on heavens door  
Knockknockknockin on heavens door  
Knockknockknockin on heavens door  
  
Mama put my guns in the ground  
I cant shoot them anymore  
That cold black cloud is comin down  
Feels like Im knockin on heavens door  
  
Knockknockknockin on heavens door  
Knockknockknockin on heavens door  
Knockknockknockin on heavens door  
Knockknockknockin on heavens door  
  
You just better start sniffin your own  
Rank subjugation jack cause its just  
You against your tattered libido the bank  
And the mortician forever man and it  
Wouldnt be luck if you could get out of  
Life alive  
  
Knockknockknockin on heavens door
