Farewell  
To all of the heartaches you brought  
So long  
To all of the tears I cried  
Goodbye  
To the bitter lesson you taught  
Farewell so long goodbye  
  
Through with having you walk on me now  
How many times can one person die  
Once I was blinded  
But I can see now  
Farewell so long goodbye  
  
If there was some way to start again  
Id try it  
But we both know  
It never can be  
Oh  
Wish I could say I wont even miss you  
Its gonna hurt me and thats no lie  
But Ill get hurt more if I stay with you  
So Farwell So long Goodbye
