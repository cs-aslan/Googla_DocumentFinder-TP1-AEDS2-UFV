Tucked away in the darkest cupboard of your heart  
Theres a feeling you cant let out  
In a way you are just a soldier of the mind  
You are marching what are you marching about  
  
On your mark now get set  
Get back on your feet  
We aint down yet  
You know we will get it  
So dont you forget  
That the world rolls on  
  
Your reward will come  
Its just a question of how and when  
Look around everyone is wondering where its at  
Do you wonder or do you know  
  
Clap your hands Raise your voice  
Some people will hide  
They cant stand the noise  
But were freedom fighters  
And weve got no choice  
  
In a way you are just a soldier of the mind  
But the world rolls on  
Your reward will come  
  
And the truth will come and the change will come  
Its just a question of how and when  
I cant believe my eyes
