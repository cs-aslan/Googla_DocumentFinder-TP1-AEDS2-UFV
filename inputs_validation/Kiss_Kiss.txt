Green hours  
Blue rope  
Hot wax for hearts are cold  
Were three were three in the dark tonight  
And baby my snake is a shark tonight  
  
Hes got youth on the side  
Hes got small purple eyes  
Now hes as straight as a bow  
When theres nobody home  
  
Everywhere kiss me  
Everywhere kids speak  
No catch no beat  
Everywhere kiss me  
Everywhere kiss me  
  
Everywhere kiss me  
Everywhere kids meet  
No catch no beat  
Everywhere kiss  
Everywhere kiss kiss me  
  
I may like doing  high  
I drop my music loud outside  
I drank until the waters dry  
Its all okay till someone dies  
I shoot my name up every vain  
You cant get hurt you cant complain  
No feet no hands no tale no lies  
Hes got youth on his side  
  
Everywhere kiss me  
Everywhere kids speak  
No catch no beat  
Everywhere kiss me  
Everywhere kiss me  
  
Everywhere kiss me  
Everywhere kids meet  
No catch no beat  
Everywhere kiss  
Everywhere kiss kiss me  
  
Were three were three were three were three  
Were three were three in the dark tonight and baby my snake is a shark
tonight
