I didnt know that youd be leavin  
Or who you thought you were talkin to  
I figure maybe were even  
Or maybe Im one up on you  
  
I send you all my money  
Just like I did before  
I tried to reach you honey  
But youre driftin too far from shore  
  
Driftin too far from shore  
Driftin too far from shore  
Driftin too far from shore  
Driftin too far from shore  
  
I aint gonna get lost in this current  
I dont like playing cat and mouse  
No gentleman likes making love to a servant  
Especially when hes in his fathers house  
  
I never could guess your weight baby  
Never needed to call you my whore  
I always thought you were straight baby  
But youre driftin too far from shore  
  
Driftin too far from shore  
Driftin too far from shore  
Driftin too far from shore  
Driftin too far from shore  
  
Well these times and these tunnels are haunted  
The bottom of the barrel is too  
I waited years sometimes for what I wanted  
Everybody cant be as lucky as you  
  
Never no more do I wonder  
Why you dont never play with me any more  
At any moment you could go under  
Cause youre driftin too far from shore  
  
Driftin too far from shore  
Driftin too far from shore  
Driftin too far from shore  
Driftin too far from shore  
  
You and me we had completeness  
I give you all of what I could provide  
We werent on the wrong side sweetness  
We were the wrong side  
  
Ive already ripped out the phones honey  
You cant walk the streets in a war  
I can finish this alone honey  
Youre driftin too far from shore
