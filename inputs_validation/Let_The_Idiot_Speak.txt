There was a half a harvest moon up on the hillside  
Our love is made almost entirely of downside  
Who would have thought it could feel so much better then  
Now theres a half a million things I wanna tell you  
They tap the phone line and the speaker at the drive through  
Who would have thought it could feel so much different then  
Downtown so weak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Now theres a strange way and awkward feelings  
Im bouncing off the wall Im talking to the ceilings  
Who would have thought it could feel so bad sometimes  
Now theres a half a million reasons we can argue  
Youre right in front of me now theres no one to talk to  
Who would have thought it could feel so bad sometimes  
Downtown so weak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Downtown so weak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot speak  
Let the idiot
