Im as free as a bird now  
As flighty as a Bumble Bee  
Im here today and gone tomorrow  
Foot loose child and fancy free  
Im absolutely independent  
Nothin at all is gonna worry me  
I believe I was born to travel  
The open road is gonna bring me close  
You come to know some wayout people  
To say the least I dig the most  
Who live and love across both borders  
Trip East and West from coast to coast  
I only have one cradle to rock now  
Im gonna rock it everywhere I go  
From St Louis to San Francisco  
Ah From Canada to Mexico  
Im gonna let my cradle rock now  
Till it just wont rock no more
