The systems got too much control and they dont wanna let it go  
Im a prisoner fighting to be free Im breaking out of captivity  
  
Chorus  
Be free be free  
To be free  
  
Little by little Im losing control  
As little by little my rights erode  
I stop the deputy now you know  
Mama dont try you see I got to go  
  
Chorus  
  
The governments got too much control  
Now is there some place that we can roll  
The politics of fear and oppression is everywhere now  
The law is closing in just take what you can bring  
  
Chorus  
  
The systems got too much control  
Now is there some place that we can roll  
Im a prisoner fighting to be free the law is closing in  
Just take what we can bring
