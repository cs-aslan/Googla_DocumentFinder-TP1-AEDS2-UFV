Me and my big ideas  
Wont wash away your tears  
No one else seems to mind  
That Im not that kind  
  
Go get a volunteer  
Well pay him well my dear  
He will see inside your mind  
Because he is that kind  
  
Its a southern kind of heat  
The shadows crack and start to creep  
Conversation drag its feet  
I wish wed both been more discret  
Like light that it caught between night and day  
Youre stuck between me and my  
  
Me and my big ideas  
Wont wash away your tears  
No one else seems to mind  
That Im not that kind  
  
Well they love you when youre weak  
Bet they hate you to see this winning streak  
Its that thing we call control  
Theres a deep frustration  
Black thoughts  
That are stuck between someones ears  
Like me and my big idea  
  
So many strings to your bow  
Why not let one go  
  
In a way this dream is over  
Blown away our four leaf clover  
  
Theres no reason why  
Theres just me and my  
  
Me and my big ideas  
Wont wash away your tears  
No one else seems to mind  
That Im not that kind
