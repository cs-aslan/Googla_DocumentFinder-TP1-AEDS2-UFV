Dont know much about practicing what I preach  
Dont know how to be envious without jealousy  
Dont know how to hold my temper when I have to get in the last word  
Dont know how to speak softly and still be heard  
But before I lose everything and everyone who loves me  
God if youre listening would you have a message sent  
Cause I need to be a better lover brother and a friend  
God if youre listening would you come up with some change  
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name  
Dont know much about love cause I get the same crap from every guy  
Dont know how to see the grass being greener on my side  
Dont know much about wisdom without being jaded  
Dont know how to take criticism without feeling hated  
But before I lose everything and everyone who loves me  
God if youre listening would you have a message sent  
Cause I need to be a better lover brother and a friend  
God if youre listening would you come up with some change  
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name  
Whoa man Im everything I said I wouldnt be  
Standing here with nothing will you help me  
Dont know how to tell a joke without putting my foot in my mouth  
Dont know how to be intimate if I dont have a crowd  
Dont know how to be hopeful what if they let me down  
I dont know how to keep myself from hurting everyone  
God if youre listening would you have a message sent  
Cause I need to be a better lover brother and a friend  
God if youre listening would you come up with some change  
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name  
God if youre listening would you have a message sent  
Cause I need to be a better lover brother and a friend  
God if youre listening would you come up with some change  
Cause I wake up every morning with a penny to my name  
Oh God I dont know much about nothing  
No so give me a break  
Anyway wont anybody listen to me  
Oh oh
