Is life everything you want to be  
Does it give you everything that you need  
Does it live up to your expectations  
Are you ready for the celebrations  
This is not for the weak of mind  
Are you sure that youre my kind  
Do you want to be part of me  
Are you sure that you can really see  
Are you chained to a life that you dont want  
Is it hard for you to find a way out  
Can you live without the love that you need  
Are you sure that what you have is so real  
This is not for the weak of mind  
Are you sure that youre my kind  
Do you want to be part of me  
Are you sure that you can really see  
All of your life they try to take your cover  
Turn you into another and make you change your name  
When you fall its up to you to recover  
You cant depend on another to help you with the pain yeah  
Im shaking off the chains Im shaking off the chains  
This is not for the weak of mind  
Are you sure that youre my kind  
Do you want to be part of me  
Are you sure that you can really see  
In the night you say that you are falling  
People always calling calling out your name  
What do you know a face appears at the window  
Tapping on the window the window of your soul  
Im shaking off the chains Im tired of all the pain  
Im shaking off the chains let me live again  
Shaking off the chains shaking off the chains
