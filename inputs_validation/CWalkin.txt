G shit LBC shit remember how it used to be  
Mmm you remember so much  
No we didnt see if you can remember this shit  
1982 now what was I to do  
  
All I want to do ic claim RTC  
Cause all of my homies from ICG  
So we goin do this thang for tha LBC  
Cause we all one love and yeah this the dub  
  
On my eleven gettin slicker  
Buyin liquor from a nonliquor store  
Quick to dick a hoe and get that big homie for a 64  
He aint goin miss it though  
  
Cause Im too slick for him to notice it was gone  
But I fucked up and scraped his chrome  
Now hes tryin to take my dome  
Hangin out all in front of my home  
  
Now I got to get some of my chrome on my own  
Now its really on  
Cause Im a dome this nigga and get him for his shit  
Put that switches on his riches  
  
Now his bitch is my bitch  
Aint that a trip how Im a crip  
But I wont hesitate to test another rip  
See thats the plan I was brainwashed not to know  
  
But nigga fuck what you goin through this 20  
And by that time Im 17 if I aint in that pin  
Im on a mission wit tha homeboys mashin again  
Ridin hoobangin like Mack 10  
  
Back on tha streets again and strapped in  
Im lookin for tha niggas wit tha wrong fingas up  
Nigga I dont give a fuck nigga I dont give a fuck em  
Straight bang bang bang bangin bangin  
  
Chorus x2  
Shoot em up shoot em up bang bang  
Its all fair in tha gang bang  
  
I feel like livin it up  
I mean will like livin it up you know  
Bang to that boogie and boogie to that bang  
That sound of mi Nina when she feel that need to sang  
  
I got a gang of bitches who ride for me now  
Not to mention that homeboys locked down in tha p now  
See now that road get shaky but you cant break  
Watch out for them hood rats snakes  
  
Cause E told me a little story that left me kinda hurt  
The lil homie did too much dirt and got worked  
Now hes on the run and dyin of thirst  
Stayin at his girls spot on 21st  
  
And when he gets snitched on that aint tha worst  
Cause he might not make it to tha last verse  
But meanwhile back in tha p now  
Me and my niggas is representin LBC style  
  
Straight hoobangin and slangin cigarettes  
I shank ya baby brotha just to get a rep  
We straight bangin  
  
Chorus x4  
  
This is Dogg Pound for life  
This is Dogg Pound for life yeah right  
What you join tha game for you lil busta  
Now you want to cross us out and disrespect us  
  
Must of thought we was bustas or somethin  
I drop two niggas I dont need you niggas  
Thats that one thang I learned about tha gang bang  
If you goin gang bang  
  
Ya gots to be able to bang like yourself man  
So whether you bangin for crip or blood  
You better bang for somthin young thug  
Cause youll get banged on not by bangas  
  
But by Johnny Law cause they love to hang us I hear ya  
I ride wit ya dogg if you can get me to tha border  
My baby mama flipped out and dipped out wit my daughter  
I oughta trip on that bitch I oughta flip on that bitch  
  
I cant trip cause she look like my daughter and shit  
So Im a load up my clip and go ridin high  
And every police car that I see ridin by  
I autograph their car wit my brand new lid  
  
Drinkin to that set and hope my dog young have head  
Throwin up DPG for LIFE cause thats all I see  
Wit love for the LB  
  
Chorus
