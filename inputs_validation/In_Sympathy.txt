Theyre almost falling over you  
Why dont they call a truce  
What ever they are trying to do  
Its of little use  
Theyre drowning you in compliments  
Trying to furnish proof  
And though they speak with eloquence  
There is little truth  
  
Chorus  
Youre bright youre strong you know your right from wrong  
At least to some degree  
Youre wise youre tough youve heard their lies enough  
You smile in sympathy  
  
Im watching your serenity  
The way your soul transcends  
Their tedious obscenities  
Youre patience never ends  
  
And as the night begins to fade  
You are heading for the door  
Followed by a sad parade  
Youre on your own once more  
  
Chorus x2  
Youre bright youre strong you know your right from wrong  
At least to some degree  
Youre wise youre tough youve heard their lies enough  
You smile in sympathy
