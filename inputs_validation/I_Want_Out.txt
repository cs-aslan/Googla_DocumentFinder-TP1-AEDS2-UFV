Ooh baby got a hold on me I cant deny it  
You locked the door and you swallowed the key  
And I and I kept quiet  
Yeah baby got a hold on me I didnt want to be alone  
I stayed with you cause I really believed  
That I couldnt make it on my own  
  
But Im getting a little bit smarter  
Gettin tired of playin the martyr  
And I know what youre all about  
I Want Out  
I Want Out  
  
Ooh baby your lovin told on me I couldnt smile anymore  
My friends all told me baby cant you see  
But I wasnt seeing clear before  
  
Now Im getting a little bit smarter  
Gettin tired of playin the martyr  
And I know what youre all about  
I Want Out  
I Want Out  
  
Ooh baby got a hold on me I didnt want to be alone  
I stayed with you cause I really believed  
That I couldnt make it  
I Want Out  
  
Ooh baby got a hold on me  
I Want Out  
Ooh baby got a hold on me  
I Want Out  
Ooh baby got a hold on me  
I Want Out  
Ooh baby got a hold on me  
I Want Out  
Ooh baby got a hold on me  
I Want Out  
Ooh baby got a hold on me  
I Want Out  
Ooh baby got a hold on me  
I Want Out  
Ooh baby got a hold on me  
I Want Out
