Guess theres no use in hangin round  
Guess Ill get dressed and do the town  
Ill find some crowded avenue  
Though it will be empty without you  
  
Cant get used to losin you no matter what I try to do  
Gonna live my whole life thoroughloving you  
  
Called up some girl I used to know  
After I heard her say Hello  
Couldnt think of anything to say  
Since youre gone it happens every day  
  
Cant get used to losin you no matter what I try to do  
Gonna live my whole life throughloving you  
  
Ill find somebody wait and see  
Who am I kiddin only me  
Cause no one else could take your place  
Guess that I am just a hopeless case  
  
Cant get used to losin you no matter what I try to do  
Gonna live my whole life thoroughloving you  
  
I cant get used to losin you no matter what I try to do  
Gonna live my whole life thoroughloving you
