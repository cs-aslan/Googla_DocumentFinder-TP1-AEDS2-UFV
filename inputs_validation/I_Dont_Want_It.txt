Did we miss the moon  
Id lie in your arms if I could  
Such a common pain  
Repeats itself again and again  
  
Flowers grow in the springtime and leaves fall from the trees  
Ive been GONE for so long you just threw away the keys  
I understand it but I dont want it  
  
I know it so well you tripped me and I laughed when you fell  
This isnt how it should be  
Ive let you drift so far from me  
  
But please hold onto the memories  
Before we really crash and burn  
Weve got ourselves so wrapped up that weve forgotten how to learn  
I understand it but I dont want it
