One more step to the top of the city  
Where just a couple of pigeons are living  
Up on the angels shoulders  
  
I dont know if Im closer to Heaven but  
It looks like Hell down there  
These streets have never been paved with gold  
Welcome to the loneliest city in the world  
Its no good for you baby  
Its no good for you now  
Keep looking up for the ladder  
  
I dont know if youll love me for it  
But I dont think we should suffer this  
Theres just one thing we can do about it  
  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Take me up to the top of the city  
And put me up on the angels shoulders  
  
See how that building there is nearly built  
Theres a big fire over on the north of the city  
I see you walking down the street with her  
I see your lights going on and off  
Shes no good for you baby  
Shes no good for you now  
Look Im here with the ladder  
  
I dont know if you love me or not  
But I dont think we should ever suffer  
Theres just one thing we can do about this  
  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Up to the highest point of the city  
One more step to the top of the city  
Put me up on the angels shoulders  
  
And I dont mind if its dangerous  
I dont mind if its raining  
Take me to the top of the city  
  
And put me up on the angels shoulders  
Take me to the top of the city  
Mmm yes one more step to the top of the city  
And put me up on the angels shoulders
