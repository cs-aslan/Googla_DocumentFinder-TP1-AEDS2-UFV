Dont say no to anything  
Yes yes say yes to everything  
Just find away to get away wanna run away  
Lets take off our clothes and see if anybody notices  
Then run away what dyou say  
Have a little joy have a little faith live life  
Have a little hope have a lot of fun  
  
Chorus  
Cause you you you never know what fate will throw  
To make you stop  
I I Im gonna try  
To let this life  
Pick me up and take me away  
  
Run up to a stranger  
Kiss and tell them that you love them  
And then walk away  
You made their day at least you hope you did  
Stand up in a restaurant  
Start dancing on the table  
Get kicked out for that behavior oops I did it again  
Have a little joy have a little faith live life  
Have a little hope have a lot of fun  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont you know that nothing equals nothing  
Do anything do everything do something  
Open up your mouth and let your soul sing  
  
You you you never know what faith will throw  
To make you stop  
  
Guitar solo  
  
You you you never know what fate will throw  
To make you stop  
Im gonna try  
To let this life  
Pick me up and take me away
