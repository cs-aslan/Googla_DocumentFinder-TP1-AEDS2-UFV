You cant run away forever  
But theres nothing wrong with getting a good head start  
You want to shut out the night  
You want to shut down the sun  
You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart  
  
Think of how wed lay down together  
Wed be listening to the radio so loud and so strong  
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods  
Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs  
  
I treasure your love  
I never want to lose it  
Youve been through the fires of hell  
And I know youve got the ashes to prove it  
  
I treasure your love  
I want to show you how to use it  
Youve been through a lot of pain in the dirt  
And I know youve got the scars to prove it  
  
Remember everything that I told you  
And Im telling you again that its true  
When youre alone and afraid  
And youre completely amazed  
To find theres nothing anybody can do  
  
Keep on believing  
And youll discover baby  
  
Theres always something magic  
Theres always something new  
And when you really really need it the most  
Thats when rock and roll dreams come through  
  
The beat is yours forever  
The beat is always true  
And when you really need it the most  
Thats when rock and roll dreams come through for you  
  
Once upon a time was a backbeat  
Once upon a time all the chords came to life  
And the angels had guitars even before they had wings  
If you hold onto a chorus you can get through the night  
  
I treasure your love  
I never want to lose it  
And youve been through the fires of hell  
And I know youve got the ashes to prove it  
  
I treasure you love  
I want to show you how to use it  
Youve been through a lot of pain in the dirt  
And I know youve got the scars to prove it  
  
Remember everything that I told you  
And Im telling you again that its true  
Youre never alone cause you can put on the phones  
And let the drummer tell your heart what to do  
  
Keep on believing  
And youll discover baby  
  
Theres always something magic  
Theres always something new  
And when you really really need it the most  
Thats when rock and roll dreams come through  
  
The beat is yours forever  
The beat is always true  
And when you really really need it the most  
Thats when rock and roll dreams come through for you
