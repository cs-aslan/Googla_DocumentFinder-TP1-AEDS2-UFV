You give me straight like  yard  
Tired of all the talk theyre talkin all over this town  
Im tired of all the negativity thats going round  
We focus all our energy on things that bring us down  
  
Lets put our voices all together and make a joyful sound  
Do just what you want to do  
Oh let the sun come shining through  
Everybody  
  
Live live

You got to do it   
  
Life is the most precious gift I thank the Lord for mine  
I hope you feel the same my friend I hope youre feeling fine  
The choice is yours your destiny is waiting on the line  
You better get busy with living or youre busy dying  
  
Do just what you want to do  
Oh let the sun come shining through  
Everybody
