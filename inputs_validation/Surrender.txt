Ive never felt this way before  
Theres nothing else I could want more  
Than something real only passion can reveal yeah  
  
With body and soul Im used to controlling  
Every everything  
Now I can let go let down my guard  
And well see how far this love can go  
  
Chorus  
I surrender my heart Im giving up  
And I dont want to fight I just want to love  
I surrender it all Im giving in  
To the power of love  surrender  
  
This feels to good cant bring me down  
Feels like I could never touch ground  
And how Ive waited true love anticipated yeahyeah  
  
With body and mind I know that theres time  
For every everything  
Now I can let go let down my guard  
And well see how far this love can go  
  
Chorus  
  
And its just to strong and I cant hold on  
What used to be and clear to me  
Its just a fantasy  
Im breaking down right here right now  
I want you to know gonna take you slow just  
Let the feeling flow  
  
I surrender  
I surrender my heart Im giving up  
I dont want to fight  
Let it flow just want to now

To the power of love

Chorus  
  
Cause its just to strong and I cant hold on  
What used to be just in clear to me

Want you to know gonna let the feelings flow
