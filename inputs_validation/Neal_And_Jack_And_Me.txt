Im wheels I am moving wheels  
I am a 1952 studebaker coupe  
Im wheels I am moving wheels moving wheels  
I am a 1952 starlite coupe  
  
En route les Souterrains  
Des visions do Cody Sartori a Paris  
Strange spaghetti in this solemn city  
Theres a postcard were all seen before  
  
Past wildhaired teens in dark clothing  
With handsfull of autographed napkins we  
Eat apples in vans with sandwiches rush  
Into the lobby life of hurry up and wait  
  
Hurry up and wait for all the oddshaped keys  
Which lead to new soap and envelopes  
Hotel room homesickness on a fresh blue bed  
And the longestever phone call home no  
  
Sleep no sleep no sleep no sleep and no mad  
Video machine to eat time a city scene  
I cant explain the Seine alone at 4am  
The Seine alone at 4am Neal and Jack and me  
  
Absent lovers absent lovers
