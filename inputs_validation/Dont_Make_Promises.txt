It seems the songs were singing  
Are all about tomorrow  
Tunes of promises that we cant keep  
Every moment bringing  
A love I can only borrow  
Youre telling me lies in your sleep  
  
Do you think Im not aware  
Of what youre saying  
Or why youre saying it  
Is it hard to keep me where  
You want me staying  
Dont go on betraying  
  
Dont make promises that you cant keep  
  
We had a chance to find it  
Our time was now or never  
You promised me things that I need  
And then the things behind it  
Took away the chance forever  
Youre telling me lies in your sleep  
  
Do you think Im not aware  
Of what youre saying  
Or why youre saying it  
Is it hard to keep me where  
You want me staying  
Dont go on betraying  
  
Dont make promises that you cant keep  
Dont make promises that you cant keep  
Dont make promises that you cant keep  
Dont make promises that you cant keep
