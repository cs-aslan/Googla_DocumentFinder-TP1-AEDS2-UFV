When we first met I didnt know what to do  
My old love lines were all worn out on you  
And the world walked round at my mouth  
They lit me up and they snuffed me out  
  
Chorus  
And I was everybodys boy  
But soon that thrill just fades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
  
You wont know who to thank  
You wont know who to blame  
Its just a part of the murdering game  
Cause down in the fleshpots  
Where they pay you in pounds  
Theyre laughing like drains  
And baying like bloodhounds  
For the Jack of all parades  
The Jack of all parades  
  
Once I knew a girl  
That looked so much like Judy Garland  
That people would stop and give her money  
And everybody was Frankie Jimmy or Bobby  
Not the Jack the Jack of all parades  
Oh the Jack the Jack of all parades  
Oh the Jack of all parades  
  
Now the way that I feel is no longer news  
You know my love and how to refuse it  
Cause you know where the door is  
And how to use it  
Oh you know you do  
  
But from my checkered past  
To this shattered terrace  
Where you cant keep your mind off  
The crimes of Paris  
And you cant keep your peace  
And try to forget it  
And I cant forgive you  
For things you havent done yet  
  
Oh I was anybodys boy  
But soon that thrill just fades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
  
When we first met I didnt know what to do  
My old love lines were all worn out on you  
And the world walked round my mouth  
I didnt mean to say it  
I just blurted it out  
As you pretended not to notice  
Or be taken aback  
And I loved you there and then  
Its as simple as that  
  
Oh I was everybodys boy  
But soon that thrill just fades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
Oh the Jack of all parades
