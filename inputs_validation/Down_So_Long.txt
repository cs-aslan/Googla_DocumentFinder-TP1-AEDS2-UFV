The sun sets across the ocean  
Im a thousand mile from anywhere  
And my pocketbook in my heart  
Both just got stolen  
And the sun act like she dont even care  
The wind blows cold when you reach the top  
Feels like somebodys face is stuck to the bottom of my shoe  
Got a plastic Jesus a cordless telephone for every corner of my room  
Got everybody but you tellin me what to do  
  
Well Ive been down so long  
It cant be that much longer still  
And Ive been down for so long  
That the end must be drawing near  
  
I looked to everybody but me  
To answer my prayers  
Until I found an angel in the bathroom  
Who said she didnt see anybody who was saving anywhere  
And the blind man said Simple like flipping a coin   
Dont matter what side it lands on  
So long as its somebody elses dime  
Cause if youre the top of the bottom  
It all feels the same  
We live out of fear if were too rich or were too poor  
Guess all I can do is muster up some change  
And a little bit of faith  
And take some dignity when I walk through this door  
  
Gonna take a trip  
Catch a train  
Got a ticket in my hand  
And then a fat man takes my money  
And like cattle we all stand  
Im just a faceless body lost in this vast and worthless sea  
In a thousand people I do not know  
But really they are no different from me  
They all have passion  
They all have fear  
They all have intense confusion  
And no sweet moments that are clear  
They all have aspirations  
High hopes and dreams  
And are really that alone like me  
  
Weve been down so long  
It cant be that much longer still  
Weve been down so long  
That the end must be  
The end must be  
The end must be drawing near
