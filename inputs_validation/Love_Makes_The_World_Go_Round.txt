Love makes the world go round and around  
Love makes the world go round and around  
Love makes you feel three feet off the ground  
Love makes the world go round  
  
You should know its happened before  
You should have known what was in store  
You should know not to do it encore  
You should have known before  
  
You did it your way it never worked out  
Mr Right turned out Mr Wrong  
You wont change your ways because you believe  
In love is where you belong  
  
You did it your way it never worked out  
Mr Right turned out Mr Wrong  
You wont change your ways because you believe  
In love is where you belong  
  
Cant you see loves thrown out of the door  
Cant you see noone loves anymore  
Cant you see my worlds on the floor  
Without love can the world go round  
And around and around and around and around  
Without love without love can the world go round yeah
