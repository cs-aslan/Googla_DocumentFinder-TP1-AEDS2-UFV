Its so hot in here  
  
Oh its so hot and I need some air  
Oh boy dont stop cause Im halfway there  
Its not complicated were just syncopated  
We can read eachothers minds  
One love united  
Two bodies synchronizing  
Dont even need to touch me  
Baby just  
  
Breathe on me yeah oh  
Baby just breathe on me  
We dont need to touch just  
Breathe oh yeah  
  
Oh this is way beyond the physical its a way beyond the physical  
Tonight my senses dont make sense at all  
Our imagination taking us to places  
We have never been before  
Take me in let it out  
Dont even need to touch me  
Baby just  
  
Breathe on me yeah oh baby  
Just breathe on me  
We dont need to touch just  
Breathe breathe on on me me oh baby  
Just breathe breathe on on me me  
We dont need to touch  
Just breathe  
  
Monogamy is the way to go  
Just put your lips together and blow  
  
Breathe breathe oh  
  
Breathe on me oh oh oh  
Baby just breathe on me on me  
We dont need to touch just  
Breathe breathe on on me me oh  
Baby just breathe breathe on on me me  
We dont need to touch just
