We started living in an old house  
My ma gave birth and we were checking it out  
It was a baby boy  
So we bought him a toy  
It was a ray gun  
And it was 1981  
  
We named him Baby  
He had a tootache  
He started crying  
It sounded like an earthquake  
It didnt last long  
Because I stopped it  
I grabbed a rag doll  
And stuck some little pins in it  
  
Now were a family  
And were alright now  
We got money and a little place  
To fight now  
We dont know you  
And we dont owe you  
But if you see us around  
I got something else to show you  
  
Well its easy when you dont know better  
You think its sleazy  
Then put it in a short letter  
We keep warm  
But theres just something wrong  
When you  
Just feel like youre the hardest button to button  
  
I had opinions  
That didnt matter  
I had a brain  
That felt like pancake batter  
I got a backyard  
With nothing in it  
Except a stick  
A dog  
And a box with something in it  
  
The hardest button to button
