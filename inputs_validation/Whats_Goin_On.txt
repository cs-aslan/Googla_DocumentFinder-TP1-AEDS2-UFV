Mother mother  
Theres too many of you crying  
Brother brother brother  
Theres far too many of you dying  
You know weve got to find a way  
To bring some lovin here today  
  
Father father  
We dont need to escalate  
War is not the answer  
For only love can conquer hate  
You know weve got to find a way  
To bring some loving here today  
  
Picket lines and picket signs  
Dont punish me with brutality  
Talk to me so you can see  
  
Whats goin on  
Oh whats going on  
Whats goin on

Whats goin on  
Whats goin on
