You take away my air  
You make my lungs collapse  
I die tonight  
  
Feeling devastated  
Thats what I call  
Livin in your memory  
Thats what I call  
Tired and deflated  
Thats what I call  
Love  
  
I tidy up your room  
You tidy up my life  
Show me the door  
  
Im abandoned here  
Im warm to the core  
I can feel  
You sink I swim  
We never got in that deep  
You bend I break  
I die tonight  
  
Feeling devastated  
Thats what I call  
Hangin on and fallin over  
Thats what I call  
Tired and deflated  
Thats what I call  
Love  
  
I got a little room  
The airs still pretty bad  
I die tonight  
  
Feeling devastated  
Thats what I call  
Hangin on and fallin over  
Thats what I call  
Tired and deflated  
Thats what I call  
Feeling devastated  
Thats  
Livin with a vacuum cleaner  
What  
Sweepin up your memory  
I call love
