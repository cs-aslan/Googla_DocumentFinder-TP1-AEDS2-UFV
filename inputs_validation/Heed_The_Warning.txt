There are so many things in life to know  
Cause someone says its right dont make it so  
This is someone somewhere whos taking notes  
Theres someone telling lies sowing wild oats  
When you are moving fast you can succeed  
Just how long can you last at twice the speed  
  
Chorus  
Heres a warning two wrongs dont make a right  
Heed the warning and everything will be alright  
Ill keep good meter and Ill take my time  
Ill try to stay in beat and live in rhyme  
I know from love I came to love Ill go  
Ill live and learn and love and try to grow  
When you are moving fast you can succeed  
Just how long can you last at twice the speed
