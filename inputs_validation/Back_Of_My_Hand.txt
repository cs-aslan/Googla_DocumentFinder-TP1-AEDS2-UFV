I hear a preacher on the corner  
Ranting like a crazy man  
He says theres trouble troubles are coming  
I can read it like the back of my hand  
  
I see love I see misery  
Jamming side by side on the stage  
In the wind some mournful melody  
I can read it like the back of my hand  
  
The back of my hand Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
I see dreams I see visions  
Images I dont understand  
I see Goyas paranoias  
I can read it like the back of my hand  
  
Well read it like the back of my hand  
Oh yeah wow yeah  
Wow yeah  
Read it like the back of my hand
