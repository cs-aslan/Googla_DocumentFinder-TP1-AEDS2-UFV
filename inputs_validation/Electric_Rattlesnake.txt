Just cant win for losing stare em in the eye  
An ego made for bruising a heart that you cant buy  
If patience is a virtue lets set out to sin  
Im all worked up in the desert heat here I go again  
I never seem to smile youll find me in the dirt  
Your lovable reptile yeah for what its worth  
Im poison to your happiness poison to this song  
Cmon down cmon down to the ground so we can sing along  
  
Plug me in yeah now set me free  
I got a two fang grip that you should see  
All wrapped up down round your leg  
Let me loose Im a powder keg  
I love you  
  
More  
Than you can take  
Make no mistake  
Im an electric rattlesnake  
More  
Than you can take  
A two fang break  
Electric rattlesnake  
All curled up make no mistake  
Two fang deep got skin to break  
Plug me in got to shake and bake  
Electric rattlesnake  
More  
Than you can take  
No mistake  
Electric rattlesnake  
  
Im ya satisfaction give ya skin a glow  
The number one attraction apples packed to go  
Cmon down the garden original sin  
Got a two fang bite in the overnight here I go again  
All about just living living this or that  
Shake it up and lay it out the pigs are getting fat  
Bite me as I slither rape me as I bake  
Plug me in baby then turn me on  
Im your electric rattlesnake  
  
Snake bite color my imagination  
In a spiral dream a hallucination  
It comes to me with no reservation  
I got the taste do you mind  
Snake bite color my imagination  
Like a spiral dream of illumination  
It fills me up like a medication  
I got the taste do you mind here I go again
