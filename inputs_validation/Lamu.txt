Here we are on a boat out on the sea  
Off the coast of Africa  
Heading for peaceful shores  
With a cast of strangers  
To an island hideaway  
I hear you telling me  
Of the place we soon will be  
A rebirth from lifes demise  
Where the world is stillits ideal  
Anything you dream is real  
Its Hotel Paradise  
And you say its nice  
when you run to  
Lamufar away  
Leave the pain far behind you  
Hoping it wont find you in  
Lamufar away  
You say its there that you can run  
From the one inside of you  
  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la  
  
So here we are on an island in the sea  
Near the coast of Africa  
And when its rightLamu nights  
They can be so inviting  
Heaven here on earth  
But I hear you telling me  
This is everything you need  
Well I dont think its true  
Cause the way you feel isnt real  
You attempt to try and fill  
the void thats digging through  
And its killing you when you run to  
  
Lamufar away  
Tho that pain was behind you  
It can even find you in  
Lamufar away  
Because you never can run  
From the one inside of you  
  
I hear you telling me  
Of the place we soon will be  
A rebirth from lifes demise  
Where the world is stillits ideal  
Anything you dream is real  
Its Hotel Paradise  
And you say its nice  
when you run to  
  
Lamufar away  
Leave the pain far behind you  
Hoping it wont find you in  
Lamufar away  
Tho that pain was behind you  
It can even find you in  
Lamufar away  
Because you never can run  
From the one inside of you
