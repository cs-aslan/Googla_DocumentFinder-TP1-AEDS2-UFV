Theres three in the wall from those pictures in the closet  
Two in the bedroom from that night I lost it  
One deep inside me determined to stay  
They dont get any bigger but they dont go away  
  
Holes in and around me I keep falling back into  
Holes digging its around me  
God knows what Im gonna do  
To fill in these holes left by you  
Left by you  
  
I pour drink after drink but nothing hit bottom  
Ive been on my knees admitted my problem  
The love that we made still barely an echo  
Ill try anything in these vacant hollow  
  
Holes in and around me I keep falling back into  
Holes digging its around me  
God knows what Im gonna do  
To fill in these holes left by you  
Left by you  
  
Theres two through my hands and one through my feet  
From this cross that I bear until the day that I see
