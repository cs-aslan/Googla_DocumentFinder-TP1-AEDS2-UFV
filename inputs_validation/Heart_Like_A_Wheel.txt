Ive got a heart like a wheel  
Feel like I got to roll  
Oh  
Heart like a wheel  
  
I told you so  
And Ive been loving you for so long  
You are the one  
Heart so real  
  
I love you so  
Well I can give what I take  
And you know I want to give you my love  
Babe I aint faking  
  
You know I want to give you my love  
Ive been loving you for so long  
You are the one  
Heart so real  
  
I love you so  
Come on and roll  
Ive been loving you for so long  
You are the one  
  
Heart so real  
I love you so  
It takes two to make love  
It takes love to make a family real  
  
I got to know what you need  
I got to know what you really feel  
And Ive been loving you for so long  
You are the one  
  
Heart so real  
I love you so  
Come on and roll  
You know its such a pity  
  
If youre going to get the summertime blues  
Lovers everywhere are pairing off two by twos  
And Ive been loving you for so long  
You are the one  
  
Heart so real  
I love you so  
Ive been loving you for so long  
You are the one  
  
Heart so real  
I love you so  
Ive got a heart like a wheel  
I love you so  
  
Ive got a heart like a wheel  
Ive got to roll
