I was born from the sound of the strings  
For someone to give everything  
To be a song just for your feeling  
  
Close your eyes and Ill try to get in  
To waken your heart like the sping  
Cause I was born to touch your feelings  
  
Steal the time take a song and be glad  
Be free as the birds dont be sad  
Your time will come Ill make you feel it  
Youre still young like the sun after rain  
Follow the light its not in vain  
And you will see Ill touch your feelings  
  
Youve got your songs  
They are everyday for awhile  
Just the only way to feel all right  
Youve got your songs  
They are everyday for awhile  
Just the only way to feel all right  
  
You were born just to lose or to win  
To be someones chime in the wind  
To live between your mind and feelings  
Find your way check it out  
Learn each day  
Follow the light its not in vain  
And you will see Ill touch your feelings  
  
Youve got your songs  
They are everyday for awhile  
Just the only way to feel all right  
Youve got your songs  
They are everyday for awhile  
Just the only way to feel all right  
  
I was born from the sound of the strings  
For someone to give everything  
To be a song just for your feeling  
I was born from the sound of the strings  
For someone to give everything  
To be a song just for your feeling
