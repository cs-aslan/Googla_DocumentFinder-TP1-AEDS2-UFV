My way was the hard way  
Didnt know it at the time  
I couldve made it by now  
But I as too busy trying  
Your way was too easy  
Thank God you came along  
You took me to a special place  
Where nothing can go wrong  
  
Easy on easy street  
Youre the one who gave me love  
That made my love complete  
Easy on easy street  
The dream I pictured in my mind  
Could never be this sweet  
Everything Ill ever need  
Is here with you on easy street  
  
I know youre up to something  
Whats on your little heart  
It really doesnt matter cause  
I know Ill love my part  
  
Easy on easy street  
Youre the one who gave me love  
That made my love complete  
Easy on easy street  
The dream I pictured in my mind  
Could never be this sweet  
Everything Ill ever need  
Is here with you on easy street  
  
Is here with you on easy street  
The dream I pictured in my mind  
Could never be this sweet  
Everything Ill ever need  
Is here with you on easy street
