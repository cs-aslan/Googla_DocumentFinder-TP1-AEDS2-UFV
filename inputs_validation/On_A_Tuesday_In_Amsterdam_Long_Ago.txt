A picture of Amsterdam  
Bare trees under glass  
Framed in the afternoon light  
Of a winter long past  
When I was a raiser  
To Dublin Id roam  
She was a bareback rider  
Some miles from home  
Come back to me  
Shes a carnival driver  
Hung in the sky  
Cutting through time like a memory  
Strung on a wire  
The color of anything  
Fades in the air  
But she is the film of a book of the story  
Of the smell of her hair  
Come back to me  
When every things over  
And every things clear  
When everyones older  
And no one is here  
I try to remember  
A girl on a wire  
Tumbling and diving above Stephens Green  
Like a kite on the air  
Come back to me
