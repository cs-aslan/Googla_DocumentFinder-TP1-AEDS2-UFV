Ive had fame and fortune  
Women come knock on my door  
Ive lived to the limit  
Maybe a little bit more  
  
There are so many stories  
About how I got out of control  
Some say its a woman  
Some say its my troubled soul  
  
Im like a crazy old soldier  
Fighting a war on my own  
Just me and the whiskey  
And the bottles are ten thousand strong  
  
Youd think Id give up  
As many times as Ive been hit  
But like a crazy old soldier  
I just dont know when to quit  
  
Bar rooms and bedrooms  
Are just faces and places and names  
Once for the pleasure  
And Lord knows once for the pain  
  
Ive tried to forget her  
And all of the things that weve done  
But as long as there are memories  
Ill never hang up my gun  
  
Im like a crazy old soldier  
Fighting a war on my own  
Just me and the whiskey  
And the bottles are ten thousand strong  
  
Youd think Id give up  
As many times as Ive been hit  
But like a crazy old soldier  
I just dont know when to quit  
  
Like a crazy old soldier  
I just dont know when to quit
