Words and music by greg allman  
I got to run to keep from hidin  
And Im bound to keep on ridin  
I got one more silver dollar  
But Im not gonna let them catch  
The midnight rider  
I got only the clothes Im wearin  
And the road goes on forever  
I got one more silver dollar  
And Im not gonna let them catch  
The midnight rider  
I own all the clothes Im wearin  
Some old bed Ill soon be sharin  
Got me one more silver dollar  
And Im not gonna let them catch  
The midnight rider  
Not gonna let em catch me  
Not gonna let em catch me  
Not gonna let em catch me  
Not gonna let em catch me  
Not gonna let em catch me  
Not gonna let em catch me  
Not gonna let em catch me  
Not gonna let em catch me  
Come on  
Keep on riding  
Keep on riding  
Keep on riding  
Midnight midnight rider
