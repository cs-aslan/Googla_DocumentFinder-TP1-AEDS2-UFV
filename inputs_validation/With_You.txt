Chorus  
I want to spend my whole life with you  
Theres nothing else better than being with you  
I want to spend my whole life my whole life with you  
  
Do you remember all those precious times  
We shared back in the past  
No one knew about the things we did  
Out in the grass  
  
Were older now  
And we both need companionship  
So lets stop these games  
And get on with our relationship  
  
Aint no second guessin about  
The way I feel when Im with you  
It makes me feel so real  
Aint no living without you  
Cause youre all the man I need  
And I want you just for me  
  
Chorus  
  
Why is it when I say I love you  
You shy away from me  
When lovins all I want to do  
Even though weve never been  
  
More than just friends  
Theres no reason  
We should have to let our feelings end  
  
Aint no second guessin about  
The way I feel when Im with you  
It makes me feel so real  
Aint no living without you  
Cause youre all the man I need  
And I want you just for me  
  
Chorus
