For your love for your love  
When I think about those nights in Montreal  
I get the sweetest thoughts of you and me  
Memories of love above the city lights  
Ooh Ive tried so hard to take it  
But oh Lord my heart wont make it  
  
I just want to stop  
And tell you what I feel about you babe  
I just want to stop  
I never want to live without you babe  
I just gotta stop  
For your love  
  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
When I think about the way the world must turn the world must turn  
I get the saddest thoughts for you and me you and me  
Memories of life and times go on and on  
Ooh Ive tried hard to forget it  
But oh Lord my mind wont let it  
  
I just want to stop  
And tell you what I feel about you babe  
I just want to stop  
The world aint right without you babe  
I just gotta stop  
For your love  
  
Oh Ive tried so hard to take it  
But oh Lord my heart wont make it  
  
I just want to stop  
And tell you what I feel about you babe  
I just want to stop  
The world aint right without you babe  
I just want to stop  
For your love  
  
Stop Ooh ooh ooh  
I just want to stop Ooh ooh ooh  
I just want to stop  
And tell you what I feel about you babe  
I just want to stop  
The world aint right without you babe  
I just want to stop Ooh ooh ooh  
I just want to stop
