As I walk this land of broken dreams  
I have visions of many things  
But happiness is just an illusion  
Filled with sadness and confusion  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love thats now departed  
I know Ive got to find  
Some kind of piece of mind maybe  
  
If roots of love grow all around  
But for me they come tumblin down  
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger  
I cant stand this pain much longer  
  
I walk in shadows searching for light  
Cold and alone no comfort in sight  
Hopin and prayin for someone to care  
Always movin and goin nowhere  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love thats now departed  
I know Ive got to find  
Some kind of piece of mind  
Incomprehensible help me please  
  
Im searchin though I dont succeed  
But someones love theres a growin need  
All is lost theres no place for beginning  
All thats left is an unhappy ending  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love thats now departed  
I know Ive got to find  
Some kind of piece of mind  
Ill be searchin everywhere  
Just to find someone to care  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love thats now departed  
Ill be searchin everywhere  
Just to find someone to care  
Help oh help me please  
  
What becomes of the broken hearted  
Who had love thats now departed  
Ill be searchin everywhere  
Just to find someone to care
