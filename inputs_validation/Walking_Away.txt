The day I left you was the worst mistake I ever made  
Was ready to become something I didnt need you dragging me down  
Thought your love just wasnt enough  
My hair combed nice shoes tied tight  
  
Was ready to conquer life  
Help unwanted I can do this on my own and then I found myself wounded  
Tripping over myself falling and scraping my knee  
Sadness fills for I know Ive failed  
  
Why did I leave scared to go back  
Hoping youll take me in with open arms  
But also know the hurt Ive caused  
The breeze of angel wings  
  
Standing there a midst of lowers of every being  
Tears grow and orchestra begins to play  
What a beautiful day why are you alone  
Run child its time for you to go home  
  
Wounded spirit face in the dirt  
I cry out for you to take me in  
Your heart holds me close and  
I look up to face this world which so scares me  
  
Faith in you loneliness just seems to fade  
The man once inside now a child walking in your footsteps  
Hoping held leaves under feet from the trees of fall  
Listening to autumns call  
  
A deep breathe to continue on fragile  
Depending on you Christ carrys me the rest of the walk
