Casey joins the hollow sound  
Of silent people walking down  
The stairway to the subway  
In the shadows down below  
  
Following the footsteps  
Through the neon darkened corridors  
Of silent desperation  
Never speakin to a soul  
  
The poisoned air hes breathin  
Has the dirty smell of dyin  
Cause its never seen the sunshine  
And its never felt the rain  
  
But Casey minds the arrows  
And ignores the fatal echoes  
Of the clickin of the turnstile  
And the rattle of his chain  
  
Oh she said  
Casey its been so long since Ive seen you  
Here she said  
Just a kiss to make a body smile  
  
See she said  
Ive put on new stockings just to please you  
Lord she said  
Casey can you only stay a while  
  
Casey leaves the underground  
And stops inside the Golden Crown  
For something wet to wipe away  
The chill thats on his bones  
  
Seein his reflection  
In the lives of all the lonely men  
Who reach for anything they can  
To keep from goin home  
  
Standing in the corner  
Casey drinks his pint of bitter  
Never glancin in the mirror  
At the people passin by  
  
Then he stumbles as hes leavin  
And he wonders if the reason  
Is the beer thats in his belly  
Or the tear thats in his eye  
  
Oh she said  
I suppose you seldom think about me  
Now she said  
Now that youve a family of your own  
  
Still she said  
Its so blessed good to feel your body  
Lord she said  
Casey its a shame to be alone
