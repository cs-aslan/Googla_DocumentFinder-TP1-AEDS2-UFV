Oh it really wasnt my intention  
To disregard convention  
It was just an impulse  
That had to be obeyed  
Though it seems convention weve been scorning  
Ill still not go in mourning  
Though my reputation  
Is blemished Im afraid  
With just one kiss  
What heaven what rapture what bliss  
Honestly I thought you wouldnt  
Naturally you thought you couldnt  
And probably we shouldnt  
But arent you kind of glad we did  
Actually it all was blameless  
Nevertheless theyll call it shameless  
So lets keep the lady nameless  
But arent you kind of glad we did  
Socially Ill be an outcast  
Obviously we dined alone  
On my good name there will be doubt cast  
With never a sign of any chaperon  
No matter how they may construe it  
Whether or not we have to rue it  
Whatever made us do it  
Say arent you kind of glad we did  
  
Whatever made us do it  
Say arent you kind of glad we did
