Intro Bertie McIntosh  
Its in the trees  
Its coming  
  
Verse 1 Kate Bush  
When I was a child running in the night  
Afraid of what might be  
Hiding in the dark hiding in the street  
And of what was following me  
Now hounds of love are hunting  
Ive always been a coward  
And I dont know whats good for me  
  
Chorus 1 Kate Bush  
Here I go  
Its coming for me through the trees  
Oh help me someone help me please  
Take my shoes off  
And throw them in the lake  
And Ill be two steps on the water  
  
Verse 2 Kate Bush  
I found a fox caught by dogs  
He let me take him in my hands  
His little heart it beats so fast  
And Im ashamed of running away  
From nothing real I just cant deal with this  
But Im afraid to be there  
Among your hounds of love  
And feel your arms surrounding me  
Ive always been a coward  
And never know whats good for me  
  
Chorus 2 Kate Bush  
Here I go  dont let me go  
Never let me go tie me to the mast  
Its coming for me through the trees  
Oh help me darling help me please  
Take my shoes off  
And throw them in the lake  
And Ill be two steps on the water  
  
Bridge Kate Bush  
I dont know whats good for me  
I dont know whats good for me  
I need love love love love love yeah  
Your love  
  
Chorus 3 Kate Bush  
Take your shoes off and throw them in the lake  
Do you know what I really need  
Do you know what I really need  
I need love love love love love yeah
