Oh Im looking at you  
Cant control myself  
Nothing but pain for me  
  
Wipe your tears from your eyes  
Just leave and forget me  
No need to be hurt anymore  
  
Go away from me now  
I dont know what is love  
No need to be hurt anymore  
  
You said I miss you so much  
Every night thinking of you  
And facing loneliness  
  
But when you feel sadness  
Never can I stay with you  
  
Im not the one you need  
Close your eyes and forget me  
Theres nothing I can do anymore  
  
I lost my way  
Ive been walking in the night of tears  
There I found someone was holding you  
As the night was falling down  
With my love also vanished my vision of you  
  
My heart is cold now  
Repeat  
You said I need you always  
Everyday thinking of you  
And living loneliness  
  
Repeat  
Repeat  
Cant find my way
