She takes my breath away  
My lady in red  
And I know the game she plays  
Always lining the red  
Shes got curves  
To make a grown man cry  
She blows my mind  
I will make her mine  
I will never cease  
Shes a beauty and a beast  
Oh lord she looks so fine  
My one and only queen  
And I love the way she shines  
My mean machine  
Wind in my hair  
Well fly without a care  
Its liquid speed  
This royal steed will never cease  
Shes a beauty and a beast  
Shes got curves  
To make a grown man cry  
She blows my mind  
I will make her mine  
I will never cease  
Shes a beauty and a beast  
guitar solo  
cmon  
And now she is unleashed  
This metal horse  
Were burning down the street  
A true tour de force  
Shes got curves  
To make a grown man cry  
She blows my mind  
I will make her mine  
I will never cease  
Shes a beauty and a beast
