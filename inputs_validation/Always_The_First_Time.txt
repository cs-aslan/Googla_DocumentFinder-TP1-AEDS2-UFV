Now Ive never stepped through the doors of a barroom or tasted the flavor of
wine  
And Ive never danced to the songs on a jukebox or held someone that wasnt
mine  
But theres always the first time and if you dont change  
Then I guess the first time cant be arranged cant be arranged  
 banjo   
Now Ive never dressed for the eyes of the stranger to sow seeds of lust in
his mind  
And Ive never walked down backroad of temptation to leave dirty footprints
behind  
But theres always the first time
