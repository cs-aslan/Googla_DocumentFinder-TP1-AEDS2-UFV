Sugarcult Pretty girlthe way  
  
Pretty girl is suffering while he confesses everything  
Pretty soon shell figure out what his intentions were about  
And thats what you get for falling again  
You can never get him out of your head  
And thats what you get for falling again  
You can never get him out of your head  
  
Its the way  
That he makes you feel  
Its the way  
That he kisses you  
Its the way  
That he makes you fall in love  
  
Shes beautiful as usual with bruises on her ego and  
Her killer instinct tells her to beware of evil men  
And thats what you get for falling again  
You can never get him out of your head  
And thats what you get for falling again  
You can never get him out of your head  
  
Its the way  
That he makes you feel  
Its the way  
That he kisses you  
Its the way  
That he makes you fall in love  
  
Its the way  
That he makes you feel  
Its the way  
That he kisses you  
Its the way  
That he makes you fall in lovelove
