Loving you this way  
Has made my tired heart sing  
Lady you touch my soul  
With all the love you bring  
  
Being so close to you  
Is where I want to be  
Dont turn your smile away  
Dont break my fantasy  
  
Summer lady  
You look good to me  
Summer lady  
Youre my fantasy  
  
Seeing your presence near  
Every time I wake  
My life would be incomplete  
If I didnt have you there  
  
Summer lady  
You look good to me  
Summer lady  
Youre my fantasy  
  
Laying here in my room  
With all my worldly things  
Dont make up for all my dreams  
Of you in my fantasy  
  
Summer lady  
You look good to me  
Summer lady  
Youre my fantasy  
Summer lady  
You look good to me  
Summer lady  
Youre my fantasy  
Please dont take my dreams away  
Oh summer lady
