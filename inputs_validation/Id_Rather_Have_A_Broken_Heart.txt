Id rather have a broken heart a two time love I want no part  
Id rather have Id rather have a broken heart  
Dont want to share that kind of love it aint the kind Im dreamin of  
Id rather have Id rather have a broken heart  
Im gonna kiss your love goodbye Id rather be a bird that flies  
Id rather search for better things than see a bird with broken wings  
The dreams Ive dreamed I tear apart Im gonna stop before I start  
Id rather have Id rather have a broken heart  
 guitar  fiddle   
Im gonna kiss your love goodbye
