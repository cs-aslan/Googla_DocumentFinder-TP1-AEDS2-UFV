Day after day  
Time pass away  
And I just cant get you out my mind  
Nobody knows  
I hide it inside  
I keep on searching  
But I cant find  
The courage to show  
To letting you know  
I never felt so much love before  
And once again  
Im thinking about  
Taking the easy way out  
  
Chorus  
But if I let you go  
I will never know  
Whats my life would be  
Holding you close to me  
Will I ever see  
You smiling back at me  
How will I know  
If I let you go  
  
Night after night  
I hear myself say  
What cant this feeling just fade away  
Theres no one like you  
Can speak to my heart  
Its just a shame we worlds apart  
Im too shy to ask  
Im too proud to lose  
But sooner or later  
Ive got to choose  
And once again  
Im thinking about  
taking the easy way out  
  
Chorus
