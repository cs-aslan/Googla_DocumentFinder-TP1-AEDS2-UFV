I was driving this morning and sat in traffic on the way to work work  
Soon as I got in my boss was tripping and acting like a freaking jerk jerk  
Me and my girl aint speak in weeks and I cant remember the reason why why
why  
On top of that its a recession I feel like JayZ this cant be life life  
  
Chorus  
Tonight Im leaving all my worries and my problems in the house  
Im going out with my homies and we gonna let it gonna let it  
All hang out let it all hang out  
Its the last day of the weekend boy I need to release  
And let it all hang out let it all hang out  
Im going out with my homies and we gonna let it all hang out  
  
Time for me to leave this place dont feel like its going to come come come  
I got bills on top of bills and I dont know where Im getting my money from
from  
The walls feel like their closing in  
I honestly dont feel like I can make it make it make it  
Im so mad and I cant take it thats why  
  
Chorus  
  
Me and JD chilling in the shack  
Sharing Chiclets from the same pack  
One hundred and eightyproof vitamin water  
Energy flavor  
Take us to your daughter  
I want to see you pretty ladies on the dance floor dance floor  
Put your hands up in the air like you dont care no more we dont care no
more  
We gonna hit the town tonight we were born to rock  
  
Chorus  
  
Let it all hang out  
Im going out with my homies and we gonna let it all hang out
