By the time I get to Phoenix hell be risin  
Hell find the note I left hangin on his door  
And hell laugh when he reads the part that says Im leavin  
Cause Ive left that man so many times before  
  
By the time I make Albuquerque hell be workin  
Hell probably stop at lunch and give me a call  
But hell just hear that phone keep on ringin  
Off the wall thats all  
  
By the time I make Oklahoma hell be sleepin  
Hell turn softly and call my name out low  
And hell cry just to think Id really leave him  
Though time and time Ive tried to tell him so  
Oh he just didnt know I would really go  
I would really go
