I thought it was over baby  
We said our goodbyes  
But I cant go a day without your face  
Goin through my mind  
  
In fact not a single minute  
Passes without you in it  
Your voice your touch memories of your love  
Are with me all of the time  
  
Let me let go baby  
Let me let go  
If this is for the best why are you still in my heart  
Are you still in my soul let me let go  
  
I talked to you the other day  
Looks like you made your escape  
You put us behind no matter how I try  
I cant do the same  
  
Let me let go baby  
Let me let go  
It just isnt right Ive been two thousand miles  
Down a deadend road  
  
Let me let go darlin wont you  
I just gotta know yeah  
If this is for the best why are you still in my heart  
Are you still in my soul let me let go  
  
The lights of this strange city are shinin  
But they dont hold no fascination for me  
I try to find the bright side baby  
But everywhere I look everywhere I turn youre all I see  
  
Let me let me let go baby wont you  
Let me let go  
It just isnt right Ive been two thousand miles  
Down a deadend road  
  
Oh let me let go darlin wont you  
I just gotta know  
If this is for the best why are you still in my heart  
Yeah youre still in my soul let me let go  
Let me let go let me let go
