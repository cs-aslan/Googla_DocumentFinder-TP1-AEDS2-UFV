You ask me baby  
Can you work tonight  
Ive been up babe  
Since broad daylight  
  
I just cant believe  
That youre sellin me  
You never sold me before  
I just cant recall  
Youre like a whore  
  
Oh yeah Im bad tonight  
You really like my style  
If you want me  
Cant even buy my smile  
  
Now I find come around  
Just to lay this money on you babe  
Im sick of tradin tricks and dicks  
And Im Im really sick of you  
Oh I   
  
Never been sold before  
And Ill never be hurt again  
No I never been sold before  
And Ill never be hurt again  
  
I just cant believe  
That youre sellin me  
You never sold me before  
I just cant recall  
You little whore no no no no no  
  
Never been sold before  
And Ill never be hurt again  
No I never been sold before  
And Ill never be hurt again  
  
Never been sold before  
And Ill never be hurt again  
No I never been sold before  
And Ill never be hurt again
