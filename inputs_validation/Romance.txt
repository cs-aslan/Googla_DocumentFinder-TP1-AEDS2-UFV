You said you were through with romance  
Why take a chance on anyone  
Youre so beautiful too  
I can tell by the way that you dance  
They say that people dont change  
Why rear range the original  
You do something to me  
That my eyes cannot see at a glance  
Signs of a new beginning  
Signs of a life worth living  
The better to forget than to be all that upset  
Its the time to taste the wine  
And maybe someday things will change  
And come with in range and be laughable  
Everything is okay  
I can tell by the way that you dance  
They say that people dont try  
Thats just a lie they work miracles  
Its a gift from above  
When we talk about love and romance  
Signs of a new tomorrow  
Signs of a life without sorrow  
The better to forget than to be all that upset  
Its the time to taste the wine  
And maybe this time you will be  
Romantic like me when Im with you  
And I think you might say  
I can tell by the way that you dance  
They say that people dont change  
Like Home On The Range its original  
You do something to me  
That my eyes cannot see at a glance  
You do something to me  
When we talk about love and romance
