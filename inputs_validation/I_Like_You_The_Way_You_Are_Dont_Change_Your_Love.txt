  
Oh stop dont change that smile honey  
That you wear up on your face  
Take it up with makeup girl  
I just know youre in the place  
When I look at you  
All my dreams come true  
My future girl in you I see  
Youve always been for real  
And thats good enough for me  
  
I like you the way you are girl  
Baby dont change your love on me  
I like you the way you are girl  
Baby dont change your love on me  
Dont change  
Dont change  
Dont change ooh baby  
Just be yourself  
  
Oh stop dont change the recipe honey  
What a sweet sweet love you make  
Believe me girl that losing you  
Would be much than I could take  
Your loving I got used to I need it bad  
Dont give me girl no substitute  
Im begging you please dont change your love on me  
  
Oh I like you the way you are girl  
Baby dont change your love on me  
I like you the way you are girl  
Baby dont change your love on me  
Dont change  
Baby dont change it  
Baby dont change it  
Baby dont change it

Baby dont change your love on me  
Baby dont change it
