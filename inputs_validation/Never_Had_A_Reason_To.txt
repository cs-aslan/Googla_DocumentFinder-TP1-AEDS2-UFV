All the girls I grew up with  
Got a husband house and kids  
Thats what everybody did after school  
If Id a had a steady boyfriend  
I mighta stuck around like them but  
Back then I never had a reason to  
LAs like another planet  
Had to live there to understand it  
And I thought when I first landed that Californias cool  
Till I saw good girls gettin outta control  
Endin up sellin their souls  
Oh no I never had a reason to  
I never had a reason to stay  
To not walk away  
Nobodys heart was gonna break over me  
I never had somethin worth keepin  
Or somebody I needed  
Like Im needin you  
Baby dont you see its true  
I never had a reason to believe in love  
To some love comes as a vision  
To some its a sweet baptism  
Me and love had a headon collision  
When I ran into you  
Got some feelings Im figurin out  
No I dont know exactly how  
Until now I never had a reason to
