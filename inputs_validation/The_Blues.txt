All the love in the world couldnt save you  
All the innocence inside  
You know I tried so hard to make you  
To make you change your mind  
  
And it hurts too much to see you  
And how you left yourself behind  
You know I didnt want to meet you  
Now theres a hell I cant describe  
  
So now I wander through my day  
Trying to find my way  
Still these feelings that I felt  
I said to you and no one else  
  
And no its not going to change  
I know its gone still Im used  
And thats nice to hang on someone  
A change thats bittersweet  
  
Thats called the blues  
  
Dont know just what I should do  
Everywhere I go I see you  
You know its what you planned this much is true  
What I thought was beautiful dont live inside of you anymore  
  
I dont know just what I should do  
Everywhere I go I see you  
You know its what we planned this much is true  
What I thought was beautiful dont live inside of you anymore  
  
What this means to me  
The more I know you believe  
What I thought was you now  
Has got more that it changed on you  
  
What I thought was true  
The more that I might know is you  
What I thought was you  
Is only memories distant
