Theres something I must say  
Something I must do  
I planned it all this way  
Designed it just for you  
Do you want to be with me  
Be with me at all  
Do you have to be so cool  
Your gentle touch maneuvered me  
But all the time I always knew  
  
Im really mad about you  
Theres nothing bad about our love  
Im giving you the only heart I have  
But Im afraid tonight it wont be enough  
  
Can we go on this way  
Theres nothing left to prove  
Its not another game  
Or another simple move  
Do you believe in me  
Believe in me at all  
Are you telling me the truth  
Is it just imagination  
Or the perfect dream  
That Im here with you  
  
Im really mad about you  
Theres nothing bad about our love  
Im giving you the only heart I have  
But Im afraid tonight it wont be enough  
  
Im really mad about you  
Theres nothing bad about our love  
Ive never had a broken heart before  
But I know youll never tear mine apart
