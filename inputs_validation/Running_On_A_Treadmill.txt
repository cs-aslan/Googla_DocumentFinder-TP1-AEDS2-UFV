Youve got me so Im running round and round in circles  
Youve got me so I cant see my own face  
Youve got me so I feel like Ive been like this forever  
Youve got me so Im crazy with disgrace  
Chorus  
I know whats on your mind  
But its not what you think it is  
I know whats on your mind  
But its not what you think it is  
Im running on a treadmill after you  
Im running on a treadmill now  
Im running on a treadmill after you  
Im running on a treadmill now  
Youve got me so Im running round and round in circles  
Youve got me so I cant see my own face  
Youve got me so I feel like Ive been like this forever  
Youve got me so Im crazy with disgrace  
Repeat Chorus
