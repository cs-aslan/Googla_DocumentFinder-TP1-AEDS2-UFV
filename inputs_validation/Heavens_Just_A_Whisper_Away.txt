Watching raindrops slowly falling  
Painting pictures on the window pane  
Feelings my heart cannot explain  
Oh the silence sounds like music  
Seems like I can hear a melody  
Baby thats what you do to me  
  
chorus  
One thing Im sure of  
Whether its wrong or its right  
I only want to be with you tonight  
And if you want me to  
Baby ask me to stay  
Heavens just a whisper away  
  
Feel the magic taking over  
Please dont stop before we lose control  
Baby just let your feeling go  
Soft and tender like the morning  
We get closer than weve ever been  
Were almost to the rainbows end  
  
chorus  
I heard the winds of forever  
Calling out my name  
Its paradise when Im with you  
I will never be the same  
  
Please dont wake me if Im dreaming  
cause this time this one is coming true  
So glad to share my dreams with you  
  
chorus
