Ive been lookin for a love  
Someone to hold as I lay sleeping  
Im not talking about someone whos scared of promises or keeping up  
Im just looking for a love to stand the test of time  
Ive been lookin for someone to be all mine  
  
I had too much lonely  
I need a one and only  
Someone I can care about and call my own  
Well in true tradition  
Without an intermission  
Well still be together when the kids are grown  
  
Ive been lookin for a love  
Someone to hold as I lay sleeping  
Im not talking about someone whos scared of promises or keeping up  
Im just lookin for a love to stand the test of time  
Ive been looking for someone to be all mine
