If you tell me what to do  
I could do it quite well  
Give detailed desires Id be tryin like hell  
You could leave a little clue  
I would follow it through  
You got to say somethin  
If theres anything you want me to do  
  
Let me be the slave you can faithfully flog  
Let me be your dog  
  
I got no way aknowin what show is in town  
I could be your pacifier  
I could be your favorite hound  
Just gimme some proof Ill deliver in style  
On a hot tin roof Ill be burnin the tiles  
  
Let me be the friend of a friend  
Of a stepmothers brother  
Of the slave you can faithfully flog  
Let me be your dog  
  
Roll me right over Ill crawl and Ill beg  
Casanova rover bitin your leg  
Cause what goes around comes around  
Simple as that  
Youd be doin yourself a favor  
Cuttin the crap  
  
Let me be your crossbreed off the lead  
Chasin my tail  
I could make you feel better  
Like a check in the mail  
Like a pollposition for the closin down sale  
Like a hog in a synagogue  
Let me be your dog  
  
Call me Rover  
Let me be your dog  
Cmon baby Ill be good  
Like I know I could  
Let me be your dog  
Hey baby please baby  
Let me be your dog
