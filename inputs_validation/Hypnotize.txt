I want to hypnotize you baby  
On the telephone  
So many times I called your house  
Just to hear the tone  
And though I knew that you werent home  
I didnt mind so much cause Im so alone  
I want to hypnotize you baby  
On the telephone  
  
I want to spin my little watch  
Right before your very eyes  
Youre the kind of girl  
A guy like me could hypnotize  
And if this comes as a surprise  
Just think of all of those guys  
Who would tell you lies  
I want to spin my little watch  
Right before your eyes  
  
I want to hold your little hand  
If I can be so bold  
And be your right hand man  
Til you hands get old  
And then when all the feelings gone  
Just decide if you want to keep holding on  
I want to hold your little hand  
If I can be so bold  
If I can be so bold  
If I can be so bold
