Your way  
No way  
Do it my way  
Or hit the highway  
Your way  
No way  
Do it my way  
Or hit the highway  
  
I respect your point of view  
Youve got your thoughts  
Ive got mine too  
But youll be out of here  
If I dont hear the words I want to hear  
  
Your way  
No way  
You do it my way  
Or you can hit the highway  
  
Ive watched you  
Backsliding  
Then theres trouble  
You your always hiding  
  
Now if I was in your shoes  
I might look at me and think  
Theres a fool  
But Im not in your shoes  
And I dont have to play  
By your set of rules no no  
  
Your way  
Let me tell you that theres no way  
No way you do it my way  
Or you can hit the highway  
Hit it again  
  
Your way  
No way  
Do it my way  
Or hit the highway  
Im stating not negotiating  
You want more  
Theres the door
