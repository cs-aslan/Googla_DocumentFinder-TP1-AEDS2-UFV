I know you think youre all alone  
I havent been there when you needed me  
I didnt deserve the love you gave  
But now Im telling you Im here if you need a friend  
  
Give me your pain  
Give me your anger  
Let me be your rock  
I can be the pillar of strength that you need  
I help you keep it all together  
Its better late than never  
Lay your world on me  
I can take the weight  
  
Dont let it twist you up inside  
Time never fails to make the heartache stop  
Youve gotta let those feelings go  
Ill give you everything I can  
If you say the word  
  
Give me your pain  
Give me your anger  
Let me be your rock  
I can be the pillar of strength that you need  
I help you keep it all together  
Its better late than never  
Lay your world on me  
I can take the weight  
  
We all live and we all cry  
We all hurt the same inside  
We all fall down  
Then we lose faith and who we really are  
But if we bend instead of break  
The choice for us is to make it together  
Lay your world on me  
  
I help you keep it all together  
Its better late than never  
Lay your world on me  
Lay your world on me  
Lay your world on me  
I can take the weight
