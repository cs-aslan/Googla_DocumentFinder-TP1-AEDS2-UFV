M Greaves  
  
You should be a singer  
I swear its true  
Noone could make them  
Cry like you  
Billie Holliday would pale beside you  
Cos you sure got a way with the blues  
  
See you around dressed to thrill  
Smile for me baby  
If looks could kill  
I bet your boyfriends dont have a clue  
That youve sure got a way with the blues  
  
Here I am  
With my souvenirs  
Standing in the wreckage of eight sweet years  
I bet everything in your life must be brand new  
Cos youve sure got a way with the blues  
  
You should be a singer  
I swear its true  
Noone could make them cry like you  
Billie Holliday Patsy Kline too  
I bet even Bessie Smith would pale beside you  
Cos youve sure got a way with the blues  
Oooh with the blues
