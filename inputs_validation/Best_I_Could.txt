I cant apologize for the way I feel  
Cause Ive always been honest with you  
Ive loved you the best I could  
In the only way I knew  
And If thats not enough Ive got nothin to say  
And Im not even sure that I would  
Somedays it was bad and somedays good  
But Ive loved you the best I could  
  
I need more I need someone to hold me tonight  
Someone there when I turn out the lights  
Just to be here with me  
I need more  
I need more than you somehow  
I need more than your time will allow  
I want you as my friend  
Why cant you be that now  
  
You say you need me then youd be gone  
The times I needed you  
Then youd hold me and say youre sorry  
But what else could you do  
Yet I know you really loved me  
So its hard to let go like I should  
Lets forget the bad  
Remember the good  
Cause you loved me the best you could  
  
But I need more  
I need someone to hold me tonight  
Someone there when I turn out the light  
Just to be here with me  
I need more I need more than you somehow  
I need more than your time will allow  
Remember the times that were good  
We both loved the best we could
