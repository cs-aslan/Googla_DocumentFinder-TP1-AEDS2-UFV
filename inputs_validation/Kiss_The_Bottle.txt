It gets loneliest at night  
Down at the liquor store  
Beneath the neon sky  
Our moonlight  
Six AM the floor comes alive with lice  
The pans dried up so tight  
With hardened beans  
Were hungry  
So I lean on you sometimes  
Just to see youre still there  
Your feet cant take the weight of one  
Much less two  
We hit concrete  
How were we born into this mess  
I know I painted you a prettier picture baby  
But we were run out on a rail  
Fell from the wagon to the night train  
I kissed the bottle  
I shouldve been kissing you  
You wake up to an empty night  
With tears for two  
Cigarettes they fill the gaps  
In our empty days  
In our broken teeth  
Were jonesing  
Say mister can you spare a dime  
Some change could make a change  
Could buy some time  
Some freedom  
Or an ear to hear my story  
Its all Ive got My fiction  
Beats the hell out of my truth  
A palm upturned burnt blue  
Dont call it sunburn  
Youve been shaking on the job  
Just one drink ahead of your past  
Theres a white light coming up  
You draw the blinds hoping itll pass  
I kissed the bottle  
I shouldve been kissing you  
You wake up to an empty night  
With tears for two  
I kissed the bottle  
I shouldve been kissing you  
You wake up to an empty night  
With tears for two  
I kissed the bottle  
I shouldve been kissing you  
You wake up to an empty night  
With tears for two
