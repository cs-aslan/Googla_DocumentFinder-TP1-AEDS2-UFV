I know a cabin down there in Tennessee  
Where you cant find the forest on account of the trees  
And Old Perry Foster he got something to say  
And you can smell the pigs cause they been cookin all day  
  
Chorus x2  
I dont need no critics  
I dont need no suits  
I just need somebody who can tell me the truth  
You can keep your opinions  
You can keep on walkin  
Im gonna raise my glass yeah to Thunderhead Hawkins  
  
Miss Mary Jane she always looks like a star  
But the rock n roll banker likes to sleep in his car  
You wont hear no opry youll hear six strings  
And you wont know what to do when you hear Thunderhead sing  
  
Chorus  
  
Now Mr Hawkins got a family tree  
He got that their legendary cabin down in Tennessee  
You know hell hook up that guitar everybody gather round  
You stay close to the fire when the sun goes down  
Old Brother Merle hes always waiting in the wings  
Only man up in them woods wearin all them gold rings  
Old Mr Hawkins he wont do nobody wrong  
But hell hell tear your heart out with one sad song  
  
Chorus
