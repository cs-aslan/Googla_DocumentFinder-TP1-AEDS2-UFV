Ill crawl for you  
Hurt if you want to  
Ill be the thing that you feed  
  
Im not asking  
For love or redemption  
Ill sell my guilt to your need  
  
Ill breathe for you  
Die if you want to  
Ill mourn with you by my grave  
  
I dare you to judge me  
Now God has disowned me  
Ive come to you to be saved  
  
They say I  
Sold my soul  
And we all reap  
What we sow  
  
Ill shine for you  
Burn if you want to  
Youll be the prize for my pain  
  
Ill kill your God  
And pray for salvation  
Ill be the in to your sane  
  
Ill lie for you  
Be your conscience in you  
Sacrifice reason for shame  
  
I wont ask for  
Faith or forgiveness  
Ill be the blood in your veins  
  
They say I  
lost my way  
Ill wait for  
Judgment day  
  
Dont pray for my soul  
Dont pray for my soul  
Dont pray for my soul  
Dont pray for my soul  
  
Ill be your darkness  
In the night  
Ill be a vampire calling  
In the dead of night  
  
Ill be your demon  
Shadow man  
Ill be your one confession  
  
And if I can  
Ill be your nightmare  
And scream for you  
Ill be your one possession  
If you want me to  
  
Ill be your secret  
Memory  
Ill be your exhibition of atrocity  
  
They say I  
Sold my soul  
And we all reap  
What we sow  
  
They say I  
Lost my way  
Ill wait for  
Judgment day  
  
Dont pray for my soul  
Dont pray for my soul  
Dont pray for my soul  
Dont pray for my soul  
  
They kneel down praise God  
Shout Hallelujah  
Lift up their eyes while they pray  
  
When children kill children  
Dont it make them wonder  
Dont it make them question their faith
