Long view on the eye a pocketful a pestilence  
Got a fistful of memoriesa long lost innocence  
Hey baby dead baby devil he embracin you  
With a long forkedtonguekiss  
Suckin all the life from you  
  
If you need to reach me  
Im breaking one through ten  
And if you really need me  
Can I get an amen  
  
Passion on a  gotta get it while its not  
With a selfcentered psychopath givin a forgetmenot  
Rape me rape me everybody gets in line  
With a long forkedtonguekiss  
Sucked away the rest of time  
  
If you need to reach me  
Im breaking one through ten  
And if you really need me

Longview in your eye  
Seal it with a kiss you get the  
Long forked tongue kiss  
Memory in your fist seal it with a kiss  
You get the  
Long forked tongue kiss  
  
Lay on down in the bed you made  
Its a little too late to cry  
Or too be afraid  
  
Driven by the high heat call it love  
Driven by the high heat  
Of the velvet glove  
  
Call it freewillcall it choice  
You know you aint alone now  
Theres a second voice  
When youre not alone
