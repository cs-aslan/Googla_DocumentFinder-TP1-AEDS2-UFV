I got a rock n roll band  
I got a rock n roll life  
I got a rock n roll girlfriend  
And another exwife  
  
I got a rock n roll house  
I got a rock n roll car  
I play the shit out the drums  
And I can play the guitar  
  
I got a kid in New York  
I got a kid in the Bay  
I havent drank or smoked nothin  
In over 22 days  
  
So get off of my case  
Get off of my case  
  
Off of my case
