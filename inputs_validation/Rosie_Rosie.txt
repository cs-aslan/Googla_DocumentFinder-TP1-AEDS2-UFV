rosy wont you please come home  
Rosy wont you please come home  
Mama dont know where youve been  
Rosy wont you please come home  
Your rooms clean and no ones in it  
Oh my rosy how I miss you  
You are all the world to me  
Take a look and see if you like it  
If you like it please come back  
Rosy wont you please come home  
Since you joined the upper classes  
You dont know us anymore  
Live and let your trouble pass  
Rosy rosy where are you tell me  
If you dont want to come back  
I will sacrifice all I have  
To have a happy home once more  
Rosy wont you please come home  
Two long years have passed away  
Since you tried to change your life  
Christmas wasnt quite the same  
Rosy rosy got any answers   
You are miles across the sea  
And Ill bake a cake if you tell me  
You are on the first plane home  
Rosy wont you please come home  
Mama dont know where youve been  
Rosy wont you please come home  
Your rooms clean and no ones in it  
Oh my rosy how I miss you  
You are all the world to me  
Take a look and see if you like it  
If you like it please come home  
Rosy
