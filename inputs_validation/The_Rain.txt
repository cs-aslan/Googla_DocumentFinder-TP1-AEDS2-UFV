Every mans bound to fall  
Every mans bound to fall  
  
Pain inside my heart  
Trouble stay on my mind  
Everything falls apart  
Its happenin all the time  
Livin by Murphys Law  
Tryin to have it all  
Running from instant karma  
Every mans bound to fall  
  
Life is short the grind is long  
Some of my very best friends are gone  
My hustles strong my moneys all spent  
On buying bitches titties and drugs and rent  
Work a double shift grind I cant save a dime  
My daughter needs medicine I just cant afford  
Bout to grab a 9 lose my mind  
My insurance keeps sayin that they wont pay for it  
Ill stage the heist Ill pay the price  
Dont be shocked when I turn to crime kid  
Im goin big I might split your wig  
Cause I aint getting knocked for no nickelndime shit  
All that glitters aint all it seems  
The American dream is an American scheme  
What youre looking at what youre trippin on  
Who you flippin on see what Im grippin on  
  
Pain inside my heart  
Trouble stay on my mind  
Everything falls apart  
Its happenin all the time

Ive been breakin my neck just to live correct  
Keep my head above water living check to check  
I get no respect I got no regard  
Patience is a struggle when times is hard  
Papers in the shortage tryin to pay the mortgage  
I cant get to work they repossess my car  
Bout to buy a pistol and kidnap Bristol  
Tell me bitch can you see me from your backyard  
This New World session of the Great Depression  
Im living off preemptive unchecked aggression  
Youre cryin and youre bitchin know it every politician  
My family tradition is heavy ammunition  
I cock the hammer Ima rock the vote  
Got your forhead on lock dead in my scope  
Look me in the eye what youre lying for  
What youre living by what you dyin for  
  
Pain inside my heart  
Trouble stay on my mind  
Everything falls apart  
Its happenin all the time
