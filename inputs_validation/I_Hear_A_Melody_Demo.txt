Its easy to do its not so easy to say  
I was talking to you when you took my tongue away  
I hear a melody and I feel so ashamed  
I got nothing youd need and youre so hard to blame  
  
I hear a melody I hear a melody  
I hear a melody and youre so hard to blame  
  
You will never work out I know thats easy to see  
So the way that I want you to stay is hidden in me  
Youll never know the fool Im feeling tonight  
But its best that you never know cause I know its not right  
  
I hear a melody I hear a melody  
I hear a melody and I know its not right  
  
I hear a melody I hear a melody  
I hear a melody and I know its not right
