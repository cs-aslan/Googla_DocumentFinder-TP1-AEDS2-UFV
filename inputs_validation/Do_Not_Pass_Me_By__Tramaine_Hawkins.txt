Pass me not Oh gental savior  
Hear my humble cry  
While the others thou are calling  
Do not pass me by  
  
Ive got the feelin and the feelins not the same  
I did the hip hop a little hammer and the james  
But a touch a touch from up above  
And I get the feelin the feelin of your love  
Reachin out reachin out  
Callin for your people  
To keep us all safe from a world thats full of evil  
Tryin cryin  
Lord sometimes Im cryin  
When I think of his gifts and the world jusk keeps denying  
  
When I think of his goodness and what hes done for me  
My soul cries Hallelujah  
Thanks for savin me sing  
  
Savior savior why dont you  
Hear my humble cry  
  
While the others thou are calling  
Do not pass me by  
  
dance break  
  
I dont want the lord to pass me by 7  
  
Ii need him  
At home  
At work  
At school  
Do you need him  
I know you need him  
  
While the others thou are calling  
Do not pass me by  
  
Do not pass me by
