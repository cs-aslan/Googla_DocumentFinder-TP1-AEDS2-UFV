You have this way of making me say the opposite of everything I mean  
I kiss you I hug you but I could not feel less connected from you  
I know I want it all this in the beginning I really tried  
I know I could not so happy time of your life  
My dreams are bigger than all your junky pride  
I dont quit fit the part of everything and falls into insanity  
The sun beams mean nothing if you cant find the light shining in one thing  
I know I want it all this in the beginning I really tried  
I know I got you and Im not so happy time of your life  
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride  
Its fine if youre hateful as long as you remain grateful  
It made me nervous like me I really tried  
The way Im feeling in this moment it cant last my whole life  
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride aa
