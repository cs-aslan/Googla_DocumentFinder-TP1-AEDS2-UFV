I see you nearly everyday  
I see you but you dont see me  
I wish I had something clever to say  
And I wish I had something better I could be  
  
We touched hands by the coffee machine the other day  
I know youve forgotten already  
But Im gonna take that moment to the grave  
To the grave  
  
Cuz I just wanna walk you home  
I just wanna walk you home  
Oh yea  
  
I see you nearly every night  
I see you when youre down in your house  
With my night vision binoculars  
I creep quiet as a mouse  
  
And I get jealous when I see you stroking his hair  
But its okay I tell myself cause I know  
Its only Im not there  
Im not there  
  
Cuz I just wanna walk you home  
I just wanna walk you home  
Well I just need some time alone  
I just need some time alone  
  
Im the boy who watches the phone  
Im the boy who eats lunch on his own  
Im the boy with the monotone  
Im the boy who still lives at home  
  
Im the boy with the ironed shirt  
Im the boy who watches you work  
I know where you keep your skirts  
I know where your secrets lurk  
  
Im the boy thats calling your house  
Im the boy thats freaking you out  
With my thermal flask of tea  
Up there in your neighbors tree  
  
Im the boy thats crossing borders  
Im the boy with social disorders  
Im the boy with restraining orders  
Im the boy yeah  
  
Cuz I just wanna walk you home  
I just wanna walk you home  
And I know thats it not right to creep  
But I just wanna watch you sleep alone  
  
Cuz I just wanna walk you home  
I just wanna walk you home
