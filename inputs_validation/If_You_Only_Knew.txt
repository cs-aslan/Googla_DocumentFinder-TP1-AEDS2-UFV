So here you are again  
Standing at my door  
You know Id understand  
Well thats what friends are for  
  
Whats he done this time  
What did he say  
To make you so darn mad  
That youre running away  
Now you say you want to be like me  
Independent and free  
  
Chorus  
But if you only knew  
What a single girl goes through  
The long working days and the lonely nights  
The empty I love yous  
Oh if you only knew what its like to be alone  
Youd put your anger down  
Turn around and go back home  
  
My life looks good to you  
Im always in control  
No one to answer to  
But no one there to hold  
You see in my eyes you are the lucky one  
With loving arms that you can lean upon  
Id give anything I could to say  
What youre throwing away  
  
Cause  
  
Chorus  
  
I know its hard to face that love aint perfect everyday  
But I know a hundred girls who would gladly take your place  
  
So  
  
Chorus  
  
Youd put your anger down  
Turn around and go back home  
If you only knew
