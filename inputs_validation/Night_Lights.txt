Night lights those bluesinthenight lights  
Are no longer bright lights since Im without you  
Sweet dreams oh where did they fly to  
Youre gone and who can I cry to  
  
Those night lights remind me of bright eyes  
And beautiful white lies too good to be true  
As I go on my way with all my heart I pray  
That those night lights will lead me to you  
  
Those night lights remind me of bright eyes  
And beautiful white lies too good to be true  
As I go on my way with all my heart I pray  
That those night lights will lead me to you
