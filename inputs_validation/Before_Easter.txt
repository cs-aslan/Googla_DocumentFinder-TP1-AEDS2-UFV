I may beg  
Beg for money  
I may lie and lay my body down  
Sell what I would give with love  
One day before Easter comes  
But I wont let Jesus find me  
  
I walk I eat I sleep  
In these streets I may be found  
Alive or dead or just reborn  
One day before Easter comes  
But I wont let Jesus find me  
  
Jesus knows what Ive done  
I wont let him lift me up  
Before I can turn  
To look for him  
Before I can turn  
To look for him  
If Jesus comes around again  
  
Ill cry Ill cry  
Ill cry for help  
Ill let you be the one  
To try to redeem the sins of man  
One day before Easter comes  
But I wont let Jesus find me  
  
Im gonna hide  
Hide from him  
Hide myself but not the sin  
Im gonna hide  
Hide from him  
Hide myself but no the sin  
If Jesus comes around again  
Ive got the rock the needle  
The bottle of sorrow  
And Jesus Jesus Jesus knows
