It dont look good  
It dont look great  
You know whats going down you really gonna hate  
This is the moment you know the score  
This is what your enemies have waited for  
Youre going down  
And everybody knows thats the way it goes  
Take a look there aint no doubt about it  
Youre in real bad shape  
Everything that you dont need  
Is waiting at your garden gate  
So take a smile take a woe  
You got the rest of your life to wonder why and how  
Save that for later youre far too busy now  
Because  
Youre going down  
And everybody knows  
Thats the way it goes
