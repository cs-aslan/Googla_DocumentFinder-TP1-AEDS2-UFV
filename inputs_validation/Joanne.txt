Take my hand stay Joanne  
Heavens not  
Ready for you  
Every part  
Of my aching heart  
Needs you more  
Than the angels do

Verse 2  
If you could

We both know  
Things dont work that way  
I promised I  
Wouldnt say goodbye  
So I grin  
And my voice gets thin

And baby youre just movin on  
And Ill still love you even if I cant  
See you anymore  
Cant wait to see you soar
