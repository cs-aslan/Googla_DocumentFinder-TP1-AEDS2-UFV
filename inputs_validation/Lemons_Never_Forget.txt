Incidentally there should some changes made  
Youve got to work if you should have to save  
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget  
Youve got to play it cool before they come and throw the net  
  
Wait a while and straighten out the tie you wear  
Youve got to take it easy if you dare  
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget  
Youve got to play it cool before they come and throw the net  
  
Dont be blind youve got a thinking mind  
Stop the bells that ring so loud  
Dont nod your head youll draw a crowd  
Just think of everything youve worked so hard to bring  
The lemon sings my song  
Hes known it all along
