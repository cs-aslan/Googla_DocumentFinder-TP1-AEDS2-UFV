When Im down I make a call  
Got the number written on the wall  
First its busy then I try again  
Oh whos she talking to could it be him  
  
I got the number and it starts to ring  
I get excited and I start to dream  
I start to fantasize of memory lane  
Then she answers and she says right way  
She says Im home on my own home all alone  
So I got off the phone  
  
Shes tight Shes ahead of her time  
Shes tight Shes one of a kind  
Shes tight Shes a talented girl  
Shes tight Shes got her head down tight  
  
I have something got to say to you  
Amnesia and my train of thought  
On the tip tip of my tongue  
I had a vision when I was young  
  
You floated in we floated up  
Through the window and down the hall  
I had a smoke and went upstairs  
Turned the door and opened the key She spoke  
Im on my own home all alone  
So I got off the phone  
  
Shes tight Shes ahead of her time  
Shes tight Shes one of a kind  
Shes tight Shes a talented girl  
Shes tight Shes got her head down tight  
  
Shes tight Shes giving me the go  
Shes tight Shes giving me the high sign  
Shes tight Well turn off the lights  
Shes tight Pull down the shades  
Shes nice shes tight Turn on the camra  
Shes nice shes tight And getting ready for action  
  
Turn off the radio  
Turn on the video
