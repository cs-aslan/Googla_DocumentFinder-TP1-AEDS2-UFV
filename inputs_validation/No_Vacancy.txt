Im livin in a house on the other side of town  
Theyre makin a highway so theyre rippin my buildin down  
I gotta find a place within a week  
Or else Ill be sleepin out on the street  
Woe is me Im lookin for a vacancy  
  
All day long Im walkin round no vacancy  
Walkin up and walkin down no vacancy  
Ive been searchin round the town no vacancy  
No apartment to be found no vacancy  
On my dishwashers pay cant find a place to stay  
  
I found myself a place but the rent sure is a crime  
Its a cold water flat that was built in Lincolns time  
The paint is peelin right off of the wall  
Good golly the bathroom is in the hall  
Woe is me Im lookin for a vacancy  
  
I could budget myself scrimp and save to get along  
But it aint no fun givin up wine women and song  
So Ill have a roof up above my head  
But under those conditions I would rather be dead  
Woe is me Im lookin for a vacancy  
  
All day long Im walkin round no vacancy  
Walkin up and walkin down no vacancy  
Ive been searchin round the town no vacancy  
No apartment to be found no vacancy  
On my dishwashers pay cant find a place to stay  
  
All day long Im walkin round no vacancy  
Oh All day long Im walkin round no vacancy  
All day long Im walkin round no vacancy  
All day long Im walkin round no vacancy  
All day long Im walkin round no vacancy
