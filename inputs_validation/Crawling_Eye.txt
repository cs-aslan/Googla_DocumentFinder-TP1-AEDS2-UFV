Its such a steep climb up the mountains south side  
It has a cloud that acts in such peculiar ways  
Accident count rising a young girl prophesizing  
To protect their race theyll seize her mind  
  
At this altitude its freezing  
Aliens control human beings  
No one has lived to tell whos seen the crawling eye  
At this altitude its freezing  
Aliens control human beings  
No one has lived to tell whos seen the crawling eye  
  
These evil demon eyes under cloud cover hide  
They have great tentacles to tear apart their prey  
All these men are dying crawling eye decapitizing  
Fiends without a face attack mankind  
  
At this altitude its freezing  
Aliens control human beings  
No one has lived to tell whos seen the crawling eye  
At this altitude its freezing  
Aliens control human beings  
No one has lived to tell whos seen the crawling eye  
  
Crawling eye  
Crawling eye  
Crawling eye
