I recall how it used to be  
In my younger days  
I built a wall all around my heart  
To keep the pain away  
I built it tall and I built it wide  
I left no room for doubt  
Your love still found its way inside  
And couldnt get back out  
  
Im breaking down the barriers  
Making up my mind  
Im breaking down the barriers of time  
Im taking down the barriers  
And loving what I find  
Im breaking down the barriers that lie  
Between your love and mine  
  
I guess you know you were not the first  
You may not be the last  
But you have shown me a better way  
And now Im learning fast  
You gotta go where the feeling flows  
I take it while its hot  
You gotta give if you want to get  
And I want all you got
