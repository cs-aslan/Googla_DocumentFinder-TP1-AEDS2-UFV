Many heartaches have passed since we met  
Theres a kind that a heart cant forget  
And the sweet memories are too few  
While Im living my lifetime for you  
Im living my life for you  
Youre living to break me in two  
Id die while youre being untrue  
Still Im living my lifetime for you  
 guitar   
If ever there should come a time  
When you feel that youd like to die  
Well youve made me feel that way too  
But Im living my lifetime for you  
Im living my life for you
