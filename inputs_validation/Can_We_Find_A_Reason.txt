Is there anyone out there  
Willing to try   
Or are we satisfied with just getting by   
Weve hurt mother nature  
  
Cant you see her shes crying  
Weve robbed and weve raped her and taken her child  
And oh oh oh can we find a reason   
Just think about it  
  
And oh oh oh can we find a reason  
To live another season   
Were fighting more battles  
Everyday were alive  
  
We should be rejoicing  
But instead we cry  
This worlds so polluted  
You would think we were blind  
  
We poison our children  
Before theyre defined  
And oh oh oh can we find a reason   
Just think about it  
  
And oh oh oh can we find a reason  
To live another season  yeah  
Excuse me for saying  
Cause Ive never been shy  
  
But if we dont stop this  
We shonuff goin die  
Yes I hope we can make it  
Cause this rivers run dry  
  
Now our only battle  
Will be to survive hey  
And oh oh oh can we find a reason   
Come on and think about it  
  
And oh oh oh can we find a reason  
To live another season   
Yeah its the new millennium  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Can we find a reason  
To live another season   
And oh oh oh can we find a reason   
To live another season   
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah   
Its the new millennium  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah   
Can we find a reason  
  
To live another season
