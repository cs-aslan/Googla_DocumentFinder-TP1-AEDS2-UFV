Help Lord wont You come  
I cant call it but I know I got started  
Cause my mama was broke and I was broken hearted  
I can take tears and tears for years  
But the tears of my mama yo they get me right here  
So I broke out in a military step no deally no dally  
I walked I crept I slept on a plan that Id make it all good  
A young preacher if you could  
A young hustler from the hood  
Mama dont you cry dont you cry no more  
Ya baby boys blowin up and hes goin to war  
My mind is playin tricks and my dad is too  
High street bank boys its on fools  
Gonna make my moves and my moves I make  
You betta not get broke cause if you broke you break  
I dont hesitate that you cant see me  
Its gonna take the Lord to save you from me

I flipped the stress off good I let it rip  
Bank boys in the fat money grip yeah  
Rollin 5 deep and on fools we creep  
Half the town is down and you cant see me really dough  
Whats next A young fool on a flex  
Tryin to get a name some props or rep  
I stepped right to him let em know its all good  
Lights out now his crib is wood  
Broke for the dough but now I cant see  
Its blood on my hands my dog yo G  
I hit the flo but my heart didnt stop  
And now I see a vision of my son wit no pop  
My mamas on her knees  
Lord Lord no please  
And I feel cold and my health is cheatin  
Its gettin dark but yet and still  
Im half dead half life whats real  
I cant breathe but now Im startin to choke  
Off my own blood and not that indo smoke  
No joke straight up on a serious tip  
Im losin my life Im losin my grip I slip ssslip deeper still  
Help Lord help Lord Im losin my will  
To live low stuck at the bottom  
From winter to spring to summer to autumn  
Help Lord the homies in the hood  
The squares the Gs its all good  
Help Lord cause in the hood we sprung  
And we stuck right here until you come  
And bless the children of the ghetto life  
No love no hope no hope no life  
Help Lord help Lord help Lord help Lord  
You hear me callin Lord
