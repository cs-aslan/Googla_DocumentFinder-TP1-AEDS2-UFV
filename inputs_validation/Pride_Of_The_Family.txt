Young blood has got it shakin  
Growin up shes changin  
Shes so tough to try tame her  
These days she just wants to run wild  
  
Short skirt loves her make up  
Plays the flirt its daddys wake up  
Hes on the edge of teen age shake up  
Its so bad hes losing sleep at night  
  
Cause he was young once restless and free  
An apple doesnt fall far from a tree  
  
Shes the pride of the family  
Stands above the crowd makes them all believe  
Shes the pride of the family  
When its her time to fly  
Shes got love on her side  
  
Photographs of her childhood  
The years have passed  
Where did they run to  
Love still lasts the tears theyve been through  
Times a thief as precious moments fly by  
  
Dreamy eyes like her mama  
Her temper flies like her papa  
Her brothers cool and hes never been a bother  
But hes someone to turn to  
When life aint feelin right  
  
Hold on loosely but never let go  
The rest shell have to find out on her own  
  
Shes the pride of the family  
Stands above the crowd makes them all believe  
Shes the pride of the family  
When its her time to fly  
Shes got love on her side  
  
Hold on loosely but never let go  
The rest shell have to find out on her own  
  
Shes the pride of the family  
Stands above the crowd makes them all believe  
Shes the pride of the family  
When its her time to fly  
Shes got love on her side
