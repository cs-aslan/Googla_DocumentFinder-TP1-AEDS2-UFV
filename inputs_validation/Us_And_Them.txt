Us and them  
And after all were only ordinary men  
Me and you  
God only knows its not what we would choose to do  
  
Forward he cried from the rear  
And the front rank died  
The general is sat and the lines on the map  
Move from side to side  
  
Black and blue  
And who knows which is which and who is who  
Up and down  
And in the end its only round and round And round  
  
Havent you heard its a battle of words  
The poster bearer cried  
Listen son said the man with the gun  
Theres room for you inside  
  
Well I mean theyre gonna kill ya so like if you give em a quick
shshort sharp shock they dont do it again Dig it I mean he got off
light cause I coulda given im a thrashin but I only hit him once Its
only the difference between right and wrong innit I mean good manners dont
cost nothing do they eh  
  
Down and out  
It cant be helped but theres a lot of it about  
With without  
And wholl deny its what the fightings all about  
  
Out of the way its a busy day  
Ive got things on my mind  
For want of the price of tea and a slice  
The old man died
