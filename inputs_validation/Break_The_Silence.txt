What gets me through this  
What makes it worth it is the hope for a better day  
What you dont notice  
What you lost focus on is Im not the type to break  
  
Eight years of eggshell calloused feet  
Nine lives spent working on this dream  
Six feet under but breathin  
One drink to celebrate my pain  
Three drinks and Im brand new again  
One voice is all it takes and I wont stop  
  
I take the hit I feel the sting of another loss  
But while I gleam I keep on trying cause its just a matter of time  
I see the light even if its mine I wont back down  
Im gonna show you til you see me til you recognize this fire  
  
What I am chasing  
What I have faith in is that chance to test my wings  
What you dont know is  
What you lost focus on is Im not goin away  
  
Eight years of sittin on the bench  
Nine lives spent tangled in your web  
Six feet under but breathin  
One drink to celebrate my pain  
Three drinks and Im brand new again  
One voice is all it takes and I wont stop  
  
I take the hit I feel the sting of another loss  
But while I gleam I keep on trying cause its just a matter of time  
I see the light even if its mine I wont back down  
Im gonna show you til you see me til you recognize this fire  
  
So you keep on pushing and I keep on fighting  
You try and break me as I break the silence  
  
Picking myself off the ground it stings  
Trading comfort souls for dreams  
Is it what were made to be  
Trying so hard to make you see  
I dont need your hand I got my own  
There is no fear because its gone  
Im not gonna cry no more  
Im gonna stand up like Ive always done  
  
Eight years of eggshell calloused feet  
Nine lives spent working on this dream  
Six feet under but breathin  
I take the hit I feel the sting of another loss  
But while I gleam I keep on trying cause its just a matter of time  
I see the light even if its mine I wont back down  
Im gonna show you til you see me til you recognize this fire  
  
So you keep on pushing and I keep on fighting  
You try and break me as I break the silence  
You keep on pushing and I keep on fighting  
You try and break me as I break the silence
