Im not saying Im scared of you  
But your love is something new  
When I hold you were swaying in the wind  
Of all the bridges Ive ever crossed  
High and lonesome and wild and lost  
I feel this time Ill take it to the end  
We dont care what the people may say  
If theres a price its the price well pay  
  
Chorus  
And well burn that bridge when we come to it  
Burn that bridge when we come to it  
Burn that bridge when we come to it  
Burn it down  
Burn it down  
  
Weve both done our share of runnin around  
Now we know enough to know the kind of love  
weve found  
Its the real thing and weve got to see it through  
eIm a singer and a sailor on a midnight sea  
Oh captain come and take me on your fantasy  
If were crazy that aint nothin new  
Cause we dont care what the people may say  
If theres a price its the price well pay and  
  
Chorus  
  
Who knows how it started  
Who knows its ends  
The point of no return is waiting  
just around the bend
