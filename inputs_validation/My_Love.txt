An empty street  
An empty house  
A hole inside my heart  
Im all alone  
The rooms are getting smaller  
I wonder how  
I wonder why  
I wonder where they are  
The days we had  
The songs we sang together  
Oh yeah  
And all my love  
Were holding on forever  
Reaching for the love that seems so far  
  
So I say a little prayer  
Hope my dreams will take me there  
Where the skies are blue  
To see you once again my love  
Over seas from coast to coast  
Find the place I love the most  
Where the fields are green  
To see you once again my love  
  
I tried to read  
I go to work  
Im laughing with my friends  
But I cant stop  
To keep myself from thinking  
  
Oh no  
I wonder how  
I wonder why  
I wonder where they are  
The days we had  
The songs we sang together  
Oh yeah  
And all my love  
Were holding on forever  
Reaching for the love that seems so far  
  
So I say a little prayer  
Hope my dreams will take me there  
Where the skies are blue  
To see you once again my love  
Over seas from coast to coast  
Find the place I love the most  
Where the fields are green  
To see you once again  
  
To hold you in my arms  
To promise you my love  
To tell you from my heart  
Youre all Im thinking of  
And reaching for the love that seems so far  
  
So so I say a little prayer  
Hope my dreams will take me there  
Where the skies are blue  
To see you once again my love  
Over seas from coast to coast  
Find the place I love the most  
Where the fields are green  
To see you once again my love  
See you in a prayer  
Dreams will take me there  
Where the skies are blue  
To see you once again  
Over seas from coast to coast  
Find the place I love the most  
Where the fields are green  
To see you once again my love
