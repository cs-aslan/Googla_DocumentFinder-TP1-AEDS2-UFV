Since shes been gone I want no one to talk to me  
Its not the same but Im to blame its plain to see  
  
So go away leave me alone dont bother me  
I cant believe that she would leave me on my own  
Its just not right when every night Im all alone  
  
Ive got no time for you right now dont bother me  
I know Ill never be the same if I dont get her back again  
Because I know shell always be the only girl for me  
  
But till shes here please dont come near just stay away  
Ill let you know when shes come home  
Until that day  
  
Dont come around leave me alone dont bother me  
Ive got no time for you right now dont bother me  
I know Ill never be the same if I dont get her back again  
Because I know shell always be the only girl for me  
  
But till shes here please dont come near just stay away  
Ill let you know when shes come home  
Until that day  
  
Dont come around leave me alone dont bother me  
Dont bother me  
Dont bother me  
Dont bother me  
Dont bother me
