You were just a twinkle in your teenage mothers eyes  
I was squeezing brylcreem on my hair  
No one taught us how to be politically correct  
And no one told our winkles what to wear  
Ive been there Ive done it  
Ive seen it all  
That was my contribution oh oh  
So much for the revolution  
When someone said Lets go to bed nobody was scared  
We were up to no good all the time  
We were up to no good all the time  
Judging by those freckles and the shades upon your nose  
Its possible you could be one of mine  
Possible you could be one of mine  
Yeah  
Ive been there Ive done it  
Ive seen it all  
That was my revolution  
On the road again back at number ten  
Underneath the lights a thousand and one nights  
A revolution for fun  
Oh you better lock up your mum  
Ive been there Ive done it  
Well Ive seen them come and go  
Thats for you to guess  
And thats for me to know oh baby  
And thats for you to guess and thats for me to know  
Ah so much for revolution ah so much for revolution  
And that was my revolution oh revolution  
That was my revolution
