Today is the day  
For dancing and for singing  
The birds in the trees and all  
The bells are ringing  
The sun is in the sky  
Is bright as bright second light  
Is bright oh god I hope Im alright  
  
Cause Im gonna cry  
Hold on hold on  
Slow down slow down  
Youre out of touch  
Out of touch  
Cause there is no design for life  
Theres no devils haircut in my mind  
There is not a wonder wall to climb  
To climb or step around  
But there is a slide show and its so slow  
Flashing through my mind  
  
Today was the day  
But only for the first time  
Hold on hold on  
Slow down slow down  
Youre out of touch  
Out of touch  
  
Cause there is no design for life  
There is no devils haircut in your mind  
There is not a wonder wall  
To climb or step around  
But there is a sideshow and its so slow  
Flashing through my mind  
  
Today was the day  
But only for the first time  
I hope its not the last time
