Hello Salute its me your Duke  
And I made something thats real  
To show you how I feel  
  
Hello Hello its me Picasso  
I will paint my words of love  
With your name on every wall  
  
When you leave my colors fade to gray  
Whoa I whoa I aaa  
Whoa I whoa I whoa I aaa  
Every word of love I used to say  
  
Now I paint it everyday  
  
I sold my strings my songs and dreams  
And I bought some paints to match the colors of my love  
Hello Hello its me again Picasso  
I will spray my words of my love  
With your name on every wall  
  
When you leave my colors fade to gray  
Whoa I whoa I aaa  
Whoa I whoa I whoa I aaa  
Every word of love I used to say  
Now I paint it everyday  
  
When you leave my colors fade to gray  
Hey little lover stay  
Or all my colors fade away  
Every word of love I used to say  
Now I paint it everyday
