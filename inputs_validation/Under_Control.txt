Ill never forget that feeling  
When I watched you disappear  
And you made me stop believing  
I could fight away the fear  
  
Now the smoke has cleared and the end is near  
It was my illusion  
Like a broken dream I was incomplete  
But your love was never the missing key  
  
I feel like Im breathing again  
I feel like Im seeing again  
I feel like Im breathing again  
I got it under control oh oh  
I got it under control oh oh  
I got it under control oh oh  
  
All thats real is faded  
Like a car into the night  
Like a painkiller I take it  
And I watch the world ignite  
  
Now the smoke has cleared and the end is near  
It was my illusion  
Like a broken dream I was incomplete  
But your love was never the missing key  
  
I feel like Im breathing again  
I feel like Im seeing again  
I feel like Im breathing again  
I got it under control oh oh  
I got it under control oh oh  
I got it under control oh oh  
I got it under control oh oh  
  
I got it under control  
I got it under control  
  
I got it under control oh oh  
I got it under control oh oh  
I got it under control oh oh  
  
I feel like Im breathing again  
I feel like Im seeing again  
I feel like Im breathing again  
I got it under control oh oh  
I got it under control oh oh  
I got it under control oh oh  
I got it under control oh oh  
  
I got it under control oh oh  
I got it under control oh oh  
I got it under control oh oh  
I got it under control oh oh  
  
I got it under control  
I got it under control
