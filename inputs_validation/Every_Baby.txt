Every baby needs a mama needs a papa  
Close at hand  
Every baby needs a mama needs a papa  
To hold their hand  
  
I look in the eyes  
Of a beautiful child  
They tell me more than words  
He reaches his hand  
And cries for something  
Oh Ill give him all I have  
  
Every baby  
  
Birdies on the window  
See the birdies on my window  
If I could fly oh babe  
Then I would fly ooh ooh oh  
Believe me yaeh  
  
Im holding his hand  
And giving my love  
Through happiness and sorrow  
And in no time  
Hell be a big boy  
Oh what a wonder of love  
  
Everya baby  
  
Oh little baby youre not alone
