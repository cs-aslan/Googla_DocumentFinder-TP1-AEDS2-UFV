Some kids born with a silver spoon  
I guess that I was born a little too soon  
Hard knocks all I ever knew was hard knocks  
And Im telling you I said youd better beware  
Cause Ive had my share  
Some kids born as rich as a king  
But I was born without a doggone thing  
Hard knocks all I ever knew was hard knocks  
And Im telling you I said youd better beware  
Cause Ive had my share  
I walked a million miles I bet  
Tired and hungry and cold and wet  
Ive heard that lonesome whistle blow  
From New York City down to Mexico  
Some kids born fancy free  
Nobody never gave nothing to me but  
Hard knocks all I ever knew was hard knocks  
And Im telling you I said youd better beware  
Cause Ive had my share  
I walked a million miles I bet  
Tired and hungry and cold and wet  
Ive heard that lonesome whistle blow  
From New York City down to Mexico  
Some kids born fancy free  
Nobody never gave nothing to me but  
Hard knocks all I ever knew was hard knocks  
And Im telling you I said youd better beware  
Cause Ive had my share  
I said youd better beware  
Cause Ive had my share  
I said youd better beware  
Cause Ive had my share of hard knocks
