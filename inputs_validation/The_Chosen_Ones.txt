Marching across the desert sands  
Condemned to drift from land to land  
No food or water or heavens rain  
So many tears and so much pain  
Its a long road the nights are so cold  
A thousand miles from my home  
Now the wasteland becomes our homeland  
There is no peace for those who roamroam  
  
They call them the chosen ones  
But thats just a lie  
They call them the chosen ones  
Yet so many die  
If theyre the chosen ones  
Under the sky  
Who made them the chosen ones  
To suffer and die  
Only the pain here now is realso real  
  
Swords and arrows cannot defame  
When they invoke thy masters name  
The north star beckons beyond the gate  
To live in strife is their only fateoh  
A thousand miles but I still roamstill I roam  
A promise foretold the armies cant hold  
The burning secrets on the scrollstill I roamburn  
  
They call them the chosen ones  
But thats just a lie  
They call them the chosen ones  
Yet so many die  
If theyre the chosen ones  
Under the sky  
Why must these chosen ones  
Suffer and die  
Only the pain here now is realmarch  
A million miles away  
Ohmy god why have you forsaken me  
Ohwell never understand  
  
They call them the chosen ones  
But thats just a lie  
They call them the chosen ones  
Yet so many die  
If theyre the chosen ones  
Under the sky  
Who made them the chosen ones  
To suffer and die  
Only the pain here now is realmarch March  
Across the desertburning sandblack sunno rain  
Burning in the sandburn  
Only the pain only the pain only the pain keeps us alive  
The pain the pain keeps us alive  
Well never understand
