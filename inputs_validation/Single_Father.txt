Latley Ive been spendin lots of time with my kid  
Tellin him stories  
About the things that we did  
When we were a family  
  
Long time ago  
Ive answerd his questions  
Til Im blue in the face  
Wish all that hurt in him  
  
I could erase  
But I tell him the truth  
Cause he aint to young to know  
  
Chorus  
Single father  
Part time mother  
When Im not one  
Then Im the other  
You used to be  
My full time lover  
Now Im a single father  
And a part time mother  
I spend every minute  
I can with my boy  
Theres no doubt about it  
Hes my pride and joy  
  
Someday he will grow up  
And I wont have him no more  
Some things I just find  
Too hard to explain  
  
So we go to mcdonalds  
Or I buy him a train  
And we go put it together  
On the living room floor  
  
Such is the life  
Of a single father  
He says daddy explain  
If its not too much bother  
  
While its just you and me  
Living here in this home  
I dont understand it  
And neither does he  
  
Why theres just two  
When there should be three of us  
Sharing this moment  
Lord I feel so alone  
  
Chorus
