Im feeling lost  
Im feeling like my hearts  
Been carved out with a spoon  
Put on display for all to witness this decay of me and you  
  
Awaking and taking the cycle of breaking up  
To a whole new level  
Shaking and faking like youre making a hard choice not to settle  
Imbedded Im think headed  
I shredded all the letters you sent  
Dont get it whyd you let it get this far  
Lights out lights out Pass the herb  
Lights out lights out kiss the curb  
Lights out lights out your heart has turned  
Whos going to save me every time I crash and Burn  
And I crash and burn  
  
Im sick of endings  
Im done pretending  
I just want you back to normal  
I think you dont know just how you feel  
And every time you think of me  
Remember how things used to be not long ago  
  
Whoa  
  
Ill fatedI skated  
To the party fadedand I saw you there  
I waited hated getting ignored  
You stated you didnt care  
Flashes of car crashed and  
Your ashes burning the cement  
The curtain fails last call credits roll  
We have reached the end  
  
Lights out lights out Pass the herb  
Lights out lights out kiss the curb  
Lights out lights out your heart has turned  
Whos going to save you every time you crash and Burn  
Crash and burn  
  
Im sick of endings  
Im done pretending  
I just want you back to normal  
I think you dont know just how you feel  
And every time you think of me  
Remember how things used to be not long ago  
  
Sick of endings  
Im done pretending  
Tired of fighting  
Im sick of always trying  
  
Im feeling lost  
Im feeling like my hearts  
Been carved out with a spoon  
Put on display for all to witness this decay of me and you  
I just want you back to normal  
I think you dont know just how you feel  
And every time you think of me  
Remember how things used to be not long ago  
  
Whoa  
  
Lights out lights out Pass the herb  
Lights out lights out kiss the curb  
Lights out lights out your heart has turned  
Whos going to save me every time I crash and Burn  
I crash and burn  
I crash and burn
