Every morning got sun to shine  
Every day got plenty of time  
Every night  
Theres a moon so fine  
There for you my Amber Jean  
  
Still some lines  
That should get crossed  
Still some coins  
That might be tossed  
Still some love  
That hasnt been lost  
There for you my Amber Jean  
  
Amber Jean oh Amber Jean  
Prettiest eyes Ive ever seen  
  
Every morning got sun to shine  
Every day got plenty of time  
Every night  
Theres a moon so fine  
There for you my Amber Jean
