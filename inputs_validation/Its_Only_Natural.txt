Ice will melt water will boil  
You and I can shake off this mortal coil  
Its bigger than us  
You dont have to worry about it  
  
Ready or not here comes the drop  
You feel lucky when you know where you are  
You know its gonna come true  
Here in your arms I remember  
  
Chorus  
Its only natural that I should want to  
Be there with you  
Its only natural that you should  
Feel the same way too  
  
Its easy when you dont try  
Going on first impressions  
Man in a cage has made his confession  
Now youve seen me at my worst  
And it wont be the last time Im down there  
  
I want you to know I feel completely at ease  
Read me like a book  
Thats fallen down between your knees  
Please let me have my way with you  
  
Its only natural that I should want to  
Be there with you  
Its only natural that you should  
Feel the same way too  
  
Its circumstantial its nothing written in the sky  
And we dont even have to try  
Shaking like mud buildings of glass  
Sink into the bay theyll be under the rocks again  
You dont have to say I know youre afraid  
  
Its only natural that I should want to  
Be there with you  
Its only natural that you should  
Feel the same way too  
  
Its circumstantial its something I was born to  
Its only natural can I help it if I want to Can I help it if I want to
