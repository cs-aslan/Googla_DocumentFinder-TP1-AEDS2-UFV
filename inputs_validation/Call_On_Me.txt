In this fading twilight  
After all have left your side  
One sweet shadow standing by  
The edge of time  
One last sweet I love you  
To echo through the ageing  
To stir the dusty cavern  
Of the cold heart of time  
And there was no beginning  
And nobody knows whos winning  
Accept this end of my lonely day  
And I believe the story is tired  
But it dont make no difference anyway  
Cause I aint got no place to hide  
And no one to run to  
I need someone to hold my hand  
Someone to understand  
Someone I can talk to in the night  
She dont have to have a whole lot to say  
Just a little girl who wants to go my way  
Some sweet Lady with a mind to do me right  
Talkin bout a sweet sweet lovin  
A little tender understanding  
Sweet sweet lovin  
Its all that everybody needs  
So remember Baby  
In this crazy world  
If you ever need somebody  
You can call on me  
Call on me
