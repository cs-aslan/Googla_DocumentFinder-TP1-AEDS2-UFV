Hey now darlin you thought it was all fun and games  
Runnin round telling everyone why were not together  
I guess you just had to feel important  
And Im sure you thought I was just gonna sit back and take it on the chin  
But honey Im a songwriter  
And that darling is where you end and this song begins  
  
Chorus  
I found someone new who treats me better  
She dont bitch about things we aint got  
When I sing this tune it dont upset her  
Shes half your age and twice as hot  
  
Oh she wakes up every morning and she folds my clothes  
Doesnt care about the strippers dancing at my shows  
She knows that I love her so I just wanted you to know  
  
Chorus  
  
Yee hawyeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh she dont start trouble cuz she dont need drama  
She likes it in the mornin and she loves my momma  
Im her big poppa an shes my little rock n roll  
  
Chorus  
  
Shes half your age and twice as hot  
Shes half your age and twice as hot
