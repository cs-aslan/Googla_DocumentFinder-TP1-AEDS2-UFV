Her Heavens a lie to those who threw away the key  
Her God is alive and well when the higher believes  
And you cant bend the river of her dreams  
Or understand the divine words she speaks  
  
Venus denies your severing tides above dark waters  
You can quench her thirst with the fear hiding away from the day  
Venus denies you in your dark waters  
The moon kissed the sun and now we hold her in our blood  
  
Her savior was never on a cross pierced with nails  
Thirty pieces of silver never retraced her mistake  
Shell always be free from the arms of your sins  
That made you weak as your world started crumblin  
  
Venus denies your severing tides above dark waters  
You can quench her thirst with the fear hiding away from the day  
Venus denies you in your dark waters  
The moon kissed the sun and now we hold her in our blood  
  
Shes in our blood  
Venus denies your severing tides above dark waters  
You can quench her thirst with the fear hiding away from the day  
The venus denies you in your dark waters  
The moon kissed the sun and now we hold her in our blood  
In our blood  
In our blood  
In our blood  
Shes in our blood
