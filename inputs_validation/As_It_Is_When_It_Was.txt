Ive kept my head against the wall  
Ive been this way for so long now  
You werent exactly falling over yourself  
When last I saw you  
Well I always thought  
Wed get along like a house on fire  
Until you told me that Id have to go  
How can someone like you work that slow  
  
Whatever you think of me  
You listen hard and I will make you see  
Whatever you think of me  
You listen hard and I will make you see  
  
I dont feel anything no more  
This state of grace is consuming me  
Im not grown up and I am not a boy  
I feel no pain and I feel no joy  
Well I always thought  
Wed get along like a house on fire  
In those days when the sun was warm  
I ran in the street where I was born  
  
Whatever you think of me  
You listen hard and I will make you see  
Whatever you think of me  
You listen hard and I will make you see  
  
The streets are so empty at this time of night  
Id rather walk on my own than fight  
In a world where Id forgotten you  
I found myself forgotten too  
Thats the danger of believing books  
And all the lies of those thieves and crooks  
We sing intellectual songs of love  
From a stolen pen to a velvet glove
