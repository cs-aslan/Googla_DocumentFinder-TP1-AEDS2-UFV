I went from old school Chevys to drop top Porsches  
You couldnt walk a mile off in my air forces  
And you aint seen what Ive seen  
I can get a 100000 in these Sean John jeans

You couldnt walk a mile off in my air forces  
And you aint did what I did  
Where you from you gotta get how you live  
  
Everybody already know jeezy real street nigga  
Every time you see me all around street niggaz  
I hope you got yours I keep mine  
In the club blowing dro throwing gang signs  
And you already know dog  
745 back to back me and O dog  
These other niggaz is jokers  
What they rein up with I spent it up all the strokers  
  
In one night eight bitches sipped bottles of Cris  
Forty grand sit back so you can glance my wrist  
Keep bread so we carry dem toaster  
But keep back though my earrings ferocious  
Its not just my imagination  
Im the one in the topic of your conversation  
Jack boyz say they gon rob  
But on the real fuck niggaz yall dont want these problems

Black tees black ones and a fitted cap  
The Mack 11 make me walk wit a crazy dap  
Yall say we country niggaz yeehaw  
The money comin back and forth like a seesaw  
And yall aint never seen what we saw  
Stacks of twenty dollar bills bricks or white rolls  
What they got Lil Pha they dont care bout shit  
Ludacris how they ride out twenty wit dem bricks  
  
Shit I spit it for yall  
On the real my niggaz shit I spit it for yall  
Who gives a fuck about friends  
If you mix the baking soda wit it you can get a Benz  
While yall robbing and boosting  
Im standing over the stove like the chef in Houston  
And its not about the flip mane  
Want the real bread its all about your whip game
