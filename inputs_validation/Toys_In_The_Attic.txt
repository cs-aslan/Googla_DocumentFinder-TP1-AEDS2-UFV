In the attic lights  
Voices scream  
Nothings seen  
Reals a dream  
  
Leaving the things that are real behind  
Leaving the things that you love from mind  
All of the things that you learned from fears  
Nothing is left for the years  
  
Voices scream  
Nothings seen  
Reals a dream  
  
Chorus  
Toys toys toys in the attic  
Toys toys toys in the attic  
Toys toys toys in the attic  
Toys toys toys in the attic  
  
Lights  
Voices scream  
Nothings seen  
Reals a dream  
  
Leaving the things that are real behind  
Leaving the things that you love from mind  
All of the things that you learned from fears  
Nothing is left for the years  
  
Voices scream  
Nothings seen  
Reals a dream  
  
Chorus  
  
Yayayayayayayow
