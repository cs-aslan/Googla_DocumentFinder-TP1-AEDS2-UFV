 from the soundtrack of the motion picture janis   
I aint got no reason to livin I cant find no cause to die  
Lord I aint got no reason for livin you give me no cause to die  
Lord I aint got no reasons for stay here give me no cause to try  
I got these blues I gotta find me that middle road  
Well I aint got mother to love me aint got no father to care  
Lord I aint got mother to love me aint got no father to care  
Lord I aint got no reasons to go on give me no cause to stay here  
I got these blues I gotta finally know why  
Well I aint got no reason for walkin I guess Im gonna fall or standstill  
Lord I aint got no reason for walkin guess Im gonna fall or standstill  
Lord I aint got no reason for goin give me no cause to stay here  
I got these blues lord I gotta finally know why
