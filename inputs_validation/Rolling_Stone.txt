25 and Ive come alive  
21 was the time to come undone  
Doesnt everyone  
  
Very young and very ape  
Im gonna drink and stay up very late  
And hate the sun  
  
And now my heart kicks up a fuss  
Im a rolling stone  
They say Im dangerous  
But Im never alone  
  
I know that youre like me  
You want your kicks for free  
Youll be a rolling stone  
  
Got an A in attitude  
Spent money on drugs to suit my mood  
I guess Im just like you  
  
Being young is overrated  
One day Ill be old and understated  
But before Im through  
  
Ill run naked through the streets  
Be a rolling stone  
Defiance in defeat enjoy being alone  
  
I know that youre like me  
You want your kicks for free  
Be a rolling stone  
  
When we die well find out other ways  
For getting drunk and throwing it all away  
Today is tomorrow and not yesterday  
Its all in your head  
So get out of your head  
  
And now your heart kicks up a fuss  
Youre a rolling stone  
They say youre dangerous  
But youre never alone  
  
I know youre just like me  
You want your kicks for free  
Be a rolling stone  
Be a rolling stone
