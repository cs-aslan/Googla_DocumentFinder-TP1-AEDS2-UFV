I have believed I would always be free and wild  
No promises made or broken  
But look at me now I come to you like a child  
Here with my arms wide open  
I follow the song that the voice inside  
Whispers to my soul  
How could I not its my heart that brought me to paradise  
Ill be your love Ill be your friend  
Ill be the summer breeze that never ends  
For the rest of your days Ill be the road that takes you home  
Like the sun and the moon and the star that guides you on  
I will be true to my heart  
I promise you with this ring  
Now I can say this is more than just wishful dreams  
Nothing could be more real than  
Love  
Has the way of bringing you to your knees  
Lifting you up to Heaven  
I see the rest of my life when I look in your eyes  
I love what I see  
Living with you on the sunrise side of paradise  
Ill be your love Ill be your friend  
Ill be the summer breeze that never ends  
For the rest of your days Ill be the road that takes you home  
Just like the sun and the moon and the star that guides you on  
I will be true to my heart  
I promise you with this ring  
May this circle never see an end  
Here and now I willingly place a part of you upon my hand  
Ill be your love Ill be a friend  
Ill be the summer breeze that never ends  
For the rest of your days Ill be the road that takes you home  
Just like the sun and the moon and the star that guides you on  
I will be true to my heart  
I promise you with this ring
