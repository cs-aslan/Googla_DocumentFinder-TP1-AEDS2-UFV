emptyarmed  
and half a soul to go  
  
and all i wanted  
was you here next to me  
a little sunshine and sympathy  
  
now everybody knows  
that ive been hanging down so low  
cause now im feeling up  
soon ill be feeling out so cold  
wondering will you call  
and now im feeling high  
soon ill be feeling left for dead  
sometimes someone saying yes  
changes what youll bet  
  
and all i wanted  
was just to hold you close  
a little sunshine  
just to butter my toast  
and your love next to mine  
  
i had to let you know  
that we were meant to be just right  
heaven sent not sympathized  
by everybodys lie  
and now im feeling high  
now im feeling left so dead  
kicking up the dust in bed  
wondering i guess  
  
sunshine  
sunshine  
sunshine  
and some tea  
  
and your love  
your love  
your love next to mine  
  
i had to let you know  
i had to let you go so i  
could see my lie fade from your eyes  
and to my surprise  
  
thats what i wanted  
its all i wanted  
its what i wanted  
me and you  
  
sunshine  
sunshine  
sunshine  
and some tea  
  
thats all i wanted  
its all i wanted  
thats all i wanted  
its all i wanted
