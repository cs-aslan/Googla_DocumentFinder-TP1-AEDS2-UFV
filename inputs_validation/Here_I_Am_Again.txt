I told you that Id never come around again but here I am again here I am
again  
I said Id never let you get me down again here I am again here I am  
Here I am here we are the storys gettin old  
I know I cant go on to you but worse than bad I cant let go  
I said words I swore Id never speak but again here I am again here I am again  
I thought I could stay strong but I got weak again and here I am again here I
am  
Here I am here we are  
And oh the nightsre cold and I could use a friend so here I am again here I
am again
