Talkin bout the tiny cookies  
That the peoples eats  
Well city of tiny lites  
Maybe you should know  
That its over there  
In the tiny dirt somewhere  
You can see it any time  
When you get the squints  
From your downers and your wine  
Youre so big

Every cloud is silver liney  
The great escape for all of you  
Tiny is as tiny do  
Tiny is as tiny do

Talkin bout those tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny sheets  
Ooooo

That the peoples eats  
City of tiny lights
