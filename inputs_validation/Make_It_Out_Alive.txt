The more I love you  
The more I believe in you  
The more I need you  
The more Im needed too  
And I surrender  
What I thought I knew  
The look in your eyes  
I know my games are through  
  
Cos youve been holding on  
And Ive been holding back  
  
Chorus  
We may not make it out alive  
Whoa  
What does it matter if youre here by my side  
We may not make it out alive  
What does it matter  
Its just a matter of time  
  
The resignation sneaking up on me  
Was I mistaken to let you get to me  
Overtaken in ways Ive never known  
So please dont break me  
Weve still got a ways to go  
  
Cos were still holding on  
Just hoping for the best  
  
Chorus  
  
Its just a matter of time  
  
This memories that weve got  
Do not amount to much  
But Im so glad that weve got them  
We cannot be what were not  
But its too late to get  
Or shed a tear for the doubt  
Oh yeah  
  
Were just holding on  
Bracing for the worst  
Yeah  
Come on girl  
  
Chorus  
  
Its just a matter of time  
Oh yeah
