Chorus  
Im a man on fire  
Its a burning thing  
Itll burn on forever  
If you feed me baby  
Im a man on fire  
An eternal flame  
Itll burn on forever  
If you feed me baby oh  
  
Gotta be a place to go in the midnight hour  
Heart of a woman and just a little bit of pulling power  
The feelings got me  
I dont know what it means  
I know it must be wrong  
But when you love somebody you dream and I dream  
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come  
And youre there and youre gone  
And Im alive for you  
And my love keeps hanging on  
  
There is no life  
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love  
There is no unifying if I dont hear you crying  
Im yours youre mine no power in the world  
Together we are strong in love  
And when your storm is over Ill show how warm my love can be  
And me Im a man on fire  
  
Chorus  
  
Ready when the lightning strikes and he deed is done  
Im not a beginner  
But Im a sinner when the heat is on  
Nothing gonna stop me got me all that you need  
Woman when you need somebody  
A woman with a face and a body you dream and I dream  
  
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come  
And youre there and youre gone  
And Im alive for you  
And my love keeps hanging on  
  
There is no life  
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love  
There is no unifying if I dont hear you crying  
Im yours youre mine no power in the world  
Together we are strong enough  
And when your storm is over Ill show how warm my love can me  
And me Im a man on fire  
  
Chorus
