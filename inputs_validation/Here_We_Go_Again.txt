Here we go again  
Shes back in town again  
Ill take her back again one more time  
Here we go again  
The phone will ring again  
Ill be her fool again one more time  
  
Ive been there before  
And Ill try it again  
But any fool knows  
That theres no way to win  
  
Here we go again  
Shell brake my heart again  
But any fool knows  
That theres no way to win  
  
Here we go again  
Shell brake my heart again  
Ill play the part again one more time  
  
Ill take her back again  
Just one more time
