Something wonderful is happening here  
Its indescribable but dont let it disappear  
Take this moment now before its lost  
Give yourself away dont come to cost  
  
We got love  
Thats all thats really here now  
We got love  
And all we need is now  
  
Come and go with me lets enjoy de vew  
Make this day complete forget your solitude  
This time has come for us so take my hand  
Its written on your face I know you understand  
  
We got love  
Thats all I feel here now  
We got love  
Thats why we still here now  
  
All the way all the world  
Its the universe so wave  
It stays you and I  
And the way we feel today  
  
We got love  
Thats all thats really here now  
We got love  
And all we need is now  
  
We got love  
I see it in your eyes  
We got love  
And its a beautiful sign
