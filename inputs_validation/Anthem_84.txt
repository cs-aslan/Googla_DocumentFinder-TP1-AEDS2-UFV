If youre looking for a fighter wholl defend you  
And love you for your freedom Im your man  
And I aint gonna leave you for the crazy things youre doing  
But dont ask me to lend a helping hand  
You were such a pretty dream as I remember  
You were young and strong and God was on your side  
But vision slowly faded like the wonder from your eyes  
And you traded your compassion for your pride  
  
But I still believe in all that we believed in  
And I pray to God that you will in the end  
And youll see the golden chances that youre wasting  
And be the loving beauty that you can  
But I still believe in all that we believed in  
And I pray to God that you will in the end  
And youll see the golden chances that youre wasting  
And be the loving beauty that you can
