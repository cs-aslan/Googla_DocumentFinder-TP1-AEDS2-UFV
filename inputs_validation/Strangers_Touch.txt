Ive been doin some soul searchin feel guilty as a girl can feel  
Ive got no business smiling beguiling  
  
Im caught up in a triangle no future in this shape Im in  
So what do I find so appealing in stealing tell me  
  
How come a strangers touch can thrill me so much  
My hearts in jeopardy hes overpowering me oh whatll I do  
  
I wasnt lookin around you know Im happy with you  
Youre a part of me that I cant replace  
But he touched my heart in a new place he found a space tell me  
  
How come a strangers touch can thrill me so much  
My hearts in jeopardy hes overpowering me oh whatll I do  
  
Cant keep on hurtin hurtin you  
  
How come a strangers touch can thrill me so much  
My hearts in jeopardy hes overpowering me oh whatll I do  
Hes overpowering me oh whatll I do  
  
Cant keep on cant keep on cant keep hurting you  
Cant keep on cant keep on cant keep hurting you  
Cant keep on cant keep on cant keep hurting you
