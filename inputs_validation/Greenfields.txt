Greenfields  
The Brothers Four  
Once there were greenfieldskissed by the sun  
Once there were valleyswhere rivers used to run  
Once there were blue skies with white clouds high above  
Once they were part of an everlasting hope  
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields  
Greenfields are gone nowparched by the sun  
Gone from the valleyswhere rivers used to run  
Gone with the cold wind that swept through to my heart  
Gone with the lovers who let the dreams depart  
Where are the greenfields where weused to roam  
Ill never know what made you run away  
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day  
I only know theres nothing here for me  
Nothing is now left for me to say  
But I keep on waitinguntil you return  
I keep on waiting until the day you learn  
You cant be happy when your hearts on the roam  
You cant be happy until you bring it home  
Home to the greenfieldsand bleed once again
