Im like a spinning top  
Going round and around  
Well I dont know whats up  
And I sure dont know whats down  
Now watch me  Im like a spinning top  
Cant tell day from night  
Well I dont know whats wrong  
And I sure dont know whats right  
Now watch me  
  
It started when I heard your song of love  
Pouring down like honey from above  
I started to spin  
I started to move  
Just like a needle  
Thats sticking in the same old groove  
  
Im like a spinning top  
  
I like it so much Im never going to stop
