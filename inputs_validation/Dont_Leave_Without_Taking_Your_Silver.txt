You said Im taking everything that is mine right down to the clock on the
wall I watched as you packed up your things Then you turned and said Well
thats all Oh but youve overlooked just one item Its as much yours as the
clothes that you wear  
Dont leave without taking your silver You left it right here in my hair  
Its yours for I didnt have it the moment you captured my soul First a
little streak showed then slowly it wove its way right in with the gold I
dont see how you overlooked it For we both know that you put it there  
Dont leave without taking your silver You left it right here in my hair No
dont leave without taking your silver You left it right here in my hair
