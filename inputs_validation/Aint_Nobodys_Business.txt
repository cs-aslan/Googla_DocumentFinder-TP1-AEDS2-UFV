There is nothing I can do  
Nothing I can say  
That folks dont criticize me  
But Im gonna do  
Just what I want to anyway  
Dont care if they all despise me  
  
If I go to church on Sunday  
And I honky tonk all day Monday  
Aint nobodys business if I do  
  
And if I should get a feeling  
I wanna dance upon the ceiling  
Aint nobodys business oh it aint nobodys business if I do  
  
If I stay out all night  
Spend all my money well thats all right  
It aint nobodys business if I do  
  
You try to tell me I got no right to sing the blues  
What gives you the right to tell me what I should do  
It aint nobodys aint nobodys business if I do  
  
Well it aint nobodys business  
It aint no it aint nobodys business  
You know it aint nobodys business  
Aint nobodys business what I do  
Whoa what I do  
You know it aint nobodys business  
Aint nobodys business if I do
