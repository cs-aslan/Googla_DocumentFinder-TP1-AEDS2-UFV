Everbody wants to be love  
Every once in a while  
We all need someone to hold on to  
Just like a helpless child  
Can you whipser in my ear  
Let me know its all right  
  
Chorus Its been a long time coming  
Down this road  
And now I know what Ive been waiting for  
And like a lonely highway  
Im trying to get home  
Ooo loves been a long time coming  
  
You can look for a lifetime  
You can love for a day  
You can think you got everything  
Everything is nothing when you throw it away  
Then you look in my eyes and I have it all once again  
  
Chorus Its been a long time coming  
Down this road  
And now I know what Ive been waiting for  
Its like lonely highway  
Im trying to get home  
Ooo loves been a long time coming  
  
Didnt know I was lost til you found me  
Didnt know I was blind but now I see  
  
Can you whisper in my ear  
Let me know its all right  
  
Its been a long time coming  
Down this road  
And now I know what Ive been searching for  
Its been long long highway and now I see  
Ooo loves be a long time  
Ooh been a long time  
Loves been a long time  
coming
