Tell her try her best just to make it quick  
Woman tend to the sick  
Because there must be something she can do  
This heart is broken in two  
Tell her its a case of emergency  
Theres a patient by the name of Mickey  
  
Night nurse  
Only you alone can quench this here thirst  
My night nurse oh god  
Oh the pain is getting worse  
  
I dont want to see no doc  
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock  
Because theres no prescription for me  
Shes the one the only remedy  
  
My night nurse  
Only you alone can quench this here thirst  
  
My night nurse  
Oh the pain is getting worse  
Im hurt my love  
  
I dont want to see no doc  
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock  
Because there s no prescription for me  
Shes the one the only remedy  
  
Night nurse  
Only you alone can quench this here thirst  
  
My night nurse  
Oh the pain is getting worse  
Im hurt my love  
And Im sure no no doctor got a cure  
  
My night nurse  
My night nurse  
My night nurse
