He loves me Even when I fall beneath His will  
He loves me oh oh oh He loves me  
When my broken heart just wont keeps still  
He loves me oh oh oh He loves me  
Even though He knew sometimes Id fall  
Yet and still my name He called He loves me  
Jesus Im so grateful for Your love  
He loves me Even though I was born in sin  
He loves me oh oh oh He loves me  
Took me like I was and now Im free again  
He loves me oh oh oh He loves me  
Even though He knew that Keisha would fall  
Yet and still my name He knows He loves me  
Jesus Im so grateful for Your love  
He loves me Fall beneath Your will But He loves me  
You yet and still loves me This old broken heart just  
wont keep still Jesus Im so grateful for Your love  
Jesus loves the little children  
When nothing else could help love lifted me
