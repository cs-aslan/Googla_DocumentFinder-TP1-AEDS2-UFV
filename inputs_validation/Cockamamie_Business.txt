Bust my back on the Levy broke my strings on the BBC  
Found my chops on Eel Pie Island paid my dues at the Marquee  
Slagged off by the NME lost my stash and my virginity  
In this Cockamamie Business  
  
Got my face on Ed Sullivan broke my heart on the Soul Train  
Introduced to Bad Company lost cells down at Brain Drain  
And before I could mend lost the missus missed the girlfriend  
In this Cockamamie Business  
  
Now we like to air condition though the air has no ozone ring  
Still theyre chopping down the forest for McDonalds and the Burger King  
Eating cows with such persistence doesnt offer much resistance  
To this Cockamamie Business  
  
There are too many things stressing out the nervous system  
Girls you used to know fellas that may have kissedem  
Some got rabies some got fleas some got incurable diseases  
From this Cockamamie Business  
  
Everybodys after as many points as they can get  
As long as its not them that has to pay  
No one really minds the Debt  
5Star actors tax inspectors film producers and directors  
With their Cockamamie Business  
  
Well you do what you can cant do much more than that  
No you cant do what he just said  
Some days youre pretty sharp on other days you feel half dead  
While you make your daily bread  
Didnt want to be a star wanted just to play guitar  
In this Cockamamie Business
