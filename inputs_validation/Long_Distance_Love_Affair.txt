Long distance love affair  
Writer klaus meine  
  
The only king of rock has gone  
Gone to heaven  
A star on the way to the stars  
Another king of rock is born in 77  
Just born to be there when its dark  
94 95 if the world is still alive  
With the start of the riot of your time  
Heres a ticket for a burning train  
To set the world in flame  
To play the heros game  
The riot of your time  
Heres a ticket for the future days  
Youll be the guitar king  
When your electric plays  
The riot of your time  
A new generations mind  
The riot of your time  
Just to get the message to be more  
Than you desire  
A star full of life wild and young  
The hits from 1994 electric fire  
Will burn out the time like the sun  
94 95 if the world is still alive  
With the start of the riot of your time  
Heres a ticket for a burning train  
To set the world in flame  
To play the heros game  
The riot of your time  
Heres a ticket for the future days  
Youll be the guitar king  
When your electric plays  
The riot of your time  
A new generations mind  
The riot of your time
