This is the season  
These are the waking days  
Throw off your wet sheets  
Step into the Soft Parade  
Hollowed and glisten  
Like sweat on a moving train  
Baby listen  
Were about to be born again  
Come down  
This is your second skin  
Surround  
This is your second skin  
This is the love inside  
These are your fears you hide away  
Maybe its a burden  
Or maybe its natures gift  
The stretch and the burn  
All the colors youre working with  
This is a cleaning  
These are the shapes weve taken in  
Real life our dreaming  
This is our second skin  
Come down  
This is your second skin  
Surround  
This is your second skin  
This is the love inside  
These are your fears and pride today  
This is just another story  
Whisper the walk you walk  
Magic and glory  
This is just flesh from talk  
This is a moment  
This is the time to choose  
This is your hour  
Nothing but skin to lose  
Come down  
This is your second skin  
Surround  
This is your second skin  
This is the love inside  
These are your fears you hide away  
Come down  
This is your second skin  
Surround  
This is your second skin  
This is the love inside  
These are your fears and pride today
