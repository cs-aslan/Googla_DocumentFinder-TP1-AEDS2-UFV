Olivia NewtonJohn  
No me voy a rendir no no  
No me voy a rendir no no  
No me voy a rendir no no  
No me voy a rendir  
Oh Im not gonna give into it no  
Im not gonna give into it no no  
Im not gonna give into it no  
Im not gonna give into it  
There are nights when the moon  
Shines in my eyes and haunts my mind  
And I cant sleep a wink  
And I really dont want to think  
There are times when I feel  
If I sleep Ill die  
But I dare not cry  
And I run from my tears  
And I fight them back with my fears  
Oh Im not gonna give into it no  
Im not gonna give into it no no  
Im not gonna give into it no  
Im not gonna give into it  
And I feel so alone  
For although you care  
No one else can share  
Its my own misery  
In the end its all up to me  
Oh Im not gonna give into it no  
Im not gonna give into it no no  
Im not gonna give into it no  
Im not gonna give into it  
And I watch you sleep soundly  
So peacefully unaware  
And your breath is soothing to me  
And its good to know youre there  
Then the morning comes  
With its golden light  
And I feel alright  
And my heart beats again  
But the night is not my friend  
Oh Im not gonna give into it no  
Im not gonna give into it no no  
Im not gonna give into it no  
Im not gonna give into it
