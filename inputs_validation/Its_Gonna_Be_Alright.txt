Chorus x2  
Its gonna be alright  
Keep your head up to the sky  
ZRo Cause everythings gon be alright  
ZRo  
Too many problems in my life I find myself unable to maintain  
The nigga that was takin over my brain  
Redesignin my main frame  
Developin so much hatred I feel like fuck all of yall  
And for the slightest disrespect I would gladly touch all of yall  
Dedicated to doing bad and addicted to drama  
People think Im missin manners at home training but Im just missin my momma  
Its like I dont fit in this bullshit world  
Surrounded by bullshit boys and bullshit bitches  
Better murder they own people before they come up  
And thats why I be mean muggin every son of a bitch that walk or run up  
Im paranoid my nigga I keep one in the chamber  
Willing to trade my freedom for life and live among strangers  
My goal is to become one hundred and ten years old  
I found myself but I cant grow until I find my soul  
Stuck on 25 but hopefully Ill survive Ill make it  
Receiving hard pain from LOVE but Ill take it  
Chorus x2  
ZRo  
Dear Cookie I know you looking at ya son from heaven  
Totally clean and blessed without  drugs and weapons  
Wish I could open up the pearly gates and see your face  
But I gotta sinful life momma and I may not get to see that place  
I just cant keep my cool mother fuckers messin with the wrong weapon  
I pull out my Jimmy Bone switchblade and start cuttin  
Nigga you aint never known pain you dont want this in your  vein  
Rusty blades make aim cream spread like mayonnaise magn  
I cant think of nothin that ever made me feel like that dro  
Not even a woman cause as quick as she comes she out the do  
Cant put my trust up in Eve cause she got tricks up her sleeve  
All I want to do is live until Im DEAD  
Of natural causes I dont need nobody knockin me off  
Just let me fall bitch get out the way you blockin me off  
Stuck in the same spot but hopefully Ill survive Ill make it  
Disrespected by the people I love but Ill take it  
Chorus x3
