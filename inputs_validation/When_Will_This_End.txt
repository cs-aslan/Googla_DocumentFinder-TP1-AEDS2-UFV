Spinning inside rotting away  
Something inside of me has been taken away  
Feeling my heart breaking in vain  
It wont get better now  
When will this end  
  
I cant seem to get away  
I feel Im here so you can play  
With my head  
Theres nothing I can say  
I keep feeling like Im to blame  
When will this end  
  
Hopeless inside alone as I wait  
Brewing inside of me enduring this hate  
Feeling my heart breaking in vain  
It wont get better now  
When will this end  
  
I cant seem to get away  
I feel Im here so you can play  
With my head  
Theres nothing I can say  
I keep feeling like Im to blame  
When will this end  
  
The stress is rising and I cant seem to get away from you  
Youre always trying and the lying always shines right through  
My God I hate this  
Always take shit  
Can I let this go on  
Why cant I break this  
I just take this  
As this goes on and on  
  
End  
When will this end  
When will this end  
When will this end  
When will this end  
When will this end  
When will this end  
When will this end  
  
I cant seem to get away  
I feel Im here so you can play  
With my head  
Theres nothing I can say  
I keep feeling like Im to blame  
When will this end
