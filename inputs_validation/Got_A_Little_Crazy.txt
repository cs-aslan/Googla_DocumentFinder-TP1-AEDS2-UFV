Steel drums still ringing in my head  
Well I feel pain so Im not dead  
From the looks of things it looks like  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Could I get your name again  
Some situation that were in  
Woke up by each others side  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Last thing I remember  
I told the bartender  
Mix rum and whatever you have  
First one drink then two then I woke up with you  
So I know things cant be all that bad  
But its still a little hazy  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Are these your shoes that I have on  
Is this your bed is this your home  
All I know is its not mine  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Last thing I remember  
I told the bartender  
Mix rum and whatever you have  
First one drink then two then I woke up with you  
So I know things cant be all that bad  
But its still a little hazy  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
I think I feel a fresh tattoo  
What is it of I wish I knew  
It couldnt get more out of sight  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Last thing I remember  
I told the bartender  
Mix rum and whatever you have  
First one drink then two then I woke up with you  
So I know things cant be all that bad  
But its still a little hazy sounds a little shady  
I think she might have paid me but  
It got a little crazy last night  
It got a little crazy last night  
Got a little crazy
