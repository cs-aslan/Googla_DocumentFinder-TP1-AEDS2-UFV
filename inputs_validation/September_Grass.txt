Well the suns not so hot  
In the sky today  
And you know I can see  
Summertime slipping on away  
  
A few more geese are gone  
A few more leaves turning red  
But the grass is as soft  
As a feather in a featherbed  
  
So Ill be king and youll be queen  
Our kingdoms gonna be  
This little patch of green  
Wont you lie down here right now  
  
In this September grass  
Wont you lie down with me now  
September grass  
  
Oh the memory is like  
The sweetest pain  
Yeah I kissed the girl  
At a football game  
  
I can still smell the sweat  
And the grass stains  
We walked home together  
I was never the same  
  
But that was a long time ago  
And where is she now  
I dont know  
Wont you lie down here right now  
  
In this September grass  
Wont you lie down with me now  
September grass  
  
Oh September grass  
Is the sweetest kind  
It goes down easy  
Like apple wine  
  
Hope you dont mind  
If I pour you some  
Made that much sweeter  
By the winter to come  
  
Do you see those ants  
Dancing on a blade of grass  
Do you know what I know  
Thats you and me baby  
  
Were so small  
And the worlds so vast  
We found each other  
Down in the grass  
  
Wont you lie down here right now  
In this September grass  
Wont you lie down with me now  
September grass  
  
Lie down lie down lie down lie down  
  
Wont you lie down here right now  
In this September grass  
Wont you lie down with me now  
September grass  
  
Wont you lie down here right now  
In this September grass  
Wont you lie down with me now  
September grass
