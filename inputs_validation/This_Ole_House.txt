This ole house once knew my children  
This ole house once knew my life  
This ole house was home and comfort  
as we lived through storm and strife  
This ole house once rang with laughter  
This ole house heard many shouts  
Now she trembles in the darkness  
When the lightning walks about  
  
Aint agonna need this house no longer  
Aint agonna need this house no more  
Aint got time to fix the shingles  
Aint got time to fix the floor  
Aint got time to oil the hinges  
nor to mend the window panes  
Aint agonna need this house no longer  
Im agettin ready to meet the saints  
  
This ole house is gettin shaky  
This ole house is gettin old  
This ole house lets in the rain  
This ole house lets in the cold  
On my knees Im gettin shaky  
but I feel no fear or pain  
Cause I see an angel peekin  
Through a broken window pane  
  
I aint agonna need this house no longer  
Aint agonna need this house no more  
Aint got time to fix the shingles  
Aint got time to fix the floor  
I aint got time to oil the hinges  
nor to mend the window panes  
Aint agonna need this house no longer  
Im agettin ready to meet the saints  
  
This ole house is afraid of thunder  
This ole house is afraid of storms  
This ole house just groans and trembles  
when the night wind flings its arms  
This ole house is gettin feeble  
This old house is needin paint  
Just like me its tuckered out  
But Im agettin ready to meet the saints  
  
Aint agonna need this house no longer  
Aint agonna need this house no more  
Aint got time to fix the shingles  
Aint got time to
