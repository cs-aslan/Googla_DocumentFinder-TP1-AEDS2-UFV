Papers lie there helplessly  
In a pile outside the door  
I tried and tried but I just cant remember  
What theyre for  
The world outside is tugging  
Like a beggar at my sleep  
Ah thats much too old  
A story to believe  
And you know  
That its taken its share of me  
Even though  
You take such good care of me  
Now you say Morocco  
And that makes me smile  
I havent seen Morocco  
For a long long while  
The dreams are rolling down  
Across the places in my mind  
And Ive just had  
A taste of something fine  
The future hides and the past just slides  
England lies between  
Floating in a silver mist  
So cold and so clean  
And Californias shaking  
Like some angry child will  
Who has asked for love  
And isnt answered still  
And you know  
That Im looking back carefully  
Cause I know  
That theres still something there for me  
But you said Morocco  
And it made me smile  
And it hasnt been that easy  
For a long long while  
And looking back into your eyes  
I saw them really shine  
Giving me a taste  
Of something fine something fine  
Now if you see Morocco  
I know youll go in style  
I may not see Morocco  
For a little while  
But while youre there  
I was hoping you might keep it in your mind  
To save me just a taste  
Of something fine
