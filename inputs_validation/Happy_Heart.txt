Theres a certain sound always follows me around  
When youre close to me you will hear it  
Its the sound that lovers hear when they discover  
There could be no other for their love  
  
CHORUS  
  
Its my happy heart you hear  
Singing loud and singing clear  
And its all because youre near me my love  
Take my happy heart away  
Let me love you night and day  
In your arms I want to stay oh my love  
  
Feeling more and more like Ive never felt before  
You have changed my life so completely  
Music fills my soul now Ive lost all control now  
Im not half Im whole now with your love
