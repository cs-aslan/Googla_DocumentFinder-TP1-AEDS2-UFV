Till another little ray  
Care about the day your heart breaks up  
When you lose your way  
  
Im hellbound in this life  
Keep fighting the coldest wars  
Its always been like this but dont know why  
  
And sleeping in your mind  
You feel it ties you down  
Going down  
Ill go by  
  
No  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
Frozen into me  
Hunted for the vertical sealed before that  
Its where I wanna be  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
But Im still running free  
In the silver moonlight  
I cant breathe  
Woo  
  
These days are only now  
Breathe in the coldest lies  
I think its only what you have in mind  
Hold onto the best of you  
I hit the pavement  
Going down  
Dont know why  
  
No  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
Frozen into me  
Hunted for the vertical sealed before that  
Its where I wanna be  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
But Im still running free  
In the silver moonlight  
I cant breathe  
  
No Im patient  
But this colours that I live  
All alone in this life  
I cannot see  
Dreams we hide are solid  
But we cant let her bleed  
Maybe what we make  
Can you see  
Oh  
  
I will fight in this life  
Defying the coldest wars  
Its always been like this  
But dont know why  
  
No  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
Frozen into me  
Hunted for the vertical sealed before that  
Its where I wanna be  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
Im still running free  
In the silver moonlight  
I cant breathe  
Woo  
Your fear will chain you down  
  
Till I know a little rain  
Care about the day your heart breaks up  
When you lose your way
