What good does it do to hold onto  
The anger deep in your heart  
Youre the only one that its hurting  
Youre the one that its tearing apart  
Im sorry that he broke your heart girl  
But its time to let it go  
Sometimes love is a river of tears so pick up the oars and row  
He shattered your expectations  
He broke all his promises too  
With his little white lies he looked in your eyes  
And made you believe they were true  
Aw but this aint the final curtain  
Girl its time to get on the show  
Sometimes love is a river of tears so pick up the oars and row  
Its been far too long now  
Since Ive seen your smile  
Your bitterness dont look good on you  
And self pity just aint your style  
Sooner or later you know youve got to play the card youve drawn  
Its all up to you  
You can stay blue or you can move on  
Aint it hard when you discover  
Things aint what you thought they would be  
When all of your best played plans  
Hit the wall of reality  
Still all in all its a good life  
But it sure can be painful I know  
Sometimes love is a river of tears pick up the oars and row  
Sometimes love is a river of tears so pick up the oars and go
