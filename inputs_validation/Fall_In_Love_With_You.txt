If I ever needed love I need it now  
Honey why cant you see me through me  
When I pretend that Im to strong to bend  
This heart can mend a lover or a friend  
Stop acting like you never knew me  
How you fantasize telling little lies  
Fairy tales are all you ever see  
Dont you realize how you hypnotize  
Anyone whos fool enough to look back into your eyes  
And fall in love with you  
If I ever wanted someone babe I need you now  
Please dont place your self above me  
Just out of reach when you could learn to teach  
Me to begin loving you again  
Why are you doing this to me
