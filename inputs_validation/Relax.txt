Relax and settle down  
Let your mind go round  
Lay down on the ground  
And listen to the sound  
Of the band  
Hold my hand  
  
Open up your mind  
Well love right where we lie  
Ill know you from inside  
Youre like a horse Ill ride  
Oer the sand  
Through the land  
  
Relax and let your mind roll on  
Over all your problems  
Relax and let your mind roll on  
Over all your problems  
  
We try harder and harder tryin to get our way  
But its a long long wait until Judgment Day  
So settle your affairs and take your time  
Cause everything in the world is yours and mine  
Yours and mine  
  
Relax and settle down  
Let your mind go round  
Lay down on the ground  
And listen to the sound  
Of the band  
Hold my hand  
  
Relax
