She said Ill turn you on sonny to something strong play the song with the

And gocart Mozart was checkin out the weather chart to see if it was safe

And little EarlyPearly came by in his curlywurly and asked me if I needed a

Asked me if I needed a ride

Some brimstone baritone anticyclone rolling stone preacher from the east  
Says Dethrone the dictaphone hit it in its funny bone thats where they
expect it least  
And some newmown chaperone was standin in the corner watching the young
girls dance  
And some freshsown moonstone was messin with his frozen zone reminding him

The calliope crashed to the ground  
  
But she was

Blinded by the light revved up like a deuce another runner in the night  
And some bloodshot forgetmenot said daddys within earshot save the
