I take you out all over town  
But you always start sittin down  
You never move baby whats wrong with me  
When we go dancin  youre just there like a tree  
  
Baby come on and dance youre holding me back  
Ive gotta get out this feeling before I go mad  
You gotta let me in the musics getting me now  
You gotta come on and dance stop hangin around  
  
I dont care if you twist or jive just as long as youre lookin alive  
Youll make me glad baby youll make me rise  
I want to see that twinkle in your eyes  
  
Baby come on and dance youre holding me back  
Ive gotta get out this feeling before I go mad  
You gotta let me in the musics getting me now  
You gotta come on and dance stop hangin around
