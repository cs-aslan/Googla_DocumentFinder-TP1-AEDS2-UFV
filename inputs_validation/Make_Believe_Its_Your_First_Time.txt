Weve tried our hand  
At love before  
Weve been around the game enough  
To know the score  
But then is then  
And now is now  
And now is all that matters anyhow  
  
Chorus  
Make believe its your first time  
Leave your sadness behind  
Make believe its your first time  
And Ill make believe its mine  
  
The door is closed  
Its you and me  
Well take our time with love  
The way it oughta be  
This moments ours  
Tonights the night  
And if we fall in love  
Well thats alright  
  
Chorus  
  
So close your eyes  
And hold me close  
And let our hearts pretend  
That love is ours to share tonight  
And it might never end  
  
Chorus
