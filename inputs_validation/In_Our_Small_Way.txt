Chorus  
Maybe you and I cant do great things  
We may not change the world in one day  
But we still can change some things today  
In our small way  
  
Empty words are not enough  
Where theres hurt well be a crush  
When theres thirst well fill each others cup  
Because we care we love enough to share  
  
Chorus  
  
In despair well be the hope  
And the prayer that frees the soul  
Well be there to share each lonely road  
Because we love I know  
We care enough  
  
Chorus  
  
Just a little time is all it takes  
What a difference just a smile can make youll see  
Love is all we need  
  
Chorus
