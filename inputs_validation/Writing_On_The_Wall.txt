All right I saw the writing on the wall  
All night I saw the writing on the wall  
I saw the writing on the wall  
  
Lo and behold heard it on the radio  
It was a long time comin  
But it sounds so sweet come on man get off my back  
  
All right I saw the writing on the wall  
All night I saw the writing on the wall  
I saw the writing on the wall  
  
In the midwest and in the east  
Canada southwest around the world  
La Tokyo sounds so sweet  
Come on honey get on your feet  
  
All right I saw the writing on the wall  
All night I saw the writing on the wall  
I saw the writing on the wall  
  
The words were oh so  
The words were oh so clear  
  
All right I saw the writing on the wall  
All night I saw the writing on the wall  
I saw the writing on the wall  
  
Lo and behold heard it on the radio  
It was a long time comin  
But it sounds so sweet come on man get off my back  
Saw it at the airport it was on tv  
Read it in a magazine runnin down the street  
Makes no sense but I hope its gonna last  
The next big thing I really gotta laugh  
Worked and slaved and played like hell  
Everybodys goin crazy youre the last to know  
Cant explain it still a joke to me  
Maybe Im naive cause its so plain to see  
  
Its right in front of your face man  
Its right in front of your face man  
Played like hell whoa  
Played like hell whoa
