When the sun sets on the ocean  
When the yellow touches the blue  
When your heart begins to open  
Ill be so close to you  
  
When youre dreaming and I hold you  
Remember that dream will come true  
When you wake up and you need me  
Youll know just what to do  
  
In the winter when its raining  
And the sun can never shine through  
All those days of endless waiting  
Ill be thinking of you  
  
When thunder breaks the dawn  
When all muy strength is gone  
When shadows disappear  
Ill still be holding on  
  
When then sun sets on the ocean  
When the yellow touches the blue  
When your heart begins to open  
Ill be so close to you  
  
When youre dreaming and I hold you  
Remember that dream will come true  
When you wake up and you need me  
Youll know just what to do  
  
In the winter when its raining  
And the sun can never shine through  
When your heart begins to open  
When your heart begins to open  
When your heart begins to open  
  
Ill be thinking of you
