Intro  
Yeah  
Fresh off the motherfcking broadcast  
And Im here fuego nigga  
Yeah hey uh its happening fast  
Yeah uh  
  
Verse  
I told niggas on the low but they aint hear it though  
Boy that man in the mirror is a miracle  
Hey wipe your face momma told you no more tears would flow  
We eating better than we was a few years ago  
Send you Western Union on my pay day a week later its May day  
So you returned the favor we stayed afloat like some sailors  
Bill collectors blowing us up the couldnt fade us  
Bitch I made straight As go head try and degrade us haters  
But this ones funny man one year later I was on them phones  
Collecting money a lesson for me everybodys got a story dog  
Unfortunately learned I cant do nothing for you dog  
Im trying to run the whole game like a morning jog  
With hits like a porno blog  
Not hopping out to shower to make ten dollars an hour  
Aint judging though to each his own  
You pay your bills and raise your kids inside a decent home  
More power to you but a message to you fck niggas  
I hope your kids grow up and never wanna fck with you  
This punk nigga knocked up two hoes at the same time  
And told this nigga they was lying dog they aint mine  
Thats cold blooded but aint nothing new  
Same old fck it though whats up with you  
If you made it this far listening without skipping  
Then I gotta show love dont worry Im just venting  
The late night thoughts of a nigga on a mission  
And I rock my girl to sleep in missionary position  
Tuck that ass in and then I went and grabbed a pen  
And now you have it words flowing like magic its truly accurate  
You niggas posing like some hoes up in a beauty pageant  
Nobody touching me its like I got the cooties rapping  
Remember when we called niggas African booty scratchers  
Yeah that was random but man so is life  
You grab your needle grab your thread and hope you sew it right  
I find myself fiendin for a spot to go at night  
With the liquor flowing steady and the hoes polite  
The fast lane makes me reminisce on slower life  
The unabomber bitch Im blowing up over night Boom  
  
Outro  
Hey yo its happening fast  
I say its happening fast  
All the drama that I had to get past  
Will it last Or will it pass  
Just as quick as it came  
Hoes knowing my name  
Dog welcome to fame  
I pray to God we dont change  
But even if you dont  
Most niggas look at you strange  
But I guess I cant complain Hey  
Hey man its happening fast  
I say its happening fast  
I say its happening fast
