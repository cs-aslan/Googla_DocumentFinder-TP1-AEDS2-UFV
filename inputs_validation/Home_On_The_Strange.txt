He sleeps with a chain saw  
Got eyes like an outlaw  
He takes a two smoke walk  
He dont like to talk  
  
And he dont like change  
And he dont like change  
You may think hes deranged  
But hed rather be home  
Home Home on the strange  
  
Hes a Canadian Icon  
He sleeps with his clothes on  
He likes to work with his hands  
Hes an apolitical man  
  
And he dont like change  
And he dont like change  
You may think hes deranged  
But hed rather be home  
Home Home on the strange  
  
One in a lifetime  
One in a world  
One in a lifetime  
One in a world  
One in a lifetime  
One in a world  
  
He sleeps with a chain saw  
He sings fa fa fa fa fa  
He likes to work with his hands  
Hes an apolitical man  
  
And he dont like change  
And he dont like change  
You may think hes deranged  
But hed rather be home  
Home Home on the strange  
  
And he dont like change  
And he dont like change  
You may think hes deranged  
But hed rather be home  
Home Home on the strange
