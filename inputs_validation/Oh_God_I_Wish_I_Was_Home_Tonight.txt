The rain poured down the wind swept avenue  
On another dark wet December afternoon  
All my cherished memories are of you  
All my warmth and comfort stayed with you  
  
I would have wrote you a letter  
but the telephone calls are free  
Cause the boys in the next apartment  
Are working all day  
Theyre a great bunch of guys  
But I think theyre all gay  
What am I doing  
Avoiding what Im trying to say  
  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
With you in my arms  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
  
Send me a naked picture  
By the US mail  
Write a pornographic letter  
You know I wont tell  
Keep your legs closed tight  
keep your body under lock and key  
Stay home at night  
And save all the best parts for me  
  
Yeah baby  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
Yes I do baby  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight oh  
  
I could be home in time for Christmas  
If you want me to be  
Theres a plane leaves here at midnight  
Arriving at three  
But Im a bit financially embarrased  
I must admit  
To tell you the truth my honey  
I havent a cent  
  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
Tonight baby  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
  
Guess Id better ring off  
Before the boys get home  
My regards to all your family  
And everyone at home  
Theres a lump comes in my throat  
And a tear I cant hide  
Cause I want to see you so badly  
I just may die  
And you know why baby  
  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
With the ones that I love  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
Oh God I wish I was home tonight  
Oh my God I wish I was home tonight  
Tonight tonight  
  
Ive been hearing voices  
Out on the street  
They say youve found some one else  
Whos really quite neat  
But he doesnt move you like I do  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
That it just aint true
