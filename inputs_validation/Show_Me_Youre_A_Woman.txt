I hurt your feelings when I said youre kinda green  
Of an age thats in between and you dont know what love mear  
You think you love me maybe love has made you blind  
Cause youre full new emotions of a young and foolish kind  
  
Show me youre a woman  
Cause a woman has the kind of a love Im aneedin  
Show me youre a woman and Ill show you that Im a man  
Just give me what Im after  
Its a smile and the sound of your girlish laughter  
When you are a woman  
Im your man  
  
Dont try to fool me cause I know about your age  
And its written on a page of the memories that Ive saved  
I know youre only trying hard to do whats right  
But youre young and so you might have to wait for Cupids bite  
  
Show me youre a woman
