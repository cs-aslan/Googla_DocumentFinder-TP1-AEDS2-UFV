Me and my old lady sittin in the shade  
Talkin bout the money that I aint made  
Singin o boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
  
If I could I surely would  
Stand on the rock that Moses stood  
Singin O boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
  
Drank so much hooch  
It my eyes be gettin blurry  
They say I nailed her to the wall  
A stitch in time dont mean a thing  
No hangman jury could make me crawl  
Cause Im a poor boy dontcha  
Line the track a lack a  
  
O boy dontcha line the track  
O boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
O boy dontcha line the track  
  
Whatcha do with a gun thats loaded  
Shot her dead and her heart exploded  
Tell me baby now ddontcha worry  
Like lyin to a Hangman Jury  
I swear I didnt know that 45 was loaded  
In fact my memory aint too clear  
Thats not to say she didnt get what she deserved  
Least thats the way it looked from here  
Boy when you line the track a lack a  
  
Hey boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Hey boy dontcha line the track  
Ooh my love came tumblin down  
Ooh love come tumblin down  
Ooh Lets get outta here  
  
Love come tumblin  
And every night she take her things into the city  
And in the morning make me beg  
If Id taken all her titty gritty  
Smack her right upside the head  
  
Boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
  
Ooh my love came tumblin down  
Ooh love comes tumblin down  
Ooh love comes tumblin down  
Poor boy sweatin in the hot summer night  
Hangman waitin for the early mornin light singin  
  
Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
  
If I could I surely would  
Stand on the rock that Moses  
Done stood singin  
  
Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track
