Well I woke up this morning woahoh  
And the sun refused to shine  
I knew Id leave my baby oh  
With a troublin mind  
It rains every morning oh  
And evening is the same  
And its gonna be a long time oh  
Til I hear the 210 train  
  
Well I looked out my window oh  
And I couldnt keep from cryin  
I knew the old 210 oh  
Would take me down the line  
That driver on that engine oh  
Well he aint no friend of mine  
Hes taken all the women oh  
And hes left the men behind  
  
Well now he wont be leaving Big Ben oh  
For another seven years  
Im gonna find another baby oh  
To laugh away my tears  
When I get back to Houston woahoh  
Im gonna shout and tell  
How the Big Ben bought em oh  
Its a living burning hell  
  
Now when your lovin baby leaves you oh  
Dont you feel so bad  
It makes you think about the good times oh  
With the one time man youve had  
Hes crying dont leave me here baby  
Shackled to a chain  
But let me ride down with you oh  
Along the 210 train
