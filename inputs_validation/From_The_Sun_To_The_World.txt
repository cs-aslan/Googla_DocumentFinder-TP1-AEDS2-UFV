Listen to me sister I got news from the governor  
And hes heard people shouting from the towers in the city  
While their babies grow in test tubes over night  
  
Run and fetch the priest cos theres a light on in the building  
And theres sounds blowin out in the music of the night  
And we should try to get the people out alive  
  
Movin cross the ocean with the flag of death aflyin  
The demon butcher pointin out the message on the tide  
And the demon light asailin at his side  
  
Stormin down the airwaves comes the protest and the prayin  
And the love that shone down from the sun to world  
No longer could support the life it gave
