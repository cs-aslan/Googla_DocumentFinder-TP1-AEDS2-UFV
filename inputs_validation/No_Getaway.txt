Baby look across the street  
I know that youre alone  
Ive been waiting out in the dark  
That surrounds your home  
Cause after midnight Ill be calling  
Cmon answer the phone  
And baby you know theres no getaway  
I belong with you  
Ill be calling every night and day  
Till you want me too  
Baby Ive seen every movie  
That youve ever made  
Now Im waiting  
I know all the parts  
That youve ever played  
And baby you know theres no getaway  
I belong with you  
Ill be calling every night and day  
Till you want me too  
Oh baby do you read my letters  
Im so excited about you  
But Im still waiting Ive had no reply  
What about our rendezvous  
Cause after midnight  
Ooh while youre sleeping  
You know Im looking for you  
And baby you know theres no getaway  
I belong with you  
Ill be calling every night and day  
Till you want me too
