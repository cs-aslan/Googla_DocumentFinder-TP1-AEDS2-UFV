The epidemic from a crystal lie  
Puts you in super over drive  
The methademic that is so hard to hide  
Insanely staring with wide eyes  
  
Hellucinating in a chemical Hell  
Aint my idea of having fun  
Synthetic overload youre under its spell  
Your super nightmares just begun  
  
You try to stop but it controls you  
Your love affair with it wont last  
Youre on a suicidal ride of selfdestruction  
And in the end youre gonna crash  
  
You live too fast  
You live too fast  
  
You look just like a dead man alive  
Losing the fight for survival  
You sit and wait at Hells fiery gate  
Waiting the Devils arrival  
  
You live so fast you need more methademic crystal  
You never sleep you just keep goin  
Just push the trigger on your hypodermic pistol  
Each time youre dying without knowing  
  
You live too fast  
You live too fast  
  
Whats the point its killing you without you even knowing  
I can tell youve sold your soul and hell is where youre going  
Ill see you there
