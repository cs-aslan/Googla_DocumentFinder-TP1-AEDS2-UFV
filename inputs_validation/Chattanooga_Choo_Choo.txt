Chattanooga ChooChoo  
  
Hey there pal whatcha say  
Step aside partner its my day  
Bend an ear and listen to my version  
Of a really solid Tennessee excursion  
Pardon me boys is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo  
Yes Yes Track 29  
Boy you can give me a shine  
Can you afford to board the Chattanooga Choo Choo  
Ive got my fare  
And just a trifle to spare  
You leave the Pennsylvania station bout a quarter to four  
Read a magazine and then youre in Baltimore  
Dinner in the diner nothing could be finer  
then to have your ham and eggs in Carolina  
When you hear the whistle blowing eight to the bar  
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far  
Shuffle all the coal in  
Gotta keep it rollin  
Whoo Whoo Chattanooga there you are  
Theres gonna be a certain party at the station  
Satin and Lace  
I used to call funny face  
Shes gonna cry  
Until I tell her that Ill never roam  
So Chattanooga Choo Choo  
Wont you choo choo me home  
Get aboard  
All aboard  
Chattanooga choo choo  
Wont you choo choo me home
