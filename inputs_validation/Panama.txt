Jump back whats that sound  
Here she comes full blast and top down  
Hot shoe burnin down the avenue  
Model citizen zero discipline  
  
Dont you know shes coming home with me  
Youl lose her in the turn  
Ill get her  
  
Chorus  
Panama Panama  
Panama Panama  
  
Aint nothin like it her shiny machine  
Got the feel for the wheel keep the moving parts clean  
Hot shoe burnin down the avenue  
Got an onramp comin through my bedroom  
  
Dont you know shes coming home with me  
Youll lose her in the turn  
Ill get her  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah were runnin a little bit hot tonight  
I can barely see the road from the heat comin off of it  
Ah you reach down between my legs  
Ease the seat back  
  
Shes blinding Im flying  
Right behind the rearview mirror now  
Got the feeling power steering  
Pistons popping aint no stopping now  
  
Chorus
