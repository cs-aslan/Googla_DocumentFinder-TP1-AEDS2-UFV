Last night I dreamed I was looking down  
On the planet earth spinning round and round  
And as I cast my gaze about  
I watched her lovely light go out  
The light went out  
And floating in the black of space  
I was looking into gods own face  
And in his hand he held this tiny earth  
He said well aint it a shame what theyve done to her  
After Id shown them to the holy road the holy road  
After Id shown them to the holy road the holy road  
Well I laid a bounty in their hands  
And only gave them ten commands  
But they never learned their lessons very well  
And they drove my garden straight to hell  
Thats when they fell off of the holy road the holy road  
Thats when they fell off of the holy road the holy road  
Let me tell you  
Well the popes were frauds and the kings were fools  
And your presidents only dupes and tools  
And the money makers and the chiefs of staff  
Who worshipped of that golden calf  
They turned their backs upon the holy road the holy road  
They turned their backs upon the holy road the holy road  
And then I told him  
Well you made the sun and you made the sky  
The things that crawl and the things that fly  
And then you made the human race  
And he said well everybody makes mistakes  
I thought theyd want to walk the holy road the holy road  
I thought theyd want to walk the holy road the holy road  
And even though it was just a dream  
It seemed as real as it could seem  
And often dreams the truth forebodes  
You got to get back children on the holy road  
Get back children on the holy road  
Get back children on the holy road  
Get back children on the holy road  
Holy road the holy road  
Gotta get back on the holy road the holy road  
Gotta get back on the holy road the holy road  
Gotta get back on the holy road the holy road  
On the holy road on the holy road  
On the holy road people on the holy road  
On the holy road now the holy road  
On the holy road children on the holy road
