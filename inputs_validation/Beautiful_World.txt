Its a beautiful world we live in  
A sweet romantic place  
Beautiful people everywhere  
The way they show they care makes me want to say  
Its a beautiful world  
Oh what a beautiful world  
For you  
  
Its a wonderful time to be here  
Its nice to be alive  
Wonderful people everywhere  
The way they comb their hair makes me want to say  
Its a wonderful place  
Oh what a wonderful place  
For you for you for you for you for you for you not me
