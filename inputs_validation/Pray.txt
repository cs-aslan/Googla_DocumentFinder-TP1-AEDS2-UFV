Pray for me  
As you would a child  
In a land of oppression  
  
Millions cry around the world  
But I cry in your back garden  
  
Pray for me  
And Ill pray for you  
Its no revolution  
But its somethin   
Somethin we can do  
  
Pray all the day  
All the   
All the day  
All the day  
  
Pray for me  
As you do for peace  
In a world of aggression  
Hear me  
Must it make the news  
For us to show some affection  
  
Pray for me  
And Ill pray for you  
Its no revolution  
But its somethin   
Somethin we can do  
  
Pray all the day  
All the   
All the day  
All the   
  
As it was in the beginning  so shall it be  
Until next week
