Break my back with hard lovin  
Take my hand and keep movin  
Dont slow down were nearly there now  
Oh can you stand the pain  
Im a hard lovin man  
  
Whats your name Its alright now  
Trick or treat were uptight now  
Wanna feel ya I wanna hear ya  
Oh here we go again  
Im a hard lovin man  
  
Come back here its not over  
Cant you see theres still time girl  
I can last make if fast now  
Oh gotta catch a train  
Im a hard lovin man
