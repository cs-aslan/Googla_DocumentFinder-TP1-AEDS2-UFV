A good womans love is like a river  
Runnin through the heart of a man  
If he gives her all he can give her  
Shell be with him at every bend  
  
And now the rivers Ive crossed  
A reflection was lost  
And shallow waters left me blue  
Girl I never came across a river like you  
  
A river like you  
Where your love runs so deep and true  
A river like you  
Like a waterfall fallin in two  
A river like you  
  
Well I spent all my time searchin  
And runnin like the wayward wind  
But you found me desperately driftin  
And touched my heart and took me in  
  
Now your love runs through me  
And in your eyes I see  
Reflections I never knew  
Girl Ill always be sailin on a river like you  
  
A river like you  
Where your love runs so deep and true  
A river like you  
Like a waterfall fallin in two  
A river like you  
  
Now the rivers Ive crossed  
A reflection was lost  
And shallow waters left me blue  
Girl Ill always keep sailin on a river like you  
  
A river like you  
Where your love runs so deep and true  
A river like you  
Like a waterfall fallin in two  
A river like you  
A river like you  
A river like you
