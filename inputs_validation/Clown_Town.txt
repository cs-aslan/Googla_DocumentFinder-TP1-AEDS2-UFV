When a guys been made a fool of  
By a gal who only wants to play  
He goes to a lonely place where lovers  
Who are broken hearted stay  
They call it  
Clown town clown town  
No joy around town and you see  
Thats just where Ive been stayin  
Since you made a clown out of me  
Baby wont you come and get me  
I cant take it here another day  
Its not very hard to find  
Its no more than a broken heart away  
They call it  
Clown town clown town  
No joy around town and you see  
Thats just where Ill be stayin  
Baby till you set me free  
They call it  
Clown town clown town  
No joy around town and you see  
Thats just where Ill be stayin  
Baby till you set me free  
They call it  
Clown town clown town  
No joy around town and you see  
Thats just where Ill be stayin  
Baby till you set me free  
They call it  
Clown town clown town  
Come and get me baby
