Got my sights baby set on you  
The things she said well maybe theyre true  
  
But its not gonna happen  
I wont let it happen  
I wont let it happen  
Not again  
  
Easy come easy go easily  
But thats not how I want it to be  
  
Its not gonna happen I wont let it happen  
I wont let it happen Not again  
  
Sitting all alone by the telephone  
When are you coming home  
When are you coming home  
Hey  
  
Easy come easy go easily  
But thats not how I want it to be  
  
And its not gonna happen  
I wont let it happen  
I wont let it happen  
Not again  
Not again  
Not again  
Not again
