Took the ribbon from my hair  
And Im letting it all hang down  
So if youre lookin for the same old me  
Gotta tell you that shes left town  
Dont try to call my number baby  
Youre gonna get no reply  
Cause suddenly Im changin  
Im finally rearrangin  
  
In this day of liberation  
Im lookin to find my share  
Whats the use of being patient  
You aint goin nowhere  
I got my own twostep together  
And I want the first slow dance with you  
I just saw Venus risin  
Guess Im realisin  
  
I aint mamas little girl no more  
And baby youre the first to know  
I aint mamas little girl no more  
I took a little time to grow  
Its gonna be worth waiting  
The anticipating  
Im not mamas little baby no more  
  
Well Ive been everyones best friend  
Someone they could tell their troubles to  
How come they never noticed me  
And the pain that I was going through  
Ive seen the lonely side of living  
I never want to go back there again  
The sad old me is dyin  
Tonight there is no denyin  
  
I aint mamas little girl no more  
And baby youre the first to know  
I aint mamas little girl no more  
I took a little time to grow  
Its gonna be worth waiting  
The anticipating  
Im not mamas little baby no more  
  
I aint mamas little girl no more  
And baby youre the first the first to know  
I aint mamas little girl no more  
I took a little time a time to grow  
Its gonna be worth the waiting  
The anticipating  
Im not mamas little baby no more no more  
  
I aint mamas little girl no more  
And baby youre the first the first to know  
I said I aint mamas little girl no no more  
I took a little time a time to grow  
Its gonna be worth the waiting  
The anticipating  
Im not mamas little baby no more no more
