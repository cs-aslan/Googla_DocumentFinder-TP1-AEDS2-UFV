Standin in the doorway forgot to say one thing  
Youve always had the power to lift my wings  
I know I shouldnt need so much an we could say goodbye  
Oh yes I am a dreamer I still see us flyin high  
  
We can start over darlin its clear  
Love is what brought you here  
  
Dont Walk Away  
Oh to see if I follow  
Dont Walk Away victorys hollow  
Been that road it didnt take us home  
Turn around you wont be alone  
  
Somethin brings us together keeps tearin us apart  
The wounded are much wiser well just take it from the start  
  
We can start over darlin its clear  
Love is what brought you here  
  
Dont Walk Away  
Oh to see if I follow  
Dont Walk Away victorys hollow  
Been that road it didnt take us home  
Turn around you wont be alone  
  
We can start over darlin its clear  
Love is what brought you here  
  
Dont Walk Away  
Oh to see if I follow  
Dont Walk Away victorys hollow  
Been that road it didnt take us home  
Turn around you wont be alone  
Dont Walk Away  
Dont Walk Away  
  
Oh to see if I follow  
Dont Walk Away victorys hollow  
Been that road it didnt take us home  
Turn around you wont be alone  
Dont Walk Away  
Oh to see if I follow  
Oh Dont Walk Away Dont Walk Away  
Been that road it didnt take us home  
Turn around turn around you wont be you wont be alone
