Ooo oh  
Ooo oh  
Come on and dance come on and dance  
Lets make some romance  
You know the night is fallin  
And the musics callin  
And weve got to get down to Swingtown  
  
Weve been workin so hard  
Weve been workin so hard  
Come on baby  
Come on baby lets dance  
Come on come on come on  
Come on come on come on  
Come on come on come on  
  
Ooo oh  
Ooo oh  
Come on and dance come on and dance  
We may not get another chance  
You know the night is fallin  
And the musics callin  
And weve got to get down to Swingtown
