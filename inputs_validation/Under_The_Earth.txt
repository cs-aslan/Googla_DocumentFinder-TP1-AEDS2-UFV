Down down under the earth goes another lover  
  
Down down under earth goes another lover  
Down down under earth goes another lover  
  
Twelve times put a hex on you  
Small mouths dont dare to shout out  
No fun for a night out  
No fun for a night out on the town  
  
Twelve times put a hex on you  
Small mouths dont dare to shout it out  
No fun for a night out  
No fun for a night out on the town  
  
Run away run away  
That youll stay here  
On your own on your own youre not safe run away run away  
On your own on your own youre not safe  
  
Down down under earth goes another lover  
Down down under the earth goes another lover  
Milk you for what youre worth and call it murder  
Down down under the earth goes another lover
