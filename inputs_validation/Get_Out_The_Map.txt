The saddest sight my eyes can see  
Is that big ball of orange sinking slyly down the trees  
Sittin in a broken circle while you rest upon my knee  
This perfect moment moment will soon be leaving me  
  
Suzanne calls from Boston the coffees hot the corn is high  
And that same sun that warms your heart will suck the good earth dry  
With everything its opposite enough to keep you crying  
Or keep this old world spinning with a twinkle in its eye  
  
Get out the map get out the map  
And lay your finger anywhere down  
Well leave the figuring to those we pass on our way out of town  
Dont drink the water there seems to be something ailing everyone  
Im gonna clear my head  
Im gonna drink that sun  
Im gonna love you good and strong while our love is good and young  
  
Joni left for South Africa a few years ago  
And Beth took a job all the way over on the West Coast  
And me Im still trying to live half a life on the road  
Seems Im heavier by the year and heavier by the load  
  
Why do we hurtle ourselves through ever inch of time and space  
I must say around some corner I can sense a resting place  
With every lesson learned a line upon your beautiful face  
Well amuse ourselves one day with these memories well trace  
  
Get out the map get out the map  
And lay your finger anywhere down  
Well leave the figuring to those we pass on our way out of town  
Dont drink the water there seems to be something ailing everyone  
Im gonna clear my head  
Im gonna drink that sun  
Im gonna love you good and strong while our love is good and young
