You cant sleep and you just cant eat  
Keep on moving around looking for her shadow  
Youve been through it once well we all should know  
When you lie awake it takes so long for the night to go  
You gotta heartbreak  
Its not the front page  
You gotta heartbreak  
But its not the page page news  
Six lonely days you wonder when youll wake  
From these dreams of the past well theres no time like the present  
You think right now there can be no one else  
You say first love is best well we all must learn to grow  
You gotta heartbreak  
Its not the front page  
You gotta heartbreak  
But its not the page page news no no  
Dont rush love you must take your time  
Try to play it cool got to read between the lines  
If you dont she will fly away  
To some far off place where she wont receive your telephone calls  
You gotta heartbreak  
Its not the front page  
You gotta heartbreak  
But its not the page page news  
Its just a heartbreak  
Its not the front page  
You gotta heartbreak  
But its not the page page news
