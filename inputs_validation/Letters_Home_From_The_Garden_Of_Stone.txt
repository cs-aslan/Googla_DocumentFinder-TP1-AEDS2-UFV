Sittin restless under the moonlight  
I know Im getting ready to kill  
They say were going in with the day light  
I dont want to but I will  
  
Cause I wont know the man that kills me  
And I dont know these men I kill  
I thank God for my salvation  
Wash away the blood I spill  
  
I try not to think about my family  
Cause its a little too much to take  
Out here I got me and I got my buddy  
We cant afford even one mistake  
  
I started writing on dirty card boards  
Its the only paper I could find  
Tell everyone I got their letters  
Tell everyone Im doing fine  
  
Late at night when I can dream I  
I think about life back in the world  
  
I miss you and dad I miss sister Sarah  
I miss my wife and my baby girl  
  
Pray for me pray for my soul Ma  
Pray for me and all my sins  
  
They say I got a job to do now  
Ill be back when it finally ends  
  
Do you think I should be fighting  
Ma are you proud are you ashamed  
  
Really Im trying to do the right thing  
I hope my Government can say the same thing  
  
Cause I wont know the man that kills me  
And I dont know these men I kill  
We all wind upon the same side  
Cause aint none of us doin Gods Will
