If it werent for kids have you ever thought  
There wouldnt be no Santa Clause  
Look what the store just brought  
Thank God for Kids  
  
Wed all live in a quiet house  
Without Big Bird or a Mickey Mouse  
And coolaid on the couch  
Thank God for Kids  
  
Thank God for kids theres magic for a while  
A special kind of sunshine in a smile  
Do you ever stop to think or wonder why  
The dearest thing to Heaven is a child  
  
Daddy how does this thing fly  
A hundred other wheres and whys  
You really dont know but we try  
Thank God for Kids  
  
When you look down in those trusting eyes  
That look to you you realize  
Its love that you cant buy  
Thank God for Kids  
  
Thank God for theres magic for a while  
A special kind of sunshine in a smile  
Do you ever stop to think or wonder why  
The dearest thing to Heaven is a child  
  
When you get down on your knees tonight  
To thank the Lord for his guiding light  
And pray they turn out right  
Thank God for Kids
