Ive been searching  
Not the first or the last  
Trying to figure out the mystery of the half empty glass  
Time is turning for the rest of the world  
While a temporary leap of faith helps the story unfurl  
  
They say that hearts dont stay broken  
Even though the scars remain  
And eyes dont stay swollen  
Even if it feels that way  
  
Chorus  
But its not that serious  
Im a big boy now  
And Im not that delirious  
So dont show me how  
Cause Ive gotten beyond the agony  
And my perspective is saving me  
  
Never doubted what the cards would reveal  
And if the joker showed his ugly face  
Not that big of a deal  
Its just a moment in the scheme of it all  
But its difficult to visualize when the axe starts to fall  
  
But then a heart wont stay broken  
Even on its darkest day  
The right door could open  
Pick you up and drift away  
  
Chorus  
  
With all the confusion  
How does anybody come through  
But life is illusion  
And no one can tell you what youve gotta do  
  
You know a heart wont stay broken  
Even on its darkest day  
The right door could open  
Pick you up and drift away
