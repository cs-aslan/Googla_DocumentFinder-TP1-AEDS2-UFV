Hey have you noticed that the world has changed  
That the news is all bad  
Well I think its time for a song about that  
  
Up on the East side of Manhattan  
Theyre still dancing with the stars  
While over in sub prime city  
Its getting ugly in the local bars  
Watching the news only gives me the blues  
Theres too much going wrong  
It takes the likes of me to hit the reboot key  
And write a high speed drinking song  
  
Millionaires losing everything  
Hey welcome to the other side of life  
There goes the yacht there goes the Rolls  
But you you get to keep your wife  
And dont forget the automakers  
Swimming up stream like a trout  
They let the shit hit the fan  
And then they made a plan  
Weve got a a lot to drink about  
  
Theres the price of oil  
The war of the spoils  
Heres your bucket for the big bailout  
Iraq Iran Afghanistan  
Weve got a a lot to drink about  
  
Now Madoff made off with all the money  
And his clients are down to skunk weed  
Repeat after me its so easy to see  
Were only talking simple greed  
And those Somalian pirates are counting all the gold  
While Bush and Cheney aint around  
And all the good lookers seem to be Russian hookers  
From Key West to London town  
  
With the price of oil  
The war of the spoils  
Heres your bucket for the big bailout  
Iraq Iran Afghanistan  
Weve got a a lot to drink about  
  
So pour me some Tennessee whiskey  
Pour me a fine Jamaican rum  
That loud mouth soup  
Can get ya kinda looped  
Tequila of course Ill have some  
  
Well the family devalues  
And little children plan their net worth  
And the truth wherever its hiding  
Can be found on Google Earth  
Citibanks buying jets with our money  
I wanna flog em with a buggy whip  
Lets hope Obama and Joe wont let the volcano blow  
And patch the hole in our sinking ship  
  
Theres the price of oil  
The war of the spoils  
Heres your bucket for the big bailout  
Iraq Iran Afghanistan  
Weve got a a lot to drink about  
  
Recession opression depression good God  
CNN keeps bumming me out  
I cant take another doomsday minute  
We got a lot to drink a lot to think  
A lot to drink about  
  
God bless America
