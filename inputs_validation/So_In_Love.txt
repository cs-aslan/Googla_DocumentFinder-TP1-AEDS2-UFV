Oooo x5  
Verse 1  
Its been so many days  
So many hours  
Since we went our separate ways  
And Im still here missing you  
What am I supposed to do  
When theres  
So many things  
That remind me of  
That times that we shared  
Just the two of us  
I cant understand it  
Why does it have to be this way  
Tell me what  
Chorus  
Babywhat do I do  
When imso in love with you  
I could nevernever ever  
Love this way again say  
Ooooo5x  
Verse 2  
Lying in the bed  
We used to share  
The only thing missing  
Is your not here  
I Reminisce on the love we made  
You used to drive me crazy  
When you said my name  
And when you kissed me there  
Ohh babyohhh wee baby  
Tell me what do I say  
What do I do  
When Im still in love with you

Baby tell me where did we go wrong
