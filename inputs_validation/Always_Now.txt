Its always now  
And nothing ever goes away  
Everything is here to stay  
And its always now  
  
Its always now  
There never was a used to be  
Everything is still with me  
And its always now  
  
So brace your heart  
Save yourself some sanity  
Its more than just a memory  
And its always now  
And heres your part  
  
Sing it like a melody  
Theres really only you and me  
And its always now  
  
So brace your heart  
Save yourself some sanity  
Its more than just a memory  
And its always now  
And heres your part  
Sing it like a melody  
Theres really only you and me  
And its always now  
Theres really only you and me  
And its always now
