Tomorrow Ill say happy birthday darling  
And surprise you with a gift when I come home  
Then mine forgetful arms will reach out for you  
I cant forget you just because youre gone  
  
I cant believe that youve stopped loving me  
Its too much for me to understand  
How can anything so real become a dream  
I cant believe that youve stopped loving me  
  
I accepted all the reasons why you left me  
Ive gone back and relived all the love weve had  
For every tear we lost Ive found the thousands smiles  
And the good times always outweight the bad  
  
I cant believe that youve stopped loving me  
I cant believe that youve stopped loving me
