Ive got you on my mind Im feeling kind of sad and low  
Got you on my mind feeling kind of sad and low  
Im wondering where you are wondering why you had to go  
  
Tears begin to fall every time I hear your name  
Tears begin to fall every time I hear your name  
But since you went away nothing seems to be the same  
  
No matter how I try  
My heart just dont see why  
I cant forget you  
If ever it should be  
You want to come back to me  
You know Id let you
