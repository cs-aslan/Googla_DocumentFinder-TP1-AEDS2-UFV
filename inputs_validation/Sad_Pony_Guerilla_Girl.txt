You say I am a looker  
Because I am a girl  
You say Im stupid  
Because I am your girl  
  
Leave me out on the steps  
Dress me up like a boy  
Say I am your secret love  
Say to be quiet but I want to tell the whole world  
  
I like my neighborhood  
I like my gun  
Driving my little car  
Im your girl and I will protect you  
  
I like my neighborhood  
I like my gun  
Driving my little car  
Im your girl and I will protect you  
  
Get into the back of my little car  
Pull up my pants and fix my bra  
Go on home go home to your kids  
Im not gonna be quiet Im gonna tell the whole block  
  
I like my neighborhood  
I like my gun  
Driving my little car  
Im your girl and I will protect you  
  
I like my neighborhood  
I like my gun  
Driving my little car  
Im your girl and I will protect you  
  
I like my neighborhood  
I like my gun  
Driving my little car  
Im your girl and I will protect you
