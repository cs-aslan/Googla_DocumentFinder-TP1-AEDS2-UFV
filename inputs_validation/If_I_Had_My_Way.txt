If I had my way wed love one another  
If I had my way wed all live as brothers  
Thered be no more fussing and fighting  
No more hungry innocent dying  
Id make it all go away  
If I had my way  
  
If I had my way  
Id carry your burden  
If I had my way  
No one would be hurtin  
And thered be no more hatred and lying  
No more lonely little kids crying  
Id make it all go away  
If I had my way  
  
Maybe one day the walls will come down  
If I had my way the lost would be found  
Love will find a way to turn everything around  
  
Thered be no more fussing and fighting  
No more frightened little kids crying  
Id make it all go away  
If I had my way
