Where did you come from  
Where have you been  
Looks like you fell into the trash bin  
Im catching train Im crashing a car  
Back in for daylight shooting for the stars  
  
Like a lifelong daisy chain  
Of my imagination  
A rat inside a maze  
I got no destination  
  
Cause Im a little boy named Train  
Ask me again Ill tell you the same  
Little boy named Train  
Dont know where I come from  
But I know where I have been  
  
Serious people are funny to me  
Funny people seem so serious  
  
Im always lost and nothing will change  
Give me directions and Ill get lost again  
  
Like a lifelong daisy chain  
Of my imagination  
A rat inside a maze  
I got no destination  
  
Cause Im a little boy named Train  
Ask me again Ill tell you the same  
Little boy named Train  
  
Dont know where I come from  
But I know where I have been  
  
Like a lifelong daisy chain  
Of my imagination  
A rat inside a maze  
I got no destination  
  
Cause Im a little boy named Train  
Ask me again Ill tell you the same  
Little boy named Train  
  
I dont know where I come from  
But I know where I have been  
I said I dont know where I come from  
But I know where I have been
