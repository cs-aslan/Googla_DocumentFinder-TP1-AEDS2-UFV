Hes gone two thousand miles  
Its very far  
The snow is falling down  
Gets colder day by day  
I miss you  
  
The children will sing  
Hell be back at Christmastime  
  
In these frozen and silent nights  
Sometimes in a dream you appear  
Outside under the purple sky  
Diamonds in the snow sparkle  
Our hearts were singing  
It felt like Christmastime  
  
Two thousand miles  
Is very far through the snow  
Ill think of you  
Wherever you go  
  
Hes gone two thousand miles  
Its very far  
The snow is falling down  
Gets colder day by day  
I miss you  
  
I can hear people singing  
It must be Christmastime  
I hear people singing  
It must be Christmastime
