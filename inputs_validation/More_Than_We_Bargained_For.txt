Ive always wanted what I couldnt have  
I hope and dream that maybe someday  
That Id find out what love was all about  
I sure grew up tonight the hard way  
Now the candy stores closed the movies sold out  
High Plains Drifter isnt what its all about  
And now were parting ways I wont say a word  
Let our broken hearts cry in their graves  
Where theyll never be heard  
  
Its more than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream  
Its slippin away  
  
Last night I saw you out with my best friend  
When Im with you I see him in your eyes  
I want to hold you but I dont understand  
Theres something there thats so hard to disguise  
  
Now tears run down your face as you walk through the night  
Those cold empty streets leave you wondering whats right  
As you walk away with your broken heart  
Dont you try to deny that true love had torn you apart  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream  
Its slippin away  
  
Its more than we bargained for  
Its more than we bargained for  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream  
Its slippin away  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream  
Its slippin away
