I dont know how to write you a song  
That says Im sorry I know I was wrong  
I cant find the words that dont make it cheap  
Its right on the verge and just out of reach  
It must be a sad song with a blue melody  
And Ill bet you its lonesome as lonesome as can be  
But Im starting to wonder if theres such a thing  
As a sad song thats too sad to sing  
  
Maybe tonight maybe this time tomorrow  
Me and this guitar will get right with this sorrow  
And Ill play it for you and youll come back to me  
Cause you were always a fool for the blue melodies  
  
So it must be a sad song in three quarter time  
That chills down to the bone when the steel guitars cry  
But if its not the one that brings you home to me  
Then its just a sad song thats too sad to sing  
  
Awe but if its not the one that brings you back to me  
Then its just a sad song thats too sad to sing  
  
Oh its just a sad song thats too sad to sing
