Youre a doll  
Your eyes see all  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you  
want to see me  
  
Youre so young  
But your feelings are deep  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you feel for me  
  
You put your head on my pillow  
And youre fast asleep  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you  
Dream about me  
  
Ooh ooh baby  
The worlds a wall of ice  
Youre gonna need someone  
To treat you warm  
And keep you nice  
  
I like the way you dance  
The way you spin  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you  
Spin for me  
  
You put your head on my pillow  
And youre fast asleep  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you  
Dream about me  
Dream about me
