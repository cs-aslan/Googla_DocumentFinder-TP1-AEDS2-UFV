Mama you gave life to me  
Turned a baby into a lady  
And mama all you had to offer  
was a promise of a lifetime of love  
Now I know there is no other  
Love like a mothers  
Love for her child  
and I know  
a love so complete  
something  
  
Goodbyes the saddest word Ill ever hear  
Goodbyes the last time I will hold you near  
Someday youll say that word and I will cry  
Itll break my hear to hear you say goodbye  
  
Mama you gave love to me  
Turned a young one  
Into a woman  
and mama all I ever needed  
was a guarantee of you loving me  
  
Cuz I know  
there is no other  
love like a mothers  
love for her child  
and it hurts so  
that something so strong  
  
must say goodbye  
  
Goodbyes the saddest word Ill ever hear  
Goodbyes the last time I will hold you near  
Someday youll say that word and I will cry  
Itll break my heart to hear you say goodbye  
  
Well the love you give  
  
Youll always be there everytime I call  
You ought to be the greatest love of all  
You take my weakness and you make me strong  
And I will always love till forever comes
