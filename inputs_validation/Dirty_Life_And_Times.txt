Some days I feel like my shadows casting me  
Some days the sun dont shine  
Sometimes I wonder what tomorrows gonna bring  
When I think about my dirty life and times  
  
One day I came to a fork in the road  
Folks I just couldnt go where I was told  
Now theyll hunt me down and hang me for my crimes  
If I tell about my dirty life and times  
  
I had someone til she went out for a stroll  
Should have run after her  
Its hard to find a girl with a heart of gold  
When youre living in a fourletter world  
  
And if she wont love me then her sister will  
Shes from Sayonethingandmeananothersville  
And she cant seem to make up her mind  
When she hears about my dirty life and times  
  
Some days I feel like my shadows casting me  
Some days the sun dont shine  
Sometimes I wonder why Im still running free  
All up and down the line  
  
Gets a little lonely folks you know what I mean  
Im looking for a woman with low selfesteem  
To lay me out and ease my worried mind  
While Im winding down my dirty life and times  
  
Wholl lay me out and ease my worried mind  
While Im winding down my dirty life and times
