Take your payroll  
And your lottery  
Theres a place I know  
Theres a robbery  
  
And I swear Ill never tell  
If you swear youll never tell  
And well all make out so well  
We will all make out so well  
  
Head on with my hate  
Into the lights ahead  
Im amazed that Im still standing  
And I demand that we all blend in  
Im amounted  
  
Just the same old  
Glitter story  
From the sea floor  
Metamorphosis  
And I cant change back for you  
I will not change back for you  
I must live in skin thats new  
Im a livid skin thats new  
  
Head on with my hate  
Into the lights ahead  
Im amazed that Im still standing  
And I demand that we all blend in  
Im amounted  
  
Turn your insides out to the outside  
Turn the outside in to the inside  
Trade your outside in for the inside  
Turn it around again  
Turn your insides out to the outside  
Turn the outside in to the inside  
Trade your outside in for the inside  
Turn it around again  
  
Im amounted  
  
And I cant change back for you  
No I cant change back for you
