Now that Ive passed your test  
How can I prove to you baby Ill never let you down  
If I led you around Im sorry  
But I never meant to worry youno  
Now that Ive kissed your breast  
How can I prove to you baby Ill never make you sad  
If I ever had  do believe your tears tears wont come back again  
I love you though the stars may fade  
And mountains turn into sand I love you  
Til my body changes into an old man I love you  
And the song that I sing is the only way that I can explain  
La la la la la la  
You know I wish for you baby nothing but good times ahead  
Anything that heaven can give you I can give you instead  
La la la la la la  
How could I lie to you baby Ill never lead you around  
Ill take care of everything you need darling  
Every little needll be found I love you  
Thought the time may change and snowmen sleep in the sea  
And I really only want you to want me I love you  
And the song that I sing is the only way that I can explain  
Now that youve shown your heart  
Ill be right with you baby Ill never leave you alone  
Anywhere you want me to be honey Ill be there to have and to hold  
And now that the clouds roll back hold on to me baby  
Were going never to land flying on the power of love  
Flying on the power of love I love you  
Though time may fade and mountains turn into sand  
I love you til the very same come back to the land  
I love you and the song that I sing is the only way that  
I can explain  
Two fine people should love each other  
Two fine people should help each other
