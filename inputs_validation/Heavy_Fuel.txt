Last time I was sober man I felt bad  
Worst hangover that I ever had  
It took six hamburgers and scotch all night  
Nicotine for breakfast just to put me right  
cause if you want to run cool  
If you want to run cool  
If you want to run cool you got to run  
On heavy heavy fuel  
  
My life makes perfect sense  
Lust and food and violence  
Sex and money are my major kicks  
Get me in a fight I like dirty tricks  
cause if you want to run cool  
Yes if you want to run cool you got to run  
On heavy heavy fuel  
  
My chick loves a man whos strong  
The things shell do to turn me on  
I love the babes dont get me wrong  
Hey thats why I wrote this song  
  
I dont care if my liver is hanging by a thread  
Dont care if my doctor says I ought to be dead  
When my ugly big car wont climb this hill  
Ill write a suicide note on a hundred dollar bill  
cause if you want to run cool  
If you want to run cool  
Yes if you want to run cool you got to run  
On heavy heavy fuel
