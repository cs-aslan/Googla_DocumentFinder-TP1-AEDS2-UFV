  
  
I never can say goodbye no no no no now  
I never can say goodbye  
  
Even though the pain and heartache  
Seems to follow me wherever I go  
Though I try and try to hide my feelings  
They always seems to show  
  
Then you try to say youre leaving me  
And I always have to say no  
Tell me why is it so  
  
That I never can say goodbye no no no no now  
I never can say goodbye  
  
Every time I think Ive had enough  
And start heading for the door  
Theres a very strange vibration  
Piercing me right through the core  
It says Turn around you fool you know you love him more and more  
Tell me why is it so  
  
Dont wanna let go  
Never can say goodbye  
Girl oo oo baby  
Never can say goodbye No no no no no oo  
Oh I never can say goodbye  
Girl oo oo  
  
I never can say goodbye No no no no no oo  
Never can say goodbye no no no no now  
I never can say goodbye  
  
I keep thinking that our problems  
Soon are all gonna work out  
But theres that same unhappy feeling  
Theres that anguish theres that doubt  
Its the same old dizzy hangup  
Cant do with you or without  
Tell me why is it so dont wanna let you go
