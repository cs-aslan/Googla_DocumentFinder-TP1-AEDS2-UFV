So this is the last treat of the night coming up right here  
This is a song this is a tour actually this is the first time weve played
this song on tour  
Ill spit it out eventually  
Anybody like the Deftones  
Got any Deftones fans in the house  
Put em up if you are  
Let me see you if you know the words to this shit and ill come down and sing
it with you  
Hey you big star guide me when its over  
Hey you big mood guide me to shelter  
Cause Im through when the two hits the six and its summer  
Cloud come  
Shove  
The sun  
Aside  
I think God is moving his tongue  
Theres no crowds in the streets  
And no sun  
In my own summer  
You guys feeling that  
Who can help me with this shit can you  
Can you help me with this shit  
Stay right here stay right here  
Hey you  
Stay right here  
Come on  
Yo yo  
What the fuck is going on  
Yea bring him over here  
Allright bro we gonna teach these mother fuckers this shit ok  
You guys gonna help us out right now  
Allright you guys  
Chester when youre ready bud  
The shade is a tool a device a savior  
See I try  
You better watch out  
And look up  
Where  
To the sky  
Why  
But my eyes burn  
Cloud come  
Shove it shove it shove it  
Shove  
Shove it  
The sun  
Aside  
Cloud come  
Shove it shove it shove it  
Shove  
Shove it shove it shove it  
The sun  
Shove it shove it shove it  
Aside  
I think God is moving his tongue  
Theres no crowds in the streets  
And no sun  
In my own summer
