I stand in my doorway as the moon rises high  
Over glorious ocean reflects the bright sky  
My heart it is aching so much I could die  
Ive known only the ocean since I was a boy  
Chorus  
And I spent my whole life out there on the sea  
Some government bastard now takes it from me  
Its not just the fish theyve taken my pride  
I feel so ashamed that I just want to hide  
I fished with my father so long long ago  
We were proud of our trade and in us it did show  
We held our heads high there was lots of fish then  
That was the time when we were proud men  
We challenged great storms and sometimes we won  
Faced death and disaster we rose with the sun  
We worked and we toiled we strained our men brane  
We were a proud people will we ere be again  
Chorus  
My father is gone now and the fish are gone too  
Abused and mismanaged oh what can we do  
Im too old to change but what of my sons  
How will they know that we werent the ones  
Dfo regulations permitted the rape  
Of our beautiful ocean from head land to cape  
They brought in big trollers they tore up our twine  
Politians dont care for whats yours or whats mine  
Chorus  
You brave Newfoundlanders now listen to me  
Shove the package to hell go back to the sea  
If we dont stand our ground we will fade away  
And the bones of our fathers will turn into clay  
And I spent my whole life out there on the sea  
Some government bastard now takes it from me  
Its not just the fish theyve taken my pride  
I feel so ashamed that I just want to die  
Back to the sea
