Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord  
Way up yonder great will be her reward  
Covenant woman shining like a morning star  
I know I can trust you to stay where you are  
  
And I just got to tell you  
I do intend  
To stay closer than any friend  
I just got to thank you  
Once again  
For making your prayers known  
Unto heaven for me  
And to you always so grateful  
I will forever be  
  
Ive been broken shattered like an empty cup  
Im just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up  
And I know He will do it cause Hes faithful and Hes true  
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you  
  
And I just got to tell you  
I do intend  
To stay closer than any friend  
I just got to thank you  
Once again  
For making your prayers known  
Unto heaven for me  
And to you always so grateful  
I will forever be
