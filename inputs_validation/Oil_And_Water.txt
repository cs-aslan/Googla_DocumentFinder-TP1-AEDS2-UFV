You and I are like oil and water  
Weve been trying trying trying  
To mix it up  
  
Weve been dancing on a volcano  
Weve been crying crying crying  
The oh blackened souls  
This wouldnt be the first time  
It will not be the last time  
There is no better soul that can shelter this weather  
  
Ive been smiling with birds on my shoulder  
Ive been dying dying dying  
To let them go  
  
Well this wouldnt be the first time  
It will not be the last time  
There is no better soul that could shelter this weather  
Babe this wouldnt be the first time  
It will not be the last time  
We tried to believe everything could get better  
  
Weve been  
Lying to each other hey babe  
Lets just call it call it call it  
What it is  
  
Oil and water wouldnt be the first time  
Oil and water wouldnt be the first time  
Oil and water wouldnt be the first time
