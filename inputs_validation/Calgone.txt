On my way home police car pulled me over  
After they left I puttered out of gas  
TripleA came but my card was expired  
I had to walk home and of course it rained half the time  
I tried to get some shuteye then I was abducted  
  
They put cold things in my butt  
They sampled a bit of my DNA  
They left me on top of my sheets  
I dreamt I went potty then woke up drenched in me  
This day sucked the hardest ever  
  
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today  
A little bit less than nothing would go my way  
I got up to toss my soiled sheets  
the hallway was dark and I stubbed my big toe  
It was then that I sensed the irony burning me  
then I heard the voice say  
Come sail aboard SS Nepenthe  
  
I suppose Im to blame for getting pulled over  
I guess Im the culprit for running out of gas  
Lets assume Im the guy who didnt pay his TripleA fee  
In actuality I let the zetas probe me  
Yesterday was all my fault  
  
I let negativity get the better of me  
Thank goodness for the bathtubs and suds  
They temporarily set free this quandary
