I got an invitation to anarchy camp  
There will be twistin fistin biting fighting all in an evening  
The soundtrack will go multi platinum  
Barbecue a boca while the effigies burn  
You may not want to stay and see how we take care of a turncoat  
Christianas kinda far away  
So come along with me  
We can dance and trip and be anarchists  
We gotta get the manual and put it in the oven til it cooks  
Then were gonna take the ashes to the wassail  
And use them to spike the punch  
  
Rules of anarchy camp reckless abandonment  
Random acts of dumbness will be rewarded  
If you see somebody taking charge youll be expected to beat them  
Cause everyone whos no one will be participating  
No one who is someone will ever get to know the joys of anarchism  
Destruction of the system  
  
So come along with us salad days and nights on the anarchic bus  
Were gonna pick up indigents and crusties and a half a dozen nuts  
And were never coming home  
  
Underwater basketweaving we got some arts and crafts  
Methamphetamine symposiums they last a couple days  
African killer spelling bees you better get it right  
Bowling in ice hockey rinks of course checking is allowed  
Anarchy camps never inert you think we dont know that its  
Not much fun til someone gets hurt our only motto  
So were greasing up the rusty vert ramp  
Time to make some reservations for next years Anarchy Camp
