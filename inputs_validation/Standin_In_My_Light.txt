Well I finally found you out  
All through your mess of dreams  
You wont make it to the night  
And your standing in my light  
You know youve been bad for me  
You aint got the weight to hate  
But you aint no pretty sight  
And your standing in my light  
  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light yeah  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
  
Now when your old man beats the drums  
Gotta run run run thats dumb  
A little less ego A little more fight  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
  
Things go bad and the risks get high  
Sweeping dead bodies cross an open sky  
You took my pictures from your walls  
Aint gonna trade with the pain of the New York Dolls  
  
Move over cause your standin in my  
Move over cause your standin in my  
Move over cause your standin in my  
Move over cause your standin in my  
Move over cause you standin in my  
Move over cause your standin in my  
Move over cause you standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Yeah alright  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
  
I wish you luck on your very last chance  
Cause I knew you blew it at the song and dance  
You froze my feelings but thats alright  
And your standing in my light
