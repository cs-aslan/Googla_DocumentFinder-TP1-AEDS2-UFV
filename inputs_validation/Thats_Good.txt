Everybody its a good thing  
Everybody wants a good thing  
Everybody aint it true that  
Everybodys looking for the same thing  
  
Aint it true theres just no doubt  
Theres some things that you cant do without  
And thats good  
Aint it true as the sun that shines  
You got yours and you got mine  
And thats good  
  
Everybody just like you its true  
Everybody wants a good thing too  
  
Everybody its a good thing  
Everybody wants a good thing  
Everybody aint it true that  
Everybodys looking for the same thing  
  
Aint it true theres room for doubt  
Maybe some things that you can do without  
And thats good  
  
Everybody just like you its true  
Everybody wants a good thing too  
  
Now lets have a great big hand  
For everybody who can understand  
Lifes a bee without a buzz  
Its going great till you get stung  
And let us not forget to toast  
Everyone who might have missed the boat  
And to everybody else who waits  
Until the next one sails in again  
  
Repeats  
Everybody its a good thing  
Aint it true its a monumental good thing
