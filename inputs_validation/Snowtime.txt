Snowtime snowtime oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Snowtime snowtime oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
The snow is falling  
the worlds dressed in white tonight  
and I remember another cold December  
when I held you tight  
  
And Im recalling  
the joys that you were there to share  
the stars burned brightly and I clung to you tightly  
as the snow clung to your hair  
  
Your love quickly faded out of sight  
like the snow on the ground  
When spring showed her April smiling face  
you were no longer around  
  
Ill be here waiting  
Ill always be true to you  
till winter finds you and falling snow reminds you  
that you love me too  
that you love me too  
  
Snowtime snowtime oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Snowtime snowtime oh oh oh oh oh oh
