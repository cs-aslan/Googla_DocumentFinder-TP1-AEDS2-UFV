Listen to the money talk  
Listen to it scream  
Only lots of paper  
But it haunts them in their dreams  
  
Doesnt matter who they are  
Doesnt matter where  
Some people cant get enough  
That is their only care  
  
Going in for the kill  
In for the kill  
  
In for the kill in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill in for the finish  
Theyve got to win its the only way  
  
In for the kill  
  
Sitting in a darkened room  
Sharing out the land  
Someone holds a document  
And smiles as they shake hands  
  
Going in for the kill  
In for the kill  
  
In for the kill in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill in for the finish  
Theyve got to win its the only way  
  
In for the kill  
  
Everywhere you wander  
Wander where you will  
Someones making deals  
And going in for the kill  
  
In for the kill in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill in for the finish  
Theyve got to win its the only way  
  
In for the kill in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill in for the finish  
Theyve got to win its the only way  
  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill
