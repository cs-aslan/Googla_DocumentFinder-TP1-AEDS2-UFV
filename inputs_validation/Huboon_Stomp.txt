Well Im a huboon baby  
Im a cross between a human and an ape  
Im all decked out  
Im gonna hoot Im gonna root Im gonna rape  
  
People look at me and laugh and make fun of my face  
I laugh right back  
I dont want to be part of the human race  
I did it to myself  
Now somebodys gonna be sorry  
  
Well Im a huboon baby  
Gonna mess around with all you fools  
Im all pumped up gonna romp bone and stomp  
Im gonna rule  
  
I had the operation  
Nothing else left to do  
Well lookit here Ive been hurt  
Gonna hurt you  
  
Now somebodys gonna be sorry  
Like all you wankers and you slime  
And you rightwing pinheads  
Who make screwing a big crime  
You tittytwisted up my life  
And pissed on all my dreams  
You made me hate myself  
Now come on shoot me  
Set me free  
  
I did it to myself  
Now somebodys gonna be sorry  
  
Well Im a huboon baby  
Ill grow up to be the president

Im really freaked Im really bent  
Big town mommas better hurry  
Hide your little girls
