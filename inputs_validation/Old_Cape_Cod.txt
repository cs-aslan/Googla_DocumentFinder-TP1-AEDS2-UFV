If youre fond of sand dunes and salty air  
Quaint little villages here and there  
Youre sure to fall in love with old cape cod  
  
If you like the taste of a lobster stew  
Served by a window with an ocean view  
Youre sure to fall in love with old cape cod  
  
Winding roads that seem to beckon you  
Miles of green beneath the skies of blue  
Church bells chimin on a Sunday morn  
Remind you of the town where you were born  
  
If you spend an evening youll want to stay  
Watching the moonlight on old cape cod bay  
Youre sure to fall in love with old cape cod  
  
Youre sure to fall in love in love in love  
Youre sure to fall in love in love  
With old cape cod old cape cod
