Well I dont follow any trend  
I dont sulk for hours on end  
I dont wanna reach out n punch someone  
I am what I hated when I was young  
I dont wear designer clothes  
I aint got pins in my nose  
I aint got a tattoo on my bum  
I am what I hated when I was young  
  
Poverty was a wonderful thing everyone enjoyed  
We were eatin grass not smokin it  
Wasnt like this when I was a boy  
Wasnt like this when I was a boy  
  
I dont rob old peoples homes  
I dont steal no cellular phones  
I kinda like my Dad and Mom  
I am what I hated when I was young  
I dont holler I dont hoot  
I dont act like a nincompoop  
I dont hide when the police come  
I am what I hated when I was young  
  
Im slowin down Im getting old  
N my back is getting bad  
I just sit n moan all day  
Wasnt like this when I was a lad  
Wasnt like this when I was a lad  
  
Comb my hair brush my teeth  
Wash my feet more than once a week  
N I never leave my flies undone  
I am what I hated when I was young  
Im the original mixed up kid  
I aint proud of what I did  
Now Im older calmed down some  
I hate what I used to be when I was young  
I hate what I used to be when I was young  
I hate what I used to be when I was young
