Called her name but the wind blew strong  
I called in vain though I tried so long  
Called the sea to bring her home  
But the sea dont hear and Im still alone  
I feel an emptiness inside  
Something within me I cant hide  
  
Standing here looking at the sky  
But the light I see cant tell me why  
I feel an emptiness inside  
Something within me I cant hide  
  
Every time I stop to think  
Thats the time I get lonely  
Thats the time it hurts the most  
Every time I get lonely  
  
What went wrong who am I to blame  
Did I take too long to call her name  
  
I feel an emptiness inside  
Something within me I cant hide
