I make my living off the evening news  
Just give me somethingsomething I can use  
People love it when you lose  
They love dirty laundry  
  
Well I coulda been an actor but I wound up here  
I just have to look good I dont have to be clear  
Come and whisper in my ear  
Give us dirty laundry  
  
Kick em when theyre up  
Kick em when theyre down  
Kick em when theyre up  
Kick em when theyre down  
Kick em when theyre up  
Kick em when theyre down  
Kick em when theyre up  
Kick em all around  
  
We got the bubbleheadedbleachblond who  
Comes on at five  
She can tell you bout the plane crash with a gleam  
In her eye  
Its interesting when people die  
Give us dirty laundry  
  
Can we film the operation  
Is the head dead yet  
You know the boys in the newsroom got a  
Running bet  
Get the widow on the set  
We need dirty laundry  
  
You dont really need to find out whats going on  
You dont really want to know just how far its gone  
Just leave well enough alone  
Eat your dirty laundry  
  
Kick em when theyre up  
Kick em when theyre down  
Kick em when theyre up  
Kick em when theyre down  
  
Kick em when theyre up  
Kick em when theyre down  
Kick em when theyre stiff  
Kick em all around  
  
Dirty little secrets  
Dirty little lies  
We got our dirty little fingers in everybodys pie  
We love to cut you down to size  
We love dirty laundry  
  
We can do The Innuendo  
We can dance and sing  
When its said and done we havent told you a thing  
We all know that crap is king  
Give us dirty laundry
