Sonny dont go away I am here all alone  
And your daddys a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And Im feelin so tired Im not all that strong  
Sonny lives on a farm in a wide open space  
Kick off your sneakers and let go the race  
And you can lay down your head by a sweet river bed  
But Sonny always remembers what it was his mama said  
Sonny dont go away I am here all alone  
And your daddys a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And Im feelin so tired Im not all that strong  
Sonny carries a load though hes barely a man  
There aint much to do yet he does what he can  
He watches the sea from a room by the stairs  
The waves keep on rollin theyve done that for years  
Sonny dont go away I am here all alone  
And your daddys a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And Im feelin so tired Im not all that strong  
Its a hundred miles to town Sonnys never been there  
Yet he goes to the highway and stands there and stares  
And the mail comes at four and the mailman is old  
But he still keeps his dreams full of silver and gold  
Sonny dont go away I am here all alone  
And your daddys a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And Im feelin so tired Im not all that strong  
Sonnys dreams cant be real theyre just stories hes read  
Theyre just stars in his eyes theyre just dreams in his head  
Still he longs in his mind for the wild world outside  
And I know I cant hold him though Ive tried  
And Ive tried and Ive tried  
Sonny dont go away I am here all alone  
And your daddys a sailor who never comes home  
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on  
And Im feelin so tired Im not all that strong
