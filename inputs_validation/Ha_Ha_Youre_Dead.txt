How do you get your sleep at night  
How did you get your noose so tight  
Like chewing on tinfoil its so much fun  
Gonna be dead before your gone  
  
Cause look how things have gotten  
And Ill be happy so I wont pretend  
And Ill be cheering that youre going down  
And Ill be laughing Ill be laughing  
  
How many feelings can you steal  
Gotta be part of your appeal  
I can see through you cause youre wearing thin  
Like chewing on tinfoil once again  
  
Ha ha youre dead  
And Im so happy  
In loving memory  
Of your demise  
  
When your ship is going down  
Ill go out and paint the town  
Ha ha youre dead  
Ha ha youre dead  
Ha ha youre dead  
  
ha ha ha  
  
Ha ha youre dead  
The joke is over  
You were an asshole  
And now youre gone  
As your ship is going down  
Ill stand by and watch you drown  
  
Ha ha youre dead  
Youre gonna be dead  
Just remember what I said  
Ha ha youre dead  
Ha ha youre dead  
Ha ha youre dead
