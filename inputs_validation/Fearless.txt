Theres somethin bout the way  
The street looks when its just rained  
Theres a glow off the pavement  
Walk me to the car  
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there  
In the middle of the parking lot  
Yeah  
  
Were drivin down the road  
I wonder if you know  
Im tryin so hard not to get caught up now  
But youre just so cool  
Run your hands through your hair  
Absent mindedly makin me want you  
  
Chorus  
And I dont know how it gets better than this  
You take my hand and drag me head first  
Fearless  
And I dont know why but with you Id dance  
In a storm in my best dress  
Fearless  
  
So baby drive slow  
Til we run out of road in this one horse town  
I wanna stay right here in this passengers seat  
You put your eyes on me  
In this moment now capture it remember it  
  
Chorus  
  
Well you stood there with me in the doorway  
my hands shake  
Im not usually this way but  
You pull me in and Im a little more brave  
Its the first kiss its flawless really something its fearless  
  
Chorus
