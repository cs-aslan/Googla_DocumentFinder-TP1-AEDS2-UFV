The killer lives inside me I can feel him move  
Sometimes hes lightly sleeping in the quiet of his room  
But then his eyes will rise and stare through mine  
Hell speak my words and slice my mind inside  
  
The killer lives  
  
The angels live inside me I can feel them smile  
Their presence strokes and soothes the tempest in my mind  
And their love can heal the wounds that I have wrought  
They watch me as I go to fall well I know I shall be caught  
  
For the angels live  
  
How can I be free  
How can I get help  
Am I really me  
Am I someone else  
  
But stalking in my cloisters hang the acolytes of gloom  
And Deaths Head throws his cloak onto the corner of my room and I am doomed  
But laughing in my courtyard play the pranksters of my youth  
And solemn waiting Old Man in the gables of the roof he tells me truth  
  
And I too live inside me and very often dont know who I am  
I know Im not a hero I hope that Im not damned  
Im just a man and killers angels all are these  
Dictators saviors refugees  
In war and peace  
As long as Man lives  
  
Im just a man and killers angels all are these  
Dictators saviors refugees
