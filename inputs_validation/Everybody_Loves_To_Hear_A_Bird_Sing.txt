Sometimes birds dont have enough to eat  
Theres not enough food in the fields or the streets  
There are too many cities where there used to be trees so its left up to you
and me  
Everybody loves to hear a bird sing whistle  
The prettiest music you have ever heard heres how to make friends with the
bird  
First you get some peanut butter out of a jar  
And you can buy a bag of bird seed anywhere  
You mix it all together and you put it on the ground  
And pretty soon the birds come around  
Everybody loves to hear  
Some people buy spray and they spray it on the land  
They kill all the little bitty bugs that they can  
The birds eat up the bugs and it makes them sick I wish we didnt have to do
that  
Cause everybody loves to hear  
Right now youre young and youre not very tall  
Youre really very busy and youre rally very small  
Someday when youre older and things go wrong youve gotta need a pretty bird
song  
Because everybody loves to hear
