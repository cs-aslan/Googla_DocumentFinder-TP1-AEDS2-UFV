Rows of lights in a circle of steel  
Where you place your bets on a great big wheel  
High windows flickerin down through the snow  
A time you know  
Sights and sounds of the people goin round  
Everybodys in step with the season  
  
A child is born to a welfare case  
Where the rats run around like they own the place  
The room is chilly the building is old  
Thats how it goes  
The doctors found on his welfare round  
And he comes and he leaves on the double  
  
Deck The Halls was the song they played  
In the flat next door where they shout all day  
She tips her gin bottle back till its gone  
The child is strong  
A week a day they will take it away  
For they know about all her bad habits  
  
Christmas dawns and the snow lets up  
And the sun hits the handle of her heirloom cup  
She hides her face in her hands for a while  
Says look here child  
Your fathers pride was his means to provide  
And hes servin three years for that reason  
  
Rows of lights in a circle of steel  
Where you place your bets on a great big wheel  
High windows flickerin down through the snow  
A time you know  
Sights and sounds of the people goin round  
Everybodys in step with the season
