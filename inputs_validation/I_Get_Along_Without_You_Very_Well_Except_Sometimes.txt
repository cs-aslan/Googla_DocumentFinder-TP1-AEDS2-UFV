I get along without you very well of course I do  
Except when soft rains fall and drip from leaves  
Then I recall the thrill of being sheltered in your arms  
Of course I do but I get along without you very well  
  
Ive forgotten you just like I should of course I have  
Except to hear your name  
Or someones laugh thats just the same  
But Ive forgotten you just like I should  
  
What a guy what a fool am I  
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon  
Whats in store should I fall once more  
No its best that I stick to my tune  
  
I get along without you very well of course I do  
Except perhaps in spring  
But I should never ever think of spring  
For that would surely break my heart in two  
  
Whats in store should I fall once more  
No its best that I stick to my tune
