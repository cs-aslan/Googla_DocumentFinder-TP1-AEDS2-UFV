Sweet Guinevere youre off to the coal town tonight  
And your young brother Ernies up in Pittsburgh PA  
You know mother loves you and dads in the mine  
So dont go to the coal town Guinevere if youre kind  
  
She loves a young man and he lives in the town  
He leaves the house early for he works underground  
He makes a good wage for a coal miners son  
And shes a bit pretty just turned twentyone  
  
Sweet Guinevere youre off to the coal town tonight  
And your young brother Ernies up in Pittsburgh PA  
You know mother loves you and dads in the mine  
So dont go to the coal town Guinevere shut the blind  
  
She knows her good mothers not feelin no pain  
She remembers an explosion and the black falling rain  
She paints her thin lips in her dewyeyed way  
Then she says to the daughter dear daughter I pray  
  
Sweet Guinevere youre off to the coal town tonight  
And your young brother Ernies up in Pittsburgh PA  
You know mother loves you and dads in the mine  
So dont go to the coal town Guinevere if youre kind
