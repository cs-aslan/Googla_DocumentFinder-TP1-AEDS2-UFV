Verse 1  
Wake up  
My baby still looks amazing with no makeup  
Damn it I knew the second that you came up  
From underneath the covers  
Said I wanna meet your mother your daddy your sister and your brother  
One week the time it took you to tell me that you love me  
Packed all of my shit and moved across the country  
And now were buying diamonds  
Saying its only 20 karats it cant be that hard to find it baby  
  
PreChorus  
Your touch has made me a believer  
Your love is all I ever needed  
And shes the only one Id follow for eternity  
  
Chrous x2

She takes like the sunshine kissing me  
Even sweeter than honey on a bumblebee  
She said honey if you want to you can come with me  
Shes got me runnin round and round
