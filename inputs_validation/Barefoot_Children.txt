Scratch my back with a lightning bolt  
Thunder rolls like a bass drum note  
The sound of the weather is Heavens ragtime band  
We all fell down from the Milky Way  
Hangin round here till the Judgment Day  
Heaven only knows who is in command  
Barefoot children in the rain  
Got no need to explain  
Wed be swingin on a ball and chain  
Its always understood by those who play the game  
Barefoot children in the rain  
Show me yours and Ill show you mine  
Take me back to days full of monkeyshines  
Bouncin on a bubble full of trouble in the summer sun  
Keep your raft from the riverboat  
Fiction over fact always has my vote  
And wrinkles only go where the smiles have been  
Barefoot children in the rain  
Got no need to explain  
Wed be swingin on a ball and chain  
Its always understood by those who play the game  
Barefoot children in the rain  
Barefoot children in the rain  
Scratch my back with a lightning bolt  
Thunder rolls like a bass drum note  
The sound of the weather is Heavens ragtime band  
The sky turns blue and the sun appears  
But the questions still what are we doin here  
I dont think the answers close at hand  
Barefoot children in the rain  
Got no need to explain  
Wed be swingin on a ball and chain  
Its always understood by those who play the game  
Barefoot children in the rain  
In the rain  
In the rain
