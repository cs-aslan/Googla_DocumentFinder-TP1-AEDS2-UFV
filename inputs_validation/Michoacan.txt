Woke up this morning the border was burning my mind  
Things that I seen that I couldnt be leaving behind me  
Down in this hole in the ground there aint nothing to see  
But down in Michoacan paradise waits for me  
  
North of the border the bodies are bought and theyre sold boy  
Me and a brother was caught turning green into gold  
Im gonna pay for my crime til the day that Im free  
But down in Michoacan paradise waits for me  
  
A rusty car rode across the border I was inside  
I had two dogs my red guitar and my teenage bride  
We took a look at a shot in the dark and we found a home  
Where the flowers bloom in Michoacan  
  
A rusty car rode across the border I was inside  
I had two dogs my red guitar and my teenage bride  
Im gonna clean up my act and go back to where I belong  
Where the flowers bloom in Michoacan
