To spend one night with you  
In our old rendezvous  
And reminisce with you  
Thats my desire  
  
To be where gypsies play  
Down in that ole cafe  
Well dance till break of day  
Thats my desire  
  
Well sip a little glass of wine  
Ill gaze into your eyes divine  
Ill feel the touch of your lips  
Pressing on mine  
  
To hear you whisper low  
Just when its time to go  
Darling I love you so  
Thats my desire  
  
Instrumental  
  
To hear you whisper low  
Doggone you know its time to go  
Darling I love you so  
Youre my desire  
  
Though you found someone new  
Ill always love you  
Thats my desire
