I sat by the ocean  
And drank a potion baby to erase you  
Face down in the boulevard yet I couldnt face you  
  
There aint no use in cryin  
It doesnt change anything so baby what good does it do  
Your friends theyll sympathize maybe I dont need them to  
  
Imagine Id be your one and only  
Instead Im the lonely one  
You me and a lie  
Silence is closer  
Were passing ships in the night  
  
Theres nowhere to run away  
Said Boy if you want love youll have to go and find it with someone new  
Do you know who you really are Are you sure its really you  
Lies are a funny thing  
They slip through your fingertips because they never happened to you  
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view  
  
Imagine Id be your one and only  
Instead Im the lonely one  
You me and a lie  
Silence is closer  
Were passing ships in the night  
You me and a lie  
Silence is closer  
Were passing ships in the night  
Into the light left with nowhere to hide  
  
Closer and closer  
Were crashing ships in the night
