Transliteration  
  
Et haeven nashakti betsinat chalomah  
Ki ani hamizmor vehi hadmamah  
Ki hi hachidah vaani hechad  
Ki shneinu koratsnu minetsach echad  
  
Et haeven nashakti et oshrah haboded  
Hi shvuat emunim veani haboged  
Ani hacholef vehi hakayam  
Hi sodot habriah veani  giluyam  
Vaeda ki nagati belev neelam  
Ani hamshorer vehi  haolam  
  
Translation  
I kissed the rock in her chilly dream  
For she is the silence and I am the scream  
She is the riddle and I want to know  
Both of us sprung from eternitys bow  
  
I kissed the rock her lonely crater  
She has sworn loyalty I am the traitor  
She is forever I am just passing through  
Shes the old secret I am the new  
  
Her silent heart touched she helped me to know it  
She is the universe I am the poet
