Mirror mirror  
Just watchin with your eye of glass  
Youre just a fortune wheel  
With something that I want to ask  
  
Mirror mirror  
Got my fate lyin in your hands  
Youre the fool youre the juggler  
Hangman and lover youre not like no other  
  
Take a look into my eyes  
Tell me what you see  
Take a look into my eyes  
Tell me is it true  
Take a look into my eyes  
Oh when I look at you  
Take a look into my eyes  
Tell me is it me  
Is it really me  
  
Mirror mirror  
Gotta know just what you see  
My crystal ball  
Youre lookin so sly and so sleazy  
  
Mirror mirror  
Hangin there with that crack in your eye  
You make me stumble make me blind  
Time after time and line by line  
  
Chorus  
  
Mirror mirror  
Oh tell me  
Youre the fool youre the juggler  
I aint met a lover youre like no other  
  
Take a look into my eyes  
Tell me what you see  
Take a look into my eyes  
Tell me is it true  
Take a look into my eyes  
Oh it just cant last  
Take a look into my eyes  
Gonna have to smash the glass  
  
Take a look into my eyes  
Take a look into my eyes  
Take a look  
Take a look into my eyes  
Oh yeah  
Take a look into my eyes  
Take a look into my eyes  
Take a look into my eyes  
Take a look into my eyes  
Take a look  
Take a look into my eyes  
Look into my eyes  
Take a look into my eyes  
Tell me if its me  
Baby baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby baby
