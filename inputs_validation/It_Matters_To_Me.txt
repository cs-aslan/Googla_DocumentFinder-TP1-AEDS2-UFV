Baby tell me whered you ever learn  
To fight without sayin a word  
Then waltz back into my life  
Like its all gonna be alright  
Dont you know how much it hurts  
  
When we dont talk  
When we dont touch  
When it doesnt feel like were even in love  
It matters to me  
  
When I dont know what to say  
Dont know what to do  
Dont know if it really even matters to you  
How can I make you see  
It matters to me  
  
Maybe I still dont understand  
The distance between a woman and a man  
So tell me how far it is  
And how you can love like this  
Cause Im not sure I can  
  
When we dont talk  
When we dont touch  
When it doesnt feel like were even in love  
It matters to me  
  
When I dont know what to say  
Dont know what to do  
Dont know if it really even matters to you  
How can I make you see  
It matters to me  
  
Whoa I dont know what to say  
Dont know what to do  
Dont know if it really even matters to you  
How can I make you see  
Oh it matters to me  
Oh it matters to me  
It matters to me
