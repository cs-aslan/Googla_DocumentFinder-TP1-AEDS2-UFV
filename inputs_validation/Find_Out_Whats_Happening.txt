Baby you know me well  
You know I mean what I say  
Before I say farewell  
Ill give you just another day  
  
Youd better find out whats happening  
Find out whats happening before long Oh yeah  
If you dont find out whats happening  
Youre gonna find out that Ive gone now Oh yeah  
  
Tell me what youre gonna do  
Youd better make up your mind  
It all depends on you  
Im leaving you behind  
  
Youd better find out whats happening  
Find out whats happening before long Oh yeah  
If you dont find out whats happening  
Youre gonna find out that Ive gone now Oh yeah

But if you dont come through  
You wont ever see me again  
  
Youd better find out whats happening  
Find out whats happening before long Oh yeah  
If you dont find out whats happening  
Youre gonna find out that Ive gone now Oh yeah
