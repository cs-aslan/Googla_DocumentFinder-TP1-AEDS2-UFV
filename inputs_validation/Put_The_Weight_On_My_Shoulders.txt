Put the weight on my shoulders  
Take the load off of your mind  
Cause the headwinds that blow  
Will fade away in time  
Rest yourself on my waters  
Take the lifeline from me  
Rise above what has passed  
And let yourself be free  
I only know what love must bear  
Through laiden times I will be there  
And when your down Ill break the fall  
Loose the weight on my shoulders  
It aint no weight at all  
I only know what love must do  
When fortune cries Ill follow you  
And when your down Ill break your fall  
Put the weight on my shoulders  
It aint no weight at all  
Put the weight on my shoulders  
See you star how it shines  
Cause theyre so many dreams  
Left to find  
Put the weight on my shoulders   
Put the weight on my shoulders   
Put the weight on my shoulders   
Put the weight on my shoulders   
Put the weight on my shoulders
