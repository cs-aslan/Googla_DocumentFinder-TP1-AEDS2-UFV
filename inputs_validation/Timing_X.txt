She was walking all alone  
Down the street in the alley  
Her name was Sally  
I never touched her  
  
She never saw it  
When she was hit by space junk  
She was  by space junk  
She was  by space junk  
  
In New York Miami Beach  
Heavy metal fell in Cuba  
Angola Saudi Arabia  
On Christmas Eve said Nomad  
  
A Soviet sputnik hit Africa  
India in Venezuela in Texas Kansas  
Its falling fast Peru too  
It keeps coming it keeps coming it keeps coming  
  
And now Im mad about space junk  
Im all burned out about space junk  
Ooh walk and talk about space junk  
It smashed my babys head space junk  
And now my Sallys dead space junk
