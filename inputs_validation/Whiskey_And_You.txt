Theres a bottle on the dresser by your ring  
And its empty so right now I dont feel a thing  
Ill be hurtin when I wake up on the floor  
And Ill be over it by noon  
And thats the difference between the whiskey and you  
  
Come tomorrow I can walk in any store  
It aint a problem  
Yeah theyll always sell me more  
But your forgiveness is something I cant buy  
Aint a thing that I can do  
And thats the difference between the whiskey and you  
  
Chorus  
Ones the devil and one keeps driving me insane  
At times I wonder if they aint both the same  
Ones a liar that helps hide me from my pain  
And ones a long hard bitter truth  
And thats the difference between the whiskey and you  
  
Ive got a problem but it aint like what you think  
I drink cause Im lonesome and Im lonesome cause I drink  
If I dont break down and bring it on myself itll hit right out of the blue  
And thats the difference between the whiskey and you  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah thats the difference between the whiskey and you
