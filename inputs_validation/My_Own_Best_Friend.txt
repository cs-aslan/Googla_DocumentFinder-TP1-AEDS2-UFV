Im beginning to like you  
But you know that aint right  
Cause youll just twist and twist and twist  
Till Im all crooked inside  
Youll take all you gave me  
Like it never was there  
And I think that I might no I know  
Yes I will help you there  
Cause Ive done it before and Id do it again  
Cause its the only time  
That makes me feel like Im  
My own best friend  
Im a victim of friction I got too close to see  
Yeah we sparked in the dark and God hung a light on me  
The lamp gets real heavy it hangs from my heart  
And it comes and it goes till I cant tell the difference apart  
But Ive done it before and Id do it again  
Cause its the only time  
That makes me feel like Im  
My own best friend  
So many people say it will never work out that way  
You cant stand the heat  
While youre watching your heart  
Just melt away in the basement on a rainy day  
Theres motel in Shreveport  
Dont ask me where please  
They check in they check out  
By the light of the color TVs  
The maid calls you honey  
She makes your bed slow  
And she speaks of the sheets that dont fit  
But you know that she knows  
Ive done it before and Id do it again  
Cause its the only time  
That makes me feel like Im  
My own best friend my own best friend  
My own best friend my own best friend
