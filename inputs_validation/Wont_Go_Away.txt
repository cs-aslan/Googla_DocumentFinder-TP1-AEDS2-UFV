Dear baby baby  
Wont you  
I go crazy crazy  
For you  
Wont you tell me tell me  
What to do  
I go crazy crazy  
For you  
  
Cause the way you look at me  
I can say you set me free  
And no matter what you say  
I wont go away  
I wont go away  
  
I see your world the world is you  
I see baby baby blue  
Everyday is a day to get through  
Till I see baby baby blue  
  
And the way you look at me  
I can say you set me free  
And no matter what you say  
I wont go away  
I wont go away  
  
And it takes  
Such a long time to get through this  
Such a long time to find this kiss  
And I cant forget it  
Im not ready yet  
  
And I came such a long way  
From where you are  
Now Im falling from this star  
And I cant forget it  
Im not ready yet  
  
Cause the way you look at me  
I can say you set me free  
And no matter what you say  
I wont go away  
I wont go away  
  
Heal me baby baby wont you  
I go crazy crazy  
For you  
Wont you tell me tell me  
Something new  
I am crazy crazy  
For you  
I am crazy crazy  
For you  
I am crazy  
Crazy for you
