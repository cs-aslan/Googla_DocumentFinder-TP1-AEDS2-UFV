You can laugh  
You can cry  
But you cant look me  
Look me in the eye  
Youre lost forever  
You can walk  
Yes you can run  
But youll never be number one  
Youre lost forever  
Theres a church bell ringing  
On a mountain top  
Youll never hear it if you dont stop  
Big bird flying in a clear blue sky  
Dont it make you stop to think  
And wonder why  
You may lose  
You may win  
But Ill never talk to you again  
Youre lost forever  
From my memory  
From my memory
