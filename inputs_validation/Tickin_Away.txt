The clock above the bar  
Is telling me its 1215  
Its not such a gentle reminder  
That Im where I shouldnt be  
  
I just keep waiting for something to happen  
Waitin for somebody to come walkin in  
Somebody as perfect as you were  
So I can try it again  
  
But chances are so hard to come by  
And the second one is impossible to find  
The clock keeps runnin and the odds keep getting higher  
That its all just a fantasy of mine  
  
But I shouldnt be thinkin about it  
I shouldnt be worried about it  
Its just a clock on the wall  
But its tickin away  
Its tickin away  
Its tickin away  
Its tickin away  
  
I suppose I should cut all my losses  
Go home with a sixpack of beer  
There aint nobody in the world like you baby  
If there was she wouldnt be coming in here  
  
But I shouldnt be thinkin about it  
I shouldnt be worried about it  
Its just a clock on the wall  
But its tickin away  
Its tickin away  
Its just a clock on the wall but  
Its tickin away  
Its tickin away  
Its tickin away  
Its just a clock on the wall but  
Its tickin away  
  
I suppose I should cut all my losses  
Go home with a sixpack of beer
