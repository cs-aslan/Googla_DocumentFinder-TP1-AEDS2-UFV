Said Farewell To My Last Hotel It Was Never Much Kind Of Abode  
Glasgow Town Never Brought Me Down When I Was Heading Out On The Road  
Carlisle City Never Looked So Pretty And The Kendal Freeways Fast  
Slowdown Driver Want To Stay Alive I Want To Make This Journey Last  
Chorus  
Helen Hell On Wheels Aint Nobody Else Gonna Know The Way She Feels  
Helen Hell On Wheels And They Never Gonna Take Her Away  
  
M6 South Down To Liverpool Where They Play The West Coast Sound  
Sailor Sam He Came From Birmingham But He Never Will Be Found  
Doing Fine When A London Sign Greets Me Like A Long Lost Friend  
Mister Motor Wont You Check Her Out Shes Got To Take Me Back Again  
  
Chorus
