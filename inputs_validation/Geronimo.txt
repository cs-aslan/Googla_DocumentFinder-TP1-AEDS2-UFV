Dont want to think about it anymore  
Lying curled and naked on the floor  
And I dont want to hear those words you say  
What were they anyway  
  
Chorus  
Whoaoh  
Whoaoh  
So here I go  
So here I go so here I go  
Whoaoh  
Whoaoh  
Geronimo  
  
Dont want to get up outta bed today  
It seems much harder than it was yesterday  
And I dont want to hear those words you say  
What were they anyway  
What were they anyway  
  
Chorus  
  
Lets leave today  
And forget everything  
Cant really take this place  
So what you say  
  
Lets leave it all behind  
And dont look back  
We wont rewind this time  
Lets get away  
  
Chorus x2
