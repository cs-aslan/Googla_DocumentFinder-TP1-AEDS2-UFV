I wont pray here  
Or bow my head  
I wont praise your name  
I wont kneel down  
  
I wont pray to you  
On this side of sane Oh Lord  
I wont pray to you  
On this side of hell Father  
I wont pray to you  
On this side of heaven again  
  
I dont need faith  
Forgiveness of sin  
I dont need saving  
I dont need lies  
  
I dont believe  
In the angel wars Oh Lord  
I dont believe  
In the virgin birth Father  
I dont believe  
In the cross on the hill Jesus  
I dont believe  
In the kindness of God to man  
  
Ill drive a stake  
Through the black of your heart Oh Lord  
Ill pull down your temples  
And burn every word Father  
Ill kill all the angels  
That show me The Light Jesus  
Ill drift into darkness  
And tear out the soul of God
