Verse 1  
Maybe it was all too much  
Too much for a man to take  
Everythings bound to break  
Sooner or later sooner or later  
Youre all that I can trust  
Facing the darkest days  
Everyone ran away  
But were gonna stay here were gonna stay here  
  
PreChorus  
Ahh ahh  
I know youre scared tonight  
Ahh ahh  
Ill never leave your side  
  
Chorus  
When it all falls when it all falls down  
Ill be your fire when the lights go out  
When theres no one no one else around  
Well be two souls in a ghost town  
  
PostChorus  
When the world gets cold Ill be your cover  
Lets just hold onto each other  
When it all falls when it all falls down  
Well be two souls in a ghost town  
  
Verse 2  
Tell me how we got this far  
Every man for himself  
Everythings gone to hell  
We gotta stay strong were gonna hold on  
This world has turned to dust  
All weve got left is love  
Might as well start with us  
Singing a new song something to build on  
  
PreChorus  
Ahh ahh  
I know youre scared tonight  
Ahh ahh  
Ill never leave your side  
  
Chorus  
When it all falls when it all falls down  
Ill be your fire when the lights go out  
When theres no one no one else around  
Well be two souls in a ghost town  
  
PostChorus  
When the world gets cold Ill be your cover  
Lets just hold onto each other  
When it all falls when it all falls down  
Well be two souls in a ghost town  
  
Bridge  
I know were all right cause well never be alone  
In this mad mad in this mad mad world  
Even with no light were gonna shine like gold  
In this mad mad in this mad mad world  
  
Chorus  
When it all falls when it all falls down  
Ill be your fire when the lights go out  
When theres no one no one else around  
Well be two souls in a ghost town  
  
Chorus  
When it all falls when it all falls down  
Ill be your fire when the lights go out  
When theres no one no one else around  
Well be two souls in a ghost town  
  
PostChorus  
When the world gets cold Ill be your cover  
Lets just hold onto each other  
When it all falls when it all falls down  
Well be two souls in a ghost town
