Hes got nothing to say hes got no excuse  
Hes just made that way and hes gonna stay that way  
Like a dog on the loose in a firework display in a world of his own  
No no no he wont back down or go running back home  
  
Hes come a long way in life  
Hes got a long way to go  
He dont even know he dont care because  
Hes growing up the hard way  
In and out of trouble every day  
Growing up the hard way  
Now no tellin where youll end up boy  
  
And hes got nothing to say like hes lost for the worlds his mind is in a
daze  
Thats his way its just a little game he plays  
Hes got nowhere to run while the city sleeps he wanders alone  
Cuttin through the steel and the hearts of stone  
  
Hes come a long way in life  
Hes got a long way to go  
He dont even know but he dont care because  
Hes growing up the hard way  
In and out of trouble every day  
Growing up the hard way  
Youd better walk the straight and narrow  
  
Growing up the hard way  
In and out of trouble every day  
Growing up the hard way  
Never know what youre in for boy  
  
Hes come a long way in life  
Hes got a long way to go  
He dont wanna know and he dont care because  
Hes growing up the hard way  
In and out of trouble every day  
Hes growing up the hard way  
Yeah and hes gonna stay that way  
You see hes growing up the hard way  
Walk the straight and narrow yeah maybe someday  
But still hes growing up the hard way  
Its just the way hes grown up  
Yeah growing up the hard way  
There aint no other way  
Growing up the hard way
