Shes got to run shes got to hide  
Shes got her head stuck in a sand dune  
She never thinks she never tries  
She doesnt see that shes gonna pull through  
  
She used to laugh she used to cry  
She used to play hot as the others  
She used to fool she used to fight  
She loved a windup on a Saturday night  
  
Dont you break down dead in the water  
Dont you leave town now though you want to  
Dont you break down dead in the water  
Dead in the water  
  
He is the one he has the smile  
Keeping his cool across the dance floor  
He moves around he moves away  
They move together the rest of the night  
  
He hits the spot she fits the bill  
He tries it on maybe she wants to  
He books a room a takeaway  
Is this the answer to all of their problems  
  
Dont you break down dead in the water  
Dont you leave town now though you want to  
Dont you break down down in the water  
  
The longest day must end but thats another time  
Perhaps another life we may be here again  
The longest day must end we take it as we find  
But if we never try we may be here again  
  
The longest day must end we take it as we find  
But if we never try we may be here again  
  
Shes waking up shes in a dream  
The world is gone left her to wonder  
Did it begin When will it end  
She cant believe that it didnt come true  
  
She needs to laugh she needs to cry  
She needs to play hot as the others  
She used to fool she used to fight  
She loved a windup on a Saturday night  
  
Dont you break down dead in the water  
Dont you leave town now though you want to  
Dont you break down  
Dead in the water  
Dead in the water
