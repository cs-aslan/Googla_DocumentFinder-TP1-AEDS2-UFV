Like the folks you meet on  
Like to plant my feet on the Brooklyn Bridge  
What a lovely view from  
Heaven looks at you from the Brooklyn Bridge  
  
I love to listen to the wind through her strings  
The song that she sings for the town  
I love to look up at the clouds in her hair  
Shes learned to wear like a crown  
  
If youve been a rover  
Journeys end lies over the Brooklyn Bridge  
Dont let no one tell you  
Ive been tryin to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge  
  
All the folks in Manhattan are sad  
Cause they look at her and wish they had  
The good old Brooklyn Bridge  
  
If youve been a rover  
Journeys end lies over the Brooklyn Bridge  
Dont let no one tell you  
Ive been tryin to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge  
  
Youll miss her most when you roam  
Cause youll think of her and think of home  
The good old Brooklyn Bridge
