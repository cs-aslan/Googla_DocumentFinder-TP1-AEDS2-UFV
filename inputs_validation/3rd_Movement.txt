Hey everybody  
Wont you just look around  
Cant anybody see  
Just whats going down  
Cant you take the time  
Just to feel just to feel what is real  
If you do then youll see that we got a raw deal  
Theyre killin everybody theyre killin me and you  
The fightin and killin everybody I wish it werent true  
They say we got to make war  
Or the economy will fall  
But if we dont stop  
We wont be around no more  
Theyre ruining this world  
For you and me  
The big heads of state  
Wont let us be free  
They made the rules once  
But it didnt turn out  
Now we must try again  
Before they kill us off  
No more dying  
No more killing  
No more dying  
No more fighting  
We dont want to die  
We dont want to die  
Please lets change it all  
Please lets make it all  
Good for the present  
And better for the future  
Love one another  
Lets show peace for each other  
We can make it happen  
Lets just make it happen  
We can change the world  
Please lets change this world  
Please lets make it happen  
For our children for our women  
Change the world  
Please make it happen  
Come on come on  
Yeah please come on  
Its up to me its up to you  
Come on lets do it now  
Yeah do it now
