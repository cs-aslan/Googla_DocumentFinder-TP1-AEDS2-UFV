The distant echo  
Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains  
To take them home to  
The ones that they love and who love them forever  
The glazed dirty steps repeat my own and reflect my thoughts  
Cold and uninviting partially naked  
Except for toffee wrappers and this mornings paper  
Mr Jones got run down  
Headlines of death and sorrow they tell of tomorrow  
Madmen on the rampage  
And Im down in the tube station at midnight  
I fumble for change and pull out the Queen  
Smiling beguiling  
I put in the money and pull out a plum  
Behind me  
Whispers in the shadows gruff blazing voices  
Hating waiting  
hey boy they shout have you got any money  
And I said Ive a little money and a take away curry  
Im on my way home to my wife  
Shell be lining up the cutlery  
You know shes expecting me  
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork  
And Im down in the tube station at midnight  
  
I first felt a fist and then a kick  
I could now smell their breath  
They smelt of pubs and wormwood scrubs  
And too many right wing meetings  
My life swam around me  
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence  
The smell of brown leather  
It blended in with the weather  
It filled my eyes ears nose and mouth  
It blocked all my senses  
Couldnt see hear speak any longer  
And Im down in the tube station at midnight  
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight  
  
The last thing that I saw  
As I lay there on the floor  
Was Jesus saves painted by an atheist nutter  
And a British rail poster read have an away day a cheap holiday  
Do it today  
I glanced back on my life  
And thought about my wife  
Cause they took the keys and shell think its me  
And Im down in the tube station at midnight  
The wine will be flat and the currys gone cold  
Im down in the tube station at midnight  
Dont want to go down in a tube station at midnight
