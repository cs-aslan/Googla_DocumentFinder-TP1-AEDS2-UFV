And so it is  
Just like you said it would be  
Life goes easy on me  
Most of the time  
And so it is  
The shorter story  
No love no glory  
No hero in her sky  
  
I cant take my eyes off of you  
I cant take my eyes off you  
I cant take my eyes off of you  
I cant take my eyes off you  
I cant take my eyes off you  
I cant take my eyes  
  
And so it is  
Just like you said it should be  
Well both forget the breeze  
Most of the time  
And so it is  
The colder water  
The blowers daughter  
The pupil in denial  
  
I cant take my eyes off of you  
I cant take my eyes off you  
I cant take my eyes off of you  
I cant take my eyes off you  
I cant take my eyes off you  
I cant take my eyes  
  
Did I say that I loathe you  
Did I say that I want to  
Leave it all behind  
  
I cant take my mind off of you  
I cant take my mind off you  
I cant take my mind off of you  
I cant take my mind off you  
I cant take my mind off you  
I cant take my mind  
My mind My mind
