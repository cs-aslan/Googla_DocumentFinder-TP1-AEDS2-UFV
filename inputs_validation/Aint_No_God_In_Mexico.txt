Down the road a ways I have heard say a new days comin on  
Where the woman folks are friendly and the law leaves you alone  
Well Ill believe it when I see it but I havent seen it yet  
Dont mind me just keep on talkin I am just looking for my hat  
  
Aint no God in Mexico  
Aint no way to understand  
How that border crossing feeling makes a fool out of a man  
If I had not seen the sunshine Hell I would not cuss your rain  
My feet would fit a railroad track  
I would made one Hell of a train  
  
Me and Louise Higginbotham use to race across the yard  
Back in 1947 thats when more than times were hard  
Well pity me I didnt see the line in time and like a fool  
In front of God and everybody I politely blew my cool  
  
Aint no God in Mexico aint no comfort in the can  
When your down in Matamoras gettin busted by the man  
If I had not seen the sunshine I would not cuss your rain  
If my feet would fit a railroad track I guess I would have been a train
