Why must we be put down when we try to get away  
Why must we all grow up when we could just play and play  
Good things in life are free  cant buy everything thats true  
Only one thing wrong with that  what it dont buy I dont use  
  
Only thing Im thinking of is Why are we all here  
There must be more to do at nights than drinking rotten beer  
The worlds a very shady place and you cant trust a soul  
Grin and bear it seemed the thing when it just gets a hold  
At a later date it might come out a fright  
At a later date I hope that youre alright  
  
Human beings are dangerous and they call me in the dark  
But everything gets twice as cold in marching for a lark  
Theres loads of things Id like to do if I could find the time  
Working really tires me and I think Ill turn to crime  
At a later date I hope they start it soon  
At a later date before we hit the moon  
  
I just cant be bothered to make an effort here at all  
People make you feel your contributions are too small  
I just cant be bothered to make an effort here at all  
People make you feel your contributions are too small  
At a later date Ill be awful great  
At a later date someone somewhere blew it  
At a later date at a later date
