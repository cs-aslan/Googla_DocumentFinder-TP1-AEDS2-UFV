I see fields of golden flowers  
Shine in the evening Sun  
Above are misty mountains  
Its so beautiful  
As the wind caresses my eyes  
Gazing gently at the sky  
The Moon inside a halo  
Its so beautiful  
  
When I think of all the beauty  
That nature gives to me  
From the flowers to the mountains  
Its so beautiful  
Theres glory and a wonder  
Far wider than the sea  
I say yes to all this loveliness  
Its so beautiful  
  
Humming
