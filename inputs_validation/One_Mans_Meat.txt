Cold beer and a strange cigarette  
Getting you high getting you wet  
Falling in love falling out of debt  
Straight gay black or white  
Strutting in the dark hiding in the light  
Doing it wrong doing it right just doing it  
You got your life on the one hand  
Mine in the other  
I got the right we all got the right  
  
One mans meat is the other mans lousy luck  
One mans meat is someones empty well  
One mans meat is some guys aching butt  
One mans meat is another mans living hell  
  
Short fat thick or thin  
Take it in the gut take it on the chin  
Living in glory living in sin  
Hard days work going down slow  
Riding the road where the green grass grows  
Watching in die what dyou know  
Watch it  
You got your life on the one hand  
Mine in the other  
I got the right  
  
One mans meat is the other mans lousy luck  
One mans meat is someones empty well  
One mans meat is some guys aching butt  
One mans meat is another mans living hell
