A boy is born in hard time Mississippi  
Surrounded by four walls that aint so pretty  
His parents give him love and affection  
To keep him strong moving in the right direction  
Living just enough just enough for the city  
  
His father works some days for fourteen hours  
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar  
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many  
And youd best believe she hardly gets a penny  
Living just enough just enough for the city yeah  
  
His sisters black but she is sho nuff pretty  
Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy  
To walk to school shes got to get up early  
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty  
Living just enough just enough for the city  
  
Her brothers smart hes got more sense than many  
His patiences long but soon he wont have any  
To find a job is like a haystack needle  
Cause where he lives they dont use colored people  
Living just enough just enough for the city  
  
Living just enough for the city  
  
His hair is long his feet are hard and gritty  
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City  
Hes almost dead from breathing in air pollution  
He tried to vote but to him theres no solution  
  
Living just enough just enough for the city yeah yeah yeah  
  
I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow  
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow  
This place is cruel no where could be much colder  
If we dont change the world will soon be over  
  
Living just enough just enough for the city
