Shes seventeen  
And gets to thinking  
About Prom Queen and partying  
  
Cant get her head on straight  
But has to try before its too late  
But I dont think she has a chance  
  
I know you you know me  
But youre too proud to show me  
The way you really see the world  
  
Im here to help  
And Im sure it feels like hell  
Come take my hand well fly away to promised lands  
  
What are you running from  
Why cant you just see that this through  
When youre lost in life I will try  
Oh Ill try yeah Ill try  
To find you  
  
Please believe  
That we arent just here  
Sitting watch you do your thing  
  
You want to scream but  
Those chains they hold you down  
And I wont wait to get you off the ground  
  
Free to look forward to what is at hand  
If theres something to ask  
Its too short for a regret  
  
People make mistakes  
And Im here to lead the way  
To see you spread your wings  
  
What are you running from  
Why cant you just see this through  
When youre lost in life I will try  
Oh Ill try yeah Ill try  
To find you  
  
What are you running from  
Why cant you just see this through  
When youre lost in life I will try  
Oh Ill try yeah Ill try  
To find you  
  
What are you running from  
Why cant you just see this through  
When youre lost in life I will try  
Oh Ill try yeah Ill try  
To find you
