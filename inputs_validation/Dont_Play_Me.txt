Dont play me  
Im over thirty and I dont smoke weed  
I put my ass away and music Ive played  
Aint the type of stereo youre tryin to feed  
Dont play me  
Dont play me  
I use proper English and Im straight  
Im in the news again for paying dues my friend  
And not the type of ganda you prop in my way  
Dont play me  
  
Dont play me  
Ive been to the mountain top and it aint what you say  
Dont play me  
  
Dont play me  
Im the wrong color and I play guitar  
My only competition is well in the past  
Time and time if time existed movin ever so fast  
Dont play me  
  
You couldnt play enough of me now  
To make me feel like a star  
Dont play me I already do in my car  
Dont play me  
  
Dont be mad at me  
The curtain puller in the game  
Maybe how you call us niggers aint the same  
Its all good when you know the only fame  
Is the light that comes from God and the joy you get to say his name  
Dont play me  
  
Dont play me  
Ive seen to the mountain top and it aint what you say  
Dont play me  
  
Already got laid
