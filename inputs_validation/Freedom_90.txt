I wont let you down  
I will not give you up  
Gotta have some faith in the sound  
Its the one good thing that Ive got  
I wont let you down  
So please dont give me up  
Because I would really really love to stick around  
  
Heaven knows I was just a young boy  
Didnt know what I wanted to be  
I was every little hungry schoolgirls pride and joy  
And I guess it was enough for me  
To win the race A prettier face  
Brand new clothes and a big fat place  
On your rock and roll TV  
But today the way I play the game is not the sameNo way  
Think Im gonna get me some happy  
  
I think theres something you should know  
I think its time I told you so  
Theres something deep inside of me  
Theres someone else Ive got to be  
Take back your picture in a frame  
Take back your singing in the rain  
I just hope you understand  
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man  
  
All we have to do now  
Is take these lies and make them true somehow  
All we have to see  
Is that I dont belong to you  
And you dont belong to me  
Freedom  
Youve gotta give for what you take  
Freedom  
Youve gotta give for what you take  
  
Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy  
What a kick just a buddy and me  
We had every big shot goodtime band on the run boy  
We were living in a fantasy  
We won the race  
Got out of the place  
I went back home got a brand new face  
For the boys on MTV  
But today the way I play the game has got to change  
Oh yeah  
Now Im gonna get myself happy  
  
I think theres something you should know  
I think its time I stopped the show  
Theres something deep inside of me  
Theres someone I forgot to be  
Take back your picture in a frame  
Dont think that Ill be back again  
I just hope you understandSometimes the clothes do not make the man  
  
All we have to do now  
Is take these lies and make them true somehow  
All we have to see  
Is that I dont belong to you  
And you dont belong to me  
Freedom  
Youve gotta give for what you take  
Freedom  
Youve gotta give for what you take  
  
Well it looks like the road to heaven  
But it feels like the road to hell  
When I knew which side my bread was buttered  
I took the knife as well  
Posing for another picture  
Everybodys got to sell  
But when you shake your ass  
They notice fast  
And some mistakes were built to last  
  
Thats what you get  
  
I say thats what you get  
  
Thats what you get for changing your mind  
  
And after all this time  
I just hope you understand  
Sometimes the clothes  
Do not make the man  
  
Ill hold on to my freedom  
May not be what you want from me  
Just the way its got to be  
Lose the face nowIve got to live
