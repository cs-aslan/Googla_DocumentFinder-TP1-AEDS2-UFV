Somebody somewhere told me  
You were gonna break my heart  
Somebody somewhere told me  
You were gonna break me apart  
I didnt listen and I didnt care  
I didnt think that talk was anywhere  
I didnt listen and I didnt care  
Nobody told me bout your low down friends  
Somebody somewhere help me  
I got to find a brand new way  
Somebody somewhere help me  
I got to make a brand new way  
I didnt listen and I didnt know  
I didnt think it would hurt me so  
I didnt listen and I didnt know  
Nobody told me bout your low down friends  
Somebody somewhere help me  
I got to turn it turn it round  
Somebody somewhere help me  
I got to get my feet on the ground  
I didnt listen and I didnt care  
I didnt think that talk was anywhere  
I didnt listen and I didnt know  
I didnt think it would hurt me so
