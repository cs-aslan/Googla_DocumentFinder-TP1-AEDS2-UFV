So you cry  
Whats it about baby  
You ask why  
Blues had to go and pick you  
So you go  
Down to the shore kids stuff  
Dont you know  
Theres honey in the store for you big stuff  
Lets take a ride on my gravy train  
The door open wide  
  
So you stare  
Call it despair baby  
Dont you care  
Im on the square about you  
Lets have a try  
It maybe that youre my guy  
Lets take a ride on my gravy train  
The door open wide  
Come in from out of the rain
