Theres an old love refrain that has known the world over  
Its sweetness both princes and peasants may calim  
Like a bird on the wing or a bee in the clover  
No matter the language the song is the same  
  
Go to sleep my baby go to sleep  
While the stars above begin to peep  
Theyre lighting the windows of heaven angels watch over you  
From the windows of heaven mothers watching you too  
  
Sleep my baby sleep  
From the windows of heaven mothers watching you too  
  
Sleep my baby sleep
