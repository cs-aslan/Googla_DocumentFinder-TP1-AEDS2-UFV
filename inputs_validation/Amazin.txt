Cmon and you dont stop here go another one  
Uh uh and you dont stop here go another one  
Uh uh and you dont stop here go another one  
Feel me baby its on  
  
Uh I was launched off the block straight to the top  
To yachts with helicopters Im so hot  
Paparazzi blinded by the rocks  
My limousine roll up the whole world shocked cause  
You steppin out with an entrepeneur  
I copped you more than what you bargained for  
Roll the red carpet enjoy the profits  
First lets make love in the walkin closet  
Daddy just made a nine digit deposit  
Believe me sweetie its not luck its logic  
Im the captain of my destiny  
Used to dream of the things I was blessed to see  
The jewels and the papers sports cars and such  
Theres nothing in the world LL cant touch  
You stood by my side and pushed me so much  
Thats why you got them 10 karats you know what  
  
Its so amazing amazing amazing  
Lifes given my baby my baby my baby  
Maybe some day youll feel how I feel its crazy  
To see my baby is so amazing  
  
Sing it baby  
  
Ive got riches wall to wall  
Up the stairs and down the hall of  
All the things that we have done  
You got more ideas for us to  
Live our lives and explore  
There is no topping you youre untoppable  
  
So what you sayin Uhhuh  
Hehehe I appreciate it  
  
Its so amazing your love to me  
Its so amazing amazing to me  
Its so amazing your love to me  
Its so amazing amazing to me  
  
Its alright  
Sometimes you work late at night I know baby  
I miss you too  
Just as long as you dont defy my love  
Then its on I promise you baby  
Ill always love you  
  
Uh uh slide out to Venice my games in order  
Would chip in to vent but the citys on water  
Searchlights and fireworks bling the sky  
A vowel on the end of everything we buy  
Yellow ice in both ears I loosen up the tie  
Im lovin this life style baby I cant lie  
It feels so good it make a grown man cry  
Cause I made it out the hood and a lot of my crew died  
I guess I had determination  
And baby girl kept me in the congregation  
Now its private jets and deep conversation  
Hundred Gs a month to show appreciation  
All eyes on us the cameras flash  
In God We Trust I dont love this cash  
But you was definitely by my side when my world collapsed  
Now Im rich for life and Im payin you back  
  
This is like this for life baby  
This gon always be like this  
God is my witness  
Hold you tight for the rest of my life  
Yknahmsayin  
Theres nothing I wont do for you baby  
Im your man Im your man  
Our love is amazing yeah  
  
Its so amazing to me
