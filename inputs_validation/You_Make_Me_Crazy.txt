I waited all night  
I smoked a hundred cigarettes  
I chewed my lip til it bled  
But the phone made not a sound  
Sometimes I wonder  
If you ever wonder whats become of little old me  
But I aint no baby  
I aint gonna cry but baby  
You dont know whats going on inside me  
Why know you make me crazy  
What you do to me  
Its a chemical reaction or an allergy  
Why know you make me crazy  
Youre aware of that  
Why dont you come and put me away  
It was a long night  
I could barely keep my head  
I heard a knock on the door  
It was only Harry Jones  
I used to wonder  
What it is that makes me feel like I cant be free  
Cause you dont give me nothing  
You never give me nothing  
But you dont know whats going on inside me  
Why know you make me crazy  
Im in misery  
Are you interested enough to see whats left of me  
You scared me  
The way you move in the night  
Your face is something frightening  
Youre not so nice  
Im gonna wonder  
Who you spend your time with  
Everywhere you go and what you see  
I know Im not your daddy  
I dont want to be your daddy  
But you know whats going on inside me
