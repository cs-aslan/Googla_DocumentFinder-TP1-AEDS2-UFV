Its been a long time coming since Ive seen your face  
Ive been everywhere and back trying to replace everything that Ive had  
Till my feet went numb  
Praying like a fool thats been on the run  
Heart still beating but its not working  
Its like a million dollar phone that you just cant ring  
I reach out trying to love but I feel nothing  
Yeah my heart is numb  
  
But with you  
I feel again  
Yeah with you  
I can feel again  
  
Yeah  
  
Woohoo x4  
  
Im feeling better since you know me  
I was a lonely soul but thats the old me  
  
Its been a long time coming since Ive seen your face  
Ive been everywhere and back trying to replace everything that I broke  
Till my feet went numb  
Praying like a fool who just shot a gun  
Heart still beating but its not working  
Its like a hundred thousand voices that just cant sing  
I reached out trying to love but I feel nothing  
Oh my heart is numb  
  
But with you  
I feel again  
And with you  
I can feel again  
  
But with you  
Im feeling better since you know me  
I feel again  
I was a lonely soul but thats the old me  
Yeah with you  
Im feeling better since you know me  
I can feel again  
I was a lonely soul  
  
Woohooo  
  
Woohooo x4  
  
Im feeling better since you know me  
I was a lonely soul but thats the old me  
Im feeling better since you know me  
I was a lonely soul but thats the old me  
Im feeling better since you know me  
I was a lonely soul but thats the old me  
  
Im feeling better ever since you know me  
I was a lonely soul but thats the old me  
A little wiser now from what you showed me  
Yeah I feel again  
Feel again
