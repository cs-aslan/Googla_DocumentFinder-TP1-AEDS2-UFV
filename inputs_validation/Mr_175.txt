New shoes on the range rover good one man vroom  
Motherfuckers acting like I aint supposed to shine  
I aint the one definitely not the two nope  
One in the chamber when we aiming at you  
The young Bob Barker the price is right  
If you COD then you could get them tonight  
Put the fish scale on the scale  
If Roy went postal all he do is check mail ha ha  
Low key under the radar  
Triple black Vet yeah I call it the stealth  
No currency machine I could count it myself  
Almost done another quarter million in ones  
Thunder storm in the bodytap look what Ive done  
Chump change I make it rain for fun whats up

I reminisce like Mary J  
Even in the drought the boy kept that yay  
100 percent served Snowmans word  
You can play my thug and my clientele why  
Im addicted to that new car smell  
White cookies in a plastic bag  
New shoes on the coupe with the paper tag  
Whole life flash right before your eyes  
See the state troopers and get butterflies  
Got a thing for them Heckler and Koches  
A minute 14 and Rolex watches  
Somewhere in the back of my secret deranged brain  
I get a rush when I tote that cane  
Get money Nigga fuck them haters  
All we fear is the discovery and inditement papers whats up

Snow man get cha hands up high

Right to your front door operation so sweet  
I like little dude who keeps his money so neat  
But I still bury a nigga  
Put The Mask on Jim Carey a nigga Blaou  
Swede ends in the Chevy got me feelin awkward  
Careful with the sweets dont burn my seats  
You could live your whole life and not come close  
Guess thats why these rap niggas take notes  
Recite my adlibs borrow my quotes  
Make me I hop a nigga serve them with the toast  
Next they be dressing like me  
But back in 93 they wasnt stressing like me whats up  
  
Snow man get cha hands up high

I take it back to the block back to the kitchen back to the pots  
Snow man get cha hands up high
