People say that its impossible to fly  
But you dont know what Im thinking  
Dont want to be just like the other hundred guys  
Yeah you dont know what Im thinking  
  
Cant change the world  
Cant change the whole world  
You say its crumbling all around you  
And youre trying to get out  
  
People say that out of sight is out of mind  
But you dont know what Im thinking  
Dont want to listen to the ignorance and lies  
Yeah you dont know what Im thinking  
  
And isnt it ironic sometimes  
The things we take for granted are what we wanted  
Before we knew why  
And isnt it the reason we try  
To make the excuse that it wont go the right way  
Before its gone wrong
