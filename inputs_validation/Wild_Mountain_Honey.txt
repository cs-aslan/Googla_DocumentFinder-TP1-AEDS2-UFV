I dont want to put another thought  
In my head  
  
The hummingbird is cleared for  
Maintenance  
Evacuating long after it made no sense  
Its not so much a load and stay any more  
As a gottagetdowntheroadbeforethe  
Temperaturesoars  
  
I dont want to put a little thought  
In your head  
  
Diplomacy goes even better with drinks  
Until the big city trees began to shrink  
Its not so much a load out and stay  
Anymore  
Its gotta get down the road before the  
Snarling traffic roars  
  
I dont want to ask you  
What you got in your head  
Im not gonna ask you  
A whole bunch of questions  
  
OK we agree to disagree  
Giving upGiving Up the Embassy  
Is a whole lot better than  
The Embassys Surrendering  
  
Flying home under the approval of the stars  
I couldnt be more at home with the way  
Things are so hard  
Its not so much a loadout  
And stay anymore  
Its a gotta get down the road before  
The confetti cannon blows  
With litigious force  
  
I dont want to ask you  
What you got in your head  
I dont want to ask you  
Whatcha been thinking  
  
I dont want to put another  
Thought in my head  
  
I dont want to put another  
Thought in my head
