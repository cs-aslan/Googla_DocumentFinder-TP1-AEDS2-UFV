Hi out there This is Shaun Goldberg and youre listening to WANK  
This evening Ive got someone really interesting with me  
Hes over from old England and his name is Robbie Williams  
  
Cor blimey bleedin Mary Poppins  
  
Great right on You know weve been hearing about this boy band that was
really big over there  
Can you tell us a little bit about it Robbie  
  
First of all Id like to say thank you very much for having me in the first
place  
but to answer your question I cant really answer it  
I suppose it was a bit like this  
  
Ha  
Riding in your limos  
Hanging with your bimbos  
Riding my old faithful  
Bigger pinup than Betty Grable  
Kipper in the papers  
Coke and whisky chasers  
I aint supposed to pose  
But I dont care  
  
I was a teenage millionaire

Services for Britain  
Pouting like a kitten  
Dinner with Diana  
Im a social Stokey spanner  
Waiting for my knighthood  
She can pin it on my manhood  
I aint supposed to pose  
But I dont care  
  
I was a teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
Yeah yeah  
A teenage millionaire  
  
It works out sometimes its funny  
Being stupid makes you lots of money  
  
Bothered Judy Garland  
When I ordered Barbara Cartland  
Champagne in my bidet  
The press all had a field day  
You may think its an outrage  
My cleaner is wearing bondage  
She makes my place a mess  
But I dont care  
  
I was a teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire
