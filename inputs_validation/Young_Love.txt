She was sitting crossed legged on a hood of a ford  
Filing down her nails with a emory board  
Talking to her friends about people they knew  
And all of the things that young girls do  
When she said you see that guy in the baseball cap  
Id like to spend some time with a boy like that  
Betty said I seen him at the hardware store  
I think his name is Billy but Im not sure  
And as they talked a little while he passed by  
She smiled at him he just said hi  
He was thinking to him self as he walked away  
Man Id like to find a girl like her someday  
  
Chorus  
Young love strong love true love  
Its a new love  
Their gonna make it through the hard times  
Walk those lines  
Young love  
Well she just couldnt stop her self from thinking about him  
And at a store downtown she saw him again  
She had both hands full  
He held open the door  
Said my name is Billy  
Ive seen you before  
Can I help you with these  
Can I give you a ride  
Can I take you out on a Saturday night  
She didnt have to say what she was feeling inside  
He could see the answer shining in her eyes  
  
Chorus  
Well from that day on  
You couldnt keep them apart  
They were side by side heart to heart  
Momma cried as Billy slipped the ring on her hand  
And when the baby was born she was crying again  
Well he worked real hard and put some money down  
On a little old house at the edge of town  
And that night as he held her he couldnt believe  
That god had made a girl that hed never ever leave  
  
Chorus  
She was sitting crossed legged on the hood of a ford  
Filing down her nails with an emory board
