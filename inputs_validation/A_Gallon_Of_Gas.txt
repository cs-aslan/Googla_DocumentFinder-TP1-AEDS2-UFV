Ive been waiting for years to buy a brand new Cadillac  
But now Ive got one I want to send it right back  
I cant afford the gas to fill my luxury limousine  
But even if I had the dough no ones got no gasoline  
  
I went to my local dealer to see if he could set me straight  
He said theres a little gas going but Id have to wait  
But he offered some red hot speed and some really high grade hash  
But a gallon of gas cant be purchased anywhere  
For any amount of cash  
  
I can score you some coke and some grade one grass  
But I cant get a gallon of gas  
Ive got some downers some speed all the drugs that you need  
But I cant get a gallon of gas  
Theres no more left to buy or sell  
Theres no more oil left in the well  
A gallon of gas cant be purchased anywhere  
For any amount of cash  
  
Who needs a car and a seven forty seven  
When you cant buy a gallon of gas  
Who needs a highway an airport or a jet  
When you cant get a gallon of gas  
Theres no more left to buy or sell  
Theres no more oil left in the well  
A gallon of gas cant be purchased anywhere  
For any amount of cash  
You cant buy a gallon of gas
