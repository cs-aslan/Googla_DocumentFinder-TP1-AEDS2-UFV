The cicatrix beneath  
Max Factor 101 to 009  
I dont get my hgopes up  
On Ponds rosy pride  
I dont get my teeth  
Stuck midway to brave  
A closeup smile  
  
Chorus  
The arrow goes off  
Oh it hits your behind  
You fall blindly  
You gotta pay the price  
You gotta check some  
Fine print they tell you  
You cant do without  
Till the next product line  
Come  
Theyll have you in mind  
  
When a funny line escapes  
From a callow pretense of an ad  
An inflicted sense of the word  
Kicks in  
Oh so pretty  
Not pimplefriendly  
Pass the word around  
Then youre 70 not 117  
Its your raisin face they mock  
Rely on pension for a last  
Lipo stunt  
Get a face life a lip contour  
  
Techno takes its toll on you  
Pass the word around  
  
Outro  
The arrow goes off  
You borrow this  
It hits your behind  
You fall behind  
You fall blindly  
You pay blindly  
You gotta pay the price  
Buy it thrice  
You gotta check some fine prints  
Find your way out  
They tell you you cant do without  
Find your way out now  
Till the next product line comes  
Find your way you gotta fiund your way  
Theyll have you in mind
