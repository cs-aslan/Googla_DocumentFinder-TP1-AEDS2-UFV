This is a crisis I knew had to come  
Destroying the balance Id kept  
Doubting unsettling and turning around  
Wondering what will come next  
Is this the role that you wanted to live  
I was foolish to ask for so much  
Without the protection and infancys guard  
It all falls apart at first touch  
  
Watching the reel as it comes to a close  
Brutally taking its time  
People who change for no reason at all  
Its happening all of the time  
Can I go on with this train of events  
Disturbing and purging my mind  
Back out of my duties when alls said and done  
I know that Ill lose every time  
  
Moving along in our God given ways  
Safety is sat by the fire  
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles  
Left with a mark on the door  
Is this the gift that I wanted to give  
Forgive and forgets what they teach  
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more  
And watch as they drop by the beach  
  
This is the crisis I knew had to come  
Destroying the balance Id kept  
Turning around to the next set of lives  
Wondering what will come next
