Emily Chambers would make it pay  
Everyone knew shed turn out that way  
She turned her back and shell be okay  
But shes not okay at all  
  
Every night with the radio on  
Emily fears that the day wont come  
The moon is there to do her harm  
Shes not all right at all  
  
Dont get arrested  
Dont buy a machine gun  
Youre not on the run  
And youre not on the scene  
Youre not so cool  
And youre not a jerk  
You may be a villain  
But no Patty Hearst  
Youre Emily Chambers  
And whats worse  
Is a whipping wind  
And a box in a hearse  
And a trigger in your head  
And a pen in your hand  
And the pain in the verse  
And the flat drying land  
And the thin of the air  
And a pain that hurts  
Youre Emily Chambers in the universe  
  
Emily Chambers would make it pay  
Everyone knew shed turn out that way  
She turned her back and shell be okay  
But shes not okay at all  
  
Every night with the lamplight on  
Emily fears that the day has gone  
The moon is there to do her harm  
Shes not all right at all  
  
Dont get arrested  
Dont buy a machine gun  
Youre not on the run  
And youre not on the scene  
Youre not so cool  
And youre not a jerk  
You may be a villain  
But no Patty Hearst  
Youre Emily Chambers  
And whats worse  
Is a whipping wind  
And a box in a hearse  
And a trigger in your head  
And a pen in your hand  
And the pain in the verse  
And the flat drying land  
And the thin of the air  
And a pain that hurts  
Youre Emily Chambers in the universe  
  
Emily Chambers would make it pay  
Everyone knew shed turn out that way  
  
Emily Chambers would make it pay  
Everyone knew shed turn out that way
