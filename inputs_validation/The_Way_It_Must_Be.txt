Baby how could I have been so vain  
To make you think that youre the only one to blame  
For all these distances and all of this pain  
Baby how could I have been so blind  
To presuppose that your needs were just like mine  
Youve been a prisoner for a long long time  
But now you run from me  
And I will set you freeIf thats the way it must be  
I tried so hard to make you part of me  
That every time I looked at youI thought Id see  
Someone that you could never ever be  
So full of pride that I could not see straight  
I thought youd changeIf I could only wait  
I see the truth now but its much too late  
Cause now you run from me  
And I will set you freeIf thats the way it must be  
Ohohbaby howd it ever get so cold and mean  
Ohoh  
Is there nothing left but silence in between  
Ohohbaby howd it ever get so cold and mean  
Ohoh  
Is there nothing left but silence in between  
Baby howd we hold on so long  
To something both of us must have known was wrong  
Were either fools or must be terrible strong  
Cause now you run from me  
And I will set you freeIf thats the way it must be  
Ohohbaby howd it ever get so cold and mean  
Ohoh  
Is there nothing left but silence in between
