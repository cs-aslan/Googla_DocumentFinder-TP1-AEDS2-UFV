Tonight Im blue for old Hawaii my weary sould is lonesome too  
She left me blue and broken hearted Ive got them old Hawaii blues  
Your big blue eyes and darkbrown curls dear made skies of grey turn into blue  
But now youve gone and lost forever Ive got them old Hawaii blues  
You left me down where drowsy waters roll on the shores of paradise  
Youve had your way dear and we have parted for you old pal I dream tonight  
Perhaps some day your mind will wander back to the one who loves you true  
And I will still for you be waiting Ive got them old Hawaii blues
