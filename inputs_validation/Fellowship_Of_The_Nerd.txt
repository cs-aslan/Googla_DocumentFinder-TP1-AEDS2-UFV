This might just be a waste of time  
But theres no one Id rather  
Waste my time with than all my best friends  
To stop this horror  
  
Well all take turns not for the worst  
Were all hasbeens and neverweres  
Were all in the back singing Roxanne  
Just watching life pass us by Pass us by  
  
As if we had enough to try to kiss her  
Enough to make up for lost time  
Enough to make up for lost time  
  
Weve been down weve been out weve been hanging round  
Take your passes to no direction yeah  
Stop moving get me out of this one horse town  
Waste this night  
  
Whoo  
Weve been down weve been out weve been hanging round  
Take your passess to no direction yeah  
Stop moving get me out of this one horse town  
Waste this night waste this night
