I dont know what Im doing here I could be someplace else  
Like in Atlanta drinkin wine wine wine  
I dont know what Im doing here I should be someplace else  
Like in Kentucky drinkin shine shine shine  
The dogs are running down in Memphis  
And them nags are running in LA  
Im stuck in Spokane in a motel room  
And there aint no way to get away  
Willie Nelsons picking out in Austin  
And Waylons hanging out in Mexico  
Im stuck in Spokane in a motel room  
And Kris is making movin picture shows  
Hey I dont know what Im doing here I could be someplace else  
Like in Atlanta drinkin wine wine wine  
I dont know what Im doing here I should be someplace else  
Like in Kentucky drinkin shine shine shine  
Well I know theyre dancing in New Orleans  
And old Chicagos bright as day  
Im stuck in Spokane in a motel room  
Lord I wish I had a Dolly Parton tape  
Well Hill and Bare and Billy Joe theyre gambling  
And ol TPs frying croppie all night long  
Theyre down at Tootsies eating chili  
Im stuck in Spokane awriting songs  
Hey I dont know what Im doing here I could be someplace else  
Like in Atlanta drinkin wine wine wine  
I dont know what Im doing here I should be someplace else  
Like in Kentucky drinkin clear moonshine
