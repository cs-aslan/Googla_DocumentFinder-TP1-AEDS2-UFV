So you think you know just what goes on inside your head my friend  
There is so much more than you and I can comprehend  
Things that make you laugh things that make you cry  
Let you love when you feel like you wanna die  
  
Theres no answer to the questions that we find inside my friend  
But when we start to wonder why we wind up further behind my friend  
All we see has always been shown  
But theres so many things that Ive never known  
  
So you think you know my friend  
But you dont know my friend my friend  
You think you know  
But you dont know  
  
All for one and one for all  
Its everything or nothing at all  
Listen my friend  
You dont know  
No my friend  
You dont know
