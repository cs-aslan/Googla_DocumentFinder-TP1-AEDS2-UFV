Inanimational items elude I and  
Inanemotionalmotion I swallow my  
Motive of quicker location is slammed  
My dim chance of skipping this thick world is thin  
They call me Dim  
I am the Dim Locator  
Dim Locator  
Loco lomo loco lomo lwow wow wow  
same as above  
Intrigueinometry treads on my trail  
Entriggering traps for a gross gang of ghost types  
Who later are packed in a cast iron trunk  
These things have been known to get out of their wraps  
Dont call me Dim  
I am the Dim locator  
Dim Locator  
Loco lomo  
Fog fished and filtered is filling my case book of  
Friends who fall foul of my files trip and breakneck  
Are stacked in the woodshed for further good use  
Theres some certain people who shouldnt start fires  
So call me Dim  
I am the Dim Locator  
Dim Locator  
Dont call me Dim
