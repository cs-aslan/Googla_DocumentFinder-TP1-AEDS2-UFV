You remind me cant you see  
Of a girl just memories  
A flickering of your eyes tonight  
I see her in the light  
  
Something happened on the way  
To heaven but I just cant say  
Oh why she had to go away  
Baby come what may  
  
Youre not Lisa oh I know  
Shes in heaven had to go  
Youre not Lisa thats no lie  
I will see her in paradise  
  
If theres a god somewhere  
Oh do you think its really fair oh she was only 23  
Give her back to me  
How could I forget the time  
  
We were together she was mine  
Oh anytime and anywhere  
I wish she could be there
