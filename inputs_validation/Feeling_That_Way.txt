Opened my eyes to a new kind of way  
All the good times that you saved  
Are you feeling  
You feeling that way too  
Or am I just  
Am I just a fool  
  
When the summers gone  
Shell be there standing by the light  
Once shes bee to where shes gone to  
She should know wrong from right  
  
A new roads waiting you touched my life  
Soft and warm on a summers night  
Youre the only one the only one I love  
The lovely one Im thinking of
