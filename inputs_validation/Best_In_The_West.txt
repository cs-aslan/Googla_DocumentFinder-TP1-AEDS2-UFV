Best in the west thats your name  
Makin loves your claim to fame  
Better than the best oh everyone say  
Howd he learn to love that way  
Youre the best in the west  
Youre a tough sharp shooter  
And you aim to win  
And I wish youd love me now  
Like you did then  
Youre the best in the west  
Youre the best Ive ever had  
A naughty boy  
And the memory of you fills me with joy  
Lets do it again lets do it again  
Best in the west when you were five  
Kissed the girls and made them cry  
Better than the best oh you built your place  
Lovin is a symphony  
Youre the best in the west  
Youve been a ladies man with class  
Since way back when  
And you stand so high above all the men  
Youre the best in the west  
And your lovin seemed to fell me  
From the start  
And the fantasy of you is in my heart  
Lets do it again lets do it again  
Lets do it again Ooh lets do it baby  
Lets do it again  
The way you do it babys good to me yeah  
Well Im pretty damn good myself  
But I must confess  
When it comes to makin love  
Baby your the best in the west  
CHORUS  
Best in the west thats your name  
When you gonna love me again
