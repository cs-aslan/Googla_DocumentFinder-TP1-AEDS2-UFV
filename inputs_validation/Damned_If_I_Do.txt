I aint got a heart of stone  
Im hurtin more now than Ive ever known  
If you mean the things you said  
Im gonna wind up out a my head  
Cant sleep alone at night  
I just cant seem to get it right  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I dont but I love you  
  
I dont want to tie you down  
Dont need a reason to have you around  
But each time you walk away  
Dont be surprised if I ask you to stay  
Cant sleep alone at night  
I just cant seem to get it right  
Damned if I do  
And Im damned if I dont but I love you  
I said Im damned if I do  
And Im damned if I dont cause I love you  
  
I aint got a heart of stone  
You havent left me a mind of my own  
But its got such a hold on me  
I dont think I could ever be free  
How can I survive  
Im fighting to keep myself alive  
Im damned if I do  
Damned if I dont but I love you  
Cant seem to see the light  
Ive done everything but I cant get it right  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I dont but I love you
