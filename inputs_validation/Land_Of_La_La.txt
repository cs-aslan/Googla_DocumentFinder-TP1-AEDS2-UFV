You were brought up in a small town  
Where everyone greeted with a morning smile  
I mean the place was so free from crime  
You could leave your front door open  
And if your eyes were drawn from a lack of food  
Or your pockets were short on cash  
There was always someone close at hand  
That you could always run to  
  
You could have been a doctor  
And you could have been a nurse  
But these things werent good enough for you  
So you decided to pack up all you own  
And get a oneway ticket there  
To a place where all the successful people went  
In order for them to do  
  
Im a big boy now shes a strong girl  
Remember only the strong can survive  
Living in the land of la la  
Im a big boy now shes a strong girl  
Remember only the strong can survive  
Living in the land of la la  
LA LA la la la la LA hey hey land of la la  
LA LA la la la la LA hey hey the land of la la  
  
You get off the bus pick up a paper  
And look through the classified  
So that you might find a place  
Suitable for you to move into  
Then you turn around to pick up the duffel bag  
That you brought along  
But much to your surprise you find  
Your bag has taken off walking  
  
You dig in your wallet  
To get your last dime  
But then recall you just spent your last dime on the newspaper  
Youre much too prideful  
But pride has no defense  
When all youve got in your possession  
Is the wallet in your hands  
  
Im a big boy now shes a strong girl  
Remember only the strong can survive  
Living in the land of la la  
Im a big boy now shes a strong girl  
Remember only the strong can survive  
Living in the land of la la  
  
LA LA la la la la LA hey hey living in the land of la la  
  
You might get everything you want  
But not want everything you get  
Being in la la land is like nowhere else  
Living in the land one hell of a land a land full of lost angels  
Movie stars and great big cars and Perrier and fun all day  
And thats enough to make anybody go wild  
In the land of la la  
Hes a big boy now shes a strong girl  
But only the strong can survive  
Living in the land of la la
