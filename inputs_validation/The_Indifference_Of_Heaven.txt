Written by Warren Zevon 1993 Zevon Music BMI  
Time marches on  
Time stands still  
Time on my hands  
Time to kill  
Blood on my hands  
And my hands in the till  
Down at the 711  
Gentle rain  
Falls on me  
All life folds back  
Into the sea  
We contemplate eternity  
Beneath the vast indifference of heaven  
The past seems realer than the present to me now  
Ive got memories to last me  
When the sky is gray  
The way it is today  
I remember the times when I was happy  
Same old sun  
Same old moon  
Its the same old story  
Same old tune  
They all say  
Someday soon  
My sins will all be forgiven  
Gentle rain  
Falls on me  
All life folds back  
Into the sea  
We contemplate eternity  
Beneath the vast indifference of heaven  
They say Everythings all right  
They say Better days are near  
They tell us These are the good times  
But they dont live around here  
Billy and Christie dont  
Bruce and Patti dont  
They dont live around here  
I had a girl  
Now shes gone  
She left town  
Town burned down  
Nothing left  
But the sound  
Of the front door closing forever  
Gentle rain  
Falls on me  
All life folds back  
Into the sea  
We contemplate eternity  
Beneath the vast indifference of heaven
