I love you I love you theres no other way  
Just one way to say I love you  
I love you I love you and try as I may  
Thats all I can say  I love you  
  
Much more could be said if I thought with my head  
But I only can think with my heart  
I love you I love you and yearn for the day  
The day when youll say I love you  
  
Theres no other way  
Just one way to say I love you  
  
And try as I may  
Thats all I can say  I love you  
  
Much more could be said if I thought with my head  
But I only can think with my heart  
I love you I love you and yearn for the day  
The day when youll say I love you
