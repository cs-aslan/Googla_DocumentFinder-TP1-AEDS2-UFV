Well I just stopped in this evening  
To get myself a little taste  
The music is nice and swinging  
And of course I really dig the place  
Course I havent  
Had much sleep lately  
I feel sorta down and out  
Yeah but look over there  
In the corner man  
Oh yeah theres something  
To shout about  
Hey hey pretty baby  
Girl dont you go nowhere  
Are you talking to me  
Im talking to you pretty baby  
Girl dont you go nowhere  
Cause as soon as I pay the bartender  
Girl Ill be right there  
She looked up and blushed and smiled  
And my heart skipped a beat  
Mmm shes stacked from  
Her head down to her feet  
Hey barkeep  
You better come here and get your bread  
This little girls getting ready to split  
And Im about to go out of my head  
Hey hey pretty baby  
Girl dont you go out that door  
Are you talking to me  
Im talking to you pretty baby  
Girl dont you go out that door  
Im afraid if I lose sight of you  
I just might not see you no more  
She slowed up just a little bit  
And turned her head and smiled  
She was 342438  
And dressed in the latest style  
I finally caught up  
With the pretty little thing  
Before she got out on the street  
And she told she was  
Waiting on her old man  
Who was a policeman on the beat  
Hey hey pretty baby  
Girl Ill see you another time  
Are you talking to me  
Im talking to you pretty baby  
Girl Ill see you another time  
If youre a policemans woman

Just talking to you is a crime  
Thats right bud lets go  
Oh no
