If I had the moment  
Id capture that moment  
You would be right here next to me  
If I had the secret  
The secret to your love  
I would pledge a treasure beneath my heart  
Lock it all up  
And throw away the key  
I would never give it up  
Cause I was just a fool  
A fool for you  
When I loved you so childishly  
  
And I want it all back  
I want it all I want it all girl I want it all back  
I want it all back  
I want it all I want it all girl I want it all  
You never miss a good thing till its gone  
I want it all now I want it all back  
  
If there is a green light  
And it starts to turn yellow  
Pedal to the floor  
Cause I know your heart is turning red  
If I had the minutes I would turn em into hours  
And make love to your mind and not your body instead  
I was just a fool a fool for you  
That didnt know what I had until I lost you  
And every single moment that youre not here  
You said the evident to me that everything just seems so clear  
  
And I want it all back  
I gotta have it all  
I want it all I want it all girl I want it all back  
I want it all back  
I want it all I want it all girl I want it all  
You never miss a good thing til its gone  
I want it all now I want it all back  
  
Now everything isnt everything  
If everything everything isnt with you  
  
And I want it all back  
I want it all I want it all girl I want it all back  
I want it all back  
I want it all I want it all girl I want it all  
  
You never miss a good thing til its gone  
Want it all now I want it all back  
Now I want it all back now I want it all back  
Now I want it all back
