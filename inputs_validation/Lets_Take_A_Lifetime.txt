Say no more  
If you want to kiss goodnight  
Thats alright by me  
Close your door  
Make sure the latch is tight  
Fall gently to sleep  
  
We dont have to rush ahead  
Putting questions in your head  
And an ache in your heart  
  
Lets take a lifetime  
All that we desire  
Build it day by day into forever  
Lets take a lifetime  
All that you require  
Here and now and ever  
  
In these times  
Love is not some harmless game  
Its played strictly for keeps  
No Its no crime  
Wanting me to feel the same  
With the water so deep  
Come tomorrow once again  
Well be together until then  
Weve dreaming to do  
  
Lets take a lifetime  
All that you desire  
Build it day by day into forever  
Lets take a lifetime  
All that you require  
Here and now and lasting ever more  
  
So hard to leave you standing there in the light  
You look so lovely  
If we must  
No use tempting fate
