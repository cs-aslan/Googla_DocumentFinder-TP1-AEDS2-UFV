Just to think I had her in my hands  
To think we made our plans  
Somehow it feels just like a dream  
  
For I played it so darn cool  
Is there a bigger fool  
To say I wanted to be free  
Cause now I know just what she meant to me  
  
Chorus  
Jody even the wind says your name girl  
When I think of you Im aflame girl every time  
Jody girl Ive tried but I cant forget  
The years when we lived together  
I thought it would be forever  
Jody Im begging now  
  
Look around but theres no way out  
Whats it all about  
And how that name goes round my head  
I still see her face as she laid upon this bed  
  
Chorus  
  
Just say the word Ill run to you  
Ill be the man you want me to  
How Id miss you I never knew  
  
Chorus  
  
Even the wind says your name girl  
When I think of you Im aflame girl  
Jody even the wind says your name girl  
When I think of you Im aflame girl
