Cause I cant go on without you this time

We will be close by the fireside  
  
Baby I know  
  
So strong baby strong  
  
The stars shine so bright  
  
The moon and the sky  
  
With you means more than life  
  
Since i met you  
  
My heart has been true to you  
  
  
CHORUS  
  
So lets make tonight special
