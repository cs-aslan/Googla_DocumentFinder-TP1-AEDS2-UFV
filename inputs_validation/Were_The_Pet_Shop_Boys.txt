Were the Pet Shop Boys  
Suburbias a slipstream  
To a memory  
Of a time when you were  
Close to me  
I pretend  
Im there again  
I close my eyes and see you  
Better than before  
Then I feel you touch me  
And its 1984  
I know what you will say  
Before you start  
In my heart  
  
Were the Pet Shop Boys  
Were the Pet Shop Boys  
  
Every thoughts a fashion  
Or a crime  
And every boy is just  
A waste of time  
But I pretend  
It was different then  
Maybe its a habit  
Maybe its a sin  
But I find out  
When I try it on  
It crawls beneath my skin  
Once it gets inside me  
It wont go  
Now I know  
  
Were the Pet Shop Boys  
Were the Pet Shop Boys  
  
Rent  
Shopping  
Being boring  
Its alright  
Its a sin  
Im not scared  
In denial  
I want a dog  
I want a lover  
Can you forgive her  
Do I have to  
What have I What have I  
What have I done to deserve this  
  
Were the Pet Shop Boys  
Were the Pet Shop Boys
