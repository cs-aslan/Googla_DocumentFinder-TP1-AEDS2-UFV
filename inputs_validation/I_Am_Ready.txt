We can drown any rumours bout winners and losers sayin  
I aint ready for that  
When the love needs to grow and the world wants to  
Know we gotta keep it under your hat  
Bridge  
Sometimes those close to you find it hard to feel your pain  
Sometimes you wanna surrender but you say here I come again  
Chorus  
Im the survivor  
Even denier  
I felt compasion even with knives in my back  
But you know it aint over when you feel the tears dry  
You can laugh at the clouds in the sky and it dont seem so black  
Oh I belive in the love that your givin and Im ready for that yeah  
Im a survivor I felt compasion  
Im a survivor you can laugh at the clouds in the  
Sky aint it dont seem so bad  
  
Feelings gone and fast then its suddenly back you were  
Over and now your a queen  
You forget who you are for they made you a star now  
Your hotter than you ever been  
Bridge  
Sometimes those close to you find it hard to feel your pain  
Sometimes you wanna surrender but you say here I come again  
Chorus  
Im the survivor  
Even denier  
I felt compasion even with knives in my back  
But you know it aint over when you feel the tears dry  
You can laugh at the clouds in the sky and it dont seem so black  
Oh I belive in the love that your givin and Im ready for that yeah  
Im the survivor  
Even denier
