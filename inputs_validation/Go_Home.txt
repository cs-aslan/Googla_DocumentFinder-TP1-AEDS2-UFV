Her parents said girl dont leave home  
But her heart kept cheering her on  
She had a real good man steady job  
But the two of them just werent in her heart  
  
She only wanted to be close to me  
To give me the love she knew someday Id need  
But I kept saying girl youre wrong go home  
  
Long days short nights when youre on the road  
For a pretty girl its a heavy load  
And even so wholl pay your fare  
She said Ill make it on a wing and a prayer  
  
She only wanted to be close to me  
To give me the love she knew someday Id need  
But I kept saying girl youre wrong go home  
  
She said Ive on right to tell her how life should be  
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me  
But she agreed to go along with my final word  
  
As fate would have life come around  
My world started tumbling down  
I lost my family my friends and job  
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start  
  
She only wanted to be close to me  
To give me the love she knew someday Id need  
But I kept saying girl youre wrong go home  
  
She said Ive on right to tell her how life should be  
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me  
But she agreed to go along with my final word my final word  
  
As fate would have life come around  
My world started tumbling down  
I lost my family my friends and job  
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start  
  
She only wanted to be close to me  
To give me the love she knew someday Id need  
But I kept saying girl youre wrong go home  
She only wanted to be close to me  
To give me the love she knew someday Id need  
But I kept saying girl youre wrong go home  
Go home baby you better go home right now  
Go home little girl you better go home
