By David Allan Coe  
Shes hard to get started  
Shes always so cold  
In the mornings I find her   
Shes looking so old  
Theres so many miles  
Ive been down that road once or twice  
Shes not much to look at  
When we ride through town  
But I know when the chips fall  
She wont let me down  
She knows how to run  
And she dont run around on her man  
Shes a high flyin lady  
She takes me where I want to be  
Theres no other woman  
Standing between her and me  
Ill always be faithful  
And keep her til the end of time  
God knows Ill always love  
That old Panhead of mine  
Ive seen fancy dressers  
And theyve caught my eye  
I rodeem to rideem  
Then I told them goodbye  
I flirted with Low Riders  
Sportsters and Shovelheads too  
I cussed her and beat her  
And kicked her to just get her started  
A couple of times  
God knows Ill always love  
That old Panhead of mine
