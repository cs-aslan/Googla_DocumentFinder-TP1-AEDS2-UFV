You told me it was so a million dreams ago  
You held me in your arms a million dreams ago  
So many dreams have flown so many nights alone  
I guess I should have known it couldnt be  
Ill lock my memories here in my heart  
  
And here in my heart theyll stay  
And through the years theyll always be part  
A part of a lovely day  
Goodbye good luck old friend Ill smile and just pretend  
There was no end a million dreams ago  
  
Goodbye good luck old friend Ill smile and just pretend  
There was no end a million dreams ago
