Silent as a willow tree  
This road moves like a a river to me  
Sun goes down on Wisdom Street  
Break the glass and throw away the key  
  
Somewhere out where the fates collide collide  
Cigarettes and candlelight  
I sit here in the lone cafe  
So stripped away oh oh  
So stripped away  
  
Ah huh  
Huhhuh  
Oh ah oh ah  
  
Everybody knows  
Im your street corner Romeo  
Everybody knows  
Youre my Juliet in rags  
And Charlie Parker loves me  
  
Sit with me forever more  
Is the draft too cold when they open door  
Seem to me whenever youre drunk  
And well drift away drift away drift away  
  
Ah huh  
Huhhuh  
Oh ah oh ah  
  
Everybody knows everybody  
Im your street corner Romeo oh yeah  
Everybody knows  
Youre my Juliet in rags  
And Charlie Parker loves me ooh  
  
I feel your heart beat underneath my skin  
Like a New Orleans night  
But the rain cant get in  
So redhot dig the beat up underneath a cool cool night  
And the glass moonlight of spring  
  
Everybody knows ooh  
Im your street corner Romeo oh yeah  
Everybody knows know yeah  
Youre my Juliet in rags  
  
Everybody knows everybody knows  
Im your street corner Romeo yes I am  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Everybody knows yeah  
Youre my Juliet in rags  
And Charlie Parker loves me ooh  
  
Everybody knows  
Im listenin to ya Charlie  
Im your street corner Romeo  
Bird is fly high tonight  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
Charlie Parker loves me  
  
Everybody knows yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Fly away Charlie  
Im your street corner Romeoaca
