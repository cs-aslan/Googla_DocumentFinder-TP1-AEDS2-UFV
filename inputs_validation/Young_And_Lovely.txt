Fridays child is planning to out for the first time  
Says Dont worry Mum I wont be out that late  
Cant be playing those passive games right now theyre out of date  
Youre awfully sweet havent got the time  
Growing up so fast got better things to do  
You can get what you want youre so young and lovely  
  
Oh oh la la la  
  
Kicking around the center of the town lookin through shop windows  
Those mannequins look far too real at night  
Fridays child doesnt know if its awake or if its dreaming  
Says Dont worry Dad Ill do my bit Ill raise the flag  
Ill be just like you  
  
Dont worry Mum Im not that dumb Ill be just like you
