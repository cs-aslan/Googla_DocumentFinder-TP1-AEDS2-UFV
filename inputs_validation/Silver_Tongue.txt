Well Im standing here on moving station  
All the world is traveling by  
To strange outlandish destinations  
There they go I wonder why  
  
I may be crazy  
But Im no stupid  
I get along  
I use my silver tongue  
  
You know I can dream in any language  
Flying on my magic bed  
And I dont need to work my passage  
All I do is use my head  
  
I may be crazy  
But Im no stupid  
Sometimes I ramble  
Then Im Lucid  
I might seem lazy  
But Im hurting noone  
I get along  
I use my silver tongue  
  
I know exactly what youre thinking  
But you dont know whats in my mind  
You went too fast and now your sinking  
Because you forgot to read the signs
