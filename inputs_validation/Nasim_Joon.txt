Caught a train in a dash  
Running hard from my past  
Set to ride this here rail till the end  
Along the way met a queen  
Now Im her king  
And we reign our kingdom from a mountaintop  
Where baby we can be alone  
  
Almond eyes royal skin  
This one could do me in  
An Ill live this here life till the end  
We will win we will win were gonna win this here race  
Baby we can be alone  
My baby we can be alone  
  
Some day Ill give it all back  
The time you gave  
Now baby we can be alone
