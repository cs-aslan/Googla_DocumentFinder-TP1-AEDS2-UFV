Ive lived life in a single room  
Hiding my scars from the moon  
I dream my dreams in the light  
  
Rehearse the lines I already know  
Basking in the tvs glow  
And pray that tonight is the night  
  
Oh theres gotta be more than this  
A future hanging on a strangers kiss  
Could it be Im not so alone  
  
Im someone special  
Im just in disguise  
I may not be perfect  
In everyones eyes  
It may not be tomorrow  
But I still believe  
Theres someone special  
Waiting out there for me  
  
I guess the joke hasnt hit me yet  
Cause Im still waiting on my juliet  
She must be held up somewhere  
  
Ooh she will be the air I breathe  
Shell come for good and never want to leave  
And Ill love her only I swear  
  
People say there must be something wrong  
For me to be all alone so long  
And their words hit me like a stone  
  
Im someone special  
Im just in disguise  
I may not be perfect  
In everyones eyes  
It may not be tomorrow  
But I still believe  
Theres someone special  
Waiting out there for me  
  
Lying in bed in a cold cold sweat  
Dreaming bout women Ill never get  
I wont always be sleeping alone  
  
Im someone special  
Im just in disguise  
I may not be perfect  
In everyones eyes  
It may not be tomorrow  
But I still believe  
Theres someone special  
Waiting out there for me
