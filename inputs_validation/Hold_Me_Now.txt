The spring of Aprils gone  
The leaves have all turned brown  
The children are all grown up and theres no one around  
Im looking over my life  
and all the mistakes Ive made  
And Im afraid afraid  
  
See somebody told me that  You would wash all my sins  
And cleanse me from the scars  that are so deep within  
So Im calling to You If You can hear me  I dont how  
  
I was wonderin  
Can You hold me now  
  
You are the only one that patient when I fall  
Your angels come to save me everytime I call  
You dont laugh at me when I make mistakes and cry  
Youre not like man You understand me  
  
See people change one day they dont like you the next they do  
I wish that everyone could love me just like You  
  
So here I am this sinful man peace wont allow  
  
I was wonderin  
Can You hold me now  
I was wonderin  
Can You hold me now  
  
Ohohohohoh  
  
Ohohohohohohoh  
  
Ohohohoh  
  
To every broken person that may hear this song  
To every boy or girl that feel their smile is gone  
I know exactly how it feels to lay in the bed at night  
And cry And cry  
  
Dont you worry God is faithful and He cares  
About the tears you drop and the pain you feel  Hes there  
  
When you are weak thats when Hes strong even though you dont know how  
  
Yeahyeahyeah  
Yeahyeahyeah  
Yeahyeah  
  
God can and He will  hold you now  
God can and He will  hold you now  
God can and He will  hold you now  
  
Dont you worry  He can hold you now  
  
Ohohohohohohoh  
  
Ohohohoh
