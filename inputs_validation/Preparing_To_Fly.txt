Im preparing to fly  
under my own steam  
Im preparing to fly  
into a dream  
  
Im in love all over again  
Im head over heels  
I cant even begin  
to tell you how it feels  
She lives on a rock  
surrounded by light  
Shes young and shes wild  
and shes treating me right  
  
Im preparing to fly  
under my own steam  
Im preparing to fly  
into a dream  
  
I shed some light  
I change my address  
I havent felt so great  
since I first went west  
Ive got brilliant intentions  
unthinkable plans  
Ive got sparks and electric shocks  
just exploding from my hands  
  
Im preparing to fly  
under my own steam  
Im preparing to fly  
into a dream  
  
Im back in the saddle  
Im out in the clear  
I got no regrets  
Ive got nothing to fear  
Ive battled my demons  
come out on top  
Im gonna love you as hard as I can  
never gonna stop  
  
Im preparing to fly  
under my own steam  
Im preparing to fly  
into a dream
