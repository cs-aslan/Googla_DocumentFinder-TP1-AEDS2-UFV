Expanse of land that would cushion your fall  
As you tumble down from the sky  
Marble cakes of delicious design and  
Theyre yours you can fly  
  
I have no wings but I wish that I had  
I have dreams about it every night  
And I can soar with the wind in my face  
On my flight on my flight  
  
Wont you try and just bother  
Wont you bother to care  
And then somehow or other  
Youll be there  
  
Cotton clouds look like mountainous land  
Covered by December snow  
And I can see from my majestic view  
Down below yes I know
