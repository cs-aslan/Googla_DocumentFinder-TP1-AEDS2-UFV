I was born in the rotten part of the town  
The biggest trap I had seen  
Wherever youll go and wherever youll get to  
Evil is all around  
  
My mothers a bitch my fathers a killer  
Gettin paid for murder  
Fightin and strugglin the whole day  
The only way to survive  
  
Wanted from law but theyll never catch me  
Id much rather die in this bloody war  
  
Fly high touch the sky  
Never know the reason why it ends  
Victim of fate  
  
I had to kill people to save my own life  
I dont want to go to hell  
I started at the bottom  
Im headin for the top  
  
Ill never return Ill never go back  
To that goddamn part of the town  
Headhunters wont get me cause Im not stupid  
But this aint the life I dreamt of  
  
Wanted from law but theyll never catch me  
Id much rather die in this bloody war  
  
Fly high touch the sky  
Never know the reason why it ends  
Victim of fate  
  
What now lonely man whos standing  
In the shadows of the streets  
Youre left alone with no helpin hand beside you  
You hide from the daylight living in darkness  
You got no friends you can trust nobody  
Except for yourself  
The only shade thats beside you  
Is the shade of Lucifer  
Laughing with a satanic smile  
And his friend Death sharpens his sickle  
You dont want to die do you But you will  
You will burn in hell  
  
Fly high touch the sky  
Never know the reason why it ends  
Victim of fate  
  
Fly high touch the sky you will die
