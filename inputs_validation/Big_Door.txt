I did my baby wrong  
Left her all alone  
Maybe shell forgive me  
Now that Ive come home  
I stand here knockin on her front door  
  
Big door open wide  
Wont you let me in  
My loves on the other side  
Oh yes let me in  
Big door you stand too high between us  
Cant get under cant get over  
Big door swing open I still love her  
  
I never should have left her  
Her love was always true  
Maybe shell forgive me  
Oh what will I do  
Cause she wont answer her frontdoor  
  
Big door open wide  
Wont you let me in  
My loves on the other side  
Oh yes let me in  
Big door youre keepin us apart  
Cant get under cant get over  
Big door swing open I still love her  
Oh big door swing open I still love her  
Yes big door swing open I still love her
