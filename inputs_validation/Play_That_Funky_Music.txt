Im back and Im ringin the bell  
A rockin on the mike while the fly girls yell  
In ecstasy in the back of me  
Well thats my DJ Deshay cuttin all them Zs  
Hittin hard and the girlies goin crazy  
Vanillas on the mike man Im not lazy  
  
Im lettin my drug kick in  
It controls my mouth and I begin  
To just let it flow let my concepts go  
My posses to the side yellin Go Vanilla Go  
  
Smooth cause thats the way I will be  
And if you dont give a damn then  
Why you starin at me  
So get off cause I control the stage  
Theres no dissin allowed

The girlies sa y they love me and that is ok  
And I can dance better than any kid n play

But youll keep tryin to get my style  
Over and over practice makes perfect

Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino  
So punks stop trying and girl stop cryin  
Vanilla Ice is sellin and you people are buyin  
Cause why the freaks are jockin like Crazy Glue  
Movin and groovin trying to sing along  
All through the ghetto groovin this here song  
Now youre amazed by the VIP posse  
  
Steppin so hard like a German Nazi  
Startled by the bases hittin ground

Cause the lyrics belong to ICE You can call me Dad  
Youre pitchin a fit so step back and endure  
Let the witch doctor Ice do the dance to cure
