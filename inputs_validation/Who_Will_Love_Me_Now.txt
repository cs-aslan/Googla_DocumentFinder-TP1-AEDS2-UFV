Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
  
Well I tried to give up  
Walking the streets when I was with you  
Snug as a bug in a rug  
Never been so alone thinking about you  
  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
  
Trying on my own  
But living alone is one thing I can never do  
I could end it all now  
But Im not that crazy  
  
Who will love me now who will love me now  
Who will love me now who will love me now  
  
Oh I need all the love  
that you once used to give me  
Words are never enough  
Now you cant be with me  
I need all the love  
But who will take my hand and show me how  
Who will love me now  
  
Being home by myself  
Believing so much youd walk through the door  
And tell me you think Im a fool  
But you wont do that now  
Youve done it so often  
  
Who will love me now who will love me now  
Who will love me now who will love me now  
  
Trying on my own  
But living alone is one thing I can never do  
I could end it all now  
But Im now that crazy  
  
Who will love me now who will love me now  
Who will love me now who will love me now  
  
Oh I need all the love  
that you once used to give me  
Words are never enough  
Now you cant be with me  
I need all the love  
But who will take my hand and show me how  
Who will love me now
