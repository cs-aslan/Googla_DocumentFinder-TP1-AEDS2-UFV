I met her dancing to the Castle Rock  
I held her tight and danced around the clock  
We rocked to romance to the Castle Rock  
She kissed me and I kissed my heart goodbye  
I felt like I was drifting cross the sky  
We rocked to heaven to the Castle Rock  
Music was soft and low setting me all aglow  
Holding it to my heart how could I dream wed part  
Suddenly she was gone leaving me dreaming on  
Now everytime they play the Castle Rock  
Ill take myself a walk around the block  
Till she comes back to dance the Castle Rock  
Go get em Harry James for old times sake  
Im mad at dancing to the Castle Rock  
I held her tight and danced around the clock  
We rocked to romance to the Castle Rock  
Now everytime they play the Castle Rock  
Ill take myself a walk around the block  
Till she comes back to dance the Castle Rock  
Till she comes back to dance the Castle Rock
