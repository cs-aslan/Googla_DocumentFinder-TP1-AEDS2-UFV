Girl youve never known no one like me  
Up there in your high society  
They might tell you Im no good  
Girl they need to understand  
Just who I am  
  
Chorus  
I may be a real bad boy  
But baby Im a real good man  
  
I may drink too much and play too loud  
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd  
That dont mean I dont respect  
My mama and my Uncle Sam  
Yes sir yes maam  
  
Chorus  
  
Might have a reckless streak  
At least a country mile wide  
If youre gonna run with me  
Its gonna be a wild ride  
When it comes to lovin you  
Ive got velvet hands  
Ill show you how a real bad boy  
Can be a real good man  
  
Ill take all the good times I can get  
Im too young for growing up just yet  
Aint much I can promise you  
Except to do the best I can  
Ill be damned  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X
