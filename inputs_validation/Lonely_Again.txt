Youre supposed to give more than you take  
You had my heart on your plate  
You stopped loving me so fast  
There are stories left untold  
But you act like theyre all old  
But then you and I we belong together again and I said  
  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think Im feeling lonely again  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think Im feeling lonely  
  
Youre supposed to look into my eyes  
Forever and all time  
You stopped loving me that way  
And I never thought that I  
I would ever have to cry out  
That you and I we belong together again and I said  
  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think Im feeling lonely again  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think Im feeling lonely  
  
I feel you tossing and turning  
I know there are walls we have to climb  
I sit here waiting and yearning  
Cause I know we can get by  
  
Youre supposed to look into my eyes  
Forever and all time  
You start loving me again  
And now I know that I  
I will never have to cry out  
That you and I  
We belong together again  
  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think Im feeling lonely again  
  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think Im feeling lonely  
  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think Im feeling lonely  
  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh sha nah nah  
Whoaooh  
I think Im feeling lonely
