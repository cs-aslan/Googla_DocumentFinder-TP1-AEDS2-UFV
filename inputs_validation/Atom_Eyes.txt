Im dreaming and so it must be true  
Nothing else could look as good as you do  
And so in a rocket go  
Up to where the astros flow into space  
Dont hold me down  
  
Atom eyes dont worry your brain  
Take a break from everyday  
Sell the house the car the pain  
Just be sure to live again  
Atom eyes  
  
Im running away from your clues  
Atomizer sprinklers are spraying perfume  
Escape a lobotomy  
Theres a million heartstrings ready to fly  
Lets pull them now  
  
Atom eyes dont worry your brain  
Take a break from everyday  
Sell the house the car the pain  
Just be sure to live again  
Atom eyes  
  
Atom eyes dont worry your brain  
Take a break from everyday  
Sell the house the car the pain  
Just be sure to live again  
Atom eyes
