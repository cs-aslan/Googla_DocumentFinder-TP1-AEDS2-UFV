Whoa whoa ohhhhh whoa oh  
  
You can only push someone so far  
You can only break so many hearts  
We used to be love one another  
Now its lust for your lover  
Baby I was trying to burn bridges of stone  
Yeah  
  
Chorus  
You can only wait  
You can only wait so long  
You can only wait  
You can only wait so long  
In this game we play  
Cant tell right from wrong  
You can only wait so long  
  
Here come the memories of yesterday  
Heres the poetry  
Of all those things I couldnt even say  
You can only wait so long  
Before your flower petals are all gone  
Baby I was trying to burn bridges of stone  
Aint nobody crying for what used to be home  
Yeah  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Ohhh  
  
Why couldnt you hold on to me  
I was right here  
Laying in our bed  
Said ohh  
All those things I didnt see  
All those things I never should of said  
  
You can only push someone so far  
You can only break so many hearts  
You can only wait so long  
Before your flower petals are all gone  
Baby I was trying to burn bridges of stone  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Whoa Whoa  
  
Why couldnt you call out for me  
Its not like I was ever far away  
Said ohhh  
Tie me to the edge and start to leap  
Theres nothing left here  
But a million words to say  
  
We all have memories  
And I have spent my time in vain  
Heres to our enemies  
And I will leave you with no pain  
We will find a way somehow  
In this running just to know goodbye  
Baby I was trying to burn bridges of stone  
You wont find me crying for what used to be home  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
In this game we play  
We cant tell right from wrong  
Cause you can only wait so long  
In this game we play  
We cant tell right from wrong  
Cause you can only wait so long
