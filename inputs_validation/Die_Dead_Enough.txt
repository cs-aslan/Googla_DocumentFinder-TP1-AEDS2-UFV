Its twilight and I wake up hot  
My bodys soaked in a cold cold sweat  
I reenact the lurid scenes  
And clawed engravings in my head  
  
Oh I cant punch hard enough and I run  
I cant kick high enough and I run  
I cant shoot straight enough and I run  
I cant hold on enough and I run  
Oh I cant stay down enough and I run  
I cant take pain enough and I run  
I cant bleed fast enough  
I cant die dead enough  
  
The air is thick but the oxygens thin  
My heart is beating like a drum boom  
And ice is flowing through my veins  
Explosives on my lips and in my lungs  
  
Oh I cant punch hard enough and I run  
I cant kick high enough and I run  
I cant shoot straight enough and I run  
I cant hold on enough and I run  
Oh I cant stay down enough and I run  
I cant take pain enough and I run  
I cant bleed fast enough  
I cant die dead enough  
  
I dont know what Im running from  
And I dont know where Im running to  
Theres something deep and strange inside of me I see  
  
I dont know what Im running from  
And I dont know where Im running to  
Somethings compelling me to run into the dark  
  
And now I am more driven than before  
And now I live just to settle score  
And now I feel the nearness of your breath  
Now I introduce you to your death  
  
I am more driven than before  
I live just to settle score  
I feel the nearness of your breath  
I introduce you to your death  
I cant punch hard enough  
I cant kick high enough  
I cant shoot straight enough  
I cant hold on enough  
  
I cant stay down enough die dead enough  
I cant take pain enough die dead enough  
I cant bleed fast enough die dead enough  
I cant die dead enough die dead enough
