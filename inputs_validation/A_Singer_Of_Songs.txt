Im not a savior and Im not a saint  
The man with the answers I certainly aint  
I wouldnt tell you whats right or whats wrong  
Im just a singer of songs  
But I can take you for a walk along a little country stream  
I can make you see through lovers eyes and understand their dreams  
I can help you hear a babys laugh and feel the joy it brings  
Yes I can do it with the songs I sing  
Im not a prophet and Im not a priest  
Im not a wise man whos come from the East  
I wouldnt tell you whats right or whats wrong  
Im just a singer of songs  
But I can take you to a city where a Man was crucified  
I can tell you how He lived and I can tell you why He died  
I can help proclaim the glory of this Mighty King of kings  
Yes I can do it with the songs I sing  
Im not a great man I dont claim to be  
But when I meet my Maker and He questions me  
I wont hang my head Ill stand proud and strong  
And say I was a singer Lord I was a singer  
Yes I was a singer of songs
