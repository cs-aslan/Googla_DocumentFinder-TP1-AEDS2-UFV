Nicki Miraj  
  
Ah shit I got this whips is topless  
Yall couldnt see me looking through binoculars  
Look second to none all we do is drop this  
Six to six flow so I roll with dodges  
And Im in the club everybody wanna dub  
Sip a little bub and I probally wit a thug  
Play hard to get but Im thinking bout it  
So you whisper in my ear what you thinking shawty  
  
Lenny Harold verse 1  
Hey tryina do withcha cause shawty cause I deal with you  
You keep me inside of those try to guess what to do next  
Should I stay or should I go  
Is difficult to love ya  
When you dont know what you want  
And youre left with decisions while I got cloudy visions  
You know  
  
Chorus

Hey its burning me up just wanna get close to ya  
And youre playing games with this attraction

Oh I just wanna understand youre leading me for a reason

So come and take it baby
