Right from the first day one man stood alone  
And somehow he missed what didnt exist how could he have known  
He looked all around him and lifted his head  
For he heard a voice and rose to rejoice as somebody said  
  
This place needs a womans touch  
To share in the plan  
For without a womans touch  
Life dont mean much to a man  
  
Up through the ages the storys the same  
A king to himself alone with his wealth is living in vain  
His castle will crumble and hell wonder why  
Cause wealthy or poor theres one thing for sure he just cant deny  
  
The need of a womans touch  
To share in the plan  
For without a womans touch  
Life dont mean much to a man  
  
I was a drifter who couldnt be tamed  
So reckless and wild but lost like a child  
Whose dreams never came  
  
Then I felt the pleasures of loves happiness  
One look in her eyes and I realized  
Ive truly been blessed  
  
Thank God for a womans touch  
To share in the plan  
For it took my womans touch  
To make me feel like a man  
  
Thank God for a womans touch  
To share in the plan  
For it took my womans touch  
To make me feel like a man
