Sometimes we know sometimes we dont  
Sometimes we give sometimes we wont  
Sometimes were strong sometimes were wrong  
Sometimes we cry  
  
Sometimes its bad when the going gets tough  
When we look in the mirror and we want to give up  
Sometimes we dont even think well try  
Sometimes we cry  
  
Well were gonna have to sit down and think it through  
If were only human what more can we do  
The only thing to do is eat humble pie  
Sometimes we cry  
  
Fore they put me in a jacket and they take me away  
Im not gonna fake it like Johnnie Ray  
Sometimes we live sometimes we die  
Sometimes we cry  
  
Sometimes we cant see anything straight  
Sometimes everybody is on the make  
Sometimes its lonely on the lost highway  
Sometimes we cry sometimes we cry  
  
Gonna put me in a jacket and take me away  
Im not gonna fake it like Johnnie Ray  
Sometimes we live sometimes we die  
Sometimes we cry sometimes we cry  
  
Sometimes we live sometimes we die  
Sometimes we cry sometimes we cry
