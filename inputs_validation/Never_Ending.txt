Verse  
Lost in the mirror  
I knew your face once but now its unclear  
And I cant feel my body now  
Im separate from here and now  
A drug and a drink  
We lost connection oh come back to me  
So I can feel alive again  
Soul and body try to mend  
  
Chorus  
Its pulling me apart this time  
Everything is never ending  
Slipped into a peril that Ill never understand  
This feeling always gets away  
Wishing I could hold on longer  
It doesnt have to feel so strange  
To be in love again  
To be in love again  
To be in love again
