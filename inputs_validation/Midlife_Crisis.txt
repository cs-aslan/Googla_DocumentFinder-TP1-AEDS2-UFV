Go on and wring my neck  
Like when a rag gets wet  
A little discipline  
For my pet genius  
  
My head is like a lettuce  
Go on and dig your thumbs in  
I cannot stop giving  
Im thirtysomething  
  
Sense of security  
Like pockets jingling  
Midlife crisis  
Suck ingenuity  
  
Down through the family tree  
Youre perfect yes its true  
But without me youre only you  
Your menstruating heart  
  
It aint bleedin enough for two  
Its a midlife crisis  
What an inheritance  
The salt and the Kleenex  
  
Morbid self attention  
Bending my pinky back  
A little discipline  
A donor by habit  
  
A little discipline  
Rent an opinion  
Sense of security  
Holding blunt instrument  
  
Im a perfectionist  
And perfect is a skinned knee  
Youre perfect yes its true  
But without me youre only you  
  
Your menstruating heart  
It aint bleeding enough for two  
Its a midlife crisis
