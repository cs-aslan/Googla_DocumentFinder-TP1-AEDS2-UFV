The name is Potter hi there  
Im sure getting hotter mind there  
I told her quick she could see my pricked cactus  
Back in the confines of my home  
She didnt say yes but she didnt say no  
So were just gonna go get a cactus supper at home  
  
Nigger in the woodpile mind out  
Trigger as a docile find out  
  
Roll up roll up come and see me tickle me  
Sing me songs like youve never seen before  
Roll out old town to my place in town  
Its a case of a pound and a race to the bedroom door  
  
Roll up roll up come and see me tickle me  
Sing me songs like youve never seen before  
Hold on hold on till my place in town  
In the case of a pound and the race till the bedroom door
