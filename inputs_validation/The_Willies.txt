Everytime we get together  
Everytime your lips meet mine  
I start ashiverin and ashakin  
A quiverin and aquakin  
Ooh yeah you give me the willies  
  
Everytime I look at you  
You dont know what I go through  
Well my head starts reelin  
With a crazy kind of feelin  
Cause ooh yeah you give me the willies  
  
When we kiss thats the best of all  
Im outta my mind Im havin a ball  
I want this feelin to stay and stay  
So I hold you tight while I push you away  
  
Dont you know what you do to me  
Im afraid that you just wont see  
But Im laughin and cryin you got me sighin  
Ooh yeah you give me the willies  
  
Yeah everytime we get together  
Yeah everytime your lips meet mine  
I start ashiverin and ashakin  
A quiverin and aquakin  
Ooh yeah you give me the willies  
  
When we kiss thats the best of all  
Im outta my mind cause Im havin a ball  
I want this feelin to stay and stay  
So I hold you tight while I push you away  
  
Dont you know what you do to me  
Im afraid that you just wont see  
But Im laughin and cryin you got me sighin  
Wow ooh yeah you give me the willies
