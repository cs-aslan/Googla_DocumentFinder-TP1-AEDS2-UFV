Hey boy I better warn you  
To make your reservation  
Your exits overdue  
I can only promise he aint the soul to laugh  
Ive known him long enough to speak on his behalf  
  
My old mans got a gun  
And he knows youre a tricky one  
He cant fail to make you run  
And I dont need you  
My old mans got a wife  
And she loves him and her life  
Silver tongue could be his strife  
And I dont need you  
  
Hey boy dont let him fool you  
Ill tell you something about him gonna cool you  
Hell get you in a corner  
And make you really crawl  
Youll never realize  
A man could feel so small  
  
My old mans got a gun  
And he knows youre a tricky one  
He cant fail to make you run  
And I dont need you  
My old mans got a wife  
And she loves him and her life  
Silver tongue could be his strife  
And I dont need you  
  
I dont need you I dont need you  
Hey boy I better warn you
