Ive got a really bad disease  
Its got me begging  
On my hands and knees  
So take me to the emergency  
Cause something seems to be missing  
Somebody take the pain away  
Its like an ulcer bleeding in my brain  
Send me to the pharmacy  
So I can lose my memory  
Im elated  
Medicated  
Lord knows I tried to find a way to run away  
  
I think they found another cure  
For broken hearts and feeling insecure  
Youd be surprised what I endure  
What make you feel selfassure  
  
I need to find a place to hide  
You never know what could be  
Waiting outside  
The accidents you could find  
Its like some kind of suicide  
  
So what ails you is what impales you  
I feel like Ive been crucified to be satisfied  
  
Im a victim of my symptom  
I am my own worst enemy  
Youre a victim of your symptom  
You are your own worst enemy  
Know your enemy  
  
Im elated  
Medicated  
I am my own worst enemy  
So what ails you is what impales you  
You are your own worst enemy  
Youre a victim of the system  
You are your own worst enemy  
Youre a victim of the system  
You are your own worst enemy
