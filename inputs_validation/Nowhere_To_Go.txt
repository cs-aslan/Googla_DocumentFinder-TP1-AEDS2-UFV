Looking for beauty in a certain  
Finding the strength inside a gray  
Maybe Im heading for a breakdown  
And maybe thats ok  
Could be Im hanging on for dear life  
Maybe I need to get a grip  
Cause youre the only one  
That makes me feel like this  
So  
  
Chorus  
Save me Im falling again  
Keep me from breakin in a million pieces  
In the end no matter what I do  
Theres nowhere nowhere to go  
  
Nowhere to go but you  
  
Tryin to make nothing out of something  
Promise myself I wouldnt care  
Maybe youre making me a liar cause Im sitting here  
You finally crackin my resistance  
And find a way to wear me down  
  
Yea I just look at you  
And theres no way out  
  
Every single road I take its you  
Asleep or wide awake I know its you  
And its too late for anyone to save me  
  
Im falling again  
Keep me from breakin in a million pieces  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Nowhere to go but you
