She was circling the Holiday Inn  
Just about to go round again  
When her cell phone rang  
And it was him sayin Room 183  
  
Theyve never done this before  
But when he met her at the door  
They broke out smiling cause they were sure  
That this is what they need  
She said Mamas got the kids  
And he said We got the room for the weekend  
  
They love their kids and their house  
And that dog in the yard  
Oh and their neighbors for the most part  
They love each other but its hard to be lovers  
When life gets in the way  
Sometimes love needs a holiday  
  
He hung out the Do Not Disturb  
To shut out the rest of the world  
48 hours of just him and her  
You cant get this at home  
  
She pulled the covers back and  
He said Yeah Im in to that  
They flopped down together and took a nap  
No you cant get this at home  
They woke up in each others arms  
And thats where they spent the rest of the weekend  
  
They love their kids and their house  
And that dog in the yard  
Oh and their neighbors for the most part  
They love each other but its hard to be lovers  
When life gets in the way  
Sometimes love needs a holiday  
  
Room service dinner with candles and wine  
A night with no homework and no baby crying  
They hold each other like they used to do  
He whispers Girl Ive missed you  
  
They love their kids and their house  
And that dog in the yard  
Oh and their neighbors for the most part  
They love each other but its hard to be lovers  
When life gets in the way  
Sometimes love needs a holiday needs a holiday  
  
He hung out the Do Not Disturb  
Love needs a holiday  
Love needs a holiday  
Just shut out the rest of the world  
Love needs a holiday  
Love needs a holiday
