Paraphernalia  
Never hides your broken bones  
And I dont know why  
You want to try  
  
Its plain to see youre on your own  
Oh I aint blind no  
Some folks are crazy  
Others walk that borderline  
Watch what youre doing  
  
Taking downs to get off to sleep  
And ups to start you on your way  
After a while theyll change your style  
I see it happening every day  
  
Oh spare your heart  
Everything put together  
Sooner or later falls apart  
Theres nothing to it nothing to it  
  
And you can cry  
You can lie  
For all the good itll do you  
You can die  
  
But when its done  
And the police come and they lay you down for dead  
Just remember what I said
