I love to sit and watch you work the room  
You could have anyone you want to  
But I know youre going home with me  
Just when I think Ive got you figured out  
You spin me faster than the speed of sound  
But I know you know it makes me want you more  
Makes me want you more  
  
Boy youre turning me on  
I wanna be the bed that youll be laying on  
I wanna be yours  
Your anything and everything I wanna be that song  
Thats coming through your headphones  
  
Just like the purple lake in your tattoo  
Thats how close I wanna be to you  
Im in your skin Im playing in your head  
Playing in your head  
  
Am I turning you on  
I wanna be the bed that youll be laying on  
I wanna be yours  
Your anything and everything I wanna be that song  
Thats coming through your headphones  
  
I let my world revolve around you  
I whisper sweet things in your ear  
Ive never loved but Im about to  
Cant you feel us going there  
  
Am I turning you on  
I wanna be the bed that youll be laying on  
I wanna be yours  
Your anything and everything I wanna be that song  
Thats coming through your headphones
