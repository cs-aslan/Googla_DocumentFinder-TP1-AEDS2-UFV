Hello again  
Yes indeed my friend  
I can tell  
Goin get together again  
I could be right  
I could be wrong  
I feel nice when I sing this song  
And I dont mind  
Whatever happens is fine  
Baby likes to keep on playing  
What do I know what do I know  
Wilder than the place we live in  
Ill take you there Ill take you there  
I dont mind some slight disorder  
Pull up the roots pull up the roots  
And I know evry living creature  
Pull up the roots pull up the roots  
  
And I know you  
I understand what you do  
Yes indeed  
I put the hat on my head  
Come outta your mess  
Bring yourself in  
I feel nice when I start to sing  
And I can see  
Evryone else is like me  
  
Towns that disappeared completely  
Pull up the roost pull up the roots  
Miles and miles of endless highway  
Pull up the roost pull up the roots  
Colored lights and shiny curtains  
Ill take you there Ill take you there  
Evrything has been forgiven  
Pull up the roost pull up the roots  
  
Well I have a good timewhen I go out of my mind  
And its a wonderful placeand I cant wait to be there  
And I hear beautiful soundscoming outta the ground  
Gonna take us a whilebut well go hundreds of times  
  
Baby likes to keep on playing  
What dyou know what dyou I know  
Wilder than the place we live in  
Ill take you there Ill take you there  
And I dont mind some slight disorder  
Pull up the roots pull up the roots  
And no more time for talkin it over  
Pull up the roots pull up the roots  
  
Well I have a good timewhen I go out of my mind  
And its a wonderful placeand I cant wait to be there  
And I hear beautiful soundscoming outta the ground  
Someone musta been highbut I guess its alright
