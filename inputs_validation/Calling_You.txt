I had a dream that you stood right in front of me  
And called to me in black and white  
Though I could see you  
I couldnt reach you  
You faded into the light  
And when the sun turns a dream to reality  
Im left with such an empty space  
I feel your spirit  
Know that Im near it  
I swear I can see your face  
  
Chorus  
Hear me calling you  
Calling you  
But you just dont seem to answer anymore  
  
Am I supposed to pretend I dont feel the pain  
Like it happened only yesterday  
No use in trying  
To stop the crying  
I cant make it go away  
  
Chorus  
  
Hear me calling you  
Calling you  
But you just dont seem to answer anymore  
Im calling you  
Calling you  
And Im afraid that you wont answer anymore  
  
Where is the healing you promised me  
Maybe this feeling will burn in me forever  
  
Chorus
