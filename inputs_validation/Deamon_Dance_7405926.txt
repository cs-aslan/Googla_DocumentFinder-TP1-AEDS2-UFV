Welcome to the masquerade  
The ultimate feast  
The party that never fades  
Darkness unleashed  
  
As the earth is turning  
As the souls are burning  
Theres no more romance  
  
Deamons will dance  
  
  
Seven million four hundred  
Five thousand nine  
Hundred and twentysix  
Deamons will do their dance  
Cannot escape  
  
Holdong a crucifix  
  
Deamon Dance  
  
Theyve all been part of this  
For thousands of years  
Granting the wizards wish  
  
Obey out of fear  
  
Unholy Rites  
Leave nothing to chance  
In the dead of night  
Do the deamons dance  
Seven million four hundred  
  
Five thousand nine  
Hundred and twentysix  
Deamons will do their dance  
Cannot escape  
Holdong a crucifix  
Seven million four hundred  
Five thousand nine  
Hundred and twentysix  
Deamons will do their dance  
Cannot escape  
Holdong a crucifix  
  
Deamon dance  
  
Deamon dance  
No non no  
Deamon dance  
  
Centuries ago  
Unholy sacrifice  
Rivers of blood did flow  
Deamons arise  
  
  
As the earth is turning  
Theres no more romance  
As the souls are burning  
Deamons will dance  
  
Seven million four hundred  
Five thousand nine  
  
Hundred and twentysix  
Deamons will do their dance  
Cannot escape  
Holdong a crucifix  
  
Deamon Dance  
  
No no no  
Deamon Dance  
Ah
