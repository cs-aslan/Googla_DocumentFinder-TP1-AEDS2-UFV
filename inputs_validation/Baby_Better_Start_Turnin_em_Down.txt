Rodney Crowell  
  
In this modern world were livin  
The rules aint like theyve ever been  
Speakin of spreading it thin  
Thats what you do flashing your soul  
That aint no way to treat your lover  
Aint no way to act with feelings  
Baby better start turnin em down  
  
Now its a brave new wave were roarin in  
Hanging out out on the rock n roll fringe  
Speaking of running around  
All over town lettin it show  
That aint no way to treat your lover  
Aint no way to act in public  
Baby dont better start turnin em down start to turnin down  
  
Sure is clear aint nothin easy any more  
Sure gets cloudy when I look in all directions  
Sure is rainin like this feeling in my heart  
Sure is crazy how youre acting  
  
In this latest craze or current trend  
Burnin money every way that you can  
Speakin of goin for broke  
Thats how it is and lettin it slow  
That aint no way to treat your lover  
Aint no way to act with strangers  
Baby youd better start turnin em down start to turnin down  
  
Baby better start turnin  
Baby better start turnin em down  
Baby better start turnin
