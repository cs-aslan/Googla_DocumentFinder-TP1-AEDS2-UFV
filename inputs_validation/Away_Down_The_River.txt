Baby dry your eyes  
Theres no need to cry  
Cause Ill see you again  
It might be a while  
Before you understand  
  
Chorus  
Im just away down the river  
A hundred miles or more  
Crossing over Jordan  
To the other shore  
Ill be standing waiting  
With all whove gone before  
Im just away down the river  
A hundred miles or more  
  
Now the pictures on the wall  
Will help you to recall  
Theyre not there  
To make you sad  
But to remember  
All the good times we had  
  
Chorus  
  
When its time to leave  
Youre gonna feel the mountain breeze  
And the snow will fill the stream  
And carry you to me  
  
Chorus
