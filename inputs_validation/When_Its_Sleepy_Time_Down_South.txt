Pale moon shining on the fields below  
Folks are crooning songs soft and low  
Neednt tell me so because I know  
Its sleepy time down south  
Soft winds blowing through the pinewood trees  
Folks down there like a life of ease  
When old mammy falls upon her knees  
Its sleepy time down south  
Steamboats on the river a coming or a going  
Splashing the night away  
Hear those banjos ringing the people are singing  
They dance til the break of day hey  
Dear old southland with his dreamy songs  
Takes me back there where I belong  
How Id love to be in my mammys arms  
When its sleepy time way down south  
Dear old southland with his dreamy songs  
Take me back there where I belong  
How Id love to be in my mammys arms  
When its sleepy time down south  
Sleepy time down south
