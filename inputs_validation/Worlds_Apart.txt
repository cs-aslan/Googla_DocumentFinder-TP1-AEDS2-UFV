Theres nothing quite as lonely  
As a sky that turns to gray  
Or a love that just starts dyin  
And slowly fades away  
  
You werre my best companion  
Now we lie silent in the dark  
Why do you and me have to be worlds apart  
  
Theres nothing quite as empty  
As when children go away  
And all thats left are memories  
Of all those yesterdays  
  
You cant understand the feeling  
Til it finds its way to your heart  
Why do you and me have to be worlds apart  
  
Theres nothing quite as ugly  
As two people full of hate  
Well all end up as equals  
When we stand at heavens gate  
  
Love is still the answer  
Its the only place to start  
Why do you and me have to be worlds apart
