We are riding on a railroad singing some elses song  
Forever standing by the cross road  
Take a side and step along  
We are sailing away on a river to the sea  
Maybe you an me can meet again  
We are riding on a railroad singing someone elses song  
Sing along  
Time to time I tire of the life that Ive been leading  
Town to town day by day  
Theres a man up here who claims to have his hands upon the reins  
There are chains upon his hands and hes riding upon a train  
We are riding on a railroad singing some elses song  
Forever standing by the cross road  
Take a side and step along  
We are sailing away on a river to the sea  
Maybe you an me can meet again  
We are riding on a railroad singing someone elses song
