I remember the way  
Our sainted mother  
Would sit and croon us  
Her lullaby  
  
Miss Hannigan  
Shed say kids theres a place  
Thats like no other  
You got to get there before you die  
  
Rooster  
You dont get there  
By playing from the rule book  
  
Hannigan  
You stack the aces  
  
Rooster  
You load the dice

While we get peanuts  
Shes livin fat

That little lady  
  
Hannigan  
To gettin more bucks  
  
Rooster

Maybe we fix the game  
With something shady
