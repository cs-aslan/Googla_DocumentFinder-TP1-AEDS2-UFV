I never thought the taste of you  
Would be the only thing to make me bleed  
Why am I so alive  
While you lie still in the ground beneath me  
  
Fear of death the dark inside  
Have become your only children  
Theyre in front of you watching you  
Lost screams unholy dreams unrest  
  
I laugh at your god as hes passing through  
Slicing at your throat to warm my skin  
Never thought itd come to this  
Fuck Ive gone wrong no rest  
  
Your children still call  
Cant you hear them screaming out your name  
Youve gone insane theyre in my head  
They want you to die in front of me die in front of me  
  
Thinking why me  
Wishing this was all a dream  
Insanity reality youre going to  
Die in front of me  
  
Pestilence is here death awaits your body is not of Christ  
Its my alter helpless and alone violate enveloped in my skin  
Faceless canvass tearing all your flesh bathed in blood  
Violently regress deaths so endless brutal is your pain  
  
Anguish is a game broken and afraid god cant help you now  
Youll wish your in hell ghostly figures are always standing still  
Are they mocking me what do they see  
I didnt want your death to end so fast but once you start you cannot stop  
  
I need it now to fucking last die in front of me  
Die in front of me thinking why me  
Wishing this was all a dream insanity reality  
Youre going to  
  
Die in front of me pestilence is here death awaits  
Your body is not of Christ  
Its my alter brutal is your pain anguish is a game  
Broken and afraid god cant help you now  
  
Youll wish your in hell I never thought the taste of you  
Would be the only thing to make me bleed all alone in my  
Funeral home playing in blood theres just got to be  
Somethings wrong with me draining veins its all the same  
  
The torture in my head it wont stop until I am fucking dead  
Pestilence is here death awaits your body is not of Christ  
Its my alter helpless and alone violate enveloped in my skin  
Faceless canvass tearing all your flesh bathed in blood  
  
Violently regress deaths so endless brutal is your pain  
Anguish is a game broken and afraid god cant help you now  
Youll wish your in hell
