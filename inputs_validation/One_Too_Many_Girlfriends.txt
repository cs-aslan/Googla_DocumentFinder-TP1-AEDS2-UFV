Talkin bout a hotwired kid who thought he knew it all  
And what he didnt know he didnt need to  
Changin women like tires when their use wore thin  
Retread feelings thats all we knew  
Hes been runnin lights for years grindin down those forward gears  
Hes got a lady in the back seat lady in the front seat  
Eyes on the road and whispers in both ears  
  
Chorus  
One too many girlfriends and too little feeling left  
He better find the one hes gonna take on the run before it runs him down  
Hes got far too many choices he better make a few of them  
He wants to have it all and wind up standin tall  
I hope his dream never ends I guess it just depends  
Hes got one too many girlfriends  
  
Well theres so damn much writin written on his walls  
I cant imagine that he doesnt read it  
Such a loud clear message screaming through the halls  
Keep your advice he dont need it  
Hes heard of living up to the truth thinks it means giving up his youth  
He doesnt want to get a haircut looking for a shortcut  
He needs a change he needs more than a phone booth  
  
Chorus  
  
Whooo theres anger and romance at every turn  
Whooo be careful boy that you dont crash and burn  
Youre in about as deep as you can get  
Its a matter of time before you get wet  
I wouldnt be in your shoes on a bet  
  
Hes been runnin lights for years grindin down those forward gears  
Hes got a lady in the back seat lady in the front seat  
Eyes on the road and whispers in both ears  
  
Chorus  
  
Hes got one too many girlfriends look out
