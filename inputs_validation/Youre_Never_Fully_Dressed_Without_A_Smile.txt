spoken This is Bert Healy saying  
singing now Hey hobo man  
Hey Dapper Dan  
Youve both got your style  
But Brother  
Youre never fully dressed  
Without a smile  
  
Your clothes may be Beau Brummelly  
They stand out a mile   
But Brother  
Youre never fully dressed  
Without a smile  
  
Who cares what theyre wearing  
On Main Street  
Or Saville Row  
Its what you wear from ear to ear  
And not from head to toe  
That matters  
  
So Senator  
So Janitor  
So long for a while  
Remember  
Youre never fully dressed  
Without a smile

Ready or not here he goes  
Listen to Bert  
Tap his smilin toes

They stand out a mile
