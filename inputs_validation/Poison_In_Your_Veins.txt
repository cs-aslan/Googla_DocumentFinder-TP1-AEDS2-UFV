I paint a smile on you  
Cause you want me to  
Then I unmask you  
Laughing in your face  
  
If you had half a mind  
I wouldnt even try  
But youre so naive  
Just cant let you be  
  
Make me glorious  
And victorious  
Im superior  
  
Time to pay the price  
Throw off my disguise  
Poison in your veins  
So easily deceived  
The lie that you believe  
Poison in your veins  
  
You follow my advice  
And feed my appetite  
What you leave behind  
I will claim as mine  
  
In the end youll see  
What youre meant to be  
Something obsolete  
Mission is complete  
  
Call me a disgrace  
To the human race  
I dont give a damn  
  
Its time to pay the price  
Throw off my disguise  
Poison in your veins  
So easily deceived  
The lie that you believe  
Poison in your veins
