When Im alone at night  
And theres no one to comfort me  
I think of you  
And suddenly my pillow is your face and your arms  
And when the winter wind comes chasin after me  
I think of you  
And its as though I crawl beneath the blanket  
Soft and warm  
  
How did I get from dark to daylight  
Before you happened to pass by  
How did I find my way through life  
Before you brightened up my sky  
Was there a sky at all  
Until you painted it for me  
How did I get on  
Till you came along  
  
Who knows how many times I pause in every day  
To think of you  
As often as the sun sails out upon the silent sea  
And if youre wonderin why it is I only think of you  
Well its because Id like to be as close to you  
As youve become to me  
I think of you  
I think of you
