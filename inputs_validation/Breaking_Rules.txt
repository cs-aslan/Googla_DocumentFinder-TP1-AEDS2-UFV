Sonys out here tellin the world its Michael Jackson

Just when you thought it was wrong they go and do it again  
Pushin this around the world today

But theyre Breakin Rules theyre Breakin Rules

Theyre out here killing the love of Michael Jackson  
Just when you thought it was done now its a weapon  
You turn your back on His love  
And sell a Phony as Him
