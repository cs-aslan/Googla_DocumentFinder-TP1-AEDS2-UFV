Your grace is all I need  
Your love is all I ever wanted  
Your presence in my life  
Jesus Your touch is my desire  
  
My heart it sings for You  
My every breath is Yours my Jesus  
I live to worship You  
Jesus Youre everything  
  
You are all I want  
You are everything I need  
My soul thirsts for You  
You are more than life to me  
  
Youre all I need  
Youre all I need  
Youre all I need  
Jesus  
  
Youre all I live for  
Jesus
