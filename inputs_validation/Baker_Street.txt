Winding your way down on Baker Street  
Lite in your head and dead on your feet  
Well another crazy day you drink the night away  
And forget about everything  
  
These city streets make you feel so cold  
Its got so many people but its got no soul  
And its taken you so long to find out you were wrong  
When you thought it held everything  
  
Used to think that it was so easy  
Used to say that it was so easy  
Youre tryin youre tryin now  
Another year and then youd be happy  
One more year and then youd be happy  
Youre cryin youre cryin now  
  
Way down the street theres a light in his place  
You open the door hes got that look on his face  
And he asks you where youve been  
You tell him who youve seen  
And you talk about anything  
  
Hes got this dream about buyin some land  
Hes gonna give up the booze and the one night stands  
Then hell settle down its a quiet little town  
And forget about everything  
  
But you know hell always keep moving  
Know hes never gonna stop moving  
Cause hes rollin hes the rolling stone  
And when you wake up its a new morning  
The sun is shining its a new morning  
Youre goin youre goin home
