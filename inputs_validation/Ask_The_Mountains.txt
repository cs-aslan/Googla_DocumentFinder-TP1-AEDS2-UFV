Dont come after  
Dont come after  
Dont come after  
  
Come

Dont come after  
Dont come after  
Please dont follow me along  
When you read this Ill be gone  
  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
Why couldnt this go on  
Couldnt our happiness go on  
Ask the sun that lightens up the sky  
When the night gives in to tell you why  
  
Ask the mountains  
Wild woods highlands  
Ask the green in the woods and the trees  
The cold breeze coming in from the sea  
  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
  
Ask the sun that lightens up the sky  
When the night gives in to tell you why  
  
Tell the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
  
Why couldnt this go on  
Couldnt our happiness go on  
  
Why couldnt this go on  
Couldnt our happiness go on
