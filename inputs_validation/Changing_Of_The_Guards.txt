Originally by Bob Dylan  
  
Sixteen years  
Sixteen banners united over the field  
Where the good shepherd grieves  
Desperate men desperate women divided  
Spreading their wings neath falling leaves  
  
Fortune calls  
I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace  
Merchants and thieves hungry for power my last deal gone down  
Shes smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born  
On midsummers eve near the tower  
  
The coldblooded moon  
The captain waits above the celebration  
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid  
Whose ebony face is beyond communication  
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid  
  
They shaved her head  
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo  
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale  
I seen her on the stairs and I couldnt help but follow  
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil  
  
I stumbled to my feet  
I rode past destruction in the ditches  
With the stitches still mending beneath a heartshaped tattoo  
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches  
Were handing out the flowers that Id given to you  
  
The palace of mirrors  
Where dog soldiers are reflected  
The endless road and the wailing of chimes  
The empty rooms where her memory is protected  
Where the angels voices whisper to the souls of previous times  
  
She wakes him up  
Fortyeight hours later the sun is breaking  
Near broken chains mountain laurel and rolling rocks  
Shes begging to know what measures he now will be taking  
Hes pulling her down and shes clutching on to his long golden locks  
Gentlemen he said I dont need your organization Ive shined your shoes  
Ive moved your mountains and marked your cards  
But Eden is burning either brace yourself for elimination  
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards  
  
Peace will come  
With tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire  
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall  
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating  
Between the King and the Queen of Swords
