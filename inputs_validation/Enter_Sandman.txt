Say your prayers little one  
Dont forget my son  
To include everyone  
  
Tuck you in warm within  
Keep you free from sin  
Till the sandman he comes  
  
Sleep with one eye open  
Gripping your pillow tight  
  
Exit light  
Enter night  
Take my hand  
Were off to nevernever land  
  
Somethings wrong shut the light  
Heavy thoughts tonight  
And they arent of Snow White  
Dreams of war dreams of liars  
Dreams of dragons fire  
And of things that will bite  
  
Sleep with one eye open  
Gripping your pillow tight  
  
Exit light  
Enter night  
Take my hand  
Were off to nevernever land  
  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
I pray the Lord my soul to keep  
I pray the Lord my soul to keep  
If I die before I wake  
If I die before I wake  
I pray the lord my soul to take  
I pray the lord my soul to take  
  
Hush little baby dont say a word  
And never mind that noise you heard  
Its just the beasts under your bed  
In your closet in your head  
  
Exit light  
Enter night  
Grain of sand  
  
Exit light  
Enter night  
Take my hand  
Were off to nevernever land  
  
Ooh yeah Yeah  
  
Were off to nevernever land  
Take my hand  
Were off to nevernever land  
Take my hand
