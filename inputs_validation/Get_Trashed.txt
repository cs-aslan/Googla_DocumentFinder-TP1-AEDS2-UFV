Sitting here on the bed  
Trying to clear my head  
But Brooke you just wont budge  
So I look back instead  
Whyd you go away  
Useless when I say  
Hey  
Baby Ill be the best  
Cause Im a jealous mess  
So wash your hands from all this dirt  
And take my words for what theyre worth  
Baby Ill be the best  
But you stand to protest  
And my stomach has been so abused  
Your confusions got me so confused  
But everything will be alright  
If I get trashed tonight  
Sitting here on the bed  
Trying to clear my head  
But Brooke you just wont budge  
So I look back instead  
Whyd you go away  
Useless when I say  
Hey  
Baby Ill be the best  
cause Im a jealous mess  
And my stomach has been so abused  
Your confusions got me so confused  
But everything will be alright  
If I get trashed tonight
