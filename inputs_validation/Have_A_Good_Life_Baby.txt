If we knew a way to go back through time  
To the place where love was lost  
We could take each others hand again  
And wander back across  
But we always seem to end up here  
Tryin not to say goodbye  
Baby we dont have to say the words  
Words can sometimes make you cry  
  
Ooh have a good life baby  
Take good care of yourself  
Have a good life baby  
Be happy with someone else mmm mmm ooh hoo hoo hoo mmm  
  
This time we really will let go  
And we wont look back again  
But pretend the sun is on a rise  
When the day is at an end  
So lets kiss and wish each other love  
Over one more sip of wine  
Oh honey try to give me one last smile  
And Ill leave you one of mine  
  
Ooh hoooo have a good life baby  
Take good care of yourself ah ha ha  
Have a good life baby  
Be happy with somebody else ah ha oh  
  
Ooh hoo hoo hey  
Have a good life baby  
Take good care of yourself ahh  
Have a good life baby  
Hope youll be happy with somebody else oh baby  
  
Have a good life baby  
Take good care of yourself ah ha ho  
Have a good life baby
