Nice girls not one with a defect cellophane shrinkwrapped so correct  
Red dogs under illegal legs she looks so good that he gets down and begs  
  
She is watching the detectives oh hes so cute  
She is watching the detectives when they shoot shoot shoot shoot  
They beat him up until the teardrops start  
But he cant be wounded cause hes got no heart  
  
Long shot of that jumping sign visible shivers running down my spine  
Cut the baby taking off her clothes  
Closeup of the sign that saysWe never close  
You snatch a tune you a match a cigarette  
She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet  
I dont know how much more of this I can take  
Shes filing her nails while theyre dragging the lake  
  
She is watching the detectives  
  
You think youre alone until you realize youre in it  
Now fear is here to stay Love is here for a visit  
They call it instant justice when its past the legal limit  
Someones scratching at the window I wonder who is it  
The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents  
Who are ready to hear the worst about their daughters disappearance  
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay  
It only took my little fingers to blow you away  
  
Just like watching the detectives dont get cute  
Its just like watching the detectives  
I get so angry when the teardrops start  
But he cant be wounded cause hes got no heart  
Just like watching the detectives
