If you want to walk out the door  
You dont need a key  
If you dont want to come by no more  
Ill set you free  
  
Whatever you want babe  
Whatever you need  
Just as long as you know babe  
What youre doin to me  
What youre doin to me  
  
If you want to say its a day  
I wont disagree  
I would never stand in your way  
That wouldnt be me  
  
Whatever you want babe  
Whatever you need  
Just as long as you know babe  
What its doin to me  
What its doin to me  
  
I would never tie you down  
Youve always been free to leave  
If you want to make it goobye  
Thats ok with me  
Got so tired of asking you why  
Ill just let it be  
  
Whatever you want babe  
Whatever you need  
Just as long as you know babe  
What its doin to me  
  
And if I try to find a reason  
For all the things I do  
Would you try to understand  the way I am  
And how I care for you  
Would you give me your undivided attention  
And the benefit of your doubt  
Ooh ooh
