Chorus  
Sometimes I wonder what Heaven feels like  
I hope it feels like tonight  
Hope it feels like tonight  
No one ever knows what tomorrow would be like  
I hope it feels like tonight  
Hope it feels like tonight  
  
With that look upon your face  
Baby I know what youre thinking about oh  
Youve got your lips along my body  
And Im not gonna stop you know oh  
You wanna take me to a place  
Where I cant control my face somehow oh  
You know Im down  
So boy you gonna let me down oh  
Oh you got your love dripping all over me  
The only thing I can say is uhuu  
I dont wanna wait  
Just My days  
Its yours come get it get it  
  
Chorus  
Sometimes I wonder what Heaven feels like  
I hope it feels like tonight  
Hope it feels like tonight  
No one ever knows what tomorrow would be like  
I hope it feels like tonight  
Hope it feels like tonight  
  
The way youre getting in  
I can tell youre not playing no more  
Im am angel in disguise  
With the devil as surprise for you oh  
There is no breaking no stopping  
Just go go go  
We sing And dont take it personal  
It feels like Heaven when  
Got me screaming on the morning oh oh  
Youve got your love tripping all over me  
The only thing I can say is uhuuu  
I dont wanna wait  
Just open up my   
Its yours come get it get it uhuuu  
  
Chorus  
Sometimes I wonder what Heaven feels like  
I hope it feels like tonight  
Hope it feels like tonight  
No one ever knows what tomorrow would be like  
I hope it feels like tonight  
Hope it feels like tonight
