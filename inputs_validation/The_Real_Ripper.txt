When youre out there lying in the sun  
Hes the one who keeps his clothing on  
Youd never know him on a train or a bus  
cos he looks just like the rest of us  
In the middle of the night its a different story  
Dont let him catch you all alone  
  
The real ripper  
  your pay packet    
The real ripper  
Wearing a dinner jacket  
Ask anyone you meet and theyll say the same  
Noone is quite sure of his name  
  
Keep your hand on your heart but hes gonna get you  
Hes gonna make you toe the line  
  
Hes the  laden master of disguise  
And he invented high rise  
On the council theyre respectable and     
A bounce around the clock and turn away    
Ask anyone you meet and theyll say the same  
Noone is quite sure of his name  
  
The real ripper  
He went to school today  
The real ripper  
Took all the books away  
Keep your hand on your heart but hes gonna get you  
Hes gonna make you toe the line
