Every birthday every birthday  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah they hold on tight  
Ooh they hold on tight  
Them lips wont let me go  
Lips wont let me go lips wont let me go oh  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah they hold on tight  
Ooh they hold on tight  
Them lips wont let me go  
  
Dont let this go to your head  
But youre the best Ive ever had  
Not to mention  
That thing is swollen  
You got me oh so in a trance  
  
Something like a Ziploc but a lip lock  
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch  
Oh so hard walking out  
Got me stuck like crazy glue ooh  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah they hold on tight  
Ooh they hold on tight  
Them lips wont let me go  
Lips wont let me go lips wont let me go oh  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah they hold on tight  
Ooh they hold on tight  
Them lips wont let me go  
  
Got me tossing turning in the bed  
Your place is where I rather be instead  
You dont know your strength  
Missing you is like adrenaline  
Oh when you got me in a gridlock  
What a great spot  
Yeah that turned up kind of love and it just wont stop  
No so hard walking out  
Got me stuck like crazy glue ooh babe  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah they hold on tight  
Ooh they hold on tight  
Them lips wont let me go  
Lips wont let me go lips wont let me go oh  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah they hold on tight  
Ooh they hold on tight  
Them lips wont let me go no babay  
  
Holding back the faces I would make  
Im a fan and youre the rock star  
Making it hard on me  
Visualize a monster  
Cause youre too bad for me  
Shot that arrow Im hit  
Need you right near me  
Trying to maintain so dont mind if I turn away no no  
I try to maintain so dont mind if I turn away  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah they hold on tight  
Ooh they hold on tight  
Them lips wont let me go  
Lips wont let me go lips wont let me go oh  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah they hold on tight  
Ooh they hold on tight  
Them lips wont let me go
