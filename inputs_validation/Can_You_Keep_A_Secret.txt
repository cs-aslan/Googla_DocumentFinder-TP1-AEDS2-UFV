I want to be closer to your ideal  
I cant be a good girl Can you keep a secret   
  
Hit it off like this  
Hit it off like this oh baby  
  
You still cant read the signals Ive been sending from here  
Come on  
Ill get it across Ill stop just hide it away  
Until I cant runaway anymore  
Ill believe thats no good cause I still dont wanna believe it  
I want to be closer to your ideal  
I cant be a good girl Can you keep a secret   
Im not sad when youre here  
Can you keep a secret  Can you keep a secret   
I cant be closer to your ideal  
I cant change that quickly Can you keep a secret  
Cause Ill call to you when Im sad  
Can you keep a secret  Or do I have to keep it secret   
  
Hit it off like this  
Hit it off like this oh baby  
Even when youre by my side  
Im looking for a round about way to express it  
If you dont want this puzzle to go unsolved  
Wont you come on  
A faint sound  
The moving shadow giving chase  
A shadow that wont leave us alone  
Youll need to be a bit adventurous and have the courage to hurt  
I want to be closer to your ideal  
I cant be a good girl Can you keep a secret   
Im not sad when youre here  
Can you keep a secret  Can you keep a secret   
I cant be closer to your ideal  
After this theres no going back Can you keep a secret   
Show me that youre not going to go and blab it to everyone  
Can you keep a secret   
Or do I have to keep it secret   
  
Ive kept it quiet all this time  
Dont tell anybody  Can you keep a secret   
Im not sad cause youre here  
Can you keep a secret  Can you keep a secret   
Even if I promise not to hurt you  
Who knows really  Can you keep a secret   
Im not sad cause youre here  
Can you keep a secret   
Or do I have to keep it secret
