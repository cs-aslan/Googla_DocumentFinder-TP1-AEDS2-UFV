I was lost I was desperate and broken  
Wounded heart and the wounds were still open  
Thats the way You found me  
Thats the way You found me  
Turn the page by Your hand  
Yesterday washed away as You write in the sand  
My accusers where are they  
One by one in the silence they all walk away  
And I will worship You for all that You are  
And all Youve done for me  
As long as I live Ill sing  
Ill sing redemptions song  
Weeping comes in the night  
But theres joy blessed joy in the morning sky  
Now that I I belong  
To the One who has given the words to the song  
And I will freely sing of all that You are  
And all Youve done for me  
As long as I live Ill sing  
Ill sing redemptions song  
Sing redemptions song  
All that You are and all Youve done for me  
As long as I live I will sing  
I will sing redemptions song  
I was lost I was desperate and broken  
Thats the way You found me  
Thats the way You found me  
Thats the way You found me  
Thats why I love You  
Thats why I love You  
Thats why I love You  
Thats why I love You  
Thats why I love You  
Thats why I love You why I love You
