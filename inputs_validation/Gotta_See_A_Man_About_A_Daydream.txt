I could write for you  
A song about the warming of september  
But I couldnt really give to you  
That month in the spring  
  
And I could write for you  
Melodies dedicated to the seasons  
But Id be caught behind  
Remembering a reason not to sing  
  
And the music would accompany  
The words it brings along  
Why should I try  
How can I try  
I cant give you the seasons in a song  
  
I could paint for you  
A picture with a swirling world of color  
But I couldnt really give to you  
The brush strokes of my mind  
  
And in my tickertape parade  
All the memories of all my failures  
Would be summoned in  
And made to walk a step or two behind  
  
And models seldom find themselves  
In portraits that Ive drawn  
But I have cried  
And not denied  
That my colors arent clear enough in song  
  
You ask of me  
Whats a word that rhymes with all your confusion  
Dont you think thats just a little bit  
Unusual to ask  
  
Once you asked of me  
Once before what is a word for all your crying  
But you were laughing at me all the time  
Behind your tragic mask  
  
Now you ask me and my friends  
If you can pack and come along  
Why should I try  
How can I try  
If you can follow the honesty in song  
  
So Ill go skipping through  
All my daydreams at a thousand miles an hour  
And Ill try to sort things out  
Into an order if I can  
  
Ive got a couple things to do  
Before I come and talk to you again  
Well Ill meet you in a dream or two  
Down by the borderland  
  
Ive got a necessary game to play  
And changes to go through  
Its time to go time to go  
So its so long farewell  
  
And Ill be seeing you
