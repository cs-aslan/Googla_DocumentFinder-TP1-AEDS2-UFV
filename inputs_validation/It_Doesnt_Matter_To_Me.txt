Listen comrade I dont care  
How long you want to grow your hair  
  
It Doesnt Matter to Me  
It Doesnt Matter to Me  
Tell ya lady have you heard the news  
You can burn your wig and burn your shoes  
  
It Doesnt Matter to Me  
It Doesnt Matter to Me  
Cause theres something bigger than meets the eye  
Something important and its waiting for you  
  
Oh Yeah

Tell me something new  
Thats what I came here for  
  
It Doesnt Matter to Me

Cause theres a train pulling into the station  
  
And its headed for a new destination  
And I tell you my friend
