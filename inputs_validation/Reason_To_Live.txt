Out of love theres nobody around all I hear is the sound of a broken heart  
Out of time no more waitin for you  
Now the hurtins through and a new day starts  
And I feel a change in my life I sailed into dark and endless nights  
And made it alive  
  
Everybodys got a reason to live baby  
Everybodys got a dream and a hunger inside  
Everybodys got a reason to live but it cant be your love  
  
Out of touch with myself for so long now a feelin so strong comin over me  
Down the line theres a lesson Ive learned  
You can love and get burned if it has to be  
And I see a change in my life and Im not alone when Im strong inside  
And I realize  
  
Everybodys got a reason to live baby  
Everybodys got a dream and a hunger inside  
Everybodys got a reason to live but it cant be your love  
  
And I feel a change in my life  
And Im not alone when Im strong inside and I realize  
  
Everybodys got a reason to live baby  
Everybodys got a dream and a hunger inside  
Everybodys got a reason to live but it cant be your love  
  
Everybodys got a reason to live baby  
Everybodys got a dream and a hunger inside  
Everybodys got a reason to live but it cant be your love  
  
No it cant be your love no it cant be your love  
No it cant be your love
