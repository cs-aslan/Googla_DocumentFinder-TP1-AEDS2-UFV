I can be anything  
That you want me to be  
A punching bag  
A piece of string no  
That reminds you not to think  
  
They found the note down in your car  
Its not your fault it gets this hard  
Gets this hard  
  
Chorus  
Hold your head high  
Dont look down  
Im by your side  
I wont back down  
You wanted a hero tonight  
Well Im not made of steel  
Im not made of steel  
But your secrets safe with me  
  
I can be anything  
That you want me to be  
A holy cross  
Some sympathy no  
That reminds you how to bleed  
  
They found the note down in your car  
You climbed up here to fall apart  
Fall apart  
  
Chorus  
  
No your secrets safe with me  
  
They knock you down  
Ill pick you up  
They laugh at you  
Ill shut them up  
  
But Im not made of steel Repeat x4  
But your secrets safe with me  
Yeah your secrets safe with me  
Yeah  
  
Hold your head high  
Dont look down  
Im by your side  
I wont back down  
You wanted a hero tonight
