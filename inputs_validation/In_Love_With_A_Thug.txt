Snoop Dogg  
Yeah this shit right here sound like a love song  
she was in love  
A gangsta love song you feel me Check it out  
she was in love with a THUG in love  
she was in love with a THUG in love  
  
Yeah gangsta uhhuh  
Have you ever had a pretty young saditty  
Black female with chips from the city  
Her momma got ends and her daddy got ends  
And she liked to give me ends when Im out with my friends  
Good girl why do good girls like bad boys I dont know  
When I was a kid growing up I never had toys  
And I think that she can figure that shit out why  
Cause every time she came to pick a nigga up  
Shit shed take a nigga out  
Roll around town ask the pound they know look  
Baby was my thing nah she was my lowlow  
Bought my first Rolo and then we took a photo together  
Man I hope this thing last forever  
We been together six months and we aint argued yet  
She loving a nigga steady buying me shit  
And dont say shit when I dip with my click  
And understand when Im down and out  
May need some help with some chips  
Her mother approved of me but her father he dont  
He probably wont shit Pops aint no punk  
Daddys little girl be in a gangstas world  
Buying me house shoes and khaki blues California curls  
No matter what her father say baby gon see me  
Its like a jungle sometimes that makes me Wonder like Stevie  
Believe me when I say that baby was in love with a thug  
In love with a thug  
  
Chorus x2  
  
she was in love with a THUG in love  
Daddy Im in love with a gangsta  
she was in love with a THUG in love  
Momma Im in love with a gangsta  
  
Snoop Dogg  
Im caught up in the middle and I dont know what to do  
I caught eight months in the joint behind my crew  
That I gotta do and Ima miss you Boo  
But Ima write you every night and call you on the phone too  
What you gon do You know Im goin stay true  
But Ima go ahead to college like my father want me to  
Well um off to my cell with ya body on my mind  
And Ima call you back tomorrow round the same time  
Im on the mainline 9500 for short  
On another phone line hollan at my other hoe  
This bitch aint saying shit cause the bitch aint shit  
Old fat golddiggingass county check receiving bitch  
I bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap  
Niggas watching Soul Train and I wouldnt turn it back man fuck yall  
Never caught slipping always on strap  
And now Im back in the hole with no motherfucking getback  
Sit back and contemplate and think about baby  
And hope she dont get caught up in the world thats so crazy  
But while Im up in Wayside and she off in college  
She getting a little mo than a schoolgirl knowledge  
Cause gangstaass niggas go to school nowadays  
I tried to make you wait but I cant change yo ways  
She fell in love with the local G  
And now they both in the penitentiary she didnt mention me  
  
Chorus x2
