For I am the way  
Burn all effigies of clay  
Walk on water today  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
Today I turn my blood to sweetest wine  
A holy sign imbued with the divine  
Todays the day the gods walk out on me  
The great divide is crossed for you by me  
For I am the way  
Burn all effigies of clay  
Walk on water today  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
Today the silent one does have her say  
Today all contradictions seemed ok  
Todays the day that I become the sky  
A silent understanding my oh my  
For I am the way  
Burn all effigies of clay  
Walk on water today  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
Today for once Im not the last to learn  
Today the only bridge I have I burn  
Todays the day the gods walk out on me  
The great divide is crossed for you by me  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
For I am the way  
For I am the way
