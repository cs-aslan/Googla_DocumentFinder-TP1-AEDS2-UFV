Sweet little girl shes the high school queen  
She lives tonight in every school boys dream  
Oh but nobody knows how shes cryin  
Shes just a child goin on seventeen  
She gets so confused by her friends and their scenes  
They dont mean what they say  
They dont say what they mean  
She reads the signs reads between the lines  
But it makes no difference  
Theres no reason or rhyme  
Just hold on girl as long as you can  
In time youll learn what you dont understand  
Its the human condition its the nature of man  
Everybodys crazy everybodys crazy  
Everybodys crazy everybodys crazy  
This city boy he dont want no control  
He just wanna party and play his rock n roll  
But here they come to turn the pressure on  
Sayn son your partyin days are gone  
The time has come now to be a man  
Find your place in the world gotta take what you can  
Youve got no ambition take a look at yourself  
When ya gonna straighten out be like everybody else  
The boy said listen dad youre bringin me down  
I am who I am Ive had a good look around  
Theres one thing in the world I can tell you Ive found  
Everybodys crazy everybodys crazy  
Everybodys crazy everybodys crazy  
There aint no wonder things are so outta hand  
Sooner or later ya come to understand  
The human condition its the nature of man  
Everybodys crazy everybodys crazy  
Everybodys crazy everybodys crazy
