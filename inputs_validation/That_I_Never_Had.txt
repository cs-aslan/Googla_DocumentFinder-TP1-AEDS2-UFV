All these tears I cry  
Dont you wonder why  
Is it all a dream  
Never what it seems  
  
Gets under my skin  
Should I let you in  
Dont you think its bad  
To give me something that I never had  
  
Every word I say  
Everytime I pray  
Look into my eyes  
Distant voices cry  
  
Is there light in me  
Tell me what you see  
You are what I have  
Cant get something that I never had  
Cant get something that I never had  
  
Should I think about tomorrow ohh  
Should I live for just today  
Take the light that burns inside you  
  
Let it burn away  
Let it burn away  
Let it burn away  
  
Will I see the day  
Will I have to pay  
Whats inside of me  
You will never see  
  
Wont you let me in  
Dont you let me see  
Do you think Im bad  
Cause I want something that I never had  
Cause I want something that I never had  
  
Give me something that I never had  
Give me something that I never had
