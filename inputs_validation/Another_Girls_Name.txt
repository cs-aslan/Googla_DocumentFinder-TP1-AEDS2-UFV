Go take your bags away  
Get out of my home  
Get out of my life  
I dont want you hanging round  
And I dont want you to be my wife  
When I go to the cafe  
I sit in the seat that faces the mirror  
I look at my face today  
And I look such a wreck today  
I knew you well for five minutes and one day  
Ooh no way Jose  
I dont  ugly views  
And Im not interested in family muse  
And  is boring and conversation pours  
Even when were in bed  
I wanna rearrange your head  
Put down the covers  
And get you up against the wall  
Shoot good babe  
Well I knew you well for five minutes and one day  
Ooh no way Jose  
You follow where its going  
Cant you see I was breaking  
Howd you know the love making wasnt only faking  
You get out of my home  
And you get out of my life  
You didnt hang around much girl  
Cause now youre someone elses wife  
I go to the cafe  
And I sit in the seat that faces the mirror  
Well I look at my face today  
And I look so good today  
Well I knew you well for five minutes and one day  
Ooh no way oh no way oh no way Jose  
Youre just another girls names  
Ooh youre just another girls name X3
