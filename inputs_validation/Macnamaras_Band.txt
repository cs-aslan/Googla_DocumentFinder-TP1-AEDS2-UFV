Oh me name is MacNamara Im the leader of the band  
Although were few in numbers were the finest in the land  
We play at wakes and weddings and at every fancy ball  
And when we play the funerals we play the March from Saul  
  
Oh the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away  
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play  
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand  
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamaras band  
  
Right now we are rehearsing for a very swell affair  
The annual celebration all the gentry will be there  
When General Grant to Ireland came he took me by the hand  
Says he I never saw the likes of MacNamaras Band  
  
Oh the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away  
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play  
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand  
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamaras band  
  
Oh my name is Uncle Julius and from Sweden I did come  
To play with MacNamaras Band and beat the big bass drum  
And when I march along the street the ladies think Im grand  
They shout Theres Uncle Julius playing with an Irish band  
  
Oh I wear a bunch of shamrocks and a uniform of green  
And Im the funniest lookin Swede that you have ever seen  
There is OBrians ORyans OSheehans and Meehans they come from Ireland  
But by yimminy Im the only Swede in MacNamaras Band  
  
Oh the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away  
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play  
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand  
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamaras band  
  
Thats MacNamara
