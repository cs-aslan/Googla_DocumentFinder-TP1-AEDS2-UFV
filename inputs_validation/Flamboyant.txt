You live in a world of excess  
Where more is more and less is much less  
A day without fame is a waste  
And a question of need is a question of taste  
  
Youre so flamboyant the way you look  
It gets you so much attention  
Your sole employment is getting more  
You want police intervention  
Youre so flamboyant the way you live  
You really care that they stare  
And the press deployment  
Is always there Its what you do for enjoyment  
  
You live in a time of decay  
When the worth of a man is how much he can play  
Every day all the public must know  
Where you are what you do  
Cause your life is a show and  
  
Youre so flamboyant the way you live  
And its not even demeaning  
Youre so flamboyant Its like a drug  
You use to give your life meaning  
Youre so flamboyant The way you look  
It gets you so much attention  
Your sole employment Is getting more  
You want police intervention  
  
Every actor needs  
An audience  
Every action is  
A performance  
It all takes courage you know it  
Just crossing the street well its almost heroic  
Youre so flamboyant  
  
There you are at another preview  
In a pose the artist and you  
To look so loud may be considered tacky  
Collectors wear black clothes by Issay Miake  
  
Youre so flamboyant the way you look  
It gets you so much attention  
Your sole employment is getting more  
You want police intervention  
Youre so flamboyant  
The way you live  
You really care that they stare  
And the press deployment  
Is always there  
Its what you do for enjoyment  
  
Youre so flamboyant  
  
Youre so flamboyant
