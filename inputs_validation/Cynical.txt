Today dont look so bad compared to tomorrow  
If time is all we have then were living on borrowed  
Yesterdays for fools who try to remember  
The good old days werent always that much better  
  
Cynical  
Well I aint nothing but a Cynical  
It dont take much to be a Cynical  
All you need is love  
All you need is what to be a  
  
And whatever you do someones done it first  
Though its sad but true this is just another verse  
If you cant take it with you then whats the use  
I never saw a youhaul being pulled behind a hearse  
  
Looks like my brighter side has gotten a bit darker  
I must have stepped over my 4leaf clover  
cause someone drank my halffilled cup of water
