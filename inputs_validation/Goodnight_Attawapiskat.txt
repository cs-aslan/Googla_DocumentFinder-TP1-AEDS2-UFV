Hello Good evening folks  
We are the Silver Poets  
Here in our thousand mile suits  
Were here to get paid  
We know nobody ever who got laid  
Telling people what to do  
Weve come too far to feel like that  
Youve come too far to feel like that  
  
Attawapiskat  
City by the Bay  
Theres no denying that  
Oh Attawapiskat  
Youre on your way  
  
And though theres no sign  
Of a songbird up here yet  
No one to take advantage of  
We know that life is short  
Nobody can afford it  
To sing a song that they dont love  
Ive come too far to feel like this  
Youve come too far to feel like that  
  
Attawapiskat  
City by the Bay  
A diamond dazzling  
Oh Attawapiskat  
Youre on your way  
  
Youre on your way  
Youre on your way  
Youre on the way  
  
Oh Attawapiskat  
Oh goodnight Attawapiskat  
Thank you Goodnight  
Goodnight Attawapiskat  
Oh goodnight Attawapiskat  
Goodnight Attawapiskat  
Goodnight Attawapiskat  
Goodnight Attawapiskat
