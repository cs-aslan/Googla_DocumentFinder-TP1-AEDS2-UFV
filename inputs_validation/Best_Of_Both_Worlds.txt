Oh yeah  
Come on  
  
You get the limo out front ohohoh  
Hottest styles every shoe every color  
Yeah when youre famous it can be kinda fun  
Its really you but no one ever discovers  
  
In some ways youre just like all your friends  
But on stage youre a star  
  
You get the best of both worlds  
Chill it out take it slow  
Then you rock out the show  
You get the best of both worlds  
Mix it all together  
And you know that its the best of both worlds  
  
The best of both worlds  
  
You go to movie premiers is that Orlando Bloom  
Hear your songs on the radio  
Livin two lives is a little weird yeah  
But schools cool cause nobody knows nobody knows  
  
Yeah you get to be a small town girl  
But big time when you play your guitar  
  
You get the best of both worlds  
Chill it out take it slow  
Then you rock out the show  
You get the best of both worlds  
Mix it all together  
And you know that its the best of both  
You know the best of both worlds  
  
Pictures and autographs  
You get your face in all the magazines  
The best part is that  
You get to be whoever you wanna be  
  
Best Best Yeah the best of both  
Best Best You got the best of both  
Best Best Cmon the best of both  
  
Who would have thought that a girl like me  
Would double as a super staaaaaaaaaaaaaaar  
Woo  
You get the best of both worlds  
Chill it out take it slow  
Then you rock out the show  
You get the best of both worlds  
Mix it all together  
And you know that its the best  
You get the best of both worlds  
Without the shades and the hair  
You can go anywhere  
You get the best of both worlds  
Mix it all together Oh yeah

Cause you know youve got  
The best of both girls
