I got to get a message through  
I dont know where were going  
I wrap my arms around your naked shoulders  
take cover for the night  
I see you in the morning rain  
oh step inside and lay beside me  
Tender can you close my eyes and blind me  
oh give me just a smile  
  
Before I fade to silver  
Silver Blue for you  
Before I fade to silver  
Silver Blue for you  
  
Ive turned into The Broken One  
who lost the inspiration  
I want to give you all my love  
like water to a blood red rose  
The Passion I cant deal with her  
The Pain well I can do without him  
And this is like the milky way  
an ocean that only grows and grows  
  
And babe I fade to silver  
Silver Blue for you  
I turn and fade to silver  
Silver Blue for you  
  
I wrap my arms around your naked shoulders  
take cover for the night
