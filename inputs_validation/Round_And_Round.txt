I dont have to be so wise  
Youre just my fantasy  
And I will fantasize  
Something more or less to make this things started  
Were the artisans  
And weve been crafted  
I want to be your magical mystery  
I want to be your final history  
This is the news  
Nothings ever been so wild  
All that I get to do  
Is what I give to you  
This is all about the circles weve found  
And through the ups and downs  
It goes round  
Oh I was just beginning to grow strong  
She was only eighteen summers long  
We were the news  
Round and round it goes  
And oh dont you know  
This is the game that we came here for  
Round and round it goes  
And dont you know  
This is the news of my life  
Oh I was just beginning to grow strong  
She was only eighteen summers long  
We were the news  
Round and round it goes  
And oh dont you know  
This is the game that we came here for  
Round and round it goes  
And dont you know
