Same old place  
Same old city  
What can I do  
Im falling in love  
  
Im just an old hound dog  
Roaming around oh Lord  
Ive got all this and Heaven above  
  
Oh Atlanta  
I hear you calling  
Im coming back to you one fine day  
No need to worry  
There aint no hurry cause Im  
On my way back to Georgia  
On my way back to Georgia  
  
I get a feeling in me  
When I remember all those crazy days and crazier nights  
Cant you hear the music playing  
You must have heard them saying  
Were gonna rip em up and light up the night  
  
Oh Atlanta  
I hear you calling  
Im coming back to you one fine day  
No need to worry  
There aint no hurry cause Im  
On my way back to Georgia  
On my way back to Georgia  
  
Same old place  
Its the same old city  
What can I do  
Im falling in love  
  
Im just an old hound dog  
Roaming around Lord Lord  
Ive got all this and Heaven above  
  
Oh Atlanta  
I hear you calling  
Im coming back to you one fine day  
No need to worry  
There aint no hurry cause Im  
On my way back to Georgia  
On my way back to Georgia  
  
Oh Atlanta  
Hear me calling  
Im coming back to you one fine day hey  
No need to worry  
There aint no hurry cause Im  
On my way back to Georgia  
On my way back to Georgia
