Here comes Johnny singing oldies goldies  
BeBopALula Baby What I Say  
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman  
Down in the tunnels trying to make it pay  
He got the action he got the motion  
Yeah the boy can play  
Dedication devotion  
Turning all the night time into the day  
  
He do the song about the sweet loving woman  
He do the song about the knife  
He do the walk he do the walk of life  
  
Here comes Johnny and hell tell you the story  
Hand me down my walking shoes  
Here comes Johnny with the power and glory  
Backbeat the talkin blues  
He got the action he got the motion  
Yeah the boy can play  
Dedication devotion  
Turning all the night time into the day  
  
He do the song about the sweet loving woman  
He do the song about the knife  
He do the walk he do the walk of life  
  
Here comes Johnny singing oldies goldies  
BeBopALula Baby What I Say  
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman  
Down in the tunnels trying to make it pay  
He got the action he got the motion  
Yeah the boy can play  
Dedication devotion  
Turning the night time into day  
And after all the violence and double talk  
Theres just a song in all the trouble and the strife  
You do the walk you do the walk of life
