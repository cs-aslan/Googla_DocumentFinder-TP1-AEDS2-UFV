Just keep the motor runnin this wont take very long  
By the time the police get here well be already gone  
Weve got to leave em hangin we cant leave em no clues  
Just take the money and run  
Lord I love robbin banks Lord I love robbin banks  
I always tell the teller thanks Lord I love robbin banks  
  
I like to holler stick up when I walk through the door  
It lets em know their safe just isnt safe anymore  
I like to see their faces when I show them my gun then take the money and run  
Lord I love robbin banks  
 guitar   
Fivell get you ten shell push the burglar system  
Tenll get you twenty years on some prison farm  
The first thing that I do is make em lay on the floor then take the money and
run  
Lord I love robbin banks  
Lord I love robbin banks
