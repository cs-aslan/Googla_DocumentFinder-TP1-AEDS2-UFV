In the days when I was courtin  
I was seldom done resortin  
In the ale house and the playhouse  
And manys the house between  
I told me brother Seamus  
Ill go off and get right famous  
And when I come back home again  
Ill have seen the whole wide world  
And its goodbye Muirshin Durkin  
Im sick and tired of workin  
Ill no more dig the praties  
Ill no longer be a fool  
As sure as me name is Carney  
Ill go off to California  
And instead of digging praties  
Ill be digging lumps of gold  
Farewell to all the girls at home  
Im bound away across the foam  
Off to seek me fortune  
In far Amerikay  
Theres silver there aplenty  
For the poor and for the gentry  
And when I come back home again  
I never more will say  
Goodbye Muirshin Durkin  
Im sick and tired of workin  
Ill no more dig the praties  
Ill no longer be a fool  
As sure as me name is Carney  
Ill go off to California  
Where instead of diggin praties  
Ill be digging lumps of gold  
And goodbye Muirshin Durkin  
Im sick and tired of workin  
Ill no more dig the praties  
Ill no longer be a fool  
As sure as me name is Carney  
Ill go off to California  
Where instead of diggin praties  
Ill be digging lumps of gold  
Goodbye Muirshin Durkin  
Im sick and tired of workin  
Ill no more dig the praties  
No more be a fool  
As sure as me name is Carney  
Ill go off to California  
Where instead of diggin praties  
Ill be diggin lumps of gold
