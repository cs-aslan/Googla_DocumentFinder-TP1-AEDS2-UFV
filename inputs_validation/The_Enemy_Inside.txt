Over and over again  
I relive the moment  
Im bearing the burden within  
Open wounds hidden under my skin  
  
Pain is real as a cut that bleeds  
The face I see every time I try to sleep  
Staring at me crying  
  
Chorus  
Im running from the enemy inside  
Looking for the life I left behind  
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind  
And I cant escape from the enemy inside  
  
I sever myself from the world  
And shut down completely  
All alone in my own living hell  
Overcome with irrational fear  
  
Under the weight of the world on my chest  
I buckle and break as I try to catch my breath  
Tell me Im not dying  
  
Chorus  
Im running from the enemy inside  
Looking for the life I left behind  
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind  
And I cant escape from the enemy inside  
  
Im a burden and a travesty  
Im a prisoner of regret  
Between the flashbacks and the violent dreams  
I am hanging on the edge  
  
Disaster lurks around the bend  
Paradise came to an end  
And no magic pill  
Can bring it back again  
  
Chorus  
Im running from the enemy inside  
Looking for the life I left behind  
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind  
And I cant escape from the enemy inside
