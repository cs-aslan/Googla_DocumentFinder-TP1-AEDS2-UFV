I met her in a shooting gallery speeding like a goose  
Back when both of us were used to making strangers  
She shook me down for all I had and every way but loose  
But I was still too juiced to feel the danger  
And anyway now anymore you dont know which is worse  
Falling out of love or left behind  
I just seen the sweetest dreaming wind up like a curse  
Maybe one too many times  
  
Chorus  
But she said I dont want you baby I just want someone to hold me  
I got too much rock and roll to be a wife  
I cant live without the lightning and Im scared of growing older  
So Im bound to keep on running for my life  
  
Ive seen her roll herself into a tight and tiny ball  
Like a bellygunner crouching in a turret  
I said I recognize the symptoms girl I got the same disease  
I just havent got a clue to how to cure it  
And any way now any more you dont know who to trust  
Cause love is wild as lust and just as blind  
Anyone whos ever gonna love me  better fool me first  
And baby maybe I been one too many times  
  
Chorus  
But she said I dont want you baby I just want someone to hold me  
I got too much rock and roll to be a wife  
I cant live without the lightning and Im scared of growing older  
So Im bound to keep on running for my life
