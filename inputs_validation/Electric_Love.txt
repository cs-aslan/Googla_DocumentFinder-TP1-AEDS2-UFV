When I was down  
An angel came to me  
And she touched me inside  
That woman set me free  
Turned on the light  
So I could see  
That there was fire inside  
And I could feel the heat  
  
Shes got the power she gets me high  
She can take a storm and make it shine  
She keeps the spark burning over time  
That womans got electric love  
  
Ooo electric love  
There aint no medicine  
That makes me fly  
Like when Im with my sweet woman  
She keeps me so satisfied  
And if we had no money  
Wed still get by  
And if the world should stop turnin  
Our love would be alive  
  
Shes got the power she gets me high  
She can take a storm and make it shine  
She keeps the spark burning over time  
That womans got electric love  
Look out  
  
Shes got the power shes gets me high  
She can take a storm and make it shine  
She keeps the spark burning over time  
That womans got electric love  
  
Whoa yeah  
She gets me high so high  
Ooo yeah she makes the stars shine  
Burning all the time  
That womans got electric love  
  
Electric love  
Electric love  
Shes got the fire  
Shes got the fire  
Electric love  
Electric love  
Electric love
