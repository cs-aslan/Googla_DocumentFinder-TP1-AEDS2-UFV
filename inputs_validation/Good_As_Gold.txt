Dont know what Im doing here  
Ill carry on regardless  
Got enough money for one more beer  
Ill carry on regardless  
  
Good as gold but stupid as mud  
Hell carry on regardless  
Theyll bleed his heart til theres no more blood  
But carry on regardless  
  
Carry on with laugh  
Carry on with cry  
Carry on with brown under moonlit sky  
  
I want my love my joy my laugh my smile my needs  
Not in the star signs  
Or the palm that she reads  
I want my sundrenched windswept Ingrid Bergman kiss  
Not in the next life  
I want it in this  
I want it in this  
  
Got one note to last all week  
Ill carry on regardless  
The hill to happiness is far too steep  
Ill carry on regardless  
  
Dried his mouth in the Memphis sun  
He carried on regardless  
Tried to smile and he bit his tongue  
But carry on regardless  
  
Carry on with work  
Carry on with love  
Carry on with cheering  
Anything above  
  
I want my love my joy my laugh my smile my needs  
Not in the star signs  
Or the palm that she reads  
I want my sundrenched windswept Ingrid Bergman kiss  
Not in the next life  
I want it in this  
I want it in this  
  
I dont want silver I just want gold  
Carry on regardless  
Bronze is for the sick and the old  
But carry on regardless  
  
I want my love my joy my laugh my smile my needs  
Not in the star signs  
Or the palm that she reads  
I want my sundrenched windswept Ingrid Bergman kiss  
Not in the next life  
I want it in this  
I want it in this
