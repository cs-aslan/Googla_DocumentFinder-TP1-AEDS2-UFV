Doctor you aint got a pill  
For whatevers making this world Ill  
You cant get forgiveness at the store  
And peace its a politicians war  
You wont find no resolution in the bottom of a bottle  
In the stars or Aristotle  
The only answer to the problem is  
  
People loving people  
Thats the enemy of everything thats evil  
Aint no quick fix at the end of a needle  
Its just people loving people  
  
Words arent what they seem to be  
Talk is cheap and lies are free  
We fear what we dont understand  
And weve been scared since time began  
All the colors and the cultures  
Circle round us on a spindle  
Itd a complicated riddle  
But the solution is so simple  
  
Its people loving people  
Thats the enemy of everything thats evil  
Aint no quick fix at the end of a needle  
Its just people loving people  
  
You can pawn it off on kings and queens  
And those behind the curtain  
Say one cant make a difference  
In a world so full of hurting  
But I believe the remedy  
Starts right here with you and me  
  
People loving people  
Thats the enemy of everything thats evil  
Aint no quick fix at the end of a needle  
Its just people loving people  
Its just people loving people  
Its just people loving people
