Shock the monkey to life  
Shock the monkey to life  
  
Cover me when I run  
Cover me through the fire  
Something knocked me out the trees  
Now Im on my knees  
Cover me darling please  
Monkey monkey monkey  
Dont you know when youre going to shock the monkey  
  
Fox the fox  
Rat the rat  
You can ape the ape  
I know about that  
There is one thing you must be sure of  
I cant take any more  
Darling dont you monkey with the monkey  
Monkey monkey monkey  
Dont you know youre going to shock the monkey  
  
Wheels keep turning  
Somethings burning  
Dont like it but I guess Im learning  
  
Shock  watch the monkey get hurt monkey  
  
Cover me when I sleep  
Cover me when I breathe  
You throw your pearls before the swine  
Make the monkey blind  
Cover me darling please  
Monkey monkey monkey  
Dont you know youre going to shock the monkey  
  
Too much at stake  
Ground beneath me shake  
And the news is breaking  
  
Shock  watch the monkey get hurt monkey  
  
Shock the monkey  
Shock the monkey  
Shock the monkey to life
