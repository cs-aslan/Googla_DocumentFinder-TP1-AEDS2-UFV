Hey there little darling whered the old man go  
Why dont we get out of town and do it all night long  
We can lie out in the field til the morning light  
Then me and your old man are gonna have to fight  
Start the loving in the truck and wind up in the ditch  
And then the old man come arunnin with a hickory switch  
  
Oh no gotta learn this some day  
Why I have gotta learn the hard way  
Buddy showed me just how fast a car can go  
Ill race you for your pink slip right before this show  
Throw your girlfriend in the bet to make things good  
Cause shes been staring at me like no girlfriend should  
  
Bastards sitting right there on the starting line  
Stuck the sugar in your gas tank by myself last night  
Oh no gotta learn this some day  
Why I have gotta learn the hard way
