We explore the mens room  
We dont give a shit  
Ladies lost electricity  
Take vows inside of it  
  
Chorus  
Desire to dance  
Too startled to try  
Wrap my legs round you  
Starting to fly  
  
Lets explore  
Up there up there up there  
On the twentyfifth floor  
  
Circle all around me  
Coming for the kill kill kill  
Oh kill me baby  
Like a kamikaze  
Heading for a spill  
Oh but its all spilt milk to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Lets soar  
Up there up there up there  
On the twentyfifth floor

We do not eat  
Eat anything at all

Loves pretty  
Loves pretty cruel tonight  
Im waiting here to refuel

Love in my heart

order  
Pollution is a necessary result of the inability of man to reform and
transform waste  
The transformation of waste  
The transformation of waste  
The transformation of waste  
The transformation of waste is perhaps the oldest preoccupation of man  
Man being the chosen alloy he must be reconnected via shit at all cost  
Inherent within us is the dream of the task of the alchemist to create from
the clay of man  
And to recreate from excretion of man pure and then soft and then solid gold  
  
All must not be art  
Some art we must disintegrate  
Positive anarchy must exist  
  
I feel it swirling around me  
I feel it feeling no pain  
Im waiting above for you baby  
I know that Ill see you up there  
Im floating in a door backward  
On boundaries over this world  
Im waiting above in the sky dear
