An easy operator on the side of the road  
A million dollar man in a lowerclass home  
Chopping trees for needs of a spiritual kind  
Forever getting low while he tried to be high  
He was an early morning eagle flying through from the fire  
Barely getting over forget getting by  
But its all the same to Billy Kincade  
If he had to do it over he would do it the same  
  
He was living in the end  
He was living in the end  
  
Polly and her pity wasnt pretty at all  
She concentrated fully on the shine of the star  
But your pennies just a pension  
She never let go  
They always dominated everything that she owned  
She couldnt stop to see she didnt have the time  
How could she afford to pay attention to life  
Oh its all the same for Polly the Vain  
If she had to do it over she would do it the same  
  
She was living in the end  
She was living in the end  
  
Are you all right darling all right now  
Youll never be never be the same  
Are you all right darling all right now  
Dont you ever wanna ever wanna see some change  
  
You didnt see it coming  
Thats the tale of his life  
Easy operator laid to rest in the night  
He had to take the hit its always the same  
Thats the waste you see in killing Billy Kincade  
Thats the waste you see in killing Billy Kincade  
  
Repeat x3  
Are you all right darling all right now  
Dont you ever wanna ever wanna see some change  
  
They was living in the end  
Thats just living in the end
