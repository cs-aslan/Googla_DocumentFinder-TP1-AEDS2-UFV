Chorus  
The sunrise insists on gladness  
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead  
Oh sun I see you happy  
You made the morning dew  
Now youre showing me the truth  
I dont want to believe you  
  
Verse 1  
The night has the power  
To hold all your helplessness in  
Heaven  
The darkness and sadness  
Hold to each other til tomorrow  
  
Chorus  
The sunrise insists on gladness  
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead  
Oh sun I see you happy  
You made the morning dew  
Now youre showing me the truth  
I dont want to believe you  
  
Verse 2  
Death take me with you  
I dont wanna live without my flower  
Tomorrow tomorrow  
The time that it takes for love to effect a person  
So deep so deep  
So deep  
  
Outro  
Oh sun oh sun  
Oh sun oh sun  
Oh sun oh sun  
I see you happy  
Oh sun oh sun
