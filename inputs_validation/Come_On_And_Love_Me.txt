The night is hot and so am I  
Darling feel the heat between my thighs  
Youre a perfect angel sweet seventeen  
Moist and pink and hotter in between  
  
You touch me with that velvet touch  
Your body grips I cant get enough  
  
Chorus  
Come on love me  
Come on take me home  
Bring it back bring it back to life  
  
Give all your love to me girl  
Im Dave the lion roar till I die  
I kiss the girls and then make them cry  
With pleasure  
  
I taste your lips you drink my love  
Its a vintage year honey 69  
  
You touch me with that velvet touch  
Your body grips me I cant get enough  
  
Chorus
