Day into night shes with me  
How sweet is her warm embrace  
Safe in the scent of jasmine  
So safe in her gold and lace  
  
Mornings I find shes left me  
So cold so alone but aware  
I try to escape she finds me  
Oh run though I may shes there there there there there  
  
Luck is a lady whose smile is as cold as a stone  
Shell bring you things many things you might never have known  
But when your die is cast shell have the final laugh at you  
Shell lock you in a duel where you come out the fool  
  
Beware of the Queen of Spades  
Her black widows curse might find you yet  
Beware of a love that you will regret  
Her love means only your death  
  
Day into night shes with me  
Turn of a card shes there  
The first time is free you know  
But from now on pay me me me me me  
  
Beware of the Queen of Spades  
Her black widows curse might find you yet  
Beware of a love that you will regret  
Her love means only your death
