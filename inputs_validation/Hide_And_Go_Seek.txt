Oh baby lets play some hide and go seek  
Seen an alligator go jumpin in the river  
Singin a song about five ten fifteen twenty  
Twentyfive thirty thirtyfive fourty fourtyfive  
Fifty fiftyfive sixty sixtyfive seventy seventyfive  
Eighty eightyfive ninety ninetyfive a hundred  
I aint gonna count but one more time  
And thats gonna be when the sun goes down  
I say last night and the night before  
Twentyfour hours knock in on the door  
I ran upstairs to get my gun  
And when I got back the robbers had run  
Didnt go east didnt go west  
They must have run back to the robbers nest  
Oh Im gonna catch you this time honey  
  
I aint gonna count but one more time  
Im gonna get you sweetie pie  
Im gonna catch you yes Ill do  
Please dont let me search for you  
I say last night and the night before  
Twentyfour hours knockin on the door  
I ran upstairs to get my gun  
And when I got back the robbers had run  
Didnt go east didnt go west  
They must have run back to the robbers nest
