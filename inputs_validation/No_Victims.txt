kirsty maccoll  
I must have been driving all day  
But Im getting no further away  
All these towns look the same  
And the rain is falling in my eyes  
Take me away  
See all my friends for a day  
Its strange but its true  
Im no longer hurting without you  
Im no victim to pity and cry for  
And youre not someone Id lay down and die for  
I was seeing the world through your eyes  
There was not much left not to despise  
Its a shame but its true  
I started to feel things like you do  
But Im not tearing my heart out for you dear  
And when you wake up I wont even be here  
Sod all your funny little ways  
They dont make me laugh these days any more  
Im no victim to pity and cry for  
Or some sad lonely encounter the night before  
Im no victim to pity and cry for  
From some sad desperate collision the night before  
No Im not tearing my heart out for you dear  
And when you wake up Ill be miles away from here  
Baby I know
