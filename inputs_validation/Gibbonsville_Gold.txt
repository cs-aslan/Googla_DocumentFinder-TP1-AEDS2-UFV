My name is Bill Harlan Im a God fearin man  
From the lost rebel army a Tennessee Calvary man  
From Shilo to Nashville we made our last stand  
When the battles were over everythin we had was gone with the wind  
  
But I still had my family and a hope and a dream  
And I heard of gold fever and the Rocky Mountain streams  
So we took what we had and some gold diggin gear  
And we headed for a new life on the Northwest frontier  
  
Montana Territory where the winters are cold  
The lands full of game and the creeks are full of gold  
Just west of the mountains is a town they call Gibbonsville  
You can sure get gold fever you can damn sure get killed  
But I staked my claims I was rarin to go  
Ive made up my mind and I set out to find the Gibbonsville Dgold  
  
Chorus  
Oh you find just a little just enough to get by  
Aww you dig and you dig and you start wonderin why  
Theres a whole lot more down there I dont have to be told  
Ive made up my mind and Im gonna find that Gibbonsville gold  
  
Every morning at daylight with a pick and a pan  
Keep an eye out for the blackfeet Keep a rifle near hand  
Back shooters and grizzlies better stay alert all the time  
Cause the only law here in this wild country is the gun and the knife  
  
In the year of our Lord eighteen sixtynine  
I lost my dear son to a cavein at the mine  
Yes I know hes gone please God rest his soul  
So many have died trying to find this damned Gibbonsville gold  
  
Chorus  
Yeah you find just a little just enough to get by  
Aww you dig and you dig and you start wonderin why  
Then someone finds a nugget just as big as your thumb  
And we all go hard at it from sun until sun  
Yeah I got to find it that main mother load  
Ive made up my mind and I swear to find that Gibbonsville gold  
  
Theres a whole lot more down there my share of that main mother load  
Ive made up my mind and I swear to find the Gibbonsville gold  fade
