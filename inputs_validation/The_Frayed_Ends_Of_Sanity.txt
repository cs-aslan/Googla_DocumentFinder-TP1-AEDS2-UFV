Never hunger  
Never prosper  
I have fallen prey to failure  
Struggle within  
Triggered again  
Now the candle burns at both ends  
Twisting under schizophrenia  
Falling deep into dementia  
  
Old habits reappear  
Fighting the fear of fear  
Growing conspiracy  
Everyones after me  
Frayed ends of sanity  
Hear them calling  
Hear them calling me  
  
Birth of terror  
Death of much more  
Im the slave of fearmy captor  
Never warnings  
Spreading its wings  
As I wait for the horror she brings  
Loss of interestquestionwonder  
Waves of fear they pull me under  
  
Old habits reappear  
Fighting the fear of fear  
Growing conspiracy  
Everyones after me  
Frayed ends of sanity  
Hear them calling  
Hear them calling me  
  
Into run  
I am sinking  
Hostage of this nameless feeling  
Hell is set free  
Flooded Ill be  
Feel the undertow inside me  
Heighthelltimehasteterrortension  
Lifedeathwantwastemass depression  
  
Old habits reappear  
Fighting the fear of fear  
Growing conspiracy  
Myself is after me  
Frayed ends of sanity  
Hear them calling  
Frayed ends of sanity  
Hear them calling  
Hear them calling me
