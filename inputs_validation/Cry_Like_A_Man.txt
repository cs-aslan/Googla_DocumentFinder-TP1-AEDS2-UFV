Take a look around youhow much longer can you live  
This way  
Trash on the floor from weeks beforejust gets deeper  
By the day  
Cant let go of that foolish prideyou keep it locked up  
Inside  
Time to face the painstand up and cry like a man  
Theres no one left to blame nowshe had her reason why  
She had to go  
The feelings you hid the love you couldnt give kept  
Her from touchin your soul  
You got to break down that fortress inside and  
Surrender to the tears in your eyes  
Youll never be free again til you cry like a man  
  
Theres no shame in letting teardrops fall its a good  
Thing itll be alright  
A little rain can make the trees grow tallyouve got  
To be strong so stand up and cry like a man  
  
You know shes gone for good nowyour love is torn  
Beyond repair theres not a trace of a tear on your face  
There ought to be some there those deep emotions you  
Keep in the darkif you dont let them out there goin to  
Freeze up your heart youll never be free again til you  
Cry like a man So Stand Up and Cry Like a Man  
  
If you are playing with the recordings I have made  try  
Capo on 3rd or 4th fret
