Chorus  
Wake up in the morning go to work  
Fire up the truck and drive to Sonoma  
Hop on the forklift  
Fill up the truck with ten thousand pounds of newspaper  
Ten thousand pounds of racist trash and lies  
Drive the truck back to Santa Rosa put the newspaper in the recycle  
So the rich white man can print out the same batch of lies  
Again and again and again and again and again and again and again  
  
Its too bad the cops had to kill that man  
But he had a broomstick and he was Asian  
We know theyre all samurai warriors  
Theyre all kung fu masters  
Theyre all just like Jackie Chan  
Its too bad the cops had to restrain his wife  
Cause she was a registered nurse and she tried to save his life  
But that would go against rules and regulations  
To just forget at 2 at night  
Were so proud of our boys in blue  
Cause they always do whats right  
I saw Eileen today  
I saw her children play in the courtyard  
Lately it occurred to me  
How does a mama tell her children their dad got killed by the police  
  
Chorus  
  
Its too bad the cops had to kill that kid  
But someone called in a stolen walkman  
The cops they chased him down but he refused to lie face on the ground  
And he just walked away  
The cop said This punk cant walk away in the all black night  
So I had to shoot him in the back of the head  
From fifty feet away  
I had to kill him it was self defense  
I was afraid he would circle back around and kill me   
I saw Corneleus speak today at the Hayward High  
That other police stole his sons life away  
Over a walkman that wasnt that much more than change  
How does a father find justice for a son stolen away  
Stolen away  
Stolen away  
Stolen away  
Stolen away  
I dont want to hear your news cast anymore cause its bullshit  
I dont want to see your headlines anymore cause theyre bullshit  
I dont want to hear your press release anymore cause its bullshit  
I dont want to see your police report anymore cause its bullshit
