All weve ever owed each other for the time we spent together  
Was the right to know its over when its gone  
What it wasnt doesnt matter and it still dont feel no better  
Just to know who done who righteously or wrong  
  
Lord I wish that I could say I could see a single way  
That we could take it back to where it used to be  
Before the daylight broke to pieces everything I used to make believe  
  
And its never gonna be the same again Im sorry we cant even still be
friends  
Trusting you has left some wounds that time aint gonna mend  
And its a never gonna be the same again  
  
Its a shame to know its over and youre nothing but another  
Pretty thing that I dont do before I die  
But the saddest part of all is never knowin if youll ever even wonder why  
And its never gonna be the same  
Oh you cant never gonna be the same again
