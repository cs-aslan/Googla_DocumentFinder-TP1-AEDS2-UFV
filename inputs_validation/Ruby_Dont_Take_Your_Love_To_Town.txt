Youve painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair  
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere  
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down  
Oh Ruby  
Dont take your love to town  
It wasnt me that started this whole crazy Asian war  
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore  
Yes its true that Im not the man I used to be  
Oh Ruby  
I still need some company  
Its hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed  
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age Ruby I realize  
But it wont be long Ive heard them say until Im not around  
Oh Ruby  
Dont take your love to town  
Shes leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door  
The way I know Ive heard it slam 100 times before  
And if I could move Id get my gun and put her in the ground  
Oh Ruby  
Dont take your love to town  
Oh Ruby  
For God sakes turn around
