Danny says we gotta go  
Gotta go to Idaho  
But we cant go surfin  
Cause its twenty below  
  
Sound checks at 502  
Record stores and interviews  
Oh but I cant wait  
To be with you tomorrow  
  
Baby  
  
Ohohoho we got nowhere to go  
And it may sound funny but its true  
Hangin out in 100 B  
Watching Get Smart on TV  
Thinkin about  
You and me and you and me  
  
Hangin out in LA  
And theres nowhere to go  
It aint Christmas if there aint no snow  
Listening to Sheena on the radio  
Ohho ohho
