Dog eat dog  
Its dog eat dog Im just waking up  
The dove is in the dungeon  
And the whitewashed hawks pedal hate and call it love  
Dog eat dog  
Holy hope in the hands of  
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers  
And big wig financiers  
  
Dog eat dog  
On prime time crime the victim begs  
Money is the road to justice  
And power walks it on crooked legs  
Prime time crime  
Holy hope in the hands of  
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers  
And big wig financiers  
  
Where the wealths displayed  
Thieves and sycophants parade  
And where its made  
The slaves will be taken  
Some are treated well  
In these games of buy and sell  
And some like poor beast  
Are burdened down to breaking  
  
Dog eat dog  
Its dog eat dog aint it flim flam man  
Dog eat dog you can lie cheat skim scam  
Beatem any way you can  
Dog eat dog  
Youll do well in this land of  
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers  
You could get to be  
A big wig financier  
  
Land of snap decisions  
Land of short attention spans  
Nothing is savored  
Long enough to really understand  
In every culture in decline  
The watchful ones among the slaves  
Know all that is genuine will be  
Scorned and conned and cast away  
  
Dog eat dog  
People looking seeing nothing  
Dog eat dog  
People listening hearing nothing  
Dog eat dog  
People lusting loving nothing  
Dog eat dog  
People stroking touching nothing  
Dog eat dog  
Knowing nothing  
Dog eat dog
