Snowy night where its warm here by the fire  
Here with you I have all that I desire  
Here with you  
Its been a long year but somehow we got by  
Now its Christmas eve and love is on our side  
I dont need a hundred gifts beneath the tree  
Beneath the tree  
Dont you know the best thing you could give to me  
Nothin else will do all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas this Christmas  
Children sing Christmas carols at our door yeah yeah yeah  
Children sing  
Spreading joy thats what Christmas time is for  
Spreading joy  
Though we dont have much youve got me and Ive got you  
Yeah yeah yeah and with a little faith miracles come true  
And I dont need a hundred gifts beneath the tree  
Beneath the tree  
Dont you know the best thing you could give to me  
Nothin else will do all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas this Christmas  
I dont want the love of any other girl  
I want only one thing in this whole wide world  
Nothing else will do all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas this Christmas  
Cheek to cheek the lights are low a kiss beneath the mistletoe  
Your face lit by the fires glow thats all I want tonight  
And I dont need a hundred gifts beneath the tree  
Dont you know the best thing you could give to me  
Nothin else will do all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas this Christmas  
Nothin else will do all I want is you this Christmas yes
