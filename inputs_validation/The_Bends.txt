Where do we go from here  
The words are coming out all weird  
Where are you now when I need you  
Alone on an airplane  
Falling asleep against the window pain  
My blood will thicken  
  
I need to wash myself again  
To hide all the dirt and pain  
Cause Id be scared that theres nothing underneath  
And who are my real friends  
Have they all got the bends  
Am I really sinking this slow  
  
My babys got the bends oh no  
We dont have any real friends no no no  
  
Im just lying in a bar with my drip feed on  
Talking to my girlfriend  
Waiting for something to happen  
And I wish it was the 60s  
I wish I could be happy I wish I wish I wish  
That something would happen  
  
Where do we go from here  
The planet is all gummed up in a sea of fear  
And where are you  
  
They brought in the CIA  
The tanks and the whole marines to blow me away  
To blow me sky high  
  
Babys got the bends  
We dont have any real friends  
  
Im just lying in a bar with my drip feed on  
Talking to my girlfriend  
Waiting for something to happen  
And I wish it was the 60s  
I wish I could be happy I wish I wish I wish  
That something would  
  
I want to live and breathe  
I want to be part of the human race  
I want to live and breathe  
I want to be part of the human race race race  
  
Where do we go from here  
The words are coming out all weird  
Where are you now when I need you
