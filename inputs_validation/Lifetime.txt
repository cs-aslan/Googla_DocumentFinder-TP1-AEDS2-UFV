I cant let nothing come in between the two of us  
Cause its like your all I need  
Since we been together and  
Whenever Im in need of a little love  
Its OK for me to open up  
But I just cant give me heart to anyone cause  
  
Bridge  
Some only come in your life for a season  
And stay a while to give you a reason  
To take time to the very end  
And to think that its forever  
But youve given me someone that I  
Can believe in I know there will be times  
We cant come to an agreement  
But I know that well figure out the ups and down  
Tell me are you willing to take a chance Baby if so  
  
Chorus  
Here we go here we go  
Let me put you in my hand  
Cmon cmon  
I wanna be your man  
Lets do it right  
So that youll be with me a lifetime  
You know and I know  
Dont think that Im talking crazy  
Your mama and my mama want some grand babies tonight  
Would you be with me a lifetime  
  
I used to think that it was hopeless  
And that I should just give it up give it up  
But I couldnt stop until I found myself a good girl  
To be in love  
  
I checked every state and city  
And looked all around the world  
And Im proud to say that my search ends here  
Cause your one in a million to me and I cant let you go  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Listen season are truly meant to change  
However love can be the reason you fall  
But when you find that special someone  
Youd be willing to give them a lifetime I love you and I choose you  
Follow me  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus
