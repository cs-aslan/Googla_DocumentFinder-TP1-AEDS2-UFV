All you guitar players  
Scalding hot  
And Zekes going at it  
Givin it everything hes got  
Cause anything goes  
Whatever it takes  
I might pitch a fit  
But I wont put on my brakes  
  
Chorus  
Stand in the fire stand in the fire  
Stand in the fire stand in the fire stand in the fire  
Stand in the fire stand in the fire stand in the fire  
Stand in the fire stand in the fire stand in the fire  
  
I see a redheaded girl  
In the red silk dress  
Ya know Im asking her to dance with me  
She might say yes  
Feel the heat  
From the beat  
Dont it burn you too  
And all I want to do  
Is just Rock you  
  
Chorus  
  
Stand In the fire stand in the fire Repeat x 2
