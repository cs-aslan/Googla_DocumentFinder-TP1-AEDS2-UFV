Faithless love like a river flows  
Raindrops falling on a broken rose  
Down in some valley where nobody goes  
And the night blows in like the cold dark wind  
Faithless love like a river flows  
  
Faithless love where did I go wrong  
Was it telling stories in a heartbreak song  
Where nobodys right and nobody was wrong  
Faithless love will find you  
And the misery entwine you  
Faithless love where did I go wrong  
  
Well I guess Im standing in the hall of broken dreams  
Thats the way it sometimes goes  
Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems  
Its the feeling comes and goes  
  
Faithless love like a river flows  
Like raindrops falling on a broken rose  
Down in some valley where nobody goes  
Faithless love has found me  
Thrown its chilly arms around me  
Faithless love like a river flows
