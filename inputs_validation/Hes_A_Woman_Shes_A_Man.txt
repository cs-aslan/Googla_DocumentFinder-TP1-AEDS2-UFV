I saw it walkin lonely down the street  
Cool like the cat like crazy dream  
I looked twice again I cant believe  
It turned around right then  
And looked at me  
I said oh no it really couldnt be  
It was a man it was a woman too  
  
Hes a woman shes a man  
Hes a woman shes a woman  
  
I think it really came from far away  
Im feeling head uptight so I have to stay  
It takes my hand and says come on lets go  
Were goin home she asked me to stay  
He starts to move she starts to play  
I need a body why not you  
  
Hes a woman shes a man  
Hes a woman shes a woman
