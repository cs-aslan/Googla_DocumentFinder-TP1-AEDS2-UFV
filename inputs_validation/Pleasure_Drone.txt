Theres an abyss in your life  
Cause a good loves gone bad  
Youve lost someone for now and forever  
She was the best youve ever had  
Just let go its a hopeless endeavor  
Dont stick your head in the sand  
Dont you cry so much it doesnt help  
Not with her picture in your hand  
  
Just when you lose your smiling face  
Gonna bring you to a special place cause Im a  
  
Drone pleasure drone  
And I wipe your tears away  
Drone pleasure drone  
Im gonna make you a perfect day  
  
Im made for sensing your mood  
No reason for despair  
Can you hear mechanical noises  
When I buzz through the air  
  
To get you up Ill hand you presents  
From my telescoptic arm  
No matter theyre no hands  
But my claws wont do no harm  
  
And wherever theres bad vibes  
I will detect them with laser eyes cause Im a  
  
Drone pleasure drone  
And I wipe your tears away  
Drone pleasure drone  
Im gonna made you a perfect day  
  
Drone pleasure drone  
And I wipe your tears away  
Drone pleasure drone  
Im gonna make you a perfect day  
Drone pleasure drone
