When you look inside  
My magic lantern  
All the world is yet unseen  
Try to gaze into  
The yellow glowing  
To get a reflection of me  
In a land of make believe and magic  
You can be just anything you feel  
You think that what youre in is a dream  
But know that the lantern is viewing  
View the magic lantern  
Take a trip around the world  
View the magic lantern  
Theres a thousand  
Mysteries unfurled  
And I know one of them  
I remember your face  
Cant remember the place  
Here on our own  
Living alone  
You can dream that  
Youre a man of power  
Ready to be happy with your gold  
Without love your mind is going sour  
Moneys no good when youre old  
View the magic lantern  
You can have the sky above  
Yeah the magic lantern  
Youll buy everything but love  
Everything but love
