Wish I was an apple dangling from a tree  
Every time youd pass me by youd take a bite of me  
I wish I was a bluebird Id never fly away  
Id sit up on your shoulder baby and sing to you all day  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy Come on home to me  
  
I wrote it in a letter carved it on a tree  
Told it to a honeycomb told it to a bee  
Told them that I love you they all know its true  
Say it till the cows come home until it gets to you  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy Come on home to me  
  
Need you in the morning to start the coffee pot  
Need you in the afternoon to fan me when Im hot  
Need you in the evening when supper time is through  
What Im really tryin to say is I cant get enough of you  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy Come on home to me  
  
If I were a musician Id harp on just one thing  
You should never play my harp the way you pluck a string  
If only you would love me say it and tell me so  
I need two charms about me baby to have the whole world know  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy Come on home to me  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy Come on home to me
