Big man pig man  
Ha ha charade you are  
You well heeled big wheel  
Ha ha charade you are  
And when your hand is on your heart  
Youre nearly a good laugh  
Almost a joker  
With your head down in the pig bin  
Saying Keep on digging  
Pig stain on your fat chin  
What do you hope to find  
Down in the pig mine  
Youre nearly a laugh  
Youre nearly a laugh  
But youre really a cry  
  
Bus stop rat bag  
Ha ha charade you are  
You fucked up old hag  
Ha ha charade you are  
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass  
Youre nearly a good laugh  
Almost worth a quick grin  
You like the feel of steel  
Youre hot stuff with a hatpin  
And good fun with a hand gun  
Youre nearly a laugh  
Youre nearly a laugh  
But youre really a cry  
  
Hey you White House  
Ha ha charade you are  
You house proud town mouse  
Ha ha charade you are  
Youre trying to keep our feelings off the street  
Youre nearly a real treat  
All tight lips and cold feet  
And do you feel abused  
You got to stem the evil tide  
And keep it all on the inside  
Mary youre nearly a treat  
Mary youre nearly a treat  
But youre really a cry
