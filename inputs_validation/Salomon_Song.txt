You saw the wise man salomon  
You know what came of him  
To him the world seemed clear as day  
He cursed the sad hour that he saw the sign  
He knew that everything was dust  
How great and wise was salomon  
Watch out the world is spinning fast  
The night will fall the price well pay  
Such wisdoms not all its cracked up to be  
So let us praise such clarity  
You saw divine cleopatra  
You know what came of her  
Two emperors died to serve her lust  
She whored herself to death yes she did  
And withered into lovely dust  
How beautiful great babylon  
Watch out the world is spinning fast  
The night will fall the price well pay  
Such beautys not all its cracked up to be  
So let us praise such luxury  
Behold the man the bold macheath  
The ends in sight I fear  
If he had kept his pretty head  
And just robbed the rich but oh no instead  
Alls come to nought and turned to dust  
How sad the heart when it has won  
Watch out the world is spinning fast  
The night will fall the price well pay  
Such whorings not all its cracked up to be  
So let us praise sweet chastity  
Id like to introduce my friend my musical director and accompanist mr paul
