Time to live time to lie  
Time to laugh time to die  
  
Take it easy baby  
Take it as it comes  
Dont move too fast  
If you want your love to last  
Youve been moving much too fast  
  
Time to walk time to run  
Time to aim your arrows at the sun  
  
Go real slow  
Youll like it more and more  
Take it as it comes  
Specialize in having fun  
  
Moving much too fast  
Moving much too fast
