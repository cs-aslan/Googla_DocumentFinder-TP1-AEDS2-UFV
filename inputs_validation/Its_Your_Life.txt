They say that our love is all wrong  
And that we should not carry on  
But I say theyre wrong  
I want you so bad  
  
Oh weve been together for so long  
How could they think we dont belong   
But theyll never know what you and I have  
  
Call your mama  
Call your papa  
Call the preacher  
Hold on hold on  
  
Call your mama  
Call your papa  
Go on and call the preacher  
Hold on hold on  
  
All I want to do is take it all the way with you  
Its your life its your life  
All I want to do is take it all the way with you  
Its your life its your life its your life  
  
They say that we dont have a chance  
Were victims of unjust romance  
But they couldnt see the truth in their hands  
We dont have to live like they do  
  
Well run away if we have to  
And well start a life thats shining and new  
Thats shining and new  
  
Call your mama  
Call your papa  
Go on and call the preacher  
Hold on hold on  
  
Call your mama  
Call your papa  
Call the preacher  
Hold on hold on  
  
All I want to do is take it all the way with you  
Its your life its your life its your life  
Repeat until end
