I can always try to forget somehow  
Whats a part of the past  
Have a little laughter if you please  
I wont even mind if it takes awhile  
Ive got time on my hands  
I feel another chapter in the breeze  
And somebody touched my heart string  
Somebody made my heart sing  
And somebody stole my heart away  
Nobodys sayin their sorry  
Its a mighty sweet music  
You can dance all night  
Put some wood on the fire right now  
Ecstasy made easy  
Ecstasy I ask you are you a name  
Or just another patron with a smile  
Let me analyze you are you a flame  
Or just the dying embers of a kiss run wild  
Somebody found my heart string  
Somebody made my heart sing  
And somebody touched my heart last night  
Somebody set me in flight  
Its a mighty sweet music  
Take a chance they say  
Put flame on the old iron stove  
Ecstasy made easy  
Its a mighty sweet music  
Take a chance they say  
Put some fire on the old iron stove  
Ecstasy made easy made easy  
I hope I never lose what belongs to me  
By the right of my birth  
At midnight sailing out of Perth  
Getting under way we turned westward bound  
On that southern sea  
To sea what ecstasy was worth
