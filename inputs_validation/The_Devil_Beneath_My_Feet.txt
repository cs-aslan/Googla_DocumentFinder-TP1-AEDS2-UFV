Verse 1  
I dont want your God and your higher power  
I want power to get higher  
And Im not a liar and Im not a liar  
When you look up what do you see  
I dont need a motherfucker looking down on me  
Motherfucker looking down on me  
At least I know wherever I go  
Ive got the devil beneath my feet  
At least I know wherever I go  
Ive got the devil beneath my feet  
Beneath my feet  
  
Chorus  
Dont bring your black heart to bed  
When I wake up you best be God  
Or you better be dead  
  
Dont bring your black hearth to bed  
When I wake up you best be God  
Or you better be dead  
  
Verse 2  
This what happens when you put an apple on your head  
You can laugh all day but you cant laugh the darkness away  
Cant laugh the darkness away  
Too many pills and not enough kills  
I need the Bug House or the Big House  
Theyll never take me alive never take me alive  
Never fucking take me alive  
Its better to be blamed for robbing Peter  
Than guilty for paying Paul  
Its better to be blamed for robbing Peter  
Than guilty for paying Paul  
  
Chorus  
Dont bring your black heart to bed  
When I wake up you best be God  
Or you better be dead
