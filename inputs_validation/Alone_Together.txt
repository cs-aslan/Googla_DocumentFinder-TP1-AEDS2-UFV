I dont know where youre going  
But do you got room for one more troubled soul  
I dont know where Im going  
But I dont think Im coming home  
And I said Ill check in tomorrow if I dont wake up dead  
This is the road to ruin and were starting at the end  
  
Say yeah  
Lets be alone together  
We could stay young forever  
Scream it from the top of your lungs lungs lungs  
  
Say yeah  
Lets be alone together  
We can stay young forever  
Well stay young young young young young  
  
Uh uh uh uhoh

Cut me off I lost my track  
Its not my fault Im a maniac  
Its not funny anymore no its not  
  
My heart is like a stallion they love it more when its broken  
Do you wanna feel beautiful do you wanna yeah  
  
Im outside the door let me in  
So we can go back and play pretend  
Im on deck yeah Im up next  
Tonight Im high as a private jet  
  
Cause I dont know where youre going  
But do you got room for one more troubled soul  
I dont know where Im going but I dont think Im coming home  
And I said Ill check in tomorrow if I dont wake up dead  
This is the road to ruin and were starting at the end  
  
Say yeah  
Lets be alone together  
We could stay young forever  
Scream it from the top of your lungs lungs lungs  
  
Say yeah  
Lets be alone together  
We can stay young forever  
Well stay young young young young young
