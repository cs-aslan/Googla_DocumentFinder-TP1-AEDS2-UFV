On the lonely road Im travelling on  
The road that leads nowhere  
As the ground and the sky have been wondering why  
Im alone so alone  
  
Ive been rolling on for just two years  
The sun is my only friend  
With the wind on the bend and my back in my hand  
Im alone so alone  
Im alone so alone  
Im alone so alone  
Im alone so alone  
And I feel like going home  
  
With my money spent my clothes all torn  
My spirit hanging low  
I aint got no friends where the highway ends  
Im alone so alone  
Im alone so alone  
Im alone so alone  
Im alone so alone  
And I feel like going home  
Going home
