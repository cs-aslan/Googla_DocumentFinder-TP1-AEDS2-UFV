I hate myself for lovin you and the weakness that it showed  
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road  
The stage was set the lights went out all around the old hotel  
I hate myself for lovin you and Im glad the curtain fell  
  
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed  
And the mercy that you showed to me who ever would have guessed  
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within  
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin  
  
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped  
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped  
Like a slave in orbit hes beaten til hes tame  
All for a moments glory and its a dirty rotten shame  
  
There are those who worship loneliness Im not one of them  
In this age of fiberglass Im searching for a gem  
The crystal ball up on the wall hasnt shown me nothing yet  
Ive paid the price of solitude but at last Im out of debt  
  
Cant recall a useful thing you ever did for me  
Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees  
We stared into each others eyes til one of us would break  
No use to apologize what diffrence would it make  
  
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine  
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen  
Lady Luck who shines on me will tell you where Im at  
I hate myself for lovin you but I should get over that
