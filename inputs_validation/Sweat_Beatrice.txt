Hanging with my sweet amour  
She came out with a lions roar  
Yelling Im going to the corner store  
Be back at quarter to four  
Dont slam your pinkies in the drawer  
She can be like a maiden from the days of yore  
Hanging out at Studio 54  
Break dancing on the slick brick disco floor  
With Lionel Richie  
Who by the way was a Commodore  
One time she gave mouthtomouth to a snaggle tooth boar  
Who couldnt breat right since the Vietnam War  
Then she played Chinese Checkers with Skeletor  
And went camping with Eva Gabor  
Shes my sweet Beatrice  
Shes my sweet Beatrice  
Shes my sweet Beatrice  
And shes coming home  
I got a picture of her down by the seashore  
Wearing a bikini made of purple velour  
Her hairs up like Conway Twittys pompadour  
With the smile of Guy Lefleur  
She got the ups and downs like an elevator  
But deep inside shes a marshmellow smore  
Can bake a cake as big as Jupitor  
Either or Neithor nor  
Shell share it with your Labrador  
She can run faster than a blazing meteor  
Loves Winnie the Pooh and his friend Eeyore  
Can make a pipe out of an apple core  
Thats a trick she learned from Roberto Parrish  
Down in Ecuador  
You know why  
Shes my sweet Beatrice  
Shes my sweet Beatrice  
Shes my sweet Beatrice  
And shes coming home  
Well for sure she opened the door  
Whipped out a 3ft fishing lure  
Sexually that made me insecure  
Like the time I was a roadie  
On Elton Johns tour  
She said Lets go catch some Piscatore  
I said Beatrice you dont eat fish no more  
She said By God youre right  
So we took ourselves a snore  
And when we woke up 10 hours later  
We made Love Du Jour  
Shes my sweet Beatrice  
Shes my sweet Beatrice  
Shes my sweet Beatrice  
And she came home  
She likes to clean out the attic every now and then  
Shes gonna knit me a brand new golfing bag  
We gonna watch ourselves a John Wayne movie  
Then we gonna free all the doggies at the kennel  
She gonna try on my third grade mittens  
Shell keep em on even though theyre way too small  
Well she aint never gonna hurt me  
She aint never gonna let me down  
She aint never gonna tell nobody  
Im afraid of birds and spiders  
Well Beabeabeabeatrice  
Beabeabeabeatrice  
Beabeabeabeatrice  
Beabeabeabeatrice  
Beabeabeabeatrice  
Beabeabeabeatrice  
And she loves Pat Summerall
