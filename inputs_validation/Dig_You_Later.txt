Its always fair weather  
When hep cats get together  
And every time they meet  
Heres the way youll hear them greet greet  
A hubbahubbahubba Hello Dad  
  
Well a hubbahubbahubba I just got back  
Well a hubbahubbahubba lets shoot some breeze  
Say whatever happened to the Japanese  
Hmm a hubbahubbahubba havent you heard  
A hubbahubbahubba slip me the word  
  
I got it from a guy who was in the kno  
It was mighty smoky over Tokyo  
A friend of mine in a B29 dropped another load for luck  
As he flew away he was heard to say  
A hubbahubbahubba yuk yuk  
  
Well I gotta go fishin  
Thats ok well give you our permission and well say  
A hubbahubbahubba on your way  
And I will dig you later in the usa  
Ta dah dah dee dee dee ta dee dee ta dah dah hi hi hi tee dee dee

A hubbahubbahubba well give me some skin  
Well youre lookin mighty purdy Miss Curly Locks  
Im the grand old girly of the bobby socks  
Hmm yuttata yuttata yuttaton you talk big  
Well Im the fresh tomata you cant dig  
Lets have a heart to hearta and youll decide  
Im a chick whats really on the solid side  
  
You knock me flat youre the kind of a cat  
Makes me wanta blow my top  till the end of time     Aaaaah  
  
And if you feel that way tell me what you say  
A hubbahubbahubba muk muk  
  
Well now youre really talkin youre no square  
You cant be from Weehawken   
Hmm hmm Delaware  
  
You got a line of jive thats really zoo  
Well Ill dig you later baby youre all root  
  
Youre the kind of cat wears a sharp cravat  
And you really know your stuff  
  
If you feel that way tell me what you say  
A hubbahubbahubba ruff ruff  
  
A getta long a little mousy with the great big eyes  
Well if youre lookin for a spousey  
Why youre just my size  
  
Mister how you love to blubber  
With that knock out squawk  
Seems your lips are made of rubber  
Every time you talk  
  
Oh no no no hubbahubba  
  
Yes yes yes hubbahubba

A what you kno A what you kno  
A what you say A what you say  
I say Ill dig you later baby in the usa
