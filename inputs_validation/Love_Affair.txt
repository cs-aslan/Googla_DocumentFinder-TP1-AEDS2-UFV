Here in the moment I belong  
In a waking dream  
The night is young  
But isnt long  
If you know what I mean  
Oh its beautiful  
The thought of what might be  
Close your eyes so you can see  
  
I am only here for a little while  
Would you like to take me out to night  
Maybe we could talk for a little while baby  
  
Now weve only just begun  
Were running out of time  
I dont want to think about the sun  
No not to night  
Oh its wonderful you being here with me  
Close your eyes so you can see  
  
I am only here for a little while  
Would you like to take me out to night  
Maybe we could talk for a little while baby  
Dont hold back its time for a love affair  
Take my hand lead me to anywhere  
Maybe theres something in the air baby  
  
Together here together now  
In the moment that we met  
Remember here remember now  
Its to EZ to for get  
  
Oh its wonderful you being here with me  
Close your eyes so you can see  
  
I am only here for a little while  
Would you like to take me out to night  
Maybe we could talk for a little while baby  
Dont hold back its time for a love affair  
Take my hand lead me to anywhere  
Maybe theres something in the air baby
