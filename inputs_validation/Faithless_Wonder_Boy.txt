Ive had these jeans since i was born  
And now theyre ripped and now theyre torn  
And all my friends have skateboards  
  
I want the toys of other boys  
I want a knife and a gun and things  
But mom and dad will not give in  
  
And i cant put the needle in  
Cant put the needle in  
I cant put the needle in  
No I cant put the needle in  
Cant put the needle in  
Cant put the needle in  
  
And now I know just what it is  
Its called disease and its got my head  
It always runs where I hide  
  
Too scared too talk too scared to try  
Too scared to know the reasons why  
And all my friends say bye bye  
  
And i cant put the needle in  
Cant put the needle in  
Cant put the needle in  
No I cant put the needle in  
Cant put the needle in  
Cant put the needle in  
  
And i cant put the needle in  
Cant put the needle in  
Cant put the needle in  
No I cant put the needle in  
Cant put the needle in  
Cant put the needle in
