Hallelujah Gods been talking to ya  
You can be what youre meant to be  
But only by following Jesus  
The kingdom come now  
The devil is on the run now  
And you can live for eternity  
But only by following Jesus  
  
Know where youre heading  
Cause it gets so upsetting  
When your friends let you down  
And there aint no love around  
Look straight ahead now  
And learn what Jesus said  
He would never forsake you  
  
The time is short now  
Youve got to give him a good report now  
And start living accordingly  
Its getting hard now  
You gotta start in your own backyard now  
But it will be coming more easily  
But only by following Jesus  
  
Know where youre heading  
Cause therell be no regretting  
When you walk in that place  
And see the glory on his face  
Look straight ahead now  
Remember what Jesus said  
How he would come back for you  
  
The world is dying  
And youve been getting so tired of trying  
But youll be finding a remedy  
Only by following Jesus  
The time is coming  
When those on earth will be hiding and running  
From the Lamb of Eternity  
Cause they werent following Jesus  
No no they werent following Jesus  
No no they werent following they werent following  
They werent following Jesus  
Hallelujah the Lord of Heavens been talking to ya
