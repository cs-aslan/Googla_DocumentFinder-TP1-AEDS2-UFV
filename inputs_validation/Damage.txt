I woke up with a war in my head  
An old mans grumble  
And an extra space in the bed  
And if ol John Prine cant sing the next line  
  
Bout something that can make me smile  
Gonna have be content  
To stare at your baby photos til it makes some sense  
And were you ever mine anyway  
  
Speak up as I drop away  
I wrote down what I think on the head of a matchstick  
Wrote it all short and sweet all that made sense to me  
Burnt six thousand minds sorry for all times  
  
I just cant add up the sums to find the damage weve done  
I fell for you like a dog from a tree  
Keep a straight stitched face  
As the ground makes a bed for me  
  
I keep my eye where I fell sends no replies  
You can run so long from sadness  
That youre never at home for the fun  
I cant make excuses  
  
For the short hand abuses  
Thank God it aint a Sunday night  
I wrote down what I think on the head of a matchstick  
Wrote it all short and sweet all that made sense to me  
  
Burnt six thousand minds sorry for all times  
I just cant add up the sums to find the damage weve done  
I wrote down what I think on the head of a matchstick  
Wrote it all short and sweet all that made sense to me  
  
Burning out in the lights sorry for all times  
I just cant see how it comes  
  
The damage weve done  
The damage weve done  
The damage weve done
