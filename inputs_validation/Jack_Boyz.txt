Chorus  
Im fucked up  
You fucked up  
Selling Niggers wheres your stash  
You just blew your luck  
Jack boys on your ass put your chain on top  
I aint talking about a name but my  
Im fucked up  
You fucked up  
Telling Niggers wheres your stash  
You just blew your luck  
Jack boys on your ass put your chain on top  
I aint talking about a name but my  
  
For big Gucci OJ  
I put the cross on  
For now it comes the thunderstorm  
Couple Niggers down to murder for a couple strikes  
Brick squad brick squad everything is brick squad  
Seein a bitch nigga dead make my dick hard  
Is only one word I cant take is the fear  
Im dying for my Niggers  
My Niggers die for me  
Like a midget to a train aint no stopping me  
No  
Im writing for my Niggers  
My Niggers write for me  
Im my brothers that we got is real  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Im not the bad Niggers or the biggest one  
But if you beat us son  
I get a bigger gun  
I walk a lot of jewels  
And plus a lot of tools  
I make a lot of shops  
I make some mortal soup  
Its such a beautiful day  
To put my diamonds on display  
Black and yellow diamonds catchin sun rays on a sunday  
Youre a man or a mouse  
Hes a fucking mouse
