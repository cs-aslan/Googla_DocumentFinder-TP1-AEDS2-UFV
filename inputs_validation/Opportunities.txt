He made the news today for the first time on page three  
Left the local supermarket job in sale and figures  
Makes a treat each week tomorrow sits at home  
Hed be such a lovely boy if hed only leave the girls alone  
You could see it in his face  
Each time he ran away  
  
It was a bababababa big opportunity  
Bathroom porcelain and handles made of brass  
Took the proper grooming and full year language class  
Theyre sure hes the guy to snatch them from this scene  
and take them to some place theyre sure their mothers never been  
You could see it in his face  
As the colour drained away  
  
It was a bababababa big opportunity  
A bababababa big opportunity  
A bababababa big opportunity  
Cold evenings create a living room dance  
Spend late nights revolving around one lost chance  
Oh yeah  
  
Theyre gonna jump the train its the last one today  
Join us in the back row of the ones that got away  
Join a big parade it works for you and me  
And youll add a thrill because youll hear it on TV  
Throw it up against the wall  
Just to see how far it falls  
cause its a bababababa big opportunity  
A bababababa big opportunity  
A bababababa big opportunity
