Well me and my buddies are goin to a party tonight  
And we dont care if we aint got no invite  
We dont care if our face dont fit  
Gonna grab a little whiskey grab a little

Get yourself ready for a real bash  
Hide your ladiescause well be talkin trash  
Snort your cocaine smoke your grass  
So get yourself ready for our gatecrash  
  
You dont really want to know but were still going to appear  
Weve got Elvis snarls and arrive in biker gear  
We dont care if you call the fuzz  
By the time they get there well be gone with a buzz

Get yourself ready for a real bash

Snort your cocaine smoke your grass  
So get yourself ready for our gatecrash
