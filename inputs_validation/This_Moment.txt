Can you tell me  
Who called the race  
Can anyone stay in one place  
And when you get to the finish line  
Will you wish for more time or say  
  
One day  
One day you will  
But maybe one day you will find  
That you just cant push rewind  
  
All we have is this moment  
Tomorrows unspoken  
Yesterday is history  
So why dont you be here with me  
  
All we have is this moment  
To put our love into motion  
Yesterday is history  
So why dont you be here with me  
Be here with me now  
  
Do you ever think that  
Were just chasing our tails  
Like life is one big fast treadmill  
And we pop what is prescribed  
If it gets us first prize but you know  
Who I  
Who I think will win  
Are the ones that love loving  
Are the ones that take the time  
  
All we have is this moment  
Tomorrows unspoken  
Yesterday is history  
So why dont you be here with me  
  
All we have is this moment  
To put our love into motion  
Yesterday is history  
So why dont you be here with me  
Be here with me now  
Be here with me now  
  
Cause refuge check is right now right in front on you  
Dont let the clock the clock tell you what to do  
If you check right now Im in front of you  
Baby dont blink and miss  
  
This moment  
Tomorrows unspoken  
Yesterday is history  
So why dont you be here with me  
  
All we have is this moment  
To put our love into motion  
Yesterday is history  
So why dont you be here with me yeah  
Be here with me now
