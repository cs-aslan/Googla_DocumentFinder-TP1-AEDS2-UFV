Would you know my name  
  
If I saw you in heaven  
Would it be the same  
If I saw you in heaven  
I must be strong and carry on  
Cause I know  
I dont belong here in heaven  
  
Would you hold my hand  
If I saw you in heaven  
Could you help me stand  
If I saw you in heaven  
  
Ill find my way  
Through night and day  
Cause I know  
I just cant stay  
Here in heaven  
In my heart Ill remember  
And forever youll stay  
  
Time can bring you down  
Time can bend your knees  
Time can break your heart  
I keep begging please  
Begging please  
  
Would you know my name  
If I saw you in heaven  
Would it be the same  
If I saw you in heaven  
Beyond the dawn  
Theres peace Im sure  
And I know therell be no more  
Tears in heaven  
Forever I will Stay  
Till we both meet someday
