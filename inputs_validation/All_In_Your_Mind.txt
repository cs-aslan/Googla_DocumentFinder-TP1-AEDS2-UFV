Come closer  
You seem so far away  
Theres something I know you need to say  
I feel your emotions  
  
When I look in your eyes  
Your silence  
Whispering misunderstandings  
Theres so much you need to realize  
Youll feel my emotions if you look in my eyes  
  
Chorus  
Hey darlin  
I know you think my love is slipping away  
But baby its all in your mind  
Dont worry  
  
Hold on tight and hear me when I say  
Baby its all in your mind  
  
Believe me I believe in you  
Theres nothing this feeling couldnt do  
Move closer my darling  
Feel the love in my eyes  
  
Chorus  
  
I know you feel my love  
In your mind yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby its all in your mind  
Baby its all in your mind  
Baby its all in your mind  
Got to let you know baby  
  
Baby its all in your mind  
You know my love is good now baby yeah  
Baby its all in your mind  
Baby its all in your mind  
  
Yeah darling  
Baby its all in your mind  
Baby its all in your mind Repeat until fade
