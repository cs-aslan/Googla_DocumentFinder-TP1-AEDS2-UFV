Youre a polished diamond  
Now youre feeling kinda rough  
Yes I know how long youve been searching  
For the perfect touch  
You better hear what I say  
I can tell your eyes are just about to  
give you away  
  
Cause theres the girl that you were after  
Feel your heart beating faster now  
Theres the girl you were after  
Can you say that you dont want her anymore  
  
Just take my word now  
Cause you know its true  
she aint good enough  
for the likes of you  
You better hear what I say  
I can tell your eyes are just about to  
give you away  
  
Cause theres the girl you were after  
Feel your heart beating faster now  
Theres the girl that you were after  
And all this time you cant get past her  
Theres the girl you were after  
Broken glass complete disaster  
Theres the girl you were after  
Can you say that you dont want her anymore  
  
I believed you once  
When you explained  
That it wasnt so tough  
To forget her name  
  
Cause theres the girl that you were after  
Feel your heart beating faster now  
Theres the girl that you were after  
And all the time you cant get past her  
Theres the girl that you were after  
Broken glass complete disaster  
Theres the girl that you were after  
Can you say that you dont want her anymore  
  
Theres the girl  
Theres the girl  
Theres the girl  
Theres the girl can you say that you dont want her anymore
