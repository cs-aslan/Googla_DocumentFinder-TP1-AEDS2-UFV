Hey hey Mr Government Man  
Im just a poor boy doin the best that I can  
Ive been stepped upon and pushed around yes I have  
You can tie me up but never tie me down  
  
Well I was drivin around tryin to find a place  
To get a beer and some cigarettes  
Pullin up behind me not afraid to flirt  
Theres a girl in a red Corvette  
  
I saw in her face that she wanted to race  
So I let my car out of jail  
Man I blew it before I knew it  
The Feds were on my tail  
  
I knew it were trouble but didnt wanna stop  
I couldnt forget that girl  
My dashboard slick from alcohol  
And my head still in a whirl  
  
Just a country boy in the city lights  
Tryin to have some fun  
But the Man behind me didnt wanna play  
He pulled out a gun  
  
Hey hey Mr Government Man  
  
Well I had it comin I hit the wall  
And my car went up in flames  
My head got hammered thrown in the slammer  
No one but me to blame  
  
Thats my story aint much glory  
But I know I paid my dues  
One thing I know in my heart and soul  
I aint never gonna lose  
  
Hey hey Mr Government Man  
  
They say I might be goin crazy  
Hey what else can I do  
Hey my my  
  
Hey hey Mr Government Man  
  
Hey hey Mr Government Man  
Dont you push me around no more
