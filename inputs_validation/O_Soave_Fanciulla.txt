La bohemeOh sweet little lady  
  
  
RODOLFO  
O soave fanciulla o dolce viso  
Di mite circonfuso alba lunar  
In te ravviso il sogno  
Chio vorrei sempre sognar  
  
MIMI  
Ah tu sol comandi amor  
Fremon nellanima dolcezze estreme  
Ecc Nel baccio freme amor  
oh come dolci scendono le sue  
Lusinghe al corTu sol comandi amor  
No per pieta Sei mia Vaspettan gli amici  
Gia mi mandi via Vorrei dirma non osso  
Di Se venissi con voi Che Mimi  
Sarebbe cosi dolce restar qui Ce freddo fuoriv  
Vi staro vicina E al ritorno Curioso  
Dammi il braccio o mia piccina  
Obbedisco signor Che mamidilo tamo  
  
RODOLFO e MIMI

RODOLFO  
Oh sweet little lady Oh sweetest vision  
With moonlight bathing your pretty face  
The dream that I see in you is the dream Ill always dream  
  
MIMI  
Oh you rule alone Love  
Deep in my soul trembles the deepest of passions etc  
Our kisses shudder with love  
How gently now his words of praise make their way  
Into my heartYou rule alone oh love  
No I beg you Youre mine now Your friends are still waiting  
So soon must I leave you I would likeI cant say it  
Speak What if I went along What Mimi  
How sweet instead to stay behind here Its freezing outside  
Id be right beside you What about later Who knows sir  
Take my arm my dear young ladyAs you say my dear sir  
Do you love me say I certainly do
