You dont love me this I know  
Dont need a bible to tell me so  
I hung around a little too long  
I was good but now Im gone  
  
Like the buffalo  
That boy from Tupelo  
Any way the wind can blow  
Thats where Im gonna go  
Ill be gone like a five and dime  
Itll be the perfect crime  
Just ask the boy from Tupelo  
Hes the king and he oughta know  
  
The shoulder Ive been leanin on  
Is the coldest place Ive ever known  
Theres nothin left for me round here  
Looks like its time to disappear  
  
Like the buffalo  
That boy from Tupelo  
The old wall down in Jericho  
Maybelle on the radio  
Ill be gone like the five and dime  
Itll be the perfect crime  
Just ask the boy from Tupelo  
Hes the king and he oughta know  
  
You dont love me this I know  
Dont need a bible to tell me so  
Its a shame and its a sin  
Everything I coulda been to you  
  
Your last chance Texaco  
Your sweetheart of the rodeo  
A Juliet to your romeo  
The border you cross into Mexico  
Ill never understand why or how  
Oh but baby its too late now  
Just ask the boy from Tupelo  
Hes the king and he oughta know
