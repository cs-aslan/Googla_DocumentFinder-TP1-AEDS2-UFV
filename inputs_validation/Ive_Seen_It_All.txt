Ive seen it all I have seen the trees  
Ive seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze  
Ive seen a friend killed by a friend  
And lives that were over before they were spent  
Ive seen what I was  I know what Ill be  
Ive seen it all  there is no more to see  
You havent seen elephants kings or Peru  
Im happy to say I had better to do  
What about China Have you seen the Great Wall  
All walls are great if the roof doesnt fall  
  
And the man you will marry  
The home you will share  
To be honest I really dont care  
  
Youve never been to Niagara Falls  
I have seen water its water thats all  
The Eiffel Tower the Empire State  
My pulse was as high on my very first date  
Your grandsons hand as he plays with your hair  
To be honest I really dont care  
  
Ive seen it all Ive seen the dark  
Ive seen the brightness in one little spark  
Ive seen what I chose and Ive seen what I need  
And that is enough to want more would be greed  
Ive seen what I was and I know what Ill be  
Ive seen it all  there is no more to see  
  
Youve seen it all and all you have seen  
You can always review on your own little screen  
The light and the dark the big and the small  
Just keep in mind  you need no more at all  
Youve seen what you were and know what youll be  
Youve seen it all  there is no more to see
