Dont look so sad I know its over  
But life goes on and this ol world will keep on turning  
Lets just be glad we had some time to spend together  
Theres no need to watch the bridges that were burning  
  
Lay your head upon my pillow  
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine  
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window  
And make believe you love me one more time  
For the good times  
  
Ill get along youll find another  
And Ill be here if you should find you ever need me  
Dont say a word about tomorrow or forever  
Therell be time enough for sadness when you leave me  
  
Lay your head upon my pillow  
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine  
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window  
And make believe you love me one more time  
For the good times  
  
For the good times
