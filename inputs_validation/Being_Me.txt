So what am I supposed to do  
Here I am Im losing you  
And this is more than I can take  
And as you walk away baby all that I can say  
Is Im sorry for being me  
  
I wont have to look into your eyes anymore  
Its alright they dont look at me the same  
With all that Ive lost I give everything and more  
If you want my love speak  
  
So what am I supposed to do  
Here I am Im losing you  
And this is more than I can take  
And as you walk away baby all that I can say  
Is Im sorry for being me  
Yes Im sorry for being me
