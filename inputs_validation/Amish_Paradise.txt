As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain  
I take a look at my wife and realize shes very plain  
But thats just perfect for an Amish like me  
You know I shun fancy things like electricity  
At 430 in the morning Im milkin cows  
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows fool  
And Ive been milkin and plowin so long that  
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone  
Im a man of the land Im into discipline  
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin  
But if I finish all of my chores and you finish thine  
Then tonight were gonna party like its 1699  
We been spending most our lives  
Living in an Amish paradise  
Ive churned butter once or twice  
Living in an Amish paradise  
Its hard work and sacrifice  
Living in an Amish paradise  
We sell quilts at a discount price  
Living in an Amish paradise  
  
A local boy kicked me in the butt last week  
I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek  
I really dont care in fact I wish him well  
Cause Ill be laughing my head off when hes burning in Hell  
But I aint never punched a tourist even if he deserved it  
An Amish with a tude  
You know thats unheard of  
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat  
And my homies agree  
I really look good in black fool  
If you come to visit youll be bored to tears  
We havent even paid the phone bill in 300 years  
But we aint really quaint so please dont point and stare  
Were just technologically impaired  
  
Theres no phone no lights no motorcar  
Not a single luxury  
Like Robinson Caruso  
Its as primitive as can be  
  
We been spending most our lives  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
Were just plain and simple guys  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
Theres no time for sin and vice  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
We dont fight we all play nice  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
  
Hitchin up the buggy churnin lots of butter  
Raised a barn on Monday soon Ill raise anutter  
Think youre really righteous  
Think youre pure in heart  
Well I know Im a million time as humble as thou art  
Im the pious guy the little Amlettes want to be like  
On my knees day and night scorin points for the afterlife  
So dont be vain and dont be whiny  
Or else my brother I might have to get medieval on your heinie  
  
We been spending most our lives  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
Were all crazy Mennonites  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
Theres no cops or traffic lights  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
But youd probably think it bites  
Living in an Amish Paradise  
  
Ahhahhahhahhahhahh  
ahhahhahhahhahhahhyecch
