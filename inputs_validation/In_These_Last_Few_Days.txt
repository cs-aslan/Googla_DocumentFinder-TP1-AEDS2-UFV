In these last few days youve been on my mind  
An we should get together an talk about old times  
An put the past behind us before life slips away  
Ive been thinkin bout you in these last few days  
In these last few days I have felt my age  
I wish that I was younger but time has turned the page  
I sure miss the water and the rhythm of the waves  
Ive been feelin fragile in these last few days  
But I have been a father a husband and a son  
Lookin back is bitter sweet now that my race has run  
Ive tried to be a witness from the cradle to the grave  
Time has felt so precious in these last few days  
In these last few days Ive seen the light  
And Ill be waitin for you on the other side  
My old friend I love you thats really all theres left to say  
Lay down here beside me in these last few days  
My old friend Ill miss you but Im trying to be brave  
Lay down here beside me in these last few days
