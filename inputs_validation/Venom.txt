Hell yeah  
The scent of Zenith clogs the midnight air  
You look around to see yourself and stare  
Hot knives you know youre not alone  
The thunder burst your mind and cracks your bones  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M yeah  
This is our hell and thats the way we live  
Your eyes transfixed by a deadly riff  
There aint no doorway to Satans mind  
He takes your soul and leaves your shell behind  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
Jeff Mantas on lead guitar  
The sins of man dictate eternity  
We are the sons of Satan we the three  
The final gift of Hades is Satan band  
And now the future lies in his beloved hand  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
Drag you to Hell
