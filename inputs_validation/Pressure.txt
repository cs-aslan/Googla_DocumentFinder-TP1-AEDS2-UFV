Why cant you admit  
Youve done of whats youve told  
Like the dog waiting for the bone  
You greed cant you just tell the truth  
You did what you have to  
And so you decided to sold me out for the money  
  
Tonight youll suffer  
Of what pressure you made me go trough  
So this time the revenge will be mine  
And Ill give it all back to you  
  
Close your eyes and count to the ten  
This wont take a long just a few seconds left ahead  
It doesnt hurt so much either Ill promise it  
From all my heart why would I lie to you my friend  
  
The pain you made the pressure you gave  
I held it all inside of me til I past  
Now I shall salute you the assassin of 2012  
Are you clapping your hands together thats what I assume  
  
Tonight youll suffer with the endless pain  
Dying while dreaming of my forgiveness  
So this time I feel like I win  
  
You should just left me on my own  
And take those steps back before you told  
That you can be trusted but seems like you dont  
  
Tonight youll suffer  
Of what pressure you made me go trough  
So this time the revenge will be mine  
And Ill give it all back to you  
  
Tonight youll suffer  
Of what pressure you made me go trough  
So this time doesnt it hurt and yeah I love you
