And so there comes a time  
We must both make up our minds  
Is our angel singing true  
Is it me is it you   
  
I just got to know it now  
Rode somewhere some place somehow  
Is our love as deep as blue  
Is it me is it you   
Is it me is it you   
  
Im lost in your love  
Dont think I ever stopped  
I got the feeling thats the reason why  
And the questions loud and clear  
  
Should we stay or should we bend  
It just gets deeper in the end  
I know you want to know it too  
Is it me is it you   
Is it me is it you
