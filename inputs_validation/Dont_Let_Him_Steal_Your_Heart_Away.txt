You were lonely and you needed a friend  
And he was there at the right time with the right smile  
Just a shoulder to lean on  
Someone to tell you itll all work out alright  
  
Dont let him steal your heart away  
No dont let him steal your heart away  
Dont let him steal your heart away  
No dont let him steal your heart away  
  
You can look at him the way you did me  
And hold him close say youre never letting go  
But any fool can see youre fooling yourself  
But you aint fooling me  
  
So dont let him steal your heart away  
No dont let him steal your heart away  
  
And dont pack my suitcase Ill be back  
And dont take my pictures off a the wall  
Oh did you hear me  
Dont let him change a thing cause Ill be back  
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life  
And just give me one more chance  
Ill show you Im right Im right  
  
Cause Ive been thinking and I know it was me leaving you lonely  
But hoping you could be strong  
But could you look at me straight  
Tell me what else can I do but say I was wrong  
  
So dont let him steal your heart away  
No dont let him steal your heart away  
  
Well hes gonna try to make it work for you  
Make you think your whole lifes been leading to this  
But whatever you do  
Think about me and dont be fooled by his kiss  
  
And dont let him steal your heart away  
Please dont let him steal your heart away  
  
And dont pack my suitcase Ill be back  
And dont take my pictures off a your wall  
Oh did you hear me  
Dont let him change a thing cause Ill be back  
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life  
And just give me one more chance  
Ill show you Im right  
You know Im right  
  
You were lonely and you needed a friend  
And he was there at the right time with the right smile  
Just a shoulder to lean on  
Someone to say dont you worry itll all be alright  
But hes no good for you  
Hell make you think your whole lifes been leading to this  
And whatever you do  
Think about me oh and dont be fooled by his kiss
