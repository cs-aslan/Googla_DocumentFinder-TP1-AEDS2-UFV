Well by now you know Im insatiable  
Cause when you step to leave I want a full repeat yeah  
Its a miracle you were right inside my head  
If the feelings nice why not do it twice  
It is not against the law no baby  
I slave all through the week  
And I need my release  
I work hard so when I stop  
I gotta get a little satisfaction for me  
Hit it again  
Dont care if Im late  
The world just has to wait  
Hit it again hit it again baby  
Hit it again  
I loved it the first time  
Sent chills up through my spine  
Hit it again hit it again baby  
Deep emotion aint got nothing to do with it  
And being in love aint really got a thing to do with it  
I hope you understand  
But I cant worry if you dont oh no  
If I cant double up  
Its like I didnt get enough  
Call me greedy if you want just do it  
But its something that will never change  
I dont get no complaints  
They know it when they ring my bell  
That this could be a thing that could take a little while well well  
Hit it again  
Dont care if Im late  
The world just has to wait  
Hit it again hit it again baby  
Hit it again  
I loved it the first time  
Sent chills up through my spine  
Hit it again hit it again baby  
I declare the point to be  
Once is not enough for me  
Two time lovin makes me smile  
One time love just aint my style  
Repeat the love and I have found  
More the second time around  
It builds me up I love to love  
And if I cant hit it again  
It aint natural  
Hit it again  
Dont care if Im late  
The world just has to wait  
Hit it again hit it again baby  
Hit it again  
I loved it the first time  
Sent chills up through my spine  
Hit it again hit it again baby
