The long and winding road  
That leads to your door  
Will never disappear  
Ive seen that road before  
  
It always leads me here  
Lead to your door  
  
Cause the wild and windy night  
That the rain washed away  
Had left a pool of tears  
Crying for the day  
  
Why keep me waiting here  
Let me know the way  
Show me the way  
Show me the way  
  
Many times Ive been alone  
And many times Ive cried  
Anyway anyway youll never know  
The many ways Ive tried  
  
Still they lead me back  
To the long and winding road  
Winding road  
  
You left me standing here darlin  
Yes that was long time ago  
And   
And I   
  
Wantin and wantin  
To keep me waitin here  
Lead me to your door  
Lead me to your door  
  
You ought to take me home with you  
Tonight baby  
Take me home yeah  
Amen
