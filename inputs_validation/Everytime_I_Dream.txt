Every time I dream I keep seeing  
Streets and alleyways places that Ive never known  
Every time I dream I am being  
Lifted to a height that I too frightened to go  
  
Then I wake up and find everythings away it seems one night ago  
Every time I sleep I keep hoping  
This would be the night of nights that I see you again  
As I close my eyes like rims and curtains slowly rising on an empty stage  
Then Im back in the stall sitting all alone waiting for the show to begin  
Oh oh  
  
Every time I dream I would often find myself running  
From a wild pack of lice  
Till I reach a house and hear the gurge upstairs  
And look for a place to hide  
But if I saw you there  
I wouldnt dare dream again of opening my eyes
