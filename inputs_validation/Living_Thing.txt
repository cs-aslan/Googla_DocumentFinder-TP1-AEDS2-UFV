Elo  
  
Sailin away on the crest of a wave  
Its like magic  
Rollin and ridin and slippin and slidin  
Its magic  
  
Chorus  
And you and your sweet desire  
You took me ooh woah higher and higher baby  
Its a livin thing  
Its a terrible thing to lose  
Its a given thing  
What a terrible thing to lose  
  
Making believe this is what you conceived  
From your worst day Im thinking of dying  
Moving in line then you look back in time  
To the first day Im thinking Im thinking  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Takin a dive cause you cant halt the slide  
Floating downstream Im thinking of dying  
So let her go dont start spoiling the show  
Its a bad dream Im thinking Im thinking  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Its a livin thing  
Its a terrible thing to lose  
Its a terrible thing to lose  
What a terrible thing to lose
