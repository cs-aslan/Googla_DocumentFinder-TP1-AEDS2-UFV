Like a hurricane or Texas tornado  
It came rollin out of Memphis  
Like a hurricane or a Texas tornado

And they called us rockabillies  
Long before they called it rock n roll  
We took a little country music  
Put some pop in and dressed it up in soul  
We took a little country music  
Put some pop in and dressed it up in soul
