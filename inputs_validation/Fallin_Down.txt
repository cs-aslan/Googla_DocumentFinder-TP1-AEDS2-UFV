Sometimes I dont wanna wake up alone  
But sometimes I wanna wake up and be on my own  
Sometimes I dont wanna walk by and smile  
But at the same time I dont wanna let people down  
  
Can you imagine the weight of a world  
Placed on your shoulders trapped in this world  
And noone can reach you ooo ooo ooo  
So noone can help you nowwwww  
  
Its getting heavy I think Im bout ready to break down  
Im standing up but Im fallin down  
Time keeps on tickin on I wish there was a way to slow it down  
Someone pick me up cause Im fallin down  
Im fallin down down down down  
Down down down down  
Im fallin down down down down  
Down down down down  
  
Why is it so easy for you to blame  
Im only human were all the same  
Ive given up everything in exchange for being alone  
Im shaking these demons underneath all the pride ohhhhhhhh  
  
Can you imagine the weight of a world
