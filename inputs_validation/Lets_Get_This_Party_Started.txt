The man is crying  
Take me to a different place  
Which you dont often find  
I see a family walking always thinking of being somewhere else in time  
So I fall face down in a rut I cant seem to get out of  
Please wake me  
Please give me some of it back  
The feelings I had  
Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you it doesnt matter  
Each time I wake Im somehow feeling the truth I cant handle  
  
Chorus  
Lets get this party started  
Im sick of begging you  
You make me feel insane  
Which I did to you  
Lets get this party started  
You make me feel insane  
I want to be the one  
To make my self sane  
  
Time is ticking  
It makes me feel content  
With what I have inside  
Constant paranoia  
Surrounds me  
Everyone I see  
Is out to get me  
So I fall face down in a rut I cant seem to get out of  
Please wake me  
Please give me some of it back  
The feelings I had  
Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you  
It doesnt matter  
Each time I wake Im somehow feeling the truth  
I cant handle  
  
Chorus  
  
You make me feel insane  
You make me feel insane  
You make me feel insane  
You make me fell insane  
You make me fell insaaaaaannnnnneeee  
Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you  
It doesnt matter  
Each time I wake Im somehow feeling the truth  
I Cant handle  
  
Chorus
