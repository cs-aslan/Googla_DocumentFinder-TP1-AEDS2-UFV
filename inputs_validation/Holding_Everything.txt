My heart beats wild and deep  
Every thought in my mind has your name on it  
Hard to breathe I cant speak  
Think of your love and just how much I want it  
  
Chorus  
When Im touching you I feel a sudden change  
When Im kissing you I taste the sun and rain  
When I look at you I hear the angels sing  
And when Im holding you Im holding everything  
  
Everything thats mine to give  
Everything I can do Ill do to prove it  
For as long for as long  
As I may live as I may live  
My love will be there for you to use it  
  
Chorus  
  
Everything Im holding everything  
When Im touching you Im touching everything  
When Im kissing you Im kissing everything  
Everything everything uh huh  
  
My heart beats wild and deep  
Every thought in my mind has your name on it  
Its hard to breathe its hard to breathe  
And I cant speak I cant speak  
Think of your love and just how bad I want it  
  
And when youre touching me I feel a sudden change  
When youre kissing me I taste the sun and rain  
And when I look at you I hear the angels sing  
  
Youre everything everything  
Im holding everything everything  
Everything youre everything  
Youre everything everything to me  
Everything everything  
Youre everything
