Were going east our work has ceased  
Were all set for Yale to say the least  
Were out to win so lets begin now  
Were from the west well never rest  
Till we show our world our teams the best  
Well sweep the land well show em and how  
The Texas tornado is coming your way so everybody step aside  
The Texas tornado is funny that way so everybody better hide  
This devastatin gale is headed straight for Yale  
Wont it be great to sail into town  
Well devour the foe well knock em for a goal  
And then well score a touchdown  
Theres no one in Texas who really suspects us  
Coming home without that game  
The whole state of Texas sincerely expects us  
Getting in the hall of fame  
Yales pigskin sack is the crackerjack  
But well bring it home without fail  
The Texas tornado is coming your way  
So everybody step aside better hide Yale
