Remember Rio and get down  
Like some other DJ in some other town  
Shes been trying to tell me to hold tight  
But Ive been waiting this whole night  
  
But Ive been down across the road or two  
But now Ive found the velvet sun  
That shines on me and you  
  
In the back uh huh I cant crack  
Were on top  
Its just a shimmy and a shake uh huh  
I cant fake were on top  
Were on top  
  
The day is breaking were still here  
Your bodys shaking and its clear  
You really need it so let go  
And let me feed it but you know  
  
That Ive been down across the road or two  
But now Ive found the velvet sun  
That shines on me and you  
  
In the back uh huh I cant crack  
Were on top  
Its just a shimmy and a shake uh huh  
I cant fake were on top  
Were on top  
We bring the bump to the grind uh huh  
I dont mind were on top  
Its just a shimmy and a shack uh huh  
I cant fake were on top  
Were on top  
  
And we dont mean to satisfy tonight  
So get your eyes off my bride tonight  
Cause I dont need to satisfy tonight  
  
Its like a cigarette in the mouth  
Or a handshake in the doorway  
I look at you and smile because Im fine  
  
And we dont mean to satisfy tonight  
So get your eyes off my bride tonight  
Cause I dont need to satisfy tonight  
  
Its like a cigarette in the mouth  
Or a handshake in the doorway  
I look at you and smile because Im fine
