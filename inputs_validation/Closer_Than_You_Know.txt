I tempered the storm  
Though your faith was small  
I prayed while you slept  
And the night waged war  
We stood at the fire  
And we walked on sea  
And we drank of the wine  
That was made of me  
  
Chorus  
Dont turn your eyes from me  
For my love wont be undone  
Dont hide your face from me  
For my light has surely come  
Surely come surely come  
  
I carried that cross  
And I felt your pain  
I took up your crown  
And I wore your shame  
And death was a fire  
And its teeth were grim  
But I left it behind  
Along with all your sins  
  
Chorus 2  
Dont turn away from me  
For my love wont be undone  
Dont hide your face from me  
For my light has surely come  
Surely come surely come  
  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Heaven is closer than you know  
Lift up your voice and sing  
Know that My love wont let you go  
And I wont forsake you  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Heaven is closer than you know  
Know Ill never leave you  
  
So lift up your voice and sing  
Know that My love wont let you go  
And My light has surely come  
Surely come surely come  
  
And Im closer than you know  
And Im closer than you know  
  
Bridge  
Lord I hear you I know Youre there  
Closer now than my skin and bones could bare  
Breathing deep within me  
You are always with me  
I can see you where eyes cant stare  
Brighter now than the sun could ever dare  
Breathing all around me  
God I know youre with me here  
God I know that you are here  
  
For I am yours and you are mine  
And my soul knows well  
You are here  
You are here  
And my soul will praise you  
And my soul will praise Your name  
Singing Holy is your name  
Jesus  
Jesus
