Driving home I saw her on the street  
Her dress so tight yeah she looked so neat  
All the boys as they were passing by  
They tried to catch that little girls eye  
I said to myself dont it seem like a crime  
To think that little girl used to be mine  
They call her little sinner little sinner  
Cause they can see shes got the devil in her  
Little sinner call her little sinner  
Theres nothin that I wouldnt do  
To have a little sinner like you  
Its comin back to me the times we had  
How could something so good ever get so bad  
Yeah me and Jimmy we got drunk that night  
God knows baby I didnt do you right  
They say you havent loved until youve lost  
Ill get you back no matter what the cost  
They call her little sinner little sinner  
Wild wild days and wild wild nights  
I stood up for you baby and you were worth the fight  
Didnt care about tomorrow  
Cheap red wine we couldnt get much higher  
So reckless and young full of lust and desire  
How could I waste it I want you so bad I can taste it  
Hey dont it seem like a crime  
To think she used to be mine
