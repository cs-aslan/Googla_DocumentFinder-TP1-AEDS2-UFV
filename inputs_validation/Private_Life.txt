Your private life drama baby leave me out  
repeat 3 times  
Jai les glands with your theatrics  
Your actings a drag  
Its ok on TV cause you can turn it off  
But dont try me  
Yes your marriage is a tragedy  
But its not my concern  
Im very superficial I hate anything official  
  
Chorus  
Your private life drama baby leave me out  
repeat 3 times  
backup chorus  
Youve been lying to someone and now me  
Stop  
repeat 3 times  
  
Your sentimental gestures only bore me to death  
Youve made a desperate appeal now save your breath  
Attachment to obligation through guilt and regret  
Shit thats so wet  
And your sex life complications are not my fascinations  
  
Chorus  
  
You asked me for advice I said use the door  
But youre still clinging to somebody you deplore  
And now you want to use me for emotional blackmail  
I just feel pity when you lie contempt when you cry  
  
Chorus
