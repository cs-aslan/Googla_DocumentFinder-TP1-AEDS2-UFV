Over the mountain take me across the sky  
Something in my vision something deep inside  
Where did I wander where dya think I wandered to  
Ive seen lifes magic astral plane I travel through  
  
Chorus  
I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now  
I told them I had ridden shooting stars  
And I said Id show them how  
  
Over and over always tried to get away  
Living in a daydream only place I had to stay  
Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide  
People around me talking to the walls inside  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont need no astrology its inside of you and me  
You dont need a ticket to fly with meIm free  
  
Over and under in between the ups and downs  
Mind on a carpet magic ride goes round and round  
Over the mountain kissing silver inlaid clouds  
Watching my body disappear into the crowd  
  
Dont need no astrology its inside of you and me  
You dont need a ticket to fly with me Im free
