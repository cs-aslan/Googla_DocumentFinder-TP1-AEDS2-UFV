To get up the bond for an inner west flat  
Hed work for anybody if he wasnt working for her dad  
She practicing saying I do or I will  
Cause she dont know how to tell him that shes going off the pill  
  
Her curtains are for certain that hell talk about her ass  
But she clings to his photo like a piece of broken glass  
We cant get it together today  
Shes looking for his heart while he stares the other way  
  
Hes dad is a nut hes exgirl is a slut  
But hell be yours forever if you just get it together  
If we cant get it together if we cant get it together  
Is it ever gonna be just you and me  
  
So they met on Tuesday at the town hall steps  
To get an eight by ten photo and a wedding date set  
We might as well do it next week  
Cause weve met everybody that were ever gonna meet  
  
Hes dad is a nut hes exgirl is a slut  
But hell be yours forever if you just get it together  
If we cant get it together if we cant get it together  
Is it ever gonna be just you and me  
  
Four seventy to Circular Quay  
A present in your pocket for the TAB  
  
If we cant get it together if we cant get it together  
Is it ever gonna be just you and me  
  
Would you settle for a mobile home  
A good record store and a public phone  
  
If we cant get it together if we cant get it together
