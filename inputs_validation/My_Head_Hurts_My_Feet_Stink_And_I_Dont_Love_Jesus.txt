Chorus  
My head hurts my feet stink and I dont love Jesus  
Its that kind of mornin  
Really was that kind of night  
Tryin to tell myself that my  
Condition is improvin and if I dont  
Die by Thursday Ill be roarin Friday night  
  
Went down to the snake pit  
To drink a little beer  
Listened to the juke box  
Oh its comin in clear  
All of a sudden I wasnt alone  
Pickin country music with old Joe Bones  
Duval Street was rockin  
My eyes they started poppin  
Because there she sat at the corner of the bar  
As I broke another string on my old guitar  
Someone call a cab  
Lady wont you pay my tab  
  
Chorus  
  
Got to get a little orange juice  
And a Darvon for my head  
I cant spend all day  
Baby layin in bed  
Im goin down to Faustos  
To get some chocolate milk  
Cant spend my life in your sheets of silk  
Ive got to find my way  
Crawl out and greet the day  
  
Chorus
