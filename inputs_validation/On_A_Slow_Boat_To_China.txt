Hey nice piano playin Manilla  
Thank you Miss M  
Whatcha doin these days  
Makin records  
  
Really  
Yes really  
Do you still play piano for people  
Well depends on who  
  
Hmm Im gonna get you  
On a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
  
Get you and keep you  
In my arms evermore  
Leave all the others  
Waitin on a faraway shore  
  
Out on the briny  
Where the moons  
Big and shiny  
Meltin your heart of stone  
  
Im gonna get you  
On a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone  
  
Bette I didnt know  
You felt that way about me  
I dont I need a piano player  
Ah just like the old days  
Youre not gonna change keys  
On me are yah Uh huh oh  
  
Im gonna get you  
Youre never gonna get me  
On a slow boat to China  
Not in a fast or slow boat at any crick  
All to myself alone  
I just get motion sick  
  
Im gonna make you mine  
Ha youll have to stand in line  
Get you and keep you  
In my band evermore  
Now theres a new attack  
  
Leave all the others on the shore  
For me theyd swim to China  
To China and back  
  
Out on the briny  
I wouldnt like the ocean  
Where the moons big and shiny  
Not even in a rowboat  
  
Melting your heart of stone  
Come on what do yah say  
You always get your way  
  
Im gonna get you  
On a slow boat to China  
All to myself alone together  
All to myself alone
