We say I love you and were so sincere  
I look in your eyes and it becomes quite clear  
You want what I want you need what I need  
When I turn to leave  
You plead and plead and plead and plead and plead  
Were so sincere  
Were so sincere  
Were so sincere  
Were so sincere  
  
Now Im sure Im right and Im so sincere  
You convince me Im wrong with a single tear  
You want me so badly you cant live without me  
When I turn to leave  
You bleed and bleed and bleed and plead and plead  
  
Were so sincere  
Were so sincere  
Were so sincere  
Were so sincere  
  
Were livin so fast were not living at all  
Two sparrows tied together will always fall  
We know we love each other so theres nothin to prove  
But Im gonna smother if somebody dont move  
  
Were so sincere  
Were so sincere  
Were so sincere  
Were so sincere
