Im not a cry baby  
Im the cry baby  
A caterpillar that got stuck  
Mr Moth come quick with any luck  
A long walk to a dark house  
A Roman candle heart keep us far apart  
Ive got your body doing alright  
Hate me baby maybe Im a piece of art  
  
Oh my friends all lie and say  
They only want the best wishes for me  
Oh three two one  
We go live  
  
Chorus  
Oh baby youre a classic  
Like a little black dress  
Youre a faded moon  
Stuck on a little hot mess little hot mess  
Whoa whoa  
And oh baby youre a classic  
Like a little black dress  
But youll be faded soon  
Stuck on a little hot mess little hot mess  
Whoa whoa  
  
I can make your heart slow  
I can feel the weather in my bones  
Wish hard enough I can turn it to what I like  
Your pupils theyre big  
Theyre rolling like dice  
They say they only want the best wishes for me  
They only want the best for me  
Oh three two one  
We go live  
  
Chorus  
  
Not the boy I was  
The boy I am is just venting venting  
Dear gravity you held me down in this starless city  
Dear gravity you held me down in this starless city  
  
Not the boy I was  
The boy I am is just venting venting  
Dear gravity you held me down in this starless city  
Dear gravity you held me down in this starless city  
  
They say they only want the best wishes for me  
They only want the best for me  
Oh three two one  
We go live  
  
Chorus  
  
Whoa whoa
