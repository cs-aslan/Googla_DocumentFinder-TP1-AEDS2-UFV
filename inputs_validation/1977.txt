In 1977 I hope I go to heaven  
Cause I been too long on the dole  
And I cant work at all  
  
Danger stranger  
You better paint your face  
No Elvis Beatles or the Rolling Stones  
In 1977  
  
In 1977  
Knives in West Eleven  
Lent so lucky to be rich  
Sten guns in Knightsbridge  
  
Danger stranger  
You better paint your face  
No Elvis Beatles or the Rolling Stones  
In 1977  
  
In 1977  
Youre on the never never  
You think it cant go on forever  
But the papers say its better  
I dont care cause Im not all there  
No Elvis Beatles or the Rolling Stones  
  
In 1977  
Sod the jubilee  
In 1978  
In 1979  
Stayed in bed  
In 1980  
In 1981  
The toilet dont work  
In 1982  
In 1983  
Here come the police  
In 1984
