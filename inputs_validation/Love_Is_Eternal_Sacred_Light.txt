Love is eternal sacred light  
Free from the shackles of time  
Evil is darkness sight without sight  
A demon that feeds on the mind  
  
Howd it all begin Started with a bang  
Couple of light years later stars and planets sang  
Fire warmed the cold waves of colors flew  
Moonlight into gold earth to green and blue  
  
Love is eternal sacred light  
Free from the shackles of time  
Evil is darkness sight without sight  
A demon that feeds on the mind  
  
Earth becomes a farm  
Farmer takes a wife  
Wife becomes a river and the giver of life  
Man becomes machine  
Oil runs down his face  
Machine becomes a man with a bomb in the marketplace  
Bomb in the marketplace bomb in the marketplace  
  
Love is eternal sacred light  
Free from the shackles of time  
Evil is darkness sight without sight  
A demon that feeds on the mind  
  
Big Bang  
Thats a joke that I made up  
Once when I had eons to kill  
You know most folks  
They dont get when Im joking  
Well maybe someday they will  
  
Love me  
Love me  
Thats the main request I receive  
Well you know I love all my children  
And it tears me up when I leave  
  
But sometimes you gotta fly down that highway  
Free as a bird knock on wood thank the Lord  
I am driving along in my automobile  
Its a brand new preowned 96 Ford  
  
Check out the radio pop music station  
That dont sound like my music to me  
Talk show host whats that boys name  
Politics is ugly  
  
At the end of the dial theres the gospel show  
Maybe now I can exit and rest  
Theres a blizzard rolling down off the banks of Lake Michigan  
Gonna cover the roads of the icy Midwest  
  
Love is eternal sacred light  
Free from the shackles of time  
Evil is darkness sight without sight  
A demon that feeds all the mind  
Love is eternal sacred light  
Love is eternal sacred light  
Love is eternal sacred light
