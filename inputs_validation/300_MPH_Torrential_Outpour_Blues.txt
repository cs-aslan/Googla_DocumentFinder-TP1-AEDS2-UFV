Im bringing back ghosts that are no longer there  
Im gettin hard on myself sittin in my easy chair  
Well theres three people in the mirror and Im wonderin which one of them
I should choose  
Well I cant keep from laughin spittin out these 300 mile per hour outpour
blues  
  
Im breakin my teeth off tryin to bite my lip  
Theres all kinds of redheaded women that I aint supposed to kiss  
And its that color which never fails to turn me blue  
So I just swallow it and hold on to it and use it to scare the hell out of
you  
  
I have a woman says come and watch me bleed  
And Im wonderin just how I can do that and still give her everything that
she needs  
Well theres three people in my head that have the answer and one of thems
got to be you  
But youre holding tight to it  the answer  
Singin these three hundred mile per hour outpour blues  
  
Put on gloves a tied scarf and wrap up warm on this winter night  
Every time you get defensive youre just looking for a fight  
Its safe to sing somebody out theres got a problem with almost anything
youll do  
Well next time they stab you dont fight back just play the victim instead of
playin the fool  
  
And the roads are covered with a million little molecules  
Of cigarette ashes and the school floors are covered with pieces of pencil
eraser too  
Well sooner or later the grounds gonna be holdin all of my ashes too  
But I cant help but wonder if after Im gone will I still have these three
hundred mile per  
Hour fingerbreaking noanswersmakin battereddirtyhands beestung and
bustedup  
Emptycup torrential outpour blues  
  
One things for sure in that graveyard Im gonna have the shiniest pair of
shoes
