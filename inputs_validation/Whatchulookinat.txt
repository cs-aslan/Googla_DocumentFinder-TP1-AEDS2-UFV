Oh you know youre wrong  
Dont want to respect my song  
But its okay cause either way  
My following is real strong  
You try so hard to show the whole world what I do  
Now Im turning the cameras back on you  
Same spotlight that once gave me fame  
Trying to dirty up Whitneys name  
  
Never thought  
Never thought Never thought Never thought  
Never knew  
Never knew that you would do this to me  
Do this to me  
Try to ruin me Try to ruin me  
Be my enemy Be my enemy

Why you lookin at me  
  
Chorus 2x  
Messing with my reputation  
Aint even got no education  
Trying to mess with my concentration  
Dont even have a clue of what Im facing  
All you know you need to stop it  
Defaming my name for a profit  
God is the reason my soul is free  
And I dont need you looking at me  
  
Chorus 2x
