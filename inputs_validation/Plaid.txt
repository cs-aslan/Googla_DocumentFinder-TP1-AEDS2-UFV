Some will say its too late  
So dont change the story  
Theres too much at stake to grow  
Yesterday was so great  
Just bask in the glory  
Dont let your feelings show  
  
And I say  
Oh Yeah like a man with condition  
I wait for my heart to stop  
Stay down  
Got a plan hold that position  
You cant afford a flop  
  
Pack my suitcase  
With my game face  
Take the same place  
And put away the dreams I had  
Let my hair grow  
Find some old clothes  
Let the world know  
That my glory days were plaid  
  
Chorus  
Im not asking for permission  
Are you ready for me to be me  
Just pass the ammunition  
This prisoners about to bust free from chains  
  
For so long you told me to keep it familiar  
Just play what they all would find  
I can wear this blindfold stick to your story  
But I gotta ask myself why  
And I play those songs  
For so many seasons  
Till Im sure Im losing my mind  
And I say Oh no  
Gotta have a much better reason  
To leave all my dreams behind  
  
Strangers  
Rearrange us  
Stay the same fate  
And become your favorite fad  
With the seethrough  
I gotta be true  
I cant be you  
While Yes still comes in plaid  
  
Chorus  
  
Im more than just excited  
Like a hundred pounds of monkey on my back  
Now everybodys divided  
Were riding this train till we run clear out of track  
Clean of track  
  
Chorus
