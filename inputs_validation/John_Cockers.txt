Chorus  
I dont accommodate nobody  
I just take care of myself  
Gotta house down on a dusty road  
I dont need nobody else  
I gotta wife and some kids  
I dont know where theyre at  
I know many many people  
But I aint got no friends  
  
Well I used to have some values  
Now they just make me laugh  
I used to think things would work out fine  
But they never did do that  
All these bosses and the rules  
Its hard for me to fit in  
Must be ten million people  
But I aint got no friends  
  
Well Im a little isolated  
I live most days in my head  
And when I go to sleep at night  
I got no sheets on my bed  
Im a little hard headed  
I cant wait for this to end  
I see people coming and going  
But I aint a got no friends  
  
Well I look out of my window  
Into the darkness of night  
My head gets to spinning  
So I shut out the light  
I dont care if I see tomorrow  
If I had a reason Id pretend  
I know one thing for certain  
I aint a got no friends  
  
Well one of these days my anger  
Get the best of my soul  
In one desperate moment  
Im gonna dig me a hole  
Im gonna lie down in it  
And let be what will be  
When the morning sun rises  
Therell be no one to mourn for me  
  
When the morning sun rises  
Therell be no one to mourn for me  
  
Chorus
