I feel a little shaky I cant control my nerves  
I know you think Im fakin but cant you feel the curves  
I swear to you I feel it it scares me half to death  
It gathers in my throat and it gathers up my breath  
  
Anxiety  Got me on the run  
Anxiety  Yeah I just need someone  
Anxiety  Cant get nothin done  
Anxiety  Spoils all the fun  
  
Im picking up the telephone theres no one I can call  
I need somebody bad tonight cant find no sleep at all  
I wish I could relax I just cant stop my mind  
I wish I could collapse but my bodys not that kind  
  
Anxiety  Got me on the run  
Anxiety  Yeah I just need someone  
Anxiety  Cant get nothin done  
Anxiety  Spoils all the fun  
  
Cant you hear my heartbeat hear the way it sounds  
Cant you hear my heartbeat Y hear the way it pounds  
Just give me somethin to slow it down Yeah  
  
Sometimes in the city sometimes in my car  
I pound on the windows like a bee inside a jar  
  
Anxiety  Got me on the run  
Anxiety  Yeah I just need someone  
Anxiety  Cant get nothin done  
Anxiety  Spoils all the fun  
  
Anxiety  Got me on the run  
Anxiety  Yeah I just need someone  
Anxiety  Cant get nothin done
