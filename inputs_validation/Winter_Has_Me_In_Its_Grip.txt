Winter has me in its grip  
Think Ill take a summer trip  
On a sunny sailing ship  
Where the shells lie in the sand  
  
I feel so lonely  
Im to young to feel this old  
I need you and you only  
When the weather gets this cold Thats why  
  
Winter has me in its grip  
Think Ill take a summer trip  
On a sunny sailing ship  
Where the shells lie in the sand  
  
Theres no use in going  
Cause its cold inside my heart  
And its always snowing  
Since the day we broke apart  
  
Winter has me in its grip  
Think Ill take a summer trip  
On a sunny sailing ship  
Where the shells lie in the sand  
  
I tried to run from winter  
Like this spring and summer run to fall  
But when the weathers in you  
Theres no hiding place at all thats why  
  
Winter has me in its grip  
Think Ill take a summer trip  
On a sunny sailing ship  
Where the shells lie in the sand
