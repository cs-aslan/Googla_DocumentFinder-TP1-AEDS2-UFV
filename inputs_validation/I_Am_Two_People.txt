I love you  
Its murder  
  
I am two people  
One you know  
But dont like  
The other one  
You dont know  
But you dont want to  
  
I am two people  
One you know  
But dont like  
The other one  
You dont know  
But you dont want to  
  
I love you  
Its pointless  
In my soul  
If I live or die  
This life  
  
I am two people  
One you know  
But dont like  
The other one  
You dont know  
But you dont want to  
  
I have two faces  
One of which you know  
The other one  
For your sake  
I never would show  
  
Its just because I love you  
I cannot bear to be around you  
And if only one or the other  
Of us would drop down dead  
  
I am I am
