I can feel sorry for my friends they must be tired  
Of all the fuss that Ive been making  
But since last night Im feeling so inspired  
Its like a dream and Im not waking  
If they could hear you whisper theyd agree  
Its more than a love song its a symphony  
  
It was that good it was that right  
That chance you get once in your life  
The answer to the prayer my hearts been praying  
It was that real it was that strong  
That feeling just cant be wrong  
Id go on forever if I could  
It was that good  
  
Suddenly Im saying things Ive never heard  
My soul is doing all the talking  
If it was ordinary you wouldnt hear a word  
Id keep it to myself and just keep walking  
  
But its no secret what youve done to me  
Theres no doubt in my mind girl I believe  
The more I think about it  
Dont know how I lived without it  
Its given new life to me to know you agree
