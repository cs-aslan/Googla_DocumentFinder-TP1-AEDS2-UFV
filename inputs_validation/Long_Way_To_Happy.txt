One night to you  
Lasted six weeks for me  
Just a bitter little pill now  
Just to try to go to sleep  
No more waking up to innocence  
Say hello to hesitance  
To everyone I meet  
Thanks to you years ago  
I guess Ill never know  
What love means to me but oh  
Ill keep on rolling down this road  
But Ive got a bad bad feeling  
  
Its gonna take a long time to love  
Its gonna take a lot to hold on  
Its gonna be a long way to happy yeah  
Left in the pieces that you broke me into  
Torn apart but now Ive got to  
Keep on rolling like a stone  
Cause its gonna be a long long way to happy  
  
Left my childhood behind  
In a roll away bed  
Everything was so damn simple  
Now Im losing my headlosing my head  
Trying to cover up the damage  
And pad out all the bruises  
Too young to know I had it  
So it didnt hurt to lose it didnt hurt to lose it  
Didnt hurt to lose it didmt hurt to lose it  
No but oh  
Ill keep on rolling down this road  
But Ive got a bad bad feeling  
  
Its gonna take a long time to love  
Its gonna take a lot to hold on  
Its gonna be a long way to happy yeah  
Left in the pieces that you broke me into  
Torn apart but now Ive got to  
Keep on rolling like a stone  
Cause its gonna be a long long way  
  
Now Im numb as hell and I cant feel a thing  
But dont worry about regret or guilt cause I never knew your name  
I just want to thank you  
Thank you  
From the bottem of my heart  
For all the sleepless nights  
And for tearing me apart yeah yeah  
  
Its gonna take a long time to love  
Its gonna take a lot to hold on  
Its gonna be a long way to happy yeah  
Left in the pieces that you broke me into  
Torn apart but now Ive got to  
Keep on rolling like a stone  
Cause its gonna be a long long way  
  
Its gonna take a long time to love  
Its gonna take a lot to hold on  
Its gonna be a long long long long way to happy yeah  
Left in the pieces that you broke me into  
Torn apart but now Ive got to  
Keep on rolling like a stone  
Cause its gonna be a long long way to happy
