Sleepless nights and endless days  
And all I do is promise to change my ways  
Leave the lights on you know Ill pretend youre on youre way  
You used to say that theres a time we all deserve to lose our minds  
So I lost my mind now Im ready to find my way  
  
Back home  
Today  
To stay  
The way you wished I would  
And I swear  
To stay  
The way you wished I would  
  
I dont know if Im gonna have to redesign my mind  
But tonight I made a wish and I sure hope that it comes true  
Cause its been too long without you  
Its been too long  
  
Come home  
Today  
To stay  
The way you wished I would  
And I swear  
To stay  
The way I wish you would  
  
And even if I left it all behind  
Thered be reason to come back  
And even though I left you far behind  
I always thought that youd come here to find me  
Come find me  
  
I dont know if I can wait this long  
To be what I used to be  
And I dont think I can wait much longer  
For the tide to come back to me  
Come back to me  
  
Back home  
Today  
To stay  
The way I wish you would  
And I swear  
To stay  
The way I wish you would  
The way I wish you would
