Dear Mama  
If some people came by the house lookin for me  
Im innocent of anything they say I done  
Now I dont know when Ill be able to write you again  
But I will be back to California to see you  
Your son Ice motherfucking Cube  
  
Keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run  
I swear I didnt do what they say I done  
I swear I didnt do what they say I done  
  
Ghetto destroyer paranoia I need a lawyer  
This bitch named Netoia say they lookin for ya  
Got to get the fuck out of here yeah right  
This bitch dimmed the lights nigga spend the night  
Bust a quick nut got to fuck up and gat on  
cause this the same street I got shot on  
So God bless Don Polla doubles  
I gotta holla cause Im smokin on double breath  
Freakin niggas be leakin information  
Got the feds seekin incarceration  
Niggas say my name popped up  
Bitch hop up  
Nigga close the shop up  
They try to stop em  
My cash flow leave me asshole neck it  
Gone in sixty seconds burn all records  
Nigga gettin skinny eating dinnies  
Count my pennies only got a bag fulla twenties  
  
Chorus  
Listen these feds fishin for this extradition  
Im on a mission fuck em fight em dine em ditch em  
I gotta kick rocks cant pick locks  
Or spend the rest of my life in a shitbath  
  
Its so hard to get a room without a credit card  
Its so hard not to let em know where you are  
Tried to get a rent a car  
But he laughed when I showed him cash  
Had to mash fore he called the feds on my ass  
Went to Vegas for the weekend  
Met a hoe down freakin  
Hey bitch why you sneakin  
Grabbed the paper out her hand  
Am I the man on the front page Fuck  
Same height same age clickclick  
Rap gauge put it down the Gway  
Got my hostage suckin sausage on the freeway  
She say Lets hear the circle K  
Ran inside and made the niggas all pay  
Its like I hit the Lotto outside Colorado  
Brought it there for his wallet and my bottle  
Thats my motto and I gotta warn ya  
Before Im through Im going back to California  
  
Keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run  
I swear I didnt do what they say I done  
I swear I didnt do what they say I done  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
My boys youre taught at Illonois  
Set the poise so I can infiltrate  
All fifty states  
Cant wait till Im back on my feet  
Switch and shake this bitch in her sleep  
Low key you feds cant see me  
Im up in DC with strike number three  
Clownin made a little stock to get a little cock  
Now I got niggas bangin and lootin rock  
Im going back to Cali where its bound with my strikes  
Dont give a fuck whos on the marin or the mic  
I shouldve known when I seen that motherfucker in the lobby  
Looking like he want to rob me Fuck  
Federal dont like no black hetero sexual intellectual  
Tried to turn me into a vegetable  
An Im a sue all black and blue  
When I come to hand cuff Fuck yall  
Big grey bus scandalous  
cause they cant stand us  
They get excited and I try to fight it mama  
Im going back to Cali to show extradited  
  
Keep my hand on my gun cause they got me on the run  
I swear I didnt do what they say I done  
I swear I didnt do what they say I done  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey mama when yall send pictures you cant send a Polaroid  
Got to be the regular pictures  
An they got us in here puttin in computer chips or something

Like they playin with us its like a game  
It aint nothin but a game to them mama  
Its my life
