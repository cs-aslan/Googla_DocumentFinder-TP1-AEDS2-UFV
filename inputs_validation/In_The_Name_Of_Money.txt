The sun rises after midnight  
Big dreamers never sleep  
She takes a slow walk in the red light  
Wishin on the stars in concrete  
Jet black roots under alabaster hair  
Betty Grable legs gonna get her somewhere  
Shes runnin every light on the road to recognition  
  
Chorus  
Under one condition  
In the name of money  
In the name of fame  
Anything goes  
When you play that game  
In the name of money  
In the name of fame  
You gotta stick it out  
If you want to claim your fame  
  
So some hotshot in a rag top  
Gets her on the silver screen  
A hundred mirrors far a backdrop  
But her face was never seen  
Agents of love devils in disguise  
Theyre blowin smoke in the little girls eyes  
Yeah shell sign the dotted line and fall into submission  
  
Chorus  
  
Someday shell be a leading lady  
In a baby blue Mercede  
When shes rich and famous  
Her scandals will entertain us  
The badder the better  
Jet black roots under alabaster hair  
Betty Grable legs gonna get her somewhere  
Shes runnin every light on the road to recognition  
  
Chorus
