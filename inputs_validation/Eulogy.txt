He had a lot to say  
He had a lot of nothing to say  
Well miss him  
So long  
We wish you well  
You told us how you werent afraid to die  
Well then so long  
Dont cry  
Or feel too down  
Not all martyrs see divinity  
But at least you tried  
Standing above the crowd  
He had a voice that was strong and loud  
Well miss him  
Ranting and pointing his finger  
At everything but his heart  
Well miss him  
No way to recall  
What it was that you had said to me  
Like I care at all  
So loud  
You sure could yell  
You took a stand on every little thing  
And so loud  
Standing above the crowd  
He had a voice so strong and loud and I  
Swallowed his facade cuz Im so  
Eager to identify with  
Someone above the ground  
Someone who seemed to feel the same  
Someone prepared to lead the way with  
Someone who would die for me  
Will you Will you now  
Would you die for me  
Dont you fuckin lie  
Dont you step out of line  
Dont you fuckin lie  
Youve claimed all this time that you would die for me  
Why then are you so surprised to hear your own eulogy  
He had a lot to say  
He had a lot of nothing to say  
Come down  
Get off your fuckin cross  
We need the fuckin space to nail the next fool martyr  
To ascend you must die  
You must be crucified  
For our sins and our lies  
Goodbye
