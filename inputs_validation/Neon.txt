This shower will beam us to  
A blue changing too yellow scenery  
Bus noises all day long  
They make you whisper fragile words  
Losing energy  
  
And do we belong here  
Youve got this Dave Berry effect on me  
Dont worry  
This formula one race  
Wont change our space station  
  
Apollo in Germany  
You frightened me to death when you fell out of your bed  
A bladder can hurt so much  
Especially with a Berlin neon hospital touch  
  
And do we belong here  
Youve got this Dave Berry effect on me  
Dont worry  
This formula one race  
Wont change our space station  
  
And do we belong here  
Youve got this Dave Berry effect on me  
Dont worry  
This formula one race  
Wont change our space station  
  
And do we belong here  
Youve got this Dave Berry effect on me  
Dont worry  
This formula one race  
Wont change our space station
