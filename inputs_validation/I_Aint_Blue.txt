I aint blue baby  
Just a little bit lonesome for some lovin  
Everything is fine  
Just dont want to be all by myself  
On a rainy day  
Im feelin kind of funny  
Dreaming bout some loverman wholl call me honey  
Yeah and a good lookin man  
My heart inside  
A lonely smile and lovin in his eyes  
No I aint blue baby  
But Im just a little bit lonesome for some love again  
Everything is fine  
Just dont want to be all by myself  
Sit around the house  
Readin magazines  
All the time thinkin bout those same sweet dreams  
Yeah walk down the street  
My heart jumps a beat  
Every time I see some sweet man I want to meet  
No I aint blue baby  
But Im just a little bit lonesome for some love again  
Everything is fine  
I just dont want to be all by myself
