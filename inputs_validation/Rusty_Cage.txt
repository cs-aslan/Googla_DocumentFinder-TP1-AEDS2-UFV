You wired me awake  
And hit me with a hand of broken nails  
You tied my lead and pulled my chain  
To watch my blood begin t boil  
  
But Im gonna break  
Im gonna break my  
Im gonna break my rusty cage and run  
  
Too cold to start a fire  
Im burning diesel burning dinosaur bones  
Ill take the river down to still water  
And ride a pack of dogs  
  
Im gonna break  
Im gonna break my  
Im gonna break my rusty cage and run  
  
Hits like a Phillips head  
Into my brain  
Its gonna be too dark  
To sleep again  
Cutting my teeth on bars  
And rusty chains Im gonna break my  
Rusty cage and run  
  
When the forest burns  
Along the road  
Like Gods eyes  
In my headlights  
When the dogs are looking  
For their bones  
And its raining icepicks  
On your steel shore  
  
Im gonna break  
Im gonna break my  
Im gonna break my rusty cage and run
