So many times  
Ive asked myself the question  
Hiding in plain sight  
Is your love another selfpropeller perception  
  
Burning in my mind  
You dont know where Ive been  
I count too many sins  
To play de sad charade  
  
Suspicion kisses you when I do  
Though Ive never let you know  
I only wish you knew what I knew  
So we could both enjoy the show  
  
Here in the crucible  
Or could there be another explanation  
Im not aware of  
Or should I just ignore the situation  
  
Call me in care of  
I dont know where youve been  
Your lies is paper thin  
I see the truth erased  
  
Suspicion kisses you when I do  
Though Ive never let you know  
I only wish you knew what I knew  
So we could both enjoy the show  
  
Here in the crucible  
You dont know where Ive been  
I count too many sins  
To play de sad charade  
  
Suspicion kisses you when I do  
Though Ive never let you know  
I only wish you knew what I knew  
So we could both enjoy the show  
Here in the crucible
