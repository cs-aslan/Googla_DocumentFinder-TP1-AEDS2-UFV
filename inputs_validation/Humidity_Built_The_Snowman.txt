Does he still think about her  
Why there was never really any doubt  
Every time he lights a candle  
Or blows a candle out  
The scientific nature of the ordinary man  
Is to go on out and do the best you can  
  
I dont think that you know  
That I think you dont know  
That old barometer goes crazy baby  
Every time it starts to snow  
You wont find me walking  
Round your part of town  
Humidity built the snowman  
Sunshine brought him down  
  
This world is full of people  
They never seem to fall  
Somebody said they seen you  
You hadnt changed at all  
The fundamental story  
Of the contemporary man  
Is to walk away and someday understand  
  
I dont think that you know  
That I think you dont know  
That old barometer goes crazy baby  
Every time it starts to snow  
You wont find me walking  
Round your part of town  
Humidity built the snowman  
Sunshine brought him down  
  
The scientific nature of the ordinary man  
Is to go on out and do the best you can  
  
I dont think that you know  
That I think you dont know  
That old barometer goes crazy baby  
Every time it starts to snow  
You wont find me walking  
Round your part of town  
Humidity built the snowman  
Sunshine brought him down  
  
Humidity built the snowman  
Sunshine brought him down  
Brought him down
