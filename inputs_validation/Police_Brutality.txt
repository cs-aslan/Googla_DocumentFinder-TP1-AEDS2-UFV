No authority  
Ive spoke my mind a thousand times  
You can resist peacefully till the end of time  
Theres a point where you reach an end of thought  
And the thought turns to action emotion takes control  
  
Authority no authority fuck authority  
Police brutality  
  
Politicians are pigs in business suits  
Triangle of power the good are few  
If terrors what you represent  
Terrors what youre gonna get  
  
Authority no authority fuck authority  
Police brutality  
  
First word learned was the word no
