Now whos to judge whos a saint and whos a sinner  
Lord its tough enough to trudge from brunch to dinner  
We seek the light of truth between our white lies  
We sleep away our youth under tattletale skies  
  
Now whos to say whos a sinner and whos a saint  
Whos to say who you can love and who you cant  
Now its easy for the pot to call the kettle black  
Theyre just jealous of the hot and lusty sordid lives they led  
  
Aint it a bitch sortin out our sordid lives  
Its a bitch when you come to realize  
Got yourself a box of Cracker Jacks  
Then you get a really shitty prize  
Its a bitch sortin out our sordid lives  
  
Now we struggled comin down the chute to take our first breath  
And we struggle for acceptance from birth to death  
But the Lords too busy tryin to keep the world on its feet  
He aint got time to give a damn about what goes on between the sheets  
  
Aint it a bitch sortin out our sordid lives  
Its a bitch when you come to realize  
Got yourself a box of Cracker Jacks  
Then you get a really shitty prize  
Its a bitch sortin out our sorry little sordid lives
