Now youre very much like your mother  
And thats a natural fact  
But you couldnt look much like your brothers wife  
Or anyone like that  
  
And you dont look much like your sister  
Cause shes all big and fat  
But dont breath a word to your mean old dad  
Cause Ill be coming back  
  
Im coming home to see you early in the morning  
Ill be around and on the first train today  
Im coming home to see you while days dawning  
All aboard all aboard  
  
Put on some fancy clothes and meet me at the station  
Make sure I dont mistake you for your sister Jane  
Dont want to see you with your goddamn relations  
Thats all for now Ill see you ciao
