You See It All In My Smile  
You Hear It All In My Laugh  
The Way I Walk  
You Hear Me Talkin  
No Im No Longer Sad  
Ive Got More Reason To Smile  
More Now Than Ive Ever Had  
Open My Eyes And Realized  
That Nothings Quite That Bad  
  
Ive Got A Different Approach  
Of Dealin With Emotion  
Keeping Control Of My Boat  
While Drifting On This Ocean  
Keeping My Head To The Sky  
Keeping Tears Outta My Eyes  
Girl This Happiness Be The Reason  
That I Just Havent Cried  
  
And Lifes Too Short  
To Dwell On All Thats Wrong  
Stand Up Now  
Stand Up Now  
And I Promise Not Before Long  
Cuz Youll Be Feeling Better Today  
Much Better Today  
Much Better Today  
So Much Better  
Feelin Better Today
