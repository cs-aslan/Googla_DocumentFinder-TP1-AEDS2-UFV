I might bite my lip look down at my shoes  
I might clench my fist or just leave the room  
But Im not gonna cry not one single drop  
Cause once I get started out I may never stop  
  
I might even laugh right in your face  
When you come out and ask oh if Ill be okay  
But Im not gonna cry not one single drop  
Cause once I get started out I may never stop  
  
Its gonna take the night of fighting with all Ive got  
To keep the first tear from falling down  
But if I dont hold the waters back  
The dam is gonna crack  
  
And Ill be damned if Im gonna drown  
So Im not gonna cry  
If thats what you thought  
Cause once I get started out  
  
I may never stop  
No Im not gonna cry  
Not one single drop  
Cause once I get started  
I may never stop  
  
So I might bite my lip  
Look down at my shoes
