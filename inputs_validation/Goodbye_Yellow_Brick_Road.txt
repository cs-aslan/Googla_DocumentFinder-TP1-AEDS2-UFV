When are you gonna come down  
When are you going to land  
I should have stayed on the farm  
I should have listened to my old man  
  
You know you cant hold me forever  
I didnt sign up with you  
Im not a present for your friends to open  
This boys too young to be singing the blues  
  
So goodbye yellow brick road  
Where the dogs of society howl  
You cant plant me in your penthouse  
Im going back to my plough  
  
Back to the howling old owl in the woods  
Hunting the horny back toad  
Oh Ive finally decided my future lies  
Beyond the yellow brick road  
  
What do you think youll do then  
I bet thatll shoot down your plane  
Itll take you a couple of vodka and tonics  
To set you on your feet again  
  
Maybe youll get a replacement  
Theres plenty like me to be found  
Mongrels who aint got a penny  
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground
