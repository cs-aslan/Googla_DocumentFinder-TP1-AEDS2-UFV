All alone at the end of the evening  
And the bright lights have faded to blue  
I was thinking bout a woman who might have  
Loved me and I never knew  
You know Ive always been a dreamer  
spent my life running round  
And its so hard to change  
cant seem to settle down  
But the dreams Ive seen lately  
Keep on turning out and burning out  
And turning out the same  
  
So put me on a highway  
And show me a sign  
And take it to the limit one more time  
  
You can spend all your time making money  
You can spend all your love making time  
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow  
Would you still be mine  
  
And when youre looking for freedom  
nobody seems to care  
And you can find the door  
cant find it anywhere  
When theres nothing to believe in  
Still youre coming back youre running back for more  
  
So put me on a highway  
And show me a sign  
And take it to the limit one more time  
  
Take it to the limit  
Take it to the limit  
Take it to the limit one more time
