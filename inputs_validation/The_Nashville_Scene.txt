The streets are paved with tourist and the record companies flourish  
Lord knows every singer wants to be the king  
  
But some of them couldnt take it and some good ones didnt make it  
Thats the way it goes on The Nashville Scene  
  
Now theres a wino on the corner  
He was a well known guitar picker til he got burned out by the game  
  
Now hell bum you for some whiskey  
And tell you how it was back in 52 when he played for Hank  
  
And Im watching the sun go down this evening  
And soon it will wake this town thats made of dreams  
  
But before it does a new star will be shining  
And thats the way it is on the Nashville scene  
  
From the outside its a castle  
From the inside its a prison its easy to live way beyond your means  
  
And its a long long way to the top  
And even further when you drop and Ive been on both ends of the Nashville
scene
