Verse 1  
The sun will shine  
My heart shall sing  
One thought of you Jesus  
What joy it brings  
My soul cant wait  
To see your face  
And Ill bless your name jesus  
When we get there  
  
Verse 2  
Youll wipe my tears  
Youll say well done  
Youll hold me close  
And tell me Ive overcome  
And you will exchange  
Joy for my pain  
And Ill bless your name jesus  
When we get there  
  
Chorus  
Come on lets go  
Well cry no more  
Were gonna be just like jesus  
When we get there  
Come on lets go  
It wont be long  
Were gonna be just like Jesus  
When we get there  
Verse 1 repeat  
  
Verse 2 repeat  
  
Chorus repeat  
  
No more feeling alone  
When all my fear is all gone  
You tell me it wont be long  
When you call my name  
We shall be changed come on  
  
Repeat chorus until song ends
