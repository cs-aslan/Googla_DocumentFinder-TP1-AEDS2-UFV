You are my fire  
The one desire  
Believe when I say  
I want it that way  
  
When we are two worlds apart  
Cant reach to your heart  
When you say that I want it that way  
  
Tell me why  
Aint nothing but a heartache  
Tell me why  
Aint nothing but a mistake  
Tell me why  
I never wanna hear you say  
I want it that way  
  
Am I your fire  
Your one desire  
Yes I know  
Its too late  
But I want it that way  
  
Tell me why  
Aint nothing but a heartache  
Tell me why  
Aint nothing but a mistake  
Tell me why  
I never wanna hear you say  
I want it that way  
  
Now I can see that were falling apart  
From the way that it used to be yeah  
  
No matter the distance I want you to know  
That deep down inside of me  
  
You are my fire  
The one desire  
You are You are  
  
Dont wanna hear you say  
Aint nothing but a heartache  
Aint nothing but a mistake  
Dont wanna hear you say

Oh yeah

Tell me why  
Aint nothing but a heartache  
Tell me why  
Aint nothing but a mistake  
Tell me why  
I never wanna hear you say  
Dont wanna hear you say  
I want it that way

Aint nothing but a heartache  
Aint nothing but a mistake  
Tell me why
