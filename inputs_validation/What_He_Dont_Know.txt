He dont know that you been coming around  
He dont know that we been out of bounds  
Things we do are better left unsaid  
You and me can never keep our heads  
What he dont know  
Will never hurt him  
What he dont know  
Is I have changed  
Its just a matter of time  
Till it all comes down down down  
Till he hears  
The stories going round round round  
What he dont know  
What he dont know  
  
Baby Im open to your every suggestion  
Nothing you ask is out of the question  
Things I wouldnt do ya got me doin  
And oh what I wouldnt do for you  
  
What he dont know  
Will never hurt him  
What he dont know  
Is I have changed  
Its just a matter of time  
Till it all comes down down down  
Till he hears  
The stories going round round round  
What he dont know  
What he dont know  
  
What he dont know  
What he dont know  
What he dont know  
What he dont know
