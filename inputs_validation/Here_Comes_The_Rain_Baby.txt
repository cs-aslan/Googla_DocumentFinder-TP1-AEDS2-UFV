Here comes the rain baby  
Guess its goodbye again baby  
For awhile it was fun we could walk in the sun  
But you never could stand the rain could you baby  
See the rain in my eyes baby  
I never could stand goodbyes baby  
For awhile you were mine but the sun cant always shine  
And you never could stand the rain could you baby  
For a while you were mine  
But the sun cant always shine  
And you never could stand the rain could you baby  
I tried to keep the rain from falling  
You know I tried to keep the rain from falling  
Its not the rain in the skies  
Its the rain in my eyes that wont ever stop falling baby
