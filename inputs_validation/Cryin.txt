There was a time  
When I was so brokenhearted  
Love wasnt much of a friend of mine  
The tables have turned  yeah  
Cause me and them ways have parted  
That kinda love was the killin kind  
All I want is someone I cant resist  
I know  all I  need to know  
By the way I got kissed  
I was cryin when I met you  
Now Im tryin to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin just to get you  
Now Im dryin cause I let you  
Do what you do down on me  
Now theres not even breathing room  
Between pleasure and pain  
Yeah you cry when were makin love  
Must be one and the same  
Its down on me  
Yeah I got to tell you one thing  
Its been on my mind girl I gotta say  
Were partners in crime  
You got that certain something  
What you do to me takes my breath away  
Now the word out on the street  
Is the devils in your kiss  
If our love goes up in flames  
Thats a fire I cant resist  
I was cryin when I met you  
Now Im tryin to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin just to get you  
Now Im dyin cause I let you  
Do what you do to me  
Cause what you got inside  
Aint where your love should stay  
Yeah our love sweet love aint love  
Til you give your heart away  
I was cryin when I met you  
Now Im tryin to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin just to get you  
Now Im dyin just to let you  
Do what you do what you do down on me  
Baby baby baby

Now Im tryin to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin when I met you

Do what you do down to down to down to  
I was cryin when I met you  
Now Im tryin to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery
