I dont know how to love you  
Where do I begin  
It helplessness is sinning  
Then here I am a sinner  
Guilty of sin  
  
I dont know how to help you  
Your trouble goes so deep  
Youre about to lose your life  
And here I am dejected  
Cause I love a night of sleep  
  
Love one another you said  
Come together as one  
Im just a servant Lord  
Yet you made me a son  
Sometimes Im troubled  
By the things you make me see  
But no matter how I feel Lord  
Here am I send me  
  
So I leave the world behind me  
And enter this domain  
Im staggered by the gulf  
Between us  
I can see your sickness  
But I dont feel your pain  
  
Pitys got no power  
Compassion has the heart  
Jesus keep me mindful  
That its you who does the  
Giving  
And its we who need to  
Play our part
