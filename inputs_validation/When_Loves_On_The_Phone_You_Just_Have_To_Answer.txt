Some situations need a little heart  
A tenderness thats hard to understand  
The falling in love for a start  
Can easily turn to the fall of a man  
You cant run and hide even if you want to  
Things must be done that should be done  
You cant run and hide  
When loves got you  
Tangled up on a tightrope  
Your hearts on the run  
When loves on the phone you just have to answer  
Theres no way you can hang up  
When loves on the  
Phone you just have to answer  
Well are you ready to fall in love  
And everybody needs a reason  
Could be a dream of fire and ice  
And you and me  
We need each other  
Need to be on each others minds  
Yes some situations need a little heart  
To take to the sea with the sails unfurled  
The falling in love for a start can easily  
Turn to the fall of a girl  
When loves on the phone
