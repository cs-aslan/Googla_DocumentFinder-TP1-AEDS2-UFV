I like the way you wanted me  
Every night for so long baby  
I like the way you needed me  
Every time things got rocky  
  
I was believing in you  
Am I mistaken do you say  
Do you say what you mean  
I want our love to last forever  
  
But Id rather you be mean than love and lie  
Id rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye  
Id rather take a blow at least then I would know  
But baby dont you break my heart slow  
  
I like the way youd hold me  
Every night for so long baby  
And I like the way youd say my name  
In the middle of the night  
While you were sleeping  
  
I was believing in you  
Was I mistaken  
Do you mean mean what you say  
When you say our love could last forever  
  
Well Id rather you be mean than love and lie  
Id rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye  
Id rather take a blow at least then I would know  
But baby dont you break my heart slow  
  
You would run around and lead me on forever  
While I wait at home thinking that were together  
I wanted our love to last forever  
  
Well Id rather you be mean than love and lie  
Id rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye  
Id rather take a blow at least then I would know  
But baby dont you break my heart slow
