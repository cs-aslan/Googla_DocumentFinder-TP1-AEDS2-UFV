I never thought that  
You would be the one to hold my heart  
But you came around  
And you knocked me off the ground from the start  
  
You put your arms around me  
And I believe that its easier for you to let me go  
You put your arms around me and Im home  
  
How many times will let you me change my mind and turn around  
I cant decide if Ill let you save my life or if Ill drown  
  
I hope that you see right through my walls  
I hope that you catch me cause Im already falling  
Ill never let a love get so close  
You put your arms around me and Im home  
  
The world is coming down on me  
And I cant find a reason to be loved  
I never wanna leave you  
But I cant make you bleed if Im alone  
  
You put your arms around me  
And I believe that its easier for you to let me go  
  
I hope that you see right through my walls  
I hope that you catch me cause Im already falling  
Ill never let a love get so close  
You put your arms around me and Im home  
  
I tried my best to never let you in to see the truth  
And Ive never opened up  
Ive never truly loved till you put your arms around me  
And I believe that its easier for you to let me go  
  
I hope that you see right through my walls  
I hope that you catch me cause Im already falling  
Ill never let a love get so close  
You put your arms around me and Im home  
  
You put your arms around me and Im home
