Its been a long long time since I lost myself  
Put my pride down on the table put my fear on the shelf  
So I bought myself a throne to reside and let myself go  
But Ive traveled much too far where Ive gone Ill never know  
  
What a long long time  
Long long time  
Its been a little old while since I felt so fine  
Wanderin in the rain  
  
Losing my mind  
What a long long time  
What a long long time  
My days Ive spet relaxin turned to nights relaxin too  
  
A thousand eyes upon me but my sights are missing you  
So this time I swear I will loosen my grip  
On past times and bad lines and meaningless trips  
What a long long time  
  
Long long time  
Its been a little old while since I felt so fine  
Wanderin in the rain  
Losing my mind  
  
What a long long time  
What a long long time  
So over and over mile signs pass by my side  
The more you try to find yourself the more you tend to hide  
  
Behind these  forest trees  and greens that blind your eyes  
To lounge upon that throne I bought  
Confer there with the wise  
What a long long time  
  
Long long time  
Its been a little old while since I felt so fine  
Wanderin in the rain  
Losing my mind  
  
What a long long time  
Long timeyeah  
So here we appear the rest lost themselves in a pit of fear  
For who What can I do But let them all come through the wall  
  
And though some oppose many of these things I know  
Ill stay here alone and lose myself on the riverways of days  
Im coming home  
What a long long time  
  
Long long time  
Its been a little old while since I felt so fine  
Wanderin in the rain  
Losing my mind  
  
What a long long time  
What a long long time
