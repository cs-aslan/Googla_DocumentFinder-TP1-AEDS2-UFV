If you are sincere  
When you say you dont care  
That our love is just a memory  
If the love that we knew  
Wont bother you  
Darling youre stronger than me  
  
CHORUS  
For if still loving you means Im weak  
Then Im weak  
For I still fall apart when we speak  
Or we meet  
If the love that we knew  
Wont bother you  
Darling youre stronger than me  
  
If you can have fun  
With some other one  
With no thought of what used to be  
If its easy to say  
That its better this way  
Darlin youre stronger than me  
  
CHORUS
