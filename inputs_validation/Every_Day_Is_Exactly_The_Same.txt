I believe I can see the future  
Cause I repeat the same routine  
I think I used to have a purpose  
But then again that might have been a dream  
  
I think I used to have a voice  
Now I never make a sound  
I just do what Ive been told  
I really dont want them to come around oh no  
  
Every day is exactly the same  
Every day is exactly the same  
There is no love here and there is no pain  
Every day is exactly the same  
  
I can feel their eyes are watching  
In case I lose myself again  
Sometimes I think Im happy here  
Sometimes  
Sometimes yet I still pretend  
  
I cant remember how this got started  
Oh but I can tell you exactly how it will end  
  
Every day is exactly the same  
Every day is exactly the same  
There is no love here and there is no pain  
Every day is exactly the same  
  
Ill write it on a little piece of paper  
Im hoping someday you might find  
Well Ill hide it behind something  
They wont look behind  
  
I am still inside her  
A little bit comes bleeding through  
I wish this couldve been any other way  
But I just dont know I dont know what else I can do  
  
Every day is exactly the same  
Every day is exactly the same  
There is no love here and there is no pain  
Every day is exactly the same  
  
Every day is exactly the same  
Every day is exactly the same  
There is no love here and there is no pain  
Every day is exactly the same  
Every day is the same
