Dreams that money just cant buy  
You give away no try and now youre gone is it forever  
Love for me is not a game  
Dont play a trick again its over now is it forever  
Dont hurt my heart  
  
Oh I thought you are the girl out of my dreams  
Ill be there for you oh baby now it seems  
Youre the one who quit this love and let me go  
Is it over now I have to know  
  
Girl oh why you changed your mind  
Theres a way well find but why youre gone is it forever  
Love is looking through my eyes  
Dont leave this paradise its over now is it forever  
Dont hurt my heart  
  
I have to know I have to know
