Sad to be alone  
Your only comfort is the telephone  
Homesick again  
Thoughts of far away  
Silence is the only way to say  
Aint it a shame  
Whats goin down she dont understand  
Cant you be with her every night  
Why must it be youre away so long  
But she plays along and its alright  
People all around  
You dont see or hear them make a sound  
Its not the same  
Whats goin down she dont understand  
Cant you be with her every night  
Why must it be youre away so long  
But she plays along and its alright  
  
Countin out the days  
That dont help to ease the days away  
The price you pay  
Homesick again
