Some folks looks through a telescope  
And dream of flying high above the stars  
They say it wont be long  
Til we can haul on a ship to Mars  
  
Im just a simple man  
Theres a lot that I dont know  
But as long as youre here with me  
I just assume stay home  
  
On this side of the moon  
Things are going my way  
Your love keeps shining through  
Even when it rains  
  
Theres nowhere else Id rather be  
Im happy standing in these shoes  
With you here in my life  
The world is looking bright  
On this side of the moon  
  
Sometimes on a clear night  
We pulled out a chair in the yard  
And Im always amazed  
At the good lord can make so many stars  
  
But I know Id feel out of place  
Longing through the milky ways  
All you expect a astronaut  
Id think Id rather stay  
  
On this side of the moon  
Things are going my way  
Your love keeps shining through  
Even when it rains  
  
Theres nowhere else Id rather be  
Im happy standing in these shoes  
With you here in my life  
The world is looking bright  
On this side of the moon
