Youre a survivor youre a survivor survivor survivor  
  
You cant believe that your whole worlds shattered  
You used to have it all under control  
Its like youve lost everything that mattered  
And youre afraid to fall  
Youve been though it all too many times  
  
And though I know your pain  
Without it theres no way  
So the say  
Yeah oh  
Youre lying in the rain  
Letting it fall across your face  
Just to feel alive  
  
Chorus  
So lets hear it for the ones  
Who know what it feels like  
To survive a broken heart  
Put one hand up in the sky  
Tonight  
If you know what it feels like  
To survive a broken heart  
Survivor of a broken heart Youre a survivor youre a survivor survivor
survivor  
Survivor of a broken heart Youre a survivor youre a survivor survivor
survivor  
  
Youre searching through all the thoughts youve gathered  
And it feels impossible  
To make it through another day  
Where do you turn when your faiths been scattered  
And nothing is logical  
Youve been through it all too many times  
  
And you can feel your pain  
But you cant win before you lose  
So they say  
Yeah oh  
You search for whos to blame  
When you let go you find the truth  
Is just to feel alive  
  
Chorus  
  
A thousand pieces on the ground  
How do you put them back together once again  
And when your world comes crashing down  
Thats when you rise and find your way up  
Thats when you find out what youre made of  
  
Chorus  
  
Survivor of a broken heart Youre a survivor youre a survivor survivor
survivor  
Survivor of a broken heart Youre a survivor youre a survivor survivor
survivor
