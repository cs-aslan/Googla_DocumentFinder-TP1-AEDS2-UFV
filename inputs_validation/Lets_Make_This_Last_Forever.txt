I need a kick drum  
A guitar now  
And a bass line  
Gonna show you how  
  
How to rock  
How to dance  
How to get down  
And all I need is a piano in my track now  
  
Chorus  
Throw your hands  
Throw your hands  
Throw your hands  
Throw your hands up  
Whoa whoa  
  
Cause you cant  
Cause you cant  
Cause you cant  
Cause you cant stop  
Whoa whoa  
  
Can you hear me hey  
Do you feel it hey  
If youre with me go  
123  
Cause were here  
And were now and were all together  
So lets make this last forever  
  
Turn the amps up  
Turn the lights down  
Brush yourself off  
Im a show you how  
  
How to rock  
How to dance  
How to get down  
Everybody on the floor now  
  
Chorus  
  
Lets make this last forever3x  
  
Of all the stars in the sky tonight  
Compared to us  
Well they dont shine quite as bright  
  
Chorus X2
