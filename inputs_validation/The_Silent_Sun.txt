The silent sun that never shines  
She is the warmth of my lonely heart  
The motion of a turning wheel  
Cant you stop it and look around  
  
Baby you feel so close  
I wish you could see my love  
Baby youve changed my life  
Im trying to show you  
  
A tiny stone that hides from me  
Cant you see that Im just outside  
A mountain stream that chills the sea  
Cant you feel in your useless pride  
  
Baby you feel so close  
I wish you could see my love  
Baby youve changed my life  
Im trying to show you  
  
When night reveals a starfilled sky  
I want to hold it in my hands  
When snowflakes heal the ugly ground  
Your beauty hides the joy Ive found  
  
Baby you feel so close  
I wish you could see my love  
Baby youve changed my life  
Im trying to show you
