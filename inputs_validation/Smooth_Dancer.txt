Black suede dont mean youre good for me  
Black suede just brings your mystery  
I want to be inside of you  
But youre black and I dont know what to do  
  
Youre a smooth dancer  
But its alright  
Cause Im a freelancer  
And you can never break me though you try  
  
To make me think youre magical  
Baby youre the one who can never see the sun  
Because it dont shine nightly  
Dont you look at me because Im gonna shake free  
  
Youd better hang on tightly  
You want to rule the world  
But youre acting like a girl  
Whos got a false pregnancy  
Youve swollen up inside  
With nothing but your pride  
  
And yet you keep on dancing  
Black suede dont waste your time on me  
Black suede I sense your mockery  
I tried to go along with you  
  
But youre black and I know just what to do  
Youre a smooth dancer  
But its alright  
Cause Im a freelancer  
  
And you can never break me though you try  
To make me think youre magical  
I think youre crazy your twotiming ways  
They dont bother me none  
  
Youd better do it right because one day or night  
Im gonna walk to freedom  
You know I loved you once and I want to love again  
But you dont give nothing  
  
You can see it in my eyes so youve got to realize  
Baby I aint bluffing  
Black suede dont waste your time on me  
Black suede dont bring me misery  
  
I tried to be inside of you  
But youre black and now I know what to do  
Youre a smooth dancer  
But its alright  
  
Cause Im a freelancer  
And I can tell youre faking though you try  
To make me think youre magical  
Baby youre the one who can never see the sun  
  
Because it dont shine nightly  
Dont you look at me because Im gonna shake free  
Youd better hang on tightly  
You know I loved you once and I want to love again  
  
But you dont give nothing  
You can see it in my eyes so youve got to realize  
Baby I aint bluffing  
Baby you can rock n roll  
  
But you can never show your soul smooth dancer
