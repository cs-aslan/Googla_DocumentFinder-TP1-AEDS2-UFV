Sowhat am I not supposed to have an opinion  
Should I keep quiet just because Im a women  
Call me a bitch cause I speak whats on my mind  
Guess its easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled  
  
When a female fires back suddenly big talker dont know how to act  
So he does what every little boy would do  
Makin up a few false rumors or two  
That for sure is not a man for me slanderin names for popularity  
Its sad you only get your fame through controversy  
But now its time for me to come and give you more to say  
  
Chorus  
This is for my girls all around the world  
Who have come across a man that dont respect your worth  
Thinkin all women should be seen and not heard  
So what do we do girls shout out loud  
Lettin em know were gonna stand our ground  
So lift your hands high and wave em proud  
Take a deep breath and say it loud  
Never can never will  
Cant hold us down  
  
Nobody can hold us down  
Never can never will  
  
Sowhat am I not supposed to say what Im saying  
Are you offended with the message Im bringin  
Call me whatever cause you words dont mean a thing  
Guess you aint even a man enough to handle what I sing  
If you look back in history its a common double standard os society  
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score  
While the girl can do the same yet you call her a whore  
I dont understand why its OK  
The guy can get a way with it the girl gets named  
All my ladies come together and make a change  
And start a new beginning for us everybody sang  
  
Chorus  
This is for my girls all around the world  
Who have come across a man that dont respect your worth  
Thinkin all women should be seen and not heard  
So what do we do girls shout out loud  
Lettin em know were gonna stand our ground  
So lift your ahnds high and wave em proud  
Take a deep breath and say it loud  
Never can never will  
Cant hold us down  
  
Heres something I just cant understand  
If the guy have three girls then hes the man  
He can even give her some head or sex her off  
But if a girl do the same shes a whore  
But the tables about to turn  
I bet my fame on it  
Cats take my ideas and put their name on it  
Its aight though you cant hold me down  
I got to keep on moving  
To my girls to their man who be trying to mac  
Do it right back to him and let that be that  
You need to let him know that his game is whack  
And Lil Kim and Christina Aguilera got yo back  
  
Youre just a little boy  
Think you so cute so coy  
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things  
Youre just a little boy  
All you do is annoy  
You must talk big to make up for smaller things  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Uh oh oh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Cant hold us down  
  
Yeah we here we back again yeah  
Lil Kim and Christina Aguilera  
  
Cant hold us down
