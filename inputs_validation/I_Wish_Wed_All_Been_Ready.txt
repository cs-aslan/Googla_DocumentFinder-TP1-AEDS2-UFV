Life was filled with guns and war  
And everyone got trampled on the floor  
I wish wed all been ready  
Children died the day grew cold  
  
A piece of bread could buy a bag of gold  
I wish wed all been ready  
Theres no time to change your mind  
The son has come and youve been left behind  
  
A man and wife sleep in bed she hears a noise  
And turns her head hes gone  
I wish wed all been ready  
Two men walking up a hill one disappears and  
  
Ones left standing still  
I wish wed all been ready  
Theres no time to change your mind  
The son has come and youve been left behind  
  
Life was filled with guns and war  
And everyone got trampled on the floor  
I wish wed all been ready  
Children died the days grew cold  
  
A piece of bread could buy a bag of gold  
I wish wed all been ready  
Theres no time to change your mind  
How could you have been so blind  
  
The father spoke the demons dined  
The son has come and youve been left behind
