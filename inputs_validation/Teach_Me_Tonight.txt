Excuse me did you call yourself a love expert  
Studied graduated and qualified to show me what its all about  
Honey talk is cheap you gonna have to convince me  
  
Did you say Ive got a lot to learn  
Well dont think Im trying not to learn  
Right here is the perfect spot to learn  
Teach me tonight  
  
Starting with the A B C of it  
Right down to the X Y Z of it  
Teach me the whole mystery of it  
Teach me tonight  
  
The skys a blackboard high above us  
And if a shooting star should fly by  
Ill take that star and write I love you I love you  
A thousand times across the sky  
  
One thing isnt very clear my love  
Should the teachers stand so near my love  
Graduations almost here my love  
Come on and teach me tonight
