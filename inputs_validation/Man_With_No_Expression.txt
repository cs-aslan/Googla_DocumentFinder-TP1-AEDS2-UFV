Theres a man I know with no expression no not none at all  
  
Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm  
Or led a lion through a busy street bazaar  
There are many things Id like to turn you on to  
But somehow I feel youre safer where you are  
  
If youre looking for examples to refer to  
Take a look around yourself Im sure youll find  
There are many things to make your life much brighter  
And Id bet theres many more inside your mind  
  
Theres a man I know with no expression no not none at all  
  
Theres a man I know with no expression no not none at all  
  
But Ive never seen this man laughing  
And come to think of it Ive never seen him cry  
But I might by sitting hear him singing  
By and by hell stop and sigh  
Hell feel a breeze and then begin to freeze  
As he thinks goodbye  
  
Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm  
Or led a lion through a busy street bazaar  
There are many things Id like to turn you on to  
But somehow I feel youre safer where you are  
  
Theres a man I know with no expression no not none at all  
Theres a man with no expression  
Man with no expression  
Man with no expression
