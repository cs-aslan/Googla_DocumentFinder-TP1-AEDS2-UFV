Been thinking about you  
Without even trying Ive done it  
Theres something about you  
I cant put my finger on it  
Monday was fine and I was on a high  
  
Im begging you please to ease allow your feelings to show oh oh  
Youre bringing me down to my kneesw cause I love you so  
  
If your love is strong I want to be sure about it  
Oh is it all wrong to go on talking about it  
  
Oh you thrilled me  
I should be alright but Friday I died when you killed me  
Youre bringing me down to my knees oh oh  
Love me forever or baby just let it go oh oh  
  
Monday was fine yea the hours went by like a summer breeze  
But way down the line you might make up your mind and its time to freeze  
Youre bringing me down to my knees  
Ive been thinking about you
