Theres a place for us  
Somewhere a place for us  
Peace and quiet and open air  
Wait for us somewhere  
  
Theres a time for us  
Some day a time for us  
Time together with time to spare  
Time to look time to care  
Someday somewhere  
  
Well find a new way of living  
Well find theres a way of forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
Theres a place for us a time and place for us  
Hold my hand and were halfway there  
Hold my hand and Ill take you there  
Somehow someday somewhere  
  
Well find a new way of living  
Well find a way of forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
Theres a time for us a time and place for us  
Hold my hand and were halfway there  
Hold my hand and Ill take you there  
Somehow someday somewhere somewhere  
  
Somewhere
