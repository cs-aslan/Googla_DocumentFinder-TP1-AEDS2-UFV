Lucille please come back where you belong  
Ive been good to you baby  
Please dont leave me alone  
Well I woke up this morning Lucille was not in sight  
I asked her friends about her but no all their lips were tight  
Lucille baby satisfy my heart

Ill be good to you baby  
And give you such a wonderful start
