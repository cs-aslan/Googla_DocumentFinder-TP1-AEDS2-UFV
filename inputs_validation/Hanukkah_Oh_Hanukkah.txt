Hanukkah Oh Hanukkah  
Lets light the menorah  
Lets have a party  
Well all dance the hora  
Gather round the table well give you a treat  
A dreidal to play with and latkes to eat  
  
And while we are playing  
The candles are burning low  
One for each night they shed a sweet light  
To remind us of days long ago  
One for each night they shed a sweet light  
To remind us of days long ago
