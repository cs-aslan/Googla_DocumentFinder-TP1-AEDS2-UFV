Snowy nights and Christmas lights  
Icy window panes  
Make me wish that we could be  
Together again  
And the windy winter avenues  
Just dont seem the same  
And the Christmas carols sound like blues  
But the choir is not to blame  
  
Chorus  
But it doesnt have to be that way  
What we had should have never have ended  
And Ill be dropping by today  
We could easily get it together tonight  
Its only right  
  
Crowded stores the corner Santa Claus  
Tinseled afternoons  
And the sidewalk bands that play their songs  
Slightly out of tune  
On the windy winter avenues  
There walks a lonely man  
And if I told you who he is  
Well I think youd understand  
  
Chorus x2
