Manhunt to find your daughter  
Buried underneath the water  
Now they consult a psychic  
Find how much I like it  
And now Ive found a little friend  
Its too fast  
This wont last  
And to touch  
Hurts too much  
And now Ive found a little friend  
  
And now its just you and me  
Borrow one and we will make three  
I say we steal one more  
Just like we did once before  
  
And now I thought I told her  
That she wont get much older  
And now Ive found a little friend  
  
And now it makes no difference  
Cause I am not quite in yet  
And now its on the table  
Cause shes perfectly able  
And now Ive found a little friend
