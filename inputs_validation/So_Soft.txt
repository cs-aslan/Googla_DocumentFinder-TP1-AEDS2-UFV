Held in your arms in the back seat  
Cruising down the main street  
How can anyone have such little defense  
Youre soft  
In between the sheets left in limbo  
Covered me like the pillow  
I can hardly tell the difference  
Youre soft  
So soft  
To be to be with you  
Id leave everything  
But I dont know how to deal with you  
I swear youd fall like a feather if I was cruel  
Love would melt me like hot butter  
Youre soft  
So soft  
To be to be with you  
Id do anything  
Walking down the street brushing arms  
Youre moonlight dancing  
I try hard to keep my feelings in  
Youre soft  
Dancing to the music so low  
I knead you like dough  
How can anyone be so loving  
And soft  
So soft  
To be to be with you  
Id leave everything  
But I dont know how to deal with you  
I swear youd fall like a feather if I was cruel  
You melt me like hot butter  
Youre soft  
So soft  
To be to be with you  
Id do anything
