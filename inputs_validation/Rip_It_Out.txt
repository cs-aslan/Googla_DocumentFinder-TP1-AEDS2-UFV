Now I know youve been cheatin and lyin all the time  
I didnt know you were gonna be so unkind  
Ive been trying just to find out how we went wrong  
But I know that I cant trust you girl anymore  
  
Rip it out take my heart you wanted it from the start  
You got it now so goodbye so rip it out watch me cry  
  
Its so sad Im not glad to be with you today  
And its bad cause I cant stop the pain day by day  
If I knew how to stop you I dont think Id try  
I think its better if we just part and dont say goodbye  
  
Rip it out take my heart you wanted it from the start  
You got it now so goodbye so rip it out watch me cry  
  
I hope you suffer  
  
Rip it out take my heart you wanted it from the start  
You got it now so goodbye so rip it out watch me cry  
  
Rip it out take my heart you wanted it from the start  
You got it now so goodbye so rip it out watch me cry  
  
Rip it out repeats out
