Babe I had a dream  
Woke up in a sweat  
Darkness all around me  
I was caught in its net  
Tried to reach for you  
But you werent there  
It only was a dream  
But it put danger in the air  
I can feel the nervous rhythm  
Of your heart with mine  
Could we ever stay together  
Stand the test of time  
Baby make me a believer  
Cause this world will lie  
Oh these times are hard for lovers  
Its getting harder for you and me  
Oh  
Its hard on me and you  
Baby we can make it  
Cause our love will pull us through  
These times are hard for lovers  
Its down to me in you  
Nothings gonna break us  
If we hang on to whats true  
These times are hard for lovers  
I believe in you  
These times are hard for lovers  
I believe in you  
Everywhere you turn  
Trouble going on  
Living under pressure  
Loving under the gun  
Its hard enough to live  
Draw another breath  
Hang on to me baby  
Like its life or death  
I can feel the nervous rhythm of your heart with mine  
Could we ever stay together  
Stand the test of time  
Baby make me a believer  
Cause this world will lie  
Oh these times are hard for lovers  
Its getting harder for you and me  
Oh  
Its hard on me and you  
Baby we can make it  
Cause our love will pull us through  
These times are hard for lovers  
Its down to me in you  
Nothings gonna break us  
If we hang on to whats true  
These times are hard for lovers  
I believe in you  
These times are hard for lovers  
I believe in you  
Can you feel the nervous rhythm of your heart with mine  
Could we ever stay together  
Stand the test of time  
Baby make me a believer  
Cause this world will lie  
Weve got to go the distance  
Touch the sky  
Baby we can make it  
Cause our love will pull us through  
These times are hard for lovers  
Its down to me in you  
Nothings gonna break us  
If we hang on to whats true  
These times are hard for lovers  
I believe in you
