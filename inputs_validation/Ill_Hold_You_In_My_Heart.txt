Ill hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms  
Like youd never been held before  
Ill think of you each day and then Ill dream the night away  
Till you are in my arms once more  
  
The stars up in the sky know the reason why  
I feel so blue when Im away from you  
Ill hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms  
So darling please wait for me  
  
The stars up in the sky know the reason why  
I feel so blue when Im away from you  
Ill hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms  
So darling please wait for me
