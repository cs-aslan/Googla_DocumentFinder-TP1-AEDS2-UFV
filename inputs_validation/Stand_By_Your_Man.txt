Sometimes its hard to be a woman  
Givin all your love to just one man  
Youll have bad times and hell have good times  
Doin things that you dont understand  
  
But if you love him then youll forgive him  
Even though hes hard to understand  
And if you love him oh be proud of him  
Cause after all hes just a man  
  
Stand by your man  
Give him two arms to cling to  
And somethin warm to come to  
When nights are cold and lonely  
  
Stand by your man  
And show the world you love him  
Keep givin all the love you can  
Stand by your man  
  
Stand by your man  
And show the world you love him  
Keep givin all the love you can  
Stand by your man
