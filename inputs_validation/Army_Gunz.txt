Okay Im out chea you niggas done started it ya ordered it  
Bullet find a home in ya arteries pardon me  
But them niggas wont touch not a part of me bet on it  
Them niggas belong in a sorority aint that a bitch  
Burn they bodies up for the authorities no evidence  
You gon stop fuckin wit them warriors from New Orleans  
And I really think that itd be better if  
I just hit ya block wit that baretta and hop out and let her rip  
Let her bang let her bust et cetera et cetera  
You niggas is scared of the southern part of America  
Here it come got a gun  
Never come without one  
Niggas wanna ball so I guess I gotta bounce em  
Smokin on a ounce of that shit from the mountains  
People say I need to stop no I need a counselor  
And down here you gonna need a chopper  
And Im a need a lawyer and you gon need a doctor  
Why Because  
  
Chorus  
  
Get at em we hit em up if they rattin  
Niggas aint fuckin wit the boy them niggas softer than satin  
Im feelin awfully aggy

I tell him park in a alley  
and leave em parked in the alley  
Niggas talkin about me  
but they aint talkin it at me  
Cause if they talkin it at me  
then Im just talkin to caskets  
All that talkin is pussy  
bitch you better make ya words strong  
Cause the shit gettin chiseled on ya tombstone  
What they do I got a chopper in the UHaul  
Make a real nigga bring it back to ninety two dog  
Bring his ass to the river drop the fool off  
Hope he can swim wit them concrete shoes on  
I got the gun right beside me who dont  
Got beef homie I was just gettin hungry  
When you come bitch you better bring a army  
We can do it in the streets and throw a gansgta party nigga  
Why Because  
  
Chorus  
  
Thirty shots in the clip niggas lets trip  
Line em up put em down on the guest list  
These niggas bout to make me go Rambo  
Im a take the shit as far as it can go  
War is the answer if ya questionin the general  
Snap shots atcha baby you are just a centerfold  
And thats Kenneth Cole niggas seem plenty bold  
Pull that bitch out alright dont make me get my fishin pole  
Them niggas hoes really doe  
I would swing down there wit any O  
Fortyfo and let em go  
Let em know that I aint never been sweet and wont be  
Yes Ill be right here on the ground when you want me  
Make a nigga have to come back like wit the smack  
Thomas bitch I promise Ill kill ya and thats a fact  
And I aint never killed no one jack  
But Im honest bitch I promise Ill kill ya and thats a fact  
Why Because
