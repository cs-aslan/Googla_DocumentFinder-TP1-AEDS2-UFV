Can you see like a child  
Can you see what I want  
I wanna run through your wicked garden  
Heard thats the place to find ya  
Cause Im alive So alive now  
I know the darkness blinds you  
  
Can you see without eyes  
Can you speak without lies  
I wanna drink from your naked fountain  
i can drown your sorrows  
Im gonna burn Burn you to life now  
Out of the chains that bind you  
  
Can you see just like a child  
Can you see just what I want  
Can I bring you back to life  
Are you still alive  
  
Burn  
Burn your wicked garden down  
Burn your wicked garden to the ground  
  
Can you feel pain inside  
Can you love  
Can you cry  
I wanna run through your wicked garden  
Heard thats the place to find ya  
Cause Im alive So Alive now  
I know the darkness blinds you  
  
Can you see just like a child  
Can you see just what I want  
Can I bring you back to life  
Are you still alive  
  
Burn
