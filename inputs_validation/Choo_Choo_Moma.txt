Choo choo Moma wont you ride the train  
My life without you is just misery and pain come back to me  
Ill treat you best I can  
Choo choo Moma you should have a choo choo man  
  
Choo choo Moma wont you ride a rail  
I need your loving cant you hear me wail come back to me  
You know I love you so  
Choo choo Moma wont you get a choo choo home  
  
Choo choo Moma wont you ride the track  
I need your loving wont you bring some back on home to me  
I need your loving babe  
Choo choo Moma dont you know you drive me mad  
  
Choo choo Moma youre a cheery thing  
I love you baby cant you help me sing come back to me  
I want you back again  
Choo choo Moma wont you get a choo choo train
