She cried and walked away just yesterday  
And like a fool I let her go  
We had a silly fight the night before  
I never said I love you so  
I wept all day and then I got the call  
Would you please come to see your wife  
Something has happened and its very grave  
We cannot save the ladys life  
  
No I never said goodbye and I never really told her  
Just how much she meant to me  
No I never said goodbye now its too late  
And shes just a memory  
How can I go on  
Now that girl is gone  
I will know until I die  
I never said goodbye  
  
Her perfume lingers all around me now  
A pair of shoes lie on the floor  
The bed unmade where just last night she laid  
I cannot say I closed the door  
A shopping list of things shell never buy  
An apron lyin on the chair  
Is that her laugh I hear out in the hall  
I turn and call but shes not there  
  
No I never said goodbye  
And I never really told her just how much she meant to me  
No I never said goodbye  
Now its too late and shes just a memory  
How can I go on  
Now that girl is gone  
I will know until I die  
I never said goodbye
