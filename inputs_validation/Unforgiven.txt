New blood joins this earth  
And quickly hes subdued  
Through constant pain disgrace  
The young boy learns their rules  
With time the child draws in  
This whipping boy done wrong  
Deprived of all his thoughts  
The young man struggles on and on hes known  
A vow unto his own  
That never from this day  
His will theyll take away  
  
What Ive felt  
What Ive known  
Never shined through in what Ive shown  
Never be  
Never see  
Wont see what might have been  
What Ive felt  
What Ive known  
Never shined through in what Ive shown  
Never free  
Never me  
So I dub thee unforgiven  
  
They dedicate their lives  
To running all of his  
He tries to please them all  
This bitter man he is  
Throughout his life the same  
Hes battled constantly  
This fight he cannot win  
A tired man they see no longer cares  
The old man then prepares  
To die regretfully  
That old man here is me  
  
What Ive felt  
What Ive known  
Never shined through in what Ive shown  
Never be  
Never see  
Wont see what might have been  
What Ive felt  
What Ive known  
Never shined through in what Ive shown  
Never free  
Never me  
So I dub thee unforgiven  
  
What Ive felt  
What Ive known  
Never shined through in what Ive shown  
Never be  
Never see  
Wont see what might have been  
What Ive felt  
What Ive known  
Never shined through in what Ive shown  
Never free  
Never me  
So I dub thee unforgiven  
  
Never free  
Never me  
So I dub thee unforgiven  
  
You labeled me  
I labeled you  
So I dub thee unforgiven  
  
Never free  
Never me  
So I dub thee unforgiven  
  
You labeled me  
I labeled you  
So I dub thee unforgiven  
  
Never free  
Never me  
So I dub thee unforgiven
