Hangin out  
Down the street  
The same old thing  
We did last week  
  
Not a thing to do  
But talk to you  
Wow yea  
  
Mom and dad  
Live upstairs  
The musics loud  
So we dont care  
  
Nicks still young  
But rock lives on  
Oh yea  
  
Were still rockin  
In Wisconsin  
Were all alright  
Were all alright  
Yea  
Oh  
  
I Still recall  
And drive on down  
Pick you up  
And well drive around  
  
Not a thing to do  
But talk to you  
Not a thing to do  
Oh yea  
  
Were still rockin  
In Wisconsin  
Were all alright  
Were all alright  
Yea  
Oh yea oh yea  
  
hello Wisconsin
