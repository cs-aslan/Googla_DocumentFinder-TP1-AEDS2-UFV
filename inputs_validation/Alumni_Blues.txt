Woke up this morning and I had those Walking Blues x2  
I wasnt walkin nowhere cause I didnt have no floor  
  
Staring over the edge of the bed  
My old lady lying next to me I started to cry x2  
She said Im gonna take this diploma  
Im gonna slice you in the eye  
  
Well Im alright hes alright x9  
cause I got a degree  
  
Escaping through my window  
Theres a policeman on the lawn outside my home x2  
I opened my mouth to scream but my throat was full of foam  
  
So Im sittin in this cell  
My fortune dwindled to a thimble full of filth x2  
I may spend the rest of my life in jail but at least its got a floor  
  
Chorus
