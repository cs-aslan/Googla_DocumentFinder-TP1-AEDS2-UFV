Moooooove Ask the angels who theyre calling  
Go ask the angels if theyre calling to thee  
Ask the angels while theyre falling  
Who that person could possibly be  
And I know you got the feeling  
You know I feel it crawl across the floor  
And I know it got you reelin  
And honey honey the call is for war  
And its wild wild wild wild  
Everybody got the feelin  
You know the feeling and its stronger each day  
Everybody wants to be reelin  
And baby baby Ill show you the way  
And I know its hard sometimes  
You got a piece and hit across the sky  
And I know its hard sometimes  
And world war is the battle cry  
And its wild wild wild wild  
Across the country through the fields  
You know I see it written cross the sky  
People rising from the highway  
And war war is the battle cry  
And its wild wild wild wild  
Armageddon its gotten  
No savior jailer can take it from me  
World ending its just beginning  
And rock and roll is what Im born to be  
And its wild wild wild wild  
Wild wild wild wild X3  
Ask the angels if theyre startin to move  
Comin in droves in from LA  
Ask the angels if theyre starting to groove  
Lightning as armor and its today  
Its wild wild wild wild  
Wild wild wild wild X3
