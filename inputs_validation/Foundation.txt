Hello this is me to you  
Its better now were comin through  
And I dont really know just who we are  
Ill stay here till my loves full up  
So stir this cocktail shake me up  
Drink me down and take me from the bar  
Well build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
You know we got to build build it up  
Spent the night in Tumbledown  
A hundred miles from west of town  
Plans were laid no compromise was made  
Gently up to meet the blue  
Left a note and signed it True  
Those construction games were all we played  
Well build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Yeah were gonna build build it up  
Oh I know youre gonna give your best  
So more or less gotta put it to the test  
Dont you know youve got the whole world in your hands  
Surrender up and lay down your arms  
The fightin hurts but the lovin calms  
Oh I know youve got the whole world in your hands  
Well build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
You know we got to build build it up  
Well build a foundation  
Build a foundation build it up  
Build a foundation build it up  
You know we got to build
