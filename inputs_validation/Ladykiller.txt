Baby its not alright  
The second that you turn your back shell be outta sight  
Baby shell break your heart  
The second that you spend the night apart  
How could you do it  
Oh how could you walk away from everything we made  
How could you do it  
Oh you better watch yourself I think that girls insane  
  
Ooh  
Shes in it just to win it  
Dont trust her for a minute  
Ooh  
Its like a cheap thriller  
Shes such a ladykiller  
  
Baby shell eat you live  
As soon as she smells your blood in the water  
You better run to survive  
Before she makes you her latest slaughter  
How could you do it  
Oh just come back to me baby Im begging please  
How could you do it  
Oh she knows I love you still youre just her latest kill  
  
Ooh  
Shes in it just to win it  
Dont trust her for a minute  
Ooh  
Its like a cheap thriller  
Shes such a ladykiller  
  
Ooh  
Shes in it just to win it  
Dont trust her for a minute  
Ooh  
Its like a cheap thriller  
Shes such a ladykiller  
  
Ooh  
Shes in it just to win it  
Dont trust her for a minute  
Ooh  
Its like a cheap thriller  
Shes such a ladykiller
