Youve been alone  
Youve been afraid  
Ive been a fool  
In so many ways  
But I would change my life  
If you thought you might try to love me  
  
So please give me another chance  
To write you another song  
Take back those things Ive done  
Cause Ill give you my heart  
If you would let me start all over again  
  
Im not a saint  
Im just a man  
Who had heaven and earth in the palm of his hand  
But I threw it away  
So now I stand here today asking forgiveness  
And if you could just  
  
Please give me another chance  
To write you another song  
Take back those things Ive done  
Cause Ill give you my heart  
If you would let me start all over again  
  
Little girl youre all Ive got  
Dont you leave me standing here once again  
Cause Ill give you my life yes I would  
If you would let me try to love you  
  
So please give me another chance  
To write you another song  
And take back those things Ive done  
Cause Ill give you my heart  
If you would let me start all over again  
Again oh  
No no  
Oh oh  
  
You know I love you yeah  
Give me one more chance  
No no  
No no no no
