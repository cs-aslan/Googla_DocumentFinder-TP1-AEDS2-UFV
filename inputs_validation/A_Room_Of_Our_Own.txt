Youve got diamonds and Ive got spades  
Youve got pills  
And Ive got razor blades  
Youve got yoga honey  
Ive got beer  
You got overpriced  
And I got weird  
But its alright  
Were the same even though were alone  
Its alright  
Yes we all need a room of our own  
Youve got love darlin  
Ive got sex  
Youve got cash mama  
And Ive got checks  
Youve got business baby  
Ive got the kids  
You got crowded just the way I did  
But its alright  
Cause we all need a place to call home  
Its alright  
Yes we all need a room of our own  
I can still remember packed together  
Like a can of sardines  
No no no  
Pushin shovin  
Thats when lovin  
Starts to come apart at the seams  
Oh no no no no  
Youve got the day shift  
Ive got nights  
We go wrong at times  
But weve got rights  
Youve got TV shows  
Ive got crime  
But youve got your room honey  
And Ive got mine  
Its alright  
Its the one thing that we should have known  
Yes its alright  
Yes we all need a room of our own  
And its alright  
Yes we all need a place to call home  
Its alright  
Yes we all need a room of our own  
Its alright  
Its alright  
To have a room of your own  
No no no its alright  
Yeah its alright mama  
To have a room of our own  
Sometimes youve got to get away  
Got to get away  
Got to get away  
Got to get away to a room of our own  
Got to have a room  
Got to have a little elbow room of my own
