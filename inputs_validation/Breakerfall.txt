Theres a girl on a ledge shes got nowhere to turn  
Cause all the love that she had was just wood that she burned  
Now her life is on fire its no ones concern  
She can blame the world or prey till dawn  
  
But only love can break her fall  
Break her fall  
Yeah only love can break her fall fall  
  
Its like she lost her invitation to the party on earth  
And shes standing outside hating everyone here  
Yeah shes her own disease crying to her doll  
  
But only love can break her fall  
Break her fall  
Only love can break her fall Yeah  
  
Yeah fall the world is her fall break her fall  
Love love love can break her fall  
Now only love can break her fall  
Love love love can break her fall fall  
Love love can break her fall  
Only love can break her
