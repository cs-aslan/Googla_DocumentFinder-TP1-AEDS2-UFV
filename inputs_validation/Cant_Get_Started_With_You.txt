Ive been around the world in a plane  
Ive settled revolutions in Spain  
The North Pole I have charted  
But man I cant get started with you  
And at the golf course Im under par  
MetroGoldwyn wants me to star  
Ive got a house and a show place  
But cant get no place with you  
  
Youre so supreme  
The lyrics I write of you  
Dream dream day and night of you  
Scheme just for the sight of you  
Baby but what good dose it do  
Ive been consulted by Franklin D  
Even Gabel had me to tea  
But now Im broken hearted  
Cant get started with you  
  
Youre so supreme  
The lyrics I write of you  
Dream dream day and night of you  
Scheme just for the sight of you  
But what good does it do  
Ive been consulted by Franklin D  
Even Basic had me to tea  
But now Im broken hearted  
Cant get started with you
