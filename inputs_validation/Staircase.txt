I walk down the staircase  
Magnetic pull  
Back to the other place  
That I cannot go  
Im sending a chopper  
To steal you away  
  
The pot is full  
Let me take control  
Let me take control  
  
The pot is full  
Of secrets to be told  
Secrets to be told  
  
Out of orbit  
And I always will  
  
The pot is full  
Let me take control  
Let me take control  
  
The pot is full  
Of secrets to be told  
Secrets to be told
