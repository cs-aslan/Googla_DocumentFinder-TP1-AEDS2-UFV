Bang bang banging in your head  
Youre banging on the walls  
Hang hang hanging up yourself  
Youre hanging by your balls  
  
And you you die but noone hears or cares  
And hopes the rope that keeps you tied in knots  
  
The torture never stops  
The torture never stops  
  
Suck suck sucking at your life  
Your master sucks the juice  
Shoot shoot shooting at you  
And the hangmans noose is loose  
  
And you you cry but noone hears or cares  
And hopes the rope that keeps you tied in knots  
  
The torture never stops  
The torture never stops  
  
Your masters beat you bloody  
Still youre running back for more  
And every day you lay down and play the whore  
  
The torture never stops  
The torture never stops
