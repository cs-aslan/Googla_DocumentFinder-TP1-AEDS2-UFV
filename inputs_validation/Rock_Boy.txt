Get up get up get up  
Get up get up get up  
Get up get up get up  
Get up get up get up  
  
Paparazzi flashin  
You jump on the stage  
Sittin in the crowd  
And Im watchin Im watchin  
Baby  
  
Groupies in the back  
Youre under attack  
Theyre screamin your name  
But I dont give a damn  
Cause I like it I like it  
I like it I like it  
  
Chorus  
Turn the spotlight on  
Move a little shred your guitar  
Youre my dirty rock boy  
Turn the mic way up  
Sweat a little ownin the crowd  
Youre my dirty rock boy  
  
Get up get up get up  
Are you ready to roll my rock boy  
Get up get up get up  
Are you ready to roll my rock boy  
Get up get up get up  
Are you ready to roll my rock boy  
Get up get up get up  
Are you ready to roll my rock boy  
  
Finishin your encore  
And sippin champagne  
A rock star rock star  
You make me so hot  
  
Body burnin up the fever  
Dont make me wait  
Meet me in your dressing room  
I want it want it want it  
I want it I want it  
  
Chorus  
  
The second that I saw you I could feel an attraction  
Play me like a guitar and get into action  
The second that I saw you I could feel an attraction  
Play me like a guitar and swing swing swing swing  
  
Chorus
