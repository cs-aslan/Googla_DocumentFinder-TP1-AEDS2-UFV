Im standing on your doorstep  
And I dont know what to do  
Should I ring your doorbell or just walk away  
My friends all say that you were never true  
Im hiding in the shadows  
  
I hear the music coming out of your radio  
Are you there with another guy instead of me  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I hear the laughter and theres something Ive got to know  
Are you there with another guy instead of me  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
I only know I love you and I couldnt say goodbye  
So if theres another I dont want to know  
If you should go I would surely die  
Im hiding in the shadows  
  
And I see two silhouettes in back of your window shade  
Are you there with another guy when I am gone  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I cant believe youd break the promises that you made  
If youre there with another guy I cant go on oh no  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
You would never leave me hurt me or deceive me  
Im a fool to doubt you worry so about you  
Love requires faith Ive got a lot of faith but  
I hear the music coming out of your radio  
  
I only know I love you and I couldnt say goodbye  
So if theres another I dont want to know  
If you should go I would surely die  
Im hiding in the shadows
