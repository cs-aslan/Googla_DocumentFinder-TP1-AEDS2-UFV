Set in overdrive makin money on the side  
Lookin for some dirty action  
Leave em on the floor  
Leave em wantin more  
Use it for the prime reaction  
  
Workin like a dog  
Tired cold and bored  
Stimulate me to satisfaction  
Alcohol and sluts  
Pull me from my rut  
Second only to the attraction  
  
You got a lot to learn  
Your heads up your ass  
You got a lot to learn  
You got no class  
  
No class  
  
Take me to the top never never stop  
So pretty whats your name where ya from  
I see you like the band  
Dont leave me with my hand  
Stick around Ill throw you a bone  
  
No class  
  
Crack another beer sit on over here  
What I need I cant do alone  
Think that Im in love sittin in your glove  
Whats your name here I come out Im done  
  
Why dont you use your head
