Show me how to lie  
Youre getting better all the time  
And turning all against the one  
Is an art thats hard to teach  
Another clever word  
Sets off an unsuspecting herd  
And as you step back into line  
A mob jumps to their feet  
  
Now dance fucker dance  
Man he never had a chance  
And no one even knew  
It was really only you  
  
And now you steal away  
Take him out today  
Nice work you did  
Youre gonna go far kid  
  
With a thousand lies  
And a good disguise  
Hit em right between the eyes  
Hit em right between the eyes  
When you walk away  
Nothing more to say  
See the lightning in your eyes  
See em running for their lives  
  
Slowly out of line  
And drifting closer in your sights  
So play it out Im wide awake  
Its a scene about me  
Theres something in your way  
And now someone is gonna pay  
And if you cant get what you want  
Well its all because of me  
  
Now dance fucker dance  
Man I never had a chance  
And no one even knew  
It was really only you  
  
And now youll lead the way  
Show the light of day  
Nice work you did  
Youre gonna go far kid trust deceived  
  
With a thousand lies  
And a good disguise  
Hit em right between the eyes  
Hit em right between the eyes  
When you walk away  
Nothing more to say  
See the lightning in your eyes  
See em running for their lives  
  
Now dance fucker dance  
He never had a chance  
And no one even knew  
It was really only you  
  
So dance fucker dance  
I never had a chance  
It was really only you  
  
With a thousand lies  
And a good disguise  
Hit em right between the eyes  
Hit em right between the eyes  
When you walk away  
Nothing more to say  
See the lightning in your eyes  
See em running for their lives  
  
Clever alibis Lord of the flies  
Hit em right between the eyes  
Hit em right between the eyes  
When you walk away  
Nothing more to say  
See the lightning in your eyes  
See em running for their lives
