Itchy itchy goo  
Got me thinking of you  
Itchy goo itchy goo  
Oh baby i love you  
Itchy goo itchy goo itchy goo goo goo  
Its all i want to do whammo  
Itchy itchy goo  
Theres a pile next to you  
Itchy goo itchy goo  
And its turnin blue  
Itchy goo itchy goo itchy goo goo goo

You got me running in circles  
Like a peepee baby  
Im so happy i just want to die  
Cause this baby love

Move on over  
Satisfy my urges

You got me running in circles  
Like a bigbig baby
