Small simple safe price  
Rise the wake and carry me with all of my regrets  
This is not a small cut that scabs and dries and flakes and heals  
And I am not afraid to die  
Im not afraid to bleed and fuck and fight  
I want the pain of payment  
Whats left but a section of pigmy size cuts  
Much like a slew of a thousand unwanted fucks  
Would you be my little cut  
Would you be my thousand fucks  
And make mark leaving space for the guilt to be liquid  
To fill and spill over and under my thoughts  
My sad sorry selfish cry out to the cutter  
Im cutting trying to picture your black broken heart  
Love is not like anything  
Especially a fucking knife  
  
Look at me you can tell  
By the way I move and do my hair  
Do you think that its me  
Or its not me I dont even care  
Im alive I smell  
Im the cleanest I have ever been  
I feel big I feel tall I feel dry  
Dry  
  
Just look at me  
Look at me now  
Im a fake Im a fake Im a fake Im a fake  
Just look at me  
Look at me now  
Im a fake Im a fake Im a fake Im a fake  
  
Do I drink Do I date  
I got perfect placements all my inks  
Satisfied in your eyes  
Im the biggest fan I got right now  
I made sure I looked how I wanted to look  
The people around me the people surround me  
I feel big I feel tall I feel dry  
Dry  
  
Just look at me  
Look at me now  
Im a fake Im a fake Im a fake Im a fake  
Just look at me  
Look at me now  
Im a fake Im a fake Im a fake Im a fake
