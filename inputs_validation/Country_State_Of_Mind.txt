That hot old summer sun make you beg for your next breath  
So you best be on the creek bank laid in the shade  
Chewin on a hickory twig pass that bottle Ill have me a swig  
I aint got a lot but I think I got it made in the shade  
  
Im just laid up here in a country state of mind  
Catchin these fish like theyre goin out of style  
Drinkin this homemade wine  
Hey if the sun dont come up tomorrow  
People Ive had a good time  
Im just laid up here in a country state of mind  
  
I bet the old mans in the kitchen  
Hes got my kind of music on his radio  
Oh drinkin his beer and dialin up the request line  
Momma and old Aunt Joan  
Probably in the dining room tryin to use the phone  
Me Im thinkin about that girl and later tonight  
Oh yeah  
  
Im just laid up here in a country state of mind  
Hey Im atchin these fish like theyre goin out of style  
Im drinkin this homemade wine  
And if the sun dont come up tomorrow  
People Ive had a good time  
Im just laid up here in a country state of mind  
  
You know the red necks and the hippies  
They are in their discos and honkytonks  
Somewhere between raising hell and amazing grace  
Lord I know just how they feel  
You gotta get out and kick up your heels  
And aint it great to be livin in the usa  
  
Me Im laid up here in a country state of mind  
Catchin these fish like theyre goin out of style  
And drinkin this homemade wine all the time  
If the sun dont shine tomorrow  
People I have had a good time  
Im just laid up here in a country state of mind  
I know where Hank Jr is  
  
Yodelayeeoh yodelayeeoh  
Yodelayeehee  
Hee hee
