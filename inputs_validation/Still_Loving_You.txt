Time it needs time  
To win back your love again  
I will be there I will be there  
Love only love  
Can bring back your love someday  
I will be there I will be there  
  
Ill fight babe Ill fight  
To win back your love again  
I will be there I will be there  
Love only love  
Can break down the wall someday  
I will be there I will be there  
  
If wed go again  
All the way from the start  
I would try to change  
The things that killed our love  
Your pride has built a wall so strong  
That I cant get through  
Is there really no chance  
To start once again  
Im loving you  
  
Try baby try  
To trust in my love again  
I will be there I will be there  
Love our love  
Just shouldnt be thrown away  
I will be there I will be there  
  
If wed go again  
All the way from the start  
I would try to change  
The things that killed our love  
Your pride has built a wall so strong  
That I cant get through  
Is there really no chance  
To start once again  
  
If wed go again  
All the way from the start  
I would try to change  
The things that killed our love  
Yes Ive hurt your pride and I know  
What youve been through  
You should give me a chance  
This cant be the end  
Im still loving you  
Im still loving you I need your love  
Im still loving you
