You look for sun and I look for rain  
Were different people were not the same  
The power of the sun  
  
I looked for treetops you looked for caps  
Above the water where the waves snap back  
I flew around the world to bring you back  
Ah the power of the heart  
  
You looked at me and I looked at you  
The sleeping heart was shining through  
The wispy cobwebs that were breathing through  
The power of the heart  
  
I looked at you and you looked at me  
I thought of the past you thought of what could be  
I asked you once again to marry me  
The power of the heart  
  
Everybody says love makes the world go round  
I hear a bubbling and I hear a sound  
Of my heart beating and I turn around  
  
And find you standing at the door  
You know me I like to dream a lot  
Of this and that and what is not  
And finally I figured out what was what  
  
It was the power of the heart  
You and me we sweat and strain  
The result is always the same  
You think somehow were in a game  
The power of the heart  
The power of the heart  
  
I think Im dumb I know youre smart  
The beating of a purebred heart  
I say this to you and its not a lark  
Marry me today  
  
You know me I like to dream a lot  
Of what there is and what theres not  
But mainly I dream of you a lot  
The power of your heart  
The power of the heart
