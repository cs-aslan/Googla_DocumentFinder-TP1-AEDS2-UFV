Well I aint got much time so Ill get to the point  
Do you wanna share a ride and get the fuck out of this joint  
Ive got an impulse so impulsive that it burns  
I wanna break your heart until it makes your stomach churn  
  
I got to know if youre the one that got away  
Even though it was never meant to be  
  
Say youll stay the night  
Because were running out of time  
So stay the night  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
Say youll stay the night  
Because were running out of time  
So stay the night  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
  
Im just sick and tired of feeling so alone  
I dont understand the point if you have to go home  
So wont you stay and count the circles round my eyes  
And we can watch the stars until the sun begins to rise  
  
I got to know if youre the one one that got away  
Even though it was never meant to be  
  
Say youll stay the night  
Because were running out of time  
So stay the night  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
Say youll stay the night  
Because were running out of time  
So stay the night  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
  
I got to know if youre the one one that got away  
Even though it was never meant to be  
  
Say youll stay the night  
Because were running out of time  
So stay the night  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
Say youll stay the night  
Because were running out of time  
So stay the night  
I dont wanna say goodbye
