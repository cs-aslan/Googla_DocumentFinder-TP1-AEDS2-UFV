Yeah yeaaayh yeah heh yeah heh yeah heh  
See the road to hell is paved with good intentions  
Cant you tell the way they have to mention  
Have they helped you out youre such a hopeless victim  
Please dont do me any favors Mr Intentional  
All their talk seasoned to perfection  
The road they walk commanding your affection  
They need to be needed deceived by motivation  
An opportunity to further situation  
Why they so important is without explanation  
Please dont patrionize me Mr Intentional  
Oh ohhh ohh ohhh  
We give rise to ego by being insecure  
The advice that we go desperatly searching for  
The subconscious effort to support our paramour  
To engage in denial to admit were immature  
Validating lies Mr Intentional  
Open up yours eyes Mr Intentional  
Stuck in a system that seeks to suck your blood  
Held emotionally hostage by what everybody does  
Counting all the money that you give them just because  
Exploiting ignorance in the name of love  
Stop before you drop because thats just the way it was  
Please dont justify me Mr Intentional  
Oh undementional Mr Intentional  
Ohhh oh dont you do me any favors  
Ohhh ohhhh ohh ohhhh  
Wake up youve been sleeping  
Take up your bed and walk  
Stop blaming other people  
Oh its nobody elses fault  
Except the truth about you  
You know that life goes on without you  
And your expensive misinventions  
Disguising your intentions  
Dont worship my hurt feelings Mr Intentional  
Oh oh oh oh  
See I know you cant help me Mr Intentional  
The only help I need to live is unprofessional  
The only wealth I have to give is not material  
And if you need much more than that Im not available  
Please dont entertain me Mr Intentional  
Oh I dont need your sympthy Mr Intentional  
Stay away from me Mr Intentional  
So undementional Mr Promotional Mr Emotional Mr Intentional  
Ohhh ohhhh ohhhh
