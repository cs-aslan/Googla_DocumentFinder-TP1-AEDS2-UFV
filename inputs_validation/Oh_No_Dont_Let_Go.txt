Oh no dont let go  all I need is a little more time  
Oh no dont let go  everything is gonna be fine  
I just need some time  
Give me a little more time  so dont let go  
Oh well night after night Im a little confused  
I cant seem to get it right still I might  
With a little assistance and a piece of your love  
Get closer to your heart  
Well at least it would be a start  so dont let go  
Oh no dont let go  all I need is a little more time  
Oh no dont let go  everything is gonna be fine  
I just need some time  
Give me a little more time  so dont let go  
Well Ill try  I mean I will attempt to negotiate  
This little incline   
Whoops theres a hill and another spectacular chance  
For me to be   
Once again with you and I know Ill make it through  
So dont let go  
Oh no dont let go  all I need is a little more time  
Oh no dont let go  everything is gonna be fine  
I just need some time  
Give me a little more time  so dont let go
