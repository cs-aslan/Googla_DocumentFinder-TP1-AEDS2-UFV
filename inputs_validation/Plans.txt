Brush your hair to some Eurodisco trash  
Two prophylactics and fortyfive dollars cash  
Corduroy jacket and some fifty buck shoes  
That can lead like a lamp when theyre a scrubbing up new  
Sunday best on a Friday night alright  
Ill meet you at the corner beneath the Goodyear foot sign  
Where all dates are made by mobile  
Ill send you a smoke signal just be there by nine  
  
This smoke I left it for you  
To show Mum and Dad your new tattoo alright  
So theyre my plans howd they fit with you  
  
Theres a streetlight for each night your heart hit the deck  
This drink says I love you this drink says I couldnt care less  
Kiss me so I know Im alive  
The drinks taste crap but they keep coming til five  
  
Numbers on the wall I got my ears like a shell  
The phone stinks of chips cheap wine mouthwash and gel  
Cmon well drink the last of the rent  
And Ill leave my number right down on the strap of your dress  
  
And its late and shes Sue  
cause I read it on the back of her boyfriends neck alright  
So theyre my plans howd they fit with you  
  
Yeah I had a plan but howd it fit with you
