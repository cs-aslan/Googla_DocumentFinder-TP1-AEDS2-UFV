First when I came to the town  
They called me young and bonny  
Now theyve changed my name  
Called me the leaboys honey  
  
Ill dye my petticoats red  
And Ill face them with a yellow  
Ill tell the dyester lads  
That the leaboys Ive to follow  
  
Its over hills and dales  
And over dykes and ditches  
Say will I like the lad  
Who wears the moleskin breeches  
  
The black horse draws the cart  
And hes as proud as any  
Say will I like the lad  
That drives them on so canny  
  
Feather beds are fine  
And painted rooms are bonny  
But I would leave them all  
To jog away with johnny  
  
Oh for saturday night  
Its I thatll see my dearie  
Hell come whistlin in  
When I am tired and weary  
  
First when I came to the town  
They called me proud and saucy  
Now theyve changed my name  
Called me the leaboys lassie
