Youre just too good to be true  
Cant take my eyes off you  
Youd be like Heaven to touch  
I wanna hold you so much  
At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God Im alive  
Youre just too good to be true  
Cant take my eyes off you  
  
Pardon the way that I stare  
Theres nothing else to compare  
The sight of you leaves me weak  
There are no words left to speak  
But if you feel like I feel  
Please let me know that its real  
Youre just too good to be true  
Cant take my eyes off you  
  
I love you baby  
And if its quite alright  
I need you baby  
To warm a lonely night  
I love you baby  
Trust in me when I say  
Oh pretty baby  
Dont bring me down I pray  
Oh pretty baby now that I found you stay  
And let me love you baby  
Let me love you  
  
Youre just too good to be true  
Cant take my eyes off you  
Youd be like Heaven to touch  
I wanna hold you so much  
At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God Im alive  
Youre just too good to be true  
Cant take my eyes off you  
  
I love you baby  
And if its quite alright  
I need you baby  
To warm a lonely night  
I love you baby  
Trust in me when I say  
Oh pretty baby  
Dont bring me down I pray  
Oh pretty baby now that I found you stay
