Take it easy with me please  
Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze  
Take your time make it slow  
Andante Andante  
Just let the feeling grow  
  
Make your fingers soft and light  
Let your body be the velvet of the night  
Touch my soul you know how  
Andante Andante  
Go slowly with me now  
  
Im your music  
I am your music and I am your song  
Im your song  
I am your music and I am your song  
Play me time and time again and make me strong  
Play me again cause youre making me strong  
Make me sing make me sound  
You make me sing and you make me  
Andante Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground  
Andante Andante  
Oh please dont let me down  
  
Theres a shimmer in your eyes  
Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies  
Please dont talk go on play  
Andante Andante  
And let me float away  
  
Im your music  
I am your music and I am your song  
Im your song  
I am your music and I am your song  
Play me time and time again and make me strong  
Play me again cause youre making me strong  
Make me sing make me sound  
You make me sing and you make me  
Andante Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground  
Andante Andante  
Oh please dont let me down  
  
Make me sing make me sound  
You make me sing and you make me  
Andante Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground  
Andante Andante  
Oh please dont let me down  
Andante Andante  
Oh please dont let me down
