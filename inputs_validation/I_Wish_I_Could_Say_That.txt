Hello it was good to get your call  
You havent changed at all  
Youre the same as far as I can tell  
No way I see something in your face  
Someones filled the empty space in your life  
Well Im glad to hear youre doing well  
  
I wish I could say that but Id be lying  
Im still not over the fact  
That you stopped trying  
It was easy for you to just let go  
Of all we had  
I wish I could say that  
  
What Do you mean theres no one new  
Its my memory haunting you  
Now you want the things we had back then  
Inside theres a part of you  
Thats still loving me and always will  
til the end  
And youd like to see us try again  
  
I wish I could say that
