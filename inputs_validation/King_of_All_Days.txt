In your surrender  
As you lay down your life  
You took up a sinners cross  
And your live rescued mine  
  
In this redemption  
Love and mercy display  
Lifting my eyes to see  
That your truth never fails  
  
Lord of the heavens  
King of all days  
Without you my world slips away  
Redeemed by your mercy  
Consumed by your grace  
Now I live for you  
  
Im found in the arms of love  
Your love it has saved my soul  
Ill run to your arms of love  
Your lifes gonna lead me home  
  
Glorious savior  
In your light I am free  
If things of this world will fail  
Still youre all that I need  
  
Lord of the heavens  
King of all days  
Without you my world slips away  
Redeemed by your mercy  
Consumed by your grace  
Now I live for you  
  
Im found in the arms of love  
Your love it has saved my soul  
Ill run to your arms of love  
Your lifes gonna lead me home  
  
And at your cross  
I lay my burden  
At your feet  
Where your love covers  
All Ive done  
Now I walk with you lord  
  
Im found in the arms of love  
For your love it has saved my soul  
Ill run to your arms of love  
Your lifes gonna lead me home
