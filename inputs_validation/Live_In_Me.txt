Theres a feeling I just cant deny  
Its fire straight from my soul  
And its hot enough to tear you up  
Make you lose control  
  
Gonna soothe you put you in a trance  
And get your sense aroused  
So there aint no use in holdin back  
Gotta let that feelin out  
  
Chorus  
Live in me come in my life  
Fill me with all that sweet delight  
Im burnin up steamin inside  
So give me the love I need tonight  
  
Foolin round you got no time to waste  
So baby turn out the light  
And lets get down to what it takes  
To keep me satisfied  
Dont give me dreams I dont want to know  
Cause I need something to hold  
And action speaks more tenderness  
Than words could ever show so  
  
Chorus  
  
Groove with the motion  
Lets take it to the top  
Ride with the feeling  
Theres no way Im gonna stop  
Ill give you heaven  
To help you through the day  
And super lovin  
Takes your breath away  
  
Live in me just live in me  
Come in my life come in my life  
Fill me with all that sweet delight  
Fill me with love that sweet delight  
Im burnin up steamin inside  
Im burnin up steamin inside  
So give me the love I need tonight  
Just give me love I need tonight
