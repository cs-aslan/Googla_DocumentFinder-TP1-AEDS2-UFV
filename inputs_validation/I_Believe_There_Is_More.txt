You have been good to me  
You have been good to me  
You have been gracious  
You have been faithful  
Meeting my needs  
Lord its so plain to see  
You have been good to me  
I have been given so much I cant even  
Begin to thank You  
  
Chorus  
And still I believe there is more  
I believe there is more  
I believe  
So open my hands to receive  
All that Your love has in store  
Lord I believe  
  
Everything I have done  
All that Ive said and sung  
Lifting Your story giving You glory  
Thats just the beginning  
Father I know there is more  
Power to heal and restore  
Miracles wonders blessings unnumbered  
Love neverending  
  
Chorus  
  
Exceeding abundantly  
More than our minds can imagine  
Love overflowing  
You are bestowing  
Day after day after day  
  
Verse  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
Lord I believe  
Lord I believe  
Lord I believe
