Its there in the eyes of the children  
In the faces smiling in the windows  
You can come on out come on open the doors  
Brush away the tears of freedom  
  
Now were here theres no turning back  
We have each other  
We have one voice  
  
Hand in hand we will lay the tracks  
Because the train is coming to carry you home  
  
Come dance with me  
Come on and dance into the light  
Everybody dance into the light  
  
Therell be no more hiding in shadows of fear  
Therell be no more chains to hold you  
The future is yours  you hold the key  
And there are no walls with freedom  
  
Now were here we wont go back  
We are one world  
We have one voice  
  
Side by side we are not afraid  
Because the train is coming to carry you home  
  
Come dance with me  
Come on and dance into the light  
Everybody dance into the light  
  
Do you see the sun its a brand new day  
Oh the worlds in your hands now use it  
Whats past is past dont turn around  
Brush away the cobwebs of freedom  
  
Now were here theres no turning back  
You have each other  
You have one voice  
  
Hand in hand you can lay the tracks  
Because the train is coming to carry you home  
  
Come dance with me  
Come on and dance into the light  
Everybody dance into the light
