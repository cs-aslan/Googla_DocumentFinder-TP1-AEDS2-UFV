I wasnt made to understand  
Ive given up my name forgotten where I stand  
Sometimes I dont know who I am I used to feel so scared  
I used to hold your hand  
Im so sick of playing favorites sick of being scared  
  
They would rather see you all alone  
Imaginary enemy  
We are much less different than we know  
Imaginary enemy imaginary enemy  
I would never leave you all alone  
Imaginary enemy Ha  
  
I will not ever understand  
Just how it got this way and how it got so bad  
Youre not a part of what we need There is no common ground  
We hate what you believe  
Im so sick of playing favorites sick of being scared  
  
They would rather see you all alone  
Imaginary enemy  
We are much less different than we know  
Imaginary enemy imaginary enemy  
I would never leave you all alone  
Imaginary enemy  
  
Who taught me to hate you when I dont even know you  
Who created the enemy  
Who taught me to hate you when I dont even know you  
Who taught me to hate you hate you hate you  
  
Who created the enemy  
  
Who created  
  
They would rather see you all alone  
Imaginary enemy  
We are much less different than we know  
Imaginary enemy imaginary enemy  
I would never leave you all alone  
Imaginary enemy  
  
Who created the enemy
