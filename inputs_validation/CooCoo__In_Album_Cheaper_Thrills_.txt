Oh the cuckoo shes a pretty bird and she warbles when she flies  
But she never hollers cuckoo till the fourth day of July  
Im a rambler Im a gambler and I lay my money down  
But I never start gamblin when the cuckoo birds around round  
Oh the cuckoo shes a pretty bird and she warbles when she flies  
But she never hollers cuckoo till the fourth day of July  
Said Jack oDiamonds well Jack oDiamonds Lord I know you of old  
Honey you robbed me of my silver and out of my gold
