He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way  
He had a boogie style that no one else could play  
He was the top man at his craft  
But then his number came up and he was gone with the draft  
Hes in the army now ablowin reveille  
Hes the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B  
  
They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam  
It really brought him down because he couldnt jam  
The captain seemed to understand  
Because the next day the cap went out and drafted a band  
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille  
Hes the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B  
  
Atoot atoot atootdiddleyadatoot  
He blows it eighttothebar in boogie rhythm  
He cant blow a note unless the bass and guitar is playin with him  
He makes the company jump when he plays reveille  
Hes the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B  
  
He was our boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B  
And when he plays boogie woogie bugle he was buzy as a bzz bee  
And when he plays he makes the company jump eighttothebar  
Hes the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B  
  
Toottoottoot tootdiddleyada tootdiddleyada  
Toot toot he blows it eighttothebar  
He cant blow a note if the bass and guitar isnt with him  
Aaaand the company jumps when he plays reveille  
Hes the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B  
  
He puts the boys asleep with boogie every night  
And wakes em up the same way in the early bright  
They clap their hands and stamp their feet  
Because they know how he plays when someone gives him a beat  
He really breaks it up when he plays reveille  
Hes the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
