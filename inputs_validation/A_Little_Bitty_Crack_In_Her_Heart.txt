Shattered inside and scattered around  
Were pieces of her broken heart  
I gathered her up the pieces I found  
I put her back together like a busted guitar  
But some glue holds and some glue dont In spite of everything I tried  
Somebodys stole my darlin  
Right before my very eyes  
  
He didnt walk talk or push his way in  
Or fly through the windows on a gust of hot wind  
He didnt sprout wings  
And he sure wasnt playin no harp  
As low as he was I couldnt see him  
Slitherin around in the dark  
He mustve crawled through  
A little bitty crack in her heart  
  
Copin with hone and hoping im wrong  
But I sure see a definite change  
Theres look in her eyes thats sayin goodbye  
And her snuggle when I hold her dont feel the same  
The way her heart bests for that sneaky thief  
You would picture him dark and tall  
But the feller that stole my darlin  
Lord hed have to be very small  
  
He didnt walk talk or push his way in  
Or fly through the windows on a gust of hot wind  
He didnt sprout wings  
And he sure wasnt playin no harp  
As low as he was I couldnt see him  
Slitherin around in the dark  
He mustve crawled through  
A little bitty crack in her heart  
  
As low as he was I couldnt see him  
Slitherin around in the dark  
He mustve crawled through  
A little bitty crack in her heart  
Lord he mustve craweled through  
A little bitty crack in her heart
