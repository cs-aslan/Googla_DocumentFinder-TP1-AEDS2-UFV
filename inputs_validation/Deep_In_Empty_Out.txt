Yeah I hear the hum in my ear  
It keeps me awake sometimes  
I can deal with most everything  
Im out of my mind  
When youre out of my side  
I would give everything  
Deep in and empty out  
I would give everything you want  
Everything you need  
Why cant you talk to me  
I hear your voice everywhere else  
Oh why do you have to be  
Slumped and drunk  
Just to say I am your friend  
Id give you everything  
Yeah Im deep in and empty out  
Oh I would give everything you want  
Everything you need  
Everything means nothing to me  
I remember now  
You not me  
I remember now  
You fail  
Yeah I remember now  
You not me  
I remember everything everything  
Yeah yeah  
I remember everything everything  
I would give everything  
Yeah deep in and empty out  
I would give everything you want  
Anything to you  
Everything means nothing  
Yeah everything means nothing  
Yeah everything means nothing to me  
Its true  
My everything means nothing to you  
Its true
