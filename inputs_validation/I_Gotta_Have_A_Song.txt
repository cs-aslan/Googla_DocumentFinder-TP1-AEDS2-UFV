Got no place to be  
No ones needing me  
My girl just said were through  
Love was here to stay  
Only yesterday  
Today my world is blue  
So show me to where theres music  
Show me to where theres music  
With music I just might go on  
I gotta have a song  
To go it alone  
A happy happy song  
Had a happy home  
Now its turned to stone  
Kitchens cold and bare  
Shed cook all day for me  
I still hurry home to see  
But I know that shes not there  
So show me to where theres music  
Show me to where theres music  
With music I just might go on  
I gotta have a song  
To go it alone  
A happy happy song  
Show me to where theres music  
Show me to where theres music  
With music I just cant go wrong  
I gotta have a song  
To go it alone  
A happy happy song
