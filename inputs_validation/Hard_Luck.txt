Oh Im really feeling mighty low  
No no no I got no place that I can go  
So Ive got some blues to sing  
And oh so much remembering woe  
  
Black cats keep away from me  
Take my advice go shinning up a tree  
I got hard luck the hardest kind a luck youll find  
I aint lyin Ive got the bluest kinda blues  
Drivin me right outta my mind  
  
Shes gone said toodleloo  
Kissed her goodbye and mymy my money too  
Ive got hard luck the hardest kinda luck youve seen  
I mean the way Im runnin lately  
My lucky number is thirteen  
  
Where do I belong everything I do is wrong all wrong  
Wrong as can be  
Whos stacking all the decks lady luck has got the hex on me  
Im on her knee  
  
Shove off oh Im warning you  
This thing I caught you know could be catchin too  
Ive got hard luck the hardest kinda luck there can be  
Yes siree I guess hard luck always chooses  
Natural born losers like me
