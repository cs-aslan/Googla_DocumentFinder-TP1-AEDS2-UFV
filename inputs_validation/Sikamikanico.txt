Everybody knows about Hollywood skunks  
Soulfull sex and funky monks  
My tencil town is made of steel  
Lets whimp lets shout lets make a deal

Feel so alive dont know where to stop  
Are you def or dumb or what  
  
Silly little creature Sikamikanico  
Sittin on a bleature Sikamikanico

Ill never gonna overcome in Hollywood Ill come alone  
Oh no it would now leave my nose that you blow
