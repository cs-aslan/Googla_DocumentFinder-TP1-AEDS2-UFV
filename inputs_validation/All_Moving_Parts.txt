Super animation turning on a nation  
And theyre saying  
All moving parts stand still  
Since he was elected  
Adrenaline injected  
Hear him saying  
All moving parts should kill  
Just like the hero  
Hes got them all on the run  
Yes hes won yeah yeah  
Since he passed the motion  
Theyre building in the ocean  
And hes saying all men  
Should all be free  
What a combination peace and radiation  
And hes saying free men  
Should fight for me  
Just like his mammal  
He seems to get his pleasure  
From pain and the rain  
Aint that strange  
Very strange yeah  
I like choking toys  
Youve got to see me before  
You meet the boys  
Teachers burnt the school  
Hes had enough of sticking  
To the rules alright  
People stop and see  
Hes got to be more decadent than me  
Just to pass the time  
He gets his kicks from  
Licking off the wine  
Pretty silly ladies  
All Cynthias and Sadies  
Call him on and he  
Takes their numbers down  
Says he is a woman  
I should have seen it coming  
And shes saying  
Shes married to a clown  
Just like a lady  
Shell keep guessing  
Through the night  
Not tonight well I might oh alright yeah
