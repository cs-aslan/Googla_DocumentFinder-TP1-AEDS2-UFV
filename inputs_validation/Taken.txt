Should I try to take you in  
Another fool brought to the fold  
With not a gaze or arms  
but deathlike grip to hold  
To hold Repeat x3  
  
Should I try to take you in  
And hope for the perfect docile pet  
Hope that youll not defile or wreck my home  
Sweet home Repeat x3  
  
Chorus  
Here theres only faith no doubt  
You can be taken anywhere  
Here is where you choose the place  
With pleasure and pain in equal share  
A refuge for truth and deceit  
Where all who come are taken in  
  
Should I try to take you in  
Pretending what you have not felt  
In passion sorrow sleep or death eyes closed  
Eyes closed Repeat x3  
  
Here theres only faith no doubt  
You can be taken anywhere  
Here is where you choose the place  
With pleasure and pain in equal share  
A refuge for truth and deceit  
Where all who come are taken in  
  
Should I try to take you in  
Wholl pity me if I forget  
Its said to be and not to be in love  
Is to regret  
Regret Repeat x3  
  
Chorus  
  
Should I try to take you in  
Wholl pity me in my regret  
For those whove never been in love  
Need not forget  
Forget  
Forget
