A year ago today  
Was when you went away  
But now you come back knockin on my door  
And you say youre back to stay  
But I say  
Go cry  
On somebody elses shoulder  
Im somewhat wiser now  
And one whole year older  
I sure dont need you now  
And I dont love you  
Anymore  
You cheated me baby  
And told some dirty lies about me  
Fooled around with all those other guys  
Thats why I had to set you free  
I sure dont need you now  
And I dont love you  
Anymore  
A year ago today  
You went away  
And now you come back crying  
Crying crying please let me in  
But I dont need you  
No I dont love you anymore  
So go lean ongo cry on  
Somebody elses door  
Go cry  
On somebody elses shoulder  
Im somewhat wiser now  
And one whole year older  
I sure dont need you now  
And I dont love you  
Anymore oh my darling  
spoken  
Go ahead and cry  
Go ahead and let the tears fall outa your eye  
Let em fall on your dress  
Who cares if it makes a mess  
I gave you my high school ring  
At the root beer stand  
We had a teenage love baby  
I thought it was sharp  
It was really so grandbut  
You cheated me baby  
And told some dirty lies about me  
Fooled around with all those other guys  
Thats why I had to get my khakis pressed  
I sure dont need you now  
And I dont love you  
Anymore  
spoken  
Baby I love you so much darling  
Why dont you dig me  
I dig you  
But you dont dig me  
I dont understand what it is  
I had my car reupholstered  
I got my hair processed  
I got a nice pompadour job on it  
I bought a new pair of shoes  
I got some new khakis and I met you  
And we went out to get a cocacola
