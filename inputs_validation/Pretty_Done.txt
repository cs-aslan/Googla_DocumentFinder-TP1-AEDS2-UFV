So you got the thing you wanted  
Dont let it go  
Though it hurts your hand to hold it  
Dont let it show  
  
Im pretty done  
Once a favored son  
Im pretty done  
Slap me round for fun  
  
Finding no pleasant changes  
In old enemies  
Not a lead a bit part playing  
In my story  
  
Im pretty done  
Once a favored son  
Im pretty done  
Slap me round for fun  
  
I dont care to further amuse you  
Never had you how could I lose you  
Paid in full I owe no one at all  
  
Im supposed to smile and ignore it  
Better than some  
High roads are to fall from  
Already hung  
  
Im pretty done  
Once a favored son  
Im pretty done  
Slap me round for fun  
  
Pushing towards hopeless mission  
Curiosity omission  
History colored since the fall  
  
Im pretty done  
Im pretty done  
Im pretty done  
Im pretty done
