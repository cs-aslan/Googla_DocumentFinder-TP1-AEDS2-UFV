Hes a twentieth century boy  
With his hands on the rails  
Trying not to be sick again  
And holding on for tomorrow  
  
London ice cracks on a seamless line  
Hes hanging on for dear life  
And so we hold each other tightly  
And hold on for tomorrow  
  
Chorus  
La la la lla la la la lla lla lalala  
La la la lla la la la lla lla lalala  
La la la lla la la la lla lla lalala  
Holding on for tomorrow  
  
Shes a twentieth century girl  
With her hands on the wheel  
Trying not to be sick again  
Seeing what she can borrow  
Londons so nice back in your seamless rhymes  
But were lost on the West way  
So we hold each other tightly  
And we can wait until tomorrow  
  
Chorus  
  
Were trying not to be sick again  
And holding on for tomorrow  
  
Shes a twentieth century girl  
Holding on for dear life  
And so we hold each other tightly  
And hold on for tomorrow  
  
Jim stops and gets out of the car  
Goes to a house in Emperors Gate  
Through the door and to his room and then he puts the TV on  
Turns it off and makes some tea  
Says modern life is rubbish  
Im holding on for tomorrow  
  
Then Susan comes into the room  
Shes a naughty girl with a lovely smile  
Says lets take a drive to Primrose Hill  
Its windy there and the views so nice  
London ice can freeze your toes like anyone I suppose  
Youre holding on for tomorrow
