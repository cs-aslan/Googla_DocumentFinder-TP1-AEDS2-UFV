Once in a while  
I see whats going on  
And disappear  
Into the world behind  
The one thats here  
  
It never lasts  
As long as a dream can last  
And then Im back  
Into the ways that make  
The days go fast  
So grab my hand and make it last  
  
And hold me close dont leave so soon  
Let all the flowers bloom  
And dont let go or I will blow  
Away into a different room  
  
Is it so strange  
Tell me you feel the same  
Or shut my mouth  
I cant pretend I havent said it now  
  
Lets just pretend  
Our numbered days wont end  
Infinity  this endless space and time  
For you and me  
And yours and mine forever we  
  
Will hold me close dont leave so soon  
Let all the flowers bloom  
And dont let go or I will blow  
Away into a different room  
  
Theres no door to get me back  
To get me back there  
Theres no window to see  
I tell myself that it was no  
That it was nowhere  
And all becomes a dream  
  
Hold me close dont leave so soon  
Let all the flowers bloom  
And dont let go or I will blow  
Away into a different room
