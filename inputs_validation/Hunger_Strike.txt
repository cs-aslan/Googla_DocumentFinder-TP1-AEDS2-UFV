I dont mind  
Stealing Bread  
From the mouths of decadence  
  
But I cant feed on the powerless  
When my cups already overfilled  
But its on the table  
The fires cooking  
And theyre starving babies  
And the slaves are all working  
  
Blood is on the table  
The mouths are choking  
  
Im going hungry  
  
I dont mind  
Stealing Bread  
From the mouths of decadence  
  
But I cant feed on the powerless  
When my cups already overfilled  
But its on the table  
The fires cooking  
And theyre starving babies  
And the slaves are all working  
  
And its on the table  
The mouths are choking  
  
Im going hungry
