How strong a will  
How long to kill  
The Vampires out to play  
Hes going for his prey  
How wise the decisions  
How clear of a mind with perfect precision  
The aim it will find  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on its track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on its track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
How sweet can it taste  
How good can you feel  
The enemy is dead  
Your victory is real  
How deep can you fall  
How low can you feel  
How sweet can it be  
To know it is real  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on its track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire has struck  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on its track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on its track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
How strong a will  
How long to kill  
The Vampires out to play  
Hes going for his prey  
How wise the decisions  
How clear of a mind with perfect precision  
The aim it will find  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on its track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on its track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on its track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on its track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back
