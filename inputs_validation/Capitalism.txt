Theres nothing wrong with Capitalism  
Theres nothing wrong with free enterprise  
Dont try to make me feel guilty  
Im so tired of hearing you cry  
Theres nothing wrong with making some profit  
If you ask me Ill say its just fine  
Theres nothing wrong with wanting to live nice  
Im so tired of hearing you whine  
About the revolution  
Bringin down the rich  
When was the last time you dug a ditch baby  
If it aint one thing  
Then its the other  
Any cause that crosses your path  
Your heart bleeds for anyones brother  
Ive got to tell you youre a pain in the ass  
You criticize with plenty of vigor  
You rationalize everything that you do  
With catchy phrases and heavy quotations  
And everybody is crazy but you  
Youre just a middle class socialist brat  
From a suburban family and you never really had to work  
And you tell me that weve got to get back  
To the struggling masses whoever they are  
You talk talk talk about suffering and pain  
Your mouth is bigger than your entire brain  
What the hell do you know about suffering and pain     
Repeat first verse  
Repeat chorus  
Theres nothing wrong with Capitalism  
Theres nothing wrong with Capitalism  
Theres nothing wrong with Capitalism  
Theres nothing wrong with Capitalism
