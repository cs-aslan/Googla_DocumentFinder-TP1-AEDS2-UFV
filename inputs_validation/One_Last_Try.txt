Give me one last try  
Hold on for me  
Believe my alibi  
Keep strong  
Dont set me free  
Well this weakness makes me wrong  
Ill show you I can be strong  
And this time it is for real  
I know the hurt Ive made you feel  
But I wont let you down  
No one else would have me round  
You gave your love so honestly  
Is heavens grace too good for me  
I know Ive pushed my luck  
So many times  
Im slippin slowly now  
Loosin track of my mind  
Well this shadow Ive become  
Will step out to meet the sun  
And this time it is for real  
I know the hurt Ive made you feel  
But I wont let you down  
No one else would have me round  
You gave your love so honestly  
Is heavens grace too good for me  
And when the darkness comes  
And I lose sight  
Of the precious world  
That you put right  
Youve the strength to pull me through  
One last try Im asking you  
And this time it is for real  
I know the hurt Ive made you feel  
But I wont let you down  
No one else would have me round  
You gave your love so honestly  
Is heavens grace too good for me
