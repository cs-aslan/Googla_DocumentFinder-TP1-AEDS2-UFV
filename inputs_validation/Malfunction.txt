I just cant get through you despite all the ways I try  
Or any of the things I do maybe Id better off talking to a wall  
Cause you aint making any sense at all Im walking and Im talking  
And Im trying and Im lying but I just aint getting through to you  
Am I just wasting all my precious time cause I aint wasting a breath  
On you or any of your kind if you had any brains you would open  
Your mind but I guess youre just afraid of what you gonna  
Find its a malfunction
