He sticks to his guns  
He take the road as it comes  
It take the shine off his shoes  
He says its a shame  
You know it may be a game  
Ah but I wont play to lose  
  
Hes burning the grass  
He take up a glass  
He swallow it neat  
He crosses the floor  
He open the door  
He take a sniff of the street  
  
And she tell him that hes crazy  
Shes asaying listen baby

She tell him that hes crazy  
For gambling awith his life  
  
But he climbs on his horse  
You know he feel no remorse  
He just kicks it alive  
His motor is fine  
He take it over the line  
Until hes ready to dive  
  
And she tell him that hes crazy  
Yes shes saying listen baby  
Im your wife  
Yeah she tell him that hes crazy  
For gambling with his life  
  
He sticks to his guns  
He take the road as it comes

You know it may be a game  
Ah but I wont play to lose

Hes too fast to stop  
He take it over the top
