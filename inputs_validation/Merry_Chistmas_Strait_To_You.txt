Its Christmas time  
I see the lines of people everywhere tryin to pick out the gifts  
That show how much they care  
It makes me wish that I could see my friends on Christmas Day  
And fill my list with lots of gifts but I can only say  
  
Here comes a merry Christmas strait to you  
I hope it cheers you up when you are down and feelin blue  
Right or wrong Ill sing my song and you will know just who sings  
A merry Christmas strait to you  
  
Theres lot of ways to share the days of Christmas with your friends  
A Christmas card a tree that stars and gifts that make you grin  
Id like to share this song with everyone who came our way  
Without a doubt the fires not out it burns for you today  
  
So heres a merry Christmas strait to you  
I hope it cheers you up when you are down and feeling blue  
Youve been so kind you crossed my mind and nothing less will do  
Heres a merry Christmas strait to you  
  
Here comes a merry Christmas  
And to all who might have missed us  
A very merry Christmas strait to you
