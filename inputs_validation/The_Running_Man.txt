Youll be so far out of control  
You know the ones you saved  
  
Look in my eye cause somehow you  
You dont realize what I made  
  
You cant run away from me  
Dont deny your blind believers  
And hide your Devils keeper  
  
Take your love away from me  
Cause I will blind your heathen reason  
And ride us on your broken wings for love  
  
True we are disciples lost  
You know the promise you made  
Look in my eyes and tell me why  
You realize the price that youll pay  
  
Number nine number nine number nine  
Im still inside of  
The nine asylums  
Am I Messiah  
  
Youre the only God they know  
  
What are you running from  
Wasnt this enough  
Arent you satisfied  
Theyre all at your feet  
The Lord to sheep  
Oh are you sanctified
