Travis McGees still in Cedar Key  
Thats what John McDonald said  
My rendezvous so long overdue  
With all of the things Ive sung and read  
They still apply to me they all make sense in time  
  
Chorus  
But now Im incommunicado  
Driving by myself down the road with a hole in it  
Songs with no vibrato  
Takin the long way home  
  
Now on the day that John Wayne died  
I found myself on the continental divide  
Tell me where do we go from here  
Think Ill ride into Leadville and have a few beers  
Think of Red RiverLiberty Valence cant believe the old mans gone  
  
Chorus  
But now hes incommunicado  
Leaving such a hole in a world that believed  
That a life with such bravado  
Was taking the right way home  
  
So when I finished the last line  
I put the book by itself on the shelf  
With my heart in it  
Never wasting time takin the right way home  
I know youre never wastin time  
Findin the right way home  
  
Still I am incommunicado  
Livin next door to a leg with a pin in it  
Never wastin time takin the right way home  
Repeat
