Are you a saint then dont be a stranger  
Were you sent down from heaven to show me the way  
And if you aint then I see a danger  
You better take a minute and hear what Ive got to say  
  
Chorus  
cause Ill keep on tryin to put it straight to you  
You better give it straight to me  
cause most women seem to have a good time  
Makin a fool out of me  
Im keepin my faith Ive made up my mind  
Ive got nothin left to lose just lay it on the line  
  
Im keepin my faith yea Ill find the one  
Who wont steal me blind who wont turn and run  
Im keepin my faith Im trustin in you  
So dont treat me like those other ones do  
Aint no gettin round it tell me to my face  
Do you think Im a fool for keepin my faith in you  
  
Ill treat you right Ill do you better  
I wont disappoint you I wont make you cry  
My friends tell me if you let her  
Shell empty your pockets shell spend you dry  
  
Chorus x2
