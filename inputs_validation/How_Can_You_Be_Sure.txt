Seen all good things and bad  
Running down the hill  
All so  
Battered and  
Brought to the ground  
I am hungry again  
I am drunk again  
With all the money I owe to my friends  
  
When Im like this how can you be smiling  
Saying  
How can you be sure  
How can you be sure  
  
If you walk out the door  
Will I see you again  
If so much of me lies in your eyes  
I am hungry again  
I am drunk again  
With all the money I owe to my friends  
  
When Im like this how can you be smiling  
Saying  
How can you be sure  
I dont want you anymore  
How can you be sure  
I dont want you anymore  
How can you be sure  
I dont want you anymore  
How can you be sure  
  
I dont want you  
I dont want you anymore  
I dont want you  
I dont want you anymore
