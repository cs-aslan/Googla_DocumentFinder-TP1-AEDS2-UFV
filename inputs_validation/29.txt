Life begins at thirty  
So I have been told  
I can easily believe it  
The way Im getting on  
Yeh Im getting on  
You hang around backstreet bars  
For what you wish you knew  
You say give me something cheap  
Something I wont want to keep  
Loves not everything  
I was just hoping you might stay  
Hell its hard to say  
I was hoping you might stick around  
Until the morning  
Youve heard it all before kid  
Ill say it all again  
And Im going to live a lush life  
An ask for nothing much life  
Loves not everything  
I was just hoping you might stay  
Hell its hard to say  
I was hoping you might stick around  
If you were doing nothing  
Fool for love  
I was just hoping you might stay  
But its not easy to say  
Heyyou doing nothing  
Fool for love  
And its not only the lonely  
Not only the lonely  
Fall for love
