With a mind thats satisfied with a mind thats satisfied  
That big ice cream cone in the sky floats right on by  
The satisfied mind never needs more it never forgets whatever its for  
Beyond control of hot and cold with a mind thats satisfied  
Each one goes together alone with a mind thats satisfied  
In the middle of a heat wave an ice cold drink is a major find  
In the long dead end of winter frozen lovers dream of fire  
With a mind thats satisfied with a mind thats satisfied  
Lucky ones learn that love is blind they dont deny  
The satisfied mind never needs more never regrets and never keeps score  
Beyond control of hot and cold with a mind thats satisfied  
Each one goes together alone with a mind thats satisfied  
In the middle of a heat wave an ice cold drink is a major find  
Simple fact you can depend on bits and pieces of desire  
With a mind thats satisfied that big ice cream cone floats on by  
With a mind thats satisfied lucky ones learn that love is blind  
With a mind thats satisfied the satisfied mind is satisfied  
The satisfied mind is satisfied the satisfied mind is satisfied
