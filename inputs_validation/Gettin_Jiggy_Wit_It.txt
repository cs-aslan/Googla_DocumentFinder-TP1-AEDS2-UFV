On your mark ready set lets go  
Dance floor pro I know you know  
I go psycho when my new joint hit  
Just cant sit  
Got to get jiggy wit it thats it  
Now honey honey come ride  
DKNY all up in my eye  
You gotta Prada bag with a lot a stuff in it  
Give it to your friend lets spin  
Everybody lookin at me  
Glancin the kid  
Wish you nig was dancin the jig  
Here with this handsome kid  
Cigacigar right from CubaCuba

What you want to ball with the kid  
Watch your step you might fall  
Trying to do what I did  
Mamaunh mamaunh mama come closa  
In the middle of the club with the rubadub  
No love for the haters  
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers  
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders  
Met Ali he told me Im the greatest  
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd pleaser  
DJ play another  
From the prince of this  
Your highness  
Only bad chicks ride in my whips  
South to the west to the east to the north  
Bought my hits and watch em go off a go off  
Ah yes yes yall ya dont stop  
In the winter or the summertime  
I makes it hot

Eightfifty IS if you need a lift  
Whos the kid in the drop  
Who else Will Smith  
Livin that life some consider a myth  
Rock from south street to one two fifth  
Women used to tease me  
Give it to me now nice and easy  
Since I moved up like George and Wheezey  
Cream to the maximum I be askin em  
Would you like to bounce with the brother thats platinum  
Never see Will attackin em  
I rather play ball with Shaq and em  
Flatten em  
Psyche  
Hittin you thought I took a spill  
But I didnt  
Trust the lady of my life she hittin  
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon  
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly  
You trying to flex on me  
Dont be silly
