By the mansion on the hillside  
Red sports car comes driving down the road  
And pulls up into the driveway  
And a story does unfold  
  
Shes standing by the rhododendrons  
Where the roses are in bloom  
Looking out at the Atlantic ocean  
And in her head she hums this tune  
  
Thank God the dark nights are drawing in again  
cause high summer has got me down  
Ill wait till the end of August  
And get off this merrygoround  
  
And they shut him out of paradise  
Called him Lucifer and frowned  
She took pride in what God made him  
Even before the angels shot him down to the ground  
  
Hes a light out of the darkness  
And he wears a starry crown  
If you see him nothing will shake him  
cause high summer has got him low down  
  
High summers got him lonesome  
Even when he makes the rounds  
Theres been no two ways about it  
High summers got him low down  
  
Checked in to the tiny village by the lakeside  
Settled down to start a new  
Far away from the politicians  
And the many chosen few  
  
Far away from the jealousy factor  
And everything that was tearing him apart  
Far away from the organ grinder  
And everyone that played their part  
  
And they shut him out of paradise  
Called him Lucifer and frowned  
Cause he took pride in what God made him  
Even before the angels shot him to the ground  
  
Hes a light out of the darkness  
And he wears a starry crown  
If you see him nothings shaken  
cause high summers got him low down  
  
High summers on the rebound  
High summers got him low down  
High summers on the rebound  
High summers got him down low down  
High summers on the rebound  
High summers got him low down  
Low down
