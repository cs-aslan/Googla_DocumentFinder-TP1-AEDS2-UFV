Its never gonna be  
Normal you and me  
What youre signing on for  
Is a storm at sea  
  
So if you think youre tough  
Give me all your love  
And Ill give you every little piece of me  
  
Catch a falling star youll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Catch a falling star youll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
We will never be a nuclear family  
But a rainbow will begin at our feet  
And if you take my hand  
Beware that this boat can  
Run aground making the ocean floor weep  
  
Catch a falling star youll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Catch a falling star youll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Catch a falling star youll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Catch a falling star youll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Take a chance on me yeah  
Youre my remedy yeah  
  
You may fall indeed yeah  
Youll find peace with me yeah  
  
Take a chance on me yeah  
Youre my remedy yeah  
  
You may fall indeed yeah  
Youll find peace with me yeah  
Peace with me yeah  
  
Take a chance on me yeah  
Youre my remedy yeah  
  
You may fall indeed yeah  
Youll find peace with me yeah
