I had a dream last night that I held you  
And you still seemed as handsome to me  
But when I awoke I found you missin  
Its just another crazy dream for me  
  
Chorus  
Crazy dreams linger on as I face an empty dawn  
With no end to it all can I see  
For Ive surely reached the end  
Lost your love to a friend  
Just another crazy dream for me  
  
Once you were mine and we were so happy  
I never thought that the end soon would be  
But now that youre gone and Im so lonesome  
Its just another crazy dream for me  
  
Chorus
