When evening falls  
Shell run to me  
Like whispered dreams  
Your eyes cant see  
  
Soft and warm  
Shell touch my face  
A bed of straw  
Against the lace  
  
We believed wed catch the rainbow  
Ride the wind to the sun  
Sail away on ships of wonder  
  
But lifes not a wheel  
With chains made of steel  
So bless me  
  
Come the dawn  
Come the dawn  
Come the dawn  
Come the dawn  
  
We believed wed catch the rainbow  
Ride the wind to the sun  
And sail away on ships of wonder  
  
But lifes not a wheel  
With chains made of steel  
So bless me oh bless me bless me  
  
Come the dawn  
Come the dawn  
Come the dawn  
Come the dawn
