I just love how long weve known each other  
And I know you care about me  
But I cant tell just where your life is going  
Youve been quite a mystery  
Youve got all of these brand new friends  
They keep taking your confidence  
  
But Im keeping my faith in you  
Deep in my heart of hearts  
Youve been worried puzzled surrounded by your trouble  
But Im keeping my faith in you  
  
We all cried when your first bow was taken  
No one could be prouder of you  
But I care more about your heart if its aching  
If Im your friend what else can I do  
But those people who hang around  
They keep bringing your spirit down  
  
But Im keeping my faith in you yeah  
Deep in my heart of hearts  
If anyone can do it  
I know youll get through it  
So Im keeping my faith in you  
  
Ive known you ever since way back when  
And I know you you dont want to change my friend  
But youre under pressure like no one could imagine  
Its not a good time that youve been having  
But youre a real strong brother and I know youll recover  
So Im keeping my faith in you  
  
Keeping my faith in you  
Deep in my heart of hearts  
If anyone can do it  
I know youll get through it  
So Im keeping my faith in you  
  
Keeping my faith in you  
Deep in my heart of hearts  
Keeping my faith in you  
Deep in my heart of hearts  
  
Youve been worried puzzled  
Surrounded by big trouble  
But Im keeping my faith in you  
  
Keeping my faith in you  
My faith in you  
Keeping my faith in you  
My faith in you  
Keeping my faith in you  
My faith in you
