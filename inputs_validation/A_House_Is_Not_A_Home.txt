A chair is still a chair even when theres no one sitting there  
But a chair is not a house and a house is not a home  
When theres no one there to hold you tight  
And no one there you can kiss good night  
  
A room is still a room even when theres nothing there but gloom  
But a room is not a house and a house is not a home  
When the two of us are far apart  
And one of us has a brok en heart  
  
Now and then I call your name  
And suddenly your face appears  
But its just a crazy game when it ends it ends in tears  
  
Darling have a heart dont let one mistake keep us apart  
Im not meant to live alone turn this house into a home  
When I climb the stair and turn the key  
Oh please be there still in love with me
