I dont want a lovers heartache  
I dont need nobodys sympathy  
So come on get the party started  
All I need is lying next to me  
  
We got our own situation  
Ready and steady to go  
Hang out put out get out  
Thats what were all about  
  
I wanna hear you shout mercy  
I wanna get a little crazy  
  
You got everything Im after  
Flesh and blood just like a fantasy  
So make my heart start beating faster  
Love what is and what can never be  
  
You got a life you keep waiting  
Hiding so nobody sees  
Hang out put out get out  
Thats what were all about  
  
I wanna hear you shout mercy  
I wanna get a little crazy  
Were gonna make a little ecstasy  
You and me  
Thats what were all about  
Mercy  
  
We got our own situation  
Ready and steady to go  
Hang out put out get out  
Thats what were all about  
  
I wanna hear you shout mercy  
I wanna get a little crazy  
Were gonna make a little ecstasy  
You and me  
Thats what were all about  
Mercy  
  
I dont want a lovers heartache  
I dont need nobodys sympathy  
I dont want it and I dont need it  
Mercy
