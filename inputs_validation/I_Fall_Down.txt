Julie says  
John Im getting nowhere  
I wrote this letter  
Hope to get to someplace soon  
I want to get up  
When I wake up  
But when I get up  
I fall down  
  
Julie wake up  
Julie tell the story  
You wrote the letter  
Said you were gonna get there someday  
Gonna walk in the sun  
And the wind and the rain  
Never walk back again  
  
Now you fall down  
Youre falling down  
You fall down  
You fall down  
  
Julie say something  
Julie say youre sorry  
Youre gonna get better  
You better not leave me here anyway  
  
I want to get up  
When you wake up  
When I get up  
  
I fall down  
When Im falling down  
I fall down  
I broke myself  
  
I fall  
I fall down  
Im falling down  
I fall down  
When you fall down  
When Im falling down  
Is when youre falling down  
When you fall down  
I fall down  
I fall down
