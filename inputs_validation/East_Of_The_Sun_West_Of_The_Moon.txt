East of the sun and west of the moon  
Well build a dream house of love dear  
Near to the sun in the day  
Near to the moon at night  
Well live in a lovely way dear  
Living our love in pale moonlight  
  
Just you and I forever and a day  
Love will not die well keep it that way  
Up among the stars well find  
A harmony of life to a lovely tune  
East of the sun and west of the moon dear  
East of the sun and west of the moon  
  
Just you and I forever and a day  
Love will not die well keep it that way  
Up among the stars well find  
A harmony of life to a lovely tune  
East of the sun and west of the moon dear  
East of the sun west of the moon  
East of the sun and west of the moon
