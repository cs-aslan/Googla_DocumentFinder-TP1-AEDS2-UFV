They tell me Ive paid back the debt I owed  
Fortyfour months since the slammer door closed  
They give me a suit and put me back on the road  
And my thoughts are racing  
Where do I go What am I supposed to live on  
What happens when the twentyfive dollars is gone  
That leaves me lots of time to wonder why I was born  
But the countdown is on  
Everybodys dancing  
The music sounds entrancing  
But you cant find the beat  
Its the ticking of a thousand human time bombs  
Who are back on the street  
Oh the names have been changed  
But the storys the same  
History will repeat  
Add it all up and then divide it by zero  
Cause youre back on the street  
I cant stand the strain of this job no more  
I must have forgot what I took it on for  
I make lots of money yet still I want more  
And my head is blazing  
I think that Ill check out the shops downtown  
Sometimes it helps to buy things when I feel brought down  
At this hour I might dodge those hippie lowlifes around  
But the countdown is on  
Once you had to stand out  
Looking for a handout  
Free love and body heat  
And that moneys just a crumpled green be  
When youre back on the street  
Back on the street again  
Said youre back on the street again  
The countdown is on  
And nobody knows when  
Spreading like a cancer  
Looking for the answer  
In everyone you meet  
And each in his way has a hustle to play  
When hes back on the street
