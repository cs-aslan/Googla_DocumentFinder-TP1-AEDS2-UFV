Well Ive come to know the look on your face  
When youre lying about where youve been  
Or how much you spent  
  
I know when you will raise your fingers  
To your mouth as if to wipe away the shame  
Its not a game I know you feel bad  
  
Chorus  
If you ask for my forgiveness  
If you call my name I will come  
If you ask for my love I will give you some  
  
Someday I know you will understand  
Someday youll finally realize  
What youre doing to yourself  
  
Chorus  
  
Weve been dancing to  
That same old song over and over again  
I want to be your lover  
I dont want to be your policeman  
  
So tonight when you finally make  
Your way back to our door  
Ill let you sleep it off like I did the night before  
  
When you ask for my forgiveness  
When you call my name I will come  
When you ask for my love I will give you some  
  
In the morning I will get you up and  
I will smile just when you want me to  
Cause Im Im all you have
