You promised me it would last forever  
You said theres no way it could die  
Everything you ever told me  
Was a bunch of lies  
  
Hey Im on the back of the outside  
You know thats not where I belong no  
Every truth evrything I believed in  
Has turned out wrong  
  
Its all bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart so many times  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart  
  
Its all clear when you scratch on the surface  
Going deeper deeper down  
All I wanted was to make you happy  
But baby whats that sound  
But baby whats that sound  
  
Its all bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart so many times  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
  
All you ever cared for was to make you stronger  
Noone I have known has looked so weak oh yeah  
  
Its all bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart so many times  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart so many times  
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla  
You broke my heart  
  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart  
You broke my heart so many times
