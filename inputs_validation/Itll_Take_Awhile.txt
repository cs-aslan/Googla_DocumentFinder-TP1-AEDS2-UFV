Here I sit alone and broken hearted walk the floor all night since we parted  
Ill get over you I dont know how or when itll take awhile hold by cant
last till then  
Yes itll take awhile to shake the pain of losing you  
Someone will take your place but I dont know who  
The world outside holds nothing now for me itll take awhile to shake your
memory  
 guitar   
So Ill do my best to forget you as I think about the things we used to do  
And Ill forget you I dont know how or when itll take awhile if Ill hold
out till then  
Yes itll take awhile
