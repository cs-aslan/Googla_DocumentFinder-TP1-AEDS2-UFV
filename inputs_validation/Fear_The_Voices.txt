Aww put our heads together  
Because a signature could change our future  
Uhhuh  
For some wrote you a letter begging you to reconsider  
Yeah yeah yeah yea  
  
Put our heads together  
Ahhh ahhh ahhh  
Fear the voices you hear today  
If you still have choices well blow you away  
  
So they put number on the television Mr Gardner  
Oh yeah  
A messed up generation put the pressure on you  
Youre a coward uhhuh  
Yeah yeahey  
  
A messed up generation  
Ahhh ahhh ahhhh  
Fear the voices you hear today  
If you still have choices well blow you away  
  
We can see right through you were awake  
Send your men and we are all awake  
Awake awake awake awake  
Wake awake awake awake  
  
Fear the voices you hear today  
If you still have choices well blow you away  
Fear the voices fear the voices fear the voices fear the voices
