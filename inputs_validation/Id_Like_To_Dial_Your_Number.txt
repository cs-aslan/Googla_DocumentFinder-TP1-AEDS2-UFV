Id like to dial your number again  
But I dont remember it so well  
Id like to see you again  
Cause I dont remember when  
  
I said I wouldnt see you again  
Been so long I dont remember when  
  
Id like to kiss you one more time  
Because I feel it might be different now  
Id like to love you one more time  
Because the last respect was mine  
  
Although I didnt have the time  
Been so long just thought one more time  
  
So Id like to dial your number again  
Seems that I remember it so well  
Id like to see you again  
Cause I dont remember when  
  
I said I wouldnt see you again  
Been so long can you tell me when
