I found smog at the end of my rainbow  
I found my thoughts shift slowly into phase  
Declared the constitution of the walkway  
I realise its time to plan the day the day  
  
Im a market square hero gathering the storms to troop  
Cause Im a market square hero speeding the beat of the streetpulse  
Are you following me are you following me  
Well suffer my pretty warriors and follow me  
  
I got a golden handshake that nearly broke my arm  
I left the ranks of shuffling graveyard people  
I got rust upon my hands from the padlocked factory gates  
Silent chimneys provide the silent steeples  
  
Cause Im a market square hero gathering the storms to troop  
Cause Im a market square hero speeding the beat of the streetpulse the
streetpulse  
Are you following me Are you following me  
Well suffer my pretty children and follow me follow me  
  
Change change change  
Change change change  
  
I am your antichrist show me allegiance  
Are you following me  
I am your antichrist pledge to me defiance  
Are you following me  
Suffer my pretty warriors  
Suffer my fallen child  
Are you following me  
The time has come to conquer and Ill provide your end  
Suffer  
We march  
  
I give peace signs when I wage war in the disco  
Im the warrior in the ultra violet haze  
Armed with antisocial insecurity  
I plan the path of destiny from this maze  
  
Cause Im a market square hero gathering the storms to troop  
Cause Im a market square hero speeding the beat of the streetpulse the
streetpulse  
Are you following me Are you following me  
Well suffer my fallen angels and follow me  
  
Im the market square hero  
Im the market square hero  
Were market square heroes  
Were the market square heroes  
Are you following me  
  
Im the market square hero
