7twenty 7 is ready to move  
You know she packed her bags  
With nothing left to prove  
I thought I didnt care  
Now Im fallin through  
Wouldnt you  
  
Well its a long long journey to the other side  
Oh Ive been wishin all night I was on that flight  
And god youd better take care of the sweetest eyes  
I hear myself swallowin the tears I cry  
I hear myself swallowin the tears I cry  
  
7twenty7 is up in the air  
You know I feel her hands  
On me everywhere  
I thought I didnt care  
Now im saying a prayer  
Hey mister do you know the way  
To salvation square  
  
Its a long long winter til the birds will sing  
Oh Ill be waitin all night for the phone to ring  
Im goin up in smoke and phoney magazines  
Everything is just pieces of my stupid dreams  
Everything is just spieces of my stupid dreams  
  
With the clouds passin by  
With the clouds passin by  
Its all right  
  
7twenty7 is close to the sky  
It carries the world  
Between hello and goodbye  
Like the Monday we met  
That disappeared in a breath  
Like the Sunday she left  
Forever smellin of death  
  
Another jet black night another drink to go  
Oh Ill be diving my head in the pure white snow  
God youd better take care of this gold skinned friend  
Tell me will I ever see her again  
Tell me will I ever see her again
