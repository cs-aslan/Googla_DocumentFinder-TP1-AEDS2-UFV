I want to see you again  
I dont care where and I dont care when  
I want to see you again  
Cause this beginning will have no end  
Bring your whips bring your chains  
We can exchange names  
I want to see you again  
I want to see you again  
I feel a feeling since I dont know when  
I want to see you again  
So you can know you have a friend  
Youre so passive  
Im filled with wrath  
We could take a bath  
I want to see you again  
Oh theres talk of the lights on Broadway  
And hearts intertwining high above  
And if frankly well see things my way  
We will climb the heights of love  
I want to see you again  
It doesnt matter where or when  
I want to see you again  
Im just beginning to have no end  
Perfect love  
Cast out fear  
Let me buy you a beer  
I want to see you again  
And again  
And again  
I want to see you again  
I want to see you again  
I want to see you again  
I want to see you again
