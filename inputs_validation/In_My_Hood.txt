Chorus  
When you grow up in my hood  
Help dont show up in my hood  
Gang signs go up in my hood just cause you inmyhood  
Feel like Im trapped in my hood  
Young kids get clapped in my hood  
Thats why Im strapped in my hood just cause you inmyhood  
Inmyhood in my hood in my hood  
  
Verse 1 Fabolous  
Im always close to  
Feeling like a corner stander stoop sitter or hallway poster  
No matter where I go its always posed to feel just like Im in my hood  
Cops drive in it every 5 minutes look at your faces pat your waists  
Try to find the stash where the gats and base is I cant say that they racist  
But I know it aint the same in they town  
And as fucked up as it may sound in my hood  
Its 2 ways to make it happen off the streets  
Balling on the courts or rapping off the beats  
You hear the shells tappin off the crete when they clappin off the heat  
Then the yellow tapes trappin off the street  
But thats the way we was raised  
Preying to God hoping that he keep us out the way of them strays  
  
Chorus  
Verse 2 Fabolous  
They drink til the cups dry eat til the plates clean  
Niggaz be in state greens fore they turn 18  
Round here you never let the beef slide twice  
Everybody raised on 4 wings and beef fried rice  
Them mothers are getting younger today  
Got one by the hand one in the stroller and one on the way  
We dont have role models  
But we got them handguns that hold hollows in my hood  
Aint no diplomas or degrees  
But you can get high from the aroma of the trees in my hood  
I know it like navigation and fuck having patience  
Ima get mine you better get yours cause everyday is a struggle  
And OneTime ride through everyday just to bug you  
Thats how it is cause your rights be wrong  
And everybody got a white T on when youre inmyhood  
  
Chorus  
Verse 3 Fab  
We try to make the most of what we got  
You either been hit or been close to gettin shot in my hood  
Any nigga that boast be getting got  
And dopeheads fiend to get a dose of what we got  
And young niggaz be like they slow  
But you give them a bluntbet they roll the weed like a pro  
If you trick its not a problem it gets you laid  
But if you stick without a condom it gets you AIDS  
No Sesame Street kids watch BET  
Look up to niggaz that dont got a GED  
I know a dude with the deadbeat tag  
Kids dont got diapers but he ridin in the red GWag  
In the hood you and your beef is sure to bump heads  
And everybody grew up sleepin on bunk beds  
They telling me to voteand I would  
If it made a change in my hoodmufucka  
  
Chorus  
  
Fab talks til the end
