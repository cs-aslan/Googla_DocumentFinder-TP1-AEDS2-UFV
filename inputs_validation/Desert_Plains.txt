Full moon is rising  
The sky is black  
I heed your call Im coming back  
The road is straight cast  
Winds in my eyes  
The engine roars between my thighs  
  
From desert plains I bring you love  
From desert plains I bring you love  
  
Wild mountain thunder  
Echoes my quest  
My body aches but Ill not rest  
Quartz light to guide me  
Till sunrise leads  
My passion screams my heart it bleeds  
  
From desert plains I bring you love  
From desert plains I bring you love  
  
Then in the distance  
I see you stand  
On the horizon you raise your hand  
In burning rubber  
I end my quest  
You fall into my arms and rest  
  
From desert plains I bring you love  
From desert plains I bring you love
