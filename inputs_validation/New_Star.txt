Baby your deal is surreal just like lightning streakin on  
Heaven still is a state of mind where did we go wrong  
What happen to those old convictions  
Went up in smoke  
Baby while your back breaks slowly  
By the skin of your teeth  
Youll be under their thumb  
Moving from this state of friction  
We all got stars in our eyes  
But you know by now your one restriction  
Is at the edge of the sky  
Keep shining like a new star  
Shining like a new star  
Baby we better start  
Cause baby were alive  
New star  
Shadows are still when the will  
Has no strength left to carry on  
Youre flat on you back with your heart attack  
Where the hell have you gone  
The pressure and pain all the fire and ice  
When youre playing a game with the rats and the mice  
While your back breaks slowly  
By the skin of your teeth  
Youll be under their thumb  
New star  
Shining like a new star  
Baby we better start  
Cause baby were alive  
New star  
New star  
Shining like a new star  
Baby we better start  
Cause baby were alive  
New star  
Dreaming so clever in all kinds of weather  
Where did you mention that you buried your treasure  
After the pleasure of givin is gone  
Youll be as one under the same sun  
Shining like a new star  
Shining like a new star  
Shining like a new star  
Shining like a new star  
New star  
Shining like a new star  
Baby we better start  
Cause baby were alive  
New star  
Cause baby were alive
