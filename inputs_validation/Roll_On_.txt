Chorus  
Roll on highway roll on along  
Roll on daddy till you get back home  
Roll on family roll on crew  
Roll on momma like I asked you to do  
And roll on eighteenwheeler roll on roll on  
  
Its Monday morning hes kissin momma goodbye  
Hes up and gone with the sun  
Daddy drives an eighteenwheeler  
And hes off on a midwest run  
As three sad faces gather round momma  
They ask her when daddys comin home  
Daddy drives an eighteenwheeler  
And they sure miss him when hes gone yeah they do  
Ah but he calls them everynight and he tells them that he lovesthem  
And he taught them this song to sing  
  
Chorus  
  
Its Wednesday evening mommas waitin by the phone  
It rings but its not his voice  
Seems the highway patrol has found a jacknifed rig  
In a snow bank in Illinois  
But the driver was missin and the search had been abandoned  
  
For the weather had everything strong  
And they had checked all the houses and local motels  
When they had somemore news theyd call  
And she told them when they found him to tell him that she loved him  
And she hung up the phone singin  
  
Roll on highway roll on along  
Roll on daddy till ya get back home  
Roll on family roll on crew  
Roll on momma like I asked you to do  
And roll on eighteenwheeler roll on  
  
Momma and the children will be waiting up all night long  
Thinkin nothing but the words just comin  
With the ringin of the telephone  
Oh but the man upstairs was listening  
When momma asked him to bring daddy home  
And when the call came in it was daddy on the other end  
Askin her if she had been singin the song singin  
  
Roll on highway roll on along  
Roll on daddy till ya get back home  
Roll on family roll on crew  
Roll on momma like I asked you to do  
And roll on eighteenwheeler  
  
Chorus  
  
Eighteenwheeler  
Eighteenwheeler  
Eighteenwheeler  
Eighteenwheeler  
  
Roll on  
Roll on
