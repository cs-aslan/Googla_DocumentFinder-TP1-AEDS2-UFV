I tried so hard to be carefree  
Rolling out of someones bed  
Into the sunshine  
But the sun oh coming up  
Doesnt always bring the light oh  
And somehow somehow I feel oh  
Its just not right  
No not for me  
  
Well its been so long  
Since Ive been loved by name ohho  
Love me by name ah  
Love me by name  
Come on come on oohhoo  
Love me  
  
Here I feel afraid ooh  
And I dont know why  
Youre surely not the first Ive had ah oh  
Who held me gently yeah  
Oh who took the sweet time  
Just to ask me about me  
Well well maybe this time  
Oh God let it be  
Oh its such so so so long  
Since Ive been loved oh by name  
  
Love me by name  
Ah love me by name  
Come on and love me oh baby  
Yes love me aah aah  
  
Oh love me by name oh  
Why dont you love me ah  
Come on come on ahh ahh  
Sweet baby  
Oh wont you love me yeah  
Love me by name
