Yo girlfriend jus left wit me yea shes a goner  
Man I want her I really want her I gotta have her

Verse 1  
Yall ball when yall can but I stunt when I wanna  
Yo girlfriend wanna fuck me I think were gonna  
Marijuana got my beemer foggy as a summer  
Im gucci mane laflair bitch Im such a premadonna  
Im east atlanta shawty but I hang where I wanna  
Got a plug in arizona but used to slang on the corner  
Got a chocolate nerdy lookin chick a ryder like wynona  
Ima tax my city plenty when she come from california  
You are not the owner of that car that is a loaner  
I got money stacks as tall as you cause thats just my persona  
I got half a million on my neck come try me if you wanna  
Keep a shooter with a chopper turn you to a organ donor  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Verse 2  
My flow so skitzofrantic that I think I need a straightjacket  
Straight drop dope flow put me in a crack baggie  
Old school like a 1960 cadillac  
Real well known in every hood thats why these niggas swagga jackin  
Youre not in my league nowhere close to my tax bracket  
Brick squad charm bout the same size of a tennis racket  
Thirty round tone in my jeans got my pants saggin  
Let yo girlfriend give me becky now the bitch braggin  
Rims to the white chain to watch hat to the shoes matchin  
Since Im Gucci Mane might as well buy her some new glasses  
Everybody still lookin at me when my vette passing  
Brick squad ceo I guarentee the check cashes  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Verse 3  
Six stoves in my house and everybody cooking  
Ferrari pass by damn everybody looking  
A couple million dollars and Im still straight crooked  
You might had the game on hold but I took it  
Im hoppin out the drop lambo like a kangaroo  
Gucci brick squad ceo but tell me who the fuck is you  
Like simon says yo big sister do what I tell her to  
I take risks from the bubble kush and then you know I sell it too  
Milatary rifles you would think I was a exmarine  
Sk street sweeper mac 90 or m16  
No Im not a fighter or a lover I am just a shooter  
So if you disrespect my squad Im a have to shoot ya  
  
Chorus x2
