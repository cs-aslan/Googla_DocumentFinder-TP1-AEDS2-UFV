You think youve heard this before  
Ill try to say it differently  
As long as it come naturally to me  
Its been making me sad  
Cause I cant find a better way  
To speak the words I wanna say to you  
  
Know how I love you  
And know how I need you  
  
And I want you to know  
Wont let you down  
No I cant let go  
And I want you to see  
Everyday I wear my heart on my sleeve  
On my sleeve  
  
Its been driving me mad  
Consistent tones and constant drones  
Keep pulling me back inside my head  
Nothing matter at all  
The world will keep on spinning round  
All these feeling keep on pouring out  
  
Oh how I love you  
Oh how I need you  
  
And I want you to know  
Wont let you down  
No I cant let go  
And I want you to see  
Everyday I wear my heart on my sleeve  
  
I try to write the words down  
Before theyre lost and wont come out  
Oh please help me sing my song  
  
And I want you to know  
Wont let you down  
No I cant let go  
And I want you to see  
Everyday I wear my heart on my sleeve  
Heart on my sleeve  
Heart on my sleeve  
Heart on my sleeve  
  
No I cant let you go  
Cant let you go  
  
Oh I want you to know  
Wont let you down  
Everyday yeah I cant let go  
I wear my heart on my sleeve
