Take my hand  
You know Ill be there  
If you can  
Ill cross the sky for your love  
For I have promised  
Oh to be with you tonight  
And for the time that will come  
  
Take my hand  
You know Ill be there  
If you can  
Ill cross the sky for your love  
And I understand  
These winds and tides  
This change of times  
Wont drag you away  
Hold on and hold on tightly  
Hold on and dont let go  
Of my love  
  
The storms will pass the storm will pass  
It wont be long now it wont be long now  
His love will last  
His love will lastforever  
  
Take my hand  
You know Ill be there  
If you can  
Ill cross the sky for your love  
Give you what I hold dear  
  
Hold on hold on tightly  
Hold on hold on tightly  
Rise up rise up  
With wings like eagles  
You run you run  
You run and not grow weary  
  
take my hand take my hand  
Hold on and hold on tightly  
Hold on hold on tightly  
To this lovelast forever  
To this lovelast forever  
  
Take my hand  
Take my hand
