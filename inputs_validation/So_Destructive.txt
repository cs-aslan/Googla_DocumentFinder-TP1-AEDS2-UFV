Its so destructive  
Counter productive  
How we gonna make it  
When we do not know where love lives 2x  
  
Im not seeing what youre saying  
All the games that you are playing  
Look like tactics for delaying  
While were on our knees and praying  
Making and breaking  
Sitting and debating  
The art of speculating  
Then accumulating  
  
Im not buying what youre selling  
All your shouting and a yelling  
And the lies that you are telling  
Dont strike me as compelling  
Picking and choosing  
Winning and losing  
Cutting and bruising  
Using and abusing  
  
Im not taking what youre giving  
The elections you are rigging  
From your penthouse living  
The deals that you are fixing  
Creeping and crawling  
Running and falling  
Stopping and stalling  
Crying and bawling
