If you love me like you tell me  
Please be careful with my heart  
You can take it just dont break it  
Or my world will fall apart  
You are my first romance and Im willing to take a chance  
That til life is through Ill still be loving you  
I will be true to you just a promise from you will do  
From the very start please be careful with my heart  
  
I love you and you know I do  
Therell be no one else for me  
Promise Ill be always true for the world and all to see  
Love has heard some lies softly spoken  
And I have had my heart badly broken  
Ive been burned and Ive been hurt before  
So I know just how you feel trust my love is real for you  
Ill be gentle with your heart Ill caress it like the morning dew  
Ill be right beside you forever  
I wont let our world fall apart  
From the very start Ill be careful with your heart  
  
You are my first and you are my last romance  
And Im willing to take a chance Ive learned from the past  
That til life is through Ill still be loving you  
I will be true to you only to you  
Just a promise from you will do  
From the very start from the very start  
From the very start from the very start  
Please be careful with Ill be careful with  
Your my heart
