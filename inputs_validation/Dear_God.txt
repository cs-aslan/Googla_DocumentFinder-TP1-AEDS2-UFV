I go to church on a Sunday  
The vows that I make  
I break them on Monday  
The rest of the week  
I do as I please  
Then come Sunday morning  
I pray on my knees  
  
Chorus  
Dear God  
I know Im not worthy  
But I need you so  
Please wont you hurry  
And help me turn back from  
The path I have trod  
Youll never be sorry  
Dear God  
  
Each day we read in the paper  
Of the carrying on  
Of some of our neighbors  
Were sinnin and lyin  
And forgetting the faith  
Then we have the nerve  
To ask is it to late  
  
Chorus
