Just a minute before you leave girl  
Just a minute before you touch the door  
What is it that youre trying to achieve girl  
Do you think we can talk about it some more  
You know the streets are filled with vipers  
Whove lost all ray of hope  
You know it aint even safe no more  
In the palace of the Pope  
  
Dont fall apart on me tonight  
I just dont think that I could handle it  
Dont fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterdays just a memory  
Tomorrow is never what its supposed to be  
And I need you yeah  
  
Come over here from over there girl  
Sit down here you can have my chair  
I cant see us going anywhere girl  
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I cant take you there  
I wish Id have been a doctor  
Maybe Id have saved some life that had been lost  
Maybe Id have done some good in the world  
Stead of burning every bridge I crossed  
  
Dont fall apart on me tonight  
I just dont think that I could handle it  
Dont fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterdays just a memory  
Tomorrow is never what its supposed to be  
And I need you yeah  
  
I aint too good at conversation girl  
So you might not know exactly how I feel  
But if I could Id bring you to the mountaintop girl  
And build you a house made out of stainless steel  
But its like Im stuck inside a painting  
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches  
But I know that I cant move  
  
Dont fall apart on me tonight  
I just dont think that I could handle it  
Dont fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterdays gone but the past lives on  
Tomorrows just one step beyond  
And I need you yeah  
  
Who are these people who are walking towards you  
Do you know them or will there be a fight  
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through  
Can they tell you whats wrong from right  
  
Do you remember St James Street  
Where you blew Jackie Ps mind  
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet  
And laid his life on the line  
  
Lets try to get beneath the surface waste girl  
No more booby traps and bombs  
No more decadence and charm  
No more affection thats been misplaced girl  
No more mud cake creatures lying in your arms  
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants  
He looked so baffled and bewildered  
When he played and we didnt dance  
  
Dont fall apart on me tonight  
I just dont think that I could handle it  
Dont fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterdays just a memory  
Tomorrows never what its supposed to be  
And I need you yeah
