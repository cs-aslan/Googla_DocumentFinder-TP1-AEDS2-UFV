You just get better all the time  
Darling dont you change a thing  
Lately youre the only song I want to sing  
Youre my reason to try  
  
You just get sweeter every day  
The little things you do and say  
If only you could see you through my eyes  
You just get better all the time  
  
And I get the feeling I can make it babe  
As long as you are by my side  
Youre the music in my ears  
The laughter when the tears  
Are falling down in my life  
  
And on down through the years  
You never tried to change my ways  
You never made me feel I had to say  
Im sorry  
  
You just get better all the time  
And just today I heard you read my mind  
That kind of magic is so hard to find  
You just get better all the time
