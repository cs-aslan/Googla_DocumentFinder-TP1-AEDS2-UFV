Ooh darling what can I do  
I feel so afraid and even my friends dont know what to say  
Thats why Im asking you  
Im so afraid  
I know I should be strong  
But when affection is gone its hard to face each day  
Knowing love has drifted away  
Somehow I cant hide the pain  
Is he gonna come back again  
Dear lonely heart  
I wish things could be the way that they were at the start  
But you must face the fact  
If hes going to leave theres no way that youll win him back  
You gotta try to hold back the tears  
Dont give into your fears  
Darling Im so afraid  
I can get through the night  
But when affection is gone its hard to face each day  
Oh will he please come home  
Dear lonely heart dear lonely heart  
Dear lonely heart  
I wish things could be the way that they were at the start  
But you must face the fact  
If hes going to leave theres no way that youll win him back  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Dear lonely heart dear lonely heart  
Dear lonely heart  
Darling Im so afraid  
I can get through the night  
But I cant face the day knowing you are far away  
Oh will you please come home
