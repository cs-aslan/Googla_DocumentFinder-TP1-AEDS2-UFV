Jimmy Buffett  
The days drift by  
They dont have names  
And none of the streets here look the same  
And there are so many quiet places  
And smilin eyes match the smilin faces  
  
Chorus  
And I have found me a home  
Yes I have found me a home  
And you can have the rest of everything I own  
Cause I have found me a home  
  
My old red bike  
Gets me around  
To the bars and the beaches of my town  
And there arent many reasons I would leave  
Yes I have found me some peace  
  
And the ladies arent demanding there  
They never ask too much  
And when youre coming off a cold love  
Thats sure a nice warm touch  
  
Chorus  
  
The days drift by  
They dont have names  
And none of the streets here look the same  
And there arent many reasons I would leave  
Yes I have found me some peace  
Yes I have found me a home
