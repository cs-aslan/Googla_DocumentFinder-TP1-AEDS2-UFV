Little girl so young and tender  
Braids are thrown upon her back  
In the pages of her book the world is  
White and black  
  
She is wearing heavy glasses  
Far from whom she dreamt to be  
Little one her father tells her  
Close your eyes and see  
  
The eyes of love  
Dont know your name  
Dont see the color of your skin  
The eyes of love  
Dont know where youve been  
The eyes of love  
Dont know your age  
Dont see the lines you try to hide  
The eyes of love  
See only whats inside  
  
Little girl has grown and flowered  
Glasses tiny in her eyes  
She can see a lot more clearly  
Still at night she cries  
  
Never happy with the mirror  
She will shun all who adore  
Little one her father tells her  
Open your door  
  
The eyes of love  
Dont know your name  
Dont see the color of your skin  
The eyes of love  
Dont know where youve been  
The eyes of love  
Dont know your age  
Dont see the lines you try to hide  
The eyes of love  
See only whats inside  
  
The light shining bright from your heart
