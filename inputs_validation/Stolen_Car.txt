Late at night in summer heat Expensive car empty street  
Theres a wire in my jacket This is my trade  
It only takes a moment dont be afraid  
I can hot wire an ignition like some kind of star  
Im just a poor boy in a rich mans car  
So I whisper to the engine flick on the lights  
And we drive into the night  
  
Oh the smell of the leather always excited my imagination  
And I picture myself in this different situation  
Im a company director two kids and a wife  
I get the feeling that theres more to this ones life  
Theres some kind of complication he tells her hes alone  
Spends the night with his lover theres a trace of her cologne  
And the words of his mistress as she whispers them so near  
Start ringing in my ear  
  
Please take me dancing tonight Ive been all on my own  
You promised one day we could its what you said on the phone  
Im just a prisoner of love always hid form the light  
Take me dancing please take me dancing tonight  
  
I imagine his wife she dont look nothing like a fool  
She picks the kids up form some private school  
She remembers what he told her he was late and worked alone  
But theres more than a suspicion in this lingering cologne  
And the kids just wont be quiet and she runs a traffic light  
And she drives into the night  
  
Please take me dancing tonight Ive been all on my own  
You promised one day we could its what you said on the phone  
Im just a prisoner of love always hid from the light  
Take me dancing please take me dancing tonight  
  
So here am I in a stolen car at a traffic light  
They go form red to green and so I just drive into the night  
  
Please take me dancing tonight Ive been all on my own  
You promised one day we could its what you said on the phone  
Im just a prisoner of love always hid from the light  
Take me dancing please take me dancing tonight
