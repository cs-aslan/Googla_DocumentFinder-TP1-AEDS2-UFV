All the people at this party  
Theyve got a lot of style  
Theyve got stamps of many countries  
Theyve got passport smiles  
Some are friendly  
Some are cutting  
Some are watching it from the wings  
Some are standing in the centre  
Giving to get something  
  
Photo Beauty gets attention  
Then her eye paints running down  
Shes got a rose in her teeth  
And a Iampshade crown  
One minute shes so happy  
Then shes crying on someones knee  
Saying laughing and crying  
You know its the same release  
  
I told you when I met you  
I was crazy  
Cry for us all Beauty  
Cry for Eddie in the corner  
Thinking hes nobody  
And Jack behind his joker  
And stonecold Grace behind her fan  
And me in my frightened silence  
Thinking I dont understand  
  
I feel like Im sleeping  
Can you wake me  
You seem to have a broader sensibility  
Im just living on nerves and feelings  
With a weak and a lazy mind  
And coming to peoples parties  
Fumbling deaf dumb and blind  
  
I wish I had more sense ot humor  
Keeping the sadness at bay  
Throwing the lightness on these things  
Laughing it all away  
Laughing it alI away  
Laughing it all away
