How could you tell me that you love me  
When I know you were just trying to play me  
But youre the fool  
Cause I know how to switch the game up on you  
And in the end I know who will lose  
I played this game before  
And I cant play no more  
  
What do you take me for  
Its not what you thought  
So dont play games with me  
Cause I play to teach  
And if you want to cheat  
It wont be on me  
  
Its not that serious  
I never put that much thought into us  
It wasnt that I loved you  
I was curious  
  
Its not that serious  
I never put that much thought into us  
It wasnt that I loved you  
I was curious  
  
Who did you think that you were involved with  
Now baby you should know that it aint that serious  
It should concern you that Im always one step ahead of you  
So that should let you know that what you do  
  
I have done before its nothing new  
So run those games on someone who cant be fooled  
I can almost see lies coming through your teeth  
In every word you speak you make it clear to me  
That youre playing wrong and your game aint strong  
Ive been in this too long so just be moving on  
  
Its not that serious  
I never put that much thought into us  
It wasnt that I loved you  
I was curious  
  
Its not that serious  
I never put that much thought into us  
It wasnt that I loved you  
I was curious  
  
Dont play games with my heart  
I will let you go before you start  
  
Its not that serious  
I never put that much thought into us  
It wasnt that I loved you  
I was curious
