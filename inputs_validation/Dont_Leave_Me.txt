I dont know if I can yell any louder  
How many times have I kicked you outta here  
Or said something insulting  
I can be so mean when I wanna be  
I am capable of really anything  
I can cut you into pieces when my heart is broken  
  
Please dont leave me please dont leave me  
I always say how I dont need you  
But its always gonna come right back to this  
Please dont leave me  
  
How did I become so obnoxious  
What is it with you that makes me act like this  
Ive never been this nasty  
Cant you tell that this is all just a contest  
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest  
But baby I dont mean it I mean it I promise  
  
Please dont leave me please dont leave me dont leave me  
I always say how I dont need you  
But its always gonna come right back to this  
Please dont leave me  
  
I forgot to say out loud  
How beautiful you really are to me  
I cant be without  
Youre my perfect little punching bag  
And I need you Im sorry  
  
Please please dont leave me baby please dont leave me  
No dont leave me please dont leave me  
I always say I dont need you  
But its always gonna come right back to this  
  
Please dont leave me please dont leave me  
I always say how I dont need you  
But its always gonna come right back to this  
Please dont leave me baby please please dont leave me
