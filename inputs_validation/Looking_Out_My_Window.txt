Now people you know who I am  
And you know what I can do  
But I got a problem now and Im gonna tell you about it  
Im looking for this woman ysee  
  
Listen this is the way the story goes  
Looking out my window  
Looking at the rain  
Nothing left but pain  
Whyd you go and leave me  
Sad alone and blue  
Looking out my window woman  
Tryin to find you  
Why did you leave me  
Why did you grieve me  
Looking out my window  
What do I see  
Nobodys crying  
Half as bad as me  
I dont think that they feel  
So alone and blue  
Looking out my window baby  
Trying to find you  
Why did you leave me  
Why did you grieve me  
Id like to tell you about  
This little girl that left  
Me so alone and blue  
The trouble is if I paint the  
Picture too well you  
Might fall in love with her too  
She was about 56  
A little bag of tricks  
My mama told me to watch myself but I didnt listen  
Because for you baby Id scratch out my eye  
Looking out my window  
Down the railroad track  
Waiting for that little brown eyed girl  
Shes coming back  
I gotta hear that whistle blowing  
Down the line  
Come back girl  
Shell be mine oh mine  
Why did you leave me  
Why did you grieve me  
Whoa  
Baby come on home  
Im so alone  
Ya know I dont care what the world might say  
Im gonna love you  
Oh baby  
Im down on my knees  
And Im beggin you please  
Ah  
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby  
I love you I love you  
Come on home come on home baby come on home baby come on home baby to me
