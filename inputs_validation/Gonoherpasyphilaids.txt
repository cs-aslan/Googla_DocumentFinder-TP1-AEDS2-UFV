Sitting in a room waiting for some news  
Sitting in a room with white knuckles  
Not feeling so good  
I didnt do the things I should  
  
I said Doc tell me whats wrong with me  
He had this expression he didnt know what to say  
It seems that youve contracted a new strain  
  
How could this happen to me  
Another victim another casualty  
From fucking casually another casualty  
  
All the times I should have worn a jimmy hat  
All the times I said What the fuck  
I wont look back thats not for me  
I wouldnt listen to reason  
Now look at me
