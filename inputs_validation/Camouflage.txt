Verse 1  
Deadend streets and boulevards  
You threw in the towel I broke your heart  
But theres a first time for everything  
Who wouldve thought youd feel so cold  
And all these memories seem so old  
To think you were my everything  
  
PreChorus  
Remember when wed talk all night  
But time aint easy on us how can love die  
  
Chorus  
I got so much shit to say  
But I cant help feeling like Im camouflage  
Fortress around my heart  
You were mine just yesterday  
Now I have no idea who you are  
Its like you camouflage  
  
PostChorus  
But its good to see you here again  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
But its about half past ten  
And I have to catch my ride  
  
Verse 2  
Riding alone on the 405  
And lifes so fragile its like I could cry  
If thats the last time Id see you again  
But Ill never tell you just how I felt  
You might just not care and it might just not help  
What if the feelings just dont make no sense to you you  
  
PreChorus  
Remember when wed talk all night  
But time aint easy on us how can love die  
  
Chorus  
I got so much shit to say  
But I cant help feeling like Im camouflage  
Fortress around my heart  
You were mine just yesterday  
Now I have no idea who you are  
Its like you camouflage  
  
PostChorus  
But its good to see you here again  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
But its about half past ten  
And I have to catch my ride  
  
Chorus  
I got so much shit to say  
But I cant help feeling like Im camouflage  
Fortress around my heart  
You were mine just yesterday  
Now I have no idea who you are  
Its like you camouflage  
  
PostChorus  
But its good to see you here again  
I dont wanna say goodbye  
But its about half past ten  
And I have to catch my ride
