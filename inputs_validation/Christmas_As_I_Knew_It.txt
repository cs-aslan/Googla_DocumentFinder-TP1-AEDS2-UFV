One day near Christmas when I was just a child  
Mama called us together and mama tried to smile  
She said you know the cotton crop hasnt been too good this year  
Theres just no spending money and well at least were all here  
I hope you wont expect a lot of Christmas presents  
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat  
Thats quite a blessing thatll make things a little more pleasant  
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were  
At least we were all healthy and best of all we had her  
Roy cut down a pigapple tree and we drug it home Jack and me  
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread  
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed  
Mama and daddy sacrificed cause this Christmas was lean  
But after all there was the babies Tom and Joanne babies need a few things  
I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack and though we fought now and then  
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him  
Mama made the girls dresses out of flower sacks  
And when she ironed them down you couldnt tell that they hadnt come from
town  
A sharecropped family across the road didnt have it as good as us  
They didnt even have a light and it was way past dusk  
And mama said well I bet they dont even have coaloil or beans to boil  
A log apples cranges and such  
Me and Jack took a jar of coaloil nd some hickernuts wed found  
We walked to the sharecroppers porch and set em down  
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door  
She picked up the coaloil and hickernuts and said  
I sure do thank ye and quickly closed the door  
We started back home me and Jack and about halfway we stopped looked back  
And in the sharecroppers window at last was a light  
So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night  
Christmas came and Christmas went Christmas that year was heaven sent  
Then daddy put on his gumboots waited for the thaw back home in Dyess Arkansas
