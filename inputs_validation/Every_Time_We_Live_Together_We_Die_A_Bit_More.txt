Everybody wants one  
Everybodys got one  
Everybody  
Everybody wants to be loved  
Everybody wants one  
Everybodys got one  
Everybody  
Everybody wants to be loved  
Is it you whos going to guide me  
Through this labyrinth of poems  
Is it you thats going to make me  
Gonna make me feel home  
And every time we live together  
We just die a bit more  
So why dont we just stop  
Oh lets just stop to adore  
Why  
Is it so hard  
To make the right choice
