Ill give you love thats above and beyond the call of love  
And Ill never ever make you cry  
Ill give you love thats above and beyond the call of love  
And love is something that money cant buy  
  
Well a poor boys chances for a pretty girls glances  
Are sometimes very few  
Aint got no money if youll be my honey  
Heres what Ill offer you  
  
Ill give you love thats above and beyond the call of love  
And Ill never ever make you cry  
Ill give you love thats above and beyond the call of love  
And love is something that money cant buy  
  
Oh we met by chance and I knew at a glance  
That Id found my destiny  
Id still carry you off and marry you if  
You would agree  
  
To givin me love thats above and beyond the call of love  
And Ill never ever make you cry  
Ill give you love thats above and beyond the call of love  
And love is something that money cant buy
