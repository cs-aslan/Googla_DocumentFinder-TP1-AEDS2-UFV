Yesterday there was so many things  
I was never told  
Now that Im startin to learn  
I feel Im growin old  
  
Cause yesterdays got nothin for me  
Old pictures that Ill always see  
Time just fades the pages  
In my book of memories  
Prayers in my pocket  
And no hand in destiny  
Ill keep on movin along  
With no time to plant my feet  
  
Cause yesterdays got nothin for me  
Old pictures that Ill always see  
Some things could be better  
If wed all just let them be  
  
Yesterdays got nothin for me  
Yesterdays got nothin for me  
Got nothin for me  
  
Yesterday there were so many things  
I was never shown  
Suddenly this time I found  
Im on the streets and Im all alone  
  
Yesterdays got nothin for me  
Old pictures that Ill always see  
I aint got time to reminisce old novelties  
  
Yesterdays got nothin for me  
Yesterdays got nothin for me  
Yesterdays got nothin for me  
Yesterday  
  
Yesterday
