My old flame  
I cant even think of his name  
But its funny now and then  
How my thoughts go flashing back again  
To my old flame  
My old flame  
My new lovers all seem so tame  
For I havent met a gent  
  
So innocent or elegant  
As my old flame  
  
Ive met so many men  
With fascinating ways  
A fascinating gaze in their eyes  
Some who sent me up to the skies  
But their attempts at love  
Were only imitations of  
My old flame  
I cant even think of his name  
But Ill never be the same  
Until I discover what became  
Of my old flame  
  
Ive met so many men  
With fascinating ways  
A fascinating gaze in their eyes  
Some who sent me up to the skies  
But their attempts at love  
Were only imitations of  
My old flame  
I cant even think of his name  
But Ill never be the same  
Until I discover what became  
Of my old flame
