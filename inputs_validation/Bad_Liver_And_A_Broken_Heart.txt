Well I got a bad liver and broken heart yeah  
I drunk me a river since you tore me apart  
And I dont have a drinking problem cept when I cant get a drink  
And I wish youd aknown her we were quite a pair  
She was sharp as a razor and soft as a prayer  
So welcome to the continuing saga she was my better half and I was just a
dog  
And so here am I slumped Ive been chipped and Ive been chumped on my stool  
So buy this fool some spirits and libations its these railroad station bars  
And all these conductors and porters and Im all out of quarters  
And this epitaph is the aftermath yeah I choose my path hey come on Kath  
Hes a lawyer he aint the one for ya  
No the moon aint romantic its intimidating as hell  
And some guys trying to sell me a watch  
And so Ill meet you at the bottom of a bottle of bargain Scotch  
I got me a bottle and a dream its so maudlin it seems  
You can name your poison go on ahead and make some noise  
I aint sentimental this aint a purchase its a rental and its purgatory  
And hey whats your story well I dont even care  
Cause I got my own doublecross to bear  
  
And Ill see your Red Label and Ill raise you one more  
And you can pour me a cab I just cant drink no more  
Cause it dont douse the flames that are started by dames  
It aint like asbestos  
It dont do nothing but rest us assured  
And substantiate the rumors that youve heard
