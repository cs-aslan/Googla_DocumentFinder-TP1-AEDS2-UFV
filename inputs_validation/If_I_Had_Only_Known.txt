If I had only known  
It was the last walk in the rain  
Id keep you out for hours in the storm  
I would hold your hand  
Like a life line to my heart  
Underneath the thunder wed be warm  
If I had only known  
It was our last walk in the rain  
  
If I had only known  
Id never hear your voice again  
Id memorize each thing you ever said  
And on those lonely nights  
I could think of them once more  
Keep your words alive inside my head  
If I had only known  
Id never hear your voice again  
  
You were the treasure in my hand  
You were the one who always stood beside me  
So unaware I foolishly believed  
That you would always be there  
But then there came a day  
And I turned my head and you slipped away  
  
If I had only known  
It was my last night by your side  
Id pray a miracle would stop the dawn  
And when youd smile at me  
I would look into your eyes  
And make sure you know my love  
For you goes on and on  
If I had only known  
If I had only known  
The love I wouldve shown  
If I had only known
