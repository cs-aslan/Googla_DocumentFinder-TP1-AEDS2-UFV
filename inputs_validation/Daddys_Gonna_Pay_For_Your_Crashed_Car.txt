Youre a precious stone  
Youre out on your own  
You know everyone in the world  
But you feel alone  
Daddy wont let you weep  
Daddy wont let you ache  
Daddy gives you as much as you can take  
Aha shala aha shala  
Daddys gonna pay for your crashed car  
  
A little uptight  
Youre a babys fist  
Butterfly kisses up and down your wrist  
When you see daddy coming  
Youre licking your lip  
Nails bitten down to the quick  
Aha shala aha shala  
Daddys gonna pay for your crashed car  
Daddys gonna pay for your crashed car  
  
Youve got a head full of traffic  
Youre a sirens song  
You cry for mama  
And daddys right along  
He gives you the keys to a flamin car  
Daddys with you wherever you are  
Daddys a comfort  
Daddys your best friend  
Daddyll hold your hand right up to the end  
Aha shala aha shala  
Daddys gonna pay for your crashed car  
Daddys gonna pay for your crashed car  
  
Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturdays  
Alright
