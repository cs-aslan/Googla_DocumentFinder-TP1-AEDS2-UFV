Oh make me over  
Im all I wanna be  
A walking study  
In Demonology  
  
Hey so glad you could make it  
Yeah now youve really made it  
Hey so glad you can make it now  
  
Oh look at my face  
My name is might have been  
  
My name is never was  
My names forgotten  
  
Hey so glad you could make it  
Yeah now youve really made it  
Hey theres only us left now  
  
When I wake up in my makeup  
Its too early for that dress  
Wilted and faded somewhere in Hollywood  
Im glad I came here with your pound of flesh  
  
No second billing cause youre a star now  
Oh Cinderella they arent sluts like you  
  
Beautiful garbage beautiful dresses  
Can you stand up or will you just fall down  
  
You better watch out  
Oh what you wish for  
It better be worth it  
So much to die for  
  
Hey so glad you could make it  
Yeah now youve really made it  
Hey theres only us left now  
  
When I wake up in my makeup  
Have you ever felt so used up as this  
  
Its all so sugarless  
Hooker waitress  
Model actress  
Oh just go nameless  
  
Honeysuckle  
Shes full of poison  
She obliterated everything she kissed  
  
Now shes fading somewhere in Hollywood  
Im glad I came here with your pound of flesh  
  
You want a part of me  
Well Im not selling cheap  
No Im not selling cheap
