When I first met you  
My life turned a page  
Chapter one was how true love was made  
You taught me with your kiss  
Things about romance I missed  
You knew everything from A to Z  
What pleases you and what pleases me  
Girl when you touched me  
I began to understand oh  
  
Chorus  
You you wrote the book on love  
And I want to read every word  
So I know everything about you  
You you wrote the book on love  
Girl I just cant get enough of your love  
I know you wrote the book on love  
  
Each time I hold you I find something new  
Cause I know what I love about you baby  
Girl I discover you bring out the lover in me yeah  
Youre like a fire that burns in my soul  
Like a volcano Im ready to blow  
Cause every time I look at you  
I feel love I cant explainoh  
  
Chorus  
  
I hear what your heart is saying to me  
I see the picture so clearly  
Im thirsty for the knowledge  
True love brings  
What youre near me  
  
Chorus
