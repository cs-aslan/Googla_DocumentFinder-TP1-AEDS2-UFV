When you wont go along  
Some will feel like you cant find your way  
Heaven knows  
Heaven knows Ive seen it all before  
Now dont get me wrong  
Ive seen many a life gone astray  
When someone goes  
All your bows wont make it any better so let it go  
  
Chorus  
Shut up and take it like a man  
You need us to get a life  
For your own good well take you by the hand  
Cause you need a little more  
  
Maybe no one will say it  
Maybe no ones aware it goes on  
All I know  
All I know its like going off the deep end  
Could you make a decision  
Could you think for yourself and go on  
Everyone knows  
Everyone knows youve got to fit into the mainstream so save your woes  
  
Chorus  
  
Close your eyes  
Look away now  
Make believe while you can  
So youd best go along  
Dont let on if you cant find your way  
Many more  
Many more do it for you  
Because heaven knows  
Heaven knows its like playing with fire  
Your lifes a throw  
  
Chorus
