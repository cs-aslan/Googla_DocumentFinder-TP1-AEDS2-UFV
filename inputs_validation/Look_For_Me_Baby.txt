Look for me baby  
Well you can search high and low if you want  
But you wont find me  
Look for me baby  
Well you search the mountains  
Look in the sea  
Look all around the world  
But you wont find a love  
A love like mine  
Youll be low  
And cry misery  
Cause you got no love  
Look for me baby  
  
In your desperation  
Youre going to look for someone else  
Well now search the mountains  
Search the sea  
Look around the world  
But you wont find me  
Look for me baby  
Youll be looking for me  
Look for me baby  
  
Well now Ive never felt so sad  
Ive never had it so bad  
Youll search the oceans  
But you wont find me no more  
Youll be looking for me  
Look for me baby  
  
Well you can search high and low if you want  
But you wont find me  
Look for me baby  
Well you can climb the mountains  
And swim in the sea  
Look all around the world  
But you wont find a love  
A love like mine  
Youll be low  
And cry misery  
Cause you got no love  
Look for me baby  
  
In your desperation  
Youre going to look for someone else  
Well now search the mountains  
Search the sea  
Look around the world  
But you wont find me  
Look for me baby  
Youll be looking for me  
Look for me baby  
Youll be looking for me  
Look for me baby  
Youll be looking for me  
Look for me baby
