Id rather be in some dark hollow where the sun dont ever shine  
Then to be at home alone and knowing that youre gone  
Would cause me to lose my mind  
  
Well blow your whistle freight train carry me far on down the track  
  
Chorus  
Well Im going away Im leaving today  
Im goin but I aint comin back  
  
Id rather be in some dark hollow where the sun dont ever shine  
Then to be in some big city in a small room with you upon my mind  
  
Chorus
