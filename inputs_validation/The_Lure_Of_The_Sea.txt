If I walk like a fool Ive walked like that since school  
But maybe its the lure of the sea  
Who knows the effect  
That whisky couldve had on me  
It couldve been the lure of the sea  
  
Cause leather aint as strong as the weather  
But leather can strangle any dream  
And leather aint as strong as the weather  
But leather took Curtis from me  
  
Maybe its the lure of the sea  
Maybe its the lure of the sea  
Suicides just the anarchist that kicks down modesty  
But maybe its the lure of the sea  
  
Once I felt chained and now now I feel free  
Maybe its the lure of the sea  
Polo and Da Gama  
Well those two had nothing on me  
Could be Im a sucker for the sea  
  
Cause silver aint as quick as the tongue  
But silver took the MLK so young  
And metal aint as strong as the petal  
But metal left the verse unsung  
  
Maybe its the lure of the sea  
Maybe its the lure of the sea  
Suicides just the anarchist that kicks down modesty  
But maybe its the lure of the sea  
  
Freedoms taken a liking to me  
Maybe its the lure of the sea  
Look in my eyes cause my belts broke free  
Maybe its the lure of the sea  
The Pirates Of Penzance  
They have nothing on me  
Maybe its the lure of the sea  
  
Maybe its the lure of the sea maybe its the lure of the sea  
Suicides just the anarchist that kicks down modesty  
But maybe its the lure of the sea  
  
Maybe its the lure of the sea maybe its the lure of the sea  
Suicides just the anarchist that kicks down modesty  
But maybe its the lure of the sea
