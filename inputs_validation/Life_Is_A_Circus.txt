CHORUS  
Life is a circus  
Its not fair  
Life is a hard road  
When youre not there  
At the fair  
Friends come to see me  
and the point where shall I go  
To see the show  
to help my friend and foe  
all that   
When will they realize  
To laugh and drag my name on the ground  
The circus must go  
Looking at the strengths of every  
  
Papa he talks to me  
Dont try your heart  
Gets deep inside you  
Does you real harm  
Dont you care  
Life   
and the   
Stand straight and true  
to help my friend and foe  
Why let them Oh let them fight  
Fight your  
Christ dont tell
