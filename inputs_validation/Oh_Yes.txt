The day you held me in your arms  
I still smell the scent of you  
On my dress unbelievable  
You were so masculine  
The way I felt your chest up next to mine  
I felt you in my heart  
And now I breathe love  
  
You are so amazing  
Unbelievable baby  
Its you that makes me smile  
When everything is crazy  
Youre the one I love  
No other man can faze me  
Cause youre in my heart  
Im your heart  
Every minute daily  
  
Yes  
  
The time you looked into my eyes  
I felt like falling in love  
And I was mesmerized  
Cause its something that you do  
That makes me feel this way  
And I cant explain  
Youre my joy my peace my happiness  
And you  
  
You are so amazing  
Unbelievable baby  
Its you that makes me smile  
When everything is crazy  
Youre the one I love  
No other man can faze me  
Cause youre in my heart  
Im in your heart  
Every minute daily
