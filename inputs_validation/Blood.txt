Thank you for the lies the lies you sold us  
Thank you for this vision of violence  
Thank you for this song you gave me to sing  
Thank you for the capping day on a culture that lay dying  
Yes its us thats dying  
Maybe it wont be long now that its all gone on  
  
Chorus  
Its all gone wrong theres blood on our hands  
Its all gone wrong theres blood  
Theres blood  
Its all gone wrong Theres blood on our hands  
Its all gone wrong theres blood  
blood on our hands  
  
We saw them laying there with their arms around each other  
Staring through their fear and the miles between our heads  
You could have told the truth  
It was your decision to  
Sacrifice integrity and compassion for greed  
  
Chorus
