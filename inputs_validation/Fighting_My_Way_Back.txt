Im tough rough ready and able  
To pick myself up from under this table  
Dont stick no sign on me I got no label  
Im a little sick unsure unsound and unstable  
  
But Im fighting my way back  
  
Im busting out and Im going in  
Im kicking up about the state Im in  
Looking to my future not my past  
I want to be a good boy but how long can it last  
  
Fighting my way back  
  
This kid is going to wreck and ruin  
Im not quite sure of what Im doing  
You see it happened all a little too soon  
But its all there in this here tune  
  
Fighting my way back
