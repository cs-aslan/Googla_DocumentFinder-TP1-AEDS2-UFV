Your face is beaming you say cause its youre dreaming of  
How good its going to be  
You say youve been around and now youve finally found  
Everything you wanted and needed in me  
  
Chorus  
I dont have the heart to hurt you  
Its the last thing I wanna to do  
But I dont have the heart to love you  
Not the way you want me to  
  
Inside Im dying to see you cryin  
How can I make you understand  
I care about you so much about you  
Baby Im trying to say this as gently as I can cause  
  
Chorus  
I dont have the heart to hurt you  
Its the last thing I wanna to do  
But I dont have the heart to love you  
Not the way you want me to  
  
Youre so trusting and open  
Hoping that love will start  
But I dont have the heart  
Oh no I dont have the heart  
  
Chorus  
I dont have the heart to hurt you  
Its the last thing I wanna to do  
But I dont have the heart to love you  
Not the way you want me to  
  
I dont have the heart  
Baby I dont have the heart  
Baby I dont have the heart
