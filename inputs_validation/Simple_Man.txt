Mama told me when I was young  
Come sit beside me my only son  
And listen closely to what I say  
And if you do this  
It will help you some sunny day  
Take your time Dont live too fast  
Troubles will come and they will pass  
Go find a woman and youll find love  
And dont forget son  
There is someone up above  
  
Chorus  
And be a simple kind of man  
Be something you love and understand  
Baby be a simple kind of man  
Oh wont you do this for me son  
If you can  
  
Forget your lust for the rich mans gold  
All that you need is in your soul  
And you can do this if you try  
All that I want for you my son  
Is to be satisfied  
  
Chorus  
And be a simple kind of man  
Be something you love and understand  
Baby be a simple kind of man  
Oh wont you do this for me son  
If you can  
  
Boy dont you worry  
Youll find yourself  
Follow your heart  
And nothing else  
You can do this  
If you try  
All that I want for you my son  
Is to be satisfied  
  
Chorus  
And be a simple kind of man  
Be something you love and understand  
Baby be a simple kind of man  
Oh wont you do this for me son  
If you can  
  
Baby be a simple be a simple man  
Oh be something you love and understand  
Baby be a simple kind of man
