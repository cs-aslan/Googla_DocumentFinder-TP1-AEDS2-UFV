I dont understand how the sun keeps shining  
And I dont understand why the seasons change  
And I dont have a clue what makes the river flow  
Loving you is all I know  
  
I cant tell you why stars come out in the evening  
And I cant tell you where they go when theyre gone  
And I dont have a clue what makes a flower grow  
Loving you is all I know  
  
I dont know how the world keeps on spinning around  
I dont know why the sky dont come falling down  
I just know that I would die without your touch  
I dont know what a time just to reach the shore  
Just know that Ill need you for forever more  
Knowing that I guess I know it now  
  
I cant really say if there is a heaven  
But I feel like its here when I feel you near me baby  
If angels are real they must know how I feel  
Cause loving you is all I know
