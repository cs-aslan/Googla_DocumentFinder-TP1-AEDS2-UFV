You make it sound easy  
You say just hold your hand out dont you  
You just hold your hand out dont you  
That hope never leaves you  
  
Cause a light shines on that helps you to steer  
Makes everything clear  
Well it might  
Well it might in your world  
  
But it doesnt  
But it doesnt in mine  
Ive been stumbling  
Ive been stumbling in the dark for years  
And the light just made me blind  
  
You say it lights every pathway  
Shows me how to live life  
For the rest of my days  
For the rest of my days  
  
But I cant  
But I cant put my faith in  
Your words  
Your words and demands  
  
I believe  
I believe in God alright  
Its folk like you I just cant stand  
  
You dont have to try and scare me  
To reinforce my faith sir  
cause I know that one day  
Ill stand before my maker  
  
And it Im found  
And if Im found wanting  
When my case  
When my case is heard  
  
Itll be  
Itll be by the author  
Not some interpreter of his words  
  
You make it sound easy  
You say just hold your hand out dont you  
You just hold your hand out dont you  
That hope never leaves you  
  
Cause a light shines on that helps you to steer  
Makes everything clear  
Well it might  
Well it might in your world  
  
But it doesnt  
But it doesnt in mine  
Ive been stumbling  
Ive been stumbling in the dark for years  
  
And the light just made me blind  
Yeah the light just made me blind
