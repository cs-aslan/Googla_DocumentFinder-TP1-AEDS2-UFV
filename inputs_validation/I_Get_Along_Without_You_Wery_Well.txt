1952 hoagy carmichael  
  
I get along without you very well  
Of course i do  
Except when soft rains fall  
And drip from leaves then i recall  
The thrill of being sheltered  
In your arms  
Of course i do  
But i get along without you very well  
  
Ive forgotten you  
Just like i said i would  
Of course i have  
Or maybe except when i hear your name  
Someones laugh thats just the same  
Ive forgotten you just like  
I should  
  
What a guy  
What a fool am i  
To think my aching hearth  
Could keep the moon  
Whats in store  
Should i phone once more  
No no no no no  
Its best that i stick to my tune  
  
I said that i get along  
Without you very well  
Of course i do  
Except perhaps in spring  
But then i should never  
Ever think of spring  
For that would  
Surely break my heart in two
