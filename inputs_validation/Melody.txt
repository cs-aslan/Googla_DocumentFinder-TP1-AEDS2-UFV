Melody youre my oldest friend  
I can talk to you  
What a day its been out there  
In the madden crush  
Another days gone dying in the dust  
  
Melody listen for the phone  
While I change my clothes  
He knows by now Im home  
Three days waiting took its toil  
This trying to type and crying  
Its getting old  
  
Melody remember long summer days  
Playing grown ups in the city  
Mama saying sweet dreams sleepy heads  
Tuck in bed with you my favorite dolly  
  
Oh Melody with your raggedy charms  
I have looked for love in a strangers arms  
Scared of going home for what theyll see  
You know mama eyes could  
Always look right through  
And daddy he wouldnt be so proud of me  
No they wont understand like you Melody
