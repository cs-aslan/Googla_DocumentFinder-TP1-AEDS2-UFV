I wake up one morning and its passed you by  
You dont know when and you dont know why  
I feel like an old memory hangin round  
And man weve got to face it its a young mans town  
I knew this day was comin all along  
Some why bitch an moan and say they done you wrong  
Just teach em what you know and pass it on down  
Cause man you gotta face it its a young mans town  
Its a young mans town  
Full of young mans dreams  
And all Gods children gotta learn to spread their wings  
And sometimes you gotta stand back  
And watch em burn it to the ground  
Even though you built it its a young mans town  
You always seem to be the last to know  
Man thats just the way that the story goes  
Theres nothin you can do when the fields have turned brown  
An man you gotta face it its a young mans town  
Its a young mans town  
Full of young mans dreams  
And all Gods children gotta learn to spread their wings  
And sometimes you gotta stand back  
And watch em burn it to the ground  
Even though you built it its a young mans town  
Sometimes you gotta stand back  
And watch em burn it to the ground  
Even though you built it its a young mans town  
Its a young mans town
