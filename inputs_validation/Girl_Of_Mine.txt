When your asleep beside me I watch you lying there  
Your hand upon the pillow and moonlight in your hair  
I get the warmest feeling so good I almost cry  
I kiss your sleeping lips and say Ill love you till I die  
Oh girl of mine you make my day  
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away  
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me  
Our love will always be  
So girl of mine turn out the light  
And in my arms together well make sweet love tonight  
Down lifes golden road and youll always know  
I love you  girl of mine  
Sometimes I know I hurt you when things aint goin right  
I walk away and leave you to face the lonely night  
I wouldnt blame you darlin if you walked out on me  
But I return to find you there still waiting patiently  
Oh girl of mine you make my day  
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away  
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me  
Our love will always be  
So girl of mine turn out the light  
And in my arms together well make sweet love tonight  
Down lifes golden road and youll always know  
I love you  girl of mine
