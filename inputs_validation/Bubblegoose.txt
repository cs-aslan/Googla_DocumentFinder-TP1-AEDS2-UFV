When I was young Mama played a guitar  
A microphone and she said Id go far  
She said Just keep all the lyrics hardcore  
Listen to my talk and get up Im on the corner with my  
  
Hey kids gather around its Wyclef and Melky Sedeck  
I got a story to tell heeeeeeere we go  
  
Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler round my way  
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed  
Black BMW with rims to match windows bulletproof  
One night he jumped out the car  
and caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
You can be at the party gettin loose  
But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose  
  
Hey yo hey yo my pens in my hand what should I write next  
Oh yeah and if you dont know success brings stress  
Im vexed my phone rings collect call from Jeff  
The operator say If you accept say yes  
Yes whats the deal son  
Yo I got bad news  
Yo by the tone of his voice I heard the ill street blues  
The friends will make you then too can break you  
They plan an execution like Fu Man Chu  
Who  
You know the character from channel 5 kungfu wahoo  
Slow down man Jeff Im losin you  
Hey yo your cousin Rohann  
Uhhuh  
Who used to sell bang  
Uhhuh  
DTs found his hand in the back of Binnigans  
What  
In a plastic bag with a note attached  
Saying what  
A million and a half or he wont be back  
So meet me by the Brooklyn Bridge 1200 sharp  
If not at the funeral you gotta play the harp  
Yo why they wanna start and make me play my part  
Dont they know like Sting I can turn this murder into art  
I jumped into my car theres gotta be a joke  
Traffics backed up whos in town the Pope  
Sssssomeone blew the horn I turned and looked left  
To my surprise it was my sis Melky Sedeck  
  
Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler round my way  
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed  
Black BMW with rims to match windows bulletproof  
One night he jumped out the car  
and caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
You can be at the party gettin loose  
But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose  
  
Youre shootin in the opposite position  
Im thiniin Should I fire or hold back on ammunition  
On your wig transition  
My mission like Take 6 is to spread love  
But all you screwed mugs got me wearin black gloves  
You up in my face I see the fear in your eyes  
You wanna feel the pain like a grown man gettin circumcised  
Shalom shalom pardon my left  
But my right hands on your throat massaging you to death  
You provoke the cycle call Michael  
Youre lookin in the mirror well Im in your window oh oh  
You hear me Urkel your blood will turn purple  
Like the colour you holler ballin for your mother  
Noone hears you even though you knock  
You used to walk around the block with the daily rock  
Things done changed since your spark got hot  
Now you got your knot wocked with your very own glock  
  
Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler round my way  
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed  
Black BMW with rims to match windows bulletproof  
One night he jumped out the car  
and caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
You can be witcha girl gettin loose  
But you can catch a bullet in your goose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose  
You can be at the party gettin loose  
But you can catch a bullet in your goose
