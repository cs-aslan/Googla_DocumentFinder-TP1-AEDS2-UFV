Gonna write a little letter mail it to my local dj  
Its a rockin little record I want my jockey to play  
Roll over beethoven I hear it again today  
You know my temperatures rising and the jukebox blows a fuse  
My hearts beatin rhythm and my soul is asinging the blues  
Roll over beethoven and tell tchaikowsky the news  
I got a rockin pneumonia I need a shot of rhythm and blues  
I think I got it off the writer sittin down at the rhythm review  
Roll over beethoven were rockin by two by two  
Well if you feel you like it  
Well get your lover and reel and rock it  
Roll it over and move on up just  
A little bit further and reel and rock it roll it over  
Roll over beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues  
Early in the morning Im agivin you the warnin  
Dont you step on my blue suede shoes  
Hey little little gonna play my fiddle aint got nothin to lose  
Roll over beethoven and tell tchaikowsky the news  
You know she winks like a glow worm and dance like a spinnin top  
Shes got a crazy partner oughta see em reel and rock  
Long as shes got a dime the music will never stop  
Roll over beethoven roll over beethoven  
Roll over beethoven roll over beethoven  
Roll over beethoven dig these rhythm and blues  
thany you domo arigato  
Thank you thank you for coming to see the show  
And Id like to thank the band and eric for  
Making me come here to japan its been very  
Nice and I love you thank you
