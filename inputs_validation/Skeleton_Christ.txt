Unbound Gods creation  
Has grown into the sinner  
Abandoned innocence  
Impenitent transgressor  
Escape mortality  
They say your life can change  
If you take Gods hand  
Embrace rebirth  
Your cleansings so divine  
To be reborn in Gods eyes  
  
Youll never touch Gods hand  
Youll never taste Gods breath  
Because youll never see the second coming  
Lifes too short to be focused on insanity  
Ive seen the ways of God  
Ill take the devil any day  
Hail Satan  
  
Your faith has atrophied  
And rots in hells asylum  
Despondence tears you down  
A freefalling social strain  
Escape atrocity  
They say your life can change  
If you take Gods hand  
Embrace rebirth  
Your cleansings so divine  
To be reborn to Gods lies  
  
Youll never touch Gods hand  
Youll never taste Gods breath  
Because youll never see the second coming  
Its all a fuckin mockery  
No grasp upon reality  
Its mind control for  
Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ  
  
Youll never touch Gods hand  
Youll never taste Gods breath  
Because youll never see the second coming  
I laugh at the abortion known as Christianity  
Ive seen the ways of God  
Ill take the devil any day  
Hail Satan  
  
Youll never touch Gods hand  
Youll never taste Gods breath  
Because youll never see the second coming  
Its all a fuckin mockery  
No grasp upon reality  
Its mind control for  
Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ
