Leaving my family behind me  
Not knowing what lay ahead  
Waving goodbye as I left them in tears  
Remembering all wed said  
  
I looked to the sky I offered my prayers  
I asked Him for guidance and strength  
But the simple beliefs of a simple man  
Lay in His hands and on my head  
My head  
  
I gave everything that they wanted  
But still they wanted more  
We sweat and we toiled  
Good men lost their lives  
I dont think they knew what for  
  
I sold them my heart  
I sold them my soul  
I gave everything I had  
But they couldnt break my spirit  
My dignity fought back  
Fightback  
Just fightback  
  
Can you hear me  
Can you see  
Dont you hear me  
Dont you see  
  
We worked in gangs for all we were worth  
The young boys pulling the wagons  
We were digging the tunnels shifting the earth  
It was then that it happened  
  
Noone knew how the cracks appeared  
But as it fell they all disappeared  
Stone fell like rain  
  
Can you hear me  
Can you see  
Dont you hear me  
Can you breathe  
  
The smoke cleared the dust it settled  
No one knew how many had died  
All around there were broken men  
Theyd said it was safe and theyd lied  
You could hear the cries you could smell the fear  
But good fortune that day was mine  
And it occurred to me that the heart of a good man  
It seems is hard to find  
  
Can you hear me  
Can you see  
Dont you hear me  
Dont you see  
How we worked how we worked like  
The devil for our pay  
Through the wind through the snow  
And through the rain  
  
Blasting and cutting through Gods country like a knife  
Sweat stinging my eyes there has to be a better life  
  
But I can hear my childrens cry  
I can see the tears in their eyes  
Memories of those Ive left behind  
Oh just still ringing in my ears  
Will I ever go back again  
Will I ever see her face again  
cause Ill always remember that night  
As they waved goodbye to their fathers  
  
We came from the North  
And we came from the South  
With picks and with spades  
And a new kind of order  
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead  
Theyll never see the likes of us again  
  
Driving the last spike  
Lifting and laying the track  
With blistering hands  
And the sun burning your back  
  
But I can hear my childrens cry  
I can see the tears in their eyes  
Oh memories of those Ive left behind  
Still ringing in my ears  
cause Ill always remember that night  
As they waved goodbye to their fathers  
  
We followed the rail we slept under the stars  
Digging in darkness and living with danger  
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead  
Theyll never see the likes of us again  
  
Can you hear me  
Can you see  
Dont you hear me  
Dont you see
