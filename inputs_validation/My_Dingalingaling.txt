When I was a little biddy boy  
My grandmother bought me a cute little toy  
Silver bells hanging on a string  
She told me it was my dingalingaling  
  
My DingALing My DingALing I want you to play with My DingALing  
My DingALing My DingALing I want you to play with My DingALing  
  
Then mama took me to Grammar school  
But I stopped off in the vestibule  
Every time that bell would ring  
Catch me playing with my dingaling  
  
Once I was climbing the garden wall  
I slipped and had a terrible fall  
I fell so hard I heard bells ring  
But held on to My dingaling  
  
Once I was swimming cross turtle creek  
Man them snappers all around my feet  
Sure was hard swimming cross that thing  
With both hands holding my dingaling  
  
This here song it aint so sad  
The cutest little song you ever had  
Those of you who will not sing  
You must be playing with your own Dingaling
