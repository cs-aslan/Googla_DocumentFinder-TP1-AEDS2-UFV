I dont know where Im goin  
But I sure know where Ive been  
Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday  
An Ive made up my mind I aint wasting no more time  
Here I go again here I go again  
  
Tho I keep searching for an answer  
I never seem to find what Im looking for  
Oh Lord I pray you give me strength to carry on  
Cause I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams  
  
Here I go again on my own  
Goin down the only road Ive ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone  
An Ive made up my mind I aint wasting no more time  
  
Just another heart in need of rescue  
Waiting on loves sweet charity  
An Im gonna hold on for the rest of my days  
Cause I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams  
  
And here I go again on my own  
Goin down the only road Ive ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone  
An Ive made up my mind I aint wasting no more time  
But here I go again here I go again  
Here I go again here I go  
  
Cause I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams  
Here I go again on my own  
Goin down the only road Ive ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone  
An Ive made up my mind I aint wasting no more time  
Here I go again on my own  
Goin down the only road Ive ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone  
Cause I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams  
  
Here I go again on my own  
Goin down the only road Ive ever known  
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
