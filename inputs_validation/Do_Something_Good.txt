Verse 1  
I smoke two joints before I play video games  
Then I get 10000 points  
I flew around this planet only yesterday  
Because I am an alien  
  
PreChorus  
I seen this galaxy and Milky Way  
I even watched the sun  
I got a J givin me my light away  
Because I dont get drunk  
  
Chorus  
Lets do something good today before its too late  
Lets do something good today before its too late this is our day  
Lets do something good today before its too late  
Said lets do something good today before its too late before its too late  
  
Verse 2  
Three more joints and Im still playing video games  
Cant even count the points  
Play it til my fingers bleed  
Who said that tomorrow will be guaranteed  
  
Chorus  
Lets do something good today before its too late  
Lets do something good today before its too late this is our day  
Lets do something good today before its too late  
Said lets do something good today before its too late before its too late  
  
Bridge  
And then we fly away and we aint running out of fuel  
Im running off of you Im running off of you  
And then we fly away and then we fly away and we aint running out of fuel  
Im running off of you Im running off of you and then we fly  
  
Chorus  
Lets do something good today before its too late  
Lets do something good today before its too late this is our day  
Lets do something good today before its too late  
Said lets do something good today before its too late before its too late
