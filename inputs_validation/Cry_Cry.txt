You work hard you make money  
There aint no one in the world who can stop you  
You work hard you went hungry  
Now the taxman is out to get you  
  
You worked hard  
And slaved and slaved for years  
Break your back sweat a lot

And hell steal your shit and think that its funny  
Like the Beatles he aint human  
Now the taxman is out to get you  
  
You worked hard  
And slaved and slaved for years  
You played  
And you played and played for years  
Taxman Mr Heath Hes a thief
