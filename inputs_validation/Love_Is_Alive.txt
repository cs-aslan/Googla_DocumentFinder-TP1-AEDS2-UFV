Love aint a candle  
It doesnt burn for one night  
And need the dark to shine  
Love is alive  
  
And love aint just a word  
In every dictionary  
With no where defined  
Love is a man and hes mine  
  
Chorus  
Love is alive  
And at our breakfast table  
Everyday of the week  
Love is alive  
And it grows everyday and night  
Even in our sleep  
Love is alive  
And its made a happy woman out of me  
Oh love is alive  
And here by me  
  
Love aint just a moon  
A distant far away dream  
That needs the night to rise  
Love is alive  
And love aint just a song  
Sweet words of music  
To go dancin by  
Love is a man and hes mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Love is alive here by me
