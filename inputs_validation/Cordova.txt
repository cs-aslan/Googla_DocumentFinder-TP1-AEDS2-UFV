The volunteers come for your prayers  
And some souvenirs  
With ivory skin and boycott lessons  
Year after year  
  
Chorus  
Well Im tracing your face up in the space of the bottom bunk  
Oh Cordova  
Where I cried and I cried  
I knew I was trading on things that I didnt have  
The things that I didnt have  
  
Now you come to me  
With revolutions infidelity  
With blacklisted friends and Tupperware kin  
And your big history  
  
Chorus  
  
I memorize the lullabies  
Of dwindling lives  
The lay of the land the touch of each hand  
We lose by and by  
  
Chorus
