I was sittin down in Hong Kong in a bar  
Picking and a singing my way west with my guitar  
I talked to some old sailor just to pass away the time  
And he said something that stuck in my mind  
He said the story of your life is in your face  
Its written there in little subtle lines  
The story of your life is in your face  
Whats written on your face has been heavy on your mind  
He touched my face with his hands old and frail  
They were scared and weather beaten by the oceans he had sailed  
He said its written in your face the times that youve been hurt  
And he said mighty is the power of the skirt  
And he said the story of your life is in your face  
Its written there in little subtle lines  
The story of your life is in your face  
Whats written on your face has been heavy on your mind  
He said the lines say youre a travelin man  
I said that aint no revelation seein where I am  
He said in this ole world our paths may never cross again  
Just remember what Im tellin you my friend  
He said the story of your life is in your face  
Its written there in little subtle lines  
The story of your life is in your face  
Whats written on your face has been heavy on your mind  
There are some things we cannot seem to hide  
We sometimes lie about them cause it satisfies our pride  
There are some things we cant escape no matter how we try  
Cause its written in our face and in our eyes  
And he said the story of your life is in your face  
Its written there in little subtle lines  
The story of your life is in your face  
Whats written on your face has been heavy on your mind  
And he said the story of your life is in your face  
Its written there in little subtle lines  
The story of your life is in your face  
Whats written on your face has been heavy on your mind
