Baby now that youve made up your mind  
Im gonna let you go if thats what it takes to show love is blind  
I gave you the best love you ever had but it wasnt enough  
So if you think youre so smart go and play with your heart  
When you walk out the door youll realize what you never did before  
  
A million to one  thats what it will be  
A million to one  theres someone better than me  
A million to one  no you never will find  
A million to one  another love like mine  
  
Yeah we chose our sides and Ive been misunderstood  
But everytime I try to open your eyes Im damned and Im no good  
Day after day youre further away I cant take anymore  
So its time that you go but I want you to know I wont stand in your way  
Deep in my heart I know girl youre runnin away  
  
A million to one  
One of these days youll come out of your haze no matter what you do  
Itll be too late something good wont wait love is runnin out on you  
A million to one a million to one  
  
A million to one  listen to your heart girl  a million to one  oh  
A million to one  no you never will find  
A million to one  another love like mine  
A million to one  no you never will find  
A million to one  another love like mine  
A million to one repeats out
