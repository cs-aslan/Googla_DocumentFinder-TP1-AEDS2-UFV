Oh the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside  
Theyre drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide  
I live in another world where life and death are memorized  
Where the earth is strung with lovers pearls and all I see are dark eyes  
  
A cock is crowing far away and another soldiers deep in prayer  
Some mothers child has gone astray she cant find him anywhere  
But I hear another rum beating for the dead that rise  
Whom natures beast fear as they come and all I see are dark eyes  
  
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes  
They tell me revenge is sweet Im sure it is  
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized  
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes  
  
Oh the French girl shes in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel  
Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling god of speed and steel  
Oh time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that
flies  
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes
