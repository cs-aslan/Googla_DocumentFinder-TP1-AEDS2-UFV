Like bees with out the honey  
Or a sun that isnt sunny  
Eat a cookie without milk  
I wouldnt  
And it seems that you cant wear  
Just one shoe you need a pair  
Even if I wore them Which I dont  
I couldnt  
  
Underneath the same sky  
Even though youre not close by  
It feels just like  
Were right beside each other  
Even though were far apart  
Our friendship fills my heart  
Its so good to know  
Were under the same sky  
  
Every kind of game takes two  
I cant play without you  
I guess I better put my ball away now  
Even Bouncing is not as funny  
When you cant annoy your buddy  
Id fix things  
If I just could figure out how  
  
Underneath the same sky  
Even though youre not close by  
It feels just like  
Were right beside each other  
Even though were far apart  
Our friendship fills my heart  
Its so good to know  
Were under the same sky  
  
Harmonica  
  
Underneath the same sky  
Even though youre not close by  
It feels just like  
Were right beside each other  
Even though were far apart  
Our friendship fills my heart  
Its so good to know  
Were under the same  
Underneath the same sky  
So good to know were under the same sky  
Underneath the same sky  
Underneath the same sky  
  
Though my head is full of fluff  
This much I know is true  
Its lonely on my only  
Without you
