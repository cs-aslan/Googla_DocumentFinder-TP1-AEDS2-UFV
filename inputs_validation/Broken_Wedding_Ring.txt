A cowboy with his sweetheart stood beneath a starlit sky  
Tomorrow he was leaving for the lonesome prairie wide  
She said Ill be your lovingbride when you return someday  
He handed her a broken ring and to her he did say  
  
Youll find upon that ring sweetheart my name engraved in gold  
And I shall keep the other half which bears your name you know  
He went away to ride and toil this cowboy brave and bold  
But long he stayed and while he strayed the maidens love grew cold  
  
Three years had passed he did not some and Nell will wed tonight  
Her father said an Earl would make her happy home so bright  
The lights were gaily glowing as they stood there side by side  
Lets drink a toast to this young man and to his lovely bride  
  
Just then there stood within the door a figure tall and slim  
A handsome cowboy was their guest and slowly he walked in  
Ill drink with you a toast said he and quickly in her glass  
He dropped his half of wedding ring then anxiously he watched  
  
She tipped her glass and from her lips a ring fell shining bright  
The token she had longed to see lay there beneath the light  
Though years have been between us dear love won our last long fight  
Its you my cowboy sweetheart and my Jack Ill wed tonight
