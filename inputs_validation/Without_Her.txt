I spend the night in a chair  
Thinking shell be there but she never comes  
I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes  
Then I rise to spend another day without her  
Its just no good anymore  
When you walk through the door of an empty room  
You go inside and set a table for one  
Its no fun when you have to spend a day without her  
He burst a pretty balloon  
Took it to the moon  
It was such a beautiful thing  
But its ended now and it sounds like a lie  
I said Id rather die that be without her  
Love is such a beautiful thing  
When it knows how to swing  
And it grooves like a clock  
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part  
And its breaking my heart to spend another day without her  
I spend the night in a chair  
Thinking shell be there but she never comes  
I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes  
Then I rise to spend another day without her  
Cant go on without her  
Theres no song without her
