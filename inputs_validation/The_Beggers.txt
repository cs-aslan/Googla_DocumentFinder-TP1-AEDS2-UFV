Beggers  
Look down and see the beggers at your feet  
Look down and show some mercy if you can  
Look down and see the sweepings of the street  
Look down look down upon your fello man  
  
Gavroche  
How do you do my names Gavroche  
These are my people heres my patch  
Not much to look at nothing posh  
Nothing that youd call up to scratch  
This is my school my high society  
Here in the slums of San Michelle  
We live off crumbs of humble piety  
Tough on the teeth  but what the hell  
Think your poor Think your free  
Follow me Follow me  
  
Beggers  
Look down and show some mercy if you can  
Look down look down upon your fellow man  
  
Enjolras  
Where are the leaders of the land  
Where are the swells who run the show  
  
Marius  
Only one man and thats Lamarque  
Speaks for the people here to go  
  
Beggers  
See our children fed  
Help us in our shame  
Something for a crust of bread in Holy Jesus Name  
In the Lords Holy Name  
In His Name  
In His Name  
In His Name  
  
Marius  
Lamarque is ill and fading fast  
Wont last a week out so they say  
  
Enjolras  
With all the anger in the land  
How long before the judgment day  
Before we cut the fat ones down to size  
Before the barricades arise  
  
Gavroche  
Watch out for ol Thenardier  
All of his familys on the make  
Once ran a hash house down the way  
Bit of a swine and no mistake  
Hes got the gang the bleeding layabout  
Even his daughter does her share  
Thats Eponine she knows her way about  
Only a kid but hard to scare  
Do we care Not a cuss  
Long live us Long live us  
  
Beggers  
Look down and show some mercy if you can  
Look down look down upon your fellow man
