Who the hell are you to tell me  
What I am and whats my master plan  
What makes you think that it includes you  
Selfrighteous wealth  
Stop flattering yourself  
  
So when the smoke clears here I am  
Your reject allAmerican  
Sucking up your social sect  
Making you a nervous wreck  
To hell and back and hell again Ive gone  
Youre not my type  
Not my type  
  
Whats the difference between you and me  
I do what I want and you do what youre told  
So listen up and shut the hell up  
Its no big deal and Ill see you in hell  
  
So when the smoke clears here I am  
Your reject allAmerican  
Sucking up your social sect  
Making you a nervous wreck  
To hell and back and hell again Ive gone  
Youre not my type  
Not my type  
Not my type  
Youre not my type  
  
So when the smoke clears here I am  
Your reject allAmerican  
Falling from grace right on my face  
To hell and back and hell again Ive gone
