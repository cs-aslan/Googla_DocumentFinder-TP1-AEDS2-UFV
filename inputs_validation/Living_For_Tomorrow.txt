To make this world a better place  
  
Lets make this life  
A better life to live  
Stop to hate  
Learn to forgive  
  
Evil power can kill  
The human race  
If we give life  
A human face a human face  
  
And even if you say  
Were gonna die today  
Im still living for tomorrow  
Im living for toda

Whatever it will take
