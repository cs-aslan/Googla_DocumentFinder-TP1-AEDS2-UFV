You feel sad cause I got mad  
And Im sorry Im sorry  
Things I said made things seem bad  
But dont worry  
Cause its gonna be alright now  
Be okay  
You know I just dont think before I speak  
Ive been looking for to find  
Something to believe in my mind  
And I thought it was you  
  
All this time since youve been mine  
Ive been angry so angry  
Made it known I could make it alone  
But Im changing  
And Im gonna be alright now  
Be okay  
You know I just woke up and I see the way  
  
Chorus  
Dont give up on me so fast  
I see its me thats wrong at last  
Give me another chance  
  
Its so hard just to stay alive each day  
I really cant go on this way oh no  
Oh no  
  
Hey  
  
Chorus
