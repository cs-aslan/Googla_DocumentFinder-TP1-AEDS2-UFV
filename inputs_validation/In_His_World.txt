Every night I dream about him  
In my world of fantasy  
I pretend that were together  
In his world theres a garden in the moonlight  
In his world theres a sweet and gentle breeze  
In his world oh he tells me that he loves me  
Thats where my heart wants to be  
  
I saw a star falls from the heaven  
I hope the wish I made comes true  
I dont want to live without him  
In his world I can see a new tomorrow  
In his world where he gives his heart to me  
In his world we will share this love together  
Thats where my heart wants to be  
  
Why must I go on pretending  
Why cant I tell him how I feel  
These sweet dreams are never ending  
And this loneliness is real  
  
I saw a star fall from the heavens  
I hope the wish I made comes true  
I dont want to live without him  
In his world I can see a new tomorrow  
In his world where he gives his heart to me  
In his world we will share this love together  
Thats where my heart wants to be  
  
In his world theres a garden in the moonlight  
In his world theres a sweet and gentle breeze  
In his world oh he tells me that he loves me  
Thats where my heart wants to be
