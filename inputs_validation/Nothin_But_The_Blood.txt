What can wash away my sins  
Theres Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
What can make me whole again  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
This is all my righteousness  
Its nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
This is all my hope and peace  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
