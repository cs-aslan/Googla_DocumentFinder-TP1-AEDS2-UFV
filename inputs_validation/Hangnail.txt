My hopes just fell and I cant see  
The reason why why there is blood on my sleeve  
And all this time I thought it mine  
But its not its yours and  
  
Its not worth it for me gets harder every time call you  
This life you lead like swimming in a shiny ballroom  
Next time you bleed right about this time tomorrow  
Next time you steal better ask before you borrow  
  
And I dont see too well dont sing too well  
And I settle to scream  
Just grab your shit and leave with it  
They wont make no statues of you  
  
Its not worth it for me gets harder every time call you  
This life you lead like swimming in a shiny ballroom  
Next time you bleed right about this time tomorrow  
Next time you steal better ask before you borrow  
This label thief find a better title suited for you  
This tidal wave is coming down upon you  
  
This time Ive forgotten  
I swear this shit was rotten  
This time I believe it  
Cause Ive seen the shit youre needin  
  
Its not worth it for me gets harder every time call you  
This life you lead like swimming in a shiny ballroom  
Next time you bleed right about this time tomorrow  
Next time you steal better ask before you borrow  
This label thief find a better title suited for you  
This tidal wave is coming down upon you
