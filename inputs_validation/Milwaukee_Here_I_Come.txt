Im gonna get on that old turnpike and Im gonna ride  
Im gonna leave this town til you decide  
Which one you want the most them opry stars or me  
Milwaukee here I come from nashville tennessee  
  
Milwaukee is where we were before we came here  
Working in a brewery making the finest beer  
You came to me on a payday night said lets go to tennessee  
So we drove to nashville to the grand ole opry  
  
Im gonna get on that old turpike and Im gonna ride  
Im gonna leave this town til you decide  
Which one you want the most those opry stars or me  
Milwaukee here I come from nashville tennessee  
  
We were watching tv ernest tubb was singing loud  
I said thats the man for me I love him theres no doubt  
Im leaving you and going now to find out where hes at  
If I cant get him Ill settle for that bluegrass lester flatt  
  
Im gonna get on that old turnpike and Im gonna ride  
Im gonna leave this town til you decide  
Which one you want the most  
Me or jerry lee  
Milwaukee here I come from nashville tennessee  
Milwaukee here I come from nashville tennessee
