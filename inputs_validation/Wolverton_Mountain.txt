They say dont go on Wolverton Mountain  
If youre looking for a wife  
Cause Clifton Clowers has a pretty young daughter  
Hes mighty handy with a gun and a knife  
  
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey  
And Wolverton mountain protects her there  
The bears and birds tell Clifton Clowers  
If a stranger should wander there  
  
All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain  
I want his daughter for my wife  
Ill take my chances and climb that mountain  
Though Clifton Clowers he may take my life  
  
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey  
And Wolverton mountain protects her there  
The bears and birds tell Clifton Clowers  
If a stranger should wander there  
  
Im going up on Wolverton Mountain  
Its too lonesome down here below  
Its just not right to hide his daughter  
From the one who loves her so  
  
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey  
And Wolverton mountain protects her there  
The bears and birds tell Clifton Clowers  
If a stranger should wander there  
  
But I dont care about Clifton Clowers  
Im gonna climb up on his mountain  
Im gonna take the girl I love  
I dont care about Clifton Clowers  
  
Im a gonna climb up on that mountain  
And Ill get the one I Iove  
I dont care about Clifton Clowers  
Im gonna find the one I love  
  
I dont care about Clifton Clowers  
Im gonna find the one I love
