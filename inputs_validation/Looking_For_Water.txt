Silver leaves are spinning round  
Take my hand as we go down and down and down  
Looking for water  
But I lost God in a New York minute  
Dont know about you but my hearts not in it  
Looking looking looking  
Im looking for water  
Im looking for water  
Looking looking looking  
I cant breathe the air  
Cant raise the fight  
Cause all weve got left is a beat in the night  
And Im  
Looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking looking  
  
Take my hand as we go down and down  
Leave it all behind nothing will be found  
Im looking for water  
Im looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking looking  
Im looking for water  
Looking everywhere  
Looking for water  
Looking here and there  
Im looking for water  
Im looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking looking  
  
I cant live in this cage  
I cant eat this candy  
To the ends of the Earth  
To this pain in my head  
The look in your eyes  
That never means never  
The dawns early light  
Baby dumb is forever  
  
Looking looking  
Looking looking  
  
Looking for water  
Looking looking  
Im looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking looking  
Im looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking looking  
Im looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking looking  
Im looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking looking  
Im looking for water  
Looking for water
