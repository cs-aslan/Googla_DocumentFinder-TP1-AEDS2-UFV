Floatin in the lower nine  
Waitin for a boat to throw me a line  
See my Stella smile  
Sittin on a roof eatin alligator pie  
First day the water rise  
Second day the sun is high  
Third day Stella cries  
Cause night times dark as a dead mans eyes  
  
Lord  
Tell me when help is gonna come  
Stella said Daddy when you gonna put me in a song  
  
Storm went right on by  
Thanked the Lord everybodys alright  
Dont mean to throw off a second line  
But the Devil broke the levee and left us here to die  
  
Stella said Daddy when you gonna put me in a song  
  
Like a dance hall to get yall down  
Like a dance hall to get yall down  
Like a dance hall to get yall down  
  
All the things we know and everything we hope for  
All the things we wanted  
Everything that was sure  
Now there is a scar where the old men used to be  
The corner store and market where Stella used to sing to me  
Grace is all Im asking  
When will Grace return  
Grace is all Im asking  
  
Remember how it feels  
Lazy days in the summertime  
Then my Stella smiled  
Stella said Daddy when you gonna put me in a song  
  
Tell me Lord when help is gonna come  
She said Daddy when you gonna put me in a song
