To the souls desires  
The body listens  
What the flesh requires  
Keeps the heart imprisoned  
  
What the spirit seeks  
The mind will follow  
When the body speaks  
All else is hollow  
  
Im just an angel  
Driving blindly  
Through this world  
  
Im just a slave here  
At the mercy  
Of a girl  
  
Oh I need your tenderness  
Oh I need your touch  
Oh I dream of one caress  
Oh I pray too much  
  
To the souls desires  
The body listens  
What the flesh requires  
Keeps the heart imprisoned  
  
What the spirit seeks  
The mind will follow  
When the body speaks  
All else is hollow  
  
You keep me waiting  
For the promise  
That is mine  
  
Please stop debating  
Please stop wasting  
Your time  
  
Oh I need your tenderness  
Oh I need your touch  
Oh I dream of one caress  
Oh I pray too much
