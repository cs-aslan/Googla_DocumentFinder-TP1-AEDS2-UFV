Nailed to the cross by just words  
Crucifixion complete  
Close enough to the fire  
To feel temptations heat  
Its gone away to taste the ground  
Replaced by the incessant sound of fear  
  
Theres a ring in my ears  
Im bleeding from my heart  
Far away from love  
The execution starts  
Made us what we are today  
A lonely pile of disarray  
  
We are the children of a new regime  
We are the children of a new machine  
  
Mass production thought controlled  
No I never knew my heart  
No Never knew the love  
That made them fall apart  
Its gone away to taste the ground  
Replaced by the incessant sound we hear  
  
We are the children  
Ya the children  
What of the children  
We are the children of the new machine  
What of the children  
We are the children of the new machine  
The new machine
