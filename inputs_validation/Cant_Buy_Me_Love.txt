Cant buy me love love  
Cant buy me love  
  
Ill buy you a diamond ring my friend  
If it makes you feel all right  
Ill get you anything my friend  
If it makes you feel all right  
Cause I dont care too much for money  
For money cant buy me love  
  
Ill give you all Ive got to give  
If you say you love me too  
I may not have a lot to give  
But what Ive got Ill give to you  
For I dont care too much for money  
For money cant buy me love  
  
Cant buy me love  
Everybody tells me so  
Cant buy me love  
No no no no  
  
Say you dont need no diamond ring  
And Ill be satisfied  
Tell me that you want those kind of things  
That money just cant buy  
For I dont care too much for money  
For money cant buy me love  
  
Cant buy me love  
Everybody tells me so  
Cant buy me love  
No no no no  
  
Say you dont need no diamond ring  
And Ill be satisfied  
Tell me that you want those kind of things  
That money just cant buy  
For I dont care too much for money  
For money cant buy me love  
Ooh cant buy me love love  
Cant buy me love no
