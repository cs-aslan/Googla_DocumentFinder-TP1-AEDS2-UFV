Wed like to introduce you to the nature of our trials  
Wed love the chance to bring your elders down  
So fix your Dad a drink cause were gonna need to think  
Now youre a plane we wont need them around anymore  
  
We done a lot of dumb things now sure hope we do some more  
And well wait all summer just to piss on your door  
The wing commanders sister is a golden haired surprise  
I cant walk far but I can shoot for miles  
  
And my radar can see anyone over thirteen  
Now youre grown up we dont need you around anymore  
We done a lot of dumb things now sure hope we do some more  
Its the last summer so in our dust you will crawl
