Hold me take me in your arms one last time  
I cant bear the thought of your leaving  
This night oh so black  
The starts dont shine  
And youre never never coming back  
  
Chorus  
Where are you running to now  
Where are you running to now  
Oh babe  
Where are you running to now  
Where are you running to now  
Oh yeah  
  
Silence  
Ill never hear your sweet voice in my ear  
Just a lonely sound as you disappear  
In the night the clouds are black  
The starts have died  
And youre never never coming back  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont you know that its not easy  
Dont you know that its so hard to take  
Where are you now is someone with you  
Ill have to accept that youre not coming back  
No no more no more no more no more  
  
Chorus  
  
Goodbye babe so long darlin  
Im never gonna see you again  
Goodbye babe goodbye babe
