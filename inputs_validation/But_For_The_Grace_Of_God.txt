I can hear the neighbors  
Theyre arguin again  
And there hasnt been peace on our street  
Since who knows when  
I dont mean to listen in  
But the shoutin is so loud  
I turn up the radio to drown it out  
And silently I say a little prayer  
  
But for the grace of God go I  
I mustve been born a lucky guy  
Heaven only knows how Ive been blessed  
With the gift of your love  
And I look around and all I see  
Is your happiness embracing me  
Oh Lord Id be lost  
But for the grace of God  
  
I can see that old man  
Hes walking past our door  
And Ive been told that hes rich  
But he seems so poor  
Cause no one comes to call on him  
And his phone it never rings  
He wanders through his empty home  
Surrounded by his things  
And silently I say a little prayer yes I do  
  
But for the grace of God go I  
I mustve been born a lucky guy  
Heaven only knows how Ive been blessed  
With the gift of your love  
And I look around and all I see  
Is your happiness embracing me  
Oh Lord Id be lost  
But for the grace of God  
  
I look around and all I see  
Is your happiness embracing me  
Oh Lord Id be lost  
But for the grace of God  
Oh Lord Id be lost  
But for the grace of God yeah  
  
Ooo ooo Id be lost  
But for the grace of God yeah  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
