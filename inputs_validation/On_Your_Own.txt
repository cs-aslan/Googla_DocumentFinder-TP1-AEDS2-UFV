Tell me what you seen  
Was it a dream  
Was I in it  
Life seems so obscene  
Until its over  
Who knows  
All I want is someone who can fill the hole  
In the life I know  
In between life and death  
When theres nothing left  
Do you wanna know  
You come in on your own  
And you leave on your own  
Forget the lovers youve know  
And your friends on your own  
Tell me if its true  
That I need you  
You are changing  
Ive seen this road before down on this floor  
It is hurting me  
All I want is someone  
Who can fill the hole  
In the life I know  
In between life and death  
When theres nothing left  
Do you want to know  
You come in on your own  
And you leave on your own  
Forget the lovers youve know  
And your friends on your own  
You come in on your own  
And you leave on your own  
Forget the lovers youve know  
And your friends you have told  
Lies  
Ive got to get rid of this hole inside  
Lies  
Ive got to get rid of this hole inside  
Im coming in on my own  
Im coming in on my own  
Im coming in on my own  
Lies  
Ive got to get rid of this hole inside  
Lies  
Ive got to get rid of this hole inside  
Lies  
Ive got to get rid of this hole inside
