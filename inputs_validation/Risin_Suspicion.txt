Slipped in this morning with the lights still in your eyes  
You got all tangled up in your little white lies  
I wont let it go wont let it get that far  
I swear Im gonna catch you with your fingers in the honey jar  
  
Ann chuckles thats right  
  
Ill get to the truth if its the last thing I do  
I got my risin suspicions got me eye on you  
Do you think I dont see it do you take me for a fool   
Got my risin suspicion got my eye on you  
  
If you got something to say well I think you better tell us now  
Your deluding yourself if you think Im getting jealous baby  
Ill get to the truth if its the last thing I do  
I got my risin suspicion Got my eye on you  
Do you think I dont see it do you take me for a fool   
Got my risin suspicion got my eye on you  
  
2 x 4 x 6 x 9 just dont add up no more than your lies  
Ill get to the truth if its the last thing I do  
Ive got my risin suspicion got my eye on you  
Do you think I dont see it do you take me for a fool   
Ive got my risin suspicion  emm hmmm  
Ill get to the truth if its the last thing I do  
I got my Risin suspicion I got my eye on you
