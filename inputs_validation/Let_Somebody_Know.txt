Love we all hope to find  
Itll come so easy or can take its time  
But Ive never given up along the way  
  
One day youre gonna raise your blinds  
And every little dew drop is a treasured find oh my  
When you say the things you have to say  
Wake up and the day is dawning  
Its another chance to change your mind  
Reaching for the stars around you  
I found you  
  
Let somebody know what you really love  
Show somebody just what youre made of  
Always in a rush dont you see the sign  
You can always take the time  
Let somebody know  
  
Just when you think you got it done  
In just a moment it can turn around oh my  
When youre wishing for yesterday  
Wake up and the day is dawning  
Its another chance to change your mind  
Reaching for the stars around you  
I found you  
  
Let somebody know what you really love  
Show somebody just what youre made of  
Always in a rush dont you see the sign  
You can always take the time  
  
To let somebody know that you really care  
Let somebody see what you have to share  
Oh yeah  
Its a simple thing  
To let somebody know  
  
Always in a rush dont you see the sign  
You can always take the time  
Let somebody feel the tears that you cry  
Let them know the love is still alive oh alive  
Its a simple thing  
  
To let somebody know somebody  
Let somebody know somebody  
Let somebody know oh yeah somebody  
Somebody baby  
  
Let somebody know oh yeah somebody  
You gotta let somebody know somebody somebody  
Let somebody know somebody
