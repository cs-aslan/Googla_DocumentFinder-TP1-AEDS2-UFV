Here we go 2 1 2 3  
  
I want a woman like Marilyn Monroe  
The kind of woman thatd never say no  
The kind of woman thatd make you scream  
Thats the girl o my dreams  
  
I want a woman thatll treat me right  
Give me good lovin all through the night  
Take her on a date shes my machine  
Thats the girl o my dreams  
  
Chorus  
Oh the girl o my dreams  
Oh listen people thats the girl o my dreams  
  
I want a woman like Lauren Bacall  
Old and wrinkled but knows it all  
Got all the little tricks thatll make me cream  
Thats the girl o my dreams  
  
I want a woman thatll wash my hair  
Even wash my underwear  
Always smilin never mean  
Thats the girl o my dreams  
  
Chorus  
  
I would say that Ure a chauvinist  
  
No I just got a lot of things that are on my list  
  
Yeah if she couldnt hang would you give her the fist  
  
No man Id sit her right down and give her a little kiss  
  
Oh I need a woman like Lena Horne  
Knowed she was funky since the day she was born  
Lenas mama say Doc is it a girl  
Doc say And how  
Lena smiled slapped the doctor and said  
Sucker Im runnin things now  
  
Chorus
