Goodbye romance cant take a chance  
On loves painful games  
Ive called too many times on a sweetheart tree  
  
Lady lost now I count the cost  
Nothing seems to change  
Ive called too many times on the sweetheart tree  
  
Too many times  
Ooh love you made a fool out of me  
You won again  
So lovin set me free  
  
I need some time to change my mind  
Before I try again  
Ive been too many times to the sweetheart tree  
  
Some go some then lay in tow  
But love just dont come free  
Ive called too many names on the sweetheart tree  
  
Too many times  
Ooh love you made a fool out of me  
You won again  
So lovin set me free  
  
Too many times  
Ooh love you made a fool out of me  
You won again  
So lovin set me free  
  
Goodbye romance cant take a chance  
On loves painful games  
Ive called too many names on the sweetheart tree
