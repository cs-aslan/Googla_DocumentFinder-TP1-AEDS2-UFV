I dont know where Im going  
But I do know where Ive been  
I wonder if Im growing  
Forever chasing wind  
Ive got to keep on moving  
Destination still unknown  
The more I keep on looking  
The more I feel so alone  
  
Chorus  
I never ask you where youre going so dont ask me  
Where are you going  
Not everybody knows where theyre supposed to be  
Where are you going  
So if youll please point me in the right vicinity  
Where are you going  
I never ask you where youre going so dont ask me  
  
Im not so good so far  
Fell off the beaten track  
cause sometimes we go forward  
Must take two steps back  
  
Chorus  
solo  
Chorus
