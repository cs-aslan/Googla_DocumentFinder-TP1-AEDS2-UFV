Again its around seven  
Im burning like a candlelight  
I dont know where Im going  
But Im ready for this night  
  
Youd better run for cover  
Before I start to smile  
No way theres time for wasting  
Never walk in a line  
Never walk in a line  
Oh yeah  
  
And I just keep going  
Forget these boring times  
And Im hungry for desire  
No way to live in a line  
  
Youd better run for cover  
Before I start to smile  
No way theres time for wasting  
Never walk in a line  
  
Reckless and mean Im ruling the scene  I never get enough  
Acting the night  Im gone with the light  I cant  
get enough  
I never get enough

get enough  
  
Reckless and mean Im ruling the scene  I never get enough  
Acting the night  Im gone with the light  I cant  
get enough  
I never get enough
