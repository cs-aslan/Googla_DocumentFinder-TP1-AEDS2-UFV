So your girlfriend wants to be a popstar  
And beat the charts outta me  
She wants to move a million units man  
Probably just to prove she can  
And after a couple of hits  
Shell be buying a new pair of mitts  
I can see just where shes heading  
Shes as predictable as Armageddon  
  
Oh they dont make em like they use to  
They dont make em like they use to  
No they dont make em like they use to  
You should have just stuck with me  
  
Your girlfriend wants to be a popstar  
And live in Primrose Hill  
Shell join the meritocracy  
And get to meet all of rocks aristocracy  
And be someone everyone knows  
Who all the designers send all their new clothes  
But when she starts to look like Kylie Minogue  
She might even get her picture in Vogue  
  
Baby they dont make em like they use to  
They dont make em like they use to  
No they dont make em like they use to  
You should have just stuck with me  
  
Your baby wants to be a popstar  
Probably just to spite me  
She thinks its all so easy to get to the top  
But a girl like that she wont know where to stop  
And when her most recent therapist  
Suggests that maybe she become a Buddhist  
She might even consider giving up red meat  
Man youre gonna look back to when your life was so sweet  
  
You know they just dont make em like they used to  
No they dont make em like they use to  
They just dont make em like they use to
