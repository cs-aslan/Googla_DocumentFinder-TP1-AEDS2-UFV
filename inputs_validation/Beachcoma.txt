The point at which you looked at me  
Has always being part of my brain  
Now my mind is in a whirl  
And it seems  
  
I am not the same  
My dear and special friend  
Theres never a point at which we ever loved  
Im in mine and mine is fine  
  
Im wrapped up in shining days  
Blackbirds in summer time  
They find a low  
I end up being you  
  
My dear and special friend  
Theres never a point at which we ever loved  
The point at which I looked at you  
Has always being part of my brain  
  
Now my mind is in a whirl  
And it seems  
I am not the same  
My dear and special friend  
  
Theres never a point at which we ever loved
