Strangers always got some mess to spread  
But I have learned to flick them off  
Cant walk a mile in my YSLs  
I strap them on and I walk it off  
  
Got em saying I cant believe  
She did it no she didnt  
My wild factors got them crazy  
Got em saying yea she did it  
But I cant believe it  
Never said you cant believe  
  
Even if they try  
They still cant walk a mile in these shoes  
They couldnt even lace them up right  
Honey these ones are too big to fill  
Ten million men cant walk a mile in these shoes  
  
My struts so fierce  
Stevens gotten mad at me  
Laugh and talk behind my back  
But theyll never get the best of me  
I see em doing my dance  
I hear em singing my song  
Im surpassing the rest  
Cause thats how I was raised to do it  
  
Got em saying I cant believe  
She did it no she didnt  
My wild factors got them crazy  
  
Got em saying yea she did it  
But I cant believe it  
Never said you cant believe  
  
Even if they try  
They still cant walk a mile in these shoes  
They couldnt even lace them up right  
Honey these ones are too big to fill  
Ten million men cant walk a mile in these shoes  
  
Even if they try  
They still cant walk a mile in these shoes  
They couldnt even lace them up right  
Honey these ones are too big to fill  
Ten million men cant walk a mile in these shoes  
  
Im walkin tall  
I dont let their hatred test me  
They bite the dust  
Head over water they still cant breathe  
My feet pound the ground  
As I stomp it out  
I dare you to walk a mile in my shoes  
  
Even if they try  
They still cant walk a mile in these shoes  
They couldnt even lay some up right  
Honey these walks are too big to fill  
Ten million men cant walk a mile in these shoes
