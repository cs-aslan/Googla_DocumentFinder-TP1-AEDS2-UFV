wang chung  
The world in which we live is peopled by people who  
Fuck shit screw everybody dont care swear  
Do things without a care are seen everywhere  
And write about each other  
The world in which we live is peopled by people who  
Cant afford to eat cant make ends meet  
Got nowhere to sleep cant feel the heat  
Cant get out  
Cant find a voice to scream it out  
The world in which we live  
The world on which all we are depends  
Whoever could forgive  
The way we treat the world in which we live  
Chorus  
The world is a mosaic upon a golden floor  
Moving silently darkly through space  
And our lives are the fragments and all thats gone before  
Broken jewels in excrement base  
Millions over millions are the world  
Oh the world in which we live  
Millions over millions are the world  
Oh the world in which we live  
The world in which we live  
The world on which all we are depends  
Whoever could forgive  
The way we treat the world in which we live  
The world in which we live is peopled by people who  
Get up stand up speak up fight  
And do all the things that they think are necessary and right  
The world in which we live is peopled by people who  
Believe what they hold to be true to be true for everybody  
Repeat chorus  
Millions over millions are the world  
Oh the world in which we live  
Millions over millions are the world  
Oh the world in which we live
