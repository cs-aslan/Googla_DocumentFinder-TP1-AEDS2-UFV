Well honey did I ever tell you just how wonderful you are  
Every time you hold me Ill be floatin with the stars in the sky  
I wonder why I guess its love love love love  
Well baby did I ever tell you that youre the greatest guy  
Honey are you with me when I look into your eyes  
I wonder why I wonder why I guess its love love love love  
Well now dont you know you send me where I never been before  
I just want to let you know I love you so  
Well I like to hear you talkin but youre wastin your time  
Youre not playin nothin that I dont already know  
Well baby did I ever tell you that you got what it takes  
And every time you tuck me in your arms I shake  
I wonder why I wonder why I guess its love love love love  
 steel   
Well now dont you know you send me  
I guess its love love love love I guess its love love love love
