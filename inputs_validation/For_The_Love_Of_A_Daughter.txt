Four years old  
With my back to the door  
All I could hear  
Was the family war  
Your selfish hands  
Always expecting more  
Am I your child  
Or jut a charity award  
  
Chorus  
You have a hollowed out heart  
But its heavy in your chest  
I tried so hard to fight it but its hopeless  
Hopeless  
Youre hopeless  
Oh father  
Please father  
Id love to leave you alone  
But I cant let you go  
Oh father  
Please father  
Put the bottle down  
For the love of a daughter  
  
Its been five years  
Since weve spoken last  
And you cant take back  
What we never had  
I can be manipulated  
Only so many times  
Before even I Love You  
Starts to sound like a lie  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont you remember Im your baby girl  
How you push me our of your world  
Lied to your flesh and your blood  
Put your hands on the ones that you swore ou loved  
Dont you remember Im your baby girl  
How could you throw me right out of your world  
So young when the pain had begun  
Now forever afraid of being loved  
  
Oh father  
Please father  
Id love to leave you alone but I cant let you go  
Oh father  
Please father  
Put the bottle down  
For the love of a daughter  
For the love of a daughter
