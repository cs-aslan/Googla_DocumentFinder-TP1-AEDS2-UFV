These have been quiet days  
When was the last time I wanted to sing  
Last few dying days hanging on  what will they bring  
Even you and me  
We keep coming apart  
And its a wrong thing  
We goota look right at each other and say it  
Turn on the radio and play it  
And fall in love again  
Can you feel the light shine  
You now this songs yours and mine  
Aint it good to know youve got a place to go  
Where the melodys fine  
Sometimes Im not so strong  
And even now I could be wrong  
But if you love me like music  
Ill be your song  
  
Lately the days been grey  
And times been hard  
Man up in town putting everybody down  
Watch him play his card  
When you get free come on home to me  
Im gonna lay it down  
We got love  weve got to feel it and show it  
Make each other really know it  
And fall in love again  
Weve got to be friends
