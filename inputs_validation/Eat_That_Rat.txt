You dont want to share with anyone else  
You got all the money you got all the wealth  
You got all the buildings and the factories  
You got all the power and the ceremonies  
  
You wanna play a game of cat and mouse  
With the President in the White House  
This is a hungry world there are months to feed  
There are millionaires with more than they need  
  
Eat that rat Eat that rat  
Eat that rat Eat that rat

Dont believe what youve been told  
You cant change a turd into gold  
Somehow we get all these creeps in control  
It makes me throw up in the toilet bowl  
  
You thieving whore you hustle for bucks  
You take the money and you shoot it up  
Thats the breaks its the chance you take  
Get it together for your childrens sake  
  
Eat that rat Eat that rat  
Eat that rat Eat that rat
