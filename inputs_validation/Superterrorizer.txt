Im your suicidal doomsday machine  
Bestowing my grace on everything  
My ill will shall never leave  
Embracing until you cannot breathe  
Superterrorizer  
Superterrorizer  
Crashing burning in you I confide  
Ill drink and spew all your bloodstained pride  
Youre just a pinball inside my machine  
Until you reach the falls my closing stream  
Superterrorizer  
Superterrorizer  
Superterrorizer  
Superterrorizer
