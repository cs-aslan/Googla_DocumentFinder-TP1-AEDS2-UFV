Every day I get up in the morning and go to work  
And do my job whatever  
I need some  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Everybodys at war these days  
Lets have a minisurrender  
I need some  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Everybodys had to hurt about it  
No one wants to go without it  
Its so hard to find it  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Every night I come home exhausted  
From trying to get along  
I need some  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Everybodys joining up to fight  
For the right to be wrong  
I need some  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Some nights I drive my car  
Up and down the boulevard  
Its so hard to find it  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Everybodys had to hurt about it  
No one wants to go without it  
Its so hard to find it  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Some nights I drive my car  
Up and down the boulevard  
Its so hard to find it  
Sentimental hygiene  
  
Sentimental hygiene  
I need some  
Sentimental hygiene
