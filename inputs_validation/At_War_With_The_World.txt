Hit me like a hammer to my head  
We thrashed in bed baby  
Drove a truck right through my life  
Struck me like a knife  
Theres a finger in my pie someone elses guy  
Caught you with your pants down fingers in the till  
Caught you stealing something my last thrill  
  
Chorus  
At war with the world as this life unfurls  
Ooh better get ready  
At war with the world as this life unfurls  
Better get ready  
Living like a hound dog whos not fed  
Lifes one big bed baby  
From the trash right on the street and anyone you meet  
Trying to make the first glance and I doubt you will last  
Caught you with your pants down fingers in the till  
I guess Ive swallowed lifes hardest pill  
Chorus  
  
Instrumental  
  
Repeat chorus twice
