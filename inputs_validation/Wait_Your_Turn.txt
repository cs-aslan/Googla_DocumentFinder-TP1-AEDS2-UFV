Its just the way  
The game is played  
Its best if you just  
Wait your turn  
  
The wait is ova  
The wait is ova  
The wait is ova  
The wait is ova  
The wait is ova  
The wait is ova  
The wait is ova  
The wait is ova  
  
I pitch with a grenade  
Swing away  
If youre feeling brave  
Theres no time out in my game  
Theres so much power  
In my name  
If you pop off and you say it  
Steady Im gon do the wave  
Im gonna do the wave  
  
Im such a  
Such a lady  
You dont have to be  
So afraid  
Cause I got room  
Up on my team  
You can play  
But hold up  
  
Its just the way  
The game is played  
Its best if you just  
Wait your turn  
  
Its getting crowded  
Over here  
But babe  
The wait is ova  
Sometimes it takes  
A thousand tries  
To win  
The wait is ova  
  
Fumble  
Dont you fumble  
Thats a flag on the play  
Babe if you dont wanna  
Then you dont have to wait  
But together  
We gon be taking over  
  
Its just the way  
The game is played  
Its best if you just  
Wait your turn  
  
So you dont wanna wait  
I hate to hear  
Thats such a shame  
Cause if you playing tight wears  
And no diamond in my ears  
Then you already underway  
  
I know you want to win  
And you wish  
I would let you in  
Get in line over here  
You can play  
But hold up  
  
Its just the way  
The game is played  
Its best if you just  
Wait your turn  
  
Its getting crowded  
Over here  
But babe  
The wait is ova  
Sometimes it takes  
A thousand tries  
To win  
The wait is ova  
  
Fumble  
Dont you fumble  
Thats a flag on the play  
Babe if you dont wanna  
Then you dont have to wait  
But together  
We gon be taking over  
  
Its just the way  
The game is played  
Its best if you just  
Wait your turn  
  
Baby put the work in  
Like a champion  
But the crowd is screaming  
With their hands way up  
Couldnt be with no one else  
Youre the only way  
I win  
  
Baby got the whole world  
Standing up  
Damn Im glad I picked ya  
Took a chance on love  
Baby love  
  
The time is now  
And now  
The wait is ova  
  
The wait is ova  
The wait is ova  
The wait is ova  
The wait is ova  
just wait your turn  
The wait is ova  
The wait is ova  
The wait is ova  
The wait is ova  
just wait your turn  
  
Its getting crowded  
Over here  
But babe  
The wait is ova  
Sometimes it takes  
A thousand tries  
To win  
The wait is ova  
  
Fumble  
Dont you fumble  
Thats a flag on the play  
Babe if you dont wanna  
Then you dont have to wait  
But together  
We gon be taking over  
  
Its just the way  
The game is played  
Its best if you just  
Wait your turn
