Singing a song to myself  
Im singing a song to myself  
  
Pictures in your mind  
Out of focus and unkind  
Picture me  
I picture you  
Outside the sun is shining  
At the back of your mind theres a memory  
  
By the time you hear this Ill be gone  
  
Chorus  
Im singing a song to myself  
Cause I dont belong any longer  
Just making it up in my head  
This feeling is strong and getting stronger  
Do you see the light  
Tell me you see the light  
Just making it up in my head  
Cause I need someone to sing along with  
  
Sing along with  
  
Pictures in your heart  
Out of focus torn apart  
Picture me  
I picture you  
Outside the moon is shining  
At the back of your mind theres a memory  
  
By the time you hear this Ill be gone  
  
Chorus  
  
Sing along with  
Yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Singing a song to myself
