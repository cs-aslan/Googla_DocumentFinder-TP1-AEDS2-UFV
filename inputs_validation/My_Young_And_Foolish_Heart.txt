My young and foolish heart  
Makes me do the things I shouldnt  
That nine times out of ten  
I wouldnt do  
My young and foolish heart  
Never lets me use discretion  
In my manner of expression  
Every time Im with you  
So if my arms enfold you  
While I speak of love  
Remember what I told you  
Upon my soul I cant control  
The recklessness of  
My young and foolish heart  
Can be choosey and selective  
But youre the one objective  
Of my young and foolish heart  
Bridge  
So if my arms enfold you  
While I speak of love  
Remember what I told you  
Upon my soul I cant control  
The recklessness of  
My young and foolish heart  
Can be choosey and selective  
But youre the one objective  
Of my young and foolish heart
