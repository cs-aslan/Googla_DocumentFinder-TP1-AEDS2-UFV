Maybe Im amazed of the way you love me all the time  
Maybe Im afraid of the way I love you  
Maybe Im amazed of the way you move me out of time  
And hung me on a line  
Maybe Im amazed of the way I really need you  
  
Maybe Im the one maybe Im the only one  
Whos in the middle of something  
That I dont really understand  
Maybe youre the man maybe youre the only man  
Who could ever help me  
Baby wont you help me understand  
  
Maybe Im amazed of the way youre with me all the time  
Maybe Im afraid of the way I leave you  
Maybe Im amazed of the way you help me sing my song  
You right me when Im wrong  
Maybe Im amazed at the way I really need you  
  
Maybe Im the one maybe Im the only one  
Whos in the middle of something  
That I dont really understand  
Maybe youre the man maybe youre the only man  
Who could ever help me  
Baby wont you help me understand  
  
Maybe Im the one maybe Im the only one  
Whos in the middle of something  
That I dont really understand  
Maybe youre the man maybe youre the only man  
Who could ever help me  
Baby wont you help me understand  
  
Maybe Im amazed of the way you love me all the time  
Maybe Im afraid of the way I love you  
Maybe Im amazed of the way you move me out of time  
And hung me on a line  
Maybe Im amazed of the way I really need you  
  
Maybe Im amazed  
Maybe Im amazed  
Maybe Im amazed  
Maybe Im amazed
