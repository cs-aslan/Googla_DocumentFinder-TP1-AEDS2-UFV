I got to see you baby I dont care  
It may be some place baby you say you where  
I had a dream about you baby  
A dream about you baby  
Late last night you come arollin across my mind  
  
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk  
You make me nervous when you start to talk  
I had a dream about you baby  
A dream about you baby  
Late last night you come arollin across my mind  
  
Standin on the highway you flag me down  
Said take me daddy to the nearest town  
I had a dream about you baby  
Had a dream about you baby  
Late last night you come arollin across my mind  
  
The join is jumpin its really somethin  
The beat is pumpin my heart is thumpin  
Spent my money on you honey  
My limbs are shakin my heart is breakin  
  
You kiss me baby in the coffee shop  
You made me so bad you gotta stop  
I had a dream about you baby  
Had a dream about you baby  
Late last night you come arollin across my mind  
  
The join in jumpin its really somethin  
The beat is pumpin my heart is thumpin  
Spent my money on you honey  
My limbs are shakin my heart is breakin  
  
You had a white rag wrapped around your head  
Wearing a long dress fire engine red  
I had a dream about you baby  
Had a dream about you baby  
Late last night you come arollin across my mind
