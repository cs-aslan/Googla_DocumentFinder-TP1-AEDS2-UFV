You could be the answer to my lonely dream  
Its my only dream  
Dream it every night  
Its about a girl who makes the waters still  
Takes my troubled mind  
And makes it all seem right  
  
Oh what a change what a change that would be  
I can feel it comin over me  
Maybe its strange strange to say  
But I cant remember how  
How it used to be  
  
You could be the answer or another dream  
Just another dream  
How will I know  
Im afraid to wake up now and face the day  
Comes the light of day  
Shell have to go or stay  
  
Oh what a change what a change that would be  
Just to wake and find you still here  
Cause every time time before  
When I open up my eyes  
You always disappear  
  
We could sit and hope that youll be seen  
We could talk about the world and in between  
And when the morning light was through  
Then I could see if it was really you
