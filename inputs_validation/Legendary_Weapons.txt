I flip goods like a stock trader get money  
Theodore rush the floor we attack like AlQaeda  
Suicide missionary black activist  
Nice with the tongue Im a verbal type masochist  
Tall body my skin got Teflon fibers  
Dodge bullets rock chains the size of barbed wire  
Roll big blunts a whole ounce of reefer  
Rocked that Black and Yellow before Wiz Khalifa  
Its a killer bee color scheme I blow mega cream  
Bingos face before I scream know what I mean  
Like Billie Jean lightin up the floor when I walk  
This is Staten Island New York eightyseven cheeba hawk  
No pork no swine on the rider  
If your chick loose or tighter Ima still get inside her  
Rebel porn star thick like Dick Swellington  
Beat the pussy up leave it soft like gelatin  
  
What the hell is going on here  
Man mman mman man Im not playin I kick the rough shit  
Say what Im not Im not Im not playin  
Direct from the Shaolin slum here I come  
Right now Im teaching school  
There it is youre fuckin with pros and there it goes  
Yo You dont wanna get too close to that mans razor  
You about to get cut up  
  
You know the MO could never be in limbo  
No live have I die fore I cough up info  
Boss shit intro horse dick nympho  
Smooth on the chicks like a ride on dick tempo  
Imprint flow make your bottom bitch unrobe  
Soft pushin insole stroll on tracks  
In the back of the bar when they told on black  
Plaques on plaques got racks on racks  
So no need to ask why he act all that  
King Cognac got a thing for them gats  
An eighties offspring Im a fiend for the facts  
Swing on the map overseas with the Gs  
In South Cackalak tryin to squeeze me some cheese  
Breezed on the Ds when they tailed on the pipe  
Around the same time I exhaled on the mic  
The name AZ rings bells on site  
  
What the hell is going on here  
Man mman mman man Im not playin I kick the rough shit  
I offer you reality  
Direct from the Shaolin slum here I come  
Right now Im teaching school  
There it is youre fuckin with pros and there it goes  
Yo You dont wanna get too close to that mans razor  
You about to get cut up  
  
I take money like a pool shark put the eighth in my right pocket  
Hella cool dude and I wont hesitate to pop it  
Still a rude dude try to replicate my doctrine  
Roll with mad killers my niggas regulate the projects  
Im hard body I keep a young hottie  
You keep it Bon Jovi you wear a thong probably  
Blaow Nigga you fuckin with a sick puppy  
Bville up in this bitch its bout to get ugly  
  
I could tell you Im hood but yall should already know  
My affiliation of Wu contribute to the globe  
Im worlwide with it for sho you better check  
Or get laced up from your face up and left off  
We dont just do it we do it to death yall  
Better respect some shit or well ruin your rep cmon  
The realness that split this kill or be killed shit  
Its still kill or be killed should of never concealed it  
  
What the hell is going on here  
Man mman mman man Im not playin I kick the rough shit  
Say what Im not Im not Im not playin  
Direct from the Shaolin slum here I come  
Right now Im teaching school  
There it is youre fuckin with pros and there it goes  
Yo You dont wanna get too close to that mans razor  
You about to get cut up  
  
Direct from the Shaolin slum here I come
