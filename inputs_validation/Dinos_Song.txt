I dont ever want to see you crying  
And I dont ever want to see you blue  
oh no all I ever wanted to do was know you  
And maybe hope you could know me too  
Well I dont ever want to make you sorry  
For anything youve ever said or done  
Oh no all I ever wanted to do was love you  
And maybe hope you could love me too  
And its all right baby Im in love with you  
And its all right I would never make you blue or try to play with you  
  
Well I dont ever want to spoil your party babe  
Or tell you where to go or what to do  
Oh no all I ever wanted to do was know you  
There may be hope you could know me too  
And its all right baby Im in love with you  
And its all right I would never make you blue or try to play with you  
  
Well I dont ever want to spoil your party babe  
Or tell you where to go or what to do  
Oh no all I ever wanted to do was love you  
There may be hope you could love me too
