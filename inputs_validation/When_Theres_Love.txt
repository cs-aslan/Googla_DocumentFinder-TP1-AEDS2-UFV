Take some time make a friend of a stranger  
Touch a hand just reach out theres no danger  
When theres love mountains move  
The blind can see and things improve  
Dont be afraid to take the lead  
And be the first to plant a seed  
And then just watch it grow dont you know  
  
Take some time tell someone that you love them  
Make them feel theres a rainbow above them  
When theres love storms will cease  
And those in chains will be released  
Theres not a thing that love cant do  
But its got to start with me and you  
And then just watch it grow dont you know  
  
When theres love you cant lose  
Youll always know which road to choose  
Theres not one thing that love cant do  
But its got to start with me and you  
And then just watch it grow dont you know  
  
Take some time make a friend of a stranger  
When theres love touch a hand  
Just reach out theres no danger  
When theres love take some time  
Make a friend of a stranger  
When theres love touch a hand  
Just reach out theres no danger  
When theres love take the time  
Make a friend of a stranger
