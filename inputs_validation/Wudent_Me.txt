Old boy he ran a little stop sign in the south  
And he got in deeper trouble with his mouth  
They wouldnt let him phone or make a bail  
Just let him sit there in that Delford County jail  
It wudnt me it wudnt me  
Im so glad it wudnt me  
No phone no bail no plea  
Oh Im so glad it wudnt me  
He had to break out of that Delford County jail  
They put a Grand Dragon posse on his trail  
And seven Alabama bloodhounds in a line  
Buckin and barkin for a bite of his behind  
It wudnt me it wudnt me  
Im so glad it wudnt me  
Hung posses aint my cup otea  
Oh Im so glad it wudnt me  
He was streakin through the Delta double three  
But them hungry hounds was gaininon his lee  
His feet was playin Louisiana Bound  
Lord you help me pick em up Ill put em down Amen  
It wudnt me it wudnt me  
Im so glad it wudnt me  
Prayin aint no sure guarantee  
Oh Im so glad it wudnt me  
He was streakin through the Delta stridin wide  
But that leadin hound was meters from his hide  
Lord bless my feet dont let em go corrupt  
Ill lay em down as fast as you can pick em up  
It wudnt me it wudnt me  
Im so glad it wudnt me  
Just meters from a canine jubilee  
Oh Im so glad it wudnt me  
He reached a highway through the ticket on the side  
And a trucker came along and let him ride  
But as he settled down to thank him for no harm  
He saw a swastiKKK band on his arm  
Thats when he knew he had to get on help his self  
Stead if sittin pinnin it on somebody else  
He hung a left into that thicket cross the fence  
And aint nobody ever sawed or seen him since  
It wudnt me it wudnt me  
Im so glad it wudnt me  
It aint quite my kinda cup otea  
Jeez Im glad it wudnt me  
It wudnt me it was not me  
Im so glad it wudnt me  
It just aint my kinda cup otea  
Jeez am I glad it wudnt me
