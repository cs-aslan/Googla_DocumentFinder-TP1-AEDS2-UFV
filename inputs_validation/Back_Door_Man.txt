Im every man here in disguise  
Lie cheat and give you a spoonful of lies  
Im a high toned mother with an axe to grind  
Come a little closer honey see what you find  
Your worst nightmares all rolled in one  
Ill find you sure as the rising sun  
Dont make a noise its understood  
Cause this aint no story like red riding hood  
Im your back door man Im your back door man oh yeah  
Im your back door man come on babe  
And Ill take you where I can  
Systematically I choose at will  
But with you theres an obscene thrill  
Its funny now how you cant say no  
Its the smell of fear that you love so  
Im your back door man Im your back door man oh yeah  
Im your back door man baby Just take it where you can  
This first kiss has a touch of ice  
Now hows that feel it aint so nice  
Blackhearted mamma Ive something new  
Oh Lord look what Ive turned into  
  
Im your back door man Im your back door man  
Im your back door man Im your back door man
