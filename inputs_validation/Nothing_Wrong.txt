I wouldve slipped off my jeans  
And slipped on my heels  
If I knew that I would see you  
Yeah this diamond ring gets kinda loose  
Gotta watch myself around you  
Glad you finally said something  
Cause its been weighin on my mind  
And messin with my life  
I wonder should I feel guilty  
But weve havent crossed that line  
  
We aint doin nothin wrong  
Nothin wrong as long as we keep it innocent  
Im just tryin to have some fun  
But baby youre drivin me crazy  
I aint tryin to make you crazy  
For me it aint much that fun  
If we aint doin nothin wrong  
  
If you only knew  
What you do to me  
When you walk away  
If I had chance gave you a taste  
Baby youd be beggin me to stay  
Yeah sometimes I wonder what itd feel like  
But I gotta good man and Im a damn good wife  
And I dont wanna feel guilty  
But its getting awfully hard to believe  
  
Id never ask you  
Would you leave the one you love  
Id never tell you  
I want you so bad it hurts  
I like the way you make me feel  
Baby can we make it real  
If we dont make it real  
Then we aint doin nothin wrong
