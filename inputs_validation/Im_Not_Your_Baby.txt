Its a beautiful day today everything is going my way  
Even the words do what I say oh babe got to get away  
To be impossible isnt that difficult  
In the city youre invisible when you come from a small town  
Everything is all right everything is all right  
Im not your baby please  
A tourist in a traffic jam baby sham and handy cam  
Im not your mother youre not my man Im not your baby  
Dont treat me like Im a trick I wont treat you like youre a prick  
Dont need no doctor Im not ill Im not your baby  
Everything is all right everything is all right  
Im not your baby please  
Cut out the poetry lets hit the main artery  
No time for a tourniquet the colors all run out of me  
You brought me all kinds of goods now my heart is so full up it hurts  
Its heavy as a shopping bag its full of things I should give back  
Everything is all right everything is all right  
Im not your baby please  
Im not your baby  
Im not your baby  
Dont want you to cover me smother me or mother me  
I like to feel this incomplete Im not your baby  
Everything is all right everything is all right  
Im not your baby please  
Not dizzy just busy didnt drink nothing fizzy  
No pills to feel easy dont know what got into me  
Daylights a kind of robbery the night is your geography  
So youre not white youre pink and rosy  
You could be right but youre way above me  
Me Im in recovery a star of pornography  
Im a tourist theres a lot to see  
You dont like the photographs of me  
So youve got a lot to say  
You dont sleep around but sometimes you stray  
You dont believe often times you pray  
For something what is it babe  
Dont treat me like Im a trick I wont treat you like youre a prick  
Dont need no doctor Im not sick Im not your baby  
Everything is all right everything is all right  
Im not your baby please  
Im not your baby Im not your baby Im not your baby  
Im not your baby Im not your baby Im not your baby  
Im not your baby
