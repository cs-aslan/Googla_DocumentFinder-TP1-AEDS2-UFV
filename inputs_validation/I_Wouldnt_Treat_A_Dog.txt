When I was up  
Youd always come around  
When I need a friend  
You could never be found  
I got a hole  
Where my heart used to be  
I wouldnt treat a dog no  
The way you treated me  
  
When time was good love  
All of your lovin was the same  
Oh when the goin got rough  
Boy you hardly knew my name  
You locked me out  
And you threw away the key baby  
I wouldnt treat a dog no no no  
The way you treated me  
  
Got me cryin for the love  
That Im needin  
Beggin like a dog for a bone  
Boy Ive spent most of my time grievin  
You turn you back  
And you leave me one of these old days  
  
Lord knows that its true  
Just when you need me the most  
Ill be walking out on you  
When you say  
As youre beggin down on your knees baby  
I wouldnt treat a dog no no no  
The way you treated me  
  
The way you treated me  
I wouldnt treat a dog no no no  
The way you treated me  
No no I wouldnt do it  
No baby I couldnt do it  
I wouldnt treat a dog no no no  
The way you treated me  
No baby the way you treated me
