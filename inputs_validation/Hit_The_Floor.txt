There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me  
Wondering what I think of you well I protect you out of courtesy  
Too many times that Ive held on when I needed to push away  
Afraid to say what was on my mind  
Afraid to say what I need to say  
Too many things that youve said about me when Im not around  
You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down  
But Ive had too many standoffs with you its about as much as I could stand  
So I wait till the upper hand is mine  
  
One minute youre on top  
The next youre not watch it drop  
Making your heart stop  
Just before you hit the floor  
One minute youre on top  
The next youre not missed your shot  
Making your heart stop  
You think youve won  
And then its all gone  
  
So many people like me that put so much trust in all your lies  
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside  
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long  
All I know is that all I want is to feel like Im not stepped on  
There are so many things you say that make me feel you cross the line  
What goes up will surely fall and I am counting down the time  
Cause Ive had so many standoffs with you its about as much as I could stand  
So I waiting until the upper hand is mine  
  
One minute youre on top  
The next youre not watch it drop  
Making your heart stop  
Just before you hit the floor  
One minute youre on top  
The next youre not missed your shot  
Making your heart stop  
You think youve won  
And then its all gone  
And then its all gone  
And then its all gone  
And then its all gone  
Now its all gone  
I know Ill never trust a single thing you say  
You realize you divide us but you lied anyway  
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all  
But what goes up has got to fall  
  
One minute youre on top  
The next youre not watch it drop  
Making your heart stop  
Just before you hit the floor  
One minute youre on top  
The next youre not missed your shot  
Making your heart stop  
You think youve won  
And then its all gone  
And then its all gone  
And then its all gone  
And then its all gone  
Now its all gone
