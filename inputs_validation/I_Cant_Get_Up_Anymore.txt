I cant get up anymore my heart ticks so slow  
Theres nothing to do Im picking my nose  
Im counting the days that you have been gone  
My heart went to jail my loves out of song  
I cant get up anymore Im lying in bed  
Im watching the day through a hole in my head  
I turned myself down I can hardly be heard  
Now Im without a heart now Im without a girl  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore Im a cold piece of toast  
The doormat is full the newspapers and post  
Theres a letter from you but Im growing a beard  
It will never be read cause Im going so weird  
Look what women can do Ive bolted the door  
Now Im losing a screw  
All this hunger and trial wont achieve a result  
But a nut cant keep tight without the help of a bolt  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I wont get up anymore  
I wont get up anymore  
I wont get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
Wont get up anymore  
I wont get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore  
I wont get up anymore  
I cant get up anymore
