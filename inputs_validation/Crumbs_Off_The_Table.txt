Ooh hoo  
Get up in the morning  
Bout a quarter to nine  
Get home in the evenin  
Too tired to make time  
Give me the lovin  
Ive been waiting for all day  
Youre always a little too tired  
To ever look my way  
  
You got me hungry for your love  
But you you aint able  
All you want to give me  
Is the crumbs off the table  
What you been doin  
Who you been wooin  
Tell me tell me who you been doin  
  
I ache inside  
With a lovin desire  
But youre too tired baby  
To light my fire  
I work in this house all day  
And I get tired too  
There aint a day goes by  
I aint willing to make love to you  
  
Im hungry for your love  
But you you aint able  
All you want to give me  
Is the crumbs off the table ah  
What you been doin  
Who you been wooin  
Tell me tell me tell me who you been doin  
  
Hey sometimes in the middle of the day  
I get lovin you on my mind  
But as soon as you get home  
You read the paper  
Aint got the time  
  
What you been doin  
Who you been wooin  
Tell me tell me who you been doin  
What you been doin  
Who you been wooin  
Tell me tell me tell me who you been doin  
  
I said Im hungry for your lovin  
But you you aint able  
All you want to give me is the crumbs off the table  
Hungry for your love  
But you
