Bonnie RaittTakin My Time  
Bill Payne  
Im takin my time  
So please dont rush me  
Tryin to sort out some things I didnt know existed  
Ive been here before  
I know where the traps lie  
You only take whats there cause the rest doesnt matter  
Well Im tired of talk  
So please dont push me  
You know I want the same kinda things that you do  
Youre wasting your time  
The way you come to me  
Slow down your rhymes and try to reason  
Cant make things move any faster  
By second wishing them to death  
You seem to be living on the level  
Its decent enough  
You got what you wanted  
So why do you tell me that Im on the wrong track  
Im doin the best I can do  
I try to out guess  
The situation  
That I know your not even fully aware of  
And I want you to know  
If it keeps on this way  
Cant keep on letting you bring me down  
Cant keep on letting you bring me down
