Niggas old ladies want to fuck me  
You should see the shit  
Im nothin like them other thugs  
That eat it quick  
Too many niggas in this club  
I need a bitch  
We park right up in the front  
You see the six  
I puff some smoke up out my blunt  
And pop the Crys  
I gotta find me a model  
I like em thick  
I make her hop in my Impala  
Go take a trip  
Clean off my shoe and pop my collar  
Im rich bitch  
Oh what you never seen a balla  
Well this is it

Till you tell me quit  
And I wont tell nobody that you let me hit

Young Buck  
Okay then shawty if you ready  
Then lets go  
Lets take it from the dirty to the East and West Coast  
A couple shots of Patron  
Lets have a sex show  
I got a lot but baby  
You can be my best ho  
I see you watchin a playa  
She like my dress code  
Rockin these Cartiers  
Drinkin that XO  
I know a place that we can go  
And get low  
You wit a gangsta  
You aint never felt like this before  
And if you know that pussy good  
Then hit tha floor  
Shake that ass like you should  
Go get that dough
