We didnt know we didnt know  
Since I dont know when  
Weve been only friends  
No more but no less  
Our friendship we had at best  
  
A voice to console  
An ear to confide  
That someone you tell  
Your deepest of feelings inside  
  
Chorus  
But we didnt know  
When we held each other  
It would feel so right  
We didnt know  
On that night wed be falling in love  
I looked at you  
You looked at me  
In ways we never thought we would be  
But like tomorrows todays mystery  
We didnt know  
  
Be it big be it small  
On you I could call  
Nothing but to ask  
Youd be right there in a flash  
  
A hand I could hold  
That friend I could trust  
But the love that we shared  
Was just platonic between us  
  
Chorus  
  
Thats what happens  
When innocent friends  
Turn serious lovers  
And were so happy that  
Weve fallen in love  
And still can be best of friends  
  
When theyd break your heart  
And when theyd make you cry  
We both would confer  
You should give love one more try  
  
Weve searched everywhere  
For true love to find  
Yet whod think it was us  
That we were longing for all the time  
  
Cause we didnt know  
When we held each other  
It would feel so right  
We didnt know  
On that night wed be falling in love  
I looked at you  
And you looked at me  
In ways we never thought  
We would be  
But just like the future  
No one can see  
We didnt know  
  
Chorus
