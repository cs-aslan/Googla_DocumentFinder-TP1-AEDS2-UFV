I can make the sun shine out of the heavens  
Sweet love love you forever  
Just wait until the suns on your pillow  
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got  
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got  
  
I can change the whole world if you are near me  
No tears if you can hear me  
Just wait until the suns on your pillow  
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got  
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got yeah  
  
Ah  
Just wait until the suns on your pillow  
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got  
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got  
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got
