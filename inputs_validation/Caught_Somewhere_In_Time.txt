If you had the time to lose  
An open mind and time to choose  
Would you care to take a look  
Or can you read me like a book  
  
Time is always on my side  
Time is always on my side  
  
Can I tempt you come with me  
Be Devil may care fulfill your dream  
If I said Id take you there  
Would you go would you be scared  
  
Time is always on my side  
Time is always on my side  
  
Dont be afraid youre safe with me  
Safe as any soul can be honestly  
Just let yourself go  
  
Chorus  
Caught somewhere in time  
Caught somewhere in time  
Caught somewhere in time oh oh  
  
Like a wolf in sheeps clothing  
You try to hide your deepest sins  
Of all the things that youve done wrong  
And I know where you belong  
  
Time is always on my side  
Time is always on my side  
  
Make you an offer you cant refuse  
Youve only got your soul to lose  
Eternally  
Just let yourself go  
  
Caught somewhere in time  
Caught somewhere in time  
Caught now in two minds
