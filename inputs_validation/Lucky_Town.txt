House got too crowded clothes got too tight  
And I dont know just where Im going tonight  
Out where the skys been cleared by a good hard rain  
Theres somebody callin my secret name  
  
Im going down to Lucky Town  
Going down to Lucky Town  
I want to lose these blues Ive found  
Down in Lucky Town  
Down in Lucky Town  
  
Had a coat of fine leather and snakeskin boots  
But that coat always had a tread hangin loose  
Well I pulled it one night and to my surprise  
It led me right past your house and on over the rise  
  
Im going down to Lucky Town  
Down to Lucky Town  
Im gonna lose these blues Ive found  
Down in Lucky Town  
Down in Lucky Town  
  
I had some victory that was just failure in deceit  
Now the jokes comin up through the soles of my feet  
I been a long time walking on fortunes cane  
Tonight Im steppin lightly and feelin no pain  
  
Well heres to your good looks baby now heres to my health  
Heres to the loaded places that we take ourselves  
When it comes to luck you make your own  
Tonight I got dirt on my hands but Im building me a new home  
  
Down in Lucky Town  
Down in Lucky Town  
Im gonna lose these blues Ive found  
Down in Lucky Town
