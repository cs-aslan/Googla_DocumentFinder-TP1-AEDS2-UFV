As clear as wine the wind is flying  
Among the dreamy pines  
As evening light is slowly dying  
And a lonely bell still chimes  
  
So many songs so many stories  
The stony hills recall  
Around her heart my city carries  
A lonely ancient wall  
  
Yerushalaim all of gold  
Yerushalaim bronze and light  
Within my heart I shall treasure  
Your song and sight  
  
Alas the dry wells and fountains  
Forgotten marketday  
The sound of horn from Temples mountain  
No longer calls to pray  
  
The rocky caves at night are haunted  
By sounds of long ago  
When we were going to the Jordan  
By way of Jericho  
  
Yerushalaim all of gold  
Yerushalaim bronze and light  
Within my heart I shall treasure  
Your song and sight  
  
But when I come to count your praises  
And sing Hallel to you  
With pretty rhymes I dare not crown you  
As other poets do  
  
Upon my lips is always burning  
Your name so dear so old  
If I forget Yerushalaim  
Of bronze and light and gold  
  
Yerushalaim all of gold  
Yerushalaim bronze and light  
Within my heart I shall treasure  
Your song and sight  
  
Back to the wells and to the fountains  
Within the ancient walls  
The sound of horn from Temples mountain  
Again so loudly calls  
  
From rocky caves this very morning  
A thousand suns will glow  
And we shall go down to the Jordan  
By way of Jericho  
  
Yerushalaim all of gold  
Yerushalaim bronze and light  
Within my heart I shall treasure  
Your song and sight  
  
In Hebrew  
  
Avir harim zalul kayayin  
Vereiah oranim  
Nissa beruah haarbayim
