You talk about you and only you and the things that you do for you  
You say youre not a lean cuisine  
So I wanna see whatcha got on the menu  
Now if you think youre the man the only man  
With an exterior you feel issuperior Just give Miss be a little peek  
And see if you really can deliver  
Your tendencies are short my expectations are long  
And as I see it now theres not much to go on  
It seems you dug a hole that you cant crawl out  
Now I truly see what youre all about  
Chorus  
Dont brag about the diamond rings  
Or the expensive clothes you wear  
Cause I could care less for what you possess  
And your attitude needs repair  
Dont brag about your body baby  
And say that youre packin a lot  
Cause all I see besides your big feet  
Is that you got big socks  
Lets just say that theres something lacking  
A flea shouldnt have the nerve to be bragging  
So pack up your little gift and get up to steppin  
Return it back and put it in the kiddie section  
Full figured in a place that can deliver  
Ha ha not from what Ive seen  
I cant trace whats below your waist  
Theres too much space to be inside those jeans  
Chorus  
Big socks big socks  
Ive got big socks baby  
Big socks big socks  
Ive got big socks baby  
Big socks big socks  
IIIve got big socks baby  
Big socks big socks  
IIIII  
Bye bye baby bye bye  
Its time to wave the white flag  
Now the kitten has been let out of the bag  
Chorus  
Chorus
