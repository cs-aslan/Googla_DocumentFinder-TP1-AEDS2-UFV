If I could borrow from the future  
And Id spend it with you darling in a very special  
Id treat you to a sundae on a Saturday afternoon  
And wed spend the night together throwing snowballs at the moon  
  
Wed be aiming high and wed be aiming low  
Winding up together lord and lettin them snowballs go  
And after every throw wed share a little kiss  
Make sweet love together every time wed miss  
  
Oh Id like to meet the artist who painted up the sky  
And Id ask him what that color was he brushed against your eyes  
And could he paint a picture of two lovers in one balloon  
Who go flying off together to throw snowballs at the moon  
  
Wed be aiming high wed be aiming low  
Winding up together lord and letting them snowballs go  
And after every throw wed share a little kiss  
Make sweet love together everytime wed miss  
  
If we could stop the world from spinning take it nice and slow I bet that we
could hit once just before we go  
But we keep aiming high we keep aiming low chorus
