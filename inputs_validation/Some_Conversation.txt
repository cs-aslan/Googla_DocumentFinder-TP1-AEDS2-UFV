Im taking off this hat  
And walking to the sun  
Im changing this and that and things  
Im done with everyone  
I slip into the sea  
And turn my back on sand  
And diamonds that may be or not  
Ill play the final hand  
To check it all  
And throw it all away  
But I would always wait for you  
Ill pass my time in sleep  
With dreams that make me weep  
And all I wants an explanation  
The little time I need  
The time you wont concede  
And we require some conversation  
Im checking off this list  
Of things that stay undone  
And running hard when called upon  
Im done with everyone  
I step into the air  
My face against the ground  
Foot prints that may lead or not  
Never let me down  
To check it all  
And throw it all away  
But I would always wait for you  
The final demand  
The colour your smile  
All hidden from view  
That burn me  
Freeze me  
Deceive me  
And you
