Rollerskate skinny and the terrible twos  
How can you have everything and nothing to lose  
You and nobody see eye to eye  
Youre gonna wake up with a ghost instead of a guy  
Bulletin board on the wall of a church  
Soaking up the city from a topstep perch  
Youre gonna break down on a midnight date  
Youre gonna curse this town youre gonna run late  
Youre pretty as a penny  
Rollerskate skinny  
Youre pretty as a penny  
Rollerskate skinny  
Do you want to meet up at the Pickwood Bowl  
We could knock nine down and leave one in the hole  
Wouldnt be here if the Athenia hadnt sunk  
Or if dear ol dad hadnt got so drunk  
Every other day is a kick in the shin  
Every other day its like the day just went  
But you make it alright you make it okay  
You make me sorta glad that I waited till today  
Youre pretty as a penny  
Rollerskate skinny  
Youre pretty as a penny  
Rollerskate skinny  
Rollerskate skinny and the terrible twos  
Two years in and its time to choose  
Love feels good when it sits right down  
Puts its feet up on the table it and sends a bowl around  
Aint nobody gonna see eye to eye  
With a girl whos only gonna stand collarbone high  
Rains gonna come in fairsized drips  
Were gonna go to heaven wearing paperhat ships  
Youre pretty as a penny  
Rollerskate skinny  
Youre pretty as a penny  
Rollerskate skinny  
I believe in love but it dont believe in  
I believe in love but it dont believe in me  
I believe in love but it dont believe in me  
No it dont believe in  
Dont believe in
