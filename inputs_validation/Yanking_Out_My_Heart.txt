Feeling fine  
Lets rip out yours instead of mine  
And all you need

Well thanks for stopping this beating in my chest  
Its easier now and Im happy like this

Honestly  
You youve friends for all your needs  
And stay the course  
No the universe aint yours  
  
Well thanks for stopping this beating in my chest

Yanking out my
