No words are left now to be spoken  
When all my promises are broken  
And all excuses I have used in justifying  
My actions move me so much closer to the fire  
But now I know  
Seems Ive lost my soul  
  
Make me and take me  
Can you find me in this world  
Ive chosen and never let me go  
Hold me and mold me  
And if theres no other way  
To make me whole  
Go ahead and break me  
Then remake me  
Hold it on I wont give up  
Coz I know you wont give up  
On me  
  
Grow weary of my ways pretending  
Showing Im okay when I am hurting  
But now I know  
Time to find my soul  
  
Make me and take me  
Can you find me in this world  
Ive chosen and never let me go  
Hold me and mold me  
And if theres no other way  
To make me whole  
  
Ive been too proud  
And now I dont know where to go  
And like the son who came back home  
Im giving you my life  
My mind my heart my soul  
Im trusting you enough to break me  
Then to make me whole  
  
Can you find me in this world  
Ive lost and never let me go  
Hold me and mold me  
And if theres no other way  
To make me whole  
Go ahead and break break me  
Gently remake me  
Hold it on I wont give up  
Coz I know you wont give up  
Youre never givin up on me  
  
No no no no no  
  
Youre never givin up on one like me
