Poor Otis dead and gone Left me here to sing his song  
Pretty little girl with the red dress on  
Poor Otis dead and gone  
Yeah back down turn around slowly  
Try it again remembering when  
It was easy try it again  
Much to easy rememberin when  
All right look at my shoes Not quite the walkin blues  
Dont fight too much to lose Cant fight the runnin blues  
Well Ive got the runnin blues  
Runnin away back to LA  
Got to find the dock of the bay  
Maybe find it back in LA  
Runnin scared runnin blue  
Goin so fast whatll I do  
Well Ive got the runnin blues  
Runnin away back to LA  
Got to find the dock of the bay  
Maybe find it back in LA  
All right look at my shoes  
Not quite the walkin blues  
Dont fight too much to lose  
Cant fight the runnin blues  
All right look at my shoes  
Not quite the walkin blues  
Dont fight too much to lose  
Cant fight the runnin blues
