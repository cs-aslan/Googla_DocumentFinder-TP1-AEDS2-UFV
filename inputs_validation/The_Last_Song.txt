Everybodys asking me lately where Im from  
They wanna know what Ive been through and what dirt Ive done  
But man if I told you what Ive seen and been through then you probably run
off  
If your scared of the truth so instead in secret lined in chalk  
See Ive been lost ever since I could walk  
Looking for my daddy and anyone of mammas boyfriends who would talk  
Or listen to me when I spoke instead of looking at me like a joke  
Leaving me behind leaving me to cry when you treated my momma like a ho  
But I learned quick that my daddy wasnt ever gonna come around  
And I didnt give a shit cause me and my momma we held it down  
No new kicks first day of school Im goodwill bound  
But when you come from the trench thats how you learn to walk around  
So I dont give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes homey  
I just wanted you to know I didnt need a dollar from you I got em myself  
So if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with the bottle drinking
yourself lonely  
Then you can keep company with the picture of me in the magazine on the shelf
turn the page  
  
Chorus  
Daddy can you see me Im putting on a show  
In the magazines hear me on the radio  
So what do you think huh  
Well I hope that your proud now to watch it all go down  
Im sorry daddy you didnt get to watch me grow  
Now Im always on the road no time to say hello  
Bye and I hope that your proud now to watch it all go down  
  
Yeah mamma you look great perfect  
Be safe on your first date for certain  
If he brings you home too late Ill hurt him  
Dont worry bout me Im safe Ill close the curtains  
And I feel like Im raising you but what do I know baby blue  
All I know is that I was made in you so I put all my faith in you  
Yeah I was only ten but I felt like a man and I had to let you go  
All I wanted was for us to be rich tear drops in my cereal bowl  
So I turned into an asshole young and dumb smoking weed  
Vandalizing robbing houses stealing cars that was me  
But everything I did I had to see  
Feel the pain had to grieve  
To become who I am and Im proud of the man I came to be  
What Ive learned cannot be taught  
What Ive earned cannot be bought  
Justified deserve it all  
So dont be concerned its not your fault  
I never counted sheep I count my blessings  
So if you see him now momma dont give him the cold shoulder just give him my
message just tell him  
  
Chorus
