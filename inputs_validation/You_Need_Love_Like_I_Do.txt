When mama told me dont fall in love with the first girl that comes your way  
She was pretty and nice and I took her fast and passed her by  
Years have passed and moved like loves gonna give me a second try  
More than loved than you first tells me you understand  
Could it be your love life like mine I need a girlfriends hand  
Well you need love like I do dont you

But I cant cope with this loneliness not one more damned on day  
Everyday bringing up your clown to keeping my hopes of love  
Judging from your silence boy you must be in the same boat
