When you walk in a room  
You hold your head up high  
You talk to people eye to eye  
Theres nothing to hide  
Youre feeling  
So complete inside  
Your heart feels  
So complete inside  
Cause you got love  
  
If you got love  
You know you got it  
If you got love  
Cant live without it  
If you got love  
The world youre walking in  
Is at your command  
  
Youre staring  
In the face of scorn  
You know your spirit  
Cant be torn  
Youre living like a satellite  
Maintain your distance  
Through the night  
You know that  
Something isnt right  
Your heart tells you  
Its just not right  
Cause you got love  
  
If you got love  
You know you got it  
If you got love  
Cant live without it  
If you got love  
The world youre walking in  
Is at your command  
  
If you got love  
The world youre walking in  
Is at your command  
If you got love  
To share  
If you got love  
To share
