Places I have been  
Cities I have seen  
With concrete caverns rising from the ground  
Miles and miles of asphalt trail  
Stretch across a land  
Stampeding metal ponies leaving smoke along the way  
Im going back to paniolo county  
Stars at night  
No city lights  
Paniolo country my home on the range  
I made up my mind wont waste any time  
Im going back to where the clouds ride high  
Take my word its pretty not like the great big city  
The winds still bring cool clear mountian air  
Im going back to paniolo country  
Rain drops fall the grass grows tall  
Paniolo county my home on the range
