Lordy Lord at home Lord at home Looord at home  
You know I get home every day Lord  
There aint nobody waiting there man  
And I aint got no girlfriends and I aint got no boyfriends man  
I aint got no any kind of friends man I aint got no  
My tv set doesnt work my radio doesnt work man

Nothing man theres no animals moving
