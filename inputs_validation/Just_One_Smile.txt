Cant I cry a little bit  
Theres nobody to notice it  
Cant I cry if I want to  
Noone cares  
  
Why cant I pretend  
That youll love me again  
All I had has been taken from me  
Now I cry tears that never become me  
  
Just one smile means forgiving  
Just one kiss the hurts all gone  
Just one smile to make my life worth living  
A little dream to build my world upon  
  
How I wish I could say  
All the things I want to say  
If some way you could see whats in my heart  
Oh baby  
  
I dont ask for much  
A look a smile a touch  
Try to forget  
Lord knows Im trying  
Its so hard to forget  
When your whole world you know is dying  
  
Just one smile means forgiving  
Just one kiss the hurts all gone  
Just one smile to make my life worth living  
A little dream to build my world upon  
  
Just one smile please forgiving  
Just one kiss hurts all gone  
Just one smile to make my life worth living  
A little dream to build my world upon  
Just one smile
