Tell me youve had trouble sleeping  
That you toss and turn from side to side  
That its my face youve been seeing  
In your dreams at night  
  
Tell me that you wake up crying  
And youre not sure exactly why  
Tell me that something is missing  
In your life in your life baby  
  
Tell me that you live for love  
That forever is never enough  
That youve waited all your life to see  
That you want so badly to believe  
Tell me that its not just me  
  
I could have sworn I saw you smile at me  
Standing in the pouring rain  
At a loss for words and running out of time  
I said this crazy ting crazy thing I said  
  
Tell me that you live for love  
That forever is never enough  
That youve waited all your life to see  
That you want so badly to believe  
Tell me that its not just me  
  
Hold me now and tell me that you do believe  
In a soul a soul mate  
And tell me and tell me tell me  
  
Tell me that you live for love  
That forever is never enough  
That youve waited all your life to see  
That you want so badly to believe  
Tell me that its not just me
