Theres your coat upon my back  
Theres the irony I lacked  
Theres the vapor from your mouth  
Theres the rain spreading from the south  
  
Theres the castle on the hill  
Theres my final act of will  
Theres a bus stop in Tollcross  
Theres no memory Ive lost  
Memories never lost  
  
Theres you lying on the quilt  
Theres your west of Scotland lilt  
Singing me your guilt  
  
Theres your voice on the phone  
Theres your voice on the phone  
Theres your voice on the phone  
Theres your voice on the phone  
Theres your voice on the phone  
Theres your voice on the phone  
  
Theres the snow in January  
Theres the beauty that you see  
Theres you walking down the street  
Children running round your feet  
Theres you and theres me
