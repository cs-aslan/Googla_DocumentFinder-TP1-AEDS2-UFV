Midnight suns bid moors farewell retreats from charging dusk  
Mountain echo curfews bell signal ending tasks  
They place their faith in oaken doors cower in candlelight  
The panic seeps through bloodstained floors as Grendel stalks the night  
  
Earth rim walker seeks his meals  
Prepare the funeral pyres  
The shapers songs no longer heal the fear  
Within their eyes their eyes  
  
Wooden figures pagan gods stare blindly cross the sea  
Appeal for help from ocean fogs for saviour born of dreams  
They know their lives are forfeit now priestly head they bow in shame  
They cannot face the trembling crowd that flinch in Grendels name  
  
Earth rim walker seeks his meals  
Prepare the funeral pyres  
The shapers songs no longer heal the fear  
Within their eyes their eyes  
  
As Grendel leaves his mossy home beneath the stagnant mere  
Along the forest path he roams to Hrothgars hall so clear  
He knows that victory is secured his charm will testify  
His claws will drip with mortal blood as moonbeams haunt the sky  
  
Earth rim walker seeks his meals  
Prepare the funeral pyres  
The shapers songs no longer heal the fear  
Within their eyes their eyes  
  
Silken membranes span his path fingerprints in dew  
Denizens of twilight lands humbly beg him through  
Mother natures bastard child shunned by leaf and stream  
An alien in an alien land seeks solace within dreams  
The shapers lies his poisoned tongue malign with mocking harp  
Beguiling queen her innocence offends his icy heart  
  
Hounds freeze in silence bewitched by the reptile spell  
Sulphurous essence pervades round the grassy dell  
Heorot awaits him like lamb to the butchers knife  
Stellular heavens ignore even childrens cries  
  
Screams are his music lightning his guide  
Raping the darkness death by his side  
  
Chants rise in terror free round the oaken beams  
Flickering firelight portraying the grisly scene  
Warriors advance prepare for the nightmare foe  
Futile their sacrifice as even their hearts must know  
  
Heroes delusion with feet in the grave  
Lurker at the threshold he cares not for the brave he cares not for the
brave  
  
So you thought that your bolts and your locks would keep me out  
You should have known better after all this time  
Youre gonna pay in blood for all your vicious slander  
With your ugly pale skins and your putrid blue eyes  
Why should I feel pity when you kill your own and feel no shame  
Gods on my side sure as hell Im gonna take no blame  
Im gonna take no blame Im gonna take no blame  
  
So you say you believe in all of Mother Natures laws  
You lust for gold with your sharpened knives  
Oh when your hoards are gathered and your enemies left to rot  
You pray with your bloodstained hands at the feet of your pagan gods  
  
Then you try to place the killers blade in my hand  
You call for justice and distort the truth  
Well Ive had enough of all your pretty pretty speeches  
Receive your punishment Expose your throats to my righteous claws  
And let the blood flow and let the blood flow flow flow flow
