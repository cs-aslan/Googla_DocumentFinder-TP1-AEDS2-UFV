Big Boi  
Well it is I the pimp playing nigga that you heard about  
Yeah I got the money and a half a million dope houses  
I got the hookers on the go and player rhymes that I fuck with  
I buy amps that pops my trunk swift  
Ive been a player since the age of two  
Thats when I learned to walk grab my crotch talk  
Do how them hoe sellers do  
See born and raised as a pimp thats what I claim to be  
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see  
I pledge allegiance to the streets thats where I growed up  
And make my money cause my daddy never showed up  
But fuck it Im on my own Im in my zone  
And nothing wrong you dont belong you left me standing alone  
Yeah Im the nigga with the feather in my hat  
Finger waves and snake skins shit I got all that  
But you aint know Im the one dipping and dodging bullets  
The price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it  
So Dolemite Dolemite not shit I studied the Mack and Rudy Ray Moore  
They were my idols when I was a kid  
From nappy head greasy face eating watermelon  
To drug dealer armed robber now to big felon  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes  
I put in work and did the dirt thats how I payed my dues  
Uh 123 thats how it be  
So all the real niggas step up like the players thats in back of me  
  
Dre  
All heavenly Father why do you even bother watching over me  
Growin up a little G my mama thought Id grow to be  
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder  
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten  
This aint no secret garden so you fly when niggas flee  
If it is one of my own Im letting the trigger be  
cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me  
And then I get a slap of dap when Im slanging quarter keys  
Just trying to make it then of age come through take it  
I aint forgot about yall women who be working niggas butt naked  
At Magic City shaking titties just to pay the rent  
Lord trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent  
But I aint got no sense thats what I got them thinking  
I think about payback strap myself and keep on dankin  
cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain  
If you cross my path Ill leave you draining like a fountain  
Yes its been like that since way back in 1975  
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive  
So little botty bwoy better say your prayers  
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya  
  
Chorus x4
