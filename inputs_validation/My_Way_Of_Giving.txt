Ive been told its just a matter of time  
before you meet someone who opens your eyes  
But times on my side so nevertheless  
I know the pain of too much happiness  
  
Chorus  
Its all part of my way of giving  
and Im giving it all to you  
More than love its a way of living  
and what more would you have me do  
  
Although Im not a guy that means to hurt  
and if at times it seems our love wont work  
I tell you honey you must surely realize  
See all confusion in my cloudy eyes  
  
Chorus  
  
Although Im not a guy that means to hurt  
and if at times it seems our love wont work  
I tell you honey you must surely realize  
See all confusion in my cloudy eyes  
  
Chorus
