Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel  
he looks out a window without glass  
The walls are made of cardboard newspapers on his feet  
his father beats him cause hes too tired to beg  
  
Hes got 9 brothers and sisters  
theyre brought up on their knees  
its hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs  
Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man  
but thats a slim chance hes going to the boulevard  
  
Hes going to end up on the dirty boulevard  
hes going out to the dirty boulevard  
Hes going down to the dirty boulevard  
  
This room cost 2000 dollars a month  
you can believe it man its true  
somewhere a landlords laughing till he wets his pants  
No one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything  
they dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard  
  
Give me your hungry your tired your poor Ill piss on em  
thats what the Statue of Bigotry says  
Your poor huddled masses lets club em to death  
and get it over with and just dump em on the boulevard  
  
Get to end up on the dirty boulevard  
going out to the dirty boulevard  
Hes going down on the dirty boulevard  
going out  
  
Outside its a bright night  
theres an opera at Lincoln Center  
movie stars arrive by limousine  
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan  
but the lights are out on the Mean Streets  
  
A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel  
hes selling plastic roses for a buck  
The traffics backed up to 39th street  
the TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck  
  
And back at the Wilshire Pedro sits there dreaming  
hes found a book on magic in a garbage can  
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling  
At the count of 3 he says I hope I can disappear  
  
And fly fly away from this dirty boulevard  
I want to fly from dirty boulevard  
I want to fly from dirty boulevard  
I want to flyflyflyfly from dirty boulevard  
  
I want to fly away  
I want to fly  
Fly fly away  
I want to fly  
Flyfly away Fly a  
flyflyfly way ooohhh  
Flyfly away I want to flyfly away
