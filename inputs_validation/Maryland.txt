Ive been thinking  
Ive been thinking Ive been thinking too much  
I just want to live now for a little while  
And cast my dreams to the wind  
  
Dont want to wonder  
Dont want to wonder what its all about  
Im just working for a living singing with my friends  
As I cast my dreams to the wind  
  
Maryland Im coming home  
Never worry about what I did wrong  
And that Ill never be what my daddy wanted me to be  
And Ill never see what my mamas dreams were  
  
But I will sing  
La la la la la la la la  
I want to fly  
I want to fly down the highway to my home away from home  
  
This funky funky club on Fairfax Avenue to see you  
Ill never give up  
Because what is there to give up anyway  
Im just working for a living working for my pay  
  
In Maryland its raining somewhere in some cafe  
Maryland Im coming home  
Never worry about what I did wrong  
And that Ill never be what my daddy wanted me to be  
  
And Ill never see what my mamas dreams were  
But I can sing  
La la la la la la la la
