Close the door  
Shut the world away  
All the fights gone from this wounded heart  
Across the floor  
Dreams and shadows play  
Call call the man  
Who deals in love beyond repair  
He can heal the world  
Oh hearts in need of care  
Shine shine a light ahead  
When the next step is unclear  
Call the man  
Hes needed here  
I close my eyes  
I remember when  
Your sweet love filled this empty room  
The tears I cry  
Wont bring it back again  
Unless the lonely star should fall  
Needed in the chaos and confusion  
From the plains to City Hall  
Needed where the proud who walk the wire are set to fall  
Woah call the man  
Who deals in once upon a time  
Maybe he  
Can mend this broken heart of mine  
Shine a light ahead  
Now the future isnt clear  
Isnt clear  
Call the man  
Hes needed here  
Call the man  
Hes needed here  
Oh yeah  
Ah mmm  
Hes needed here  
Right here  
Hes needed here right now yeah
