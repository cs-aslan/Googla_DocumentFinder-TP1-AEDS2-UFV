Hey you should know by now  
Im gonna take you down  
Cant keep me out forever  
Cause now Im back around  
Put your best defense  
Ive made up my mind  
I aint like the others  
Im gonna make you mine  
Im gonna keep on knockin  
Knockin like before  
Til my heart beats down your door  
Im gonna keep on comin  
Comin back for more  
Til my heart  
Til my heart beats down your door  
Baby you know you love me  
So why do you pretend  
When I could make you happy  
If you just let me in  
Well I remember better days  
With you by my side  
Ill keep you warm forever  
And if it takes all night
