Oh runa oh runa oh runaways  
Please come home  
Oh runa oh runa oh runaways  
Please come home  
  
Daddy hit you in a temper  
But hes sorry now  
Please come home  
Just a quarrel had with mummy  
Just a family row  
Please come home  
  
You caught mum chasing dad with a knife  
Dont cry dont cry  
You ran away to escape from the fights  
Dont cry dont cry  
Now youre lost in a maze of neon light  
And shes worried  
Hes worried  
Shes worried oh  
  
Oh runa oh runa oh runaways  
Please come home  
Oh runa oh runa oh runaways  
Please come home  
  
Pacing streetlamps on the highway  
Haystack for your bed  
Please come home  
In the morning we will find you  
In papers to be read  
Please come home  
  
You heard screams from  
The warmth of your bed  
Dont cry dont cry  
You slumbered on without being fed  
Dont cry dont cry  
Now theres no more tears to be shed  
And shes sorry  
Hes sorry  
Hes sorry oh  
  
Oh runa oh runa oh runaways  
Please come home  
Oh runa oh runa oh runaways  
Please come home
