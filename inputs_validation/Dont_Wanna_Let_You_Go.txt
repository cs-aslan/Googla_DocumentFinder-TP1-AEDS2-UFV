Everybody wants to have a girl like you  
But Im the one and its right  
Somebody comes along and says they play your song  
My wish becomes his delight  
Hell try to take you from me  
  
Dont wanna let you go  
Not gonna get far from me  
Dont wanna let you go  
Your special your one of a kind so  
Dont wanna let you go  
Some things money cant buy  
  
Your smiles pasted  
My time is wasted  
You say I told you so told you so  
You cant tell lies from facts  
Hell try to hold you back  
You make the tension grow grow and grow  
Hell try to take you from me  
  
Dont wanna let you go  
Your not gonna get far from me  
Dont wanna let you go  
Your special your one of a kind so  
Dont wanna let you go  
Some things money cant buy  
  
Dont wanna let you go  
  
Dont wanna let you go  
  
Everybody wants to have a girl like you  
But Im the one and its right  
And somebody comes along and says he plays your song  
My wish becomes his delight  
Hell try to take you from me  
  
Dont wanna let you go  
Your not gonna get far from me  
Dont wanna let you go  
Your special your one of a kind so  
Dont wanna let you go  
Some things money cant buy  
  
Dont wanna let you go  
Your special your one of a kind so  
Dont wanna let you go  
Some things money cant buy  
  
Dont wanna let you go  
Dont wanna let you go  
Dont wanna let you go  
Hell try to take you away from me  
Dont wanna let you go let you go oh no no no yeah
