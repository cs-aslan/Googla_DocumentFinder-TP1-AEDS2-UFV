Wake up and dream about  
The plans you have in store for you  
But keep in mind  
Its not just what you do  
But what you do it forand who  
There are roads to discover  
There are stories yet to be told  
As you see the big picture  
Just beginning to unfold so  
  
Chorus  
Break down the barriers but  
Dont bend the rules  
Never forget your roots  
As you head for something new  
Ride through the shades of desire  
Letting the light be seen  
And hell steer the heart in the  
Pursuit of the dream  
  
Its alright to find yourself  
Thinking now and then  
About the way you want your life to be  
Anticipating what lies  
Just around the bend  
Cant wait to see  
  
Comes the time of decision  
Some you dodge and some you should face  
As you see the big picture  
There will be some dues to pay so  
  
Chorus  
  
Wake up and dream about  
The plans you have in store for you  
But keep in mind  
Its not just what you do  
But what you do it forand who  
  
There are choices that build you  
Choices that will make you fall  
All part of the big picture  
One day you will see it all  
  
Chorus
