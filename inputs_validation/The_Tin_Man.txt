A fat man who was chubby that really ate too much  
How I could that I eat again  
Then I didnt want to die from my heart attack  
And this weightiness hunger can exercise again  
  
Its time for me  
I thought I was the thin man  
You should weigh some more of this  
And Ill never eat again  
Ill be overweight got to be the thin man  
And I shouldve pumped more blood and I couldnt eat more food  
  
I couldnt have some chocolate pudding  
You ate some of this again  
Even now I rode an exercise bike  
But I know I dont be gaining  
Cause as Im jogging my body  
The fat is gone that I never eat again  
  
Its time for me  
I thought I was the thin man  
You should weigh some more of this  
And Ill never eat again  
Ill be overweight got to be the thin man  
And I shouldve pumped more blood and I couldnt eat more food  
  
Refrain  
Yes Ill be overweight got to be the thin man  
And I shouldve pumped more blood and I couldnt eat more food
