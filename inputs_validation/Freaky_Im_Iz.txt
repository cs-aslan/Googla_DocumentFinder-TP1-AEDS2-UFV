Get fresh baby this is your song  
Put your good shoes and your lipstick on  
Get fresh baby this is your song  
You said you want a freak Imma give you what you want  
  
Whole lot of sex whole lot of liquor  
Whole lot of chicks not a lot of niggas  
Not my party all about the bitches  
Sexy model ass like alicias  
See my main chick she got that good shit  
And her gang vicious so I call her sid  
Girl you better be careful  
Bragging on a dick now your friends want a sample  
Fuck a 69 its 696  
I be the 9 both yall the 6  
You go both ways get a load of this  
Beat it so hard now she gotta take a piss  
Then you cant even walk in the morning  
Go to work yawning  
Man your girlfriends on it  
Aint no fun if you aint sharing with the homies

Ass in the air fucking up your weave  
Pulling on your hair baby let me hear you scream

Throw you on your side Im working out the kinks  
You sweating out the sheets girl you fucking with a freak  
She told you Im a beast well she aint never lie
