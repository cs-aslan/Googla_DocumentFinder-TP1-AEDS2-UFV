Shes lost shes late  
Shes zooming on a couch somewhere  
Or high or home  
Im not supposed to call her there  
  
I wait I smoke  
I stare into my coke  
Its happening again  
I tell myself that its over and done amen  
  
Her skin like milk  
Its like shes never seen the sun  
Some hearts to crunch  
Is more like her idea of fun  
  
I know shes ill  
Im cruising for a spill  
Im hanging just the same  
I need to be in the heat  
Of her cold white flame  
  
Chorus  
Another negative girl  
At the edge of the frame  
Deliciously toxic  
The original classic thing more of the same  
  
Shes in the zone  
Crying on the phone  
I need you here  
Im on the street again  
  
Staggering out into the burn of the brain dead dawn  
To arrive in time to find her gone  
  
Shes on the train  
To somewhere up by Fordham Road  
Her reptile brain  
Locked down and ready in combat mode  
  
Some cash a key  
This guy she has to see  
A doctor friend uptown  
And maybe she gets to me when she comes back down  
  
Chorus  
  
A goof a buzz  
If that is what it was  
Then how do you explain  
The way she looks when shes  
Dragging me out to dance with her  
In the summer rain  
  
Chorus
