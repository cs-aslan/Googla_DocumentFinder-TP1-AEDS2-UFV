Where the toys are  
Thats where dad will be  
Without a clue or what to do  
He still insists on building stuff for me  
Where the toys are  
Who knows what Ill see  
A wobbly bite a flightless kite  
To games that still need batteries  
In a box with a million pieces  
Are instructions he wont read  
And he never lets me help him  
No matter how I plead  
Till Im older Ill wait so nervously  
Where the toys are  
Where the toys are  
Where the toys are  
Thats where dad will be  
In a box with a million pieces  
Are instructions he wont read  
And he never lets me help him  
No matter how I plead  
Till Im older Ill wait so nervously  
Where the toys are  
Where the toys are  
Where the toys are  
Thats where dad will be  
Thats where dad will be  
Thats where dad will be  
Oh no thats where dad will be  
I know hes trying  
Thats where dad will be  
Doesnt look good  
Thats where dad will be  
Oh no oh no oh no
