Youve stolen my world from under me my cheating end deceving me  
And now youve gone and set me free its in my book of memories  
Inside the book of pages black with photographs that take me back  
I hide the dreams that used to be here in my book of memories  
The photograph that shows a bride and a man with joy he could not hide  
And one of a boy on his daddys knee its in my book of memories  
Inside the book of pages black
