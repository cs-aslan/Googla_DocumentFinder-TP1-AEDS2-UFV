Who scared you Why were you born my babe  
In twotimes arms with all of your charms my love  
Why were you born Just to play with me  
To freak out or to be beautiful my dear  
Load your head blow it up feeling good baby  
Load your head blow it up feeling good baby ahh  
Well my room is so cold you know you dont have to go my babe  
And if you warm it up right Im gonna love you tonight my love  
Well Im glad that we came I hope youre feeling the same  
Who scared you and why were you born Please stay  
I see your rider coming down the road  
Got a burden carrying a heavy load  
One sack of silver and one bag of gold
