Oh theres nothin like a woman  
When youre all alone  
No theres nothin like a woman  
To make a man come home  
Shes always there to understand  
The little boy inside of the man  
Oh theres nothin like a woman  
Nothin at all  
  
She knows when to hold you  
And when to leave you alone  
Shes there to console you  
When everything in the worlds gone wrong  
She lights a candle  
And gets that look in her eye  
And shes says boy you can handle  
Staying up with me all night  
  
Oh theres nothin like a woman  
When youre all alone No theres nothin like her lovin  
To make a man come home  
Shes always there to understand  
The little boy inside of the man  
No theres nothin like a woman  
Nothin at all  
  
No theres nothin like a woman  
When youre all alone  
No theres nothin like a woman  
To make a man come home  
Shes always there to understand  
The little boy inside of the man  
No theres nothin like a woman  
Nothin at all
