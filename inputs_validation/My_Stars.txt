My stars  
So far  
No ones callin me home  
Space brain  
Vagabond  
Living on my own  
  
Come on you faithful  
You know all you people should come to me  
Ill make you arms work  
And Ill make your legs work  
Ill make you see  
Ladada dadada dadada dadada da da  
Whoa yeah  
  
Well I swear by the air  
Ill be made to breathe  
Youll pay very dear for this banishing deed  
The power alone stored in my little hand  
Could melt the Eiffel Tower  
Turn the Sphinx into sand  
  
Oh no  
Thar she blows  
Spreadin crazy news  
All night  
Cannonball  
Loves to light the fuse  
  
And everyone blows up  
And nobody grows up to fill Dads shoes  
But that doesnt matter  
cause no little boys really wanted to  
  
Ladada dadada dadada dadada da da  
Whoa yeah  
  
I stared at the squall line  
I stared at the fault line  
I see a funnel black there  
I think I see a crack there  
Landscapes alive  
And its moving my feet  
All I needs a Holocaust  
To make my day complete
