Oh I cant give you more  
Than my lonely heart  
Oh take me as I am  
But dont break apart  
I want to hold you baby  
I wont let you go  
And everyday and every night  
Oh I miss you so  
  
Oh when the night comes falling  
Falling from the sky  
I hear my heart is calling  
For another try  
I want to hold you baby I wont let you go  
And everyday and every night oh i miss you so  
  
Chorus   
Im gonna be strong  
I know my baby we cant go wrong  
Im qonna be strong my baby  
Im gonna be strong for you baby  
Im qonna hold on to you darling  
Im gonna be strong for you baby  
Im gonna hold on to my love  
  
This night is gone forever  
Till the end of time  
Why cant we stay together  
Youre always on my mind  
I want to stay with you love I cant let you go  
And anytime and anywhere oh I miss you so  
  
Chorus
