What if all you understand  
Could fit into the center of our hand  
Then you found it wasnt you  
Who held the sum of everything you knew  
  
Were insane but not alone  
You hold on  
And their gone  
  
Like the sun we will live to rise  
Like the sun we will live and die  
And then ignite again  
Like the sun we will live to rise Oh yeah  
What if the one thing that I missed  
Was everything I need to pass the test  
And if I fail what happens then  
Can I still count on you as a friend  
  
Were insane but not alone  
You hold on  
And their gone  
  
Like the sun we will live to rise  
Like the sun we will live and die  
And then ignite again  
Like the sun we will live to rise  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah  
  
Like the sun we will live to rise  
Like the sun we will live and die  
And then ignite again  
  
Like the sun we will live to rise  
Like the sun we will live and die  
And then ignite again  
Like the sun we will live to rise  
Oh yeah oh yeah
