By a fountain back in Rome I fell in love with you  
In a small cafe in Athens You said you loved me too  
And it was April in Paris when I first held you close to me  
Rome Georgia Athens Texas And Paris Tennessee  
  
No were not the jet set  
Were the old Chevrolet set  
Theres no Riviera  
In Festus Missouri  
  
And you wont find Onassis  
In Mullinville Kansas  
No were not the jet set  
Were the old Chevrolet set  
But aint we got love  
  
No Were not the jet set  
Were the old Chevrolet set  
Our steak and martinis  
Is draft beer with weenies  
Our Bach and Tchaikovsky  
Is Haggard and Husky  
No were not the jet set  
Were the old Chevrolet set  
But aint we got love  
  
No Were not the jet set  
Were the old Chevrolet set  
The Prine and DeMent set  
Aint the flaming suzette set  
Our Bach and Tchaikovsky  
Is Haggard and Husky  
Were the old Chevrolet set  
But aint we got love
