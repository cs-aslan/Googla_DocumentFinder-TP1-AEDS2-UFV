Dont You Hear Jerusalem Moan  
Dont you hear Jerusalem moan  
Dont never let a chicken get big enough to crow  
Dont you hear Jerusalem moan  
Dont you hear Jerusalem moan  
Dont you hear Jerusalem moan  
Thank God theres a heaven and a ringing in my soul and my souls got free  
Dont you hear Jerusalem moan  
Well a hardshell preacher you can tell him how he do  
Well he chews his own tobacco and he drinks his own brew  
Well a Baptist preacher you can tell him by his coat  
Has a bottle in his pocket that he cant hardly tote  
Well a Cambellite preacher his soul is saved  
Well he has to be baptized every other day  
Well the Holy Roller preacher he sure is a sight  
Well he gets em all arolling and he kicks out the light  
Well the Presbyterian preacher he lives in town  
His necks so stiff he cant hardly look around
