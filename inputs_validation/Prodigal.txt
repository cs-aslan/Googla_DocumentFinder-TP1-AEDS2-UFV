We say goodbye I turn my back  
Run away run away so predictable  
Not far from here you see me crack  
Like a bone like a bone Im so breakable  
  
Ill take everything from you  
But youll take anything wont you  
  
Run away run away like a prodigal  
Dont you wait for me dont you wait for me  
So ashamed so ashamed but I need you so  
And you wait for me and you wait for me  
  
Im on the road to who knows where  
Look ahead not behind I keep saying  
Theres no place to go where youre not there  
On your rope I hold tight but its freeing  
  
Ill take everything from you  
But youll take anything wont you  
  
Run away run away like a prodigal  
Dont you wait for me dont you wait for me  
So ashamed so ashamed but I need you so  
And you wait for me and you wait for me  
  
Everybody wants to be right  
But only if its not a day light  
I keep trying to find my way back  
My way back  
  
Run away run away like a prodigal  
Dont you wait for me dont you wait for me  
So ashamed so ashamed but I need you so  
And you wait for me and you wait for me  
  
Runaway runaway runaway  
From you from you from you
