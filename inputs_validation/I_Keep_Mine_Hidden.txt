Hate love and war  
Force emotions to the fore  
But not for me of course  
Of course  
I keep mine hidden  
Oh  
  
I keep mine hidden  
But its so easy for you  
Because you let yours flail  
Into public view  
Oh oh  
  
Yellow and green  
A stumbling block  
Im a twentydigit combination to unlock  
With a past where to be touched  
Meant to be mental  
  
Ooh I keep mine hidden  
The lies are so easy for you  
Because you let yours slide  
Into public view  
Oh  
  
Use your loaf
