Listen my son  
One thing Ive learned  
And I know it  
Bombers can open bomb bays  
  
Love all you can  
This precious thing  
Called your own life  
Remember bombers can open bomb bays  
  
Might you meet somebody  
That has your mothers eyes and smile  
Might you meet them  
Dont blow them away  
Dont hurt them  
Just hold me  
Make someone happy  
  
The things you do  
Its up to you  
Try being happy  
And I say I can believe it  
And I do  
I do believe theres hope for you  
  
Bridge  
You theres hope for you 2x  
  
Solo  
  
Listen my son  
Im in a war and I know it  
Remember bombers can open bomb bays  
  
Complimentary worship  
May close your many open doors  
Might you be cool  
Dont get blown away  
Dont hurt you  
Just hold you  
And make you happy  
  
The things you do  
Its up to you  
Try being happy  
And I say I can believe it  
And I do  
I do believe theres hope for you
