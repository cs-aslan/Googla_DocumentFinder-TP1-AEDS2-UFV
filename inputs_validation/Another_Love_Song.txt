Youre so impossible  
Scream and moan it chills my soul  
Dont want to hear you got left behind  
All those times you stayed up and cried  
Its no lie  
You did it to yourself  
Like chewed up gum under my shelf  
Dont look surprised  
You must have know all along  
  
Its just another love song  
Another love song  
  
Its never easy  
Its not hard  
When youve lost your mind  
With you its sleezy  
Dont tell me your worries  
Im sick Ill leave you blind  
Now the time has come  
To leave this love thats left you dry  
No need to work this out now  
Cause you know theres no reason why  
  
Its just another love song  
Another love song  
  
I never told you it would last forever  
You cant hold this boy for long dig it  
By the time you read my letter  
Baby Ill be gone  
  
Youre just another love song  
Another love song
