Well I saw the thing coming out of the sky  
It had one long horn and one big eye  
I commenced to shakin and I said oohwee  
It looks like a purple people eater to me  
  
It was a oneeyed onehorned flyin purple people eater  
Oneeyed onehorned flyin purple people eater  
Oneeyed onehorned flyin purple people eater  
Sure looks strange to me One eye  
  
Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree  
I said Mr Purple People Eater dont eat me  
I heard him say in a voice so gruff  
  
  
Well bless my soul rock n roll flyin purple people eater  
Pigeontoed undergrowed flyin purple people eater  
We wear shortshorts  
Friendly little people eater  
What a sight to see Oooh  
  
And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground  
And he started to rock really rockin around  
It was a crazy ditty with a swingin tune  
Singin bop boop aboopa lopa lum bam boom  
  
Well bless my soul rock n roll flyin purple people eater  
Pigeontoed undergrowed flyin purple people eater  
  
Flyin purple people eater  
What a sight to see Purple people  
  
And then he went on his way and then what do you know  
I saw him last night on a TV show  
He was a blowin it out and really knockin them dead  
Playin rock n roll music through the horn in his head
