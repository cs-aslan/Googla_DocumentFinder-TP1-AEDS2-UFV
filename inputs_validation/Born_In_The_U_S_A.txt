Born down in a dead mans town  
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground  
End up like a dog thats been beat too much  
Till you spend half your life just covering up  
  
Born in the USA I was born in the USA  
I was born in the USA born in the USA  
  
Got in a little hometown cream  
So they put a rifle in my hand  
Sent me off to a foreign land  
To go and kill the yellow man  
  
Born in the USA I was born in the USA  
Born in the USA born in the USA  
  
Come back home to the refinery  
Hiring man said son if it was up to me  
Went down to see my VA man  
He said son dont you understand  
  
I had a brother at Khe Sahn  
Fighting off the Viet Cong  
Theyre still there hes all gone  
  
He had a woman he loved in Saigon  
I got a picture of him in her arms now  
  
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary  
Out by the gas fires of the refinery  
Im ten years burning down the road  
Nowhere to run aint got nowhere to go  
  
Born in the USA I was born in the USA  
Born in the USA Im a long gone daddy in the USA  
Born in the USA born in the USA  
Born in the USA Im a cool rocking daddy in the USA
