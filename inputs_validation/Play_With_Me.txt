1st Verse Violent J  
Every year its more of us and all we do is fill the box  
You might play with me at first a couple days a week at tops  
Just like your Atomic Supersonic Retro Plasma Car  
We will all get tossed inside just like the piece of shit we are  
I will be your fantasy imaginary special friend  
I can fill you  with you no need to talk to them  
But instead you toss me in the box leave me to rott away  
Hoping youll pick me again somedayhey hey  
  
Chorus Violent J  
Why dont you come play with me and take me to the other sidetake me to the  
other side  
Lost under Ann Raggedy its lonely when your locked in side It can be so  
lonley x2  
  
2nd Verse Violent J  
I will sit and listen to your bibble babble jibber talk  
But when you go in tonight youll leave me out here on the walk  
Youll ignore your little friend or trade me for something instead  
Please come get your doggie dont let him chew up my fucking leg  
All your mom and daddy do is work and fight thats all they do  
I can understand the way you feel because I feel it to  
But youll leave me in the box and I can barley hear you play  
Lost umong the toys of yesterday heyheyheyheyhey  
  
Chorus

3rd Verse Violent J  
I can see you near the bed when I look through this tiny crack  
You become much older now and I dont see you turning back  
Seven years in darkness I can only hope my wish comes true  
That one day Ill get you in my handsAND ILL PLAY WITH YOU  
  
Chorus
