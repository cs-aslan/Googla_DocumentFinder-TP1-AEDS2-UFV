Every night seems dinner and wine  
Saturdays girls  
I was never in love never had the time  
In my hustle and hurried world  
Laughing my self to sleep waking up lonely  
I need someone to hold me oh  
  
Its such a crazy home town  
It can drag you down  
Till you run out of dreams  
So you party all night to the music and lights  
But you dont what happiness means  
I was dancing in the dark with strangers  
No love around me  
When suddenly you found me oh  
  
Girl youre every woman in the world to me  
Youre my fantasy youre my reality  
Girl youre every woman in the world to me  
Youre everything I need youre everything to me  
Oh girl  
  
Everything good everything fine  
Thats what you are  
So put your hand in mine and together well climb  
As high as the highest star  
Im living the life time in every minute  
That were together  
And Im staying right here forever oh  
  
Girl youre every woman in the world to me  
Youre my fantasy youre my reality  
Girl youre every woman in the world to me  
Youre everything I need youre everything to me  
Oh girl
