Lazy yellow moon comin up tonite  
Shinin thru the trees  
Crickets are singin and lightning bugs  
Are floatin on the breeze  
Baby get ready  
  
Across the field where the creek turns back by the ole stump road  
Im gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows  
Baby get ready Ooooooooooo  
  
You and me going fishing in the dark  
Lying on our backs and counting the stars  
Where the cool grass grows  
Down by the river in the full moon light  
Well be fallin in love in the middle of the night  
Just movin slow  
  
Stayin the whole night thru feels so good to be with you  
  
Spring is almost over and the summers come  
And the days are gettin long  
Waited all winter for the time to be right just to take you along  
Baby get ready  
  
And it dont matter if we sit forever and the fish dont bite  
Jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night  
Baby get ready Ooooooooooo  
  
Repeat the chorus x3  
  
You and me going fishin in the dark
