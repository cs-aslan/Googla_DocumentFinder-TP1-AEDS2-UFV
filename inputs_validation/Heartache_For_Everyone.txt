You spent five years saying youd come my way  
Well thats a little more waiting than a heart can take  
Yeah but now that I know its just a fantasy  
I feel a hard time coming around for me

Theres a heartache for everyone  
Oh oh

I spent two years saying give me a chance

But not forever it was understood

Hey valentine Im just a stumbling around  
Who knew that Paris was such a lonely town  
Ill meet you at the bridge where we wanted to kiss  
Or take the high road and be done with this  
  
Hey valentine Im just a stumbling around  
Who knew that Paris was such a lonely town  
Ill meet you at the bridge where we wanted to kiss  
Or take the high road and be done with this  
  
Ill give you six more weeks baby just in case  
You can change your mind you wont be replaced  
Are we looking at a lifetime of regret

Or just the one little moment that Ill never forget  
or just the one little moment that well never forget  
  
I said oh  
Im waiting  
Oh oh

Oh oh  
my love  
Theres a heartache for everyone

Theres a heartache for everyone  
Ill wait for you until I know  
Theres a heartache for everyone  
Ill wait for you until I know
