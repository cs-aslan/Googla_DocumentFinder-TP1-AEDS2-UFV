If theres a chance that your heart misses the words I try to say with kisses  
If I dont seem to look as happy as I should  
I wouldnt want to live without you I love everything about you  
Yes even the bad times are good  
  
Your middle name should be perfection cause thats what you are to me  
Even in my darkest moments you make it easier to see  
I wouldnt change one thing about you if I knew that I could  
Yes even the bad times are good  
  
You never let me feel mistreated your love is all Ive ever needed  
When I was weak somehow you always understood  
Youre not afraid of stormy weather and thats what keeps our love together  
Yes even the bad times are good  
  
Your middle name should be perfection  
Even the bad times are good
