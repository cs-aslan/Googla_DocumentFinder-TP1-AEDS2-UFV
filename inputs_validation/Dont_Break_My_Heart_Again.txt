Im gonna take it to the limit of my love  
Before I turn and walk away  
Ive had enough of holding on  
The promises of yesterday  
Every day of my life it seems  
Troubles knocking at my door  
Its hard to try and satisfy  
When you dont know what youre fighting for  
  
Time and again I sing your song  
But Ive been runnin on empty far too long  
Ive had enough holdin on to the past  
Make no mistake it could be your last  
  
Dont break my heart again like you did before  
Dont break my heart again I couldnt take anymore  
  
I never hide the feeling inside  
And though Im standing my back to the wall  
I know that even in a summer love  
A little bit of rain must fall  
But every road I take I know  
Where its gonna lead me to  
Because Ive traveled every highway  
And they all keep coming back to you  
  
Time and again I sing your song  
But Ive been runnin on empty far too long  
Ive had enough holdin on to the past  
Make no mistake it could be your last  
  
Dont break my heart again like you did before  
Dont break my heart again I couldnt take anymore  
Dont break my heart  
  
Dont break my heart again like you did before  
Dont break my heart again I couldnt take anymore
