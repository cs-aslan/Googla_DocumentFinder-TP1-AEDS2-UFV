When you kiss the base omy spine  
Make my body into your shrine  
You give me this feeling deep inside  
One that I can no longer disguise  
While other snakes just shed their skins  
Forked tongues pointing out my sins  
Even though I realise that historys not on my side  
Even though I realise the pioneer skin still curls up in my eyes  
  
If I dont go crazy Ill lose my mind  
I saw a life before me but now Im blind  
I wanna go to heaven never been there before  
I wanna go to heaven so you kill me some more  
  
Flying high upon the gallows  
Too messed up to step out of the shadows  
A drugged up heart that knows no sorrow  
Rescued from this deep dark hollow  
Stick on these boots and sharpen the nails  
Time is nigh for you leather girls  
Maybe we should end this race  
Vanish while we cannot leave no trace  
  
If I dont go crazy Ill lose my mind  
I saw a life before me but now Im blind  
See onearm film stars on alien beaches  
Potted gold and tattooed faces  
Harrison murals on the corner tupperware boxes full of hops  
Diazepam dreams there catching streams  
Paper dinosaurs flash blue and green  
Still Ive got a flashbulb head  
Still Ive got a flashbulb head  
  
If I dont go crazy Ill lose my mind  
I saw a life before me but now Im blind  
I wanna go to heaven never been there before  
I wanna go to heaven so you kill me some more  
  
Come along nice come along dead  
Scorpio rising and paint it red  
A psychic equalizer in your head  
Come along nice come along dead  
Scorpio rising and paint it red  
A psychic equalizer in your head
