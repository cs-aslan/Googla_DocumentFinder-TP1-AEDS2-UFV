Woke up this morning wanting to cry  
Then I remember yes I know why  
Shes a real good one for having her cake  
Im gonna go fishing or jump in the lake  
  
Yeah Im gonna go fishing thats what Ill do  
Think about nothing not even you  
Catch a real big one a big speckled trout  
Snapping in the water Ill pull him on out  
  
Sweet talking liar spin me a yarn  
Tell me a story big as a barn  
Dont stop listening I wont hear you out  
Im gonna go fishing and catch me a trout  
  
If a gal is a liar a gal is a fool  
Playing for keepers and breaking the rules  
Shell be the loser yet to find out  
Im gonna go fishing and catch me a trout  
  
Here in the water look at him shine  
There goes a big one that one is mine  
Catch up the reel now Ive got the feel now  
Hooked onto my fly rod Ive got me a trout  
  
Sweet talking liar youre in for a fall  
You tell me a story you cut to the wall  
Dont go my way Im down the highway  
Im gonna go fishing  
  
Yes Im gonna go fishing  
Yes Im gonna go fishing and get me some trout
