Take heart Even though you find it hard  
To catch your breath much less smile  
  
Take heart Even when your sky is dark  
Therell come a day the clouds will go  
Then youll know once again what life can be  
When you feel all the joy it can bring  
  
Chorus  
If only we could understand what God only knows  
Maybe then it would be easy letting go  
But if the spirit lives forever and true love never dies  
Therell always be a light in your soul  
  
Take heart In each and every tear your cry  
The strength you need will be yours in time  
  
Take heart Somedays not that far away  
There is that place where hope will abide  
And youll find that your heart feels deeper now  
Through the love thats been lost through goodbye  
  
If only we could understand what God only knows  
Maybe then it would be easy letting go  
But if the spirit lives forever and true love never dies  
Therell always be a light in your soul  
  
Always remember to treasure the time  
So man questions with no reason why  
Life passes by So it goes  
  
If only we could understand what God only knows  
Maybe then it would be easy letting go  
But if the spirit lives forever and true love never dies  
Therell always be a light in your soul
