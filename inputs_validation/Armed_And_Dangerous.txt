Ran my Chevy through the car wash  
Threw the beer cans out  
Emptied all the ash trays  
Cleaned a little house  
Got my Allman Brothers cassettes  
Stacked up on the dash  
Got some jack back in the trunk  
And a tank full of gas  
  
Stopped and bought some roses  
To sweep you off your feet  
Yes Im going to the limit  
Im gettin in real deep  
Dusted off my Dingos  
Got my Levis pressed  
Gonna break into your heart  
And steal what I love best  
  
Chorus  
Yes Im armed and dangerous  
Woman youve made me a desperate man  
Armed and dangerous  
Comin for your lovin yes I am  
  
Take a ride out in the country  
Where the grass is tall and cool  
And do some barefoot dancin  
Hows that sound to you  
And Ive got some other things  
That I might suggest  
But if I put them on this record  
Id be under arrest  
  
Chorus
