My young love said to me  
My mother wont mind  
And my father wont slight you  
For your lack of kind  
And she steppd away from me  
And this she did say  
It will not be long love  
Till our wedding day  
  
She steppd away fromme  
And went through the fair  
And fondly I watchd her  
Move here and move there  
And then she went homeward  
With one star awake  
As the swan in the evening  
Moves over the lake  
  
The people were saying  
That no two eer were wed  
And one had a sorrow  
That never was said  
And I smiled as she passed  
With her goods and her gear  
And that was the last  
That I saw my dear  
  
Last night she came to me  
She came softly in  
So softly she came  
That her feet made no din  
And she placed her hand on me  
And this she did say  
Oh it will not be long love  
Till our wedding day
