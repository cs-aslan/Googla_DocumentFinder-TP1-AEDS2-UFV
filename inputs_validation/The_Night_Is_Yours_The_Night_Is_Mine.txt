The night is yours the night is mine  
I beg you baby take your time  
Its like paradise  
See your magic eyes  
Feel the need in me  
The night is yours the night is mine  
I beg your baby take your time  
Heaven in your eyes  
Takes me to the sky  
Im in love with you  
  
Love takes time its hard to find  
Thats true  
Not a game you play  a night or two  
Take my heart  
Lets make it real tonight  
Well be dancin to the pale moonlight  
Your dreams are real today  
And now you gonna stay  
  
I will try to make your dreams come true  
Trust me baby nothing else will do  
Theres no need for you to be so cool  
Love takes time just like the golden rule  
Your dreams are real today  
And now there gonna stay  
  
Girl when I see you smile  
Imaginations running wild  
Love makes me feel alright  
Help me through the night  
Sometimes youre weak  
Sometimes youre wild  
Youre a woman  
Youre a child  
Love makes me feel alright tonight
