Im so sorry I keep interrupting  
What were you gonna say  
You caught him cheating I dont blame you  
For walking away  
I know where youre coming from it sounds like where Ive been  
Oh there I go interrupting your story once again  
  
Go on go on  
You were saying how a fool can only fool you so long  
Its true its so true  
When they do you like that what else can you do  
But go on  
  
Our conversation wont change nothing  
But its sure nice to talk  
With somebody whose been cut of  
The same old cloth  
You know how you said happiness cant be found looking back  
If you dont mind maybe we can talk a little more about that  
  
Go on go on  
You were saying this is better than sitting at home  
Its true its so true  
When they do you like that what else can you do  
But go on  
  
Even when you see no reason to  
Dont wait to live life cause it wont wait for you  
  
Go on please go on  
You were saying what dont kill us only makes us strong  
Its true thats so true  
When they do you like that what else can you do  
But go on  
Just go on  
Life goes on  
And on
