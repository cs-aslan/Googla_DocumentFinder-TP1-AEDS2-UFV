Written by randy owen teddy gentry and greg fowler  
Well the magic attics where the music rolls  
And the armynavys got ol jackie soul  
Down on peaches corner there are good ol boys  
And mother fletchers makin lots of noise  
Theyre dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
Dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
  
Well the tams are playin at the portocall  
And the drifters underneath the boardwalk  
At the sapnish galleon and ol fat jacks  
Jukebox playin and the place is packed  
You bet theyre dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
You know theyre dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
  
Got the top down and the traffics slow  
Sun fun week and we all go  
Where the girls are sunnin and lookin good  
Well i never met em but i wish i could  
And wed go dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
Wed go dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
  
Well the embers singin up on ocean drive  
And the castaways are gettin loud tonight  
At the electric circus they all getin down  
And the carousels spinnin round and round  
See them dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
I see em dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
  
Well im hangin out down at sloppy joes  
They may doze but they never close  
And the bama boys at the bowery  
They cant dance but they play for free  
But they like dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
They know dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
They wrote dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
  
Dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
Dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
Shaggin on the boulevard  
Dancin shaggin on the boulevard  
Dancin shaggin on the boulevard
