Remember walking with you by my side  
You were my papa and I was your pride  
Now Ive got children and Im going grey  
No time for talking I got nothin to say  
Those Sunday dinners that we had at home  
Now Ive got a house and Ive got friends of my own  
We cant do tomorrow what we did yesterday  
Its best that were going our separate ways ok  
How is your rheumatism nothing to say  
How are your chillblains nothing to say  
Hows Aunty Mabel nothing to say  
So far papa I got nothin to say ok  
Those happy days we spent together  
We thought our world would never change  
How the days go by  
And things will never be the same  
You keep pretending that everythings fine  
So you make small talk to help pass the time  
But all the words that you spit from your face  
Add up to nothin you got nothin to say  
How are those noisy neighbors next door  
Ill have to go soon cause Im getting bored  
I gotta be home early to see a good play  
So far papa I got nothin to say  
How is your life insurance nothing to say  
How is your trade union nothing to say  
How is your independence nothing to say  
So for papa I got nothin to say
