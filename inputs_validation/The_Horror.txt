Theres a red worm crawling in my head  
Cut in half worm in my blood he lies red  
And I see him in my head  
Its my nightmare oh its my dream  
Hes inside here silencing my screams  
Alone on a razors edge  
Alone sliding on the razors edge  
  
Im the horror on the edge  
Cause I Im the worm that cometh  
I am him I am hell I am god Im the devil all in one  
The eyes that hide the face inside  
Come stare into my eyes  
  
A killers listening to horrors in my head  
Hes bleeding sliding on the razors edge  
Through my eyes he watches me  
He lies inside watching me  
Theres a red noise deep inside my head  
An obscure noise and the smell of slow death  
If theres a hell then Ill be there  
  
I am god obscene death  
Im the worm on razors edge  
All pigs die  
Kill fuck die  
  
I am hell godless me  
I am pagan idolatry  
Kneel before the horror  
Kneel before the horror  
Fuck me kill me drink my blood  
Fuck me kill me drink my blood  
All pigs die kill fuck die  
  
Im the horror on the edge  
Cause I Im the worm that cometh I am him I am hell  
I am god Im the devil all in one  
The eyes that hide the face inside  
Come stare into my eyes
