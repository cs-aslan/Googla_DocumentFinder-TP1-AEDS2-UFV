Tell me when youre sad  
Im gonna make it cool again  
I know youre feeling bad  
Tell me when youre cool again  
  
Whod have ever thought of it  
Whod have ever dreamed  
That a small town girl like you  
Would be the boss of me  
  
We fly through the night  
The tears on your lips  
Life has your mind and soul  
It spins on your hips  
  
Whod have ever thought of it  
Whod have ever dreamed  
  
Whod have ever thought of it  
Whod have ever dreamed  
That a small town girl like you  
Would be the boss of me  
Would be the boss of me  
Would be the boss of me  
  
You look at me and you reach for the free blue sky  
I look to the stars as they flicker and float in your eyes  
And under these wings of steel the small town dies  
  
Whod have ever thought of it  
Whod have ever dreamed  
  
Whod have ever thought of it  
Whod have ever dreamed  
That a small town girl like you  
Would be the boss of me  
  
Whod have ever thought of it  
Whod have ever dreamed  
That a small town girl like you  
Would be the boss of me  
Would be the boss of me  
Would be the boss of me
