The circus is coming to town it said on the poster  
Get your tickets now before its too late  
A dancing bear and a circus clown its so funny  
I cant wait to see everything there  
  
I feel like Im already there  
I must see her fly through the air  
  
Horse running round and round in a circle  
I cant wait to see everything there  
I wonder if its just like they say on the poster  
If it is I know I will be there  
  
I feel like Im already there  
I must see her fly through the air  
I feel like Im already there  
I must see her fly through the air  
repeat and fade
