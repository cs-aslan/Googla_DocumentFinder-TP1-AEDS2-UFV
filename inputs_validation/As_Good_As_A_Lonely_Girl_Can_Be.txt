Tell me darling have I been away too long  
I was wrong to leave but now Im coming home  
Have you missed me I kind of hope you would and jokingly I ask are you being
good  
Im being good as lonely girl can be  
And theres no other place on earth Id rather be  
To lie here beside him oh Lord how sweet love can be  
Im being good as lonely girl can be  
It was just too much for me I shouldve known  
You were just too much a woman to me alone  
I just realized I love you much too late and Lord its killing me to hear you
say  
Im being good as lonely girl can be  
Tell me darling have I been away too long  
I know I was wrong to leave but now all I wanna do is come back home  
Youre just too much to me I know I shouldve known  
You were just too much woman for me to leave alone
