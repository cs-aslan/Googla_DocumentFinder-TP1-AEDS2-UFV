Dry your eyes my little friend  
Let me take you by the hand  
Freddie get ready Rock steady  
When Johnny strikes up the band  
  
Theyll be rocking in the projects  
Walking down along the strand  
Freddie get ready Rock steady  
When Johnny strikes up the band  
Johnny strikes up the band  
When Johnny strikes up the  
When Johnny strikes up the  
When Johnny strikes up the band  
  
And Johnny is my main man  
Hes the keeper of the keys  
Hell put your mind at ease  
Hes guaranteed to please  
Back by popular demand  
  
Look around my little friend  
Jubilation in the land  
Freddie get ready Rock steady  
When Johnny strikes up the band  
Johnny strikes up the band  
When Johnny strikes up the  
When Johnny strikes up the  
When Johnny strikes up the band
