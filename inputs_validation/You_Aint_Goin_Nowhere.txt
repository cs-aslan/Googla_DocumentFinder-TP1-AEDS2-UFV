Clouds so swift  
Rain wont lift  
Gate wont close  
Railings froze  
Get your mind off wintertime  
You aint going nowhere  
Ooee Ride me high  
Tomorrows the day  
My brides gonna come  
Oh no are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
  
I dont care  
How many letters they sent  
The morning came and the morning went  
Pick up your money  
And pack up your tent  
You aint going nowhere  
Ooee Ride me high  
Tomorrows the day  
My brides gonna come  
I said oh no are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
  
Buy me a flute  
And a gun that shoots  
Tailgates and substitutes  
Strap yourself  
To a tree with roots  
Cause you know you aint going nowhere  
I said ooee Ride me high  
Tomorrows the day  
My brides gonna come  
I said oh no are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
  
Genghis Khan  
He could not keep  
All his kings  
Supplied with sleep  
Well climb that hill no matter how steep  
Just as soon as we get the hell up to it  
And Everybody says  
Whooee Ride me high  
Tomorrows the day  
My brides gonna come  
Oh no are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
  
I said ooee Ride me high  
Tomorrows the day  
My brides gonna come  
I said oh no are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
  
Well everybody said ooee Ride me high  
Tomorrows the day  
My brides gonna come  
I said oh no are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
  
Ooee Wont you ride me high  
Tomorrows the day  
My brides gonna come  
I said oh no are we gonna fly  
Down into the easy chair
