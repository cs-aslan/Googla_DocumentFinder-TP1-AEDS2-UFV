Mary queen of Arkansas its not too early for dreamin  
The sky is grown with cloud seed sown and a bastards love can be redeeming  
Mary my queen your soft hulk is reviving  
No youre not too late to desecrate the servants are just rising  
Well Im just a lonely acrobat the live wire is my trade  
Ive been a shine boy for your acid brat and a wharf rat of your state  
Mary my queen your blows for freedom are missing  
Youre not man enough for me to hate or woman enough for kissing  
  
The big top is for dreamers we can take the circus all the way to the  
Border  
And the gallows wait for martyrs whose papers are in order  
But I was not born to live to die and you were not born for queenin  
Its not too late to infiltrate the servants are just leavin  
  
Mary queen of Arkansas your white skin is deceivin  
You wake and wait to lie in bait and you almost got me believin  
But on your bed Mary I can see the shadow of a noose  
I dont understand how you can hold ma so tight and love me so damn loose  
  
But I know a place where we can go Mary  
Where I can get a good job and start all over again clean  
I got contacts deep in Mexico where the servants have been seen
