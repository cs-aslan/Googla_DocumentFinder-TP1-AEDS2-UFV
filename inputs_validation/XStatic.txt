Leading everything along  
Never far from being wrong  
Never mind these things at all  
Its nothing  
  
Couldnt find a way to you  
Seems thats all I ever do  
Turning up in black and blue  
Rewarded  
  
All the static we all left  
  
Wait until the time has come  
Figure thats where time comes from  
Leaving all my senses numb  
Is heaven  
  
Lifted up the fay to seen  
Anything could never be  
Anything but play to me  
In order  
  
Take it back for them to keep  
Fallen into something deep  
Not that I had made that leap  
Anointed  
  
Where have all the wishes gone  
Now that all of that is done  
Wish I wouldve felt Ive won  
For once
