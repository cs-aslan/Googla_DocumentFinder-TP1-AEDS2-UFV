You never take the easy way  
The wind is blowing straight into your face  
You never ever close your eyes  
For any trouble that may cross your way  
Theres no risk that youre not taking  
Not a mountain thats too high  
Spread your wings youre gonna make it  
To the best time of your life  
  
Dont stop at the top  
Touch the sky before you drop  
You never make a compromise  
Your will has got the power that wont break  
You never say never to a challenge  
That will come along the way  
Theres no risk that youre not taking  
Not a mountain thats too high  
Spread your wings youre gonna make it  
To the best time of your life  
  
Dont stop at the top  
Touch the sky before you drop  
Never stop Dont stop at the top
