Verse 1  
Wake up in the morning grab my trees and I get to it  
Young nigga I do my own thing so let me do it  
If you wanna know a thing about me Im bout my paper  
Fuck a bitch soon as my iPhone ring I see you later  
Hop on in the Chevy grab my keys and then Im outtie  
First thing If its bout that cheese then Im about it  
I be stacking up got no time for niggas hating  
Low we backing up keep that clean and watch some Daytons  
Cruising down the street hear my car before its coming  
Fuck the police windows down Im smoking something  
And my bitch bad she gon ride If shit get crazy  
Goons messed up they gon slide you try to play me

Spent a couple hundred thousand in a couple of days  
Smoke a pound in my suite and then come up with a plate  
Bitch came over to my crib and had a comfortable stay
