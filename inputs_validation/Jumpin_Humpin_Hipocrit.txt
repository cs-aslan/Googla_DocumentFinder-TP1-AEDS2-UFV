Hey got my hands in my back pocket  
Im a jumpin  
Unscrewing the light from the socket  
And Id rather stand than sit  
Puttin all the people in the dark  
Tellin everyone good night bye bye  
I put the sound  
  
Carryin the truth in my back pocket  
My hands are holdin me down  
Ive been waiting for people to ask me  
What have you found  
  
Im a jumpin humpin hip hypocrit  
I was dead before a gypsy  
She held my head and  
Fought with my boots till my eyes turned red  
Im a jumpin humpin hip hypocrit  
Oh Id rather stand than sit  
Ive been down to the gutter  
Hopin Ive lived on honey and butter  
But with me a lifes a game  
I call insane  
Im not the one to blame  
Im called insane  
  
I was hung when I was young  
I was named insane  
Im a jumpin humpin hip hypocrit  
I broke all the laws before my age  
Im a jumpin humpin hip hypocrit  
Yeah Id rather stand than sit  
Im a jumpin humpin hip hypocrit  
I turn around to see the clown  
But with me a lifes a game  
I call insane  
Im not the one to blame  
Im called insane  
  
Im a jumpin humpin hip hypocrit  
Id rather stand than sit  
Im a jumpin humpin hip hypocrit  
Id rather stand than sit  
I put the sound
