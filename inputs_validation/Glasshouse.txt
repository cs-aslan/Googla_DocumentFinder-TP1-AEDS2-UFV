If youre livin in a glass house  
Dont throw no stones  
If youre livin in a glass house  
Dont throw no stones  
  
Were all made  
With feet of clay and some dreams  
Were born alone  
And we die alone  
Why cant we live  
In between  
  
I dont care  
What goes on in your house  
When you close the door  
If you stop lookin in my bedroom window  
Ill stop lookin in yours  
  
My girl came home and she caught me with Alice  
And she threw me out the door  
Now now now  
But the real reason that she was so mad  
Is that she was with Alice before  
Say what  
If youre livin in a glass house  
No dontcha throw no stones  
If youre livin in a glass house  
Dontcha throw stones  
  
Sweet talkin  
Bar hoppin  
Pill poppin  
Wife swappin  
Swappin  
Swappin  
Sweet talkin  
Bar hoppin  
Pill poppin  
Wife swappin  
Swappin  
Swappin  
  
If youre livin in a glass house  
Dont throw no stones  
If youre livin in a glass house  
Dont throw no stones
