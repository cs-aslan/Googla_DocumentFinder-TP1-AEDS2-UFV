I dont know what he does to make you cry  
But Ill be there to make you smile  
I dont have a fancy car  
To get to you Id walk a thousand miles  
I dont care if he buys you nice things  
Does his gifts come from the heart  
I dont know but if you were my girl  
Id make it so wed never be apart  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I dont think I could live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give  
When you talk does it seem like hes not  
Even listenin to a word you say  
Thats okay baby just tell me your problems  
Ill try my best to kiss them all away  
Does he leave when you need him the most  
Does his friends get all your time  
Baby please Im on my knees  
Prayin for the day that youll be mine  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I dont think I could live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give to you  
Hey girl I dont want you to cry no more inside oh  
All the money in the world could never add up to  
All the love I have inside I love you baby  
And I will give it to you  
All I can give all I can give  
All everything I have is for you  
Youve got what I got you you  
What I need my love is all I have to give  
All that I have is for you  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I dont think I could live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I dont think I can live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give to you  
I have to give  
Without you I dont think I could live  
Give the world to you lady  
But love is all I have to give  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I dont think I could live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give to you
