We all feel the same  
All pleasure nothing to gain  
Ive known you from the start  
Ive grown used to your wooden heart  
Now you know my name  
You search your empty brain in vain  
If you dont change your ways  
Youll end up here with me unraised  
Without you theyll never know  
Without you my life wont flow  
Without you theyll never show  
Without you the night wont go  
Without you Im left alone  
Without you Im on my own  
Without you I lay in pain  
Without you Ive gone insane  
  
Now you must decide  
What goods a lie when youve nothing to hide  
Maps theyll never show  
Theyre dumb like you they never know  
Its time we said goodbye  
Bury your head and silence your cry  
Know the feel of pain  
Join our world and play our game  
  
Without you theyll never know  
Without you my life wont grow  
Without you theyll never show  
Without you the night wont go  
Without you Im left alone  
Without you Im on my own  
Without you my lifes a waste  
Just for you I wrap my face  
Without you Im left alone  
Without you Im on my own  
Without you I live in pain  
Without you Ive gone insane  
  
Whatever you may think of me  
Dont ever take my dignity x4  
Whatever you may do to me  
Dont crucify my dignity
