When I was a young boy  
Said put away those young boy ways  
Now that Im gettin older so much older  
I love all those young boy days  
With a girl like you  
With a girl like you  
Lord knows there are things we can do baby  
Just me and you  
Come on and make it hurt  
  
CHORUS  
Hurt so good  
Come on baby make it hurt so good  
Sometimes love dont feel like it should  
You make it hurt so good  
  
Dont have to be so exciting  
Just tryin to give myself a little bit of fun yeah  
You always look so invitin  
You aint as green as you are young  
Hey baby its you  
Come on girl now its you  
Sink your teeth right through my bones baby  
Lets see what we can do  
Come on and make it hurt  
  
Chorus  
  
I aint talkin no big deals  
I aint made no plans myself  
I aint talkin no high heels  
Maybe we could walk around all day long  
Walk around all day long  
Uh  
  
Chorus twice  
  
Hey hey
