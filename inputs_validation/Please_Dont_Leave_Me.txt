I sit by my window watch the clouds go by  
Every moment is a one that Im  
Crying my heart out cause Im not there with you  
I feel like a fool Ive got so much shame  
I know I should just walk away  
But what will I do with all this pain I feel for you  
  
Please dont leave me  
Not this time  
I dont think I can survive it  
Ill have nothing  
Not even my pride  
So please dont leave me  
Not this time  
  
So many nights I lay in bed  
I stare at the place where you laid your head  
I wonder whos lying with you instead of me  
I cant make you feel it if it isnt there  
No way to convince you if you just dont care  
Look in your heart maybe you could spare a place for me  
  
Please dont leave me  
Not this time  
I dont think I can survive it  
Id have nothing  
Not even my pride  
So please dont leave me  
Not this time  
  
You made your point  
Its clear to me  
Theres somewhere else youd rather be  
But I cant bear the thought of life without you  
  
I sit by my window watch the clouds go by  
But I cant bear the thought of life without you  
  
Please dont leave me  
Not this time  
I dont think I can survive it  
Id have nothing  
Not even my pride  
So please dont leave me  
Not this  
Please dont leave me  
Not this time  
I dont think I can survive it  
Id have nothing  
Not even my pride  
So please dont leave me  
Not this time
