Mark  
Im feeling so alone now tonight  
Even though youre here by my side  
Is there something on your mind  
From the world youd left behind  
  
I feel as if the loved shared before  
Doesnt want to be here no more  
And if theres something on your mind  
Theres never been a better time  
To tell me  
  
Bryan  
Do you love me  
Still wanting me  
Like I need you oh  
  
All  
There came a crossing on the road  
If only there were signs to show me  
Which direction I should go  
I live my life with no regrets  
It hasnt caught up on me yet  
But I never knew I was losing you  
  
Nicky  
I wonder as you walk through the door  
Are you gonna hurt me some more  
Never took you for the kind  
Who would play up on my mind  
  
Bryan  
Tell me what are you looking for  
I cant play your games anymore  
And when theres something on my mind  
I will always find the time  
To tell you  
  
I still love you  
Still wanting you  
How I need you oh  
  
All  
There came a crossing on the road  
If only there were signs to show me  
Which direction I should go  
I live my life with no regrets  
It hasnt caught up on me yet  
Well I never knew I was losing you  
Losing you  
  
Bryan  
Its not for the first time  
That someone else has hurt me  
By faking it too long  
Where did we go wrong yeah  
  
All  
There came a crossing on the road  
If only there were signs to show me  
Which direction I should go  
I live my life with no regrets  
It hasnt caught up on me yet  
Well I never knew I was losing you  
  
There came a crossing on the road  
If only there were signs to show me  
Which direction I should go  
I live my life with no regrets  
It hasnt caught up on me yet  
Well I never knew I was losing you  
Losing you
