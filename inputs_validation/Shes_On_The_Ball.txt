If you beg a date  
She says Youre too late  
Then later she gives you a call  
Dont hesitate youre in for a break  
Cause Jack shes on the ball  
  
If she winks at you  
Dont you miss that cue  
For this is no time for a stall  
Man call a hack and get to your shack  
Cause Jack shes on the ball  
  
No use in her denying  
You dont have to do much trying  
Just remember this when she gives you her kiss  
Her heart and soul are pining  
  
So remember Gates  
Its never too late  
If ever she starts n to stall  
Just bait your trap shell fall just like that  
Cause Jack shes on the ball  
  
No use in her denying  
You dont have to do much trying  
Cause remember this if she gives you her kiss  
Her heart and soul are pining  
  
So remembergate  
Its never too late  
Whenever she starts n to stall  
Just bait your trap shell fall just like that  
Cause Jack shes on the ball  
Mm Jack shes on the ball  
Im tellin you buddy  
Jack shes on the ball  
Of course if shes fine its understood that  
Jack shes on the ball
