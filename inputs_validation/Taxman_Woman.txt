I wake up in the morning Im thinking of you  
In Dollars and Cents in high heel shoes  
  
I start to think and the headache goes boom  
Im counting the bills that are stacked to the moon  
  
The money Im giving to you  
I could live on forever on the sunny side  
What can I do so my life  
Turns around for the better God knows that I tried  
  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Cant you see its only money  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Cant you see its so hard honey  
To keep up with you  
  
I work twice as hard what else can I do  
To make up the part thats been taken by you  
  
If it wasnt for you I would be rich  
But instead Im a poor son of a bitch  
  
The money Im giving to you  
I could live on forever on the sunny side  
What can I do so my life  
Turns around for the better Got knows that I tried  
  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Cant you see its only money  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Cant you see its so hard honey  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Cant you see that it aint funny  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Cant you see its so hard honey  
To keep up with you
