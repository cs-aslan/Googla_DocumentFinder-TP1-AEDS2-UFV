Underneath the bridge  
The tarp has sprung a leak  
And the animals Ive trapped  
Have all become my pets  
And Im living off of grass  
And the drippings from the ceiling  
But its okay to eat fish  
Cause they dont have any feelings  
  
Something in the way  
Ummmmm  
Something in the way yeah  
Ummmmm  
Something in the way

Something in the way yeah
