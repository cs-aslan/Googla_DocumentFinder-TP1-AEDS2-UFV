See its hard to tell somebody  
That youre still somewhat  
Attached to the dream  
Of being in love once again  
When its clear theyve moved on  
  
So I sat down and wrote these few words  
On the off chance youd hear  
And if you happen to be somewhere listening  
You should know Im still here  
  
If you really need me  
Baby just reach out and touch me  
You dont ever have to be  
Downhearted again  
If she hurts you or misleads you  
Baby all you ever need to do  
Is call me and let love rush in  
  
What can I say I had a little extra time  
So I figured I might as well explain  
A couple little things to you  
That you probably never knew  
Like youll always be an intrinsic part of me  
Even though life goes on  
  
If you really need me  
Baby just reach out and touch me  
You dont ever have to be  
Downhearted again  
If she hurts you or misleads you  
Baby all you ever need to do  
Is call me and let love rush in  
  
And in my love will flow  
Like the waves to the shore  
You can fall into me  
Once again effortlessly  
And Ill comfort you so  
  
Your heart wont hurt anymore  
Im waiting patiently  
  
If you really need me  
Baby just reach out and touch me  
You dont ever have to be  
Downhearted again  
If she hurts you or misleads you  
Baby all you ever need to do  
if she hurts you or misleads you Is call me and let love rush in  
you can just call me baby  
If you really need me if you really need me baby  
Baby just reach out and touch mereach reach baby

You dont ever have to be

Downhearted again  
If she hurts you or misleads youif she hurts you

Baby all you ever need to do  
Is call me and let love rush in  
all you gotta do is call me boy I got you  
  
If you really need me yeah  
Baby just reach out and touch me  
if youre listening to me baby  
You dont ever have to be like you used to  
Downhearted again  
before I even knew you  
If she hurts you or misleads you  
then you know Im singing to you  
Baby all you ever need to do  
so I just wanted you to know  
Is call me and let love rush in  
that anytime you need a friend  
  
If you really need me Im here  
Baby just reach out and touch me

You dont ever have to be in fairy tales  
Downhearted again yours and mine  
If she hurts you or misleads you  
so if by chance you take a listen  
Baby all you ever need to do

In that this ones for you
