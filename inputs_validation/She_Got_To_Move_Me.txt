Feelin kind of down cause I needed some female company  
Suddenly I felt this pair of eyes starin at me  
She got to move me she got the soul  
Never should have told me she was only fourteen years old  
How was I to know  
  
She said   
Chorus  
Get it up baby dont you want me to shake that thing  
Get it up baby drive me crazy Ill do anything  
Get it up baby I came even to make you say shake that thing  
  
Oooo   
  
Make me want to yell make me want to shout make me want to scream  
I didnt have to fantasize she made me dream  
She got to move me she got the soul  
Her eyes could tantalize for fourteen years old  
How was I to know  
  
She said   
Chorus  
  
Owww   
  
Chorus
