Some people dont seem real at all  
Unafraid of any mountain  
Sure that the gods wont let him fall  
Should he fall he will always get up again  
And if hes hurt he never shows it  
If hes wrong nobody knows it  
Seems like he never has to try  
He just must be a lucky guy  
And when theres pain he never minds it  
When its lost he always finds it  
Nobody really knows just why  
He just must be a lucky guy  
He just must be a lucky guy  
I wish I was that lucky guy
