Honey honey can I put on your clothes  
Because they feel so good  
And they feel like you  
Oh wont you please let me  
Because they get to me  
They touch me and then move me  
  
I get to thinking I wont be needin  
Anything more to keep me warm  
I feel the feeling of you  
Al1 the way through  
No other feeling will ever do  
  
Honey honey  
Can I put on your clothes  
Because they feel so good  
And they feel like you  
  
Theyre just like old friends  
When were together  
They comfort me and soothe me  
Theyre not brand new  
  
Theyre a little worn through  
But theyre comfy and roomy  
They do something to me  
And when I stay at home  
And youre far away  
I won t be lonely all through the day  
  
Honey honey  
Can I put on your clothes  
Because they feel so good  
And they feel like you  
  
I feel the feeling of you  
All the day through  
No other feeling will ever do  
  
Honey honey  
Can I put on your clothes  
Because they feel so good  
And they feel like you  
Honey honey honey hum
