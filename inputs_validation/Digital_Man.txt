His world is under observation  
We monitor his station  
Under faces and the places  
Where he traces points of view  
  
He picks up scraps of conversation  
Radio and radiation  
From the dancers and romancers  
With the answers but no clue  
  
Hed love to spend the night in Zion  
Hes been a long while in Babylon  
Hed like a lovers wings to fly on  
To a tropic isle of Avalon  
  
His world is under anesthetic  
Subdivided and synthetic  
His reliance on the giants  
In the science of the day  
  
He picks up scraps of information  
Hes adept at adaptation  
Cause for strangers and arrangers  
Constant change is here to stay  
  
Hes got a force field and a flexible plan  
Hes got a date with fate in a black sedan  
He plays fast forward for as long as he can  
But he wont need a bed  
Hes a digital man
