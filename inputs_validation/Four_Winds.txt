Your class your caste your country sect your name or your tribe  
Theres people always dying trying to keep them alive  
Theres bodies decomposing in containers tonight  
In an abandoned building where  
Squatters made a mural of a Mexican girl  
With fifteen cans of spray paint and a chemical swirl  
Shes standing in the ashes at the end of the world  
Four winds blowing through her hair  
  
But when great Satans gone the Whore of Babylon  
She just cant sustain the pressure where its placed  
She caves She caves  
  
The Bibles blind the Torahs deaf the Qurans mute  
If you burned them all together youd get close to the truth still  
Theyre pouring over Sanskrit on the Ivy League moons  
While shadows lengthen in the sun  
Cast all the school and meditation built to soften the times  
And hold us at the center while the spiral unwinds  
Its knocking over fences crossing property lines  
Four Winds cry until it comes  
  
And its the Sum of Man slouching towards Bethlehem  
A heart just cant contain all of that empty space  
It breaks It breaks It breaks  
  
Well I went back by rented Cadillac and company jet  
Like a newly orphaned refugee retracing my steps  
All the way to Cassadaga to commune with the dead  
They said Youd better look alive  
And I was off to old Dakota where a genocide sleeps  
In the Black Hills the Badlands the calloused East  
I buried my ballast I made my peace  
  
Heard Four Winds leveling the pines  
  
But when great Satans gone the Whore of Babylon  
She just cant remain with all that outer space  
She breaks She breaks She caves She caves  
She breaks  
  
You better look alive
