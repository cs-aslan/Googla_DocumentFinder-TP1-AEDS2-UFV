Well i can see  that you werent givin enough  
That you werent givin as much as me  
With all your small talk  bendin the rules  
Are you runnin before you can walk  
Ive got the feelin youve been runnin around  
Youve gone and left behind the feelin wed found  
Too much too soon too much too soon  
Too much too soon  
  
Well can you get excited by what you see  
Youve been takin my love  
You should be giving it back to me  
Give a little bit of love like you did before  
Give a little bit more give a little bit more  
Give a little bit more like you did before  
Give a little bit more  
  
In a photograph you didnt put me in the picture  
My lovin just made you laugh i was wide eyed  
Taken right in i cant understand why you lied  
Ive got the feelin youve been runnin around  
Youve gone and left behind the feelin wed found  
Too much too soon too much too soon  
Too much too soon  
  
Well can you get excited by what you see  
Youve been taking my love  
You should be giving it back to me  
Give a little bit of love like you did before  
Give a little bit more give a little bit more  
Give a little bit more like you did before  
Give a little bit more  
solo  
Ive got the feelin youve been runnin around  
Youve gone and left behind the feelin wed found  
Too much too soon too much too soon  
Too much too soon  
  
Key change  
Well can you get excited by what you see  
Youve been taking my love  
You should be giving it back to me  
Give a little bit of love like you did before  
Give a little bit more give a little bit more  
Give a little bit more  
like you did before  
Give a little bit more
