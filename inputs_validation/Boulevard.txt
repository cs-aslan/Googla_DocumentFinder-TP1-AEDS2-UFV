Down on the boulevard they take it hard  
They look at life with such disregard  
They say it cant be won  
The way the game is run  
But if you choose to stay  
You end up playing anyway  
Its okay  
The kids in shock up and down the block  
The folks are home playing beat the clock  
Down at the golden cup  
They set the young ones up  
Under the neon light  
Selling day for night  
Its alright  
Nobody rides for free  
Nobody gets it like they want it to be  
Nobody hands you any guarantee  
Nobody  
The hearts are hard and the times are tough  
Down on the boulevard the nights enough  
And time passes slow  
Between the store front shadows and the street lights glow  
Everybody walks right by like theyre safe or something  
They dont know  
Nobody knows you  
Nobody owes you nothin  
Nobody shows you what theyre thinking  
Nobody baby  
Hey hey baby  
You got to watch the street keep your feet  
And be on guard  
Make it pay baby  
Its only time on the boulevard
