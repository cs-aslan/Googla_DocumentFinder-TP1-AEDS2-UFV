Here I am  
And beyond the reach of my hands  
Shes sound asleep  
And shes sweet another know why  
These dreams couldve seen her  
And I watched her slipping away  
And I know Ill be hunting high and low  
High  
Theres no end to the lengths Ill go to  
High and low  
High  
Theres no end to the lengths Ill go to  
Find her again  
Upon this my dreams are depending  
Through the dark  
I can hear the pounding of her heart  
Next to mine  
Shes the sweetest love I could find  
So I know Ill be hunting high and low  
High  
Theres no end to the lengths Ill go to  
High and low  
High  
Do you know how it feels to love you  
Do you know how it feels to love you  
High and Low
