Grannys always ravin and rantin  
And shes always puffin and pantin  
And shes always screaming and shouting  
And shes always brewing up tea  
  
Grandpappys never late for his dinner  
Cause he loves his leg of beef  
And he washes it down with a brandy  
And a fresh made cup of tea  
  
Chorus  
Have a cuppa tea have a cuppa tea  
Have a cuppa tea have a cuppa tea  
Halleluja halleluja halleluja Rosie Lea  
Halleluja halleluja halleluja Rosie Lea  
  
If you feel a bit under the weather  
If you feel a little bit peeved  
Take grannys standby potion  
For any old cough or wheeze  
Its a cure for hepatitis its a cure for chronic insomnia  
Its a cure for tonsillitis and for water on the knee  
  
Chorus  
  
Tea in the morning tea in the evening tea at supper  
Time  
You get tea when its raining tea when its snowing  
Tea when the weathers fine  
You get tea as a midday stimulant  
You get tea with your afternoon tea  
For any old ailment or disease  
For Christ sake have a cuppa tea  
  
Chorus  
  
Whatever the situation whatever the race or creed  
Tea knows no segregation no class nor pedigree  
It knows no motivations no sect or organization  
It knows no one religion  
Nor political belief  
  
Chorus
