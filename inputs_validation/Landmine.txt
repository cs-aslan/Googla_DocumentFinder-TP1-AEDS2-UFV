Well there aint much entertainment  
In a town this size at all  
So Ive got myself up dressed for this arraignment  
Cause I dont think Im ready for the fall  
  
Now I find my thoughts deep in this room all by myself  
Thinking the moon might just explode if I dont leave  
And the more I wait  
It seems the more I hate  
This town for what its doing to me  
This is when I need you most of all  
  
Then I stepped upon a landmine  
And I saw my future rise  
Im getting to know you  
Between the lines  
  
I dropped down to about one foot two  
Hoping to get more looks for you  
But it never made much difference in your eyes  
And I suppose that I couldnt help things much  
To set this day in a whirlwind rush  
After finding out the backseat changed our lives  
  
Then I stepped upon a landmine  
And I saw my future rise  
Im getting to know you  
Between the lines  
Between the lines  
  
Its 5am and if I run  
I am sure to pay for what Ive done  
And if I say Im sure I wish I ran  
And though I knew this day would come  
I never thought that I would run  
For someone who was blind to me  
Youre as blind to me as you could be  
  
Na na nana na  
Na na nana na  
Na na nana na  
Yeah  
  
Then I stepped upon a landmine  
And I saw my future rise  
Im getting to know myself  
Between the lines  
Between the lines
