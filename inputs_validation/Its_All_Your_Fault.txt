I conjure up the thought of being gone  
But Id probably even do that wrong  
I try to think about which way  
Would I be able to and would I be afraid  
  
Cause oh Im bleeding out inside  
Oh I dont even mind Yeah  
  
Its all your fault  
You called me beautiful  
You turned me out  
And now I cant turn back  
I hold my breath  
Because you were perfect  
But Im running out of air  
And its not fair  
  
Da da dada da dada da  
Da dadadadadada da dadadadadada  
  
Im trying to figure out what else to say What else could I say  
To make you turn around and come back this way Would you just come back this
way  
I feel like we could be really awesome together  
So make up your mind cause its now or never oh  
  
Its all your fault  
You called me beautiful  
You turned me out  
And now I cant turn back  
I hold my breath  
Because you were perfect  
But Im running out of air  
And its not fair  
  
I would never pull the trigger  
But Ive cried wolf a thousand times  
I wish you could  
Feel as bad as I do  
I have lost my mind  
  
Its all your fault  
You called me beautiful  
You turned me out  
And now I cant turn back  
I hold I hold my breath My breath  
Because you were perfect  
But Im running out of air running out of air  
And its not fair  
  
Oh yeah  
Its all your fault  
  
I hold my breath  
Because you were perfect  
But Im running out of air  
And its not Its not fair
