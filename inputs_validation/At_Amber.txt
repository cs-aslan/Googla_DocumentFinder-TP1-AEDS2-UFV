Im calling you from the foyer  
Of the Sands Hotel  
Where the men and the women  
Are acquainted quite well  
  
And the drunkards keep on drinking  
And oh my room is cold  
Im disputing the bill  
I will sleep in my clothes  
  
And you my invalid friend  
You slam the receiver when you say  
If I had your limbs for a day  
I would steam away  
  
Im calling you from the foyer  
Of this awful hotel  
Where the slime and the grime  
Gel  
  
And I cannot  or I do not  
And oh my room is cold  
And Im envying you never having to choose  
  
And you my invalid friend  
You slam the receiver when you say  
If I had your limbs for a day  
I would steam away  
  
Im calling you from the foyer  
Of the Sands Hotel  
Its not lowlife its just people  
Having a good time  
And oh my invalid friend  
Oh my invalid friend  
In our different ways we are  
The same
