I tried to tell you  
But the words always came out wrong  
You never knew it  
But I loved you all along  
Are we two worlds in collision  
Maybe its time for you to listen to my  
  
Chorus  
True confessions  
My love Im givin you  
My true confessions  
Show love when you hear my  
True confessions  
  
Never meant to hurt you  
I was lonely and she was so kind  
One stolen moment  
That I cant get off my mind  
Lets end this silent suspicion  
Baby its time for you to listen to my  
  
Chorus  
  
No more hiding the rage  
Gotta let it out of this cage  
So wont you show me you care  
Ooh baby wont you share
