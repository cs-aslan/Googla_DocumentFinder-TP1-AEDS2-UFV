You say I wanna be ok hey  
Dont wanna be away babe  
Away from my heart  
I want you back  
  
You say I wanna be ok hey  
Dont wanna be away babe  
Away from my heart

I used to scream around  
When I was angry  
Im asking baby why  
The hell you left me lonely  
  
I used to fall in love  
And Im not sorry  
I know one day you will be back to me  
Dont worry  
  
When your life gets a little dangerous  
Dont forget that you are one of us  
Dream enough to see the sunlight  
Ohh then you rise up to the sky

Dont wanna be away babe  
Away from my heart  
I want you back
