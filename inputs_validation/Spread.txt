Chorus 1  
I dont want to move too fast but  
Cant resist your sexy ass  
Just spread spread for me  
I cant I cant wait to get you home  
Dont want to come on too strong but  
Ill play in you all day long  
Just spread spread for me  
I cant I cant wait to get you home  
  
I I cant read minds but I can read yours  
I think she says that she wants to pour your  
your yourself all over me  
What you think I could be wrong but peoples dont lie  
And if they do by God they must fry fry  
You know like electric chair  
The way you stare yeah Im there  
You committed a crime and Im the victim  
  
Ive got an eye out for she who cries out passionately  
Well do things backwardly forwardly horizontally  
Im too young to be settling down  
quick to change my mind tomorrow  
So now can I borrow your timid torso  
More so than your soul honest me gotta be how I roll  
Fuck the rhythm fuck the rhythm under your bosom  
Youre the prism Shirley Chislom  
Was the first lets rehearse making a baby  
Put in your order I want a baby daughter  
Dance on the tip of my tongue  
Shake the clouds til theres no more wetness in them  
Tell your home girls that you will send them  
A postcard from 3000 hard  
  
Chorus 2  
Dont want to make you feel strange but  
Dont let these words be in vain so  
Spread spread for me  
I cant I cant wait to get you home  
Nature knows that I want you but  
Not unless you want me too so  
Spread spread for me  
I cant I cant wait to get you home
