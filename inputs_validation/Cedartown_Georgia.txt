I got a gal in Cedartown Georgia I used to have to walk nearly three miles to
court her  
She never had much just a sharecroppers daughter  
But I married her and took her down to New Orleans  
Got a little house in the South French Quarter  
Got a job tookin bales load them on steamboat  
I give the seven days pay next day unbroke  
When she aint a sleepin all day shes a primpin  
  
Every evenin when the sun goes down she starts a swarmin on Orleans town  
Walkin into work this mornin at daybreak  
I caught her with the tall long dandy from canebreak  
As she walked right by me and she looked right through me  
  
I made up my mind what Im a gonna do eased in the pawnshop and bought a 22  
I watched as the roomclerk gave them a room key  
A standin right outside I could read Room 23  
Tonight Ill put her on a train for Georgia  
Gonna be a lotta kin folks squallin and a grieving  
Cause that Cedartown gal aint breathing
