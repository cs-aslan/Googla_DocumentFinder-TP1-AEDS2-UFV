I cant help myself but think of what youve done for me  
Day or night it seems that you are always on my mind  
And I know whenever I need you near  
I always feel that you will be there right by my side  
  
Your love runs deep within my soul and I cant let go  
Youll never leave me because I know  
That you are the one for me  
  
Youre the one who moves me  
Youre the one who sees right through me  
Youre the one I lean on every night and everyday  
Youre the one who makes feel a brand new life thats so unreal  
When I think of you and I you do  
Youre the one who moves me  
Moves me oh you move me you move me  
  
What I did without your love is a mystery  
Now I have you oh I dont wanna let you down  
Everyday it feels like a dream come true  
And I pray that you will always be around  
  
Your love runs deep within my soul and I cant let go  
Youll never leave me because I know  
That you are the one for me  
  
Youre the one who moves me  
Youre the one who sees right through me  
Youre the one I lean on every night and everyday  
Youre the one who makes me feel a brand new life thats so unreal  
When I think of you and I you do  
Youre the one that moves me  
  
When I am down and all alone  
You are the one who cares  
When I am weak you make me strong  
And I know that youll always be there yeah  
Moves me moves me  
  
Youre the one who moves me  
Youre the one who sees right through me  
Youre the one I lean on every night and everyday  
Youre the one who makes me feel a brand new life thats so unreal  
When I think of you and I you do  
Youre the one that moves me  
  
Youre the one who moves me  
Youre the one who sees right through me  
Youre the one I lean on every night and everyday  
Youre the one who makes me feel a brand new life thats so unreal  
When I think of you and I you do  
Youre the one that moves me
