I cant believe youre even trying this  
And the fact that you dont know what my power is  
On the battle field all the angels will fall  
And you cant hide behind your crumbling walls  
Evil dreams they try to pull you in  
But nows the time to pay for all your sins  
When its even way too late to repent  
So maybe your death is just heaven sent  
No shackles can hold me down  
You can never understand  
Youll never take my crown  
And all the power in my hands  
Forever I shall stay this way  
And youll never take whats mine away  
I just love when vengeance tastes so sweet  
I just love when you must taste defeat  
Now you know you must die by my blade  
Soon enough your soul will fade away  
It makes me laugh you even took your turn  
You cant be serious wont you ever learn  
Im the man that you can never take out  
Youve must forgotten what its all about  
Threw caution to the wind  
Are you really all that blind  
Committing ancient sins  
Are you really that behind  
We all have a cross to bear  
You can seek but never find  
Cant you feel the sadness there  
Did you loose your mind  
Now it seems that way to me  
Did you commit those crimes  
Open up your eyes and see  
Are you relly all so blind  
No wonder you were left behind again  
No shackles can hold me down  
You can never understand  
Youll never take my crown  
And all the power in my hands  
Forever I shall stay this way  
And youll never take whats mine away  
Did you loose your mind  
Now it seems that way to me  
Did you commit those crimes  
Open up your eyes and to see  
Are you really all so blind  
Will it ever set me free  
No wonder you w
