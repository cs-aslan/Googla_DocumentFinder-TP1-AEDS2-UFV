My warning meant nothing  
Youre dancing in quicksand  
Why dont you watch where youre wandering  
Why dont you watch where youre stumbling  
Youre wading knee deep and going in  
And you may never come back again  
This bog is thick and easy to get lost in  
When youre a stupid dumb ass belligerent fucker  
I hope it sucks you down  
Wander in and wandering  
No one even invited you in  
But still you stumble in stumbling  
So suffocate  
Or get out while you can  
No one told you to come  
I hope it sucks you down
