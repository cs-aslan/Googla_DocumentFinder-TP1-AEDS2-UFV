Oh yeah oh  
Oh yeah  
  
What good is the money  
When lately weve been missing each other  
Cause weve got work and kids you know how it goes  
Monday through Friday nine to five  
We spend most of the time chasing that dough  
  
But not tonight were gonna both get fly  
Call your momma tell her come over  
So we can have quality time  
Cause its been too long since I held you in my arms  
I cant wait no more Im ready to oooo  
  
You make me want to  
Do thangs do thangs them grown thangs  
Do thangs with you  
  
Tonight we gon forget our worries  
Put the kids to bed  
Im going out instead with you  
  
Steppin out with you  
Im steppin on out with you darling  
  
Girl put that celly down  
Dont even peek at your pager now  
Just chill relax the kids will be cool  
Grab two more Cosmos we aint thinkin about tomorrow  
Were in a club full of people  
But it feels just like me and you  
  
My babys looking hot tonight  
Catching everybodys eye  
Look at them starin but I aint carin  
Cause I know youre mine  
We should do this more often  
Got a fella feelin kinda flossy  
I cant wait to make your body go ooh ooh ooh  
  
You make me want to  
Do thangs do thangs them grown thangs  
Do thangs with you  
You make me want to  
Do thangs do thangs them grown thangs  
Do thangs with you  
  
You know how it goes  
Keep chasin that dough  
  
Ill ring the bell like I used to do  
Hold the door for you let you through  
Take your hand and talk to you  
Make you know youre my star  
Im gonna woo ya yeah yeah  
Say pretty words to ya yeah yeah  
Send chills right through ya oh yeah  
And remind you how loved you are
