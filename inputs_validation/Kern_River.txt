Chorus  
Ill never swim Kern River again  
It was there that I met him  
There that I lost my best friend  
Now I live in the mountains  
I drifted up here with the wind  
And I may drown in still water  
But Ill never swim Kern River again  
  
He grew up in an oil town  
But that gusher never came in  
And the river was a boundary  
Where my darling and I used to swim  
One night in the moonlight  
The swiftness swept his life away  
Now I live on Lake Shasta  
And Lake Shasta is where I will stay  
  
Theres the South San Joaquin  
Where the seeds of the dust bowl are found  
And theres a place called Mt Whitney  
From where the mighty Kern River comes down  
Now its not deep nor wide  
But its a mean piece of water my friend  
And I may cross on the highway  
But Ill never swim Kern River again  
  
Chorus x2  
  
No Ill never swim Kern River again
