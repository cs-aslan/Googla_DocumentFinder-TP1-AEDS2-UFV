Sonny wakes up in the morning feeling kinda sick  
Needs a little Stoli Vodka needs it really quick  
Sees a little blood run from his eyes  
Feels a little hotel paralyzed  
  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shotgive everyone a shot you gotta  
Pass the gun around  
And throw me in the local river let me float away  
  
I wake up watching cartoonsthe televisions on  
Theres a couple of party balloons and all my moneys gone  
She was just a reason to unwind  
And actually the last thing I could find  
  
Why dont you pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shotgive everyone a shot you better  
Pass the gun around  
And dump me in the local river let me float away  
float away ah float away  
  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shotgive everyone a shot why dont you  
Pass the gun around  
Throw me in the local river let me float away  
  
Sonny wakes up in the morning theres a stranger in his bed  
Someones pounding on the hotel door he wishes he was dead  
Ive had so many blackout nights before  
I dont think I can take this anymore  
  
Why dont you pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shotgive everyone a shot why dont you  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shotgive everyone a shot were gonna  
Pass the gun around  
  
Give everyone a shotgive everyone a shot were gonna  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shotgive everyone a shot you gotta  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shotgive everyone a shot you gotta  
Pass the gun around  
Give everyone a shotgive everyone a shot you gotta  
Pass the gun around
