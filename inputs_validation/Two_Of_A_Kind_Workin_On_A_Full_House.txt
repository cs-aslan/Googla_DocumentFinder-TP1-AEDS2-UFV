Yes shes my lady luck  
Hey Im her wild card man  
Together were buildin up a real hot hand  
We live out in the country  
Hey shes my little queen of the South  
Yeah were two of a kind  
Workin on a full house  
  
She wakes me every mornin  
With a smile and a kiss  
Her strong country lovin is hard to resist  
Shes my easy lovin woman  
Im her hard workin man no doubt  
Yeah were two of a kind  
Workin on a full house  
  
Yea a pickup truck is her limousine  
And her favorite dress is her faded blue jeans  
She loves me tender when the goin gets tough  
Sometimes we fight just so we can make up  
  
Lord I need that little woman  
Like the crops need the rain  
Shes my honeycomb and Im her sugar cane  
We really fit together  
If you know what Im talkin about  
Yeah were two of a kind  
Workin on a full house  
  
This time I found a keeper I made up my mind  
Lord the perfect combination is her heart and mine  
The skys the limit no hill is too steep  
Were playin for fun but were playin for keeps  
  
So draw the curtain honey  
Turn the lights down low  
Well find some country music on the radio  
Im yours and youre mine  
Hey thats what its all about  
Yeah were two of a kind  
Workin on a full house  
  
Lordy mama well be two of a kind  
Workin on a full house
