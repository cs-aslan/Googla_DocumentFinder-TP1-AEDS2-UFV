What do you think about your town since youve left and come back   
Its fantastic I was across the river from the club last night I never had
more fun in my life except sometimes in california I have more fun  
Do you plan to come back soon   
Oh  er er er I have no immediate plans ha ha ha  
Did you entertain in high school at the high school when you went back at
the high school   
Only when I walked down the aisles man no I did no I was er I was a
painter and a sort of a recluse in high school Ive changed  
What happened   
I got liberated I dont know I just started to sing and singing makes you
want to come out because painting I feel keeps you inside you know  and
once you start singing you just sort of wa  
O talk to people more and go out more and you know your lifestyles becomes
more a comeout flowout thing instead of a holditandbequiet type  
How were you different from your schoolmates when you were a teenager   
I dont know why dont you ask them   
Did they make you different   
No  
Otherwise were you different in comparison with them or were you   
I felt apart from them  
Did you take a part in football games   
I think not I didnt go to the high school prom and er   
Oh you were asked werent you   
No I wasnt I dont think I dont think they wanted to take me till Ill
be a hundred and sufferin its enough to make you wanna sing the blues
