Once I was young and so unsure  
Id try any ill to find the cure  
An old man told me  
Tryin to scold me  
Oh son dont wade to deep in Bitter Creek  
Bitter Creek  
Out where the desert meets the sky  
Is where I go when I want to hide  
  
Oh peyote ohpeyotemm  
She tried to show me  
tried to show me  
You know there aint no cause to weep  
at Bitter Creek  
Bitter Creek  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
Were gonna hit the road for one last time  
We can walk right in and steal em blind  
All that money All that moneyooh  
No more runnin No more runnin  
I cant wait to see the old mans face  
When I win the race  
Bitter Creek  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo doo  
Doo
