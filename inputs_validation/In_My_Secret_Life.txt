I saw you this morning  
You were moving so fast  
Cant seem to loosen my grip  
On the past  
And I miss you so much  
Theres no one in sight  
And were still making love  
In My Secret Life  
  
I smile when Im angry  
I cheat and I lie  
I do what I have to do  
To get by  
But I know what is wrong  
And I know what is right  
And Id die for the truth  
In My Secret Life  
  
Hold on hold on my brother  
My sister hold on tight  
I finally got my orders  
Ill be marching through the morning  
Marching through the night  
Moving cross the borders  
Of My Secret Life  
  
Looked through the paper  
Makes you want to cry  
Nobody cares if the people  
Live or die  
And the dealer wants you thinking  
That its either black or white  
Thank Gd its not that simple  
In My Secret Life  
  
I bite my lip  
I buy what Im told  
From the latest hit  
To the wisdom of old  
But Im always alone  
And my heart is like ice  
And its crowded and cold  
In My Secret Life
