You ask too much of me  
You try my patience  
Your tongue its like a razor  
You choose your words like weapons  
Here we go Battlestations  
  
I never have the guts to let you look inside  
I dont think youd appreciate the things that I hide  
  
Chorus  
Monday was the worst day  
And Friday wasnt my day  
But Wednesday was the best day  
Because on Wednesday night we made love  
All Im trying to give you is a good time honey  
Why dya have to keep on playing games with my head  
Used to be your baby when you had no money  
Now we spend more time in battle  
Than we ever do in bed  
Than we ever do in bed  
  
You dont know how much I hate that answer phone  
Are you standing there  
But you wont pick up the phone  
Why lie to my face  
When you can buy a tape machine to give me bullshit in your place  
  
Today I did something I thought Id never do  
I opened up your diary and read about you  
  
Chorus  
  
Monday was the worst day  
Wednesday we made love  
And Friday ooh but  
Saturday is today is what Im thinking of  
Come in baby come in close  
Take off your designer clothes  
cause you know what Im thinking of  
Do you remember me do you remember us  
Do you remember love  
  
All Im trying to give you is a good time honey  
Why dya have to keep on playing games with my head  
Used to be your baby when you had no money  
Now we spend more time in battle  
Than we ever do in bed  
Than we ever do in bed  
  
La premiere fois tu mas fait beaucoup rire  
Tu etais si mignon et tu jouais do piano  
Maintenant mon mellieur ami seeest largent  
Au revoir cheri  
Au revoir mon amour
