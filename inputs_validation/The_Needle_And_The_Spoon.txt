Thirty days Lord and thirty nights  
Im coming home on an airplane flight  
Mama waiting at the ticket line  
Tell me son why do you stand there cryin  
  
It was the needle and the spoon  
And a trip to the moon  
Took me away  
Took me away  
  
Ive been feeling so sick inside  
Got to get better Lord before I die  
Some doctors couldnt help my head they said  
Youd better quit son before youre dead  
  
Quit the needle quit the spoon  
Quit the trip to the moon  
They gonna take you away  
Lord they gonna take you away  
  
It was the needle and the spoon  
  
Ive seen a lot of people who thought they were cool  
But then again Lord Ive seen a lot of fools  
I hope you people Lord can hear what I say  
Youll have your chance to hit it some day  
  
Dont mess with a needle or a spoon  
Or a trip to the moon  
Theyll take you away  
  
Lord their gonna bury you boy  
Dont mess with the needle  
Now I know I know I know I know I know
