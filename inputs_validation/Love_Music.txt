I got my keyboard  
Symbols all ready  
Pull up the strings  
And leave the bottom all heavy  
Palms all sweaty  
This feels like a dream  
Little excited you know what I mean girl  
Girl Im in need for a woman that can play  
Knows how to turn it up loud  
Anytime of the day  
Take my cd and baby press repeat  
It aint no need to speak  
Just let it play  
  
Well you got my attention now  
I cant let you down  
Your lyrics and your sound  
Imagine me and you

But wait before the break down

And I just want to see you smile
