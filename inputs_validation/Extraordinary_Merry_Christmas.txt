It came into my dreams last night  
A great big man in red and white  
He told me that its gonna be  
A special year for you and me  
Underneath the mistletoe  
Hold me tight and kiss me slow  
The snow is high so come inside  
I wanna hear you say to me  
  
Its a very very merry merry Christmas  
Gonna party on til Santa grants my wishes  
Got my halo on I know what I want  
Its who Im with  
Its an extraordinary merry Christmas  
  
It doesnt come as a surprise  
Whos been naughty whos been nice  
Theres someone here for everyone  
Another year has just begun  
Silent night not inside  
Sleigh bells ring until the light  
Hearts explode here we go  
Its all like theyre inside your eyes  
  
Its a very very merry merry Christmas  
Gonna party on til Santa grants my wishes  
Got my halo on I know what I want  
Its who Im with  
Its an extraordinary merry Christmas  
  
Wont you meet me by the tree  
Slip away so secretly  
Cant you see how this could be  
The greatest gift of all  
Its a very very merry merry Christmas  
Gonna stay with you til Santa grants my wishes  
Got my halo on I know what I want  
Its who Im with  
Its an extraordinary merry very very merry merry Christmas  
Gonna party on til Santa grants my wishes  
Got my halo on I know what I want  
Its who Im with  
Its an extraordinary merry Christmas  
  
Its a very very merry merry Christmas  
Its an extraordinary merry Christmas
