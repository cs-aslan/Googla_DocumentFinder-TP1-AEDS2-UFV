Out for a thrill  
Got time to kill  
Just livin up my dreams  
for heavens sake  
  
Shes on the make  
A twisted vicars queen  
And then one night we took a ride  
She was all over me  
  
Outrageous  
Just aint real  
I was too wasted to see  
  
Before you get in too deep  
And you get burned by the heat  
Oh yeah  
Shell take you there  
You know it happened to me  
  
Shell make your heart break  
Shell give you fever  
Shell tell you everything but dont believe her  
A perfect stranger  
  
She knows the game  
Shell promise heaven on earth  
But dont believe her  
  
Out on the street of broken dreams  
Where no one ever wins  
Just when you thought youd made a start  
Youre back where you begin  
  
Before you get in too deep  
And you get burned by the heat  
Oh yeah  
Shell take you there  
I think you know what I mean  
  
Shell make you crazy  
Shes such a teaser  
Says youre the only one but dont believe her  
She deals in danger  
  
The girls insane  
Shell promise heaven on earth  
But dont believe her  
  
Before you get in too deep  
And you get burned by the heat  
Oh yeah  
Shell take you there  
You know it happened to me  
  
Dont believe her Dont believe her  
Dont believe her Dont believe her  
Dont believe her Dont believe her  
I cant believe her Dont believe her  
  
Shell make your heart break  
Shell give you fever  
Shell tell you everything but dont believe her  
A perfect stranger  
She knows the game  
Shell promise heaven on earth  
  
Shell make you crazy  
Shes such a teaser  
Says youre the only one but dont believe her  
She deals in danger  
  
The girls insane  
Shell promise heaven on earth  
But dont believe her  
  
Dont believe her  
Dont believe her  
Dont believe her  
Dont believe her
