You get me up then we both get down  
We roll all night makin heavy sounds  
Im all tied up on your bed  
Id rather be inside your head  
  
Dont do this do it like that oh yeah  
Youve hit the spot give it all you got  
I dont care  
  
Ill teach you a lesson  
That you wont forget  
Why dont you save your breath  
Cause Im gonna love ya to death  
  
Im comin to the point I cant hold back  
Then you ease off with your attack  
Youre the best Ive had if you please  
You never stop you great big tease  
  
Dont do this do it like that oh yeah  
Youve hit the spot give it all you got  
I dont care  
  
Ill teach you a lesson  
That you wont forget  
Why dont you save your breath  
Cause Im gonna love ya to death  
  
You can take me places I thought Id never go  
And when you turn your love on me  
Baby youre the star of the show  
  
You can take me places I thought Id never go  
And when you turn your love on me  
Baby youre the star of the show  
  
Ill teach you a lesson  
That you wont forget  
Why dont you save your breath  
Cause Im gonna love ya to death
