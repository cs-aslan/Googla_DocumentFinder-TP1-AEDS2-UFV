If everybody in the USA  
Could come with us to CalifornIa  
We could take em to a place out west  
Where the good sun shines everyday  
Now theres a touch o CalifornIa  
In everyone whos ever been this way  
And when your telephone begins to ring  
And the operator comes on the line  
California callin  
Ill be there right away  
Theres some beautiful women  
Gonna find me one  
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave  
Now Ive joined the surfin nation and so  
Ill take a permanent vacation and go  
To the golden shores of Frisco Bay  
Ill ride em all the way to Malibu  
And Ill take ya boogie boardin with me  
Cause when were surfin its so great to be free  
And when youre on a California beach  
You might even find em windsurfin too  
California callin  
Ill be there right away  
Theres some beautiful women  
Gonna find me one  
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave  
In the fifties it was Hey Daddy O  
Then came the surfers and the Hodads ya know  
We had our woodies and our custom cars  
And when we drove around we knew we were bad  
My baby listens to my car radio  
And when were cruisin lets the whole world know  
And when our favorite surfin song comes on  
We always let em know its Totally Rad  
California callin  
Ill be there right away  
Theres some beautiful women  
Gonna find me one  
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave  
California callin  
Shes still on the line  
Theres a beautiful woman  
Gonna show me how  
To ride em at the county line  
California callin  
Ill be there right away  
Theres some beautiful women  
Gonna find me one  
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave
