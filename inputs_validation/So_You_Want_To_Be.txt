So you want to be a rock n roll star  
Well listen now to what I say  
Get yourself an electric guitar  
And take some time and learn how to play  
  
And when your hairs combed right  
And your pants are tight its gonna be all right  
  
With time you go downtown  
To the agent man he wont let you down  
Sell your soul to the company  
Theyre all waiting there to sell plastic wares  
  
And in a week or two if you make the charts  
The girls will tear you apart  
  
What you pay for these riches and fame  
Well its all a vicious game youre a little insane  
What you get is the public acclaim  
Dont forget who you are youre a rock n roll star  
  
Na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na  
  
Hey you come here get up  
Ah this is the era where everybody creates  
Recognize my face They call me broken glass  
Thats because of the sounds Incomprehensible  
  
What you pay for all these riches and fame  
Well its all a vicious game youre a little insane  
Well youre a little insane oh a little insane  
Cause the thing that you gain is the public acclaim  
  
Dont forget who you are dont forget who you are  
Dont forget who you are youre a rock n roll star
