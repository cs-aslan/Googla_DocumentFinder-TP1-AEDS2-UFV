This is family business  
And this is for the family that cant be with us  
And this is for my cousin locked down know the answers in us  
Thats why I spit it in my songs so sweet  
Like a photo of your grannys picture  
Now that youre gone it hit us  
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas this cant be right  
Yeah you heard the track I did man this cant be life  
Somebody please say grace so I can save face  
And have a reason to cover my face  
I even made you a plate soul food know how Granny do it  
Monkey bread on the side know how the family do it  
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it  
As kids we used to laugh  
Who knew that life would move this fast  
Who knew Id have to look at you through a glass  
And look tell me you aint did it you aint did it  
And if you did then thats family business  
  
And I dont care bout all the all the diamond rings diamond rings  
They dont mean a thing all all all the things  
All these fancy things  
I tell you that all all the glitter Im waiting for  
Now all I know I know all these things  
  
This is family business  
And this is for everybody standin with us  
Come on lets take a family Grammy picture  
Abby remember when they aint believe in me  
Now she like See thats my cousin on TV  
Now we gettin it and we gon make it  
And yall gon hate it and Im his favorite  
I cant deny it Im a straight rider  
But when we get together be electric slidin  
Grandma get em shook up  
Aw naw dont open the photo book up  
I got an Aunt Ruth that cant remember your name  
But I bet them Polaroidsll send her down memory lane  
You know that one auntie you dont want to be rude  
But every holiday nobody eatin her food  
And you dont want to stay there cause them your worst cousins  
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins  
Act like you aint took a bath with your cousins  
Fit three in the bed while six of yall  
Im talkin bout three by the head and three by the leg  
But you aint have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed  
  
Rain rain rain go away  
Let the sun come out and all the children say  
Rain rain rain go away  
Let the sun come out and all the children say  
  
I woke up early this mornin with a new state of mind  
A creative way to rhyme without usin nines and guns  
Keep your nose out the sky keep your heart to God  
And keep your face to the risin sun  
All my niggas from the Chi thats my family dog  
And my niggas aint my guys they my family dog  
I feel like one day youll understand me dog  
You can still love your man and be manly dog  
You aint got to get heated at every house warmin  
Sittin here grillin people like George Foreman  
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin  
The second she storms out then he storms in  
Yall gon sit down have a good time this reunion  
And drink some wine like Communion  
And act like everything fine and if it isnt  
We aint lettin everybody in our family business  
  
All the all the diamond rings diamond rings  
They dont mean a thing all all all the things  
They dont mean a thing  
All the all the diamond rings diamond rings  
They dont mean a thing a thing  
  
And I dont care bout all the all the diamond rings diamond rings  
They dont mean a thing all all all the things  
All these fancy things  
I tell you that all all the glitter Im waiting for  
Now all I know I know all these things  
  
All these things
