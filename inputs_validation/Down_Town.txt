When youre alone  
And life is making you lonely  
You can always go  
Down town  
  
When youve got worries  
All the noise and the hurry  
Seems to hurt I know  
Down town  
  
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city  
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty  
How can you lose  
  
The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles forget all your cares  
  
And go down town  
Things will be great when youre  
Down town  
No finer place for sure  
Down town  
Everythings waiting for you  
  
Dont hang around  
And let your problems surround you  
There are movie shows  
Down town  
  
Maybe you know  
Some little places to go  
To where they never close  
Down town  
  
Just listen to the rhythm of the gentle bossanova  
Youll be dancing with them too before the night is over  
Happy again  
  
The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles forget all your cares  
  
And go down town  
Where all the lights are bright  
Down town  
Waiting for you tonight  
Down town  
Youre gonna be all right now  
  
And you may find  
Somebody kind  
To help and understand you  
Someone who is just like you  
And needs a gentle hand  
To guide him along  
  
So maybe Ill see you there  
We can forget all our troubles forget all our cares  
  
And go down town  
Things will be great when youre  
Down town  
Dont wait a minute more  
Down town  
Everythings waiting for you
