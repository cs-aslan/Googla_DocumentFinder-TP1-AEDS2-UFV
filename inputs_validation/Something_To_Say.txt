Ive got something to say  
And I just cant fucking hold it anymore  
It means more to me today  
Then it ever fucking did before  
Im a punk  
And Ive finally learned what it means to me  
It doesnt dictate who I am  
I define what the word means  
  
Cause I aint ever scared to say  
Im proud to be where I am today  
Always follow your dreams  
If I ever cared what people say  
I wouldnt be who I am today  
Be yourself to be free  
  
Use destruction  
Its the only way to pave salvation  
But dont forget creation  
Its the real history of this nation  
Hate and fear your government  
Because what they steal is your only covenant  
Love your land your nation  
But dont forget theres a whole world out there waiting  
  
Cause I aint ever scared to say  
Im proud to be where I am today  
Always follow your dreams  
If I ever cared what people say  
I wouldnt be who I am today  
Be yourself to be free  
  
Free  
  
Be yourself to be free  
Be yourself to be free  
Be yourself to be free  
Be yourself to be free  
  
Cause I aint ever scared to say  
Im proud to be where I am today  
Always follow your dreams  
If I ever cared what people say  
I wouldnt be who I am today  
Be yourself to be free
