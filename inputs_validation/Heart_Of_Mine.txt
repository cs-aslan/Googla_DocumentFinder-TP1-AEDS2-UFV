Heart of mine be still  
You can play with fire but youll get the bill  
Dont let him know dont let him know that you love him  
Oh dont be a fool dont be blind heart of mine  
Heart of mine go back home  
Youve got no reason to wander no reason to roam  
Dont let him see dont let him see that you need him  
Oh dont put yourself over the line heart of mine  
Heart of mine go back where youve been  
The only trouble for you is if you let him in  
Dont let him hear dont let him hear where youre going  
Oh untie the ties that bind heart of mine  
Heart of mine so malicious and so full of guile  
I give you an inch and you take a mile  
Dont let yourself fall dont let yourself stumble  
Oh do the time dont do the crime heart of mine  
Heart of mine  
Heart of mine
