Leave  
Me now  
Show  
Me how  
  
And I wont  
Be ashamed  
Of the things  
We once made  
And I wont be  
Comin back round here no more  
Yo  
  
Lead  
And try  
Tell  
Me why  
  
And I wont  
Let you down  
Drag your name  
All over town  
And I wont be  
Comin back round here no more  
Yo  
  
Yo everyone  
Everyone  
Everyone I know  
Everyone I know  
Take control  
  
Yeah  
  
And I wont  
Let you down  
Drag your name  
All over town  
And I wont be  
Comin back round here no more  
Yo  
  
Yo everyone  
Everyone  
Everyone I know  
Everyone I know  
Take control  
  
Whoaoh  
Whoaoh
