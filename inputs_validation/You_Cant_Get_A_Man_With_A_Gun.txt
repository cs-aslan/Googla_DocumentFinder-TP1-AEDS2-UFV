Oh my mother was frightened by a shotgun they say  
Thats why Im such a wonderful shot  
Id be out in the cactus and Id practice all day  
And now tell me what have I got  
Im quick on the trigger with targets not much bigger than a pinpoint  
Im number one but my score with a feller  
Is lower than a celler oh you cant get a man with a gun  
When Im with a pistol I sparkle like a crystal  
Yes I shine like the morning sun  
But I lose all my luster when with a bronco buster  
Oh you cant get a man with a gun  
With a guun with a guun oh you cant get a man with a gun  
If I went to battle with someones herd of cattle  
Youd have steak when the job was done  
But if I shot the herder theyd holler bloody murder  
And you cant shoot a male in the tail like a quail  
Oh you cant get a man with a gun  
Im cool brave and daring to see a lion glaring  
When Im out with my Remington  
But a look from a mister will raise a fever blister  
Oh you cant get a man with a gun  
The gals with umbrellas are always out with fellers  
In the rain or the blazin sun  
But a man never trifles with gals who carry rifles  
Oh you cant get a man with a gun  
With a guun with a guun oh you cant get a man with a gun  
A mans love is mighty hell even buy a nightie  
For a gal who he thinks is fun  
But they dont buy pajamas for pistol packin mamas  
And you cant get a hug from a mug with a slug  
Oh you cant get a man with a gun
