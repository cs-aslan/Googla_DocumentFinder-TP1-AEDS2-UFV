Silver lady lost in a haze  
Rregretting what you are  
The memory of your claim to fame  
Is left to bitter stars  
It hurts when people let you know  
Youre not a movie star  
Its harder now than yesterday  
As the lines begin to show  
Waiting crazy hotel lady  
To try and get some wine  
Waiting for the elevator  
To take you to your blind  
Silver shoes and seethrough blues  
Hit me right between the eyes  
Cocktail bars straightedge cars  
Are your dreams come true  
Tomorrow shouldnt know it  
But now its showin through and through  
It hurts when people let you know  
That youre not a movie star
