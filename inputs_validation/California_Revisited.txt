Heaven may be an answer  
If youre lookin for Eden in the sky  
On your waters I see a strange reflection  
Rumor has it Ill see you when I die  
Everyone I meet is from California  
Theres dancin in the streets in California  
In California you watch the shadow dancer  
Floating gently gently on the sea  
In California youre such a strange romancer  
Come and see me when the world has set you free  
Everyone I meet is from California  
Theres dancin in the streets in California  
Everyone I meet is from California  
Theres dancin in the streets in California
