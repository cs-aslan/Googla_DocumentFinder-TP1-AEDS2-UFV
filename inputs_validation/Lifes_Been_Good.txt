I have a mansion  
Forget the price  
Aint never been there  
They tell me its nice  
  
I live in hotels  
Tear out the walls  
I have accountants  
Pay for it all  
  
They say Im crazy but I have a good time  
Im just looking for clues at the scene of the crime  
Lifes been good to me so far  
  
My Maserati  
Does one eightyfive  
I lost my license  
Now I dont drive  
  
I have a limo  
Ride in the back  
I lock the doors  
In case Im attacked  
  
Im making records  
My fans they cant wait  
They write me letters  
Tell me Im great  
  
So I got me an office  
Gold records on the wall  
Ust leave a message  
Maybe Ill call  
  
Lucky Im sane after all Ive been through  
Everybody sing Im cool Hes cool  
I cant complain but sometimes I still do  
Lifes been good to me so far  
  
I go to parties  
Sometimes until four  
Its hard to leave  
When you cant find the door  
  
Its tough to handle  
This fortune and fame  
Everybodys so different  
I havent changed  
  
They say Im lazy but it takes all my time  
Everybody sing Oh yeah Oh yeah  
I keep on going guess Ill never know why  
Lifes been good to me so far baby
