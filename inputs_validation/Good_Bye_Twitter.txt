Yeah the rumors are true  
I deleted my Twitter  
Ha can you believe it  
I got 2 2 million  
Then I said adios  
I had to say goodbye  
And this little rap is to tell my fans why  
Huh uh  
  
No it wasnt because my friend told me to  
Yall know very well what you say I dont do  
And the reasons are simple  
I started tweetin bout pimples  
I stopped livin for moments  
And started livin for people  
  
Yeah you right whatcha doin  
But who really cares  
If Im playin with Noah or just doin my hair  
Everything that I type  
And everything that I do  
All those lame gossip sites  
Take it and they make it news  
I want my private life private  
Im done trying to please  
I aint livin for tabliods  
No Im livin for me  
No more emo quotes  
And fake feuds with Demi  
Yeah Im done with all that  
And the truth is Im too busy  
  
Yeah I gotta admit  
I miss Dane Cooks tweets  
And I really liked looking at Katy Perry and Britney  
I might have some withdraws  
I was a little obsessed  
But Im peacin out  
And Im leaving with this  
Ha goodbye  
Ah ah goodbye
