Sophisticated lady tryn to change my ways  
Just because youre caught in your social maze  
I think its about time that you realize  
Your money and your powers got you mesmerized  
Pretty lady  
Get back  
Pretty lady  
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on  
Youre anybodys baby when your mamas gone  
  
Educated lady with your college degree  
Amazes me why you just cant see  
Learned evrything from your books on the shelf  
But no one ever taught you how to think for yourself  
  
Pretty lady  
Get back  
Pretty lady  
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on  
Youre anybodys baby when your mamas gone  
  
Sophisticated lady  take a lesson from me  
I can help you be what you want to be  
Together well see many brighter days  
If it takes forever gonna change your ways pretty lady  
Sweet thing  
Pretty lady  
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on  
Youre anybodys baby when your mamas gone
