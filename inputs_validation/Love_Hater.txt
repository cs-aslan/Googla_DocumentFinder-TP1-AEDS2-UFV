Everybody needs a glass of water today to chase the hate away  
You know youve got company coming over so you scrub extra hard  
And everybody needs somebody to love before its too lateits too late  
Dont nobody want to grow older right  
Everybody needs someone to rub their shoulders scratch their dandruff  
And everybody needs to quit actin hard and shit  
Before you get your ass whooped Ill slap the fuck outta ya  
Everybody needs somebody to love before its too lateits too late  
  
Love Hater Love Hater  
Hater of Love  
Love Hater Love Hater  
Hater of Love  
Love Hater  
Everybody needs someone to love Repeat x2
