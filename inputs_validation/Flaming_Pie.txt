Making love underneath the bed  
Shooting stars from a purple sky  
I dont care how I do it  
Im the man on the flaming pie  
  
Stick my tongue out and lick my nose  
Tuck my shirt in and zip my fly  
Go ahead have a vision  
Im the man on the flaming pie  
  
Everything I do has a simple explanation  
When Im with you you could do with a vacation  
I took my brains out and stretched em on a rack  
Now Im not so sure Im ever gonna get em back  
  
Cut my toes off to spite my feet  
I dont know whether to laugh or cry  
Never mind check my rhythm  
Im the man on the flaming pie  
  
Im the man on the flaming pie  
Everything I do has a simple explanation  
When Im with you you could do with a vacation  
I took my brains out and stretched em on a rack  
Now Im not so sure Im ever gonna get em back
