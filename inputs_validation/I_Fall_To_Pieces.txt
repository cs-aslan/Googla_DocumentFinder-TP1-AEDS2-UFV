You walk by and I fall to pieces  
I fall to pieces each time I see you again  
I fall to pieces how can I be just your friend  
You want me to act like weve never kissed  
You want me to forget pretend weve never met  
Oh Ive tried and Ive tried but I havent yet you walk by and I fall to
pieces  
  
I fall to pieces each time someone speaks your name  
I fall to pieces time only adds to the flame  
You want me to find someone else to love  
Someone wholl love me too the way you used to do  
But each time I go out with someone new you walk by and I fall to pieces  
You walk by and I fall to pieces
