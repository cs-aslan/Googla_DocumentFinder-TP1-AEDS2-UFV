I am overground and  
Outselling it  
Since god thinks I dont exist  
The beatings happen per minute  
This is not  
Bluecollarwhitecorrective politics  
Im on a hate American style  
Kick  
  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
come on come on  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
come on come on  
  
Im on a campaign for pain  
And when I get elected  
Ill wipe the white of your house  
The smile off your face  
  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
come on come on  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
come on come on  
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  
I dont want to be like anyone else  
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  
I dont want to even be myself  
  
I said no this isnt your song  
We cant all get along  
Its too hard to hold hands when  
Your hands a fist  
My hatepop wont ever stop  
Im fucking glad were different  
This is my hate american style  
Hit  
  
Dont bring dont sing it  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
come on come on  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
come on come on  
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  
I dont want to be like anyone else  
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  
I dont want to even be myself
