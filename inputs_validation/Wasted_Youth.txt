Wasted Youth  
Wasted Youth  
I remember everything  
I remember everything little thing as if it happened yesterday  
I was barely seventeen and I once killed a boy with a Fender Guitar  
I dont remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster  
But I do remember that it had a heart of chrome and a voice like a horny
angel  
I dont remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster  
But I do remember that it wasnt at all easy  
  
It required the perfect combination of the right power chords  
And the precise angle from which to strike  
  
The guitar bled for about a week afterwords  
And the blood was zoot dark and rich like wild berrys  
The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red  
The guitar bled for about a week afterwords  
But it rung out beautifully  
And I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before  
  
So I took my guitar  
And I smashed it against the wall  
I smashed it against the floor  
I smashed it against the body of a varsity cheerleader  
Smashed it against the hood of a car  
Smashed it against a 1981 HarleyDavidson  
The Harley howled in pain  
The guitar howled in heat  
  
And I ran up the stairs to my parents bedroom  
Mommy and Daddy were sleeping in the moonlight  
Slowly I opened the door  
Creeping in the shadows right up to the foot of their bed  
I raised the guitar high above my head  
And just as I was about to bring the guitar crashing down upon the center of
the bed  
My father woke up screaming Stop  
Wait a minute Stop it boy What do you think your doing  
Thats no way to treat an expensive musical instrument  
And I said God Damn It daddy  
You know I love you But youve got a hell of a lot to learn about Rock n
Roll
