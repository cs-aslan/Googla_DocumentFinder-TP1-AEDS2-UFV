I walk the street at night  
until the morning light comes shining through  
Cant get a good nights sleep  
aint been to work in weeks  
  
What am I gonna do  
Help me  
  
Cant get her off my mind  
Im drinking too much wine  
Im burning up inside  
If I could touch her face  
or take her out some place Id be satisfied  
  
Hey Im a loaded gun  
Im crazy about her crazy about her  
Hey Im a lovesick son  
Im crazy about her  
  
I see her jogging in Central Park  
with one of them Walkmans on her head  
She was hot young beautiful  
and I said to myself  
shes destined to be mine  
  
I see her every day  
in rush hour or subway in a grocery store  
She dont notice me  
I might as well just be a crockroach on the floor  
  
If she belonged to me Id give her everything  
Id never cheat or lie  
I treat her with respect not just a sex object  
I aint that kind of guy  
  
Hey Im a loaded gun  
Im crazy about her crazy about her  
Hey Im a lovesick son  
Im crazy about her  
  
I was standing outside the Met one day  
when she drove by in a black Corvette  
I said Hey baby  
I couldve died she looked straight through me  
But I know shes destined to be mine  
  
Every night I stand around her door and wait for her to come by  
She lives in one of those brownstones with the guard outside  
and the limousines and the Rolls Royces comin and goin  
  
My friends all say shes way outta my class  
but I know if shed just get know me  
I could give her something all those rich guys aint got  
  
Aint gonna bide my time aint gonna stand in line  
Somebody gonna get burned  
But oh the problem is I think my loves at risk  
Shes the bosss girl  
Oh no  
  
Hey Im a loaded gun  
Im crazy about her crazy about her  
Hey Im a lovesick son  
Im crazy about her
