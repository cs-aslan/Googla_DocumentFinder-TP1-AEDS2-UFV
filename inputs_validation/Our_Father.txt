Our Father which art in heaven  
Im so grateful  
Of all the beautiful things  
That you are allowing me to see  
Birds bees  
The ability to do what I do  
The opportunities  
I know you love me now  
And I think its time  
And my dutyto tell the world Jesus is my daddy Im tellin youoh  
  
Dont let me fall  
You watch for who Im friends with  
I got tattoos you forgive me  
You know Im so sensitive  
You know Im chased by women  
You know mt mind is drivin  
To you my heart is givin oowww  
  
Chorus  
Youre the greatest  
Youre the greatest wow wow  
Youre the greatest Jesus is my daddy Im telling you

Dont let me fall  
  
They dont understand  
What you do for me do foe me  
And nothing by my actions  
They dont I believe I believe  
Not talking bout what I wear  
When I drivin where I sleep  
I mean the ability to hear feel and sleep  
  
Chorus  
  
Thank you for my brothers
