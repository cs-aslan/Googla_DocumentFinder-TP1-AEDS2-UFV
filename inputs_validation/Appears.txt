Cracked phone line  
Means nothing  
My brains in fights and vain  
My breathing  
So shallow  
It helps to curb the pain  
  
Whats outside  
Sneaks inside  
How we contaminate  
This warzone of my soul  
I underestimate  
  
Chorus  
Ive never really thought about it that much  
Its only ever violence thats in my touch  
Appears appears appears  
I am built this way  
Appears appears appears  
I am built this way  
  
The pills they quit working  
They take more than they give  
Emotions on flat line  
Its all that I can give  
  
The rising  
The falling  
My mind keeps tricking me  
It throws me a life raft  
Then leaves me out at sea  
  
Ive never really thought about it that much  
Its only ever violence thats in my touch  
Appears appears appears  
I am built this way  
Appears appears appears  
I am built this way  
  
Ive never really thought about it that much  
Its only ever violence thats in my touch  
Appears appears appears  
I am built this way  
Appears appears appears  
I am built this way
