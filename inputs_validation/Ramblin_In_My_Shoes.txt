Sometimes I wake up  
And drag my sorry ass out of bed  
Sometimes I dont  
And I just lay there instead  
Im going down to the store today  
And hope my cold sores all go away  
Sometimes I just put on my socks  
  
Chorus  
Well Im Ramblin in my shoes  
Im ramblin in my shoes  
Im aramblin in my shoes  
Cause I got a hole in my socks  
  
Sometimes I wet the bed  
And lie in my own filth  
Sometimes I dont  
I get up and go to the bathroom  
Im going down to the store today  
And hope my cold sores all go away  
Sometimes I just go barefooted  
  
Chorus 4x
