Work ourselves fingers to the bone  
Suck the marrow drain my soul  
Fingers to the bone  
Pay your dues and your debts  
Pay your respects everybody tells you  
You pay for what you get  
You pay for what you get  
  
Everybody asks me how shes doin  
Has she really lost her mind  
I said I couldnt tell you  
Ive lost mine  
  
Words words words have you heard  
A bird in hand is much better than  
Any number free to wander  
Fly awaystay  
You pay for what you get  
You pay for what you get  
  
Everybody asks me how shes doing  
Is she really all she says  
Everybody asks me how shes doing  
Since she went away  
I said I couldnt tell you  
Im OK Im OK Im OK  
  
Surprise surprise  
You pay for what you get  
You pay for what you get  
  
Everybody asks me how shes doing  
Has she really lost her  
Everybody asks me how shes doing  
Since she went away  
I said I couldnt tell you  
Im OK Im OK Im OK How are you  
  
Pay for what you get  
Pay for what you getoh  
Pay for what you get  
Pay for what you get oh  
Oh
