Pardon me  
But you see  
Ive seen that face before  
I know those eyes  
Unearthly wise  
I feel it more and more  
To look at you  
Deja vu  
Chills me to the core  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
But that only confused me  
Said I dont stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
And that frankly amused me  
So lets drink a few  
Heres lookin at you I swear  
Didnt we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere  
Didnt we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere  
  
Gradually  
I can see  
Things are getting clear  
That ageless face  
Satanic grace  
This sudden rush of fear  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
Now they got me believin  
Said I dont stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
So Id better be leavin  
So lets drink a few  
Heres lookin at you I swear  
Didnt we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere  
  
Here I am  
Doors been slammed  
Theyre gonna roast my hide  
Make me bleed  
Til I plead  
For you to let me die  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
Now they got me believin  
Said I dont stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
God I wish Id believed them  
So lets drink a few  
Heres lookin at you I swear  
Didnt we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere  
Didnt we meet  
In the night in my sleep  
Didnt we meet  
In the night in my sleep  
Somewhere
