Out on the wiley windy moors  
Wed roll and fall in green  
You had a temper like my jealousy  
Too hot too greedy  
How could you leave me  
When I needed to possess you  
I hated you I loved you too  
  
Bad dreams in the night  
They told me I was going to lose the fight  
Leave behind my wuthering wuthering  
Wuthering Heights  
  
Heathcliff its me your Cathy  
Ive come home Im so cold  
Let me inayour window  
  
Heathcliff its me your Cathy  
Ive come home Im so cold  
Let me inayour window  
  
Ooh it gets dark It gets lonely  
On the other side from you  
I pine a lot I find the lot  
Falls through without you  
Im coming back love  
Cruel Heathcliff my one dream  
My only master  
  
Too long I roam in the night  
Im coming back to his side to put it right  
Im coming home to wuthering wuthering  
Wuthering Heights  
  
Heathcliff its me your Cathy  
Ive come home Im so cold  
Let me inayour window  
  
Heathcliff its me your Cathy  
Ive come home Im so cold  
Let me inayour window  
  
Ooh Let me have it  
Let me grab your soul away  
Ooh Let me have it  
Let me grab your soul away  
You know its me Cathy  
  
Heathcliff its me your Cathy  
Ive come home Im so cold  
Let me inayour window  
  
Heathcliff its me your Cathy  
Ive come home Im so cold  
Let me inayour window  
  
Heathcliff its me your Cathy  
Ive come home Im so cold
