I left my street  
Im a guillotine  
Pulling away  
In my machine  
Where have I been now  
Not you  
  
Shooting stars in my left arm  
An alcohol low  
Giving away time to Casio  
Sun is slow  
I got soul  
  
Is this where Im going to  
Well see  
Well see  
Well see  
  
I kill this sleep  
Im the man in the moon  
Walking on sand on my home high noon  
In love with the moon love you  
  
Cause I lift my Street  
Im a guillotine  
Pull it away  
In my machine  
Forget where Ive been before  
Forget you  
  
Is this where Im going to  
Well see  
Well see  
Well see
