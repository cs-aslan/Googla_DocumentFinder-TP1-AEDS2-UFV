Chorus  
Are we growing up or just going down  
Its just a matter of time until were all found out  
Take our tears and put them on ice  
Cause I swear Id burn this city down to show you the light  
  
Were the therapists pumping through your speakers  
Delivering just what you need  
Were well read and poised  
Were the best boys  
Were the chemists whove found the formula  
To make your heart swell and burst  
No matter what they say dont believe a word  
  
Cause Ill keep singing this lie if youll keep believing it  
Ill keep singing this lie  
Ill keep singing this lie  
  
Chorus  
  
Were traveled like gypsies  
Only with worse luck and far less gold  
The kids you used to love  
But then we grew old  
Were the lifers here til the bitter end  
Condemned from the start  
Ashamed of the way  
The songs and the words own the beating of our hearts  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a drug in the thermostat to warm the room up  
And another around to help us bend your trust  
Ive got a sunset in my veins  
And I need to take a pill to make this town feel okay  
  
Repeat x2  
The best part of believe is the lie  
I hope you sing along and you steal a line  
I need to keep you like this in my mind  
So give in or just give up  
  
Are we growing up or just going down  
  
Chorus
