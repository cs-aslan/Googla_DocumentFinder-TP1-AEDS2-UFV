Oh can you take of her  
Oh maybe you can spare her  
  
Several moments of your consideration  
Leading up to the final destination  
  
Oh the earth is calling out  
I wanna learn what its all about  
But everything I read global warming going green  
I dont know what all this means but it seems to be saying  
  
Chorus  
  
Wake up America were all in this together  
Its our home so lets take care of it  
You know that you want to  
You know that you got to wake up America  
Tomorrow becomes a new day and everything you do  
Matters yeah everything you do matters in some way  
  
Stand up Ill try if you will  
Wake up its not a fire drill  
All she needs is a little attention  
Can you give her just a little attention  
  
Uh oh its easy to look away  
But its getting harder day by day  
  
Everything I read global warming going green  
I dont know what all this means but it seems to be saying  
  
Chorus  
  
Wake up America were all in this together  
Its our home so lets take care of it  
You know that you want to  
You know that you got to wake up America  
Tomorrow becomes a new day and everything you do  
Matters yeah everything you do matters in some way  
  
I know that you dont want to hear it  
Especially coming from someone so young  
  
But in the back seat yeah they want to hear it they want to hear it  
  
So come on turn in up  
Come on turn it up  
So come oooooooon turn it up  
  
Chorus  
  
Wake up America were all in this together  
Its our home so lets take care of it  
You know that you want to  
You know that you got to wake up America  
Tomorrow becomes a new day and everything you do  
Matters yeah everything you do matters in some way
