You could throw me  
In the fire  
And I wont be burned  
For my faith  
Is Your desire  
And Your love endures  
  
You could throw me  
In the prison cell  
Shackle me up  
Against the rail  
But time  
And time again  
My faith wont fail  
  
Chorus  
For Hell prevail  
In the midst of all  
My trials  
And tribulations  
And Hell prevail  
In the midst of all  
My sin  
And temptations  
Hell prevail  
When I fall  
And He  
Will pick me up  
For time  
And time again  
My faith wont fail  
Time and time again  
My faith wont fail  
  
You could cast me  
In the lions den  
But they wont harm me  
For Your grace  
Surrounds me  
And it sets me free  
  
And I can walk  
Upon the water  
And I will not drown  
For my eyes are  
Set upon You  
And no one  
Can bring me down  
  
For His angels  
Surround me  
And Youve poured out  
This blood covering  
And I will walk  
And not fail  
For time  
And time again  
My faith wont fail  
Time  
And time again  
My faith wont fail
