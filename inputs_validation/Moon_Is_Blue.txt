When the light shines down  
And time goes slowly  
When my minds in the dust  
Spoilt and dying  
  
Theres a pain in my hand  
Inscribed to the sad and lonely  
Ive been so cold and alone thinkin how long  
  
Now if you had told me she would come back  
And if you had told me the clock was gonna fall  
If you had shown me some affection  
I would have believed you  
  
Dont tell me the moon is blue  
Cos tonight its over now the pains in the dust  
And you cant find your blue moon  
Its over ooh tonight its over  
  
And yeah you been bad  
So why did I still want you to hold me  
My tears of broken glass thinkin ho wlong  
  
The blade was a sharp one  
That cut me both ways and tore my world apart  
Now I could have healed that wound so deep  
But you wouldnt understand  
  
Dont tell me the moon is blue  
Cos tonight its over now the pains in the dust  
And you cant find your blue moon  
Its over ooh tonight its over  
  
Dont you know that you hurt me so You  
  
Dont tell me the moon is blue cos tonight its over  
Now the pains in the dust  
And you cant find your blue moon  
Its over ooh tonight its over
