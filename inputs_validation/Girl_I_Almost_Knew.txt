Ill only miss your tears in my eyes  
A tear thats been a prisoner way to long  
The fool thats made excuses for your lies  
Now confessin the love hes never known  
  
Youre the girl who almost gave heart to me  
Youre the girl who almost made my dreams come true  
Forever in my mind therell be a memory  
Of a stranger the girl I almost knew  
  
Each day I told myself youll change tomorrow  
For a fool in love will hide whats right or wrong  
Behind my back you planted seeds with sorry  
And they grew till the hurt became full grown  
  
Youre the girl who almost gave heart to me  
Youre the girl who almost made my dreams come true  
Forever in my mind therell be a memory  
Of a stranger the girl I almost knew
