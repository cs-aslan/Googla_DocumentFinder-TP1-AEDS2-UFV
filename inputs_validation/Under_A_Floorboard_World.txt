I got your secret  
And I sure aint gonna keep it  
Ive got your secret  
And I sure aint gonna keep it  
Im in the know  
And I sure do mean to reap it  
I got your secret  
And I sure aint gonna keep it  
Under a floorboard world  
Under a floorboard world  
Ooh oooh  
I got your secret  
And I sure aint gonna keep it  
I got your secret  
And I sure aint gonna keep it  
Im in the know  
And I sure do mean to reap it  
I got your secret  
And I sure aint gonna keep it  
Under a floorboard world  
Under a floorboard world  
Under a floorboard world  
Under a floorboard world  
Ooh oooh
