As I look him deep in the eyes  
I see only darkness  
I must have knocked him out good  
I kind of like that  
I must go  
  
Up Up Up from the grave  
Up Up Up from the grave  
Up Up Up from the grave  
Up Up Up from the grave  
  
Here we go again my friend  
deep into my twisted brain  
I think Im losing it again  
  
LaLaLa  
Im digging for Lucy dear  
LaLaLa  
Ive had it up to here  
  
Lucy Lucy I am here Lucy Lucy dont you fear  
I will get you out of there so you can breathe again  
You cant sleep forever dear  
Come to daddy  
  
Up Up Up from the grave  
Up Up Up from the grave  
Up Up Up from the grave  
Up Up Up from the grave  
  
Here we go again my friend  
deep into my twisted brain  
I think Im losing it again  
  
LaLaLa  
Tell me what you see  
LaLaLa  
Tell me how it makes you feel  
  
When I sing so nicely to you Luyoucy
