Its only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself  
Its only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself  
Something beautiful is happening inside for me  
Something sensual its full of fire and mystery  
I feel hypnotized I feel paralyzed  
I have found heaven  
Theres a thousand reasons  
Why I shouldnt spend my time with you  
For every reason not to be here I can think of two  
Keep me hanging on  
Feeling nothings wrong  
Inside your heaven  
Its only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself  
Its only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself  
I can feel the emptiness inside me fade and disappear  
Theres a feeling of contentment now that you are here  
I feel satisfied  
I belong inside  
Your velvet heaven  
Did I need to sell my soul  
For pleasure like this  
Did I have to lose control  
To treasure your kiss  
Did I need to place my heart  
In the palm of your hand  
Before I could even start  
To understand  
Its only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself  
Its only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself
