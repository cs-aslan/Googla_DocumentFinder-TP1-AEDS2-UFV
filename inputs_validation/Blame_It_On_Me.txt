My babys got this set of jet black eyes  
I swear that girls the devil in disguise  
  
Ive been  
Let down  
Burned out  
So let me tell you what Im talking about  
  
Ive been  
Chastised  
Deprived  
Shes got my skull filled with sentimental lies  
  
Shes no good for me  
So Im gonna set her free  
Im gonna let you fly  
Bye bye so long my sweet baby  
  
Chorus  
Me my love  
Blame it on me  
Me my love  
Say it was me now  
Me my love  
Step back dont jack me up now  
Please my love  
Blame it on me  
  
My girl shes got this jet black hair  
When she walks heads stop rotate and stare  
  
Ive been  
Let down  
Locked out  
So let me tell you what shes all about  
  
Theres  
Black lies  
Fake cries  
Shes got this bag filled with sentimental lies  
  
Shes no good for me  
So Im gonna set her free  
Im gonna let you fly  
Bye bye so long my sweet baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey I know Im wrong  
So Ill go home  
Make me believe  
Believe dont tease me please now  
  
Chrorus
