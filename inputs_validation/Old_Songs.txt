Candles burning  
Glasses are chilled  
And soon shell be by  
  
Hope and pray shell say that shes willing  
To give us another try  
  
And if all these plans i made  
Dont melt the ladys heart  
Ill put on the old fortyfives  
  
And maybe the old songs  
Will bring back the old times  
Maybe the old lines will sound new  
Maybe shell lay her head on my shoulder  
Maybe old feelings will some through  
Maybe well start to cry  
And wonder why we ever walked away  
  
Maybe the old songs  
Will bring back the old times  
And make her want to stay oh oh  
  
Its been too long without  
Seeing her face light up  
When I come home  
Been to many hours Ive waited  
Staring at the phone  
  
Sweet old songs Im counting on you  
Bring her back to me  
Im tired of listening alone  
  
Maybe the old songs  
Will bring back the old times  
Maybe the old lines will sound new  
Maybe shell lay her head on my shoulder  
Maybe old feelings will some through  
Maybe well start to cry  
And wonder why we ever walked away  
  
Maybe the old songs  
Will bring back the old times  
And make her want to stay oh oh  
  
And make her want to stay
