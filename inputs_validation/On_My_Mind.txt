Verse 1  
Its a little blurry how the whole thing started  
I dont even really know what you intended  
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous  
Poured it down so I poured it down  
Next thing that I know Im in a hotel with you  
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you  
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos  
Poured it down so I poured it down  
  
PreChorus 1  
And now I dont understand it  
You dont mess with love you mess with the truth  
And I know I shouldnt say it  
But my heart dont understand  
  
Chorus 1  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind

Verse 2  
I always hear always hear them talking  
Talking bout a girl bout a girl with money  
Saying that I hurt you but I still dont get it  
You didnt love me no not really  
Wait

Ill bet Ill bet thats why I keep on thinking bout you  
Its a shame shame you said I was good  
So I poured it down so I poured it down

But my heart dont understand
