Now we can say that nothings lost and only change brings round the prophecy  
Where now its melting the solid frost was once a veil on greener landscapes
we would see  
Beneath my surface the waters heating  
And steam comes up and out the tears you see me shine  
For every strange and bitter moment there was never a better time  
  
For every pleasure exacts its pain  
How you hurt me how you were good to me  
Beneath my window a mournful train that makes me smile at my bad poetry  
Beneath my surface a song is rising  
It may be simple while it hides its true intent  
We may be looking for our deliverance but it has already been sent  
  
Its in the night fall when the light falls  
And what youve seen isnt there anymore  
Its in our blind trust that love will find us  
Just like it has before  
  
Theyre sending soldiers to distant places  
Xs and Os on someones drawing board  
Like green and plastic but with human faces  
And they want to tell you its a merciful sword  
  
But with all the blood newly dried in the desert  
Can we not fertilize the land with something else  
There is no nation by god exempted  
Lay down your weapons and love your neighbor as yourself  
  
In the night fall when the light falls  
And what youve seen isnt there anymore  
Its through our blind trust that love will find us  
Just like it has before
