Where the road is dark  
And the seat is soaked  
Where the gun is cocked  
And the bullets cold  
Where the miles are marked in blood and gold  
Ill meet you further on up the road  
  
Got on my dead mans suit  
And my smilin skull ring  
My lucky graveyard boots  
And a song to sing  
I got a song to sing keep me out of the cold  
And Ill meet you further on up the road  
  
Further on up the road  
Further on up the road  
Where the way is dark  
And the night is cold  
But one sunny morning well rise I know  
And Ill meet you further on up the road  
  
Well I been out in the desert  
Was doin my time  
Searching through the dust  
Looking for a sign  
If theres a light up ahead  
Well buddy I dont know  
But I got this fever  
Burning in my soul  
So lets take the good times as they come  
And Ill meet you further on up the road  
  
Further on up the road  
Further on up the road  
Where the way is dark  
And the night is cold  
One sunny morning well rise I know  
And Ill meet you further on up the road  
One sunny morning well rise I know  
And Ill meet you further on up the road  
Yeah Ill meet you further on up the road  
Well Ill meet you further on up the road
