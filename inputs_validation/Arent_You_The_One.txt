Arent you the one who used to call me names  
Arent you the one who used to play me games  
Werent you the one who said hed never fall  
Now youre the one whos crying not so tall  
  
Oh I know what its like  
Its happened many times to me  
Oh do you ache inside  
Your eyes wanna cry  
You want me back again  
  
Yes youre the one  
Should I throw you a crumb  
Should I come and pass you by  
Would that make you wanna try  
Should I come and kiss your lips  
Would that make your game slip  
Shall I come and dry your eyes  
Would that make you realize  
  
Oh I know what its like  
Its happened many times to me  
Oh do you ache inside  
Your eyes wanna cry  
You want me back again  
  
Arent you the one who used to call me names  
Arent you the one who used to play me games  
Werent you the one who used to run and hide  
Now youre the one whos crying way inside  
  
Oh I know what its like  
Its happened many times to me  
Oh do you ache inside  
Your eyes wanna cry  
You want me back again
