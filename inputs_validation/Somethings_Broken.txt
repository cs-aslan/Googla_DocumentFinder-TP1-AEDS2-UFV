Think somethings broken then again nothins smokin  
Or shakin or chokin like my ol truck  
But I think somethings broken  
And I think its worth notin  
It started about the time  
She got all packed up  
  
Could be my ego could be my pride  
Or maybe my clam cool collective side  
Might be my heart comin eye to eye  
With the truth that she wasnt jokin  
  
Think somethings broken  
Cause Im just layin round hopin  
That maybe any moment  
Ill get on track  
But I think somethings broken  
All locked up or frozen cause I cant go forward  
And I sure cant go back  
  
Could be my ego could be my pride  
Or maybe my clam cool collective side  
Might be my heart comin eye to eye  
With the truth that she wasnt jokin  
  
Think its my heart  
Comin eye to eye  
With the truth  
She wasnt jokin  
  
I know somethings broken  
I Just started smokin  
And shakinand chokin  
Like my old truck
