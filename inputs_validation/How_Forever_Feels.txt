Big orange ball sinkin in the water  
Toes in the sand couldnt get much hotter  
Little umbrella shaped margaritas  
Coconut oil tan senioritas  
Now I know how Jimmy Buffet feels  
  
Hands on the wheel cruisin down the interstate  
Gas pedal sticks carries my car away  
I was going fast as a Rambler goes  
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes  
Now I know how Richard Petty feels  
  
Ive been around the block a time or two  
Done almost everything a boy can do  
Ive done some livin yeah Ive had fun  
But there is one thing that I havent done  
  
Saved two months bought a little diamond  
Tonights the night feels like perfect timin  
Down on one knee on mommas front steps  
Man Im gonna die if she really says yes  
  
I want to know how forever feels  
  
Ive been around the block a time or two  
Done almost everything a boy can do  
Ive done some livin yeah Ive had fun  
But there is one thing that I havent done  
  
I want to know how forever feels  
Hey I want to know how forever feels  
Girl I want to know how forever feels
