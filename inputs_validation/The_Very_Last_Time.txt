Sometimes I wonder if Im still alive  
How much abuse can someone stand and survive  
How long Ive waited for this day to arrive  
When I wont be a fool no more  
Nobody knows how you push me around  
Nobody sees how you treat me like Im your clown  
I never made a sound  
Its the very last time you will get on my case  
Its the very last time cause  
I wont be a fool no more  
Its the very last time you will step on my face  
Its the very last time cause  
I wont be a fool no more  
I still remember the look in your eyes  
Just a reflection of the things you despise  
But sooner or later Ive got to get wise  
And I wont be a fool no more  
Nobody sees how you treat me like dirt  
Nobody knows just how badly a man can hurt  
Youve got a lesson to learn  
I can still feel the sting of your words  
But I wont cry no matter how much it hurts  
My head may go crazy my heart it may burst  
But I wont be a fool no more  
No I wont be a fool no more
