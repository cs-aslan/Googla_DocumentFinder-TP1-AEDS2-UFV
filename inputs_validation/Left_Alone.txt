You made your made your overtures  
When you were a chauvend overtoned mutt  
And I was still a dewy petal  
Rather than a moribund slut  
  
My love wrecked you  
Youre back to twirl your skirt at the palace  
It hurt more than it ought to hurt  
I went to work to cultivate a callous  
  
And now Im hard too hard to know  
I dont cry when Im sad anymore no no  
Tears calcify in my tummy  
Fears go inside the bottle  
How can I ask anyone to love me  
When all I do is beg to be left alone  
  
Oh and I tried to love  
And I can love the same man and the same bed and the same city  
But not in the same room its a pity but oh  
It never bothered me before  
Not til this guy  
What a guy  
Oh God what a good guy  
And I cant even enjoy him  
Cause Im hard too hard to know  
  
I dont cry when Im sad anymore no no  
Tears calcify in my tummy  
Fears go inside the bottle  
How can I ask anyone to love me  
When all I do is beg to be left  
When all I do is beg to be left  
When all I do is beg to be left  
Alone  
Alone  
Alone  
  
My ills are articulate  
My woes are granular  
The ants weigh more than the elephants  
Nothing nothing is manageable  
So couldnt we skip the valedictories  
I can see your door there  
Shut it and forget my number  
Cause Im hard too hard to know  
  
Oh I dont cry when Im sad anymore no no  
Tears calcify in my tummy  
Fears go inside the bottle  
How can I ask anyone to love me  
When all I do is beg to be left  
When all I do is beg to be left  
When all I do is beg to be left alone
