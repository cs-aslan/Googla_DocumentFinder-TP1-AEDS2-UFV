Youve seen me naked in more ways than one  
Youve seen me done up seen me come undone  
Weve cried in the darkness weve laughed in the sun  
Weve been forever yet weve just begun  
Weve come full circle all the way round  
Through the good times and bad times through lifes ups and downs  
Still weve stayed together through thick and through thin  
Yes weve come full circle thank God were still friends  
And you know the soft spots under my skin  
Deep down inside me where no one has been  
Weve sailed troubled waters weve soared on the wind  
But times only sweetened this love that were in  
And weve come full circle all the way round  
Through the good times and bad times through lifes ups and downs  
Still weve stayed together through thick and through thin  
Yes weve come full circle thank God were still friends  
Weve cried in the darkness laughed in the sun  
Weve come full circle and weve just begun  
Weve come full circle weve been all the way round  
Weve come full circle  
Weve come full circle weve been all the way round  
You know weve cried in the darkness and weve laughed in the sun  
Weve come full circle weve been all the way round  
But weve stayed together and weve just begun  
Weve come full circle weve been all the way round  
Im so glad youre still my friend  
Weve come full circle weve been all the way round  
Weve come full circle
