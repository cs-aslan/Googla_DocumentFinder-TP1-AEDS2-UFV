Ive been down the Mississippi  
Down through New Orleans  
Yes I have  
Ive played in California  
  
There aint too much I havent seen  
No there aint  
Well Im a ramblin man  
Dont fool around with a ramblin man  
  
Left a girl in West Virginia  
Up there where that green grass grows  
Yes I did  
Another girl in Cincinnati  
  
Waitin where the Ohio River flows  
Poor girl  
Im a ramblin man  
Dont give your heart to a ramblin man  
  
Youd better move away  
Youre standin too close to the flame  
Once I mess with your mind  
Your little heart wont beat the same  
Lord Im a ramblin man  
  
Dont mess around with any ol ramblin man  
Better not  
Well up in Chicago  
I was known as Quiet Boy  
  
Yes I was  
Down in Alabama  
They call me The man of joy  
Still do  
  
Well Im a ramblin man  
Dont fall in love with a ramblin man  
Youd better move away  
Youre standin too close to the flame  
  
Once I mess with your mind  
Your little heart wont beat the same  
Lord Im a ramblin man  
Dont mess around with any ol ramblin man
