You dont know  
Whats in store  
But you know what youre here for  
Close your eyes  
Lay yourself beside me  
Ohh  
Hold tight  
For this ride  
We dont need no protection  
Come on love  
We dont need attention  
  
Open your hand  
Take a glass  
Dont be scared  
Im right here  
Even though  
You dont roll  
Trust me girl  
You wanna be high for this  
  
Take it off  
You want it off  
Cause I know  
What youre feeling  
Its okay  
Girl I feel it too  
  
Let it beat  
Baby breathe  
I swear Im right here  
Well be good  
I promise well be so good  
Ehh  
  
Open your hand  
Take a glass  
Dont be scared  
Im right here  
Even though  
You dont roll  
Trust me girl  
You wanna be high for this  
  
You wanna be high for this  
You wanna be high for this  
You wanna be high for this yeahh ey oh  
You wanna be high for this
