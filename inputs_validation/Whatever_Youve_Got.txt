Whatever youve got I want some too  
Whatever youre drinking Ill drink with you  
Youre saying azure Im feeling blue  
Thats no lie  
  
Whatever was done unto your hair  
Vidal Sassoon was standing there  
He fought the facists keep him in your prayers  
Thats no lie  
  
Whatever the time  
Whatever the place  
Whatever the rhyme  
Whatever the reason  
Im giving offence  
And with your defense  
I think we could have  
A very good season  
  
Whatever the rights I want the wrongs  
Whatever the food lets hear the gong  
Weve spoken the truth for so long  
We need lies  
  
Whatever the time  
Whatever the place  
Whatever the rhyme  
Whatever the reason  
Im giving offense  
And with your defense  
I think we could have  
A very good season  
  
Whatever the rights I want the wrongs  
Whatever the food lets hear the gong  
Weve spoken the truth for so long  
We need lies  
  
Whatever youve got  
Whatever youve got  
Whatever youve got  
Whatever youve got Whatever youve got  
Whatever youve got  
Whatever youve got
