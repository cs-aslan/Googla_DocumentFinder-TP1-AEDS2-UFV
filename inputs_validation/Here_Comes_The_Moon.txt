Everybodys talking up a storm  
Act like they dont notice it  
But here it is and here it comes  
Here comes the moon the moon the moon the moon the moon  
  
Impulse always quickens when its full  
As it turns my head around me  
Yes it does and here it comes  
Here comes the moon the moon the moon the moon the moon  
  
Gods gift I see thats moving up there into the night  
Though dark the mirror in the sky reflects us our light  
Looks like a little brother to the sun  
Or mother to the stars at night  
And here it is and here it comes  
Here comes the moon the moon the moon the moon the moon  
  
Breath is always taken when its new  
Enhance upon the clouds around it  
Yes it is and here it comes  
Here comes the moon the moon the moon
