All day long before my eyes come little visions of you  
They shouldnt they mustnt but they do  
Cant get out of this mood  
Cant get over this feeling  
Cant get out of this mood  
  
Last night your lips were appealing  
The thrill should have been all gone by today in the usual way  
But its only your arms that Im out of  
Cant get out of this dream  
What a fool to dream of you  
Twasnt part of my scheme to sigh and tell you that I love you  
But now Im saying it Im playing it dumb  
Cant get out of this mood  
Heartbreak here I come  
  
I cant get over this feeling  
Last night your lips were appealing  
The thrill should have been all gone by today in the usual way  
But its only your arms that Im out of  
What a fool to dream of you  
To sigh and tell you that I love you  
But now Im playing it now Im playing it dumb  
I cant get out of this mood  
Heartbreak heartbreak here I come
