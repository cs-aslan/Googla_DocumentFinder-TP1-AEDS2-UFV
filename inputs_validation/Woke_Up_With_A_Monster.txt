Hush little darling dont you cry  
Daddys coming home coming home tonight  
No bed of roses for your head for you  
You see no future its all in the past  
This is a nightmare wont be your last  
Its hard to admit its hard to admit youre that blind  
  
Mommy and daddy dont see eye to eye  
Mommy and daddy dont see when we cry  
Mommy and daddy they dont understand  
Whats wrong with this picture is right in their hands  
  
Sleeping with an angel ah  
Woke up with a monster ah  
Sleeping with an angel ah  
Woke up with a monster ah  
  
Hush little darling dont be long  
Mommas little angel cant do nothing wrong  
No bed of roses in your head for you  
Wholl dry your tear when you cry  
Daddys comin home just in time  
Will he be the one to make it to help make it right  
  
Mommy and daddy dont see eye to eye  
Mommy and daddy make each other cry  
  
Sleeping with an angel ah  
Woke up with a monster ah  
Sleeping with an angel ah  
Woke up with a monster ah  
  
Not sleeping with an angel ah  
Not sleeping with an angel ah  
Mommy and daddy dont see eye to eye  
Mommy and daddy dont hear when we cry  
  
Mommy and daddy dont see eye to eye  
Mommy and daddy dont see when we cry  
Mommy and daddy they dont understand  
Whats wrong with this picture is right in their hands  
  
Sleeping with an angel ah  
Woke up with a monster ah  
Sleeping with an angel ah  
Woke up with a monster ah  
  
Oh no no no no no no no  
No no no no no no no no no
