Honestly now  
Either you stand for something  
Or you get knocked down for nothing  
Sister dont ache too soon  
I thought it was understood  
By everyone in this room  
Whod ever come up short or won a race  
Safetys just danger  
 Out of place  
  
Truly now  
People play tricks of the mind  
Shadows only follow behind  
Sister stay still  
I thought it was the nature  
Of all on malverns hill  
Whod taken a lead off third base  
Safetys just danger  
 Out of place  
  
Honestly now  
If fate were to follow fortune  
And clarity trail distortion  
Sister on alert  
Pay close attention  
To fingerprints in the dust  
And fallen feet that leave no trace  
Safetys just danger  
 Out of place  
  
Sincerely now  
I requested information  
At a roadside station  
Sister it seems absurd  
To be hammering pith  
Like a poet with a loss for words  
Trying to describe an angels face  
Safetys just danger  
 Out of place  
  
Honestly now  
Wholly in demand  
Coming off second hand  
Sister dont unravel  
When theres nowhere to go  
Except lawless travel  
And an end to infinitys space  
Safetys just danger  
 Out of place
