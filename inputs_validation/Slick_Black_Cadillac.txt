Ooooo just a big black set of wheels  
Is what it takes to get me off  
Im gonna drive all night  
Spin my wheels all night  
It feels all right  
It feels all right  
  
I dont need no drivers license  
Im too reckless to survive  
Its like a carburetor instigator  
Feels all right  
Feels all right  
  
Drivin in a slick black Cadillac  
Its got solid gold hubcaps  
It makes me feel like a king  
I only need one thing  
And thats a slick black Cadillac get up  
  
You know I got a fully equipped rock n roll machine  
At speeds that take me high high high  
At dead mans curve  
I only hear one word drive drive drive  
Drive drive drive  
  
My machine is making headlines  
It gives me love and everything  
Its like an institution of revolution  
It feels all right  
Feels all right  
  
Drivin in a slick black Cadillac  
Its got solid gold hubcaps  
It makes me feel like a king  
I only need one thing  
And thats a slick black Cadillac pull over woooo  
  
I got the coppers on my tail  
Just for me an APB  
The sirens spinnin  
Though its me whos winnin  
Theyre after me  
Theyre after me  
  
Before they know just what happened  
I disappeared to their surprise  
I got a Cadillac monkey on my back  
And I dont mind  
No I dont mind  
  
Drivin in a slick black Cadillac  
Its got solid gold hubcaps  
It makes me feel like a king  
I only need one thing  
And thats a slick black Cadillac hold on  
  
Slick black Cadillac  
Its got solid gold hubcaps  
  
Slick black Cadillac  
  
I lay it down spin wide and get laid in back oh yeah  
  
Drivin in a slick black Cadillac  
It makes me feel like a king alright
