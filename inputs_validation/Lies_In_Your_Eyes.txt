Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Im dreaming you are here with me  
Can feel your body close to me  
But every time you are touching me  
I lose some kind of tension  
  
Through shady lights you talk to me  
Your shadows all that I can see  
But when youre looking down on me  
Its like youve lost your attention  
  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh no dont tell me about it  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh yeah I wanna get out  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Were through theres nothing left to say  
Love passes slipping out of the way  
Why cant you say it straight to me  
That youve lost your attention  
  
Around I wanted you near me  
Those sounds you would not hear  
And all those lonely nights  
Its like you dont care  
  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh no dont tell me about it  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh yeah I wanna get out  
  
Say to me  
Would you run  
Cause you dont wanna be  
Kept waiting here forever  
Youre plain to see  
Youre plain to see but love was faster  
Lies  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh no dont tell me about it  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh yeah I wanna get out  
  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh no dont tell me about it  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh yeah I wanna get out
