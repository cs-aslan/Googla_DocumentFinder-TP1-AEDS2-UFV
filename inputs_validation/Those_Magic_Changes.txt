Whats that playing on the radio why do I start swaying to and fro  
I have never heard that song before but if I dont hear it anymore  
Its still familiar to me sends a thrill right through me  
Cause those chords remind me of the night that I first fell in love to  
  
Those magic changes my heart arranges  
A melody thats never the same a melody thats calling your name  
It begs you please come back to me  
Please return to me dont go away again oh make them play again  
The music I wanna hear is once again you whisper in my ear  
Oh my darling aha  
  
Ill be waiting by the radio youll come back to me someday I know  
Been so long since our last goodbye but Im singin as I cry  
While the bass is sounding while the drums are pounding  
Beatings of my broken heart will rise the first place of the charts  
  
Oh my heart arranges oh those magic changes oooh yeah
