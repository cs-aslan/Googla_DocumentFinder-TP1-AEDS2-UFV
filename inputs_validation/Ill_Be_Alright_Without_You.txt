Ive been thinking bout the times  
You walked out on me  
There were moments Id believe you were there  
Do I miss you or am I lying to my self again  
I do these things  
Its all because of you  
I keep holding on but Ill try  
try not to think of you  
Love dont leave me lonely  
  
Ill be alright without you  
Therell be someone elseI keep tellin myself  
Ill be alright without you  
Ohloves an empty face I cant replace  
you dont need it  
People wonderin why we broke apart  
The great pretender here I go again  
These things I do  
Its all because of you  
Ill keep holdin but Ill try  
try not to think of you  
All I wanted was to hold you  
  
Ill be alright without you  
Therell be someone else I keep tellin myself  
Ill be alright without you  
Loves an empty faceOh Ive got to replace  
  
Ill be alright without you  
Therell be someone else I keep tellin myself  
Ill be alright without you  
Ohloves an empty place I can still see your face  
Ill be alright
