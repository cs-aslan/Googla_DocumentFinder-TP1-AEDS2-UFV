Dolly Parton  
Packin my suitcase writin a tear stained goodbye note  
Sayin so long to a love gone wrong and thats all she wrote  
Leavin behind what once was mine with sad regrets  
But its all gone now and Im leavin town on the Heartbreak Express  
Walkin in the rain with a heart full of pain to the train depot  
The only things thats gonna keep me warm now is my overcoat  
Lost and lonely waitin in line at the ticket desk  
Hey mister wont you give me a oneway ticket on the Heartbreak Express  
Im gonna roll on down the line  
Im gonna go so far Im gonna get it off my mind  
It hurts to know it aint enough when you give your best  
Got a ticket to ride and Im leavin tonight on the Heartbreak Express  
Oh I couldnt hold a candle to a flaming beauty that caught his eye  
Its killin me now but I wont stay around and let him watch me die  
Oh it just goes to show you never do know cause I never woulda guessed  
Id be sittin here now on a train sorrow bound called the Heartbreak Express  
Im gonna roll on down the line  
Im gonna go so far Im gonna get it off mt mind  
Maybe someday somewhere someway I will forget  
But theres no goin back so roll down the track you ole Heartbreak Express  
Feelin alone while a low whistle moans  
On the Heartbreak Express
