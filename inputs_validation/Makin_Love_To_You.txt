I dont believe in the rockin pneumonia  
And who cares if maybelline was a cow  
Didnt see em rollin over beethoven  
Or hear the blues wrote for chairman mao  
  
I dont care if theyre rockin the jailhouse  
Or whos acourting with a peggy sue  
I dont care if they call you a hound dog  
As long as I can make love to you  
Love to you  
  
I love makin love to you  
  
Who cares about the greata pretender  
And who the hell was ajohnny bgoode  
Rave on its a crazy feeling  
Rave on like you know you should  
You know you should  
  
I love makin love to you  
I love makin love to you  
  
I dont care about the shakes in my knee bone  
As long as Ive got my blue suede shoes  
Dont mind if you tickle my thigh bone  
As long as I can make love to you love to youbabe  
  
I love makin love to you  
I love makin love to you
