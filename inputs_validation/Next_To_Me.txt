Another day is over  
Another day is done  
And now Im getting closer  
To the rising sun  
  
Chorus  
Hey babe what you doin  
Would you like a little company  
Hey man how you doin  
Would you like to sit next to me  
  
Another day is over  
Another day is done  
Another night Im waiting  
Waiting for the sun  
  
Chorus  
Hey babe what you doin  
Would you like a little company  
Hey man how you doin  
Would you like to sit next to me  
  
Well I dont know little lady  
Youre awfully pretty but Im a nice man  
I live a nice life I have a nice house  
I have a great wife  
And Im tired of making decisions  
Without thinking oh oh oh  
  
Another moon is shining  
Another evening come  
Another hour unwinding  
Till the night is done  
  
Chorus  
Hey man what you doin  
Would you like a little company  
Hey there how you doin  
Would you like to sit next to me  
Next to me  
Next to me
