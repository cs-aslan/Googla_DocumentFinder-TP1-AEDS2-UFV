Theres a bright golden haze on the meadow  
Theres a bright golden haze on the meadow  
The corn is as high as an elephants eye  
An it looks like its climbin clear up to the sky  
  
Chorus x2  
Oh what a beautiful morning  
Oh what a beautiful day  
Ive got a wonderful feeling  
Everythings going my way  
  
All the cattle are standing like statues  
All the cattel are standing like statues  
They dont turn their heads as they see me ride by  
But a little brown mavrick is winking her eye  
  
Chorus  
  
All the sounds of the earth are like music  
All the sounds of the earth are like music  
The breeze is so busy it dont miss a tree  
And an ol Weepin Willer is laughin at me
