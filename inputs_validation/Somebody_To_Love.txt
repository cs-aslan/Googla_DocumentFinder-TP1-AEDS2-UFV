When the truth is found to be lies  
You know the joy within you dies  
  
Dont you want somebody to love  
Dont you need somebody to love  
Wouldnt you love somebody to love  
You Better find someone to love  
  
Find somebody to love  
Find somebody to love  
Find somebody to love  
When the dawn is rose they are dead  
Yes and youre mine youre so full of red  
  
Your eyes I say you eyes may look like his  
Yeah but in you head baby  
Im afraid you dont know where it is  
  
Tears are running  
Running along down your breast  
And your friends baby  
They treat you like a guest
