We were down at dead mans hill  
Smoking vines like cigarettes  
Looking through the trashy mags  
Trying to feel whats coming next  
You told me of crashing cars  
Older brothers and late night bars  
I told you what I feel most  
And you kept it like a ghost forever  
  
Dont you write it down  
Remember this in your head  
Dont take a picture  
Remember this in your heart  
Dont leave a message  
Talk to me face to face  
Talk to me face to face  
  
Lying on the bright blue jumping mat  
Dinner bell is ringing  
Barking dogs and model planes  
And the sound of passing trains  
We watch for bonfires in the sky  
On the beach in July  
Spin the bottle steal the kiss  
Postcards to the one I miss forever  
The one I miss forever  
  
Dont you write it down  
Remember this in your head  
Dont take a picture  
Remember this in your heart  
Ill leave a message  
When everything comes apart  
Talk to me face to face  
Talk to me face to face  
Everything comes apart  
Ill leave a message  
When everything comes apart  
  
I remember cats on fire  
Gasoline a burning spiral  
Standing underneath the night  
Fighting back with all my might  
Empty cans and charred remains  
Find them in the heat of day  
On the top of dead mans hill  
This is what I know of shame forever
