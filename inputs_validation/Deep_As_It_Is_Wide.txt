Theres a place at the edge of the sky  
Where theres a love deep as it is wide  
The weak are strong the hungry are all fed  
And theres a breeze from the angels flying overhead  
Oh yeah  
  
And theres a path a glorious light  
That guides you up the mountainside  
And at the top if you could youd cry  
Cause you see pure love for the very first time mmm  
  
Deep as it is wide  
  
Every breath taking me closer  
Every step leading to paradise  
They say the faithful get to go there  
I believe theres a love  
Deep as it is wide  
  
And I hear when you get to the river  
You look back for the very last time  
And when you cross you get washed off forever  
Hurry up boy eternitys on the other side ohh  
  
Deep as it is wide yeah  
  
Every breath taking me closer  
Every step leading to paradise  
They say the faithful get to go there  
I believe theres a love  
Deep as it is wide  
  
Every nation color and creed  
Like grace pouring out far as the eye can see  
Singing praises up to a King  
Cause He died for a crown  
Deep as it is wide yeah yeah yeah  
  
Every breath taking me closer  
Every step leading to paradise  
They say the faithful get to go there and  
I believe theres a love  
I believe in a love oh yeah  
I believe theres a love  
Deep as it is wide oh yeah oh  
  
Theres a place at the edge of the sky  
Where theres a love deep as it is wide
