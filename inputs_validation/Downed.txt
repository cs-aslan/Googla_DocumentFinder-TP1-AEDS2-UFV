Downed downed out of my head  
round round out of my head  
  
Im gonna live on a mountain  
Way down under in Australia  
Its either that or suicide  
Its such a strange strain on you  
Oh i got a mind  
Over you its not the first time  
Oh i got a mind  
  
Rainbows crawling on a midday sun  
But ive been lucky youre the only one  
Sundays calling youll be number one  
Its such a strange strain on you  
Oh you think of Jesus Christ  
You walk on water but dont bet your life oh no  
All you walk is a fine line  
Its such a strange strain on you  
  
Downed downed out of my head  
round round out of my head  
  
Too many people want to save the world  
Another problem is it a boy or girl  
Some say the weekend is the only world  
Its such a strange strain on you  
Oh ive got a mind  
Over you its not the first time  
All you walk is a fine line  
Its such a strange strain on you  
  
Downed downed out of my head  
round round out of my head  
Downed downed out of my head  
round round out of my head
