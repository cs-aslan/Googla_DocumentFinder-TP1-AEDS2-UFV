Despite we heard about through word of mouth is club asylum  
Lets finish up and like the breeze of the seas we arrive at the party

Every time she move she look at me

Her eyes deep enough to swim in she grinnin  
Her innocence inspire thoughts of sin an  
Crazy right she got a flower so long and smilin  
Her shakin makin Jamaica seem like temptation island
