Yesterday I was alone and blue  
My heart was heavy and then came you  
Oh I can see That you were meant for me  
Now I have found you Ill never let you go  
You know that I love you I need you  
You know that Im caring sharing everything Ive got  
Dont you know that I want you I need you too  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life  
Many lovers they come and go  
But your sweet loving lingers on and on  
Oh I can feel That this time its for real  
So hold me closer and never let me go  
You know that I love you I need you  
You know that Im caring sharing everything Ive got  
Dont you know that I want you I need you too  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life  
Well your sweet love is all I need  
Without you I just cant go on  
You know that I love you I need you too  
You know that Im caring sharing everything Ive got  
Dont you know that I want you I need you too  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life  
Ill be happy with you for the rest of my life  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life
