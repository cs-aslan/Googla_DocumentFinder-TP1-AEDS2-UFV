What the fuck am I doing  
Wake up in the morning who the fuck am I screwing  
My partner on brown and you know Im on white  
You know its going down I can do this all night  
Gotta get to the paper one time for the haters  
Money over bitches two times for the fakers  
Cause even in the dark baby Imma shine bright  
Im way too gone the best night of my life  
  
Look yeah I said gggo DJ  
See you got the Jizzle on replay  
Just keep that Jizzle on repeat  
Its about the time everybody screams Free Meech  
Lets take your bitch ass back to o five  
Close your eyes take a rough nigga look Atlanta lights  
Club vision PJ in my hand Im on the couch  
Man this nigga Meech just blew a quarter mil he bought a house  
Man you niggas gonna lace up your sneaks Its time to ball  
Presidential at the Swiss Hotel makin come alls  
Posted up all black in the back a hundred deep  
A hundred coupes posted up in the front twohundred seats  
Man somebody call the IRS too many lambos  
Im talking bottles and blunts all you can handle  
Them other niggas fakin and flaugin  
Man them real niggas do real things lets drink to that  
  
Chorus  
Im way too gone what the fuck am I doing  
Wake up in the morning who the fuck am I screwing  
My partner on brown and you know Im on white  
You know its going down I can do this all night  
Gotta get to the paper one time for the haters  
Money over bitches two times for the fakers  
Cause even in the dark baby Imma shine bright  
Im way too gone the best night of my life  
  
I said Im gone Im going going gone  
Way this night going man I wont make it home  
Imma wake up in the room wake up with a hangover  
What I spent last night I couldve bought a Range Rover  
Got my Raybans on yeah I see you haters  
Keep doing what you doing cause I need you haters  
Say whats up to long stick you can call it strong  
If I had to name my money baby I would call it long  
Said Im way too gone I dont see nobody  
I aint even on the bill Im acting like its my party  
Smell like Im on fire oh Im just that hot  
If I smoke another blunt yeah I swear Im gonna die  
You can call the weed man tell him bring another six  
Yeah I know he just left he gotta make another trip  
So hot in here feel like Im gon faint  
Even though Im past my limit still think Im gonna drink  
  
Chorus  
  
I woke up early this morning  
With three white girls wanna keep bonin  
Im blowing money fast so caught up in the moment  
One time for the marks two times for my homies  
Im a rock star every night Im a astronaut outta sight  
Put Codeine in my Sprite my wrist is full of ice  
Dont even know her name just so caught in the hype  
Its OK baby cause Im a millionaire for life  
I got bitches on my payroll they come like Vanna White  
On my Ethopia we in Vegas so icy  
Got a girl at home I know Im wrong it feels so right  
On the first road young i hope I roll on the second  
We in the club with thugs this must be heaven  
  
Chorus
