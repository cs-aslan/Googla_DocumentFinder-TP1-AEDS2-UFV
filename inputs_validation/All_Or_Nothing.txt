Tonights the night  
To come in out of the cold  
Ive waited such a long long time  
Im getting out of control  
All or nothing  
Thats what I want from you  
Im gonna give you everything I got  
Now what are you gonna do  
  
Dont try running away  
You know you get nothing that way  
Cause its too late  
Im gonna prove it to you  
Too late  
Ill do what you want me to do  
Too late  
You cant run anymore  
Cause its too late for you now  
  
My heart is burning  
An the fire is hot  
My temperature is rising rising rising  
Im ready to rock  
All or nothing  
Im gonna make you see  
Ive made up my mind for sure this time  
Youre gonna spend the night with me  
  
So dont try running away  
You know you get nothing that way  
Cause its too late  
Im gonna prove it to you  
Too late  
Ill do what you want me to do  
Too late  
You cant run anymore  
Cause its too late for you now  
  
So dont try running away  
You know you get nothing that way  
Cause its too late  
Im gonna prove it to you  
Too late  
Ill do what you want me to do  
Too late  
You cant run anymore  
Cause its too late for you now  
  
Too late  
Im gonna prove it to you  
Too late  
Ill do what you want me to do  
Too late  
You cant run anymore  
Cause its too late for you now
