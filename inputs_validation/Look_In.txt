Just another voice in the wilderness  
Just another cry for peace  
Just another voice full of loneliness  
Just another prayer for release  
Look up Look out Look in Look all about  
Look everywhere but look at yourself  
Hold on Hold up Hold out Hang in  
Please everyone but please yourself  
And try to make the world a better loving living  
Peaceful place  
  
Theres too many fat theres too many thin  
Theres too many outside trying to get in  
Theres too many trapped  
Theres too many pinned  
Theres too many winters that should have been springs  
Now  
Get in Get up Get it out Get it on  
Get everything you can for free  
Look in Look up Look out Look back  
Look everywhere but dont look for me  
And try to make the world a better loving living  
Peaceful place  
Please  
  
Its nothing but a look in a twoway mirror  
Its just another cow in the corn  
Its just another gift for the Indian giver  
Its just another blow on the horn  
Look in Look out Look up Look down  
Look everywhere but dont look for me  
Get it in Get it up Get it out Get it on  
Get everything you can for free  
And make the world a better loving living giving  
Peaceful place
