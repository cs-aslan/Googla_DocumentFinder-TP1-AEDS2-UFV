They dont know how old I am  
They found armor in my belly  
From the sixteenth century  
Conquistador I think  
They dont know how old I am  
They found armor in my belly  
Passion out of machine revving tension  
Lashing out at machine revving tension  
Rushing by the machine revving tension  
  
Morning broke out the backside of a truckstop  
The end of a line a real rainbowlikening luck stop  
Where you could say I became chronologically fucked up  
Put ten bucks in just to get the tank topped up  
  
Then I found a place its dark and its rotted  
Its a cool sweet kinda place  
Where the coppers wont spot it  
And I destroyed the map I even thought I forgot it  
However everyday Im dumping the body  
  
Itd be better for us if you dont understand  
Itd be better for me if you dont understand  
  
Then I found a place its dark and its rotted  
Its a cool sweet kinda place  
Where the coppers wont spot it  
And I destroyed the map that Id carefully dotted  
However everyday Im dumping the body  
  
Itd be better for us if you dont understand  
Itd be better for us if you dont understand  
Itd be better for me if you dont understand  
  
Let me out  
Let me out  
  
Let me out  
Let me out  
  
Let me out
