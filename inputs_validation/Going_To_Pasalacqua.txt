Here we go again infatuation  
Touches me just when I  
Thought that it would end  
Oh but then again it seemed  
Much more than that but  
Im not sure exactly what youre thinking  
  
WellI toss and turn all night  
Thinking of your ways of affection  
But to find that its not different at all  
Well I throw away my past mistakes  
And contemplate my future  
Thats when I say what the hey  
  
Would it last forever  
You and I together hand and hand  
We run away far away  
Ill beat that nasty weather  
But Ill take whatever you can  
Give that comes my way yeah far away
