Im a boat without an ocean  
Im a boat without a wave  
Im a sail without a strong wind  
And I want someone to save to save me  
  
Teach me to dance  
  
Im a car without a driver  
Im a plane without a wing  
I see you standing by my doorway  
But I dont know how to let you in  
  
Teach me to dance  
  
Ive been watching too much tv  
I cant feel myself no more  
Im tired of all those macho movies  
That aint what this life is for  
  
I dont want to hurt nobody  
Just laughing thats how I wanna be  
Cause when that brick goes through that window  
It dont make nobody free  
  
Teach me to dance
