Turn me up in the headphones  
  
Been alotta cheap talk but I rock still  
From the streets of Shanghai back to Knoxville  
Sittin high on a mountain top holdin shop spreadin the good news  
Been alotta false prophets and quick hits  
And a lot of unAmerican bullshit  
But the time has come to settle and the devils gonna make u choose  
  
And just like a cold wind blowin can u feel me comin for u  
Just like a freight train rollin packed tight full of rhythm and blues  
  
Testify  
Its a Rock revival  
Dont need a suit  
Ya dont need a bible  
Get up and dance  
Im gonna set you free yeah  
Testify  
Its all sex drugs rock n roll  
A soul sensation that you cant control  
And you can see I practice what I preach  
Im your rock n roll Jesus  
Yes I am  
  
Been alotta bling bling but it aint real  
And alotta new kings but I wont kneel  
Sittin high on a mountain top holdin shop singin the raw dog blues  
Like in old Mississippis dirty cotton fields  
Or in Detroit Citys unforgotten wheels  
Its the same song spinning but the same songs always been true  
  
And Im gonna take my roll cuz I aint got nothin to lose  
And Im gonna save your soul if its really what you want me to do  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Get on your knees  
  
Im your rock n roll Jesus
