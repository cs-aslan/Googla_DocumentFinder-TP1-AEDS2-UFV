War we at war we at war we at war we at  
Gimme my rifle gimme my rifle gimme my rifle gimme my rifle  
  
Lets get this motherfucker back crunk  
This is gonna be me and my niggas  
Holdin triggers in our back bump  
To take back what we once had  
We dont give a damn about the enemies  
Send they out to Baghdad  
They put a nigga on the front line  
But when it come to gettin ahead  
They put ya way behind  
And they supports in minimum wage  
They dont give a choice to niggas  
They thinkin we still slaves  
Every niggas got some thug in him  
Every niggas got some love in him  
Every niggas got a grudge in him  
Every niggas got a mug in him  
And every nigga busts a slug in him  
Now like a cat bitch well skin em  
yall niggas aint holdin my venom check yourself  
Im a drop your ass off bitch  
As soon as i loosen my motherfuckin belt ah  
  
Bridge  
1 for the money 2 for the thugs  
3 for the projects 4 for the love

And if ya moving too fast theyll get ya caught up like  
Ooh them ghetto classics ghetto ghetto classics ghetto  
Ghetto classics ghetto ghetto classics  
Time for us to find just a little piece of mind talkin bout  
Them ghetto classics ghetto ghetto classics  
  
We just black people gone and lost our mind  
We just really trying to draw the line  
Before it left our eyes  
Before we get left behind  
Let me tell you something about hard times  
Before we used to walk  
Before we had life in the dry  
And 911 wasnt known outside  
We didnt know how to read  
We didnt know how to write  
All we did was sing all day and all night  
Then when they let us start learning  
You all lose yall mind  
And yall forgot about the earlier times  
When Martin Luther King had a dream  
That one day wed walk together  
We really need to get it together  
Kids stay in school  
Learn all you can  
Graduate go to college get knowledge  
Then we shall overcome yes we can we  
In the urge of faith we can demand it for real  
  
Bridge

3 for the projects 4 for the love

Huh 2 3 4  
What the hell are we fighting for  
Passing off  
Relationships done what spore  
thats why they got the door  
More time hoot hoot  
Aim aim shoot shoot  
aint nothing but the young kids they recruit  
Its a wonder they dont come home in they suit  
I took away some time  
Thinkin how i could should would be  
If everybody in the world was free  
No crime nobody doing wrong  
Everybody getting along  
But when i step into reality  
This world is sore  
And thats why we at war  
Killin ourselves over bullshit  
That we valued more than life  
yall people better to get right cause  
  
Bridge  
1 for the money 2 for the thugs  
3 for the projects 4 for the love
