Once we had it all for the taking  
Love was just me and you  
You better think twice  
About the plans that youre making  
Of splitting one word in two  
  
Put your mind in doubt  
Did you ever think about  
Everything that were missing  
Dont you make me see  
What is best for me  
Cause I just wont listen baby  
  
No no no no  
I dont need nobody  
Anyone to take your place but you  
No no no no  
I just couldnt fall for anyone new  
Nobody but you  
  
Girl you are the life that Im living  
I just cant go on without you  
Lets make it alright  
Wake up to what weve been given  
Remember the things weve been through  
  
Put your mind in doubt  
Did you ever think about  
Everything that were missing  
Dont you make me see  
What is best for me  
Cause I just wont listen baby  
  
No no no no  
I dont need nobody  
Anyone to take your place but you  
No no no no  
I just couldnt fall for anyone new  
Nobody but you  
  
I cant imagine  
The two of us apart  
Cant find a reason  
Cause I still believe  
Theres no one like you  
That is why I need  
Nobody but  
Dont need nobody  
To take your place but you  
Dont need nobody at all  
No no no no  
  
No no no no  
I dont need nobody  
Anyone could take your place but you  
No no no no  
I just couldnt fall for anyone new  
Nobody but you  
  
No no no no  
I dont need nobody  
No no no no baby  
I dont need nobody  
No no no no  
I just couldnt fall for anyone new  
Nobody but you
