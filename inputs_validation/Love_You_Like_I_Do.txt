On my heart Ill bear the shame  
No prayer can ease the pain  
  
No one will love you  
No one will love you the way I do  
No one will love you love you like I do  
  
And theres no escape  
Just countless mistakes  
  
No one will love you  
No one will love you the way I do  
No one will love you love you like I do  
  
It will never be the same  
Witness trust fade away  
  
No one will love you  
No one will love you the way I do  
No one will love you  love you like I do  
  
No one will love you  
No one will love the way I do  
No one will love  love you like I do  
  
Love you like I do  
Love you like I do  
Love you like I do  
Love you like I do
