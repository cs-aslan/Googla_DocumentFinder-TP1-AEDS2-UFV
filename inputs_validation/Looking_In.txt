You look at me and see the girl  
Who lives inside the golden world  
But dont believe  
Thats all there is to see  
Youll never know the real me  
  
She smiles through a thousand tears  
And harbors adolescent fears  
She dreams of all  
That she can never be  
She wades in insecurity  
And hides herself inside of me  
  
Dont say she takes it all for granted  
Im well aware of all I have  
Dont think that I am disenchanted  
Please understand  
  
It seems as though Ive always been  
Somebody outside looking in  
Well here I am for all of them to bleed  
But they cant take my heart from me  
And they cant bring me to my knees  
Theyll never know the real me
