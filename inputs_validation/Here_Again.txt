I said I played this song  
So many times before  
That the melody keeps repeating  
Growing new ideas  
Flowing chords and notes  
Like a mountain river bleeding  
  
Well I say as I look back  
And all the thoughts Ive had  
They reflect just what Im learning  
Yes you know that the hardest part  
Yes I say it is to stay on top  
On top of a world forever churning  
  
Well you say you can laugh  
But I can see that your eyes are glass  
Well do you see cant you see what Im feeling  
Yes Ive seen your face before  
Why Ive seen it everywhere  
Showing up to me without a scent revealing  
  
Well I said will it ever change  
Will it stay the same  
Id surely like to know before its over  
Well I said I played some  
I said it wont be long  
Wont be long before I stop and play it over  
  
Oh oh Ive Ive seen your face before  
Is it ever gonna ever gonna change again  
Oh oh Ive Ive been in one place too long  
Is it ever gonna ever gonna change again
