Big feeling  
Come next September Ill be out upon the road again  
And therell be times when I can hardly even say your name  
But now were sticking to the sheets and I cant sleep tonight  
And like a dream love were moving into light  
Oh I feel like this is warning  
And oh I feel like ten feet tall  
And dont ever let me down  
Dont ever let me down  
Big feeling  
Oh its getting hard to hide  
Big feeling  
Like a river running wide  
You are my thunder  
And theres lighting here inside  
Oh come on darling now day has turned its time for home  
I wont forget that night we slept out on the beach alone  
Now the sun has come to take the moon and light the sky  
Wave over me flow over me  
Oh I feel like this is warning  
And oh I feel like ten feet tall  
And dont ever let me down  
Dont ever let me down  
Big feeling  
Oh its getting hard to hide  
Big feeling  
Like a river running wide  
You are my thunder  
And theres lighting here inside  
Lighting here inside  
Feeling inside  
Dont ever let me down  
Dont ever let me down  
Dont ever let me down  
Big feeling  
Oh its getting hard to hide  
Big feeling  
Like a river running wide  
You are my thunder  
And theres lighting here inside  
Big feeling  
Oh come on darling now day has turned its time for home  
Big feeling  
I wont forget that night we slept out on the beach alone  
You are my thunder  
And theres lighting here inside  
Lighting here inside
