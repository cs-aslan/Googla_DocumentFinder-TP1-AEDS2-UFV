If theres doubt and youre cold  
Dont you worry what the future holds  
Weve gotta have heroes to teach us all  
To never give up on a dream  
  
Claim the road touch the sun  
No force on earth could stop you run  
When your heart bursts like the sun  
Never never give up on a dream  
  
Shadows fall daylight dies  
Freedom never got a place to hide  
Search forever photo finish line  
But never give up on your dream  
  
Crazy notions fill your head  
You gotta break all the records set  
Push yourself until the end  
But dont you ever give up on your dream  
  
Now listen to me  
You dont need no restrictions yeah  
Oh sing it again  
You cant live on sympathy  
You just need to go the distance  
Oh the distance  
Thats all you need to be free  
To be free to be free to be free  
  
Sing a song for me children  
You dont need no restrictions yeah  
You cant live on sympathy  
You just need to go the distance  
Thats all you need to be free  
  
Now listen to me  
Inspiring all to never lose  
Itll take a long long time before they fill your shoes  
Itll take somebody somebody whos lot like you  
Who never gave up on a dream  
No you never gave up on a dream  
No you never gave up on a dream  
  
You never never never  
Never gave up on a dream
