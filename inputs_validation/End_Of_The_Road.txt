Spoken  
Girl you know  
We belong together  
I have no time for  
You to be playing  
With my heart like this  
Youll be mine forever  
Baby you just see  
  
We belong together  
And you that Im right  
Why do you play  
With my heart  
Why do you play  
With my mind  
  
Said wed be forever  
Said itd never die  
How could you love me  
And leave me  
And never say goodbye  
  
When I cant sleep at night  
Without holding you tight  
Girl each time I try  
I just break down and cry  
Pain in my head oh  
Id rather be dead  
Spinnin around and around  
  
CHORUS  
Although weve come to  
The end of the road  
Still I cant let you go  
Its unnatural  
You belong to me  
I belong to you  
Come to the  
End of the road  
Still I cant let you go  
Its unnatural  
You belong to me  
I belong to you  
  
Girl I know you  
Really love me  
You just dont realise  
Youve never  
Been there before  
Its only your first time  
  
Maybe Ill forgive you hmm  
Maybe youll try  
We should be  
Happy together  
Forever you and I  
  
Can you love me again  
Like you loved me before  
This time I want you  
To love me much more  
This time instead  
Just come to my bed  
And baby just  
Dont let me  
Dont let me down  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Spoken  
Girl Im here for you  
All those times of night  
When you just hurt me  
And just run out  
With that other fella  
Baby I knew about it  
I just didnt care  
You just dont understand  
How much I love you do you  
Im here for you  
  
Im not out to go out and  
Cheat on you all night  
Just like you did baby  
But thats all right  
Hey I love you anyway  
And Im still gonna  
Be here for you  
Till my dying day baby  
Right now Im just in  
So much pain baby  
Cause you just wont  
Come back to me  
Will you  
Just come back to me  
  
Lonely  
Yes baby my  
Heart is lonely  
Lonely  
My heart hurts baby  
Lonely  
Yes I feel pain too  
Baby please  
  
This time instead  
Just come to my bed  
And baby just  
Dont let me go  
  
Repeat chorus twice
