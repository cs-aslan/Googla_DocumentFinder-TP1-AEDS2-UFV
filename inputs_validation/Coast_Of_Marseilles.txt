Keith Sykes  
I sat there on the coast of Marseilles  
My thoughts came by like wind through my hand  
How good itd be to hold you  
How good itd be to feel like that again  
How good itd be to feel like that again  
  
Would you be remembering me  
I ask that question time and again  
The answer came and haunted me so  
I did not want to think it again  
I did not want to think it again  
  
You make it hard for me to forget  
I havent stopped loving you yet  
  
When I left the coast of Marseilles  
I hadnt done what Id come to do  
I spent all the money Id saved  
And did not get over you  
I did not get over you
