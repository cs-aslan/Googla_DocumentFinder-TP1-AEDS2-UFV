Nah nah nah  
The good guys dress in black remember that  
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact  
The title held by me MIB  
  
Means what you think you saw you did not see  
So dont blink be what was there is now gone  
The black suits with the black Ray Bans on  
Walk in shadow move in silence  
  
Guard against extraterrestrial violence  
But yo we aint on no government list  
We straight dont exist  no names and no fingerprints  
Saw somethin strange watch your back  
  
Cause you never quite know where the MIBs is at  
Uh eh  
  
Here come the Men In Black Men In Black  
Galaxy defenders  
  
Oho oho oho  
Here come the Men In Black Men In Black  
They wont let you remember  
  
Aha aha  
Now From the deepest of the darkest night  
On the horizon bright light enters sight tight  
Cameras zoom on the impending doom  
  
But then like BOOM black suits fill the room up  
With the quickness talk with the witnesses  
Hypnotizer neuralizer  
Vivid memories turn to fantasies  
  
Aint no MIBs can I please  
Do what we say thats they way we kick it  
Dya know what I mean  
I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya  
  
Were your first last and only line of defense  
Against the worst scum of the universe  
So dont fear us cheer us  
If you ever get near us dont jeer us were fearless

Whats that stand for Men In Black

Come on let me see ya just slide with me

Come on let me see ya take a walk with me

I know we might seem imposing  
But trust me if we ever show in your section  
  
Believe me its for your own protection  
Cause we see things that you need not see  
And we be places that you need not be  
So go on with your life
