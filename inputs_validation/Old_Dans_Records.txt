Get out old Dans records  
Get out old Dans records  
We will Dance the whole night long  
Its fun to play the old time songs  
If old Dan could see us now  
I know hed be so proud  
Bring out old Dans records  
Bring out old Dans records  
I remember my aunt Bea  
Shed dance with Dan till two or three  
If old Dan could see he now  
I know hed shout out loud  
Dig out old Dans records  
Bring out old Dans records  
Were all here weve all got dates  
Well dance all night to the seventyeights  
If old Dan could see us now  
I know hed be so proud  
If old Dan were with us still  
I know hed come around  
Get out old Dans records  
Dig out old Dans records  
Back to nineteen thirtyfive  
The foxtrot jitterbug n jive  
If old Dan could see us now  
I know hed be so proud  
Get out old Dans records  
Bring out old Dans records  
High above the fireplace  
Theres a smile on old Dans face  
If old Dan could see us now  
I know hed be so proud  
If old Dan were with us still  
I know hed come around
