This is a ballad for the good times  
So put a battery in your leg  
Put a rock beat over anything  
Get it stuck there in your head  
You can be with me  
  
I got nothing to rely on  
Ive broken every bone  
Everybodys stop believing  
But you know youre not alone  
You can be with me  
  
This is a ballad for the good times  
And all the dignity we had  
Dont get het up on the evil things  
You aint coming back  
You can be with me  
If you want to be  
You can be with me
