If I had wings  
Like Noahs dove  
Id fly  
Across the water  
To that man I love  
Fare you well  
Oh honey  
Fare you well  
  
One of these mornings  
In the drizzling rain  
All around my heart  
Was an aching pain  
Fare you well  
Oh honey  
Fare you well  
  
If I had listened  
To what my mama said  
Id of stayed at home  
In mommas bed  
Fare you well  
Oh honey  
Fare you well  
Fare you well  
Oh honey  
Fare you well  
  
One of these mornings  
It wont be long  
Youll call my name  
And Ill be gone  
Fare you well  
Fare you well  
Fare you well
