Headin up to San Francisco  
For the Labor Day weekend show  
Ive got my hushpuppies on  
I guess I never was meant for  
Glitter rock and roll  
And honey I didnt know  
That Id be missin you so  
  
Come Monday Itll be all right  
Come Monday Ill be holding you tight  
I spent four lonely days in a brown LA haze  
And I just want you back by my side  
  
Yes its been quite a summer  
Rentacars and west bound trains  
And now youre off on vacation  
Somethin you tried to explain  
And darlin I love you so thats  
The reason I just let you go  
  
Come Monday Itll be all right  
Come Monday Ill be holding you tight  
I spent four lonely days in a brown LA haze  
And I just want you back by my side  
  
I cant help it honey  
Youre that much a part of me now  
Remember the night in Montana when  
We said thered be no room for doubt  
  
I hope youre enjoyin the scenery  
I know that its pretty up there  
We can go hikin on Tuesday  
With you Id walk anywhere  
California has worn me quite thin  
I just cant wait to see you again  
  
Come Monday Itll be all right  
Come Monday Ill be holding you tight  
I spent four lonely days in a brown LA haze  
And I just want you back by my side
