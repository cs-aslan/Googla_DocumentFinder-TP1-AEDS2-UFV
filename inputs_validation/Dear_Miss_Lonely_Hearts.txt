Dear miss lonely hearts  
I had to write this letter  
To tell you how I came to meet her  
She was sweet but I dated her sister  
Thats how I made my mistake  
And I cant forget her  
I felt depressed  
Till a friend of mine suggested  
That I write to this address  
So unless you can find a cure  
For my loneliness  
It will persist it will persist

Dear lonely boy  
I doubt if my reply  
Will bring much joy  
It seems from your letter that you lied  
Or strongly implied  
That you were satisfied  
To take her sister by your side  
I became distressed  
At your total lack of tactfulness  
So at best  
All I can suggest  
Is that you resist  
And you put an end  
To such thoughts of silliness

Dear miss lonely hearts  
Ive got problems  
Youre the only one I know that can solve them  
I love a girl but Im dating her sister  
And if I persist in my pursuit I will kiss her  
  
Dear lonely girl  
I doubt if this reply will bring much joy  
But you must not trust this boy  
You must not lust this boy  
Resist  
And do not kiss this boy
