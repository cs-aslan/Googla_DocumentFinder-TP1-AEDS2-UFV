I never had no one that I could count on  
Ive been let down so many times  
I was tired of hurtin so tired of searchin  
Til you walked into my life  
It was a feelin Id never known  
And for the first time I didnt feel alone  
  
Youre more than a lover  
There could never be another  
To make me feel the way you do  
Oh we just get closer  
I fall in love all over  
Every time I look at you  
I dont know where Id be  
Without you here with me  
Life with you makes perfect sense  
Youre my best friend  
Youre my best friend  
  
You stand by me you believe in me  
Like nobody ever has  
When my world goes crazy  
Youre right there to save me  
You make me see how much I have  
And I still tremble when we touch  
And oh the look in your eyes  
When we make love  
  
Youre more than a lover  
There could never be another  
To make me feel the way you do  
Oh we just get closer  
I fall in love all over  
Every time I look at you  
And I dont know where Id be  
Without you here with me  
Life with you makes perfect sense  
Youre my best friend  
Youre my best friend  
  
Youre more than a lover  
There could never be another  
To make me feel the way you do  
And oh we just get closer  
I fall in love all over  
Every time I look at you  
And I dont know where Id be  
Without you here with me  
Life with you makes perfect sense  
Youre my best friend  
Youre my best friend  
Youre my best friend
