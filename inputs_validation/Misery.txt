Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
So scared of breaking it  
That you wont let it bend  
And I wrote two hundred letters  
I will never send  
Sometimes these cuts are so much  
Deeper then they seem  
Youd rather cover up  
Id rather let them bleed  
So let me be  
And Ill set you free  
  
I am in misery  
There aint nobody  
Who can comfort me  
Why wont you answer me  
The silence is slowly killing me  
Girl you really got me bad  
You really got me bad  
Im gonna get you back  
Gonna get you back  
  
Your salty skin and how  
It mixes in with mine  
The way it feels to be  
Completely intertwined  
Its not that I didnt care  
Its that I didnt know  
Its not what I didnt feel  
Its what I didnt show  
So let me be  
And Ill set you free  
  
I am in misery  
There aint nobody  
Who can comfort me  
Why wont you answer me  
Your silence is slowly killing me  
Girl you really got me bad  
You really got me bad  
Im gonna get you back  
Gonna get you back  
  
You say your faith is shaken  
You may be mistaken  
You keep me wide awake and  
Waiting for the sun  
Im desperate and confused  
So far away from you  
Im getting there  
Dont care where I have to run  
  
Why do you do what you do to me yeah  
Why wont you answer me answer me yeah  
Why do you do what you do to me yeah  
Why wont you answer me answer me yeah  
  
I am in misery  
There aint nobody  
Who can comfort me  
Why wont you answer me  
Your silence is slowly killing me  
Girl you really got me bad  
You really got me bad  
Im gonna get you back  
Gonna get you back  
  
Girl you really got me bad  
You really got me bad  
Im gonna get you back  
Gonna get you back  
  
Girl you really got me bad  
You really got me bad  
Im gonna get you back  
Gonna get you back
