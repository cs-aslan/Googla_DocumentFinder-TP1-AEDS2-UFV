The payme girl has had enough of the bleeps  
So she takes the bus into the country  
Although she got herself rosy cheeks  
She didnt leave enough money to pay the rent  
The landlord says that shes out in a week  
What a shame she was just getting comfy  
Now shes eating chocolate to induce sleep  
In a chemical world its very very very cheap  
  
And I dont know about you  
But theyre putting the holes in yes yes  
Its been a hell of a do  
Theyve been putting the holes in yes yes  
  
Peeping Thomas has a very nice view  
Across the street at the exhibitionist  
These townies they never speak to you  
Just stick together so they never get lonely  
Feeling lead feeling quite lightheaded  
Had to sit down and have some sugary tea  
In chemical world in a chemical world  
Its very very very cheap  
  
And I dont know about you  
But theyre putting the holes in yes yes  
Its been a hell of a do  
Theyve been putting the holes in yes yes yes  
  
I dont know about you  
But theyre putting the holes in yes yes  
Its been a hell of a do  
Theyve been putting the holes in yes yes  
And now shes found about you  
But theyre putting the holes in yes yes  
Well I dont know about you  
Theyve been putting the holes in yes yes  
  
Until you can see right through  
Until you can see right through  
Until you can see right through
