Open the windows Virginia  
Let the wind blow the papers away  
Dont know if youve got it in ya  
Just like a dunce in the eighth grade  
Youll soon be an old maid  
School teacher rule creature cool creature school teacher  
  
Youre a beginner Virginia  
Simple arithmetic shows a delay  
Do all the sums deep within ya  
Oh yes and then assign the grade  
Youll soon be an old maid  
School teacher rule creature cool creature school teacher  
  
Your souls in limbo Virginia  
You found a formula for your mistakes  
God doesnt know where to send ya  
The Bibles black opaque keepsakes  
When your red hairs turning grey  
School teacher rule creature cool creature school teacher
