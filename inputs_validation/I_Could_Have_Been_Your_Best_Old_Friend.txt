Fate is mighty cruel  
Where true love is concerned  
It seems you give out more  
Than you ever have returned  
Lately I have tried  
To make it on my own  
Another night has passed  
Looks like Im bound to be alone  
Bound to be alone  
  
Now solitude is fine  
When you really need it  
When your soul is dry  
Sometimes loneliness can feed it  
When you need a lover  
You know theres nothing else will do  
When you need love most  
You know it turns its back on you  
  
Oh I can make it through without your company  
I only wish I knew why you wont comfort me  
I thought that I could count on you  
To hear me crying out  
I guess thats one comfort  
I will learn to do without  
  
Falling love too easily  
But never quite so fast  
So you are not the first and lord  
You sure wont be the last  
The thing about the situation  
That makes me feel so sad  
I couldve been the best old friend  
That you have ever had  
I couldve been the best old friend  
That you have ever had
