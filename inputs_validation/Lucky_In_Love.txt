You look so good to me you never change  
Lord has it really been so long  
Somehow old mystery dont matter now  
Or who was right and who was wrong  
  
We can make a new memory of you and me  
Cause Im losing the ones I been using too long on my own  
We can take it like it ought to be so easily  
When you luck into lucky lovin you leave it alone  
  
Feel this heart of mine  
Lord cant you see how bad that we been missin you  
These days its hard to find or make  
Believe any dreams worth comin true  
  
We can take it to eternity you and me  
Cause were better together than well ever be on our own  
We can make like it ought to be so easily  
When you luck into lucky lovin you leave it alone  
  
We can make a new memory of you and me  
Cause Im losing the ones I been using too long on my own  
We can make it like it ought to be so easily  
When you luck into lucky lovin you leave it alone
