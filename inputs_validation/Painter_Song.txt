If I were a painter  
I would paint my reverie  
If thats the only way for you to be with me  
  
Wed be there together  
Just like we used to be  
Underneath the swirling skies for all to see  
  
And Im dreaming of a place  
Where I could see your face  
And I think my brush would take me there  
But only  
  
If I were a painter  
And could paint a memory  
Id climb inside the swirling skies to be with you  
Id climb inside the skies to be with you
