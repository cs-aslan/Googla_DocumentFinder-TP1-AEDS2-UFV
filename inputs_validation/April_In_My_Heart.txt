Theres snowflakes in the sky  
And geese are flying high  
But its April in my heart again  
The devil got his due  
Loves holiday is through  
Love and I have made a happy start again  
Through leaves lie on the ground  
The world just turned around  
It isnt Fall at all you see  
Its Spring that I have found  
  
Theres frost in Central Park  
At five its almost dark  
Whats the difference  
When youve heard loves sweet amend  
Theres snowflakes in the sky  
And geese are flying high  
But theres April in my heart again
