Im all by myself I dont need anybody else  
Im all by myself no help  
Im all on my own quietly sleeping in my home  
Im all on my own my own  
  
Hello wont you let me come in  
Lhuna cant you hear how much Im suffering  
Hello wont you let me know  
Cause Im all alone all alone  
  
We are dreaming about Lhuna  
The smell of her the touch and the taste of her  
Dreaming about Lhuna  
Her and me simultaneously  
  
I dont know what the time is  
I dont know where youve flown  
And I dont know why youre so far from home  
  
Hello wont you let me come in  
Lhuna cant you hear how much Im suffering  
Hello wont you let me know  
Cause Im all alone all alone  
  
We are dreaming about Lhuna  
The smell of her the touch and the taste of her  
Dreaming about Lhuna  
Her and me simultaneously  
Her and me effortlessly  
Oh her and me effortlessly
