In the fights they had hed cover up his ears  
Thought big boys dont cry fight back all the tears  
Mammad use her makeup to hide the bruises on her face  
In the morning theyd pretend that thered never ever been a trace  
His old man woke him up to help him find the car  
Take the bus uptown outside some run down bar  
He swore that he was quitting and then hed start to cry  
And though the boy knew the truth sometimes hed still believe that lie  
  
The sins of the father are the sins of the son  
All you do is crawl when you want to run  
God gave boys their mammas  
Cause they always see their promise  
And they help them understand  
How to walk like man  
Walk like a man  
  
They moved a lot of places they never settled down  
And it got pretty old being the new kid in town  
Hed always tell his friends My daddys sick today  
Said hes be rich if he had a nickel every time he heard his momma say  
  
The sins of the father are the sins of the son  
Crawl before you walk boy walk before you run  
Come on stand up straight Im proud of you take my hand  
I know you can  
Walk like a man  
Walk like a man  
  
Your daddys demons are callin your name  
Dont you listen to you em cause they got no claim  
Temptations may come that aint no sin  
You get stronger every time that you dont give in  
  
The sins of the father are the sins of son  
You cant undo what has been done  
Youll have to retrace his footsteps through the sand  
And pray you find the love of a girl  
Take her by the hand and walk on  
Walk like a man
