Its kinda hard to wear high heels or slip on banana peels how does she get
in and out of tubs  
I hope she doesnt get mad I hope she thinks this song is good not bad  
cause we think that shes totally rad shes Nubs  
  
No fingers no toes she doesnt own elbows no phalanges no knobby knees to
knock  
She doesnt need knuckles or hands to go see punk rock bands shes always in
the stands shes Nubs  
She cant pick up a phone she cant get dressed alone shes got no funny
bone shes Nubs  
No shoes no feet but we sure do think shes neat shes Nubs shes Nubs
shes Nubs  
  
I asked her if she wanted a drink I asked her if she liked Toronto I asked
her to go to the bar  
But all she said was no thanks no and no  
  
It was time for her to leave so I grabbed and shook her sleeve and told her
Id see her at the next club  
She got into a pack some guy put her on his back she said goodbye and kinda
waved her stub  
  
Shes got beautiful eyes and breasts regular size but without calves and
thighs shes Nubs  
Its hard to give good head or get tied to a bed when all youve got is a
body and head shes Nubs  
  
Shes Nubs shes Nubs shes Nubs shes Nubs shes Nubs shes Nubs  
She may not walk the walk she may not like to talk but bopy does she know
how to rock  
Shes Nubs
