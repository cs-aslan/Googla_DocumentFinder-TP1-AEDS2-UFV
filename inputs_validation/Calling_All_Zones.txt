Chorus  
You got a one way ticket to hell  
Smack dab in the middle of the ATL  
And aww I dont want to hustle no more but the streets wont let me go  
All my niggaz say  
Zone 1 right here Zone 2 right here Zone 3 Zone 4 right here Zone 5
and 6 but thats it  
  
For a nigga with a dream  
Atlanta is the city  
And they make it so seem  
But ride through the city  
And The Streets aint clean  
All I see is drug deals big wheels and feinds  
But any way they took East Atlanta back  
Throw Atlanta Down  
Turned little Vietnam to a white folks town  
And fo I forget to say you should have been fixture streets by MLK  
I aint talkin about the dope  
In talking about the raggedy road  
Niggas crack they rims riding over potholes  
But thats how it goes  
When you stuck fuck outta luck and lost in the ghettos  
  
Chorus  
You got a one way ticket to hell  
Smack dab in the middle of the ATL  
And aww I dont want to hustle no more but the streets wont let me go  
All my niggaz say  
Zone 1 right here Zone 2 right here Zone 3 Zone 4 right here Zone 5
and 6 but thats it  
  
They talking ATL Atlanta Georgia

They called me mamma boy but now they call me drummer boy  
They talking jet skiis I had that shit last summer boy

Back then Shawty D was gone  
Flat heat right here was on  
They put me on the song back then we all got along aint had no switch game  
Atlanta just wont be the same  
Hit Man Sammy Sam DJ Smurf and Ying Yang  
I know when kids rockin used to beat the block I lived in a little house
boy  
And the block party would never stop I remember when GLyfe was when I had
that little jelly bean  
I remember them East 30 Cadillacs and

I remember the curfews what we used to get  
  
Chorus  
  
A parking lot Alley niggaz thinkin again  
When you speaking bout Atlanta mention Ying Yang Twins
