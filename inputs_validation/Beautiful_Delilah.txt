Beautiful Delilah sweet as apple pie  
Always gets a second look from fellas passin by  
Every time you see her shes with a different guy  
Beautiful Delilah thats the reason why  
  
Chorus  
The better dont allow me fool around with you  
You are so tantalizing you just cant be true  
  
Beautiful Delilah dressed in the latest style  
Swingin like a pendulum walkin down the aisle  
Deep romantic eyes speak so low in miles  
Maybe she will settle down and marry after a while  
  
Chorus  
  
Beautiful Delilah bathin in the sun  
An audience of 17 and notice not a one  
Local Casanova who wouldnt be outdone  
Let her steal his heart away break it just for fun  
  
Chorus
