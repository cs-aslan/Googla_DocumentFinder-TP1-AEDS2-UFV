I use the dead wood to make the fire rise  
The blood of innocence burning in the skies  
I filled my cup with the rising of the sea  
And poured it out in an ocean of debris  
  
Ooh Im swimming in the smoke  
Of bridges I have burned  
So dont apologize  
Im losing what I dont deserve  
What I dont deserve  
  
We held our breathe when the clouds began to form  
But you were lost in the beating of the storm  
But in the end we were made to be apart  
In separate chambers of the human heart  
  
Ooh Im swimming in the smoke  
Of bridges I have burned  
So dont apologize  
Im losing what I dont deserve  
Its in the blackened bones  
Of bridges I have burned  
So dont apologize  
Im losing what I dont deserve  
What I dont deserve  
  
Im swimming in the smoke  
Of bridges I have burned  
So dont apologize  
Im losing what I dont deserve  
The blame is mine alone  
For bridges I have burned  
So dont apologize  
Im losing what I dont deserve  
What I dont deserve  
What I dont deserve ooh woah  
What I dont deserve  
  
I use the dead wood to make the fire rise  
The blood of innocence burning in the skies
