Have I stayed away too long  
Have I stayed away too long  
If I came home tonight  
Would you still be my darling  
Or have I stayed away too long  
  
The love light that shone so strong  
Sweet love light that shone so strong  
If I came home tonight  
Would that same light be shining  
Or have I stayed away too long  
  
Im just outside of town  
And Ill soon be at your door  
But maybe Id be wrong  
To hurry there  
Id best keep out of town  
And worry you no more  
Maybe someone else  
Has made you care  
  
Have all of my dreams gone wrong  
My beautiful dreams gone wrong  
If I came home tonight w  
Would you still be my darling  
Or have I stayed away too long  
  
If I came home tonight  
Would you still be my darling  
Or have I stayed away too long
