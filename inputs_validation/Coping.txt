Primal evil what am I  
Tonguetied til the day I die  
Theres no love made mermaids  
Its just distraction or so they  
  
And Im too tired to care about it  
Cant you see this in my face my face  
  
When I feel this strange can I go through this again  
When I feel this strange can I go through this again  
  
Its a sorry state youre getting in  
The same excuse is wearing thin  
Theres no self control left in me  
What was not will never will be  
  
And Im too tired to care about it  
Cant you see this in my face my face  
  
When I feel this strange can I go through this again  
When I feel this strange can I go through this again  
Or am I just coping  
  
And Im too tired to care about it  
Cant you see this in my face  
The emphisis on coping  
Cant you see this in my face my face  
  
When I feel this strange can I go through this again  
When I feel this strange can I go through this again x2  
Can I be dreaming Or am I just coping
