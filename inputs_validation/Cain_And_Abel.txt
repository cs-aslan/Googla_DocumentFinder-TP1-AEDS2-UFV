Now have you read of the fable of Cain and Abel  
Once they were in a scandal that shook the town  
Cain became mighty jealous of brother Abel  
So he rose up and smote Abel down  
  
Now the Lord sure was hopping mad  
And yet he was plenty sad  
to think that he had a man like Cain  
  
The Lord spoke and showed his wrath  
And Cain walked the path  
That led to a life full of pain  
  
You cant run from the shadow of retribution  
If youre bad then you gotta pay for your wrongs  
Let yourself take a lesson from Cain and Able  
  
Dont lament be content  
Dont resent what the Lord has sent  
And youll find that youre bound to get along
