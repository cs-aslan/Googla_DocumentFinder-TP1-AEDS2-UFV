The sweetest songs fade to echoes in the wind  
The best of times must end so a new day can begin  
And the dreams we dream that seem so real at night  
Must meet the morning light and vanish from our sight  
  
Chorus  
Its just goodbye remember  
Time was never our friend  
We walked the road together and we came to the end  
Its just goodbye now I wont tell you not to cry  
But I swear that what we had wont die  
Cause it isnt over its just goodbye  
  
I close my eyes and I still can see your face  
I know the truth of us cant be bound by time or space  
And the joy we shared the magic that weve known  
Is something that we own though we may be alone  
  
Chorus  
  
Its just goodbye  
It doesnt really matter why  
I know what we had can never die  
Cause Ill always love you  
Yes Ill always love you  
So its just goodbye
