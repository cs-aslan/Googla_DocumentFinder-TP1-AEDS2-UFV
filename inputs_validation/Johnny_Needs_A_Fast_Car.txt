Johnny needs a fast car  
Johnny needs it bad  
Johnny always do the best  
Whatever johnny has  
Johnny needs a fast one  
Johnny needs it now  
You got to give him something to  
Let him show you how  
Johnny needs a fast car  
  
Johnny needs a fast car  
Johnny needs a break  
Johnny dont need good luck  
cause johnny never fakes  
Hell always make it look good  
Youll always see him smile  
Give johnny a few inches  
And hell give you back a mile  
  
Johnny needs a fast car  
Johnny needs a fast car  
  
Tears upon the broken bones  
Of luck that never went his way  
Bless this one youll know him by his smile
