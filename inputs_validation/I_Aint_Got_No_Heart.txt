Aint got no heart  
I aint got no heart to give away  
I sit and laugh at fools in love  
There aint no such thing as love  
No angels singing up above today  
Girl I dont believe  
Girl I dont believe in what you say  
You say your heart is only mine  
I say to you you must be blind  
What makes you think that youre so fine  
That I would throw away  
The groovy life I lead  
cause baby what youve got yeah  
It sure aint what I need  
Girl youd better go  
Girl youd better go away  
I think that life with you would be  
Just not quite the thing for me  
Why is it so hard to see my way  
Why should I be stuck with you  
Its just not what I want to do  
Why should an embrace or two  
Make me such a part of you  
I aint got no heart to give away  
Away  
No no no no no no no  
Aint got no heart  
Aint got no heart  
I aint got no heart to give away
