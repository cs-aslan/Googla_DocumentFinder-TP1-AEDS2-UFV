The Devils Train is long and black  
It rides on rails of fear  
Its headin for destruction now  
With a drunken engineer  
  
Oh see the greatness of the crowd  
That waits beside the track  
Theyre leavin on that Devils Train  
And never comin back  
  
Oh Lord please stop that terrible train  
Before it is too late  
And teach them how to bow their heads  
Before it steals their fate  
  
The Devils Train will take you  
To a land of groans and pain  
Youll spend your days in sorrow  
If you ride that Devils Train  
  
Oh listen to that whistle scream  
Like echoes from the blue  
The blood is white and spouting steam  
Shes on her way to doom  
  
Oh Lord please stop that terrible train  
Before it is too late  
And teach them how to bow their heads  
Before it steals their fate  
  
The Devils Train is long and black  
Its beautiful to see  
It offers you temptation  
But it gives you misery  
  
So come and ride that glorious train  
Where happiness is free  
Its on its way to heaven now  
To spend eternity  
  
Oh Lord please stop that terrible train  
Before it is too late  
And teach them how to bow their heads  
Before it steals their fate
