My oh my its a miracle  
Good morning love  
Rise and shine  
Its a beautiful day  
And I feel fine  
Come watch the sun light the sky  
And sip a coffee you and I  
Wont you give us a kiss now  
Perchance a little more  
No dont mind that witch  
Peeking out next door  
I feel like a lark sitting high up a tree  
Whats just another day to one man  
Is a miracle to me  
My oh my its a miracle  
a miracle to me  
My oh my its a miracle  
its a miracle  
All the whinning all the worry  
All the fast friends and the fury  
Oh dear lord  
All the madness that used to move me  
Simply dont behoove me  
No more  
Yeah let it rain let is shine  
If I got you I got mine  
Oh well hello sweet sanity  
Im alive and Im smilling  
And thats a miracle to me  
My oh my its a miracle  
a miracle to me  
My oh my its a miracle  
Now good morning love  
And how are you  
Does your old man seem  
A bit too chearful to be true  
Excuse me if I shed a little tear joyfully  
But when your hands in my hand  
Yeah when a woman really loves a man  
Its a miracle to me  
My oh my its a miracle  
a miracle to me  
My oh my its a miracle  
its a miracle  
Im ten miles high its a miracle  
Im ten miles high its a miracle  
Look at my life its a miracle  
its a miracle
