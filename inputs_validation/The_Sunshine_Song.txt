Well sometimes the sun shines on  
Other peoples houses and not mine  
Some days the clouds paint the sky all gray  
And it takes away my summertime  
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you  
While I struggle to get mine  
If theres a light in everybody  
Send out your ray of sunshine  
  
I want to walk the same roads as everybody else Through the trees and past
the gates  
Getting high on heavenly breezes  
Making new friends along the way  
I wont ask much of nobody  
Im just here to sing along  
And make my mistakes looks gracious  
And learn some lessons from my wrongs  
  
Well sometimes the sun shines on  
Other peoples houses and not mine  
Some days the clouds paint the sky all gray  
And it takes away my summertime  
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you  
While I struggle to get mine  
A little light never hurt nobody  
Send out your ray of sunshine  
  
Oh if this little light of mine  
Combined with yours today  
How many watts could we luminate  
How many villages could we save  
  
And my umbrellas tired of the weather  
Wearing me down  
Well look at me now  
  
You should look as good as your outlook  
Would you mind if I took some time  
to soak up your light your beautiful light  
Youve got a paradise inside  
I get hungry for love and thirsty for life  
And much too full on the pain  
When I look to the sky to help me  
And sometimes it looks like rain  
  
As the sun shines on other peoples houses  
And not mine  
And the sky paints those clouds in a way  
That it takes away the summertime  
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you  
while I kindly stand by  
If theres a light in everybody  
Send out your ray of sunshine  
  
Youre undeniably warm youre cerulean  
Youre perfect in desire  
Wont you hang around  
so the sun it can shine on me  
And the clouds they can roll away  
And the sky can become a possibility  
If theres a light in everybody  
Send out your ray of sunshine
