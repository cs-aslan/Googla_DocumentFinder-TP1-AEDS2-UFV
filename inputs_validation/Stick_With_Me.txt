Too much time and too much space looking for the truth  
Mountains you have had to climb valleys youve been through  
I dont know about where youve been or where youre going to  
I will get lost with you  
  
Oh father dont you worry Ive never let you down  
Oh mother when you need me Ill always be around  
Sister its hard to see you struggle like you do  
I will get lost with you  
  
We all get lonely  
Trying to find a place where we should be  
Trying to find someone to set us free  
There are times a friend is all you need  
We all get lonely so stick with me  
  
Oh yeah so stick with me  
We all get lonely so stick with me  
  
Too much blame and too much shame none of it is true  
All the weight of your regrets we all got a few  
Its not too much to carry if you let me carry too yeah  
I will be there with you  
  
Oh father dont you worry Ive never let you down  
Oh mother when you need me Ill always be around  
Sister its hard to see you struggle like you do  
But Ill be there with you  
  
We all get lonely  
Trying to find a place where we should be  
Trying to find someone to set us free  
There are times a friend is all you need  
We all get lonely so stick with me  
  
We all get lonely  
We all get lonely  
We all get lonely  
Come on baby  
  
Oh father dont you worry Ive never let you down  
Oh mother when you need me Ill always be around  
Sister its hard to see you struggle like you do  
But Ill be there with you  
  
We all get lonely  
Trying to find a place where we should be  
Trying to find someone to set us free  
There are times a friend is all you need  
We all get lonely so stick with me  
  
So stick with me oh yeah
