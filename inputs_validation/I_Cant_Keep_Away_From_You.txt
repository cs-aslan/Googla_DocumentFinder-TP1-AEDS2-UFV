By your side each minutes where I wanna be  
Cant get you off my mind and let it rest in peace  
So every step you make I wanna make it too  
Oh I cant keep away from you  
Well I dont care where you are as long as youre with me  
Youre every dream I dream youre every breath I breathe  
My shadow follows you loves everything you do  
Why I cant keep away from you  
Oh I cant keep away from you I couldnt if I wanted to  
No matter how hard I try or what I do  
Youve got my heart and soul thats why I need you so  
Youre holding on to me I know I cant let go  
But oh would I go through to prove my love is true  
Oh I cant keep away from you  
 steel   
Baby I cant keep away from you
