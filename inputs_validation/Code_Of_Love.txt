He put so much into her life  
She took so much out of his  
It was a crucial assignment  
No one ever asked for this  
It was a little confusin  
He thought he knew what to do  
But now theyre walkin in silence  
Little girl and soldier blue  
Well she wrote you a song sayin that she approved  
But you didnt understand  
And when love comes along its just a catcher in the rye  
Its hard to make those long term plans  
Well its the code of love  
You dont understand her  
Well its the code of love  
You could never ask for more  
You could never ask for more  
They made a certain agreement  
Hes bound to do what hes told  
He ran back home with the message  
Screwed up in a pocket cold  
She sat at home with her reason  
A sour note and a tear  
But love comes home for the season  
Breakin down the walls of fears  
Well she wrote you a song sayin that she approved  
But you didnt understand  
And when love comes along its just a catcher in the rye  
Its hard to make those long term plans  
Well its the code of love  
You dont understand her  
Well its the code of love  
You could never ask for more  
You could never ask for more  
Well its the code of love  
You dont understand her  
Well its the code of love  
You dont understand her  
Code of love  
Code of love  
Code of love
