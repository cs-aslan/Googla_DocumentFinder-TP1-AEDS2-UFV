Im writing my last love letter  
And for reasons now I dont know where to start  
Seems so many times Ive written down I love you  
Well I hope this time I can get that through your heart  
Only fools will go on and keep talkin to a wall  
But I cant fool around forever  
And if stone is the wall that youve built around your heart  
Then I guess its goodbye in this letter  
And maybe I was wrong to ever think that you could love me  
I was hoping you just couldnt find the time  
Have my efforts been in vain with pen and paper  
Did you ever care did I ever cross your mind  
Only fools will go on and keep talkin to a wall  
But I cant fool around forever  
And if stone is the wall that youve built around your heart  
Then I guess its goodbye in this letter  
In this letter  
In this letter
