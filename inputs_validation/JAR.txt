My friend drove off the other day  
And now hes gone and all they say  
Is you gotta live cause life goes on  
But now I see Im mortal too  
I cant live my life like you  
Gotta live it up while life goes on  
  
And I think its alright  
That I do what I like cause thats the way I wanna live  
And so I give  
And Im still giving  
  
And now I wonder about my friend  
If he gave all he could give  
Cause he lived his life like I live mine  
If you could see inside my head  
Then youd start to understand  
The things I value in my heart  
  
You know that  
I know that  
Youre watching me  
  
Gotta make a plan  
Gotta do whats right  
Cant run around in circles if you wanna build a life  
And I dont wanna make a plan for a day far away  
While Im young and while Im able all I wanna do is
