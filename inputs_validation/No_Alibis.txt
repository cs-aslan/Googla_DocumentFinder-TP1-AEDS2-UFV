I beg your pardon hello darlin  
This is me youre talkin to  
Sit down and tell me about it  
You dont have to shout it at me  
Tell me what you really want to do  
  
Chorus  
Dont give me no alibis  
No untrue stories youre trying to justify  
Dont want no alibis  
Just another reason for another lie  
  
Mountain gets steeper  
The hole you dig gets deeper  
You better stop and climb out  
Cause Im trying to give it all to you  
Baby I can see right through you  
Sometimes you lose what its all about  
  
Dont give me no alibis  
Cant go through life trying to justify  
Dont want no alibis  
Just another reason for another lie  
  
Chorus  
  
Mountain gets steeper  
The hole you dig is getting deeper  
Better reach out and pull yourself out  
Nobody ever gonna love you the way that I love you  
And I never want to see you doin without  
  
Chorus x2
