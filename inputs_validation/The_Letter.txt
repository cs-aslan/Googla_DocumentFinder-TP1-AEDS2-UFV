I sit at my window  
With everything Ive done  
Doors that Ive opened  
The webs that Ive spun  
And the candle beside me  
It burns to the left  
And the rain on the clay  
Sends the lizard to its nest  
will there be a time  
When Ill hold you again  
With my arms spread out  
My chest youll rest  
And Ill write you a letter  
With everything I know  
bout the weight of the world  
And the way things could go  
So live up my friend  
Step back again  
For somethings will be given  
For some youll have to bend  
You ll have to bend my friend  
To hold on to this  
For somethings will come easy  
And some will be a test  
Youll have to bend  
Now the ocean connects me  
To everything I know  
Im mellowing my mind  
So my heart it can call  
With these trees as my witness  
Ill slice up some fruit  
And each to their peacefull  
Good intentions and truth  
There will be a time  
When Ill hold you again  
With my arms spread out  
I will dive right in  
So now here is your letter  
With everything I know  
Bout the weight of the world  
And the way things could go  
So live up my friend  
Step back again  
For somethings will be given  
For some youll have to bend  
Youll have to bend my friend  
To hold on to this  
For somethings will come easy  
And some will be a test  
Youll have to bend  
Now the ocean connects me  
To everything I know  
Im mellowing my mind  
So my heart it can call  
With these trees as my witness  
Ill slice up some fruit  
And each to their peacefull  
Good intentions and truth  
There will be a time  
When Ill hold you again  
With my arms spread out  
I will dive right in  
So now here is your letter  
With everything I know  
bout the weight of the world  
And the way things could go
