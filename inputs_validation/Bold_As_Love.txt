Anger he smiles  
Towering in shiny metallic purple armour  
Queen Jealousy envy waits behind him  
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground  
  
Blue are the lifegiving waters taken for granted  
They quietly understand  
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready  
But wonder why the fight is on  
But theyre all bold as love yes theyre all bold as love  
Yeah theyre all bold as love  
Just ask the axis  
  
My red is so confident he flashes trophies of war  
And ribbons of euphoria  
Orange is young full of daring  
But very unsteady for the first go round  
My yellow in this case is not so mellow  
In fact Im trying to say its frightened like me  
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from eh  
Giving my life to a rainbow like you  
But Im Im bold as love yeah Im bold as love  
Yeah yeah  
Well Im bold bold as love hear me talking girl  
Im bold as love  
Just ask the axis he knows everything  
  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
Yeah
