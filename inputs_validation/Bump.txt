She make me sling that skrilla  
Body tight for the summer  
Get it get it for the winter

Need something they can lay on  
That shit on my mind  
I need something to spend my day on  
And I love her like my niggas my niggas my niggas  
She aint bout my feelings my feelings my feelings  
And I cant live by these hoes  
Cause she the one I chose  
Got the keys to the Benz  
I dont even drive my shit no more  
And let us just
