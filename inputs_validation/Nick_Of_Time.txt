I led a lonesome journey  
Full of disdain and fury  
I kept my angered yearning  
Close to me like fire burning  
I watched a million chances  
Slip through my weathered hands  
I almost lost myself when I looked around  
There was nobody else  
Chorus  
In the nick of time  
You opened up my mind  
And suddenly I saw the world much clearer  
In the nick of time  
You turned my water to wine  
And suddenly I didnt feel the fear  
Right before my eyes  
You showed me there was life that to be found  
Youre the miracle I prayed about you  
You were the one to save my life  
In the nick of time  
I followed habits around  
Been swept above off the clouds  
But fallen down left shaken  
Abandened by the pills Id taken  
I could have kept on going  
With no one ever knowing  
Who really wants to see a tired nobody like me  
Chorus 2x  
I could not I could not believe  
That you were right there waiting  
I never no I never dreamed  
That youd be right there waiting  
Oh you were there for me  
And when I couldnt see  
I couldnt no I couldnt see  
You showed me life 2x  
LIFE 3x  
Chorus 2x
