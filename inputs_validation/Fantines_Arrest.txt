Bamatabois is a well dressed gentleman  
  
Bamatabois  
Heres something new I think Ill give it a try  
Come closer you I like to see what I buy  
The usual price for just a slice of your pie  
  
Fantine  
I dont want you no no Msieur let me go  
  
Bamatabois  
Is this a trick I wont pay more  
  
Fantine  
No not at all  
  
Bamatabois  
Youve got some nerve you little whore  
Youve got some gall  
Its the same with a tart as it is with a grocer  
The customer sees what he gets in advance  
Its not for the whore to say yes sir or no sir  
Its not for the harlot to pick and to choose  
Or lead me to a dance  
  
He hits her with his stick she claws at his face drawing blood  
  
Fantine  
Ill kill you you bastard try any of that  
Even a whore who has gone to the bad  
Wont be had by a rat  
  
Bamatabois  
By Christ youll pay for what you have done  
This rat will make you bleed youll see  
I guarantee Ill make you suffer  
For this disturbance of the peace  
For this insult to life and property  
  
Fantine  
I beg you dont report me sir  
Ill do whatever you may want  
  
Bamatabois  
Make your excuse to the police  
  
Javert enters accompanied by constables  
  
Javert  
Tell me quickly whats the story  
Who saw what and why and where  
Let him give a full description  
Let him answer to Javert  
In this nest of whores and vipers  
Let one speak who saw it all  
Who laid hands on this good man here  
Whats the substance of this brawl  
  
Bamatabois  
Javert would you believe it  
I was crossing from the park  
When this prostitute attacked me  
You can see she left her mark  
  
Javert  
She will answer for her actions  
When you make a full report  
You may rest assured Msieur  
That she will answer to the court  
  
Fantine  
Theres a child who sorely needs me  
Please Msieur shes but that high  
Holy God is there no mercy  
If I go to jail shell die  
  
Javert  
I have heard such protestations  
Every day for twenty years  
Lets have no more explanations  
Save your breath and save your tears  
Honest work just reward  
Thats the way to please the Lord  
  
Fantine gives a last despairing cry as she is arrested Valjean emerges from
the crowd  
  
Valjean  
A moment of your time Javert  
I do believe this womans tale  
  
Javert  
But Msieur Mayor  
  
Valjean  
Youve done your duty  
Let her be  
She needs a doctor not a jail  
  
Javert  
But Msieur Mayor  
  
Fantine  
Can this be  
  
Valjean  
Where will she end   
This child without a friend  
Ive seen your face before  
Show me some way to help you  
How have you come to grief  
In a place such as this  
  
Fantine  
Msieur dont mock me now I pray  
Its hard enough Ive lost my pride  
You let your foreman send me away  
Yes you were there and turned aside  
I never did no wrong  
  
Valjean  
Is it true what I have done  
To an innocent soul  
Had I only known then Fantine  
My daughters close to dying  
If theres a God above  
Hed let me die instead  
  
Valjean  
In His name my task has just begun  
I will see it done  
I will see it done  
  
Javert  
But Msieur Mayor  
  
Valjean  
I will see it done  
  
Javert  
But Msieur Mayor  
  
Voices  
Look out Its a runaway cart
