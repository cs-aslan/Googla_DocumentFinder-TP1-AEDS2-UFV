Go out and have your habit  
Keep on takin it  
Keep on fakin it  
Youre the one whose heart grows cold  
Youre the one whose hearts grown cold  
  
Go out and have your habit  
Youre the one thats takin it  
Youre the one thats fakin it  
Youre the one whose hearts grown cold  
Youre the one whose hearts grown cold  
  
I touch your lips with my fingertips  
I hang on every breath you take  
You dont need me like  
I need you  
You have your heartaches to climb  
Everyday I just hope and pray  
I just hope that you still have  
That you still have your dreams  
  
Come down and tell me that its better  
Youre the one whos choosin it  
Youre the one whos losin it  
Youre the one whos got no soul  
Youre the one whose hearts grown cold
