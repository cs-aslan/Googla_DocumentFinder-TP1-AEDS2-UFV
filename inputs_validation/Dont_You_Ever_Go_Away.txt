Hey can you tell my heart is aching  
You Its only you thats on my mind  
I I can not fight this feeling  
Now now I know why love is blind  
Chorus  
From the top of my world to the bottom of my heart  
Just the way that you are youre the one my shining star  
Everything that you do everything that you might say  
Youre the love of my life dont you ever go away  
Love I feel my heart could beat forever  
Kiss when its slow with tenderness  
Touch when were making love its heaven  
Time girl with you theres only bliss  
Chorus  
You are everything I wanted  
And I would love to love you girl  
To the end of time  
Chorus Fade
