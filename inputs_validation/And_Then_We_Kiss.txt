Lying alone  
Touching my skin  
Im falling under  
A girl like me  
And I cant hold it in  
It makes me wonder  
  
Is this for real  
Its not what it seems  
Youre like an angel  
Im running now  
My feet off the ground  
  
Chorus  
Take me  
Touch me  
Wont you hold me close  
  
And then we kiss  
Your love comes alive on my lips  
I feel the rush  
Coming over me over me  
And when we touch  
This moment when everythings still  
I close my eyes  
And then we kiss  
  
The feel of your hand  
As it touches my hair  
It makes me tremble  
Dont wanna let go  
Of the feelings we share  
So baby go slow  
  
Our hearts beating fast  
And my body cries  
I want it to last  
This burning inside  
Were getting deeper  
  
Chorus  
Take me  
Touch me  
Wont you hold me close  
  
And then we kiss  
Your love comes alive on my lips  
I feel the rush  
Coming over me over me  
And when we touch  
This moment when everythings still  
I close my eyes  
And then we kiss  
  
Youre drifting  
The sun comes up  
Youre fading  
You seem so far  
I dont know  
If Im awake  
Open my eyes  
And then we  
We kiss  
  
Chorus  
Take me  
Touch me  
Wont you hold me close  
  
And then we kiss  
Your love comes alive on my lips  
I feel the rush  
Coming over me over me  
And when we touch  
This moment when everythings still  
I close my eyes  
And then we kiss  
  
And then we kiss x2  
And when we touch  
This moment when everythings still  
I close my eyes  
And then we kiss
