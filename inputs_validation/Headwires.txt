Have you been headwired  
Were you satisfied  
Did it free the feelings in your spine  
Sleeping way inside all this time  
  
Will your meet your mind  
Where the night collides  
Will you greet yourself  
When the sun arrives  
  
Ill just stay behind  
Ive met mine  
  
Better than a bullet being fired  
Tangled in your headwires now  
  
Help you feed the wires  
When your head unwinds  
And if our headlines become entwined  
You can have all mine  
Ill be fine  
  
Theres a reason why  
Keeping me alive  
Theres a cure in me  
That I wish were mine  
As long as I can fight Ill survive  
  
Better than a bullet being fired  
Tangled in your headwires now  
Better than a bullet being fired  
Tangled in your headwires now  
  
Stationed on the wire  
One day Ill let go  
Tell them all Hello  
Tell them all Hello  
  
The sun is on  
Arlandria  
  
Headwires
