Baby youre improvabe  
It wont Take long  
Mountains can be movable  
If the spirits strong  
Youve got possibilities  
Takes a fella to tell  
Youve got possibilities  
Let me pry you from your shell  
  
Somewhere way down deep in you Theres life No doubt  
Its just been asleep in you Let me bring it out Yes  
Youve got possibilities Maybe even a lot  
Redhot possibilities You dont even know youve got  
You wont be shy When I get through  
Ill make you purr You pussycat you  
Somewhere way down deep in you Theres life No doubt  
Its just been asleep in you Let me bring it out Yes  
Youve got possibilities Maybe even a lot  
Redhot possibilities You dont even know youve got
