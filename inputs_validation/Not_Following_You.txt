If Im catching your eye  
It was an accident  
If I looked at you strange  
Its not what I meant  
I wanted to touch  
Youre occupied  
I tried to explain but Im tongue tied  
Ill wait in the wings again  
Until you find me out  
What is the hold up  
  
Oo oo oo  
Im not following you  
Ooo oo oo  
Walking this way too  
Ooo oo oo  
Ive had enough of dreaming  
All my dreams are you  
  
If I sat next to you  
That wasnt my intent  
And if my hand falls on yours  
It was coincidence  
Ill stay in the room until youre gone  
Ill switch to the chair that you sat on  
Ill sit there alone again  
Until you find me out  
What is the hold up  
  
Ooo oo oo  
Im not following you  
Ooo oo oo  
Walking this way too  
Ooo oo oo  
See Ive had enough of dreaming  
All my dreams are you  
  
I wish you would notice me  
If not now eventually  
Then I wouldnt have to follow you around  
And hunt you down  
Hunt you down  
Hunt you down  
  
Promise well get along  
If you talk to me  
Well tell eachother our stories imperfectly  
Imperfectly  
  
I wanted to touch  
Youre occupied  
I tried to explain but Im tongue tied  
Ill wait in the wings again  
Until you find me out  
See what is the hold up  
  
Ooo oo oo  
Im not following you  
Ooo oo oo  
Walking this way too  
Ooo oo oo  
Ive had enough of dreaming  
All my dreams are you
