I had a woman  
Livin way back o town  
Yeah she treated me right  
Never let me down  
But I wasnt satisfied  
I had to run around  
  
Now shes gone and left me  
Im worried as can be  
Oh Ive searched this world all over  
Wonderin where she could be  
I would ask that she forgive me  
And maybe shell come back to me  
  
But I doubt it  
Im lonesome an blue  
And Ive learned a thing or two  
Oh fellas heres a tip  
Im gonna pass on down to you  
Never mistreat your woman  
Cause its gonna bounce right back on you
