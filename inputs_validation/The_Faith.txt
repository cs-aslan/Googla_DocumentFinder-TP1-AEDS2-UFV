The sea so deep and blind  
The sun the wild regret  
The club the wheel the mind  
O love arent you tired yet  
The club the wheel the mind  
O love arent you tired yet  
The blood the soil the faith  
These words you cant forget  
Your vow your holy place  
O love arent you tired yet  
The blood the soil the faith  
O love arent you tired yet  
A cross on every hill  
A star a minaret  
So many graves to fill  
O love arent you tired yet  
So many graves to fill  
O love arent you tired yet  
The sea so deep and blind  
Where still the sun must set  
And time itself unwind  
O love arent you tired yet  
And time itself unwind  
O love arent you tired yet
