Theres nothing I can say  
Theres nothing I can do  
To show you the love  
That I got for you  
  
Theres nothing in this world  
That could ever take your place  
When I look into your eyes  
I see a sweet face  
  
Ill never set you free  
Till you give your love to me  
  
Chorus  
Cause I love you Ill never set set you free  
And I need you Ill never set set you free  
Yes I want you Ill never set set you free  
Cause I love you Ill never set set you free  
  
Will you open up your heart  
So love could make a start  
I know that if you do  
Dreams will come true  
  
Ill never set you free  
Till you give your love to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill never set you free  
Till you give your love to me  
  
Theres nothing you can do  
To stop my love for you  
  
Chorus
