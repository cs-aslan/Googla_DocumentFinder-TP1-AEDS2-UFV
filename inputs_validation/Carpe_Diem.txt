Breaking in a sweat  
Like a bomb threat  
Is your silhouette fading out  
Nothing left to lose  
Detonate the fuse  
Another breaking news blowout  
  
Aint it beautiful  
So unusual  
Lifes a gas and its running out  
Living a cliche  
Gonna seize the day  
Bottle rockets and celebrate celebrate celebrate  
  
Carpe diem a battle cry  
Are we all too young to die  
Ask a reason and no reply  
Are we all too young to die  
  
Making a living  
Making a killing  
Whats worth forgiving  
Alright  
  
The blink of an eye  
Barely scraping by  
Dominated by passer bys  
Feeling out of luck  
When the traffics stuck  
And youre feeling  
So left behind  
  
Getting off a binge  
Get a second wind  
Another promise  
Just make a change  
Got a Broken wing  
Hear the angels sing  
With a signal thats out of range  
Aint it strange  
Aint it strange  
  
Carpe diem a battle cry  
Are we all too young to die  
Ask a reason and no reply  
Are we all too young to die  
  
Making a living  
Making a killing  
Whats worth forgiving  
Alright  
  
Making a living  
Making a killing  
Whats worth forgiving  
Alright  
  
Carpe diem a battle cry  
Are we all too young to die  
Ask a reason and no reply  
Are we all too young to die  
  
Carpe diem a battle cry  
Are we all too young to die  
Ask a reason and no reply  
Are we all too young to die
