When I was young I use to wait  
On massa an hand him his plate  
An pass de bottle when he got dry  
An brush away de bluetail fly  
  
Jimmie crack corn an I dont care  
Jimmie crack corn an I dont care  
Jimmie crack corn an I dont care  
Ol Massas gone away  
  
One day he ride aroun de farm  
De flies so numrous they did swarm  
One chanced to bite him on de thigh  
De devil take de bluetail fly  
  
Jimmie crack corn an I dont care  
Jimmie crack corn an I dont care  
Jimmie crack corn an I dont care  
Ol Massas gone away  
  
De pony run he jump he pitch  
He threw my Massa in de ditch  
He died an de jury wondered why  
De verdict was de bluetail fly  
  
Jimmie crack corn an I dont care  
Jimmie crack corn an I dont care  
Jimmie crack corn an I dont care  
Ol Massas gone away  
  
They lay him under a simmon tree  
His epitaph is there to see   
Beneath this stone Im forced to lie   
Victim of de bluetail fly   
  
Jimmie crack corn an I dont care  
Jimmie crack corn an I dont care  
Jimmie crack corn an I dont care  
Ol Massas gone away
