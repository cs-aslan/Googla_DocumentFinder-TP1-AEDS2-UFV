Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning  
I sit around  
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry  
Strange voices are saying ah what did they say  
Things I cant understand  
Its too close for comfort  
This heat has got right out of hand  
  
Its a cruel cruel cruel summer  
Leaving me here on my own  
Its a cruel its a cruel cruel summer  
Now youre gone  
Youre not the only one  
Its a cruel  
  
The city is crowded my friends are away and Im on my own  
Its too hot to handle so I gotta get up and go and go  
  
Its a cruel cruel cruel summer  
Leaving me here on my own  
Its a cruel its a cruel cruel summer  
Now youre gone  
Youre not the only one  
  
Its a cruel cruel cruel summer  
Leaving me Leaving me here on my own  
Its a cruel its a cruel cruel summer  
Now youre gone  
Youre not the only one  
Its a cruel  
  
Now dont you leave me  
Now dont you leave me  
Now dont you leave me  
Come on come on  
  
Now dont you leave me  
Now dont you leave me  
Now dont you leave me  
Come on come on  
  
Its a cruel cruel cruel summer cruel summer  
Leaving me here on my own leaving me here all alone  
  
Its a cruel its a cruel cruel summer cruel summer  
Dont leave me leave me in this summer  
Youre not the only one youre not the only one

Youre not the only one at home
