Chorus  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
Lets go  
Saturday night Rainbow bar and grill  
Where theres Cocaine lines and a little white pill  
A beer and a gin now I cant see straight  
Slip it in no glove oops too late  
I remember her face but forgot her name  
She forgot mine too aint that a shame  
Smelled like reefer and my hairs in a mess  
I left my love running down her dress  
  
Chorus  
  
Dave from Drowning Pool is here  
Steals my women and he drinks my beer  
Buys me a pizza and a shot of Jim Beam  
And as who the fuck is Angeline  
I go to piss in the parking lot well  
I get in a fight but I dont get caught  
Hell no problem cause the nights still young  
I want a little more gonna get ya some  
  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
CC lets go  
  
Rock stars movie stars a Hollywood scene  
I eat dinner with Nick Cage and Charlie Sheen  
Nick asks me what the hell Unskinny Bop means  
Its slang for CC banging a porno queen  
  
Mario Michael Tony and Steady  
RV wont ya get table six ready  
My Platinum records hang all around  
Rainbows home when Im in this town  
  
Chorus
