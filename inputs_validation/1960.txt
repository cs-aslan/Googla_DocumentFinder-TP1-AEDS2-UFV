How bout a tear for the year of 1960  
I watched the fins of the Cadillac fall  
I remember Dad explained about the Berlin Wall  
How bout a tear for the torment and the trouble  
That was brewing in the Asian way  
I wore a smile like the faces that surround LA  
In the city of the lost and found  
Its hard to get a break  
Hard to stop from getting turned around  
And make the same mistakes  
My reputations on the line  
The final day of 59  
But like the sun just watch me shine  
Today  
How bout a cheer for the piano virtuoso  
I practiced 61 minutes a day  
I could never reach the keys  
But it was all OK  
How bout a cheer for the humour in my brother  
That could brighten up the darkest nights  
Its just another sign of love  
Whenever we would fight  
Its all the same twenty years ago  
As it is right now  
Like a tour at the closing show  
When I take my bow  
My reputations on the line  
At the start of 79  
But like the sun just watch me shine  
Today  
Ive played this part so many times  
Since the end of 59  
But like the sun just watch me shine  
Today
