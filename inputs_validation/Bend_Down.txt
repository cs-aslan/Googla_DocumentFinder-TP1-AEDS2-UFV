Bend down I order you  
Turning your face back from me too  
I dont need to see it now  
Bend down  
A biped who is on all fours  
Ill lead him down on the floor  
In quickstep we move along  
Im so displeased  
Now crawling backwards to meet me  
Honey stains his tights so badly  
Im so displeased  
Sadly displeased  
Bend down  
Ive no interest in the rest  
The biped stuttered a short prayer  
In fear of what I couldnt bear  
Tried to bend down more and more  
Tears were running off to the floor  
Bend down  
Bend down I order you  
Turning your face back from me too  
I dont need to see it now  
Bend down you know how  
Bend down
