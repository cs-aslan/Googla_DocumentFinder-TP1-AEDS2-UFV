Here it comes again  
That old familiar pain  
Here it comes again  
Now it has a name  
What am I to do  
And where am I to go  
Here it comes again  
I am not myself  
  
Do you think of me  
Do you think of me  
  
Here it comes again  
Im Tortured and deceived  
Here it comes again  
If only Id believed  
What am I to say  
And where am I to die  
Here it comes again  
And I am not myself  
  
Do you think of me  
Do you think of me  
  
Ill tell you something that you dont know  
Ill tell you something that you dont know  
  
Once is always so dont call me  
Once is always so dont call me
