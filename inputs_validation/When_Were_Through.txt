I woke up one early evening and I knew I was alone  
Did the sun come up or did it rain again Ill never know  
I felt the acid in my stomach rise above my throat as I dialed  
  
There was a message from my mother from about 7am said Ive forgotten what you
sound like and Im wondering how youve been  
I cried myself to sleep back on the floor unconscious in denial  
  
Life is just a little part of what the world will do  
To get its point across it beats you til your black and blue  
And decides just when your in or when your out  
Cuz when your through your through  
  
Theres a cafe round the corner from the home I call a house  
I sit and play sudoku til I figure some shit out  
I drink the days first coffee and I smoke  
The last cigarette of my life  
  
And Im wondering out of all the crazy places that Ive been  
Would it ever be as good as sitting here just with a friend  
Where its always understood it might be time  
To switch the coffee to the wine  
  
Life is just a little part of what the world will do  
To get its point across it beats you til your black and blue  
And decides just when your in or when your out  
Cuz when your through your through  
  
Yeah Yeah  
Whoaaaah Ohhhh  
Whoaaaaahhhhhh  
  
Ohhhh Ohhh Ohhh  
Oh  
  
Janis sings to me just like shes sitting by my side  
And I wonder just how many times shes sat like me and cried  
Ive made it passed the age of 27  
So theres no use in dying  
  
And all my friends have asked the question  
baby will you be ok  
I wanna tell them yes cuz I know thats what I should say  
But Ive got no crystal ball and I cant bring myself to lie and why should I  
  
Hey yeahhhh I think that  
Life is just a little part of what this world will do  
It brings us to the brink and beats the shit right outta you  
And decides just when your in or when your out  
Cuz when your through your through  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Life is just a little part of what this world will do  
It brings us to the brink and beats the shit right outta you  
And decides just when your in or when your out  
Cuz when your through your through  
  
Ayyye Oh  
I guess Im through  
Mmmmm  
When youre through youre through
