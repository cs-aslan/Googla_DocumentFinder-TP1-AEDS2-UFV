Lookin at the pictures of the places  
That hed been an old man told me what hed found  
Said it dont make no difference whether youre  
Out or whether youre in though the world keeps  
Goin round and round Goin round and round  
  
Said he looked at the places talked of the faces that hed seen  
Then he turned the pictures upside down  
Said it dont make no difference how many places youve been  
Said the world keeps goin round and round  
Goin round and round  
  
Then he put up the pictures shook his head and with a grin  
He talked about his ups and downs  
Said it dont make no difference how many fixes youve been in  
No the world keeps goin round and round  
Goin round and round  
  
Betty Joe Johnson dont you pull no Daisy Mae on me  
Daisy Mae she did me dirty so I had to leave her for  
Anna Lee Anna Lee she had big street feet  
She spent her nights out on the row  
  
So I started seeing Sally Jackson I had to let Anna Lee go  
Sally Jackson was a player  
Had another man along with me  
So I just took me one step backwards  
Checked up on old Anna Lee  
Anna Lee still had them street feet  
Liked to dance all night and sleep all day  
So I just took one more step backwards  
checked up on old Daisy Mae  
Daisy Mae was still doin dirty  
so Ill tell you what I had to do  
Had to go just one step further Betty Joe Johnson  
Yeah and thats how I know you  
  
Looked at the places talked of the faces in life hed seen  
Then he turned the pictures upside down  
Said it dont make no difference how many places that youve been  
Said the world keeps goin round and round  
Goin round and round
