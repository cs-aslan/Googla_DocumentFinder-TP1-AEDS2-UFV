Mama they try and break me  
The window burns to light the way back home  
A light that warms no matter where theyve gone  
Theyre off to find the hero of the day  
But what if they should fall by someones wicked way  
Still the window burns time so slowly turns  
Someone there is sighing  
Keepers of the flames  
Do you feel your names  
Do you hear your babies crying  
Mama they try and break me  
Still they try and break me  
Scuse me while I tend to how I feel  
These things return to me that still seem real  
Now deservingly this easy chair  
But the rocking stops by wheels of despair  
Dont want your aid  
But the fist Ive made for years wont hold or feel  
No Im not all me  
So please excuse me while I tend to how I fell  
But now the dreams and waking screams that ever last through the night echoed
between James and Jason  
  
So build the wall behind it crawl and hide until its light  
Can you hear your babies crying now  
Still the window burns  
Time so slowly turns  
And someone there is sighing  
Keepers of the flames cant you feel your names  
Cant you hear your babies crying  
But now the dreams and waking screams that  
Ever last the night  
So build a wall behind it crawl  
And hide until its light  
So cant you hear your babies crying now  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try mama they try  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try Mama they try
