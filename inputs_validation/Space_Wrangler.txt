A little wrangler was born  
I seen him squirming in the saddle all wet and warm  
Hes such a changeable form in his very first year  
  
He rides on to wrangler school  
With a slingshot and a saddlebag of handmedown tools  
Doesnt want to look like a fool  
Pass the jail without tears  
  
Time machines remembered scenes  
That a wrangler rides through a passing stream  
Times replaced by a peaceful dream  
Wrangler space  
  
He reigns his pony to the gate of the school  
Feather pens and inkwells of handmedown rules  
Like trading a pony for an aging mule  
He rides away without fear  
  
Time machines new routines  
That a wrangler rides through a passing dream  
And times replaced by a peaceful stream  
Space wrangler space  
  
He gets off at a strangers place  
Where the girls dance different with familiar grace  
Hes knowing that he found the place  
That pours the coldest beer  
  
Skol very cold beer  
Cheers to your friends so near  
High your dreams so clear  
Raise another glass to the dreams so near
