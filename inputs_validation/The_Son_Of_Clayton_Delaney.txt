On Fourth Street in Louisville in 1978  
Stranded in a honkytonk somewhere tween dates  
There was a little band playin as I sipped my beer  
But I never thought that Id hear what Id hear  
  
There was a young man a pickin lectric guitar  
Smokin and a snippin a learnin how to be a star  
He had a big blue bandanna tied around his head  
A laidback bass and a drummer named Red  
  
Well his hair was cut long in the fashion of the time  
Sandpaper vocal but he milked every line  
His fingers like lightnin on the guitar that he played  
He did Lay Down Sally andHank Didnt Do It This Way  
  
Well I sat there and listened for over an hour  
And the closest thing to country was a rockin Wildwood Flower  
And I got that feelin that I had been there before  
But I knew I had never been through that door  
  
Well the jukebox was turned on and the band took a break  
I made my way up front to howdy and shake  
I said Son I like your music and I kinda like your style  
But it seemed to me that I had seen that smile  
  
Well he stood there for a moment then he laughed and he slapped his knee  
He said You are one man Ive wanted to see  
He said I know you you storytellin son of a gun  
And you know me Im Clayton Delaneys son
