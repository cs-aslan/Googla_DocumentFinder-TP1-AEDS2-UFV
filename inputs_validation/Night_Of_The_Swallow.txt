The night doesnt like it  
Looks just like your face on the moon to me  
And I wont let you do  
What you want to do  
Its funny how even now youre laughing  
  
I wont let you do it  
  
If you go Ill let the law know  
And theyll head you off when you touch the ground  
Ooh please dont go through with this  
I dont like the sound of it  
Its funny how even now youre miles away  
  
I wont let you do it  
I wont let you do it  
I wont let you go through with it  
  
Meet them over at Dover  
Ill just pilot the motor  
Take them over the water  
  
With a hired plane  
And no names mentioned  
Tonights the night of the flight  
Before you know  
Ill be over the water  
  
Like a swallow  
Theres no risk  
Ill whisk them up in no moonlight  
And though pigs can fly  
Theyll never find us  
Posing as the night  
And Im home before the morning  
  
In Malta catch a swallow  
For all of the guilty to set them free  
Wings fill the window  
And they beat and bleed  
They hold the sky on the other side of borderlines  
  
Meet them over at Dover  
Ill just pilot the motor  
Take them over the water  
Like a swallow flying to Malta  
  
With a hired plane  
And no names mentioned  
Tonights the night of the flight  
Before you know  
Ill be over the water  
Like a swallow  
  
Theres no risk  
Ill whisk them up in no moonlight  
And though pigs can fly  
Theyll never find us  
Posing as the night  
And Im home before the morning  
  
Give me a break  
Oh let me try  
Give me something to show  
For my miserable life  
Give me something to take  
Would you break even my wings  
Just like a swallow  
  
Let me let me go  
With a hired plane  
And no names mentioned  
Tonights the night of the flight  
Before you know  
Ill be over the water  
Like a swallow  
  
Let me let me go  
Theres no risk  
Ill whisk them up in no moonlight  
And though pigs can fly  
Theyll never find us  
Posing as the night  
And Im home before the morning  
  
Let me let me go  
With a hired plane  
And no names mentioned  
Tonights the night of the flight  
Before you know  
Ill be over the water  
Like a swallow  
  
Let me let me go  
Theres no risk  
Ill whisk them up in no moonlight  
And though pigs can fly  
Theyll never find us  
Posing as the night  
And Im home before the morning  
But youre not a swallow
