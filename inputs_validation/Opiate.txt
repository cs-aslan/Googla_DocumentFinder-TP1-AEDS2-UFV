Choices always were a problem for you  
What you need is someone strong to guide you  
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow  
What you need is someone strong to use you  
Like me  
Like me  
If you want to get your soul to heaven  
Trust in me  
Dont judge or question  
You are broken now  
But faith can heal you  
Just do everything I tell you to do  
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow  
Let me lay my holy hand upon you  
My Gods will  
Becomes me  
When he speaks out  
He speaks through me  
He has needs  
Like I do  
We both want  
To rape you  
Jesus Christ why dont you come save my life  
Open my eyes blind me with your light now  
And your lies
