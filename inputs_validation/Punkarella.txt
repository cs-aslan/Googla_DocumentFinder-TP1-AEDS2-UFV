Dont you wish that your kids all looked more fine  
Do you feel that your guys below your style  
Animal slippers and a drink over Sunday mail  
Coffee teeth and a cigarette heart for sale  
Any minute now somethings gonna happen  
Everythings falling cept the shit you fell in  
  
Mailman black umbrella  
Doesnt feel the need to tell ya  
Sure have looked better  
And ego kissing fools  
Are teaching your kids in private schools  
Crack another bottle its five  
  
Monday morning who could ask for more  
Smoking buds got your friends all round next door  
  
Any minute now somethings gonna happen  
Everythings falling cept the shit you fell in  
  
Mailman black umbrella  
Doesnt feel the need to tell ya  
Kudzu Cinderella  
Them ego kissing fools  
Are teaching your kids in private schools  
Crack another bottle its five
