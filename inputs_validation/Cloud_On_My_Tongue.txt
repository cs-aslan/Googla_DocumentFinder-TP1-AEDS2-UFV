Someones knockin on my kitchen door  
Leave the wood outside  
What all the girls here are freezing cold  
Leave me with your Borneo  
I dont need much to keep me warm  
  
Dont stop now what youre doing  
What youre doing my ugly one  
Bring them all here  
Hard to hide a hundred girls in your hair  
It wont be fair if I hate her  
If I ate her  
You can go now  
  
Youre already in there  
Ill be wearing your tattoo  
Youre already in there  
  
Got a cloud sleeping on my tongue  
He goes then it goes  
And kiss the violets as theyre waking up  
  
Leave me with your Borneo  
Leave me the way I was before  
  
Youre already in there  
Ill be wearing your tatoo  
Im already in circles and circles and circles again  
The girls in circles and circles got to stop spinning  
Circles and circles and circles again  
Thought I was over the bridge now
