Ive been looking so long for you now you wont get away from my grasp  
Youve been living so long in hiding in hiding behind that false mask  
And you know and I know that you aint got long now to last  
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past  
  
Youre standing in the wings there you wait for the curtain to fall  
Knowing the terror and holding you have on us all  
Yeah I know that youre gonna scratch me maim me and maul  
You know Im helpless from your mesmerizing cat call  
  
Keep your distance walk away dont take his bait  
Dont you stray dont fade away  
Watch your step hes out to get you come what may  
Dont you stray from the narrow way  
  
Im running and hiding in my dreams youre always there  
Youre the Phantom of the Opera youre the devil youre just out to scare  
You damaged my mind and my soul it just floats through the air  
Haunt me you taunt me you torture me back at your lair
