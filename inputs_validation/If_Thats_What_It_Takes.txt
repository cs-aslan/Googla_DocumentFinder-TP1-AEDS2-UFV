Youre the bravest of hearts youre the strongest of souls  
Youre my light in the dark youre the place I call home  
You can say its all right but I know that youre breaking up inside  
I see it in your eyes  
Even you face the night afraid and alone  
Thats why Ill be there  
  
When the storm rises up when the shadows descend  
Every beat of my heart every day without end  
Every second I live thats the promise I make  
Baby thats what Ill give if thats what it takes  
If thats what it takes  
  
You can sleep in my arms you dont have to explain  
When your hearts crying out baby whisper my name  
Cause Ive reached out for you when the thunder is crashing up above  
Youve given me your love  
When your smile like the sun that shines through the pain  
Thats why Ill be there  
  
When the storm rises up when the shadows descend  
Every beat of my heart every day without end  
I will stand like a rock I will bend till I break  
Til theres no more to give if thats what it takes  
I will risk everything I will fight I will bleed  
I will lay down my life if thats what you need  
Every second I live thats the promise I make  
Baby thats what Ill give if thats what it takes  
  
Through the wind and the rain through the smoke and the fire  
When the fear rises up when the waves ever higher  
I will lay down my heart my body my soul  
I will hold on all night and never let go  
Every second I live thats the promise I make  
Baby thats what Ill give if thats what it takes  
  
If thats what it takes  
Every day  
If thats what it takes  
Every day
