Just when I had the money to spend  
And I was always thinkin it would never end  
Then the time came to the end of the game  
Dont you know  
  
And just when the sky got shiny and bright  
There never seemed to be an end of the light  
But then the clouds came it started to rain  
Dont you know  
  
Just when it was goin  
Just when it was goin so good  
Just when it  
Just when it was goin so good  
  
Just when the highway straightend out for a mile  
An I was thinkin I just cruise for a while  
A fork in the road brought a new episode  
Dont you know  
  
Just when it  
Just when it was goin so good  
Just when it was goin  
Just when it was goin so good  
  
But baby dont you worry  
I said baby dont you cry  
Were gonna get it together  
And I know youre askin why  
  
Just when it  
Just when it was goin so good  
Just when it was goin  
Just when it was goin so good
