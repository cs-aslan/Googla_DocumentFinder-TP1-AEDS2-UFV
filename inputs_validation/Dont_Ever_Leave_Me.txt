Wake up every morning hearts full of pain  
Looked out the window and its pouring down the rain  
And I cry Baby oh baby  
Dont ever leave me again  
I miss your lovin your kisses too  
Aint nothin on earth I wouldnt do for you  
And I cry Baby oh baby  
Dont ever leave me again  
When rain starts falling  
And I start calling  
Oh baby how I love you  
My heart is cryin I feel like dyin  
Baby you know I want you so  
Tell me that youre mine till the end of time  
And I cry Baby oh baby  
Dont ever leave me again  
Dont ever leave me again  
When rain starts falling  
And I start calling  
Oh baby how I love you  
My heart is cryin I feel like dyin  
Baby ya know I want you so  
Tell me that youre mine till the end of time  
And I cry Baby oh baby  
Dont ever leave me again no  
Dont ever leave me again
