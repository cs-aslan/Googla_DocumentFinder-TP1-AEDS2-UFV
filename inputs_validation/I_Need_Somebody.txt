feat The Stooges  
  
But I am your crazy driver  
Honey Im sure to steer you  round  
I am dying in any story   
Im only living and when I sing this song  
just the same baby  
  
  
I need somebody baby  
I need somebody too  
I need somebody baby  
just like you  
  
  
But Im losing a lot of my feelings  
and Im running out of friends  
you know you lied to me in the beginning  
tried to bring me to the end  
  
  
I need somebody etc  
  
Well I was trying to leave this signal  
in a fury an it is too strong  
Yea I got my reputation  
write me anyway not too long  
  
I need somebody etc
