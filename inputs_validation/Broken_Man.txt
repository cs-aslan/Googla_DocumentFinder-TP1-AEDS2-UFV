Sitting by a broken window  
Up in a back room swallowing wine  
Gazing down a backstreet garden  
With my bed chair table and wine  
Looks like Im going no where but no wheres where I am  
Guess Ill always be a backstreet broken man  
Calling out my name and number  
As I was walking out of my cell  
Louie gave me back my wallet  
He nearly dropped my picture of Nell  
Drinking gets you nowhere but nowheres where I am  
Guess Ill always be a backstreet broken man  
Oh broken man oh yeah broken man  
Early on a Sunday morning  
As I was walking on down the lane  
Someone said I beg your pardon  
And I was sure I knew her name  
She was going somewhere but nowheres where I ran  
Guess Ill always be a backstreet broken man  
Oh thats where I am guess Ill always be a backstreet broken man
