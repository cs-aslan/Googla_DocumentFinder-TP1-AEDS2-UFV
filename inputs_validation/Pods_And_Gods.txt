Martian men are coming to Earth  
Theyre abducting all of the jerks  
Martian men are coming to Earth  
Martian men dont take me  
  
Pods are landing from outer space  
Pods are duplicating my face  
Pods are landing from outer space  
Pod thing leave me alone  
  
I dont know what conventions you go to  
I dont know what movies youve seen  
I dont want to hear explanations  
For unexplainable things  
  
Its not I dont believe in aliens  
Its just I really dont care  
I wouldnt mind some interplanetary friends  
Until they come and hang in my own atmosphere  
  
Holy ghost is coming to Earth  
Saving souls of all of the jerks  
The holy ghost is coming to Earth  
Savior men dont take me  
  
The number one son is flipping the tab  
Paying for sins and fun we all had  
The number one son is flipping the bill  
Let me chip in for the tip  
  
I dont understand why you beg for forgiveness  
Just before you do it again  
Is it more altruistic to worship  
Or actually help fellow man  
  
Its not I dont believe in Jesus Christ  
Its just I care about other things  
The world could certainly use some miracles  
Until then Ill put my faith in human beings
