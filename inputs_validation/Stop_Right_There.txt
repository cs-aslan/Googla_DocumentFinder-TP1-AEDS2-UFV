You have never changed your ways  
You think that you can own me like a slave  
And I want to walk away  
But every time I try youre in my face  
You say I could have it all  
Trust you you will never let me fall  
And my heart feels bound to your control  
But my spirit says no no no  
  
Chorus  
Stop right there  
Suddenly temptations flying  
Everywhere  
And you think youve got me down  
Well think again Im not your friend  
Its plain to see Im not your property  
Stop right there  
Suddenly temptations flying  
Everywhere  
And you think youve got me down  
Well think again Im not your friend  
Dont play with me Im not your property  
  
Ring Its you once again  
Begging me to listen to your plan  
But you see Ive found the truth  
Cause I have been redeemed and so were through  
You say I could have it all  
Trust you you will never let me fall  
I dont have to give into your demands  
The powers not in your hands  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont have to do anything you want me to  
I dont need you to make me feel like I want more  
Cause God has shown His love is your weakness  
He is above and beyond all you can do  
  
Chorus x2
