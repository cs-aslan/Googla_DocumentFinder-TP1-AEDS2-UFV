Everybodys waiting for something to happen  
Everybodys waiting for something to see  
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters  
Everyones waiting for news on TV  
  
Winding lives at the end of the spiral  
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill  
Everyones looking but no one is listening  
Everybody wants to be in at the kill  
  
I wait for the signs they tell me true  
I see the signs of the end of time  
  
Everyones searching but nothings revealing  
Everyones looking for the reason why  
Everyones hoping for life everafter  
Everyones looking at death from the sky  
  
Everyones nightmares are going to happen  
Everybodys ripping the mask from their eyes  
Everyones praying but no ones believing  
Everyones heroes tell everyones lies  
  
I wait for the signs they tell me true  
I see the signs of the end  
  
Chorus  
So I watch and I wait  
And I pray for an awnser  
An end to the strife and the worlds misery  
But the end never came  
And were digging the graves  
And were loading the guns for the kill  
  
Can the end be at hand  
Is the face in the sand  
Future memory of our tragedy  
Can the end be at hand  
Is the face in the sand  
Future memory of our tragedy  
  
Chorus  
  
Can the end be at hand  
Is the face in the sand  
Future memory of our tragedy  
Can the end be at hand  
Is the face in the sand  
Future memory of our tragedy
