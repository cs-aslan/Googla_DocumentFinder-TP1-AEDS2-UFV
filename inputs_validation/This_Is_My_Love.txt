Now Hollywood wants to make you think they know what love is  
But Im a tell you what true love is  
Love is not what you see in the movies  
Its not the ecstasy its not what you see in that scene  
You know what I mean Im telling you right now true love is sacrifice  
Always thinking my mind its waiting for you if you crossing the  
This love is true now are we alive  
And I know that you gone so gone  
The signs I got this feeling  
Cause what I found this is deeper than life  
I know that I get lost in this feeling  
I can see all in me all in me all in me  
  
Chorus x 2  
Ill put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love this is my love  
I know that Ill be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love this is my love  
  
Therefore a thought in my heart could that be searching for you  
An universe for 2 so please ride through  
Now Im away and you see that its fate its fate  
The signs I got this feeling  
Cause what I found this is deeper than life  
I know that I get lost in this feeling  
I can see all in me all in me all in me  
  
Chorus x 2  
Ill put you in front of me  
So everybody can see  
My love this is my love  
I know that Ill be alright  
As long as you are my guide  
My love this is my love
