I swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth  
So help me GOD  
I just felt like telling the story of my life  
Felt like maybe somebody could be inspired you know  
We all feel pain we all go through things  
But its time to overcome all that  
  
If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died  
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive  
I was born handicapped my arm wouldnt move  
They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude  
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks  
My moms had a miscarriage he didnt give a fuck  
He sniffed some coke come home  
Beat up on my moms cause shes talkin on the phone  
Come on  
  
Chorus  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
All I ever needed  
Was a father  
Was a father  
Thats all  
Thats all  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
All I ever needed was a father  
Was a father  
  
Moms got tired of the beatings said Yo we got to go  
Packed up her bags we bounced out the do  
She said I aint taking these whippins no mo  
I want to live to see my little Todd grow  
I remember tear drops on my pops face  
Looking down at me standing on the staircase  
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee  
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly you feeling me  
Im feeling you  
  
Chorus  
  
My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced  
Swigged some Jack Dan sniffed up a ounce  
Grabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens  
Possessed by a demon a devil it seemed  
I was too young to understand the risk  
When your moms come home off the midnight shift  
She turned around heard the shotgun click  
My pops said You think that you could leave me  
He blasted my moms in the back  
She fell down screaming I cant forget that  
My grandfather tried to close the do  
He got shot ten times in the stomach yo for real  
  
Chorus  
  
My head was spinning I had never seen blood  
Four years old this dont feel like love  
Anyway pops disappeared  
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years  
This therapist got up in her head  
Led her to believe without him shed be dead  
You know they fell in love with one another  
Everything seemed right thats word to mother  
Until I started getting beatings everyday  
Sometimes for going outside to play  
Late at night on my knees Id pray  
A young child wishing the pain would go away  
Dad where was you when he made me strip  
Beat with belts like a slave with a whip  
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow  
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo  
Thats just the tip of the iceberg look  
Its too long for a song but perfect for a book  
Word is bond thats real baby  
  
Chorus
