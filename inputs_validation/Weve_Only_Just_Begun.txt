Weve only just begun to live  
White lace and promises  
A kiss for luck and were on our way  
Weve only begun  
  
Before the risin sun we fly  
So many roads to choose  
Well start out walkin and learn to run  
And yes weve just begun  
  
Sharing horizons that are new to us  
Watching the signs along the way  
Talkin it over just the two of us  
Workin together day to day  
Together  
  
And when the evening comes we smile  
So much of life ahead  
Well find a place where theres room to grow  
And yes weve just begun  
  
Sharing horizons that are new to us  
Watching the signs along the way  
Talkin it over just the two of us  
Workin together day to day  
Together  
Together  
  
And when the evening comes we smile  
So much of life ahead  
Well find a place where theres room to grow  
And yes weve just begun
