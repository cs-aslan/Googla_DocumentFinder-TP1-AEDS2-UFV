Can you hear the people sing their song  
To tunes of glory they move as one  
Refugees of liberation marching on  
Sing your song rock the nation write of wrongs  
  
When you take a life and steal its shadow all thats  
Left is humanity  
  
Its getting closer change is bound to come  
Theres someone out there holding candles to the  
Sun  
Then an answer says that peace will come around  
Stand in line take your time and be proud  
  
Take a life and steal its shadow all thats left is  
Humanity  
Take a man and steal tomorrow all thats left is you  
And me  
  
Hear them call you soldiers all in the field of love  
Brothers sisters children all dying for love  
  
Refugees of liberation marching on  
Sing your song rock the nation write of wrongs  
  
Take a life and steal its shadow all thats left is  
Humanity  
Take a man and steal tomorrow all thats left is you  
And me  
  
Hear them call you soldiers all in the field of love  
Brothers sisters children all dying for love  
  
Hear them call you dying for love those who know  
You dying for love  
Brothers sisters dying for love saints and sinners  
Dying for love  
Dying for love
