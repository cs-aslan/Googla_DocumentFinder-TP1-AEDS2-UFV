Its so quiet in the ruins walking though the old town  
Stones crumbling under my feet I see smoke for miles around  
Oh its enough to make you weep all that remains of the main street  
Up in the park on Sunday dogs chasing and the children played  
Old man with his head down cant see nothing more around no  
  
But he remembers how it used to be back in the old days  
So nice to see you coming back in this town again  
Its nice to see a friendly face come peeping through having tea  
In the afternoon so nice to see you coming back in this town again  
  
Ah but its all changed winter turned on a man  
Came down on day when noone was looking and it  
Stole away the land people running scared losing hands  
Dodging shadows of falling sand buildings standing like empty shells  
And nobodyhelping noone else  
Young child with his hands high aint able to see no reason why no  
  
But he remembers how it used to be back in the old days  
So nice to see you coming back in this town again  
Its nice to see a friendly face come peeping through  
Youd better know what youre going through now  
You came back here to find your home is a black horizon  
  
That you dont recognize evil destruction has taken everything  
Youd better walk on the side while youre still walking  
Just keep on walking on down the street keep your distance  
From the people you meet  
  
Oh Lord and youd better watch your eyes  
Cause if smoke gets in them baby you wont rise again  
Wheres it leading to freedom at what cost  
People needing more and more and its all getting lost  
I want back I want back  
Back to the time when the earth was green  
And there was no high walls and the sea was clean  
Dont stop that sun to shine its not yours or mine no
