I could fall in love with the proper stranger  
If I heard the bells and the banjos ring  
If two certain eyes with the look of danger  
Smiled a welcome warm as spring  
If the beating in my heart  
Sounded out a warning  
Dont let her  
Dont let her walk through the door  
This is the one youve been waiting for  
Oh yes Id know  
However wild it seems  
You know Id know  
And Id whisper  
Come take my hand proper stranger  
Dont go through life as a stranger  
For Im a poor proper stranger too  
Dont let her  
Dont let her walk through the door  
This is the one youve been waiting for  
Oh yes Id know  
However wild it seems  
You know Id know  
And Id whisper  
Come take my hand proper stranger  
Dont go through life as a stranger  
For Im a poor proper stranger too
