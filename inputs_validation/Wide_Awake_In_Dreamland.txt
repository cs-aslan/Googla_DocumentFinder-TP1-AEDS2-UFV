Movin light dream machinery  
Crashin in through my balcony  oh no  
I shout down the line but could not get through  
Cause the telephone never rings when you want it to  
  
Ooh OohNow Youre Wide Awake In Dreamland  
Ooh OohNow Youre Wide Awake In Dreamland  
  
Words of love take your breath away  
Just a game that you like to play  oh no  
Sleepwalking through a world of pain  
Just another pretty face in the romeo rain  
  
Ooh OohNow Youre Wide Awake In Dreamland  
Ooh OohNow Youre Wide Awake In Dreamland  
Chemical decisions never turn out like you planned  
Now Youre Wide Awake In Dreamland  
  
Now Youre Wide Awake In Dreamland  
You know your paint by number life does not excite you  
Its a watercolor world that youre livin in  
And when you close your eyes at night  
Youre wonderin just where youve been  
  
You were young when you heard the call  
Saw it all in your crystal ball and chains  
A problem child who can pick and choose  
When the sandman calls your name you cannot refuse  
  
Ooh OohNow Youre Wide Awake In Dreamland  Ooh  
Ooh OohNow Youre Wide Awake In Dreamland  
Chemical decisions never turn out like you planned  
Now Youre Wide Awake In Dreamland  
In Dreamland  
In Dreamland
