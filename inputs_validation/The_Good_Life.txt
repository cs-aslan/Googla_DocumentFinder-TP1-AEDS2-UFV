When I look in the mirror I cant believe what I see  
Tell me whos that funky dude starin back at me  
  
Broken beaten down cant even get around  
Without an oldman cane I fall and hit the ground  
Shivering in the cold Im bitter and alone  
  
Excuse the bitchin  I shouldnt complain  
I should have no feeling cause feeling is pain  
As everything I need is denied me  
And everything I want is taken away from me  
But who do I got to blame Nobody but me  
  
And I dont want to be a old man anymore  
Its been a year or two since I was out on the floor  
Shakin booty makin sweet love all the night  
Its time I got back to the good life  
Its time I got back its time I got back  
N I dont even know how I got off the track  
I wanna go back yeah  
  
Screw this crap Ive had it I aint no Mr Cool  
Im a pig Im a dog so scuse me if I drool  
I aint gonna hurt nobody aint gonna cause a scene  
I just need to admit I want sugar in my tea  
Hear me Hear me I want sugar in my tea  
  
And I dont want to be a old man anymore  
Its been a year or two since I was out on the floor  
Shakin booty makin sweet love all the night  
Its time I got back to the good life  
Its time I got back its time I got back  
N I dont even know how I got off the track  
I wanna go back yeah  
  
I wanna go back I wanna go back  
And I dont even know how I got off the track  
Its time I got back its time I got back  
And I dont even know how I got off the track  
I want to go back yeah  
And I dont want to be a old man anymore  
Its been a year or two since I was out on the floor  
Shakin booty makin sweet love all the night  
Its time I got back to the good life  
Its time I got back its time I got back  
N I dont even know how I got off the track  
Its time I got back its time I got back  
N I dont even know how I got off the track  
I wanna go back I wanna go back
