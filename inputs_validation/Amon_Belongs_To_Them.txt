Today My Mother will return to My house  
And all the things Ive done  
Ive done to make her feel at home again  
Oh    its all part of an act  
She can stay as long as I keep the pact  
Theres someone ringing at My front door bell  
I see My Mother there  
Standing with the man I wanna send to hell  
Mother Oh King see who came along  
Ma You dont understand  
Its all part of the deal  
Theres no way I can let him inside  
You see AMON belongs to THEM  
Doctor You go ahead and have a talk with the boy My dear  
You better bring this along  
Something might go wrong inside  
Come on Mother let me show You the house  
Come on Mother theres a lot to discuss  
Mother Oh King please let him in  
Ma You dont understand  
Its all part of the deal  
Thers no way I can let him inside  
You see AMON belongs to THEM  
Now let Me tell You what Ive seen in the house lately  
Ive seen Your daughter here  
Coming and going when the dark is near  
You must never ever tell anyone what Ive told  
I have hear THEM singing too  
Hey Mother whats that for  
Oh I feel the needle piercing My skin  
And Im falling Yes Im falling down
