African moon  
Roll with the mighty waves  
Well be there soon  
Feel the winds as we sail on home to African moon  
African moon  
My heart beats like the drum  
Now it is noon  
Loved ones we left behind Ill see again  
African moon  
African moon  
I will see you once more  
Yes again Ill adore the real sound of the drum  
Oh yes Im sailing feel your hot sun  
African moon  
African moon  
Looking out to the sea  
A reunion therell be in the evening sun  
Oh theres a new life thats awaiting me  
African moon  
African moon  
This land is my rightful home  
Well never roam  
Youll weep fou your sons no more and daughters  
African moon  
Hold up your head  
One day youll be understood  
Stand and be proud  
Your sorrows are gone for good  
Hold up your head  
And youll be satisfied
