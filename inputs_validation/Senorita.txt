On that sunny day

Such a beautiful girl  
Walking down the street  
Seen those bright brown eyes  
With tears coming down  
She deserves a crown  
But where is it now  
Mamma listen  
  
Senorita I feel for you  
You deal with things that you dont have to  
He doesnt love ya I can tell by his charm  
But you could feel this real love  
If you just lay in my  
  
Running fast in my mind  
Girl dont you slow it down  
If we carry on this way  
This thing might leave the ground  
How would you like to fly  
Thats how my queen should arrive  
But you still deserve the crown  
Or hasnt it been found
