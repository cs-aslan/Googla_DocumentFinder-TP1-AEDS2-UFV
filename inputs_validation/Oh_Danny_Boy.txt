Oh Danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen and down the mountain side  
The summers gone and all the roses falling  
Its you its you must go and I must bide  
  
But come ye back when summers in the meadow  
Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow  
Its Ill be here in sunshine or in shadow  
Oh Danny boy oh Danny boy I love you so  
  
But when ye come and all the flowers are dying  
If I am dead and dead I well may be  
Youll come and find the place where I am lying  
And kneel and say an Ave there for me  
  
And I shall hear tho soft you tread above me  
And all my grave will warmer sweeter be  
For you will bend and tell me that you love me  
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me
