I see I hear its very clear  
Because the day has come when you have won  
Its myself I feel  
She calls me calls me the sun the sea yeah  
I know its not for today  
Its not for today its for you and me yeah you and me  
  
Alone in my room youre there on the floor  
Open up your eyes let me get inside  
Learned to love on TV  
Learned to come on TV  
Can I help you  
Can I guide you  
  
It amazes me how I broke free  
Then got brought back in  
Cause when the feelings there shattered and scared  
I know youve won goodbye Im gone  
  
Alone in my room youre there on the floor  
Open up your eyes let me get inside  
Said you learned to come on TV then hold on to me  
Can I help you Can I guide you
