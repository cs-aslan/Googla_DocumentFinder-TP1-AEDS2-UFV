Verse 1 NeYo  
I seen ya from across the way  
Lookin like a fantasy  
You know that I once said  
This is for the climax  
You can come and stay  
Im just tryin to think of how to say it  
Girl if you shot me down it would be wasteless  
Know youll get mad at me  
But I gotta tell you honestly  
I dont even wanna know you  
  
Chorus NeYo  
I dont even wanna know your name  
I just wanna put this thang on you if you want  
We aint gotta have a convorsation  
Or exchange information  
Cause I dont even wanna know you  
Just wanna hit it  
And quit it  
And get with it  
Can I put this thang on you  
  
Verse 2 NeYo  
Babe aint no reason to get mad girl  
Dont look at me like that  
I dont wanna disrespect you  
Im just tryin to let you  
Let me hit it from the back  
I just wanna skip this  
Convorsation we want nothing like were intrested  
Took a little pen and paper your number forget it  
Baby even where Im going I aint intrested  
Dont wanna know you  
  
Chorus NeYo  
I dont even wanna know your name  
I just wanna put this thang on you if you want  
We aint gotta have a convorsation  
Or exchange information  
Cause I dont even wanna know you  
Just wanna hit it  
And quit it  
And get with it  
Can I put this thang on you  
  
Verse 3 Snoop Dogg  
Im slick can I get it  
Im slick and Im smooth  
Ill break your back like that  
Yea I stick to the groove  
The mood is smooth the price is right  
I got a sweet rolled up and we can shake like dice  
Get in the car and get behind me  
And when were finished baby please dont try to find me  
Quit playin games we can play this thang the same  
Theres a couple things I wanna do to you before I become a stranger  
Dont wanna know you  
  
Chorus x2 NeYo  
I dont even wanna know your name  
I just wanna put this thang on you if you want  
We aint gotta have a convorsation  
Or exchange information  
Cause I dont even wanna know you  
Just wanna hit it  
And quit it  
And get with it  
Can I put this thang on you  
I dont even wanna know your name  
I just wanna put this thang on you if you want  
We aint gotta have a convorsation  
Or exchange information  
Cause I dont even wanna know you  
Just wanna hit it  
And quit it  
And get with it  
Can I put this thang on you
