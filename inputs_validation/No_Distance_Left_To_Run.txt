Its over  
You dont need to tell me  
I hope youre with someone who makes you  
feel safe in your sleeping tonight  
I wont kill myself trying to stay in your life  
I got no distance left to run  
  
When you see me  
Please turn your back and walk away  
I dont want to see you  
Cause I know the dreams that you keep is wearing me  
When your coming down think of me here  
I got no distance left to run  
  
Its over I knew it would end this way  
I hope youre with someone who makes you feel  
That this life is the night  
And it settles down stays around  
Spends more time with you  
I got no distance left to run
