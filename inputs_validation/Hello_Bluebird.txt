Hear that bluebird up in a tree  
Hear him what a song  
Joy hes bringing singing to me  
Singing all day long  
Goodbye to skies of gray  
For Im back home today  
All day long I jump and run about  
You can always hear me shoutin out  
Hello bluebird  
Got no time for blues or anything  
Im so happy I just want to sing  
Hello bluebird  
Blue skies sun shine  
Friends that are real  
Old folks sweetheart  
Oh how I feel  
Ill not go roaming like I did again  
Ill stay home and be a kid again  
Hello bluebird hello  
All day long  
I keep singing  
Hello Im glad I found you bluebird  
Make yourself at home  
No more blues  
Just because Im happy  
When Im around you bluebird  
No more need to roam  
Up above the sun is shining  
The World is ideal  
I just cant describe the marvelous way  
That I feel  
With nothing but the bluest skies above  
What a rosy future lies ahead  
Thank you bluebird  
Happy happy bluebird  
Mister Bluebird hello
