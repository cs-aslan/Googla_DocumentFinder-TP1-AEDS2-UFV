Clouds so swift the rain wont lift  
Gates wont close the railings froze  
So get your mind off wintertime  
You aint going nowhere  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my brides gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots  
Tail gates and substitutes  
Strap yourself to a tree with roots  
You aint going nowhere  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my brides gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
Well I dont care how many letters they sent  
The morning came and the morning went  
So pack up your money and pick up your tent  
You aint going nowhere  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my brides gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
And genghis khan he could not keep  
All his men supplied with sleep  
Well climb that hill no matter how steep  
When we get up to it  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my brides gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair  
Ooooo ride me high  
Tomorrows the day my brides gonna come  
Oooo are we gonna fly  
Down in the easy chair
