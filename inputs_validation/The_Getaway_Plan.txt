Hey Im the voice in your head  
A friend that you once left for dead  
  
Ive been busy did you miss me  
No youre not paranoid Im back to fill the void  
I think you understand Im the getaway plan  
The getaway plan  
  
Im the shiver that runs up your spine  
A strange kinda piece of your mind  
  
Youve been lonely Im the only  
I know your damaged goods  
You did the best you could  
I think you understand Im the getaway plan  
The getaway plan the getaway plan  
  
Can you feel me Can you reach me  
Ive lived a thousand lives feels like Ive just arrived  
I think you understand Im the getaway plan  
The getaway plan the getaway plan
