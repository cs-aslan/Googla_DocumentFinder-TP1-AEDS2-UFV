Im a wild child bright child  
Knocking at your door  
You though that you are done  
But now you want me even more  
Dum Dum  
  
I am star child big smile  
Living in LA Im coming over  
Baby you cant go to school today  
Dum dum  
Go to school today  
  
I belong to bygone era like Scarlett OHara  
The downtown singers  
I just wanna drink I just wanna drink  
  
I am a pop little singer  
Fambam zinger  
Mans field ringer  
From the Hollywood silver screen  
  
Into that something  
Something so beautiful  
Youll never be the same  
Born to die up fast  
  
Of living my world  
Youll be forever changed  
  
I am wild child sky high  
Lying on your floor  
I know I had a lot  
But baby wants a little more  
Dum dum  
  
In my white mint pink cigarettes  
From the store well make margaritas  
You wanna take a shot Dum Dum  
  
I belong to a bygone era  
Like the bugs in the long tipsy hair  
Cuz I am on the scene  
Yeah I am on the scene  
  
I am a bad jazz singer  
Living in the finger  
No matter what you linger  
Cuz you like me even when I am mean  
I am the Queen
