From a distance the world looks blue and green  
And the snow capped mountains white  
From a distance the ocean meets the stream  
And the eagle takes to flight  
From a distance there is harmony  
And the echo through the land  
Its the voice of hope  
Its the voice of peace  
Its the voice of every man  
From a distance we all have enough  
And no one is in need  
And there are no guns no bombs and no diseases  
No hungry mouths to feed  
From a distance we are instruments  
Matching in a common band  
Playing songs of hope  
Playing songs of peace  
There is the song of every man  
God is watching us God is watching us  
God is watching us from a distance  
Ohh God is watching us From a distance  
From a distance you look like my friend even though were at war  
From a distance I just cannot comprehend what all this fighting is for  
Its the hope of its the love of all its the heart of every man  
Its the hope of its the love of all it is the song of every man  
Oh God is watching us God is watching us From a distance
