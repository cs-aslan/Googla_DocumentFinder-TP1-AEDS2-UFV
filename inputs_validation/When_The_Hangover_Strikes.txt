When the hangover strikes  
And I open my post  
And the coffee is on  
And Im burning my toast  
  
I let the battle commence  
I see a sun in the trees  
And a draught at the door  
With my head in my lap  
  
Theres a day to explore  
But Im left without sense  
As the hangover strikes  
And I turn on the tap  
  
But the waters too loud  
And Im caged by the fact  
That the battles not lost  
Is it the hair of the dog  
  
Or the Baa of a Lamb  
In a sheepish attempt  
To be half of the man  
That I might be or was  
  
When the hangover strikes  
And a mirror reveals  
That its Midnight or bust  
And a drink does appeal  
  
Now the battle is won  
So the cure of the can  
Pours its heart out on me  
Though Im feeling locked up  
  
But I cant find the key  
Well no damage was done  
  
Poor poor poor poor shaken one  
Pour pour pour pour me another one
