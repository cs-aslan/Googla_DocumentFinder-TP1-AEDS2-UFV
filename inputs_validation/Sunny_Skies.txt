Sunny Skies sleeps in the morning  
He doesnt know when to rise  
He closes his weary eyes upon the day  
Look at him yawning  
Throwing his morning hours away  
He knows how to ease down slowly  
Everything is fine in the end  
And you will be pleased to know  
That Sunny Skies hasnt a friend  
  
Sunny Skies weeps in the evening  
It doesnt much matter why  
I guess he just has to cry from time to time  
Everyones leaving  
And Sunny Skies has to stay behind  
  
Still he knows how to ease down slow  
Everything is fine in the end  
And you will be pleased to know  
That Sunny Skies hasnt a friend  
  
Sunny skies sleeps in the morning  
He doesnt know when to rise  
He closes his weary eyes upon the day  
And throws it all away  
  
Looking at the snow and trees that grow  
Outside my window  
Looking at the things that passed me by  
Wondering if where Ive been is worth  
The things Ive been through  
Ending with a friend named Sunny Skies
