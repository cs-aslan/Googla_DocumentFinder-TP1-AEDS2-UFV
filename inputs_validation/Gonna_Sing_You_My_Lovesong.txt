You say shes been mad at you  
Then you say youll be patient ooh  
Still I see that she makes you blue  
Come on Ill give you consolation  
  
Gonna sing you my love song gonna bring you some light  
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
Gonna sing you my love song gonna make it all right  
Youre all I ever need my darling  
  
Just to be where you want to be  
So much fun we could have then hmm  
To be close for eternity  
What a miracle to happen  
  
Gonna sing you my love song gonna sing it for you  
Gonna give you sweet loving gonna give myself too  
Gonna sing you my love song when I think about you  
I know she doesnt make it easy  
Cause you dont please her like you please me  
  
Youre my life youre my angel  
Youre my first youre my last  
Would she care if you lingered  
For another night  
Want to hold you tight

Gonna sing you my love song gonna bring you some light  
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
Gonna sing you my love song gonna make it all right

Gonna sing you my love song gonna sing it for you  
Gonna give you sweet loving gonna give myself too  
Gonna sing you my love song when I think about you  
Youre all I ever need my darling  
And I would love to sing my love song  
For you
