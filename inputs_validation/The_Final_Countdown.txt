Verse 1  
Were leaving together  
But still its farewell  
And maybe well come back  
To earth who can tell  
I guess there is no one to blame  
Were leaving ground leaving ground  
Will things ever be the same again

Its the final countdown  
The final countdown  
Ohh

And still we stand tall  
Cause maybe theyve seen us

And things to be found to be found  
Im sure that well all miss her so
