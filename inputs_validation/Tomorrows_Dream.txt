Well Im leaving tomorrow at daybreak  
Catch the fastest train around nine  
Yes Im leaving the sorrow and heartache  
Before it takes me away from my mind  
  
Send me love and I may let you see me  
Send me hopes that can spin in my head  
But if you really want me to answer  
I can only let you know when Im dead  
  
When sadness fills my days  
Its time to turn away  
And then tomorrows dreams  
Become reality to me  
  
So realize Im much better without you  
Youre not the one and only thing in my heart  
Ill just go back to pretending Im living  
So this time Im gonna have to depart
