Have mercy on a poor boys heart  
Cause I got the key that can make your motor start  
Cant you love me  
Without messin me around  
You took everything I got then kick me when Im down  
Ooo got this funny feeling that you aint on the level  
I look into those eyes but all I sees the devil  
I heard through the vine that you may not be mine  
Dont lock me up  
I cant pay the fine  
Make up your mind before you make me lose mine  
Your loves got me doin time  
Have mercy on a poor boys soul  
Ive been down so long never thought I could feel so low  
First you love me  
Then you stab my back  
Close the door turn the key all I can see is black  
Ooo got this funny feeling that you aint on the level  
I look into those eyes but all I sees the devil  
I heard through the vine that you may not be mine  
Dont lock me up  
I cant pay the fine  
Make up your mind before you make me lose mine  
Your loves got me doin time  
Loves got me doin  
Loves got me doin time  
Loves got me doin  
Loves got me doin time  
So whats a poor boy supposed to do  
Ive done everything I can Ive been so true  
You got a mean streak  
Like an alley cat  
You sucked all the love from me like a vampire bat  
Ooo got this funny feeling that you aint on the level  
I look into those eyes but all I sees the devil  
I heard through the vine that you may not be mine  
Dont lock me up  
I cant pay the fine  
Make up your mind before you make me lose mine  
Your loves got me doin time  
Loves got me doin  
Loves got me doin time  
Loves got me doin  
Loves got me doin time  
Loves got me doin  
Loves got me doin time  
Loves got me doin  
Loves got me doin time

Loves got me doin  
Loves got me doin time  
Loves got me doin  
Loves got me doin time  
Loves got me doin
