I been north I been east to the California beach  
Theres only one place I know where to find you  
And you Southern girls got a way with your words and you show it  
You say hump and Ill jump  
You say go and I know waste no time gettin so close to you  
And you remember the way to find out that I wanted to thank you  
  
Chorus  
Oh baby needs some brand new shoes  
You get out on the street you got nothing to lose  
I feel your crazy and everyone says it  
Southern girls you got nothing to lose  
  
Ive been up Ive been down  
Ive been weak Ive been strong  
But Ive never met someone like you  
And youll never know that if I found you Id thank you  
You say hump and Ill jump  
You say go and I know waste no time gettin so close to you  
And all you Southern girls got a way with your words and you show it  
  
Chorus  
  
You might think this boy he loves you Southern girl  
You make it hard oh so hard  
I been north I been east to the California beach  
Theres only one place I know where to find you  
And you Southern girls got a way with your words and you show it  
  
Chorus
