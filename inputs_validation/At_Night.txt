At night  
On some dark quiet street  
Baby thats where we meet  
When day is through  
They say  
That our love isnt right  
So I wait for each night to be with you  
Till they realize  
Our loves not some passing phase  
Well just meet at night and pray there  
For better days  
I wait for the darkness to come  
Till we can walk in the sun  
Well meet at night  
I wait  
For the darkness to come  
Till we can walk in the sun  
Well meet at night at night  
At night come on come on now love
