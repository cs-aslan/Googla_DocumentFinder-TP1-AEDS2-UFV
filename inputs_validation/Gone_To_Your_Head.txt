Its on your mind but you cant say it  
Its in your eyes but you cant see it  
Its on your wrist but you cant time it  
Its off the top of your head but you cant wear it  
Its in your face its in your hands  
Its in the air but you cant breath it  
Youre not the one I used to know  
Gone to your head  
Its up your nose but you cant snort it  
Its down your throat but you cant suck it  
Its in your lap but you cant have it  
Its in your reach but you cant grab it  
And what if I said its in your head  
Youre not the one I used to know  
And what if I said its in your head  
Youre not the one I used to know  
Gone to your head
