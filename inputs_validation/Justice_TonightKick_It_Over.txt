Stay around dont play around  
This old town and all  
Seems like I got to travel on  
  
A lot of people wont get no supper tonight  
Justice tonight  
  
Runnin and a hiding tonight  
Justice tonight  
  
Remember to kick it over  
No one will guide you through Armageddon time  
Its Armageddon  
Its not Christmas time  
  
A lot of people  
A lot of people use a calculator  
A lot of people wont get no supper tonight  
A lot of people sittin down by the light  
  
The battle is gettin hotter  
Armageddon time  
Armageddon  
  
Remember to kick it over  
Armageddon time  
  
A lot of people aint got no supper tonight  
A lot of people got to stand out back
