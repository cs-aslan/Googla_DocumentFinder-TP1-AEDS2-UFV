De  
Com  
  
Cest si bon  
Lovers say that in France  
When they thrill to romance  
It means that its so good  
  
Cest Si Bon  
So I say to you  
Like the French people do  
Because its oh so good  
Every word every sigh every kiss dear  
Leads to only one thought  
And the thought is this dear  
  
Cest Si Bon  
Nothing else can replace  
Just your slyest embrace  
And if you only would  
Be my own for the rest of my days  
I will whisper this phrase  
My darling my darling  
Cest si bon
