Standing by the roadside  
Old newspaper in my hand  
Reading yesterdays headlines  
Nothing new I said its all the same  
Everywhere  
Im the fool of the year and Ive been waiting  
Twenty five years of anticipating  
Ive seen changes in my land  
  
People Im here to tell you  
Ive been around since the world began  
Well Mr Politician reform me if you can  
Im an antiestablishment man  
  
Im tired of your treating  
All of my children the same  
Everywhere  
Spending all that money  
On a stupid war in Vietnam  
When we need it at home  
  
People Im here to tell you  
I think its bout time that the world began all over  
Well Mr Politician reform me if you can  
Im an antiestablishment man
