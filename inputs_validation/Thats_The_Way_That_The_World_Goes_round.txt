I know a man whos got a lot to lose  
A pretty nice fella kinda confused  
Got muscles in his head thatve never been used  
He thinks he owns half of this town  
He goes out drinkin gets a big red nose  
Beats his old lady with a rubber hose  
Then he takes her out to dinner Buys her new clothes  
Thats the way that the world goes round  
  
Thats the way that the world goes round  
Youre up one day the next youre down  
Its a halfaninch of water and you think youre gonna drown  
Thats the way that the world goes round  
  
I was sittin in the bathtub just countin my toes  
When the radiator broke water all froze  
I was stuck in the ice without my clothes  
Naked as the eyes of a clown  
I was cryin ice cubes hopin Id croak  
When the sun came through the window the ice all broke  
I stood up and laughed I thought it was a joke  
Thats the way that the world goes round  
  
Thats the way that the world goes round  
Youre up one day the next youre down  
Its a halfaninch of water and you think youre gonna drown  
Thats the way that the world goes round  
  
Thats the way that the world goes round  
Youre up one day the next youre down  
Its a halfaninch of water and you think youre gonna drown  
Thats the way that the world goes round
