Im gonna search this town  
From door to door  
The love I crave  
I cant find no more  
  
I got to find my baby  
I declare I wouldnt no lie  
I aint had no real good loving  
Since that girl said goodbye  
  
You know I hate to see the sun  
Hurry to the west  
Cos I know my whole lifes  
Will be one solid mess  
  
I got to find my baby  
I declare that aint no lie  
I aint had no real good loving  
Since that girl said goodbye  
  
Yesl ever since the day  
That she said we were through  
Ive been nervous  
And shook up too  
  
I got to find my baby  
I declare I wouldnt no lie  
I aint had no real good loving  
Since that girl said goodbye  
  
Yesl I dont care if its the last thing  
I ever do in my life  
Im gonna find that little girl  
Make her my wife  
  
I got to find my baby  
I declare I wouldnt no lie  
I aint had no real good loving  
Since that girl said goodbye
