Venue after venue Ive been through  
Coming to the telly so I can bend you  
Send you to the store condoms and more  
Jealous females call you sluts and whores  
Could it be my hardcore metaphor  
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor  
Open up the Lex door  
Jump on in Im kind of tired  
Im a roll blunts while you spin  
You got your license right Alright no swerving  
Hair blonde out Madonna style like a virgin  
Splurging Dom P Rose  
Much foreplay thats my forte  
Niggas see the ring baguettes to death  
She looking for a man honey he just left  
Violate me he get beat to death  
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left  
Grand Marnier increase the don strength  
Two fourfifths within my arms length  
With a calm breath I say we gots to float  
Throw Little Cease the keys to the boat  
Tongue all down her throat you know the routine  
Got my dick large like Bruce Springsteen  
And you mean too eyes greenish blue  
Got the Coogi sweater with the bubble Fubu  
Beautiful thats how the night goes  
Get out them tight clothes  
Get in some night clothes  
I invite those girls that smoke lye  
Keep it real with you  
You keep it real with I  
We be tight like frogs ass  
Have you screaming Biggie Biggie give me one more chance  
  
Would you ride with me Yeah  
Would you lie for me Thats right  
Would you get high with me For sure  
Would you die for me No doubt  
Would you ride with me Yeah  
Would you lie for me Thats right  
Would you get high with me For sure  
Would you die for me No doubt  
  
These hoes dont treat you like I treat you  
Like my contacts I can see right through  
Dont they know me and you is stuck like glue  
Queen Bitch means number one and two  
Wifey yall aint got to like me  
Go head and act dumb youll just catch a hot one  
Yall know where Im from  
Bucktown lay your ass down  
You dont wanna play around with me  
Probably just mad because Frank chose me  
A fly cutie you just a groupie  
Girls call my telephone just to hang up  
While me and you is in the crib laying up  
Oh he aint tell you that we live together  
And that we gonna have a kid together  
Whatever me intimidated never  
Anything you give to him he give it right to Kim  
Anyway I fuck better than you  
Give head better than you pussy get wetter than you  
If I fuck another nigga dont mean nothing  
BIG is in my heart from the start  
Whether broke or rich Im a stay his bitch  
Chicks who used to be around where they at now  
See I dont care bout them other broads  
BIG kept it real with me and thats that  
  
Would you ride with me Yeah
