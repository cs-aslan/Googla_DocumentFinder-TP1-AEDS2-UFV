Ever since I was a young boy  
Ive played the silver ball  
From Soho down to Brighton  
I must have played them all  
But I aint seen nothing like him  
In any amusement hall  
That deaf dumb and blind kid  
Sure plays a mean pin ball  
  
He stands like a statue  
Becomes part of the machine  
Feeling all the bumpers  
Always playing clean  
He plays by intuition  
The digit counters fall  
That deaf dumb and blind kid  
Sure plays a mean pin ball  
  
Hes a pin ball wizard  
There has got to be a twist  
A pin ball wizard  
Sgot such a supple wrist  
  
How do you think he does it I dont know  
What makes him so good  
  
He aint got no distractions  
Cant hear those buzzers and bells  
Dont see lights a flashin  
Plays by sense of smell  
Always has a replay  
N never tilts at all  
That deaf dumb and blind kid  
Sure plays a mean pin ball  
  
I thought I was  
The Bally table king  
But I just handed  
My pin ball crown to him  
  
Even on my favorite table  
He can beat my best  
His disciples lead him in  
And he just does the rest  
Hes got crazy flipper fingers  
Never seen him fall  
That deaf dumb and blind kind  
Sure plays a mean pin ball
