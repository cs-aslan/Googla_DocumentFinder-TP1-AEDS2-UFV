Great hits of the sixties  
Look the ladys got a photograph  
Silver framed and velvet backed  
Well she took it quite a while ago  
Funny that she never let me know  
What does it matter to me  
If it doesnt show  
I just dont know  
Its only just a memory  
Just a little history  
Oh oh oh  
And now shes wearing satin shoes  
Gilded hair to pay the dues  
I guess that I should tip my hat  
I wonder if shed think of looking back  
What does it matter to me  
If it doesnt show  
I just dont know  
Its only just a memory  
Just a little history  
Oh oh  
In the parking lot late at night  
Paper straws never worked out right  
I knew I wanted to  
But didnt know why  
So I just said Hi  
Everybody sing along now
