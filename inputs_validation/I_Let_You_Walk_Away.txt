I believe that nothing lasts forever  
Promises wont help us stay together  
Life for us was never hearts and flowers my friend  
  
It seems we couldnt solve lifes problems  
Maybe its because we tried so seldom  
So much must change today  
That I can only hope and pray  
  
Chorus  
As I watch you leave the room that Ill see you very soon  
And its all that I can do to keep from running after you  
And though I wanted you  
I let you walk away  
  
Its just a simple case of heartache  
My hands begin to tremble and my knees shake  
Somewhere along the line I hope we can make amends  
  
I believe that nothing lasts forever  
Promises wont help us stay together  
You may come home one day  
Til then I only hope and pray  
  
Chorus
