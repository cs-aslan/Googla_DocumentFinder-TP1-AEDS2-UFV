Theres a secret that I know about the lady that I love so  
And Im the only one shes shown her secret to  
Shes gentle and shes kind  
Shes proper and refine  
But she lets down more than her hair  
Alone in our room  
  
Chorus  
Cause shes more than a lady  
And theres a fire that burns behind those eyes  
Shes more than a lady  
And every night when we lay down  
And she slips off her satin gown  
Oh she proves shes a lover in disguise  
Shes a lover in disguise  
  
When we go out somewhere  
The men may stop and stare  
But they see shes a lady  
So they leave her alone  
Shes more than she seems  
And in their wildest dreams  
They could never dream of what its like to take her home  
  
Chorus  
  
Shes a lover in disguise  
Shes a lover in disguise  
Shes a lover in disguise
