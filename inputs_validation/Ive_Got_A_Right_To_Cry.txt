Ive got a right to cry  
Ive got a right to cry  
All day I sing the blues  
Im in my lonely shoes  
  
Could you be so unkind  
I nearly lost my mind  
I wonder if you care  
My life is a sad affair  
  
My heart is aching and its breaking  
And I dont know what to do  
Sweetheart its all because of you  
  
You know youve done done me wrong  
Come on back home where you belong  
And in this reason why  
Ive got a right to cry  
  
Yeah my heart is aching Lord its breaking  
And I dont know what to do  
Sweetheart dont you know its all because of you  
  
You know youve done done me wrong  
Please come back home where you belong  
And in my reason why  
Ive got a right to cry  
Ive got a right to cry
