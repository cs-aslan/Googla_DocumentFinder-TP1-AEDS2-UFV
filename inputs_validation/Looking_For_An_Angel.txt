Sometimes its easy  
Its meant to be  
I dream of the moment  
Youll be with me  
  
Cause I wanna look down now  
I wanna get deeper  
Can you let me in  
To show me places  
To be my keeper  
Im waiting for my Seraphim  
  
Chorus  
Oh Im looking for an angel  
For an angel  
For an angel  
Yeah Im looking for an angel  
For an angel  
For an angel  
  
My heart is ready  
My mind is open  
My bodys aching  
I wait for you  
  
Cause I wanna rise up now  
Dont wanna be earthbound  
Reach up to the sky  
Into the distance  
And the future  
Its waiting for me in your eyes  
  
Looking for an angel  
For an angel  
For an angel  
Yeah Im looking for an angel  
For an angel  
For an angel  
Im waiting Im waiting for you  
  
Chorus  
  
And when good things are good  
I want to share them  
I dont want to be alone  
And when darkness falls  
Will you hear my call  
And show me the way back home  
  
Cause I want this life  
To be twice as nice  
With somebody by my side  
So I dream of things  
Like your golden wings  
When you carry me and fly  
  
Cause I wanna look down now  
I wanna get deeper  
Can you let me in  
To show me places  
To be my keeper  
Im waiting for my Seraphim  
  
Im looking for an angel  
For an angel  
Looking for an angel  
Yeah Im looking for an angel  
For an angel  
Looking for an angel  
  
Oh Im looking for an angel  
For an angel  
Looking for an angel  
Im waiting Im waiting for you  
Yeah Im looking for an angel  
For an angel  
Looking for an angel  
Im waiting Im waiting for you  
  
Im waiting Im waiting for you
