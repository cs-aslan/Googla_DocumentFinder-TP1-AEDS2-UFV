Ive got this good lookin woman back home let me tell ya  
She cooks good and she looks good and she just cant do no wrong  
She cooks me cornbread in the morning shes my dinner and my midnight snack  
She sits up and she begs and she even rolls over on her back  
  
CHORUS  
Please dont tell me thats the way that it goes cause Ive tried hard and I
know  
I aint been playin in your back yard cause I got my baby and she loves me
so  
  
She dont treat me mean and she loves my machine yeah  
I digs her cause shes funky and she sure keeps it clean now  
Im a loafer shes my chauffeur and she sure likes to drive me uhhuh  
I lay my life on the line and she steps right up besides me yeah  
  
CHORUS  
  
I dont have to sing the blues no more  
A girl like mine is hard to find for sure  
She lays it on me each and every night  
Shes my pleasure and my worlds delight  
  
I dont have to sing the blues no more  
A girl like mine is hard to find for sure  
She lays it on me each and every night  
Shes my pleasure and my worlds delight
