Ended up on a crossroad  
Try to figure out which way to go  
Its like youre stuck on a treadmill  
Running in the same place  
You got your hazard lights on now  
Hoping that somebody would slow down  
Praying for a miracle  
Wholl show you grace  
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas  
With a long journey ahead  
Seen a truck pull over  
God sent an angel to help you out  
He gave you direction  
Showed you how to read a map  
With a long journey ahead  
Said it aint over  
Oh even in the midst of doubt  
  
Life is worth living  
Life is worth living so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes doesnt mean you have to give in  
Life is worth living again  
  
Relationship on a ski slope  
Avalanche comin down slow  
Do we have enough time to salvage this love  
Feels like a blizzard in April  
Cause my heart is just that cold  
Skating on thin ice  
But its strong enough to hold us up  
Seen her scream and holler  
Put us both on blast  
Tearing each other down  
When I thought it was over  
God sent us an angel to help us out  
He gave us direction showed us how to make it last  
For that long journey ahead  
Said it aint ever over  
Oh even in the midst of doubt  
  
Life is worth living  
Life is worth living so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes doesnt mean you have to give in  
Life is worth living again  
Life is worth living again  
  
What Id give for my affection  
Is a different perception  
From what the world may see  
They try to crucify me  
I aint perfect wont deny  
My reputations on the line  
So Im working on a better me  
  
Life is worth living  
Life is worth living so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes  
Only God can judge me  
Life is worth living again  
Another day  
Life is worth living again
