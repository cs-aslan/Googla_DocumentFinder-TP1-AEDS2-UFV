Fool moon standing in the streets  
I know the time is near  
Incarnate power roaring from the sky  
Unrelenting forces blasting through the air  
Roaring thunder lift your hands and pray  
  
Running through the empty streets theyre looking for the fight  
Swords gleam in the light of moon the gods prepare to strike  
  
Chorus  
Metal invaders ready to strike  
A warning from hell be careful tonight  
  
Dark night overwhelming bright light  
See the demons fly  
Cant trust your senses fear youll have to die  
Super mighty shadows casting amplitudes to ears  
Sounds youve never heard that take you high  
  
Time has come for them to rise invasion is their doom  
Riding high on iron horses in the light of moon  
  
Chorus  
Metal invaders the gods on their ride  
Sworn to bring metal mayhem tonight
