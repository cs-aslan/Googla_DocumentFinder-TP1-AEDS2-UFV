Its like awaking from a dream  
All I remember is a lullaby  
I couldnt tell you where Ive been  
A thousand images just flutter by  
Takin my time  
In a white limousine  
If I was the King  
Shed be my Queen  
And my thoughts are growing louder  
And my mind has lost its way  
And the flames are getting higher evryday  
My mind is back behind my eyes  
And there before me sits a butterfly  
And as I watch she gently cries And as I watch she gently cries  
Can there be anyone wholl pity her Wholl pity her  
How many faces  
Have all of you been  
If I was the King  
Shed be my Queen  
And my thoughts are getting louder  
And my mind has lost its way  
And the flames are getting higher evryday  
My mind is back behind my eyes  
And there before me sits a butterfly  
And as I watch she gently cries And as I watch she gently cries  
Can there be anyone wholl pity her Wholl pity her  
How many faces  
Have all of you been  
If I was the King  
Shed be my Queen  
And my thoughts are getting louder  
And my mind has lost its way  
And the flames are getting higher evry day  
And the flames are getting higher evry day  
And the flames are getting higher evry day
