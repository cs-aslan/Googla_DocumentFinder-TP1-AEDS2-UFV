I didnt mean to turn you on no way  
Just wanna dance and sing my song oh okay  
Clocking in clocking out  
No I dont mind it at all  
Me and the danger dudes  
Were on the news so just dont bother to call because  
  
Its just a way to stay alive boy  
Its such a trip just to survive  
  
So its back back to dungaree high  
Just to get high back to dungaree high  
Just a great big boy  
With a teenyweeny alibi  
  
Just a soul on ice  
With a mirror and a blade  
And a pocket full of mice  
Cheap thrills done and the dirt cheap ants  
cause I got a headache in my pants  
  
I got a headache in my pants  
I got a headache in my pants  
I got a headache in my pants because  
  
Its just a way to stay alive boy  
Its such a trip just to survive  
So its back back to dungaree high  
Just to get high back to dungaree high  
Just a great big boy  
With a teenyweeny alibi  
  
Its just a way to stay alive boy  
Its such a trip just to survive boy  
Its just a way to stay alive boy  
Its such a trip just to survive boy  
Its just a way to stay alive boy  
Its such a trip just to survive  
Back to dungaree  
Back to dungaree  
Back to dungaree high
