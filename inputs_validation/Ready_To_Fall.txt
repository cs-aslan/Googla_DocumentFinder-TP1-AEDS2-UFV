I cant feel it  
I cant explain  
Whenever your eyes meet mine  
My heart spins in circles  
And I feel so spaced in time  
And now that were standing face to face  
Something tells me its gunna be okay  
  
Chorus  
And Im ready to fall in love tonight  
Ready to hold my heart open wide  
Cant promise forever but baby Ill try  
cause Im ready to fall  
In love tonight  
  
I know youve been watching  
Choosing your moment  
But Ive been dreaming of that day  
No one before you has gotten to me this way  
And now that were standing face to face  
Theres something I need to say  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge nothing is certain  
This I know  
Wherever were heading  
Im ready to go  
  
Cant promise forever but baby Ill try  
cause Im ready to fall in love tonight x3  
  
In love tonight  
In love tonight
