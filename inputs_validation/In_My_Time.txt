In my life theres places Ive seen  
Places Ive been in my life  
In my life theres things I have done  
Times I have won in my life  
  
Ships I have known  
Winds that have blown  
  
In my time were people who cared  
People who shared in my time  
Welcomed the good accepted the bad  
Enjoyed what I had in my time  
  
People Ive known  
Times on my own  
  
And now Im growing old  
In memory I can hold  
My picture book unfolds and I  
Can feel myself grow cold  
  
In my life theres times to forget  
Things to regret in my life  
May have done wrong but tried to do right  
I followed the light in my life  
But now the lights grow dim  
My days are closing in
