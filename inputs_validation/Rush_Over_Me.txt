You washed away my sad face  
And flooded all my empty space  
You take away lifes heartbreak  
And I know with you its gonna be okay  
  
Youre rushing through me like water from heaven  
I feel you moving through me like sand in the sea  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive youre the air in my atomosphere  
Finally I feel complete  
Cause you are rushed over me yeah  
  
Theres no more blindness  
When I cry Im smiling  
You kept me from dying  
And I know with you Ill keep on living  
  
Youre rushing through me like water from heaven  
I feel you moving through me like sand in the sea  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive youre the air in my atomosphere  
Finally I feel complete  
Cause you are rushed over me  
  
Its not enough  
Just holding on  
Before I met you  
I was lost  
Now that youre standing here  
I dont want you to go  
Cause I know that your love keeps me alive  
  
Youre rushing through me like water from heaven  
I feel you moving through me like sand in the sea  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive youre the air in my atomosphere  
Finally I feel complete  
Cause you have rushed over me  
  
Youre rushing through me like water from heaven  
I feel you moving through me like sand in the sea  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive youre the air in my atomosphere  
Finally I feel complete  
Cause you have rushed over me
