All the streets are crammed with things  
Eager to be held  
I know what hands are for  
And Id like to help myself  
You ask me the time  
But I sense something more  
And I would like to give  
What I think youre asking for  
You handsome devil  
Oh you handsome devil  
Let me get my hands  
On your mammary glands  
And let me get your head  
On the conjugal bed  
I say I say I say  
I crack the whip  
And you skip  
But you deserve it  
You deserve it deserve it deserve it  
A boy in the bush  
Is worth two in the hand  
I think I can help you get through your exams  
Oh you handsome devil  
Oh let me get my hands  
On your mammary glands  
And let me get your head  
On the conjugal bed  
I say I say I say  
I crack the whip  
And you skip  
But you deserve it  
You deserve it deserve it deserve it  
And when were in your scholarly room  
Who will swallow whom   
When were in your scholarly room  
Who will swallow whom   
You handsome devil  
Oh let me get my hands  
On your mammary glands  
And let me get your head  
On the conjugal bed  
I say I say I say  
Theres more to life than books you know  
But not much more  
Oh theres more to life than books you know  
But not much more not much more  
Oh you handsome devil  
Oh you handsome devil  
Ow
