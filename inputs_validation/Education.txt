Im questioning my education  
Is my education who I am now  
While youre deciding Ive been finding  
Looking around in the here and now  
  
If Ive been taught from the beginning  
Would my fears now by winning  
Im questioning my own equation  
Is my own equation relevant somehow  
  
The flags are waving the news is breaking  
See the man who cant pick out his own tie  
If Ive been taught from the beginning  
Would my fears now be winning  
  
A wild world figuring out the answers  
Ill be in my own dance and iiii  
Im questioning my education  
Rewind and what does it show  
  
Could be the truth it becomes you  
Im a seed wondering why it grows
