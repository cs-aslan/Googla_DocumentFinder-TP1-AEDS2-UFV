If its love that youre running from  
Theres no hiding place  
You cant run it you cant hide it you cant run it  
Love has problems I know but there problems  
Well just have to face  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
If you just put your hand in mine  
Were gonna leave all our troubles behind  
Were gonna walk and dont look back  
Dont look back  
And dont look back oh yeah yeah  
And dont look back baby  
Dont look back  
The places behind you let them remind you  
  
If your first lover broke your heart  
Theres something that can be done  
You dont run it you dont hide it you dont run it  
Dont end your faith in love  
Because of what hes done  
  
So if you just put your hand in mine  
Were gonna leave all our troubles behind  
Keep on walking and dont look back  
Forget about the past now  
Dont look back baby  
Keep on walking and dont look back Hmmm  
The places behind you let them remind you  
  
Love can be a beautiful thing  
Though your first love let you down  
Oh yeah yeah  
Cause I know we can make love bloom baby  
The second time around  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
So if you just put your hand in mine  
Were gonna leave all our troubles behind  
Keep on pushing and dont look back  
Now till I say we wont look back girl  
Keep on walking and wont look back  
Forget about the past now baby  
And dont look back  
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby dont look back
