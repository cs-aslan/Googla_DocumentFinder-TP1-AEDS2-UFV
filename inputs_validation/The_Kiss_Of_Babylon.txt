Twisted ways blackened nights  
Sin upon Sin gone is the light  
Doom shall befall them all  
A downward spiral they shall fall  
The Three all this they see  
As they try to pass Gods decree  
  
Worshiping the gods  
That demand lives and sacrifice  
None but the blood of infants will suffice  
Fallen sparrows fall as one into a grave  
They are the souls of living men  
That could not be saved  
  
Walking the land we see  
The sins of flesh and spirit flow  
Bodies entwined a serpents  
Lethal kiss of venom is bestowed  
Our lord watches them fall   
He stands above you all  
  
Son slaying father  
A Cains mark upon us all  
Babylons rising cast from heaven  
We see the angles fall  
When will the heavens be alight  
The seasons will reunite
