As we trudge along through the mud  
And we tried to call it home  
But we werent alright not at all  
Not for one second  
  
Never have been one to write it down  
Now I think I can  
I know Im stronger now  
Whos looking south  
Not me Im not looking back  
Im done denying the truth to anyone  
Cause Im alive  
  
You showed me how  
You seemed to find a hole  
But I just laughed and smiled  
Begged and rolled my eyes  
Even cried and  
Denied the truth to you  
Just like the truth to me  
Mostly lied  
  
Im not going to look back  
  
White it out like glittering wax butterflies
