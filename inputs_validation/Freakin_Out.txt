Its a scheme  
Theres a fiend  
Why is my head spinning round in my dreams  
Its a time and a place  
Why are all these lights popping up in my face  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
  
Theres a sign on the wall  
Theres a witch with a big crystal ball  
Theres an eye  
Theres a heart thats pumpin faster as we run through the park  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
  
Everyone looks very strange today  
All of their faces seem to be washed away  
  
Everyones talking I cant hear a thing  
Im on the moon why is the sky so green  
  
I think Im walking up the stairs  
While Im sitting right down in my chair  
I feel so light but Im not  
Everythings turning cold but its hot  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
  
Or are you freakin out  
Or are you freakin out  
Or are you freakin out  
Or are you freakin out  
Or are you freakin out  
Or are you freakin out  
Or are you freakin out  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out
