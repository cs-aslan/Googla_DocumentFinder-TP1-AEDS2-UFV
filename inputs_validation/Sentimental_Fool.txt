Surely you cannot be leading me on  
Well if thats so however can I love again  
How could I believe again  
How can I hold on  
Sentimental fool  
  
Knowing that fate is cruel  
You ought to forget it  
Yes I know its true  
Ive seen what love can do  
But I dont regret it  
Oh you silly thing  
Dont you see whats happening  
Youre better without it  
  
No thats not the case  
If you were in my place  
You never would doubt it  
  
Sentimental fool  
Who broke the golden rule  
You couldnt resist it  
Though its all in vain  
Id do it all again  
Just to relive a minute  
A woman in love  
Can make you feel good  
  
You know what youre living for  
Shell give you so much  
And keep you in touch  
With all thats worth living for  
Oh once she gets in  
Through thick and through thin  
Shell show you what livings for  
  
The rhythm of love  
It must go on  
Cant stop  
The beat of your heart  
Is like a drum  
Will it stop
