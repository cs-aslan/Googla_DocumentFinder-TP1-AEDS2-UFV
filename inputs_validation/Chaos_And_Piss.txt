I thought that you were driving but youve given me the wheel  
Theres rain clouds out there that you dont wanna feel  
Your angers like a razor blade its just too bloody real  
I thought that you would be here no I just dont get it  
Hey I also feel things more than I should  
I dont relax very often as often as I could  
I worry how the whole thing looks it doesnt look good  
But I thought that you would be here no I just dont get it  
And being clear gets too much for me just like it does for you  
Even though I want to I want to I dont  
  
I dont feel like calming down no I dont  
I dont feel like hiding out so I wont  
I cant turn the volume down so I sit here in this  
Chaos and piss watching the storm passing  
Storms are beautiful right here its beautiful  
  
I came all this way to be with you and youre already gone  
If I was a good friend I could right this wrong  
Id kick away your crutches make you walk on your own  
I really thought youd be here I just dont get it  
Though it looks warm in the rabbit hole I could go down with you  
Even though I want to I want to I wont  
  
I dont feel like calming down no I dont  
I dont feel like hiding out so I wont  
I cant turn this volume down so I sit here in this  
Chaos and piss watching the storm passing  
Its beautiful  
  
Im a willow tree you cant blow me over  
And my roots go deep in anger  
I wanna feel the wind as it whips me like a prisoner  
I wanna be here  
I wanna be here  
  
No I dont feel like calming down no I dont  
I dont feel like hiding out so I wont  
I cant turn the volume down so I sit here in this  
Chaos and piss watching the storm passing  
Storms are beautiful this life is beautiful  
It is
