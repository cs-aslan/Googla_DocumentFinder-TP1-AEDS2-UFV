Its very clear  
Our love is here to stay  
Not for a year  
But ever and a day  
  
The radio and the telephone  
And the movies that we know  
May be passing fancies  
And in time may go  
But oh my dear  
Our love is here to stay  
  
Together were  
Goin a long long way  
In time  
the rockies may crumble  
Gibraltar may tumble  
theyre only made of clay  
  
But our love is here  
Oh Our love is here  
but our love is here to stay
