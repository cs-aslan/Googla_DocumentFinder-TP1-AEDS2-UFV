I heard her sing in tongues of silver  
I heard her cry on a summer storm  
I loved her but she did not know it  
So I dont think about her anymore  
Now shes gone and I cant believe it  
So I dont think about her anymore  
  
If three and four was seven only  
Where would that leave one and two  
If love can be and still be lonely  
Where does that leave me and you  
Time there was and time there will be  
Where does that leave me and you  
  
If I had a buckskin stallion  
Id tame him down and ride away  
If I had a flyin schooner  
Id sail into the light of day  
If I had your love forever  
Sail into the light of day  
  
Pretty songs and pretty places  
Places that Ive never seen  
Pretty songs and pretty faces  
Tell me what their laughter means  
Some look like theyll cry forever  
Tell me what their laughter means  
  
If I had a buckskin stallion  
Id tame him down and ride away  
If I had a golden galleon  
Id sail into the light of day  
If I had your love forever  
Sail into the light of day
