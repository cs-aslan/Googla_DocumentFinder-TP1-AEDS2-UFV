Ah ah  
  
Ive seen it on your face  
Tells me more than any worn out old phase  
So now well go separate ways  
Never again we two  
Never again nothin I can do  
  
Like an image passin by my love my life  
In the mirror of your eyes my love my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
See it all so clearly  
Answer me sincerely  
Answer me sincerely  
Was it a dream a lie  
  
Like reflections of your mind my love my life  
Are the words you try to find my love my life  
But I know I dont possess you  
So go away God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only  
  
Ive watched you look away  
Tell me is it really so hard to say  
Oh this has been my longest day  
Sitting here close to you  
Knowing that maybe tonight were through  
  
Like an image passin by my love my life  
In the mirror of your eyes my love my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
See it all so clearly  
Answer me sincerely  
Answer me sincerely  
Was it a dream a lie  
  
Like reflections of your mind my love my life  
Are the words you try to find my love my life  
But I know I dont possess you  
So go away God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Yes I know I dont possess you  
So go away God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only
