Well theres a Peter Pan moon shepherds delight  
I got to dragon at noon yes and I won the fight  
Now I want my reward in heaven tonight just like you promised  
Angel of Mercy youll come to no harm  
Angel of Mercy theres no need for alarm  
The knight in his armor wants a night in your arms

And if I give up my sword wont you give me the right  
Sweet angel

Let the saxophone play us till the chorus of dawn  
All I need is a little oblivion you dont need protection  
Well now here come the moonlight down on your bed  
Angel of mercy let your heart rule your head
