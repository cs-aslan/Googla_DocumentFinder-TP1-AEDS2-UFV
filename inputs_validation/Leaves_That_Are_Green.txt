I was 21 years when I wrote this song  
Im 22 now but I wont be for long  
Time hurries on  
  
Chorus  
And the leaves that are green turn to brown  
And they wither with the wind  
And they crumble in your hand  
  
Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl  
I held her close but she faded in the night  
Like a poem I meant to write  
  
Chorus  
  
I throw a pebble in a brook  
And watched the ripples run away  
And they never made a sound  
  
Chorus  
  
Hello hello hello hello  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye  
Thats all there is  
And the leaves that are green turn to brown
