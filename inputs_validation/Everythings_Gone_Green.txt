Help me somebody help me  
I wonder where I am  
I see my future before me  
Ill hurt you when I can  
It seems like Ive been here before  
  
Confusion sprung up from devotion  
A halo that covers my eyes  
It sprung from this first estrangement  
No one have I ever despised  
Is this the way that you wanted to pay  
Wont you show me please show me the way  
Is this the way that you wanted to pay  
Wont you show me please show me the way
