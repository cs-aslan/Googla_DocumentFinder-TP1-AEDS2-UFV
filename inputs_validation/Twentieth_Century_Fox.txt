Well shes fashionably lean  
And shes fashionably late  
Shell never wreck a scene  
Shell never break a date  
But shes no drag  
Just watch the way she walks  
Shes a twentieth century fox  
Shes a twentieth century fox  
No tears no fears  
No ruined years no clocks  
Shes a twentieth century fox oh yeah  
Shes the queen of cool  
And shes the lady who waits  
Sent to manless school  
It never hesitates  
She wont waste time  
On elementary talk  
Cause shes a twentieth century fox  
Shes a twentieth century fox  
Got the world locked up  
Inside a plastic box  
Shes a twentieth century fox oh yeah  
Twentieth century fox oh yeah  
Twentieth century fox  
Shes a twentieth century fox
