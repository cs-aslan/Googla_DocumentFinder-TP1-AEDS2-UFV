Its been a long time coming  
Ye its been a long time coming  
But you know you had it coming  
You know you had it coming  
  
Everyones running from something but we dont know when its coming  
So we keep running and running  
  
Now Im looking up the bible trying to find a Loophole  
Ye Im living for revival dying for a new soul  
Now theres no light to guide me on my way home  
Now theres no time to shine my rusty halo  
  
Its been a long time coming  
Ye its been a long time coming  
Its been a long time coming  
Been so long but I gotta Shine my Rusty halo  
  
Now Im running for the light in the tunnel but its just the train  
Ye Im looking for the right type of pleasure but all I find is pain  
Now theres no light to guide me on my way home  
Now theres no time to shine my rusty halo  
  
Its been a long time coming  
Ye its been a long time coming  
Its been a long time coming  
Been so long but I gotta Shine my Rusty halo  
  
Everyones running from something but we dont know when its coming  
So we keep running and running
