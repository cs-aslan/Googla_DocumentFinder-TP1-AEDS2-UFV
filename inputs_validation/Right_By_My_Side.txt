It all comes down to this  
I miss your morning kiss  
I wont lie Im feeling it  
You dont know Im missing it

Its too much to hold it in  
I cant say no more than this  
I just hope your heart hear me now

You own my heart he just renting  
Dont turn away pay attention

Lets meet at our favorite spot  
You know the one right around the block  
From a nice place that you love to shop  
Can you get away  
Care to sit down lets talk it out  
One on one without a crowd  
I wanna hold your hand  
Make you laugh again I need to be near you  
Gotta let you know how Im feeling  
Own my heart and she just renting  
Dont turn away pay attention  
Im pouring out my heart girl

I only argue wit em when the Lakers on  
Other than that Im getting my Marc Jacobs on  
When my pussy game so cold that he always seem to come back  
Cause he know that itd be a wrap  
When Im riding it from the back  
Wait oh let me see your phone  
Cause all them bitches is ratchet  
And let me get in my truck  
Cause all them bitchesll catch it  
Wait wait wait there I go again

Man this shit that we be fighting over so irrelevant  
I dont even remember though I was probably hella bent lets go
