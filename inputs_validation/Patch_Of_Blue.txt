Going to Terry Town  
Everybody knows me there  
Ive been away too long  
In a concrete world  
Where no one cares  
  
So you say that  
You gotta be lonely  
Its a sign that  
Can never change  
  
Ill paint a patch of blue  
On the weather beaten  
Skies for you  
Ill make the sun come  
Through for you girl  
You know I will  
You know I will  
  
If you believe in love  
Take my hand and come along  
Lonlieness never ends when youre  
Living where you cant belong  
  
Set your mind for  
A chance to be happy  
Let your heart find  
A way to love  
  
Ill paint a patch of blue  
On the weather beaten  
Skies for you  
Ill make the sun come  
Through for you girl  
You know I will  
You know I will  
  
Ill paint a patch of blue  
On the weather beaten  
Skies for you  
Ill make the sun come  
Through for you girl  
You know I will I will  
  
Ill paint a patch of blue  
On the weather beaten  
Skies for you  
Ill make the sun come  
Through for you girl  
You know I will  
You know I will  
  
Oh Ill paint a  
Patch of blue on the  
Weather beaten skies for you
