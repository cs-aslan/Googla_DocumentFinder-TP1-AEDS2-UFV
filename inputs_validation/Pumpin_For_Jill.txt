When Im asleep you touch my feet  
You let me know that I am no creep  
Because I love you you are for real  
Im gonna stay here pumping for Jill  
In the gas station where I work  
Everyone treats me just like a jerk  
Nobody offers me a tip  
Im gonna stay here pumping Jills hips  
  
I met you out at the Mardi Gras  
On a French Quarter sidewalk  
When you kissed me it was strong  
I wonder if youll hear this song
