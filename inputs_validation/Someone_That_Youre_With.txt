I reside in 209 youre in 208  
You moved in last Friday night  
And I just couldnt wait  
So I tried to call across the hall to ask you out someday  
But a lineup formed outside your door  
And I was way too late  
  
Well Id rather start off slow  
This whole things like some sort of race  
Instead of winning what I want Im sitting here in second place  
  
Chorus  
Because somewhere the one I want to be withs with somebody else  
Oh god I want to be that someone that youre with  
I want to be that someone that youre with  
And I can talk about it all day long till I run out of breath  
But I still want to be that someone that youre with  
Ive got to be that someone that youre with  
And Im pacing by the phone  
Cause I hate to be alone  
And if youre out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss  
God I want to be that someone that youre with  
  
Well I hear your favorite songs you sing along with everyday  
And I borrow things that I dont need for conversation sake  
Last night I heard your key it hit your lock at four AM  
Instead of being out with me you must be out with them  
  
Well Id rather start off slow  
This whole things like some sort of race  
Instead of winning what I want Im sitting here in second place  
  
Chorus  
  
Well somewhere the one I want to be withs with somebody else  
Oh god I want to be that someone that youre with  
And I can talk about it all day long till I run out of breath  
But I still want to be that someone that youre with  
Ive got to be that someone that youre with  
And Im pacing by the phone  
Cause I hate to be alone  
And if youre out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss  
God Ive got to be that someone that  
I want to be that someone that  
Ive got to be that someone that youre with
