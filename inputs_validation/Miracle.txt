Its taken much too long  
To get it right  
Would it be so wrong  
To maybe find someone  
A miracle  
  
And all you really need  
Is everything you could never be  
And so youd give it all  
For a miracle  
  
Chorus  
Is there a trace  
Inside her face  
Of a lonely miracle  
And so you wait  
And lie awake  
For a lonely miracle  
  
You never really know  
What it is  
Not until it goes  
And if it comes again  
Its a miracle  
  
But what you miss is love  
In everything below and up above  
And could she bring it all  
A miracle  
  
Chorus  
  
All you wanted was a miracle  
All you needed was a miracle  
A miracle  
And all you wanted was a miracle  
All you needed was a miracle  
A miracle  
  
Its taken so long to get it right  
Could it be so wrong  
To maybe find someone  
A miracle  
  
Chorus
