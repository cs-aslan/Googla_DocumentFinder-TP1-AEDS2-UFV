It wasnt me who shamed you its not fair to say that  
You wanted to work I gave you a chance at that  
It wasnt me who hurt you thats more credit than Im worth  
Dont threaten me with the things youll do to you  
  
It wasnt me who shamed you it wasnt me who brought you down  
You did it to yourself without any help from me  
It wasnt me who hurt you I showed you possibilities  
The problems you had were there before you met me  
  
I didnt say this had to be  
You cant blame these things on me  
It wasnt me it wasnt me it wasnt me  
I know shes dead it wasnt me  
  
It wasnt me who changed you you did it to yourself  
Im not an excuse for the hole that you dropped in  
Im not simple minded but Im no father to you at all  
Death exists but you do things to yourself  
  
I never said give up control  
I never said stick a needle in your arm and die  
It wasnt me it wasnt me it wasnt me  
I know hes dead but it wasnt me  
  
It wasnt me who shamed you who covered you with mud  
You did it to yourself without any help from me  
You act as if I couldve told you or stopped you like some god  
But people never listen and you know that thats a fact  
  
I never said slit your wrists and die  
I never said throw your life away  
It wasnt me it wasnt me it wasnt me  
Youre killing yourself  you cant blame me
