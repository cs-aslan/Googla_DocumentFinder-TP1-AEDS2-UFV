Black night is not right  
I dont feel so bright  
I dont care to sit tight  
Maybe Ill find on the way down the line  
that Im free free to be me  
Black night is a long way from home  
  
I dont need a dark tree  
I dont want a rough sea  
I cant feel I cant see  
Maybe Ill find on the way down the line  
that Im free free to be me  
Black night is a long way from home  
  
Black night black night  
I dont need black night  
I cant see dark night  
Maybe Ill find on the way down the line  
that Im free free to be me  
Black night is a long way from home
