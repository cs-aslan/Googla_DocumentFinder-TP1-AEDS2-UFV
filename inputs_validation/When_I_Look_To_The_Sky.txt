When it rains it pours and opens doors  
And floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry  
And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love  
That have to say goodbye  
  
And as I float along this ocean  
I can feel you like a notion that wont seem to let me go  
  
Cause when I look to the sky something tells me youre here with me  
And you make everything alright  
And when I feel like Im lost something tells me youre here with me  
And I can always find my way when you are here  
  
And every word I didnt say that caught up in some busy day  
And every dance on the kitchen floor we didnt dance before  
And every sunset that well miss Ill wrap them all up in a kiss  
And pick you up in all of this when I sail away  
  
Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead  
Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly  
But with you I can spread my wings  
To see me over everything that life may send me  
When I am hoping it wont pass me by  
  
And when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me  
There you are to show me
