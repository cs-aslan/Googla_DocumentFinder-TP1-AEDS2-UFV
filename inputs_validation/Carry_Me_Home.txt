Let me out  
Dont tell me everything  
Start it out  
Like any other day  
Must have gave the wrong impression  
Dont you understand where I belong  
Im not the one  
  
Stand again  
They say nothing comes for free  
And thats the truth  
Ive been living in a fantasy  
Slip and slide ahead trip heaven  
Selfdenial is such a wonderful and powerful thing  
But Im not the one  
  
The morning dove sings with two broken wings  
Carry me home Im not afraid  
The stars in my eyes with shimmering lights  
Carry me home dont let me fade away  
  
Stop the press the kids light is growing dim  
It took a month long slide then the world came caving in  
When you selfdestruct you wind up looking for a glimmer of hope  
But the writings on the wall  
Im not the one  
  
The morning dove sings with two broken wings  
Carry me home Im not afraid  
The stars in my eyes with shimmering lights  
Carry me home dont let me fade  
  
Just how thick is your skin away  
Just how sharp are your teeth  
Oh youve got a lot to learn  
Is there somewhere else that I can win  
Is there something else to start over again  
From the summits edge to the cutting room floor  
I will be afraid no more no more  
  
The morning dove sings with two broken wings  
Carry me home Im not afraid  
The stars in my eyes with shimmering lights with shimmering lights  
Carry me home dont let me fade  
Carry me home carry me
