Heres to the few Who fared my love  
Only for you I cared my love  
Ive given it hope and I know its only you  
Encased in silence  
  
Heres to the you who saved my love  
Only to you I gave my love  
Ive given it thought and its not all that appears  
  
Chorus  
Lea how long will you still want me to want you  
In and around you  
Lea my concertina  
Will you still want me to want you  
  
Heres to the you who dared my love  
Only with you I shared my love  
Ive given it though and its not all that appears  
  
Chorus  
  
Who cares what the cynics say  
I care if only youre on your way  
Lea dont let the same be true  
Lea do you still want me to want you
