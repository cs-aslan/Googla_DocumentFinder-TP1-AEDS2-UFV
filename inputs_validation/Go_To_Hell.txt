Now if your mind lies in the Devils workshop  
And evildoins your thrill  
And trouble and mischief is all you live for  
You know darn well  
That youll go to Hell  
  
So youre living high and mighty  
Rich off the fat of the land  
Just dont dispose of your natural soul  
Cause you know darn well  
That youll go to Hell  
  
I say Hell  
Where your natural soul burns  
Hell  
Where you pay for your sins  
Hell  
Keep your children from wrongdoing  
Cause you know darn well  
That theyll go to Hell  
  
I say Hell  
Man woman were created  
Hell  
To live for eternity  
Hell  
With an apple they ate from the tree of hate  
So you know darn well  
That they went to Hell  
  
Now Satan was an angel in Heaven  
But he stirred up trouble and woe  
So the Lord commanded that the Devil be branded  
So you know darn well  
He went to Hell  
Yeah he went to Hell  
Yeah he went to Hell  
He went to Hell
