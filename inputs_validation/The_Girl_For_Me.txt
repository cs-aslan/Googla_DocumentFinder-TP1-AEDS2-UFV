The way you hold me tight the way you kiss goodnight  
And every time we dance my heart goes in a trance  
Youre something special oh so special  
Youre the girl for me  
The way you fix your hair the way you choose your clothes  
And every time you smile your lovely dimple shows  
Youre something special oh so special  
Youre the girl for me  
Anything you ask me I will do  
Anything at all Ill do for you  
The way you like to laugh at things we used to do  
And even when Im sad you make me happy too  
Youre something special oh so special  
Youre the girl for me
