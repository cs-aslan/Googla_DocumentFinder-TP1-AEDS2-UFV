It was 815  
When I pulled into the 7 Eleven  
I bought a 12 ounce coffee  
And I threw down a 357  
  
I guess I was thinking I would never be found  
Next thing I knew I was spreadeagle  
Down on the ground  
  
I just fell into a manic depression  
And I really want to spend it with you  
  
I got pretty paper shoes  
And Im weaving you a basket for Christmas  
Three hots and a cot  
And a cellmate who keeps calling me missus  
  
But I like to think Im the king of the couch  
And I like my shrink  
Cause he always brings me smoke in a pouch  
  
I just fell into a manic depression  
And I really want to spend it with you  
  
We dont have any inhibitions  
Were not consumed by ambition  
Weve got no mission control  
  
They say Dr Freud might call me an anal retentive  
But my PO says Im delinquent and I got no incentive  
  
Rehab is a thing of the past  
I step into the cab and say Hey buddy step on the gas  
  
Just fell into a manic depression  
And I really want to spend it with you  
  
Okay ladies its time for your medication
