Used to be so easy to give my heart away  
But I found out the hard way  
Theres a price you have to pay  
I found out that love was no friend of mine  
I should have known time after time  
  
So long it was so long ago  
But Ive still got the blues for you  
  
Used to be so easy to fall in love again  
But I found out the hard way  
Its a road that leads to pain  
I found that love was more than just a game  
Youre playin to win  
But you lose just the same  
  
So long it was so long ago  
But Ive still got the blues for you  
  
So many years since Ive seen your face  
Here in my heart theres an empty space  
Where you used to be  
  
So long it was so long ago  
But Ive still got the blues for you  
  
Though the days come and go  
There is one thing I know  
Ive still got the blues for you
