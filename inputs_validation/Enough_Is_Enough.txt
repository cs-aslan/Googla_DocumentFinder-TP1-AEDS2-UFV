I dont care what you say to me  
Im gonna try and kick you outta my door  
Aint no use entertaining me  
Or paint your pretty little face for me  
You dont like rock you dont like roll  
You dont like rock and roll no more  
Ive had enough I cant anymore  
Enough is enough I cant stand no more  
Enough is enough  
  
I dont care what you say to me  
I never get the message through when I call  
What you do is a shame to see  
Making plans of your own for me  
You dont know where you dont know when  
You dont know where or where or when  
Oh I dont care what you say to me  
Im gonna kick you outta my door  
Enough is enough and I have had it  
Ive had enough I cant anymore  
Enough is enough I cant stand no more  
Enough is enough I cant anymore  
Enough is enough  
  
Oh I dont care what you say to me  
Youre gonna be back banging round at my door  
What you say is all the same to me  
Making plans of your own for me  
You dont know where you dont know when  
You dont know where or where or when  
Ive had enough I cant anymore  
Enough is enough I cant stand no more  
Enough is enough I cant anymore  
Enough is enough I cant stand no more  
Enough is enough I cant anymore  
Enough is enough
