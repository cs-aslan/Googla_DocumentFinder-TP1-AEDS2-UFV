Let me take you to the place  
Where memberships a smiling face  
Brush shoulders with the stars  
Where strangers take you by the hand  
And welcome you to wonderland  
From beneath their panamas  
  
Chorus  
Club Tropicana drinks are free  
Fun and sunshine theres enough for everyone  
All thats missing is the sea  
But dont worry you can suntan  
  
Castaways and Lovers meet  
Then kiss in Tropicanas heat  
Watch the waves break on the bay  
Soft white sands a blue lagoon  
Cocktail time a summers tune  
A whole nights holiday  
  
Chorus  
  
Pack your bags  
And leave tonight  
Dont take your time  
Gotta move your feet dont you miss the flight  
Cool cool cool cool  
  
Chorus  
  
Cool cool cool cool
