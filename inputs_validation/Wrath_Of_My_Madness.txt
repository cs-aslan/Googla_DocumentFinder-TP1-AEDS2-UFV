My mellow Latee was kicking flavor  
The RE posse said Yo Latifah we can do this  
So I paused in the thought and in my brillance I caught  
And I agreed because I already knew this  
Now you should want to flex cause Im in full effect  
Queen Latifah is fiveoh on this set  
Youve been begging and dying for somebodys rhyming to set you free  
For God so loved the world he gave to me  
Im coolin teaching those needing schoolin  
The mic this mic in my hand Im rulin  
So prepare your mind for my lifeline  
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness  
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water  
And dive into the wrath of my madness  
Latifah rasta chorus  
Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way  
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way  
Some MCs have gold and African vein  
And using each other to compete with  
Their subjects I pity because their rhymes are not witty like mine  
To write a rhyme so delicious you can eat it  
There are those who like my taste but dont consider biting  
Theres penalties for those who dont do writing just be reciting  
Everyone elses word that took a lot of thinking  
Its not my fault your thoughts are shrinking  
while mine are growing yes you know like all the woman inside of me  
Despite what you do or say and even in spite of me  
Brothers catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks  
Dying to have a lover of my likeness  
So release all your shyness call me Your highness  
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness  
Latifah rasta chorus  
Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way  
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way  
Word of mouth is always everlasting  
And everlasting are the words that I bring  
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey  
And music is made by Mark the 45 King  
You tremble for my treble youre begging for the bass  
The voice is too vicious the same as the pace  
The crowds they love me they give only hugs  
The shrinkedtofit buttonflies fit quite snug  
As a bug you know why Because Im bugging  
Of the beats that DJ Mark is loving  
So plex on the sounds that Im pumping  
Im jumping with the energy to turn your mind to gladness  
Come on just get into it dont lie and say youve been through it  
Feel the wrath of my madness  
More rasta singing  
I scene is mine cause I took it  
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun  
Dont step up in my face you dont want to feel the taste  
Dont try and play me out cause I am not the one  
Brothers on my brastrap sisters clocking my sound why  
Because they want to be down with the  
Queen LATIFAH in command  
I supply the concept for you to understand  
For those who want to bite dont make me have to fuss  
The only thing you get is the gluteous maximus  
Suckers on the tip youre loving me youre leaving me  
You wish that one day you could have this  
Come on you know the time just be thankful for the rhyme  
And get up on the wrath of my madness  
Extended ragga outro
