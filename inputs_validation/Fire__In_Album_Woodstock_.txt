yeah thank you very much Id like to do this song dedicated  
To maybe A soldier in the army Singin about his old lady that  
He dreams about and humpin A machine gun instead or it could be  
Could be A cat maybe tryin to fall in love with that girl baby  
But A little bit too scared Thats where the problems come from  
Sometimes isnt it I meen the cat is really insecure A little bit  
So the call girls groupies and they call girls this And they call  
Passive people hippies and bla bla woof woof all down the line  
Thats because their not in love man thats whats happening Thats  
The other half of A man is woman And wed like to play A thing called  
Izabella and dont you ever forget it
