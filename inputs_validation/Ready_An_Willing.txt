I want to be loved  
Dont want to be teased  
I dont want no woman  
Getting down on her knees  
  
Im ready an willing  
To reach for the sun  
So I can get me some loving  
Before Im gone  
  
I want more more more more  
I want some more  
Sweet satisfaction to soothe my soul  
  
I want you to rock me  
All night long  
Rope an ride me baby  
Do me wrong  
  
Roll me over make be bleed  
Id dance with the devil  
To get what I need  
I need more more more more  
I need some more of that  
Sweet satisfaction to soothe my soul  
  
I get this crazy feeling inside my soul  
And its driving me insane  
I get this crazy feeling  
Can you feel it baby  
Its driving me out of my mind  
Im talking about sweet satisfaction  
Im ready an willing sweet satisfaction  
Im ready an willing sweet satisfaction  
Sweet satisfaction sweet satisfaction  
Im ready an willing  
  
I get this crazy feeling inside my soul  
And its driving me insane  
I get this crazy feeling  
Can you feel it baby  
Its driving me out of my mind  
I keep on looking for  
  
Sweet satisfaction Im ready an willing  
Sweet satisfaction Im ready an willing  
Sweet satisfaction I keep on looking
