You put your best red dress on  
And came here tonight all alone  
He must have really hurt you bad  
Ordered up a double coke and rum  
And hope itll turn into fun  
He must have really hurt you bad  
I dont know your story but it aint hard to see  
Youve a heart thats broken as a heart can be  
Its probably not like you at all  
To mix loneliness and alcohol  
He must have really hurt you bad  
Now its 1 am and here you are  
With some stranger at the bar  
He must have really hurt you bad  
  
Across town in some motel room  
Hell try to heal your past  
While the one thats lying next o you is only there for laughs  
He must have really hurt you bad  
  
Now Im the Joe that sets you up then cuts you off  
And calls a cab when you need me to  
And Id like to say that only once in a while  
I see someone goin what youre goin through  
  
Well I need the tips but Ill be alright  
If I dont see you tomorrow night  
Stay home girl  
He must have really hurt you bad  
  
He must have really hurt you bad
