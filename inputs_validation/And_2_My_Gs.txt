One of my partnas have been shot  
And all thats going through my mind  
Is he dead or alive when Im pacing the flo  
And looking around 45  
Thinking of the worst but nobody would tell me the drama  
But the silence is killing me checking on his family  
Saying a prayer for him and his mama  
Come through sit at his bedside and ease his pain  
Relieve my tension Im flinching when they mention name  
Big D come G I dont want you to die  
Remember when we use to dip  
In your dayday Coupe and get high  
Remember when you use to think I was crazy and wouldnt chill with me  
You come to get me up the flip and smoke some kill with me  
I really appreciate the love that was shown  
Ima keep the faith and never leave you alone  
You can depend on me got down on my knees  
And I prayed until you recovered  
Then jumped your big ass right back off in the game  
Because theres money to be made and I wont knock you  
Just watch yourself when you in them streets  
And keep your heater under your seat when you creep  
Hook  4x  
And to my Gs  
Dont worry bout a damn thang

You use to call me GI but to me you was s soldier indeed  
Even though you dodged the cops daily you would hit my crib up with weed  
Freestyling to beats and smoking on fire sweet and parlay  
You should of got a purple heart for living in a war everyday  
If hes really a friend you would turn him in  
Thats what the laws would tell us  
And fellas would talk about turning you in  
How could your hood be so jealous  
And ready to give out the location of a G on the move  
Somebody tell me is your partnas freedom worth some money to you  
But I know hes in the county jail stressed fuck stabbing you in your back  
Cause they smile up in your face and stab you in your chest  
And its kinda hard to receive the swishas they pass me  
When I feel I got to watch the people they call his still family  
Must a song be coming cause it happened the way you said it would unfold  
My name is Grady and they watch me like the Super Bowl  
Now that your not around Ima still put it down the way you told me to do  
And when I go gold its dedicated to you and to my Gs  
Hook  4x  
Verse 3  
Im still trying to figure out what happened  
One minute you here then the next you was gone  
Just think quick I lost my nigga  
Victimized to the game and we still mourn  
But nigga hold on cause I know its living life  
Trapped in this cell trying to ease the pain  
But it still remains every time I put you in jail  
And its hard to accept the fact that you a cellmate my nigga  
Po out some liquor and sho wish was here to light up this swisha  
And Ill never forget the advice you gave me bout life cause you were right  
Dont shake them dikes cause the rules apply aint always precise  
Im paying a price my freedom been taken away  
And they threw away the key trapped in misery  
Cause suffering forced me to run these streets so desperately  
And to my Gs watch your back cause it aint no love in these streets  
It seems like each day theres a different way to fall victim to defeat  
Cause if you real with your boy it dont hurt to see him fall off  
When a forty get low point to the curb just letting you know you thought of  
No matter what when you get out thangsll still be the same  
But until then hold on nigga and dont worry bout a damn thang  
Hook  4x

This world is not my home Im just a passing through  
My treasures are laid out somewhere beyond the blue  
The angels beckon me from Heavens open doors  
And a nigga cant feel at home in the this world no mo  
Feel at home in this world no mo
