Youre here where you should be  
Snow is falling as the carolers sing  
It just wasnt the same  
Alone on Christmas day  
Presents what a beautiful sight  
Dont mean a thing if you aint holding me tight  
Youre all that I need  
Underneath the tree  
Tonight  
  
Im gonna hold you close  
Make sure that you know  
I was lost before you  
Christmas was cold and grey  
Another holiday alone to celebrate  
But then one day everything changed  
Youre all I need  
Underneath the tree  
  
Youre here where you should be  
Snow is falling as the carolers sing  
It just wasnt the same  
Alone on Christmas day  
Presents what a beautiful sight  
Dont mean a thing if you aint holding me tight  
Youre all that I need  
Underneath the tree  
  
I found what I was looking for  
A love thats meant for me  
A heart thats mine completely  
Knocked me right off my feet  
And this year I will fall  
With no worries at all  
Cause you are near and everythings clear  
Youre all I need  
Underneath the tree  
  
Youre here where you should be  
Snow is falling as the carolers sing  
It just wasnt the same  
Alone on Christmas day  
Presents what a beautiful sight  
Dont mean a thing if you aint holding me tight  
Youre all that I need  
Underneath the tree  
  
And then one day everything changed  
Youre all I need  
Underneath the tree  
  
Youre here where you should be  
Snow is falling as the carolers sing  
It just wasnt the same  
Alone on Christmas day  
Presents what a beautiful sight  
Dont mean a thing if you aint holding me tight  
Youre all that I need  
Underneath the tree  
Tonight
