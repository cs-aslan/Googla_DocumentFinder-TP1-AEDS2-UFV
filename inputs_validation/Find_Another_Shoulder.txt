I told you babe once before  
Dont want you hangin  
Around my door  
You better find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
Cause honey  
I dont love you anymore  
  
I told you babe youre no good  
Dont want you  
Messin up my neighborhood  
You better find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder babe  
Find another shoulder  
Cause honey  
I dont love you anymore  
  
Ah heres your  
Ticket for the coast  
Start light  
Leave here baby  
Stay out of sight  
You better find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
Cause honey  
I dont love you anymore  
  
Find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
You better find another shoulder  
Cause honey  
I dont love you anymore  
  
I told you baby once before  
Dont want you messin  
Outside my door  
You better find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
Cause honey  
I dont love you anymore
