There used to be a time when candlelight and wine  
Was all that a woman would need  
Man youll be a winner if you took her out to dinner  
Or a movie that she wanted to see  
  
Now the world has turned and its time you learned  
The old aint working no more  
The rules have changed and its a brand new game  
Buddy if you wanna score  
  
Get off the couch and get out of the house  
Long about a Friday night  
Shine up your boots polish up your moves  
If you wanna keep her satisfied  
  
You know a little bump and grind would do it every time  
If you want to keep your little girl  
Well you dont stand a chance less you take her out to dance  
Youre living in a honky tonk world  
  
Sooner or later all you couch potatoes  
Youre gonna be the lonely ones  
If you want good lovin then you gotta keep up  
You better know your Brooks from your Dunns  
  
And dont even think that your Englebert Humperdincks  
Records gonna turn her on  
Mister you can bet if you dont know the steps  
Youre gonna get left at home  
  
Get off the couch get out of the house  
Long about a Friday night  
Shine up your boots polish up your moves  
If you wanna keep her satisfied  
  
You know a little bump and grind would do it every time  
If you want to keep your little girl  
Well you dont stand a chance less you take her out to dance  
Cause youre living in a honky tonk world  
  
You were cromagnon youd be draggin your women  
By a hair to your cave  
Youd be down on one knee reciting them soliloquies  
Back in Romeos day  
  
Youd be kind of nifty if you were in the Fifties  
And you had a cool car to drive  
But now you past the Nineties so you better shake your hiney  
Or youre gonna get left behind  
  
Get off the couch and get out of the house  
Long about a Friday night  
Shine up your boots polish up your moves  
If you wanna keep her satisfied  
  
You know a little bump and grind would do it every time  
If you want to keep your little girl  
Well you dont stand a chance less you take her out to dance  
Youre living in a honky tonk world  
  
You dont stand a chance less you take her out to dance  
Cause were living in a honky tonk world  
  
Get off the couch and get out of the house  
Long about a Friday night  
Shine up your boots polish up your moves  
If you wanna keep her satisfied  
  
You know a little bump and grind would do it every time  
If you want to keep your little girl  
Well you dont stand a chance less you take her out to dance  
Youre living in a honky tonk world  
  
You dont stand a chance less you take her out to dance  
Cause youre living in a honky tonk world
