Let the frozen cities crumble crumble and fall  
Thats alright I dont mind at all  
Let em all tumble right into the sea  
Well thats just fine thats alright with me  
Since you came down the line  
I cant sleep at night I got one thing on my mind  
Thats every day every night  
I want to be with you  
I want to be with you thats what I want to do  
Cause youre just so out of sight  
I want to be with you thats what I want to do  
Now I lost my job at the Texaco station  
Cause instead of pumping gas Id dream of you  
I got thrown out of my house I got such a bad reputation  
Cause all I want to do is be seen with you  
They gave me my pay and said walk  
I dont care what they say go ahead and let em all talk  
  
Til the world falls apart  
I want to be with you  
I want to be with you  
Thats what I want to do  
Until they will rip out my heart  
I want to be with you I want to be with you  
Well thats all I want to do  
  
Hold tight love me just a little bit  
Alright a little bit more  
Tonight tonight give me just a little kiss  
No I dont know I dont know I dont  
I just cant understand it youre not pretty at all  
But I come when you whisper I run when you call  
When I see you on the street I fall on my face  
I drop to my knees I plead my case  
Oh oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you thats what I want to do  
Oh oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you thats all I want to do  
Oh oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you darlin dont you know  
Oh oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you because I love you so
