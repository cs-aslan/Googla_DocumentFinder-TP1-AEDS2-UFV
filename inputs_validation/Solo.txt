Used to see him hanging around everywhere  
In a world of his own  
See him hanging round street corners where  
We would meet  
He was a lonely kid  
Now they tell us that hes moved on  
Aint been seen for so long  
Dont know here hes gone  
Its been so long but Im on the road  
And though it aint been easy  
At least I made it on my own  
My tongues been tied for far too long  
And now your gonna hear me  
At least I now where I belong  
SOLO Im on the road  
Hello hello Im on my own  
Ah ysee everybodys got someone  
To lay their troubled lives upon  
Im really glad Ive only got my own  
Once upon a time well I had lots of friends  
I moved freely through their lives  
But twos a couple and well threes a crowd  
I was just left out  
Hanging around  
Ive had as much now as I can take  
There aint no need to stay  
SOLO Im on the road  
Hello hello Im all alone  
Ah yes everybody smiles at me  
As I go walking by  
But Im really glad Ive only got my own  
SOLO Im all alone  
SOLO Im going down the road
