Id give anything but I wont give up on you  
Id say anything but not goodbye  
I will run with your changes and Im always on your side  
And theres not a word Ive ever heard that would make me change my mind  
  
Words theyll try to shake you  
Dont let them break you  
Or stop your world from turning  
When words keep you from feeling good  
Use them as fire wood and let em burn  
  
Like stones in your pocket people try to wear you down  
Someone always wants to take the love youve found  
So lets roll with these changes and I want you by my side  
And theres not a word Ive ever heard that could make me change my mind  
  
Words theyll try to shake you  
Dont let them break you  
Or stop your world from turning  
When words keep you from feeling good  
Use them as fire wood and let em burn  
  
Let them burn  
Let them burn  
Underneath every word somebodys heart been broken  
With or without words we try to forget  
  
Words theyll try to shake us  
Dont let them break us  
Or stop our world from turning  
When words keep you from feeling good  
Use them as fire wood and let em burn  
  
Words theyll try to shake you  
Dont let them break you  
Or stop your world stop your world from turning round  
When words keep you from feeling good  
Use them as fire wood and let em burn  
  
Let them burn  
Let them burn
