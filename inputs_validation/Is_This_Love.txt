I should have known better  
Than to let you go alone  
Its times like these  
I cant make it on my own  
Wasted days and sleepless nights  
An I cant wait to see you again  
  
I find I spend my time  
Waiting on your call  
How can I tell you babe  
My backs against the wall  
I need you by my side  
To tell me its alright  
Cause I dont think I can take anymore  
  
Is this love that Im feeling  
Is this the love that Ive been searching for  
Is this love or am I dreaming  
This must be love  
Cause its really got a hold on me  
A hold on me  
  
I cant stop the feeling  
Ive been this way before  
But with you Ive found the key  
To open any door  
I can feel my love for you  
Growing stronger day by day  
An I cant wait too see you again  
So I can hold you in my arms  
  
Is this love that Im feeling  
Is this the love that Ive been searching for  
Is this love or am I dreaming  
This must be love  
Cause its really got a hold on me  
A hold on me  
  
Is this love that Im feeling  
Is this the love that Ive been searching for  
  
Is this love or am I dreaming
