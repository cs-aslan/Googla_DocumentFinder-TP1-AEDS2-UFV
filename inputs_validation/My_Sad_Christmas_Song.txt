Intro  
Fa lalalala  
  
Verse 1  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Ive had it stuck in my head all day long  
I wrote it in the car on my ride home  
Cause I knew Id walk in the door and Id be alone  
Whyd I even put up that fuckin tree  
If theres no one here thats gonna see  
Just how pretty she looks on Christmas Eve  
Cause theres no one here next to me  
  
Chorus 1  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I light another bong  
I turn on the radio  
I binge watch our favorite shows  
This year feels kind of lame  
But the last one was the same  
But the holiday spirit they say  
Is taking off on a plane  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
  
Verse 2  
I always thought that Santa was kind of cute  
Theres something about his beard big belly and boots  
I left Santa more than cookies this year  
I thought he might appreciate a few beers  
Thats why Im always on the naughty list  
He said cause when I get drunk Im always showing my tits  
He leaned in for a kiss and he got real near  
I had to stop Santa and say My true love aint here  
  
Chorus 2  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I rip another bong  
I never been good at making plans  
Next year Im gonna be with my man  
My little sister says Im the Grinch  
But my mom thinks Im just a bitch  
Why did you have to go  
We were under the mistletoe  
This is my sad Christmas song

Missing you on fuckin Christmas why did you have to go  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas know I miss you so
