I got up this morning  
And without a word of warning  
I knew for sure I had to change my way  
Dusted my mind to clear it  
My body and my spirit  
But its okay Im gonna start today hey  
Emotions disappearing  
I call out but youre not here and  
I question why I have this debt to pay  
But Ill do my best believing  
That Ill get that lovin feeling  
I mean to say Im gonna start today  
  
Start today to turn this love around  
I know for sure Ill never let you down baby cause  
No longer do I think its all in your mind  
I get the point and Ive got nothing but time  
To be the way I know I really should be  
And find a way for love to rescue me ooh  
  
Im gonna start today  
Working on loving you better  
Im gonna start today  
Working on leaving you never  
Im gonna start today  
So baby dry your tears away its okay  
Im gonna start today hey yeah  
  
Still dream of you returning  
My pilot light is burning  
I mention you every time that I pray  
I sleep with one eye open  
Cause in my heart Im hoping  
Youll believe what I say  
Im gonna start today  
And from this moment on  
Even though youll be gone  
Im gonna do everything that I say  
I wanna be your best man  
Ill let time do the rest  
And Ill sweep you away  
Im gonna start today  
  
I am here but since your love is gone  
The days so lonely and the nights so long baby cause  
I want that love I knew no less no more  
I want you back the way you loved me before  
Cause yesterday is how tomorrow should be  
Ill start today if you will rescue meOoo  
  
The nights so long so long without you baby  
And I cant stand it no more  
Come here cause I want to prove my love for you baby

To be the way I know I really should be  
And find a way for love to rescue me
