Theres this one guy  
Theres no one like him in all the world  
Cause you can always see  
Those girls down on there knees  
  
In those dark sweaty rooms  
Planning out his thoughts  
Hes waiting for just the right  
  
One by one as they  
Walk right through the door they  
Keep on coming back  
Guess they just want more  
  
He has fun fun fun and you  
Might call him a whore but  
Just look where hes at cause  
He is the one that scores  
  
I saw my friend there  
Out on the field today  
I asked him where hes going he said  
All the way now  
  
One by one as they  
Walk right through the door they  
Keep on coming back  
Guess they just want more  
  
He has fun fun fun and you  
Might call him a whore but  
Just look where hes at cause  
He is the one that scores  
  
Go
