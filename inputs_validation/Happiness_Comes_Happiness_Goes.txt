Happiness comes happiness goes  
Where it goes no one knows  
Whats in store who can guess  
It could be    happiness  
If youre in love an she loves you too  
Oh never break her heart whatever you may do  
Dont say goodbye  Dont say goodbye   
To a love thats true  to a love thats true   
Because if you should lose your one an only  
All your life you may be lonely  
Happiness comes  Happiness comes   
Happiness goes  happiness goes   
Where it goes  where it goes   
No one knows  no one knows   
Whats in store  Whats in store   
Who can guess  who can guess   
It could be    happiness  
  
Happiness comes happiness goes  
Where it goes no one knows  
Whats in store  Whats in store   
Who can guess  who can guess   
It could be    happiness  
It could be    happiness  
It could be    happiness
