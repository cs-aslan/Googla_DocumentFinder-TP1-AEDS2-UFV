So money made you mean  
And thats not how its supposed to be  
Youre ready to challenge and defend  
Yeah but for all the wrong reasons  
How much do we really need  
A question if you have to ask  
Just means what it means  
The question that says everything  
Right and left its all the same conspiracy  
Just cause you ask doesnt make a difference to me  
You could keep it all or give it away  
But where did it come from in the first place  
Robbing Peter to pay me and Ill just be  
Giving it back to Peter to feel free  
Now you have to fix everything thats broke  
Cause itll never leave you alone  
Reinvent the wheel be the butt of a joke  
Take the long road to charity  
Right or left its all the same conspiracy  
Robbing Peter to pay Paul  
Or robbing Peter to pay me  
Robbing Peter to pay Paul  
Or robbing Peter to pay me  
Yeah its just too hard oh well jump in  
Forget about the sharks and swim  
Cause now youre one now youre one  
You cant deny it anymore  
Right or left its all the same conspiracy  
Robbing Peter to pay Paul  
Or robbing Peter to pay me  
Robbing Peter to pay Paul  
Or robbing Peter to pay me  
You cant deny it anymore
