The car that I drive may not impress  
But I get where I need to go  
You may disagree with the way that I dress oooh  
But Im always comfortable  
My fortune and fame  
Aint no display nobody has stick to myself  
And to be perfectly honest  
I like it that way  
So it doesnt matter what you say  
I may not be who you want me to be  
All I can be is me  
I wont pretend  
So baby take it or leave  
Cause all I can be is me all I can be all I can be  
All I can be is me all I can be all I can be  
All I can be is me  
What you get is what you see  
Cause all I can be is me  
Ohhh yeah yeah  
Sometimes I prefer to just stay at home  
Dont need that fancy restaurant  
Sometimes I would rather turn the tv on  
Simple is all I want  
Why put on a mask  
Why be all a vision  
Theres never a reason  
Im happy with me  
My lifes not in mission  
Im ok with who Im bein  
Though I may not be who you want me to be  
But all I can be is me  
I wont pretend  
So baby take it or leave  
Cause all I can be is me all I can be all I can be  
All I can be is me all I can be all I can be  
Said all I can be is me  
What you get is what you see  
Cause all I can be is me  
Ooohh  
Money cars and diamond rings  
All those expensive things  
Baby I just dont give a damn  
But if you really love me  
Like you say youd love me  
Then baby take me as I am  
Heeeey  
Though I may not be who you want me to be  
But all I can be is me  
I wont pretend  
So baby take it or leave hey  
Cause all I can be is me all I can be all I can be  
All I can be is me all I can be all I can be  
Said all I can be is me  
What you get is what you see  
Cause all I can be is me
