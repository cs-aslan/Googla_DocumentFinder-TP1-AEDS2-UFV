They laugh at me aloud  
They say Im just a clown  
That I aint got no pride  
Im on the outside  
The girls look really cute  
They really make it work  
They think Im just a jerk  
Im on the outside  
I never could sit still  
I never was too hip  
I never caught the ride  
Im on the outside  
  
Im on the outside Im on the outside now  
This is where it all begins right here  
On the outside lookin in Im on the outside  
  
I never was a punk  
I never shot junk  
I never even tried counter  
Culture passed me right by  
Im on the outside  
  
Dont talk to debutantes  
Dont eat in restaurants  
The patrons sit and stare  
The waiters make wise cracks behind my back  
Im on the outside  
  
Teachers there in school  
They flunked me by the rule  
They say I had no motivation brains or dedication  
I guess the imbeciles were right Im on the outside  
  
Im on the outside Im on the outside now  
This is where it all begins on the outside looking in  
Looking in  
At you  
Im just an alien through and through  
Tryin to make believe Im you  
Tryin to fit  
Just a stranger on the outside looking in  
  
The disco makes me sick I  
Wear the wrong clothes  
I say the wrong things  
You know I cant dance  
My feet are much too wide Im on the outside  
  
You think you set the trends  
You wear your hair just right  
Your clothes are outasight  
Your house is modern really kitch  
You get so macho when youre with your bitch  
Im on the outside  
  
I see them go to work  
I see them go to sleep  
I see them on TV  
I see them laugh and cry  
Im on the outside Im on the outside Im on the outside  
  
Chorus  
  
Im on the outside Im on the outside now  
Im on the outside  
Im on the outside now
