I hear your heartbeat but youre never there  
Like a mirage you haunt me everywhere  
All day long  
I burn for you lonely in the night  
I tried to live alone but I just cant get it right  
Ya know that this towns like a Painted Desert  
Dead heat movin in the city  
Im lost in a Painted Desert  
In a Painted Desert without you  
  
Ive done some thinkin now that youre not here  
I know your reasons and theyre still not clear  
All Im sure of is what I got to lose  
I tried to be a better loser but its just no use  
  
Ya know that this towns like a Painted Desert  
Dead heat movin in the city  
Im lost in a Painted Desert  
In a Painted Desert without you  
  
Walkin in the sundown I search in vain  
Waitin on the wind that whispers out your name  
Through concrete canyons echoing a world of other faces  
No direction looks like home  
Where is my oasis  
  
Ya know that this towns like a Painted Desert  
Dead heat movin in the city  
Im lost in a Painted Desert  
In a Painted Desert without you  
In a Painted Desert without you  
Where is my oasis
