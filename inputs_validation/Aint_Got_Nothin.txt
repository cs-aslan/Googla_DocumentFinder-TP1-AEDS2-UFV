They got nothing on me anymore  
They got nothing on you  
I dont care what they say anymore  
All I want is the truth  
  
I dont feel  
To unveil  
Heres a song  
Sing along  
  
They got nothing from me anymore  
I got nothing from you  
I dont care what they say anymore  
All I want is the truth  
  
I dont feel  
To unveil  
Heres a song  
Sing along  
Watch my style  
Pick a place  
Wipe the smile  
From your face  
  
I dont feel  
To unveil  
Heres a song  
Sing along  
Watch my style  
Pick a place  
Wipe the smile  
From your face  
  
They got nothing on me anymore  
They got nothing on you  
I dont care what they say anymore  
All I want is the truth
