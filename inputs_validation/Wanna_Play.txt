Tuesday night I was laid up in the bed  
Tired as hell Im hearing voices in my head  
Heard some knocks grabbed my tone ran to the doe door  
Screamed Who is it but i aint hear that shit no mo  
Cocked my nine  
I went to peekin out the blinds  
Thought it was fine  
But at a unexpected time  
The doe door flew in I got a twostory home  
Seen em comin wit they face masks on  
Bust the choppers down the stairs they hit the cut  
Two of them got away but the other two got stuck  
Hit em again  
One in the neck one in the chin  
Then called the Law and said I did they ass in  
Hook  
OK you want to play  
You say you know where I stay  
Well come today  
Bring yo bad ass on Im waitin on ya  
I got a K wit a motherfuckin shank on it  
You bitch you  
OK you want to play

Say whodie you wont believe what happened to me  
A nigga all in my spot and he askin for me  
See I wouldnt at the spot but my broad was there  
When she hit me on the phone its niggas in there

This situation is a cold thang  
I got to explain  
Cause nigga this a cold game

But I was moving them thangs like they was hot tamales  
Well hot tamales I played the cards I was dealt  
Because I knew befo long that theyll hang they self  
I aint no fool  
Nigga thats why I play it cool  
I know the shit you will and wont try to do  
But what you came in wit thats what you left wit AHH HAA  
Because Im three steps ahead its like you brainless

I disassociated my self from bad nerves  
Cause once you under pressure youll bust trick  
And you the type of nigga that I cant trust bitch  
And the nigga that went you just a sendout  
I tried to kill yo hoe ass but you went out the window bitch  
Hook
