Fighting fire with fire  
  
You came here on purpose in front of me Diana  
To be seen with some other man  
Youre wanting me to watch him enjoy the freedom  
Youre letting him take with his hands  
  
Did you tell or must I tell him Diana  
Does it matter to that kind of man  
Any place he touches or kisses Diana  
Is some place Ive already been  
  
You know youre fighting fire with fire  
Over something that broke us apart  
At least I was hiding and trying Diana  
To keep it from breaking your heart  
  
You mustve been crazy for taking advantage  
Of the fact that you werent around  
But she was so soft and pretty  
And she made a promise never to utter a sound  
  
Can you tell or must I tell you Diana  
Its a heart burning hell that Im in  
And any place he touches or kisses Diana  
Id gladly crawl back there again  
  
You know
