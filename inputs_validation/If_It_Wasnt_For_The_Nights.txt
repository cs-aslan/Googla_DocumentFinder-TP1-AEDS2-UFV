I got appointments work I have to do  
Keepin me so busy all the day through  
Theyre the things that keep me from thinkin of you  
Oh baby I miss you so I know Im never gonna make it  
Oh Im so restless I dont care what I say  
And I lose my temper ten times a day  
Still its even worse when the nights on its way  
Its bad oh so bad  
  
Somehow Id be doin alright if it wasnt for the nights  
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could make it  
Id have courage left to fight if it wasnt for the nights  
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could take it  
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall  
Sittin here alone and starin at the wall  
Even I could see a light if it wasnt for the nights  
Even I could see a light I think that I could make it  
Somehow Id be doin alright if it wasnt for the nights  
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could take it  
  
Noone to turn to you know how it is  
I was not prepared for something like this  
Now I see them clearly the things that I miss  
Oh baby I feel so bad I know Im never gonna make it  
I got my business to help me through the day  
People I must write to bills I must pay  
But everythings so different when nights on its way  
Its bad oh so bad  
  
Somehow Id be doing alright if it wasnt for the nights  
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could make it  
Id have courage left to fight if it wasnt for the nights  
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could take it  
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall  
Sittin here alone and starin at the wall  
Even I could see a light if it wasnt for the nights  
Even I could see a light I think that I could make it  
Guess my future would look bright if it wasnt for the nights  
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could make it  
  
If it wasnt for the nights  
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could take it  
if it wasnt for the nights  
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could make it  
  
Even I could see a light if it wasnt for the nights  
Even I could see a light I think that I could make it  
Guess my future would look bright if it wasnt for the nights  
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could take it  
  
If it wasnt for the nights  
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could make it  
If it wasnt for the nights  
If it wasnt for the nights I think that I could take it  
  
Even I could see a light if it wasnt for the nights  
Even I could see a light I think that I could make it  
Guess my future would look bright if it wasnt for the nights
