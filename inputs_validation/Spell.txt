Through the woods and frosted moors  
Past the snowcaked hedgerows I  
Bed down upon the drifting snow  
Sleep beneath the melting sky  
I whisper all your names  
I know not where you are  
But somewhere somewhere somewhere here  
Upon this wild abandoned star  
  
And Im full of love  
And Im full of wonder  
And Im full of love  
And Im falling under  
Your spell  
  
I have no abiding memory  
No awakening no flaming dart  
No word of consolation  
No arrow through my heart  
Only a feeble notion  
A glimmer from afar  
That I cling to with my fingers  
As we go spinning wildly through the stars  
  
And Im full of love  
And Im full of wonder  
And Im full of love  
And Im falling under  
Your spell  
  
The wind lifts me to my senses  
I rise up with the dew  
The snow turns to streams of light  
The purple heather grows anew  
I call you by your name  
I know not where you are  
But somehow somewhere sometime soon  
Upon this wild abandoned star  
  
And Im full of love  
And Im full of wonder  
And Im full of love  
And Im falling under  
Your spell
