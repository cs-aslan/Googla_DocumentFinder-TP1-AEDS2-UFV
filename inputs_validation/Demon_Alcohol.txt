Im sick and tired of your excuses  
Cant deal with living anymore  
Ill give you reasons to continue  
While you lie writing on the floor  
  
Ill wash away your lies  
And have you hypnotized  
Therell be no compromise today  
Ill share your life of shame  
I think you know my name  
Ill introduce myself today  
  
Im the demon alcohol  
Demon alcohol  
Ill get you  
  
If you could deal with your reflection  
Im sure youd see into my eyes  
Therell be no need for resurrection  
Lets drink to people of the lies  
  
Although that ones too much  
You know tens not enough  
Therell be no compromise today  
Ill watch you lose control  
Consume your very soul  
Ill introduce myself today  
Im the demon alcohol  
Demon alcohol  
Ha ha  
Demon alcohol  
Demon alcohol lets party  
  
Demon alcohol  
Im the demon alcohol  
  
Im sick and tired of resolutions  
Youve quit me time and time again  
Dont speak of suicide solutions  
You took my hand Im here to stay  
  
This time its you or me  
Ill never set you free  
Therell be no compromise today  
So satisfy your lust  
Too much cant be enough  
Ill introduce myself today  
  
Im the demon alcohol  
The demon alcohol  
Aha  
Demon alcohol  
Demon alcohol
