People here and all over the world  
Men women boys and pretty girls  
Gather round by the seaside Beach fun and tropic skies  
Diamond head and palm trees surf riders on the sea  
Its the place to be its the place to be  
One the beach at Waikiki thats where youll find me  
Here on the southside Beach Boys paradise

Music playing happy songs everybody gets along  
Dancing in the sunshine groovin in the good vibe  
Down by the sea good times will set your free

On the beach at Waikiki thats where youll find me  
Here on the southside Beach Boys paradise

At the beach at Waikiki thats where youll find me  
Here on the southside Beach Boys paradise
