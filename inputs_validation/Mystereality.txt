Mystereality  
Its not the same game anymore  
Anor the time or the places before  
You dont know you dont know you dont know  
  
If you see me youll be asking  
Its always take take take take take take take take  
Oh reality dont fool me  
No mistakes this time  
  
Mystereality  
Well really its all just promises  
You know how much I hate the unforeseen  
Oh dont you know  
  
Anever never a regard for the truth  
Whats the meaning of that mister are  
Oh reality dont fool me  
No mistakes this time  
  
My my reality  
So where did we go wrong  
Have you seen just arecently  
The lengths to which weve been  
  
Now you could say that its time  
Escapes they seldom work  
Oh reality dont fool me  
I count on you to know
