Turn around stand up like a man and look me in the eye  
Turn around take one final look at what youve left behind  
Then walk away from the greatest lover you have ever known  
Yes walk away youre telling me that you can make it on your own  
By yourself all alone without my help  
Mister you just made a big mistake  
  
Chorus  
You think youre a man but youre only a boy  
You think youre a man but youre only a toy  
You think youre a man but you just couldnt see  
You werent man enough to safisfy me  
Shut the door take a look around and tell me what you find  
  
Shut the door take a giant step for you and all mankind  
Then dont come back I always gave you so much more than you deserve  
No dont come back cause no one makes a fool of me  
Youve got a nerve to walk away mark the words Im gonna say  
Mister you just made a big mistake  
  
Chorus  
  
Shut the door take a giant step for you and all mankind  
Then dont come back I always gave you so much more than you deserve  
No dont come back cause no one makes a fool of me  
Youve got a nerve to walk away mark the words Im gonna say  
Mister you just made a big mistake  
  
Chorus x2
