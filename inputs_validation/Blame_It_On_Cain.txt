Once upon a time I had a little money  
Government burglars took it along  
Before I could mail it to you  
Still you are the only one  
Now I cant let it slip away  
So if the man with the ticker tape he tries to take it  
Well this is what Im gonna say  
  
Chorus  
Blame it on Cain  
Dont blame it on me  
Ohoh oh its nobodys fault  
But we need somebody to burn  
  
Well if I was a saint with a silver cup  
And the money got low we could always heat it up  
Or trade it in  
But then the radio to heaven will be wired to your purse  
And you can run down the waveband  
Coasttocoast hand in hand  
Bad to worse curse for curse  
Dont be dissatisfied so if youre not satisfied  
  
Chorus  
  
I think Ive lived a little too long on the outskirts of town  
I think Im going insane from talking to myself for so long  
Oh but Ive never been accused  
When they step on your face then wear that goodlook grin  
I gotta break out one weekend before I do somebody in  
But every single time I feel a little stronger  
They tell me its a crime well how much longer  
  
Chorus  
  
Blame it on Cain  
Ohoh oh please dont blame it on me  
Its nobodys fault  
But it just seems to be his turn
