Jacaranda  
Help me out tomorrow  
Jacaranda  
Dont want to be alone  
Keep falling over  
A spell that brings me sorrow  
Give and take  
I shouldnt be afraid  
So you give me this big story  
It wakes me every day  
The challenge is to chase the sounds  
Just to break away  
  
And Im running  
Running  
Yes Im running  
A simple peace  
Just cant be found  
Waste another day  
Blasting all their lives away  
Ive heard the thunder  
Underground  
Tunneling away  
At the very soul of man  
  
And Im running  
Yes Im running  
Im running  
Through a new world  
  
There is the heart of millions  
Seen as a godsend to us  
There stands our future  
There can be no denying  
Simple as A be see D  
There stands our childrens lives  
  
All in the sharp step  
As one together  
All in all we race  
As one  
This time  
  
A simple peace  
Just cant be found  
Waste another day  
Blasting all their lives away  
Ive heard the thunder  
Underground  
Tunneling away  
At the very soul of man  
At the very soul of man  
  
And Im running  
Running  
Im running  
  
See through science  
Part of a back door  
A door made up of doors  
To an endless time  
To a new world  
Run  
  
There in the heart of millions  
Seen as a godsend to us  
There stands our future  
There can be no denying  
Simple as A be see D  
There stands our childrens lives  
  
All in the sharp step  
As one together  
All in all we race  
As one  
This time  
  
Hear this voice  
Now and forever  
This time brothers in time  
Is it hard to take  
Take this coice  
Is it hard to find  
Now and forever  
This fire brothers of fire  
Hard to find  
  
As it kicks so hard  
Hard to find  
As it kicks on time  
As it kicks on time  
  
There in the heart of millions  
Seen as a godsend to us  
There stands our future  
There can be no denying  
Simple as A be see D  
As it kicks so  
As it kick so  
As it kick so  
There in the heart of millions  
Seen as a godsend to us  
  
All in a sharp step  
As one together  
All in all we race  
As one  
This time
