Sometimes it seems the good times  
Never will return  
A lot has changed babe  
Cause evil rules the world  
  
You said youre looking for a place  
Where theres no hate  
Oh babe it really makes no sense  
To escape  
  
How long will it take  
To make the world a flaming star  
How long will it take  
Til they stop their senseless wars  
  
How long will it take  
Til everybody will understand  
That we need to fill our hearts with love again  
  
The only future weve got  
Exists right now  
Lets take the time babe  
As long as the world is turning round  
  
How long will it take  
To make the earth a fireball  
How long will it take  
  
Til no more life exists at all  
How long will it take  
Til everybody will understand  
That we need to fill our hearts with love again  
  
Its up to you  
To fight the evil in your mind  
Its up to you  
The more love you give the more youll find  
The more love you give the more youll find  
  
Dont make the world a flaming stra  
Stop stop all these senseless wars  
How long will it take  
Til everybody will understand  
That we need to fill our hearts with love again
