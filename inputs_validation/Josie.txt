Were gonna break out the hats and hooters  
When Josie comes home  
Were gonna rev up the motor scooters  
When Josie comes home to stay  
  
Were gonna park in the street  
Sleep om the beach and make it  
Throw down the jam till the girls say when  
Lay down the law and break it  
When Josie comes home  
  
When Josie comes home  
So good  
Shes the pride of the neighborhood  
Shes the raw flame  
The live wire  
She prays like a Roman  
With her eyes on fire  
  
Jo would you love to scrapple  
Shell never say no  
Shine up the battle apple  
Well shake em all down tonight  
  
Were gonna mix in the street  
Strike at the stroke of midnight  
Dance on the bones till the girls say when  
Pick up whats left by daylight  
When Josie comes home  
  
When Josie comes home  
So bad  
Shes the best friend we ever had  
Shes the raw flame  
  
The live wire  
She prays like a Roman  
With her eyes on fire
