Youre tellin me she loves you what a laugh  
The funny thing is baby you dont know the half  
If youve got any money honey you better put it in the safe and lock it  
Cause her love for yous just deep as your pocket  
Shes a stupid girl in a fifty dollar dress  
She wouldnt think about wearin anything that costs much less  
I can see she rows a boat but little ol mes gonna rock it  
Cause her love for yous just deep as your pocket  
Yeah her love for yous just deep as your pocket  
Shes got you blown up like a baloon but Im a gonna pop it  
She cant love you like I do but dont let me to drop it  
Cause her love for yous just deep as your pocket  
 dobro  steel   
Yeah her love for yous  
Yeah her love for yous just deep as your pocket
