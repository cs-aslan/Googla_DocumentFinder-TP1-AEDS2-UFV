My desires getting stronger  
I cant hold back any longer  
Next to me you belong  
Now Im living for the moment  
When youre gonna come on over to me  
  
Chorus  
Cause I want you to be  
Right here right now  
I believe  
You were meant to be  
Right here right now  
Right here right now  
  
I cant fight the situation  
Im giving in to  
Your temptation  
Every time I see your face  
I need you more and more  
When are you gonna come on over to me  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Cause I want you to be  
Right here right now  
Cause I want you to be  
  
Now Im living for the moment  
When youre gonna come over to me  
  
Chorus until fade
