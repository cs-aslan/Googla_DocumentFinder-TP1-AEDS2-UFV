Money talks  
But it dont sing and dance  
And it dont walk  
And long as I can have you here with me  
Id much rather be  
Forever in blue jeans  
Honeys sweet  
But it aint nothin next to babys treat  
And if you pardon me  
Id like to say  
Well do okay  
Forever in blue jeans  
  
Maybe tonight  
Maybe tonight you and I  
All alone by the fire  
Nothing around  
But the sound of my heart  
And your sighs  
  
Money talks  
But it dont sing and dance  
And it dont walk  
And long as I can have you here with me  
Id much rather be  
Forever in blue jeans babe
