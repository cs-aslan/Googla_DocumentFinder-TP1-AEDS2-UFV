I recall a friend of mine  
With a tear in my eye  
I stand here at the altar  
Hes out  
Im left with a problem now  
Im here on earth left with the pain  
Look what youve done  
You should have called  
  
Flip a coin flip a coin flip a coin  
Yeah heads I win tails you loose  
Flip a coin flip a coin flip a coin  
Yeah heads I win tails you loose  
  
Sorry I couldnt help  
Take it back  
Sorry I didnt help  
Well fuck you you could have called  
What about us what about me  
What about the years I spend pampering your ass  
Running here running there  
Oh Im so great Im so great  
Im fine Im fine  
You lied  
You promised to give your family a break  
From your blows  
Look at the sad faces youve left behind now  
I let you down  
No you let me down  
I got a family to feed  
You got a little kid yourself  
You know what I mean  
You were supposed to stay  
No one gave you the right to take your life that way  
  
Flip a coin flip a coin flip a coin  
Yeah heads I win tails you loose  
Flip a coin flip a coin flip a coin  
Yeah heads I win tails you loose  
  
Halle halle halle  
Halle halle hallelujah  
  
I feel hate I feel pain  
I feel cold I feel ashamed  
Wheres the father you should have been to your daughter  
Sad news sad days  
Where are you now  
Talk to me come on talk to me  
I know you can hear me  
Why brother why  
  
Flip a coin flip a coin flip a coin  
Yeah heads I win tails you loose  
Flip a coin flip a coin flip a coin  
Yeah heads I win tails you loose  
  
Halle halle halle  
Halle halle hallelujah  
  
You could have gone a different way
