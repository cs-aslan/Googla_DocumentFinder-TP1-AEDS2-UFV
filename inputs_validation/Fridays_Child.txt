From the North  
To the South  
Ya walked all the way  
Ya know ya left your  
Left your home  
For good to stay  
While ya built all  
All of your castles  
In the sun  
And I watched ya knock em down  
Knock em down each and every one  
Whoaoh Fridays child  
Ya cant stop now  
No  
Whoaoh Fridays child  
Ya cant stop now  
  
And I watched you  
Fore you came too ol   
And I tol ya  
A long time before ya ever came to be told  
Youve got somethin  
That they all want to know  
You gotta hold on  
And never ever let go  
Whoaoh Fridays child  
Ya cant stop now  
No no  
Whoaoh Fridays child  
Ya cannot stop now  
Ya cant stop  
  
There ya go  
There ya go rainbows hangin around your feet  
And youre makin out  
Youre makin out with everyone that you meet  
Even havin a ball  
And stayin up late  
And watched the sun come up  
round Nottinghill Gate  
Whoaoh Fridays child  
Ya cant stop now  
No no  
Whoaoh Fridays child  
Ya cannot stop  
Youre drivin  
Aaowwh  
No no no no no no no no no  
Ya cannot stop now  
Youre too much  
Ya cant stop ya cant stop ya cant stop cant stop no
