When youre coming home  
You use to cry in the night  
That makes my mind make noises  
I guess the second time  
  
Tell me that youre mine  
Say it one more time  
  
Im ready to lose  
Everything but you  
Im ready to lose everything but you  
Everything everything  
  
Is the heart in you  
I know it in my   
It made me change direction  
When I felt better off the road  
Say it one more time  
Tell me you are mine  
  
Im ready to lose everything but you  
Im ready to lose everything but you  
Everything to mind  
Say it one more time  
Tell me you are mine  
Say it one more time  
Tell me that you are mine  
Say it one more time  
Say it one more time  
Tell me that you are mine  
Tell me that you are mine  
Im ready to lose everything but you  
Im ready to lose everything but you  
Everything everything  
Say it one more time  
Say it one more time
