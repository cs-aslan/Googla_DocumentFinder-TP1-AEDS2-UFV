Shes got me nervous  
Talkin a hundred miles an hour  
Shes more than worth it  
I swear she smells just like a flower  
Id fall to pieces if I went anywhere without her  
I love when she says whats wrong with right here on the counter  
  
Funky little monkey shes a twisted trickster  
Everybody wants to be the sisters mister  
CocaCola rollercoaster  
Love her even though Im not supposed to

She keeps me up I keep you up  
She keeps me up I keep you up  
All night All night  
All night All night  
  
She keeps me up I keep you up  
She keeps me up I keep you up  
All night All night  
All night All night  
  
I need her so bad  
Sometimes I feel like I can taste it  
This evil romance  
So good I never wanna waste it  
I cant trust my friends  
Cause shes what everybody chases  
I know where shes been  
Cause its on everybodys faces  
  
I never wanna have to slow down  
Got to be a better way to come down  
Ive gotta stay awake some how
