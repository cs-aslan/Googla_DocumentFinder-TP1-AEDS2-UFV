Take your time and tell me  
Why you lie  
I realise  
That weve been found out this time  
We should stand together  
If we can  
But what you planned  
Means theres a difference between   
What youre gonna say in private  
You still want my love were in this together  
And what youre gonna do in public  
Say you were never in love that you can remember  
So discrete Shes so discrete  
I never tried to meet She never  
Your friends or interfere No  
I took a back seat Back seat between   
On what youre gonna say in private  
You still want my love were in this together  
And what youre gonna do in public  
Say you were never in love that you can remember  
What you gonna say  
When you run back to your wife  
I guess its just the story of her life  
What you gonna say  
So take your time  
And tell me when did you lie  
Oh I mean  
All the time No  
That theres a difference A difference between between  
On what youre gonna say in private  
You still want my love were in this together  
And what youre gonna do in public  
Say you were never in love that you can remember  
Tell me what you gonna say In private Oooh  
You still want my love were in this together  
What you gonna say what you gonna do  
And what youre gonna do Baby

Say you were never in love Oooh
