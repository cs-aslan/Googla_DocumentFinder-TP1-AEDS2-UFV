You may not know this but you are everything youve ever needed  
Heaven with a touch of New York Silver with a touch of gold  
And I can see where youre goin but I dont really know the way  
Its got too many changes too much rearranging  
Too many ways to go astray  
  
So if you want to go let me go along  
I never walked that road alone  
I heard it was hard  
I heard it was long  
But well come back alive  
Cause only the strong survive  
  
You walk on a wire make a game of desire pitchin pennies down a wishing
well  
Youre leading the blind through there high and low times but baby can you
lead yourself  
So calm down honey forget about the money If you need me Ill always be
there  
Go ride your high horse alone of course  
Cause if you need me Ill always care
