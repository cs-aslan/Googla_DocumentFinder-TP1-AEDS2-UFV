Sentenced to a barren waste woohoh  
Imprisoned somewhere deep in space woohoh  
For in God we still believe woohoh  
Left to die we watch them leave  
  
Lift our heads to the sky  
He wont let us die  
We will survive  
Wheeling our swords for the Lord  
  
Prisoners of faith cannot be  
Tearing our chains we break free  
  
With a burst of light the walls are blown away  
The one whos captured us with life theyll pay  
And the blood we leave behind wont wash away  
  
Another time another place woohoh  
A planet Earth now lost in space woohoh  
They live in fear for peace they yearn woohoh  
For those who dont their souls will burn  
  
So reach for the sky  
For our Lord we will die  
We will survive  
Wheeling our swords for the Lord  
  
Father your voice we have heard  
We raise up our swords speak the word  
  
For we have seen the face of Hell and still believe  
That the sword to kill the beast Hes given me  
So how many more must die that one may see  
  
For we have seen the face of Hell and still believe  
That the sword to kill the beast Hes given me  
So how many more must die that one may see  
Yeah
