Lay down imposition against a polished steel  
This is something different  
You like the way this feels  
No time for asking questions  
No time for wondering  
Weve had enough of you now  
Weve heard everything  
  
Were goin to play a new game  
You put on this blindfold  
You do what we tell you  
You do as youre told  
Used to be the leader but  
Now comes the time to serve  
Maybe well show some mercy  
Maybe youll get what you deserve  
  
Chorus  
Countdown to the end  
Gonna make it go faster  
Right around the bend  
This is gonna be a disaster disaster  
Countdown to the end  
And were here to go faster  
Come on down my friend  
Its time to meet your master  
  
Youve left quite a mess here  
Under your stewardship  
You thought youd figured it out but  
Youll find your place in this  
Nothing is so convincing  
For you to see the truth  
Give us so many things now  
Weve got in store for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on down come on down come on down  
Come on down come on down come on down  
Come on down come on down come on down  
Come on down come on down come on down  
Come on down come on down come on down  
Come on down come on down come on down  
Come on down come on down come on down
