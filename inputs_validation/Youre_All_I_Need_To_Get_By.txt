When I was just a little girl  
I wanted the world at my feet  
Now all thats changed  
Cause I have loved and  
Now I do concede  
Youre all I need to get by  
Youre all I need to get by  
Like the sweet morning dew  
I took one look at you  
And it was plain to see  
You were my destiny  
With my arms open wide  
I threw away my pride  
Ill sacrifice for you  
Dedicate my life to you  
I will go where you lead  
Always there in time of need  
And when you lose your will  
Ill be there to push you up the hill  
Theres no  
No looking back for us  
We got love sure enough  
Thats enough  
Youre all  
Youre all I need to get by  
Like an eagle protects his nest  
For you Ill do my best  
Stand by you like a tree  
Dare anybody to try and move me  
Darling in you I found  
Strength where I was torn down  
Dont know whats in store  
But together we can open any door  
Just to do whats good for you  
And inspire you a little higher  
I know you can make a woman  
Out of a soul that didnt have a goal  
Cause we we got the right foundation  
And with love and determination  
Youre all Youre All I need to get by  
Youre all I want to strive for and do a little more  
All the joys under the sun wrapped up into one  
Youre all  
Youre all I need  
Youre all I need  
Youre all I need to get by  
Youre all I need to get by  
Youre all I need to get by  
All I need to get by  
All I need is you
