Ive been so many places in my life and time  
Ive sung a lot of songs Ive made some bad rhyme  
Ive acted out my life in stages  
With ten thousand people watching  
But were alone now and Im singin this song for you  
  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be baby  
Ive treated you unkindly but girl cant you see  
Theres no one more important to me  
So darling cant you please see through me  
Cause were alone now and Im singin my song for you  
  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholdin nothin  
You came out in front and I was hiding  
But now Im so much better so if my words dont come together  
Listen to the melody cause my loves in there hiding  
  
I love you in a place where theres no space or time  
I love you for my life cause youre a friend of mine  
And when my life is over remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singin my song for you  
  
I love you in a place where theres no space or time  
Ive loved you for my life yes youre a friend of mine  
And when my life is over remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singin my song for you yes  
We were alone and I was singin this song for you baby  
We were alone and I was singin my song  
Singin my song singin my song singin my song  
Singin my song
