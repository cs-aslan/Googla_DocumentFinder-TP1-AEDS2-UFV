I guess Ill get a cab and go by in my house today  
  
No I cant visit her or my son Im supposed to stay away  
  
But it wont hurt to bring back old memories  
  
Cause after all they used to all belong to me  
  
Now theres our car the one that Im still payin for  
  
And in the front yard Lord I see my little boy  
  
And theres his mother I hope shes doing fine  
  
Oh Lord Id give anything if they were all still mine  
  
But theyre not and Im the one to blame  
  
I should have known Id never win when I played that cheating game  
  
This other man holds my life and my son calls him daddy tonight  
  
But how can I complain cause after all they used to all belong to me  
  
How can I complain cause after all they used to all belong to me
