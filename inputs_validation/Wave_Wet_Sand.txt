You are as reliable as a painting  
In wave wet sand  
Look in your eyes and I cant see a thing  
That usually means attraction to me  
  
Ive read all the books about love I could find  
And Ive found not one no  
Not one word about mine  
Cause you are reliable as a painting  
  
In wave wet sand  
Youre coming and youre going  
Like the water you never end  
Cause you are reliable as a painting  
  
In wave wet sand  
And I am just another piece of an island  
In reach for your hands  
feel my doubts when you are in my arms  
  
Darling If you know that its love  
And not charm  
You must tell me so or go elsewhere to hunt  
Cause you are  
  
Your love  
I am just another piece of an island  
I cant close my ears when I hear that you call  
I dont want to fear every tear that could fall  
  
Ill go on my own and pass people with doubts  
My goal is to find just a piece of your love  
Your love is your love is like the water  
  
You are like the water  
You are like the water  
You you are my shore and you know  
You are my shore  
  
Cause you are reliable like a painting  
I am just another piece of an island
