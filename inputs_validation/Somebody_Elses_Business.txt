Somebodys life  
  
He loves her  
But he sometimes thinks shes crazy  
Laughing  
The next minute mad  
And saying  
I think youre wasting my time  
Crying  
Then changing her mind  
  
Shes screaming and shouting  
And everythings blinding  
Shes laughing out loud  
And busy cause shes minding  
Somebody elses business  
Somebody elses business  
Somebodys life  
  
She suffers  
From such violent mood swings  
He says  
They disagree  
He loves her  
And life is never boring  
Some say  
Its just being free  
  
Shes screaming and shouting  
And everythings blinding  
Shes laughing out loud  
And busy cause shes minding  
Somebody elses business  
Somebody elses business  
Somebodys life
