And now you know my name  
But I dont feel the same  
But I aint gonna blame  
The rider on the wheel  
And I know my song is new  
I know its new for you  
I tell you how its true  
For the rider on the wheel  
And round and round we go  
We take it fast and slow  
I must keep up a show  
For the rider on the wheel  
For the rider on the wheel  
Know my name  
But I dont feel the same  
But I aint gonna blame  
The rider on the wheel  
The rider on the wheel
