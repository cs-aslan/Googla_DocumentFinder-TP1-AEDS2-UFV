Im so sleepy yeah  
Im so sleepy yeah  
I could lay my head on a piece of lead  
And imagine it was a springy bed  
Cause Im sleepy sleepy  
  
Soon Im gonna slip away  
In the night I feel it creeping creeping creeping  
  
Im so sleepy yeah  
Im so sleepy yeah  
I could lay my head on a piece of lead  
And imagine it was a springy bed  
Cause Im sleepy sleepy  
  
I cant keep my mind away from my dreams  
I hear them calling calling calling  
Soon Im gonna slip away  
Soon Im gonna slip away  
Soon Im gonna slip away  
In the night Im gonna slip away  
I wont fight it Ill just ride it  
  
Im so sleepy yeah  
Im so sleepy yeah  
I could lay my head on a piece of lead  
And imagine it was a springy bed  
Cause Im sleepy sleepy  
Yeah
