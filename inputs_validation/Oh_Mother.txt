Whoa oh yeah  
  
She was so young with such innocent eyes  
She always dreamt of a fairytale life  
And all the things your money cant buy  
She thought daddy was a wonderful guy  
Then suddenly things seemed to change  
It was the moment she took on his name  
He took his anger out on her face  
She kept all of her pain locked away  
  
Oh mother were stronger  
From all of the tears you have shed  
Oh mother dont look back  
Cause hell never hurt us again  
  
So mother I thank you  
For all youve done and still do  
You got me I got you  
Together we always pull through  
We always pull through  
We always pull through  
Oh mother oh mother oh mother  
  
It was the day that he turned on his kids  
That she knew she just had to leave him  
So many voices inside of her head  
Saying over and over and over  
You deserve much more than this  
  
She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide  
Covering the cuts and bruises cuts and bruises  
So tired of defending her life she could have died  
Fighting for the lives of her children  
  
Oh mother were stronger  
From all of the tears you have shed all of the tears you have shed  
Oh mother dont look back  
Cause hell never hurt us again hell never hurt us again  
  
So mother I thank you thank you  
For all that youve done and still do still do  
You got me I got you yeah you got me and I got you  
Together we always pull through  
We always pull through  
We always pull through  
Oh mother oh mother oh mother  
  
All of your life you have spent  
Burying hurt and regret  
But mama hell never touch us again  
  
For every time he tried to break you down  
Just remember whos still around  
Its over and were stronger  
And well never have to go back again  
  
Oh mother were stronger  
From all of the tears you have shed  
Oh mother dont look back oh mother dont look back again  
Cause hell never hurt us again cause hell never hurt us again  
  
So mother I thank you and I thank you for everything youve done  
For all that youve done and still do together we always move on  
You got me I got you you got me I got you  
Together we always pull through always pull through  
We always pull through  
We always pull through  
  
I love you mom
