Bad times somethings wrong  
Moneys gone Im on my own  
Cant stay theres nothing here  
Its been a hard hard year  
  
First month snows came  
Put me in bed couldnt work the same  
Jobs gone bills are here  
Been a hard hard year  
  
I look on the bad side of life  
I lose heart then I want to die  
So Ive got to get back on my feet  
And prove to myself Im a man  
  
I hope that the bad times are gone  
Its been work but I think that Ive won  
Now Im happy  
And Ill never be that way again  
No Ill never be that way again  
  
Snows gone springs here  
Wont happen twice Ive seen my way clear  
Everyones paid got no one to fear  
Been a hard hard year
