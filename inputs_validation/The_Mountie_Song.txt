When I was a kid I wanted to grow up and be cop in a province town or county  
I thought it would be great if someday I could only ever be a mountie  
I wanted to beat up crooks and make arrests because thats part of the
profession  
But now I sit on my horse and tell American tourists the Parliaments in
session  
I really dont look good in red and my stupid hat flies off my head in every
parade  
Im young and strong and have no fear but now Im spending my career in
motorcades  
  
I want to enforce the law I want to wear normal clothes  
I dont want to have to smile for diplomats home videos  
I good at working real hard I should have joined the coast guard  
Oh no the RCMP  
Is not the life for me  
  
I used to think that a mountie had to be honest loyal humble strong and
thrifty  
But even though we dont break ranks we get no thanks they took us off the
fifty dollar bill  
On Sussex Drive in hallowed halls we act like guards in shopping malls its
such a pain  
Like someones plotting the assassination of the Minister if Sports and
Recreation oh thats insane  
Sometimes I just want to puke on Sergeant Preston of the Yukon Dudley Do
Rights such a jerk Damn you Snidely  
And though he tries with all his heart my horse couldnt catch a golfing
cart some days I hate to go to work  
  
I want to enforce the law I want to wear normal clothes  
I dont want to have to smile for diplomats home videos  
I good at working real hard I should have joined the coast guard  
Oh no the RCMP  
Is not the life for me  
  
I want to enforce the law I want to wear normal clothes  
I dont want to have to smile for diplomats home videos  
I good at working real hard I should have joined the coast guard  
Oh no the RCMP  
Is not the life for me  
  
Oh no its not the life for me  
Oh no its not the life for me mmme mmme mmme mmme mmme mm
me mmme mmme mmme mmme mmme mmme mmme
