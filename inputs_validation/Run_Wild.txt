Open hearts  
Empty spaces  
Dusty roads  
To distant places  
But all the time  
When Im alone  
I think of you  
And how youve grown  
  
Far and wide  
Sweet and simple  
Jehovah knows  
That Ive been sinful  
  
But if Jesus comes to take your hand  
I wont let go I wont let go  
  
Im not cruel  
And youre not evil  
And were not like  
All those stupid people  
Who cant decide  
Which book to read  
Unless the paper  
Sows the seed  
  
Youre the kind of person  
That Ive always wanted to be with  
Well youre really cool  
And you always say the right things to me  
But now Ill tell you something  
For my heart beats for you deep inside  
Youll never be a burden  
And my love for you will never die  
Never die never die never die never die  
  
But if Jesus comes to take your hand  
I wont let go I wont let go  
  
But if Jesus comes to take your hand  
I wont let go I wont let go  
  
Good times around the corner  
Good times around the corner  
Good times around the corner  
I swear its getting warmer  
Good times around the corner  
Good times around the corner  
Good times around the corner  
  
Im gonna live til I die  
Im gonna live to get high
