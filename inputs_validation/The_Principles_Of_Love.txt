Its the principle of love  
Its the principle of life  
  
When you shut your soul  
Youre so hard to find  
And theres no light in my life  
  
When you come to me  
And open up your heart  
Its a joyful time in my mind  
  
Finding and losing Hurting and healing  
Lets get it on get it on now  
Yearning and learning breaking creating  
Lets get it on get it on get it on  
Its the principle of love  
Its the principle of life  
  
Its easy to forget  
So caught up in ourselves  
That were not the only ones  
Not the only ones  
  
Trouble finds us all  
But love can break the fall  
Time and time and time again  
  
Ive taken time to say goodbye to my sadness  
Now I know Im free  
You took my hand led me out of the darkness  
Help me find a brand new me  
  
Its the principle of love  
Its the principle of life
