Flashin lots of cash and spendin lotsoloot  
Hes sitting at the bar  then hes sittin at the booth  
Across the dance floor he does scoot  
Hes the skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
  
The caboose that could he goes toot toot  
Been known to gag and sometimes puke  
A very good friend of granny goose  
Hes the skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
  
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
Hes half man and half cartoon  
But good buddy dont be confused  
Hes full blooded looney tune  
  
Hes the skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
Face to face with the man in the moon  
His family doctor is doctor seuss  
If you catch him in your soup please dont shoot  
  
Hes the skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
He was new in town  
A free wheelin clown  
  
A funny young duke  
Hangin under the roof  
Of a place in time  
United sound  
  
Hell play a little guitar sing a few blues  
Hes the kindaguy that you cant refuse  
Despite the fact that hes no brute  
Hes the skinny sweaty man in the green suit  
  
Strike the magic groove make him jerk and move  
Like an eight legged freak in snake skin boots  
Coming soon to a theater near you  
Hes the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
