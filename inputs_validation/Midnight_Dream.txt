Im sittin on a mountain  
Searchin for an answer  
Hopin theres a chance  
That shell be comin back to me  
Midnight dream  
Im waitin on the mountain  
Thinkin I can find her  
Maybe if I find her  
Here is where shell want to be  
Midnight dream  
I made my way down to Mexico  
I spend a year travelin cross the ocean  
Without goin anywhere  
A hundred miles to the nearest phone  
A thousand miles from a place called home  
And all alone in my despair  
Id call you there  
My midnight dream  
So Im sittin on a mountain  
Lookin cross a river  
Needin to be with her  
More than I believed Id be  
Midnight dream  
Im sittin all alone now  
Knowin what I know now  
Thought Id be a teacher  
But she would end up teachin me  
Midnight dream  
I know that I lost my way one night  
But if you ask me  
It dont seem right  
To spend my life without you there  
And so I climbed to the highest peak  
Just hopin somehow that I what I seek  
Will somehow speak and youll appear  
My midnight dream  
Where are you dont let go  
So Im sittin on a mountain  
How can I explain it  
Im livin with the pain of thinkin how it  
Still could be  
Midnight dream  
Love is what Im thinkin  
No two ways about it  
Go too long without it  
Nothing really means a thing  
Midnight dream  
But if you havent decided yet  
Might be the only chance we get  
Lets dont forget bout you and me  
I finally ended where I began  
You see before you  
The sorry soul the lonely man  
Ive come to be  
Please come to me  
My midnight dream  
Oh come to me  
My midnight dream
