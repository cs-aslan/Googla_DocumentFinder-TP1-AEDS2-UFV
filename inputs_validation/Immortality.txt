Vacate is the wordvengeance has no place so near to her  
Cannot find the comfort in this world  
Artificial tearvessel stabbednext up volunteers  
Vulnerable wisdom cant adhere  
A truant finds homeand I wish to hold on  
But theres a trapdoor in the sunimmortality  
As privileged as a whorevictims in demand for public show  
Swept out through the cracks beneath the door  
Holier than thou how  
Surrenderedexecuted anyhow  
Scrawl dissolved cigar box on the floor  
A truant finds homeand I wish to hold on too  
But saw the trapdoor in the sun  
Immortality  
I cannot stop the thoughtIm running in the dark  
Coming up a which way signall good truants must decide  
Oh stripped and sold momauctioned forearm  
And whiskers in the sink  
Truants move oncannot stay long  
Some die just to live  
Ohh
