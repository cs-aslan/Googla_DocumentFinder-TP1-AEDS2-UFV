If I didnt love you Id hate you  
Watching you play in the bath  
A soap suds stickle back navy  
A scrubbing brush landing craft  
Your skin gets softer and warmer  
I pat you down with a towel  
Tonight its love by the fire  
My mind goes out on the prowl  
If I if I if I if I if I  
  
If I didnt love you Id hate you  
Im playing your stereogram  
Singles remind me of kisses  
Albums remind me of plans  
Tonight its love by the fire  
The wind plays over the coals  
Passionate looks are my fancy  
But you turn the look into stone  
  
If I if I if I if I if I if I if I  
If I didnt love you  
Would you sit and glow by the fire  
If I didnt love you  
Would you make me feel so  
Maybe love me  
Oh if I didnt love you mmm  
  
If I if I if I if I if I if I if I if I  
  
If I didnt love you Id hate you  
Cocoa mugs sit side by side  
Its time to poke at the fire  
But its not tonight  
Looks I find  
Taking a bite on a biscuit  
The record jumps on a scratch  
Tonight its love by the fire  
The door of your loves on the latch  
  
If I if I if I if I if I if I if I  
If I didnt love you  
Would you sit and glow by the fire  
If I didnt love you  
Would you make me feel so  
Maybe love me  
Oh if I didnt love you  
Would you sit and glow by the fire  
If I didnt love you  
Would you make me feel so  
Maybe love me  
Oh if I didnt love you mmm  
  
If I if I if I if I  
Didnt didnt didnt didnt  
Love you love you love you love you
