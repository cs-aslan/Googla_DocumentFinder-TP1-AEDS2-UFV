I just want all those modern romances  
Always being in love  
When any girl smiled at me I went wild at the touch of her clothes  
Then bang its off before I know it  
Poor broken hearted me  
  
Better think twice before falling in love again  
Better think twice before falling in love  
  
Jackies all alone in her room with the TV on  
And shes crying crying  
Wondering about how her and Joey been getting along  
All this lying lying  
Tell her this tell her that  
Wheres these lies gonna end  
Things would be much better if her and Joey just stayed friends  
  
Better think twice before falling in love again  
Better think twice before falling in love  
  
Whats in it for you  
Hes trying to shoot you down  
Long hot summer nights  
Go out now and find that girl and hold her tight  
Like shes the only girl in the world  
  
You better think twice  
Better think twice before falling in love again  
Better think twice before falling in love  
Better think twice before falling in love again  
Better think twice before falling in love
