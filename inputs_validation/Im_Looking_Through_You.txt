Im looking through you  
Where did you go  
I thought I knew you  
What did I know  
You dont look different but you have changed  
Im looking through you youre not the same  
  
Your lips are moving  
I cannot hear  
Your voice is soothing  
But the words arent clear  
You dont sound different  
Ive learned the game  
Im looking through you  
Youre not the same  
  
Why tell me why did you not treat me right  
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight  
  
Youre thinking of me  
The same old way  
You were above me  
But not today  
The only difference is youre down there  
Im looking through you  
Any other way  
  
Why tell me why did you not treat me right  
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight  
  
Im looking through you  
Where did you go  
I thought I knew you  
What did I know  
You dont look different  
But you have changed  
Im looking through you  
Youre not the same  
  
Yeah baby youve changed  
Im lookin through you  
Yeah Im lookin through you  
Youve changed youve changed youve changed
