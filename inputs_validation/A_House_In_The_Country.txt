He dont need no sedatives to ease his troubled mind  
At work he is invariably unpleasant and unkind  
Why should he care if he is hated in his home  
Cause hes gotta house in the country  
And a big sports car  
Hes gotta house in the country  
And a big sports car  
  
But he aint gotta home oh no  
And hes as wicked as he can be  
Cause hes gotta house in the country  
Where he likes to spend his weekend days  
Oh yeah oh yeah well all right  
  
Well he got his job when drunken Daddy tumbled down the stairs  
From that very day this boy is more than having his share  
One of these days Im gonna knock him off of his throne  
Cause hes gotta house in the country  
And a big sports car  
Hes gotta house in the country  
And a big sports car  
  
And hes oh so smug oh yeah  
Hes got everything he needs  
Cause hes gotta house in the country  
Where he likes to spend his weekend days  
Oh yeah oh yeah well all right  
  
And hes oh so smug oh yeah  
Hes got everything he needs  
Cause hes gotta house in the country  
And a big sports car  
Hes gotta house in the country  
And a big sports car  
  
But hes socially dead oh yeah  
And it dont matter much to him  
Cause hes gotta house in the country  
Where he likes to spend his weekend days  
Oh yeah oh yeah well all right  
  
House in the country  
House in the country  
House in the country  
House in the country
