I dont want to rock baby dont want to rock  
I just feel Im stuck up against the clock  
I dont really want to rock tonight  
I only want to hold you tight  
  
I dont want to roll baby dont want to roll  
I just feel Im cold like Im getting old  
I dont really want to roll tonight  
I only want to hold you tight  
Please please dont turn out the light  
  
Rocknroll village man  
Northern soul peter pan  
Rocknroll rocket man  
Skater phase desperate Dan  
Rocknroll never sounded better  
  
I dont want to be baby dont want to be  
I just feel its me falling off the tree  
I dont really want to be tonight  
I only want to keep you right  
  
I dont want to try baby dont want to try  
I just feel Im dry trying to get by  
I dont really want to try tonight  
I only want to hold you tight  
Please please dont turn out the light  
  
Rocknroll rocket man  
Skater phase desperate Dan  
Rocknroll village man  
Northern soul peter pan  
  
You can  
I dont want to rock baby dont want to rock  
I just feel Im stuck up against the clock  
I dont really want to rock tonight  
I only want to keep you right  
  
I dont want to roll baby dont want to roll  
I just feel Im cold like Im getting old  
I dont really want to roll tonight  
I only want to hold you tight  
Please please dont turn out the light
