Love is calling earth  
Do you know how much is hurts  
I didnt die overnight  
In the wind I had candlelight  
Im controlled by my fear  
All the voices in my head  
That I can hear  
  
Please dont hurt me  
  
How do I learn  
To give and love and be loved in return  
If this is heaven Im falling  
Id rather run and jump away  
Than to see it burn  
I feel I could die  
Before I sleep I kiss your cheek  
And say goodbye  
  
Im so sorry  
Please dont hurt me  
  
This is love calling earth  
Do you know how much it hurts  
I didnt die overnight  
In the wind I had candlelight  
  
Im controlled by my fear  
And all the voices in my head  
That I can hear  
  
Im so sorry  
Please dont hurt me  
  
If you could see me through my mothers eye  
Only then would you begin to realise  
All the places I have ever been  
Have scared me half to death or  
somewhere inbetween  
  
Im so sorry  
Please
