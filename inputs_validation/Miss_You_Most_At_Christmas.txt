The fire is burning  
The rooms all aglow  
Outside the December wind blows  
Away in the distance the carolers sing in the snow  
Everybodys laughing  
The world is celebrating  
And everyones so happy  
Except for me tonight  
  
Because I miss you  
Most at Christmas time  
And I cant get you  
Get you off my mind  
Every other season comes along  
And Im all right  
But then I miss you most at Christmas time  
  
I gaze out the window  
This cold winters night  
At all of the twinkling lights  
Alone in the darkness  
Remembering when you were mine  
Everybodys smiling  
The whole world is rejoicing  
And everyones embracing  
Except for you and I  
  
Baby I miss you  
Most at Christmas time  
And I cant get you  
Get you off my mind  
Every other season comes along  
And Im all right  
But then I miss you most at Christmas time  
  
In the springtime those memories start to fade  
With the April rain  
Through the summer days  
Till autumns leaves are gone  
I get by without you  
Till the snow begins to fall  
  
And then I miss you  
Most at Christmas time  
And I cant get you  
Get you off my mind  
Every other season comes along  
And Im all right  
But then I miss you most at Christmas time
