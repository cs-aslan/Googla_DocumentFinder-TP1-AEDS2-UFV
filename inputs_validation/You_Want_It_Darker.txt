Leonard Cohen  
If you are the dealer Im out of the game  
If you are the healer it means Im broken and lame  
If thine is the glory then mine must be the shame  
You want it darker  
We kill the flame  
  
Magnified sanctified be thy holy name  
Vilified crucified in the human frame  
A million candles burning for the help that never came  
You want it darker  
Hineni hineni  
Im ready my Lord  
  
Theres a lover in the story  
But the storys still the same  
Theres a lullaby for suffering  
And a paradox to blame  
But its written in the scriptures  
And its not some idle claim  
You want it darker  
We kill the flame  
  
Theyre lining up the prisoners  
And the guards are taking aim  
I struggled with some demons  
They were middleclass and tame  
I didnt know I had permission to murder and to maim  
You want it darker  
  
Hineni hineni  
Im ready my Lord  
  
Magnified sanctified be thy holy name  
Vilified crucified in the human frame  
A million candles burning for the love that never came  
You want it darker  
We kill the flame  
  
If you are the dealer let me out of the game  
If you are the healer Im broken and lame  
If thine is the glory mine must be the shame  
You want it darker  
  
Hineni hineni  
Hineni hineni  
Im ready my Lord
