Two young lovers meet and take each others hand  
They say I do in the name of the lord  
Livin as one givin all they can  
Then the pressures come and a child is born  
Young girl cradles the child in her arms  
The mans home late and his days too long  
Theyre both unable to spend some time alone  
That everybody needs to have  
Thats the thing that keeps love strong  
  
Chorus  
Love dont always come easy  
And sometimes love it can hurt  
Words dont always come easy  
Its worth a try were gonna make it work  
cause love dont always come easy  
  
Without warning many go a different way  
And travel that road lookin for someone  
Their lives unravel a little more every day  
This aint no time to turn and run  
Its a crime to throw it all away  
  
Chorus
