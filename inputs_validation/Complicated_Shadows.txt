Well you know your time has come and youre sorry for what youve done  
You shouldve never have been playing with a gun  
In those complicated shadows  
Well theres a line that you must toe  
And itll soon be time to go  
But its darker than you know in those complicated shadows  
  
All you gangsters and rude clowns  
Who were shooting up the town  
When you should have found someone to put the blame on  
Though the furys hot and hard  
I still see that cold graveyard  
Theres a solitary stone thats got your name on  
  
You dont have to take it from me  
But I know what I spake  
You think youre like iron and steel  
But iron and steel will bend and break  
In those complicated shadows  
  
Go  
Sometimes justice you will find  
Is just dumb not colorblind  
And your poor shattered mind cant take it all in  
All those phantoms and those shades  
Should jump up on judgment day  
And say to the almighty Im still stinking of sin  
  
But the jury was dismissed  
Took his neck and they give it a twist  
So you see you wont be missed in those complicated shadows  
  
You can say just what you like in a voice like a John Ford film  
Take the law into your hands  
You will soon get tired of killing  
In those complicated shadows  
Complicated shadows  
Complicated shadows  
Complicated shadows  
  
Go
