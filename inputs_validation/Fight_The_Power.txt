1989 the number another summer Get down  
Sound of the fucking drummer  
Music hitting your heart cause I know you got soul Brothers and sisters  
Listen if youre missing yall  
Swinging while Im singing  
Giving whatcha getting  
Knowing what I know  
While the Black bands sweating  
And the rhythm rhymes rolling  
Got to give us what we want

Our freedom of speech is freedom or death

As the rhythm designed to bounce  
What counts is that the rhymes  
Designed to fill your mind  
Now that youve realized the prides arrived  
We got to pump the stuff to make us tough  
From the heart  
Its a start a work of art  
To revolutionize make a change nothings strange  
People people we are the same  
No were not the same  
Cause we dont know the game  
What we need is awareness we cant get careless  
You say what is this  
My beloved lets get down to business  
Mental self defensive fitness  
Bum rush the show  
You gotta go for what you know  
Make everybody see in order to fight the powers that be

Let me hear you say

Elvis was a hero to most  
But he never meant shit to me you see  
Straight up racist that sucker was  
Simple and plain  
Motherfuck him and John Wayne  
Cause Im Black and Im proud  
Im ready and hyped plus Im amped  
Most of my heroes dont appear on no stamps  
Sample a look back you look and find  
Nothing but rednecks for 400 years if you check  
Dont worry be happy  
Was a number one jam  
Damn if I say it you can slap me right here  
Lets get this party started right Right on come on
