She caught my eye with the moves she makes  
She knew I meant to make her mine  
cause therell be heat in this seduction  
I didnt read between the lines  
  
Shes got time to lose your mind  
  
I know her looks are meant to kill  
That is not what she realized  
Her wits so sharp so shrill  
Shell bang you slowly with her mind  
  
Shes got time to blow your mind  
  
Chorus Shell keep on making it rough  
Gotta get up she cant stop  
Getting it tough shell keep spinning you around round round  
Shell keep on making it rough  
Gotta get up she cant stop  
Getting it tough youll keep banging em down down down  
  
She says the words you want to hear  
Shes been rehearsing every line  
The love you need to have to lead me  
Forget your moves shell rob you blind  
  
Shes got time to lose your mind  
  
Her body moves to gain corruption  
Her tender touch like none before  
Feel that twist so deep seduction  
To steal that halo off your door  
  
Shes got time to lose your mind  
  
Chorus Shell keep on making it rough  
Gotta get up she cant stop  
Getting it tough shell keep spinning you aroundround round  
Shell keep on making it rough  
Gotta get up she cant stop  
Getting it tough youll keep banging em down down down  
  
undestinguishable rap section  
  
So her looks are meant to kill  
That is not what she realized  
Her wits so sharp so shrill  
Shell bang you slowly with her mind  
  
Shes got time to blow your mind  
  
Chorus x3
