Rain kept pourin down  
We had places to be  
No funnin around  
Curiosities  
There were plenty for our heads  
You were somethin to see  
Do you remember what he said  
  
I know it may sound funny but  
How dare you show up on time  
I can hear you been hidin in the closet  
I think we better give before we  
Take our lives  
  
Jokers blowin around  
Tenminutemen  
Wasnt nowhere to be found  
Curiosities  
There were plenty for our head  
You were listen to me  
Do you remember what he said  
  
I know it may sound funny but  
How dare you show up on time  
I can hear you laughin in the closet  
I think we better give before we  
Take our lives  
  
I know it may sound funny but  
How dare you show up on time  
I can hear you laughin in the closet  
I think we better give before we  
Take our lives  
  
Wasnt slowing down  
Fillin all our needs  
Circus comin to town  
Generosities  
There were plenty for our heads  
We were something to see  
Remember what he said  
  
I know it may sound funny but  
How dare you show up on time  
I can hear you hidin in the closet  
I think we better give before he  
Take our life  
  
He said hes in it for the money but  
I guess theres truth in lies  
Cause its your favorite charity  
I think we better give before we  
Take our lives
