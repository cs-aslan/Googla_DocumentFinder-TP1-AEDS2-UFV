It aint no fun lying down to sleep  
And there aint no secrets left for me to keep  
I wish the stars up in the sky  
Would all just call in sick  
And the clouds would take the moon out  
On some oneway trip  
  
I drove all night down streets that wouldnt bend  
But somehow they drove me back here once again  
To the place I lost at love and the place I lost my soul  
I wish Id just burn down this place that we called home  
It would all have been so easy  
If youd only made me cry  
And told me how youre leaving me  
To some organ grinders lullaby  
  
Its hard so hard  its tearing out my heart  
Its hard letting you go  
  
Now the sky it shines a different kind of blue  
And the neighbors dog dont bark like he used to  
Well  me these days  
I just miss you  its the nights that I go insane  
Unless youre coming back for me  
Thats one thing I know that wont change  
  
Its hard so hard  its tearing out my heart  
Its hard letting you go  
  
Now some tarot card shark said ill draw you a heart  
And well find you somebody else new  
But Ive made my last trip to those carnival lips  
When I bet all that I had on you  
  
Its hard its hard its hard so hard  
Its hard letting you go  
Its hard so hard its tearing out my heart  
But its hard letting you go
