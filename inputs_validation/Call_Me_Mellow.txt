Fill the sky with love  
Fill the sky with love  
  
I wouldnt mind but she just turned up on the doorstep  
Wishful and ashen slightly bedraggled  
Last time I saw her she was howling at the moon  
Roaming the forest lupine and rabid  
  
Whoa is she wild  
Does she see my inner child  
  
But then she knows its like a curse  
To find our chosen roles reversed  
To unify my universe  
To call me mellow  
  
If only I was half my age and she was older  
Wed live on icecream on Coney Island  
I though its gravity that drags down my balloon  
She stays in orbit way after midnight  
  
Woah slip and slide  
Does she go all deweyeyed  
  
But then she knows its like a curse  
To find our chosen roles reversed  
To unify my universe  
To call me mellow  
  
Shell dress down for us  
Shell break new ground for us  
Watching me cracking up  
  
Shell hang round fellas  
With all the groundswellers  
Driving me like a truck  
  
But then she knows its like a curse  
To find our chosen roles reversed  
To unify my universe  
To call me mellow  
  
But then she knows its like a curse  
To find our chosen roles reversed  
To unify my universe  
To call me mellow  
  
Fill the sky with love Repeat x3
