Chorus  
If the world would end today  
All the dreams we had would all just drift away  
You know theres nothing more to say  
If the world would end would our love slip away  
  
I never knew the way that you looked at me  
Would ever mean so much to me  
In my heart I found the feelings that Ive never shown  
Now theyve got the best of me  
  
Chorus  
  
I never thought all the love I was looking for  
Could ever be so close to me  
Your the only one that Ive ever loved that has ever loved me  
And now youve got the best of me  
  
If the world would end today  
All the dreams we had would all just drift away  
You know theres nothing more to say  
  
Chorus
