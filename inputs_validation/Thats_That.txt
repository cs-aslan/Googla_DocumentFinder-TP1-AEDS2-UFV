What can I say  
My position is clear  
When it comes to you  
I got the right idea  
I just cant stand you  
For one more day   
When daylight breaks  
Ill be miles away  
Cause I know what I want  
And I know you do too  
So thats that  
  
This is the day I stand up and fight  
Theres no price on my head  
I know Im right  
The debt is all yours  
Now Im going away  
I got a feeling someday youll repay
