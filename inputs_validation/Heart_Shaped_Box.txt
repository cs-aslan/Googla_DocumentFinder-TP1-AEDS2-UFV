She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak  
Ive been locked inside your HeartShaped box for weeks  
Ive been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap  
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black  
  
Hey Wait  
Ive got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
Hey Wait  
Ive got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
Your advice  
  
Meateating orchids forgive no one just yet  
Cut myself on angel hair and babys breath  
Broken hymen of your highness Im left black  
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back  
  
Hey Wait  
Ive got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
Hey Wait  
Ive got a new complaint  
Forever in debt to your priceless advice  
  
Your advice  
Your advice
