Im only twenty three for another hour give or take  
Im a fan of yours and I need a good mistake  
Im not a sinner or preacher all I have is slight of hand  
I do magic tricks for all the boys in the band  
  
Baby could I be the rabbit in your hat  
Id swing if youd hand me hand me the bat  
  
Im on the road of least resistance  
Id rather give up than give in to this  
So promise me only one thing would you  
Just dont ever make me promises  
No promises oh no promises  
Oh  
  
Ive never done this before promises promises  
But Im enjoying the illusion and the things my body says  
Now you see me now you dont oh how well you disappear  
What are you running from and may I interfere  
  
Baby could I be the rabbit in your hat  
Id swing if youd hand me hand me the bat  
  
Oh oh baby could I be the rabbit in your hat  
Id swing if youd hand me hand me the bat  
  
Im on the road of least resistance  
Id rather give up than give in to this  
So promise me only one thing would you  
Just dont ever make me promises  
No promisesno no no promises  
  
Oh no no no no promises  
  
Im on the road of least resistance  
Id rather give up than give in to this  
So promise me only one thing would you  
Just dont ever make me promises  
No promises  
  
No no no no promises  
No no no no promises  
No no promises
