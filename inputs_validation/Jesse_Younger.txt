Little Jesse Younger was a well respected lad  
Doing all he could to please his mommy and his dad  
But he never planned to be the man  
They said that hed become  
And somehow or another Jesses little baby brother  
Is his fathers and his mothers only son  
Every day the neighbors say that its a dirty shame  
The way he spat upon his family and scandalized their name  
And his parents never really ever said hed been disowned  
But somehow or another now his little baby brother  
Is his fathers and his mothers only son  
Oh Jesse Younger youre a devil not a man  
Can you dare to treat your parents so unkind  
You have selfishly refused to live your life the way they planned  
And youve started going your own way and speaking your own mind  
Jesse Youngers parents wonder where it all went wrong  
Now that Jesses name has turned to ashes on their tongues  
But he chose to starve asnd try to carve a future of his own  
And he got his druthers because now his younger brother  
Is his fathers and his mothers only son  
Oh Jesse Younger youre a devil not a man  
Can you dare to treat your parents so unkind  
You have selfishly refuysed to live your life the way they planned  
And youve started going your own way and speaking your own mind
