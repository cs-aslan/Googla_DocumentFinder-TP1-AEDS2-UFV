Passing on  
On my own it was  
Given to me  
By these  
Causes unknown I dont  
Know why  
We have to live  
In prisons like  
These words  
Hollow  
Though its not too late  
To escape from it  
  
Coming down  
From the high  
I dont live too long  
Before it  
Take a fall  
And just say  
Its alright  
Anywhere  
  
Take us to heaven  
Listen  
Because you know  
That I cant hear it  
Simple  
Just your living soul  
On my own  
I never  
So I thought that  
They were higher  
I thought too  
  
Coming down  
From the high  
I know it  
Wont be long will it  
Take a fall  
And just say  
Its just wrong  
To come wanting  
To come wanting  
  
I dont even  
Know the answer  
But its not been not been  
Taken further further  
The very last one  
That youll hear from  
  
Whyd you think Id try to  
I dont even try to  
I dont even want to  
Hey hey hey  
  
I dont even try to  
You dont even want to  
I dont even know that  
Hey hey hey  
  
I dont even want to  
You wont even know it  
I havent even tried to  
Hey hey hey  
  
I dont even like you  
I wont even  
Come near you  
But youll try
