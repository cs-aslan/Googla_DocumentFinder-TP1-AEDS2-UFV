I used to think that life was sweet  
I used to think it was so complete  
I cant believe you youve thrown it away  
I used to think we had it made  
I used to feel we would sail away  
Can you just imagine how I feel today  
Well it seems a long time ago  
You were the lonely one  
Now it comes to letting go  
And youre the only one  
Do you know what youve done  
Its so funny how we dont talk anymore  
Its so funny why we dont talk anymore  
But I aint losing sleep and I aint counting sheep  
Its so funny how we dont talk anymore  
It really doesnt matter to me  
I guess your leaving was meant to be  
Its down to you now  
You want to be free  
Well I hope you know which way to go  
Youre on your own again  
Dont come running to me when youre the lonely one  
Remember what youve done  
Its so funny how we dont talk anymore  
Its so funny why we dont talk anymore  
Its so funny how we dont talk  anymore
