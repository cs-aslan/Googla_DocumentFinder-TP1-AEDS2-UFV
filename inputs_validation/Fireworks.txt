Tragically Hip Fireworks lyrics  
If theres a goal that everyone remembers  
It was back in ol 72  
We all squeezed the stick and we all pulled the trigger  
And all I remember was sitting beside you  
You said you didnt give a fuck about hockey  
And I never saw someone say that before  
You held my hand and we walked home the long way  
You were loosening my grip on Bobby Orr  
  
Isnt it amazing anythings accomplished  
When the little sensation gets in your way  
Not one ambition whisperin over your shoulder  
Isnt it amazing you can do anything  
  
We hung out together every single moment  
Cause thats what we though married people do  
Complete with the grip of artificial chaos  
And believing in the country of me and you  
Crisis of faith and crisis in the Kremlin  
And yea wed heard all of that before  
Its wintertime the house is solitude with options  
And loosening the grip on a fake cold war  
  
Isnt it amazing what you can accomplish  
When you dont let the nation get in your way  
No ambition whisperin over your shoulder  
Isnt it amazing you can do anything  
  
Next to your comrades in the national fitness program  
Caught in some eternal flexedarm hang  
Droppin to the mat in a fit of laughter  
Showed no patience tolerance or restraint  
  
Fireworks exploding in the distance  
Temporary towers soar  
Fireworks emulating heaven  
Til there are no stars anymore  
Fireworks aiming straight at heaven  
Temporary towers soar  
Til there are no stars shining up in heaven  
Til there are no stars anymore  
Isnt it amazing what you can accomplish  
When the little sensation gets in your way  
No ambition whisperin over your shoulder  
Isnt it amazing what you can accomplish eh  
This one thing probably never goes away  
I think this one thing is always supposed to stay  
This one thing doesnt have to go away
