Shes a rainbow and she loves the peaceful life  
Knows Ill go crazy if I dont go crazy tonight  
  
Theres a part of me in chaos thats quiet  
And theres a part of you that wants me to riot  
Everybody needs to cry or needs to spit  
Every sweettooth needs just a little hit  
Every beauty needs to go out with an idiot  
How can you stand next to the truth and not see it  
Change of heart comes slow  
  
Its not a hill its a mountain  
As you start out the climb  
Do you believe me or are you doubting  
Were gonna make it all the way to the light  
But I know Ill go crazy if I dont go crazy tonight  
  
Every generation gets a chance to change the world  
Pity the nation that wont listen to your boys and girls  
Is the sweetest melody the one we havent heard  
Is it true that perfect love drives out all fear  
The right to be ridiculous is something I hold dear  
But change of heart comes slow  
  
Its not a hill its a mountain  
As you start out the climb  
You see for me Ive been shouting  
But were gonna make it all the way to the light  
But I know Ill go crazy if I dont go crazy tonight  
  
Baby baby baby I know Im not alone  
Baby baby baby I know Im not alone  
Ha ha ha  
  
Its not a hill its a mountain  
You see for me Ive been shouting  
Lets shout until the darkness squeeze out sparks of light  
You know well go crazy  
You know well go crazy  
You know well go crazy if we dont go crazy tonight
