Catch a wave and youre sitting  
On top of the world  
  
Dont be afraid to try the greatest sport around  
Everybody tries it once  
Those who dont just have to put it down  
You paddle out turn around and raise  
And baby thats all there is  
To the coastline craze  
You gotta catch a wave and youre sittin  
On top of the world  
  
Not just a fad cause its been going on so long  
All the surfers going strong  
They said it wouldnt last too long  
Theyll eat their words with a fork and spoon  
And watch em theyll hit the road  
And all be surfin soon  
And when they catch a wave theyll be  
Sittin on top of the world  
  
Catch a wave and your sittin on top of the world  
  
So take a lesson from a topnotch surfer boy  
Get yourself a big board  
But dont you treat it like a toy  
Just get away from the shady turf  
And baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf  
And when you catch a wave youll be sittin  
On top of the world  
  
Catch a wave and youll be sittin  
On top of the world  
Catch a wave and youll be sittin  
On top of the world  
Catch a wave and youll be sittin  
On top of the world
