When I need company  
I call on you to see about me  
I wanna walk about it  
Talk about it  
Tell the world about you  
When your with me its so much fun  
Your all the good things wrapped in one  
I wanna walk about it  
Talk about it  
Tell the world about you  
Woah I wanna walk  
I wanna talk  
I wanna tell  
I wanna live  
Im gonna give  
Well have a love  
Chorus  
Your so fine  
And your so sweet  
Your better at love than a kbb  
I wanna walk about it  
Talk about it  
Tell the world about you  
Instrumental  
Woah I wanna walk  
I wanna talk  
I wanna tell  
Wah Im gonna live  
Im gonna give  
Well have a love  
Chorus
