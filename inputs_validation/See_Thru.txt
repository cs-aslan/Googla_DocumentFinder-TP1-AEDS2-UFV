No apology necessary shut your mouth  
Youve closed your mind  
Weve been walking this road forever  
It dont lead to paradise  
  
In the mirror your sad reflection haunting you  
Now I see mine  
Yes I see mine  
And you just dont get it  
  
But you just might regret it you might regret it  
Shooting the rainbows from the sky  
Throwing your love to passers by  
Begging forgiveness for your crime  
  
Never prepared to do your time  
Its always them and never you  
Cause youre so see through I see through you  
Cause youre so see thru  
  
Aint no use in demanding justice  
Youre a victim of your sight  
I held you up when your heart was heavy  
Now you never give me mine  
  
In the mirror my sad reflection haunting me  
One more time one more time  
And you just dont get it do ya  
But you just might regret it yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Shooting the rainbows from the sky  
Throwing your love to passers by  
Begging forgiveness for your crime
