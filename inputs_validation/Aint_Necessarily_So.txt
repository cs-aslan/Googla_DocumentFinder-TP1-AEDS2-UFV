You cant break your eggs to count your chickens  
And you cant break your neck to keep your ducks all in a row  
But dont think every chance you take has to mean a new mistake  
It aint necessarily so  
Now depending on the soil and the season  
You can plant a seed and you can watch it grow  
But you cant have a guarantee cause everything that aught to be  
Aint necessarily so  
I laugh when I can and I live with the rest  
I learned that holdin on means lettin go  
I try to be a friend to the person on my left  
They say you just cant be too careful who you know  
But that aint necessarily so  
Id like to have more faith in human logic  
Basin all the rules on the proof that you can show  
But I cant take my guesses back that I based on all those facts  
That aint necessarily so  
And every time I follow what Im feelin  
I end up in the same place my heart would have me go  
If theres one rule of life I trust its everything outside your gut  
Aint necessarily so  
I laugh when I can and I live with the rest  
I learned that holdin on means lettin go  
I try to be a friend to the person on my left  
They say you just cant be too careful who you know  
But that aint necessarily so  
I laugh when I can and I live with the rest  
I learned that holdin on means lettin go  
I try to be a friend to the person on my left  
They say you just cant be too careful who you know  
But that aint necessarily so
