Dommage dommage  
Our love was once exciting  
Now its just a game we play  
To bad but nothing last forever  
All at once weve lost our way  
  
Hello goodbye  
And suddenly its over  
And there is nothing  
We can do  
Dommage dommage  
Too bad we couldnt make  
  
Our dreams come true  
  
Hello goodbye  
And suddenly its over  
And there is nothing  
Nothing we can do  
  
Dommage dommage  
Too bad we couldnt make  
Our dreams Come True
