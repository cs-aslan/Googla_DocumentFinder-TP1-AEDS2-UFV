The alarm clock rings but you dont move  
But the wife gets up and puts on her uniform  
You hear her in the bathroom  
Cause shes got that nagging cough  
You put your head under the pillow  
To forget youve been laid off  
Suburban King  
Suburban King  
You had it printed on your van  
Cause it had a pretty ring  
Suburban King  
  
The union man said youd be recalled  
But the company up and moved to Taiwan  
You counted on the pension plan  
But you were out of luck  
The union says you only qualify  
For twentyfive bucks  
  
Suburban King  
Suburban King  
You had it printed on your van  
Cause it had a pretty ring  
Suburban King  
Suburban King  
  
Your American dream didnt mean a thing  
Suburban King
