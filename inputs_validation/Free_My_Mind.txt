Im a cosmic cowboy  
A big time player  
I like Pantera Kid Rock and Slayer  
I like IceT the rapper I mean  
When it comes to drinkin I like Jim Beam  
I play well strung guitars with a rebel flag  
But I dont wear makeup or dress in drag  
I smoke a lot Im a whiskey drinker  
I aint no hick songwriter  
Im a pretty neat thinker  
Im glad you came to see me put on a show  
My name is David Allan Coe I came to let you know that  
  
Chorus  
Ive been tryin to have a real good time  
Forget about thinkin tryin to free my mind  
Ive been tryin to have a real good time  
Forget about thinkin tryin to free my mind  
  
I own my own limosuine and a Cadillac  
I got a million dollar tour bus and thats a fact  
I aint broke but I aint rich  
I call women honey not hoe or bitch  
Im into Tanya Tucker Twisted Brown Truck  
The Allman Brothers Band and Marshall Tucker  
Im not in this for money I do it for fun  
And I dont shoot dope but I will shoot my gun  
  
I aint no phony dude  
Im the real thing baby  
Just like Rob Zombie just like Slim Shady  
  
Chorus  
And Ive been tryin to have a real good time  
Forget about thinkin tryin to free my mind  
Ive been tryin to have a real good time  
Forget about thinkin tryin to free my mind
