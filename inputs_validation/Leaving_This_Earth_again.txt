She takes a shower in a small town  
Near Birmingham  
Though here clothes are  
Unfashionable  
They have a timeless feel  
Is she real  
  
She leaves the building  
And walks through  
The housing estate  
Its 730  
A state grey sky  
But in spite of this  
She turns and blows a kiss  
  
Shes leaving this earth again  
Theres a shuttle bound for take off  
1145 am shell be there  
Shes special  
Oh so special  
Knows enough about science  
To get married to a millionaire  
Shell be there  
  
Hell comb his hair  
In a high rise apartment  
On the river Tyne  
Though his neck is scarred  
He has a strong and handsome face  
A human face  
He leaves the building  
And walks to his electric car  
Its 730 theres a bitter wind  
But in spite of that  
He turns and tips his hat  
  
Hes leaving this earth again  
Theres a shuttle bound for take off  
1145 am  
  
Hell be there  
Hes so special oh so special  
Knows enough about science  
To forget about his morning prayers  
Hell be there  
  
Im leaving this earth again  
Theres a shuttle bound for take off  
1145 am Ill be there  
Im special oh so special  
I was chosen by the captain  
Of a spaceship in Trafalgar Square  
And I promised Id be there or be square
