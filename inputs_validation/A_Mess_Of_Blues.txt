I just got your letter baby too bad you cant come home  
I swear Im going crazy sitting here all alone  
Since you gone I got a mess of the blues  
  
Whoops there goes a tear drop arolling down my face  
And if you cry when youre alone its surely no disgrace  
  
I aint slept a wink since Sunday I cant eat a thing all day  
And every day is just blue Monday since youve been away  
Since you gone I got a mess of the blues  
  
Whoops there goes a tear drop a rolling down my face  
And if you cry when youre alone its surely no disgrace  
  
I gotta get myself together before I lose my mind  
Im gonna catcha the next train going and leave my blues behind  
Since you gone I got a mess of the blues  
  
I gotta get myself together before I lose my mind  
Im gonna catcha the next train going and leave my blues behind  
Since you gone I got a mess of the blues  
Since you gone I got a mess of the blues  
Since you gone I got a mess of the blues
