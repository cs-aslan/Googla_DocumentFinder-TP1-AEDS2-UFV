Just around the corner theres heartaches  
Down the street that losers use  
If you can wade in through the teardrops  
Youll find me at the home of the blues  
I walk and cry while my heart beat  
Keeps time with the drag of my shoes  
The sun dont shine through this window of mine  
Cause its dark at the home of the blues  
  
Oh but the place is filled with the sweetest memories  
Memories so sweet that I cry  
And dreams that Ive had left me feeling so bad  
I just wanna give up and lay down and die  
  
So if you just lost your sweetheart  
And it seems that theres no good way to choose  
Well come along with me misery loves company  
And youre welcome at the home of the blues  
Cause just around the corner theres heartaches  
Down the street that losers use  
If you can wade in through the teardrops  
Youll find me at the home of the blues  
Youll find me at the home of the blues  
Youre gonna find me at the home of the blues
