Peter Allen  
  
Well go away  
Make love all day  
Youll never stay  
But its a nice dream  
  
Just me for you  
Our whole life through  
It wont come true  
But its a nice dream  
  
Such a nice dream  
So kiss me goodbye  
Im sorry that it went so fast  
Our future has become our past  
Too good we couldnt last  
Oh and now we see  
With you and me  
Ones gotta let go  
But its a nice dream  
Oh baby such a nice dream  
  
So kiss me goodbye  
Im sorry that it went so fast  
Our future has become our past  
Too good we couldnt last  
Mmm and now we see  
With you and me  
Ones gotta let go  
And let the other go free  
Aah in love well still be  
Oh it proves it was real  
It was a real nice dream
