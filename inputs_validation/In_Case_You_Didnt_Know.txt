Maybe youre out tonight  
With somebody else by your side  
Oh oh oh oh  
You forgot about me yeah  
And I guess youre moving on  
You got sick of me like a song  
Oh oh oh oh  
Thats playing on repeat  
  
While youre living the good life  
I feel a sharp knife  
Stabbing me straight through the heart  
  
You gotta know that Im here all alone  
Wondering if you feel this low  
As I do without you oh oh oh oh  
In case you didnt know  
Since you left Ive been miserable  
Why did you have to go oh oh  
  
So I dated other girls yeah  
I tried everything in the world  
Oh oh oh oh  
To forget your face  
Why would anyone stick around  
When I get up screaming out  
At the worst time  
Your name  
  
Thats while youre living the good life  
I feel a sharp knife  
Stabbing me straight through the heart  
  
You gotta know that Im here all alone  
Wondering if you feel this low  
As I do without you oh oh oh oh  
In case you didnt know  
Since you left Ive been miserable  
Why did you have to go oh oh  
  
Can you hear me when I say  
I really want you  
I really need you  
Oh oh oh oh  
In case you didnt know  
I really want you  
I really need you  
Oh oh oh oh  
In case you didnt know  
  
Dont even know if you care  
That Im waiting right here  
Unable to make one move  
Still waiting for you to call  
Banging my head against the wall  
Im so hopeless without you  
  
Im here all alone  
Wondering if you feel this low  
As I do without you oh oh oh oh  
In case you didnt know  
Since you left Ive been miserable  
Why did you have to go oh oh  
  
Can you hear me when I say  
I really want you  
I really need you  
Oh oh oh oh  
In case you didnt know  
I really want you  
I really need you  
Oh oh oh oh  
In case you didnt know  
In case you didnt know  
In case you didnt know
