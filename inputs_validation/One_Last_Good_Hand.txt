The stars are way out of reach they all said  
Those are crazy schemes that fill your fool head  
But it was clear from the moment we met  
We could prove them wrong  
  
All my life I heard that same old story  
Dare to dream and youll just be sorry  
I might have given up my shot at glory  
But then you came along  
  
Chorus  
Were not expecting this to go down easy  
Were not expecting any sweet dreams  
Sure thing  
But with a little luck  
Could be well be  
Winding up the way we planned  
Heading for our promised land  
Holding one last good hand  
  
Somethings calling us I know you hear it  
Day by day I feel us growing near it  
But once you find a kindred spirit  
Theres nothing you can do  
  
Oh baby Im not saying we wont ever stumble  
Some days will be rough and tumble  
You and I know that lifes a gamble  
But Ill  
Bet mine on you  
  
Chorus
