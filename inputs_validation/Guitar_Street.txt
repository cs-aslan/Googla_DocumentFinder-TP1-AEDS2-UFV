Theres a crazy sense of duty  
As he licks between his fingers  
Wipes the ketchup from his face and hands  
Theres a strong determination  
That his teachers never witnessed  
Never close enough to understand  
Hes like a bull just bred for fighting  
He dont deliver nothing  
Outside the only thing that he knows  
  
School report just says hes lazy  
His brother says hes crazy  
But take a look cause there he goes  
  
Through the avenues of fashion  
To the palaces of dreams  
All the way down Guitar Street  
  
To some guitars are hotrods  
All along the quest for macho  
To others a wouldbe ticket out of town  
For Joe a sixstring sten gun  
In the Pantorevolution  
And Stevies all just strictly sound  
Hes like a bull just bred for fighting  
He dont deliver nothing  
Outside the only thing that he knows  
  
School report just says hes lazy  
His brother says hes crazy  
But anyway take a look cause there he goes  
Through the avenues of fashion  
To the palaces of dreams  
All the way down Guitar Street
