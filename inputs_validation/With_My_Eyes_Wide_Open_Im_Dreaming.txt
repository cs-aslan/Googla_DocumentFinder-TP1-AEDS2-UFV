With my eyes wide open Im dreaming  
Can it be true Im holding you close to my heart  
With my eyes wide open Im dreaming  
Youre with me now sharing a vow never to part  
  
When Im so afraid  
To close my eyes  
Afraid that Ill find  
This lovely thrill is just a silly illusion  
  
With my eyes wide open Im dreaming  
Do I deserve such a break  
Pinch me to prove Im awake  
Cause I cant believe that youre really mine  
  
Im so afraid  
This is just an illusion  
  
With my eyes wide open Im dreaming  
Do I deserve such a break  
Please pinch me to prove Im awake  
I cant believe that youre really mine  
  
Youre really mine  
Am I dreaming I must be dreaming  
With my eyes wide open  
Eyes wide open
