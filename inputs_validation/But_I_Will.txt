Remember when I said  
The next time would be the last time  
That time came this mornin  
When you came in  
  
You always had a line  
To change my mind  
So I guess you thought  
Id just let you break my heart again  
  
I dont want to stop lovin youbut I will  
I dont like wakin up alonebut I will  
Youre the only one  
Who can make my heart stand still  
I dont want to let you gobut I will  
  
I could write a book  
On the innocent looks youre giving me  
Youve got one for every story you tell  
Ive seen it all and Im not gonna fall  
  
For those make believe tears  
So darlin I will try to make it clear  
  
I dont want to stop lovin youbut I will  
I dont like wakin up alonebut I will  
Youre the only one  
Who can make my heart stand still  
I dont want to let you go but I will  
  
Youre the only one who  
Can make my heart stand still  
I dont want to let you gobut I will
