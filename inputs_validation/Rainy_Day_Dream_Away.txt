Hey man take a look out the window n see whats happnin  
Hey man its rainin  
Its rainin outside man  
Aw dont worry bout that  
Everythings gonna be everything  
Well get into somethin real nice you know  
Sit back and groove on a rainy day  
Yeah  
Yeah I see what you mean brother lay back and groove  
  
Rainy day dream away  
Ah let the sun take a holiday  
Flowers bathe an ah see the children play  
Lay back and groove on a rainy day  
  
Well I can see a bunch of wet creatures look at them on the run  
The carnival traffic noise it sings the tune splashing up n  
Even the ducks can groove rain bathin in the park side pool  
And Im leanin out my window sill diggin evrything  
And ah and you too  
  
Rainy day rain all day  
Aint no use in gettin uptight  
Just let it groove its own way  
Let it drain your worries away yeah  
Lay back and groove on a rainy day hey  
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
