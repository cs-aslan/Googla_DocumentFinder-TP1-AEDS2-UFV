Piano playing cats  
Big mouth drunken whores

As we change our minds  
At least a half a dozen times  
Are we leaning red or are we leaning blue

The oils constant flow  
Through the gulf of Mexico  
Anyone for battered shrimp

Some idiot start to fester  
Where he shot that child molester  
Some call him hero some call him con

Another arrogant ass

At the infrastructure wreckers  
Sayin what you gonna do about that gun control
