The sky is crying  
Can you see the tears roll down the street  
The sky is crying  
Can you see the tears roll down the street  
Ive been looking for my baby  
And Ive been wondering where can she be  
  
I saw my baby early one morning  
She was walking on down the street  
I saw my baby early one morning  
She was walking on down the street  
You know it hurt me hurt me so bad  
It made my poor heart skip a beat  
  
I got a real real fine feeling  
That my baby she dont love me no more  
I got a real real fine feeling  
That my baby she dont love me no more  
You know the skys been crying  
Can see you see the tears roll down my door
