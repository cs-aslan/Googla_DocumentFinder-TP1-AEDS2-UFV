Flashback  
Writers jennifer hanson jim pattonJohnson  
  
You were born between a rock and a hard place  
To a couple of losers  
I lived on the other side of your duplex  
I heard you getting those bruises  
I never wouldve wanted to walk in your shoes  
It scared me to death I was a kid too  
Sometimes I think about you  
Travis are you out there somewhere  
Searching for somebody to care  
Are you doing the same thing  
That your daddy did to you  
Wish I could have helped you somehow  
Wonder if its just too late now  
Saw your pain how come nobody  
Seemed to have a clue  
Is your world still black and blue  
Travis Travis  
Did you follow in your mamas footsteps  
Strung out on bad things  
Just a product of circumstances  
Never taught what love means  
Travis I hope you did it different this time  
All you had to do was make up your mind  
Well how did you decide to live your life  
Travis are you out there somewhere  
Searching for somebody to care  
Are you doing the same thing  
That your daddy did to you  
Wish I could have helped you somehow  
Wonder if its just too late now  
Saw your pain how come nobody  
Seemed to have a clue  
Is your world still black and blue  
Travis Travis  
And the circle goes round  
Until someone hears the sound  
Of a breaking heart  
Wish I could have helped you somehow  
Wonder if its just too late  
Saw your pain how come nobody  
Seemed to have a clue  
Is your world still black and blue  
Travis Travis Travis Travis Travis
