Me and my friends gonna make a pile of money  
Gonna check it out every day  
Me and my wife gonna need every penny  
Cause were throwing it all away  
  
But Im changing my tune  
And Im breaking away  
  
Me and my friends were rugged little rockers  
And were lazing away the day  
Hot wax jackedup on the television  
And forgetting about the pay  
  
But Im changing my tune  
And Im breaking away  
Breaking away  
  
Four rockers rollin  
With a poet in the wings  
Waiting to blow his heart away  
Beanos with the roadcrew  
Postcards to the wife  
Stating the menu of the day  
Flying through til breakfast  
Sleeping on the plane  
Looking a good deal  
Better than well ever feel again  
  
Is it really worth it  
Could it all be real  
Am I just living out a dream  
Sitting in a hotel  
Falling of the stage  
Tuning in to Wonga Queen  
Old men in boys clothes  
Has gone beyond a joke  
Skin me another  
And pass along the Wiskey and the Coke  
  
Me and my friends are hating everybody  
Who was telling us what to say  
Heads down rockin on up and down the country only  
Living from day to day  
  
And Im changing my tune  
And Im breaking away  
Breaking away
