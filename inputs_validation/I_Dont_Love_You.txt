I dont love you  
I just want you  
If I dont have you never be the same  
I dont love you but girl youd drive a man  
Insane  
I dont love you  
But I need you  
I dont even want to know your name  
Every single minute you know is causing me  
Great pain  
I dont come from cross the RR tracks  
I dont need no little body hangin off my back  
If you got plans for me  
Youd better start singin the blues
