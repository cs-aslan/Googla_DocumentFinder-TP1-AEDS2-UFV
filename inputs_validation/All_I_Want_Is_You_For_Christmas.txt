I dont want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
I dont care about the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas  
Is you  
  
I dont want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
And I dont care about the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
I dont need to hang my stocking  
There upon the fireplace  
Santa Claus wont make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas Day  
  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas is you  
You baby  
  
Oh I wont ask for much this Christmas  
I wont even wish for snow  
And Im just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
  
I wont make a list and send it  
To the North Pole for Saint Nick  
I wont even stay awake to  
Hear those magic reindeer click  
  
Cause I just want you here tonight  
Holding on to me so tight  
What more can I do  
Baby all I want for Christmas is you  
You  
  
Oh all the lights are shining  
So brightly everywhere  
And the sound of childrens  
Laughter fills the air  
  
And everyone is singing  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa wont you bring me the one I really need  
Wont you please bring my baby to me  
  
Oh I dont want a lot for Christmas  
This is all Im asking for  
I just want to see my baby  
Standing right outside my door  
  
Oh I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
Baby all I want for Christmas is  
You baby  
  
All I want for Christmas is you baby  
All I want for Christmas is you baby  
All I want for Christmas is you baby
