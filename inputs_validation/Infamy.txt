Dont you know youve got it in for me  
I knew it right from the start  
Im still learning my lines baby  
Since youve rewritten my part  
  
Oh why have you got it in for me  
Things they are not what they seem  
Youre living in a nightmare baby  
But I mistook it for a dream  
Yeah just for a dream  
But I mistook it all for a dream yeah  
  
Youve got it in for me  
I know youve got it in for me  
You didnt miss a thing  
Its you that wrote the song baby  
But me whos got to sing  
  
I knew you had it in for me  
Where you take it from here  
We got along so famously  
This time you made it clear yeah  
  
You made it very very clear  
You made it abundantly clear  
  
Youve got it in for me  
I knew it right from the start  
Youve already convicted me  
Why are you hard on my heart  
  
Ooh youre right on my heart  
Oh yes so hard  
So hard on my heart you got it in for me  
Ooh in for me baby you got it in for me  
Why baby why baby why you got it in for me  
All you want to do is wipe the floor with me you got it in for me  
Come on why baby why you got it in for me  
Hummm  
Right from the start you got it in for me  
Yes youve got it in for me you got it in for me  
In for me right from the start you got it in for me

Fine fine heart you got it in for me
