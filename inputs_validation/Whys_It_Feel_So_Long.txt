I just kissed you goodbye  
A half an hour ago  
I know youve driven to the airport  
But I just gotta pick up the phone  
And hear you one more time  
Saying my name  
I must be going outta my mind  
  
Whys it feel so long  
Since youve been gone  
Whys it feel so long  
  
Time keeps dragging on  
Til you get back home  
Whys it feel so long  
Baby  
  
Cause I miss you babe  
  
Ive never loved anyone like I love you  
So when youre not around  
I must confess I lose myself  
And I dont know who where I am  
I might be crazy  
Crazy about being your man  
  
Whys it feel so long  
Since youve been gone  
Whys it feel so long  
I dont know why  
Time keeps dragging on  
Til you get back home  
Whys it feel so long  
  
When I finally see you  
I know itd be like never left alone  
But theres no cantillation  
Tonight isnt waiting  
Praying maybe youll come  
Coming coming babe  
  
Tell me now  
  
Whys it feel so long  
Since youve been gone  
Whys it feel so long  
I dont know why  
Time keeps dragging on  
Til you get back home  
Whys it feel so long  
  
Whys it feel so long  
Since youve been gone  
Whys it feel so long  
I dont know why  
Time just cross along  
Til you get back home  
Whys it feel so long  
  
I look at my watch  
Stare at the clock  
And they dont move  
I dont need a round  
Im just froze on the couch  
Oh the seconds feel like hours  
An hours like a day  
Its a twilight zone in this home  
When you go away  
  
Please dont go away
