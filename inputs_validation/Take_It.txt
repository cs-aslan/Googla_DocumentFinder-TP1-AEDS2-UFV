Just take it take it  
Just take it take it  
  
I know what you do  
Flash me  
The way its done  
Impolitely  
Just tying to find  
Some alone time  
No room to compromise  
  
Just take it take it  
Cant take it take it  
  
She sent your picture to a magazine  
And babys arent true photography  
Is that what you always wanted to be  
Well Id be worried for you  
  
Sometimes  
Gotta try  
Run and hide  
Get away from this  
Ill get by  
In this life  
This time  
  
Take your best shot  
And press me  
Write a fictional story  
For your fee  
Try to get the world  
To believe  
Shocking hell I surprise  
  
Just take it take it  
Cant just take it take it  
  
She sent your picture to a magazine  
And babys arent true photography  
Is that what you always wanted to be  
Well Id be sorry for you  
  
Sometimes  
Gotta try  
Run and hide  
Get away from this  
Ill get by  
In this life  
This time  
  
You see me  
I see you  
Youre over there  
You see me  
I see you  
  
She sent your picture to a magazine  
And babys arent true photography  
Is that what you always wanted to be  
Well Id be sorry for you  
  
Sometimes  
Gotta try to  
Run and hide  
Get away from shit  
Sometimes  
Gotta try  
Run and hide  
Get away from this
