Pour out your heart  
The feelings never fade away  
So where are you now  
I loved you more than I can say  
You wouldnt see couldnt touch cant believe its true  
  
Your love feels like home  
Youre my obsession  
All the things we did  
Whats left is just a photograph  
Everything I held so close  
Was never meant to last  
  
Youre in my heart  
Its never gonna fade away  
Your love feels like home  
Youre my obsession  
  
If I could find all the dreams Ive made  
Id turn the clock back to yesterday  
To hold onto what I got with you  
Shine bright like all the stars  
Unlock every dream Ive made  
Id turn tomorrow into yesterday  
All the things we did  
  
Whats left is just a photograph  
You wouldnt see couldnt touch cant believe its true  
Your love feels like home  
Youre my obsession
