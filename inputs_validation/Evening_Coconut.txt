The Statue of Liberty  
Is breathing in the air  
Atlantis is waiting down below  
Late at night flashing lights  
Are sighted in the air  
Its no secret  
What everybody knows  
It really dont matter much  
Which way I go  
But remember  
To pull over in the storm  
  
Have you seen the evening coconut  
Bobbing on the bay  
Standing on  
The waters edge of stone  
Someone there besides you  
To hear the words you say  
To show you things  
Your eyes have never known  
  
Evening coconut evening coconut  
Evening coconut evening coconut  
Evening coconut evening coconut  
Evening coconut evening coconut  
Evening coconut evening coconut  
  
The Statue of Liberty  
Is breathing in the air  
While Atlantis  
Is waiting down below  
Late at night flashing lights  
Are sighted in the air  
Its no secret  
What everybody knows  
  
Evening coconut evening coconut  
Evening coconut evening coconut  
Evening coconut evening coconut  
Evening coconut evening coconut
