Its a cinch to pass the time with you  
But hard to pass the time alone  
Can you take it  
And its true  
  
True the couple next to you  
Think you look strange  
Alone what are your aims  
Or do you have any  
  
Avoid confusion  
You always know  
Always know how much your paying  
I concentrate on  
  
On what the people say  
The couple next to me  
Pass the salt pour it in my wounds  
It looks like you have no friends  
  
Cant keep up with the new trends  
Sorry sorry for myself I dont agree  
No I always go out eating with my best friends  
Its less than normal  
  
Avoid confusion  
You always know  
Always know how much your paying  
I concentrate on  
  
On what the people say  
The couple next to me  
Avoid confusion  
You always know  
  
Always know how much your paying  
I concentrate on  
On what the people say  
I think at times
