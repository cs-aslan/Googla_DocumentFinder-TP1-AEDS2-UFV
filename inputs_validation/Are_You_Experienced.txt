If you can just get your mind together  
Then come across to me  
Well hold hands an then well watch the sun rise  
From the bottom of the sea  
But first  
  
Are You Experienced  
Ah Have you ever been experienced  
Well I have  
  
I know I know  
Youll probably scream n cry  
That your little world wont let go  
But who in your measly little world are trying to prove that  
Youre made out of gold and a cant be sold  
  
Soer Are You Experienced  
Ah Have you ever been experienced  
Well I have  
  
Ah let me prove it to you  
I think theyre calling our names  
Maybe now you cant hear them but you will  
If you just take hold of my hand  
  
Ah But Are You Experienced  
Have you ever been experienced
