See a young girl so soft and blonde  
Doesnt attack me but she did once  
Intoxications in her veins  
Sweet young boy plays with her brain  
Lydiall bring to life  
What are your chance not to oblige  
Putting his hand on her thigh  
Ability has now been ripped  
Take it away Id rather sit  
Sweet children sweet children sweet children Remember when  
Johnnys playing fun and games or else hes in the storage shed  
Running from the light of day or maybe lie and celebrate  
The funny circus from his head  
Follow me if you understand  
Ill trick her so shell do it  
Then Ill sing and now we run  
Sweet children sweet children sweet children Remember when  
Sweet children sweet children sweet children Remember when
