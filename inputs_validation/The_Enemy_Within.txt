Things crawl in the darkness  
That imagination spins  
Needles at your nerve ends  
Crawl like spiders on your skin  
Pounding in your temples  
And a surge of adrenaline  
Every muscle tense to fence the enemy within  
  
Chorus  
Im not giving in to security under pressure  
Im not missing out on the promise of adventure  
Im not giving up on implausible dreams  
Experience to extremes  
Experience to extremes  
  
Suspicious looking stranger  
Flashes you a dangerous grin  
Shadows across your window  
Was it only trees in the wind  
Every breath a static charge  
A tongue that tastes like tin  
Steelyeyed outside to hide the enemy within  
To you is it movement or is it action  
Is it contact or just reaction  
And yourevolution or just resistance  
Is it living or just existence  
Yeah you It takes a little more persistence  
To get up and go the distance  
  
Chorus
