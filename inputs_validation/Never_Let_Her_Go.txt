Everybody needs a someone  
Waitin to be there when things are alookin down  
So if you feel a little lonely  
Go out find your one and only  
Somewhere out there  
Someone will care for you and then  
Never let her go  
Never let her go

When the moment comes that youve been adreamin of  
Well true love takes a little longer  
Your heart beats a little stronger  
Youll know its real  
Inside youll feel youre home at last Then  
Never let her go  
Never let her go  
  
So if you feel a little lonely  
Go out find your one and only  
Open your heart  
Give love a start and watch it grow And  
Never let her go
