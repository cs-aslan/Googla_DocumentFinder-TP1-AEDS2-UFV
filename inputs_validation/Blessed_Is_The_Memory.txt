I remember the promise  
That you made in the barn  
When the kittens were born  
And you could not keep warm  
So you moved away the mountain  
That the sun rose behind  
And you said yourself a prayer  
And laid down with the blind  
But you lost them in your freedom  
And you need him now youre wild  
Blessed is the memory  
Of everybodys child  
And the vow of compassion  
That you swore through your teeth  
When the war began to end  
And the photographs weep  
Well nobody blames you  
As the train pulls away  
With its cargo of snow  
For these German paperweights  
But you lost them in your freedom  
And you need him now youre wild  
Blessed is the memory  
Of everybodys child  
Well its five in the morning  
Theres no one home  
Except for your wife  
And your child on the phone  
Somebodys got to listen  
To a promise or two  
Oh this room is far too small  
For a pilgrim like you  
But you lost them in your freedom  
And you need him now youre wild  
Blessed is the memory  
Of everybodys child  
So now that youve decided  
To follow the sun  
Like a shadow of birds  
Or a King on the run  
Oh your chains are too dark  
For the seas you must swim  
Youre smiling at the seaweed  
But your smile is too grim  
But you lost them in your freedom  
And you need him now youre wild  
Blessed is the memory  
Of everybodys child  
Blessed is the memory  
Of everybodys child  
Blessed is the memory  
Of everybodys child
