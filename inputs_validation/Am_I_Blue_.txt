Got up this morning  
Along about dawn  
Without a warning  
I found she was gone  
  
Why should she do it  
How could she do it  
Shed never done it  
Before  
  
Am I blue  
Am I blue  
Aint these tears  
In these eyes  
Tellin you  
  
Am I blue  
Youd be too  
If your dreams  
And your schemes  
Just fell through  
  
Was a time  
I was her only one  
But now Im  
The sad and  
Lonely one  
  
Was I gay  
Till today  
Now shes gone  
And were through  
Am I blue
