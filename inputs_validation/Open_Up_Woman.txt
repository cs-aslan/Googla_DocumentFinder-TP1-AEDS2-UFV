Im beggin forgiveness  
But its gonna take a miracle  
cause Ive been lyin  
She dont want to know and I think its impossible  
  
Said open up woman  
I know that youre sad and lonely  
If I could hold you  
We could make it again  
  
Listen all you men  
Be good and be warned  
Hell hath no fury  
Like the wrath of a woman scorned  
Open up woman  
Give me a chance  
  
No more lyin  
No more secrets  
If I could make you  
I would take you away and cover up your sadness  
I keep sayin open up woman  
But you dont want to hear my promise  
If I cant have you  
Then I dont need a heart  
  
Listen all you men  
Be good and be warned  
Hell hath no fury  
Like the wrath of a woman scorned  
Open up woman  
And give me a chance  
  
Listen all you men  
Be good and be warned  
Hell hath no fury  
Like the wrath of a woman scorned  
  
Livin in silence  
Of my own makin  
Though she wont show me  
I know that her heart and soul are achin  
  
Open up woman  
I know that youre lost and let down  
Im gonna keep tryin  
Stead of losin again  
  
Listen all you men  
Be good and be warned  
Hell hath no fury  
Like the wrath of a woman scorned  
  
Open up woman  
And give me a chance  
  
Open up woman  
Open up woman
