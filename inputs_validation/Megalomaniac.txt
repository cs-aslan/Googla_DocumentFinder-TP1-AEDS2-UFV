I hear you on the radio  
You permeate my screen its unkind but  
If I met you in a scissor fight  
Id cut off both your wings on principle alone  
On principle alone  
  
Hey megalomaniac  
Youre no Jesus  
Yeah youre no fucking Elvis  
Special as you know yourself  
Baby just step down step down  
  
If I were your appendages  
Id hold open your eyes  
So you would see  
That all of us are heaven sent  
There was never meant to be only one  
To be only one  
  
Hey megalomaniac  
Youre no Jesus  
Yeah youre no fucking Elvis  
Special as you know yourself  
Baby just step down step down  
  
Yeah  
Youre no Jesus  
Youre no Elvis  
Youre no answer  
  
Hey megalomaniac  
Youre no Jesus  
Yeah youre no fucking Elvis  
Special as you know yourself  
Just step down
