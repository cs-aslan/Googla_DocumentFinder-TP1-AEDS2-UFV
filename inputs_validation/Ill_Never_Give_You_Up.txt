Oh Ill Never Give You Up  Ill Never Give You Up  
Ill Never Give You Up  My Promise Lasts Forever  
Ill Never Give You Up  Ill Never Give You Up  
Ill Never Give You Up  We Tie Our Dreams Together  
  
Oh I Got What I Want  But I Lost What I Had  
A Slave To Your Love  Oh Youll Drive Me Mad  
Oh Whatever May Be  My Baby And Me  
Oh Ill Miss You Like Crazy  My Destiny  
Im Talking To Myself  I Cant Let You Go  
Were Gonna Make It Baby  I Know  
  
Its Higher Than Heaven  This Love Is No Lie  
Oh I Promise You This Love Is No Goodbye  
If You Love Him Girl I Will Sleep Beside  
All The The And Motion My Baby Cant Hide  
Ill Never Be So Wrong  Please Dont Say Goodbye  
We Are Gonna Make It  Give Us One More Try  
  
Chorus  
Oh Baby I Know  That Im Hurting You So  
Cant Stand The Pain  Oh I Cant Let You Go  
Ill Never Forget You  There Will Be A Day  
There Will Never Be A Girl  Who Looked At Me This Way  
  
Oh Ill Never Find Just What I Am Searching For  
But My Love For  Just Cant Ignore  
Oh What Are You Doing With The Rest Of Your Life  
Oh Without Your Love  I Cannot Survive
