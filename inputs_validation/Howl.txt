Howl  
Howl  
Fuck it  
I feel like howling  
Got nowhere to turn  
Theyll kill you  
For your spirit  
This is what you learn  
The music of tomorrow is  
What you feel today  
The owners of the future  
Is not the one they say  
A mountain of faces  
Is rapin my ear  
  
Im glad that my pride is  
Stronger than my fear  
Im howling baby  
Im howling baby  
Howling baby  
  
I knew the producer  
Hes got lots of tricks  
He is the star maker  
The bands are little pricks  
The music of tomorrow is  
What you feel today  
The owners of the future  
Is not the one they say  
A mountain of faces  
Is rapin my ear  
  
Im glad that my pride is  
Stronger than my fear  
  
Im howling baby  
Im howling baby  
Im howling baby  
Im howling baby  
  
Howling baby  
Howling baby  
Howling baby  
Howling baby  
Im howling baby
