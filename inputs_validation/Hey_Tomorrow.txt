Hey tomorrow where are you goin  
Do you have some room for me  
Cause night is fallin and the dawn is callin  
Ill have a new day if shell have me  
  
Hey tomorrow I cant show you nothin  
Youve seen it all pass by your door  
So many times I said I been changin  
Then slipped into patterns of what happened before  
  
Cause Ive been wasted and Ive overtasted  
All the things that life gave to me  
And Ive been trusted abused and busted  
And Ive been taken by those close to me  
  
Hey tomorrow youve gotta believe that  
Im through wastin whats left of me  
Cause night is fallin and the dawn is callin  
Ill have a new day if shell have me  
  
Hey tomorrow where are you goin  
Do you have some room for me  
Cause night is fallin and the dawn is callin  
Ill have a new day if shell have me  
Ill have a new day if shell have me
