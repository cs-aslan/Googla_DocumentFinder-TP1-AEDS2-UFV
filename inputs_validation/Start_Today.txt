Yesterday you were on my back just to  
Get my time I guess its not as precious  
As it seems because I found the time for  
Hangin out and talking on the phone what  
Should I expect now that my time is free  
And youre nowhere to be found  
  
next time Ill try for the first time in my  
Life it wont pass me by procrastinate it  
Can wait I put it off  
Lets start today  
  
my rooms a mess and I cant get  
Dressed I gotta be out by eight oclock  
Deep inside I know the answer well  
Theres no time like the present and Id  
Like to hang out but who doesnt Ive  
Made enough mistakes for this lifetime  
Now Im here to make amends  
  
next time Ill try for the first time in my  
Life it wont pass me by procrastinate it  
Can wait I put it off  
Start stop
