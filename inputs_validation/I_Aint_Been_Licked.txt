Roll down the gangway  
So theyll see that its me  
I know theyll wonder about my recovery  
Yes I lost a love that promised happiness  
What my heart wouldnt accept  
Put me to the test  
They keep a holding me down  
But I rise yes it can be done  
They keep a holding me down  
But I rise they cant make me run  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise got my second wind  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise tell em Im back again  
Just say I aint been licked  
I aint been licked  
I aint been licked  
Tell em for me I aint been licked  
Like outta nowhere  
My whole world fell apart  
Till this day no one knows  
What I felt in my heart  
All those precious things  
Inside me tried to still  
Hands I thought would help  
Pushed me over the hill  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise yes it can be done  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise they cant make me run  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise got my second wind  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise tell em Im back again  
Just say I aint been licked  
I aint been licked  
I aint been licked  
Tell em for me I aint been licked  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise just to start again  
Rise show em that I can  
Rise found a brand new dream  
Rise just to prove one thing  
Just say I aint been licked  
I aint been licked  
I aint been licked  
Tell em for me I aint been licked  
I want the world to see  
I aint been licked  
Although my love is gone  
I aint been licked  
Somehow I carry one  
I aint been licked  
Ill find the strength somehow  
I aint been licked  
I think Im ready now  
I aint been licked  
I aint been licked  
I aint been licked  
I aint been licked
