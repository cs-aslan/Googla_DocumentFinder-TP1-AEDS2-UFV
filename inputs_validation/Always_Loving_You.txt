The evening is lonesome babe  
And the dead of night is cruel  
And I recall all the things we done  
Ya know Im always loving you  
  
Sometimes I think that my trains done gone  
The way all old things must do  
Yet I still wait for its return  
Just like I still wait for you  
  
And I still hear that old whipperwill  
Ive seen the ghost of the midnight train  
And I still love to walk alone  
Down by the old union station in the rain  
  
Now I dont know where you are tonight  
But I feel you across the miles  
Am I still standing there inside your mind  
Just behind a pretty smile  
  
Hey babe can ya hear that old whipperwill  
Have ya seen the ghost on the midnight train  
Do you still love to go alone  
Down by the old union station in the rain  
Down by the old Montgomery station in the rain
