Not hurting any more  
Yo here we go  
  
You left the door wide open  
It was getting cold  
You never came home last night  
And I was upset  
Feeling lonley and old  
So I wept and cried  
You have cheated and lied  
  
Chorus  
All I wanted was to be with you  
But you wouldnt have it  
You left me alone  
And I got used to it  
And now Im not hurting anymore  
  
I screamed and I tried  
To get hold of myself  
Get a grip girl  
Because you need a new life  
And all I wanted was you  
But you were with your friends  
And thats were it ends  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Im preparing to run away  
Ive packed my bags  
And Im ready to go  
Then I see you  
And I stay  
  
Repeat chorus 2x
