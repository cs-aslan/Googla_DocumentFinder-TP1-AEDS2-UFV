I know shes sleeping with him  
But it cant be true  
She loves me too much  
Thats just something she wouldnt do  
  
Now you may say I look the other way  
You may think Im blind  
But I say dont go looking for what you dont want to find  
  
Wouldnt I be the one that youd come running to  
Wouldnt they be my arms  
I look into your eyes as you tenderly hold me  
So safe and secure oh how I wish I were  
  
I know shes sleeping with him  
But it cant be true  
  
I say to myself Ive given all I can  
I tell myself this game must end  
But in the mirror do I see a new man  
Or will I look the other way again  
  
I know shes sleeping with him  
But it cant be true  
  
I know it you know it everybody knows it  
I cant look the other way  
I wont look the other way again
