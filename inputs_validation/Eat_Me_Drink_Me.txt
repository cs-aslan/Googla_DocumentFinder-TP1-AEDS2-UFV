In the wasteland on the way to the Red Queen  
Its no wonder our stage clothes have dreams to be famous  
The trees in the courtyard are painted in blood so Ive heard  
She hangs the headless upside down to drain  
  
Eat me drink me  
Eat me drink me  
This is only a game  
This is only a game  
  
I was invited to a beheading today  
I thought I was a butterfly next to your flame  
A rush of panic and the lock has been raped  
This is only a game  
This is only a game  
  
But then our star rushes in feeling like a child and looking like a woman  
Shes been forecast with an attempt to kill herself  
But the ending didnt test well

Eat me drink me  
This is only a game  
This is only a game  
  
And now Im picking my skin and my scales  
I see my horror mirrored in your sundown of a blank stare
