I will never be untrue  
Do anything you would want me to  
Never stay out drinking  
no later than two  
two thirty  
I will never treat you mean  
and I wont cause no kind of scene  
Tell you all the people  
all the places I have been  
I will always treat you kind  
try to give you peace of mind  
Only you tell me that you love me  
one more time  
Now darling  
please dont be sad  
Dont run off like that  
when you get mad  
Cause if you do  
you gonna lose  
the best friend  
that you ever had  
Thats no lie  
I will never be untrue  
Do everything you want me to do  
Bring all my loving all my money  
bring it all home to you
