Thinking about what a friend just said  
You know nothing good comes easy  
You took the thought right from my head  
You only seem to tease me  
Then you turn  
It on again  
Then you turn  
Me on again  
Then I learn the answers to all my questions  
Now some things taking over  
Its the thrill of it the thrill of it  
Its the thrill of it  
Turn me on  
Its the thrill of it can you feel it  
The thrill of it its taking me over  
Now what am I supposed to do  
You know it cant go on much longer  
Every time when Im near you  
You know the feelings so much stronger  
Then you turn  
It on again  
Then you turn  
Me on again  
Then I learn the answers to all my questions  
Now some things taking over  
Its the thrill of it the thrill of it  
Its the thrill of it  
Turn me on  
Its the thrill of it can you feel it  
The thrill of it  
Its the thrill of it  
Turn me on  
Its the thrill of it can you feel it  
Its taking me over  
You know its taking me over  
You know its taking me over  
Then you turn  
It on again  
Then you turn  
Me on again  
Then I learn the answers to all my questions  
Now some things taking over  
Its the thrill of it the thrill of it  
Its the thrill of it  
Turn me on  
Its the thrill of it can you feel it  
Its the thrill of it  
Turn me on  
Its the thrill of it the thrill of it  
Its the thrill of it  
Turn me on  
Its the thrill of it can you feel it  
Its the thrill of it  
Turn me on  
Its the thrill of it  
Turn me on  
Its the thrill of it can you feel it
