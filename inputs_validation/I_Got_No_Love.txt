I got no love in me  
Guess whos to blame  
Its a crying shame  
Well its all because of you  
Dont live a lie its true oh oh  
I got no love in me  
Its a mystery  
How I just couldnt see  
You dogged me long enough  
Left me dry but Im tough  
I got no love in me  
You ask me who to blame  
Well its only you  
You ask me who I trust  
Well its me thats who  
Baby its true  
You hurt me so much  
Youre all I ever knew  
I knew it when I looked  
Into your eyes  
I should have known then  
I should have realized  
All of your lies  
Baby did not amount to love  
Just remember one thing  
What goes around comes around  
And what you did to me  
One day Ill make you see baby

You dogged me long enough  
Left me dry but Im tough

Bet you couldnt tell bet you didnt know  
Youre the only man I really loved  
Every single kiss every time we touched  
Imagined what you missed  
Imagine now baby hows it gonna be  
What you gonna do when you didnt have me  
Whatcha gonna do when its not real  
And hows it gonna feel  
Deep inside of me  
I hope you find what makes you happy  
Baby now that youre free

Guess whos to blame
