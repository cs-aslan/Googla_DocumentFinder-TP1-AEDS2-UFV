Oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah  
  
Sometimes I walk a little faster  
In the school hallway  
Just to get next to you  
Some days I spend a little extra  
Time in the morning  
Just to impress you  
  
Guess you dont notice  
Guess you dont need this  
Sad youre not seein what youre missin  
On the outside shyin away  
On the inside dyin to say  
  
Im unusual  
Not so typical  
Way too smart to be waiting around  
Tai chi practicing  
Snowboard champion  
I could fix the flat on your car  
I might even be a rock star  
I might even be a rock star  
  
Sometimes I wish when the phone rings  
That it would be you  
Saying lets hang out  
Then you confess  
That theres something special between us  
Why dont we find out  
You dont even know me  
Guess you dont need me  
Why youre not seein what youre missin  
On the outside shyin away  
On the inside dyin to say  
  
Im unusual  
Not so typical  
Way too smart to be waiting around  
Tai chi practicng  
Snowboard champion  
I could fix the flat on your car  
I might even be a rock star  
  
If you only knew the real me  
I might even be a rock star  
Im telling you that we are meant to be  
Now wouldnt it be nice if you could see  
That I really am a rock star  
  
Im unusual  
Not so typical  
Way too smart to be waiting around  
Tai chi practicing  
Snowboard champion  
I could fix the flat on your car  
Rockin it wherever we are  
  
Cuz Im really a rock star  
Cuz Im really a rock star
