I bet you shes the one  
Who helped you come undone  
Those changes  
She put you through  
Long long distance  
Youre overdue  
I bet you shed like to say  
Shes changed you in every way  
Shes so sure  
Now shes on the run  
She ran a red light  
You jumped the gun  
  
Chain reaction shades of passion  
We surrender lose control  
So now you lived a mystery  
You wont be  
Just one more casualty  
You stumble before you fall  
Wont be the last time  
No not at all  
In motion its on her way  
The red light  
Somebodys got to pay  
Those changes  
She put you through  
Long long distance  
Youre overdue  
  
Chain reaction shades of passion  
We surrender lose control  
Chain reaction  
Strange attraction  
Loves a viper steals your soul  
  
So now just where do we go  
Tell me where  
  
Chain reaction shades of passion  
We surrender lose control  
Chain reaction  
Strange attraction  
Loves a viper steals your soul
