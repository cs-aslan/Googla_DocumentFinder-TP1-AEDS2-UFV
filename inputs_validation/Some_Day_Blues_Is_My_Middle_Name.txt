Dark day people  
I know things will come my way  
Some day people  
I know things will come my way  
  
But as of now it seems  
To live it just dont pay  
  
My body is made of heartaches  
Blues is my middle name  
My heart is made of heartaches  
Blues is my middle name  
  
Makes no difference how hard I try  
Im mistreated just the same  
  
Everyones against me  
I dont care where I go  
Yes everyone forgets poor me  
I dont care where I go  
  
But I feel that someday somehow  
Hard luck will leave me I know
