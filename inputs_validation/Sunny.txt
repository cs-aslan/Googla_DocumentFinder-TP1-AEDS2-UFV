Were really missing you  
Were really missing you  
Oh and youve only just gone  
  
Oh well you punched and fell  
Then you felt embarrassed  
My heart goes out to you  
So I offered love  
And it was not required  
Oh what else can I do  
What else can I do  
  
Were really missing you  
Were really missing you  
And youve only just gone  
  
So Sunny send at least one thoughtful letter  
My heart goes out to you  
Tell us all how things are so much better  
My heart it left with you  
What else can I do  
  
Oh theyre not forgiving you  
And youre not even wrong  
  
Oh with your jean belt wrapped around your arm  
Oh Sunny my heart goes out to you  
And with a needle pressed onto tight skin  
Sunny I cry when I see where its taken you  
  
Aah  
Im here I wont move  
Aah  
Im here I wont move  
Aah  
Im here I will not move  
Aah
