Daily  
Ive been waiting  
For the time to pass  
And Let it fade in  
But baby my patience  
Is driving me crazy  
Making me fall apart  
What do you do  
When the truth isnt  
Quite enough  
They lookin at you  
Tellin you  
We need to break it up  
You need to trust what you do  
Its you and me my love  
But Ima make it up to you  
And show the world  
Im a changed man  
Cause you mean much to me  
I dont wanna be done  
Im doing all that I can  
And everybody hates Chris  
They can never understand  
So can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love again  
Girl I know I told you  
Baby this aint over  
This aint over  
It aint over  
I remember your touch  
God I miss you so much  
Please believe me  
Baby Im sorry  
And all of this money and fame  
Can never amount  
To every morning when I see your face  
What do you do  
When the truth isnt  
Quite enough  
They looking at you  
Tellin you  
We need to break it up  
You need to trust what you do  
Its you and me my love  
But Ima make it up to you  
And show the world  
Im a changed man  
Cause you mean much to me  
I dont wanna be done  
Im doing all that I can  
And everybody hates Chris  
They can never understand  
So can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love again again  
Girl I know I told you  
Baby this aint over  
This aint over  
It aint over  
Saying Im sorry  
Doesnt make it alright  
I know  
I know  
But I believe that we can make it  
If we try  
If we try  
Yeah yeah  
Wooaaaah  
Im a changed man  
Cause you mean much to me  
And I dont wanna be done  
Im doing all that I can  
And everybody hates Chris  
They can never understand  
So can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love  
Can we love again  
Girl I know I told you  
Baby this aint over
