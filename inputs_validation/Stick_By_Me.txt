Stick by me and Ill stick by you  
Stick by me and Ill stick by you  
  
My life here on earth would be useless cant you see  
If I didnt have you to stick by me  
I love you darling and thats no lie  
Stick by me and Ill stick by you  
When you cry I cry too  
Stick by me and Ill stick by you  
  
Friends may try to hurt us  
Scandalise our name  
But no one noone can tear us apart  
You have a place in my heart  
  
I love you darling and thats no lie  
Stick by me and Ill stick by you  
Remember my heart and love belongs to you  
Stick by me and Ill stick by you  
When you cry Ill cry too  
Stick by me and Ill stick by you  
  
Friends may try to hurt us  
Scandalise our name  
But no one noone can tear us apart  
You have a place in my heart  
  
I love you darling and thats no lie  
Stick by me and Ill stick by you  
Remember my heart and love belongs to you  
Stick by me and Ill stick by you  
When you cry Ill cry too  
Stick by me and Ill stick by you
