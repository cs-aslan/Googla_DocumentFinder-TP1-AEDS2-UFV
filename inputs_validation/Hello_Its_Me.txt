Andy its me havent seen you in a while  
I wished I talked to you more when you were alive  
I thought you were selfassured when you acted shy  
Hello its me  
  
I really miss you I really miss your mind  
I havent heard ideas like that in such a long long time  
I loved to watch you draw and watch you paint  
But when I saw you last I turned away  
  
When Billy Name was sick and locked up in his room  
You asked me for some speed I though it was for you  
Im sorry that I doubted your good heart  
Things always seem to end before they start  
  
Hello its me that was a great gallery show  
Your cow wallpaper and your floating silver pillows  
I wish I paid more attention when they laughed at you  
Hello its me  
  
Pop goes pop artist the headline said  
Is shooting a puton is Warhol really dead  
You get less time for stealing a car  
I remember thinking as I heard my own record in a bar  
  
They really hated you now all thats changed  
But I have some resentments that can never be unmade  
You hit me where it hurt I didnt laugh  
Your diaries are not a worthy epitaph  
  
Oh well now Andy guess weve got to go  
I wish some way somehow you like this little show  
I know its late in coming but its the only way I know  
Hello its me  
  
Goodnight Andy  
Goodbye Andy
