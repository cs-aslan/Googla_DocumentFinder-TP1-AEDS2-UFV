You tell me you like the taste  
You just need an excuse  
You tell me it calms your nerves  
You just think it looks cool  
  
You tell me you want to be different  
You just change for the same  
You tell me its only natural  
You just need the proof  
Did you fucking get it  
  
Its in my eyes  
Its in my eyes Repeat x3  
  
And it doesnt look that way to me  
In my eyes  
And it doesnt look that way to me  
In my eyes  
  
You tell me that nothing matters  
Youre just fucking scared  
You tell me that Im better  
You just hate yourself  
  
You tell me that you like her  
You just wish you did  
You tell me that I make no difference  
Well at least Im fucking trying  
What the fuck have you done  
  
Its in my eyes  
Its in my eyes Repeat x4  
  
And it doesnt look that way to me  
In my eyes  
And it doesnt look that way to me  
In my eyes
