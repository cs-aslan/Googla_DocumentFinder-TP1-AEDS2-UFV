Alright yall  
Hey hey ooh yeah  
Feels like my batterys in need of a jump  
Our love is running down done fell into a slump  
Give me a spark to get the fire burning  
A get my engine moving set these wheels a turning  
Our love could use some rejuvenation  
You bring the wine Ill bring the sweet conversation  
Romance is here to stay Ill testify cause I need some today

Jump start my heart  
Charge me up when Im running down  
Oh jump start my heart  
Lift my feet up off the ground

Satisfy me dont give me up  
Turn on the heat on a cold winters morning  
Dont let the seasons change and nature catch me calling  
Cant let this feeling just slip away  
Our love was meant to last forever and a day  
We cant neglect what we cherish the most  
So drop your foolish pride cause I need you more and more  
Nothing good comes easily
