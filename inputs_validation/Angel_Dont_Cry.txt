Uncanny woman  
You weaved your spell on me  
I was taken by the look in your eyes  
For all the wrong reasons  
You must have been a spiteful child  
Full of anger  
Raised by the hand of a duchess a mother and a heathen  
  
You laid your tender trap of crystals and wine  
Your neck was sweetly laced with a scent I did not mind  
  
I cant lie  
I cant lie  
I cant lie  
Angel dont cry  
Angel dont cry  
  
Queen of darkness  
You got your way with me  
You caressed evry part of me soul  
You got what you were after  
A savage and an angel  
You innocently hunger for love  
Still shivering from the coldness of you laughter  
  
You laid your tender trap of crystals and wine  
Your neck was sweetly laced with a scent I did not mind  
  
I cant lie  
I cant lie  
I cant lie  
Angel dont cry  
Angel dont cry  
No angel dont cry  
Angel dont cry  
No no no
