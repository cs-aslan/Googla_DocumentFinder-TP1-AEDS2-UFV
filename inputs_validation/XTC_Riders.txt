Judah to Jesse  
  
Youll be so far out of control  
Youll be out of your mind  
Youll feel nothing its taking a hold of you  
Wont ya leave all your pain behind  
  
XTC Riders  Riders out of control  
Get you higher higher  
Oh yeah  
XTC Riders  Riders  
Aint never going home  
Oh just let it ride  
  
Youll feel my X is taking control  
Youll be numb and blind  
Come kneel and pray for me for a little while  
To the Neon God thats in your mind  
  
Im your Messiah  
Dresses all in black  
Are you the chosen one  
Ill get you higher no turning back  
My Neon Son  
Riding the XTC  
Riding the XTC
