Quiet  
Such a quiet  
Its a quiet  
  
Wont somebody tell me  
Wont you let me know  
Quiet evening  
Im sleepy  
And Im holding on  
Ive got nowhere to go  
Quiet evening  
You know  
You still have friends  
And theyll be  
Waiting for you  
  
Quiet evening  
Youve been longing for  
Quiet evening  
Youve been longing  
Take this night  
For the sake  
Of your soul  
  
Moonlight calls  
And it covers you  
Theres nothing left  
But this hidden view  
Quiet evening  
Cars roll by  
On that motorway  
Others may  
Have a lot to say  
Quiet eveining  
You know  
You still have friends  
And theyll be  
Waiting for you  
  
Quiet evening  
Youve been longing for  
Quiet evening  
Youve been longing  
Some people might stay up  
Til its light  
But take this night  
For the sake of your soul  
  
Quiet  
Its a quiet  
Quiet  
Its a quiet
