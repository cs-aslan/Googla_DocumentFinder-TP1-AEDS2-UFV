This is hopeless  
Yes its so hopeless  
Cause youre not  
Coming back anymore  
  
Oh I tried  
Yes I tried to forget you  
Ive tried running around  
But I find  
  
That its hopeless  
Yes its hopeless  
I just cant get you  
Out of my mind  
  
I keep telling my heart  
That Im lucky  
That Im much better off  
All alone  
  
But its hopeless  
Its just hopeless  
Cause my heart has  
A mind of its own  
  
I walk away the nights  
Until the city lights  
Fade into another lonely day  
  
I still cant go to bed  
I walk some more instead  
But I just cant  
Walk those blues away  
  
I keep praying that youll  
Change your mind dear  
And Ill see your  
Sweet face at the door  
  
But its hopeless  
Yes its so hopeless  
Cause youre not  
Coming back anymore  
  
Yes its so hopeless
