Pleasures in my car  
Even in the bar as Im searching  
In the love thats strong  
Breathing in the song Im learning  
I am learning  
Pleasure in the sand  
Warm within the hand shes holding  
It is on the screen  
Adventures at nineteen Im searching  
I am searching in my heart  
Pleasure in my heart  
Never let us part for pleasure  
Workwork today  
Never let them pay for pleasure  
Leave or lose her from my heart  
Pleasure is your name  
I accept he blame for falling  
It is down the phone  
Living in your home Im calling  
I am calling  
Pleasure is a word  
When love is left unheardits burning  
It is on the screen  
Adventures at nineteen Im searching  
I am searching in my heart  
Why do you feel like breaking my heart  
What made you feel like breaking my heart tonight  
Now I am cryingnow I am crying  
Pleasure in my heart  
Never let us part for pleasure  
Workwork today  
Never let them pay for pleasure  
Leave or lose her from my heart
