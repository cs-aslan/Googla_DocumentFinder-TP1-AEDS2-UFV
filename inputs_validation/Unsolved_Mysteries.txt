Am I dreaming  
Or Stupid  
I think Ive been hit by cupid  
No one needs to know  
Right now

unknown at Lyricsandsongs Com  
  
I met a tall dark and handsome man  
And Ive been busy making big plans  
No one needs to know  
Right now  
I got my heart set  
My feet wet  
But he dont even know it yet  
No one needs to know  
Right now  
  
Ill tell him someday someway somehow  
But Im gonna keep it a secret for now  
  
I want bells to ring  
The choir to sing  
A white dress that gets to keep the kinda hold on thing  
But no one needs to know  
Right now  
  
Ill tell him someday someway someway  
But Im gonna keep it a secret for now  
  
Gonna have a little girl  
A little boy  
A little engy we call Leroy  
But no one needs to know  
Right now  
  
And Im not loohnly anymore at night  
And he dont knoohonly he can make it right  
And Im not loohnly anymore at night  
And he dont knoohonly he can make it right  
  
Am I dreaming  
Or Stupid  
But boy have I been hit by cupid  
No one needs to know  
Right now  
No one needs to know  
Right now  
No one needs to know right now
