I have often dreamed of a far off place  
Where a heros welcome would be waiting for me  
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face  
And a voice keeps saying this is where Im meant to be  
  
Ill be there someday I can go the distance  
I will find my way if I can be strong  
I know evry mile will be worth my while  
When I go the distance Ill be right where I belong  
  
Down an unknown road to embrace my fate  
Though that road may wander it will lead me to you  
And a thousand years would be worth the wait  
It might take a lifetime but somehow Ill see it through  
  
And I wont look back I can go the distance  
And Ill stay on track no I wont accept defeat  
Its an uphill slope but I wont lose hope  
Till I go the distance and my journey is complete  
  
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part  
For a heros strength is measured by his heart  
  
Like a shooting star I will go the distance  
I will search the world I will face its harms  
I dont care how far I can go the distance  
Till I find my heros welcome waiting in your arms  
  
I will search the world I will face its harms  
Till I find my heros welcome waiting in your arms
