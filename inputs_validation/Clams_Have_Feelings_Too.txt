Birds are dumb cause small bird brains  
But so are kids and old people  
Some birds talk most others sing  
I dont see you eat a talking bird  
  
Pigs smell bad they roll in poo  
But so do kids and elderly  
I dont see you chop off an old mans feet  
Put em in a mason jar and pickle them  
  
No chowder for you cause clams have feelings too  
Actually they dont have central nervousness  
No manhatten style clams have the right to smile  
Come to think about it they dont have a face  
  
They have no face no place for ears  
Theres no clam eyes to cry clam tears  
No spinal cord they must get bored  
Might as well just put them out of misery  
  
I dont beleive its selfish  
To eat defenceless shellfish  
  
No chowder for you clams have feelings too  
It could happen to you clams have feelings too  
I dont think they do clams have feelings too
