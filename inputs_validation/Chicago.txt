I got the surprise the surprise of my life  
I had to stop and stare  
I saw a man dancing with his own wife  
And you will never guess where  
  
Chicago Chicago  
That toddlin town the toddlin town  
Chicago Chicago  
Ill show you around I love it  
Bet your bottom dollar you lose the blues  
In Chicago Chicago  
The town that Billy Sunday could not shut down  
  
On State Street that great street  
I just want to stay I just want to stay  
They do things they dont do on Broadway say  
They have the time the time of their life  
I saw a man who danced with his wife  
In Chicago Chicago  
  
Chicago Chicaareareareareago  
Free and easy town brassy breezy town  
Chicago Chicaarearego  
Let me cool my heels riight down at Marshall Field  
Come and walk with me along the lake  
To the great hollar and hoot all through the loop  
Shout hownow to Mrs OLearys cow  
No sheshe life is peachy  
  
Chicago well meat at the pump room Ambassador East  
To say the least on shish kabab  
And best of squad we will see and yet please  
Dont tell me sin is rampant and rife  
Think of that man who danced with his wife  
  
In Chicago Chicagoo  
Im in this city  
What a wonderful windy time
