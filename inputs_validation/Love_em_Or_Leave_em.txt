Blowing cross the universe  
Like a shooting star that lost its way  
Looking back with no regrets  
Living tor what hasnt happened yet  
  
Love em or leave em  
No rhyme or reason  
Break out to make out  
No change in the season  
Love em or leave em  
Put out or get out  
Simple survival  
No more denial  
Love em or leave em  
  
Roller coaster flies oft the track  
Hits you in the face stabs you in the back  
They Jake your right leave nothing left  
Steal you blind your mind and leave you deaf  
  
Love em or leave em  
No rhyme or reason  
State of the nation  
Pure intoxication  
Feel the vibration  
The anticipation  
Simple survival  
No more denial  
  
Dont want to waste no time  
Im never losing track  
Ive seen til all and so much more  
But I aint seen nothing yet  
  
Love em or leave em  
No rhyme or reason  
State of the nation  
Pure intoxication  
Feel the vibration  
The anticipation  
Simple survival  
No more denial  
  
Love em or leave em
