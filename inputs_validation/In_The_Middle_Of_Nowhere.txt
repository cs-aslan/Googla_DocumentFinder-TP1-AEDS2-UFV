Where does our love lie  
In the middle of nowhere  
Will it soon pass me by  
In the middle of nowhere  
  
Baby wont you tell me  
What am I to do  
Im in the middle of nowhere  
Getting nowhere with you  
  
Mmm where did my heart land  
In the middle of nowhere  
Where are the dreams I planned  
In the middle of nowhere  
  
Listen to me baby  
Listen to my plea  
Im in the middle of nowhere  
And its worrying me  
  
Over and over again  
You tell me you need my love  
If what you say is true  
Why cant we be together  
  
Over and over you tell me  
Im all that youre thinking of  
Baby you know that I love you  
But I cant wait forever  
  
Where does our love lie  
In the middle of nowhere  
How can you let it die  
In the middle of nowhere  
  
Are you going to leave me  
Leave my heart astray  
Im in the middle of nowhere  
Come and show me the way  
  
Over and over again  
You tell me you need my love  
Baby you know that I love you  
But I cant wait forever  
  
Where does our love lie  
In the middle of nowhere  
How can you let it die  
In the middle of nowhere  
  
Are you going to leave me  
And leave my heart astray  
Im in the middle of nowhere  
Come and show me the way  
  
Hey where does out love lie  
Come on now  
Where does our love lie  
Right slap in the middle of nowhere  
Right slap in the middle of nowhere  
Right slap in the middle of nowhere
