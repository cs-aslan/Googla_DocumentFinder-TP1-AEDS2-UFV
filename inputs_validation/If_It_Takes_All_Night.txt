Oh here it comes again  
That old ennui  
I hope it wont stay long  
Well its everyman to his own thing  
And every singer to his song  
If youre feeling low  
And all upset  
  
Nothings going right  
You just make a wish  
Like in a fairy tale  
And Ill bewitch you  
If it takes all night  
There are many things  
That I could say  
To try and comfort you  
But I know the words youd like to hear  
Are simply I love you  
  
Sometimes Im up  
Sometimes Im down  
A topsyturvy life  
But only searching  
For the truth  
And Ill find it  
If it takes all night long  
Well I myself  
May main concern  
Is what I can afford  
So if music be my mistress  
  
Then at least shes Madame Claude daccord  
Ah more champagne  
To lose this pain  
Would be very nice  
So Ill help myself to one more drink  
And Ill find myself  
If it takes all night long
