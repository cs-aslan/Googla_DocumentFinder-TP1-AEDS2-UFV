The killers lie and wait for innocent blood  
Swallow a lives of harmless souls  
Walking a crooked path their wicked names will rot  
Evil lives in the dark its right is doing wrong  
The torment never endsit never ends  
  
The fire that burns inside  
Thats blistering their brains  
That makes them sacrifice  
Thats driving them insane  
Trapped in this no mans land  
Where angels dare to tread  
Forever banned to the realms of the never dead  
  
There is no one you can trust from this grave  
Die with those things with flu to sin   
Feeding all the wars  
Theyll feed up in the end  
Evil lives in the dark its right is doing wrong  
The torment never ends it never ends  
  
The fire that burns inside  
Thats blistering their brains  
Thats makes them sacrifice  
Thats driving them insane  
Trapped in this no mans land  
Where angels dare to tread  
Forever banned to the realms of the never dead  
  
Dead swifts before you to press on the suicide  
Life spills out of your body you wither and die  
  
For the rest of your life  
In the realms of the never dead  
  
The fire that burns inside  
Thats blistering their brains  
Thats makes them sacrifice  
Thats driving them insane  
Trapped in this no mans land  
Where angels dare to tread  
Forever banned to the realms of the never dead
