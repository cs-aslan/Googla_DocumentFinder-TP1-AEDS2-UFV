When I wake up in the morning put my feet on the floor  
I thank Him for the day that He gave me one more  
I give Him all the praise the one that I adore  
Thats Jesus oh thats Jesus  
I was lost and all alone my heart in need of help  
I found eternal life and lost my fear of death  
Because I know the author of my every breath  
Thats Jesus oh thats Jesus  
God of glory majesty  
The Holy One who died for me  
Whos the one I long to see  
Thats Jesus oh thats Jesus  
If youre a soul thats lost and in need of direction  
You wonder when you die if you go to Heaven  
Well friend Ive found the answer to that very question  
Thats Jesus oh thats Jesus  
God of glory majesty  
The Holy One who died for me  
Whos the one I long to see  
Thats Jesus oh thats Jesus  
Thats Jesus thats Jesus
