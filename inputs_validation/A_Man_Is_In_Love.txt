A man is in love how do I know  
He came and walked with me and he told me so  
In a song he sang and then I knew  
A man is in love with you  
  
A man is in love how did I hear  
I heard him talk too much whenever youre near  
He whispered your name when his eyes were closed  
A man is in love and he knows  
  
A man is in love how did I guess  
I figuered it out while he was watching you dress  
Hed give you his all if youd but agree  
A man is in love and hes me
