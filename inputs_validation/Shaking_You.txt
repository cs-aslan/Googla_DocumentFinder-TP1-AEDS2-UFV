Why do I have to care for you  
When I should have known to stay away  
Why was I there for you  
I dont know how I lost my touch  
I never believed that I could ever want  
Somebodys love so much  
Time can shake me loose from the blues  
But who would know Id be this slow shaking you  
I dont know what Im looking for  
I just let the arrows go and hope I find what I am shooting for  
So dont say that youll be there for me  
If you dont care for me Ill be gone  
Cause I dont have the strength to be this strong  
Tell me all what to do  
Who knew that Id take so long shaking you  
Now Im waiting to hit the ground  
Im painting my love for you in corners I know I will get around  
Time can shake me loose from the blues  
But who would know Id be this slow shaking you  
I dont know what Im looking for  
I just let the arrows go and hope I find what I am shooting for
