Little darlin of my life  
You keep movin cross my mind  
You gave me a sunny day  
Now it looks as if Ill pay  
  
Chorus  
Why do they say bluebird is dead  
I can still see her touch her my bluebird  
The love that she gave I dont believe no no I dont believe  
  
Bluebird came to me tonight  
Waiting patiently for light  
She said I know that you will grieve  
But my darlin I must leave  
  
Chorus  
  
Bluebird say it is not so  
Please I cannot hear you speak  
It must be that youre so tired  
In the darkness of the night  
  
Chorus
