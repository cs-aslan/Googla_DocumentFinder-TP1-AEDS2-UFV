My friend and I was partyin at the edge of town  
I saw a pretty little girl that looked up and down  
I said girl howd ya do Id like to know  
Oh howd ya do oh howd ya do  
Well my friend he told me I didnt have a chance  
But I knew this chick was aready to romance  
I said well howd ya do come dance with me  
Oh howd ya do come dance with me  
  
Well we got acquainted and we went outside  
We got in my car and we went for a ride  
I said well howd ya do with a big embrace  
A big embrace she slapped my face  
  
Well my friend was waitin at the dance for me  
I turned my face so he couldnt see  
He said well howd ya do youre back alone  
Oh howd ya do I took her home  
And you were right we had a fight  
Thats all right I did whats right  
Thats all tonight
