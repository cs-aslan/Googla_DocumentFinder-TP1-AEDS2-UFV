Cheatin woman make you crazy  
Cheatin woman make you a fool  
Shell leave your heart so lonely  
Brother theres nothin you can do  
  
Well I cant stand the pain no more  
She dont want my love for sure  
She dont even want poor me  
Knockin on her front door  
  
Why did you make me love you sister  
When you knew you was untrue  
You loved every man with pants on  
Yes a dozen to you is too few  
Im gonna shoot you and end your world  
Then you wont bother poor me  
You wont bother poor me no longer  
  
Cheatin woman  gonna shoot ya  
Oh woman why you do me  
Oh Lord the way you do  
I done everything I can baby  
Seems like nothin reaches you  
  
Im gonna get that pistol gal  
Im gonna shoot you and all your pals  
You aint gonna bother poor me  
You wont bother poor me no longer
