Just for a thrill  
You changed the sunshine to rain  
Just for a thrill  
You filled my heart with pain  
  
To me you were my pride and joy  
But to you I was merely a toy  
A plaything that you could toss around at will  
  
Just for a thrill  
You made my life one sad song  
Just for a thrill  
You just led me along  
  
Although youre free and havin your fun  
To me youre still the only one  
Cause you made my heart stand still  
Just for a thrill  
  
  
  
Although youre free and havin your fun  
To me youre still the only one  
Cause you made my heart stand still  
Well it was just for a thrill  
  
And baby you you made my heart stand still  
Just for a thrill
