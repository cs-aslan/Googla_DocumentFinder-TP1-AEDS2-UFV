Ive got a man his name is Peete  
Hes awfully good and oh so sweet  
Hes not the kind that you usually meet  
He loves me soo and I love Pete  
A gal that I know loves a boy named Jiim  
Though he treats her mean she still loves him  
And Sally loves Joe whos the kind thatll cheat  
Some men are like that but not my Pete  
He never beats me  
Never mistreats me  
He never teases  
He only pleases  
I take my troubles with a grain of salt  
Cause Ive got a man without a fault  
I put him on trial he passed every teest  
Whatever he does he does his best  
Ive got no complaints and my life is complete  
Cause Ive got a man whose name is Pete  
He never beats me  
Never mistreats me  
He never teases  
He only pleases  
I take my troubles with a grain of salt  
Cause Ive got a man without a fault  
I put him on trial he passed every teest  
Whatever he does he does his best  
Ive got no complaints and my life is complete  
Cause Ive got a maan what a maan  
His name is Pete
