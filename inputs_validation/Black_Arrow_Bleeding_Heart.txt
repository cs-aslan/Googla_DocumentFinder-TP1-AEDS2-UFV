Throwing rocks at a window  
Stumble into a telephone pole  
While the light shines down on your person  
Filtering through all your aversions  
  
Love will not find you tonight  
When youre preaching love thinking love  
Holding back  
What were you thinking  
When black arrows  
Shot at your bleeding heart  
  
Looking into the mirror  
Dont like what I see  
Aint looking like me  
I want to be near her  
Theres no way in hell  
And theres no time to tell  
  
Love will not find you tonight  
When youre preaching love thinking love  
Holding back  
What were you thinking  
When black arrows  
Shot at your bleeding heart
