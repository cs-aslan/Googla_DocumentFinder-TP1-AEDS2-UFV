I should have told him that I needed him  
When I had the chance  
And now hes left me and its all over  
Goodbye romance  
  
I should have told him then  
Over and over again that I love him  
  
But it was easier to hurt him ooh  
It was easier to hurt him ooh  
It was easier to hurt him  
Thats what I thought was being so smart  
  
The way I cheated him and mistreated him  
How could I forget  
I was so sure that he would always trust in me  
Oh that Id take a bet no no no  
  
Hed never say goodbye but here all alone am I  
He is gone now  
  
Cause it was easier to hurt him what could I do  
It was easier to hurt him I should have known better  
It was easier to hurt him  
Thats what I thought was being so smart oh oh  
  
It was easier to hurt him I need him so bad  
It was easier to hurt him what did I do  
It was easier to hurt him I should have known better  
It was easier to hurt him I need him so bad
