Hey you dont wanna love you on the telephone  
Youre hanging up and I am all alone  
Baby you got me doing dirt doing dirt doing dirt  
And now I wanna find you but youre off the run  
My hearts exploding like a burning sun  
And I know you like it when it hurts when it hurts when it hurts

Youre shining like a neon light  
I light you up when I get inside  
So wont you touch me cause everybodys watching us now  
Were putting on a show for the crowd  
So turn it up baby make it loud  
  
Hey you say that youre only having fun and then  
You call me up at three AM again

And now all that I got is just a microphone  
To let you know that I am all alone  
I know you like it when it hurts when it hurts when it hurts  
  
Hold me were dancing in the dark of the night  
Youre shining like a neon light  
I light you up when I get inside  
So wont you touch me cause everybodys watching us now  
Were putting on a show for the crowd
