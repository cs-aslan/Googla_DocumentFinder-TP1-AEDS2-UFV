Im the three day man  
Its three days too long  
Everything is in its right place but  
Something is wrong  
Time is on wheels  
And my legs shake  
I have to live with every decision  
That you make  
  
And that doesnt mean  
That Ill be your slave  
It doesnt mean youre here to stay  
It doesnt mean were friends for life  
You know I want you  
You know that I love you  
But Ill never need you anyway  
Ill never need you anyway  
  
Sixes and sevens  
Oh how it rains  
Sleep is a station  
Life is a train  
People snatch instinctively for  
Whatever crutch they need  
But I promise not to abuse you  
If you dont love me leave  
  
And that means  
That Ill be never your slave  
It means that youre not here to stay  
Means that were not friends for life  
You know how I want you  
You know that I love you  
But Ill never need you anyway  
Ill never need you anyway  
Never need you anyway  
  
And that means  
That Ill be never your slave  
It means youre not here to stay  
Means were not friends for life  
You know how I want you  
You know that I love you  
  
But Ill never need you anyway  
Ill never need you anyway  
Ill never need you anyway  
Never need you anyway  
Ill never need you anyway  
Ill never need you
