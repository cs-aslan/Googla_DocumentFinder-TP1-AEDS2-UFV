Look on down from the bridge  
Theres still fountains down there  
Look on down from the bridge  
Its still raining up here  
  
Everybody seems so far away from me  
Everybody just wants to be free  
Look away from the sky  
Its no different when youre leaving home  
I cant be the same thing to you now  
Im just gone just gone  
How could I say goodbye  
How could I say goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
Maybe Ill just place my hands over you  
And close my eyes real tight  
Theres a light in your eyes  
And you knowyeah you know  
Look on down from the bridge  
Im still waiting for you
