Is like Im in love with a stranger  
Its nothing familiar about your touch  
And I need a way to make sense of this person I met  
As a flame that burns through my heart  
Oh I oh I I never felt such heat in my life  
The passion in

When I move the floor is on fire  
When you stare Im aware of your desire  
When you scream your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire  
When I move the floor is on fire  
When you stare Im aware of your desire  
When you scream your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire

Our heart cause thats what you do to me  
Lets talk more plain lets move embrace  
Let your heart get away oh yeah

Let your heart get away oh yeah  
Let your heart just shine and guide away

When you scream your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire
