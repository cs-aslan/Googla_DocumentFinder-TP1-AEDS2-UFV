Aint it hard to stumble  
And land in some funny lagoon  
Aint it hard to stumble  
And land in some muddy lagoon  
Especially when its nine below zero  
And three oclock in the afternoon  
  
Aint gonna hang no picture  
Aint gonna hang no picture frame  
Aint gonna hang no picture  
Aint gonna hang no picture frame  
Well I might look like Robert Ford  
But I feel just like a Jesse James  
  
Well I wish I was on some  
Australian mountain range  
Oh I wish I was on some  
Australian mountain range  
I got no reason to be there but I  
Imagine it would be some kind of change  
  
I got my dark sunglasses  
I got for good luck my black tooth  
I got my dark sunglasses  
Im carryin for good luck my black tooth  
Dont ask me nothin about nothin  
I just might tell you the truth  
  
I got a woman in Jackson  
I aint gonna say her name  
I got a woman in Jackson  
I aint gonna say her name  
Shes a brownskin woman  
But I  
Love her just the same
