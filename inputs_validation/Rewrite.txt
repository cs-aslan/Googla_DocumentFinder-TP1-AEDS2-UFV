You dont know me  
You cant hold me  
Ill slip through your hands  
I am one single grain of sand  
  
Chorus  
You are free to love  
Happily received  
You are free to love  
If that is all you need  
  
Im an empty space  
I cant be replaced  
So when youre finished with this dream  
Delete begin to rewrite me  
  
Chorus x2  
  
You are free to love  
Happily received  
You are free to love  
Delete and rewrite me
