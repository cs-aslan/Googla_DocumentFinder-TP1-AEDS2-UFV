My life  Im a fool for you  
You who take no advice  
You who think evil doesnt exist  
Just because you deny it is true  
  
Chorus x2  
Youre lucky I care  
For fools like you  
Youre lucky Im there  
To stop people doing the things  
That you know theyre dying to do  
  
You know I am no stranger  
I know rules are a bore  
But just to keep you from danger  
I am the law  
  
You know I am no stranger  
I know rules are a bore  
But just to keep you from danger  
I am the law  
  
A dog must bark  
So evil calls  
Both in the wild and  
Within these walls  
  
Chorus  
  
You know I am no stranger  
I know rules are a bore  
But just to keep you from danger  
I am the law  
  
You know I am no stranger  
I know rules are a bore  
But just to keep you from danger  
I am the law  
  
You know I am no stranger  
I know rules are a bore  
But just to keep you from danger  
I am the law  
  
You know I am no stranger  
I know rules are a bore  
But just to keep you from danger  
I am the law
