Look at monica walking in her sleep  
Look at monica running through the fields  
In her dream so serene  
Monica monica  
  
Hush dont you say a word  
Did you see the smile she made today  
  
Look at monica  
Look at monica  
  
Mornings coming ever so fast  
Shadows realitys cast  
More like a dream that just wont last  
  
Look at monica walking in her sleep  
Look at monica running through the fields  
In her dream so serene  
Monica monica  
  
Please keep quiet let her sleep  
Cant you see the smile she made today
