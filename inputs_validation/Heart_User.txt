She wears her hair real wild  
Her nails are perfectly filed  
Her lips painted deep jungle red  
Her best color is black  
And the clothes on her back  
Show shes a woman with style  
She wears satin and lace with impeccable taste  
Shell tell you it runs in her blood  
In a cloud of perfume she walks into the room  
And it comes to a stop when she does  
Shes a heart user  
No time for losers  
Shell use you up and throw your love away  
Heart user  
A barracuda  
Shell use you just dont get in her way  
Oozing with charm got a girl on each arm  
His eyes match his all over tan  
And as he straightens his tie  
Some beauty catches his eye  
Brings out the best in the man  
And her fresh young face makes his cold heart race  
Shes wearing that deadly perfume  
You must admire the skill as he comes in for the kill  
Its time to attack make his move  
Hes a heart user  
No time for losers  
Hell use you up and throw your love away  
Heart user  
A barracuda  
Hell use you just dont get in his way  
Where you been all my life  
This is love at first sight  
Could swear weve met someone before  
She throws back her head  
And she shamelessly says  
You got real good taste tell me more  
Then the lady in black thinks shes setting her trap  
And he thinks shes playing his game  
But anybody can tell theyre just into themselves  
Theyre two of a kind theyre the same  
Theyre just heart users  
No time for losers  
Theyll use you up and throw your love away  
Heart users  
Theyre barracuda  
Theyll use you just dont get in their way
