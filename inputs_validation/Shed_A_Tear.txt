Youve been talking in your sleep again  
About the way youve been pulling my heart strings  
When I think Im on my feet again  
I fall down  
Oh I fall down  
  
At forty seven Park Avenue  
Loud is the singing down in the bar room  
So lonely  
I wish I was in paradise  
  
The broken lover in me girl  
Has been fixed in my memory  
Lay your love lay your love on me  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say yeah  
Im gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love love I gave away  
I gave away  
  
Youve been making those eyes again  
Down in the city and up in your ivory tower  
One day soon youre gonna reach out and call my name  
  
Yeah the broken lover in me girl  
Has been fixed in my memory  
Lay your love lay your love on me  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say yeah  
Im gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love I gave away  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say yeah  
Im gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love love I gave away  
Oh I gave away  
Oh I gave away  
  
Loves got me down on my knees again  
Theres no easy no easy way out  
Theres no easy way out  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say yeah  
Im gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love I gave away  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say oh baby  
Im gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love I gave away  
I gave away  
I gave away  
I gave away
