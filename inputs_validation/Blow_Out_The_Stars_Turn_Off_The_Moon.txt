Here on the hilltop where we fell in love  
Many moons later now were giving up  
I start the engine you start to cry  
Its a beautiful memory but a sad sad goodbye  
  
How many times have we wished on a star  
Wrapped up in a quilt on the hood of my car  
We saw Halleys comet in lunar eclipse  
And I sure saw heaven when I tasted your lips  
  
So blow out the stars turn off the moon  
Fade out the crickets and the nightingales tune  
Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind  
Another love story has come to an end  
  
When our love was new as the first evening star  
We both said Ill worship you just as you are  
Then I tried to change you girl and I dont know why  
You tried to change me hey we might as well try  
  
To blow out the stars turn off the moon  
Fade out the crickets and the nightingales tune  
Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind  
Another love story has come to an end  
  
Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind  
Another love story has come to an end
