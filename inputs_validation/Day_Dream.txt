Daydream why do you haunt me so  
Deep in a rosy glow  
The face of my love you show  
  
Daydream I walk along on air  
Building a castle there  
For me and my love to share  
  
Dont know the time lordy  
Im in a daze  
Sun in the sky while I moon around feeling hazy  
  
Daydream dont break my reverie  
Until I find that he  
Is daydreaming just like me  
  
Daydreams why do you haunt me so  
While Im in this rosy glow  
Bring back my love  
Bring back my love  
Bring back my love  
To me
