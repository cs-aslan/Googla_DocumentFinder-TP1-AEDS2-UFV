I guess we used to be the lucky ones  
Good fortune smiled on everyone  
Stop  
A voice said you best beware  
Stop  
Bad luck is everywhere  
And sure enough the voice was right  
My luck changed overnight  
Stop  
Please tell me what went wrong  
Stop  
I cant take these ups and downs  
  
Hard times come hard times go  
And in between you hope and pray  
The scars dont show  
Cause life is strange and so unsure  
The days you hardly make it through  
You swear that theres a curse on you  
Cause nothing seems to fit  
And things wont go your way  
You know youve had enough  
Youve got the right to say  
Why me why me  
  
Rubelator  
  
Stop  
Here comes anxiety  
Stop  
Wont you please let me be I need relief  
Hard times come hard times go  
In between you hope and pray  
The scars dont show  
Cause life is strange and so unsure  
The days you hardly make it through  
Youre sure that there is a curse on you  
If nothing seems to fit  
And things wont go your way  
You know youve had enough  
You cant take another day  
Where to go and what to do  
Youve got those bills to pay  
Youre really not alone you know  
Cause everybody says  
Why me  
  
Why me  
Why me Thats what I want to know You know what I mean Huh I dont know
