Lets take a better look  
Beyond a story book  
And learn our souls are all we own  
Before we turn to stone  
  
Lets go to sleep with clearer heads  
And hearts too big to fit out beds  
And maybe we wont feel so alone  
Before we turn to stone  
  
And if you wait for someone elses hand  
You will surely fall down  
If you wait for someone elses hand  
Youll fall youll fall  
  
I know that I am nothing new  
Theres so much more than me and you  
But brother how we must atone  
Before we turn to stone
