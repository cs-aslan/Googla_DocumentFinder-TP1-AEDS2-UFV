Verse 1  
Here I am again doing things I said that I wouldnt do  
Its 3 am and Im rushing out the door to see you  
Waiting all day but now you want to call me  
Why do you do this to me all the time  
  
Chorus  
After all the things you put me through still I come right back  
But now I know the truth I can finally see  
You only want me when youre lonely  
If I say Im going to leave thats the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I wont make it  
Another late night call I wont take it  
Cos now I finally see you only want me when youre lonely  
Only when youre lonely lonely  
Only when youre lonely  
Only when youre lonely lonely  
Only when youre lonely  
  
Verse 2  
Had me fooled from the start and I quickly gave my heart  
Because I loved you loved you  
But this is what happens when youre a lonely girl  
With no one to turn you  
Now Im stronger dont need you any longer  
So get off your knees your words dont mean anything  
  
After all the things you put me through still I come right back  
But now I know the truth I can finally see  
You only want me when youre lonely  
If I say Im going to leave thats the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I wont make it  
Another late night call I wont take it  
Because now I finally see you only want me when youre lonely  
  
Nothings ever changing decisions you cant make it  
You just think of yourself and never me at all  
If youre with your friends you just string me along  
But I wont allow it anymore so its time for me to move on  
  
Chorus  
Because I can finally see you only want me when youre lonely  
If I say Im going to leave thats the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I wont make it  
Another late night call I wont take it  
Cos now I finally see you only want me when youre lonely  
Only when youre lonely lonely  
Only when youre lonely  
Only when youre lonely lonely  
Only when youre lonely  
  
Verse 3  
I can finally see you only want me when youre lonely  
If I say Im going to leave thats the only time you want me  
Next time you need me there I wont make it  
Another late night call I wont take it  
Because now I finally see you only want me when youre lonely
