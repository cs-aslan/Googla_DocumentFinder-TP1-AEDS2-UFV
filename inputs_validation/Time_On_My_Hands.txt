Chorus  
Long long year Ive sat in this place  
Baby baby whats good Ive had  
When you dont know where I want to go  
Find a reason loves left me cold  
Ive got it time on my hands  
Been drinkin with the sailor boy  
Been tryin hard to understand  
Lines here in my hand  
Left me hopin the wild thoughts I had  
My lost feelin made me so sad  
Tried so hard the smile on my face  
Cant get it back a gain back home with you  
Chorus
