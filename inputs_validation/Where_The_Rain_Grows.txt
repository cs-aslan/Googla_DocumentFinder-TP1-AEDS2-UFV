I never look higher  
Than I could see  
Never gave less  
Than you have given me  
The more you have taken  
you turned into fakes  
I finally know now why for Heavens sake  
  
Dont tell me you did not see that I cried  
Dont act so deaf and blind  
Dont think that if someones made dumb to the core  
He would stay like before  
  
So I take my life  
Back from where the rain grows  
Die to survive  
Back from where the rain grows  
  
Now you call me liar  
Cause you are just the  
Always have right fools majority  
I think that its someones  
start at your side  
youd all turn your back  
Wont give any dime  
  
Dont tell me you did not see that I cried  
Dont act so deaf and blind  
Dont think that if someones made sad to the core  
He would stay like before  
  
So I take my life  
Back from where the rain grows  
Die to survive  
Back from where the rain grows  
  
From where the rain grows  
I know where the rain grows  
Im back from where the rain grows
