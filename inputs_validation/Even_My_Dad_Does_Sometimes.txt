Its alright to cry even my dad does sometimes  
So dont wipe your eyes  
Tears remind you youre alive  
Its alright to die cause death the only thing you havent tried  
But just for tonight hold on  
So live life like youre giving all  
Cause you act like you are  
Go ahead and just live it up  
Go on and tell me your path  
  
Its alright to shake  
Even my hand does sometimes  
So inside the rage Against the dying of the light  
Its alright to say that deaths  
The only thing you havent tried  
But just for today hold on  
So live life like youre giving all  
Cause you act like you are  
Go ahead and just live it up  
Go on and tell me your path  
  
Go ahead and just live it up  
Go on and tell me your path and hold on
