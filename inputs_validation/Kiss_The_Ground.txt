He said everything is wrong  
I said nothing bad can last for long  
This time Ill bring you to your kneesoh its just like hope  
It bites the dust but I believe  
Im in the photograph  
That hangs up on a shelf  
And when the lights are low  
I feel just like monroe  
And I shine like an angel  
For the devil in him  
And the chains that surround him  
Will disappear  
But the light shines on me  
But the light shines on me  
I kiss the ground I stand on  
I move around in circles  
You make me glad to be here  
I dont wanna go  
I kiss the ground I stand on  
I move around in circles  
Dont let the light shine on me  
There was a game we played  
To pass the time away  
And when the lights were low  
Id undress like bardot  
For the love of a stranger  
With a dangerous side  
And the more that I gave him  
The more hed desire  
So I got up to leave  
And he said after me  
I know where youre going  
I know  
Well  
So I got up to leave  
And he said after me  
I know where youre going  
I know  
Well  
I kiss the ground I stand on  
I move around in circles  
You make me glad to be here  
I dont wanna go  
I kiss the ground I stand on  
I move around in circles  
Dont let the light shine on me  
Shine on me  
Dont let the light  
No  
Shine on me
