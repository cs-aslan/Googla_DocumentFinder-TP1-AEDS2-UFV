Candy says Ive come to hate my body  
And all that it requires in this world  
Candy says Id like to know completely  
What others so discretely talk about  
  
Im gonna watch the blue birds fly over my shoulder  
Im gonna watch them pass me by  
Maybe when Im older  
What do you think Id see  
If I could walk away from me  
  
Candy says I hate the quiet places  
That cause the smallest taste of what will be  
Candy says I hate the big decisions  
That cause endless revisions in my mind  
  
Im gonna watch the blue birds fly over my shoulder  
Im gonna watch them pass me by  
Maybe when Im older  
What do you think Id see  
If I could walk away from me
