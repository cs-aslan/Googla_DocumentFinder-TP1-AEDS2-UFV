Do nothing till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to whats said  
Why one should tear the seam of anyones dream  
Is over my head  
  
Do nothing till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the word of others youve heard  
I havent a chance  
  
True Ive been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that Im untrue  
While were apart the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But please do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will
