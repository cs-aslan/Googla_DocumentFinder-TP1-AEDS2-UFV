There are burdens that I carry everyday  
Sometimes they make me want to cry  
Hopeless feelings harbored deep inside my heart  
And I find it hard to hold my head up high  
In the middle of the darkness in my life  
I find a strength to carry on  
I am holding to a promise Jesus made  
And I know it wont be long til well be gone  
In a while well be gone  
And we wont have to cry anymore  
All our sorrows left behind  
And thats the day that I am waiting for  
And thats the day that I am longing for  
If you feel there is no meaning in your life  
And it seems youve lost your way  
Listen closely to the voice thats deep inside  
And remember what the Savior has to say  
In a while well be gone  
And we wont have to cry anymore  
All our sorrows left behind  
And thats the day that I am waiting for  
And thats the day that I am longing for  
In a while well be gone  
And we wont have to cry anymore  
All our sorrows left behind  
And thats the day that I am waiting for  
And thats the day that I am longing for  
And thats the day that I am looking for
