Cry like you feel  
Try like you feel feel it  
Try to escape  
Cry to escape escape it  
Its so hard to run away  
Hes a virgin killer  
  
No no no cant you see  
No no no cant you see  
Youre a demons youre a demons  
Youre a demons desire  
  
Death on the screen  
Sadistic magazines watch out  
Suicides evryday  
Political ways get it  
Well you cant find new ways  
But hes a virgin killer  
  
No no no cant you see  
No no no cant you see  
Youre a demons youre a demons  
Youre a demons desire  
  
Garbage in the streams  
Abombs in your dreams look out  
Sharks in the pictures  
Exorcist prescriptions forget it  
Try to get away from that  
cause hes a virgin killer  
  
No no no cant you see  
No no no cant you see  
Youre a demons youre a demons  
Youre a demons desire
