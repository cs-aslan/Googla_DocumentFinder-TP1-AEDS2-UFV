When will realize youre already there  
So watered down your feelings have turned to mud  
Love everybody is destroying the value of  
All hate has got me nowhere  
  
I know Im slipping I know Im slipping I know Im slipping away  
Oh no it is everything they said it was  
Oh no I am everything they said I was  
When you you get to heaven you will wish you youre in hell  
  
When will you realize youre already here  
Youll think us now that you have crossed over  
Dont pick the scabs or you will never heal  
The world shudders as the worm gets its wings  
  
Then I got my wings and I never even knew it  
When I was a worm thought I wouldnt get through it
