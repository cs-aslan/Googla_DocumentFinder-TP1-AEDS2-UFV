Getting sober for a day got me feeling too low  
They tryna make me slow down tryna tell me how to live  
Im about to lose control lose control  
Well they can watch me fuck it up all in one night

Leather booted kissing bitches in the club  
They wanna threesome threesome  
Then some then some  
Spend whatever come in fuck an income  
Me and my niggas we aint never going broke  
And you have to  
Do it all just to know where it gets you  
Living dreams we can never afford  
Now we sitting in the back saying
