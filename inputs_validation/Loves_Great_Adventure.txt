Standing on my own  
It didnt mean that much to me  
I thought I had it all  
I didnt see the mystery  
I stood the test of time  
I took the step to find  
Loves great adventure  
  
I spoke a million words  
They didnt mean that much to me  
They rang around my head  
Like empty tuneless harmonies  
Loves great adventure mine  
  
Lying side by side  
It didnt mean that much to me  
I started to enjoy  
The poetry and symphonies  
I took it in my stride  
I hailed the Day i tried  
Loves great adventure  
  
A fool who couldnt see  
It didnt mean that much to me  
I couldnt understand  
Thats how the game is meant to be  
Loves great adventure mine  
  
Standing on my own  
It didnt mean that much to me  
I thought I had it all  
I didnt see the mystery  
I stood the test of time  
I took the step to find  
Loves great adventure
