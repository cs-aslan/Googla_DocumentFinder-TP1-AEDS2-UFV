Well shes very wealthy its true  
So in that she is one up on you  
Shes dressed all in red white and blue  
And she always knows more than you do  
Shes so affected  
Cool calm collected  
She knows who to smile to today  
She has just been brought up in that way  
She knows all the right games to play  
And she always just knows what to say  
Shes well respected  
Cool calm collected  
Hello  
Shes so affected  
Cool calm collected  
In public the strains hard to bear  
She exudes such a confident air  
But behind she is not without care  
But she sweeps it right under her hair  
Shes well respected  
Cool calm collected  
She seems to glow brilliantly white  
And her hair seems to shine in the night  
With her feet unbelievably light  
And her teeth ready sharpened to bite  
Shes so respected  
Cool calm collected
