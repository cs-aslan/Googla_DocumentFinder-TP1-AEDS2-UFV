Girl Im in love with you  
This aint the honeymoon  
Passed the infatuation phase  
Right in the thick of love  
At times we get sick of love  
Seems like we argue everyday  
  
I know I misbehaved and you made your mistakes  
And we both still got room left to grow  
And though love sometimes hurts  
I still put you first  
And well make this thing work but I think maybe we should take it slow  
  
Were just ordinary people  
We dont know which way to go  
Cause were ordinary people  
Maybe we should take it slow  
Take it slow ohh  
This time well take it slow  
Take it slow ohh  
This time well take it slow  
  
This aint a movie love  
No fairytale conclusion yall  
It gets more confusing everyday  
Sometimes its heaven sent  
Then we head back to hell again  
We kiss then we make up on the way  
  
I hang up you call  
We rise and we fall  
And we feel like just walking away  
As our love advances we take second chances  
Though its not a fantasy I still want you to stay  
  
Were just ordinary people  
We dont know which way to go  
Cause were ordinary people  
Maybe we should take it slow  
Take it slow ohh  
This time well take it slow  
Take it slow ohh  
This time well take it slow  
  
Take it slow  
Maybe well live and learn  
Maybe well crash and burn  
Maybe youll stay maybe youll leave  
maybe youll return  
Maybe another fight  
Maybe we wont survive  
But maybe well grow  
We never know Maybe you and I  
  
Were just ordinary people  
We dont know which way to go  
Cause were ordinary people  
Maybe we should take it slow  
  
Were just ordinary people  
We dont know which way to go  
Cause were ordinary people  
Maybe we should take it slow  
  
Take it slow ohh  
This time well take it slow  
Take it slow ohh  
This time well take it slow  
Take it slow slow  
This time well take it slow  
Take it slow ohh  
This time well take it slow
