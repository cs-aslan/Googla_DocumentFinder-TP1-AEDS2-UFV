Sitting here in this dirty bar  
Watching the trash go by  
Shes selling cigarettes and lollipops  
Shes got a sparkle in her black eye  
  
She says Maybe my time will come  
Maybe my time will come  
  
He said hed sweep her off her feet  
Defying all of gravity  
Well shed move any bright city  
To fill this gaping cavity she says  
  
Im a slave in this empty life  
Diggin my grave Im his newspaper wife  
  
Well he must have a very small broom  
As she sits in this very large room  
Maybe its just a piece of straw  
She says why am I so in awe  
  
Chorus  
Im a slave to this empty life  
Diggin my grave Im his newspaper wife  
Im ashamed of this meaningless life  
Diggin my grave Im his newspaper wife  
  
She sits across from him  
Drinking her coffee  
His face is buried in other peoples lives she says  
I wonder if hes gonna read forever  
Im his newspaper wife  
  
Chorus
