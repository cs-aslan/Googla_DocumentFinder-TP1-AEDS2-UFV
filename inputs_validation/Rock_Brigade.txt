Well in the middle of the night  
And the early morning light  
You can hear them a million miles away  
Theyll be bangin on their drums  
Bangin on your door  
Waving their flags telling you to score  
  
Watch out for the rock brigade  
Rock brigade  
Oh no its the rock brigade  
Rock brigade  
Look out for the rock brigade  
Leading you away away  
  
So when they hit your town  
Youd better get down  
Im telling no lies to you mister  
Cause they live for rock n roll  
Theyll try to steal your soul  
Might even try to steal your sister oh  
  
So in the middle of the night  
Or the early morning light  
If you hear them comin your way  
Well youd better watch your step  
Dont step out of line  
Cause here they come one more time  
Watch out for the rock brigade  
Rock brigade  
Oh no its the rock brigade  
Rock brigade  
Look out for the rock brigade  
Rock brigade  
You better watch out for the rock brigade  
Rock brigade  
I say watch out for the rock brigade  
Rock brigade  
Keep your eyes on the rock brigade  
Rock brigade  
Dont let your eyes off the rock brigade  
Rock brigade  
Theyll be leading you away away away
