Its a sad affair  
When theres no one there  
He calls out in the night  
And its so unfair  
At least it seems that way  
When you gave him his life  
  
And all this time hes been getting you down  
You ought to pick him up when theres no one around  
And convince him  
Just talk to him  
cause he knows in his heart you wont be home soon  
Hes an only child in an only room  
And hes dependent on you  
  
And it seems so strange  
That at the end of the day  
Making love can be so good  
But the Pain of birth  
What is it worth  
When it dont turn out the way it should
