Some say youre too easy  
Cause youve stayed by my side  
Im the one who keeps you happy  
And you keep me satisfied  
  
Just be my lady  
Thatll be enough for me  
And it wont matter baby  
What your friends think they see  
  
Who loves you better  
Better than I do I do  
Who knows you better  
Better than I do than I do  
  
Everyday that passes by  
Every night I spend with you  
Puzzled by the things you try  
Saddened by the things you do  
  
He can say sweet things to you  
And promise you security  
I find strength in loving you  
Dont fight my love give in to me  
  
Who loves you better  
Better than I do I do  
Who knows you better  
Better than I do than I do  
  
You know you cant live your life  
Doin what the others do  
Always takin their advice  
May not be the best for you  
  
So just be my lady  
And thatll be enough for me  
And it wont matter baby  
What your friends think they see  
  
Who loves you better  
Better than I do I do  
Who knows you better  
Better than I do than I do
