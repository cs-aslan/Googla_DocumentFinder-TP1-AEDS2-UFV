Im helpless without you baby  
Ive almost lost my man  
Yes helpless without you baby  
Ive almost lost my man  
Im blue and confused  
Since you left me behind  
My friends all know it baby  
The tears I cannot hide  
My friends all know it baby  
The tears I cannot hide  
Youve changed youre dispositioned  
And throw my love aside  
Be fair with me baby  
Our love can start anew  
Please be fair with me baby  
Our love can start anew  
Im blue and helpless baby  
And Im worried over you  
Yes Im worried  
Ive got the helpless blue
