Although the things youve done I wouldnt criticize  
I guess you had your way  
You see I gotta make you understand  
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say  
But it dont matter baby cos todays another day  
  
You shine a little love on my life  
You shine a little love on my life  
You shine a little love on my life and let me see  
  
Remembertonight were gonna run till dawn  
Remembertonight were gonna say  
Well never stop we got a good thing goin on  
I know youve heard it all before  
But I really need you darlin every day I need you more  
  
You shine a little love on my life  
You shine a little love on my life  
You shine a little love on my life and let me see  
  
Can you understandYes I understand Can you feel its right  
I know it is Will you be the sameIll do it all again  
  
Its been a year now and its getting so much better  
You came home without a word  
Though everybody said youll soon forget her  
Thay couldnt see and they just didnt understand  
And lookin in the mirror there were fools at either hand  
  
Can you understandYes I understand Can you feel its right  
I know it is Will you be the sameIll do it all again  
  
How many days had I been waiting there to tell you  
I really cant believe  
Were walkin out into the world tonight  
Well do it all again until the break of light  
And the feelin in your heart will soon be shinin in your eyes  
  
You shine a little love on my life  
You shine a little love on my life  
You shine a little love on my life and let me see
