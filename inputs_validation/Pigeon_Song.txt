Well I had me a pigeon  
By the name of Fred  
But I done shot him  
In the head  
  
Had me a railroad  
Down on the ridge  
But I done blowed up  
The bridge  
  
Had me a dog  
He was my best friend  
But to him  
I done put an end  
  
Had me a farm  
Sittin pretty on the hill  
But if you look  
Youll see it aint there still  
  
I dont know why I done it  
Honest it aint like me  
But I aint sad now I done it  
Cause a baby boy has got to be free
