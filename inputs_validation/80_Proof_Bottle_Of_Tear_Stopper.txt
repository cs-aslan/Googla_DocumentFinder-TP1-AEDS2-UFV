You aint never fell as far as when you fall in love  
Except the fall you take when youve been loved and given up  
When you have your heart and soul rubbed into the dirt  
An eightyproof bottle of tearstopper will take away the hurt  
  
Give me an eightyproof bottle of tearstopper  
And Ill start feeling I forgot her  
Get a little loose and lose her memory  
And I wont think Im close to dying  
Because it dries up all my crying  
An eightyproof bottle of tearstopper always sets me free  
  
It aint easy losing love although its turned out bad  
All at once youre turning off old feelings you once had  
But I found a helping hand right here in my hand  
And eightyproof bottle of tearstopper will help me take em out  
  
Give me an eightyproof bottle of tearstopper  
And Ill start feeling I forgot her  
Get a little loose and lose her memory  
And I wont think Im close to dying  
Because it dries up all my crying  
An eightyproof bottle of tearstopper always sets me free
