If I was a raindrop  
Youd be my thunderstorm  
Its cold so surround me  
With rain clouds to keep me warm  
I feel like Im falling  
  
So darling dont let me go  
The thought is appalling  
But should I slip away into the stormy sea  
Will you remember me  
  
Asleep in the warm cocoons  
We dream of lovely things  
Were both gonna wake up soon  
So we hope that tomorrow brings  
Us our Butterfly Wings  
  
If I was a grain of sand  
Would you be Miami Beach  
So dusty with starlight  
Close your eyes and cuddle close to me  
  
Ill try not to wake you  
Or make a sound while youre dozing off  
But in the night should the high tides  
Sweep me away from you  
Tell me again my dear will you be waiting here  
  
Whenever we leave the ground  
And take to the sky  
Ill smile as Im gazing down  
Cause Ive always wondered why  
We wont need feathers to fly
