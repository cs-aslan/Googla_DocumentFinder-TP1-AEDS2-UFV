Is that the wind  
On your face  
Are you sure youre alone  
Are you sure youre alone  
Feel the chill  
Of an empty space  
Are you sure youre alone  
Are you sure youre alone  
  
In the middle of the night  
Is that your heart you hear  
Or a train to nowhere  
That pounding in your ear  
  
Have you reached your breaking point  
Have you reached your breaking point tonight  
  
Only when youre sleeping can you drift away  
No one can hurt you  
Listen to the secret of your dreams  
Though you want to sleep forever  
Still you must return  
  
Hands of ice  
Down your spine  
Are you sure youre alone  
Are you sure youre alone  
  
Feel the grip  
Of a clinging vine  
Are you sure youre alone  
Are you sure youre alone  
  
In the middle of the night  
Is that your voice I hear  
Or the wind thats calling  
Back across the years  
  
Have you reached your breaking point  
Have you reached your breaking point tonight
