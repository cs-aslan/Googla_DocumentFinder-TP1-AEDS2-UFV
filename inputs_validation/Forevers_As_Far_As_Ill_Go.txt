Ill admit I could feel it  
The first time that we touched  
And the look in your eyes  
Said you felt as much  
  
But Im not a man  
Who falls too easily  
Its best that you know  
Where you stand with me  
  
Chorus  
I will give you my heart  
Faithful and true  
And all the love it can hold  
Thats all I can do  
cause Ive thought about  
How long Ill love you  
And its only fair that you know  
Forevers as far as Ill go  
  
When theres age around my eyes  
And gray in your hair  
And it only takes a touch  
To recall the love weve shared  
  
I wont take for granted  
Youll know my love is true  
cause each night in your arms  
Ill whisper to you  
  
Chorus

Forevers as far as Ill go
