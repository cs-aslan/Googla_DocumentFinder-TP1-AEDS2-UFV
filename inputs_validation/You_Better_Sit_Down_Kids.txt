You better sit down kids Ill tell you why kids  
You might not understand kids but give it a try kids  
Now how should I put this Ive got something to say  
Your mama is staying but Im goin away  
No were not mad kids and its hard to say why  
Your mother and I kids dont see eye to eye  
  
Say your prayers before you go to bed  
Make sure you get yourself to school on time  
I know youll do the things your mother asks  
Shes gonna need you most to stay in line  
Keep in mind your mamas gonna need  
Your help a whole lot more than she ever did before  
No more fightin over little things cause  
I wont be here to stop them anymore  
  
I know you dont want this but neither do we  
But sometimes things happen that we cant foresee  
So try to be calm kids and dont look so sad  
Just cause I am leavin Ill still be your dad  
But just remember I love you and though Im not here  
Just call if you need me Ill always be near  
  
Say your prayers before you go to bed  
Make sure you get yourself to school on time  
I know youll do the things your mother asks  
Shes gonna need you most to stay in line  
Keep in mind your mothers gonna need  
Your help a whole lot more than she ever did before  
No more fightin over little things cause  
I wont be here to stop them anymore  
  
Well I have to go now So kiss me goodbye  
My eyes are just red kids Im too big to cry
