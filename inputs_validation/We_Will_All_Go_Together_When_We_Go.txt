When you attend a funeral  
It is sad to think that sooner or  
Later those you love will do the same for you  
And you may have thought it tragic  
Not to mention other adjec  
Tives to think of all the weeping they will do  
But dont you worry  
No more ashes no more sackcloth  
And an armband made of black cloth  
Will some day never more adorn a sleeve  
For if the bomb that drops on you  
Gets your friends and neighbors too  
Therell be nobody left behind to grieve  
And we will all go together when we go  
What a comforting fact that is to know  
Universal bereavement  
An inspiring achievement  
Yes we all will go together when we go  
We will all go together when we go  
All suffuse with an incandescent glow  
No one will have the endurance  
To collect on his insurance  
Lloyds of london will be loaded when they go  
Oh we will all fry together when we fry  
Well be french fried potatoes by and by  
There will be no more misery  
When the world is our rotisserie  
Yes we will all fry together when we fry  
Down by the old maelstrom  
Therell be a storm before the calm  
And we will all bake together when we bake  
Therell be nobody present at the wake  
With complete participation  
In that grand incineration  
Nearly three billion hunks of welldone steak  
Oh we will all char together when we char  
And let there be no moaning of the bar  
Just sing out a te deum  
When you see that Icbm  
And the party will be come as you are  
Oh we will all burn together when we burn  
Therell be no need to stand and wait your turn  
When its time for the fallout  
And saint peter calls us all out  
Well just drop our agendas and adjourn  
You will all go directly to your respective valhallas  
Go directly do not pass go do not collect two hundred dollas  
And we will all go together when we go  
Evry hottenhot and evry eskimo  
When the air becomes uranious  
And we will all go simultaneous  
Yes we all will go together  
When we all go together  
Yes we all will go together when we go
