I dont wanna lose her  
I dont wanna lose her  
  
They told me that she had found somebody new  
But I dont believe it  
They said I would soon find out she was untrue  
But I just cant see it  
  
Maybe I am wrong to doubt it  
And now that I think about it  
If ever I lost her love  
Id be nothing nothing without it  
  
I dont wanna lose her lose that girl  
After all that weve been through  
I dont wanna lose her lose that girl of mine  
Lose that girl of mine  
  
I couldnt imagine life without her love  
I just couldnt take it  
If you wanted to know how well I would get on  
I dont think Id make it  
  
Maybe I just dont show her  
And now that I think its over  
I maybe should shout about it  
Cause Id be nothing nothing without it  
  
I dont wanna lose her lose that girl  
After all that weve been through  
I dont wanna lose her lose that girl of mine  
Lose that girl of mine  
  
Im gonna make a new start  
And bring her back to my heart  
Cause what I found out about her  
I just cannot live without her  
  
Maybe I just dont show her  
And now that I think its over  
I maybe should shout about it  
Cause Id be nothing nothing without it
