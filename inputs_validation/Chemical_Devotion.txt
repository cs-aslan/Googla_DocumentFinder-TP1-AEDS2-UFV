Its in the laxative theyre cutting in the cocaine baby  
Its in the heroin the ecstasy theyre mixing lately  
Give me the boys and girls in bathrooms getting plenty friendly  
  
With just the thought of us debauched and in the missionary  
  
Watch me out of my skull  
Watch me out of my mind  
Im out of control  
But Im still alive  
Go get me cigarettes  
Watch the circus pass by  
Twos up on an eighth  
All back to mine  
  
What a feeling  
Got steep my sweet dysfunction  
Ill keep on kneeling  
For my chemical devotion  
Let me kiss the ceiling  
Its just a notion for you  
More than a feeling  
That sweet devotion for you  
  
Its in the black sick and the choking on the blood and your  
Tears  
Its in the echo of the jackdaw ringing in your ears  
Watch me out of my gates  
Ill advised unprepared  
No one gave a shit  
When nobody cared  
Another wasted talent  
But thats just fine  
Twos up on an eighth  
All back to mine  
  
What a feeling  
Got steep my sweet dysfunction  
Ill keep on stealing  
For my chemical devotion  
Dont kiss the ceiling  
More than a potion for you  
More than a feeling  
That sweet devotion for you  
  
I cant take the fever from you  
I dont want to neither  
Theyre dropping science on you  
You just need a breather  
Ill be looking over you  
  
Overlooking me  
Its all in Gods time  
All back to mine  
  
What a feeling  
Got steep my sweet dysfunction  
So appealing  
This chemical devotion  
Got to kiss the ceiling  
More than an ocean for you  
More than a feeling  
That sweet devotion for you  
  
Shallow in the deep end  
Got steep my sweet dysfunction  
And I can depend  
On chemical devotion  
Its like my best friend  
That keeps the world in motion  
Ive got to defend  
My chemical devotion
