I went away for a whole lot of days  
And stripped the soul right outlaw me  
Lead away in a crimson haze  
The red was rain over me  
  
There aint no way outta here  
I try to scream I cant even speak  
Why am I the only one  
I cant get out and I cant go on  
There aint no way out of here  
Forever red and Im never free  
Climb the wall I cant hold on I cant go back and I cant go on  
  
There were faces in the dark and  
In me I could not see  
The mirror cracked in a million pieces  
And so did I cause Johnnys me  
  
Ill fade forever black away  
Ill give all my tomorrows for just one good today  
Im numb to feel dont know whats real  
The ghost is killing me
