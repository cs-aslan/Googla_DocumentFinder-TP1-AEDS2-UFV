Maybe I maybe you  
Can make a change to the world  
Were reaching out for a soul  
Thats kind of lost in the dark  
  
Maybe I maybe you  
Can find the key to the stars  
To catch the spirit of hope  
To save one hopeless heart  
  
You look up to the sky  
With all those questions in mind  
All you need is to hear  
The voice of your heart  
In a world full of pain  
Someones calling your name  
Why dont we make if true  
Maybe I maybe you  
  
Maybe I maybe you  
Are just dreaming sometimes  
But the world would be cold  
Without dreamers like you  
  
Maybe I maybe you  
Are just soldiers of love  
Born to carry the flame  
Bringin light to the dark  
  
You look up to the sky  
With all those questions in mind  
All you need is to hear  
The voice of your heart  
In a world full of pain  
Someones calling your name  
Why dont we make if true  
Maybe I maybe you
