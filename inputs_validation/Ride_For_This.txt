Fabolous  
Load the 44 up  
Im the reason the price of raw go up  
Jump outta of the lambo and the doors go up  
Hit you and your ho up  
From the torso up  
Leave yall there till the coroner or the law show up  
Im that nigga they say preforming so the whores show up  
Why cop I rob you ice your roll up  
I pop bottles aint no need for no cup  
Roll the pure dro up stroll the floor tore up  
The difference between fab and yall after I pick an auto up  
Every month I aint gotta give more doe up  
Fuckin with this youll buy a washer when the shore slow up  
I have it when ya kids seesaw go up  
I see four blow up  
Check these diamonds no flaws show up  
My niggas clap up parties shoot tour shows up  
What yall know bout head till a chicks jaw swoll up  
Goin gold minutes after the gates on stores go up  
You know who done it now few hundred miles  
And with shoes on it now  
Its like a few hundred thou  
When we run up this guns to stomach style  
Got to flaunt it now  
Nigga who want it blawgh  
  
Chorus Ja Rule  
Ride for this  
Where my niggas at get high to this  
Where yall at  
Die for this  
Throw guns up to the sky for this  
Where yall at  
Ride for this  
Where my niggas at get high to this  
Where yall at  
Die for this  
Throw guns up to the sky for this  
Where yall at  
  
Fabolous  
Yo you must wanna die  
From the nigga you testify against  
Fabolous make bail before they identify the prints  
Swing by a Vince in a buggy eye with tents  
Sitting on nineteens gun stash by the vents  
Niggas is looking at the chain cause they eyes squint  
I pull up pull out pull back  
Them guys will sprint  
Last nigga that talked slick and been replyin since  
Got a deal no sellin been supplyin since  
Leave niggas on the ground like tire prints  
We done make ya eyes look bent just by the sense  
These niggas dont believe then they gone die convinced  
Once I present the four fifth why comment  
Im the type you tell ya dame bout  
Push a fellow brain out  
Leaveem in front of the spot that they sell cocaine out  
One single had to tint the yellow range out  
Everybody runnin up tryin to spell the name out fabolous  
  
Chorus
