Well when I when I was  
Just a little baby boy  
Every night I would call  
Your number brought me joy  
I called your house every night since then  
But I aint never no no never  
Heard you calling me  
Come on and call me back again    
  
Call me back again  
  
Ive heard your name every night since then  
But I aint never no no never    
  
Well when I when I was  
Just a little baby boy  
Every night every night  
I would call because your number  
Brought me joy  
  
Oh  Ive called your name  
Every night since then  
But I aint never no no no no never  
Heard you calling me  
Come on and call me back again  
  
Call me back again
