Ive made up my mind  
Dont need to think it over  
If Im wrong I am right  
Dont need to look no further  
This aint lust  
I know this is love but  
  
If I tell the world  
Ill never say enough  
Cause it was not said to you  
And thats exactly what I need to do  
If Im in love with you  
  
Should I give up  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements  
Even if it leads nowhere  
Or would it be a waste  
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there  
Should I give up  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements  
Even if it leads nowhere  
  
Id build myself up  
  
And fly around in circles  
Wait then as my heart drops  
And my back begins to tingle  
Finally could this be it  
  
Should I give up  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements  
Even if it leads nowhere  
Or would it be a waste  
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there  
Should I give up  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements  
Even if it leads nowhere  
  
Should I give up  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements  
Even if it leads nowhere  
Or would it be a waste  
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there  
Should I give up  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements  
Even if it leads nowhere
