You didnt have to love me like you did  
But you didnt but you did  
And I thank you  
You didnt have to squeeze me like you did  
But you didnt but you did and I thank you  
  
If you took your love to someone else  
I know what I meant to be the loving dare  
You made me feel like Ive never felt  
Your kiss is so good I got the holler for help  
  
You didnt have to squeeze me like you did  
But you didnt but you did and I thank you  
You didnt have to hold me like you did  
But you didnt but you did and I thank you  
  
Now every day theres something new  
You put your makeup and your mild perfume  
You got me trying to do things too  
Just so that I can keep up with you  
  
You didnt have to shake me like you did  
But you didnt but you did and I thank you  
You didnt have to make me like you did  
But you didnt but you did and I thank you  
  
All my life Ive been short changed  
Without your love it would be a crying shame  
Now I know what love Im looking for  
When they say theyre being turned on  
  
I wanna thank you thank you thank you  
Thank you baby thank you thank you I got to say  
  
You didnt have to love me like you did  
But you didnt but you did and I thank you  
You didnt have to hold me like you did  
But you didnt but you did and I thank you  
I wanna thank you baby I wanna thank you let me count the ways  
Let me thank you baby baby Ive got something to say  
  
Thank you baby  
Let me count the ways for the whole wide world to hear oh yeah  
Now thank you for paying for my cold beer  
I wanna thank you for being here with me baby  
Thank you for understanding why I was out so late last night  
Thank you for giving me your best friends phone number  
Thank you for understanding that me and your sister are just good friends
