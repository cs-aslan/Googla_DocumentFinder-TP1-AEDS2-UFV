Making love with you is like swimming in glue  
And I dont think I can do it anymore  
Well It started 6 months back when you faked that heart attack  
But I brought you back and I put you at my bed  
Musta been playing sick cause you sure got better quick  
When you asked me for my love heres what I said  
Sure you can stay if you dont get in the way  
Whats a stupid boy like me to do  
Well Im sick and tired of making love with you  
Yeah Im sick and tired of making love with you  
Breaking up with you would be the smart thing to do but Im not smart its
half past two and your still here  
See I like the way you moan and I dont want to be alone  
So forgive me if I dont sound insincere  
Well its dont matter what I dont say cause I know your gonna stay  
Whats a stupid boy like me to do  
Well Im sick and tired of making love with you  
Yeah Im sick and tired of making love with you  
  
In the morning youll be gone  
You wont ever hear this song  
Its the best a stupid boy like me could do  
Well Im sick and tired of making love with you
