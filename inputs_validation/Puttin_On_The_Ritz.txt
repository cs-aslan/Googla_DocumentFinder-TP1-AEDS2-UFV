Irving Berlin  
Have you seen the welltodo  
Up and down Park Avenue  
On that famous thoroughfare  
With their noses in the air  
  
High hats and arrowed collars  
Wide spats and fifteen dollars  
Spending every dime  
For a wonderful time  
  
If youre blue and you dont know  
Where to go to why dont you go  
Where fashion sits  
Puttin on the Ritz  
  
Different types who wear a day coat  
Pants with stripes and cut away coat  
Perfect fits  
Puttin on the Ritz  
  
Dressed up like a million dollar trooper  
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper  
Superduper  
  
Come lets mix where Rockerfellers  
Walk with sticks or umberellas  
In their mitts  
Puttin on the Ritz  
  
Spangled gowns upon a beauty  
Of handmedowns on clown and cutie  
All misfits  
Puttin on the Ritz  
  
Strolling up the avenue so happy  
All dressed up just like an English chappie  
Very snappy  
  
Youll declare its simply topping  
To be there and hear them swapping  
Smart tidbits  
Puttin on the Ritz  
Puttin on the Ritz  
Puttin on the Ritz
