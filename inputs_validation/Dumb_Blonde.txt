Dont try to cry your way out of this  
Dont try to lie or Ill catch you in it  
Dont try to make me feel sorry for you  
Just because Im blond  
Dont think Im dumb  
Cause this dumb blond aint nobodys fool  
  
When you left you thought Id sit  
An you thought Id wait  
An you thought Id cry  
You called me a dumb blond  
Ah but somehow I lived through it  
And you know if theres one thing this blond has learned  
Blonds have more fun  
  
You flew too high up off the ground  
Its stormy weather an had to come back down  
But Ive found a new thread for my old spool  
Just because Im blond  
Dont think Im dumb  
Cause this dumb blond aint nobodys fool
