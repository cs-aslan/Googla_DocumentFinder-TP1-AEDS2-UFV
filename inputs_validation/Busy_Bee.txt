Everybodys alright with me  
Possibly youll disagree  
Busy Bee watch the world go by  
  
Everybodys alright with me  
Thats just the way I choose to be  
Everybodys on my mind  
Cant sit aside and watch this world go by  
That aint me  
  
Chorus x2  
Busy Bee watch the world go by  
  
Everybody does their time  
The people walk in crooked lines  
Everybodys got their choice  
But often we dont use our voice  
  
Chorus x4  
  
Busy Bee watch the world go by  
How could you be so blind  
Some people they just aint satisfied  
Watch the world go by  
  
I always hear the school bell ring  
Let the children dance and sing  
Just let us find whats been lost  
So many people get torn and tossed away  
  
Chorus x3  
  
World go bye  
World go bye  
World go bye  
Watch the world go bye  
Watch the world go bye  
Watch the world go bye  
  
Nice ending bit  
Everybodys alright with me
