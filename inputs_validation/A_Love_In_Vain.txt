Long night too long and lonely  
Laying there asking myself  
Hey whats going on with you and me  
How could I be so unaware  
So blind I could not see  
Knowing youd be there  
And always would be  
  
Is anyone to blame but me  
Ive been so concerned with myself  
Now I need you desperately  
If youve fallen for another  
Lets be honest with each other  
Is there still a chance  
And maybe hope to save our romance  
  
We cant be strangers  
You mean too much to me  
I wont let this be a love in vain  
Dont want the loneliness  
Of just a memory  
I dont want a love in vain  
  
Just one more night I want to spend with you  
Well let our hearts do the talking  
Like we used to do  
Well make our first kiss last forever  
Put the pieces back together  
Cause theres still a chance  
There may be hope to save our romance  
  
We cant be strangers  
You mean to much to me  
I wont let this be a love in vain dont want a love in vain  
I dont want the loneliness  
Of just a memory  
Dont want a love in vain  
  
Oh woman look what youve done to me  
Ill show you how this love should be  
Dont let it be a love in vain  
Please dont dont you know  
You got my heart on a string  
Dont let go  
Dont let this love be a love in vain  
  
We cant be strangers  
Its not our destiny  
I wont let this be a love in vain dont want a love in vain  
Dont want the loneliness  
Of just a memory  
Dont let this be a love in vain
