You never give yourself completely  
Its just that youve been hurt before  
Youre so afraid to let me love you  
You never leave an open door  
Dont judge me by some other lover  
Who broke your heart and walked away  
Come lets be fair with one another  
My world is yours i swear it  
Say the word and we can share it  
  
Chorus  
Dont hide your love  
dont hide your love  
Not if you care for me  
not if you care for me  
It isnt fair for me  
To worry and wonder and wait  
Dont hide your love  
dont hide your love  
Just love me here and now  
just love me here and now  
Well work it out somehow  
Dont you keep us apart  
Baby unlock your heart  
Dont hide your love  
  
Well i now the past has bought you sorrow  
The clouds still hang around today  
But dont let the rain fall on tomorrow  
Baby we can make it together  
cause im gonna love you forever  
  
Chorus
