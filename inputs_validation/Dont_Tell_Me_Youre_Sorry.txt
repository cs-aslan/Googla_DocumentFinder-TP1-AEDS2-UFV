Im sorry honey that you walked in and caught her in my lap  
But its not what youre thinking so think before you slap  
I suppose youre weighin that little blonde that walked here in this bar  
Ah dont tell me youre sory cause I know how sorry you are  
Im sorry that you think Im drunk I aint had a drink today  
Would you believe I held her just to see how much shed weight  
That cheatin look thats on your face is lit up like a star  
So dont tell me youre sorry cause I know how sorry you are  
Dont tell me youre sorry but Im as sorry as I can be  
Well youd better move fast and dont give me no sass cause you belong to me  
Now honey we aint done nothing wrong but Im sorry its gone this far  
But dont tell me youre sorry cause I know how sorry you are  
 guitar   
Dont tell me youre sorry  
Now wait a minute Loretta you know how sorry I am  
Conway you better believe I know how sorry you are
