I know just what youre thinking  
I know just how you feel  
Something sometimes inside you  
Say cant believe its real  
So youre gonna play the game  
All the faces and the names  
And you know youre never gonna change  
  
Fool for the night  
And you dont believe it  
Fool for the night  
And you just cant see it  
  
Running through the shadows  
Like a phantom in the night  
And as the curtain raises  
You get ready for the fight  
Say you want to even up the score  
Dont know what youre doing it for  
Too much but you still need more  
  
Fool for the night  
And you dont believe it  
Fool for the night  
And you just cant see it  
  
I aint gonna try and tell ya  
You know the story oh so well  
Everybodys out to buy and sell ya  
Youre gonna wind up by yourself  
Oh here it comes again  
No its never gonna end  
I must be dreaming  
  
Fool for the night  
Fool for the night  
Oh here it comes again  
I aint gonna try and tell ya  
You know the story oh so well  
Everybodys out to buy and sell ya  
Youre gonna wind up by yourself  
Oh here it comes again  
And I know its never gonna end  
I must be dreaming  
  
You love the night life  
All the neon and the noise  
And underneath the spotlight  
You keep rocking with the boys  
So youre gonna get it while you can  
But youre never gonna understand  
Nobody really gives a damn  
Fool for the night and you dont believe it  
Fool for the night why dont you see it
