Wind is blowin round the cabin  
I hate to hear that lonesome sound  
Im all alone and so downhearted  
Since my true love she aint around  
  
I hate to see that sun a sinkin  
Another night to toss and turn  
Another night to dream about her  
Another night for her I yearn  
  
She had no cause to go and leave me  
For I had never done her wrong  
She left our own little children  
Now with another man shes gone  
  
I hate to see that sun a sinkin  
Another night to toss and turn  
Another night to dream about her  
Another night for her I yearn  
  
Children they are sound asleepin  
Oh they dont know that their mothers gone  
What will I do when they awaken  
Can I tell them their mothers wrong  
  
I hate to see that sun a sinkin  
Another night to toss and turn  
Another night to dream about her  
Another night for her I yearn
