Its funny how love goes  
Cause I know this could never work out  
But honey how love grows  
Even though theres no reason to doubt  
This can never be  
You keep saying its wrong  
Neither one of us is free  
Still I want to hold on  
  
When even a fool would let go  
Cause he knows that theres no use in trying  
Even a child would say no  
When he knows that hell end up crying  
Tell me now is it wise holdin you  
Even a fool would let go  
  
Love has no reason  
Like the words in a song that dont rhyme  
My love has no season  
I just know that its there all the time  
Maybe just you and me  
I cant believe that its wrong  
Thinking about you and me  
Just makes me want to hold on  
  
When even a fool would let go  
Cause he knows that theres no use in trying  
Even a child would say no  
When he knows that hell end up crying  
Tell me now is it wise holdin you  
Even a fool would let go  
  
Tell me now is it wise holdin you  
When even a fool would let go
