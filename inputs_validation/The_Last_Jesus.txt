I see you I need you but I dont know your name  
I touch you say I love you but thats all you get for today  
Its easy so easy to tell you its gon be okay  
When I dont walk shoes havent been through what you been through  
Instead I push you away  
Sunday everyone looks like you  
But if our lives are cold inside tell me whats the use  
  
If I say I love Jesus but you cant see my Jesus  
My words are empty if they cant see Jesus in me  
No more excuses I give myself away  
Because I may be the only Jesus they see  
  
Too busy forgive me Ive got problems of my own  
Its easier to say your help is on the way  
But I was your help all along  
Were shouting were dancing but can the world see a change  
Am I just too selfish to see the love they need you put inside of me  
  
If we say we love Jesus but they cant see our Jesus  
Tell me whats the use if they cant see Jesus in you and me  
No more excuses we give it all away  
Because we may be the only Jesus they see  
  
If I am your hands and Your feet and if your church is built inside of me  
Where did we go wrong we been here too long we cant see your face anymore  
Its not the same anymore  
  
Have mercy on us Jesus please forgive us Jesus  
I lost my purpose if they cant see You in me  
See I lied too long and I change it all today  
Because I may be because I may be  
  
The only Jesus they see the only Jesus they see the only Jesus they see
