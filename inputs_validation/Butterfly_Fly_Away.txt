You tuck me in  
Turn out the light  
Kept me safe and sound at night  
Little girls depend on things like that  
  
Brushed my teeth and combed my hair  
Had to drive me everywhere  
You were always there when I looked back  
  
You had to do it all alone  
Make a living make a home  
Must have been as hard as it could be  
  
And when I couldnt sleep at night  
Scared things wouldnt turn out right  
You would hold my hand and sing to me  
  
Caterpillar in the tree how you wonder who youll be  
Cant go far but you can always dream  
Wish you may and wish you might  
Dont you worry hold on tight  
I promise you there will come a day  
Butterfly Fly Away  
Butterfly Fly Away butterfly fly away  
  
Flap your wing now you cant stay  
Take those dreams and make them all come true  
Butterfly Fly Away butterfly fly away  
We been waiting for this day  
All along and know just what to do  
Butterfly  
Butterfly  
Butterfly  
Butterfly Fly Away  
  
Butterfly Fly Away  
  
Butterfly Fly Away
