After the war  
And now that theyve sent us homeward  
I cant help but feel that Im on my own  
No one can see just what this conflict has done to  
The minds of the men who are on their way home  
  
Im scarred for life  
But its not my flesh thats wounded  
So how can I face the torment alone  
The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares  
I lay there and sweat until it gets light  
  
People say dont worry  
Say that times a perfect healer  
That the nightmares they will come to pass  
Cant hear what theyre saying  
I am living in my own world  
And Im feeling trancelike all the time  
  
I hear voices in my head  
Could I really be going crazy  
In the night the visions seem so real  
Do you care if you live or die  
When you laugh are you really crying  
Youre not sure whats real anymore  
  
Fortunes of war  
Fortunes of war  
Fortunes of war  
No pain anymore  
  
Sometimes I wake  
I feel that my spirits broken  
I wonder if Ive the strength  
Carry on carry on
