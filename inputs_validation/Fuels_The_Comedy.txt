Oh my God Im feeling crazy man  
What could it be  
As I walk into this place everyones staring at me  
Somehow I feel Ive got a fucked up disease  
As I part the seas  
Fingers come out pointing at me  
Do I make you laugh  
Do you think Im funny Ha ha  
Or funny queer  
Bitch get outta here  
Let me make myself clear  
I dont give a fuck  
All you people can suck my motherfuckin dick  
  
Whats with the hostility  
Why is it so provoked  
Youre living in a fantasy thats how you cope  
Go ahead kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
Feel that youre superior  
I feel your just plain absurd  
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred  
Go ahead kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
  
Oh my god This shit is crazy man  
Look at this scene as I watch these  
Stupid people act like they are machines  
They should really all drop their knees  
Oh the jealousy thats the one thing I guarantee  
Do I make you laugh  
Do you think Im funny Ha ha  
Or funny queer shit Get out of here  
Let me make myself clear  
I dont give a fuck  
All you people can suck my motherfuckin dick  
  
Whats with the hostility  
Why is it so provoked  
Youre living in a fantasy thats how you cope  
Go ahead kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
Feel that youre superior  
I feel your just plain absurd  
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred  
Go ahead kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
  
Whats with the hostility  
Why is it so provoked  
Youre living in a fantasy thats how you cope  
Go ahead kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
Feel that youre superior  
I feel your just plain absurd  
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred  
Go ahead kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy
