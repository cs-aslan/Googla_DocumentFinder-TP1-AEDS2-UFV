This is a story of mind soul and heart  
Come to think of it dont know where to start  
Id take it from the top but we dont have that much time  
So Im breakin off a piece of this crazy life of mine  
As a little girl I had a stubborn mind  
Bonnie and me were wild most of the time  
I used to sing for mamas company  
I guess that was the start of the woman I came to be  
Sometimes young yet so old  
Warm to the touch intellectually cold  
I love the how and why of it  
Thank God the pieces seem to fit  
Pieces seem to fit in this crazy life of mine  
Never will forget from whence I came  
I have some regrets but I made myself a name  
Two times a mother and as many times wed  
Tough times were around me but better times ahead  
If your heart can handle these words Ive said  
I see you and me in this crazy life of mine  
Mine  
Gotcha
