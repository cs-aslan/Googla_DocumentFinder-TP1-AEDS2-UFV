Restless soul enjoy your youth  
Like Muhammad its the truth  
Cant escape from the common rule  
If you hate something dont you do it too it too  
Small my table it sits just two  
Got so crowded I cant make room  
Oh where did they come from Stormed my room  
And you dare say it belongs to you to you  
This is not for you 3x  
Oh not for you ah you  
 scream my friends dont call me  
 friends no they dont scream  
 my friends dont call my friends dont  
All thats sacred comes from youth  
Dedication naive and true  
With no power nothing to do  
I still remember why dont you dont you  
This is not for you 3x  
Oh never was for you fuck you  
This is not for you  
Oh this is not for you yeah you  
This is not for you  
Oh not for you  
Oh you
