When I see those big brown eyes is when I take my queue  
It dont take me but a few minutes to get a message through  
I talked to you and you talked to me and we talked to one another  
It dont take us but a few minutes to understand each other  
  
If I was twentythree years old and you were twentytwo  
I bet no one would try to run our lives the way they do  
We take a chance and try romance be true to one another  
It dont take us but a few minutes when we want each other  
  
If I was in San Diego and you were in Portland Maine  
Id fly to you lock stock and bone in hail and pouring rain  
Over the mountains through the valleys coming home to each other  
It dont take us but a few minutes to get to one another  
  
You would write a love song and play on my guitar  
And if you should in Hollywood become a movie star  
Would you let your heart forget I loved you and you only  
It dont take but a few minutes when youre feeling lonely
