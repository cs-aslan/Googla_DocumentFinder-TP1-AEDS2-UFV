I seen an old fighter tired and in trouble  
Who just couldnt take anymore  
Somethin inside him kept fighting to finish  
With only his feet on the flooryeah  
  
Lord I know that its worth any price you could pay  
To see truth in whatever disguise  
But Id payed double for one look of pleasure  
A piece of relief in his eyes  
  
Aint that clown laughin like crazy  
Aint his eyes empty and deep  
Dont he sound sad as a baby  
When she cries out in her sleep  
  
We measured the space between Waylon and Willie  
And Willie and Waylon and me  
But there wasnt nothin like Billy Jo Shaver  
What Billy Jo Shaver should beno  
  
When he showed up sick later all bit by a spider  
And crazy to look in the eye  
He put on a show that was sad as it should of been  
And nobody even knew why  
  
Aint that clown laughin like crazy  
Aint his eyes empty and deep  
Dont he sound sad as a baby  
When she cries out in her sleep
