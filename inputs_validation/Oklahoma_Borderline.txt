Well its rainin down in Houston  
And I got holes in both my shoes  
Babys put me on the street  
She says Im through with you  
  
She thinks Im gonna miss her  
Someone tell her that shes wrong  
Im goin back to Oklahoma boys  
Cause thats where I belong  
  
I need one good ride  
Ill be satisfied  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
If we roll all night  
Shell be comin into sight  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
  
Well now I dont need no Texas girl  
Doggin me around  
I may be a Okie son  
But Ive still been to town  
  
Well those Oklahoma city girls  
They always treat you right  
Well tell mama that Im comin home not sure of this line  
And Im leavin out tonight  
  
I need one good ride  
Ill be satisfied  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
If we roll all night  
Shell be comin into sight  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
  
So with two bucks in my pocket  
And my thumb stuck in the wind  
When I cross Red River boys  
I wont be back again  
  
Give me old back roads and truck stops  
And 18 wheels that whine  
And some good ol boy to take me  
To that Oklahoma line  
  
I need one good ride  
Ill be satisfied  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
If we roll all night  
Shell be comin into sight  
Come on Oklahoma borderline  
  
I caught one good ride  
Shes comin into sight  
Hello Oklahoma borderline
