Ooh the beat of my heart  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
  
Always here  
Ill be close to you  
But you wont see me  
On the street or underground  
Ill be there somewhere  
You can look around  
You can listen out  
But you wont find me  
Beyond the shadow  
Of a doubt  
Oh Ill be there for you  
  
Youve been living in another world  
Ever since I met you  
Dont wanna treat you like a little girl  
I know you better  
  
The beat of my heart  
If you listen closely now  
To the beat of my heart  
Youll find your way  
Home  
The beat of my heart  
You wont be lonely  
  
Girl Im here  
And Ill always be  
There when you need me  
Close at hand  
Never far away  
Ill be there for you  
  
Youre such a crazy little pretty girl  
How could I ever forget you  
You tried to take me to another world  
But I wouldnt let you  
  
And the beat of my heart  
If you listen closely now  
To the beat of my heart  
You wont be lonely  
The beat of my heart  
Better listen to me now  
The beat of my heart  
Calling you  
Home  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
You wont be lonely  
  
Youve been living in another world  
Ever since I met you  
Dont wanna treat you like a little girl  
I know you better  
  
And the beat of my heart  
If you listen closely now  
To the beat of my heart  
You wont be lonely  
The beat of my heart  
Better listen closely now  
The beat of my heart  
And its calling you  
Home  
  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
If you listen closely now  
For the beat of my heart  
Youll find your way home  
Home  
  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
Ooh the beat of my heart  
Its calling you  
Home
