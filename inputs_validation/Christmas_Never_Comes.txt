Talk about the heart of christmas  
Talk about the reason and the rhyme  
Talk about the sentimental feelings  
Talk about the candlelight and wine  
Talk about the children  
Listen to the voices singing  
Listen to the laughter as they play  
But listen to the whisper of a heartbeat  
Whose loneliness is never far away  
chorus  
In some hearts its never christmas  
But its winter all the time  
All our lives spent waiting for the sun  
Children of tomorrow  
How they need a star to follow  
In some hearts its always winter  
For some hearts it seems  
That christmas never comes  
Dont forget the winters children  
Shadows on a star that never shines  
Looking for the love that never happened  
Looking for the chris in christmas time  
The lonely voice  
That cant rejoice  
That has no choice  
chorus  
In some hearts its never christmas  
But its winter all the time  
All our lives spent waiting for the sun  
Children of tomorrow  
How they need a star to follow  
In some hearts its always winter  
For some hearts it seems  
That christmas never comes  
chorus  
In some hearts its never christmas  
But its winter all the time  
All our lives spent waiting for the sun  
Children of tomorrow  
How they need a star to follow  
In some hearts its always winter  
For some hearts it seems  
That christmas never comes
