Taking us down

To the beat  
In the deep of the night

Running right on time  
Going down down down  
In the deep of the night  
  
Ooooooooohoooooooh  
Dancing on the nightwire

People meet  
Get wild in the street  
In the heat  
To the beat  
In the deep of the night  
  
And thats the way  
We communicate  
Going down down down  
In the deep of the night
