Its your anniversary isnt it  
And your man aint acting right  
So you packin your Damier luggage up  
Callin my cell phone tryin catch a flight  
You know one thing straight  
Ill be there girl whenever you call me  
When you at home thats your man  
Soon as you land you say thats all me  
Cause shit aint all G with him no more you aint entertained  
Since I meet you a couple months ago you aint been the same  
Not sayin Im the richest man alive but Im in the game  
As long as you keep it one hundred Imma spend this change  
  
Chorus  
Whenever you need me  
Whenever want me  
You know you can call me Ill be there shortly  
Dont care what your friends say cause they dont know me  
I can be your best friend and you be my homie

You know if I ball then we all gon stunt  
Send her my way she aint gotta hold up  
Whenever you call baby I roll up I roll up I roll up  
Whenever you call baby I roll up I roll up I roll up  
Whenever you call baby I roll up  
  
I try to stay out your business  
But on the real youre so obvious  
And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fuckin up  
Your mans gonna catch onto us  
That white sand surrounding us  
He be handcuffing he should work for them officers  
If you rolling I got a spot  
Where I can put you on this medical  
And send you home doctored up  
You wanna ride with me cause you say that he boring  
Wake up you rollin weed cooking eggs in the morning  
Aint scared to spend this money Ill make more of it  
First you was in the sky now you say you in orbit  
  
Chorus  
  
No matter where I am  
No matter where you are  
Ill be there when its over baby  
Cause I was there from the start  
No matter if Im near  
Dont matter if your far  
All you do is pick the phone up lady  
And Ill be there when you call  
  
Whenever you need me  
Whenever want me  
You know you can call me Ill be there shortly  
Dont care what your friends say cause they dont know me  
I can be your best friend and you be my homie  
I aint gon flex Im not gon front  
You know if I ball then we all gon stunt  
Send her my way she aint gotta hold up  
Whenever you call baby I roll up

You know you can call me Ill be there shortly  
Dont care what your friends say cause they dont know me  
I can be your best friend and you be my homie

You know if I ball then we all gon stunt  
Send her my way she aint gotta hold up  
Whenever you call baby I roll up I roll up I roll up
