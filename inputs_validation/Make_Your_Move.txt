You better not mess around with me  
You know you better think twice  
Because Ive been running on a really bad streak  
And Im just looking for a fight  
So you took me by surprise  
Thought I was gonna run  
But the cross fire is in my eyes  
And my body holds the gun  
Here I come  
You better get ready to make your move  
Got my finger on the trigger and Im gonna shoot  
Get ready make your move  
Got your name on my bullet and my aim is true  
  
You better not mess around with me  
I got you in my sights  
Ive backs against the wall  
You know that you better think twice  
One of us is gonna fall  
Im looking for a fight and the time is right  
You better get ready to make your move  
Got my finger on the trigger and Im gonna shoot  
I say you better get ready  
Make your move  
Got your name on my bullet and my aim is true
