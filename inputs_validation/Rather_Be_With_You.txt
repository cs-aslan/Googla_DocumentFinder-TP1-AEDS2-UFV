Sometimes I look at you  
Feel like I make you blue  
Wish I could make us all brand new  
Wish I had some mystery left  
To my personality  
Then I could wink at you  
And youd laugh like you used to  
  
You know I think well make it through  
Cause if its all the same  
Id rather be with you  
We could move on if you wanted to  
Cause if its all the same  
Id rather be with you  
  
I know its hard not to  
Continue what we do  
And remove a pattern  
Like an old tattoo  
I go with you  
You go with me  
But if we had some clarity  
Well maybe we could stop ourselves  
Before we both get silly  
  
You know I think well make it through  
Cause if its all the same  
Id rather be with you  
We could move on if you wanted to  
Cause if its all the same  
Id rather be with you  
  
Always felt strong  
We belong  
From the first time you stood next to me  
Am I still your girl  
Cause in a crowded world  
You are still the only man I see  
  
Maybe wed stop ourselves  
Before we both get silly  
  
You know I think well make it through  
Cause if its all the same  
Id rather be with you  
We could move on if you wanted to  
Cause if its all the same  
Id rather be with you  
  
You know I think well make it through  
Cause if its all the same  
Id rather be with you  
We could move on if you wanted to  
Cause if its all the same  
Id rather be with you
