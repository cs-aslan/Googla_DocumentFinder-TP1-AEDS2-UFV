Theres been some things that Ive wanted to say a long time  
Never have I spent a day without you on my mind  
And Ive tried a lot of songs and I need to try one thats new  
But I dont have anymore love songs to try on you  
  
We just cant ever get it together it seems  
Youare arms dont hold me the way that they do in my dreams  
And its hard to make up things that you never do  
And I dont have anymore love songs to make up about you  
  
I dont have anymore love songs to write for you  
Too many I wrote before have never come true  
And its hard to make up lines for things you dont do  
And I dont have anymore love songs to sing for you  
  
And its hard to make up things that you never do  
And I dont have anymore love songs to sing for you
