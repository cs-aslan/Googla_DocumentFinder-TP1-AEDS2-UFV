Here we are now  
Everything is about to change  
We face tomorrow as we say goodbye to yesterday  
A chapter ending but the stories only just begun  
A page is turning for everyone  
So Im moving on  
Letting go  
Holding on to tomorrow  
Ive always got the memories while Im finding out who Im gonna be  
We might be apart but I hope you always know  
Youll be with me wherever I go  
Wherever I go  
So excited I can barely even catch my breath  
We have each other to lean on for the road ahead  
This happy ending is the start of all our dreams  
And I know your heart is with me  
So Im moving on  
Letting go  
Holding on to tomorrow  
Ive always got the memories while Im finding out who Im gonna be  
We might be apart but I hope you always know  
Youll be with me wherever I go  
Its time to show the world weve got something to say  
A song to sing out loud well never fade away  
I know Ill miss you but well meet again someday  
Well never fade away  
So Im moving on  
Letting go  
Holding on to tomorrow  
Ive always got the memories while Im finding out who Im gonna be  
We might be apart but I hope you always know  
Youll be with me wherever I go  
So Im moving on  
Letting go  
Holding on to tomorrow  
Ive always got the memories while Im finding out who Im gonna be  
We might be apart but I hope you always know  
Youll be with me wherever I go  
Wherever Wherever I go
