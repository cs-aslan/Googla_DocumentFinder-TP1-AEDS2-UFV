Worst part about fighting with yourself  
Is that even if you win you loose  
Cant place the blame on everybody else  
So Im fighting with myself over you  
  
I should have played it different but I didnt know  
I never pictured you without me or you letting go  
I should have seen it coming  
I should have thought it through  
The best part of me has always been you  
And no apology can bring you back to me  
Feels like Im suffocating you are the air Im breathing out  
Im so down and cant move and Im beating me up over you  
  
The worst part about fighting with yourself  
Is that even if you win you lose yeah  
Cant place the blame on everybody else  
So Im fighting with myself over you  
Maybe its better making you feel you were crazy  
Instead of just being the man to fight it  
And cant blame you knew that I was cheating  
And I knew that you knew  
But when you call me on it  
I just turned around on you  
Begging you dont let go  
 Confusion confusing you of not trusting me  
All Im doing wrong so I sit around fighting myself all day long
