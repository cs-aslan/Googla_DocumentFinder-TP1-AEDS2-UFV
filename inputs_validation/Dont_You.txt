Blaine  
You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar  
When I met you  
I picked you out I shook you up and turned you around  
Turned you into someone new  
  
Now five years later on youve got the world at your feet  
Success has been so easy for you  
But dont forget its me who put you where you are now  
And I can put you back down too  
  
Dont dont you want me  
You know I cant believe it  
When I hear that you wont see me  
  
Dont dont you want me  
You know I dont believe it  
When you say that you dont need me  
  
Both  
Its much too late to find  
You think youve changed your mind  
Youd better change it back or we will both be sorry  
  
Dont you want me baby  
Dont you want me ohh  
Dont you want me baby  
Dont you want me ohh  
  
Rachel  
I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar  
That much is true  
But even then I knew Id find a much better place  
Either with or without you  
  
The five years we have had have been such good times  
I still love you  
But now I think its time I lived my life on my own  
I guess its just what I must do  
  
Both  
Dont dont you want me  
You know I cant believe it  
When I hear that you wont see me  
  
Dont dont you want me  
You know I dont believe you  
When you say that you dont need me  
  
Its much too late to find  
When you think youve changed your mind  
Youd better change it back or we will both be sorry  
  
Dont you want me baby  
Dont you want me ohh  
Dont you want me baby  
Dont you want me ohh  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Dont you want me baby  
Dont you want me oh  
Dont you want me baby  
Dont you want me oh  
Dont you want me baby  
Dont you want me oh  
Dont you want me baby  
Dont you want me oh  
Dont you want me baby
