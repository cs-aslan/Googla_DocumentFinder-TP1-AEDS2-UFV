Felt so right for awhile almost really believed  
I could stay here forever my heart could be free  
Oh I wish it were that easy but its never been for me  
Im not your girl  
  
Feels so warm and so safe here now dont get me wrong  
But its selfish to stay here Id be leading you on  
Maybe someone else can give you  
What you really really want  
Im not your girl  
  
They say people change  
I wish it were true  
Its something Ive tried so hard to do  
I cant explain  
Why right feels so wrong  
And I keep hearing the same old song  
  
See Ive been here before left a good thing behind  
Cant see where Im going maybe loves really blind  
Im so afraid to lose the one who was so hard to find  
But Im not your girl  
  
They say people change  
I wish it were true  
Its something Ive tried so hard to do  
I cant explain  
Why right feels so wrong  
And I keep hearing the same old song  
  
One day Ill come back here and Ill knock at your door  
Shell be sweet when she answers then Ill know for sure  
That life is never easy in my complicated world  
Im not your girl
