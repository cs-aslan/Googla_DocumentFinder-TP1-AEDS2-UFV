Boy I see ya looking at me  
I feel your eyes on me like you gotta have me  
Watching every move like its for you  
You cant help it you attracted like a magnet  
My love aint easy  
You gon have to put in some work  
You cant buy me a drink thinking Ima fall for your flirt  
You gotta make it right  
If you wanna go spend some time  
You gotta raise the bar tonight  
  
Chorus  
Love me baby treat me right  
Make it eternity and not only one night  
If you love me til the end of time  
Then I will promise you the night of your life  
So now love me baby treat me right  
And well be riding it from morning til midnight  
If you love me til the end of time  
Then I will promise you the night of your life  
Night of your life life life  
Night of your life life life  
  
I could have ya if I wanted to  
Down on one knee in front of me where them bells ringing  
I could claim ya be your savior  
Wrap your heart inside of these arms and youll never leave  
I could have your hands tied round my body all up on me  
Boy youll be stuck to me if I wanted with no release  
Ill have you begging wishing now I give you a piece  
Baby youll never be the same  
  
Chorus  
  
Taller than a mountain deeper than the sea  
Youre boiling hot for me babe one hundred degrees  
I want you to love me like your favorite dream  
Lets make tonight a reality  
  
So now love me baby treat me right  
And well be riding it from morning til midnight  
If you love me til the end of time  
Then I will promise you the night of your life  
Night of your life life life  
Night of your life life life  
Night of your life life life
