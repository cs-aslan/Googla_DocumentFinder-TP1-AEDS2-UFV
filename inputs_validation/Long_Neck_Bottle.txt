Longneck bottle  
Let go of my hand  
Hey jukebox dont start playin that song again  
Cause theres a girl at home who loves me  
You know she wont understand  
Longneck bottle  
Let go of my hand  
  
Hey barroom mirror on the wall  
Go stare at someone else  
Dont show the world the fool I am  
Just keep it to yourself  
  
Longneck bottle  
Let go of my hand  
Hey jukebox dont start playin that song again  
Cause theres a girl at home who loves me  
You know she wont understand  
Longneck bottle  
Let go of my hand  
  
Dance floor seems youre underneath my feet  
Everywhere I turn  
I oughta waltz right out of them swingin doors  
But thats a step I just cant learn  
  
Longneck bottle  
Let go of my hand  
Hey jukebox dont start playin that song again  
Cause theres a girl at home who loves me  
You know she wont understand  
Longneck bottle  
Let go of my hand
