If Im gone when you wake up

But If Im gone when you wake up  
Please dont cry  
And if Im gone when you wake up

As a time of heartbreak and distress  
Remember me remember me  
Cause Ill be with you in your dreams  
Oh oh  
  
Dont cry

And although my bodys gone oh  
Ill be there to comfort you at all times  
Oh oh  
  
But If Im gone when you wake up
