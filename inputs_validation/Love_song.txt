The words I have to say  
May well be simple but theyre true  
Until you give your love  
Theres nothing more that we can do  
  
Love is the opening door  
Love is what we came here for  
No one could offer you more  
Do you know what I mean  
Have your eyes really seen  
  
You say its very hard  
To leave behind the life we knew  
But theres no other way  
Now its really up to you  
  
Love is the key we must turn  
Truth is the flame we must burn  
Freedoms the lesson we learn  
Do you know what I mean  
Have your eyes really seen  
  
Love is the key we must turn  
Truth is the flame we must burn  
Freedoms the lesson we learn  
Do you know what I mean  
Have your eyes really seen  
  
Do you know what I mean  
Have your eyes really seen
