To see you coming round the bend  
I just cant think of anything that could make me smile like you can  
When youre coming round the bend noooo  
  
Ive been in love a time or two before  
And all of that experience allows me to be sure  
That youre the one  
Sure as darkness brings the rising sun  
  
 Chorus   
  
We both share the trials of the road  
Cursing all the miles and the nights we spend alone  
But then I smile  
Youve been waiting for me all the while  
  
 Chorus   
  
I know the sun could hide behind the clouds for days  
And Ive walked down crowded streets and never seen a smiling face  
And times like those Ill just close my eyes and picture when  
  
 Chorus  Ill see you coming
