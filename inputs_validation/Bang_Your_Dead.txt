Oh god oh god Dumping so early in the evening I really didnt mean that I
really didnt mean that  
  
Above the ground Im lifted to the sky  
And down like a tumbling weed I found myself stranded high and dry  
A circus ride oh it only costs a dime  
But if you wanna see the fireworks you might have to pay a lifetime  
  
Cause love is a carnival  
With lots of laughs wonderful rides and danger  
But it feels so good  
With rockets shootin in your head  
round and round and round you go  
Bang youre dead baby Bang youre dead baby  
  
Like a boomerang keeps twisting twisting in your heart  
You know the funny part of it is you always end up where you start  
Youre headed for big clouds Got the silver lining  
But youre in for a big surprise  
Theres a river of tears behind it  
  
Cause love is a carnival  
With lots of baubles bangles and beads  
Beware beware beware  
It feels so good feels so good  
With rockets shootin in your head  
round and round and round you go  
Bang youre dead baby Bang youre dead baby  
  
Above the ground Im lifted Spininng spinning spinning out of control  
Higher higher higher higher higher  
Above the ground Im lifted yeah to the sky  
And down like a tumbling weed I found myself stranded high and dry  
A circus ride you know it it only costs a dime  
But if you wanna see the fireworks you might have to pay  
Hey yeah yeah to the sky high And down like a tumbling weed  
I found myself stranded stranded  
Bang youre dead
