Shes starin at me  
Im sittin wonderin what shes thinkin  
Nobodys talkin  
Cause talkin just turned into screamin  
And now is Im yellin over her  
Shes yellin over me  
All that that means  
Is neither of us is listening  
And whats even worse  
That we dont even remember why were fighting  
  
So both of us are mad for  
  
Nothin  
Fighting for  
Nothin  
Crying for  
Nothin  
Whoa  
But we wont let it go for  
Nothin  
No not for  
Nothin  
This should be nothin to a love like what we got  
Oh baby  
I know sometimes  
Its gonna rain  
But baby can we make up now  
Cause I cant sleep through the pain  
Cant sleep through the pain  
  
Chorus  
Girl I dont wanna go to bed  
Mad at you  
And I dont want you to go to bed  
Mad at me  
No I dont wanna go to bed  
Mad at you  
And I dont want you to go to bed  
Mad at me  
Oh no no no  
  
And it gets me upset girl  
When youre constantly accusing  
Askin questions like youve already known  
Were fighting this war baby  
When both of us are losing  
This aint the way that love is supposed to go  
Whoa  
What happened to workin it out  
Weve falled into this place  
Where you aint backin down  
And I aint backin down  
  
So what the hell do we do now  
Its all for  
  
Nothin  
Fighting for  
Nothin  
Crying for  
Nothin  
Whoa  
But we wont let it go for  
Nothin  
No not for  
Nothin  
This should be nothin to a love like what we got  
Oh baby  
I know sometimes  
Its gonna rain  
But baby can we make up now  
Cause I cant sleep through the pain  
Cant sleep through the pain  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh baby this love aint gonna be perfect  
Perfect perfect oh oh  
And just how good its gonna be  
We can fuss and we can fight  
Long as everything alright between us  
Before we go to sleep  
  
Baby were gonna be happy  
  
I know sometimes  
Its gonna rain  
But baby can we make up now  
Cause I cant sleep through the pain  
Cant sleep through the pain  
  
Chorus
