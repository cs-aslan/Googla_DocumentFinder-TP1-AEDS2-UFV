I sat down and wrote this letter  
Telling you that I felt better  
Since youd gone and I was free  
Im so happy  
I have so little time to spare now  
Im wanted almost everywhere now  
I make out like Casanova  
Friends are always coming over  
Signed my name as if I meant it  
Sealed it with a kiss and sent it  
The letter had improved my mood  
Happy in my solitude  
But halfway home I changed my tune  
And when I saw my lonely room  
The mirror caught my eye  
When I sit down I cry  
Big lie small world  
Big lie small world  
I had to intercept that letter  
Telling you that I was better  
I raced to catch the postmans van  
He was leaving as I ran  
I miss the bus I miss the train  
I end up walking in the rain  
Big dog chased me down the street  
I hadnt had a bite to eat  
Feeling sorry for myself  
Wishing I was someone else  
I walked across the city  
Cause I couldnt stand your pity  
Big lie small world  
Big lie small world  
The place you live looks opulent  
And obviously a higher rent  
Than our cozy little room  
I had this sense of doom  
The landlord says youre out of town  
That your new boyfriends always around  
The hour was getting late  
So I sit down and wait  
Heres the postman with my letter  
Coming down the path hed better  
Give that thing to me  
I have to make him see  
Begging doesnt do the trick  
He thinks that Im a lunatic  
And then who comes upon the scene  
But your new boyfriend Mr Clean  
I hit the postman hit your lover  
Grabbed the letter ran for cover  
The police arrived in time for tea  
Said theyd like to question me  
I can only curse my fate  
I have to face the magistrate  
It hasnt been the best of days  
Id like to fly away  
Big lie small world  
Big lie small world
