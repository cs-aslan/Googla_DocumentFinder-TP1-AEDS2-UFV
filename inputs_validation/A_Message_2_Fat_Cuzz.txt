Ya oh  
I was juz told  
You get your freedom  
By telling youre enemy  
That  
Youll do anything to get youre freedom  
Then youll get it  
Its the only way youll get it  
When you get that kinda attitude  
Then they label you as a crazy negro  
Or theyll just call you a crazy nigga  
They dun say negro  
Or theyll call you an extremest or a subversive  
Or a sedetiast  
Or a red or a radical  
But when you stay radical long enough  
And get enough people to like you  
Youll get your freedom  
So dun run around here trying  
To to make friends with someone who will deprive you of youre rights  
There not youre friends  
No there youre enemys  
And treat them like that  
And fight them  
And youll get youre freedom  
And after you get youre freedom youre enemy will respect you  
And well respect you  
And I say that with no hate  
Cause I dun have no hate in me  
I have no hate at all  
So I say to you  
Big man Im the man you think you are  
If you want to no what ill do  
Figure out what youll do and ill do the same only more of it
