People buzzing around  
They dont know a thing  
They just a laugh  
And the ones in power are always pulling the strings  
People do what they do  
How much can they take  
They just get the news  
And the ones in power always get the cake  
But you got ambition  
You got the face come on lets go to a dangerous place  
You got the class I think youre desperate  
Lets go to a dangerous place  
Come on lets go come on  
Lets go come on  
I promise this thing will sell  
I promise Ill take you to heaven  
I promise this thing will sell and I just cant wait  
You have your plans all these plans  
And there are moments  
Shall I call them a chance  
If I was you I would make them all mine  
And if I aint got the power I would commit a crime  
But you got ambition  
I promise this thing will sell  
Im gonna make you a deal  
You know Im your friend  
Im gonna stay with you until the very end  
I know you got the guts  
I got a lot of time  
Im gonna make me yours  
Before I make you mine
