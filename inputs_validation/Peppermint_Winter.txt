Theres the snow  
Look out below  
And bundle up cause here it comes  
Run outside  
So starryeyed  
A snowball fight breaks out  
And winter has finally begun  
  
I twirl through the driveway with angelic grace til I slip on the sidewalk
and fall on my face  
This peppermint winter is so sugarsweet  
I dont need to taste to believe  
Whats December without Christmas Eve  
  
Hop in the sleigh  
And well glide away into the night  
And well sip on moonlight  
Runny nose  
My frosty toes are getting cold but I feel alive so I smile wide  
  
The snowflakes start falling and I start to float til my mean older brother
stuffs snow down my coat  
This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet  
I dont need to taste to believe  
Whats December without Christmas Eve
