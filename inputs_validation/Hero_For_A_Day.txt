Lady you need a lover  
Someone to take you and love you all the way  
I know you long for that feelin  
For a man to be stealin your heart away  
You need a hero for a day  
  
Youll never be missin the moments when were kissin  
Ill never steal your love away  
Just let me borrow one memory for tomorrow  
Ill be your hero for a day  
  
Lady you need a lover  
Someone to take you and love you all the way  
Let me be the hero  
A place where you can go  
Let me be your hero for a day  
Lady Ill be your hero
