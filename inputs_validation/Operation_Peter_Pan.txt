Operation Peter Pan Lyrics  
hola  
Rojo  
Morning to you  
You always helped me chase demons away  
Dont know what Ill do without you  
So Pan is the name of the plane  
second to the right  
Straight on til morning  
Thats where Ill be waiting  
Second to the right  
Straight on til morning  
hola  
Ticktock  
My time is up  
Pedro says  
I will forget him in days  
In my new life no room for a lost boy  
Boys can be so dumb sometimes  
second to the right  
Straight on til morning  
Thats where Ill be waiting  
Second to the right  
Straight on til morning  
Straight on til morning  
kiss Pedro for me
