You passed me by one sunny day  
Flashed those big brown eyes my way  
And oh I wanted you forever more  
Now Im not one that gets around  
I swear my feet stuck to the ground  
And though I never did meet you before  
  
Chorus  
I said Hello Mary Lou  
Goodbye heart  
Sweet Mary Lou  
Im so in love with you  
I knew Mary Lou  
Wed never part  
So Hello Mary Lou  
Goodbye heart  
  
I saw your lips I heard your voice  
believe me I just had no choice  
Wild horses couldnt make me stay away  
I thought about a moonlit night  
My arms about good an tight  
Thats all I had to see for me to say  
  
Chorus
