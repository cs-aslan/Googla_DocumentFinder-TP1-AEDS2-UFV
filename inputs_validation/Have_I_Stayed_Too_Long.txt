I think this party is going badly  
Is there something wrong  
I see faces looking sadly  
Have I stayed too long  
  
Even though I see me smile  
That same scene and acting wild  
Pretending that I really care  
Smiling face is just a mask  
  
Without love a kiss is nothing  
Have I done something wrong  
I look around and I cant find nothing  
Have I stayed too long  
  
Without beginning there aint no end  
Without a hope you got no friends  
Have I gone from loving you  
To find out whats behind my tears  
  
I got to get out of this place  
Im tired tired of waiting  
This phony place  
  
I think this party is going badly  
Is there something wrong  
I see faces looking sadly  
I guess Im going home  
  
Even though you see me smiling  
That same scene and acting wild  
Pretending that I really care  
Smiling face is just a mask
