I try to reason and tell myself youll return  
But you are gone and I know I know I know youre gone  
You were mine for only a minute  
And if I hurt you I didnt intend it  
  
You are gone away I keep tellin my mind  
Youre not gonna stay  
But I believe sometimes that I lost you baby  
I lost you baby you were gone  
  
Forgive and forget it thats not what Ill ask you to do  
Cause I want you back yeah  
You know you know I want you back  
And in concluding my mental discussion  
I found I lost my prized possession  
  
You are gone away I keep tellin my mind  
Youre not gonna stay  
And I believe sometimes that I lost you baby  
I lost you baby you were gone  
  
You were mine for only a minute  
And if I hurt you I didnt intend it  
  
You are gone away I keep tellin my mind  
Youre not gonna stay  
And I believe sometimes that I lost you baby  
I lost you baby and you were gone  
  
Lie lies I told you baby  
I never meant to say  
  
But a desperate mind  
Does a desperate thing baby  
I cant loose you  
I do whatever I got to do  
  
I never loved like this before  
I dont mean to be so silly  
Such a little girl sometimes  
I really want to be your woman  
I just  
  
It gets so heavy baby  
It gets so heavy  
And I just want you  
I just want you to think about  
Dont let me go
