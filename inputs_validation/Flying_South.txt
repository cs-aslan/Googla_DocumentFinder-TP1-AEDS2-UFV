Summers gone and wintertimes a comin and where I am aint where I want to
be  
I can hear my southern home a callin and its callin out that old wide goose
and me  
I got kids and kin down in Kentucky I got lots of aunts in Alabam  
Mom a waitin down in Mississippi and my sists in Carolinas honey land  
Flyin flyin south to Dixie Lord Ive been so lonesome and alone  
Stayin aint no use because my hearts an old wild goose  
And so tomorrow Ill be flyin south for home  
  
Grandma and grandpas down in Georgia and my sweethearts down in Tennessee  
Theres a little part of all the southland in my heart  
And honey in the south is where I want to be  
Summers gone and wintertimes a comin and where I am aint where I want to
be  
I can hear my southern home a callin and its callin out that old wide goose
and me  
Flyin flyin south to Dixie  
And tomorrow Ill be flyin south for home
