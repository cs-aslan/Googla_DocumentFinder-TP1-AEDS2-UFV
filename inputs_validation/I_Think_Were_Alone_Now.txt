Children behave  
Thats what they say when were together  
And watch how you play  
They dont understand  
And so were  
  
Chorus  
Running just as fast as we can  
Holdin on to one anothers hand  
Tryin to get away into the night  
And then you put your arms around me  
And we tumble to the ground  
And then you say  
  
I think were alone now  
There doesnt seem to be anyone around  
I think were alone now  
The beating of our hearts is the only sound  
  
Look at the way  
We gotta hide what were doin  
cause what would they say  
If they ever knew  
And so were  
  
Repeat chorus  
I think were alone now  
There doesnt seem to be anyone around  
I think were alone now  
The beating of our hearts is the only sound
