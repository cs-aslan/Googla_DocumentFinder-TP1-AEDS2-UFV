I wasnt there for you  
I wasnt there for you  
I know weathers gonna be fine  
But I cant see you cross the streamline  
My love waits for me in daytime  
But I cant see you through the snow blind  
  
But I wasnt there for you  
You are gone I wasnt there for you  
Goodbyes are long  
Goodbye I wasnt there for you  
Goodbye  
I wasnt there for goodbye  
I wasnt there for goodbye  
  
Well I know time reveals in hindsight  
I can hand wrestle with the stormy night  
Because your love lasts a lifetime  
But I can see you through the snow blind  
  
But I wasnt there for you  
You are gone I wasnt there for you  
Goodbyes are long  
You are gone I wasnt there for you  
Goodbyes are long  
Goodbye  
  
I wasnt there for you  
I wasnt there  
I wasnt there for you  
I wasnt there for you  
You are gone I wasnt there for you  
Goodbyes are long  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye
