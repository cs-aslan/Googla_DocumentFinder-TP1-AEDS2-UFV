There is no end to this  
I have seen your face  
But I dont recognize all these things  
You must have left behind  
Its a problem you know  
Thats been there all your life  
I try to make you see the world without a view  
That just turn black and white  
At night it gets cold and  
Youd dearly like to turn away  
The escape that fills  
that makes you want to turn on heel  
Alone alone alone alone  
  
There is no end to this  
I cant turn away  
Another picture but the scene  
Its still the same  
There is no room to move  
Or try to look away  
Remember life is strange  
The life keeps getting stranger every day  
I try so hard but this attitudes  
A type that wont subside  
No matter what they say  
Remember your heart beats you day at night  
Your heart beats you day at night 3
