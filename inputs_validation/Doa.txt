Oh you know I did it  
Its over and I feel fine  
Nothing you could say is gonna change my mind  
Waiting and I wait at the longest night  
Nothing like the taste to sweet decline  
  
I was down I fell I fell so fast  
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass  
Never say forever cause nothing last  
Dancing with the thorns of my buried past  
  
Nevermind theres nothing I can do  
Bet your life theres something killing you  
  
Its a shame we have to die my dear  
No ones getting out of here alive  
This time  
  
What a way to go they have no fear  
No ones getting out of here alive  
This time  
  
Finished Im getting you off my chest  
Made you come clean in a dirty dress  
A promise is a promise you kept in check  
Heart across a heart that beats its best  
  
Take a good hard look for the very last time  
The very last one in a very long line  
Only took a second to say goodbye  
Then the pleasure bout the pleasures  
Been mine all mine  
  
Aint no way DOA  
Aint no way DOA  
  
Its a shame we have to disappear  
No ones getting out of here alive  
  
This time  
This time  
This time
