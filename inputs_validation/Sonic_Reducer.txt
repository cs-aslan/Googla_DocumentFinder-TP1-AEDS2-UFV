I dont need anyone dont need no mom and dad  
Dont need no good advice dont need no human rights

People out on the streets they dont know who I am

Things will be different then the sun will rise from here  
Then Ill be ten feet tall then youll be nothing at all  
I got my time machine got my lectronic dream  
Sonic reducer aint no loseroh  
Sonic reducer sonic reduceroh
