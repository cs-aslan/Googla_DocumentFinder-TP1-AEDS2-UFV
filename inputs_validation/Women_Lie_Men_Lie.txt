Chorus x6  
Women lie men lie  
Women lie men lie  
Women lie men lie  
Numbers dont lie  
  
Ay step up in the party and them bad bitches be on me  
I be sippin on Patron when Im jumpin out Ferraris  
I be rockin Gucci sometime Louie Im retarded  
And dem rims by Asanti But the shades by Bulgari  
Hand on my scrap I got my mind on my money  
I got my mind on dine and he aint takin nothing from me  
Hand is on this choppa tek  
Hand is on this choppa tek  
Hand is on a hundred round cause thats how much the choppa shoot  
Ballin is my hobby got a hundred goons shoppin  
Gotta 5 star with me and i met her in the lobby  
Took her to the room she hit me wit that line  
Said she aint that type of girl so I told her stop lyin  
  
Chorus x6  
  
Young money  
yeah  
OK I aint gotta lie cross my heart hope to die  
If numbers dont lie G5 over sky  
I fucked her pussy good make her cry if I tried  
Im tired of being sick and Im sick of being tired  
Tired of these niggas and tired of these bitches  
Shit let em lie as long as they aint snitching  
And men lie about women  
And shit women lie about plenty huh  
They aint lying on me Im in the bed with 2 fine bitches lying on me  
So that would make 3 and numbers dont lie  
And money dont lie  
And neither do I  
Bitch  
  
Chorus  
  
the numbers dont lie the the numbers dont lie  
  
Im tryin to count to a billion my bitch Brazilian  
Hop in that Lamb push the button lose the ceiling  
Sun out no rain drops postin the same spot  
Right here in North North Memphis  
Where I came from  
Hundred on the neck I aint never had shit  
The streets gave me family Barry White cut the check  
Aint no secret in the streets niggas know I got next  
Got the swagger through the roof I was born just to flex  
Zip code on my wrist phone number in the bank  
In my ten til six with my 305 paint  
I got my 357 and my 501s  
In a Lear 55 wit my Air Force Ones no lie  
  
Chorus  
  
Ay its yo boy yo gotti  
Say what you want but the numbers dont lie
