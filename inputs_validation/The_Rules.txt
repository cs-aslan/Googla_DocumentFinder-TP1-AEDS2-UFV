Legs scream at bikes and bikes scream at trucks  
And motorists curse their lousy luck  
Crossing guards not doing his job  
And traffics not about to stop for the first causality  
Of though its the rules its the rules  
Super farmers bent on the cover of Time  
The moralist screams hes all mine  
So the bard isnt doing her job the vacuum night  
The darkest rites the small quarantined thoughts  
Its the rules its the rules  
Salesman says this vacuums guaranteed it  
Could suck an ancient virus from the sea  
It could put the dog out of a job  
Could make the traffic stop so little thoughts can safely get across  
Its the rules its the rules  
Guaranteed or not its the rules
