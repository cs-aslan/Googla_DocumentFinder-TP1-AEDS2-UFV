People polishing guns  
Theyve got nothing better to do  
Though they think theyre having fun  
Theyre just living to die if they but knew  
Now now  
  
All day long they sit at home  
Waiting for the milk to come  
Watch them turn into stone  
Thinking bout the things they might have done  
Now now  
  
You missed the point you missed the point  
You really missed the point  
  
Everybodys got to know  
Loves the reason were here  
No matter which way you go  
Loves gonna meet you there  
  
Killing time killing time  
Killing time killing time  
  
You missed the point you really missed the point  
Made me cry I wonder why why  
You missed the point you missed the point  
You really missed the point
