One two one two three  
Well I went and gave away my TV  
Told the man Cut off the phone  
I put an ad in the paper baby gonna sell everything I own  
Done everything in the world I know to try to make it through  
But theres just no getting over you  
Well I went and bought myself a new straw hat  
One eye pokin under the brim I bought myself a little seaside shack  
In case I might just want to swim  
Done everything I know in the world to try to shake these blues  
But theres just no getting over you  
Well I try and try but honey it aint no use  
Cry and cry I just cant turn you loose  
Why oh why cant I get you off my mind  
You got that hook so far in baby I gotta get you off my line  
Well I got some transcendental meditation baby  
And Im taking up Japanese I signed up at the cooking school  
Im going to pick up on some hard cuisine  
Done everything in the world I know to try to make it through  
But theres just no getting over you  
Honey I I tried and I tried baby it aint no use  
Cried and I cried but I just cant turn you loose  
Why oh why cant I get you off my mind  
Honey you got that hook so far in I just got to get you off my line  
Oh I have much and Im a fool for you baby lay back in stand on  
Now listen to this Incomprehensible  
You know the way you do honey  
Well I just cant make it over cant seem to make it baby  
No matter what I say or do baby I cant make it over ooh  
Well theres just no getting over you thats a truth
