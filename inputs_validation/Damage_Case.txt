Hey babe dont act so scared  
All I want is some special care  
Im on the run from some institution  
All I wants a little consolation  
And I can tell by your face  
Im a total disgrace  
Let me inside your place  
Move over for a damage case  
  
Hey babe wait a minute stop  
Dont run away dont call the cop  
I aint looking to victimize you  
All I want to do is tantalize you  
And I can tell by your state  
Im all over the place  
I can tell by your face  
Got no time for a damage case  
  
Hey babe dont turn away  
Im here tomorrow Im gone today  
I dont care what you think your game is  
I dont care even what your name is  
And I can tell by your face  
Youre all over this place  
Let me inside your face  
Move over for a damage case
