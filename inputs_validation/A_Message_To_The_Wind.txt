I saw a moonlit scene I never will forget  
I stole a kiss at daybreak I never did regret it  
Sometimes I wonder why I even try  
So why should I feel blue  
I heard the sound of footsteps swaying in the dark  
I poked my head out silent thats how it started  
What to my eyes appeared as dust  
Became a vision I dont know  
What had finally found me with my back against the wall  
Was destiny intruding all around me  
And as the day wore on I knew  
Another lonely night could never be  
If theres is a reason you might try and forget  
Id like to find it cause I like to relive it  
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry  
So why should I feel blue  
I was caught drifting disappearing from the land  
Whitecaps in profusion all around me  
But somehow in our eyes I found the strength  
To sail upon the raging sea  
If theres a reason for the way that life is  
Id like to find it after all whos life is it  
Sometimes I wonder why I even try  
So why should I feel blue  
What had finally found me with my back against the wall  
Was destiny intruding all around me  
And as the days wore on I knew  
Another lonely night with you could never be  
I saw a moonlit scene I know it was real  
All that you can ever do when love is reveal  
Sometimes I every try why I even try  
So why should I feel blue  
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry  
So why should I feel blue
