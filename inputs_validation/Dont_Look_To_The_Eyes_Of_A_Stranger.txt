Dont look to the eyes of a stranger  
Dont look trough the eyes of a fool  
Dont look to the eyes of a stranger  
Somebodys watching when the light goes down  
  
Dont look to the eyes of a stranger  
Dont look trough the eyes of a fool  
Dont look to the eyes of a stranger  
Somebodys watching when the night comes down  
  
Feel someones watching you  
You gotta get away  
Is it the first time  
Youve ever felt this scared  
  
Feel the adrenaline pump  
Your heart begins to race  
Begin to run now  
The sweat runs down your face  
  
Dont know which way to turn  
Youd better hide yourself  
Hes getting closer now  
Youd better improvise  
  
Just hope you never reach  
The point of no return  
Could be the last time  
You see the light of day  
  
Dont look to the eyes of a stranger  
Dont look trough the eyes of a fool  
Dont look to the eyes of a stranger  
Somebodys watching when the night goes down  
  
Dont look to the eyes of a stranger  
Dont look trough the eyes of a fool  
Dont look to the eyes of a stranger  
Somebodys watching when the light goes down  
  
Dont look to Dont look to  
Dont look to the eyes of a stranger  
  
Dont look to the eyes of a stranger  
Dont look through the eyes of a fool  
Dont look to the eyes of a stranger  
Somebodys watching when the light goes down  
  
Dont look to the eyes of a stranger
