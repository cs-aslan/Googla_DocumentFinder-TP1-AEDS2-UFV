In these moments moments of our lives  
All the world is ours and this world is so right  
You and I sharing this time together ohh  
Sharing the same dream  
As time goes by we will find  
  
These are the special times times well remember  
These are the precious times  
The tender times well hold in our hearts forever  
These are the sweetest times these times together  
And through it all one thing will always be true  
The special times are the times I share with you  
  
Mmm oh yeah  
  
With each moment moment passing by  
Well make memories that will last our lives  
As you and I travel through time together ooh ooh yeah  
Living this sweet dream  
And every day we can say
