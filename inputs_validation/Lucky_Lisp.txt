When your gift unfurls  
When your talent becomes apparent  
I will roar from the stalls  
I will gurgle from the circle  
The saints smile shyly  
Down on you  
Oh they couldnt get over  
Your nineleaf clover  
  
Oh lucky lisp was not wasted on you  
Lucky lisp wasnt wasted on you  
  
When your names with the best  
Will my name be on your guest list  
And I will roar from the stalls  
Ooh the balcony fool was me you fool  
Jesus made this all for you love you love  
He couldnt get over  
Your Grandmas omen  
Oh lucky lisp was not wasted on you  
Lucky lisp wasnt wasted on you
