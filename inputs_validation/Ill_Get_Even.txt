Im lonely and abandoned  
Washed up left for dead  
Im lost inside the desert  
Of every word you said  
Like a nuclear reactor  
Or TNT  
Im thinking about the times  
When you lied to me  
All the innuendo  
Caught up on your hook  
I was just a name  
In your little black book  
Ah Ill get even with you  
Im bitter and Im twisted  
I havent slept in days  
Im lonely and Im angry  
I cant make it go away  
Im like a bomb thats ticking  
I got voices in my head  
I got a doll with needles in  
Wishing you were dead  
Ill get you back somehow  
Thats what Im gonna do  
Ill get you back somehow  
Your nightmare coming true  
Ah Ill get even with you  
Ah thats what Im gonna do  
Gonna get even with you  
You better look behind you  
Cause there Im gonna be  
Ill be standing in the shadows  
With who I used to be  
Hes slightly schizophrenic  
Me and me and me and me agree  
That you are gonna pay  
For what you did to me  
Ah Ill get even with you  
Gonna get even with you  
Ah thats what Im gonna do  
Im gonna  
Ah Ill get even with you
