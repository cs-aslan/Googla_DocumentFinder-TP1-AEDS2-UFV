Theres sexy boys in every city but their not what I want  
Some got money some got fame some got cars and the clothes  
But if it just aint you then I dont wanna know

When I said I didnt need you so  
Miss you bad so now Im coming home  
So you better leave a light on  
Wait for me and just leave the light on  
Ooh  
  
It been like a permanent December  
So much colder then I can remember

Wont ever let you go wont let you go go  
Wont let you go go go go  
Wont let you go no  
Go go go go no no no no
