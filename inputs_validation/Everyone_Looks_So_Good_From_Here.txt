In a deep breath it all starts to change  
Flip my world inside out honestly I like it better this way  
When I mesh the night through the back of my eyes  
  
I have put myself here  
Im the culprit  
I am the culprit  
  
Ive been swallowed up alive  
Shut down  
Building from the inside out  
I can finally walk through the walls  
  
I swear Ive slipped right through the cracks in the floor  
Its so easy when its pulling me under  
  
Now I can see things from the outside  
And I will sit here with no place in mind  
  
I cant escape from this place this is so familiar to me  
  
I can hear the unsatisfying silence  
My mouth is open but none of you can hear me
