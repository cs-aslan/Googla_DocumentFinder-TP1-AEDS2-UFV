If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
Id take back those words thatve hurt you  
And youd stay  
  
I dont know why I did the things I did  
I dont know why I said the things I said  
Prides like a knife it can cut deep inside  
Words are like weapons they wound sometimes  
I didnt really mean to hurt you  
I didnt wanna see you go  
I know I made you cry but baby  
  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
Id take back those words thatve hurt you  
And youd stay  
If I could reach the stars  
Id give them all to you  
And youd love me love me like you used to do  
  
If I could turn back time  
My world was shattered I was torn apart  
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart  
When you walked out that door I swore that I didnt care  
But I lost everything darlin then and there  
Too strong to tell you I was sorry  
Too proud to tell you I was wrong  
I know I was blind and darlin  
  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
Id take back those words thatve hurt you  
And youd stay  
If I could reach the stars  
Id give them all to you  
And youd love me love me like you used to do  
  
If I could turn back time  
If I could turn back time  
If I could turn back time  
Oh baby  
  
I didnt really mean to hurt you  
I didnt wanna see you go  
I know I made you cry but  
  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
Id take back those words that hurt you  
If I could reach the stars  
Id give them all to you  
And youd love me love me like you used to do  
  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
And maybe maybe maybe youd stay  
If I could reach the stars  
Id give them all to you
