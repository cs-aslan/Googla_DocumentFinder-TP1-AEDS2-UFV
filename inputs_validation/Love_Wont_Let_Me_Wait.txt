I need to have you next to me in more ways than one  
And I refuse to leave till I see the mornin sun  
  
The time is right you hold me tight  
And loves got me high  
Please tell me Yes and dont say No  
Honey not tonight  
  
Move a little close to me you owe it to yourself  
And I will selfishly take a little for myself  
And its because of you  
That love wont let me wait  
  
Yeah yeah  
  
The time is right turn down the lights  
And take my hand ooh ooh yeah  
Well take a flight and spend the night  
In wonderland  
  
And I need to have you next to me in more ways than one  
And I refuse to leave till I see the mornin sun  
Creep through your window pane  
Because love wont let me wait  
Not another minute  
  
Ooh ooh ooh yeah yeah  
  
And I need your love so desperately and only you can set me free  
When I make to you well explode in ecstasy  
And I wont take the blame  
That love wont let me wait
