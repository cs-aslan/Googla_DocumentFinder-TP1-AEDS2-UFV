Im ready to be happy  
Ive been down too long  
Its time to rise above it all  
I put a big smile across my face as  
I walk down joy street yeah  
Follow me if you can  
But leave all the burdens behind  
Dont look to the past  
Itll make you pasteristik  
Look to the future  
Itll make you futuristik  
Hey mister Hey sir  
Dont open that cupboard  
I dont want no skeletons falling out  
I dont want no bones falling out  
I dont want my past  
Catching up with me  
Cause I m happy oh  
  
Chorus  
Let sleeping dogs lie  
  
I see two men in the street  
Holding hands and kissing  
The other one looks  
The other one smiles  
When the other one smiles  
The other one blushes  
I didnt want to know  
Whats going on  
As long as they re happy  
I don t want to look up to politicians  
They re gonna feed me  
Political bull  
And I will have  
Political diarrhea  
Dont look to the past  
Itll make you pasteristik  
Don t look it up  
Me just made it up  
Look to the future  
Itll make you futuristik  
Hey mister Hey sir  
Dont open that cupboard  
I dont want no bones falling out  
  
Chorus
