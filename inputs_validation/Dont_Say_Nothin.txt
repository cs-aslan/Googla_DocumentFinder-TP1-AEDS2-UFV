Yo  
When I released my first single back in like 86  
People was like oh you know thats popcorn and you know they weak  
You know then I mess around I go world trade on them  
Bangin out them multiplastic still got negativity to bring  
My thing is you cant say nothing nice dont say nothing  
  
Take your place allow me to flex a taste  
As my accomplishments bring up my comp like mase  
Face me the star of stage and TV  
My face be seen in almost every country  
  
Grammy winner soon to be oscar nominee  
Who he thats dressed jiggy straight from west Philly  
Thought I was whack cause I wanted to act  
Now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that  
  
The ill kid  
Hundred million dollar bill kid  
The one you love to chill with come on keep it real kid  
Dont try to act like this summer at the greek  
  
You wont be bumpin the big Willie in your jeep  
I know yall still feel me  
Really dont act silly  
Thought I feel off just becuase I left Philly  
  
Took a break from the rap thing went on hiatus  
I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers  
I chilled on silk sofas chatting with Operah  
She asked me if its true that me and Jeff broke up  
  
While yall kids busy playing drug pimp and playa  
I was at my crib in Barbados chillin with Jada  
Vertex is me the magnanamous  
God you sayin damn Ive always been a fan of his  
  
Yall know how it is oh wait hold up yall dont  
Look here yall dont say nothing than I wont  
  
Just dont say nothing  
  
Man I love being me ready to rock the block  
With some more hot top notch  for you to cop  
No more mr nice guy  
My whole life Ive been smiling when I felt like whiling  
  
Jealousy swinging on me made his attack  
he soft he whack man that aint real rap  
You believe that  
It hurt me at first but its cool  
  
Took the insults feed it to my ego for fuel  
Now everywhere I turn a dead end  
Hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens  
And they be screaming out  
  
oh my lord  
Did you see its that brother from  
ID4  
Now can I please get  
  
a picture and your signature  
Sure you can miss  
oh my god my girlfriends they aint gonna beleive this  
Worldwide wait nah hold up galactic  
  
Hear my name dont nothing change but the accent  
Bangok to Madagascar they wanna see me  
Prince epe in Spain Japan Im cota eshe  
I like my steaks thick and my jets private  
  
And my son to ride in the cockpit  
I know hes only four taking lessons from the pilot  
While Im on my cell with my broker getting stock tips  
Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip  
  
Man whod a thought my life would be such an interesting topic  
Well yall know how it is wait hold up yall dont  
Well look here yall dont say nothing than I wont  
  
Just dont say nothing  
Just dont say nothing  
Just dont say nothing  
Just dont say nothing  
  
Go ahead adjust the balance and the bass in your speakers  
Make sure my voice sounding crisp in your tweeters  
Im about to show you how a man like me works  
Shorty get ice five carrots and nothing cheaper  
  
Four five chromed out former two seater  
Fifty inch sony to watch Siskel and Ebert  
Cause Im about to get two thumbs ten toes one knee and probobly a couple  
Of elbows  
  
Cause yo Im the man and the whole world knows  
Rock film fests to vos and rap shows  
All the critics jealous people and backstabbers  
My socalled friends who been nothing but actors  
  
Youre way of charachter but now whos the bomb  
Its Will from west Phil just slightly transformed  
Yall know what it is  
Ah damn thats right yall dont  
But look here yall dont say nothing then trust me I wont  
  
Just dont say nothing  
Just dont say nothing  
Just dont say nothing  
Just dont say nothing
