My heart youre breakin my heart  
Girl you better start thinkin somethin real  
Seems like loving you is just a crazy dream  
But do as you feel  
All these crazy women  
One more crazy night  
But one nights all were given  
So baby leave me alone or baby stay the night  
oh women in love  
Oh baby make up your mind  
make up your mind  
I know youre in love  
So baby make up your mind  
Scream go on and scream that your love is all youre  
Knowin  
But honey if youre needing a woman just as bad as me  
You ought to be goin  
All these crazy women  
One more crazy night  
But one nights all were given  
So baby leave me alone or baby stay the night  
oh women in love  
Oh baby make up your mind  
make up your mind  
I know youre in love  
So baby make up your mind
