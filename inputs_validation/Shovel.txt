Meant to refuse  
But just smash the whole gate down  
Tried for the truth  
But just lied when it really mattered  
  
Anywhere  
That your going  
Anytime  
That you feel like  
Should have been there  
Should have spoken  
Tell me theres nowhere youre going  
  
If you only faced it when  
Then you  
Decide to  
Finally make it in  
Its over  
Its breaking  
  
In case thats all  
That you want  
Unprotected  
Kept it all hidden  
Its safe from you  
Thats what matters  
  
Anywhere  
That your going  
Anytime  
That you feel like  
Should have been there  
Should have spoken  
Tell me theres no way of knowing  
  
If you only faced it when  
Then you  
Decide to  
Finally make it in  
Its over  
Its breaking  
Its broken  
  
Adjusting nothing  
You get just what you pay for  
Believe in anything  
Another stab in the back that you let go  
Dont know how to react now you dont know  
Swear up and down this is the last time you will getburned
