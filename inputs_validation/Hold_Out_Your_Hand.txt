All men with stars upon the chest  
Save yourselves your family  
Dont worry bout the rest  
Small child receives light through the crack  
The human mile theyre never coming back  
Hold out your hand and ask for some  
Now and again she sits beneath the tree  
The sign above reads  
Hard work will set you free  
Hold out your hand and ask for some  
Too late for another direction  
Always what weve got in store  
Hurry back weve all been waiting  
We cant take much anymore  
Where are the days where brothers are brothers  
A childless mother  
Leave it except for one
