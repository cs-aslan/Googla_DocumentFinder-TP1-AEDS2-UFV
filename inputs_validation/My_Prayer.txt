When the twilight is gone and no songbirds are singing  
When the twilight is gone you come into my heart  
And here in my heart you will stay while I pray  
My prayer is to linger with you  
  
At the end of the day in a dream thats divine  
My prayer is a rapture in blue with the world far away  
And your lips close to mine  
Tonight while our hearts are aglow  
  
Oh Why dont you to tell me the words that Im longing to know  
My prayer and the answer you give  
May they still be the same for as long as we live  
That youll always be there  
At the end of my prayer
