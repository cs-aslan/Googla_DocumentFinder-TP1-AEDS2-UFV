Everybody groove to the music  
Everybody jam weve been waiting so long  
Just cant hold it back no more  
Creepin up and down now  
Its time for me to let it go  
If you really wanna see  
What we can do for you  
Send the crazy wildin static sing it  
Jam cause Backstreets got it  
Come now everybody  
Weve go it goin on for years  
Jam cause Backstreets got it  
Come now everybody  
Weve go it goin on for years  
Well Im creepin up on your left  
Straight up funky when I get with you  
I get ruthless when I get wet  
Keep the party packed in my corner  
Tough like to keep the crowd hype  
Get up on this just to get right  
What you want is what youre gonna get  
Backstreets got the special effects  
If you really wanna see  
What we can do for you  
Send the crazy wildin static sing it  
Jam cause Backstreets got it  
Come now everybody  
Weve go it goin on for years  
Weve got it going on for years  
Weve been waiting so long  
Just cant hold it back no more  
Creepin up and down now  
Its time for me to let it go  
Jam cause Backstreets got it  
Come now everybody  
Weve go it goin on for years
