Im sick and tired of you calling me names  
Im sick and tired of your childish games  
Im sick and tired of your bullshit brats  
Cocaine stupor and anxiety attacks  
  
Picked up the magazine I see your face  
Youre nothin boy a goddamn waste  
With the lamest fashions on your back  
Youre never happy a hypochondriac  
  
Dont bust my chops baby dont bust my chops  
Yeah  
  
Youre a styling queen and an alley cat  
Too many chocolates keep a fat man fat  
Youre a pain in the ass and your on the loose  
All I get from you is your bad attitude  
  
Dirty mouth its all I can bear  
Get outta here bitch cause youre nowhere  
Always wearin that cheap perfume  
Can always tell when youre in the room  
  
Dont bust my chops baby dont bust my chops  
Ah  
  
Dont bust my chops baby dont bust my chops  
Alright
