I think to myself when we kiss  
Your husband is watching  
From his portrait his eyes are looking down  
On the slipper and stocking  
Back against the bookcase  
Down upon the floor  
Empty the decanter  
Slur again for more  
His house her home our future in a lovers world  
Her son her heart her love for me tomorrows world  
  
I laugh at myself when your son  
Is watching cartoons  
In the morning hes looking up at me  
When were in the bathroom  
Sees me kissing mother  
Doesnt blink an eye  
Asks a lot of questions  
Answers hard to find  
  
I talk to myself when Im drunk  
And she is still sober  
Words are so few and far between  
My arms reach to hold her  
Hungry for the love  
I rescued from the grave  
The past is just a portrait  
The futures ours to frame
