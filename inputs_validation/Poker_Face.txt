I wanna hold em like they do in Texas plays  
Fold em let em hit me raise it baby stay with me I love it  
Love Game intuition play the cards with spades to start  
And after hes been hooked Ill play the one thats on his heart

A little gambling is fun when youre with me I love it  
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun  
And baby when its love if its not rough it isnt fun fun
