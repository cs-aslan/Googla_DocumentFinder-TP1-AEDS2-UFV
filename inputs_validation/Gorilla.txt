Oh I got a bottle full of liquor with a cocaine  
Kicker and Im feeling like Im thirty feet tall  
So lay it down lay it down  
You got your legs up in the sky with the devil in your eyes  
Let me hear you say you want it all  
Say it now say it now  
  
Look what you doing look what you done  
But in this jungle you cant run  
Cause what I got for you  
I promise is a killer youll be banging on my chest  
Bang bang gorilla  
  
Ooh ooh ooh yeah you and me baby making love like gorillas  
Ooh ooh ooh yeah you and me baby making love like gorillas  
  
Yeah I got a fistful of your hair  
But you dont look like youre scared  
Youre just smiling tell me daddy its yours  
Cause you know how I like it use a dirty little lover  
If the neighbors call the cops call the sheriff  
Call the swat we dont stop  
We keep rocking while they knocking on our door  
And youre screaming give it to me baby  
Give it to me motherfucker  
  
Oh look what you doing look what you done  
But in this jungle you cant run  
Cause what I got for you  
I promise is a killer youll be banging on my chest  
Bang bang gorilla  
  
Ooh ooh ooh yeah you and me baby making love like gorillas  
Ooh ooh ooh yeah you and me baby making love like gorillas  
  
I bet you never ever felt so good so good  
I got your body trembling like it should it should  
Youll never be the same baby once Im done with you  
  
Oh you with me baby making love like gorillas  
Ooh ooh ooh yeah you and me baby well be fuckin it like gorillas  
Ooh ooh ooh yeah  
You and me baby making love like gorillas
