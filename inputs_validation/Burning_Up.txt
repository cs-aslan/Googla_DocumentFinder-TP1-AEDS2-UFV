Shaggy 2 Dope  
All walks of life up in here tonight baby  
Verse  Violent J  
This bitch Rashell fucked on her boyfriend in her boyfriends bed  
And Crazy Carlos smacked his baby mama off in the head  
And Jonathan beat his son like his daddy beat him  
But swore hed never do nobody like his daddy did him  
And then Sandra used her pussyhole to get to the top  
And Baby D he shot somebody it went bad from the drop  
And then Diane worked at a hospital took care of old souls  
She was abusive her afterlife sees no gold roads  
And Mr Richards was a richie fella born with every penny  
Everyone around him hungry but he never gave em any  
And then Steven was a businessman an educated citizen at the top  
Pornography of children in his laptop  
Take your spot and hang on cause its crowded in hell  
You in the belly of the beast now it was Heaven in jail  
And dont try to make no friends cause dont nobody got no tongues  
If the Witch look your way somehow it crushes your lungs  
Verse  Violent J  
Playa Playa was a boss man callin out shots  
Til he caught one then everything stops the floor drops  
As hes screamin and fallin we see how pointless was the ballin  
When eternity is callin agony will be appallin  
Dont cry for the dead cause they cry for you  
Because we laugh about an aftermath but they know how true  
And listen aint nofuckinbody gettin it worse than you and me  
And aint nobody gettin it worse than you and me and we will see  
A pterodactyl swoop through the caverns of Hell  
And carry 2 unfortunates off to the Ogres cell  
It aint no guards playin cards aint no uniforms needed  
You the only one around buttnaked bloody and bleedin  
With 7 demons in your ear got you believin your heathen  
Talk you into pulling out your own intestines to get even  
You were born with the shine but you lost it down the line  
You fucked life up and you cant rewind

Verse  Violent J  
Judge Shaw was a judge snake holes are his eyes  
There go anohter judge another judge somebody despise  
And there go so many judges the judges in Hell  
So many fuckin judges in Hell they bludgeon em well  
Fat Pat like his daddy was a bigot pullin duty  
He can tell it to them gargoyles fuckin on his booty  
And Shawna liked money but mistook it for love  
Now when the Witchs wings spread she give him head and look above  
Black Sundays Armageddon maggots and rape  
Hells Pit got some fire for you faggots with hate  
Eddie Burrow hit his wife and put a tooth in his knuckle  
Later on he lost his life in a scuffle now he in trouble  
You was a rebel you nobody no mo  
To the Devil on the double you go  
Aint no level to the trouble you know  
And eternity goesand eternity goes
