Slipping down a slide  
I did enjoy the ride  
Dont know what to decide  
You lied to me  
You looked me in the eye  
It took me by surprise  
Now are you gratified  
You cried to me  
La la la la la  
Dont turn around  
Im sick and Im tired of your face  
Dont make this worse  
Youve already gone and got me mad  
Its too bad Im not sad  
Its casting over  
Its just one of those things  
Youll have to get over it  
When I was feeling down  
Youd start to hang around  
And then I found your hands all over me  
And that was out of bounds  
You filthy rotten hound  
Its better than it sounds believe me  
La la la la la  
Dont turn around  
Im sick and Im tired of your face  
Dont make this worse  
Youve already gone and got me mad  
Its too bad Im not sad  
Its casting over  
Its just one of those things  
Youll have to get over it  
Hey you gotta get over it  
Hey you gotta get over it  
Its too bad Im not sad  
Its casting over  
Its just one of those things  
Youll have to get over it  
Dont turn around  
Im sick and Im tired of your face  
Dont make this worse  
Youve already gone and got me mad  
Dont turn around  
Im sick and Im tired of your face  
Dont make this worse  
Youve already gone and got me mad  
Its too bad Im not sad  
Its casting over  
Its just one of those things  
Youll have to get over it  
Youll have to get over it
