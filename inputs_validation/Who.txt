Chorus  
Who stole my heart away  
Who makes me dream all day  
Dreams I know can never come true  
Seems as though Ill ever be blue  
Who means my happiness  
Who would I answer yes to  
No one but you  
  
A womans intentions her famine inventions  
A seldom if ever defined  
And I am no different why should I be different  
I simply cant make up my mind  
How can I solve this situation  
Except by the process of elimination  
  
Chorus  
  
Can it be can it be who can it be  
Youll never guess who has stolen my heart away Dreamin dreams I know  
Can never come true  
  
Seems as though  
Ill never be blue  
Oh who means my happiness  
Who would I answer yes to  
Well you oughta guess who who  
No one but you
