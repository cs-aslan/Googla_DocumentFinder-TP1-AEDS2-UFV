Im sittin here lookin at some mighty hard times money aint growing on
trees  
A little while ago I was rollin in dough singin all you want when you please  
All you want when you please girls all you want when you please  
The wind blows up this road all summer in the evening it cools one and all  
  
If you like a good breeze you can have all you please  
If you dont get blown away in the fall  
All you want when you please girls all you want when you please  
  
My moneys all gone and my breeze died down my bloom of youths gone to seed  
I sit here and cry for the days all gone by when I sang all you want when you
please  
All you want when you please girls all you want when you please  
Well the meats all lean and the breads all done  
  
And the cook rides a big white horse  
You just come like you look and if you get your picture took  
You can tell em you was at the Mardi Gras  
All you want when you please girls all you want when you please
