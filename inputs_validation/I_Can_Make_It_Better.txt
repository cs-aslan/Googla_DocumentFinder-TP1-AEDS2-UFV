Well once again my love  
Its time for you to go  
No need to explain anything  
I know I know I know  
  
This is the end of the road  
Its the parting of the ways  
And theres not much left for us to say  
  
You keep telling me hes no good for you  
You said you were gonna change your lock  
You told me if he bothers you again baby  
Hell be dancing to the Jailhouse Rock  
Put him away baby  
Make him understand  
Tell him his game is over  
And then when you cry Ill be your shoulder  
  
Whatever youre going through  
I can make it better  
No one should be making you feel like you do  
I can make it better  
Oh baby baby  
Dont be a link in his chain  
Tell him you want to be free you want to love me  
Dont let him get in the way  
  
For every one time that he gives you pleasure  
Ten times he makes you wanna cry  
You spend every night with the toss and the turn baby  
And wonder why in the world oh why  
How in the world can you get any sleep  
Every one knows the way that he creeps  
Its time for the question baby  
What has he done for you lately no  
  
Whenever you want me to  
I can make it better  
I just need this one chance to prove it to you  
I can make it better  
Ooo baby baby  
Dont be a pawn in his game  
Go head and tell him its over tell him to go  
Or darling its just a shame  
  
Better for you is better for me  
Lets fall in love Ill make you see  
Better for you is better for me baby  
Lets fall in love Ill make you Ill make you see  
  
Never again will you hear a lie  
Never again will you wanna cry  
never oh no will there be a tear drop in your eye  
Stop all this madness in the name of love  
Tell him to leave cuz enough is enough  
Let him go baby save your love for me  
Tell him youve found somebody  
Wholl give you the love that you just wont believe
