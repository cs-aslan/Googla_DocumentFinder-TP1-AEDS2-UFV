Sun turnin round with graceful motion  
Were setting off with soft explosion  
Bound for a star with fiery oceans  
Its so very lonely youre a hundred light years from home  
  
Freezing red deserts turn to dark  
Energy here in every part  
Its so very lonely youre six hundred light years from home  
  
Its so very lonely youre a thousand light years from home  
Its so very lonely youre a thousand light years from home  
  
Bell flight fourteen you now can land  
Seen you on Aldebaran safe on the green desert sand  
Its so very lonely youre two thousand light years from home  
Its so very lonely youre two thousand light years from home
