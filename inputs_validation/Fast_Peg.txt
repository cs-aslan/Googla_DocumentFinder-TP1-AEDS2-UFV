Yeah  
Funky Uh  
Yeah  
Yo let me tell you bout a girl named Peg  
A DC haircut and stewardess legs  
Dressed to kill her physique is ill  
Her face belongs on a dollar bill  
Her boyfriends down with the MObe  
Driving around in a 300e  
Trunk jewelry and all that  
Talking bout My man cant fall black  
Sipping on cham diamonds on her hand  
Taking cash carrying drugs for her man  
Driving around in a kitted up Jetta  
Under the seat a automatic Beretta  
You know the whole blase blah of rap  
Telling brothers they need to get off the brastrap  
Thats the type of girl she is  
Word to Miz she got the  
Full length blue fox knock you out the box  
Big rocks this girl is hype Hobbes  
The type of girl that cold did son wrong  
She got the face that you want to spend money on  
Her man be smacking her up  
Yeah backing her up  
To the wall get undressed where you going  
You aint playing me out with that hoeing  
Look in the mirror check the jewels  
Silly rabbit you know the rules  
But he had to leave on another deal  
So shes out there with sex appeal  
Its the weekend time for freaking shes sneaking  
Outside telling her home girls we can  
Do the do with whoever we want to  
Cause were the fly girl crew  
Not knowing her man messed up the money  
Riding around thinking everythings funny  
Went in a disco came outside  
Somebody pushed her in a beat up ride  
She had to pay for her mans mistakes  
They shot her in the head  
Thats the breaks
