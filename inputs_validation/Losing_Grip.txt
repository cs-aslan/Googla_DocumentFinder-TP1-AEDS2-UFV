Are you aware of what  
You make me feel baby  
Right now I feel invisible to you  
Like Im not real  
Didnt you feel me lock my arms around you  
Whyd you turn away  
Heres what I have to say  
  
I was left to cry there  
Waiting outside there  
Grinning with the lost stare  
Thats when I decided  
  
Why should I care  
Cause you werent there  
When I was scared  
I was so alone  
  
You you need to listen  
Im startin to trip  
Im losing my grip  
And Im in this thing alone  
oh oh yeah  
  
Am I just some chick  
You placed beside you  
To take somebodys place  
When you turn around  
  
Can you recognize my face  
You used to love me  
You used to hug me  
But that wasnt the case  
Everything wasnt ok  
  
I was left to cry there  
Waiting outside there  
Grinning with a lost stare  
Thats when I decided  
  
Why should I care  
Cause you werent there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
You you need to listen  
Im starting to trip  
Im losing my grip  
And Im in this thing alone  
  
Crying out loud  
Im crying out loud  
Crying out loud  
Im crying out loud  
Open your eyes  
Open up wide  
  
Why should I care  
Cause you werent there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
Why should I care  
  
Cause you werent there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
Why should I care  
If you dont care then I dont care  
  
Were not going anywhere  
Why should I care  
Cause you werent there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
  
Why should I care  
If you dont care then I dont care  
Were not going anywhere
