Like a horse and rider Like a horse and rider  
Like a midnight flyer Like a midnight flyer  
Im coming to you coming to you  
And theres nothing pretty baby that I wouldnt rather do  
Look outside your window look into the night  
Hold on to your heart now darling Ill be there in the morning light
