Well who do you think youre foolin  
You say youre havin fun  
But youre busy going nowhere  
Just lying in the sun  
You tried to be a hero  
Commit the perfect crime  
But the dollar got you dancing  
And youre running out of time  
Youre messin up the water  
Youre rolling in the wine  
Youre poisoning your body  
Youre poisoning your mind  
You gave me cocacola  
You said it tasted good  
You watch the television  
If it tell you that you should  
  
How can you live in this way  
Why do you think its so strange  
You must have something to say  
Tell me why should I change  
There must me more to this life  
Its finally we did something right  
Child of Vision wont you listen  
Find yourself a new ambition  
  
Ive heard it all before  
Youre saying nothing new  
I thought I saw a rainbow  
But I guess it wasnt true  
You cannot make me listen  
And you cannot make you hear  
You find your way to heaven  
Ill meet you when youre there  
  
How can you live in this way  
Why do you think its so strange  
You must have something to say  
Tell me why should I change  
We have no reason to fight  
Cause we both know that were right Because  
Child of vision wont you listen  
Find yourself a new ambition
