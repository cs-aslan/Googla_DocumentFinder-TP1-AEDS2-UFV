Im ready to go  
Its creeping along  
A deep lack of guilt  
And fools sense of love  
You can say its nothing  
You can claim theres noone to hide  
You could be respectable and keep it to yourself  
Cause we know that she was the best that youve had  
Yes I know she was the best that youve had  
Greased and unclean  
A hiss laid by God  
A duped bridle hole  
And a boyhood slipping in Blood  
You can say its nothing  
You can claim theres noone to hide  
You could be respectable and keep it to yourself at least  
Cause we know that she was the best that youve had  
Yes I know she was the best that youve had  
V you L T you are E  P I A N O  
You can say its nothing  
You can claim theres noone to hide  
You could be respectable and keep it to yourself at least  
Cause we know that she was the best that youve had  
Yes I know she was the best that youve had
