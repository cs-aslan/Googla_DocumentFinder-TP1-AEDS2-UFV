If anyone rises at 631  
And fakes all day that theyre having their fun  
They never did get it right  
Since they got it so low  
  
To anyone drinking the morning away  
The afternoon will prove a mistake  
They never will get it right  
Now theyve got it so low  
  
Chorus  
And we laugh and we drink  
And we teach ourselves not to think  
We never did get it right  
Since we got it so low  
  
To all of the faces that freeze for you there  
In your memory when you try not to care  
They never disappear down the slow road  
  
For all of those people who bleed by the side  
And split from their tongues  
And sharpen their knives  
They never will get a life  
Now theyve got it so low  
  
Chorus  
  
Cornfields and pigtails and fish in the stream  
The night when the boys stole the billion dollar dream  
From the highjinx school for girls  
Down the road  
  
Stories are smoke trails  
And some may be true  
Youre listening to me  
But Im talking to you  
I hope you never fall from grace  
If you get it so low  
  
Chorus  
  
And we laugh and we drink  
And we find it hard not to think  
We never did get it right  
Since we got it so low
