I never felt more like singing the blues cause I never thought that Id ever
lose  
Your love dear whyd you do me this way  
I never felt more like crying all night cause everythings wrong and nothing
aint right  
Without you you got me singing the blues  
  
The moon and stars no longer shine the dream is gone I thought was mine  
Theres nothing left for me to do but cry over you  
I never felt more like running away but why should I go cause I couldnt stay  
Without you you got me singing the blues  
  
I never felt more like singing the blues
