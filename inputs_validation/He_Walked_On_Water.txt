He wore starched white shirts buttoned at the neck  
And hed sit in the shade and watch the chickens peck  
And his teeth were gone but what the heck  
I thought that he walked on water  
  
He said he was a cowboy when he was young  
He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun  
And my mamas daddy was his oldest son  
And I thought that he walked on water  
  
Chorus  
If the storys told only heaven knows  
But his hat seemed to me like an old halo  
And although his wings they were never seen  
I thought that he walked on water  
  
Then he tied a cord to the end of a mop  
And said son heres a pony keep her at a trot  
And Id ride in circles while he laughed a lot  
Then Id flop down beside him  
  
And he was ninety years old in sixtythree  
And I loved him and he loved me  
And lord I cried the day he died  
  
Cause I thought that he walked on water  
  
Chorus
