If I dont see you through the week  
See you through the window  
See you next time that were talking on the telephone  
And if I dont see you in that Indian summer  
Then I want to see you further on up the road  
  
I said oh wont you come back  
I have to see you my dear  
Want you come back in the Celtic New Year  
In the Celtic New Year  
  
If I dont see you when Im going down Louisiana  
If I dont see you when Im down on Bourbon Street  
If you dont see me when Im singing Jack of Diamonds  
If you dont see me when Im on my lucky streak  
  
Woa I want you want you to come on back  
Ive made it very clear  
I want you to come back home in the Celtic New Year  
Celtic New Year  
  
If I dont see you when the bonfires are burning burning  
If I dont see you when were singing the Gloriana tune  
If Ive got to see you when its raining deep inside the forest  
I got to see you at the waning of the moon  
  
Said oh wont you come on back  
Want you to be of good cheer  
Come back home on the Celtic New Year  
  
Celtic New Year Celtic New Year  
Celtic New Year  
In the Celtic New Year  
In the Celtic New Year  
  
Come on home come on home come on home come on home  
In the Celtic New Year
