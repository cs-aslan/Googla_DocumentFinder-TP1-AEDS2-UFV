Theres no more little secrets we havent yet disclosed  
We bore the living daylights of anyone too close  
And all our cards at Christmas are written to us both  
Count them up whos got the most  
  
Said wed be close  
Said wed work perfectly  
Said that wed toast  
Beautiful company  
  
Closer than a sister to her baby brother  
Closer than a cat to the child that shell smother  
Its too close for a lover  
Its too close for a lover  
We are each other  
We are each other  
  
Weve been through all positions and this ones definitely best  
You move Middle East and Ill move Wild West  
What happened to our friendship we could easily have guessed  
Add it up were selfpossessed  
  
Said wed be true  
Said wed be so so proud  
Just me an you  
Wed shout it out aloud  
  
Closer than a sister to her baby brother  
Closer than a cat to the child that shell smother  
Its too close for a lover  
Its too close for a lover  
We are each other  
We are each other  
  
Remember we went shopping and we went by piggyback  
I shaved all my legs and you grew hairs upon your back  
Well noones ever been since to this lovers shack  
Its a culdesac  
  
Said wed be close  
Said wed work perfectly  
Said that wed toast  
Beautiful company  
  
Said wed be true  
Said wed be so so proud  
Just me an you  
Wed shout it out aloud  
  
Closer than a sister to her baby brother  
Closer than a secret agent working under cover  
Its too close for a lover  
Its too close for a lover  
We are each other  
We are each other
