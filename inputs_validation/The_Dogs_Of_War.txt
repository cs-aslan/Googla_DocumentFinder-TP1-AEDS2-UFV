Dogs of war and men of hate  
With no cause we dont discriminate  
Discovery is to be disowned  
Our currency is flesh and bone  
Hell opened up and put on sale  
Gather round and haggle  
For hard cash we will lie and deceive  
Even our masters dont know the web we weave  
  
One world its a battleground  
One world and we will smash it down  
One world one world  
  
Invisible transfers long distance calls  
Hollow laughter in marble halls  
Steps have been taken a silent uproar  
Has unleashed the dogs of war  
You cant stop what has begun  
Signed sealed they deliver oblivion  
We all have a dark side to say the least  
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast  
  
One world its a battleground  
One world and we will smash it down  
One world one world  
  
The dogs of war dont negotiate  
The dogs of war wont capitulate  
They will take and you will give  
And you must die so that they may live  
You can knock at any door  
But wherever you go you know theyve been there before  
Well winners can lose and things can get strained  
But whatever you change you know the dogs remain  
  
One world its a battleground  
One world and we will smash it down  
One world one world
