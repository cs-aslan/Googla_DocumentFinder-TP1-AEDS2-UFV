Read some Kerouac and it put me on the tracks to burn a little brighter now  
Something about roman candles fizzing out shine a little light on me now  
Found a strange fascination with a liquid fixation alcohol can thrill me now  
Its getting late in the game to show any pride or shame  
I just burn a little brighter now burn a little brighter now  
  
Doctor says my liver looks like leaving with my lover need another timeout
now  
Like any sort of hero turning down to zero still standing out in any crowd  
  
Pulling seventeen with experience and dreams sweating out a happy hour  
Where youre hiding 29 you know it aint a crime  
To burn a little brighter now burn a little brighter now  
  
Dr Finlay And my advice is if you maintain this lifestyle  
you wont reach 30  
  
Torch Christ  its a romantic way to go really its part  
of the heritage its your round init  
  
We burn a little brighter now  
  
Read some Kerouac and it put me on the tracks to burn a little brighter now  
It was something about roman candles fizzing out shine a little light on me
now  
Found a strange fascination with a liquid fixation alcohol thrill me now  
Getting late in the game to show any pride or shame  
Burn a little brighter now we burn a little brighter now  
We burn a little brighter now
