Sometimes its hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes its hard to face reality  
  
Dont be afraid to stand alone  
Dont be afraid to stand outside all by yourself  
I know its hard away from home  
It aint easy all alone  
Relationships over the phone  
Talkin to your significant other all night long  
  
Sometimes its hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes its hard to face reality  
  
Pooh Bear  
Shouldve been adjusted to my life  
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time  
Now youre standin right in front of me  
It is mean and though that life  
Try to protect your feelins  
Givin in between the lines  
Hope your heart is totally healed and  
  
Sometimes its hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes its hard to face reality
