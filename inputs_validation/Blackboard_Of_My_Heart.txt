When I was young and went to school they taught me how to write  
To take the chalk and make a mark and hope it turns out right  
Well thats the way it is with love and what you did to me  
I wrote it so youd know that I was yours eternally  
  
Chorus  
But my tears have washed I love you from the blackboard of my heart  
Its too late to clean the slate and make another start  
Im satisfied the way things are although were far apart  
My tears have washed I love you from the blackboard of my heart  
  
If youd been true the way you should and not have gone astray  
These tears would not have fallen down and washed the words away  
No need to talk cause if the chalk should write those words again  
It will be for someone else not things that might have been  
  
Chorus  
But my tears have washed I love you from the blackboard of my heart  
Its too late to clean the slate and make another start  
Im satisfied the way things are although were far apart  
My tears have washed I love you from the blackboard of my heart
