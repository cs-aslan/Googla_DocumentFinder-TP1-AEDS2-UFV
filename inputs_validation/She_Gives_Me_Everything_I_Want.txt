Life aint worth alivin  
People just been givin me  
Friendship happiness is what everybody deserves  
But she gives me everything I want  
  
Oh I dont have to ask for everything I get  
Everyone just lets me down  
Tries to make me look like a fool  
Wont accept me for what I am  
They say I got to live by the rules  
But she gives me everything I want  
  
Oh I dont have to ask for everything I get  
Its gotta end sometime  
Hows it gonna be yeah  
Are we wrong or are we right  
Its gotta end sometime  
Calling you and me yeah  
Its gonna take a long long time  
  
Seems like they dont give a damn  
Wont let me live just how I want  
They say Im a downandout  
But its them thats wrong  
But she gives me everything I want  
  
Oh I dont have to ask for everything I get  
  
Verse 3  
  
Cos she gives me everything I want We dont need nobody else
