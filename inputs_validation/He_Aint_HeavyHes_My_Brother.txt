The road is long  
With many a winding turn  
That leads us to  
Who knows where who knows where  
But Im strong strong enough to carry him  
He aint heavy hes my brother  
  
So on we go  
His welfare is my concern  
No burden is he to bare  
Well get there  
For I know he would not encumber me  
He aint heavy hes my brother  
  
If Im laden at all  
Im laden with sadness  
That everyones heart isnt filled  
With gladness of love for one another  
Its a long long road  
From which there is no return  
While were on our way to there why not share  
And the load  
It doesnt weigh me down at all  
He aint heavy hes my brother  
He aint heavy hes my brother  
Hes my brother hes my brother
