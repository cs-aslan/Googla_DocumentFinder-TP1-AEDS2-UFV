If you aint rhyming Go suck your mammas pussy niggaare chill  
 Shit Got probation  
Dirty did two out of ten I on parole  
And Ima go Cause it caught a violation holy shit  
And this music tells me to like its an occupation  
  
Aint no other one aint no better run aint nowhere to stand  
Hold your money tight  
Running out of time got In disguise the rain is at your  
I wanna see you shinning aint nowhere to run  
  
 Gotta nodest Hard top loaders and Ferrari troopers  
Aint nowhere to run so Im standing here  
No need to panic Ill complain a deal  
Big goosie and this motherfucker what you know

I sell everything if I had the chance  
Since you give him a low one to the  
But its hard to appeal when youre man to please  
 Claiming need  
All greed jealousy

Wanna see me shine  
Gucci Mane And I control the steet  
  
Aint no other one aint no better run aint nowhere to stand  
Hold your money tight  
Running out of time got In disguise the rain is at your  
I wanna see you shinning aint nowhere to run
