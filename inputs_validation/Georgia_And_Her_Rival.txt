Georgie grew to hate her name  
It sounded like a tiny man  
And the one she had said I cant see you  
But Ill call you whenever I can  
  
Sometimes the phone would ring when she was halfasleep  
A voice would drag her down with its suggestions  
Though she often felt cheated  
She never felt cheap  
  
Well heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
Its impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
  
It was halfpast February  
And he hadnt called since New Years Day  
Maybe hed found another woman  
To say those words no chapel girl should say  
  
Her mother would phone and always keep her talking  
Shed try to be polite making faces  
But somewhere in the back of her mind  
Her rival was stalking  
  
Well heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
Its impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
  
Her rival would always wait  
Til the eighth or ninth bell  
Hed be desperate anyway  
And drunk as well  
  
She always liked to hurt him  
To prove he was prepared  
To love her anyway that she wanted  
So she could tell which she preferred  
  
He sat up with his address book  
Trying to think what mood hes in  
His finger traced past Georgies name  
To someone who needed less persuading  
  
He didnt hear through her disguise  
He didnt leave her in a rush  
Just like the promise that he left  
On her machine that almost made her blush  
  
The radio plays a lovers symphony  
The number you have dialed has been redirected  
Now she puts him on the speakerphone  
Whenever she has company  
  
Well heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
Its impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival
