My daddy said  
Son dont you come to me cryin  
Cause money dont make you a happy man  
He said the grass is always greener  
Any place except where you stand  
  
He said some are born to win  
And some born to lose  
And sing them poor boy blues  
  
Watch out  
  
Ive lived uptown downtown  
Lord Ive lived everywhere  
Almost drowned in the puddle of my own sweat I swear  
I believe its due time I get my mansion in ole Bel Air  
  
Chorus  
But Im still singin those poor boy blues  
Poor boy blues  
You dont know how Im feeling baby  
Until youre wearing my shoes  
Sure as Im standing here  
I got them poor boy blues  
  
Friday night I get tanked up  
And tossed in the local slam  
At least I get three square meals  
Until someone gets me out of this jam  
In the meanwhile all my green  
Is going to Uncle Sam  
  
Chorus  
  
Walk this dog  
  
Chorus
