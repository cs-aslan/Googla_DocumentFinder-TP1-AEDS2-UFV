I saw you standing in the corner  
On the edge of a burning light  
I saw you standing in the corner  
Come to me again in the cold cold night  
  
You make me feel a little older  
Like a full grown woman might  
But when youre gone I grow colder  
Come to me again in the cold cold night  
  
I see you walking by my front door  
I hear the creaking of the kitchen floor  
I dont care what other people say  
Im going to love you anyway  
Come to me again in the cold cold night  
  
I cant stand it any longer  
I need the fuel to make my fire burn bright  
So dont fight it any longer  
Come to me again in the cold cold night  
  
And I know that you feel it too  
When my skin turns into glue  
You will know that its warm inside  
And youll come run to me in the cold cold night
