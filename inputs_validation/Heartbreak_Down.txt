I like to think that Im a pretty good kisser  
I like to think I maybe broke a few hearts  
But since I met you Im a victim of disaster  
I like to think I got it down to an art  
  
So heres where the problem starts  
Youre shitting on my heart  
Oh I cant take it  
Again and again and again  
  
All I wanted from you  
Was a night maybe two  
You beat me at my own game  
No its not okay  
Im the one thats missing out  
All I needed to do  
Was get just a taste of you  
And now Im sick all in my head  
You poisoned me instead  
Trust me trust me I think I got heartbreak down  
  
I like to wake and go to bed around whenever  
I like to maybe come and go when I choose  
But now Im waiting for a text call whatever  
Whats gotten into me besides you Oops  
Youre like a rush youre like a drug its just the sight of you  
I like to think that I could kick you but its what you do  
You knew we could be  
Whats the lord think of me  
For being so fucking weak I find it hard for me to breathe  
  
So heres where my story ends  
I got to make amends  
I let me down  
Again and again and again and again  
  
All I wanted from you  
Was a night maybe two  
You beat me at my own game  
No its not okay  
Im the one thats missing out  
All I needed to do  
Was get just a taste of you  
And now Im sick all in my head  
You poisoned me instead  
Trust me trust me I think I got heartbreak down  
  
Heres what we have to do  
Stay together and keep it true  
Cant be strong too late for cool  
I wont live without you  
You are not rid of me  
  
All I wanted from you  
Was a night maybe two  
You beat me at my own game  
No its not okay  
Im the one thats missing out  
All I needed to do  
Was get just a taste of you  
And now Im sick all in my head  
You poisoned me instead  
Trust me trust me I think I got heartbreak down
