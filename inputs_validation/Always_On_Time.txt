When I am lost you were there  
You pulled me through  
And bring me to the right track  
When Im afraid you let me feel your love is near  
You gently comfort me  
You never let me drown in my world of fear  
Youre always here your love is so securing  
You always bring my heart to sing  
When Im so low  
You have been so uplifting  
Youre always there whenever I need you in time  
Youre never late youre timing always perfect  
  
PreChorus  
Ooh oh oh my love ooh oh oh mylove  
I can count on you  
Through all the tides youre by my side  
  
Chorus  
Good love sweet joy in my heart you bring  
I really just cant get enough  
Of all these lovely things  
You never failed me assured  
Youre always on time  
Youve been my hope my strength  
My shield in times of need  
If I might fall youre there to catch me  
Youre there for me i dont worry

When I am lost you were there  
You pulled me through  
And bring me to the right track  
When Im afraid you let me feel your love is near  
You gently comfort me  
You never let me drown in my world of fear  
Youre always here your love is so securing

And all the people they just  
Seem to give up on me  
But you wont let me fall

If I might fall youre there to catch me  
Youre there for me i dont worry

Each day I love you more  
Everythings gonna be alright  
I say baby I need you  
Just cant go on without your love  
Everythings gonna be alright  
No need to worry youre always on time
