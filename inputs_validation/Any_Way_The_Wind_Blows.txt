Cant tell you the truth  
Least I dont lie about that  
Kind of comfort in you  
Comes when you lie right back  
  
Safe from such a strange point of view  
To hear your own words on you  
  
How much do you go to be gone  
You are any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Dont wanna come down too low  
Any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Similar creatures we are  
Chasing the pipe dream down  
Love elusive so far  
Keeps us divided now  
  
Go go on and write me love songs  
So I have something to sing when your gone  
  
How much do you go to be gone  
You are any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Dont wanna come down too low  
Any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Dont wanna come down  
Do you know the way  
To be in one place but sway  
Anyway the winds blowin  
  
You are love you are love  
You are monsters and angels  
Untouched unseen  
  
All in one all in one  
I take all that you are  
Cause youre just like me  
But you move and its hard  
To stay close to a satellite  
  
So I lose sight of you  
Till you come round again  
Im watching the wind  
  
Hey ay hey ay ay  
Anyway the winds blowin  
  
How much do you go to be gone  
You are any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Dont wanna come down too low  
Any way the wind blows  
Any way the wind blows in  
  
Dont wanna come down  
Do you know the way  
To be in one place but stay  
Any way the winds blowin  
Any way the winds blowin
