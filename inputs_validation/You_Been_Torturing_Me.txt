Im gonna stomp you on the top of your foot  
And hang you from a big long fishing hook  
And drop you plunge to the bottom of the sea heyhey  
Let the sharks eat you all up  
If them mean old whales dont interrupt  
Cos baby you know how you been torturing little ol me  
Heyhey  
  
Im the judge the jury too  
Judgement has been brought upon you  
You been convicted for the crime youve done  
You made me feel like a little ol crumb  
You know its wrong to torture me  
You love my friends the same way you love me  
And like Tom I dont wanna hang from a big oak tree over you  
When I say hop I mean make like a frog  
And when I say bark you better sound like a dog  
Cos Im gonna torture you  
The same way you been torturing little ol me heyhey  
Stop torturing me baby
