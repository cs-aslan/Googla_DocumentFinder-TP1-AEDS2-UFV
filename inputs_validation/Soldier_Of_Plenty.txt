God is great God is good  
He guards your neighborhood  
Though its generally understood  
Not quite the way you would  
You try to take the slack  
Stay awake and watch His back  
But something happens every now and then  
And someone breaks into the promised land  
Ah boy boy  
This world is not your toy  
This world is long on hunger  
This world is short on joy  
A E I O  
You speak as if you know  
Whats good for everyone  
Whats good in what youve done  
Whats good about a world in which  
War rages at a fever pitch  
And people die for the little things  
A little corn a little beans  
Ah boy boy  
This world is not your toy  
This world is this world is  
Long on hunger short on joy  
How much longer  
You gonna keep the world hungry boy  
You measure peace with guns  
Progress in megatons  
Whos left when the war is won  
Soldier of misfortune  
Soldier of an angry call  
Soldier on foreign soil  
Im not here to fight your war  
I know what youre fighting for  
Ah boy boy  
This world is not your toy  
This world is this world is  
Long on hunger short on joy  
How much longer  
You gonna keep the world hungry boy
