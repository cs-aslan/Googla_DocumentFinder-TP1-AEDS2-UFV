You dont believe in love  
You dont believe in hatred  
Put your money in the bank  
Its the only way to save it  
  
You try to make a buck  
But you havent made a penny  
You need a little luck  
But you know you wont get any  
  
You dont believe in God  
You dont believe in glory  
Youve got a brother in the clinic  
Tells the same kind of story  
  
If he had another life  
Hed know what would be waiting  
If he had another soul  
He could sell it all to Satan  
  
You dont believe in war  
You dont believe in Jesus  
Got a sister in New York  
She knows how she pleases  
  
Walking the streets  
On the south side of the city  
Trying to make ends meet  
Isnt that a pity for money
