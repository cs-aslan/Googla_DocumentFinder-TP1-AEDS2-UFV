Its colder than winter  
Right here in my heart  
Lord Im gonna miss her  
Shes torn me apart  
  
I couldnt make you love me  
I couldnt give any more  
Its colder than winter  
Since you closed the door  
  
Its colder than winter  
Im freezing inside  
And my tears wont be bitter  
Even though our love died  
  
I couldnt make you love me  
I couldnt give any more  
Its colder than winter  
Since you closed the door  
  
Every time the sun sets  
I shed another tear  
And the lonelier I get  
Wishing you were still here  
  
I couldnt make you love me  
I couldnt give any more  
Its colder than winter  
Since you closed the door
