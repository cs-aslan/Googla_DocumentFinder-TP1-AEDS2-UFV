One two one two three four  
Know a manhis face seemed pulled and tense  
Like hes riding on a motorbike in the strongest winds  
So I approach with tactsuggest that he should relax  
But hes always movin much too fast  
Said hell see me on the flipside  
On this trip hes taken for a ride  
Hes been takin too much on  
There he goes with his perfectly holy unkept clothes  
There he goes  
Hes yet to come backbut Ive seen his picture  
It doesnt look the same up on the racks  
We go way back  
I wonder bout his insides  
Its like his thoughts are too big for his size  
Hes been takenwhere I dont know  
Off he goes with his perfectly unkept hope  
There he goes  
And now I rub my eyesfor he has returned  
Seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned  
For he still smilesand hes still strong  
Nothings changed but the surrounding bullshit that has grown  
And now hes home and were laughing like we always did  
My same old same old friend  
Until a quartertoten  
I saw the strain creep in  
He seems distracted and I know just what is gonna happen next  
Before his first stephe is off again
