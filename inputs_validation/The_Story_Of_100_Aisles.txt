Help yourself  
If you know why you came  
Cause if you need help she says  
Theres something Ive got saved  
This is not what you wanted  
These candy coated fakes  
This is not what you wanted  
This is pain  
Anacin were stumbling again  
Its the story of a hundred aisles  
Walk away from simple on a tray  
Cause if you need help she says  
These fancy pills dont rate  
This is not what you wanted  
A miracle today  
Time is not for sale today  
Time seems so far away  
You need more than this  
Depressed come here try this
