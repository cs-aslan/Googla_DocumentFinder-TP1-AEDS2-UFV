I never knew what I was gonna be  
Somebody saw what I couldnt see  
And it did me up now  
I never thought I could be worthy of  
Lovin under the sky above  
Dont let the wonderful  
Why does everybody have to fit in  
You should feel comfortable in the skin  
Just like me I am the  
  
Souvenir of sadness  
Melting to the madness  
Hands where you can feel this  
Anyone who has this  
  
Stand up Nobodys trying to save you  
Speak up Nobodys waiting to see you  
Wake up Nobodys trying to play you  
Let me make it then youll have this  
Back up Nobody to destroy you  
Now this Nobody else to be this hard  
Go this Whatevers wrong with your head  
Love is my souvenir of sadness  
  
They never knew what I was gonna say  
Punch me and kick me and drown away  
Now you know you are so  
Now look at me what do you have to say  
Never give up for you anyway  
You know who you are so  
Now look at me what do you have to say  
Never give up for you anyway  
Happy child look at that
