If I could have the world and all it owns  
A thousand kingdoms a thousand thrones  
If all the earth were mine to hold  
With wealth my only goal  
  
Id spend my gold on selfish things  
Without the love that Your life brings  
Just a little bit more is all Id need  
Till life was torn from me  
  
Id rather be in the palm of Your hand  
Though rich or poor I may be  
Faith can see right through the circumstance  
Sees the forest in spite of the trees  
Your grace provides for me  
  
If I should walk the streets no place to sleep  
No faith in promises You keep  
Id have no way to buy my bread  
With a bottle for my bed  
  
But if I trust the one who died for me  
Who shed His blood to set me free  
If I live my life to trust in You  
Your grace will see me through  
  
Id rather be in the palm of Your hand  
Though rich or poor I may be  
Faith can see right through the circumstance  
Sees the forest in spite of the trees  
  
If I could have the world  
If I could have the world and all it owns
