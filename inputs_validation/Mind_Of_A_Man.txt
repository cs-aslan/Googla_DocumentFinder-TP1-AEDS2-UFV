Usher  
Interlude  
That night I said I was recording late  
I wasnt recording late  
I was just smokin chillin had a couple dranks  
Not much of anything  
That time I flew down to MIA  
Damn I went MIA  
I hit up KOD with a few bands to play  
And that aint everything  
All I think about is bitches  
And everywhere I go they comin  
Double standards that everybody talkin bout  
The tables turned around I be throwin up  
So I aint tryna justify
