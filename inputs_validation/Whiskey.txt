Dont do anything mellow at the Whiskey  
Jimmy says Im so unfortunate  
But let the people at the Whiskey be a bundle of nerves  
And dont sing on fairness  
Cause if you do your musical insurance better be paid up  
  
Dont sing anything pretty at the Whiskey  
Johnny says youd best take my advice  
Cause the stony little crowd will get to talkin even louder  
And theyll smother you in hissin  
And if they do your musical insurance better be paid up  
  
Oh dont do anything mellow at the Whiskey  
Johnny says Im so so unfortunate  
But let the people at the Whiskey be a bundle of nerves  
And dont sing on what theyre missin  
  
Like Sunday mornings filled with flowers  
Just goin fifteen miles up north  
Cause if you do your musical insurance better be paid up  
Cause if you do your musical insurance better be paid up
