Is a zone where  
There is no doubt  
No more fallout  
Why dont you step  
Through the mirror and see  
  
From Arizona  
To Eldorado  
Sure is a mighty long way  
Hey little girl  
Is something wrong  
I know its hard  
For you to get along  
  
The belltower rings  
It tolls a hollow sound  
But your castles in Spain  
Still maybe realized  
And longings more profound  
  
You see every cloud  
Has a silver lining  
And sometimes paradise  
Around your corner lies  
In Amazona everything is nice  
  
Little one come take my hand  
Ill try to help you there  
Ill take you there  
  
Amazonas  
Getting closer  
Soon youll see  
Journeys over  
We almost there
