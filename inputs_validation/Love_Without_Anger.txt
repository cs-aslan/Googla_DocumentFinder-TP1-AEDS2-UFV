Love without anger  
He picked up the phone and took the call  
A long distance voice just started to bawl  
I dont care if you feel small  
  
Love without anger isnt love at all  
Why cant you have your cake and eat it too  
Why believe in things that make it tough on you  
Why scream and cry when you know its through  
Why fall in love when theres better things to do  
Barbie and ken in a great big fight  
  
Seems ken forgot to make it home one night  
You know what you are seeing simply cant be right  
Looks like loves bark is worse than its bite  
  
He was young and in love  
So he just couldnt see  
And it compelled him to ask  
Are you kidding me  
You must be kidding me  
  
Love without teardrops isnt the same  
He asked to be counted out of her game  
She thought it him who was so insane  
Love is what it does by any other name
