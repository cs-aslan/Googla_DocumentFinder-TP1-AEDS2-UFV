Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota  
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon  
And one day his woman ran off with another guy  
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that  
He said Im gonna get that boy  
So one day he walked into town  
Booked himself a room in the local saloon  
  
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room  
Only to find Gideons bible  
Rocky had come equipped with a gun  
To shoot off the legs of his rival  
His rival it seems had broken his dreams  
By stealing the girl of his fancy  
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil  
But everyone knew her as Nancy  
Now she and her man who called himself Dan  
Were in the next room at the hoedown  
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin  
He said Danny boy this is a showdown  
But Daniel was hothe drew first and shot  
And Rocky collapsed in the corner  
  
The doctor came in stinking of gin  
And proceeded to lie on the table  
He said Rocky you met your match  
And Rocky said Doc its only a scratch  
And Ill be better Ill be better doc as soon as I am able  
  
Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room  
Only to find Gideons bible  
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt  
To help with good Rockys revival
