Watch for vipers and poison snakes  
Feeling fingers make no mistake  
Grabbing that pull your hair  
Stealing everything there everything  
  
Restless widow in the dark  
Careless looks for a spark  
Near the trap fate rears its head  
No hesitation victim dead  
Just from the start its the end  
  
And its all the same in the end  
Its all the same in the end  
  
Spider moving up your wall  
To the ceiling he slowly crawls  
Weaves a web above your bed  
Egg that cracks falls on your head  
  
And its all the same  
Its all the same  
No hesitation victim dead  
Just from the start its the end  
  
No wrong no right or guilt admission  
Its all the same  
Youve been bitten youve been bitten
