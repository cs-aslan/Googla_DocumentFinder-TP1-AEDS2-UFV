Ive Been Dreaming For So Long  
To Find The Meaning  
To Understand  
The Secret Of Life  
Why Am I Here  
To Try Again  
  
Will I Always  
Will YouAlways  
See The Truth  
When It Stares You In The Face  
Will I Ever  
Will I Never Free Myself  
Breakin These Chains  
  
Chorus  
Give My Heart Give My Soul  
Id Turn It Back Its My Fault  
Your Destiny Is Forlorn  
Have to live till its undone  
Give My Heart Givr My Soul  
Id Turn It Back  
And Then at last  
Ill be on my way  
  
Ive Been Living For So Long  
Many Seasons Passed Me By  
Ive Seen Kingdoms Through Ages  
Rise And Fall  
Ive Seen It All  
  
Ive Seen The Horrors  
Ive Seen The Wonders  
Happning Just In Front Of My Eyes  
Will I Ever  
Will I Never Free Myself By Making It Right  
  
Chorus  
  
Jillian  
Our Dream Ended Long Ago  
All Our Stories  
And All Our Glories  
I Held So Dear  
We Wont Be Together For Ever and Ever  
No More Tears  
Ill Always Be Here  
Till The End  
  
Voices Jillian  
  
Chorus
