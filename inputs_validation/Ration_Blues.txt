Baby baby baby whats wrong with Uncle Sam  
Hes cut down on my sugar now hes messin with my ham  
I got the ration blues blue as I can be  
Oh me Ive got those ration blues  
  
I got to live on forty ounces of any kind of meat  
Those forty little ounces gotta last me all the week  
I got to cut down on my jelly  
It takes sugar to make it sweet  
Im gonna steal all your jelly baby  
And rob you of your meat  
I got the ration blues blue as I can be  
Oh me Ive got those ration blues  
  
I like to wake up in the morning with my jelly by my side  
Since rationing started baby you just take your stuff and hide  
They reduced my meat and sugar  
And rubbers disappearing fast  
You cant ride no more with poppa  
Cause Uncle Sam wants my gas  
I got the ration blues blue as I can be  
Oh me Ive got those ration blues
