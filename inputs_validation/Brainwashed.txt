You look like a real human being  
But you dont have a mind of your own  
Yeah you can talk you can breathe  
You can work you can stitch you can sew  
But youre brainwashed  
Yes you are yes you are  
Get down on your knees  
Youve got a job and a house  
And a wife and your kids and a car  
Yeah youre conditioned to be  
What they want you to be  
And be happy to be where you are  
Yes you are  
Get down on your knees  
Get down on your knees  
  
The aristocrats and bureaucrats  
Are dirty rats  
For making you what you are  
Theyre up there and you re down here  
Youre on the ground and theyre up with the stars  
All your life theyve kicked you around and pushed you around  
Till you cant take any more  
To them youre just a speck of dirt  
But you dont want to get up off the floor  
Mister youre just brainwashed  
They give you social security  
Tax saving benefits that grow at maturity  
Yeah youre conditioned to be  
What they want you to be  
And to do what they want you to  
Yes you are yes you are  
Get down on your knees
