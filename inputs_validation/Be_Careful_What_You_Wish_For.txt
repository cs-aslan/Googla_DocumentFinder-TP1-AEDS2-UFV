This is me Ive got a nasty sense of humor  
And a case of high anxiety  
If you please I would rather be alone  
Let the water running judge me  
  
So I got my life together  
But its half of what it should be  
So you think you can make it better  
You better help me help me  
  
Hang on but prepare cant live up to you  
Hold on hold on  
Theres a part of me that cant escape my insecurities  
Hang on this is me  
  
Cant you see I got a perfect explanation  
But keep it deep inside of me  
Pardon me but if you really want to know it  
Then you better learn to judge me  
  
So youve got youre life together  
But you say you gotta have more  
So you think I could make it better  
Just be careful what you wish for  
  
Hang on but prepare cant live up to you  
Hold on hold on  
Theres a part of me that cant escape my insecurities  
Hang on this is me  
  
Paper clip prediction  
But these pictures are deceiving  
Cause their colors lost their place  
And now theyre dripping down and bleeding  
  
And theyre running and running away  
Packed it up and leaving  
And these dreams turn to nightmares  
Like a promise with no meaning  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
You just might get it  
If this is what you live for  
You might as well forget it  
  
You dont know what youre in for  
This war will never end  
Be careful what you wish for  
You just might get it get it get it  
You just might get it get it get it so hold tight  
  
Hang on but prepare cant live up to you  
Hold on hold on  
Theres a part of me that cant escape my insecurities  
Hang on this is me  
Be careful what you wish for  
  
Hang on but prepare cant live up to you  
Hold on hold on  
You just might get it  
Theres still a part of me that cant escape my insecurities  
Hang on this is me  
Be careful what you wish for  
  
Be careful what you wish for  
This is me  
Be careful what you wish for  
This is me
