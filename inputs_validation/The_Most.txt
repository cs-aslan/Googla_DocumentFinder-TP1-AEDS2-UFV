Chorus  
Where are you now that I need you  
Where are you now that I need you  
Need you the most  
When you broke down I didnt leave you  
I stayed by your side  
So where are you now that I need you  
Need you the most  
  
Verse 1  
I gave you attention when nobody else was paying  
I gave you the shirt off my back what you saying  
To keep you warm  
I showed you the game everybody else was playing  
Thats for sure  
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying  
Oh lord  
  
Chorus  
Where are you now that I need you  
Where are you now that I need you  
Need you the most  
When you broke down I didnt leave you  
I stayed by your side  
So where are you now that I need you  
Need you the most  
  
Verse 2  
I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken  
Yes I did  
I gave you the key when the door wasnt open  
Just admit it  
See I gave you faith turned your doubt into hoping  
Cant deny it  
Now Im all alone and my joys turn to moping  
Tell me  
  
Chorus  
Where are you now that I need you  
Where are you now  
Where are you now that I need you  
Couldnt find you anywhere  
When you broke down I didnt leave you  
I was by your side  
So where are you now that I need you  
I need you the most
