Heres another topic Im addressin  
so learn a quick lesson about your Smith and Wesson  
Sit your ass back and comprehend  
as I let you know about mans best friend  
Now remember it used to be a dog like Lassie  
but now in ninetyone its a gun if you asked me  
Just like a jimmy hats used for protection  
I use my nine when suckers start to flexin  
Cause if you run up and try to play mine  
Id rather have a AK than a fuckin canine  
Cause if you shot your gun and my dog tried to fetch her  
me and the dogs goin out on a stretcher  
And I aint with that so I gotta get that  
big black gat aim and I hit that  
Forget about a dog fool hell shit in the den  
Nowadays a gat is mans best friend

Here is the reason why Ice Cube pack  
Just in case the little punks try to jack  
I cant put a motherfuckin pitbull  
under a coat in the small of my back  
So I gotta take my beretta and I betcha  
itll probably work a 100 percent better  
Cause itll keep me out of danger  
with sixteen in the clip and one in the chamber  
So this goes to all yall intruders  
Beware of the owner cause the owner is a shooter  
I dont just wanna give your ass rabies  
Id rather have your ass pushing up daisies  
And I cant do that with Benji  
Rin Tin Tin or Spuds McKenzie  
Forget about a dog fool hell shit in the den  
Nowadays a gat is mans best friend  
  
Just dont let me see you shoot no dogs  
Hey I got shots fired here send me another unit  
The profile of a typical American gun owner is this  
Over thirty white male middle class  
  
Take that motherfuckers
