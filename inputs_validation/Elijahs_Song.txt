Got a rock and roll ditty  
From the heart of the city  
To a country lane far away  
Drums are beatin  
And the bass repeatin  
And it rocks you to sleep just the same  
  
Sleep safe and warm  
Dream cares be gone  
You know that it wont take long  
Well be singin Elijahs song  
Singin Elijahs song  
  
Ya got a rock and roll daddy  
And you make him so glad  
Hes got a smile  
A mile across his face  
Movie star mom  
Gonna keep you safe from harm  
And shell do it with style and grace  
  
Sleep safe and warm  
Dream cares be gone  
You know that it wont be long  
Well be singing Elijahs song  
Singin Elijahs song  
  
Little bitty child when you laugh  
I smile  
Its a feelin I wont ever forget  
Far from now  
When youre wanderin round  
Heres a song that I left in your head  
Dream thats what you do  
Dream cause dreams come true  
Someday when youre big and strong  
Youll remember Elijahs song  
Remember Elijahs song  
Remember Elijahs song  
Remember Elijahs song
