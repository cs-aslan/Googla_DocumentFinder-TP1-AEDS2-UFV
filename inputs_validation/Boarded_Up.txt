Boarded up

Nailed up shut

Music venue has had its day  
Death watch beetle band moved in to play  
Groups dont come down from London way

Touring companies stay away  
Rats and mice take the center stage  
Carpenters mate have a field day  
  
Boarded up

Twobyfourded up  
Yeah were boarded up  
  
Pubs and clubs had the chop  
Making way for a superstore plot  
Some town planner didnt know when to stop  
  
Boarded up

Boarding up
