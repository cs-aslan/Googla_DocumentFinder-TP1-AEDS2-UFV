All the animals in the world  
Whos going to rescue them  
Who says that Noah is going to  
Come around once again  
Ill swim Ill swim Ill swim  
And Ill never stop until I get  
Across the sea  
Mama Mama Mama  
Why did you have to leave  
I need you now  
Love was just a dream  
Love was just a dream  
All the animals in the world  
What have we done to them  
Whos going to tell our children  
Where and why theyre all gone  
Ill run Ill run Ill run  
And Ill never stop until I get  
To be free  
Mama Mama Mama  
Why did you have to leave  
I need you now  
Love was just a dream  
Love was just a dream  
Stop killing stop killing stop killing animals  
Stop killing stop killing stop killing animals  
I cant take no more  
Im drifting to the shore  
I cant take no more  
Im knocking on your door  
Ill swim Ill swim Ill swim  
And Ill never stop until I get  
Across the sea  
Mama Mama Mama  
Why did you have to leave  
I need you now  
I need you now need you now
