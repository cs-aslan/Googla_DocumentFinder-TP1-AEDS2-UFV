Look at you and look at me  
Now what are we supposed to be  
Were so afraid of something new  
You know its true  
  
You turn around and then its gone  
You cant be sure if its the same old song  
Were so afraid of everyone  
Afraid of the sun  
  
Please let this be love  
A love that is so true  
  
Its all up to me  
Its all up to you  
Time will let you know  
Whatever will be  
Whatever you do  
Time will let you know  
  
You see your folks and all their friends  
aint it funny how the story ends  
You wonder why youre hanging on  
When its gone  
  
Please let this be love  
A love that is so true  
  
Its all up to me  
Its all up to you  
Time will let you know  
Whatever will be  
Whatever you do  
Time will let you know  
  
Look at you and look at me  
Now what are we supposed to be  
Were so afraid of something new  
You know its true
