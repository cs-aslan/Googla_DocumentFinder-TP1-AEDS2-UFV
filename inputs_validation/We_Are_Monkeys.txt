People think theyre funny when they havent the wit  
Others think theyre gorgeous but inside they feel shit  
Many think theyre brainy but they havent a clue  
And I think Im clever cause Im singing this to you  
  
Chorus  
We are wrong we are wrong  
We are all so so wrong  
We are monkeys  
We are false we run true  
We should be in the zoo with our uncles  
And if you dont believe  
Go and climb up a tree and youll love it  
Youre a fool to believe anymore  
So believe youre a monkey  
  
All the clever monkeys telling us what to do  
Telling us to stay in line and join the monkey queue  
Thinking that theyre special cause they went to private zoo  
One day soon theyre gonna end up in a monkey stew  
  
Chorus
