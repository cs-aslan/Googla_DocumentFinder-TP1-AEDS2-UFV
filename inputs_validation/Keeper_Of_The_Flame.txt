Im the keeper of the flame  
My torch of love lights his name  
Ask no pity beg my shame  
Im the keeper of the flame  
  
Played with fire and I was burn  
Gave a heart but I was spurn  
All these time I have yearned  
Just to have my love return  
  
Years have passed by  
The spark still remains  
True love cant die  
It smoulders in flame  
When the fire is burning off  
And the angels call my name  
Dying love will leave no doubt  
Im the keeper of the flame  
  
Years have passed by  
The spark still remains  
True love cant die  
It smoulders in flame  
When the fire is burning out  
And the angels call my love  
Dying love will leave no doubt  
Im the keeper of the flame
