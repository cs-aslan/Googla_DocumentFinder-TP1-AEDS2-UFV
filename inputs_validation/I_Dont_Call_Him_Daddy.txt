It was six in the morning  
When I made the county line  
Theres someone I got to talk to  
I cant get it off my mind  
  
Hes just a kid  
And hes in a pretty rough spot  
Two dimes to make a phone call  
Thats about all Ive got  
  
Hows my boy today  
I know its been three weeks  
But you know how far Ive got to go  
To make those loose ends meet  
  
Hows your mama now  
With her new livein friend  
Oh how I hate the wounds  
That never seem to mend  
  
Chorus  
And he says I dont call him daddy  
but he takes care of things  
When you pick me up on Friday  
Are you gonna bring me anything  
Oh dont worry dad ya know  
It dont matter what we do  
I dont call him daddy  
He could never be like you  
Never be like you  
  
God bless their little hearts  
Theyre the ones who really pay  
When mom and dad cant get along  
And go their seperate ways  
In a way Im glad theres someone  
There to fill the empty place  
Tears of understanding  
Streak down a dirty face  
  
Chorus  
  
He is quite a little man  
Growing up as fast as he can  
And I dont get to see him  
Half as much as I had planned  
Theres so much I need to tell him  
So precious little time  
A little rain on the window  
In a little way goodbye  
  
Chorus x2
