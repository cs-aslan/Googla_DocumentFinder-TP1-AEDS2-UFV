In a city of the future  
It is difficult to concentrate  
Meet the boss meet the wife  
Everybodys happy  
Everyone is made for life  
  
In a city of the future  
It is difficult to find a space  
Im too busy to see you  
Youre too busy to wait  
  
But Im okay how are you  
Thanks for asking thanks for asking  
But Im okay how are you  
I hope youre okay too  
  
Everyone one of those days  
When the skys California blue  
With a beautiful bombshell  
I throw myself into my work  
Im too lazy Ive been kidding myself for so long  
  
Im okay how are you  
Thanks for asking thanks for asking  
But Im okay how are you  
I hope youre okay too
