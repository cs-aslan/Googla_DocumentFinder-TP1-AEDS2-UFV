There goes ezy ezy ryder  
Riding down the highway of desire  
He says the free wind takes him higher  
Tryin to find his heaven above  
But hes dyin to be loved  
Dyin to be loved  
Hes tellin me livin is so magic  
He says a day is forever so he claims  
Hes talkin about dyin its so tragic baby  
But dont you worry about it today we got freedom comin our way  
Freedom comin our way  
  
Come on do you  
They key is going to last  
Get more gas  
See all the lovers say do what you please  
Gotta get the brothers together we got to be free  
And got to try to make those guys

And Ill be stoned stoned clear as day  
Love comin in like crazy  
Stoned crazy

There goes ezy ezy ryder  
Riding down the highway of desire  
He says the free wind takes him higher  
Searchin for his heaven above  
But hes dyin to be loved  
Dyin to be loved
