Time  
Time  
Time so close that I can touch you give me  
Time so near that I can breathe you give me  
Time I dont know why I feel like surrender  
Chains The feeling of the feelings still remains  
Youre much too old to keep on playing games  
I dont know why I feel like surrender  
And its a strange feeling  
strange feeling I feel inside  
And its a strange beating strange  
beating in this heart of mine  
I got to run I got to hide  
Another place another time Time  
A chill is slowly rolling down my spine  
And suddenly I lose the grip on time  
the time and the space of time  
And its a strange feeling
