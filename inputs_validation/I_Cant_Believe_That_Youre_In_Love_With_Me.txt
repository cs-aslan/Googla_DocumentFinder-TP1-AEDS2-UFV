Oh your eyes of blue  
Your kisses too  
I never knew what they could do  
I cant believe that youre in love with me  
  
Yes youre telling everyone I know  
Im on your mind each time you go  
They cant believe that youre in love with me oh yeah  
  
Oh baby I have always placed you far above me  
I just cant imagine that you love me  
And after all is said and done  
To think that Im the lucky one  
I cant believe youre in love with me
