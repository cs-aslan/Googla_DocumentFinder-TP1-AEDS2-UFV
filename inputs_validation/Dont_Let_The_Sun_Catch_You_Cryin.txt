Dont let the sun catch you cryin  
Cryin at my front door  
You done daddy dirty  
He sure dont want you no more  
  
Dont let the sun catch you lyin  
Lyin at my front door  
Daddys done turned salty  
And baby you made him so sore  
  
You can cry cry cry  
Yes baby you can wail  
Beat your head on the pavement  
Till the man comes and throws you in jail  
  
Dont let the sun catch you cryin  
Cryin at my front door  
You done your daddy dirty  
I tell you he just dont want you no more  
  
  
  
Dont let the sun catch you lyin  
Lyin at my front door  
Daddys done turned salty  
Baby you made him so sore  
  
Whoa you know you done me dirty now  
And I just dont want you no more
