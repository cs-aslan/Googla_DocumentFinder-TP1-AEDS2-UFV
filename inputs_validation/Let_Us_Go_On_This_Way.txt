To get tyou baby I went through the wringer  
Aint gonna let you slip through my fingers  
Going to school isnt my fondest desire  
But sittin in class you set my soul on fire  
God please let us go on this way  
All day long I practiced what to sayay  
I think about this game that I like to playay  
When I leave you Im so depressed  
Cause youre my only happiness  
God please let us go on this way  
Seems we have extrasensory perception  
You can send me thoughts Id have no objection  
Now we can fly high in the sky  
Well live forever well never die  
God please let us go on this wayay  
God please let us go on  
God please let us go on this wayay  
God please let us go on  
God please let us go on this wayay  
God please let us go on  
God dont let her slip through my fingers  
God please let us go on  
God please let us go on this wayay
