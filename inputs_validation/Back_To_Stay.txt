Although Ive been away so many lonely nights  
You know Im back today Im back to stay in your arms  
Although Ive been around and lived the life I said I loved  
You know without you honey all I do is worth nothing  
And girlie dont cry for me  
Although there might be other people in my life  
Honey on my mind you will always find theres only you  
And though you say youll journey to some foreign land  
Ill remember you yes and Ill be true to your memory  
And when at last you do come wandering home to me  
I might look at you but it will be through the weeks between  
And when I hold you it might not be you I have  
In the passing days we might both have changed to something new
