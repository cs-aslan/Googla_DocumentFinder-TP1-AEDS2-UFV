My pockets were full and now my moneys gone  
My friends come around and now theyre gone  
Things come and they come and then they go  
And where they go nobody knows  
  
Its gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
Its gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
  
My cup over runneth with the fullness and grace  
Yet people push bullshit in my face  
The future cant hold what your money cant buy  
My brother keep striving your child relies  
  
Its gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
Its gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
  
This world keeps on spinning does the future know  
Were destined to screw ourselves one blow  
Weve ruined whats pure down from nature below  
Youd better look back itll all be gone  
  
Its gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
Its gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
  
So children please listen this world is yours  
This message is too deep to ignore  
Your forefathers said but they did not do  
The things that would show that they cared for you  
  
Its gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
Its gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
Comes around comes around comes around  
Comes around comes around comes around  
Comes around comes around comes around  
Comes around yeah
