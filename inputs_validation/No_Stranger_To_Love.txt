Cold is the night  
Lonely till dawn  
Cry for the light  
For the love that wont come  
You said that youd never  
Leave me alone  
  
I gave you my heart  
You cried for my soul  
An angel wont come  
This devil wont go  
Something is wrong  
I just cant get away  
  
Living on the street Im no stranger to love  
Why cant you see Im no stranger to love  
Living on the street Im no stranger to love  
But Im a stranger in your arms  
Yes Im a stranger in your arms  
  
Maybe its right  
But I just cant understand  
The hurt that I feel  
For my love second hand  
I know I should leave  
But I just cant walk away  
  
Living on the street Im no stranger to love  
Why cant you see Im no stranger to love  
Living on the street Im no stranger to love  
Im a stranger in your arms  
Living on the street Im no stranger to love  
Why cant you see Im no stranger to love
