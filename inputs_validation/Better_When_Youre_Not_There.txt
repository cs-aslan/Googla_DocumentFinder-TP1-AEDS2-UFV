Its good to see your face in the morning  
It helps me to face the day  
I see you lighting candles  
As I turn away  
  
I want you I need you in a way that confuses me but  
Its good to hold you  
But its better when youre not there  
Its better when youre not there  
Its better when I dont care about the things you say in the worlds worst
way  
Its better when youre not there  
  
But somehow it waits til the morning  
I feel your eyes on me  
Its a such a perfect moment  
It almost sets me free  
  
I wanted to keep you holding in while youre pulling away  
Its good to know you but its better when youre not there  
Its better when youre not there  
Its better when I dont care about the things you say in the worlds worst
way  
Its better when youre not there  
Its better when youre not there  
  
Its good to see your face in the picture  
Its amazing what I miss  
Its always right in the moment  
When youre colored by your kiss  
  
I wanted to tell you there are times when I think of your face  
Its good to know you  
But its better youre not there  
Its better when youre not there  
Its better when I dont care about the things you say in the worlds worst way  
Its better when youre not there  
Its better when youre not there
