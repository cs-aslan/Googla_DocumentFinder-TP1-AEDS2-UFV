Daytime Im fine  
Everything is back to normal  
Last night I thought that I would die  
I had nightmares  
I was so scared  
Thank God that you are by my side  
To hold me when I cry  
  
Chorus  
I want to be strong  
But I dont want to be alone tonight  
I want to believe that I can save the world  
And make it right but Im only human  
And youve got a heros face  
Right here in your arms  
Is the safest place the safest place  
  
It feels so real  
You showed me I can trust you  
With emotions I had locked away  
It was your touch your words  
They heal the deepest part of me  
That only you can see  
  
Chorus  
  
As long as I am with you  
As long as I can feel you  
Thats all I need to keep me going  
On and on and on and on  
  
Chorus
