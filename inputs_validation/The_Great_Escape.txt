Verse 1  
I can understand how when the edges are rough  
And they cut you like the tiniest slithers of glass  
And you feel too much  
And you dont know how long youre gonna last  
  
PreChorus  
Everyone you know is tryin smooth it over  
Find a way to make the heart go away  
Everyone you know is tryin smooth it over  
Like youre trying to scream underwater  
  
Chorus  
But I wont let you make the great escape  
Im never gonna watch you checkin out of this place  
Im not gonna lose you cause the passion and the pain  
Are gonna keep you alive someday  
Gonna keep you alive someday  
  
Verse 2  
I feel like I could wave my fist in front of your face  
And you wouldnt flinch or even feel a thing  
And youve retreated to your silent corner  
Like you decided the fight was over for ya  
  
PreChorus  
Everyone you know is tryin smooth it over  
Find a way to make the heart go away  
Everyone you know is tryin smooth it over  
Everyone needs a floor they can fall through  
  
Chorus  
I wont let you make the great escape  
Im never gonna watch you checkin outta this place  
Im not gonna lose you cause the passion and pain  
Are gonna keep you alive someday  
Theyre gonna keep you alive someday  
  
Bridge  
Im terrified of the dark but not if you go with me  
And I dont need a pill to make me numb  
And I wrote the book on runnin  
But that chapter of my life will soon be done  
  
Outro  
Im the king of the great escape  
Youre not gonna watch me checkin outta this place  
Youre not gonna lose me cause the passion and pain  
Are gonna keep us alive someday  
Yeah the passion and the pain are gonna keep us alive  
Someday someday
