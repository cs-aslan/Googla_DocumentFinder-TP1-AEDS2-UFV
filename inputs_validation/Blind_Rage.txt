Whos that peeping through my door  
Sneaking up and down the hall  
I cant stand it anymore  
I cant stand it anymore  
Whos that peeping through my door  
Sneaking up and down the hall  
I cant stand it anymore  
I cant stand it anymore  
Blind rage Im in a blind rage  
Blind rage  
Blind rage  
Blind rage  
  
Whos that creeping in my room  
Blocking out the stars and moon  
I fear you will attack me soon  
Who goes there
