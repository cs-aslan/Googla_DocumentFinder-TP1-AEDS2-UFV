Lying here with you  
I watch you while you sleep  
The dawn is closing in  
With every breath you breathe  
  
I can feel the change  
The change youve made in me  
But will I ever see  
All the things you see in me  
  
When you say that Im one of a kind  
Baby I dont see it but you believe  
That Im so strong and true I promise you  
Ill try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
When it comes to love  
I may not know the rules  
But theres one thing I know  
My heart belongs to you just you  
  
When you say that Im one of a kind  
Baby I dont see it but you believe  
That Im so strong and true I promise you  
Ill try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
You show me you love me  
With a fire that burns deep inside  
  
When you say that Im one of a kind  
Baby I dont see it but you believe  
That Im so strong and true I promise you  
Ill try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
When you say that Im one of a kind  
Baby I dont see it but you believe  
That Im so strong and true I promise you  
Ill try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
I am  
Ill never understand  
I dont think Ill ever understand  
Why you love me  
Why you love me just like I am
