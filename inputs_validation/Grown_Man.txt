Now that Im finally free  
Im bouta throw it again  
I take my life in my hands  
Cause Im much more than a man  
I am grown ass man  
Now that Im finally free  
  
I was lost but now Im found  
I was blind but now I see  
Super high cant touch the ground  
Life tested me but god blessin me  
Every sixteen bars is testimony  
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa  
I have find myself then remind myself  
Woke up Im grown I gotta blame myself  
Streets taught me everything I train to sell  
Did wrong so long know didnt know nothin else  
Then my lima crew was like me a member  
Think every man worth enemies himself  
Glad as well but Im mad as hell  
Cause my best friend probably gon die in jail  
I aint no lie to tell prolly cry like hell  
If I dwell on it cause he got a eighty years  
Im going hard see I might as well  
Guess I gotta a hard head like my daddy had  
And my daddy dad my great great great great  
Grandpa had a really crazy swag  
So I stand a day  
Diggin down a grave  
That if I can change now  
And my mind is made  
A got a point and prove  
And a sign to raise  
Cant let them make mistakes  
That his daddy made  
  
Finally free  
Youre never send me away  
Took everything that I had  
For me to follow the plan  
Now that Im finally free  
Im bouta throw it again  
I take my life in my hands  
Cause Im much more than a man  
Now that Im finally free  
  
Squash the beef im free of that  
This crazy summer aint feelin that  
I guess they wanna see us kill each other  
If im dead who the fuck gon help my mother  
I done struggled to hustle im too hard for this  
I done rushed and killed aint proud of that  
Smoke weed took pills sold powder patches  
Im a solider I understand where the cowards at  
My home boy gone where the flowers at  
Out of money and the work cant bring that back  
If I had one wish wish momma there  
Could come down now and see me rap  
But she see me now and I believe in that  
Wanna script of that I aint going back  
So I put my family on I my back  
Lost so much I cant pay that back  
I was lost but now Im found  
I was blind but now I see  
Super high cant touch the ground  
Life tested me but god blessin me  
Every sixteen bars is testimony  
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa  
I have find myself then remind myself  
Fuck up the wrong I gotta blind myself  
Its Gucci huh

Youll never take me away  
Took everything that I have  
For me to follow the plan  
Now that I m finally free

Cause Im much more than a man  
Now that Im finally free
