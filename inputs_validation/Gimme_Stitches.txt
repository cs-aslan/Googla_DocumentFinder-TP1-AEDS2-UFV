I can be your right of way  
So we can get out of here  
Ive always been the one  
Who runs from everyone  
Cos everyones just too weird  
  
Sink with someone tied to me  
Im making you volunteer  
Another one has come and gone  
They crawl along  
Make them disappear  
  
Dress me up in stitches  
Its now or never  
Tired of wearing black and blue  
Dress me up in stitches  
Its now or never  
Tired of wearing black and blue  
Dying to get my blood on you  
Blood on you  
  
Take another stab at me  
I promise in time Ill heal  
But yesterday went on and on a bit too long  
I waited out on high street  
Theres nothing to find out here  
Another day has come and gone  
They crawl along  
Wasting all these years  
  
Dress me up in stitches  
Its now or never  
Tired of wearing black and blue  
Dress me up in stitches  
Its now or never  
Tired of wearing black and blue  
Dying to get my blood on you  
Blood on you  
  
How can you go on  
When youre murdering someone  
Killing me like you do  
  
Gimme stitches  
Now or never  
  
Before I get my blood on you
