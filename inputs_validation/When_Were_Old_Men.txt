Ive spent all of my time on the road  
Sleeping my days away but you should know  
That Im reflecting on who Ive let go  
The people Ive hurt in ways Ill never know  
And I never meant to be hurtful to you  
Please dont hate me  
All I can say I did All I could do  
Please dont hate me for this  
Ive spent all of my nights wide awake  
Wishing for some kind of poison to take  
So that my conscience would just take a break  
I am so tired of the noise that it makes  
Im guilty enough without hearing it twice  
Please dont hate me  
You wont give it up but its all in your eyes  
Please dont hate me for this  
Ive spent every second Ive had  
Counting the minutes and Im going mad  
I am redefining the words I am sad  
Nothing Ive done ever hurt quite this bad  
And Im sure that I will heal faster than you  
Please dont hate me  
I dont expect you to know what to do  
Please dont hate me  
When were old men we will not be alone  
Not be alone anymore Not be alone  
When were old men we will not be alone  
Not be alone anymore Not be alone
