Everything was wonderful when you were in my life  
Yesterday we were on a roll baby then we end up in a fight  
Everywhere I look I see problems where I never seen before  
The cracks in the sidewalk when I get home my key dont even fit the door  
  
Chorus  
The moon dont shine its broken down  
The clouds are crying theyre broken down  
The car wont start its broken down  
And this shattered heart its broken down  
My whole damn world its broken down  
Since you left me girl Ive broken down  
  
Stepped outside into the night I took a walk around the block  
I stopped by the church that I used to go inside but even that door was
locked  
So I came back home feeling so alone a light had burned out in the hall  
My TV is broke said Im out of smoke theres no one I can even call  
  
Chorus  
  
Said my whole damn world its broken down  
Since you left me girl Ive broken down  
  
Till you come back come back to me Im going to be broken down  
Till you come back come back to me Im going to be broken down  
  
Chorus  
  
I mean my whole damn world its broken down  
Since you left me girl Ive broken down  
My whole damn world its broken down  
Since you left me girl its broken down
