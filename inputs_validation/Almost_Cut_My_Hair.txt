Almost cut my hair  
It happened just the other day  
Its gettin kind of long  
I couldve said it was in my way  
  
But I didnt and I wonder why  
I feel like letting my freak flag fly  
And I feel like I owe it to someone  
  
Must be because I had the flu for Christmas  
And Im not feeling up to par  
It increases my paranoia  
Like looking in my mirror and seeing a police car  
  
Well Im not giving in an inch to fear  
Cause Ive promised myself this year  
I feel like I owe it to someone  
  
When I finally get myself together  
Im gonna get down in that sunny southern weather  
  
And Im goin to find a space inside to laugh  
Separate the wheat from the chaff  
I feel like I owe it to someone yeah
