If you ever should leave  
Why would I want to live  
Darling you must believe  
Wont you try to forgive  
What a fool I would be  
If I fooled with your love for me  
Id be wrong from the start  
Id be unfair to my heart  
So whatever you do  
Dont you say that were through  
Id do nothing but grieve  
If you ever should leave  
  
Oh what a fool I would be  
If I fooled with your love for me  
Id be wrong from the start  
Id be unfair to my heart  
So whatever you do  
Dont you say that were through  
Id do nothing but grieve  
If you ever should leave  
Id do nothing but grieve  
If you ever should leave
