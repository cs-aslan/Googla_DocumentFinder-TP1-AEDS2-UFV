When its missing then you want it more  
It isnt right  
Turning turning out the door  
And back to this  
Leave it like it was before  
And let me out  
Mustve been the end of the story  
  
Giving it all giving it all away  
Youre gonna wake up someone  
Well study it all  
The wings the crowd your face  
Youre gonna end up like one  
  
Well trouble at home  
Travel the way you say  
The road dont like me  
Travel away  
Travel it all away  
The roads gonna end on me  
  
Man they like me  
Cause Im a warrior a warrior  
Stand on my feet  
Dance the warrior the warrior  
Where would I be  
Id be a warrior a warrior  
  
Now the strangers have caught on  
And theyre riding in the backseat  
The rivers gonna wash all  
Yeah the river it spoke to me  
It told me Im small  
And I swallowed it down  
If I make it all  
Im a make you want me  
  
Hey  
  
Trouble at home  
Travel the way you say  
The road dont like me  
Travel it all travel it all away  
The roads gonna get on me  
And Im small  
The roads gonna get on me  
Well if it gets it all  
The roads gonna end on me  
  
Hey  
Hey hey  
  
Like a warrior a warrior  
Dance the warrior the warrior
