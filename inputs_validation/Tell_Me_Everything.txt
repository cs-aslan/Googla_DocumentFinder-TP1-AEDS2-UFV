If I could have what I want Ill just want what Ive got  
I told myself a million times thats the truth but its not  
I could give you some lessons on how to cry all night  
I know the hurtings only started and it might never stop  
  
Oh Angeline you want some help from me now  
Now since he left you alone  
Dont say it aint so you betray people here  
Its not so long ago that  
  
You were everything to me  
You were everything to me  
I dont know why but your pain  
Is such a pleasure to see  
So baby tell me everything  
  
So pardon me if I dont cry cause your love is on the shelf  
After all youre so good at looking out for yourself  
You might hate me for saying so but thats all right  
You can hate the whole world but it aint gonna help  
  
Oh Angeline youre only wasting your time  
Looking for my sympathy  
I hope youre satisfied  cause I only want to laugh  
When I hear you cry  
  
You were everything to me  
You were everything to me  
Now hes done it to you  
Like you did it to me  
So baby tell me everything  
  
I guess you never thought that youd be falling in love  
Youve lost everything that youre dreaming of  
I cant let you go without letting you know  
  
You were everything to me  
You were everything to me  
I dont know why but your pain  
Is such a pleasure to see  
So baby tell me everything  
  
Baby tell me everything everything to me  
Baby tell me everything  
Someone did it to you like you did it to me  
So baby tell me everything
