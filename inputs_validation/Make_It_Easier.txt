Im in search of greener pastures  
Dont like my gardens what I said  
Although Im working harder than last year  
Im still deep in the red  
I am rowing as hard as I can  
And theyre selling me up a stream  
Im always one more step away  
From the american dream  
  
I got a chip on my shoulder  
About the size of a mental block  
Ive got someone on the telephone  
Trying to sell me a future in stock  
Maybe I work too hard to be happy  
And I should practice letting go  
But its hard not to rock the boat  
When youre sailing against the undertow  
  
Chorus  
I want to slide into the black  
And wear the black mask  
I might not get what I lack  
But it doesnt hurt to ask  
If I want to sail  
I need my life to be breezier  
I said please god or someone  
Make it easier  
  
I went to Sunday school every Sunday  
Swallowed the bait and I got the hook  
When I needed something someday  
I would read the good book  
Tell me what does it take to get ahead  
Sometimes I know Id sell my soul  
When it looks like everybody else is flying  
And Im crawling in the hole  
  
Well maybe if I open my own business  
Maybe if I buy a lottery ticket  
Someone tell me what is the secret  
To getting out of the thicket  
Give me more than just a sample  
I need a whole lot of glory  
My life become an example  
Of the american success story  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Make it easier  
Make it easier
