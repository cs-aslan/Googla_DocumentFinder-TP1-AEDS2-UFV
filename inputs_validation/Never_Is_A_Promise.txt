Youll never see  
The courage I know  
Its colors richness  
Wont appear within your view  
Ill never glow  
The way that you glow  
Your presence dominates the judgments made on you  
  
But as the scenery grows  
I see in different lights  
The shades and shadows  
Undulate in my perception  
My feelings swell and stretch  
I see from greater heights  
I understand what I am still to proud to mention  
to you  
  
Youll say you understand  
But you dont understand  
Youll say youd never give up  
Seeing eye to eye  
But never is a promise  
And you cant afford to lie  
  
Youll never touch  
These things that I hold  
The skin of my emotions  
Lies beneath my own  
Youll never feel  
The heat of this soul  
My fever burns me deeper than Ive ever shown  
To you  
  
Youll say dont fear your dreams  
Its easier than it seems  
Youll say youd never let me fall  
From hopes so high  
But never is a promise  
And you cant afford to lie  
  
Youll never live the life that I live  
Ill never live the life  
That wakes me in the night  
Youll never hear the message I give  
Youll say it looks as though I might  
Give up this fight  
  
But as the scenery grows  
I see in different lights  
The shades and shadows  
Undulate in my perception  
My feelings swell and stretch  
I see from greater heights  
I realize what I am now too smart to mention  
To you  
  
Youll say you understand  
Youll never understand  
Ill say Ill never wake up  
Knowing how or why  
I dont know what to believe in  
You dont know who I am  
Youll say I need appeasing  
When I start to cry  
But never is a promise  
And Ill never need a lie
