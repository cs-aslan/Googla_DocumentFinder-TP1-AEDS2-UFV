One old brown shoe falls in slow motion  
And the bedsprings hover right above your head  
As bed springs do when youre beneath them  
Someone else just climbed into your bed  
By the time she thought youd probably got to Phoenix  
Shed arranged for your shoes to be filled  
Well youve got your pride and a bluesteel 45  
Waited for the other shoe to fall  
And you waited for the other shoe to fall  
Dig a double grave out in the meadow  
And youll curse the rain that turns the dirt to mud  
Youll take 35 south towards Laredo  
And youll try to find a doctor thatll prescribe an elixir  
Thatll make everything better except your late wife and her lover  
By the time she thought youd probably got to Phoenix  
Shed sealed her fate and gotten herself killed  
Youve got your pride and a bluesteel 45  
Waited for the other shoe to fall  
And you waited for the other shoe to fall  
And you waited for the other shoe to fall
