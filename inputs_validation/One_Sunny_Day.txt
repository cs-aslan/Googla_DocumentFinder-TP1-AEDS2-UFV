Help me baby  
Help me take my blues away  
Help me baby  
Help me take my blues away  
Wake up one morning  
Feel good one sunny day  
Times Ive wondered  
Why it is a lonesome day  
Times Ive wondered  
Why it is a lonesome day  
I see you walking  
See you walking away  
All I want from you  
Is more then I can do  
Theres one thing that I know  
Ill never let you go  
Although the people say  
I shouldnt treat you this way  
Help me baby  
Help me take my blues away  
Wake up one morning  
Feel good one sunny day  
All I want from you  
Is more then I can do  
Theres one thing that I know  
Ill never let you go  
Although the people say  
I shouldnt treat you this way  
Help me baby  
Help me take my blues away  
Wake up one morning  
Feel good one sunny day
