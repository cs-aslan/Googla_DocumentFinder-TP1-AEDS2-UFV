Background voices calling from a distance  
See no evil hear no evil  
Static on the line of least resistance  
Dont say nothing at all  
Dont say nothing at all  
Dont say nothing at all  
Im hanging on a wire waitin on the word  
Im never seen youre never heard  
The object of desire is seldom ever clear  
I reach for you but all I hear  
Are the background voices calling from a distance  
Silent partners listen to the hush  
  
A lover without words is easily deceived  
And rumors easily believed  
The matter of obsession is seldom ever clear  
I turn around you disappear  
In background voices calling from a distance  
Silent partners listen to the hush  
Silent partners  
You know they dont say nothing at all  
  
What about the things we never mention  
What about the things we never say  
Will we wind up targets of affection  
In silence turning silent  
The silent turn away  
  
A paramour or less is never really sure  
Exactly what to listen for  
In secret service to the things they never say  
The Silent partners fade away  
  
To background voices calling from a distance  
Silent partners listen to the hush  
Silent partners  
You know they dont say nothing at all
