How long how long baby  
Can this love of ours go on  
How long how long baby  
Because I know I know youve been doing me wrong  
  
Youve been seen all over town  
Playing the field putting me down  
How long can this go on  
  
How long how long baby  
Must you treat me like a fool  
How long how long baby  
Dont you know youre breakin the rules  
  
Do you think its only a game  
The way that youre acting  
Youll drive me insane  
How long can this go on  
  
I want to know how long how long baby  
Must you tear my soul apart  
How long how long baby  
When you break when you break my heart  
  
Oh wont you change your ways  
Come on back let me hear you say  
That we will start anew  
  
I need you so I need you so  
I need you so whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
