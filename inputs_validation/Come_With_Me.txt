all you need  
is something ill believe  
flashlights in the hall  
but no call  
cause when my day is done  
i find where i belong  
waiting on the curb  
for you to come to carry on  
it wont be long  
well turn around  
i care enough to wake you up  
to make us mine ill make you shine  
  
stay the night  
stay all your life  
just come with me  
  
come with me  
wont you come with me  
come with me again  
come with me  
stay the night  
wont you come with me  
stay all your life  
come with me again  
just come with me  
  
fell so high i broke my jaw  
i couldnt talk to you  
went underground to play around its true  
but i came back  
to get you at that place so i could breathe  
  
its 3 am  
and im up again  
answering the call of all  
the flowers by the bed  
make me wish my head  
was lying and possessed by truth alone a certain home  
a wooden gate a rabbit hole  
well turn around it wont be long  
capture that place wont it be fun  
  
come with me  
stay the night  
wont you come with me  
stay all your life  
come with me again  
just come with me  
come with me  
stay the night  
wont you come with me  
stay all your life  
come with me again  
just come with me  
  
she means more to me  
than any living thing  
younger than the blush of spring she sings  
  
stay the night  
wont you come with me  
stay all your life  
come with me again  
just come with me
