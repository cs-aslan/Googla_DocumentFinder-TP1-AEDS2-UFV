Oh its so good to see you  
I couldnt wait another day  
Oh i hope everyone missed you  
You know they want you to stay  
  
Home in one month  
Couldnt feel better if i tried  
Wont even write  
Its better thatll be a surprise  
I cant expect to be a household word  
I dont mind just let me inside  
I dont expect to be seen or heard  
I wont mind ive nothin to hide  
  
Oh its so good to see you  
I couldnt wait another day  
So good to see you  
Oh i hope everyone missed you  
You know they want you to stay  
  
Home in one week  
Gettin so much closer all the time  
Seems like overnight  
Its better thatll be a surprise  
  
We shouldnt get to be too close friends  
I dont mind ive nothin to hide  
We couldnt get to be too close friends  
You wont mind if youve nothin to hide  
  
Oh its so good to see you  
I couldnt wait another day  
So good to see you  
Oh i hope everyone missed you  
You know they want you to stay

Dont stop to do what youre thinkin  
Youre just wastin your time  
  
Ooh its so good to see you  
I couldnt wait another day  
So good to see you  
Oh i hope everyone missed you  
I really want you to stay
