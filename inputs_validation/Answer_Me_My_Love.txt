Answer me  
Oh my love  
Just what sin have I been guilty of  
Tell me how I came to lose your love  
Please answer me sweetheart  
  
You were mine yesterday  
I believed that love was here to stay  
Wont you tell me how Ive gone astray  
Please answer me my love  
  
If youre happier without me  
Ill try not to care  
But if you still think about me  
Please listen to my prayer  
  
You must know that Ive been true  
Wont you say that we can start anew  
In my sorrow now I turn to you  
Please answer me my love  
  
If youre happier without me

In my sorrow now I turn to you  
Please answer me my love  
Answer me my love
