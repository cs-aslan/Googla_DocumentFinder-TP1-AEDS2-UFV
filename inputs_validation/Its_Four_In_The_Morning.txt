Its four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
Wishin Id never met her knowing if I forget her  
How much better off she would be  
  
The longer I hold on the longer this goes on  
The harder that its going to be  
But its four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
Id never desert her God knows when I hurt her  
Thats the last thing that I want to do  
She tries but she cant tell how she feels  
But I know too well just what shes going through  
  
If I love her so much I dont know why I cant do  
The right thing and just let her be  
But its four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
Last night I told her This time its all over  
Making two times Ive told her goodbye  
Last night we broke up this morning I woke up  
And for the fifth time Im changing my mind  
  
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her  
Than most foolish men will ever see  
An its four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
Its four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
Wishin Id never met her
