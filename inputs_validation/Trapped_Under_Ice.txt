I dont know how to live trough this hell  
Woken up Im still locked in this shell  
Frozen soul frozen down to the core  
Break the ice I cant take anymore  
  
Freezing  
Cant move at all  
Screaming  
Cant hear my call  
I am dying to live  
Cry out  
Im trapped under the ice  
  
Crystallized as I lay here and rest  
Eyes of glass stare directly at death  
From deep sleep I have broken away  
No one knows no one hears what I say  
  
Freezing  
Cant move at all  
Screaming  
Cant hear my call  
I am dying to live  
Cry out  
Im trapped under the ice  
  
Scream from my soul  
Fate mystified  
Hell forever more  
  
No release from my cryonic state  
What is this Ive been stricken by fate  
Wrapped up tight cannot move cant break free  
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me  
  
Freezing  
Cant move at all  
Screaming  
Cant hear my call  
I am dying to live  
Cry out  
Im trapped under the ice
