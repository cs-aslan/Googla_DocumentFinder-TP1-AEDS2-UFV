Ill be there for you  
You dont have to feel alone  
Like a shadow by your side  
Ill be with you right or wrong  
  
You stumble and you fall  
But you can always lean on me  
Ill be there to see you through  
Ill be there for you  
  
Ill be there for you  
When your dreams seem far away  
Even in the darkest night  
You can face the world unafraid  
  
And if you close your eyes  
You will feel me next to you  
No matter what youre going through  
Ill be there for you  
  
Here today here tomorrow  
Through the joy laughter and sorrow  
Youre in my heart were kindred souls  
If you could read my mind  
Youd know  
  
Ill be there for you  
The one who comes to your rescue  
Im the one youll never leave  
Ill be there for you  
No matter what
