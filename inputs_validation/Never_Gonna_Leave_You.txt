I know sometimes youre scared of the light  
But how will you ever know if you never try  
Theres something new inside my heart  
And it grabs like a child whenever were apart  
I see your face under every sky  
I find the less I look more I find  
So lets go back there back to the star  
You know Im never gonna leave you  
Youre the only one I want  
Lets go back there back to the star  
You know Im never gonna leave you  
Youre the only one I want  
  
You know sometimes that Im scared of the dark  
But Im feeling sun babe when Im in your arms  
You said my name in the dead of glory  
You hold me alright  
When Im short of falling  
  
So lets go back there back to the star  
You know Im never gonna leave you  
Youre the only one I want  
Lets go back there back to the star  
You know Im never gonna leave you  
Youre the only one I want  
  
There will be times  
When well try to give it up  
Bursting out it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to
pieces  
And well watch them turn to dust  
But without each other nothing is easy enough  
  
So lets go back there back to the star  
You know Im never gonna leave you  
Youre the only one I want  
Lets go back there back to the star  
You know Im never gonna leave you  
cause youre the only one I want yeah  
Youre the only one  
Never gonna leave you  
No Im never gonna leave you no
