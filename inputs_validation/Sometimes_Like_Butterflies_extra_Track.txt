Well I told ya not to fall in love  
I aint the kind you can tie down  
You went did it anyway  
As though Id done ya harm  
And each time I went reaching out  
Thats when you let go  
Now dont try and pretend  
That you didnt know  
Chorus  
If you wanna hold me  
If you wanna love me  
Come on baby set me free  
Ive got to be free  
If you wanna hold me  
If you wanna love me  
Butterflies were made to fly  
Ive got to be free  
Sometimes like butterflies  
Oh dont hold me no no  
Well I told you right from the beginning  
I couldnt stay for love  
I had to go  
Now its not because in my heart  
Baby I dont love you  
Its just because Im meant to be  
Im meant to be free  
Reapeat chorus  
Now its not because in my heart  
Baby I dont love you  
Its only that Im meant to be  
Im meant to be free  
If you wanna love me  
If you wanna hold me  
Come on baby set me free  
Ive got to be free  
If you wanna hold me  
If you wanna love me  
Butterflies were made to fly  
Ive got to be free  
Sometimes like butterflies
