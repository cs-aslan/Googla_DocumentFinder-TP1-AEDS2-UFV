Aint love been good to us aint it been good  
Its given us happiness and were knockin on wood  
Were livin in sunshine like we knew that we could  
Aint love been wonderful oh aint it been good  
  
We walk through life side by side  
We found the door to happiness open wide  
And folks who gather now right where we stand  
And loves been heaven here on earth in every ways  
  
The world is troubled in many ways  
It seems the problem always are here to stay  
But well keep holdin on till the very end  
And well get by no matter what shape the world is in  
  
Aint love been good to us aint it been good  
Its given us happiness and were knockin on wood  
Were livin in sunshine like we knew that we could  
Aint love been wonderful oh aint it been good
