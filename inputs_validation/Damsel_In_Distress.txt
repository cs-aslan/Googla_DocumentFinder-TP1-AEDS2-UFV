Ooh you got big muscles rippling  
Underneath your shirt  
Im so glad to meet you baby  
Tell me what do you do for work  
  
Me Im just a housewife  
So sad and all alone  
Desperate for a strong man  
To help me fix my home  
  
I know I must look a sight  
In this this flimsy little dress  
Wont you try your very best  
To save a damsel in distress  
  
Ive got tasty treats to tempt you  
Come and sit down on my couch  
Im sure it wont take long  
To figure all my problems out  
  
My home it needs attention  
Its such a big old mess  
Take out your trusty tool  
And save this damsel in distress  
  
Now you need no invitation baby  
Just walk in and shut the door  
Follow the red rose petals  
That Ive left scattered on the floor  
  
Ill be upstairs waiting  
With a list of honeydos  
Customized and tailormade  
For a a handy man like you  
  
You know Id be so grateful  
If youd come relieve my stress  
Wont you heed my SOS  
And save a damsel in distress  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
  
So sweet  
I got the need if youre willing to please  
Trust me  
I make it so good that you wont wanna leave  
  
I got tasty treats to tempt you  
Come and sit down on my couch  
Im sure it wont take long  
To figure all my problems out  
  
My home it needs attention  
Its such a big old mess  
Take out your trusty tool  
And save this damsel in distress  
  
Now whats a girl to do  
Im just a a damsel in in distress yeah  
Oh little old me baby  
What you want for dinner baby  
Oh yeah
