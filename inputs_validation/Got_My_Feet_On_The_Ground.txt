I want to lot out of life but I know my limitations  
Guess I want a lot of things and got my inclinations  
Got my feet on the ground and Im standing on my own  
I dont need no one  
I dont need no one  
  
Ive learned a lot out of life watchin other folks mistakes  
Funny things that they can get for finding out too late  
I got my feet on the ground and Im standing on my own  
I dont need no one  
I dont need no one  
  
Well I dont need nobody else  
All I needs a single ticket  
When I travel on my own  
Not afraid to be alone  
I got my feet upon the ground and Im standing on my own  
When I travel far and wide  
And looking for a four leaf clover  
Dont mind if I cant find it got no chip upon my shoulder  
Got my feet on the ground and Im standing on my own  
I dont need no one  
I dont need no one  
  
Well I dont need nobody else  
All I needs a single ticket  
When I travel on my own  
Not afraid to be alone  
I got my feet upon the ground and Im standing on my own  
When I travel far and wide  
And looking for a four leaf clover  
Dont mind if I cant find it got no chip upon my shoulder  
Got my feet on the ground and Im standing on my own  
I dont need no one  
I dont need no one  
repeat
