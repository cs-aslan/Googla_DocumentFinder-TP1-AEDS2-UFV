Im a shy girl my mother calls me flatchest  
Im a heavy boy my father calls me a fathead  
Im a small guy my friends call me an armrest  
Im a big girl the boys call me a waterbed  
  
I love all of me I love all of me  
I love all of me I just wanna be  
  
Im a yellow girl you choose to call me slanted eyes  
Im a white boy who fights for his roots and ties  
Im a red woman who cries over her childs hunger  
Im a black man whos come to terms with his anger  
  
I love all of me I love all of me  
I love all of me I just wanna be  
  
Im a nomad who writes his words in sand  
Im an aborigine who wishes to save his clan  
Im all people who cry for their land  
People of the world walking hand in hand

Live and let live live and let live  
  
Phew the cross we carry is so heavy  
I wanna sit down for a second do you mind  
Not lie down just sit down  
Not too long just so long  
Hey I got an I dare cant we just burn the crosses instead of people  
I happen to think thats healthy and its not blasphemy  
So brush your wings shine your rings  
And we can sing  
Are you ready

I love all love me  
I love all of me  
I love all love me
