If I was a road dog baby  
All of my songs were true  
Reckon Id like my whiskey drinkin  
a whole lot more than I do  
But I dont know about the good life baby  
Not so sure its for me  
Id much rather be home rollin with you  
Than watching Tom Snyder on TV  
  
I wish I was a big rig  
Rollin on home to you  
I wish I was a big rig  
Big rig baby rollin on home to you  
  
Now I been to lots of parties  
Spent my whole life in a bar  
Theres a whole lot of good lookin women out there  
Who think I am a star  
Drinkin and a smokin aint really where I am  
If I had my own two ways Id be rollin home to Alabam  
  
I wish I was a big rig  
Rollin on home to you  
I wish I was a big rig  
A big rig baby rollin on home to you  
  
Now some day Ill be better  
My ramblin days will be through  
I wont have anymore gigs to play  
Ill be back home there with you  
But meanwhile wait a minute  
Whats that thing I see  
Its a good lookin woman with a bottle of Scotch  
And she wants to go home with me  
  
Shes lookin like a big rig  
Rollin on home to you  
I wish I was big rig a big rig baby  
Rollin on home to you  
I wish I was a big rig  
Rollin on home to you  
I wish I was a big rig  
Rollin on home to you
