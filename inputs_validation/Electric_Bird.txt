Someone plugged you in  
And sadly they clipped your wings  
Now you cant fly away electric bird  
Yeah someone took your tweet  
One day they fed you that bad seed  
You cant fly away electric bird  
  
Well youre art you fell into this part  
You play the victim perfectly holding your beating heart  
You used to be so smart  
You fluttered round the yard making your magic  
  
Got to set you free you were blinded by deceit  
You cant fly away electric bird  
So now this rooms all staged  
While youre stuck there in that cage  
You cant fly away electric bird  
  
Well youre art you fell into this part  
You play the victim perfectly holding your beating heart  
You used to be so smart  
You fluttered round the yard making your magic
