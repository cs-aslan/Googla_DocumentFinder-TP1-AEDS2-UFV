Now baby if youre needin me  
The way that I been needin you  
Well drop me a line  
Sayin honey youll be mine  
Write me in care of the blues  
  
I hope that youve been missin me  
The way that Ive been missin you  
I shouldnt have let you go  
Because I miss you so  
Write me in care of the blues  
  
Give that postman your letter  
And hell know what to do  
Hell bring your letter to me  
And a plane will bring me to you  
  
Now baby if youre needin me  
The way that I been needin you  
Just drop me a line  
Sayin honey youll be mine  
Write me in care of the blues  
  
Repeat last two verses
