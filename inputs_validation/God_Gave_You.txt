For all the times I felt cheated I complained  
You know how I love to complain  
For all the wrongs I repeated though I was to blame  
I still cursed that rain  
I didnt have a prayer didnt have a clue  
Then out of the blue  
  
God gave me you to show me whats real  
Theres more to life than just how I feel  
And all that Im worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didnt know why  
Now I do cause God gave me you  
  
For all the times I wore my self pity like a favorite shirt  
All wrapped up in that hurt  
For every glass I saw I saw half empty  
Now it overflows like a river through my soul  
From every doubt I had Im finally free  
I truly believe  
  
God gave me you to show me whats real  
Theres more to life than just how I feel  
And all that Im worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didnt know why  
Now I do cause God gave me you  
  
In your arms Im someone new  
With ever tender kiss from you  
Oh must confess  
Ive been blessed  
  
God gave me you to show me whats real  
Theres more to life than just how I feel  
And all that Im worth is right before my eyes  
And all that I live for though I didnt know why  
Didnt know why  
Now I do cause God gave me you  
I finally do God gave me you  
  
God gave me you
