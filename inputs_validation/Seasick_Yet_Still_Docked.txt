I am a poor freezingly cold soul  
So far from where  
I intended to go  
Scavenging through lifes very constant lulls  
So far from where Im determined to go  
  
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love  
There is no way   
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love  
But you see Ive got no charm  
Mmm  
  
Tonight Ive consumed much more than I can hold  
Oh this is very clear to you  
And you can tell I have never really loved  
You can tell by the way I sleep all day  
  
And all of my life noone gave me anything  
Noone has ever given me anything  
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye  
You must be such a fool  
To pass me by
