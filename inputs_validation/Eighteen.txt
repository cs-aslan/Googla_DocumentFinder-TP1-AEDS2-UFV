Lines form on my face and hands  
Lines form from the ups and downs  
Im in the middle without any plans  
Im a boy and Im a man  
  
Im eighteen  
And I dont know what I want  
Eighteen  
I just dont know what I want  
Eighteen  
I gotta get away  
I gotta get out of this place  
Ill go runnin in outer space  
Oh yeah  
  
I got a  
Babys brain and an old mans heart  
Took eighteen years to get this far  
Dont always know what Im talkin about  
Feels like Im livin in the middle of doubt  
Cause Im  
  
Eighteen  
I get confused every day  
Eighteen  
I just dont know what to say  
Eighteen  
I gotta get away  
  
Lines form on my face and my hands  
Lines form on the left and right  
Im in the middle  
The middle of life  
Im a boy and Im a man  
Im eighteen and I like it  
Yes I like it  
Oh I like it  
Love it  
Like it  
Love it  
Eighteen  
Eighteen  
Eighteen  
Eighteen and I like it
