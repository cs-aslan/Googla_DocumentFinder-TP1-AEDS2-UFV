Im as fake as e wedding cake  
And Im Vague and I know that Im homopolitan  
Pitifully predictable  
Correctly political  
  
Im the new Im the new new model  
Ive got nothing inside  
Better in the head and in bed  
At the office  
I can suck and I smile  
New new new model  
  
I can choke and diet on coke  
Im Spun and I know  
That Im Stoned and Rolling  
  
Lifelike and poseable  
Hopeless and disposable  
  
Im the new Im the new new model  
Ive got nothing inside  
Better in the head and in bed  
At the office  
I can suck and I smile  
New new new model  
  
Dont let them know how far you go  
Or that you use you lovers  
Oh look youre like a vcr  
Stick something in to know  
Just who you are you  
  
New new new model
