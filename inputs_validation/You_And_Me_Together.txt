Looks like we found ourselves  
Up against a wall  
In need of a little help  
But no one wants to call  
After all weve been through  
Do we let our friendship end  
You need me and I need you  
No we will not break  
Never break  
But even if we bend  
  
Yeah its  
Chorus  
YOU AND ME TOGETHER together together together  
ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE on your side  
NO ONE NO ONE NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE IT  
CMON LET EM TRY let em try  
CAUSE ITS YOU AND ME TOGETHER NOW  
  
Anyone can have a day  
When their heart is on their sleeve  
No one wants to see a way  
And agree to disagree  
Youd think itd be easier  
But it feels like you just cant win  
But somehow well make it work  
Cause we deserve it we know were worth it  
You cant give up on friends  
  
Cause its  
Repeat Chorus  
  
TOGETHER NOW  
Oh now now now  
  
Its  
YOU AND ME TOGETHER together together together  
ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE on your side  
Oh whoawhoa  
NO ONE NO ONE NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE IT  
CMON LET EM TRY let em try  
  
Its  
YOU its you AND ME and me TOGETHER together together together  
Yeah Im ALWAYS ON YOUR SIDE on your on your side  
NO ONE NO ONE NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE IT  
CMON LET EM TRY  
Let em try  
Cuz its you and me together ahahahahah  
Together now now
