Could I fall in love for the very first time  
Thats what I ask myself when youre lips touch mine  
Could I fall in love on a night like tonight  
Thats what Id like to know when I hold you tight  
  
Now that were alone Now that were alone  
Just a kiss apart Just a kiss apart  
I have the answer from the feeling in my heart  
Could I fall in love and forever be true  
My heart tells me I could if I fell for you
