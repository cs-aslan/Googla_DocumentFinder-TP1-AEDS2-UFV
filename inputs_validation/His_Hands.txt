His hands paint the flowers  
He puts leaves on the trees  
At his whisper birds start singing  
When my heart needs melodies  
  
Why I strayed from all his goodness  
My poor mind cant understand  
Im to blame for my misfortune  
I lost hold of his hands  
  
Those hands that gave me mercy  
When Im wrong as wrong can be  
If they really gave me justice  
Id be lost on homeless sea  
  
Ive been lost in the shuffle  
Ive obeyed the wrong commands  
Im going back to the chapel  
In search of his hands  
Those hands that gave me mercy
