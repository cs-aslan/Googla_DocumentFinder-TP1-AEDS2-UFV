Oh its cryin time again youre gonna leave me  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
That it wont be long before its cryin time  
Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder  
Oh its cryin time again youre gonna leave me  
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin  
Well my love for you could never be stronger  
And that tears are only rain to make love grow  
If I lived to be a hundred years old  
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
Now you say youve found someone that you love better  
That it wont be long before its cryin time  
Cryin time will start when you walk out the door  
Thats the way its happened every time before  
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
That it wont be long before its cryin time  
Oh its cryin time again youre gonna leave me  
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin  
Yea it wont be long before its cryin time
