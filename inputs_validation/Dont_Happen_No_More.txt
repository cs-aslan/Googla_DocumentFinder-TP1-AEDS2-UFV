Well there used to be a time when a man was a king  
To work for a man was a womans only dream  
Everything he did was perfectly alright  
He didnt have to worry about fussin and fightin  
It dont happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
Its a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed  
  
There used to be a time when a woman couldnt smoke  
There used to be a time when a woman couldnt vote  
She used to stay at home while the man went out to play  
She was satisfied with life any old way  
  
It dont happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
Its a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed  
Well well  
  
There used to be a time when a woman couldnt cook  
There used to be a time she didnt worry about her looks  
She used to sip on sassafrass she didnt even drink  
She didnt try to tell her man how to think  
  
It dont happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
Its a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
It dont happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
Its a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed  
  
It dont happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
Its a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed
