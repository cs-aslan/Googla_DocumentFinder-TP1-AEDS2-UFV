In my house theres a circle where the life comes in  
From the stars to my home down through the stone  
I could have been so alone  
Without my precious box  
Have I a family I guess not  
Ive never seen a lot of beauty  
In my life  
  
Well in your house there are servants and the lights all dim  
Such a beautiful home your agents on the phone they never  
Leave you alone  
The party never stops  
You say thats fantasy I say So what I need a little  
Beauty  
  
So let me in  
You know youve kind of got under my skin  
You know we never see a lot of the action round here  
My dear  
You may want to strip again  
  
And you look so fine in your Gucci suit  
And youre making more money than your daddy  
Could have imagined  
But people can go out of fashion honey yeah any time  
  
So take that picture stop acting so dumb  
Dont you know that the moment will come  
I will find someone like you  
But with something extra Im sorry baby  
I dont know why  
I dont know why that is  
  
The systematic breakdown of my community  
You know I hate my job I try to save but God  
Theres just never enough  
Switch on the pressure stops  
You know the one for me shes on Fox  
And shes a little beauty  
  
Give me your life give me your life I want it  
Because lately its so freezing out here  
This side of the glass life keeps kicking my ass  
In so many ways but you make it good  
Made me the kind of happy that my baby never could  
This side of the glass  
  
So take that picture stop acting so dumb  
Dont you know that the moment will come  
I will find someone like you  
But with something extra Im so sorry baby  
I dont know why  
I dont know why that is  
  
Precious keeps me company  
Keeps me from being alone  
  
Because noone comes in the morning  
Noone comes in the evening time  
Id sit and wait for the phone to ring  
I could be waiting my whole damn life  
  
So sick of the same old faces  
In this street where nobody talks to me  
And the funny side of the situation is  
I dont care Ill always be there  
  
When you come down from the sky  
And make yourself at home  
In my house  
  
Because these days its the money the money  
The money honey or your life  
I said dont you know you cant have both  
  
Stop acting so dumb  
The moment will come  
I will find someone like you  
Something extra always happens baby to me sorry baby  
I dont know why something  
Said I dont know why that is  
  
You may want to strip again  
You may want to let me in  
You may want to sacrifice  
More than you think is fair or right  
  
You may want to think again  
You may want to watch your friends  
You may want to change your mind  
You may wish you could turn back time
