She talks like thunder  
She really lets you know  
She keep changing the rules  
And leave you nowhere to go  
She bore you rigid with the party line  
Shes so far left shes gonna get left behind  
  
He wants six pretty white spots on each side of the dice  
He wants it all to be equal but he needs to throw twice  
Now theres a guy in the corner with a smiling gaze  
He turns to me and says  
Im gonna buy a hat  
cause I think its gonna rain  
Got caught out coming here  
Aint gonna get caught again  
Im gonna buy a big one  
Like that Mr Gorbachov  
And when its raining all this crap  
Oh my hat will keep it off  
  
Now take a look at all them leaders  
Desperation in their eyes  
The tight faces smiles that cannot hide it  
They know no more than you or I  
  
So Im gonna buy a hat  
cause here they come again  
And when the start to blahblah  
Its you and me that gets the rain
