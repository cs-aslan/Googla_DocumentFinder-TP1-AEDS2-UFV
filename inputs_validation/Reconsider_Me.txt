If youre all alone  
And you need someone  
Call me up  
And Ill come running  
Reconsider me  
Reconsider me  
  
If its still the past  
That makes you doubt  
Darlin that was then  
And this is now  
  
Reconsider me  
Reconsider me  
And Ill never make you sad again  
Cause I swear that Ive changed since then  
And I promise that Ill never make you cry  
  
Lets let bygones  
Be forgotten  
Reconsider me  
Reconsider me  
You can go and be  
What you want to be  
And itll be alright  
  
If we disagree  
Im the one who cares  
And I hope youll see  
That Im the one who loves you  
Reconsider me  
  
Lets let bygones  
Be forgotten  
Reconsider me  
Reconsider me  
And Ill never make you sad again  
Cause I swear that Ive changed since then  
  
And Ill never make you sorry if youll try  
And Ill never make you sad again  
Cause I swear that Ive changed since then  
And I promise that Ill never make you cry
