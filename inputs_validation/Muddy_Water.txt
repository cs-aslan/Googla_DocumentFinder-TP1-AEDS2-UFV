Mary grab the baby the rivers rising  
Muddy water taking back the land  
The oldframe house she cant takea one more beating  
Aint no use to stay and make a stand  
  
  
Well the morning light shows water in the valley  
Daddys grave just went below the line  
Things to say you just cant take em with ya  
This flood will swallow all youve left behind  
  
  
Wont be back to start all over  
Cause what I felt before is gone  
  
  
Mary take the child the rivers rising  
Muddy water taking back my home  
The road is gone theres just one way to leave here  
Turn my back on what Ive left below  
Shifting land broken farms around me  
Muddy waters changing all I know  
  
  
Its hard to say just what Im losing  
Aint never felt so all alone  
  
  
Mary take the child the rivers rising  
Muddy water taking back my home  
  
  
Wont be back to start all over  
Cause what I felt before is gone  
  
  
Mary take the child the rivers rising  
Muddy waters changing all I know  
Muddy waters changing all I know  
Lord this muddy water is taking back my home
