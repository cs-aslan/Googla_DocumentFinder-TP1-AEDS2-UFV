Beams of light up in the sky  
Malfunctioned machinery lost in time  
Dont understand Im wondering why  
How can this happen its so out of line  
Strangers among us  
From beyond the stars  
Whatever you know keep your silence  
Unearthly ones from galaxies afar  
There will be violence  
  
They know something  
That we dont know  
What cannot be seen theyll never show  
Hangar eighteen Area fifty one  
  
Hangar eighteen  
  
For me to recall they hypnotize  
Its all part of investigations  
They say that I just fantasize  
Just try to explain mutilations  
  
They know something  
That we dont know  
What cannot be seen theyll never show  
Hangar eighteenArea fifty one  
Were victims of grand illusion  
Now were lost in mass confusion  
Hangar eighteenArea fifty one  
  
Hangar eighteen  
  
Hangar eighteen  
  
They know something  
That we dont know  
What cannot be seen theyll never show  
Hangar eighteenArea fifty one  
Were victims of grand illusion  
Now were lost in mass confusion  
Hangar eighteenArea fifty one  
  
Hangar eighteen
