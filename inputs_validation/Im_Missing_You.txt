By the time you read this letter  
Ill be gone  
Im not the man I was when I left home  
By the time you see my face  
I will have aged  
Much more than the passing of the days  
  
This many miles might as well be the moon  
Its a desolate place and Im missing you  
My heart cant believe what my eyes they have seen  
God knows whats pulling us through  
In a world gone insane Ive whispered your name  
Im missing you  
  
Sometimes in the quiet of the night  
I reach for you as if youre by my side  
When everything around me seems all gone  
The thought of holding you keeps me hangin on  
  
This many miles might as well be the moon  
Its a desolate place and Im missing you  
My heart cant believe what my eyes they have seen  
God knows whats pulling us through  
In a world gone insane Ive whispered your name  
OhIm missing you  
In a world gone insane I whisper your name  
Im missing you
