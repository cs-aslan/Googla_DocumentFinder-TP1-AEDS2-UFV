I dream theres nothing thats too tough  
Theres nothing thats hard enough  
For me and you to get through  
And I know that with your hand in mine  
Theres not a goal we cant reach in time  
Life can bring us down you see  
Sometimes its been our destiny  
But I foresee possibilities  
For you and me ohh  
I can hold the faith I know  
That will see us through it all  
I have had a dream  
I have had a dream  
You and I can  
Get through anything  
Get through anything  
Dont you ever say never because  
I have dreamed a dream  
I have dreamed a dream  
I know I know we can  
Get passed everything ohh no  
I feel all can become real  
Nothings too impossible  
For us to do ohh and  
I see endless opportunities  
We can reach oh if we both believe ohh  
Sometimes hopings not enough  
The paths ahead can be so tough  
But if we stay confident well see  
A brighter day ohh  
I can hold the faith I know  
That will see us through the end  
Ohh ooh oh yeah yeah  
I have had a dream  
I have had a dream  
You and I can  
Get through anything  
Get through anything  
Dont you ever say never because  
I have dreamed a dream  
I have dreamed a dream  
I know we can  
Get passed everything ohh no  
I have dreamed a dream  
I have dreamed and dream  
You and I  
Can get through anything  
Get through anything  
Dont you ever say never because  
I have dreamed a dream  
I have dreamed a dream  
I know we can oh  
Get passed everything ohh yeah oh
