Hey do you know whats going on  
Do you  
Come on play it  
Are you awake  
Have you anything to say  
Are you aware of what surrounds you  
And all the times you tried to please everyone  
Can you admit it doesnt matter  
Ooh theres never a dull moment in my life  
And I dont mind the ride  
Dont live a lifeless life  
When you could be living it right  
Dont be one to be led  
Its a heavy world in my small world  
Get up get out of bed  
Ooh theres never a dull moment in my life  
And I dont mind the ride  
  
Dont you know its only life  
Its only life  
Taking you on a constant flight  
Dont you know that its only life  
There is no wrong there could be no right  
Whatever youre doing  
However youre doing it  
Youll be living your life  
Yes its only life  
So there is no wrong no right  
Ooh its a constant flight  
  
Movin on  
Are you awake  
I dont think I heard the answer  
Is there no one on the other line  
No  
Its a heavy world in my small world  
But Im feeling just fine  
Ooh theres never a still moment in my life  
And I dont mind the ride  
  
Life  
Dont you know  
Its only life  
Its only life  
Im crying  
Im crying  
Dont you know its only life  
Taking you on a constant flight  
Dont you know that its only life  
There is no wrong there could be no right  
Whatever youre doin  
However youre doing it  
Youll be living your life  
Dont you know its only life  
  
And everyone pushes to get by  
We go here  
Were going there  
Somebody tell me why  
Dont you know that its only life  
There is no wrong  
There could be no right  
Whatever youre doing  
However youre doing  
Youll be living your life  
Dont you know its only life  
Dont you know its only life
