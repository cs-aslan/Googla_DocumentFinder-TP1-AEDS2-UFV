Im incredible I mix up shit like cake mix  
Keep it blazin hot rhymes burn to keep you frost bit  
Mcs is assedout cause they lost it  
Peep my foundation the way I reinforce it  
I monitor movements precisely  
Makin niggas hit high notes like the Eisleys  
Finally some bitches I can touch up  
Tie em to the grill of my Six pop the clutch up  
Hush up I rush up inside your cut  
Make you puss up then bust up cause my shit bumps  
This Dons Trumps kill straight cats and all chumps  
Cause Life is like a box of chocolate Mr Gump  
Uh the ultimatum lets abbreviate em  
Ll platinum again dont you hate Im  
A thin line between darkness and sunshine  
Five Percenters that was raised on swine  
Known to be wise and you wise to understand  
Bringin me drama is a handstand in quicksand  
Ive been hot so long Im immune  
Your rap career get cut short like PoomPooms  
  
Chorus Keith Murray Ll Cool J  
  
Now from the streets to the suites and all around the world  
They all recognize we Incredible  
We can stand in the water and cant get wet  
You can bet your last dollar we Incredible  
We gets it on in the worst way  
All the homeboys and the girls say we Incredible  
From one brother to another  
They agree with each other lyrically we both Incredible  
  
Keith Murray  
  
Adios mios Montageune  
Were too hot to hold and too bold to be controlled  
Your only skindeep my ugly comes from the soul  
I find the leaks and E plug the holes  
I have more beef than filet mignon  
But got smart and flushed the bullshit down the Como  
Rappers just started rappin last week get a deal next week  
And go platinum next month  
But pass the blunt so I can stay hy like dro  
Dont act like you dont know Im about to fly a flow  
Im three from three from a threepoint land  
With more devastation than a nigga can withstand  
Remember me Untouched by any emcee  
I add verbal assault to your mental injury  
Cause Im the vogit toat it quote it  
Five0 said freeze man I blowed it  
Ryhme strategies no ones bad as this  
I sew up the populace like a seamstress  
A prisoner doing time and the bit  
A grown man and dont play with no kids
