Im puttin on my favorite cowboy boots  
Like a crazy bull rider comin out of the chute  
Im ready for some dancin maybe too much beer  
Little bareback rubbins goin on in here  
Hey little cowgirl leave the Stetson on  
Lets cowboy up and down honey all night long  
She said her name was Levitra Marcantonio  
Im a bare back rider okie dont you know  
These frozen margaritas are goin to my head  
I could not believe it when Levitra said  
Hey Mr Cowboy come on and take me home  
Gonna cowboy up and down honey all night long  
All night long oh youre comin on strong  
All night long come on and do me wrong do me wrong baby  
Hey little cowgirl leave just your Stetson on  
Gonna cowboy up and down honey all night long  
Hey little cowgirl leave just your Stetson on  
Gonna cowboy up and down till Levitras gone
