Frank Sinatra died today  
I came home and found my mama crying  
The tv had so much to say  
Somehow I was thinking about dying  
Im seventeen and thinking about dying  
I dont want to live forever  
Just want to know that Im alive  
Dont want to live forever  
Just until the day I die  
I see my daddy in his chair  
He sits there night and day  
The tv still looks good as new  
Daddys old and gray  
And its scaring me to death  
I dont want to go that way  
I dont want to live forever  
Just want to know that Im alive  
Dont want to live forever  
Just until the day I die  
Just because your hearts still beating  
It dont mean that youre alive  
Dont want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
Gonna live while Im alive  
You can see the glass halfempty  
You can see the glass halffull  
But all I see are shattered dreams  
Around this neighborhood  
My brothers girlfriends pregnant  
And today shes moving in  
My friends all play the lottery  
And swear one day theyll win  
Im seventeen Im thinking about dying  
Im seventeen no way Im dying  
Dont want to live forever  
Just want to know that Im alive  
Dont want to live forever  
Just until the day I die  
Just because youre breathing  
It dont mean that youre alive  
Dont want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
I dont want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
Dont want to live forever  
I dont want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
I dont want to live forever  
Dont want to live forever  
I dont want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
I dont want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
I dont want to live forever
