Through ugly pints and Sunday breath  
Sit men whose stare is cold as death  
Through wide lapels and glued up eyes  
Through made up kids and made up wives  
Sitting in the heart of them  
Is a man whos not like other men  
Dont you know just who I am  
A nod a wink I am the domino man  
  
And if you pull a double one  
Ill pack my bags and Ill be gone  
If you pull a three and four  
Im flying off to Singapore  
Where women dance and tigers roar  
Im lying on a distant shore  
Im living life just as as I can  
A nod a wink another drink I am the domino man  
  
Through a twenty deep screen of humorists  
Through slavering jaws and angry fists  
Through tales of mishap and the clicketyclack  
Is fully paid member of the brother of the tap  
  
Through heavy smoke and idle bets  
Through heaving lungs and heavy debts  
Sits a man who knows he can  
A nod a wink I am the domino man  
  
And if you pull a two and a six  
Ill pack my bags and take that risk  
And if you pull a four and five  
Theyll never take this man alive  
Ill go far east and Ill survive  
The market streets Ill duck and dive  
Im living life as fast as I can  
A nod a wink another drink I am the domino man  
  
And when hes off to sail the seven seas  
He just stay indoors or hides up trees  
Hes been to places that youve never seen  
But his mind is blank and his passports clean  
  
But if you pull a two and a six  
Ill pack my bags and take that risk  
And if you pull a four and five  
Theyll never take this man alive  
Ill go far east and Ill survive  
The market street Ill duck and dive  
Im living life just as fast as I can  
A nod a wink another drink I am the domino man
