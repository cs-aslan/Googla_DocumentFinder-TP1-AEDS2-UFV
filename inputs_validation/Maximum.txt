Maximum maximum power on my side  
But its minimum minimum without you  
Maximum maximum power on my side  
But its minimum minimum without you  
Its my therapy you can never understand  
What it means to me Im an Ironman  
Its my therapy its a battle inside of me  
Its a battle I fight for my family  
Chorus  
Its my therapy its my way of curing me  
Its my recipe for my liberty  
Its my therapy its too hard to understand  
What Im going throu Im a happy man  
Chorus  
Chorus  
But its minimum without you
