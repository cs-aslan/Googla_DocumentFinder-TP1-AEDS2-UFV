Faint light of dawn  
Im listening to you breathing in and breathing out  
Needing nothing  
Youre honey dipped  
You are beautiful floating clouds soft world  
I cant feel my lips  
  
Im going down I dont want to change  
Im going down going down the drain  
  
Chorus  
Dont bring me down I beg you  
Dont bring me down I wont let you  
Dont bring me down  
  
Then all of thats annulled and Im anyones everyones  
We are one  
Your face becomes the sun  
And Im addicted to the joy that the little things  
Those little things  
The little things they bring  
  
Im going down I dont want to change  
Im going down going down the drain  
  
Chorus  
  
So now for restless mind I could go either way  
  
Oh but Im going down I dont wanna change  
Im going down going down the drain  
  
Dont bring me down I beg you  
Dont bring me down I wont let you  
Dont bring me down I beg you  
Dont bring me down dont let me  
Dont bring me down  
Dont bring me down I wont let you  
Dont bring me down  
  
Theres nothing left to choose  
Oh I fight a word I am right here  
Stay the night protect me
