Can we talk about automatic satisfaction  
Sittin back relaxin floored  
Whats wrong with kickin it  
When youre bored and lit  
Lets smoke some cigarettes  
And catch up on the back porch  
Fire up another roach  
  
We dont need a rest this is just a test  
cause were alright were up all night  
To see the sun come up again now  
Just one more time no reason why  
To see the sun come up again  
  
The more we try to change  
The more we stay the same  
Were caught up in the game and now  
Just like empty picture frames  
So now were to blame  
  
Said we were gettin down on henessey and fountain  
Smelled another mountain now  
If you aint gettin down youll come around  
And were alright were up all night  
To see the sun come up again now  
Just one more time no reason why  
To see the sun come up again  
  
So lets smoke some cigarettes  
And catch up on the back porch  
Fire up another roach  
  
We dont need a rest its just a test  
And as the world spins well watch it with a grin  
And look in as the day begins  
Well now its on again its dawn again  
Yeah Yeah  
And were alright  
Were up all night  
  
To see the sun come up again now  
Just one more time no reason why  
To see the sun come up again  
Yeah were alright yeah were alright  
Yeah were alright up all night  
Yeah were alright yeah were alright  
To see the sun come up again now
