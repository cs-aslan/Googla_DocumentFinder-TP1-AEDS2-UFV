Baby youve got to be from a different world  
Cause just one look from you could make an army surrender  
Baby youve got to rescue me girl girl  
A prisoner in love with the opposite gender  
  
I aint sayin youre better baby but I aint sayin youre not  
I aint sayin anything until you stop  
Never forget that cause baby Ill be your jack of all trades  
A mind and body well made  
  
Crucial  baby our love has got to be  
Crucial  everything from A to Z  
Crucial  youve got to show me everything everything everything  
  
Is that Old Man River knockin at your door  
Sayin that we got to let more than our feelings show  
Baby tonight dont hold nothin back I know youve got some more  
Ill give you mine if you give me yours  
  
I aint sayin youre better baby I aint sayin youre not  
I aint sayin anything until you stop  
Baby dont hold me back cause baby I baby I need a jack for all trades  
A mind and body well made  
  
Crucial  our love has got to be  
Crucial  every little thing from A to Z  
Crucial  youve got to show me everything everything everything
