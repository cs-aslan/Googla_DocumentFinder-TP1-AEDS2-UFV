I remember how it used to feel  
Riding down old two mile hill  
Tennis shoes up on the handle bars  
Paying no mind to the passing cars  
No doubts no fears just like when you are here  
  
Chorus  
No chains no strings no fences no wall  
No net just you to catch me when I fall  
Look heart no hands  
  
It took a little time to get up to speed  
To find the confidence and strength I need  
To just let go and reach for the sky  
You Know sometimes it felt I could fly  
No doubts no fears just like when you are here  
  
Chorus  
  
It doesnt take much just a smile or a touch  
And Im a kid again I can almost feel that wind  
  
On one hand I count the reasons I could stay with you  
And hold you close to me all night long  
So many lovers games I could play with you  
And on that hand I see no reason why its wrong  
  
Chorus  
  
But on the other hand theres a golden band  
To remind of someone who would not understand  
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man  
But the reason I must go is on the other hand  
  
In your arms I feel the passion I thought had died  
When I looked into your eyes I found myself  
When I first kissed your lips I felt so alive  
Ive got to hand it to you girl youre something else  
  
Chorus
