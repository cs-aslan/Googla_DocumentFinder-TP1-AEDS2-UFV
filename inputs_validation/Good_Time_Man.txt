Ill show you the stars in heaven  
Well look at the moon above  
Though Im a silly dreamer you better stick with me  
The best things in life are free  
And Im gonna be your good time man  
Ill be your good time man  
  
No diamonds from Cartier  
No shopping spree every day  
Ill be your special lover I know youll understand  
Im doing the best I can  
And youll be the one in wonderland  
Ill be your good time man  
  
Lee I love you so so much youll never never know  
I have a special master plan  
Ill be your good time man  
  
No pad on Fifth Avenue  
No carriage ride just for two  
No table at Twenty One  
Were gonna have ourselves some fun  
  
No presents from Tiffany  
Oh baby thats not for me  
No Rainbow Room at night well just do it right  
Doing it naturally  
And I do it good you know I can  
Ill be your good time man  
  
Lee I love you so so much youll never never never know  
I have a special master plan  
Ill be your good time man  
  
No fancy things from Chanel  
I think that you just look swell  
You are my special girl  
Im gonna take you round the world  
  
A circle line round New York  
Through Central Park we will walk  
Well hang out at the Boat House take a paddle ride  
Well do it up in style  
And Im gonna make you smile I can  
Ill be your good time man  
  
No Phantom of the Opera not for me  
I like Coney Island by the sea  
French fries at Nathans not Grenouille  
Youre gonna see the real me  
Ill be your good time man  
Ill be your good time man  
Ill be your good
