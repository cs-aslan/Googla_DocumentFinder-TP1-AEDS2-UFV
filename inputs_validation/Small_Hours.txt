I close the door and turn the key  
And dream a world for you and me  
Beyond the walls a city breathes  
In this room one heart beats  
The stars they shine for you and me  
On the street ten floors below  
The city lights are all aglow  
The corner girls they come and go  
Dreaming of a ticket home  
The stars they shine for you and me  
Ill have a drink and then well see  
If the spirit conjures your genie  
To lie beside me in my dreams  
The wind is blowing a melody  
The stars they shine for you and me  
Close the door and turn the key  
And now that youre alone with me  
Well sit up late and watch TV  
The neon flashes red and green  
Oh the stars they shine for you and me
