Lets wake up in the afternoon  
Pretend that we got nothing to do  
No we dont have to go by any agenda  
We can make up our own rules  
I see the way youre looking at me  
Baby know Im feeling it too  
We can just light up every candle  
Move from room to room  
  
Stopping every minute just because youre in it  
Wishing everyday was Sunday youre right next to me  
Its how its supposed to be  
Hanging on every touch  
Baby dont rush no no  
Baby dont rush  
  
Throw the map out of the window  
Taking the long way around  
To a secret place where no one could find us  
A little place we can call our own  
Come over here and take a picture  
Something we can hang on to  
We can look back and try to remember  
All the crazy things we gonna do  
  
Stopping every minute just because youre in it  
Wishing everyday was Sunday youre right next to me  
Its how its supposed to be  
Just hanging on every touch  
Baby dont rush  
Baby dont rush  
  
Stopping every minute just because youre in it  
Stopping every minute just because youre in it  
Stopping every minute  
  
Stopping every minute just because youre in it  
Wishing every day was Sunday youre right next to me  
Its how its supposed to be  
  
Stopping every minute just because youre in it  
Wishing everyday was Sunday youre right next to me  
Its how its supposed to be supposed to be  
Just hanging on every touch  
Baby dont rush no no  
Baby dont rush Baby dont rush  
Baby dont rush
