I drop science like girls be droppin babies  
Enough to make a nigga go crazy  
  
And energy buildin takin all types of medicines  
Your ass thought you were better than Ason  
I keep planets in orbit  
While I be comin with teeth bitin more shit  
Enough to make you break and shake yo ass  
Cause I create rhymes good as a tasty cake mix  
  
This style Im mastered in  
Niggas catchin headaches what what You need Aspirin  
This type of pain you couldnt even kill with Midol  
Fuck around get sprayed with Lysol

To watch me put your fuckin ass low down

Nigga wanna get too close to the utmost  
But I got stacks thatll attack any wack host

Talent that I got will rizock the spot
