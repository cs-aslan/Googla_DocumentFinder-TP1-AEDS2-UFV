A fool never learns  
To get away just run away before his heart begins to break  
A fool never learns  
Hell wait around just hang around to see how much his heart can take  
A fool never learns  
To some girls love is just a game  
And some girls treat all fool the same  
A fool never learns  
And Im gonna do a very foolish thing  
  
Im gonna stick by you  
Im a gonna hang around wait around  
Hope shell love me again some day  
They say a broken heart dont mark the end of time  
That there are lotsa girls whod love to be just mine  
But I dont believe that I could fall in love again  
Cause I just cant remove the pain  
A fool never learns  
And Im gonna do a very foolish thing  
  
Im gonna stick by you  
Im a gonna hang around wait around  
Hope shell love me again some day  
They say a broken heart dont mark the end of time  
That there are lotsa girls whod love to be just mine  
But I dont believe that I could fall in love again  
Cause I just cant remove the pain  
A fool never learns  
And Im gonna do a very foolish thing  
And Im gonna do a very foolish thing  
  
And Im gonna do a very foolish thing
