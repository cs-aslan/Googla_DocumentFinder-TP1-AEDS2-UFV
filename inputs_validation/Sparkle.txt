Sparkle theres gotta be a sparkle  
For you to love somebody  
For you to really know  
Brighter than the lights in the city  
Its more than being pretty  
The way you are inside  
  
Why are you crying  
Somebodys trying  
To be with you only all the time  
You hide behind tears  
Counting the fears  
Youre so used to being alone  
  
Sparkle theres gotta be a sparkle  
For you to love somebody  
For you to really know  
Sparkle you got a certain sparkle  
I know I love somebody  
I gotta let it show  
  
Nobody knows you  
They cant get too close to  
A girl who wont let down her disguise  
You wont believe how much someone could love you  
That someone is looking in your eyes  
  
Sparkle its gotta be a sparkle  
For you to love somebody  
For you to really know  
Brighter than the lights of the city  
Its more than being pretty  
Its the way you feel inside  
Sparkle
