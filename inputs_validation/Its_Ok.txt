Hey Kyu  
  
Chorus x2  
Its a broke day but everything is OK Its OK  
Im up all night but everything is alright Its alright  
Its a rough week and I dont get enough sleep I cant sleep  
Its a long year pretending I belong here Belong here  
  
One day I plan to be a family man happily married  
I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried  
Til Im glad to be buried  
And leave this crazy world  
  
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl  
It may be early to be planning this stuff  
Cause Im still struggling hard to be the man and its tough  
Cause man its been rough but still I manage enough  
  
Ive been taken advantage of damaged and scuffed  
My hands have been cuffed  
But I dont panic and huff frantic and puff  
Or plan to give up the minute shit hits the fan it erupts  
  
Im anteing up double or nothing Ive been trouble enough  
And Im sick of struggling and suffering see  
My destinys to rest at ease till Im impressed and pleased  
With my progress I wont settle for less than cheese  
  
Im on a quest to seize all my own label to call  
Way before my baby is able to crawl  
Im too stable to fall the pressure motivates  
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades  
  
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth  
Where they dont pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf Kyu  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Im going for broke gambling and playing for keeps  
Everyday in the streets scrambling and paying for cheep  
Praying for sleep  
Dreaming with a watering mouth  
  
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse  
In this slaughtering house caught up in bouts  
With the root of all evil  
Ive seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful  
  
And make them do shit illegal  
For these Grants and Jacksons  
These transactions explain a mans actions  
But in the mist of this insanity I found my Christianity  
  
Through God and theres a wish he granted me  
He showed me how to cope with the stress  
And hope for the best instead of mope and depressed  
Always groping a mess of flying over the nest  
  
To selling dope with the rest  
I quit smoking cess to open my chest  
Life is stressful inside this cesspool  
Trying to wrestle I almost bust a blood vessel  
  
My little brothers trying to learn his mathematics  
Hes asthmatic running home from school away from crack addicts  
Kids attract static children with automatics  
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets  
  
Im using smarter tactics to overcome this slum  
I wont become as dumb as some and succumb to scum  
Its cumbersome Im trying to do well on this Earth  
But its been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Uh its OK yeah its alright even though I cant sleep  
Uh yeah its OK its alright I cant sleep
