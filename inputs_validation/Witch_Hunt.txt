Wipe out the weak and dying  
Ive got no use for you  
Sent from Hell I know theyre lying  
Just another sacrifice  
  
We are on a witch hunt  
Hunt her down for will she sink or float  
We want independence from her spell  
  
Exterminate the undetermined  
Ive got no use for you  
Sent from Hell I know theyre lying  
Hang her by her neck to die  
  
We are on a witch hunt  
Hunt her down for will she sink or float  
We want independence from her spell  
  
Were on a head hunt  
Were on a blood hunt  
Were on a witch hunt  
and were gonna get you  
Were coming after you too  
  
Were on a witch hunt  
Were on a witch hunt  
  
We are on a witch hunt  
Hunt her down for will she sink or float  
We want independence from her spell  
  
Were under a spell  
Were on a head hunt  
Were on a blood hunt  
Were on a witch hunt  
and were gonna get you  
Were coming after you
