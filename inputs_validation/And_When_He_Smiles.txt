And when he smiles he makes the sun shine  
He wouldnt think to make it rain  
Happiness runs in the family  
And hes a boy from the good old earth and the high tree forest  
And hes just about the happiest boy that I ever knew  
  
And when he smiles he makes me sigh  
He doesnt have a point of view  
Happiness runs in the family  
And hes a boy from the good old earth and the high tree forest  
And hes just about the happiest boy that I ever knew  
  
And when he smiles he makes the sun shine  
And warms the day with morning dew  
Happiness runs in the family  
And hes a boy from the good old earth and the high tree forest  
And hes just about the happiest boy that I ever knew  
And hes just about the happiest boy that I ever knew
