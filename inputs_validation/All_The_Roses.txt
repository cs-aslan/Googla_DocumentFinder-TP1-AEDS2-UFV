What do I do with all the roses outside  
Theyre not suppose to grow this time of year  
Its a heart break but you got me smiling  
And youre the only one who can get me through  
  
I can hear your voice when youre whispering  
I can feel your heart when its beating  
I believe youre near when the ghost comes in  
I can hear you when youre calling out my name  
  
I can remember when a day lasted forever  
Summer was everything and there was nothing to fear  
You were so tired but your heart sense so much  
Nobody else got through quite like you  
  
I can hear your voice when youre whispering  
I can feel your heart when its beating  
I believe youre near when the ghost comes in  
I can hear you when youre calling out my name  
  
Did I get hit by the moonlight under the stars  
Cause you feel so close that I can reach you wherever you are  
  
I can hear your voice when youre whispering  
I can feel your heart when its beating  
I believe youre near when the ghost comes in  
I can hear you when youre calling out my name  
I can hear your voice when youre whispering  
I can feel your heart when its beating  
I believe youre near when the ghost comes in  
I can hear you when youre calling out my name
