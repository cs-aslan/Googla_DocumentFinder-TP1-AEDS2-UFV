Darlin I want you to listen  
I stayed up all night so I can get this thing right  
And I dont think theres anything missin  
Coz a person like you made it easy to do  
Ive waited for so long  
To sing to you this song  
  
Chorus  
Coz your eyes are the windows to heaven  
Your smile could heal a million souls  
Your love completes my existence  
Youre the other half that makes me whole  
Youre the only other half that makes me whole  
  
I think the angels are your brothers yeah  
They told about me said youre just what she needs  
And I find myself thanking your mother  
For giving birth to a saint  
My spirit flies when I say your name  
If theres one thing thats true  
Its that I was born to love you  
  
Chorus  
Coz your eyes are the windows to heaven  
Your smile could heal a million souls  
Your love completes my existence  
Youre the other half that makes me whole  
Youre the only other half that makes me whole  
  
You make my dreams come true over and over again  
And I honestly truly believe  
That you and me are written in the stars  
Id live my whole life through  
Just giving thanks to you  
  
Chorus  
Coz your eyes are the windows to heaven  
Your smile could heal a million souls  
Your love completes my existence  
Youre the other half that makes me whole  
Youre the only other half that makes me whole
