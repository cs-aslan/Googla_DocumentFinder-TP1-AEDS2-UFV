I was sitting on the edge of his bed  
Staring at the headlines on the paper  
He said Look at poor Gene Kelly  
I guess he wont be singing in the rain  
You can take away my heroes  
Can you take away my pain  
  
Take away my pain  
Leave the cold outside  
Please dont let it rain  
Dont stumble on my pride  
  
Take away my pain  
Im not frightened anymore  
Just stay with me tonight  
Im tired of this fight  
Soon Ill be knocking at your door  
  
She was standing by the edge of his bed  
Staring at the message on their faces  
He said What else can you do babe  
I guess I wont be coming home again  
They just took away all my promises  
Make them take away my pain  
  
Take away my pain  
Leave the cold outside  
Please dont let it rain  
Dont stumble on my pride  
  
Take away my pain  
Im not frightened anymore  
Just stay with me tonight  
Im tired of this fight  
Soon Ill be knocking at your door  
  
His final scene  
The actor bows  
And all those years  
Are gone somehow  
The crowd applauds  
The curtain falls  
  
I was standing by the edge of the water  
I noticed my reflection in the waves  
Then I saw you looking back at me  
And I knew that for a moment  
You were calling out my name  
You took away my hero  
Will you take away my pain  
  
Take away my pain  
Let the cold inside  
Its time to let it rain  
Theres nothing left to hide  
  
Take away my pain  
Im not frightened anymore  
Im learning to survive  
Without you in my life  
Til you come knocking at my door
