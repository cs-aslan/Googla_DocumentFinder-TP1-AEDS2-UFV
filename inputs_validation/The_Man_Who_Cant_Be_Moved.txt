Going back to the corner where I first saw you  
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag Im not gonna move  
Got some words on cardboard got your picture in my hand  
Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am  
Some try to hand me money they dont understand  
Im not broke Im just a broken hearted man  
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do  
How can I move on when Im still in love with you  
  
Cause if one day you wake up and find that youre missing me  
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be  
Thinking maybe youll come back here to the place that wed meet  
And youd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street  
  
So Im not moving  
Im not moving  
  
Policeman says son you cant stay here  
I said theres someone Im waiting for if its a day a month a year  
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows  
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go  
  
Cause if one day you wake up and find that youre missing me  
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be  
Thinking maybe youll come back here to the place that wed meet  
And youd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street  
  
So Im not moving  
Im not moving  
  
Im not moving  
Im not moving  
  
People talk about the guy  
Whos waiting on a girl  
  
There are no holes in his shoes  
But a big hole in his world  
  
And maybe Ill get famous as man who cant be moved  
And maybe you wont mean to but youll see me on the news  
And youll come running to the corner  
Cause youll know its just for you  
  
Im the man who cant be moved  
Im the man who cant be moved  
  
Cause if one day you wake up and find that youre missing me  
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be  
Thinking maybe youll come back here to the place that wed meet  
And youd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street  
  
So Im not moving  
Im not moving  
  
Im not moving  
Im not moving  
  
Going back to the corner where I first saw you  
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag not Im not gonna move
