He packed his few belongings left a note and now hes gone  
Its hard for me to know hes left me here so all alone  
As soon as hes gone for enough and I know hes out of sight  
Oh Ill go all to pieces and Ill cry  
Yes I need someone to hold me when I cry  
Someone who really understand the way I feel inside  
When my heart breaks the tears wont stop no matter how I try  
And I need someone to hold me when I cry  
  
I dont know why he left me or what his leavins for  
I guess he didnt need me or love me anymore  
He drove me into a world as dark and cold as ice  
With no one here to hold me when I cry  
Yes I need someone to hold me
