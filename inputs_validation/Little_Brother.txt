We were just kids growin up in West Texas  
Remember the hell weve raised  
We chased the girls but we never could catch em  
Those were our glory days  
You called me cowboy cause I drove a pickup  
And sang those old cheatin songs  
Wed buy a bottle of Boones Farm wind up all messed up  
Where have those years all gone  
Hey little brother this is old cowboy  
Best keep your radio on  
Cause I might get lucky sing on the Opry  
And Ill dedicate you this song  
Well I hit the highway and never looked back  
You stayed here in our old hometown  
You married a sweet girl down around Austin  
Had nine kids whose eyes are all brown  
I hit every barroom from Bakersfield to Boston  
Seeking whiskey fortune and fame  
Countin these white lines sure gets lonely  
Someday theyll all know my name  
Hey little brother this is old cowboy  
Best keep your radio on  
Cause I might get lucky sing on the Opry  
And Ill dedicate you this song  
Well the years come and go and Ive sure realized  
Aint nothin like your best friend  
If theres one thing I know til the day that I die  
Youve got my back brother Ben  
Hey little brother this is old cowboy  
Youve got your radio on  
Tonight I got lucky Im singin on the Opry  
And I dedicate you this song  
Yeah tonight I got lucky Im singin on the Grand Ole Opry  
And I dedicate you this song
