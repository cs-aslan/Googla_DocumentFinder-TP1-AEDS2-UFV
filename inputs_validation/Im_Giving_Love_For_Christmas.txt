Im giving love for Christmas  
To everyone I know  
It doesnt need a bow  
It only needs to come from your heart  
  
Im giving love for Christmas  
So everyone can see  
What Christmas means to me  
Its more than presents under the tree  
  
Christmas is all about caring  
And as every princess knows  
Nothing is quiet as warming  
When its storming or it snows  
  
So Im giving love for Christmas  
The best gift that I can give  
And in these times we live  
It seems more and more what were looking for  
  
Christmas is being with family  
Seeing all the friends youve missed  
Making new Christmas memories  
Thats the first thing on my Christmas list  
  
Id give you everything  
If I had everything its true  
But all that I have is my heart to give  
So thats what Im giving you  
  
Im giving love for Christmas  
And hoping that you will too  
I will I will  
  
And hoping that if you do  
It just might be me you give your love to  
And that would be  
My best Christmas dream come true
