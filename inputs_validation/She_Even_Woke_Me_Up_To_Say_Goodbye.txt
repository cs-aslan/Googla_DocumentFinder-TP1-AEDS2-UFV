Well the mornings come  
And Lord my mind is aching  
The sunshines quietly standing at my door  
Just like the dawn  
My heart is silently breaking  
With my tears it goes tumbling to the floor  
  
Once again the whole town will be talking  
Its more Ive seen the pity in their eyes  
They could never understand  
Its her sorrow not a man  
  
No matter what they say I know she tried  
Babys packed her soft things  
And oh shes left me  
I know she never meant to make me cry  
  
Its not her heart Lord  
Its her mind she didnt mean to be unkind  
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye
