I know a man we call him poor boy Jones  
Hes never been a 100 miles from home  
Hes got a pretty good farm  
And a level head  
A heart of gold  
  
No satellite dish for his TV set  
And he aint on lie with the internet  
He says guitar music entertains us here  
and it sounds real good to the untrained ear  
  
And I cant find a rason to echange  
More of this and more of that  
Has never been my game  
The way Ive got it figured out  
I aint missed a thing  
And I cant find a reason to change  
  
Some people like to fly around first class  
But a greyhound bus goes pretty dang fast  
Been a while lot of times when time were lean  
A big night out was a Dairy Queen  
He says all my children believe in god  
They can hold their own  
They can hold a job  
Theres a whole lot of color in the human race  
And loving one another makes a better place  
  
And I cant find a reason to exchange  
More of this and more of that  
Has never been my game  
The way Ive got it figured out  
I aint missed a thing  
And I cant find a reason to change  
No I cant find a reason to change
