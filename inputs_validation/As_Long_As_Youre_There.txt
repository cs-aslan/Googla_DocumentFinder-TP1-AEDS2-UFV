All my life  
Ive waited for the right  
Moment to let you know  
I dont wanna let you go  
But now I realize  
Theres just no perfect time  
To confess how I feel  
This much I know is real  
So I refuse to  
Waste one more second without you  
Knowing my heart  
  
Baby cause I dont  
Need anything else but your love  
Nothing but you means a thing to me  
Im incomplete  
When youre not there  
Holding me touching me  
I swear  
All of the risk would just disappear  
And I wouldnt even care  
As long as youre there  
  
Take these words  
Dont let them go unheard  
This is me reaching out  
I hope you can hear me now  
This pain in my heart stands stay  
Taking is yours to break  
Having to try and lose  
Then keep this love from you  
So I refuse to  
Waste one more second  
Without you  
Knowing my heart  
  
Baby cause I dont  
Need anything else but your love  
Nothing but you means a thing to me  
Im incomplete  
When youre not there  
Holding me touching me  
I swear  
All of the risk would just disappear  
And I wouldnt even care  
As long as youre there  
  
Each day  
And Night  
That I  
Kept it a secret  
And it killed me  
Its time  
To share what I feel inside  
  
I dont  
Need anything else but your love  
Nothing but you means a thing to me  
Im incomplete  
When youre not there  
Holding me touching me  
I swear  
All of the risk would just disappear  
And I wouldnt even care  
As long as youre there  
As long as youre there
