Raid N the Bedouins  
Had a plan and thought theyd win  
But I dont give a fuck bout them  
Cause I am crazy  
  
Oh my salvation  
N all my frustrations  
Caught in the lies  
No one had wove so well  
Somewhere in time  
Where only I could tell  
Ohhhh  
  
Raid N the Bedouins  
Say thats a war that you cant win  
But I have had enough of them  
And who can blame me  
  
Sands of time and desert winds  
Nomads and Barbarians  
I wont bend my will to them  
You aggravate me  
  
Oh my salvation  
N all my frustrations  
Caught in the lies  
No one had wove so well  
Somewhere in time  
Where only I could tell  
Ohhhh

Oh sweet salvation  
N all my frustrations  
Caught in the lies  
If you ignore this world  
Somewhere in time  
When will I get there  
  
Oh sweet salvation  
And my frustrations  
Caught in the lies  
If you had wove so well  
Somewhere in time  
Where only I could tell  
Ohhhh  
  
Raid N the Bedouins  
Had a plan and thought theyd win  
  
Raid N the Bedouins  
Crossed the line and lost again
