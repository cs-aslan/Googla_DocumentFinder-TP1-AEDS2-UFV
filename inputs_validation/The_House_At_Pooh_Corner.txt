Christopher Robin and I walked along  
Under branches lit up by the moon  
Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore  
  
As the days disappeared far too soon  
Now I wandered much further today than I should  
And I cant find my way to the threeacre wood  
So help me if you can Ive got to get  
  
Back to the house At Pooh Corner by one  
Youll be surprised theres so much to be done  
Count all the bees in the hive  
Chase all the clouds from the sky  
  
Back to the days of Christopher Robin  
And Pooh  
Winnie the Pooh doesnt know what to do  
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose  
  
He came to me asking help and advice  
And from here no one knows where he goes  
So I went in to ask of the Owl if hes there  
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear  
  
So help me if you can Ive got to get  
Back to the house At Pooh Corner by one  
Youll be surprised theres so much to be done  
Count all the bees in the hive  
  
Chase all the clouds from the sky  
Back to the days of Christopher Robin  
Back to the ways of Christopher Robin  
And Pooh
