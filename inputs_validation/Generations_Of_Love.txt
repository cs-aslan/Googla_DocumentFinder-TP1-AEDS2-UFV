I dont know much  
but I know what I feel  
theres too many people fighting  
tied to the wheel  
I dont know much  
but I know what i see  
theres too many people crying  
washed out to sea  
  
and theres much more we can say  
much more we can do  
much more we can learn  
generations of love  
  
I dont knwo you but you know what I am  
hey I dont need redemption  
or no government plan  
no big AIDS sensation  
no 28 clause  
the end of aparteid  
no message of war  
the jew and the gentile  
the black and the gay  
the lost and the futile  
theyve all got something to say  
the african nation  
the sword of Islam  
the rebels in chaina  
the sikhs and the tams  
the house of our father  
the volumes of guilt  
the luck of the Irish  
the blood that weve spilt  
the angels and martyrs  
the lovers and saints  
the sisters of mercy  
the brothers of pain
