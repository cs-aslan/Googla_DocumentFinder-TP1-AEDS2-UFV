Why cant I forget like I should  
Heaven knows I would if I could  
But I just cant keep you off my mind  
  
Though youre gone I have to explain  
All around me you still remain  
Wonder why fate should be so unkind  
  
Waking skies at sunrise  
Every sunset too  
Seems to be bringing me  
Memories of you  
  
Here and there everywhere  
Scenes that we once knew  
And they all just recall  
Memories of you  
  
How I wish I could forget  
Those happy yesteryears  
That have left  
A rosary of tears  
  
Your face beams in my dreams  
Spite of all I do  
Everything seems to bring  
Memories of you  
Those memories of you
