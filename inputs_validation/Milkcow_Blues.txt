Well I woke up this morning looked out the door  
I could tell that was my milkcow by the way that she lowed  
So if you see my milkcow please send her home  
Well I aint had no milk and butter  
Ooh since my cows been gone  
  
Tried everything baby to get along with you  
Now Im gonna tell you what Im gonna do  
Gonna stop my cryin  leave you alone  
If you dont think Im leavin  
You just count the days Im gone  
Cause you re gonna need me  
Need your lovin daddy one of these days  
Yeah and you gonna be ohsosorry you treated me this way
