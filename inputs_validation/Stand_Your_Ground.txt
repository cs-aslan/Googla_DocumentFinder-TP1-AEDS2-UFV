Stand your ground  
Youre big enough  
Stand your ground  
You know too much  
Today drifts into tomorrow  
And you can almost taste the sorrow  
Stand your ground  
Youve had enough  
Lost and found  
Diamond in the rough  
Today drifts into tomorrow  
You feel your souls been borrowed  
Oooh oooh  
Stand your ground  
The waters deep  
Feel the sand beneath your feet  
I know your prayers seem hollow  
But when its hard they follow  
Ooh ooh
