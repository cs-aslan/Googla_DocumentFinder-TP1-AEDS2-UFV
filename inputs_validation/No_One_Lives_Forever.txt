You worry too much  
You make yourself sad  
You cant change fate  
But dont feel so bad  
Enjoy it while you can  
Its just like the weather  
So quit complaining brother  
No one lives forever  
  
Lets have a party theres a full moon in the sky  
Its the hour of the wolf and I dont want to die  
  
Im so happy  
Dancing while the Grim Reaper  
Cuts cuts cuts but he cant catch me  
Im clever as can be  
And Im very quick  
But dont forget  
Youve only got so many tricks  
No one lives forever  
  
You think youve got it rough  
What about your darling doggie  
Ten short years  
And hes getting old and groggy  
I dont think its very fair  
Cold Chop Low  
But its all relative my friend cause  
No one lives forever  
  
Lets have a party theres a full moon in the sky  
Its the hour of the wolf and I dont want to die  
  
Im so happy  
Dancing while the Grim Reaper  
Cuts cuts cuts but he cant catch me  
Im clever as can be  
And Im very quick  
But dont forget  
Youve only got so many tricks  
No one lives forever  
  
You worry too much  
You make yourself sad  
You cant change fate  
But dont feel so bad  
Enjoy it while you can  
Its just like the weather  
So quit complaining brother  
No one lives forever  
  
Lets have a party theres a full moon in the sky  
Its the hour of the wolf and I dont want to die  
  
No one beats him at his game  
For very long but just the same  
Who cares theres no place safe to hide  
Nowhere to run no time to cry  
So celebrate why you still can  
Cause any second it may end  
And when its all been said and done  
Better that you had some fun  
Instead of hiding in a shell  
Why make your life a living hell  
Drink a toast down the cup  
Drink to bones that turn to dust  
  
Cause  
No one no one no one  
No one lives forever
