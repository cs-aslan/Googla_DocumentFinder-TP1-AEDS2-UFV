A beautiful mind or a beautiful body  
I know which one Im gonna end upon  
You say you will but you never promised thoughts  
  
A smile and a hand mix like water with sand  
As far as youre concerned  
A road and a sign I know which one catches my eyes  
  
And I thought I heard it for a while  
Then it all came to me  
Sometimes I just dont know I believe in  
  
Dont you want to know when I suffer  
It doesnt show  
A smile and a hand mix like water with sand dont you know  
  
I was thinking about moving back home  
I dont really need to live here  
No no I didnt I could Im sure I would if I knew that  
I didnt I could Im sure I would if I knew that  
  
A smile and a hand mix like water with sand  
As far as youre concerned  
A beautiful mind or a beautiful body  
I know which one Im gonna end upon end upon
