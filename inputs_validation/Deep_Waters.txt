Is it a crime  
For me to be feeling this way  
Im going out of my mind  
And theres no change from my runaway love  
  
Is it a dream Is it a dream  
That Im throwing in the wishing well  
Im losin control  
Body and soul Body and soul  
Standin here waiting for a train that may never come  
  
I saw the signs  
Id read the book  
I should have had a second look  
But boy you caught me dreamin  
And there were times youd come around  
And wed agree just to be friends  
Tell me who was foolin who  
  
Chorus  
Deep waters Im drownin in  
Deep waters slowly drownin in deeper  
Deep waters Im drownin in  
Deep waters slowly drownin in deeper  
  
What do I say what can I say  
Where words have failed me before  
What do I do when Im feeling so blue  
And theres no place for me to run and hide  
  
I saw the sun inside your smile  
And wished for more than just a while  
Cause boy you caught me dreaming  
A giant step into the dark  
We threw caution to the wind  
Tell me who was fooling who  
  
Chorus  
  
Im drownin  
Deeper deeper deeper  
Im drownin in deeper  
  
Oh I saw the signs  
I read the book  
I should have had a second look  
cause boy you caught me dreamin  
And there were times youd come around  
And wed agree just to be friends  
Tell me who was fooling fooling who  
  
Chorus
