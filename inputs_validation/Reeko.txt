Reeko try to understand it really is that bad  
It wont just go away the partys over  
Its past two oclock so its about time we  
Stopped cause I  
See the keg has been sucked dry  
  
The Crisco was emptied into the aquarium  
Where the fish all seems to play the ex lax lines  
The dog bowl  
The toilets overflowed weve had our fun so  
Now theres nothing left to damage  
We got no place left to go  
  
Mr President please understand it really is that vbad  
It wont just go away its just beginning  
The ballots have been casty we make like seaward rats  
Leave this sinking ship leave and not look back  
  
The things we neer tried to disallow  
Have come back to haunt us now  
With apple pie and Chevrolet  
Weve come to see the end we all made this bed  
Now we got nowhere to lay  
Dies and gentlemen  
Try to understand
