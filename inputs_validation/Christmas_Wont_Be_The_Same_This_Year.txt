Merry Christmas everybody  
Yeah Merry Christmas everybody big deal  
Hey man whats wrong with you Jermaine  
Yeah thats not kind of attitude  
This only happens once a year  
Hey fellas dont bug him  
He and his girl just broke up so get off his back  
Cant you see theres tears in his eyes  
Yeah hes cryin   
  
Dont cry dont cry dont cry  
  
Christmas wont be the same this year  
Without her loving arms holding you so near  
Christmas wont be the same this year  
No it wont now darlin no no  
Without her loving arms holding you so near  
  
I see the lights  
But they dont shine for me  
I see the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
Our house is decorated  
My friends are celebrating  
  
No no it wont be the same this year  
The things we used to do  
Now Darling its all over  
  
The neighborhood kids  
Are having so much fun  
Counting off the days  
Til Santa Claus comes  
And I see the mistletoe  
Hanging from my door  
I wish I could kiss you again  
Like I did before  
  
So go on girl  
And have your fun  
Dont spoil your time  
Thinking about me  
This time next year my darling dear  
Hopefully youll be having dinner with me  
  
No no it wont be the same without you my darling
