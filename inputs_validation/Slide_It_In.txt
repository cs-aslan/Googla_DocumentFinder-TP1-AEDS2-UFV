You talk too much never saying whats on your mind  
Its written on your face I lead the world you hide behind  
I know what you want I can see what youre looking for  
I know what you want from me  
An Im gonna give you more  
  
Im gonna slide it in right to the top  
Slide it in I aint never gonna stop  
Slide it in right to the top  
Im gonna slide it in slide it in slide it in baby  
  
Sometimes you seem just like a stranger to me  
But all the games you play make it so easy to see  
Youre looking for love tho you try to deny  
The things you put me through  
Tell me what Ive got to do to you  
Im gonna slide it in right to the top  
Slide it in I aint never gonna stop  
Slide it in right to the top  
Im gonna slide it in slide it in  
  
You talk too much always treating me so unkind  
I know what Ive got to do to get me some peace of mind  
  
Im gonna slide it in right to the top  
Slide it in I aint never gonna stop  
Slide it in right to the top  
Im gonna slide it in slide it in  
Slide it in right to the top  
Slide it in I aint never gonna stop  
Slide it in right to the top  
Im gonna slide it in slide it in slide it slide it in slide it in right
to the top baby
