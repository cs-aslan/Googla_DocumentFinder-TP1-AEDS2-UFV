I watch you spin from afar  
I drink you in and breath you out  
Im camouflaged by the timeline  
Im camouflaged when the sun shines  
  
Two ships passing in the night  
Two lips pressing ground the tides  
  
Chorus  
I believe the world it spins for you  
We will never be I am the moon  
I believe the world it spins for you  
We will never be I am the moon  
  
I long to be a part  
I isolate my heart  
Youve drawn me into your world  
Now I too spin limbless  
  
One hand clapping wheres the wind  
I stand spanning at your distant wings  
  
Chorus  
  
I believe the world it spins for you  
We will never be I am the moon
