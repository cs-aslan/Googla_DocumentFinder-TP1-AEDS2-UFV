Verse 1  
Is it okay to show my face Im wondering if I  
Can talk to you youre being rude and theres no need to cry you departed

For whatever that I did to you  
From party to party and shots of Bacardi  
Girl its clear to see I  
Chorus

You dont spend enough time with methats right  
I just wanna make it up to youbut how  
Im just gonna do it do it somehow

And I promise girl I will do what I can  
To let you know that I am a changed man
