Your life is shit  
Shit  
Your life is over  
Bull  
Your life is mine  
Cry  
Your life is hell  
Hell  
Im gonna die  
Dying with you just  
Im going to die  
To wear my libido  
Im gonna try  
To find it with you just  
Im gonna try  
Do what they say  
Your life is shit  
Shit  
Your life is strange  
And insane  
Your life is not the size of crap  
Your life is now  
Now  
Im gonna die  
Dying with you just  
Im going to hell  
Without my libido  
Im gonna try  
To find it with you just  
Im going to hell  
Without my libido  
Im gonna die  
Dying with you just  
Im going to hell  
Without my libido  
Im gonna try  
To find it with you just  
Im gonna die  
Do what they say  
Your life is shit  
Im gonna open myself up a flea market  
Im gonna open myself up a flea market  
And youre gonna wish that you did  
And retire on the profits  
First off  
Im gonna empty out all of my Mrs Butterworth jars  
And Im gonna put em on a shelf with my 800 dollar a month tax free Century
21  
Shop  
  
And then I am going to put my Mrs Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf  
Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups Ive
accumulated  
Over the past 62 years  
  
Then Im going to get some plywood  
Im going to get some plywood and cut them up into two by two piece squares  
Then Im going to get some burlap and Im going to cut them into two by two  
Piece squares and then Im going to put them onto the pieces of plywood  
  
And then Im going to go to the beach  
Im going to go to the beach and Im gonna collect some shells and driftwood  
And then Im going to take the shells and driftwood and glue them onto the  
Plywood and burlap  
  
And sell em for lots of money  
People will be paying top dollar for my kids new used new toys and clothing  
Then maybe someday I can get rid of that pissed stained matress Ive been  
Sleeping on
