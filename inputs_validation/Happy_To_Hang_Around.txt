They were following me  
They were following everyone  
They had visions of me  
Holding hands walking in to the sun  
Now people get down people get down people get hurt  
When you did it to me  
I was already in the ground  
  
And Ill never get into your heart  
Though I dont even want to start  
Ill never get into your heart  
Im just happy to hang around  
Happy to hang around  
Happy to hang around  
  
Take a picture of me  
And show it to everyone  
And no more pictures of you  
No more love no more setting sun  
Now people get down people get down people get hurt  
And when you did it to me  
I was already in the dirt  
  
And Ill never get into your heart  
Though I dont even want to start  
Ill never get into your heart  
Im just happy to hang around  
Happy to hang around  
Happy to hang around  
  
And Ill never get into your heart  
Though I dont even want to start  
Ill never get into your heart  
Im just happy to hang around  
Happy to hang around  
Happy to hang around
