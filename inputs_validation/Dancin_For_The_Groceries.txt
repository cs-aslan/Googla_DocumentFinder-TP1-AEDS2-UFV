Shes thinkin about what her kids are doing  
Five miles away its almost time for bed  
Theyre brushing teeth and hearing one more story  
And in the mirror she paints her lips bright red  
  
She wishes she could call and say she loves them  
But the boss man says no calls go out or in  
So she puts on a dress that might feel pretty  
If she didnt have to take it off again  
  
Chorus  
Shes dancin for the groceries  
Shes dancin for the rent  
Shes dancin for the credit card that shes already spent  
In sequins and in laces shes dancing for the braces  
So her kids can have a perfect smile someday  
Smiling while she dances is the price she has to pay  
  
They tell her in this job there is no future  
So get it while you can cause looks dont last  
Theres money in those pockets for the taking  
And if you do it right it makes the time go fast  
  
The musics loud the drinks are mostly water  
Whatever her name is tonight she cant recall  
The business men stare at the single mother  
Whos smiling while shes staring at the wall  
  
Chorus  
  
Someday shell have a house out in the country  
Someday shell see the other side of dawn  
And no one will ever know what it was she did before  
But she just heard the DJ say youre on  
And the lights come up and they play her song  
  
Shes dancin for the groceries  
Shes dancin for the rent  
Shes dancin for the credit card that shes already spent  
In sequins and in laces shes dancing for the braces  
So her kids can have a perfect smile someday  
Smiling while she dances smiling while she dances  
Is the price she has to pay  
Shes dancin for the groceries  
Its the price she has to pay
