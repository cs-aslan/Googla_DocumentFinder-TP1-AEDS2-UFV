Do you want a shoulder  
I only want to hold you  
In your hour of need  
I hate to say I told you so  
But you shouldve let him go  
It just wasnt meant to be  
  
Let me make your pain a little lighter  
I can help you make your world a little brighter  
  
Ill be there when the shoutings over  
Ill be here after the tears  
You just may need me to hold you  
Ill be here after the tears  
  
Just a matter of time now  
Till I make you mine now  
It could happen any day  
Waited patiently  
Now it looks like youre gonna be free  
The tide is turning my way  
  
Ill see you through all the confussion  
Ill be your only true solution  
  
Ill be here when the partys over  
Ill be here after the tears  
You just may need another lover  
Ill be here after the tears  
  
Hold on  
Love is not so far away  
Can you hear it calling  
Be strong  
Ill be waiting in the wings  
  
Ill be here when the shoutings over  
i can make it better  
Ill be here after the tears  
I can make it better  
You just may need me to hold you  
I can make it better  
Ill be here after the tears  
I can make it better  
  
Ill be here when the partys over  
I can make it better  
Ill be here after the tears  
I can make it better  
You just may need another lover  
I can make it better  
Ill be here after the tears  
I can make it better
