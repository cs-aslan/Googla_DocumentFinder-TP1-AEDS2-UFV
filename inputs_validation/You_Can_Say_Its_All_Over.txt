You took the love I offered  
I tried the life that you lead  
The truth was told and forgiven  
You sold the strength that I need  
  
Now I can see that all you wanted  
Was someone you could hold a mirror to  
This mirror shattered into pieces  
You didnt want to really make things true  
  
And the blame that you offered  
Is something I didnt need  
When the truth beads were counted  
Is it you that I freed  
  
And I can say that its all over  
And I can say that I dont want it too  
I found that when Im in your presence  
That I could reach the highest side of you  
  
And you can say its all over baby  
And you can say its all over now  
  
One more chance is what I stopped saying  
A colder place to lay my head  
Now its over and truth is bragging  
An empty heart and a single bed  
  
And I can say its all over  
Well you can say that you dont want it too  
I found that now Ive lost your presence  
Love doesnt always let you see right through  
  
And you can say its all over baby  
And you can say its all over now  
And you can say its all over baby  
And you can say its all over now
