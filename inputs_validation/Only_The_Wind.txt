Its only the wind blowing litter all around  
Just a little wind and the trees are falling down  
Theres nobody crying that was yesterday  
Inside were all smiling everythings okay  
  
Its only the wind blowing cans along the street  
Someones dustbin lid playing havoc with the peace  
Theres nobody hiding behind a locked door  
And no ones been lying cause we dont lie any more  
  
Its only the wind how it takes you by surprise  
Suddenly begins then before you know it dies  
My hands are not shaking I dont touch a drop  
You must be mistaken I know when to stop  
  
When life is karma I have no doubt  
No angry drama a storm blows itself out  
  
Its only the wind they say its getting worse  
The trouble that it brings haunts us like a curse  
My nerves are all jangled but Im pulling through  
I hope I can handle what I have to do  
  
When life is karma I have no doubt  
No angry drama a storm blows itself out  
A storm blows itself out  
  
Im sorry
