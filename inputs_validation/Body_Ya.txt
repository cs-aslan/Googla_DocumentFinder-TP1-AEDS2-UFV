Bigging yall up should make you feel a little bigger  
Big up to the fake niggas from a real nigga  
Fake niggas help you recognize the real niggas

Prolly saying fuck me so shout out to the sex  
Dont get mad at me cause Im onto the next  
All of this cause I aint respond to your text  
Big up to you bum bitches in your ten dollar dresses  
Big up to the big girls yall are so Precious  
Salty bitches try to raise a nigga blood pressure  
Grown little girls do your mouth get any fresher  
Huh But it aint fresh as Loso  
Monogrammed out son in case you didnt know so  
Flow so deadly swag too murderous  
Known for being nice  
That dont mean courteous  
This is nothing new  
Im not a beginner  
I get big checks like the lottery winners  
A boy dissing I  
Boy listen I  
Kindly sent him on his way  
Tell the mortician hi  
  
Holla at your homie holla at your dog  
Looking for the competition holla at the morgue  
Once I say hi to her she gon say bye to ya  
If looks could kill then my style might body ya

If looks could kill then my style might body ya
