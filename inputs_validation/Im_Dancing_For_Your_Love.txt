I see that guy that youre standing near  
I know yu think that hes fine  
He gets you hot with his dancing gear  
But you aint had none of mine  
  
Oh I like the way you move  
Id like to feel your groove  
Hell never do you like me  
I got the stuff you need  
  
Oh danse pour ton amour  
Im dancing for your love  
Je danse pour ton amour  
Dancing for your love tonight  
  
I saw you looking like you wanted some  
And you were looking at me  
If you want to party and have some fun  
Then Im the guy you should see  
  
I I got the stuff to soothe  
I like the way you move  
You got the power to be  
Everything that I need
