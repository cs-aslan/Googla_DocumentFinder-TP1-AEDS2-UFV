Id rather be dead than to live like this  
Than to just exist a hand and no fist  
See the walking dead around me  
Waking up and breaking down before my eyes  
Rather be dead rather shoot and miss  
Rather die for a kiss than to live like this  
  
Hear the walking dead surround me  
Giving in and giving up because  
  
Chorus  
Were all doing fine  
And were falling fast behind  
I dont think well be the same again  
Were losing our minds  
Were all doing fine  
Is there anyplace to hide  
I dont think well be the same again  
Were losing  
Were losing our minds  
  
We walk tonight  
  
Id rather be dead than to have no hope inside  
Watch my will bleed away and my soul divide  
Feel the walking dead around me  
Getting closer moving farther from the light  
  
Id rather be dead stay alive to find  
Somewhere I belong someone to call mine  
See the walking dead surround me  
See the life and see the death and now  
  
Chorus  
  
Reach out  
I never get it  
Its just out of reach and  
I watch it slipping away  
Reach out  
Just forget it  
Its never good enough  
Its never going to be the same  
  
Chorus x2
