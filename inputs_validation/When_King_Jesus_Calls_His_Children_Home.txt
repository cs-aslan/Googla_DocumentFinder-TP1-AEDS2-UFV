When they plant me like a seed in the ground  
In silent sleep beneath some mossy mound  
Ill be like a rose just waitin for the spring  
Cause Im a gonna rise up rise up shout and sing  
  
Cause there aint no grave gonna hold my body down  
When I hear I hear that trumpet sound  
I know Ive been a dyin since the day that I was born  
But now Im living for that resurrection morn  
  
Chorus  
When King Jesus calls his children home  
When King Jesus calls his children home  
Im a gonna wear my snow white gown  
Im gonna put on a starry crown  
When King Jesus calls his children home  
  
Like a bird in a cage thats been set free  
My soul will sing throughout eternity  
Ill shed this mortal shell oh let ol Satan stay in hell  
Ill see glory that no human tongue can tell  
  
Repeat Chorus  
Ye know not the hour  
Ye know not the day  
So be humble my children  
Hide and watch and pray  
  
Repeat Chorus  
Repeat Chorus
