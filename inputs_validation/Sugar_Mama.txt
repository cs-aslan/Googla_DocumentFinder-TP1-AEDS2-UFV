Sittin here worryin  
While your lookin to find yourself  
Somebody else  
Me lovin you and wantin you baby  
And you not knowin what you want yourself  
Why do you treat me so mean  
It hurts so bad  
All you want to do is just sit around and jive  
You dont even know this womans alive  
Sittin here worryin  
Knowin your likin to find yourself  
  
Aint gonna be no sugar mama no more  
You cant have love when your keepin score  
All you pretty boys used to catch my eye  
I just want a man I can satisfy  
Aint gonna be no sugar mama no more
