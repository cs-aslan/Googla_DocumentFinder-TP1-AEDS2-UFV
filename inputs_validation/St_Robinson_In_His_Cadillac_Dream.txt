Staring out of his window as the world rushes by  
Arthur Robinson closes the glass and replies  
I dream of Ballerinas and I dont know why  
but I see Cadillacs sailing  
  
I was born on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay  
But Maryland and Virginia have faded away  
And I keep thinking tomorrow is coming today  
So I am endlessly waiting  
  
And the comet is coming between  
Me and the girl who could make it all clean  
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine  
Walks St Robinson in his Cadillac dream  
  
Carries down in her basement all toe shoes and twinned  
With the girl in the mirror who spins when she spins  
From where you think youll end up to the state that youre in  
Your reflection approaches and then recedes again  
  
And the comet is coming between  
Me and the girl who could make it all clean  
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine  
Walks St Robinson in his Cadillac dream  
  
I have dreamed of a black car that shimmers and drives  
Down the length of the evening to the carnival side  
In a house where regret is a carousel ride  
We are spinning and spinning and spinning and now  
  
Theres a hole in the ceiling down through which I fell  
Theres a girl in a basement coming out of her shell  
And there are people who will say that they knew me so well  
I may not go to heaven  
I hope you go to hell  
  
And the comet is coming between  
Me and the girl who could make it all clean  
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine  
Walks St Robinson in his Cadillac dream
