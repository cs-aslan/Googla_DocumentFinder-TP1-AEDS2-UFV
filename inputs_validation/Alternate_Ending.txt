Theres got to be an alternate ending  
Theres got to be an easy way out  
Ive got to make a change to the messages Im sending  
Its all gone wrong give me time  
Its all my fault could have told you  
Before its gone too far  
  
One love true love real love can last forever  
One love true love real love can last forever  
One love true love real love can last forever  
  
Stay with me awhile I know we belong together  
I just want to see you smile and change your mind  
  
Theres got to be an alternate ending  
Theres got be an easy way out  
Ive got to be the one to say Im sorry for pretending  
Its all gone wrong will you wait  
Its all my fault will you listen to me  
  
One love true love real love can last forever  
One love true love real love can last forever  
One love true love real love can last forever  
  
Stay with me awhile I know we belong together  
I just want to see you smile and change your mind  
Stay with me awhile all that weve done together  
Ive got no rights and Ive got no style but love is blind  
  
Stay with me awhile I know we belong together  
I just want to see you smile and change your mind  
Stay with me awhile all that weve done together  
Ive got no rights and Ive got no style but love is blind  
  
One love true love real love can last forever  
One love true love real love can last forever  
One love true love real love can last forever
