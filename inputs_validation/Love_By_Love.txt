You found me down  
Hurting bad from his memory  
And I thought love and I were really through  
  
But you reached out  
And touched my heart so tenderly  
You gave me life  
Gave me hope  
Made me blue  
  
Chorus  
Touch by touch  
Youre taking the hurt away  
Smile by smile  
A little more everyday  
Heart to heart  
Youre helping me find a way  
To what I once dreamed of  
Kiss by kiss  
Youre making love sweet again  
Step by Step  
Back on my feet again  
Thanks to you  
Feeling complete again  
Yes you filled me up  
Love by love  
  
Were lying here  
Loving the feeling morning brings  
His memorys fading more with every dawn  
Cause like the sun  
Your loves so warm and gentle thing  
Drives my tears  
Lights my way  
Leaves me up  
  
Chorus x2
