Blow into this paperbag  
Go home stop grinning at everyone  
Blow into this paperbag  
Go home stop grinning at everyone  
  
It was nice when it lasted  
But now its gone  
It was nice when it lasted  
But now its gone  
  
Blow into this paperbag  
  
Take your armor off  
Youre not under attack  
Take your armor off  
Youre not under attack  
  
Come on come on  
Blow into this paperbag  
Go home stop grinning at everyone  
Blow into this paperbag  
Go home stop grinning at everyone  
  
And they were honeybees  
On a blade of grass  
Take your armor off  
Youre not under attack  
  
Blow into this paperbag  
Blow into this paperbag
