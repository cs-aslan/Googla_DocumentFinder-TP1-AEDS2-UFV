He made you feel plain  
When he forgot your name  
Let me tell you something  
I have felt the same  
I know youre in pain  
But be another boy along the way  
And God he made you beautiful and  
Theres nothin about you thats plain  
You are jewel youre a treasure  
You are one of a kind  
And you shine just as bright  
As the stars in the sky  
Youre a rare kind of wonder  
Created just right  
So keep your head up no matter the pain  
Theres nothing about you thats plain  
No no no  
You tell me youre not the type  
The kind of girl that they like  
And your a little insecure about  
How you look in their eyes  
Well fashion will change  
And trends come and go everyday  
But God only made one of you and  
Theres nothin about you thats plain  
Cause you are a jewel youre a treasure  
You are one of a kind and  
You shine just as bright as  
The stars in the sky

So keep your head up no matter the pain  
Theres nothin about you thats plain  
See your mind it is precious  
Though your heart may be restless  
And your eyes they will see  
All that youre meant to be  
Cause your spirit is strong  
And your soul carries on  
Youll keep your head up no matter the pain  
Theres nothin about you thats plain  
You know Ive had my days  
When I feel out of place yeah  
I look at who I am cover what I can  
I wish it all would change but  
Take the makeup away  
You see the same girl still remains  
She may not feel that beautiful  
But theres nothin about her thats plain  
And you are jewel youre a treasure  
You are one of a kind  
And you shine just as bright  
As the stars in the sky  
Youre a rare kind of wonder
