Toyland toy land  
Liittle girl and boy land  
While you dwell within it  
You are ever happy there  
  
Childhoods joy land  
Miistic merry toy land  
Once you pass its borders  
You can neer return again  
  
When youve grown up my dears  
And are as old as I  
Youll laugh and ponder on the years  
That roll so swiftly by my dears  
That roll so swiiftly bywhy  
  
Childhoods joy land  
Miistic merry toy land  
Once you pass its borders  
You can neer return again
