They came flying from far away now Im under their spell  
I love hearing the stories that they tell  
Theyve seen places beyond my land and theyve found new horizons  
They speak strangely but I understand  
  
And I dream Im an eagle  
And I dream I can spread my wings  
Flying high high Im a bird in the sky  
Im an eagle that rides on the breeze  
High high what a feeling to fly  
Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please  
  
As all good friends we talk all night and we fly wing to wing  
I have questions and they know everything  
Theres no limit to what I feel we climb higher and higher  
Am I dreaming or is it all real  
  
Is it true Im an eagle  
Is it true I can spread my wings  
Flying high high Im a bird in the sky Im an eagle  
Im an eagle that rides on the breeze  
High high what a feeling to fly What a feeling  
Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please
