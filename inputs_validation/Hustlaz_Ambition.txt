Everybody wanna be like me  
Yall can be like me  
Look at my watch  
Look at my wrist  
Nothin like ya man he aint shinin like this  
Nothin like ya man he aint grindin like this  
And even if he was he aint fuckin with cause  
  
I came so far from the bottom couldnt even see the top  
Just as soon as a fill the trap Im rippin up every block  
Ima good god fearin man with a criminal mind state  
Aint nobody gave a shit and thats why we grind weight  
My grandma off in the church while Im in the refrigerator  
In search of the baking soda right next to the mashed potatoes  
She prayin for better days Im prayin they take this water  
Realest and stun and ship put that day on my mothers daughter  
  
Chorus  
My ambitions as a hustla i wont deny it I wont deny it  
My ambitions as a hustla i wont deny it im a straight hustla I wont deny it
Repeat x3  
  
Its Mr Trap or die yeah yall remember me  
First album was a classic them critics werent feelin me  
Now as far as award shows we all know how that goes  
So whats all the doubt about because he aint sellin out  
Because he aint givin up because he dont give a fuck  
Because he aint changin up I guess he aint lean enough  
And just know Im savin up let you play with my sanity  
Gives a fuck what you think of me unless you feedin my family  
Mother fuck all my enemies one time for my mini mes  
Listen to these niggas I bet you hear plenty me  
Im who they pretend to be the one they pretend to do  
See me Im a hustla I do what my hustlaz do  
  
Chorus  
  
Might not just be the best just know I plan to be  
I refuse to let suckers win but thats just the man in me  
Look it could be the G in me these niggas aint seein me  
Unless they seein me in traffic and somethin topic and drastic  
I say I grind like there 10 of me swear to god theres just one of me  
Look I know I aint there yet just know that Im gonna be  
I couldnt wait to see the day I could change where my momma stay  
Put the bs behind me theres too much money in front of me  
  
Chorus
