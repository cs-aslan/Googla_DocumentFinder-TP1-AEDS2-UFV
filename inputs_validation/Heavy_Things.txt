Things are falling down on me  
Heavy things I could not see  
When I finally came around  
Something small would pin me down  
When I tried to step aside  
I moved to where they hoped Id be  
  
Vanessa calls me on the phone  
Reminding me Im not alone  
I fuss and quake and cavitate  
I try to speak and turn to stone  
  
Telly reaches through my vest  
To do the thing that she does best  
She probes and tears my ventricles  
Steals my one remaining breath  
  
Things are falling down on me  
Heavy things I could not see  
When I finally came around  
Something small would pin me down  
When I tried to step aside  
I moved to where they hoped Id be  
  
Stumbling as I fall from grace  
She needs my vision to replace  
Her ailing sight throughout the night  
Leaving two holes in my face  
  
Mary was a friend Id say  
Till one summer day  
She borrowed everything I owned  
And then simply ran away  
  
Things are falling down on me  
Heavy things I could not see  
When I finally came around  
Something small would pin me down  
When I tried to step inside  
I moved to where they hoped Id be
