Mamas pack their lunches kiddies pack their guns  
Wishing it will go away but nothings getting done  
A shot heard round the world when a mothers baby dies  
We the people point our fingers blame and wonder why  
Face it and fight or turn high tail and run  
Til it comes back again like the rising sun  
Say they do all they can its just another lie  
The answers plain to see nobody wants to try  
Theres no recess and no rules in the school of life  
I f you listen very closely you will see what its like  
Have cool will travel  
Tell myself it aint true they just cannot see  
Grown up or sewn up the medicine is worse than the disease  
I have cool will travel  
Here we go
