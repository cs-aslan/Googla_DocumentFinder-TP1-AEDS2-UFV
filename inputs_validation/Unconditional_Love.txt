What a man  
You know its a bright and shiny day  
I want to say something to you  
I love you just like ja do  
  
We know a place  
Where jas people can run free  
A new kind of love  
And we call it agape  
Dont take too long to find  
True love transcends all time  
That nonreacting everlasting love  
  
Chorus x2  
Give me your unconditional love  
The kind of love I deserve  
The kind I want to return  
  
Dont try to change or tear your  
Brother down  
Let him make his mistakes  
And he will come around  
Hasten just to pray and jas true  
Word obey  
In nonreacting everlasting love  
  
Chorus x3  
  
Give me your unconditional love  
My torn heart to discern  
This agape love to learn  
  
Hasten just to pray and jas true  
Word obey  
In nonreacting everlasting love  
  
Chorus x3
