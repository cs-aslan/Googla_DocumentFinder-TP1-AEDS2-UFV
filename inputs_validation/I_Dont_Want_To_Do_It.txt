Looking back upon my youth  
The time I always knew the truth  
I dont want to do it  
I dont want to say goodbye  
  
To go back in the yard and play  
If I could only have another day  
I dont want to do it  
I dont want to make you cry  
  
To go back  
On the hill beside the track  
And try to concentrate  
All in all the places that I want to be  
No it shows you that I could not wait  
  
So come back into my arms again  
This love of ours it has no end  
I dont want to do it  
I dont want to make you cry  
  
I dont want to do it  
I dont want to say goodbye  
  
I dont want to do it  
I dont want to see you cry  
  
To go back  
On the hill beside the track  
And try to concentrate  
All in all the places that I want to be  
No it shows you that I could not wait  
  
So come back into my arms again  
This love of ours it has no end  
I dont want to do it  
I dont want to say goodbye  
  
I dont want to do it  
I dont want to say goodbye  
  
I dont want to do it  
I dont want to make you cry
