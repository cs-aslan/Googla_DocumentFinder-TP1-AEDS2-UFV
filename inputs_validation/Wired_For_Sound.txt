Chorus  
Word of mouth is the counselor  
There is no need for proof  
In a world thats wired for sound  
The tongue becomes the mighty sword  
That battles the truth  
In a world thats wired for sound  
Comin on like a tidal wave  
That washes through the braina state of mind  
No dispute when the noise is made  
And so it lets the blind lead the blind  
Lured by charisma to be swayed to believe  
  
Chorus  
  
Easier believing what is hard to get rid of than to try  
Never searchingjust accepting  
Feeds the mind enough to get you by  
  
Scratching the surface yet to dig deeper down  
  
Chorus  
Word of mouth is the counselor  
There is no need for proof  
In a world thats wired for sound  
The tongue becomes the mighty sword  
That battles the truth  
In a world thats wired for sound  
Wisdom from the sacred page  
Is turned and ignored  
In a world thats wired for sound  
  
Chorus
