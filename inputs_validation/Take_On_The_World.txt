You got to leave your seat you gotta get up upon your feet  
Youre gonna move ya to the rhythm till you never can stop  
We got the power we got the music and you bet that you can use it  
Were gonna take rockbottom were gonna take it to the top  
  
Put yourself in our hands so our voices can be heard  
And together we will take on all the world  
Put yourself in our hands so our voices can be heard  
And together we will take on all the world  
  
Move a little nearer you know you gotta follow your leaders  
As we need you like you need us for sure  
Were gonna drive you were gonna ride you were gonna get right inside you  
And if you wanna keep going just shout out for more  
  
Put yourself in our hands so our voices can be heard  
And together we will take on all the world  
Put yourself in our hands so our voices can be heard  
And together we will take on all the world  
  
Sing your song well listen to you  
Sing your song the spotlights are you  
  
Put yourself in our hands so our voices can be heard  
And together we will take on all the world  
Put yourself in our hands so our voices can be heard  
And together we will take on all the world  
  
Put yourself in our hands so our voices can be heard  
And together we will take on all the world  
Put yourself in our hands so our voices can be heard  
And together we will take on all the world
