Take my life  
Time has been twisting the knife  
I dont recognize  
People I care for  
  
Take my dreams  
Childish and weak at the seams  
Please dont analyze  
Please just be there for me  
  
The things that I know  
Nobody told me  
The seeds that are sown  
They still control me  
Theres a liar in my head  
Theres a thief upon my bed  
And the strangest thing  
Is I cannot seem to get my eyes open  
  
Take my hand  
Lead me to some peaceful land  
That I cannot find  
Inside my head  
  
Wake me with love  
Its all I need  
But in all this time  
Still no one said  
  
If I had not asked  
Would you have told me  
If you call this love  
Why dont you hold me  
  
Theres a liar in my head  
Theres a thief upon my bed  
And the strangest thing  
Is I cannot seem to get my eyes open  
  
Give me something I can hold  
Give me something to believe in  
I am frightened for my soul please please  
Make love to me send love through me  
Heal me with your crime  
The only one who ever knew me  
Weve wasted so much time  
So much time
