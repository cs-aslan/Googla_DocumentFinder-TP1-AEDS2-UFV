Woke up with a heavy head  
And I thought about leavin town  
I could have died if I wanted to  
Slipped over the edge and drowned  
But oh no baby I wont give up that easy no  
  
Too many tire tracks in the sands of time  
Too many love affairs that stop on a dime  
Oh well oh baby  
I think its time to make some changes round here  
  
Yeah Im gonna tear it up  
Gonna trash it up  
Im gonna round it up  
Gonna shake it up  
Oh no baby I will not lie down  
  
Im brave enough to be crazy  
Im strong enough to be weak  
I see all these heroes with feet of clay  
Whose mighty ships have sprung a leak  
And I want you to tell me darlin  
Just what do you believe in now  
  
Well cmon over here baby  
You bout to gimme a heart attack  
I want to wrap my lovin arms  
Around the small of your back  
Yeah and Im gonna pull you pull you pull you  
Pull you right up close to me yeah  
  
Yeah were gonna tear it up  
We gonna trash it up  
Gonna round it up  
Gonna shake it up  
Oh no no no I will not lie down  
  
Turn this thing around  
I will not go quietly  
I will not lie down  
I will not go quietly  
I will not lie down  
I will not go quietly  
I will not lie down  
I will not lie down no  
  
Well dont you ever get lonely  
Dont you ever get down  
Dont you ever get tired of all the wicked tongues in this town  
Of baby I just want to take you away from here  
  
I aint no tiger  
I aint no little lamb  
Suppose you tell me mama  
Who do you think I think I am  
And ooh baby dont you give a damn  
  
Yeah Im gonna tear it up  
Gonna trash it up  
Gonna round it up  
Gonna rip it up  
I will not lie down  
  
Yeah Im gonna tear it up  
Gonna trash it up  
Gonna round it up  
Gonna shake it up  
Oh baby I will not lie down  
  
Turn this thing around  
I will not go quietly  
I will not lie down  
I will no go quietly  
I will not lie down
