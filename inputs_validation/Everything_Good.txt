Onward I always say  
These things happen everyday  
I should be able to smile by now  
But I dont remember how  
  
Chorus  
With you went warmth in summer  
All of the stars in the sky  
With you went perfect sunsets  
Sleeping my way through the night  
Yeah with you went  
Everything good in this world  
  
Desperate for your touch  
I havent been needing much  
Why let the music play  
I cant hear it anyway  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause with you went  
The scent of flowers  
Dont they just die anyway  
And with you went  
  
All the rainbows  
Now when it rains its just gray  
Yeah with you went  
Everything good in this world  
  
And I thought of doing something rash  
In the hopes of making you feel bad  
But it seems that its always me that ends up cryin  
  
Chorus  
  
With you went  
All the rainbows  
Now when it rains its just gray  
Ah with you went  
  
Everything good  
Everything good  
In my world
