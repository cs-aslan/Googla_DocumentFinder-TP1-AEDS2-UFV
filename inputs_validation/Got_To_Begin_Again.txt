Well so here I am at the end of the road  
Where do I go from here  
I always figured it would be like this  
Still nothing seems to be quite clear  
  
All the words have been spoken and the prophecy fulfilled  
But I just cant decide where to go  
Yes its been quite a day and I should go to sleep  
But tomorrow I will wake up and Ill know  
  
That Ive got to begin again  
Though I dont know how to start  
Yes Ive got to begin again  
And its hard  
  
Well its been quite a while since I lifted my head  
And Im sure the light will hurt my eyes  
I see the way that I been spendin my days  
And reality has caught me by surprise  
  
I was dreamin of tomorrow so I sacrificed today  
And it sure was a grand waste of time  
And despite all the truth thats been thrown in my face  
I just cant get you out of my mind  
  
But Ive got to begin again  
Though I dont know how to start  
Yes Ive got to begin again  
And its hard
