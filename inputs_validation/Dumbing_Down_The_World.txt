Im dumbing down the world  
Yes Im dumbing down the world  
And my head is held high  
And the glint in my eye  
And my arrogance rumbles before me  
  
Im dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
Im dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
And my thoughts are banal  
Like a stagnant canal  
And my sycophants shamble behind me  
  
Im dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
Im dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
And my hour is come around is come around   
Yes my hour is come around its come around  
  
Look around   
Im dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
And my works are designed  
To suck blood from your mind  
For your energy feeds and sustains me  
  
Im dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
Im dumbing down the world  
Im dumbing down the world  
Im dumbing down the world and I love it
