Wide eyes show white  
White enough to shoot  
But if you aint got the strength to fight it  
and you just cant hide it  
And I aint gonna open my eyes anymore  
aint gonna open my eyes anymore  
Pale faces burn  
I wouldve thought by now wed learn  
But every fool still waits their turn in  
the rotisseries turning  
Well I aint gonna open my eyes anymore  
I aint gonna open my eyes anymore  
I aint gonna open my eyes anymore
