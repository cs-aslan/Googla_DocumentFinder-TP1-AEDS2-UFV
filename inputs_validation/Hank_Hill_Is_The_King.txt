Hes got the whitest legs this side of Montana  
Never seen a situation he couldnt handle  
No hell never give in and he always helps his friends  
But the world today sure looks strange to him  
His trade mark his big square grey glasses  
He wears tshirts he dont care about high fashion  
When he plays his guitar in his mind hes a star  
Im telling you Hank Hill is the king  
  
Cause a hick is a hick a hick is a hick  
And a dude is a dude a dude is a dude  
A squirrel is a squirrel and a nut is a nut and I love his attitude  
Theres only one show thats worth a damn on the tube  
Yeah hes my hero a man Id be proud to know  
Im telling you Hank Hill is the king  
  
Now our kind of food is barbeque and steaks  
We hate jet skis and beaches  
We like fishing boats and lakes  
Close as heaven I can go is watching hunting and fishing shows  
And hanging out down at the hardware store  
Now Texas that is one beautiful place  
We dont have as many weirdos as New York and L A  
We got our ideology and politics just right you see  
Hes our only hope a man wed be proud tp know  
Im telling you Hank Hill is the king  
  
Cause a hick is a hick a hick is a hick  
And a dude is a dude a dude is a dude  
A freak is a freak and a nut is a nut and I love his attitude  
Theres only one show thats worth a damn on the tube  
Yeah hes my hero a man Id be proud to know  
Im telling you Hank Hill is the king  
Hank Hill is the king
