Chorus  
When you need it call me on the phone tonight  
Its on its on its on  
Bodys callin vibrate in reggaeton  
Its on its on  
  
 like a drive  
In my lifes real got no by  
You can ask anybody that sweep me  
How that little chick on right years ago  
You tricked you stop but then little chick on pitbull  
He was a picking up rappers like know us off  
Two at a time nigga  
Who would have thought  
 on the rappers not to take it the  
If you cant finish dont start hey  
If you cant finish dont start hey  
If you cant finish dont start hey  
  
Chorus
