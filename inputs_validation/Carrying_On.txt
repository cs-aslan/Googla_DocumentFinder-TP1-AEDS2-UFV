The waves on the shore cant be ignored  
Soon theyre all around you  
The cavalry fail theyve all gone  
But youre holding on  
Somehow is not what you asked for  
  
Why do you cry in the morning  
When the line is just forming  
I know you think Im just carrying on  
When Ive been where youre going  
And its not worth knowing  
Burning the days Im just carrying on  
  
The search for the way to harvest the pain  
Cause all of is contagious  
Knowing your head no control of what you let go  
Sometimes its not what you dreamed of  
  
Why do you cry in the mornig  
When the line is just forming  
I know you think Im just carrying on  
When Ive been where youre going  
And its not worth knowing  
Burning the days Im just carrying on  
  
And after all that youve forgotten  
You still dont understand  
You think the world broke its promise  
But it just slipped right through your hands  
  
Tell me why do you cry in the morning  
When the line is just forming  
I know you think Im just carrying on  
But Ive been where youre going  
And its not worth knowing  
Burning the days Im just carrying on  
  
Oh carrying on  
  
The waves on the shore  
Cant be ignored
