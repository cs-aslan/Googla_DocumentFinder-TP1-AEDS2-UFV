Im standing all alone out in the pouring rain  
And though it really isnt like me to complain  
I think Im getting used to it  
I feel happy and I also feel bad  
Ive never been here but somehow I think I have  
But Im getting used to it  
  
Ive never been lost like this  
Ive never been lost like this  
But I wouldnt be happy anywhere else  
Nobody to tell us what to do all by ourselves  
  
Dont know how I got here and I dont know why I stay  
The poets all around are laughing in their graves  
Must be something that I said  
This place is not like anything Ive seen before  
The spirits move around the houses have no doors  
But Im getting used to it  
  
Ive never been lost like this  
Ive never been lost like this  
But I wouldnt be happy anywhere else  
Nobody to tell us what to do all by ourselves  
  
Isnt this a fine hello  
I wish I hadnt seen you go  
Its always been a bitter pill  
The broken mirrors broken still  
The letters never made the post  
A thousand more I never wrote  
And here on dark unfriendly streets  
I find the comfort that I seek  
And Im happy and Ive been happy  
  
Ive never been lost like this  
Ive never been lost like this  
But I wouldnt be happy anywhere else  
Nobody to tell us what to do all by ourselves  
  
Ive never been lost like this  
Ive never been lost like this  
But I wouldnt be ha  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah wo wo yeah yeah yeah yeah
