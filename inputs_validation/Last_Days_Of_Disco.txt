Saw you at a party  
You asked me to dance  
Said music was great for dancing  
I dont really dance much  
But this time I did  
And I was glad that I did this time  
And the song said Lets be happy  
I was happy  
It never made me happy before  
And the song said Dont be lonely  
It makes me lonely  
I hear it and Im lonely more and more  
Where I belong where I belong  
I wasnt dressed right I rarely am  
You told me that you didnt care  
I laughed as you wobbled in your platform shoes  
You laughed when I called Andrea true Anita Ward  
And the song said Lets be happy  
I was happy  
It never made me happy before  
And the song said Dont be lonely  
It makes me lonely  
I hear it and Im lonely more and more  
Where I belong where I belong  
And the song said Lets be happy  
I was happy  
It never made me happy before  
It asked Do you remember  
And I remember remember like it wasnt long ago  
And the song said Dont be lonely  
It makes me lonely  
I hear it and Im lonely more and more  
Where I belong where I belong
