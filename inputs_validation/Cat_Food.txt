Lady Supermarket with an apple in her basket  
Knocks in the managers door  
Grooming to the muzak from a speaker in shoe rack  
Lays out her goods on the floor  
Everything shes chosen is conveniently frozen  
Eat it and come back for more  
  
Lady Window Shopper with a new one in the hopper  
Whips up a chemical brew  
Croaking to a neighbor while she polishes a sabre  
Knows how to flavor a stew  
Never need to worry with a tin of Hurri Curri  
Poisoned especially for you  
  
No use to complain  
If youre caught out in the rain  
Your mothers quite insane  
Cat food cat food cat food again  
  
Lady Yellow Stamper with a fillet in a hamper  
Dying to finish the course  
Goodies for the table with a fable on the label  
Drowning in miracle sauce  
Dont think I am that rude if I tell you that its cat food  
Not even fit for a horse
