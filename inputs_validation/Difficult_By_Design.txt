Its a heartache  
And the happiness  
That wont let you rest  
Its a pleasure  
  
And the pain that comes  
When you love someone  
You spend so much time  
Trying to get it right  
  
Dont ask the reason why  
Its a part of life  
  
Chorus  
Our love can be difficult at times  
But it was by design  
Our love was difficult at times  
But it was by design  
  
Its a laughter  
Beyond the tears  
That you need to hear  
But you know that  
You can make it through  
When a love is true  
It feels like a lonely road  
You dont know which way to go  
How I want you to know  
You are not alone  
  
Chorus  
  
Love is difficult  
But its by design  
Love is difficult  
But its by design  
  
Love is difficult  
But its by design  
Love is difficult  
But its by design  
  
Repeat Chorus
