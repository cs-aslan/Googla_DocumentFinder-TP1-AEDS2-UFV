Wish everybody would leave me alone yeah  
Theyre always calling on my telephone  
When I pick it up theres no one there  
So I walk outside just to take the air  
Come on with me cruising down the street  
Who knows what youll see who you might meet  
This brave new worlds not like yesterday  
It can take you higher than the milky way  
  
Now Im blinded I cant really see yeah  
No more bright lights confusing me no  
Dont ask me why Im feeling blue  
Cause loving you is all I can do  
Hey goodlooking boys gather around  
The sidewalk papers gutterpress you down  
All those lies can be so unkind  
They can make you feel like youre losing your mind  
  
Street Life  
Street Life  
Street Life  
What a Life  
  
Back to nature boys Vasser girls too  
Watch what you say or think or do  
Continentalstyle strasse girls might  
But you know exactly if its wrong or right  
Education is an important key yes  
But the good lifes never won by degrees no  
  
Pointless passing through Harvard or Yale  
Only window shopping its strictly no sale  
Week end starts Friday soon after eight  
Your jet black magic helps you celebrate  
You may be stranded if you stick around  
And thats really something
