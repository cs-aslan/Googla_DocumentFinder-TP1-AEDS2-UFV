Give Her The Gun  
Downtown drive by a drink card in her hand  
All night hustler parking by the stand  
Full blown engine she comes on like a fight  
Give her the gun boy youd better hold on tight  
I dont know why she brings me on  
I dont know why ooh but she brings me on  
Shes a right runner real mean mother too  
I cant wait to see her break in front of you  
Making a movie star upon the screen  
If daddys looking you come on like a queen  
I dont know why she brings me on  
I dont know why but she brings me on  
  
Downtown drive by a drink card in her hand  
All night hustler parking by the stand  
Full blown engines she comes on like a fight  
Give her the gun boy you better hold on tight
