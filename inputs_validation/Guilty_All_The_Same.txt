Rakim  
Yeah you already know what it is  
Can yall explain what kind of man is destined  
When a man has plans of being rich  
If he falls off his plans hes wealthy  
Dirty money scheme a clean split  
Nonsense the same he didnt call for this hes filthy  
Talk team they take the paper route  
All they think about is bank accounts assets and realty  
Anybodys expense no shame with a clear conscience  
No regrets and guilt free you claim that aint the way that he built me  
Smoke scream were going in flames  
Know as soon as theyre done what the deal be  
Say its time for things to change  
We arrange that dope product we built cheap  
Anything if its more to gain  
Dream manipulated like artists its real deep  
Until no more remains but Im still me  
Like authentic hiphop and rock to pop and radio  
You record companies kill me  
Try to force me to strain it no way  
They got the gall to say yo how real can real be  
You feel me You will see the greed will be to blame  
Greedy for the fame tv or a name  
Media the game to me your all the same  
Youre guilty  
  
Chorus  
Youre guilty all the same too sick to be ashamed  
You want to point your finger but theres no one else to blame  
Youre guilty all the same too sick to be ashamed  
You want to point your finger but theres no one else to blame  
Theres no one else to blame guilty all the same all the same all the
same  
Guilty all the same all the same all the same  
Guilty all the same
