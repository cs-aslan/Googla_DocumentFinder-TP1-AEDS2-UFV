You gotta keepem separated  
  
You like the latest fashions  
Youd like to keepem clean  
You take a trip every week to the laundromat  
Throw a load in the washing machine  
  
But if you dont wanna ruin your clothes  
You gotta sortem out first as everyone knows  
Remember bright colors and the other dont mix  
Before you washem up washem up washem up washem up  
Hey  
  
Are your undies turning pink  
Takeem out You gotta keepem separated  
Heyay Are your cottons gonna shrink  
Sortem out You gotta keepem separated  
  
Heyay then when its time  
You can stickem in the dryeryou can hangem on a lieine  
Heyay Its Laundry Day
