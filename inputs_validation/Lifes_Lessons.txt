Mmm  
I listen and still I havent heard  
Tell me what is the word  
And if I ever heard it would it be clear as water  
Oh tears run down your face  
Reflects the human race  
Were all caught up with winnin losin time and space  
  
Lifes lessons  
So you think you know it all  
But youre headin for a fall  
Ooh to make it back again  
Youll have to crawl and step back  
Take a look around  
Are your feet still on the ground  
Can we find you in the section of lost and found  
  
Never think you got it figured out  
Cause when you do you begin to doubt  
Its time for you to open your eyes  
  
Will we look back and see what weve done  
Will we be proud or ashamed of what weve become  
Will we realize we all share one fate  
Or is this another lifes lesson Too late  
  
Oohh  
Never think youve got it figured out  
Cause when you do you begin to doubt  
Its time for you to open your eyes  
  
Oohh  
Will we look back and see what weve done  
Will we be proud or ashamed of what weve become  
Will we realize we all share one fate  
Is this another lifes lesson Too late  
  
Will we look back and see what weve done  
OohhOohh  
Will we realize we all share one fate  
Oohh lifes lessons  
OohhOohhOohh yeah lifes lessons  
Oohh lifes lessons  
  
Will we look back and see what weve done  
Will we realize we all share one fate
