What you go and do  
You go and give the boy a gun  
Now there aint place to run to  
Aint no place to run to  
  
When he hold it in his hand  
He feel mighty he feel strong  
Now there aint no place to run to  
Aint no place to run  
  
One day he may come back  
Repay us for what weve done  
Then where you gonna run to  
Where you gonna run  
  
But one fine day  
All our problems will be solved  
Bang bang bang  
Well shoot him down  
  
Give him drugs and give him candy  
Anything to make him think hes happy  
And he wont ever come for us  
He wont ever come  
  
But if he does  
And if theres no one else around  
Bang bang bang  
Well shoot him down  
  
If he preys only on his neighbors  
Brothers sisters and friends  
Well consider it a favor  
Well consider justice done  
  
But if he comes for you or me  
And we can place a gun in his hand  
Bang bang bang  
Well shoot him dead  
  
What you go and do  
You go and give the boy a gun  
Now there aint no place to run to  
Aint no place to run  
  
Now well all be at his mercy  
If he decides to hunt us down  
Cause there aint no place to run to  
Aint no place to run  
  
If he wants the chances that you took from him  
And nothing that you own  
Then therell be no place to run to  
Therell be no place to run  
  
And if he finds himself to be  
A reflection of us all  
Bang bang bang  
Hell shoot us down  
  
Before you can raise your eyes to read  
The writing on the wall  
Bang bang bang  
Hell shoot you down  
  
Before you can bridge the gulf between  
And embrace him in your arms  
Bang bang bang  
Hell shoot you down
