We were neurophobic and perfect  
The day that we lost our souls  
Maybe we werent so human  
But If we cry we cry we will rust  
And I was a hand grenade  
That never stopped exploding  
You were automatic and as hollow as the o in god  
  
I never gonna be the one for you  
I never gonna save the world from you  
Theyll never be good for you  
Bad to you  
Theyll never be anything  
Anything at all  
  
You were my mechanical bride  
A Phenobarbidoll  
A manniqueen of depression  
With the face of a dead star  
And I was a hand grenade  
That never stopped exploding  
You were automatic and as hollow as the o in god  
  
I am never gonna be the one for you  
I never gonna save the world from you  
Theyll never be good for you  
Bad to you  
Theyll never be anything  
Anything at all  
Theyll never be good for you  
Bad to you  
Theyll never be anything  
Anything at all  
I am never gonna be the one for you  
I never gonna save the world from you  
  
  
This isnt me Im not mechanical  
Im just a boy playing the suicide ki ng  5x
