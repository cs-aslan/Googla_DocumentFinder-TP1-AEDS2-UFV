This whiskey sour amateur hour  
Raise your glass and toast your friends  
Some day we will fight again well  
Your enemies your tragedies  
Pocket knifes and rusty chains  
Where in the hell is the old gang yeah  
  
And all the losers  
Cant even win for losing  
And the beginners  
Dont even know what song theyre singing  
  
Well theres no one left around  
And youre the last gang in town  
And your heart cant even break  
When it doesnt even pound  
  
Well theres no one left around  
And youre the last gang in town  
And your heart cant even break  
When it doesnt even pound  
  
This broken scene is turning green  
Brass knuckles left in the rain  
Death wish kids among the living  
I want to ride on the divided  
Anything but the mainstream  
Where the fuck is your old gang man  
  
Well theres no one left around  
And youre the last gang in town  
And your heart cant even break  
When it doesnt even pound  
  
Well theres no one left around  
And youre the last gang in town  
And your heart cant even break  
When it doesnt even pound  
  
So long  
Didnt even say goodnight  
So long  
Theres nowhere to go  
When youre hiding in plain sight  
  
Well theres no one left around  
And youre the last gang in town  
And your heart cant even break  
When it doesnt even pound  
  
Well theres no one left around  
And youre the last gang in town  
And your heart cant even break  
When it doesnt even pound  
  
Well theres no one left around  
And youre the last gang in town  
And your heart cant even break  
When it doesnt even pound
