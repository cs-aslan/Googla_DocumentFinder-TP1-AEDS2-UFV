Just divorced was written  
On the window of the car  
It looked like a tombstone  
Parked beside the local bar  
Once hed drove it crazy  
Now hes driven it too far  
Just divorced was written  
On the window of the car  
  
Someone wrote in soap  
Its over right across the hood  
On the door it said good riddance  
Boy I feel good  
On the fender were the words  
I wont be home tonight  
And the jukebox in the bar played  
If youre gonna do me wrong do it right  
Laughed so hard I thought now  
Theres a guy whos got some spunk  
What a sense of humor  
It said goodbye on the trunk  
Tin cans tied with paper streamers  
Pointing to the bar  
Just divorced was written  
On the window of the car  
Just divorced was written
