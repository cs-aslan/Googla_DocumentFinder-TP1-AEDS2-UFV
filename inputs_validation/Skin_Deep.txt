Sometimes I feel lost in a sea of insecurity  
That rages inside of me so terribly caught  
And the waves of selfrejection  
Make me question my ability  
But theres a fire that always burns  
And theres a voice inside  
And all it wants is to be heard  
Cause beyond skin deep  
Theres so much more to see  
My hopes my dreams designed with destiny  
I was fashioned with passion  
A burning desire to know  
The One who made me more  
He made me more than skin deep  
Cause I am more I am more than skin deep  
So much more  
Its so hard to change  
When we are captive to ourselves  
Always thirsty for something else  
But free or enslaved  
We are sons we are daughters  
Called out by the Fathers name  
So take the fire and let it burn  
Unleash the voice inside  
Cause everyone needs to be heard  
Beyond skin deep  
Theres so much more to see  
Our hopes our dreams designed with destiny  
We were fashioned with passion  
A burning desire to know  
The One who made us more  
He made us more than skin deep  
Cause we are more we are more than skin deep  
So much more  
We are more than the future  
We are more than the past  
We were made to bring glory  
Given souls that will last  
We are more than our bodies  
We are more than the grave  
We were bought by His blood  
And from ourselves weve been saved
