All I care about is money and the city that Im from  
Ima sip until I feel it  
Ima smoke until its done  
I dont really give a fuck  
And my excuse is that Im young  
And Im only getting older  
Somebody shoula told ya  
Im on one  
Fuck it Im on one  
I said Im on one  
Fuck it Im on one  
A strong on  
2 white cups and I got that drink  
It could be purple it could be pink  
Depending on how you mix that shit  
Money to be gotten Ima get that shit  
Cause Im on one  
Fuck it Im on one  
Ah yeah ah yeah  
  
You know what I like  
Oh yes oh yeah  
Oh yes oh yeah  
Oh yes oh yeah  
  
You know what Im sippin

But youre the only one  
Cause I dont trust these bitches  
I dont I dont trust these bitches  
They might catch me slipping  
So youre the only one  
Cause I dont trust these bitches  
They might they might catch me slipping  
And put in something different  
So youre the only one  
Cause I dont trust these bitches

They might catch me slipping  
So youre the only one

Kid game run game run it real good  
But never ever have my bitches sitting court side  
Same nigga that you knew way back when  
You acting like its somebody you dont know  
Tell me how the fuck we supposed to stay friends  
When you got a bunch of feelings that you dont show  
I can tell I can tell I can tell certain people dont like me no more  
New shit dont excite me no more  
Guess they didnt really make em like me no more  
You can look me in my eyes and see I aint myself  
Cause if yall what I created then I hate myself  
But still let them girls in  
And tell em all leave them cellphones on the table where we see em  
Im all day wit it man am to the pm  
Niggas hatin I just wish that they would say it when we see em all  
  
Thats that shit that drives me crazy  
And its all that Ive been getting lately

Women wanna fuck like that mean Im them  
Looking for somethings and I think that I can find them  
In you in you
