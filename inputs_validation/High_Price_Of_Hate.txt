Got the eyes of a vulture  
As you gaze from your meaningless throne  
And the pain that youve been selling  
Id rather die before Id own  
  
Ill call you a doctor  
Or find you a priest  
Cause no one can save you  
And you wont get no peace  
  
Ive felt your displeasure  
And girl I used to relate  
So dont hand me no anger  
Ill be crushed by the weight  
  
Thats the high price of hate  
Thats the high price of hate  
Lord whats the cost of my fate  
  
Shell lay out wide open  
Like a surgical knife  
Ive watched it take over  
Whats left of your miserable life  
  
Shell live on deception  
Your pleasures long dead  
Your soul is left bleeding  
From the lies that you spread  
  
Dont pull on my collar  
I wont rise to debate  
Dont ask me for comfort  
Youre a lifetime too late  
  
Thats the high price of hate  
Thats the high price of hate  
Lord whats the cost of my fate  
  
Oh theres a storm overhead  
Will it ever end baby  
Its all inside your head  
Is it gonna end  
  
Thats the high price of hate  
Thats the high price of hate  
Yeah I hope I aint asking too late  
Thats the high price of hate  
Thats the high price of hate
