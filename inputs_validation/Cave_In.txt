Please take a long hard look through your text book  
Cause Im history  
When I strap my helmet on Ill be long gone  
Cause Ive been dying to leave  
Yeah Ill ride the range and hide all my loose change  
In my bedroom  
Cause riding a dirt bike down a turnpike  
Always takes its toll on me  
  
Ive had just about enough  
Of quote diamonds in the rough  
Because my backbone is paper thin  
Get me out of this cavern  
Or Ill cave in Ill cave in Ill cave in  
  
If the bombs go off  
The sun will still be shining the sun will still be shining  
Because weve heard it said that every mushroom cloud  
Has a silver lining  
Though were always undermining too deep to know  
Swallow a drop of gravel and blacktop  
Cause the road tastes like wintergreen  
The wind and the rain smell of oil and octane  
Mixed with stale gasoline  
Ill soak up the sound trying to sleep on the wet ground  
Ill get ten minutes giveortake  
Cause I just dont foresee myself getting drowsy  
When cold integrity keeps me wide awake  
  
Get me out of this cavern  
Or Ill cave in cave in cave in cave in cave in cave in  
Get me out of this cavern  
Or Ill cave in  
  
Ill keep my helmet on just in case my head caves in in case my head caves
in  
Cause if my thoughts collapse or my framework snaps  
Itll make a mess like you wouldnt believe  
Tie my handlebars to the stars so I stay on track so I stay on track  
And if my intentions stray Ill wrench them away  
Then Ill take my leave and I wont even look back  
  
I wont even look back
