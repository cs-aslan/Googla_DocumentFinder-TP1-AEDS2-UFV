Camilla come here  
Camilla come over here  
Where are you hiding  
Come out come out  
Camilla  
Camilla come here  
Camilla come over here  
Where are you hiding  
Come out come out  
Camilla  
Dont raise your head  
Dont raise your eyes  
Dont ever uncover your mouth  
Dont let me ever see you cry  
Or laugh or shout  
Dont raise your standards too high  
Dont raise your standards too high  
Dont you go reading  
Dont you go reading  
Just keep breeding  
Camilla come here  
Camilla come over here  
Where are you hiding  
Come out come out  
Camilla  
Dont raise your head  
Dont raise your eyes  
Dont ever uncover your mouth  
Dont let me ever see you cry  
Or laugh or shout  
Dont raise your standards too high  
Dont raise your standards too high  
Dont you go reading  
Dont you go reading  
Just keep breeding  
And the bird of paradise flies  
Somewhere in the jungle  
Her colors brilliant and bright  
Her rapture free and wild  
So beautiful itd make you cry  
So beautiful Id make you cry  
But thats far away from here
