I regarded the world as such a sad sight  
Until I viewed it in black and white  
Then I reviewed every frame and basic shape  
And sealed the exits with caution tape  
Dont refocus your eyes in the darkness  
And dont remember this place unless  
I describe all the things that you cannot see  
And well unravel the mystery  
  
Farewell all my friends in textbooks cuz Im going home  
Cuz my blood cells cannot depend on the weather in photographs  
Theres a light show out my window somewhere way up there  
Dear Vienna are you singing  
Dear Vienna are you swinging  
Dear Vienna we were happy like the shades of May when we got carried away  
  
I regarded the world as such a sad sight  
Until I viewed it in black and white  
Then I reviewed every frame and basic shape  
And sealed the exits with caution tape  
Dont refocus your eyes in the darkness  
And dont remember this place unless  
I describe all the things that you cannot see  
And well unravel the mystery  
  
I was so far out of place  
Watching those stars in outer space  
cause I am so far from where you are  
  
Theres a light show out my window somewhere way up there  
Dear Vienna are you singing  
Dear Vienna are you swinging  
Dear Vienna we were happy like the shades of May when we got carried away
