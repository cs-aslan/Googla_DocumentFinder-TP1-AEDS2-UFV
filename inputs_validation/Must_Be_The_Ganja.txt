Yea oh oh yea yea oh  
  
I feel like dancing  
I feel like dancing  
  
I smell something in the air thats making me high  
I said I smell something in the air thats making me high  
  
Ok here we go doremifaso Im so ladida so  
Lyrical rise flow give back the tobasco  
You motherfuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs  
Time to show you the mo kick ass flow in the cosmos  
Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole  
She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto  
Knives strangling wives with pig lasso  
Few bags of the the grass zig zags Im with the doc so  
You know how that go skull and the crossbones  
This is poison the boys and girls who do not know  
You do not want to try this at home my novato novice  
This is niether the time or the place to get macho  
So crack a six pack sit back with some nachos  
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow  
Its not what you expected tho what you thought though  
Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke  
  
Chorus  
It must be the ganja  
Its the marijuana  
Thats creeping upon me while Im so high  
Maybe its the hindi that has gotten in me  
Whatevers gotten into me I dont mind  
  
It must be the ganja  
Its the marijuana  
Thats creeping upon me while Im so high  
Maybe its the hindi that has gotten in me  
Whatevers got into me I dont mind  
  
Your dreams of getting the pill you are literally getting the chills  
Spitting at will me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill  
Youre submitting to skill sitting still Im admitting Im beginning to
feel  
Like I dont think anyones real  
Faced with a dilemma I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step
beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer  
Please dont upset me mama you lookin sexy mama  
Dont know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama  
Dont want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer  
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza  
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a
row  
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper  
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper  
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped  
The trunk that they were stuffed in the model the make the plate  
And which motel which lake they found her in  
And how they attacked the victim  
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one  
Which night it was done what kid would write there was none  
So sloppy like this its fun the fuckin ecstasy goes  
  
Chorus  
  
When Im behind a mic dynamite is what its kinda like  
Get stuck with that same stick that youre trying to light  
Behind the boards is Dre legends are made this way  
Isnt it safe to say this is the way it should be  
Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms  
Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some  
He can give her some she can give him some  
Get behind a lynn drum make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome  
Youre spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance Im  
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up  
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a  
Titanium brain thats full of surprises  
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes  
You stare into your stereos eyes  
Good evening this aint even a weed thing  
I aint even smoke anything I aint even drink anything  
  
Chorus
