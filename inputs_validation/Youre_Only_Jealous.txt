Perhaps it was the holiday we spent abroad last year  
It could have been the wine we drank last night  
Possibly the palace needs a second coat of paint  
But that doesnt condone setting it alight  
  
Why does the butler look so smug  
And the gardener well he looks even worse  
Hes sent me every flower that hes dug  
And have you ever seen a chauffeur drive a hearse  
  
Youre only jealous Ah Ah  
Youre only jealous Ah Ah  
Youre only jealous Ah Ah  
Youre only jealous Ah Ah  
  
Perhaps it is the quantity of acres that we own  
It could be their allotments only small  
Maybe we should reconsider giving them a wage  
But a taste of money is worse that none at all  
  
The parlourmaids a deadly quiet lass  
Never really comes out of her shell  
But every time I talk to her she offers me a glass  
Of a drink that she never drinks herself  
  
Youre only jealous  
  
Stir it up  
  
Of the company I keep and the stars you never meet  
Of the caviar they eat whilst youre chewing at your wheat  
Of the hours that they sleep whilst youre sweating in the heat  
Of the masses at their feet and the tongue between their cheek  
Think of stronger than the weak  
Think of vulture and its beak  
Think of oil think of sheikh think of lord and comfy seat  
Think of admiral and fleet think of public school elite  
Think of leaders and their sheep  
Think of butchers and their meat  
Think of leaders and their sheep  
Think of butchers and their meat  
Think of leaders and their sheep  
Think of butchers and their meat
