Yeah  
Ninth wonder  
They tend to say that us rappers  
Are materialistic  
They say we lak substince  
Me tay and L  
Bout to prove them wrong dou  
  
Chorus  
We know what you thinkin love  
You think we out smokin  
Nd drinkin love  
Pushing beard whips  
Chains clinkin love  
Well you dont really kno me  
Lik you think you kno me  
And we kno how you speculate  
Thinkin we gone hit your friend  
If you object a date  
Claim we early but be showin up extra late love  
But you dont really kno me like you think you kno me  
  
DRAKE  
They dont be sayin that Im humble  
And Im hella nice  
But Ive been approached ta sellma rockafella twice  
Niggas tell you all the rumors dey heard  
And we laugh  
Soon as you come and tell me  
Lik Im ellen brice  
Ma groove theorie  
Is that when yu to cheery  
They try to bring you down  
To the level they at  
Well when they are all unhappy  
And it gets a little sticky  
Thats why I am little nikki  
To these devils in rap  
But uh  
They aint thinkin drake is smart girl  
They probley think I brake ya  
Heart gurl  
I cant lie  
You probley right about it  
And if you give me dat ass quick  
I probley write about it  
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound  
I mean I spit that influencial shit  
From my town  
I dont know why you sittin on the couch  
When you see I got a bed  
Bring your ass here and lie dwn  
You kan take your purse off  
And later on we takin shirts off  
And then your skirt off  
At least I got status because I could have been a local MC and you probley
would be worst off  
So ima take dis hat off  
And ima hit it till Im back soft  
And den I back soft  
Cus you thinkin you could prevent what happen  
  
You the reason I think Im gettin sick of rappin  
  
Chorus  
We know what you thinkin love  
You think we out smokin  
Nd drinkin love  
Pushing beard whips  
Chains clinkin love  
Well you dont really kno me  
Lik you think you kno me  
And we kno how you speculate  
Thinkin we gone hit your friend  
If you object a date  
Claim we early but be showin up extra late love  
But you dont really kno me like you think you kno me  
  
Tay  
You probley think I walk around wit ma gun tucked in  
Swing dick to dis hoes lik nun chucks well  
You can think what you want but  
I think you been watchin to much BET uncut  
You need ta get real  
And check out ma real life  
I aint a tip drill  
Dnt kare wat it smell lik  
But if you feel lik  
Puttin all your noshins aside  
And talkin to a real nigga  
I gladly ablige  
First name fontay  
Id b pleased ta date you  
College educated  
Got degrees and paper  
But Im from the south were if you aint snappin or rappin bout trappin  
Yous a freak of nature  
Such a animalie  
Speak so well  
And talk so collegie  
Such a astonishing contrast  
To all the bullshit youve been following  
On ma behalf of dem I offer ma apology  
Maybe wit me youll unlearn  
Puttin all niggas in a box of concerns  
Me cus I aint them  
Shit Im well read like sun burn  
And afta me youll neva leave  
No stone unturned  
  
Chorus  
We know what you thinkin love  
You think we out smokin  
Nd drinkin love  
Pushing beard whips  
Chains clinkin love  
Well you dont really kno me  
Lik you think you kno me  
And we kno how you speculate  
Thinkin we gone hit your friend  
If you object a date  
Claim we early but be showin up extra late love  
But you dont really kno me like you think you kno me
