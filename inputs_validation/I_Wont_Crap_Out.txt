Im standin in a shadow hating the world  
I keep a wall around me block out the herd  
Its a nervewreck placeto be it kills real  
Quick  
You gotta scrape the concrete off your dick  
But were gonna live so happily  
In a faraway place just you and me  
If I dont crap out  
The sun will shine and give us a hug  
The world will sing like a happy bug  
If I dont crap out  
No and I wont crap out  
I wont crap out  
  
Im glad I am crazy it keeps me trying  
I despise the trendies I know  
Theyre lying  
  
If you want to stir up real mud  
You had better pay with real blood  
But the birds will sing a sweet melody  
In a couple of green indifferent trees  
If I dont crap out  
  
And youre gonna know how fine you are  
Gonna write your name on a violet star  
If I dont crap out  
  
Well have a window and well have a door  
And a reason to be living for  
If I dont crap out  
  
And the material singers will fade into dust  
Like forgotten merchants of disgust  
If I dont crap out  
No I wont crap out  
No Ill never crap out  
Oh I wont crap out  
I wont crap out
