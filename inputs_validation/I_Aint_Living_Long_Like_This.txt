Rodney Crowell  
You looked for trouble and you found it son  
Straight down the barrel of a lawmans gun  
Youd try to run but you dont think you can  
You make one move and youre dead man friend  
I aint living long like this  
I cant live at all like this can I baby  
He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back  
Then he left me freezing on a steel rail track  
They got em all in the jailhouse aint they bay  
I aint living long like this  
Grew up in Houston off of Wayside drive  
Son of a charhop in some all night dive  
Dad drove a stock car to an early death  
All I remember was a drunk mans death  
I aint living long like this  
I cant live at all like this can I baby  
We know the story how the wheel goes round  
Dont let em take you to the man downtown  
Cant sleep at all in the jailhouse baby  
I aint living long like this  
You live for angel shes a roadhouse queen  
Make Texas ruby look like Sandra Dee  
You want to love her but you dont know how  
Youre at the bottom of the jailhouse now  
I aint living long like this  
I cant live at all like this can I baby  
You know the story bout the jailhouse rock  
Go on and do it but just dont get caught  
They got em all in the jailhouse aint they baby  
I aint living long like this
