Its really been a long time  
Since I let somebody hold me  
Since I felt safe in somebodys arms em em  
You were a good friend I could confide in  
But after all the lies he told me  
I couldnt let nobody in my heart  
I was torn apart  
All this time youve been right here  
Hes been doing nothing but wrong  
And though the best thing in my life was  
Here with me all along  
  
Chorus  
  
I never knew  
Right beside me there was an angel  
I never knew  
Youd give my heart the wings to fly  
Because of you  
Everything in my life is changing  
Turning it to  
The kind of heaven that I never Knew  
  
He kissed away my tears  
And now theyve disappeared  
You make me feel safe in somebodys arms  
Youre the kind that can do me no harm  
These questions everybody asks me  
They say theyve never seen me so happy  
But thats a secret between you and me  
They dont know nothing about us baby  
Cant let up  
Cant tell anybody that youre not from around here  
They dont know that youre an angel  
But now its all so clear  
  
I never knew  
Right beside me there was an angel  
I never knew  
Youd give my heart the wings to fly  
Because of you  
Everything in my life is changing  
Turning it to  
The kind of heaven that I never Knew  
  
Is this a dream  
Are you for real  
You got me honey  
Feeling things that I never thought Id feel  
You taught me love  
Dont have to break my heart in two  
Thats just one more of those things  
That I never never knew  
  
I never knew  
Right beside me  
There was an angel  
I never never knew that my heart could fly  
Its all because of you baby  
My life is changing  
Turning it to  
The kind of heaven that I never knew
