You with the sad eyes  
Dont be discouraged  
Oh I realize  
Its hard to take courage  
In a world full of people  
You can lose sight of it all and the darkness  
Inside you makes you feel so small  
  
But I see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And thats why I love you  
So dont be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors  
True colors are beautiful  
Like a rainbow  
  
Show me a smile then  
Dont be unhappy cant remember when  
I last saw you laughing  
If this world makes you crazy  
And youve taken all you can bear  
Just call me up  
Because you know Ill be there  
  
And Ill see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And thats why I love you  
So dont be afraid to let them show  
Just show your true colors  
True colors are beautiful  
Like a rainbow  
  
Such sad eyes  
Discouraged now  
Realize  
  
When this world makes you crazy  
And youve taken all you can bear  
Just call me up  
Because you know Ill be there  
  
And Ill see your true colors  
Shining through
