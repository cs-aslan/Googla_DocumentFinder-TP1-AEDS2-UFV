I would lock you up  
But I could not bear to hear you  
Screaming to be set free  
I would chain you up  
If Id thought youd swear  
The only one that mattered was me me me  
I would strap you up  
But dont worry baby  
You know I wouldnt hurt you less you wanted me to  
  
Its too late to stop  
Wont the heavens save me  
My daddy said the devil looks a lot like you  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
Tell me that my souls forgiven  
Hide you babys eyes and we can  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
When the passion dies   
Its just a matter of time before my heart is  
Looking for a home  
  
Im like a maniac at the end of the day  
Im like a doggie barking at your door  
So come take me back to the place you stay  
And maybe we can do it once more  
  
You say Im dangerous  
But dont worry baby  
I get excited at the things that you do  
And theres a place for us in a dirty movie  
Cause noone does it better than me and you  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
Tell me that my souls forgiven  
Hide your babys eyes and we can  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
Please dont tell me lies  
Its just a matter of time before my heart is  
Looking for a home  
  
I aint got no more worries  
Im gonna spend some times with you  
Loving you takes such courage  
And dont you think that I know it  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
You tell me that my souls forgiven  
Hide your babys eyes and we can  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
Dont you tell me lies because believe me baby  
One day youll wake up on your own  
  
I aint got no more worries  
I aint got no more time for you  
Loving you takes such courage  
Everyones got their eyes on you  
I aint got no more worries  
I aint got no more time for you  
Loving you takes such courage  
And dont you think that I know it
