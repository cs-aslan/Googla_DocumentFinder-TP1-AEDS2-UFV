Remember when I dove  
Into the crowd  
And I got a bloody knee  
Under my skin  
A mark from wiping out  
It brings back the memories  
Every bones been broken  
And my heart is still wide open  
  
Chorus  
I cant stop  
Dont care if I lose  
Baby you are the weapon I choose  
These wounds are self inflicted  
Im going down in flames for you  
Baby you are the weapon I choose  
These wounds are self inflicted  
One more thing Im addicted too  
  
With each scar theres a map  
That tells a story  
What a souvenir of Young  
Loves like jumping out  
An airplane riding a tidal  
Wave on an ocean of emotion  
My heart rips me wide open  
  
Chorus  
  
And I cover up these scars  
Well make it well make it  
But we break it  
And I cant stop seeing stars  
Lets hope not die  
Whenever youre around  
Around  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant stop no I cant stop  
No I cant stop  
Oh Im going out in flames  
Oh Im going down in flames  
Oh  
Baby you are the weapon I choose  
Baby you are the weapon I choose
