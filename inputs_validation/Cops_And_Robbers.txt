As I was driving home along the boulevard late one night  
I saw a guy in the corner bumming all alone  
As I passed him by I heard him holler out Hey  
I slowed down to see what he said he said  
  
Eh By any chance are you goin my way  
I said sure baby hop on in and give me a cigarette  
Then he reached out in his pocket  
And that was the moment I regret  
  
Well now boy Reach for the sky  
Because I dont understand sir  
Dont you try no monkey business I got a stopper in my hand  
  
An then he said You see this rock I got in my hand  
This is a 38 pistol built on a 45 frame  
It shoots tombstone bullets an a ball and chain  
He said I aint tryin to shake you up but I just want you to know  
  
If the cops start to crowding me in  
Youre gonna be the first to go  
You just drive on just like there aint nothin happenin  
Thats what he told me he wouldnt even let me look back at nothin  
  
And he said when you get to that red light  
I want you to jump back your left and then switch back your right  
He said Now I want you to park up in that alley  
Ah ah not that alley that one over there  
  
And cool it behind that liquor store  
And keep a sharp lookout at all times  
While I sneak in that back door  
Thats what he told me  
  
He saidkeep your foot on the gas  
And always be on guard  
Cause when I come runnin out the liquor store with all that money  
He wanted me to mash on it real hard  
  
He said Now dont you come out of there an try me a doublecrossed  
Because its murder when the heats on  
  
Well now boy Reach for the sky  
Yeah but I dont understand sir  
Dont you try no monkey business I got a stopper in my hand  
  
Oohh while I was sittin there just tremblin  
A spotlight hit me dead in the face  
An a cop pulled up behind me and said  
Move up a bit man for we want to take your place  
  
An then this guy come runnin out of the store with the money in his hand  
And said Oh there you are  
He made a mistake in the dark and ran and leaped in the police car  
When they put the handcuffs on him  
  
I said Child your crime must have outgrew him  
An then they said Yeh we gonna put him so far back in jail this time  
  
That theyre gonna have to pump air into him  
Well now boy reach for the sky  
Yeah but I said I dont understand sir  
Dont you try no monkey business I got a stopper in my hand
