Now if you want something to play with go out and find yourself a toy  
Cause little boy my time is too expensive and Im not a little boy  
So if you are serious dont play with my heart it makes me furious  
But if you want me to love you you know I will you know I will  
  
Tell it like it is  
  
Dont be ashamed let your conscience be your guide  
I know deep down inside of me I believe you love me  
So forget your foolish pride life is too short for sorrow  
You may be here today and gone tomorrow  
You might as well get what you want  
So go on and please  
  
Tell it like it is  
Im nothing to play with go and find yourself a toy  
Tell it like it is  
Tell it like it is
