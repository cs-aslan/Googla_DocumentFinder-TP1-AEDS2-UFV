You you are my reason to live  
You make me shine with all the love that you give  
And when I think of you I keep driftin away  
Little by little I love you more ever day  
I lay in bed but I just cant sleep  
I close my eyes and youre all that I see  
I cant believe that its happening to me  
  
Living in a fantasy  
Ever since you came to me  
Living in a fantasy  
Drowning in this luxury  
Ever since you came to me  
Im living in a dream  
  
Oh I know therell be storms up ahead  
Well blow them away bring back the sun again  
For love conquers all the gloom and despair  
Nothin can go wrong just as long as youre there  
I see a light on the path up ahead  
I know youll wait on the cliff where you said  
Ill hold you close till were right on the edge  
  
Living in a fantasy  
Oh youre too much too soon too strong  
But I want to drown in your touch  
Dont keep me floating too long
