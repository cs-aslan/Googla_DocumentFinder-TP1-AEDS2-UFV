Why dont you come over  
Its lonely at the wooden lodge  
Why dont you come and see our baby  
You havent seen her for so long  
  
Come on baby shift that log  
Come on baby wash that dog  
Give me all the love youve got to me  
Come on baby shift that log  
Come on baby wash that dog  
Give me all the love youve got to me  
  
There in the back woods  
We had our little piece of land  
But everything wasnt so groovy  
Not when you had to dirty your hands  
  
Come on baby shift that log  
Come on baby wash that dog  
Give me all the love youve got to me  
Come on baby shift that log  
Come on baby wash that dog  
Give me all the love youve got to me  
  
Its lonely at the wooden lodge  
So why dont you share my bed  
  
Come on baby shift that log  
Come on baby wash that dog  
Give me all the love youve got to me  
Come on baby shift that log  
Come on baby wash that dog  
Give me all the love youve got to me
