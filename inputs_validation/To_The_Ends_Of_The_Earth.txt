To the ends of the Earth  
Ill follow my star  
To the ends of the Earth  
Just to be where you are  
  
No matter where you roam  
Ill never be far behind  
Who cares  
Where the path may wind  
As long as I find you  
  
Though the melody dies  
The song lingers on  
And a thousand goodbyes  
Wont convince me  
Youre gone  
  
Ill follow you my love  
Youll never be free  
To the ends of the Earth  
Till youve given  
Your love to me  
  
No matter where you roam  
Ill never be far behind  
Who cares  
Where the path may wind  
As long as I find you  
  
Though the melody dies  
The song lingers on  
And a thousand goodbyes  
Wont convince me  
Youre gone  
  
Ill follow you my love  
Youll never be free  
To the ends of the Earth  
Till youve given  
Your love to me
