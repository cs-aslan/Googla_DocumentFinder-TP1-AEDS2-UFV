One last kiss one only  
Then Ill let you go  
Hard for you Ive fallen  
But you cant break my fall  
Im broken dont break me  
When I hit the ground  
  
Some devil some angel  
Has got me to the bones  
You said always and forever  
Now I believe you baby  
You said always and forever  
Is such a long and lonely time  
  
Too drunk and still drinking  
Its just the way I feel  
Its alright  
Is what you told me  
Cause what we had was so beautiful  
Feel heavy like floating  
At the bottom of the sea  
  
You said always and forever  
Now I believe you baby  
You said always and forever  
Is such a long and lonely time  
  
Some devil is stuck inside of me  
Why cant I set it free  
I wish I wish I was dead and you were breathing  
Just so that you could know  
Some angel is stuck inside of me  
But can I set you free  
  
You said always and forever  
Now I believe you baby  
You said always and forever  
Such a long and lonely time  
  
Stuck inside of me
