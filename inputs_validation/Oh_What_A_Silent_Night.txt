The night before Christmas alone in the dark  
Not a creature is stirring except for my heart  
This old house without you just dont feel right  
Oh what a silent night  
Then in the twinklin of my eye  
A teardrop comes fallin as I realize  
Im all alone and youre by his side  
Oh what a silent night  
Your stockin are hangin across our old bed  
As visions of yesterdays dance in my head  
The fire burns hotter but Im cold as ice  
Oh what a silent night  
Then in the twinklin of my eye  
A teardrop comes fallin as I realize  
Im all alone and youre by his side  
Oh what a silent night  
Oh what a silent night
