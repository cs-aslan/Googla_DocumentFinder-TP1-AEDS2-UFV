Walk out Amanda our fortunes are clear  
These are the last of our days  
Left San Francisco with time on my hands  
And I got back with you on my brain  
So bring me a second or bring me an hour  
Bring me the world in a tear  
Bring me a little of anything Amanda  
And Ill keep it close to me here  
Press it among the best years of my heart and my tears  
And I want and I want and I want and I want  
Throw me up on the shore tonight and Ill count the last light  
And I want and I want and I want and I want  
Come on Amanda you know what I mean  
You wont be happy round here  
Got on the wagon the tenth of December  
I fell off the first of the year  
And I know you wish I was better then that  
I know you wish I was dry  
God knows I wish I was somebody else  
Right now I wish I could die  
Press it among the best years of my heart and my tears  
And I want and I want and I want and I want  
Maybe among the earphones of my heart and my soul  
And I want and I want and I want and I want everything  
And I want to be a raider I want anything  
And I want to be a man  
Whats the matter  
Didnt you think we were trying  
Hey whats the matter  
Didnt you think I was somebody else who  
Could lie in the wake of you smile  
Spent twentysix stiffening years down the drain  
Women who will spit in your eye  
And a drunkard like me gets the worst of your love  
Good riddance good luck and good bye  
Press it among the best years of my heart and my tears  
And I want and I want and I want and I want  
Maybe among the hill folds of my heart and my soul  
And I want and I want and I want and I want  
Singing till the sky turns and lungs burst and throat burns  
And I want and I want and I want and I want  
Screaming till the sun houses my here and my now  
And I want and I want and I want and I want everything  
And I want to be a sailor I want anything  
And I wanna be a man  
I want everything  
And I wanna be a sailor I want anything  
And I wanna be a man  
And I wanna be a man  
And I wanna be a man
