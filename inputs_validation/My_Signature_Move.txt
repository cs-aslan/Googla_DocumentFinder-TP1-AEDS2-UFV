Ive got a way of making everything a confrontation  
And youve got a way of bringing out the worst in me  
You see its just if Im bored  
Ill find a way to make an accusation  
Ive got a problem with more  
So give me give me everything  
  
STOP  
  
Not my fault not at all  
I cant help you what you want  
Get in line take a number  
Get you when my song is over  
If you leave it up to me Ill make a lie out of truth  
Its true  
And then Ill break it up make it bleed  
Tell you that its you not me  
Make a scene at a show just because the wind blows  
Shoot myself in the foot to make a point I cant prove  
To get it back to you  
Thats just my signature move  
  
You call me crazy and I think its mean I just dont like it  
Im just a sensitive baby and you need to please me right  
You know I said I would change  
I did I went and tried a different outfit  
And if thats not enough  
You wont be riding dirty tonight  
  
STOP  
  
Not my fault not at all

Get you when my song is over  
If you leave it up to me Ill make a lie out of truth
