I never told you the truth  
Holding your hand at the end of the rainbow  
Left you with nothing to lose  
I cant cry anymore  
I cant cry anymore  
I used to be bulletproof  
I used to wear my hat like a halo  
Theres too many holes in my roof  
I cant cry anymore  
I cant cry anymore  
  
Shes got the rain  
Shes got the rain  
And when shes not around  
The sunshine brings me down  
  
I used to be so aloof  
Whirling around like an angry tornado  
Faced with the burden of proof  
I cant lie anymore  
I cant lie anymore  
  
Shes got the rain  
Shes got the rain  
And when shes not around  
The sunshine brings me down  
  
She sits alone in her room  
She wont let me in and I worry about her  
I hope that shes coming out soon  
I cant cry anymore  
I cant cry anymore  
  
Shes got the rain  
Shes got the rain  
And when shes not around  
The sunshine the sunshine brings me down
