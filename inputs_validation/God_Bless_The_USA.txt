If tomorrow all the things were gone  
Id worked for all my life  
And I had to start again  
With just my children and my wife  
  
Id thank my lucky stars  
To be livin here today  
Cause the flag still stands for freedom  
And they cant take that away  
  
And Im proud to be an American  
Where at least I know Im free  
And I wont forget the men who died  
Who gave that right to me  
  
And I gladly stand up  
Next to you and defend her still today  
Cause there aint no doubt I love this land  
God bless the usa  
  
From the lakes of Minnesota  
To the hills of Tennessee  
Across the plains of Texas  
From sea to shining sea  
  
From Detroit down to Houston  
And New York to L A  
Well theres pride in every American heart  
And its time we stand and say  
  
That Im proud to be an American  
Where at least I know Im free  
And I wont forget the men who died  
Who gave that right to me  
  
And I gladly stand up  
Next to you and defend her still today  
Cause there aint no doubt I love this land  
God bless the usa  
  
And Im proud to be and American  
Where at least I know Im free  
And I wont forget the men who died  
Who gave that right to me  
  
And I gladly stand up  
Next to you and defend her still today  
Cause there aint no doubt I love this land  
God bless the usa
