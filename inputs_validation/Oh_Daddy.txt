Oh daddy  
  
Oh daddy  
You know you make me cry  
How can you love me  
I dont understand why  
Oh daddy  
If I could make you see  
If theres been a fool around  
Its got to be me  
Yes its got to be me  
  
Oh daddy  
You soothe me with your smile  
Youre letting me know  
Youre the best thing in my life  
  
Oh daddy  
If I could make you see  
If theres been a fool around  
Its got to be me  
Yes its got to be me  
Why are you right when Im so wrong  
Im so weak but youre so strong  
Everything you do is just alright  
And I cant walk away from you  
Baby if I tried  
  
Oh daddy  
You soothe me with your smile  
Youre letting me know  
Youre the best thing in my life  
  
Oh daddy  
If I could make you see  
If theres been a fool around  
Its got to be me  
Yes its got to be me
