I pray youll be my eyes  
And watch him where she goes  
And help him to be wise  
Help me to let go  
Every mothers prayer  
Every child knows  
Lead him to a place  
Guide him with your grace  
To a place where hell be safe  
I pray he finds your light  
And holds it in his heart  
  
As darkness falls each night  
Remind him where you are  
Every mothers prayer  
Every child knows  
Need to find a place  
Guide him to a place  
Give him faith so shell be safe  
Lead him to a place  
Guide him with your grace  
To a place where hell be safe
