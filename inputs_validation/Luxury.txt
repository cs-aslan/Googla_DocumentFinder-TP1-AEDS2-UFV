I want a real fine car fly Miami too  
All the rum I want to drink it all the whiskey too  
My woman need a new dress my daughter got to go to school  
Im working so hard Im working for the company  
Im working so hard to keep you in the luxury  
  
You cant call me lazy on a seven day a week  
Make a million for the Texans twenty dollar me  
Yes I want a gold ring riding in a limousine  
Im working so hard Im working for the company  
Im working so hard to keep you in the luxury  
  
Now listen Im a proud man not a beggar walking on the street  
Im working so hard to keep you from the poverty  
Im working so hard to keep you in the luxury oh yeah

Harder harder working working working  
  
I think its such a strange thing giving me concern  
Half the world it got nothing the other half got money to burn
