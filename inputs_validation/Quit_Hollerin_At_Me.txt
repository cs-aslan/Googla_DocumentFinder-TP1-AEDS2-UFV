I dont want your big French Fry  
I dont want your car  
I dont want to buy no soap  
From no washedup movie star  
You are so much louder  
Than the show I want to hear  
With your sugarless gum  
Gee but Im dumb  
Nonalcoholic beer  
Its enough to make a grown man  
Blow up his own TV  
Quit hollerin at me  
Quit hollerin at me  
I heard you the first time  
I heard myself say  
Seems like the little woman  
Is getting bigger every day  
You dont have to tell the neighbors  
A little silence aint no sin  
They already think my name is  
Where in the hell you been  
Louder louder louder louder louder  
Constantly  
Quit hollerin at me  
Quit hollerin at me  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
Sweet Serenity  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
Quit hollerin at me  
Quit hollerin at me  
Aint it great at the end of the day  
When there aint no sound around  
Just me and the fence post  
Staring each other down  
Nothing but a big bunch of nothing  
Driving me insane  
Cause there aint no voice thats louder  
Than the one inside my brain  
Hey you go on  
Go on and let me be  
Quit hollerin at me  
Quit hollerin at me  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
Sweet Serenity  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
Quit hollerin at me  
Quit hollerin at me  
Quit hollerin at me  
Quit hollerin at me  
Quit hollerin at me
