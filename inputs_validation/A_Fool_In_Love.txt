Theres something on my mind  
Wont somebody please please tell me whats wrong  
  
Youre just a fool you know youre in love  
Youve got to face it to live in this world  
You take the good along with the bad  
Sometimes youre happy and sometimes youre sad  
You know you love him you cant understand  
Why he treats you like he do when hes such a good man  
  
Hes got me smiling when I should be ashamed  
Got me laughing when my heart is in pain  
Oh no I must be a fool  
Cause I do anything you ask me to  
  
Without my man I dont want to live  
You think Im lying but Im telling you like it is  
Hes got my nose open and thats no lie  
And I Im gonna keep him satisfied  
  
A wave of action speaks louder than words  
The truest thing that I ever heard  
I trust my man and all that he do  
And I and I do anything you ask me to
