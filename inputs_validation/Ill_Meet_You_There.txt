If we could sit together a moment  
And talk forever just to pass the time  
I would smile as the shivers and chills  
Run down my spine  
And your eyes are locked on mine  
Oh well fill the metro skies with country air  
And when you close your tired eyes  
Ill meet you there  
  
Ill meet you there  
Ill meet you there  
Ill meet you there  
Ill meet you there  
Ill meet you there  
Ill meet you there  
Ill meet you there  
  
Deep inside of you  
Theres a ruby glow  
And it gets brighter  
Than you and I will ever know  
Theres a rushing sound  
That surrounds us  
When we walk alone  
And its everything weve never known  
  
Wonder down the street and I will be the pavement beneath your feet  
  
If we could just be immobile for some time  
And finally figure out the way we feel  
About the missing puzzle pieces and cloudy question marks  
That still look a bit surreal  
Oh I tend to disappear  
Here and there  
So concentrate and youll feel me  
Everywhere  
And well fill the metro skies with country air  
If youre lost when you close your eyes  
Ill meet you there  
  
Ill meet you there  
Ill meet you there  
Ill meet you there  
You could be anywhere  
Ill meet you there  
Ill meet you there  
You could be anywhere  
Ill meet you there  
Ill meet you there  
Open your eyes and see  
You could be anywhere  
Everything you can be  
Ill meet you there  
Open your eyes and see  
You could be anywhere  
Everything you can be  
Ill meet you there
