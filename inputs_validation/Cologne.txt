Verse 1  
Theres a reason youre everywhere  
Breathe you in like youre in the air  
Maybe you should call off the day  
Give your girl some time to play  
In my room from the ceiling to the floor  
My body knows that youve been here before  
  
Chorus  
Every second here without you I pretend were skin to skin  
Every single breath reminds me that you never ever left  
Every time I think about you I can feel my hand give in  
Cause youre keeping me safe and warm  
Even when Im home alone  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
  
Verse 2  
Maybe you should call off the day  
Give your girl some time to play  
Running my mind cause my heart lost all control  
Only one thing that can give me that multiple  
  
Chorus  
Every second here without you I pretend were skin to skin  
Every single breath reminds me that you never ever left  
Every time I think about you I can feel my hand give in  
Cause youre keeping me safe and warm  
Even when Im home alone  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
  
Bridge  
All the way down  
Feels like youre around  
Forever in the moment  
I love it and you know it  
All the way down  
Feels like youre around  
Forever in the moment  
I love it and you know it  
  
Chorus  
Every second here without you I pretend were skin to skin  
Every single breath reminds me that you never ever left  
Every time I think about you I can feel my hand give in  
Cause youre keeping me safe and warm  
Even when Im home alone  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne  
Wearing nothing but your cologne
