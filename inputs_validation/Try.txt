Verse 1  
Ever wonder about what hes doing  
How it all turned to lies  
Sometimes I think that its better  
To never ask why  
  
Chorus  
Where there is desire there is gonna be a flame  
Where there is a flame someones bound to get burned  
But just because it burns doesnt mean youre gonna die  
Youve gotta get up and try try try  
Gotta get up and try try try  
You gotta get up and try try try  
  
Eh eh eh  
  
Verse 2  
Funny how the heart can be deceiving  
More than just a couple times  
Why do we fall in love so easy  
Even when its not right  
  
Chorus  
Where there is desire there is gonna be a flame  
Where there is a flame someones bound to get burned  
But just because it burns doesnt mean youre gonna die  
Youve gotta get up and try try try  
Gotta get up and try try try  
You gotta get up and try try try  
  
Bridge  
Ever worried that it might be ruined  
And does it make you wanna cry  
When youre out there doing what youre doing  
Are you just getting by  
Tell me are you just getting by by by  
  
Chorus  
Where there is desire there is gonna be a flame  
Where there is a flame someones bound to get burned  
But just because it burns doesnt mean youre gonna die  
Youve gotta get up and try try try  
Gotta get up and try try try  
You gotta get up and try try try  
  
Gotta get up and try try try  
Gotta get up and try try try  
You gotta get up and try try try  
Gotta get up and try try try  
  
Outro  
You gotta get up and try try try  
Gotta get up and try try try
