Im Alabamy bound  
Theyll be no heebiejeebies hangin round  
Just gave the meanest ticket man on earth  
All Im worth to put my tootsies in an upper berth  
  
Just hear the choochoo sound  
I know that soon were gonna cover ground  
And then Ill holler so the world will know  
Here I go Im Alabamy bound  
  
Im Alabamy bound  
Theyll be no heebiejeebies hanging round  
Just gave the meanest ticket man on earth  
All Im worth to put my tootsies in an upper berth  
  
Just hear the choochoo sound  
I know that soon were gonna cover the ground  
And then Ill holler so the world will know here I go  
Im Alabamy Im Alabamy bound Im gone
