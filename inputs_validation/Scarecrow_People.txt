Hope you enjoyed your flight  
In one of our new straw aeroplanes  
Youll find things here are just like what youre used to  
Theres lots of waste and razor wire  
And no one gives a damn about the land  
We just stand around and stare like you folks do  
  
For we aint got no brains  
And we aint got no hearts  
Its just that wild old wind that tears us all apart  
Were the scarecrow people  
Have we got lots in common with you  
And if you dont start living well  
Youre all gonna wind up scarecrow people too  
  
Hope you enjoyed your meal  
Its only gas and chemicals  
We thought that youd prefer something not nature made  
Now while youre here can you advise us  
On a war wed like to start  
Against some scarecrows over there a different shade  
  
For we aint got no brains  
And we aint got no hearts  
Its just that wild old wind that tears us all apart  
Were the scarecrow people  
Have we got lots in common with you  
And if you dont start living well  
Youre all gonna wind up scarecrow people too  
  
We dont have no tears here  
No one hopes or cares or fears here  
For the old the sick the poor and them what taint you  
We thought wed base our civilization upon yours  
Cause youre the smartest animals on earth now aint you  
  
We dont have no love here  
Theres no need to rise above here  
No one wants to write a book or try to paint thee  
We thought wed base our civilization upon yours  
Cause were all dead from our necks up now aint we  
  
And we aint got no brains  
And we aint got no hearts  
Its just that wild old wind that tears us all apart  
Were the scarecrow people  
Have we got lots in common with you  
And if you dont start living well  
Youre all gonna wind up scarecrow people too  
  
And I aint got no brains  
And I aint got no heart  
Its just them other humans tear my soul apart  
Im a scarecrow person  
Have I got quite some message for you  
For if we dont start learning well  
were all gonna wind up scarecrow people too
