No I dont guess  
I dont sacrifice  
And I know  
I dont realize  
Just how much  
I can idolizeand I know and I know  
And then I find it falls back on  
On to me to see believe  
And down onto you We do its true  
And I wont beg to stay to leave or to believe  
A word you say and then I guess  
It all falls back on you  
To find out find out  
Whats the deal  
And I guess you dont  
Simplify  
Its just you had to  
Had to take and I know and I know  
And then I guess it all falls back on you  
  
Theres a fine line between right and wrong  
And I know we knew all along  
Just how much I can half belongand I know and I know  
And then I find it all falls back on  
On to me to see believe  
And down onto you we do its true  
And I wont beg to stay to leave or to believe  
A word you say and then I guess  
It all falls back on you  
To find out find out  
Whats the deal  
And I guess you dont  
Simplify  
Its just you had to  
Had to take and I know and I know  
And then I find it all falls back on you  
  
Cause Im really up on this  
Cause Im really up on this  
Time to see these people  
Where the hell do I get through to you  
No I dont guess  
I dont sacrifice  
And I know  
I dont realize  
Just how much  
I can idolizeand I know and I know  
And then I find it falls back on  
On to me to see believe  
And down onto you we do its true  
And I wont beg to stay to leave or to believe  
A word you say and then I guess  
It all falls back on you  
To find out find out  
Whats the deal  
And I guess you dont  
Simplify  
Its just you try to hesitate  
And then I find it all falls back on you  
On you
