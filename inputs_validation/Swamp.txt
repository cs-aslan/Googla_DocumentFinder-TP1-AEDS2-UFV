Now lemme tell you a story  
The devil he has a plan  
A bag a bones in his pocket  
Got anything you want  
No dust and no rocks  
The whole thing is over  
All these beauties in solid motion  
All those beauties gonna swallow you up  
  
Hi hi hi hi hi  
One time too many  
Too far to go  
IWe come to take you home  
  
And when they split those atoms  
Its hotter than the sun  
Blood is a special substance  
They gonna pray for that man  
  
So wake up young lovers  
The whole thing is over  
Watch but touch monkeys  
All that blood gonna swallow you whole  
  
Hi hi hi hi hi  
Whats that Whos driving  
Where we goin Who knows  
IWe come to take you home  
  
How many people do you think I am  
Pretend I am somebody else  
You can pretend Im and old millionaire  
A millionaire washing his hands  
Rattle the bones dreams that stick out  
A medical chart on the wall  
Soft violence and hands touch your throat  
Evryone wants to explode  
  
And when your hands get dirty  
Nobody knows you at all  
Dont have a window to slip out of  
Lights on nobody home  
  
Click click see ya later  
Beta beta no time to rest  
Pika pika risky business  
All that blood will never cover that mess  
  
Hi hi hi hi hi  
So soft hard feelings  
Whats that whos driving  
No tricks lets go  
IWe come to take you home  
IWe come to take you home  
Hi hi hi hi hi  
Etc
