Mom and Dad dont look so hot these days  
Theyre getting over the hill  
Death is closing in and catching up  
As far as I can tell  
Got a plan of action and cold blood  
And it smells of defiance  
Ill just wait for Mom and Dad to die  
And got my inheritance  
Now I want more  
Cause Im getting bored  
And Im going nowhere fast  
I was once filled with doubt  
Now its all figured out  
Nothing good can last  
Crows feet and rot are setting in  
And time is running out  
My parents income interest rate  
Is gaining higher clout  
Im a snot nosed slob  
Without a job  
And I know I damn well should  
Mom and Dad dont look so hot these days  
But my futures looking good
