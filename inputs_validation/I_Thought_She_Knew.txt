Dododo Repeats  
  
She was my once in a lifetime  
Happy ending come true  
Oh I guess I should have told her  
I thought she knew  
  
Dododo  
She said I took her for granted  
Thats the last thing I would do  
Whoa Ill never understand it  
Cause I thought she knew  
I thought she knew  
My world revolved around her  
My love light burned for her alone  
But she couldnt see the flame  
Only myself to blame  
I shouldve known  
I shouldve known  
  
A heart full of words left unspoken  
Now that were through  
Id sell my soul to have this silence broken  
I thought she knew my world revolved around her  
My love light burned for her alone  
But she couldnt see the flame  
Only myself to blame  
I shouldve known  
I shouldve known  
  
She was my once in a lifetime  
Happy ending come true  
Whoa  
I guess I should of told her  
But I thought she knew  
I thought she knew  
I thought she knew  
  
I though that she knew  
Yeah
