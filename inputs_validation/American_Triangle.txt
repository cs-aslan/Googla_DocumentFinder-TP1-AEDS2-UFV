Seen him playing in his backyard  
Young boy just starting out  
So much history in this landscape  
So much confusion so much doubt  
  
Been there drinking on that front porch  
Angry kids mean and dumb  
Looks like a painting that blue skyline  
God hates fags where we come from  
  
Western skies dont make it right  
Home of the brave dont make no sense  
Ive seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire  
Left to die on a high ridge fence  
  
Its a cold cold wind  
Its a cold cold wind  
Its a cold wind blowing Wyoming  
  
See two coyotes run down a deer  
Hate what we dont understand  
You pioneers give us your children  
But its your blood that stains their hands  
  
Somewhere that road forks up ahead  
To ignorance and innocence  
Three lives drift on different winds  
Two lives ruined one life spent
