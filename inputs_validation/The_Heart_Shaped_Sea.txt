Babe its time to tell me that its over tell me that its over its plain
to see And this time we wont be starting over no crying on your shoulder
into the heart shaped sea Oh youve been arunning from our door and youve
been enchanted by the gracious voice of love  
  
Babe its time to look me in the eyes time to say goodbye its clear to me
And this time I wont let you down you can turn around Ill set you free Oh
youve been asailing from our shore and youve been enchanted by someone from
afar  
  
Babe its time to gather all the harvest to pray before the winter and sail
the heart shaped sea Oh youve been arunning from my love and youve been
enchanted by the powers up above
