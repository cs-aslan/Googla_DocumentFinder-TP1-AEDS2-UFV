You love me more than those dirty clothes  
Cause you cant imagine me as someone old  
But in the moment of sinless embrace  
Your eyes stare right through me to the back of my face  
  
I sleep all day  
I sleep all day  
Youre the price I paid  
Youre the price I paid  
  
Were always good on the road  
Now you you were my favorite show  
As long as buses were rollin on  
The destinations unknown  
  
Talks of club connection was the way it began  
Not necessary dope but it was straight obsession  
Couldnt sleep it out but oh hell who needs sleep  
Now youre six months later it was well you know  
  
I sleep all day  
I sleep all day  
Youre the price I paid  
Youre the price I paid  
  
Were always good on the road  
Now you you were my favorite show  
As long as buses were rollin on  
The destinations unknown  
  
I sleep all day  
I sleep all day  
Youre the price I paid  
Youre the price I paid  
  
Were always good on the road  
Now you you were my favorite show  
As long as buses were rollin on  
The destinations unknown  
  
Were always good on the road  
Now you you were my favorite show  
As long as buses were rollin on  
The destinations unknown
