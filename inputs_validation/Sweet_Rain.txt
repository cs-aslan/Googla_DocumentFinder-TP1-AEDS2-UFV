Well I remember when every other day was bad  
You were my brother so tall was all you had  
Cerano was dead but we had you instead  
Now I remember our precious petting zoo  
  
Our delicate high school  
And all the things we said wed do they all fall like  
Sweet Rain wet my memory  
Sweet Rain come on down on me  
It wasnt hard to look ahead  
You wanted to be me instead  
I wanted to be you instead  
But I fell and you fell back  
  
What is wrong with me  
Well what is wrong with you Jack  
Everybody knew she was coming  
Everybody knew that she was just too much for you  
Sweet Rain wet my memory  
Sweet Rain come on down on me  
The big screen got in between  
What it was and what weve seen  
  
How have you been  
What have you been  
I think about you now and again  
I think about you every single day  
Shit Im thinking about you right now  
And I know everybody here wants you  
I know everybody here thinks they need  
Ive been waiting here just to touch you  
Ooh ooh yeah yeah  
Sweet Rain
