Shes a dancing girl who brings up the heat  
Hits on all the men  
She knows how to move and make you feel  
Like you want to get into sin  
A chocolate bar was going really far  
Really made me catch my breath  
So she had an unordinary glance  
I got down tools in the chest  
Down and dirty  
Youre down and dirty alright  
Shes down and dirty  
Youre down and dirty  
She twisted her ass around drinks  
While the dirty works the girls booty  
Whispered in my ear what I want to hear  
Says Come with me baby lets play Okay  
She went to the back to get her traps  
My sixth sense was bothering me  
She came to work and something I heard  
Makes me want to get comfy  
Down and dirty  
Shes down and dirty alright  
Get down and dirty  
Get down Listen  
Down and dirty  
Woo  
Alright  
Ooh yeah  
Well theres something going on  
Something Ive never known before  
Leather and lace is all that I can see  
I lost my power of will  
You know she should be still  
Never thought Id get hit by some teen no  
I start to bleed have mercy on me  
Im feelin a bit distressed  
What youre doing to me is so obscene  
Got myself into a mess  
She started to dance I grabbed my pants  
Found my way to the door  
Hot on my trail a thousand females  
Saying Baby more more more  
Down and dirty  
Hurt me  
Down and dirty  
Well well well  
Down and dirty  
Oh yeah  
Get down and dirty  
She is  
Get down Down  
Get dirty Dirty
