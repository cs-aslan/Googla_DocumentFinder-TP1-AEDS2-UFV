Theres a light that shines on all people  
Sees them through  
It waits and watches them move  
Through their lives like people do  
Theres only so much we can be sure of  
We can see  
The rest belongs to time  
And things that are meant to be  
When the clouds surround you  
And you know youve found your rainy day  
Oh the blues are bound to make you feel  
Just like theyre here to stay  
All through your life  
Anything thats meant to be will be  
When tomorrow comes  
Once again youll see  
That theres a light that shines on all people  
Sees them through  
It waits and watches them move  
Through their lives like people do  
When the clouds surround you  
And you know youve found your rainy day  
Oh the blues are bound to make you feel  
Jut like theyre here to stay  
Oh you should know  
There aint much a broken heart can see  
When tomorrow hides  
The dream beyond this dream  
Oh theres a light that shines on all people  
Sees them through  
It waits and watches them move  
Through their lives like people do
