Verse 1  
Bite down on your lip  
Take another sip  
Stop checking your phone  
Looking for the answers  
Mind running obsessed  
Feeling paralyzed  
Let me watch you undress  
Fall into the night  
  
PreChorus  
Yeah we change and we change and we feel so lost  
And we dont know who we are  
Yeah we break and we break and we just cant stop  
So we just keep breaking hearts  
  
Chorus  
Why you wanna ruin a good thing  
Can we take it back to the start  
When loves not playing out like the movies  
It doesnt mean its falling apart  
Dont panic  
Dont panic  
  
Verse 2  
Been shattered before  
Everything breaks  
I cant really be sure  
Of our mistakes  
Come under my love  
Like an umbrella  
Going to make you feel good  
Yeah better than ever  
  
PreChorus  
Yeah we change and we change and we feel so lost  
And we dont know who we are  
Yeah we break and we break and we just cant stop  
So we just keep breaking hearts  
  
Chorus  
Why you wanna ruin a good thing  
Can we take it back to the start  
When loves not playing out like the movies  
It doesnt mean its falling apart  
Dont panic  
Dont panic  
  
Bridge  
I got big dreams baby  
I got big dreams baby  
So dont you over complicate it  
I got big dreams baby  
I got big dreams baby  
So dont you dont you over complicate it  
  
Chorus  
Why you wanna ruin a good thing  
Can we take it back to the start  
When loves not playing out like the movies  
It doesnt mean its falling apart  
Dont panic  
Dont panic  
Dont panic  
Dont panic
