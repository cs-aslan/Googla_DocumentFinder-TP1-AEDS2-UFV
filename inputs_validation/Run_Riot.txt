Living by the law is a bloody necessary bore  
Everybody are you gettin what youre lookin for  
Livin by the rule is somethin that you gotta do  
But does it matter if we break a rule or two  
  
Get up break out dont be the odd one out  
  
Livin on the edge Im a tryin to keep a level head  
Every morning its a bummer gettin out of bed  
Same old story does a nothin ever ever change  
Yeah they lock me up and then they let me out again  
  
Get up break out dont be the odd one out  
Come on its alright were hot tonight  
  
You better run run riot  
You gotta run run riot  
You know the time has come  
Run run riot I mean everyone  
Run yeah run riot  
Oh gotta run riot babe  
  
Goin through the motions desperation guaranteed  
Whoa get fffrustrated easily  
Pedal to the metal senses working overtime  
Hey gonna fight to the finish baby  
Draw the line  
  
Get up break out dont be the odd one out  
Cmon its alright were hot tonight  
Run run riot  
You gotta run run riot  
You know the time has come  
Run run riot I mean everyone  
Run yeah run riot  
Speak to me  
  
They lock me up they let me out but Im up and runnin  
I scream and shout  
  
Get up break out dont be the odd one out  
Come on its alright were hot tonight
