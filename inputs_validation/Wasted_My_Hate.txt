Good day how do  
And I send a smile to you  
Dont waste waste your breath  
And I wont waste my hate on you  
Hate yeah  
  
Aint gonna waste my hate  
Aint gonna waste my hate on you  
I think Ill keep it for myself  
  
Aint gonna give no more  
Aint got the time to help you score  
I think its time you pleased yourself yourself  
  
Good day how do  
And I send a smile to you  
Dont waste waste your breath  
And I wont waste my hate on you  
Waste my hate on you hate  
  
Think youre worthy now  
Think enough to even raise the brow  
And to laugh and tip that two pronged crown  
  
Well I see my hands I see my feet  
I feel that blood that pumps in me  
But where the hells my mind goin now Get goin now  
  
Good day how do  
And I send a smile to you  
Dont waste waste your breath  
And I wont waste my hate on you  
Waste my hate on you  
Think Ill keep it for myself hate  
  
Aint gonna waste my hate  
But Im so greedy when they say  
Better to give than to receive  
  
Aint gonna waste my hate oh no  
Aint got time to waste my hate on you  
I think Ill keep it all for myself  
For myself  
  
Good day how do  
And I send a smile to you  
Dont waste waste your breath  
And I wont waste my hate on you  
Waste my hate on you  
Think Ill keep it for myself hate
