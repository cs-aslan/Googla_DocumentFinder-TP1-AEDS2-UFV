Well its got nothing to do with anything that is real  
You just believe in it and its true  
You can sooth like an angel or sigh like a saint  
You can dream it and see it through  
You will live to see a sea of lights  
Sparking on the face of a pearl  
Climb your own peak  
Find a new streak  
  
Get yourself along to the world party party  
Now youve been building for yourself a cool place in the sand  
Youre thinking that its mighty fine  
Youve got dust in your eyeballs you got mud in your mouth  
But its your head it aint mine  
Ive got a madman of my own to contend with  
Cursing in the cave of my skull  
Turn the other cheek  
Find a new streak  
  
Get yourself along to the world party party  
Well I heard a rumour of a golden age  
Somewhere back along the line  
Maybe I dreamed it in a whisper or  
Heard it in a spell  
It was something to do with the sign of the times  
And the only thing that I remember  
Is a summer like a pretty girl  
Who shimmers and shines  
Moving in time  
Shaking to the beat of the heart of the world  
  
Party party party party party party party party party party
