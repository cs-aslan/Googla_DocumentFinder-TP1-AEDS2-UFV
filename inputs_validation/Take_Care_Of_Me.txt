Ive been working a long long time  
Now Im caught in a wicked bind  
You offered love but I threw that out  
I couldnt hear you I was too busy shouting  
  
Like a laughing hyena run out of breath  
I shot my rocks off til theres nothing left  
Its an old old story I suppose  
A heavy price for a heavy pose  
  
Take care of me  
Take care of me  
Somebody should  
Im pretty good  
  
International garbage man  
Ive decided thats what I am  
I need somebody to pull me out  
Im sinking like trazy in my sauerkraut  
  
Take care of me  
Take care of me  
Ive done my best  
Now you do the rest  
  
little boy take out your toys  
Lay them on the table  
Benwa balls and bugs that crawl  
I cant enjoy them without love  
Still Ive been known to run around  
  
Take care of me  
But beware of me  
Sometimes Im a snake  
Just aher the take  
  
Take care of me  
Take care of me  
Ive done my best  
Take care of me  
Now you do the rest  
Take care of me  
Ill never forget  
Take care of me
