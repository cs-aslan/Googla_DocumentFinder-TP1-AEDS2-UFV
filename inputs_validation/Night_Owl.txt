A catfish he tends to groove on the water  
Its just where hes bound to be  
And a monkey kinds of flashes on fruits and bananas  
So he lives in the top of a tree  
But my eyes are made for darkness  
And so the nighttime is right for me  
  
Said Im a night owl honey  
Sleep all day long  
  
Now most folks they like the good day time  
They like to see the shining sun  
Theyre up in the morning  
Off and running  
Till theyre too tired for having fun  
But when the sun goes down  
And them bright light shine  
My daytime has just begun  
  
Im a night owl honey  
Sleep all day long  
  
Said turn off that bright light baby  
Youre just about to drive me blind  
Draw them curtains for me mama  
You watch and youll see  
How my love light shines  
  
Now theres two sides to this  
Great big world  
And one of them is always night  
Hey if you can take care of  
Business in the sunshine baby  
I guess youre gonna be alright  
But dont come looking for string bean  
To lend you a hand  
Because my eyes they cant stand the light  
  
No Im a night owl honey  
Sleep all sleep all day long  
I said sleep all day long  
Im a night owl honey
