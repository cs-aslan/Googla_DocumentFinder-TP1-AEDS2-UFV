  
Before it all gets written down  
Youve got to rearrange to create your own illusion of truth  
Know that its good and its real  
Before it all gets written down  
You dont have to face the future alone  
Everybody has to deal with a tricky situation  
Know that its good and its real  
Before it all gets written down  
Love me thats all you have to do  
All night long  
Show me its all you have to be  
To make it right  
Youve got your head high up in the clouds  
Know you really got to be a down to earth person  
Know that its good and its real  
Before it all gets written down  
You dont have to face the future alone  
Everybody has to deal with a tricky situation  
Know that its good and its real  
Before it all starts getting you down  
Love me thats all you have to do  
All night long  
Show me its all you have to be  
To make it right  
Love me thats all you have to do  
All night long  
Show me its all you have to be  
To make it right  
Youve got your head high up in the clouds  
But you really got to be a down to earth person  
Know that its good and its real  
Before it all starts getting you down  
Love me thats all you have to do  
All night long  
Show me its all you have to be  
To make it right  
Love me thats all you have to do  
All night long  
Show me its all you have to be
