Well he cant be more than seventy  
Shes not a day over sixtyfive  
But theyd returned to a plane in fortythree  
And their fires still burning bright  
  
Theyll be found holdin hands at the picture show  
Lookin just like Juliet and Romeo  
The sad song wont steal the beat away  
They got a special kind of love thats here to stay  
  
See the romance on the port of sea  
Auburn hair grew a silver linin  
Theres something in their eyes  
You just dont see these days  
  
I wanna love somebody like that I wanna hold on forever  
Two hearts become one with a love like that  
I wanna love somebody like that  
I wanna love somebody yeah  
  
I was head over heels in junior high  
And it lasted a week or two  
When my heart was destroyed I cried and cried  
Til I found me somebody new  
  
Life without a real love is tragedy  
Thats why Im gonna find a love thats right for me  
Ive gotta look beyond what my eyes can see  
Until my dreams are reality  
  
Theres gotta be more to fallin in love  
Than fallin away when the stayin gets tough  
I want my love to be young  
When Im old and gray  
  
I wanna love somebody like that I wanna hold on forever  
Two hearts become one with a love like that  
I wanna love somebody like that  
I wanna love somebody yeah  
  
I wanna love somebody like that I wanna hold on forever  
Two hearts become one with a love like that  
I wanna love somebody like that  
I wanna love somebody  
I wanna love somebody like that
