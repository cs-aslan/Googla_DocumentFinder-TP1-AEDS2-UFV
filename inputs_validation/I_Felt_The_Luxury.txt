She sat on the pavement  
As I pulled in the drive  
Wearing leopard skin velvet  
And shiny black eyes  
She looks like a sleeper  
  
Said my wife at the time  
She had curls like Delilah  
And a smile like the sun  
She held my poor corpse  
Like shed never be done  
And the caption in my mind said  
This is the one  
  
But Im strong and Im disciplined  
And I avoided her for years  
Till one night as usual  
With my heart full of tears  
A hand touched my back  
  
And she was standing right there  
Then I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury  
Whispering  
Whispering  
  
Now Ill try hard to tell things just like they is  
How my life was a desert before she came in  
And wrecked it and ripped it and rubbed my nerves thin  
How I liked to see her little feet pad around the house  
The way she curled up quietly on the couch  
I can still see her in my mind that way now  
Aah I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
  
Well time went by quickly  
And her confidence grew  
And she wanted this and that  
And she wanted those too  
And she wouldnt shut up  
And one day I just blew up  
Now shes in the hospital  
For the second time  
Maybe shell die  
Maybe Ill cry  
Therapists would say  
Youre in denial  
  
But love became inconvenient  
Love became a literal drag  
Very bad for business  
Id be better off a fag  
Shes a model de sport  
That I cant afford  
Cause Im a practical American  
From the MiddleWest  
And I can piss on a grave  
While welcoming guests  
If colds what I am  
Im cold till the end  
And I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
Now Im gonna continue walking  
In the modern world  
Which justifies every egotistical perversion  
With scientific talk  
And new ways to walk  
  
But Ill remember the religion  
She became to me  
And the other person I could have been  
So for now Ill say so long  
I gotta go do wrong  
I gotta go do wrong  
I felt the luxury  
I felt the luxury  
I felt the luxury  
Aah Luxury
