Your life stepped lightly out our hands  
When no ones looking out you understand  
Your world was a wheel but the cog ceased to turn  
The bottom fell out and our fingers got burned  
  
And theres a cold cold highway that the wind whistles down  
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground  
Oh your black icy snare once cut down my friend  
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end  
  
Every new version of the way of life  
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night  
But whose kid are you when they finally decide  
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died  
  
But theyre oh so simple theyre still trying to tell  
The difference for you between heaven and hell  
To glorify something your legends are found  
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground  
  
Years rolling by just like a dream  
Im partly human and Im partly machine  
Theyve lost you and fate put your name on a stone  
Perhaps now my friend they might leave you alone
