People can take everything away from you  
But they can never take away your truth  
But the question is can you handle mine  
  
They say Im crazy  
I really dont care  
Thats my prerogative  
They say Im nasty  
But I dont give a damn  
Getting boys is how I live  
Some ask me questions  
Why am I so real  
But they dont understand me  
I really dont know the deal  
About my sister  
Trying hard to make it right  
Not long ago  
Before I won this fight  
  
Everybodys talking all this stuff about me  
Why dont they just let me live  
Tell me why  
I dont need permission make my own decisions  
Oh  
Thats my prerogative  
Thats my prerogative  
Its my prerogative  
  
Its the way that I wanna live  
Its my prerogative  
But you cant tell me what to do  
  
Dont get me wrong  
Im really not souped  
Ego trips is not my thing  
All these strange relationships  
Really gets me down  
I see nothing wrong  
Spreadin myself around  
  
Everybodys talking all this stuff about me  
Why dont they just let me live  
Tell me why  
I dont need permission make my own decisions  
Oh  
Thats my prerogative  
Thats my prerogative  
  
Everybodys talking all this stuff about me  
Why dont they just let me live  
Tell me why  
I dont need permission make my own decisions  
Oh  
Thats my prerogative  
Thats my prerogative  
  
Its the way that I wanna live  
Its my prerogative  
But you cant tell me what to do  
  
Why cant I live my life  
Without all of the things  
That people say  
Oh  
  
Oh  
Everybodys talking all this stuff about me  
Why dont they just let me live  
Tell me why  
I dont need permission make my own decisions  
Oh  
Thats my prerogative  
They said Im crazy  
  
Everybodys talking all this stuff about me  
Why dont they just let me live  
Tell me why  
They say Im nasty  
I dont need permission make my own decisions  
Oh  
Thats my prerogative  
Thats my prerogative
