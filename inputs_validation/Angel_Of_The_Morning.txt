Therell be no strings to bind your hands  
Not if my love can bind your heart  
And theres no need to take a stand  
For it was I who chose to start  
I see no reason to take me home  
Im old enough to face the dawn  
  
Just call me angel of the morning angel  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me oh baby  
Just call me angel of the morning angel  
Then slowly turn away from me  
  
Maybe the suns light will be dim  
So it wont matter anyhow  
If mornings echo says weve sinned  
Well it was what I wanted now  
And if were the victims of the night  
I wont be blinded by the light  
  
Just call me angel of the morning angel  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me oh baby  
Just call me angel of the morning angel  
Then slowly turn away  
I wont beg you to stay with me  
Through the tears of the day  
Of the years oh baby baby baby baby  
  
Just call me angel of the morning angel  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me baby  
Just call me angel of the morning angel  
Just touch my cheek before you leave me  
Oh baby baby oh baby
