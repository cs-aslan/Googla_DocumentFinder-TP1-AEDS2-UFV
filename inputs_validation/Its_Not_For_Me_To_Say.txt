Its not for me to say you love me  
Its not for me to say youll always care  
Oh but here for the moment I can hold you fast  
And press your lips to mine  
And dream that love will last  
As far as I can see this is heaven  
And speaking just for me  
Its ours to share  
Perhaps the glow of love will grow  
With every passing day  
Or we may never meet again  
But then its not for me to say  
  
And speaking just for me  
Its ours to share  
Perhaps the glow of love will grow  
With every passing day  
Or we may never meet again  
But then its not for me to say
