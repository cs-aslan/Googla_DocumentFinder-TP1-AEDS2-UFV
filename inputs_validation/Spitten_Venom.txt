First Verse  
If its on Ill kill my own like a Civil War  
This EBK what the fuck should I be civil for  
Its over pour into my bullet tips  
Split you open like a pinata cause you full of shit  
Manana nigga Ima do you nonbelievers bad  
With heavy artillery like Sigourney Weaver had  
cause you an alien or foreigner up in the town  
Either you or I do or die about to shut you down  
Bout to hunt you down like elk in the woods  
In the hood nothin else expected  
Accept it its what I protected  
No excuse nothin else respected  
Known to shoot whenever we tested  
Shit is about to get hectic Chaos  
You gone need the sounds to bring you back from where you rested  
May God Bless it  
Im agnostic so keep that  
Pure toxic up in your eyes nigga peep that  
We know where you sleep at  
As we speak my peeps is mashin  
And we know that you weak ass bunglin bitches is who we snatchin  
She catchin hollow rounds  
Shots to the head make a hollow sound  
Got away with murder PARANOID I push this bottle down  
One sip put the bottle down  
And blaze a blunt this ones for you  
Now you rest in peace no hard feelings bitch I swear its true  
If its necessary Black Market do whats called for  
And best believe when its time for war we all go  
And we all know nothin comes before this chessboard  
Two knights and kings fightin screens yes Lord  
Chorus  
Im spittin venom like a moccassin  
Grab a glock CHAMBER droppin men  
DANGER in my RANGER and I got to win  
DELUSION no aint no killin XRaided cause I refuse to  
Second Verse  
Bet all them foolsll know funk if they want it they got it  
All my proponents is riders committin murders sporadic  
We quick to get up inside ya blow out your thigh boy  
Psychotic shootin while yellin You got to die Boy  
Never shouldve crossed me flossy glossy like fresh made varnish  
With a reputation too solid to be penetrated and tarnished  
Harness rage its strong let it loose and you flagrant  
Produce a strap from my draws introducin slugs to the vagrants  
Statements was made so foul niggas is funny style  
Tell a hundred niggas you hate me but when you see me you smile  
But all the while you thinkin muthafuck XRaided  
But in your heart you never really felt you could fade it  
Debate it what I represent nigga this GBC  
Northern Cali freeway from the SacTown back down to the MSGs  
So hit the freeway no leeway cause this aint your zip code  
You keep your lip closed  
Or you get those lips swole  
We got your shit exposed stay the fuck away from us  
Well light you up and disappear like we vaporous  
My cavaliers wearin battle gear run up in your fort  
Put bullet holes in your shorts  
Left you dead on your porch  
Then we torched your spot my cohorts got counts calculated  
Shout out you hate it  
Thats what you get for doubtin XRaided  
Deport your corpse in where the copsll never bother to look  
Rigormortis decompose you served ya bored and now its over  
Chorus 2x
