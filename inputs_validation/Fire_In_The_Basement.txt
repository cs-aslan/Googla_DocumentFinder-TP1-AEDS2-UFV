I came round to your front door your back door was locked  
Pushed your button rang your bell you didnt hear me knock  
I saw your window open wide so I crawled inside  
I ran to the top floor but you were on the ground  
I was on my way up and you were going down  
  
Fire in the basement  
Burn me up scream and shout  
Theres fire in the basement  
Only you can put it out  
  
This strange sensation that Im going through  
Sweet infatuation when I get next to you  
I know what it takes to be a man you understand  
Cause when the sparks start flying youll never be the same  
You know Ill hate to leave you girl but Im so glad I came  
  
Fire in the basement  
Burn me up scream and shout  
Fire in the basement  
Only you can put it out  
  
Smoky eyes burning bright  
Innocence lost satisfy my appetite  
Surrender to the flame whats your name  
Lets get down to business how can you refuse  
Give this boy a helping hand come on light my fuse
