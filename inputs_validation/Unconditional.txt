Unconditional unconditional  
Unconditional unconditional  
Who else would let someone nail them to a cross  
For the sake of others so they would not be lost  
No one no one will go that far for us  
Who else would let someone get away with so much wrong  
But still extend them grace  
No one no one have so much love for us  
The kind of love He shows is unconditional  
His love dont come and go its unconditional  
Who else but Him Hes a constant friend  
Even when others turn their backs against  
No one oh no one is always there for us  
So what kind of love  
The kind of love He shows is unconditional  
His love dont come and go its unconditional  
The kind of love He shows is unconditional  
His love dont come and go its unconditional  
So even when your closest friends and family give up on you  
Theres not a day when you cant depend on Him  
The kind of love He shows is unconditional  
His love dont come and go its unconditional  
The kind of love He shows is unconditional  
His love dont come and go its unconditional  
The kind of love He shows is unconditional  
His love dont come and go its unconditional
