Whatll I tell him  
When he comes to me for absolution  
Wouldnt you know it  
Hope I dont make a bad decision  
  
Cause Id like to believe  
That there is a God  
Why sinful angels suffer for love  
Id like to believe  
In the terrible truth in the beautiful lie  
  
Like to know you  
But in this town I cant get arrested  
If you know me  
Why dont you tell me what Im thinking  
  
Hey dont look now  
But there goes God  
In his sexy pants and his sausage dog  
And he cant stand Beelzebub  
Cause he looks so good in black in black  
  
Hey dont look now  
But there goes God  
In his sexy pants and his sausage dog  
And he cant stand Beelzebub  
Cause he looks so good in black in black in black  
  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
  
There is a God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God
