Now theres no storyline  
Just a real good time  
And I dont want to seem to be mistaken  
But theres a tale to tell  
On this road to hell  
Its in between the lines the case Im making  
  
Oh lord look my way  
Save me from these crazy things I see  
I dont know whats going on round here these days  
But I cant dance to that  
Oh I cant dance to that  
So let me dance to this  
cause I cant dance to that  
  
If youll excuse me please  
You see I got to go  
And take myself before Im past redemption  
A voice is calling out  
As if I didnt know  
This wretched road is paved with good intentions  
All the way  
Down this Judas track  
I know it so well  
And I aint going back  
I dont know what happened to the good time songs  
But I cant dance to that  
Oh I cant dance to that  
So let me dance to this  
cause I cant dance to that  
  
Tell me what you know  
Take away these chains  
What stood in front of me it looks so pretty  
But I cant dance to a cold machine  
Oh lord and every drummer you know just what I mean  
Oh I cant dance to that  
So let me dance to this
