Youre the life of the party everybodys host  
Still you need somewhere you can hide  
All your good time friends  
And your farewell to hasbeens  
Lord knows just along for the ride  
You think youre a survivor  
But boy you better think twice  
No one rides for nothin  
So step up and pay the price  
Its a high cost of low livin  
Aint it high time You turn yourself around  
Yeah the high cost of low livin  
Its bound to put you six feet in the ground  
So many here who love ya  
But still you just cant tell  
Real ones and those who drop your name  
All the while behind your back  
They lift the flesh right from your bones  
You should know by now through all their game  
Theyve been chasing each dream with whiskey  
From here to Tokyo  
Usin up all your real friends  
Places left to go  
Its a high cost of low livin  
Aint it high time You turn yourself around  
Yeah the high cost of low livin  
Its bound to put you six feet in the ground  
Dont look behind you  
Ahh dont look back  
Dont turn to find reason in the past  
Past is gone gone at last  
And its high cost of low livin  
And its high time you turn yourself around  
Well the high cost of low livin  
Its bound to put you six feet in the ground
