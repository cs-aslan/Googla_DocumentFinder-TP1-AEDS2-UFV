Pulsing pulsing  
Theres a beat in his arm still  
Pulsing pulsing  
Like the throb of an anthill  
Pulsing pulsing  
No death in the rain  
Ive been washing my hands  
In the stuff I wash my brains  
Im pulsing  
Youre pulsing  
Whos pulsing  
Whats pulsing  
Pulsing pulsing  
Theres a lump in his throat still  
Pulsing pulsing  
At the site of a crash throw  
Pulsing pulsing  
No push in the vein  
Ive been washing my hands  
In the stuff I wash my brains
