One day youll come into my world and say it all  
You say well be together even even youre lost  
One day youll say these words  
I thought youll never say  
You say were better off together in our bed  
  
I want you here with me  
Like how I pictured it  
So I dont have to keep imagining  
  
Come on jump out at me  
Come on bring everything  
Is it too much to ask for something great  
  
The script was written and I could not change a thing  
I want to rip it all to shreds and start again  
One day Ill come into your world and get it right  
Ill say were better off together here tonight  
  
I want you here with me  
Like how I pictured it  
So I dont have to keep imagining  
  
Come on jump out at me  
Come on bring everything  
Is it too much to ask for something great  
  
I want you here with me  
Like how I pictured it  
So I dont have to keep imagining  
  
Come on jump out at me  
Come on bring everything  
Is it too much to ask for something great  
  
I want you here with me  
Like how I pictured it  
Is it too much to ask for something great  
  
Youre all I want  
So much its hurting  
Youre all I want  
So much its hurting
