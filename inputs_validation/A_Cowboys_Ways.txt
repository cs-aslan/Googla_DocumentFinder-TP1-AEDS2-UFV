Dolly Parton  
Sometimes he gets crazy as men are known to do  
Hell lose his head in spite of everything he stands to lose  
What is it in a man that makes him act like such a fool  
She swears she never knew but always needed to  
But stubborn pride is just the way of cowboys I suppose  
Even love cant change the things he ought to change the most  
And its pride that keeps him standing when he should be on his knees  
Makin apologies but she loves him desperately  
Oh but now and again she wished hed been a poet  
So hed know all the perfect lines to say  
And have some great romantic way to show it  
Be the hero ridin up to save the day  
And go ridin high like a knight in shinin armor  
To sweep her up and carry her away  
Oh but he dont have no magic ways to charm her  
No cause even love cant change a cowboys ways  
I love you and Im sorry are words that just dont come  
Cause words like that are no match for the kind that rule his tongue  
But his eyes keep tellin her you know I love you anyway  
No matter what I say or what I never say  
Oh but now and again she wished hed been a poet  
So hed know all those fancy lines to say  
And have some great romantic way to show it  
Be the hero ridin up to save the day  
And go ridin high like a knight in shinin armor  
And sweep her up and carry her away  
Oh but he dont have no magic ways to charm her  
No cause even love cant change a cowboys ways  
His ways seem cold but she knows hes much warmer  
But even love cant change a cowboys ways  
Hes just a fool that must defend his honor  
But even love cant change a cowboys ways
