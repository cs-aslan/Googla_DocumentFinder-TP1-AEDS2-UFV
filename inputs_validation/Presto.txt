If I could wave my magic wand  
  
I am made from the dust of the stars  
And the oceans flow in my veins  
Here I hide in the heart of the city  
Like a stranger coming out of the rain  
  
The evening plane rises up from the runway  
Over constellations of light  
I look down into a million houses  
And wonder what youre doing tonight  
  
If I could wave my magic wand  
Id make everything all right  
  
Im not one to believe in magic  
But I sometimes have a secondsight  
Im not one with a sense of proportion  
When my heart still changes overnight  
  
I had a dream of a winter garden  
A midnight rendezvous  
Silver blue and frozen silence  
What a fool I was for you  
  
I had a dream of the open water  
I was swimming away out to sea  
So deep I could never touch bottom  
What a fool I used to be  
  
If I could wave my magic wand  
Id set everybody free  
  
Im not one to believe in magic  
Though my memory has a secondsight  
Im not one to go pointing my finger  
When I radiate more heat than light  
  
Dont ask me  
Im just improvising  
My illusion of careless flight  
Cant you see  
My temperatures rising  
I radiate more heat than light  
  
Dont ask me  
Im just sympathizing  
My illusions a harmless flight  
Cant you see  
My temperatures rising  
I radiate more heat than light
