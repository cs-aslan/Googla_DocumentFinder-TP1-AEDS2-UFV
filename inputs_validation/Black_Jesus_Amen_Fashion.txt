I grew up in New York City  
Since I was born on Broadway baby  
Moved downtown when I was just nineteen  
To start a new life on the New York scene  
  
Theres no way I could be stopped  
Was taking my best shot  
I had better plans theres no way I could be stopped  
Was coming for your spot I met a better man  
  
Amen on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion on the runway  
Work it black Jesus  
  
Amen on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion on the runway  
Work it black Jesus  
  
Dancing in my revelation  
Underground pop civilization  
Concrete poetry to feed my mind  
Old symbolism was left behind  
  
Theres no way I could be stopped  
Was taking my best shot  
I had better plans theres theres no way I could be stopped  
Was coming for your spot I met a better man  
  
Amen on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion on the runway  
Work it black Jesus  
  
Amen on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion on the runway  
Work it black Jesus  
  
Put it on amen fashion  
Celebrate oh oh a new compassion  
Put it on amen fashion  
Celebrate ooh ooh style your passion  
  
Put it on amen fashion  
Celebrate oh oh a new compassion  
Put it on amen fashion  
Celebrate oh oh wear out your vision  
  
Black Jesus black Jesus black Jesus  
Jesus is the new black oh  
  
Amen on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion on the runway  
Work it black Jesus  
  
Amen on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion on the runway  
Work it black Jesus  
  
Amen on the runway  
Dressed in his best  
Amen fashion on the runway  
Work it black Jesus
