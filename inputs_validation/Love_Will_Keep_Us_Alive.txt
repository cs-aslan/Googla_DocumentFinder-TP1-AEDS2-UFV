When I look at you  
I can see the sadness in your eyes  
In these desperate times  
We get pushed and shoved from every side  
  
I cant love you if you wont let me  
Cant touch me if you dont try  
I can feel you  
I know that youre ready to take it to the other side  
  
Love will keep us alive  
Lets make the moment right  
Its now or never  
Love will keep us alive  
Even the darkest night  
Will shine forever  
Love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Love love will keep us alive  
  
When you walk away  
Theres an empty feeling in my mind  
As the days go by  
We get caught up in our separate lives  
  
If you need me  
You know Ill come running  
Right to you  
Just give me a sign  
I wont leave you  
Well make it together  
And take it to the end of time  
  
Love will keep us alive  
Lets make the moment right  
Its now or never  
Love will keep us alive  
Even the darkest night  
Will shine forever  
Love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Love love will keep us alive  
  
Oh Ive got a lot of loving to show you  
You know Id never want to control you  
I only want to be by your side  
  
I cant love you if you wont let me  
Cant touch me if you dont try  
I can feel you  
I know that youre ready to take it to the other side  
  
Love will keep us alive  
Lets make the moment right  
Its now or never  
Love will keep us alive  
Even the darkest night  
Will shine forever  
Love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Love love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Alive  
Love will keep us alive
