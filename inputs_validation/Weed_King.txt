Long Live Rockathon  
Offspring and Tag alongs were finding  
The history book has lost its binding  
Pages everywhere  
Two Titans without care will read them  
We conjure ghosts and then we feed them  
And if it all goes well well laugh a lot  
And then well all take photographs  
Of what we madelemonade  
Freedomcake quick to bake  
Trim the tree collectively  
Breath the air from the fair  
And watch colored lights shine down  
Dancing round the ladys face  
As we learned the sound  
We cant keep this violent pace  
Though we know that haste makes waste  
And Im giving you a ring  
For the dreams of the weedking we all sing
