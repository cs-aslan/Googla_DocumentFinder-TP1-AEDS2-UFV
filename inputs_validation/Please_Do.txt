You never cried you never froze  
And yet how well your garden grows   
You reap the fruits another sows  
I guess that works out well for you  
Suffering has served you well   
Its common but it somehow sells  
So sing your little songs of hell and sell  
Hollow hopes and empty dreams  
And blind pursuit of worthless schemes   
Thats all there is to life it seems  
unless you prove me wrong  please do
