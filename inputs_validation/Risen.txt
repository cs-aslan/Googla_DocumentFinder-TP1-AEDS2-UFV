Im not quite sure how I got here  
A minute passed and Im on my feet  
I never knew life could taste so good  
I need a little minute just a moment to breathe  
No matter where I go no matter who I see  
Well Im reminded of my earlier days  
No matter where I roll no matter what I know  
Well Im reminded of my earlier ways  
But now I keep asking myself  
  
Wouldnt it be the best damn day  
If we all took time to breathe  
Just one stolen paragraph  
In the books written history  
Dont you sometimes wonder why  
People are afraid to smile  
Dont look down were gonna come around  
And it always come to  
back crack of time eventually  
Just ascend with me  
  
Im not quite sure when I woke up  
The night flew by as I lay asleep  
Who ever knew that life could feel so good  
I need another minute  
Just a moment to breathe  
No matter where I go no matter who I see  
Well Im reminded of my earlier days  
No matter what I know no matter where I roll  
Well Im reminded of my earlier ways  
But now I keep asking myself  
Wouldnt it be the best damn day  
If we all took time to breathe  
Just one stolen paragraph  
In the books written history  
Dont you sometimes wonder why  
People are afraid to smile  
Dont look down were gonna come around and it always come to back  
crack of time eventually  
  
Wouldnt it be the best damn day  
Wouldnt it be a wonderful day  
Wouldnt it be a glorious day  
If we all took time to smile  
Made just a minute for you and me  
Wouldnt it be the best damn day
