When they tell you Im dating  
With somebody new  
Dont you know that Im playing a part  
Forgetting you  
I still want you to want me  
Though you said were through  
Cant you see that I dont want to start  
Forgetting you  
I tried to stay at home and pace the floor and watch the clock routine  
Til I began to see your face in every magazine  
I dont want other kisses  
Only yours will do  
Dont you know that its breaking my heart  
Forgetting you  
I tried to stay at home and pace the floor and watch the clock routine  
Til I began to see your face in every magazine  
I dont want other kisses  
Only yours will do  
Dont you know that its busting my heart  
Forgetting you  
Forgetting you  
Forgetting you
