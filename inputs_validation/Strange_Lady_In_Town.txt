Shes all that any man could ever hope or pray for  
If I were king Id trade the crown  
For that strange strange lady in town  
  
Oh heart of mine your in danger  
Theres a strange lady in town  
Who is this heart stealin stranger  
Who is turnin the town upside down  
  
Her hair is red as the setting sun  
Her lips are ripe as the corn  
The lights that rise in her sea green eyes  
Make a man can be glad he was born
