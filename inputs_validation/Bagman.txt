Bagman honey  
Bagman sugar  
Bagman honey  
Bagman sugar  
  
I know it feels good  
But be careful with your vices  
Falling  
Crawling on your knees again  
Watch out for the bagman  
  
Bagman honey  
Itll drive us insane  
Bagman sugar  
Oh do what you want  
Fat man shouting  
Youre holding on for nothing baby  
Bagman sleazy  
Does it hurt  
  
We almost got it right  
Revelation  
Conversation made it laden  
With the bagmans bag  
  
Bagman honey  
Itll drive us insane  
Bagman sugar  
Oh do what you want  
Fat man shouting  
Youre holding on for nothing baby  
Bagman sleazy  
Does it hurt  
  
Then  
There was a dream  
When you said we would be free  
But now is the time  
To be real  
  
Bagman honey  
Bagman sugar  
Fat man shouting  
Bagman sleazy  
  
Bagman honey  
Itll drive us insane  
Bagman sugar  
Oh do what you want  
Fat man shouting  
Youre holding on for nothing baby  
Bagman sleazy
