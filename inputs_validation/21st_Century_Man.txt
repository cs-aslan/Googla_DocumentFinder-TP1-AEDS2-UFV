Suck it up its a new sensation  
Hes a 21st century man  
Hooked on into the new vibration  
You can tell by shaking his hand  
Feeling his head throb he lights up a flash mob  
  
Hey damnation watch him go now a better battle plan  
  
Hey mutation techno freak how 21st century man  
Hey damnation in your face he does the best I can  
Hey mutation outer space for the 21st century man  
  
Suck it up as the worlds collide  
Hes a 21st century man  
Living large than hes cast aside  
Theres got to be a better plan  
Preparing for the next war iPhone in his hand  
  
Feeling his heart jump turn up the heat pump  
  
All the colors turn to gray  
The innocence has gone away  
Too much info here to stay  
21st century man  
  
Suck it up and the masturbation  
Said the 21st century man  
Im hooked on into a goodbye nation  
You can tell by his futile hands  
Hes heading down the fast road  
Limited attention span  
Feeling his soul burn  
Never did quite learn
