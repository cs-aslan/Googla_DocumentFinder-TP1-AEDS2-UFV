The chapter is opened and the pages are turned  
The writting say many things but who was concerned  
  
Where can we run to now when will we learn  
When its lost gone forever  
  
For years they told me what I should to do  
Down to the places I go and who I should talk to  
But that dont matter no more since I found out the truth  
And it feels good to me  
  
The world is turnin  
Forever turnin  
Forever yearnin  
For the love of life  
And youre wrong if think that Im afraid to love  
  
I wonder I wonder does it not seem strange to you  
Just how the tables have turned on me and you  
  
How long can we go on livin livin the way we do  
When its lost its gone forever  
  
It feels good to me etc
