Driving that train high on cocaine  
Casey Jones you better watch your speed  
Trouble ahead trouble behind  
And you know that notion just crossed my mind  
  
This old engine makes it on time  
Leaves Central Station bout a quarter to nine  
Hits River Junction at seventeen to  
At a quarter to ten you know its travelin again  
  
Driving that train high on cocaine  
Casey Jones you better watch your speed  
Trouble ahead trouble behind  
And you know that notion just crossed my mind  
  
Trouble ahead Lady in red  
Take my advice youd be better off dead  
Switchmans sleeping train hundred and two is  
On the wrong track and headed for you  
  
Driving that train high on cocaine  
Trouble ahead trouble behind  
And you know that notion just crossed my mind  
  
Trouble with you is the trouble with me  
Got two good eyes but you still dont see  
Come round the bend you know its the end  
The fireman screams and the engine just gleams
