Fifteen minutes to six and fourteen floors to go  
Thirteen suited strangers make a crowded elevator slow  
And Ive got a million words and phases on the tip of my tongue  
For the only nonstranger next to me soon shell know  
let em stare  
  
If I could  
I think I would give in  
And let you in on how I feel  
I need to spill  
Let it all out right now  
And expose every inch in front of them  
  
Twelve more floors  
And your eyes in mine are all I need to come clean  
Or should I wait until the lobby  
And spare the lives of some twentysix nervous eyes  
Being occupied by the little red numbers passing by  
If I wait one minute longer  
I think I will die  
let em stare  
  
If I could  
I think I would give in  
And let you in on how I feel  
I need to spill  
Let it all out right now  
Expose every inch in front of them  
  
You help me to feel see and know why all the while Ive been so inquisitive  
I cant go back cause now I know  
How it feels to open up and breathe
