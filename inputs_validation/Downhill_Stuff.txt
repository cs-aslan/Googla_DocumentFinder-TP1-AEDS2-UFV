Blue river blues  
Id rather be outside  
Here I am inside  
Watching it rain  
  
Blue river blues  
Id rather be somewhere  
Here I am nowhere  
Watching it rain  
  
Some people like that downhill stuff  
They like it fast and breezy  
Some people walk on the other side  
They like it slow and easy  
  
Chorus  
Some people run on a mountain trail  
Some like it wild and rough  
Some like to fly and some like to sail  
Some like the downhill stuff  
  
Theres work in what we practice  
Work in the things we say  
Sometime we work just to try to make a living  
Or were working just to make it pay  
  
Sometimes were trying to work our will  
But that wont work anyway  
I only know that Im working still  
Just to get another chance to play  
  
Chorus  
  
Some people run on a mountain trail  
Some like it wild and rough  
Some like to fly and some like to sail  
Some like the downhill stuff  
  
Keep a moving in a forward direction  
Like a river rolling down to the sea  
If you want to make different selection  
Honey let yourself go with gravity  
  
Oh everybodys looking for heaven  
Everybodys looking for hope  
Everybody looking for higher and higher  
But nobody wants to be looking alone  
  
Everybodys trying to get down to it  
Everybodys trying to sing  
Whatever it is were all gonna do it  
But whatever we do  
We gotta do our own thing  
  
Some people like that downhill stuff  
They like it fast and breezy  
Some people walk on the other side  
They like it slow and easy  
  
Some people run on a mountain trail  
Some like it wild and rough  
Some like to fly and some like to sail  
Some like the downhill stuff
