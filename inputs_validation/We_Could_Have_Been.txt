Today at work I overheard a name  
I knew it wasnt yours but it touched me just the same  
It felt so good to have you in my mind  
I guess Im the sentimental kind  
  
I wonder who you became  
Did you change the world  
Or play the game  
We came so close to love back then  
We could have been  
  
You were so brave when I was shy  
I made you laugh when something made you cry  
And I dont think we ever said goodbye  
Now Ill always wonder why  
  
I wonder who you became  
Did you change the world  
Or play the game  
We came so close to love back then  
We could have been  
  
A time or two  
I thought about calling  
But something always gets in the way  
Maybe Im afraid youd really answer  
What would I say to you  
  
I wonder who you became  
Did you change the world  
Or play the game  
We came so close to love back then  
We could have been  
  
We could have been
