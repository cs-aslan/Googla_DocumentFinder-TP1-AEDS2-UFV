Woke up with a headache from the night before  
Cause sometimes I drink  
Spent the night with my head in the toilet bowl  
Its where I like to think  
I said cause I dont want no one to take a piece of my heart  
I hate to lose all the little bitty pieces from my heart  
Ladada heyo  
  
Ya ever spend all night thinking about your life  
Well I suggest we try  
Well its something that youre gonna wanna do with the night  
Cause I tend to cry  
I said cause I dont want no one to take a piece of my heart  
I hate to lose all the little bitty pieces from my heart  
Lalalala hadeyo  
  
Ya ever spent all day thinkin bout the night  
Its something that you do  
When you think away too much youre out of sight  
What ya gonna doi said cause I dont want no one to take a piece of my heart  
I hate to lose all the little bitty pieces from my heart  
Lalalala hadeyo
