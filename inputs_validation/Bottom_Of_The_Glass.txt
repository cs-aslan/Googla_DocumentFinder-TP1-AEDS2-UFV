You think that you have found a way to ease your troubled mind  
You fill a glass then drink it down and fill it one more time  
Well the wine will flow and the pain will go but the spell will never last  
Youll never find the answer in the bottom of the glass  
Youll never find the answer in the bottom of the glass  
Well the bottom of the glass is just as empty as your life  
You know it holds no secret way to help you in your strife  
But for a while youre in another world and you wake up in the past  
Youll never find the answer in the bottom of the glass  
Youll never find the answer in the bottom of the glass  
Glass  
  
That bottle there is not your friend when its gone it leaves you cold  
The strength it gives you slips away for its something you cant hold  
Your hands will shake and then youll take another from the flask  
But youll never find the answer in the bottom of the glass  
Youll never find the answer in the bottom of the glass  
Youll never find the answer in the bottom of the glass  
Youll never find the answer in the bottom of the glass
