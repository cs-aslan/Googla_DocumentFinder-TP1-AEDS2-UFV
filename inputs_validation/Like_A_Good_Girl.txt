As I looked across  
To where she where she was before  
I didnt have long  
To wait around here anymore  
We went to a place  
That I hadnt seen before  
She worked me over  
Then she went anyway  
  
She looked to me like a good girl  
I played along like a fool  
I paid along just to find out  
Shes no exception to the rule  
  
As I carried on  
Looking here and there  
I couldnt believe  
She worked it out  
And it worked on me  
I guessed early on  
But it didnt click inside  
She knew my weakness  
And she knew my name  
  
She looked to me like a good girl  
I played along like a fool  
I paid along just to find out  
Shes no exception to the rule  
  
As I carried on
