Everybodys talking  
But they dont say a thing  
They look at me with sad eyes  
But I dont want their sympathy  
Its cool you didnt want me  
Sometimes you cant go back  
By whyd you have to go  
And make a mess like that  
Well I just have to say before I let go  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
When the truth came out  
Were you the last to know  
Were you left out in the cold  
Cause what you did was low  
  
No I dont need your number  
Theres nothing left to say  
Cept I never thought itd  
Hurt this much to be saved  
My friends are outside waiting  
Ive gotta go  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
When the truth came out  
Were you the last to know  
Were you left out in the cold  
Cause what you did was low  
What you did was low  
What you did was low  
What you did was low  
  
I walk out of this darkness  
With no sense of regret  
And I go with a clear conscience  
We both know that you cant say that  
This to show for all the time I loved you so  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
When the truth came out  
Were you the last to know  
Were you left out in the cold  
Cause what you did was low  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
When the truth came out  
Were you the last to know  
Were you left out in the cold  
Cause what you did was low  
  
Have you ever been low  
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so  
Cause what you did was low
