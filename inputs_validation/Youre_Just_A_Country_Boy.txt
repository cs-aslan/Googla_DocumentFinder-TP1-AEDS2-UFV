Aint gonna marry in the fall  
Aint gonna marry in the spring  
For youre in love  
With a pretty little girl  
Who wears a diamond ring  
  
Chorus  
Youre just a country boy  
Money  have you none  
But youve got silver  
In the stars  
Gold in the morning sun  
Gold in the morning sun  
  
Never gonna kiss the ruby red lips  
Of the prettiest girl in town  
Never gonna ask her if shell marry you  
Shed only turn you down  
  
Chorus  
  
Never could afford a storebought ring  
With a sparklin diamond stone  
All you could afford is a loving heart  
The only one you own  
  
Chorus
