Ive got some good news cant wait to tell you  
I realized I missed you since weve been apart  
I just needed time  
To make up my mind  
But Im in love with you with all my heart  
Ive got some good news  
  
I got some bad news I dont know how to break to you  
I found someone new since we been apart  
I had too much time  
An he took you off my mind  
An Im in love with him with all of my heart  
I got some bad news  
  
An I guess all is fair in love an war  
Someone wins  
But someone wins more  
You never know what time will do  
All I know is Ive got some good news  
Ive got some bad news
