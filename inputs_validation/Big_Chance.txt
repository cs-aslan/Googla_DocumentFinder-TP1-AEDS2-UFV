People in their pride believe its easier for them to leave  
Their problems in the arms of others running to their mothers  
Lasting love is such a funny thing  
When youre in love youre on the wings  
Youre not in love its good for you  
cause you can do the things you want to do  
  
Its you big chance to take it baby  
Its you big chance youll make it baby  
  
When youre high and mighty youll remember how I loved you  
Youll be thinkin how you hurt me when I needed you beside me  
In the night is such a lonely time  
I dream of you and thats a sign  
It means that I am still a fool  
And I am still so much in love with you  
  
Its your big chance so take it baby  
Its your big chance dont fake it baby  
  
Big chance  
Hot chance
