Chorus  
I love it when you smile  
When youre with me honey  
It happens all the while  
How it kills me when you cry  
And you know my heart  
Thats no word of a lie  
  
Everyday you show me something new about you  
Honestly I could never live without you  
Look at me heres a soul wholl never doubt you  
And I will be forever by your side  
  
Chorus  
  
Probably the greatest feeling I have ever known  
Actually is when you wrap yourself around me  
Promise me youll stay now that Ive found you  
And I will be forever by your side  
  
Chorus  
  
And you could say youve heard it all before  
And I know that any day you may walk out the door  
When I say no one will love you more believe me  
And I will be forever by your side  
  
Chorus
