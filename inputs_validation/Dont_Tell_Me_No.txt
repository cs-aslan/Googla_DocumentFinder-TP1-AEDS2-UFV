Everytime I look into you it tears me up inside  
Got a hunger for ya woman that just cant be denied  
Dont tell me no aint my kind of answer  
Dont tell me no wont accept that answer  
Makin lots of money honey aint what I call success  
And I wont have what I need until you tell me yes  
Dont tell me no  aint my kind of answer  
Dont tell me no  aint no kind of answer  
Thats how much I want you  
Like a good brew like a fine wine  
You improve with time and I want you I love you  
Thats how much I need ya  
Youre a part of me my philosophy my reality  
And I want you thats how much I love you  
Realize alibis aint too wise  
And they just wont cut this time  
Youre gonna give this boy a chance  
Cause hes apt to blow your mind  
Dont tell me no aint my kind of answer  
Dont tell me no wont accept that answer
