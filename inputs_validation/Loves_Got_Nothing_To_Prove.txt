Love isnt just  
Somethin to try  
No act of love  
Can satisfy  
Youve got to believe  
Its live or die  
To ask yourself the question  
How can love survive  
  
And if we try  
And it dont work out  
Like so many people do  
Its just a fact of life  
No we aint in charge  
There aint nothin thats wrong with me  
Aint nothin thats wrong with you  
  
Chorus  
  
Loves got Nothin to Prove  
Its not up to you  
Two souls come into a world made  
Of time and space  
Searchin for the truth  
With nothin but love to prove  
And find it in the gift of  
A moment of grace  
  
Your heart is broken  
Cause your love was untrue  
Youre asking God  
Oh why you  
  
Oh was it crazy  
Givin all of you  
You ask yourself the question  
What more could I do  
  
Bridge and Chorus  
  
Theres always somebody to tell you how  
You were a fool who jus believed too much  
But in the end the fool youll come to know  
Is not the one who loved
