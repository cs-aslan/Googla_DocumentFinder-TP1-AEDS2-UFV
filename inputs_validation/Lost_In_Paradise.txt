What am I supposed to do with this heart  
How do I take it off if the love aint on its like a work of art  
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder  
What am I supposed to do with this heart  
  
It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise  
  
Im so lost in paradise  
If I open up my eyes  
I can see the storm I can see the sky  
I can see the darkness flashing lights  
All my fears dont deny  
Let me stay Im lost in paradise  
  
How was I to know that my love was delusional  
Somebody tell me how to mend a brokenhearted soul  
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder  
What am I supposed to do with this heart  
  
It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise  
  
Im so lost in paradise  
If I open up my eyes  
I can see the storm I can see the sky  
I can see the darkness flashing lights  
All my fears dont deny  
Let me stay Im lost in paradise  
  
It may be wrong but it feels right  
All my fears are gone tonight  
Im lost in paradise  
  
Im so lost in paradise  
If I open up my eyes  
I can see the storm I can see the sky  
I can see the darkness flashing lights  
All my fears dont deny  
Let me stay Im lost in paradise  
  
Lost in paradise  
Yeah lost in paradise  
Lost in paradise
