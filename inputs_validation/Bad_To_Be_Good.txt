Theres an alley cat slowly walkin down a dirty street  
Watching a cop on the take marching to his city beat  
You got Fivefingers Johnny stealing everything in sight  
You gotta be bad to be good in the dead of the night  
Kick it  
  
Youre dancing in fire baby  
When youre takin it to the streets  
Yeah to the streets  
Baby better watch your back  
Fast on your feet  
  
Cause theyre wheelin dealin  
Cheatin stealin  
Child youre gonna learn  
  
Chorus  
You gotta be bad to be good  
If you know what Im talkin about  
Whats that  
So I say it again  
You gotta be bad to be good  
In the dead of the night  
  
When you got nothin baby  
You got nothin to lose nothin to lose  
Its an eye for an eye baby  
And a tooth for a tooth  
Aint it the truth  
  
If you got nine lives you might survive  
Cause nothings free on the other side  
  
Chorus  
  
Wheelin dealin cheatin stealin  
Just to stay alive  
They got love for sale yes for sale  
On the New York subway line  
Watch the working girls hanging out  
Turning tricks underneath the lights  
The lights  
  
One step from Hell  
The poor men sell their soul  
For a taste of wine  
  
Chorus  
  
When its said and done  
And youre on the run  
And the only law comes under the gun
