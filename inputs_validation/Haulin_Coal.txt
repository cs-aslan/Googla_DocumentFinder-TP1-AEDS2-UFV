Steamin down the muddy waters  
Travelin yonder from bay to bay  
I been workin on the barge line  
Fourteen years ago today  
Eighteen hours hard labor by the day  
Aint much pay for a man  
  
Chorus  
Haulin coal down the down river  
And he wont be comin home for a long time  
  
Torches burning by the riverside  
Cast their shadows grey as stone  
And the cool October days replacing  
Much warmer thoughts of home  
I can still see grandma sittin on the porch  
Tellin the neighbors shes got a grandson  
  
Chorus  
Haulin coal down the down river  
And he wont be comin home for a long time  
  
Rivers rising up the marker line  
While the willows softly moan  
Sun is rising over the starboard shore  
Paving the golden road back home  
  
I can still see the kids jumpin rope  
But there aint much hope for a man  
  
Chorus  
Haulin coal down the down river  
And he wont be comin home for a long time  
  
Haulin coal down the down river  
Ill be gone a long time  
  
Haulin coal down the down river  
Ill be gone a long while
