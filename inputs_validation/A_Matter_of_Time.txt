Lets change the subject to someone else  
You know lately Ive been subject to change  
Normally I reel in the strange  
Hangover Im older  
  
Youre one to talk the heart is a clock  
Just like a bomb it keeps on ticking away  
Counting down to detonate  
You will need an army to summon me  
  
It doesnt matter much to me  
If it doesnt matter much to you ooh ooh  
It doesnt matter much to me  
If it doesnt matter much to you  
  
Its just a matter of time before before  
Its just a matter of time before before  
And though I hate to rewind before before  
Its just a matter of time  
  
My past is getting us nowhere fast  
I was never one for taking things slow  
Nowhere seems like somewhere to go  
Come over and over  
  
Doing my time for line after line  
When will I learn to sing these crimes to myself  
Prisoners to share a cell with  
Im holding still holding  
Holding you in  
  
It doesnt matter much to me  
If it doesnt matter much to you ooh ooh  
It doesnt matter much to me  
If it doesnt matter much to you  
  
Its just a matter of time before before  
Its just a matter of time before before  
And though I hate to rewind before before  
Its just a matter of time  
  
Where the hell are you Ooh ooh  
Where the hell are you Ooh ooh  
Where the hell are you  
  
Its just a matter of time before before  
Its just a matter of time before before  
And though I hate to rewind before before  
Its just a matter of time  
  
What does it matter now  
What does it matter now  
What does it matter now  
What does it matter now  
Its just a matter of time  
Time
