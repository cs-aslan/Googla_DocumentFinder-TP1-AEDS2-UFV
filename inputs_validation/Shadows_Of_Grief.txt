Youre looking at me  
Like I must be mad  
But Ive been through all this before  
Youll kick and kick until Im down  
So dont think youre  
Comin past my door oh no  
  
You think that love is such a pain  
So the more it hurts  
The more you laugh  
Just take it and  
Shake it up and down  
Till you think youve had enough  
But you wont get enough of my love  
  
If you want to carry on  
In the same old way  
Treating everyone like a piece of dirt  
Just take it and  
Break it and throw it away  
There wont be anyone left to hurt  
  
North South East and West  
Wherever you go  
Youll find the same  
And the only way youll ever learn  
Is to realize that youre to blame
