I know Im no angel  
Baby youre in trouble  
Since your curiosity got you head over heels over me  
Honey do you think that Im outa my mind  
The one whos in love till shes deaf dumb and blind aint me  
  
Want romance think you stand a chance  
Tell ya where to find it  
Youre never gonna find it in me  
I was born to be bad  
Take the stars above shower me with love  
Make it all too easy  
Dont have to be too easy with me  
I was born to be bad  
  
Oh get yourself together my love no need to make a scene here  
Its a beautiful habit being able to laugh at it all  
Better get away if you wanna stay  
Keep yourself from falling  
Aint no use in falling for me  
I was born to be bad  
  
Music  
  
Want romance think you stand a chance  
Tell ya where to find it  
Youre never gonna find it in me  
I was born to be bad  
Take the stars above shower me with love  
Make it all too easy  
Dont have to be too easy with me  
I was born to be bad  
  
Oh get yourself together my love no need to make a scene here  
Its a beautiful habit being able to laugh at it all  
Better get away if you wanna stay  
Keep yourself from falling  
Aint no use in falling for me  
I was born to be bad  
  
I was born to be bad  
  
I was born to be bad  
  
I was born to be Bad
