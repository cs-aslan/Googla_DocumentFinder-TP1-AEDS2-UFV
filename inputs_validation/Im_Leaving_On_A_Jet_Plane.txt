All my bags are packed  
Im ready to go  
Im standing here  
Outside your door  
Id hate to wake you up to say goodbye  
  
But the dawn is breaking its early morn  
The taxis waiting hes blowing his horn  
Im ready Im so lonesome I could die  
  
So kiss me and smile for me  
Tell me that youd wait for me  
Hold me like youd never let me go  
  
Coz Im leaving on a jet plane  
Dont know when Ill be back again  
Oh babe I hate to go  
But Im leaving on a jet plane  
Dont know when Ill be back again  
Oh babe
