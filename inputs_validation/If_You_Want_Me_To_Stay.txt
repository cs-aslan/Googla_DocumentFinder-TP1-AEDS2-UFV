If you want me to stay  
Ill be around today  
To be available for you to see  
Im about to go there  
Then youll know  
For me to stay here  
Ive got to be me  
  
Youll never be in doubt  
Thats what its all about  
You cant take me for granted and smile  
Count the days Im gone  
Forget reachin me by phone  
Cause I promise  
  
Ill be gone for a while  
And when you see me again  
I hope that you have been  
The kind of person  
  
That you really are now  
You got to get it straight  
How could I ever be late  
When youre my woman  
Taking up my time  
  
Oh how could I ever allow  
I guess I wonder how  
I could get out a pocket for fun  
When you know that  
Youre never number two  
Number ones gonna be number one  
  
Ill be good  
I wish I could  
Get this message over to you now  
When you see me again  
  
I hope that you have been  
The kind of person  
That you really are now  
Ill be so good  
I wish I could  
  
Get this message over to you now  
Get this message over to you now  
Ill be so good  
I wish I could
