If you look up in the sky  
On the night before Christmas  
Theres a big fat guy with a  
Toy sack  
Toy sack yeah yeah  
Its squeezing down through your fireplace  
Christmas Day  
A million Barbie dolls packed away  
Boxed up in a sack on a sleigh  
That jingle bell parka is as big as a whale  
They put everything into the toy sack  
They shove in a Chrysler  
And a tv from Sony  
So hurry up and pack that Shetland pony  
  
The toy sack is a magical place  
Where Santa puts the presents  
Toy sack Baby  
This sacks heavy  
Toy sack  
Break Santas back  
Call a chiropractor  
Crack Santas back  
  
Lugging and tuggin

Reachin in the bag  
Theres an EasyBake Oven  
Now back up the chimney  
Yeah its straining Santas jimmies  
That sacks not skinny  
But every year he lugs it  
Around and around and around and around  
Reindeer are hoofin  
There aint no time for goofin baby  
Elves linin up to pack toys for your town
