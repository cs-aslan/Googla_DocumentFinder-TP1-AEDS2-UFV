I been a bad boy  
I been long gone  
I been out there  
I never phone home  
I never gave you not one little clue where Id been  
Ive been a bad boy again  
I got a way of  
Fallin in love  
With angels that dont shove  
You into thinkin that you are committing a sin  
Ive been a bad boy again  
Ive been a bad boy again  
Now Ive been a bad boy again  
And all the trouble that Im in  
Makes me a bad boy again  
Ive been a bad boy again  
Now Ive been a bad boy again  
And all the trouble that Im in  
Makes me a bad boy again  
I must have walked round  
In a real fog  
I was your best friend  
Now Im a real dog  
I never thought that now  
Would ever catch up with then  
Ive been a bad boy again  
Ive been a bad boy  
I sung a wrong song  
I took a left turn  
I stayed too long  
As you were thinkin that I wasnt  
Just like all other men  
Ive been a bad boy again  
Ive been a bad boy again  
Now Ive been a bad boy again  
And all the trouble that Im in  
Makes me a bad boy again  
Ive been a bad boy again  
Now Ive been a bad boy again  
And all the trouble that Im in  
Makes me a bad boy again
