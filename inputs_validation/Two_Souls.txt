Whatever happened to the value of our love  
Ive seen you change  
Ive seen it coming slowly these changes  
Youre not the same  
  
Its not too late to start over  
Its not too late to turn around  
What are the things important to you  
Cant be the money  
Well I got news for you  
  
Two souls should be two souls together  
Two souls in the life that we planned  
But youre working obsession is squeezing me  
Out of your world  
  
Id rather live in a dolls house in a small street  
Where it always rains  
You kid yourself youre working all for me  
But older kids play with bigger trains  
  
Its not too late to start over  
Its not too late to turn round  
Its like we live in separate worlds  
Cant buy the lost time  
I want my share of you  
I want my share of you  
  
Two souls should be two souls together  
Two souls in the life that we planned  
But youre working obsession is squeezing me  
Out of your world  
  
Cant buy the lost time  
I want my share of you  
I want my share of you  
  
Two souls should be two souls together  
Two souls in the life that we planned  
Out of your world
