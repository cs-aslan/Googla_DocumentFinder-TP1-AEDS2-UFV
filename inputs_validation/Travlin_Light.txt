Im travlin light  
Because my man has gone  
But from now on  
Im travlin light  
  
He said Goodbye  
And took my heart away  
So from today  
Im travlin light  
  
No one to see  
Im free as the breeze  
No one but me  
And my memories  
  
Some lucky night  
He may come back again  
But until then  
Im travlin light  
  
No one to see  
Im free as the breeze  
No one but me  
And my memories  
  
Some lucky night  
He may he may come back again  
But until then  
Im travlin light
