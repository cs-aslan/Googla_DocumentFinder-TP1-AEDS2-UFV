Its been ten long years since Ive been home  
Ive been waiting here with nowhere to go  
Its an occupation I dont like  
But it pays the rent and turns on the light alright  
  
I told you so  
It has to be  
Cut loose and runaway with me  
Well go out every night  
Ill be there by your side  
And well all get high down the old west side  
  
If it aint the job and it aint the place  
But I must stay for your pretty face  
Its a bad reaction I cant fix  
You conned me with those feline tricks  
  
And I told you so  
Its a crazy world  
For a mixedup guy  
And a nogood girl  
  
And I told you so  
Its a crazy world  
For a mixedup guy  
With a nogood girl  
  
Take her take the world  
  
I told you so  
It has to be  
Cut loose and run away run away with me  
Well go out every night  
Ill be there by your side  
And well all get high down the old west side  
  
Down the old west side  
Down the old west side  
Down the old west side  
Take the world yeah
