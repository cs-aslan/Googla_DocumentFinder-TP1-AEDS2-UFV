Youre a one of a one  
A one of a kind  
That you only find once in a lifetime  
Made to fit like a fingerprint  
A code that clicks open a gold mine  
  
They say one mans trash is another mans treasure  
When I found you it was all pretty better  
  
Secretly I hit the lottery cause youre  
Brighter than all of the Northern the Lights  
You speak to me even in my dreams wouldnt  
Let you go for even the highest price  
  
They say one mans trash is another girls treasure  
So if its up to me Im gonna keep you forever  
  
Cause I understand you  
We see eye to eye  
Like a double rainbow  
In the sky  
And wherever you go  
So will I  
Cause a double rainbow  
Is hard to find  
  
Was a phenomenon when you came along yeah  
Chemistry was more than science  
It was deafening loud like  
lightning it was striking you couldnt deny it  
  
They say one mans trash is another mans treasure  
The two of us together make everything glitter  
  
Cause I understand you  
We see eye to eye  
Like a double rainbow  
In the sky  
And wherever you go  
So will I  
Cause a double rainbow  
Is hard to find  
  
To the bottom of the sea Id go to find you  
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you  
Every step I take Im keeping you in mind  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
Cause I understand you  
We see eye to eye  
Like a double rainbow  
In the sky  
And wherever you go I go up for you  
So will I  
Cause a double rainbow  
Is hard to find  
  
Its hard to find  
Oh its hard to find  
Once in a lifetime ah  
  
Once in a lifetime  
Once in a lifetime
