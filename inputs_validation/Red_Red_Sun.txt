Theres a red red sun  
And Im thinking of you  
I tell it a story  
And it sinks out of view  
  
One sun apart  
One heart within  
Red sun shines on  
Sees no tomorrow  
Sees no tomorrow  
  
Theres a girl far away  
And shes calling my name  
With a tower of love  
And a shadow of pain  
  
Theres a red red sun  
And its coming for you  
To waken your heart  
Like you know I always will do
