Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness  
Yeah Ill find a way to cure the pain  
If I said that youre my friend  
And our love would never end  
How long before I had your trust again  
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside  
Hopin that youd find your own way in  
But how can I protect you  
Or try not to neglect you  
When you wont take the love I have to give  
I bought me an illusion  
An I put it on the wall  
I let it fill my head with dreams  
And I had to have them all  
But oh the taste is never so sweet  
As what youd believe it is   
Well I guess it never is  
Its these prejudiced illusions  
That pump the blood  
To the heart of the biz  
  
You know I never thought  
That it could take so long  
You know I never knew how to be strong  
Yeah I let you shape me  
But it feels as though you raped me  
Cause you climbed inside my world  
And in my songs  
So now Ive closed the door  
To keep the cold outside  
Seems somehow Ive found the will to live  
But how can I forget you  
Or try not to reject you  
When we both know it takes time to forgive  
  
Sweetness is a virtue  
And you lost your virtue long ago  
You know Id like to hurt you  
But my conscience always tells me no  
You could sell your body on the street  
To anyone whom you might meet  
Whod love to try and get inside  
And bust your innocence open wide  
  
Cause my babys got a locomotive  
My babys gone off the track  
My babys got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like Im insane  
Take a closer look Im not to blame  
No  
  
Gonna have some fun with my frustrations  
Gonna watch the big screen in my head  
Id rather take a detour  
cause this road aint gettin clearer  
Your train of thought has cut me off again  
Better tame that boy cause hes a wild one  
Better tame that boy for hes a man  
Sweetheart dont make me laugh  
Yous gettin too big for your pants  
And Is think maybe you should  
Cut out while you can  
You can use your illusion   
Let it take you where it may  
We live and learn  
And then sometimes its best to walk away  
Me Im just here hangin on  
Its my only place to stay at least  
For now anyway  
Ive worked too hard for my illusions  
Just to throw them all away  
  
Im taking time quiet consolation  
In passing by this love thats passed away  
I know its never easy  
So why should you believe me  
When Ive always got so many things to say  
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made  
Cause playful hearts  
Can sometimes be enraged  
You know I tried to wake you  
I mean how long could it take you  
To open up your eyes and turn the page  
  
Kindness is a treasure  
And its one towards me youve seldom shown  
So Id say it for a good measure  
To all the ones like you Ive known  
Ya know Id like to shave your head  
And all my friends could paint it red  
Cause love to mes a two way street  
An all I really want is peace  
  
But my babys got a locomotive  
My babys gone off the track  
My babys got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like Im insane  
Take a closer look Im not to blame  
No  
  
Affection is a blessing  
Can you find it in your sordid heart  
I tried to keep this thing tagether  
But the tremor tore my pad apart  
Yeah I know its hard to face  
When all weve worked fors gone to waste  
But youre such a stupid woman  
And Im such a stupid man  
But love like times got its own plans  
  
Cause my babys got a locomotive  
My babys gone off the track  
My babys got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like Im insane  
Take a closer look Im not to blame  
Yeah  
If love is blind I guess Ill buy myself a cane  
  
Loves so strange
