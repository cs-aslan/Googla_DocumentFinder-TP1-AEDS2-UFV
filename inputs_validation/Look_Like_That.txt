I like his shoes I like his hat  
Id like me better if I looked like that  
Uh huh uhhuh  
I like her shoes I like her hat  
Id like you better if you looked like that  
Uhhuh uhhuh  
But then my love starts burning  
For what we are yearning to ignore  
I like her clothes I love her dress  
Id like her better if she loved me best  
I like his shoes I love his pants  
Id want him better if he wanted to dance  
Uhhuh uhhuh  
But then our love starts turning  
For what we are learning to adore  
Im meeting people nice people too  
Im meeting people nice people like you  
Were meeting people nice people too  
Were meeting people nice people like you
