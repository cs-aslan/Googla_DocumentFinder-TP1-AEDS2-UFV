Got the one room suite in the downtown motel  
Got a lovely view  
Classic shot of the parking lot  
An off ramp of route 72  
Half flat six pack of lukewarm beer  
So lay down by my side  
Like to whisper sweet nothings  
In my filthy ear till Im satisfied  
  
Babybootie juicyfruity  
Truckstop cutie roadsidebeauty  
Im in love with you  
Hope it dont last too long  
  
You got the mackerel eyes  
Brought the side of fries  
You got me hypnotized  
Im in love again  
Now baby when I told you  
That I love you  
I was only telling a lie  
Ill be long gone  
Come the crack of dawn  
And I believe the word is  
Goodbye bye baby bye bye  
  
I was only telling a lie  
There aint no need to act  
Like I shot your dog no  
I was only telling a lie lie lie lie lie
