Well yes people I am a poor drunken hearted boy  
Well yeah people I am a poor drunken hearted boy  
I have a whole ocean of trouble  
And just a little half pint of joy  
  
I drink because Im worried I dont drink because Im dry  
I know if I keep on drinkin Im liable to drink away my life  
But thats alright  
  
Baby bring me another halfapint  
Im trying to drown these blues yes I am  
People if you had my trouble  
Baby I know youd be drinkin too  
  
Alright  
Baby bring me some old Grandads hundred proof  
Dont play like that man youll make me thirsty  
Oh Lord  
  
Baby if I keep on drinkin I know I cant last too long  
Woman if I keep on drinkin people ya know I cant last too long  
Thats alright cause when Im dead and buried  
Please think about me when you hear this song
