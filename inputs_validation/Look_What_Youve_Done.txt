Now look what youve done  
Now look what youve done  
Look what youve done baby  
Now look what youve done  
You left me here  
The lonely one  
And all I can say  
Is look what youve done  
  
A broken heart  
A worried mind  
Because of you baby  
Dying all the time  
I once had a dream  
But now Ive none  
Your taking your love  
And see what it done  
  
I saw you last night  
Out moving round  
With your new turf  
You paint the town  
That is OK  
Youre having your fun  
Because some day  
They call you done  
  
And now your bird cries  
The shadow falls  
Gloomy memories  
And I recall  
Your love is my life  
As warm as the sun  
But now it is gone  
And see what it done
