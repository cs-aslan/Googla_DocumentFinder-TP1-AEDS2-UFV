  
Every time we lie awake  
After every hit we take  
Every feeling that I get  
But I havent missed you yet  
  
Every roommate kept awake  
By every silent scream we make  
All the feelings that I get  
But I still dont miss you yet  
  
Only when I start to think about it  
  
I hate everything about you  
Why do I love you  
  
Every time we lie awake  
After every hit we take hn  
Every feeling that I get  
But I havent missed you yet  
  
Only when I start to think about it  
  
I hate everything about you  
Why do I love you  
  
Only when I start to think about you I know  
  
I hate everything about you  
Why do I love you  
  
I hate you hate  
I hate you love me  
  
I hate everything about you  
Why do I love you
