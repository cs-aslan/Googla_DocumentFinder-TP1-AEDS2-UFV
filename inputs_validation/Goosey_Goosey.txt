Hey goosey goosey  
I believe its for having fun  
Hey goosey goosey  
I believe its for everyone  
  
One red morning  
With no warning  
Life comes crashing in  
To wake you early with its golden din  
  
One blue evening  
Cruelly leaving  
It goes breezing out  
The very second that you figure it out  
What its all for  
  
Everybody has a magic lantern  
Everybody has an inner eye  
Everybody has a magic carpet  
Seems a shame if you dont let it fly  
Tell you why  
  
Hey goosey goosey  
  
Some bright daytime  
Workers playtime  
You get countrybound  
Pick your girl up  
Throw your oilcan down  
  
Some dark nighttime  
Final frighttime  
As the reaper knocks  
The wisdom of the ancients in a box  
But its too late  
  
Everybody has a magic lantern  
  
Hey goosey goosey  
  
Yes I do  
  
Goosey goosey gander  
Wither do you wander
