I keep tellin myself this is the right thing to do  
I was wastin her time waitin on dreams that just werent comin true  
And this old highway seems to understand  
Leadin me on to somewhere that no one knows my name  
I got the window rolled down I got the radio up  
Im doin all that I can to get my mind off us  
  
What I need to do is turn this car around  
Drive as fast as I can til I see the lights of our hometown  
And run to her take her in my arms  
Make her see how sorry I am well that shouldnt be so hard  
But I drive on and on and on  
  
Eightyseven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue  
Theres a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do  
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville Tennessee  
I know my baby sister has got a couch where I can sleep  
Now the suns goin down on my broken heart  
Lord I gotta go back before I get too far  
  
What I need to do is turn this car around  
Drive as fast as I can til I see the lights of our hometown  
And run to her take her in my arms  
Make her see how sorry I am well that shouldnt be so hard  
But I drive on and on and on  
  
But I drive on  
Yes I drive on and on and on  
  
Knowin what I need to do  
Girl Im comin home to you  
  
Knowin what I need to do  
Girl Im comin home to you  
Im comin home to you  
Knowin what I need to do
