Tell me dark heart of my deep sleep  
Where the past drops in like unwanted guests  
Rattling their chains of thought shuffling their feet  
Peering into things I thought Id laid to rest  
And for all Ive left undone theres another dream to come  
  
Once there were wars fought over spice and salt  
And the stick of gold became the standard measure  
Nothing much has changed in this modern age  
And it wont until the pains not worth the pleasure  
  
And for all weve left undone  
Theres another war to come  
  
I want to feed and water the horses  
The course is long and dry  
Cant do it alone oh no we cant although weve tried and tried and tried  
We may not deserve you well come to serve you by and by  
Feed and water the horses  
Where they lie  
  
I miss the smell of ink on paper and its morning pull  
All the news comes via link now all so virtual  
I dont know what to think  
I dont know what to feel  
The beginning of the end or reinvention of the wheel  
  
And for all weve left undone  
We are still evolution  
  
I want to feed and water the horses  
The course is long and dry  
Cant do it alone oh no we cant although weve tried and tried and tried  
We may not deserve you well come to serve you by and by  
Feed and water the horses  
Where they lie  
  
I realize that the beast lie there in our plans  
Peacefully sleeping but faithfully keeping  
Theyre ready for the burden man  
  
But if you knew something peacefully sleeping  
Theyd take you to something faithfully keeping  
You are dying for your burden man theyre ready for the burden man  
  
Wouldnt you need it Wouldnt you need it  
Wouldnt you feed it Wouldnt you feed it  
Wouldnt you praise it evermore  
  
Feed and water the horses  
The course is long and dry  
Cant do it alone oh no we cant although weve tried and tried and tried  
We may not deserve you Well come to serve you by and by  
Feed and water the horses where they lie
