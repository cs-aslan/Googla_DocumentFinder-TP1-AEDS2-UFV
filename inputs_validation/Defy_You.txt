You may push me around  
But you cannot win  
You may throw me down  
But Ill rise again  
The more you say  
The more I defy you  
So get out of my face  
  
You cannot stop us  
You cannot bring us down  
Never give up  
We go on and on  
Youll never break us  
Never bring us down  
We are alive  
  
All my will  
All my strength  
Rip it out  
Start again  
  
The wind blows  
Ill lean into the wind  
My angle grows  
Ill use it to win  
The more you say  
The more I defy you  
So get out of my way  
  
Can you leave it all behind  
Can you leave it all behind  
Cause you cant go back  
You cant go back
