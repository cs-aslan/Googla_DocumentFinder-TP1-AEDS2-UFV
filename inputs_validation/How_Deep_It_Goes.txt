In the quiet afternoon you left and went down into town  
And I just watched the empty road behind you  
Where the fog lies kissing the mountainside  
You want to be sleeping deep inside  
Believing that the hungry world wont find you  
  
Well thats just fine thats just fine  
Youve got to believe and I dont know I dont know  
What I believe anymore  
Or whether to leave or whether to stay  
Or what I can say  
To make you know  
How deep it goes  
  
Somebody turned on the dirty blues  
I know you dont like the blues  
Cause the words are always the same  
And they kind of remind you  
Somebody turned the blues on me  
I dont like the blues cause I cant see  
Through the tears that come and make it hard to find you  
  
Come on down  
Come on down  
Youve got to come lay down here and say those things  
Those warm things right here in my ear  
The times that you had that water like wine  
So clean and so fine to make me know how deep it goes  
Well thats just fine thats just fine  
Youve got to believe and I dont know I dont know  
If I could leave anymore even though theres a scar  
Still fresh from the war dont think about it no more  
Letting new love flow  
How deep it goes
