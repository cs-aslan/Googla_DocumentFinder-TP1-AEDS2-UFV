N obokov is sunlicked now  
Upon the beach at Gruenwald  
Brilliant and naked just  
The way that authors looks  
  
Clare and Lady Manners drink  
Until the other cows go home  
Gossip till their lips are bleeding  
Politics and all  
  
Id rather be high Id rather be high  
Id rather be flying Id rather be flying  
Id rather be dead or out of my head  
Than training these guns on those men in the sand  
  
Id rather be high  
The Thames was black the tower dark  
I flew to Cairo find my regiment  
Citys full of generals  
And generals full of shit  
  
I stumble to the graveyard and I  
Lay down by my parents whisper  
Just remember duckies  
Everybody gets got  
  
Id rather be high Id rather be high  
Id rather be flying Id rather be flying  
Id rather be dead or out of my head  
Than training these guns of those men in the sand  
Id rather be high  
  
Im seventeen and my looks can prove it  
Im so afraid that I will lose it  
Id rather smoke and phone my ex  
Be pleading for some teenage sex yeah  
  
Id rather be high Id rather be high  
Id rather be flying Id rather be flying  
Id rather be dead or out of my head  
Than training these guns on the men in the sand  
  
Id rather be high Id rather be high  
Id rather be flying Id rather be flying  
Id rather be flying Id rather be high  
Id rather be flying
