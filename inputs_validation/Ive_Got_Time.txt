Words and music by bob seger  
  
I was born at the break of dawning  
In the last days of the last great war  
My father was not in the fighting  
And my mother never had to mourn  
  
I was raised raised and taught to hurry  
Ive been hurrying and worrying all my days  
But now as Im getting older  
I think Im learning how to run the race  
And with you by my side your heart close to mine  
Ive got time  
  
I used to wake up every morning  
And lie there far too long  
I had no reason for living  
Everything I did was wrong  
With you and your faith in me  
Oh how you made my whole life shine  
And Ive got time  
You and your faith in me  
Little girl you made my whole life shine  
And Ive got time
