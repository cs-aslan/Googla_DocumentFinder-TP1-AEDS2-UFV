You ask me the time of day  
I tell you I dont know  
In darkness Im light years away  
The voices come and go  
  
Save me all my life Ive been a liar  
Save me all my life Ive been a liar  
  
Burning bridges in the rain  
The crying embryo  
I seem so blissfully insane  
But still the pain wont go  
  
Save me all my life Ive been a liar  
Save me all my life Ive been a liar  
  
Sacred words the angles wait for me  
Theyll set me free  
But I cant see the jokes on me  
  
Babies crying other peoples tears  
And in thier eyes  
They have reflected wasted years  
  
You ask me who I really am  
I still say I dont know  
The doors have all been tightly slammed  
The poision seeds are sewn  
  
Save me all my life Ive been a liar  
Save me all my life Ive been a liar  
  
Dying angles falling from above  
Ive had enough  
I can not laugh the jokes on me  
Shattered dreams you can not realize  
Wont sympathize  
Its in your eyes  
Why cant you see  
Am I the liar  
Tell me whos the liar
