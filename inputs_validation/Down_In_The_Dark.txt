Baby youre going Down In The Dark  
Show my lonely night is fallen and I dont have very long  
Think I might of broke my boil  
Within my face might burn  
Youre gonna make it better for a little while  
  
Baby youre gonna die someday  
See you in your crowded wasted  then you start to fade  
That when we start singing faster  
I wouldnt wait so long  
Wont get any easier in the Dark  
  
Oh yeah yeah yeahh  
You Will You Will You Will
