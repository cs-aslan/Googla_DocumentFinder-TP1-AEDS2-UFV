If you think youre alone  
that youre the only one who is afraid  
Let me tell you I feel just like you do  
And sometimes I stand back  
From desires and dreams I dont understand  
They overwhelm me  
I feel just like you do  
  
Chorus  
I feel just like you do  
I feel just like you do  
Just like you do  
Just like you do  
I feel just like you do  
Just like you do  
I feel just like you do  
  
And when it comes to love  
You want me to be the one to say  
The words I love you  
But I feel just like you do  
But lets try to return  
To that brave innocence we once knew  
I wish you were an ocean  
So I could jump into you  
  
Chorus
