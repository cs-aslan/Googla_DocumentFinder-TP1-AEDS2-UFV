You better run You better run and run and run  
You better run You better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
You better run You better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
You stand before your maker  
In a state of shame  
Bacause your robes are covered in mud  
While your kneel at the feet  
Of a woman of the street  
The gutters will run with blood  
They will run with blood  
You better run you better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
You better run you better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
In the days of madness  
My brother my sister  
When youre dragged toward the Hellmouth  
You will beg at the end  
But there aint gonna be one friend  
For the grave will spew you out  
It will spew you out  
You better run you better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
You better run you better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
Youll be working in the darkness  
Against your fellow man  
And youll find youre called to come forth  
So youll scrub and youll scrub  
But the trouble is bud  
The blood it wont wash off  
No it wont come off  
You better run you better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
You better run you better run  
You better run and run and run  
You better run to the City of Refuge
