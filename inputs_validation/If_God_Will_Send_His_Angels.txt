Nobody else here baby  
No one here to blame  
No one to point the finger  
Its just you and me and the rain  
Its the blind leading the blond  
Its the stuff its the stuff of country songs  
If God will send his angels  
And if God will send a sign  
And if God will send his visions  
Would everything be alright  
God has got his phone off the hook babe  
Would he even pick up if he could  
Its been a while since we saw that child  
Hanging round this neighborhood  
You see his mother dealing in a doorway  
See Father Christmas with a begging bowl  
Jesus sisters eyes are a blister  
The High Street never looked so low  
Its the blind leading the blond  
Its the cops collecting for the cons  
If God will send his angels  
And if God will send a sign  
And if God will send his visions  
Where do we go  
Where do we go  
Jesus never let me down  
You know Jesus used to show me the score  
Then they put Jesus in show business  
Now its hard to get in the door  
Its the stuff its the stuff of country songs  
But I guess it was something to go on  
So where is the hope and where is the faith  
And the lovewhats that you say to me  
Does lovelight up your Christmas Tree  
The next minute your blowing a fuse  
And the cartoon network turns into the news  
If God will send his angels  
I sure could use them here right now  
Well if God would send his angels  
Where do we go  
I dont need to lie  
I dont need to know  
And I dont want to promise  
And I dont want to lie  
I just want to feel the song
