Every night and every day my heart feels the pain  
I wake up to the thought of you and I call your name  
No one ever made me feel the way you do  
Nothing in this world I wouldnt do for you  
But now Ive got to let go  
  
We dont stand a chance  
In this wild romance my tender heart  
Maybe its wiser to walk away and love again  
With my tender heart  
We dont stand a chance  
In this wild romance oh it hurts so bad  
Knowing that Im not the one you want  
I cant hold on to my tender heart  
  
I never thought Id be the one who would play the fool  
But I know love can feel so good and can be so cruel  
Its clear to me the writing is on the wall  
Its clear to me that you dont really love me at all  
And I cant go on this way  
  
We dont stand a chance  
In this wild romance my tender heart  
Maybe its wiser to walk away and love again  
With my tender heart  
We dont stand a chance  
In this wild romance oh it hurts so bad  
Knowing that Im not the one you want  
I cant hold on to my tender heart  
  
Im standing at the door  
Dont need this hurt no more  
Im crying out in vain  
Cause you dont feel my pain  
  
Maybe it was always going to be this way  
Maybe Ill look back and understand some day  
But now Ive got to say  
We dont stand a chance  
In this wild romance my tender heart  
Maybe its wiser to walk away and love again  
With my tender heart  
We dont stand a chance  
In this wild romance oh it hurts so bad  
Knowing that Im not the one you want  
I cant hold on to my tender heart  
My tender heart
