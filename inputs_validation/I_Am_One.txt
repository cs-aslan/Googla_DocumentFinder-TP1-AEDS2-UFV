Demolition missionman  
The old boy is hating me  
Ive become the one they warned me about  
Oh hes gonna die before me  
  
Long live long live long live the king of mercy  
Long live long live  
Is there no love I am one  
The side you see is the nasty me  
Oh I am one  
Love I am one  
I got something to prove  
And nothing to lose  
Oh I am one  
  
18 bloody roses each a year that bled my soul  
18 and numb Im somebodys son  
Mama look what Ive become  
  
Long live long live long live the king of mercy  
Long live long live  
Is there no love I am one  
The side you see is the nasty me  
Oh I am one  
Love I am one  
I got something to prove  
And nothing to lose  
Oh I am one  
  
Will he take me down to the gallows  
And kill the boy inside the man  
Im just a rock and roll nigger  
I know he dont know what I am  
  
I dont see my face in the mirror  
And more or understand  
Why am I the chosen one  
Im the crimson man  
Long live long live long live the king of mercy  
Long live long live  
Is there no love I am one  
The side you see is the nasty me
