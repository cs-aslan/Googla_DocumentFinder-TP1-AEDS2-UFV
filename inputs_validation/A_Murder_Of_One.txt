Blue morning Blue morning  
Wrapped in strands of fist and bone  
Curiosity Kitten doesnt have to mean youre on your own  
Your can look outside your window  
He doesnt have to know  
We can talk awhile baby  
We can take it nice and slow  
  
All your life is such a shame  
All your love is just a dream  
  
Are you happy where youre sleeping  
Does he keep you safe and warm  
Does he tell you when youre sorry  
Does he tell you when youre wrong  
Ive been watching you for hours  
Its been years since we were born  
We were perfect when we started  
Ive been wondering where weve gone  
  
All your life is such a shame  
All your love is just a dream  
  
I dreamt I saw you walking up a hillside in the snow  
Casting shadows on the winter sky as you stood there counting crows  
One for sorrow  
Two for joy  
Three for girls and four for boys  
Five for silver  
Six for gold and  
Seven for a secret never to be told  
  
Theres a bird that nests inside you  
Sleeping underneath your skin  
When you open up your wings to speak  
I wish youd let me in  
  
All your life is such a shame  
All your love is just a dream  
Open up your eyes  
You can see the flames  
of your wasted life  
You should be ashamed  
  
You dont want to waste your life  
  
I walk along these hillsides in the summer neath the sunshine  
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me
