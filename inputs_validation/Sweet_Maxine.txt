She can capture your heart  
When they start the music playin  
Sparkle in her eyes  
You better be wise or you will end up lose your mind  
I said baby pretty baby  
Got to get my hands on you  
Somethings got a hold on  
Somethings got a hold on  
Somethings got a hold on me  
She was born with it in her soul  
Lord she knows how to rock and roll  
  
Shes the answer to poor boys dream  
Never seen such a sweet young thing  
Shes a teaser love to squeeze her  
An actress from a fantasy scene  
I said baby pretty baby  
Open your eyes to the truth  
  
Shes got the power power in her soul  
Shes got the power rock and roll
