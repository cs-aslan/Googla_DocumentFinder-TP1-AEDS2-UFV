Met a girl in the parking lot  
And all I did was say hello  
Her pepper spray made it rather hard  
For me to walk her home  
But I guess thats the way it goes  
  
Chorus  
Tell me again was it love at first sight  
When I walked by and you caught my eye  
Didnt you know love could shine this bright  
Well smile because youre the deer in the headlights  
  
Met a girl with a graceful charm  
But when beauty met the beast he froze  
Got the sense I was not her type  
By a black eye and bloody nose  
But I guess thats the way it goes  
  
Chorus  
  
Its suffocating to say  
But the female mystique takes my breath away  
So give me a smile or give me a sneer  
Cause Im trying to guess here  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell me again was it love at first sight  
When I walked by and you caught my eye  
Didnt you know love could shine this bright  
If life was a game you would never play nice  
If love was a beam youd be blind in both eyes  
Put your sunglasses on cause youre a deer in the headlights  
  
Youre the deer in the headlights  
Youre the deer in the headlights
