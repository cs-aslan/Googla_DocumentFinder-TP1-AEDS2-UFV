Its like staring at the sky above  
When I look in your eyes  
Now where in the world did you come from  
Youre so beautiful and I know  
Oh I cant escape your love  
Escape your love escape your love  
I cant escape your love  
Escape your love escape your love  
Every time I turn around youre there  
I get a feeling that wont go away  
Nothing else in this whole world compares  
Youre surrounding me and I know  
That I cant escape your love  
Escape your love escape your love  
I cant escape your love  
Escape your love escape your love  
And in the righteous crowd  
Your face is all I see  
I hope you know by now  
That I just cant escape yeah  
Oh I cant escape your love  
Escape your love escape your love  
Oh I cant escape your love  
Escape your love escape your love  
Oh I cant escape your love  
Escape your love escape your love oh yeah yeah
