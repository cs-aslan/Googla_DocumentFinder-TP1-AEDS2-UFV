What in the fuck was that Kanye  
I told you to do some shit for the kids  
You can give me your motherfucking graduation ticket right now  
You will not walk across that stage you wont slide across that stage  
A motherfucker cant pull you across that stage Kanye  
Who told you see I told you to do something up lifting  
Im trying to get you out here with these white people and this how you gone
do me  
You know what us a nigga  
And I dont mean that in no nice way  
Had little kids sing about the shit the jokes on you  
You throw your mother hands in the air and wave goodbye to everybody  
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus  
Mother what you gone do now  
  
Im no longer confused but dont tell anybody  
Im about to break the rules but dont tell anybody  
I got something better than school but dont tell anybody  
My momma would kill me but dont anybody  
She wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody  
She aint walked in my shoes Im just not everybody
