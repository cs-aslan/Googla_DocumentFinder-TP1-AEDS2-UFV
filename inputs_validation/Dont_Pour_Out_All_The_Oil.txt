Verse  
Dont pour out all the oil  
It isnt very good for the soil  
Dont waste the only fuel that we have  
  
Chorus  
The lawnmower needs some gasoline  
And I need some for my camero  
Dont pour it down the driveway  
Not today or tomorrow  
I really wanna take a bath  
In the brown think sludge  
It looks pretty tasty  
It smells a lot like fudge  
  
Verse  
My pants are all brown  
Do you see my scary frown  
That means I probably want to pound on you  
  
Chorus  
The lawnmower needs some gasoline  
And I need some for my camero  
Dont pour it down the driveway  
Not today or tomorrow  
I really wanna take a bath  
In the brown think sludge  
It looks pretty tasty  
It smells a lot like fudge
