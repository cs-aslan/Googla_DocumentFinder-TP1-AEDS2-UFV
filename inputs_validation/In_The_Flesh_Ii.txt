So ya  
Thought ya  
Might like to  
Go to the show  
To feel that warm thrill of confusion  
That space cadet glow  
Ive got some bad news for you sunshine  
Pink isnt well he stayed back at the hotel  
And they sent us along as a surrogate band  
Were gonna find out where you fans really stand  
  
Are there any queers in the theater tonight  
Get them up against the wall  
Theres one in the spotlight he dont look right to me  
Get him up against the wall  
That one looks Jewish  
And that ones a coon  
Who let all of this riffraff into the room  
Theres one smoking a joint  
And another with spots  
If I had my way  
Id have all of you shot
