Drake  
I got my eyes on you  
Youre everything that I see  
I want your hot love emotion endlessly  
I cant get over you left your mark on me  
I want your hot love emotion endlessly  
Cause youre a good girl and you know it  
You act so different around me  
Cause youre a good girl and you know it  
I know exactly who you could be  
Just hold on were goin home  
Just hold on were goin home  
Its hard to do these things alone  
Just hold on were goin home home  
  
Jhene  
Whats up  
Been a minute since we kicked it  
You been caught up  
With these chicks and I dont get it youre a star love  
You shouldnt have to deal with that  
I never make you feel like that  
Cause I love me I love me enough for the both of us  
Thats why you trust me  
You been through more than most of us  
So what are you what are you what are you so afraid of  
Darlin you you give but you cannot take love  
  
Drake  
I needed to hear that I hate when youre submissive  
Passive aggressive when were texting I feel the distance  
I look around the peers that surround me these boys are trippin  
I like when money makes a difference but dont make you different  
Started realizin a couple places I could take it  
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement  
I want to take it deeper than money vacation  
And influence a generation thats lackin in patience  
Ive been dealin with my dad speakin of lack of patience  
Just me and my old man gettin back to basics  
Weve been talkin bout the future and time that we wasted  
When he put that bottle down girl that man is amazin  
Well we had a couple Coronas  
We might have rolled a white paper just somethin to hold us  
We even talked about you in our couple of moments  
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups  
You a flower child beautiful child Im in your zone  
Lookin like you came from the 70s on your own  
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is  
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone  
You dont even know what you want from love anymore  
I search for somethin Im missin it disappear when Im bored  
But girl what qualities was I lookin for before  
Who you settlin for Who better for you than the boy huh
