But theyre gonna get a surprise  
When she brings them to their knees

Theyve got tricks but my baby got wise  
So in case you havent heard the news

She doesnt like the rough guys  
So find some one you own size  
Cause shes not afraid of you

They think theyre full of fire  
She thinks theyre full of shit

Shes gonna call your bluff guys  
And you better believe its true
