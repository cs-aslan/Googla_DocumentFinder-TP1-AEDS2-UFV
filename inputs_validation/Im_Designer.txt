My generations for sale  
Beats a steady job  
How much have you got  
  
My generation dont trust no one  
Its hard to blame  
Not even ourselves  
  
The thing thats real for us is fortune and fame  
All the rest seems like work  
Its just like diamonds  
In shit  
  
Im high class Im a whore  
Actually both  
Basically Im a pro  
Weve all got our own style of baggage  
Why hump it yourself  
  
Youve made me an offer that I can refuse  
Cause either way I get screwed  
Counter proposal I go home and jerk off uh  
  
Its truly a lie  
I counterfeit myself  
Its truly a lie  
I counterfeit myself  
You dont own you dont own you dont own you dont own  
You dont own what none can buy  
You dont own  
You dont own  
Neither do I  
  
High and mighty you say selling out is a shame  
Is that the name of your book  
Push a silver spoon in your ass  
No more holding us  
Down dog down mutt nice mutt  
  
Youre insulted you cant be bought or sold  
Translation offer too low  
You dont know what youre worth  
It isnt much  
My pianos for sale  
How many times must I sell myself  
Before my pieces are gone  
Im one of a kind Im designer  
  
Never again will I repeat myself  
Enough is never enough  
Never again will I repeat myself  
  
It used to be the plan was screwing the man  
Now its have sex with a man  
After he buys your dotcom for sale at a low low price  
  
Its truly a lie  
I counterfeit myself  
Its truly a lie  
I counterfeit myself  
You dont own you dont own you dont own me  
You dont own what none can buy  
You dont own  
You dont own what none can buy  
Neither do I
