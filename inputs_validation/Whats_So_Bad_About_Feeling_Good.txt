Youre awake as dawn breaks another day  
And the gray clouds weep how you feel  
Oh but the way she touch you just brings you back to life  
Oh dont let them bury your soul in concrete and steel  
So whats so bad about feeling good  
Whats so bad whats so bad  
Whats so bad about feeling good  
Whats so bad whats so bad  
Why hold back when you know you should  
Break the chains of your life and start  
Feeling good I said feeling good  
As were walking home theres a whispering  
From the city lights to the stars  
And the way she move her body next to me  
In her hair I breathe the air of Venus and Mars  
So whats so bad about feeling good  
Whats so bad whats so bad  
Why hold back when you know you should  
Break the chains of your life and start feeling good  
Whats so bad about feeling good  
Break the chains of your life and start feeling good  
Dream on dream on  
If youre happy feeling sad  
Dream on dream on  
Bout the things you couldve had  
Then tell me what

Why hold back when you know you should  
Break the chains of your life and start
