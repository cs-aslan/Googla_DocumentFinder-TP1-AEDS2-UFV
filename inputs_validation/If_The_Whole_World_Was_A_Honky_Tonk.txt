If the whole world was a honkytonk  
And it revolved around an old jukebox  
Wed tell our troubles to the Bar  
Over cryin steel guitars  
And soon theyd all be gone  
Yeah if you asked me what I thought  
Id say Wed be better off  
If the whole world was a honkytonk  
  
You could smoke that cigarette  
An be politically incorrect  
Show off that red round your neck  
Not hear a single soul object  
Wouldnt need no lawyers to decide  
Who is wrong and who is right  
No need for big expensive trials  
Brother wed just step outside  
  
If the whole world was a honkytonk  
And it revolved around an old jukebox  
Wed tell our troubles to the Bar  
Over cryin steel guitars  
And soon theyd all be gone  
Yeah if you asked me what I thought  
Id say Wed be better off  
If the whole world was a honkytonk  
  
Wouldnt have to pay no tax  
Just set a tip jar in the back  
If we ran low wed pass the hat  
I bet wed all be in the black  
If the whole world was a honkytonk  
  
And if youre lookin love  
Someone to heal that broken heart  
Hey buddy youd be in half  
You wouldnt have to go that far  
  
If the whole world was a honkytonk  
And it revolved around an old jukebox  
Wed tell our troubles to the Bar  
Over cryin steel guitars  
And soon theyd all be gone  
If you asked me what I thought  
Id say Wed be better off  
If the whole world was a honkytonk  
  
Life would be a threechord song  
And the king would be George Jones  
If the whole world was a honkytonk
