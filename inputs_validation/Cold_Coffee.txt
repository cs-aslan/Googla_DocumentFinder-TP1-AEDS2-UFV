Shes like cold coffee in the morning  
Im drunk off last nights whisky and coke  
Shell make me shiver without warning  
And make me laugh as if Im in on the joke  
  
And you can stay with me forever  
Or you could stay with me for now  
  
Tell me if Im wrong  
Tell me if Im right  
Tell me if you need a loving hand  
To help you fall asleep tonight  
Tell me if I know  
Tell me if I do  
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to  
  
Ill wake with coffee in the morning  
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea  
Outside the day is up and calling  
But I dont have to be so please go back to sleep  
  
Stay with me forever  
Or you could stay with me for now  
  
Tell me if Im wrong  
Tell me if Im right  
Tell me if you need a loving hand  
To help you fall asleep tonight  
Tell me if I know  
Tell me if I do  
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to  
  
Cause I love the way you wake me up  
For goodness sake will my love not be enough  
  
Tell me if Im wrong  
Tell me if Im right  
Tell me if you need a loving hand  
To help you fall asleep tonight  
Tell me if I know  
Tell me if I do  
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to  
  
Tell me if Im wrong  
Tell me if Im right  
Tell me if you need a loving hand  
To help you fall asleep tonight
