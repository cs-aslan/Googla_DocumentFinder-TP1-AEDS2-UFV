Hey hey She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door  
You grow up quick when ya grow up poor  
Its the only way to LA that she knows  
The Hollywood pose teeth tits and toes  
Didnt take her long to leave the boulevard  
So many five star friends with black credit cards  
Shed try anything once cause anything goes  
It never comes easy when youre digging for gold  
  
Hey hey Well she aint no Cinderella when shes getting undressed  
Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
Chorus  
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap  
Thats why shes making six figures working three days a week  
Ya shed even break a promise in the promised land  
She didnt make it this far by just shakin hands  
Shell shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can  
She didnt make it this far by just shakin hands  
  
Hey hey I doubt shed even let the devil buy her little black book  
City Hall would probably fall if anyone got a look  
Every A list player is a favorite friend  
Says they all taste the same in the back of the Benz  
Her congressman will call her every once in a while  
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile  
Shes done everyone once and everyone knows  
You got to get a little dirty when youre digging for gold  
  
Hey hey Well she aint no Cinderella when shes getting undressed  
Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
Chorus  
  
Someone spilled the beans and now her names in the press  
Tough to keep it all a secret when youre one of the best  
The judge is going easy cause he paid for her chest  
Ya he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
Chorus  
  
Shell shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can  
She didnt make it this far by just shakin hands
