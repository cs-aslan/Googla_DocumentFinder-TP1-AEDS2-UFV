Yeah I said yeah  
I remember the first time  
That I ever seen her face  
I was standing by the drug store  
Tryin to save the human race  
  
Took a raincheck on a blind date  
To get her prescription filled  
We had a short talk and a long walk  
Through the lazy cottonfield  
  
It was hot  
She was cool and sultry  
We made love  
I was broke and lonely  
  
Shes wonderful so beautiful  
So delectable shes mine  
Shes desirable so lovable  
And its criminal almost illegal  
  
Well we woke up in a barnyard  
When I heard a farmer shout  
Get away boy from my daughter  
When a shotgun rang out  
We took off  
She was right behind me  
Ran like the wind  
What a crazy lady  
  
Shes fabulous so sensuous  
Shes marvelous shes mine  
Im delirious its serious  
Kinda dangerous almost illegal  
  
Bring it down now  
We had a one child by the springtime  
And another on the way  
I got a new life and a good wife  
Aint that amazing grace  
  
It was hot  
She was cool and sultry  
We made love  
I was broke and lonely  
  
Shes wonderful shes beautiful  
Shes desirable shes mine  
Im delirious shes serious  
Its kinda dangerous almost illegal  
Wonderful so beautiful  
Shes not a radical but shes mine  
Shes fabulous so sensuous  
And its marvelous almost illegal  
Beautiful and shes wonderful  
So desirable almost illegal
