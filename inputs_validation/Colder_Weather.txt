Shed trade Colorado if hed take her with him  
Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in  
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay  
Shes answered by the tail lights  
Shining through the window pane  
  
Chorus  
He said I wanna see you again  
But Im stuck in colder weather  
Maybe tomorrow will be better  
Can I call you then  
She said youre ramblin man  
You aint ever gonna change  
You gotta gypsy soul to blame  
And you were born for leavin  
  
At a truck stop diner just outside of Lincoln  
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin  
And in the waitress eyes he sees the same ol light shinin  
He thinks of Colorado  
And the girl he left behind  
  
He said I wanna see you again  
But Im stuck in colder weather  
Maybe tomorrow will be better  
Can I call you then  
She said youre ramblin man  
You aint ever gonna change  
You gotta gypsy soul to blame  
And you were born for leavin  
  
Born for leavin  
  
Well its a winding road  
When your in the lost and found  
Youre a lover Im a runner  
We go round n round  
And I love you but I leave you  
I dont want you but I need you  
You know its you who calls me back hey baby  
  
Oh I wanna see you again  
But Im stuck in colder weather  
Maybe tomorrow will be better  
Can I call you then  
Cause Im a ramblin man  
I aint ever gonna change  
I gotta gypsy soul  
And I was born for leavin born for leavin  
  
When I close my eyes I see you  
No matter where I am  
I can smell your perfume through these whispering pines  
Im with your ghost again  
Its a shame about the weather  
I know soon well be together  
And I cant wait til then  
I cant wait til then
