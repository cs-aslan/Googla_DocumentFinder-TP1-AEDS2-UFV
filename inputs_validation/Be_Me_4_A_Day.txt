So you wanna see in my life  
So watch but be careful  
I dont give no doubts  
But that its painful  
  
Be me 4 a day  
So you can understand my pain  
Whats it all about  
And Im not proud  
  
But thats how Ive survived  
Living in the shadows  
Walking only in nighttime  
Outside  
  
Be me 4 a day  
So you can see Im not doing well  
Sick and tired of this all  
But Im not gonna begg  
  
Be me 4  
Look how I live day by day  
Be me 4  
This is how Ive became of who I am  
Be me 4 a day  
So you can see by yourself  
Im not insane  
The press is not me my friend  
  
I give you this by an honour of Michael Who we all love so much
