I thought if I could be with you  
Maybe Id feel better  
But Im afraid I took advantage of your love  
I thought if youd just hold me tight  
Maybe Id forget her  
But I dont suppose as yet  
Youve held me tight enough  
Please hold me tighter  
I still remember  
Put your arms around me  
Hold me close hold me tight and long  
Please hold me tighter  
I still remember  
And I cant love again  
Until her memorys gone  
  
Please hold me tighter
