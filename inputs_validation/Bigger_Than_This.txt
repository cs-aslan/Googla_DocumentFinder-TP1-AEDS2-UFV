Rule Number Two  
Understanding what you have is bigger than this  
  
Feeling alone in the middle of the sea  
Thats what it feels like  
Two weeks later and youre still not talking to me  
  
Baby the energy it takes  
To act like Im not there  
We could be using that to make up  
But you dont even seem to care  
  
So let me try this again  
  
Im sorry for the wrong that I did  
Why cant we just get over it  
  
Say it right  
Were bigger than this  
Bigger than this stupid fight  
Baby girl were bigger than this  
Bigger than this  
  
Staying mad at me for eternity  
Whats that gonna be  
So baby girl try  
What we got is so much bigger than this  
Bigger Than This
