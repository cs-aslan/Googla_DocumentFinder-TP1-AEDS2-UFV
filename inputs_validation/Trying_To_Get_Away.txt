I been out on the road with my thumb in the air  
Im a long way from home but I just dont care  
The dust from the road makes it dry in my mouth  
When its cold up north thats when I head south  
  
cause I been tryin to tryin to get away yeah  
Tryin to tryin to get away yeah  
  
I passed through new york just the other day  
The smog was bad but not as bad as la  
Sometimes I wonder what the worlds comin to  
Sometimes I wonder what Im gonna do  
  
Chorus  
cause I been tryin to tryin to get away yeah  
I been tryin to tryin to get away yeah  
  
I been out on the road with my thumb in the air  
Im a long way from home but I just dont care  
The dust from the road makes it dry in my mouth  
When its cold up north thats when I head south  
  
Tryin to tryin to get away  
Tryin to tryin to get away  
Tryin to tryin to get away  
Tryin to tryin to get away  
  
Chorus  
  
cause I been tryin to tryin to get away yeah yeah yeah
