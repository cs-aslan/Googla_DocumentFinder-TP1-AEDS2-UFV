All that I need look at all the love weve found  
I wont run and pull the one jack move  
They love her for the Kingston sound  
  
FlavaFlave and ICE  
Once said something that made me  
Want to burn my liquor store down to the ground  
But I just cant leave the pad cuz Ill surely wind up dead  
Cuz I know there out there out there waiting and watching for me  
Still I got my yellow cat and my wooden baseball bat  
And my shiny silver gat and if my homey my back then I got  
  
All that I need look at all the love weve found  
I wont run and pull the one jack move  
They love her for the Kingston sound  
  
I wont slip and I wont trip Send Matt Vargas to regrip  
While Im wrenchin on my ride in that secret pad where we hide  
Theres always lotsa fun stuff to do  
Like relax and design a brand new tattoo  
Play with my crossword puzzle book Im even learning how to cook  
  
Have you seen that little whore Betty  
Someone said she stole my Freddie  
And if she made off with my last clean ring  
Im gonna kill that fuckin ditch pig  
So what  
Outta my outta my outta my outta my secret pad  
Cuz I know your talkin about me baby makin it hard to live  
Cause I dont want no money dick dont want no money down  
My secret tweaker pad is now the hottest pale spot in town I guess  
Take it nice and easy  
Dont want no sheriff breakin down the door to raid me  
  
All that I need look at all the love weve found  
I wont run and pull the one jack move  
They love her for the Kingston sound  
  
Baby you wanna give me kisses sweet  
Only for one night with no repeat  
Baby you wanna leave and never go  
But the taste of honey is worse than none at all
