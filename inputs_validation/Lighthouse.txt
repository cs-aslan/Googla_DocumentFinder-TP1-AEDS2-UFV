This kind of love  
Is more than a lifeline  
For a man as weak as me  
Who has no  
Self believe  
  
This kind of love  
Is more than amazing  
For a man who  
Lost his way  
Who thought it was too late  
  
How did the sea  
How did  
The sea  
How did the sea get so rough  
I wouldve drowned  
I wouldve  
Drowned  
If you hadnt given me your love  
  
Youre the light in the  
Dark  
Youre the seat in the park  
Youre the lighthouse  
Youre the  
Lighthouse  
That I need  
Youre the key to the door  
Youre the Port in the  
Storm  
And I need to find a shore  
When I cant swim anymore  
You always guide  
Me back to solid ground  
Youre my lighthouse  
  
This kind of love  
Is  
More than a feeling  
For a man who rarely cried  
I get all choked up each  
Time  
You say you love me  
You couldve walked away  
Couldve give my problems  
Back  
Couldve left  
  
You took the chance  
  
How did the  
Waves  
How did the waves  
How did the waves get so high  
I wouldve  
Died  
I wouldve died  
If you hadnt loved me just in  
Time  
  
Youre the light in the dark  
Youre the seat in the  
Park  
Youre the lighthouse  
Youre the lighthouse  
That I  
Need  
Youre the key to the door  
Youre the Port in the Storm  
When I need to  
Find a shore  
Cos I cant swim anymore  
You always guide me back to solid  
Ground  
Youre my lighthouse  
  
Yeah I owe it all to you everything I have  
Right now  
I owe it all to you everything I didnt have you found  
Everytime take me  
Back to you  
  
Youre the light in the dark  
Youre the seat in the  
Park  
Youre the lighthouse  
Youre the lighthouse  
I need  
Youre the  
Key to the door  
Youre the Port in the Storm  
And I need to find the shore  
Cos  
I cant swim anymore  
You always guide me back to solid ground  
Youre my  
Lighthouse
