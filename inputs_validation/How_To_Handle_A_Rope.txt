Too late to think or filter anymore  
A bitter pill to swallow  
Maybe youre in a blanket haze of ephedrine  
Im wonderin where the hell you been  
So come on and right this wrong the rope  
  
You got it all right  
You got a feeling  
Id rather open up my wrist let it go  
You got it all right  
You got a feeling  
Cause devils and ropes around your neck  
Cursing them all  
And you cant hear it  
Cant hear it  
  
Aint got a mind to deal with anymore  
Saboteur infiltrator and maybe more  
If youre not blind and deaf how can we pollute your head  
So come on and right this wrong the rope  
  
And I got it all right  
I got a feeling  
Youd rather open up your wrist and let it go  
I got it all right yeah  
I got a feeling  
Cause devils and ropes around my neck cant even know  
Cause they cant hear it  
Cant hear it  
Cant hear it  
Cant hear it
