Last night when I went to bed  
With tangled hair upon my head  
In every way I really was a kid  
It happened without warning  
When I woke up in the morning  
I cant tell you just what happened but it did  
  
I grew six inches in one day  
Its painful when it goes that way  
And now my skinny bodys really achin  
And my skin just exploded  
With an inch of oil its loaded  
Its so greasy you could fry a pound of bacon  
  
My voice is changing  
Out of thin air  
And body parts that once were smooth  
Are growing bits of hair  
My voice is changing  
What does it mean  
I guess Ill be a real man  
Before I turn 13  
  
I buy two pairs of jeans a week  
Im such a tall and awkward geek  
I fall down when I try to play a grounder  
At dinner every night I eat  
A giant heaping plate of meat  
Then go out with my friends for quarter pounders  
  
And weird emotions come alive  
My hormones are in overdrive  
Ive turned into a girlwatching creature  
And all my friends their marks are shot  
But they dont care because theyre hot  
For Mrs Smith the mathematics teacher  
  
My voice is changing  
I hate to hear it crack  
I pray to God I wont inherit  
Dads hairy back  
My voice is changing  
When will it end  
And when will mom stop kissing me  
In front of all my friends  
  
Pretty soon I bet Ill  
Be right into heavy metal  
But my parents say at least it isnt rap  
Ill start wearing stupid clothes  
And threaten that Ill pierce my nose  
And tell my parents all they like is crap  
  
The first girl that I ever kiss  
Will be the one and who could miss  
Our love forever written in the stars  
But I dont think our love will last  
Unless the four years go by fast  
Till I can use the backseat of the car  
  
My voice is changing  
Out of thin air  
And body parts that once were smooth  
Are growing bits of hair  
My voice is changing  
What does it mean  
I guess Ill be a real man  
Before I turn 13  
  
My voice is changing  
I hate to hear it crack  
I pray to God I wont inherit  
Dads hairy back  
My voice is changing  
When will it end  
And when will mom stop kissing me  
In front of all my friends  
  
Chachacha
