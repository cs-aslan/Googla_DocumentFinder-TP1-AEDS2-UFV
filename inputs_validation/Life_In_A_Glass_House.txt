Once again Im in trouble with my only friend  
She is papering the window panes  
She is putting on a smile  
Living in a glass house  
  
Once again packed like frozen food and battery hens  
Think of all the starving millions  
Dont talk politics and dont throw stones  
Your royal highnesss  
  
Well of course Id like to sit around and chat  
Well of course Id like to stay and chew the fat  
Well of course Id like to sit around and chat  
But someones listening in  
  
Once again we are hungry for a lynching  
Thats a strange mistake to make  
You should turn the other cheek  
Living in a glass house  
  
Well of course Id like to sit around and chat  
Well of course Id like to stay and chew the fat  
Well of course Id like to sit around and chat  
Only only only only only only only only only only  
Theres someone listening in
