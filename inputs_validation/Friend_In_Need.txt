Hey buddy I want to talk to you  
About I got a friend in need a friend indeed  
I hear you got a few friends too  
Living up the stairs selling their wears  
And they dont care cause they dont know that  
  
Oooh hes very lonely  
Oooh hes lost his one and only  
Woman that hes ever had  
He sure feels bad can you make him glad  
Hey mister can you help him out  
Can you put him straight before it gets to late  
And show what its all about  
  
Hey mister where you got the dope  
Which way will it be to pay the fee  
I guess that you can see through me  
So Ill be straight with you Ill tell the truth  
Friend in need is just really me
