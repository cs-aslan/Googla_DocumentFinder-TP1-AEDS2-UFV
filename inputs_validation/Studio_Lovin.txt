Girl let me take you to my studio  
Give you everything you want and need  
Lay you flat like a piano  
If you let me stroke your keys  
You going be saying things you never said  
Matter fact you going be playing melodies you never played  
We aint in no bed  
We in the lab  
And Im reclining in my seat  
You can just climb on top of me and ride me like this beat  
You say you need this loving  
Well Imma grab your waste line  
And if you like it deep  
I could hit you with that baseline  
I aint tryin to waste time  
For me and your sake  
Plus Im payin for this session  
I need more than one take  
I make the boards shake like how Im suppose to  
Ill have you sounding good  
Lil ma I got them pro tunes  
Now you in the mood  
I got you doing this and tryin that  
Beating in your drum  
While Im playing with your high hat  
You like that  
So you dont want to I just make you do it  
Got you in love  
Cause when we fuck its like we making music go n lose it  
  
I dont want to be unusual  
But theres a lot of things that I can see me doing to you  
Up in my studio oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yea  
You say you probably work tomorrow you can make it though  
And even thought theres probably other places we can go  
We in my studio oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yea  
  
And no it aint gon stop  
I keep this song on replay  
Puttin all them scratches on my back  
Im like go DJ  
Be my guitar  
Ill pluck your gstring  
Pull it to the side  
Imma make them vocals drop  
Im grippin on your thighs  
We tangled like some cables  
From the front look in your eyes  
Then I turn you like some pables  
No you fiendin for this loving  
Thats what you gon get  
And I cant singbut I see you  
And know Im gon hit yea  
Lets do the verses now  
Worry about the beat later  
Heard you be going off that head  
You dont need paper  
Play you an emajor aminor  
Girl your rhythm straight  
And I say you got great timing  
Feel your heart rate climbing  
Like when my speakers quake  
More than a qruayer straight  
You got that 8oa  
You say you cant  
But I do something that just make you do it  
Me and you dont fuck  
We make music yea  
  
I dont want to be unusual  
But theres a lot of things that I can see me doing to you  
Up in my studio oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yea  
You say you probably work tomorrow you can make it though  
And even thought theres probably other places we can go  
We in my studio oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yea
