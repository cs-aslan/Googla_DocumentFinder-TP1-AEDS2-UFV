Take the ribbons from your hair shake em loose and let em fall  
Let em fall against your chin like the shadows on the wall  
Come and lay down by my side till the early morning light  
All Im taking is your time help me make it through the night  
  
Well I dont care whos right or wrong and I wont try to understand  
Let the devil take tomorrow cause tonight I need a friend  
Yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrows out of sight  
And its sad to be alone help me make it through the night  
  
Well I dont care whos right or wrong  
I cant stand to be alone help me make it through the night
