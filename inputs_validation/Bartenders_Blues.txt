Im just a bartender  
I dont like my work  
I dont mind the money at all  
I see lots of sad faces  
And lots of bad cases  
Of folks with their backs to the wall  
  
I need four walls around me to hold my life  
To keep me from going astray  
A honkytonk angel to hold me tight  
To keep me from slipping away  
  
I can light up your smokes  
And Ill laugh at your jokes  
And Ill watch you fall down on your knees  
Close down this bar  
Gas up my car  
Pack up and mail in my key  
  
I need four walls around me to hold my life  
To keep me from going astray  
A honkytonk angel to hold me tight  
To keep me from slipping away  
  
The smoke fills the air  
In this honkytonk bar  
And Im thinking about where Id rather be  
Yeah  
But I sunk all my bridges  
I burned all my boats  
Im stranded at the edge of the sea  
Yeah  
  
I need four walls around me to hold my life  
To keep me from going astray  
A honkytonk angel to hold me tight  
To keep me from slipping away  
  
I need four walls around me to hold my life  
To keep me from going astray  
A honkytonk angel to hold me tight  
To keep me from slipping away
