Theres a madman in the corner of  
Your eye  
He likes to pry into your sunlight  
He wants to burst into the street  
With you and I  
A world of shadows and of rain  
Hes seen what love is  
He wants to pay you back with guilt  
  
He lies to you he wont let you be  
Hes got your chains of misery  
He wont be still till hes turned your key  
He holds your chains of misery  
  
Theres a prophet in the gutter  
In the street  
He say youre damned  
And you believe him  
Hes got a vision but it shines out  
Through your eyes  
A world of hatred and fear  
Hes felt what love means  
He wants to pay you back with pain  
  
He lies to you he wont let you be  
Hes got your chains of misery  
He wont be still till hes turned the key  
He holds your chains of misery  
  
Its only love that holds the key to  
Our hearts  
Its only love  
  
He lies to you he wont let you be  
Hes got your chains of misery  
He wont be still till hes turned the key  
He holds your chains of misery  
  
He lies to you he wont let you be  
Hes got your chains of misery  
He wont be still till hes turned the key  
He holds your chains of misery
