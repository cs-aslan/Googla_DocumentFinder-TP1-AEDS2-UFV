She knows that Ive been doing something wrong  
But she wont say anything  
She thinks that I was with my friends yesterday  
But she wont mind me lying  
Because  
  
Mother stands for comfort  
Mother will hide the murderer  
  
It breaks the cage and fear escapes and takes possession  
Just like a crowd rioting inside  
Make me do this make me do that make me do this make me do that  
Am I the cat that takes the bird  
To her the hunted not the hunter  
  
Mother stands for comfort  
Mother will hide the murderer  
Mother hides the madman  
Mother will stay mum  
  
Mother stands for comfort  
Mother will hide the murderer  
Mother hides the madman  
Mother will stay mum
