Hes just a loner  
He never says hello  
A friend to no one  
Hes got no place to go  
  
He dont look happy  
He look through furtive eyes  
He aint got nothing  
No one to sympathize  
Alright now  
  
He hides himself away  
His secrets not revealed  
As life just passes by he keeps himself concealed  
  
A solitary man  
An enigmatic child  
A riddle never solved  
A prisoner exiled  
Alright now  
  
I wonder if the loner can assimilate  
A life less lived alone plays devils advocate  
Cmon now  
  
Has he ever tried to be happy  
Reached out from inside  
Someone on who he can depend  
Its getting to late to recover  
He wont stand a chance and into his own hell hell descend  
Dont descend  
Dont descend  
Dont descend  
Dont descend  
  
No understanding of things we already know  
He has to live his life and just learn how to let go  
Alright yeah  
  
Communications an impossibility  
His own best friend but hes his own worst enemy  
The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head  
I wonder if he will be happy when hes dead  
Cmon yeah
