Its too darn hot  
Its too darn hot  
I like to sup with my baby tonight  
Refill the cup with my baby tonight  
I like to sup with my baby tonight  
Refill the cup with my baby tonight  
But I aint up to my baby tonight  
Cause its too darn hot  
  
Its too darn hot  
Its just too darn hot  
I like to coo with my baby tonight  
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight  
I like to coo with my baby tonight  
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight  
But brother you fight my baby tonight  
Cause its too darn hot  
  
According to the Kinsey report  
Every average man you know  
Much prefers his lovey dovey to court  
When the temperature is low  
But when the thermometer goes way up  
And the weather is sizzling hot  
Mr Pants for romance is not  
Because its too darn hot too hot  
Its too darn hot  
Its too darn hot  
  
Oh its too darn hot  
Its too darn hot  
I like to coo with my baby tonight  
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight  
I like to coo with my baby tonight  
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight  
But brother you fight my baby tonight  
Cause its too darn hot  
  
Mr Gob for his squab  
A marine for his queen  
A gi for his cutiepie is not  
Oh its too darn hot  
Its too darn hot  
Its too darn hot  
I gotta get the heat down  
Gotta get the heat down
