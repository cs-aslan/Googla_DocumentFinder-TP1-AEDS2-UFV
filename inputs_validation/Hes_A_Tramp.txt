Hes a tramp but they love him  
Breaks a new heart every day  
Hes a tramp they adore him  
And I only hope hell stay that way  
Hes a tramp hes a scoundrel  
Hes a rounder hes a cad  
Hes a tramp but I love him  
Yes even I have got it pretty bad  
You can never tell when hell show up  
He gives you plenty of trouble  
I guess hes just a no account pup  
But I wish that he were double  
Hes a tramp hes a rover  
And theres nothing more to say  
If hes a tramp hes a good one  
And I wish that I could travel his way  
You can never tell when hell show up  
He gives you plenty of trouble  
I guess hes just a no account pup  
But I wish that he were double  
Hes a tramp hes a rover  
And theres nothing more to say  
If hes a tramp hes a good one  
And I wish that I could travel his way  
I wish that I could travel his way  
What a dog
