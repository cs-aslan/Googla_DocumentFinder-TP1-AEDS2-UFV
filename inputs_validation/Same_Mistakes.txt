Verse  
Can I can I save you from you  
Cause you know theres something missing  
And that champagne youve been sippins not supposed to make you different all

Its starting to feel like the wrong thing to do yeah  
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen  
To the things that I must say to make you mine  
But live girl have some fun girl well be fine  
Trying to convince myself Ive found one  
Making a mistake I never learned from

Tell me why I always fall for your type for your type

Oh you dance dance like how like ballet and shit  
Oh wait No I get it girl Im with it

Its feeling like the second chance and its the first impression  
And I heard its nothing new except for someone new  
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you  
Talking to myself but I never listen  
Cause man its been a while and I swear that this ones different  
Thats why Imma take you anywhere you wanna go  
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about  
How reckless I have been  
And Im slowly running out of all the time that I invest in  
Making all the same mistakes  
And I swear Im just trying to correct it  
And I fall
