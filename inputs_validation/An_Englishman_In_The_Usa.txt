Leo Sayer and Les Davidson  
Rambling round your city streets  
I feel no earth beneath my feet  
And I feel my life  
  
Is crumbling into into the sea  
But I cant swim  
Three thousand miles  
So all I have is lonely nights  
  
Im an Englishman  
Lost in the USA  
And its a long way back home  
Such a long way back home  
  
And Im wondering  
Where am I gonna go  
Lines dead  operators gone  
And now the fear is coming on  
  
And I hear my love  
Wondering where have I gone  
So Im gambling bucks for pounds  
Yeah but lady luck  
  
Just wont come around  
For an Englishman  
Who is stuck in the USA  
And its a long way back home  
  
Such a long way back home  
And Im wondering  
Will I ever get away  
So here I am and there are you  
  
Where wishful thoughts  
Dont serve no use  
And all the worrying in the world  
Wont pull me through  
  
So I think of love that  
Might have been  
And an airline ticket  
Thats like a dream  
  
For an Englishman  
Who is lost in the USA  
Such a long way back home  
Such a long way back home  
  
And Im wondering  
Will I ever get to go  
And Im waiting for you  
To take me home
