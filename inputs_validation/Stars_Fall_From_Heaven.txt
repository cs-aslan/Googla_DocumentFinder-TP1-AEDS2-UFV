  
  
Its cold outside  
And the moon is bright  
And Im all alone tonight  
If I was a star  
That shined so bright  
Id shine my love to you  
  
Its not the words you say  
Neither the way theyre said  
And its not the things you do  
That make me want to fly  
Oh baby  
  
When a star falls from heaven  
Dont ask me why  
When a star falls from heaven  
It just makes me cry  
  
When stars fall from heaven  
I dont know why  
When stars fall from heaven  
Gonna see me cry  
  
Its cold outside  
Its dar out here  
Youre far and Im alone  
The stars shine bright  
As the tears roll down  
My burning cheeks as I cry  
  
Its not the words you say  
Neither the way theyre said  
And its not the things you do  
That make me want to fly  
Oh baby  
  
When stars fall   
Hey hey hey hey yeah
