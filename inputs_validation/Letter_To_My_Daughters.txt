Im sending this letter  
Ill mail it today  
Theres so many things Ive been wanting to say  
Your mom sent some pictures  
And my how youve grown  
Rock n roll fathers are never at home  
Im writing this letter  
  
I made you a song  
I promised your mom that Id write while Im gone  
You say daddy come home  
Well youll just have to wait  
  
I hope when I get there that it wont be too late  
Skylar I just missed your first step today  
I have no excuses and nothing to say  
I live on a bus with a rock n roll band  
I hope when your older that youll understand  
  
Im coming home soon  
This tours almost through  
I promise Ill try to spend more time with you  
You say daddy come home  
Youll just have to wait  
  
I hope when I get there that it wont be too late  
Now Madison Blue you know I love you too  
Not a single day passes that I dont think of you  
Im running on empty and a mountain so high  
I can pull out your pictures and look in your eyes  
I long for the day when your old man comes home  
It kills me to hear you say daddy dont go  
  
You say daddy come home  
Youll just have to wait  
I hope when I get there that it wont be too late  
Daddys at work now hes trying to pay bills  
Egos and assholes are part of my deal  
I make some money and I have some fun  
The tax man he cometh and Im back to square one  
  
Dont worry bout your daddy  
You girls be good  
Give a kiss to your mother  
I sure wish I could  
This life has its moments  
Im not always sad  
Take care and I love you  
Your rock n roll dad
