Baby seasons change but people dont  
And Ill always be waiting in the back room  
Im boring but overcompensate with  
Headlines and flash flash flash photography  
  
But dont pretend you ever forgot about me  
Dont pretend you ever forgot about me  
Wouldnt you rather be a widow than a divorcee  
Style your wake for fashion magazines  
Widow or a divorcee  
Dont pretend it dont pretend  
  
We dont fight fair  
We dont fight fair  
  
They say your head could be your prison  
Then these are just conjugal visits  
People will dissect us till this doesnt mean a thing anymore  
Dont pretend you ever forgot about me  
Dont pretend you ever forgot about me  
  
Wouldnt you rather be a widow than a divorcee  
Style your wake for fashion magazines  
Widow or a divorcee  
Dont pretend it dont pretend  
  
We do it in the dark  
With smiles on our faces  
Were dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We do it in the dark  
With smiles on our faces  
Were dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We dont fight fair  
We dont fight fair  
We dont fight fair  
We dont fight fair  
We dont fight fair  
  
We do it in the dark  
With smiles on our faces  
Were dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We do it in the dark  
With smiles on our faces  
Were dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We dont fight fair  
With smiles on our faces  
Were dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We dont fight fair  
  
Dont pretend you ever forgot about me  
We dont fight fair  
Dont pretend you ever forgot about me  
We dont fight fair
