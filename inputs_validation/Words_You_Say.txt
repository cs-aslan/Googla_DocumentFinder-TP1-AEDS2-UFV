Words you say to me  
I listen in sympathy  
But I dont know what it is  
That makes me ignore you  
I hear you every night  
I listen but the words dont seem right  
My mind seems somewhere else  
What else can I tell you  
I dont know what to do  
Im losing you  
Something I cant control  
You are in my heart and soul  
I dont want to wake up now  
I dont want to wake up now  
I dont want to wake up now  
I dont want to wake up now  
Words you say to me  
Im living in fantasy  
If I dont know what it is  
I simply ignore you  
I hear you every night  
I listen but the time is never right  
My life is so confused  
What more can I tell you  
Dont turn and walk away  
Dont leave this way  
Something I cant control  
You are in my heart and soul  
I dont want to wake up now  
I dont want to wake up now  
I dont want to wake up now  
I dont want to wake up now
