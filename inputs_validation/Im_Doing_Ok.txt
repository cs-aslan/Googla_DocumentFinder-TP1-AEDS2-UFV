Comin outta my shell and I been doin alright  
No more crowdin my days and no more hauntin my nights  
  
Had me in a state of shock couldnt believe it  
She had me weezin she was the air I was breathin and it  
Had me in a state of shock I caught her creepin  
She was my reason for beein and she was cheatin  
But Im okay  
  
Outta my sight outta my mind outta my head outta my way  
Im doin okay I said Im doin okay
