Verse 2 Offset  
I got bombs no Osama  
President rollie Obama  
Forty pornos  
You can see my diamonds  
From cross the corner  
Death before dishonor  
Middle finger fuck the your honor  
Concrete jungle  
If you fumble  
Eat you up like piranhas  
Who the hell  
Said I wont pull out that chopper  
And aim it at your turtle shell  
I know that you snitching  
You a informant for 12  
My niggas they trained to kill  
We got bananas  
You know they gone peel
