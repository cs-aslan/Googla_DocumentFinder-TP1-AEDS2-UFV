Run run run  
Run run run  
Run run run  
Run run run  
  
Well baby better take my advice  
A black cat crossed your path twice  
The moon came out next to the 1  
Then you opened your umbrella in a room  
  
Chorus  
You better run run run  
Run run run  
Run run run  
Run run run  
  
Well you aint the luckiest girl I know  
And you wont get luckier the way youre going  
Your horseshoes rusty and your mirrors cracked  
You walk under ladders then you walk right back  
  
Chorus  
  
When you dropped that little pin  
Never thought what a mess itd get you in  
Little pin little pin bring me luck  
Because I stopped to pick you up  
  
Chorus  
  
Well now little girl Im helping you  
I hope you believe what I say is true  
Whenever you run Ill be running too  
Whenever you run Ill be following you  
  
Chorus  
  
Run run run
