What happen to Nobody does it better  
  
See ya walking round like you were born to kill  
Driving in your Escalade flash that golden grill  
Youre pickin up a bad habit you get the ones that no one will  
Where did your love go babe before you turn criminal  
  
You act like youre gonna live forever  
What happen to no one does it better than you babe  
You babe  
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way  
  
So here we are there we go and thats the way  
That you gonna roll that you gonna fight gonna play  
It doesnt really matter to me that you found your way  
Youve been gone for so long that youre a shell of yourself babe  
  
You act like youre gonna live forever  
What happen to no one does it better than you babe  
You babe  
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way  
  
Theres someone child for you  
Ive changed my mind for you  
Your golden day has turned to night  
Your golden day has been tonight  
  
Theres no more chances for you now you never learn  
You live on fire baby but I just got burned  
  
You act like youre gonna live forever  
What happen to no one does it better than you babe  
You babe  
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way  
  
You act like youre gonna live forever  
What happen to no one does it better than you babe  
You babe  
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way
