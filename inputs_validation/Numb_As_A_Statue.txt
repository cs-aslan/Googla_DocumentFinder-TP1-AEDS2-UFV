Im numb as a statue  
I may have to beg borrow or steal  
Some feelings from you  
So I can have some feelings too  
  
Im pale as a ghost  
You know what I love about you  
Thats what I need the most  
Im gonna beg borrow or steal  
Some feelings from you  
Im gonna beg borrow or steal  
So I can have some feelings too  
  
I dont care if its superficial  
You dont have to dig down deep  
Just bring enough for the ritual  
Get here before I fall asleep  
  
Aint nothing special  
When the present meets the past  
Ive always taken care of business  
Ive paid my first and last
