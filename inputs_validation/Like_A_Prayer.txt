Life is a mystery everyone must stand alone  
I hear you call my name and it feels like  
Home  
  
When you call my name its like a little  
Prayer Im down on my knees I wanna take you there  
In the midnight hour I can feel your power  
Just like a prayer you know Ill take you there  
  
I hear your voice its like an angel sighing  
I have no choice I hear your voice feels like flying  
I close my eyes oh God I think Im falling  
Out of the sky I close my eyes  
Heaven help me  
  
When you call my name its like a little  
Prayer Im down on my knees I wanna take you there  
In the midnight hour I can feel your power  
Just like a prayer  
You know Ill take you there  
  
Like a child you whisper softly to me  
Youre In control just like a child now Im dancing  
Its like a dream no end and no beginning  
Youre here with me its like a dream  
Let the choir sing  
  
When you call my name its like a little  
Prayer Im down on my knees I wanna take you there  
In the midnight hour I can feel your power  
Just like a prayer  
You know Ill take you there  
Repeat  
  
Oooh ohhh Ohhh  
Life is a mystery everyone must stand alone  
I hear you call my name and it feels like home  
  
Just like a prayer your voice can take me there  
Just like a muse to me you are a mystery  
Just like a dream you are not what you seem  
Just like a prayer no choice  
Your voice can take me there  
  
Just like a prayer Ill take you there  
Its Like a dream to me  
Repeat  
  
Life is a mystery everyone must stand alone  
I hear you call my name and it feels like home  
  
Just like a prayer your voice can take me there  
Just like a muse to me you are a mystery  
Just like a dream you are not what you seem  
Just like a prayer no choice  
Your voice can take me there  
Just like a prayer your voice can take me there  
  
Just like a dream you are not what you seem  
Just like a prayer no choice  
Your voice can take me there
