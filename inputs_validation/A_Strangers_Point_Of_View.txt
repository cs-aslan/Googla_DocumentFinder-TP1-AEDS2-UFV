I never saw a single tear if she cried it would never show  
Maybe she was lonely I didnt take the time to know  
I never thought Id see the day Id miss her like I do  
Until the day I saw her from a strangers point of view  
  
She never even noticed me If she did she wouldnt say  
But she never looked so lovely as when she turned and walked away  
Now someone else is holdin her just like I used to do  
I can see it all so clearly now from a strangers point of view  
  
This strangers eyes cant take the pain of seeing her like this  
This strangers eyes cant overlook everything I missed  
I never thought Id see the day Id miss her like I do  
Until the day I looked at her from a strangers point of view
