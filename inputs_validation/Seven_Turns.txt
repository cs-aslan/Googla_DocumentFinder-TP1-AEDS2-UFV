Seven turns on the highway  
Seven rivers to cross  
Sometimes you feel like you could fly away  
Sometimes you get lost  
  
And sometimes in the darkened night  
You see the crossroad sign  
One way is the mornin light  
You got to make up your mind  
  
Somebodys callin your name  
Somebodys waiting for you  
Love is all that remains the same  
Thats what its all comin to  
Hey yeah  
  
Runnin wild out on the road  
Just like a leaf on the wind  
How in the world could you ever know  
Wed ever meet again  
  
Seven turns on the highway  
Seven rivers to cross  
Sometimes you feel like you could fly away  
Sometimes you get lost  
  
Somebodys callin your name  
Somebodys waitin for you  
Love is all that remains the same  
Thats what its all comin to  
  
Somebodys callin your name  
Somebodys waitin for you  
Love is all that remains the same  
Thats what its all comin to  
  
Somebodys callin your name  
Somebodys waitin for you  
Somebodys callin your name  
Thats what its all coming to
