Look at them now  
What do they want  
And what do they do now  
Nothing at all  
  
What do they know  
What do they think  
And who do they tell  
Well no one at all  
  
Lives are truly meaningless  
And we are busy being blessed  
  
With that we can take and pocket  
No one needs to know  
Were is the plug and theyre the socket  
Give us the juice and well go  
  
Cant you hear the choir now  
Listen to the animals sing  
Cant you hear the slaughterhouse bells  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king  
  
How do they sleep  
Their lives are so tart  
Bring me the trash collectors  
Cause theyre nothing but trash  
  
What do you expect  
Theyve got no standards  
So we lower the bar  
Cause theyre waiting for us  
  
Well open up Pandoras Box  
Pandora gave her keys and locks  
  
Theyre the big dogs waiting for their mother  
Come to the confessional  
So I can tell you all to bugger off  
Theres no time like now  
  
Cant you hear the choir now  
Listen to the animals sing  
Cant you hear the slaughterhouse bells  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king  
  
Cant you hear the choir now  
Listen to the marketplace sing  
Cant you hear the slaughterhouse bells  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king  
  
And well do it our way  
Its our time to play  
We know what to say  
They stand in our way  
Dont stand in our way  
No time like today  
  
Cant you hear the choir now  
Listen to the anthems we sing  
Cant you hear the slaughterhouse bells  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king  
  
Cant you hear the choir now  
Listen to the animals sing  
Cant you hear the slaughterhouse bells  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king  
  
Cant you hear the choir now  
Listen to the chosen ones sing  
Cant you hear the slaughterhouse bells  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king  
In the land of the pigs the butcher is king
