You havent seen the world outside for days  
You sleep you hope you wait  
Imagination disappears  
And all the dreams you have you save  
Confrontation like a mirror  
They try to take your mind away  
  
I dont know but I believe in yesterday  
And what it means  
To bleed and know that youre okay  
  
Are you waiting  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
No matter what Im always right there behind you Repeat x2  
  
Bombarded by the atmosphere  
You breath you choke you breath again  
Conversation disappears  
You realize theyre not your friends  
The panic of the future rears  
You dig you jerk  
You find another way  
  
I dont know but I believe in yesterday  
And what it means  
To bleed and know that youre okay  
  
Are you waiting  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
No matter what Im always right there behind you  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
No matter what Im always right there behind you  
  
You open up my veins now I dont feel the same  
No no no  
You open up my brain but I wont be replaced  
  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
No matter what Im always right there behind you
