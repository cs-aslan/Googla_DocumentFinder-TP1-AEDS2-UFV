I grabbed that telephone  
I thought we were alone  
Telling me theres company  
Your husbands comin home  
Ive been thinking about this Saturday night with you  
Ive been thinking about it all week long  
And now Im gonna lose it cause that  
Sonofabitch got me singin that same old song  
Got one foot out the door  
Tryin to hit the road  
Aint no match for your mean old man  
I think its time to roll  
Got one foot out the door  
Got one foot out the door  
Think Im gonna fight him  
Dont you let him put down  
Put that to the floor  
Put the pedal to the metal  
And you beat it out of town  
No comin back back for more
