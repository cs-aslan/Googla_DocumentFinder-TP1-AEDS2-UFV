Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah its about the time wed like to present you to the electric church  
And baby if you would you all listen to our notes  
Here here in our seens playin  
Instead of rappin like I am now  
Then maybe Ill well maybe this is good enough  
What ya think we stick with songs  
Its all freedom  
  
Theres a red house over yonder baby  
Thats where my baby stays  
Lord theres a red house over yonder baby  
Lord thats where my baby stays  
  
I aint been home to see my baby  
In about a ninetynine and one half days  
Its about time to see her  
Wait minute somethings wrong babe  
Lord have mercy this key wont unlock this door  
  
Wait a minute somethings wrong  
Wait a minute somethings wrong baby  
Wait a minute somethings wrong baby  
Lord have mercy the key wont unlock this door
