Papas hitting the road again  
Takes the show crosscountry for hire  
And the crowds come and go  
Secret agents getting bigger  
Moms holding sister in the chair  
Turning pages of photographs  
Warm in their memories  
Falling asleep by the fire  
  
To the highway where some new cowboys go  
Drivers and drifters and rouges  
And the crews still working  
Everybodys cracking jokes  
Morning comes so easy  
Sharing stories and forgetting time  
Take the rest in the look in her eyes  
As they go and close time  
  
Papas driving past the night  
Hes working his way to make it home  
The old man gonna be a sight  
When the morning come when the morning comes  
  
To the highway where some old cowboys go  
Drivers and drifters and rouges  
Some drink here some dance here  
Hear old big boy telling jokes  
Moms holding sister in the chair  
Sharing stories and forgetting time  
Warm in their memories of  
Falling asleep by the fire  
  
Papas he driving past the night  
Hes working his way to make it home  
The old man gonna be a sight  
When the morning come when the morning comes  
Papas coming home  
Papas coming home  
  
Papa coming home
