He said Im fabulously rich  
Cmon just lets go  
She kinda bit her lip  
Geez I dont know  
But I can guarantee  
Therell be no knock on the door  
Im total pro thats what Im here for  
I come from downtown  
Born ready for you  
Armed with will and determination  
And grace too  
  
The secret rules of engagement  
Are hard to endorse  
When the appearance of conflict  
Meets the appearance of force  
But I can guarantee  
Therell be no knock on the door  
Im total pro  
Thats what Im here for  
I come from downtown  
Born ready for you  
Armed with skill and its frustration  
And grace too
