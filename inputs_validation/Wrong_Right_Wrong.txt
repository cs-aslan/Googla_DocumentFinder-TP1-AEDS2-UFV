Chorus  
Some people got the wrong right  
Some people got the right wrong  
Some people got the wrong right  
Some people got the right wrong  
wrong right  
Some people got the right wrong  
Some people got the wrong right  
Some people got the right wrong  
  
And theyre teaching their doctrine  
To the children of today  
Every mickle make a muckle  
If you know what I say  
Dont be fooled by the fool  
The trick that they play  
  
Chorus  
  
And they know what is in their mind  
Theyre trying to prove instead of to find  
Truth dont hide in no valley  
Truth dont hide in no brook  
Truth a hide in your heart  
  
Chorus  
  
Woe onto them who cause iniquity  
With chords of vanity they call evil God  
Put darkness for light bitter for sweet  
Woe unto dem who are wise  
In their own eyes what a life  
Behind the scene eyes nuh see  
What governments hide  
CIA should DOA KGB should RIP  
Thats what on my mind  
  
The Bible was changed to suit King James  
Many empty lies hear say hear say hear say  
John public blind public want to know the truth today  
And the world became this way  
Because the trick in the trade  
They refuse to see it save the people pray  
Doctrine where is your happiness  
Were in a slummy economic mess  
Whole world is crying whole world is dying  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Some a dem Some a dem Some a dem  
Some a dem Some a dem Some a dem  
Some a dem  
Some people dont know  
Some people dont know  
Some people dont know  
Some people dont know
