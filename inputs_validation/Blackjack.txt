Ah let me tell you people  
About this blackjack game  
Its caused me nothing but trouble  
And Ive only myself to blame  
  
Hey hey hey yeah  
How unlucky can one man be  
Well every quarter I get  
Lord blackjack takes it away from me  
  
My friends dont come around me  
Because Ive been so blind  
I cant even borrow a nickle  
Now Ive almost lost my mind  
  
Hey hey hey yeah  
How unlucky can one man be  
Well every quarter I get  
Lord blackjack takes it away from me  
  
I sat there with two tens  
I thought Id have some fun  
The dealer hit sixteen with a five  
Just enough to make twenty one  
  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah  
How unlucky can one man be  
Well every quarter I get  
Yeah blackjack takes it away from me
