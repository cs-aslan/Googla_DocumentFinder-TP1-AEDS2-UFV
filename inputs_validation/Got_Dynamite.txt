I cant take your hand  
And lead you to the water  
I cant make you feel  
What you dont feel but you know you wanna  
Find out how to crack me  
Log in try to hack me  
  
Underneath the surface  
There so much you need to know  
And you might feel like your drowning  
And thats what I need to let go  
  
Chorus  
Tell me what youve got to break down the walls  
You just might need dynamite  
Tell me what youve got to break down the walls  
Kick senseless my defenses  
Tell me what your gonna do  
I need you to light the fuse  
Tell me what youve got to break down the walls  
You just might need dynamite  
  
Got dynamite  
  
I cant paint this picture  
Just so you can hang it  
  
I cant wait  
For you to understand  
If you just dont get it  
  
Find out how to crack me  
Log in try to hack me  
Underneath the surface  
There is so much you need to know  
And you might feel like your drowning  
But thats what I need to let go  
  
Chorus  
  
When the walls come crashing down  
I hope youre standing right in front of me  
Where my past lies all around  
Cause all you need to save me is to intervene  
And make the walls come crashing down  
  
Got dynamite  
  
Chorus  
  
I got dynamite  
I got dynamite
