Verse 1  
We all walk around  
And waste life  
Its just gonna go on forever  
Like theres some eternal endless supply  
Of what it takes to keep us alive  
There might be a day  
When everything goes away  
To remind us how ungrateful our culture is  
We need to take time  
To replace whats stolen from Mother Nature  
  
Hook  
We only have  
1 sun 1 moon 1 me  
1 you  
And we only have a little time to show how much we love  
The sun the sun the moon the moon  
How much I really love you  
We only have a little bit of time time time time  
  
Verse 2  
I once heard  
Grace Jones say  
I have my own concept of time  
I always think bout that cause Ive always felt like  
I was running a little behind  
Whats in front of me  
I dont know  
Cause I cant see what hasnt started to grow  
  
Hook  
We only have  
1 sun 1 moon 1 me  
1 you  
And we only have a little time to show how much we love  
The sun the sun the moon the moon  
How much I really love you  
We only have a little bit of time time time time  
  
Verse 3  
Wake up world  
Cant you see the earth is crying  
Wake up world  
Cant you see all the clouds are dying  
And maybe one day there wont be rainbows  
Grass wont be green and the sky wont be blue  
I dont wanna see a cyclone  
Theres no sun no moon no me no you  
  
Hook  
We only have  
1 sun 1 moon 1 me  
1 you  
And we only have a little time to show how much we love  
The sun the sun the moon the moon  
How much I really love you  
We only have a little bit of time time time time
