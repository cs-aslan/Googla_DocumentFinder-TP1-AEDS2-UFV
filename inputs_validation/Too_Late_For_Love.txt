Somewhere in the distance I hear the bells ring  
Darkness settles on the town as the children start to sing  
And the lady cross the street she shuts out the night  
Theres a cast of thousands waiting  
As she turns out the light  
  
But its too late too late too late  
Too late for love  
Yes its too late too late too late  
Too late for love  
  
London boys are gazing as the girls go hand in hand  
With a pocket full of innocence their entrance is grand  
And the queen of the dream stands before them all  
She stretches out her hand as the curtains start to fall  
  
But its too late too late too late  
Too late for love  
Yes its too late too late its too late  
Too late for love  
With a pocket full of innocence their entrance is grand  
And the queen of the dream stands before them all  
She stretches out her hand as the curtain starts to fall  
  
But its too late too late too late  
Too late for love  
Yes its too late too late its too late  
Too late for love  
  
Standing by the trapdoor aware of me and you  
Are the actor and the clown theyre waiting for their cue  
And theres a lady over there shes acting pretty cool  
But when it comes to playing life  
She always plays the fool  
  
But its too late too late its too late  
Too late for love  
Its too late its too late too late  
Too late for love  
  
Is it all too late  
Much too late  
Cant you see its all too late  
Its too late  
  
But its too late too late its too late  
Too late for love  
Its too late its too late too late  
Too late for love
