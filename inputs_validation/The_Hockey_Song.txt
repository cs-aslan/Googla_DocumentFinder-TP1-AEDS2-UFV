Hello out there were on the air  
Its hockey night tonight  
Tension grows  
As the whistle blows  
And the puck goes down the ice  
The goalie jumps  
And the players bump  
And the fans all go insane  
Someone roars  
Bobby Scores  
At the good old hockey game  
  
Chorus  
Oh  
The good old hockey game  
Its the best game you can name  
And the best game you can name  
Is the good old hockey game  
  
Second Period  
Players dash  
With skates aflash  
The home team trails behind  
But they grab the puck  
And go bursting up  
And theyre down across the line  
They storm the crease  
Like bumblebees  
They travel like a burning flame  
See them slide the puck inside  
Its a one one hockey game  
  
Chorus  
Oh  
The good old hockey game  
Its the best game you can name  
And the best game you can name  
Is the good old hockey game  
  
Third Period  
Last game in the playoffs too  
Oh take me where the hockey players  
Face off down the rink  
And the Stanley Cup  
Is all filled up  
For the champs who win the drink  
Now the final flick  
Of a hockey stick  
And a one gigantic scream  
THE PUCK IS IN THE HOME TEAM WINS  
At the good old hockey game  
  
chorus repeat 3 times  
Oh  
The good old hockey game  
Its the best game you can name  
And the best game you can name  
Is the good old hockey game
