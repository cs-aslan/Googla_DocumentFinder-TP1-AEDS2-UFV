Big wind big winds comin  
From daylight till dusk weve been a workin in the dust  
Pickin cotton workin side by side  
Oh I cant forget I still remember yet the way my daddy looked at me and cried  
Big winds a comin listen to the hummin hurry up now be quick dont stall  
You know we cant be slow take the kids and get below  
If we dont hurry itll surely get us all  
  
I ran across the field so scared my lips was scaled  
To warn my mom to storm was on its way  
Now I knew Id won the race when Id see my mamas face  
And the way she looked at me and said  
Big winds a comin  
  
Oh but dad was on the cellar and by now the sky was yellow  
The wind was blowin trees were fallin  
And outside I heard him cryin and as he lay there dyin  
It seemed I could still hear him sayin  
Big winds a comin  
Big wind big winds comin
