There are pyramids in my head  
Theres one underneath my bed  
And my ladys getting cranky

Ive consulted all the sages  
I could find in the yellow pages

And the mayan panoramas

Ive been told someone in the know  
Can be sure that his luck is as good as gold

You can keep the edge of a razor as sharp as an eagles eye  
You can grow a hedge that is vertically straight over ten feet high  
All you really need is a pyramid and just a little luck
