Well I got a girl they call Skinnie Minnie  
She may be skinny but shes got plenty  
The kind of lovin that I desire  
The kind of love that sets my soul on fire  
Skinnie Minnie man that gal can love  
Shes long and lean like a stringbean  
She dont look good in blue jeans  
Her hair hangs down like a rag mop  
She makes my heart go flippedyflop  
She cant cook she aint much on looks  
The things she knows she didnt read in books  
Skinnie Minnie man that gal can love  
  
When me and Minnie walk down the street  
All the boys stop and stare  
But if they knew just what I do  
You bet your life theyd love her too  
Well when I kiss her out in the dark  
I tear the thing up theres so much spark  
Skinnie Minnie man that gal can love
