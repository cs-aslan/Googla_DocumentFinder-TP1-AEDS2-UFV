Daisy Daisy  
Give me your answer do  
Im half crazy  
All for the love of you  
It wont be a stylish marriage  
I cant afford a carriage  
But youll look sweet  
Upon the seat  
Of a bicycle built for two  
  
Michael Michael  
Here is your answer true  
Ill not cycle  
Over the world with you  
If you can afford a carriage  
There wont be any marriage  
Cause Ill be damned  
If Ill be crammed  
On a bicycle built for two
