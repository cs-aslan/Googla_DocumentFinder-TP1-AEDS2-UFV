Something about you makes me feel this way  
Boy I want to know what youre startin  
Baby you can relax as a matter of fact  
Theres a time for love and that times now  
  
Since the moods right  
I only want to see you by the moonlight  
While we make sweet love  
By the starlight  
Baby let me take control  
Oh baby  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night baby all night  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night baby all night  
  
Can you stay right here and you hold me tight  
All through the night  
Doesnt that sound real nice  
If control could be taken would you take control of me  
And lead me to ecstasy  
  
Since the moods right  
I only want to see you by the moonlight  
While we make sweet love  
By the starlight  
Baby let me take control  
Oh baby  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it there baby  
All night baby all night  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night baby all night  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night baby all night  
Baby keep it right there  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night baby all night  
  
Ive been waiting  
Cant ignore what I feel inside my heart  
I wont hold back Ill it go tonight  
Gonna take control  
  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
Keep it right there  
All night baby all night
