Throw out our love like it was old news  
Be sure to wear your best pair of walking out shoes  
Go take the world into your hot hands  
You want the music baby go have the dance  
  
Ooh when you miss my love  
And youre thinking about  
How good it used to be  
Ooh and when you long for my touch  
  
Baby please dont come crying to me  
Remember you were the one who wanted to be free  
Thats how you wanted to be  
So dont come crying dont come crying to me  
Dont you come crying  
  
Walk out the door go on and go free  
Step on my heart like its the ground under your feet  
Find another lover if you want to  
You got to do whatever you got to do  
  
Ooh but when the nights get cold  
And youre thinking about  
How hot we used to be  
Ooh and when theres no one to hold  
  
Baby please dont come crying to me  
Remember you were the one who wanted to be free  
Thats how you wanted to be  
So dont come crying dont come crying to me  
  
When youre loving  
And you tell youre Incomprehensible what you need  
Oh dont you come crying crying to me no no  
Dont come crying dont you come crying  
  
Ooh but when you miss my love  
When youre thinking about  
How good it used to be  
Ooh and when you long for my touch  
  
Baby please dont come crying to me  
Remember you were the one who wanted to be free  
Thats how you wanted to be  
So dont come crying dont come crying now  
  
Dont come crying to me  
Remember you were the one who wanted to be free  
Thats how you wanted to be  
So so dont come crying baby dont come crying now  
  
When youre lonely  
Cant get what you need  
Oh dont you come crying to me  
Dont come crying  
Dont you come crying
