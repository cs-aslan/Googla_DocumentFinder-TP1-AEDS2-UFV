Tired of shootin smack tired of on the run  
Traded the needle for the gun  
Tired of livin small tired of the withdrawal  
No more retreat time for attack  
  
Oh Benny how many times you tried to kill yourself  
ODs and robberies and super stunts  
I never thought youd die from them  
  
Riding around in tanks fire a round of blanks  
Benny had never had such fun  
Until he took a wrong step into bomb  
And thats when Benny got blowed up  
  
Alone under a blanket soaked with sweat and piss  
We figured Benny would end up like this  
We just didnt think for them
