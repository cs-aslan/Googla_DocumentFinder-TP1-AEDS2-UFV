Freddy my love I miss you more than words can say  
Freddy my love please keep in touch while youre away  
Hearing from you can make the day so much better  
Getting a souvenier or maybe a letter  
I really flipped over the great cashmere sweater  
Freddy my love Freddy my love Freddy my love  
  
Freddy you know your absense makes me feel so blue sooo blue  
Thats okay though your presents make me think of you sure they do  
Mama will have a heartattack when she catches  
Those peddle pushers with the black leather patches  
Oh how I wish I had a jacket that matches Freddy my love  
Freddy my love Freddy my love Freddy my love  
  
Dont keep your letters from me I thrill to every line  
Your spellings kinda crummy but honey so is mine  
I treasure every gifty the ring is really nifty  
You say it cost you fifty so youre thrifty I dont mind  
  
Whoa  Freddy you see youll hold me in your arms someday Freddy my love  
And I will be wearing your lacy lingerie Freddy Im yours  
Thinking about it my hearts pounding already  
Knowing when you come home were bound to go steady  
And throw your service pay around like confetti Freddy my love  
  
Freddy my love Freddy my love Freddy my love  
Freddy my love Freddy my love Freddy my love  
Freddy my love  
to fade
