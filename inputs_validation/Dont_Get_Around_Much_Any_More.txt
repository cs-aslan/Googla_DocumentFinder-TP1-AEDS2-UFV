Missed the Saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldnt bear it without you  
Dont get around much anymore  
  
Thought Id visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
Couldnt bear it without you  
Dont get around much anymore  
  
Darlin I guess my minds more at ease  
But nevertheless why bring back old memories  
  
Been invited to dates  
Might have gone but what for  
Couldnt bear it without you  
Dont get it around much anymore  
  
Missed the Saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldnt bear it without you  
Dont get around much anymore  
  
Been invited to clubs  
Couldve gone but what for  
Awfully lonesome without you  
Dont get around much anymore  
  
Yes darlin I guess my minds more at ease  
But nevertheless why bring back old memories  
  
Been invited to dates  
Might have gone but what for  
Awfully lonesome without you  
Dont get around much anymore
