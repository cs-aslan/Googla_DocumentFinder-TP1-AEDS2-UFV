Babe  
It seems every night and day I get to lose  
And I always held the faith inside  
That love would find a way  
And I always reached for more  
Than the others ever saw  
  
I was always the first to follow  
My foolish prayer  
And the feelings that I have are more than  
Any soul can bare  
  
Only when I wake  
Then I can be sure of who I am  
Im half the man I should be  
When youre gone and youre telling me  
  
This is love but just in case  
I keep my heart in a secret place  
Safe under lock and key  
Til I know its only me  
One of us got to be the one thats true  
One for the other and the love comes through  
Right here or out in space  
Give my heart to youbabe  
But just in case just in case  
  
Tell the world that I come to claim  
Your tomorrows  
Let the universal word go out  
A million miles away  
And history has shown  
that when the seed is sown  
We are livig in a time when the tears fall  
Where they might  
But we hear each other much more than those who  
See  
We are not alone  
Love is there for everyone who needs  
And for anyone who cries  
And I will alaways have you here with me  
  
And youre telling me  
This is love but just in case  
Keep my heart in a secret place  
Safe under lock and key  
Til I know its only me  
One of us got to be the one thats true  
One for the other and the love comes through  
Yoursmine and face to face  
Give my heart to youbabe  
But just in case
