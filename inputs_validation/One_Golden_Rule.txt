Theres a heart in the middle of somewhere tonight  
Screaming for reasons or just a way out  
I put the shirt off my back on a wager that says  
Theres one every night from my old school yard days  
I hear you say one golden rule  
One golden rule  
  
Theres been times Ive been stood in the wind and the rain  
Freezing and busted and tricked out of luck  
And I cursed my teachers for all of their reading  
What we needed most cant be found in them books  
One golden rule  
  
Now they teach you to swim but they dont speak of the danger  
Tell you the truth but they never say why  
Put you on ice that is thin and tell you its winter  
Without one golden rule the truth is a lie  
One golden rule
