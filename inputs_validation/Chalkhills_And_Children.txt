Im floating over strange land  
Its a soulless sequined showbiz moon  
Im floating over strange land  
And then stranger still theres no balloon  
But Im getting higher  
Wafted up by fames fickle fire til the  
  
Chalkhills and children  
Anchor my feet  
Chalkhills and children  
Bringing me back to earth  
Eternally and ever Ermine Street  
Even I never know where I go when my eyes are closed  
  
Im skating over thin ice  
Upon blunted blades of metal soft  
Im skating over thin ice  
While some nonesuch net holds me aloft  
But Im getting higher  
Lifted up on lucks circus wire til the  
  
Chalkhills and children  
Anchor my feet  
Chalkhills and children  
Bringing me back to earth  
Eternally and ever Ermine Street  
  
Even I never know where I go when my eyes are closed  
Even I never spied that the scenes were posed  
Even I never knew this is what Id be  
Even eyes never mean that youre sure to see  
  
Still Im getting higher  
Rolling up on three empty tyres til the  
  
Chalkhills and children  
Anchor my feet  
Chalkhills and children  
Bringing me back to earth  
Eternally and ever Ermine Street  
  
Im soaring over hushed crowds  
The reluctant cannonball it seems  
Im soaring over hushed crowds  
Im propelled up here by long dead dreams  
  
Still Im getting higher  
Icarus regrets and retires puzzled  
  
Chalkhills and children  
Anchor my feet  
Chalkhills and children  
Oddly complete  
Even I never know where I go when my eyes are all closed  
  
Here I go again
