That woman will take you that woman will break you  
That woman will make you something youve never seen  
That womans got claws that womans got laws  
Now look out man youre gonna loose your mind  
  
I had a friend his name was Frank  
He walked on the water and lord he sank  
We used to go stag now hes got a hag  
It looks like Franks got a new bag  
  
That woman will take you that woman will break you  
That woman will make you something youve never seen  
That womans got claws that womans got laws  
Now look out Frank youre gonna loose your mind  
  
What happened to Frank can happen to you  
Just find you a woman and watch what shell do  
That woman will take you that womans gonna break you  
Look out man youre gonna loose youre gonna loose your mind
