Youre living in a small town  
The people there are cold  
Just living in a small town  
Just doing as youre told  
You move up to the jungle  
You find that its a hell  
When you slip you fall you stumble  
They lock you in a cell  
  
Hey you youve got it made  
Hey you youve got it made  
Hey you youve got it made  
Hey you all your friends told you in your small town  
Hey you youve got it made  
  
Just living in your home town  
Sometimes its kinda cruel  
Living in your home town  
Where they treat you like a fool  
You move up to the city  
You find that its tough  
And it doesnt seem very pretty  
Now youre sleeping in the rough  
  
Hey you youve got it made  
Hey you youve got it made  
Hey you  
Youve got it made  
Hey you  
Youre heading for the big time  
Hey you youve got it made  
Youre headed for a life of crime  
  
Living in this jungle  
Its like living in a hell  
When you slip you fall you stumble  
They lock you in a cell  
You move out to the country  
For something you have done  
Youre living in the country  
Why dont you go back to where you come from  
  
Hey you youve got it made Repeat x5  
  
Forget all these backslappers  
You dont stand a chance  
Why dont you go home  
Go right back to where you come from  
Dont get involved in this masquerade  
This big city is going to eat you up  
All the backslapping  
Hey you youve got it made
