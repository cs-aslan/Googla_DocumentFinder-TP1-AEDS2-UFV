There comes a time when we need a certain call  
When the world must come together as one  
There are people dying  
Oh and its time to lend a hand to life  
The greatest gift of all  
  
We cant go on pretending day by day  
That someone somehow will soon make a change  
Were all a part of Gods great big family  
And the truth  you know love is all we need  
  
Chorus  
We are the world we are the children  
We are the ones who make a brighter day  
So lets start giving  
Theres a choice were making  
Were saving our own lives  
Its true well make a better day  
Just you and me  
  
Well sendem you your heart  
So they know that someone cares  
And their lives will be stronger and free  
As God has shown us  
By turning stone to bread  
And so we all must lend a helping hand  
  
Chorus  
  
When youre down and out  
There seems no hope at all  
But if you just believe  
Theres no way we can fall  
Well well well lets realize  
That one change can only come  
When we stand together as one
