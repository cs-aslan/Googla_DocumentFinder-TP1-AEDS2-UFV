I was feelin rather good  
Shouldve touched some wood  
Here she comes again  
Reachin out to bend my ear  
  
Shes worth another look  
All the time it took  
Pleasin to the eye  
How can I just disappear oh  
It aint clear no  
Shes a bright and shining star  
But I just must be sensitive to light  
Oh I just might yeah  
  
I could have let her in  
Give her just a spin  
Let her think its love  
Better rise above it all  
  
Shes knockin at the door  
Seems to want some more  
Never gets the clue  
What am I to do shell fall  
And she might call oh no  
Shes a bright and shining star  
But I just must be sensitive to light  
Oh I just know  
  
She could do me well  
I can always tell  
Shes ready for the kill  
But I think that I will go no  
  
Sure Im gonna see  
Something just for me  
Til it comes along  
When its feelin wrong Ill know  
Gotta take it slow yeah  
  
Shes a bright and shining star  
But I just must be sensitive to light  
Oh I might yeah  
  
Shes a bright and blazing star  
But I just must be sensitive to light yeah  
Sensitive to light oh
