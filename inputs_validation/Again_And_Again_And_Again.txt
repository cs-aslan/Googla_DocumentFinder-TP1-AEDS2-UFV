Ah you dont wanna be the little woman  
No you dont wanna be the little woman I love  
No no no no I love  
  
Ah you dont wanna stay in my school  
You dont wanna be the one thats cool  
You dont wanna be the little woman I love  
  
Youre up all night  
And we can let it hang down right yes we could  
I say goodbye to all my expectations  
The day you walked out of my life  
  
Winter time is acoming now  
Give me a sign if you can somehow  
Make it clear where you heading for  
Will I see you some day at my door  
  
Taking it all in to consideration  
Loves a game I never win  
Ive been in very similar situations  
Again and again and again  
  
Ah now you dont wanna be the little woman no  
You dont wanna be the little woman I love I love  
  
Ah you dont wanna stay in my home  
No you just wanna be on your own  
Well you dont wanna be the little woman I love  
  
Take it away  
  
Oh damn right  
  
Ah yeah well things were fine all summer long  
And then things changed so where did we go wrong  
We can run but we cannot hide  
In greener grass on the other side  
  
Taking it all in to consideration  
But loves a game I never win  
Ive been in very similar situations  
Again and again and again  
Again and again and again oh  
Again and again and again and again  
Again and again and again and again  
Again and again and again and again  
And again and again and again oh  
Again and again and again and again  
Again and again and again and again  
Again and again and again and again  
Again and again and again and again  
Again and again and again and again
