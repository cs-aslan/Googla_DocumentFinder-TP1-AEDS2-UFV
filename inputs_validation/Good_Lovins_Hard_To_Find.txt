Every womans out there lookin for a rich man  
And every mans out there looking for a perfect ten  
Cant always get what you want sometimes  
So your better off just takin what you can  
  
Money wont make you happy baby  
And a perfect woman sons gonna make you sad  
If you think thats where its at then Im telling you your wrong  
Cause you can have it all one day and then its gone  
You can search all of your life and still not find  
What you want aint what youve got  
  
Chorus  
Good lovin so hard to find  
Could this be the right place at the right time  
Good lovin feels so fine  
I just cant get enough  
Cause good lovins hard to find so hard to find  
  
We all need good lovin  
Aint talkin about no one night stand  
Some have the touch and others just a hand  
But when you find the right one then youll understand  
  
Cant always get what you want sometimes  
So youre better off just takin what you can  
You can search all of your life and still not find  
What you want aint what youve got  
  
Chorus  
  
Some of that good good love  
Some of that good good love  
Some of that good good love  
Good lovin  
So hard to find  
Good lovin  
Make you loose your mind  
Good lovin  
Good good love  
Good lovin  
Some of that lovin baby
