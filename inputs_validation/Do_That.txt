I like that though  
Thats whats up  
  
Some people like the summer when its hot  
  
Some people like the winter cold  
Some people speak their minds when they wanna  
And some other people aint so bold  
Whatever it is that you do  
You should do you should do with your head held high  
So when youre doing youre thing its cause you wanna  
And they never can ask you why  
  
1 I say  
Do what you do  
Say what you say  
Mean what you mean when you say  
Cause its your life  
Gotta make your own rules  
And you gotta do it do it your own way  
  
  
  
  
  
Repeat 1  
  
2  Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Some like it easy when others they like it rough  
But aint nobody gotta like it but you  
Girl boy boy girl girl girl boy boy  
Whatever you should do what you do  
How can they tell you that you could or should  
Would or wouldnt  
Well ask em can they walk in your shoes  
Cause its your life and you do what you wanna  
And remember baby its all about you  
  
Repeat 1 2x  
  
Repeat 2  
  
3  So if its on your mind  
Then you should speak your piece  
And say whatcha say  
And if you want it done  
Then you should get it done  
And do it your way  
  
Repeat 3  
  
Repeat 1 2x  
  
Repeat 2 2x  
  
Repeat 1 till end
