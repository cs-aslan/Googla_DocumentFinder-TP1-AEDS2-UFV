Hey kind friend  
I dont know when Ill see you again  
On a ferry boat bound to Victoria  
Laying down to hide from the wind  
  
Big dipper hangin over the city  
You know everything now is different for me  
And it aint no use in  
Explainin the scenery  
  
I said  
Kind friend  
Help me forget where I been  
Kind friend  
Remember who I am  
  
I was too late in Spokane  
So I caught a ride through the cascade range  
I saw the sun die in Olympia  
Running down on capital lake  
  
Now I ask you for some relief  
Its one true root that you bring to me  
Its 3 am  
And its good company  
  
I said  
Hey kind friend  
Help me forget where I been  
Hey kind friend  
Help me remember who I am  
  
Hey kind friend  
Dont know if Im gonna see you again  
Its okay friend  
Its okay friend  
  
Its so hard when they all have  
  
So Ill meet you in New Orleans or Ill see you around  
Cause I dont know if its worth coming down  
Hey Im calling you  
From a gold rush town  
  
And I say  
Hey kind friend  
Help me forget where Ive been  
Hey kind friend  
Help me remember who I am  
  
Hey kind friend  
I dont know if Im gonna see you again  
Its ok friend  
Im ok friend  
  
I said Im ok friend  
Im ok friend  
  
See ya later
