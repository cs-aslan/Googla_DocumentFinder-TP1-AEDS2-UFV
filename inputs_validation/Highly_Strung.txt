This is the song of little Jo  
Shes not the girl I used to know  
Forever screaming all the day and night  
She used to be a diplomat  
But now shes down the laundromat  
They washed her mind and now she finds it hard  
I know her name  
But now she never seems the same  
She dont talk to me  
Cause she cant take no sympathy  
Because shes highly strung  
Oh highly strung shes undone  
Highly strung  
Oh highly strung shes undone  
Shes stepping out upon the ledge  
Shes got a gun against her head  
Shes wired up to blow the power line  
Shes walking out upon the knife  
Shell take you to the edge of life  
Just like the song the pressure is on again  
I know her name  
Ho but now she never seems the same  
She dont talk to me  
Cause she cant take no sympathy  
Because shes highly strung  
Oh highly strung shes undone  
Highly strung  
Oh highly strung shes undone  
No no no  
I know her name  
Ho but now she never seems the same  
She dont talk to me  
Cause she cant take no sympathy  
Because shes highly strung  
Oh highly strung shes undone  
Highly strung  
Oh highly strung shes undone  
Highly strung  
Oh highly strung shes undone  
Highly strung  
Oh highly strung shes undone  
This is the song of little Jo  
Shes not the girl I used to know
