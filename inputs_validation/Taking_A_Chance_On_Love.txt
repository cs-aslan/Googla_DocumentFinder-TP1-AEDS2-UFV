Here I go again I hear those trumpets blow again  
All aglow again takin a chance on love  
Here I slide again about to take that ride again  
Starryeyed again takin a chance on love  
I thought that cards were a frameup I never would try  
Now Im taking that game up and the ace of hearts is  
High  
Things are mending now I see a rainbow blending now  
Well have a happy ending now takin a chance on love  
Here I slip again about to take that trip again  
I got that grip again takin a chance on love  
Now I prove again that I can make life move again  
Um  Im in the groove again takin a chance on love  
I walk around with a horse shoe in clover I lie  
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your Foot  
Goodbye  
On that ball again Im ridin for a fall again  
Im gonna give my all again takin a chance on love
