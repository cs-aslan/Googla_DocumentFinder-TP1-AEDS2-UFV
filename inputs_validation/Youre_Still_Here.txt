Thought I saw you today  
You were standing in the sun then you turned away  
And I knew it couldnt be  
But my heart believed  
  
Oh it seems like theres something everyday  
How could you be so far away  
  
When youre still here  
When I need you youre not hard to find  
Youre still here  
  
I can see you in my babys eyes  
And I laugh and cry  
Youre still here  
  
I had a dream last night  
That you came to me on silver wings  
And I flew away with you on a painted sky  
And I woke up wondering  
What was real  
Is it what you see and touch  
Or what you feel  
  
Cause youre still here  
Oh youre everywhere weve ever been  
Youre still here  
  
I heard you in a strangers laugh  
And I hung around to hear him laugh again  
Just once again  
  
Thought I saw you today  
You were standing in the sun then you turned away  
  
Away
