Mason died on Monday we bricked him in the wall  
All his children grew and grew they aint never grown so tall before  
They may never grow so tall again  
  
We dug him up on Tuesday he hardly aged a day  
Taught us all we ever knew we aint never known so much before  
We may never know so much again  
  
The wall collapsed on Wednesday we chalked it up to fate  
Masons children ran and flew they aint never run so fast before  
Swore theyd never show their face again  
Mason was a mighty man a mighty man was he  
  
Always said when Im dead Im gone dont you weep for me  
Thursday came then Friday with buyers tall and bright  
Masons children cooked the stew and cleaned up when the feast was through  
Take me to the repoman to pay back what is owed  
If hes in some other land write it off as stole
