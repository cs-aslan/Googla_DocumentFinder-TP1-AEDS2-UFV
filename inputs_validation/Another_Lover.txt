Shes calling up her old boyfriends  
Im falling in love with her again  
Shes looking for a change of paceshe says  
I can see that old look on her face  
She says it takes an open mind  
I think she means an open relationship  
She says I can be so unkind  
All I said was  
Dont think twice  
If you gotta go Mary its alright  
How much love can one man need  
Dont change your mind  
Because true love is hard to find  
But Ill find anotherlover  
She says it isnt wrong or right  
And me Im emotionally colourblind  
Shes waking me at half past four  
Im sleeping on the bathroom floor again  
Shes fallen for his new age verse  
Im holding back a level of consciousness  
I know it isnt wrong or right  
But all I said was  
Dont think twice  
If you gotta go Mary its alright  
How much love can one man need  
Dont change your mind  
Because true love is hard to find  
But Ill find anotherlover  
I ran into an old girlfriend  
On the corner of Varrick and VanDam  
She said she had to change her address  
What a strange coincidence
