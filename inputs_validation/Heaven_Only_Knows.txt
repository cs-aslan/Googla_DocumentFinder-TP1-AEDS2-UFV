Every night its the same  
I feel your heart turn cold as rain  
And know that youll be gone again  
I hear the front door close  
You say you got to go downtown  
I guess theres someone else youve found  
So why youre still coming round  
Heaven only knows  
  
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  
Make me feel like I could die  
Thats the way it goes  
Heaven only ever sees  
How loves made a fool of me  
I guess thats how its meant to be but  
Heaven only knows  
  
Ive heard it said that talk is cheap  
But still your words they cut so deep  
Lay me crying in my sleep  
And the pain just grows  
I dont know whos right or wrong  
But all we had is dead and gone  
So why you keep me hanging on  
Heaven only knows  
  
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  
Make me feel like I could die  
Thats the way it goes  
Heaven only ever sees  
How loves made a fool of me  
I guess thats how its meant to be but  
Heaven only knows  
  
Im going to turn and walk away  
Theres nothing left for me to say  
It wouldnt change things anyway  
Though I suppose  
The love I gave was always true  
Well I dont know what else to do  
And how Ill ever get over you  
Heaven only knows  
  
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  
Make me feel like I could die  
Thats the way it goes  
Heaven only ever sees  
How loves made a fool of me  
I guess thats how its meant to be but  
Heaven only knows
