When he loved me nothing in this world  
Could touch his love  
And now the light of love is back  
Can I return the joys hes dreaming of  
I dont know  
I dont know  
  
But if it dont work out  
The tears that Im crying baby  
Wont bring him home no no  
I want to bring him home  
  
Will he still care for me  
The way he did he before  
Or will he turn away  
And tell me he dont love me anymore  
I dont know  
Oh I dont know  
  
But if it dont work out  
The tears that Im crying baby  
Wont bring him home  
I want to bring him home  
  
But if I could forget  
The tears and the crying  
That I went through once before yeah  
Maybe my love and I could start  
Wed start again yeah  
  
One day I know well find again  
The love we had and I  
Will know and feel  
The joys and pleasures that Im dreaming of  
I dont know  
I dont know  
  
But if it dont work out  
The tears that Im crying baby  
Aint going to bring him home again  
Aint going to bring him home  
  
Hey but if it dont work out  
The tears that Im crying baby  
Hey aint going to bring him home again  
Im going to cry my heart out waiting for him yeah  
Cry my heart out yes I will  
Cry my heart out yes I will  
Cry my heart
