When tempting eyes across the road  
Said to me Id love to be with you  
Im not tempted for a moment  
I just think about my woman  
The baby calls me on the phone  
Telling me I need to hurrily home  
Well the hurrying is easy  
Because shes waiting up  
With all the love I need  
  
I prefer the moonlight  
The one right little lady by my side  
Thats what I like  
I prefer a late drive down the turn park  
With the moonlight shining so brightly  
Got her by my side  
Thats what Id like  
I prefer the moonlight  
  
I prefer playing quiet song  
Shes a mother love her daughter  
Moonlight dances on the water  
The moon is full and so am I  
I look at her and feel like I could cry  
But my tears contain no sorrow  
Because I know  
Shell wake up by my side tomorrow  
  
Morning noon and night  
When the feeling comes so right  
Somewhere in some sky  
Where the moon is surely shining bright
