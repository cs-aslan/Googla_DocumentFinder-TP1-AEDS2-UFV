Jimmys outside with his motor engine hummin  
Sent me along to see if you were comin  
Out onto the highway gonna break the city limits  
Jimmys gettin ready gonna put his foot in it  
Soft shoe Louie drinkin with his floozy Sue  
Got the invitation the burn outs due  
Id be a rebel when Im good and ready  
Headin for the bar  
Tell Jimmy to cool it  
But not to go too far  
Burn out on highway nine  
Theres gonna be a burn out on highway nine  
Louie and Jimmy didnt know about the plan  
Cops out on the highway  
Gonna take the job at hand  
Been hidin out for Louie gonna get him canned  
Gonna catch him in the action  
Hes gonna wanna make a stand  
Jimmys impatient wants to burn on rubber  
Hes gotta wait for Louie  
Cause there aint no other  
The undisputed king of the road said Jimmy Im ready You better shift your
load  
Burn out on highway nine  
Theres gonna be a burn out on highway nine  
Cmon and get it boy  
Louie and Jimmys out to have a fight  
Shakin hands with the man below  
Stokin out the flames  
Flames burnin higher  
One of them has gotta go  
One of them has gotta go  
Highway nine and theyre starting to roll  
Jimmys hearts thumpin  
Blood runnin cold  
Louie looks over and gives a sly smile  
Says look in your mirror boy  
Cops are behind  
Get a move on Jimmy  
Youre fallin for the trap  
Theres only one winner  
The loser takes the rap  
Well Bye bye Jimmy  
Dont wait for me inside  
Im goin back to floozy Sue  
And thanks for the ride  
Burn out on highway nine  
Theres gonna be a burn out on highway nine  
Burn out on highway nine  
Theres gonna be a burn out on highway nine
