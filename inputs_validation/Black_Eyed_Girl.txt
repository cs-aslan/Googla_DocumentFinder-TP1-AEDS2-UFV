Once had a woman I used to watch her walk  
Said I once had a woman I used to watch her talk  
Yes I once had a woman in my heart in my mind  
You know the kind  
Once saw my woman with another man  
Once saw my woman take a hold of his hand  
Said I once saw my woman in my heart in my mind  
Ooh Lord she was a mean kind  
She was a good woman yeah  
Nothing wrong with her  
A little bit wild but all right  
Now Im older  
Im real good at tellin lies  
But Ill never forget her no no  
Even in my heart even in my mind  
Black eyed girl of mine  
She was a black eyed girl of mine  
Shes so good  
Shes still free comin after you  
Yeah
