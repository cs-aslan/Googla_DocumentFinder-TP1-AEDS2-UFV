Are you there  
Can you hear me  
Somewhere near me  
In the morning  
Long ago  
Had to hold you so close  
Had to never let go  
Time on the river  
Sliding on by  
Hard to believe  
Wink of an eye  
  
Whered you go  
Baby Buffalo  
Whats become  
Of old Cotton Eyed Joe  
Hold up lying low  
Long gone come  
A summertime snow  
  
Talk to your doctor  
Making her rounds  
Ninetysix tears  
One thousand clowns  
There they are  
Shining bright  
True creation  
Pure delight  
They go on  
So do you  
On and on  
Maybe me too  
  
Long ago Baby Buffalo  
Whats become  
Of old Cotton Eyed Joe  
Hold up lying low  
Long gone come  
A summertime snow  
  
Hold on to now  
Till you have to let go  
Easy through your fingers ever so  
Im just guessing  
I dont know  
Maybe its a blessing  
I sure hope so
