Jimmy wanted her the moment that she stumbled his way  
With a cocktail in her hand she knew how shed win the game  
There were beautiful in all the right places  
She keeps her rendezvous with soup opera faces  
She started rumors that were driving him crazy  
He couldnt stop the things theyd say  
  
And they live for passion love and pain  
In a rage of jealousy and fame  
And they watch their dreams go up on flames  
  
Castles burning in the dead of night  
Castles burning in the dead of night  
Wo burnin  
  
In the kingdom of pretenders love is not what it seems  
Jimmy cried and then he punished her  
No one heard her scream  
On the outside its all crimson and clover  
On the inside they know its over  
  
And the band of lawyers that steal the show  
As they watch their world go up in smoke  
  
Castles burning in the dead of night  
Castles burning in the dead of night  
Wo burnin burnin burnin burnin  
  
When we return a story of a 5 alarm fire  
Late last night in the prestigious Hollywood hills  
Where one of the most controversial marriages in the  
Entertainment industry went up in smoke arson is suspected  
It is still under investigation  
  
You know I love you you know youre my girl  
Id never hurt you no  
  
Castles burning in the dead of night  
Castles burning in the dead of night  
Burnin burnin  
  
All is fair in love and war but war is hell  
In the heart of the night in the middle of the big bad city
