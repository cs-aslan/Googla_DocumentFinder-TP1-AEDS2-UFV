My girlfriend slipped and fell  
Now shes hanging from a cliff  
I cant come to her rescue  
But these flowers I must sniff  
  
You see Id really like to save her  
but I aint got the nerve  
Im chicken hearted  
Im chicken hearted  
  
Im tryin to kiss my girl  
And it makes me want to faint  
Im scared of my own shadow  
And afraid of what I aint  
  
Ive no inspiration  
Im kinda yellow  
Im chicken hearted  
Im chicken hearted  
  
Mamas in the workshop  
Daddys in the jail  
I seem to be afraid  
To go to work and make their bail  
  
I guess my folks will have  
Im chicken hearted  
Im chicken hearted
