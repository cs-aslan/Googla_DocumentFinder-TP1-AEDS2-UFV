Kids gettin tired hangin around  
So cocksure thinkin aloud  
Cant get it in cant get it out  
Sure aint enough and there aint no doubt  
Cant stop a train with just a smile  
Stop me at the start only for a while  
Hole in my pocket hole in my arm  
All thats left when lifes lost its charm  
This could be for us just any other day  
Come on girl weve really got to get away  
Its the only chance youll ever have to change  
Stickin in this city will drive you insane  
Kids gettin tired hangin around  
So cocksure thinkin aloud  
Cant get it in cant get out  
Sure aint enough and there aint no doubt  
Cant win or lose when theres little left to choose  
Now til next year itll always be the same  
The black back streets and people  
Who dont know your name  
Go with the wind itll only carry us away
