Nowhere to hide you cant escape the fun  
No matter where you run  
All that is gone with the times  
And time will tell on you if you dont carry through  
Youve got your soul on the line  
  
Long as you know which side the sun rises on everyone  
Wherever you go youll understand  
Holding the light in the center of your hand Theres a  
  
Chorus  
Whole world to save  
Theres a whole world to save  
You can start any place theres a  
Whole world to save Whole world  
Not any reason to wait  
  
Youre alone you and everything with a face  
Whyd they call it human race  
All in a world of our own  
I think its gone far enough I say we call their bluff  
Somebodys got to be strong  
If you get one wild night in life oh youd better get it right  
If its the only life you get  
What is it worth if its you and nothing left theres a  
  
Chorus  
  
Making a difference seeing what nobody sees  
I wont wait for a deliverance cause I know its waiting for me  
  
Long as you know which side the sun rises on everyone  
Wherever you go youll understand  
Holding the light in the center of your hand theres a  
  
Chorus
