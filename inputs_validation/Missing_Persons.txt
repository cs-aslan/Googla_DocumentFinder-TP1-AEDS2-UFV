Have you seen this face  
Does it ring a bell  
Does it strike a chord somewhere in your mind  
And theres a big reward  
If you help us solve this crime  
And if you recognize this face dial nine nine nine  
  
Have you seen this face  
Dig deep in your mind  
Has anybody seen that little girl of mine  
She was always a rover  
But Im afraid to say shes strayed  
Too far this time  
  
Now Im sitting at home staring at the wall  
Waiting for the missing person to call  
Waiting for the message Im dreading to hear  
Waiting to confirm my darkest fears  
Shes a missing person I wish I could see  
All of the places she might be  
Maybe I stopped her from being free  
Maybe there was something missing in me  
  
Wherever she is I hope shes doing fine  
But I wish that she would phone or drop us a line  
Till then Ive got nothing to ease my mind  
And Im thinking about her all the time
