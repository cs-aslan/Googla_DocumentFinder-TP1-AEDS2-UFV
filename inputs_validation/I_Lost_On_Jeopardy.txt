Ohohohoh  
  
I was there to match my intellect on national TV  
Against a plumber oh and an architect both with a PhD  
I was tense I was nervous I guess it just wasnt my night  
Art Fleming gave the answers  
Oh but I couldnt get the questions right aight aight  
  
I lost on Jeopardy baby oh

Well I knew I was in trouble now  
My hope of winning sank  
Oh cause I got the Daily Double now  
And then my mind went blank  
I took Potpourri for one hundred  
And then my head started to spin  
Well Im givin up Don Pardo
