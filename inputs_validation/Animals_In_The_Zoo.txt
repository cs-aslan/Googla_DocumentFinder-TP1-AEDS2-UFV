Youre just an animal in the zoo  
Sittin round feeling persecuted and abused  
Youre locked up and Im on the loose  
But I cant quite tell whos looking at who  
Cause Im an animal too  
But youre locked up in a zoo  
And you look at me and I look at you  
  
God made the heaven and the deep blue sea  
But man picked the flowers and he pulled up the trees  
God mad the moon and the rain and the sun  
But man made the money and the bombs and the guns  
So were all animals too  
But youre locked up in a zoo  
And you look at me and I look at you  
  
Im a prisoner but I got no cage  
Im locked up but I got no chain  
But the good guys lose and the bad guys win  
Thats why youre looking out and Im looking in  
But were all animals too  
But youre locked up in a zoo  
Cause you look at me and I look at you
