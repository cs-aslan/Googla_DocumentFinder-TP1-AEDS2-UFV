I dont mind just what you say  
I never heard you baby never heard you anyway  
I dont care what you do  
just so long as it aint me and you  
Sly sly sly like a demons eye  
  
Everythings good I said everythings fine  
You dont know dont know its the end of your time  
How does it feel to be turned away  
Ive known it baby almost every day  
Sly sly sly like a demons eye  
  
I dont need you anymore  
I dont want you baby hanging round my door  
You slip and slide round my brain  
You think youre so clever yeah but you know youre insane  
Sly sly sly like a demons eye  
  
I dddont mind just what you say  
I never heard you baby I never heard you anyway no I didnt  
Everythings good everythings fine  
You dont know its the end of your time  
Sly sly sly like the demons eye  
like the demons eye
