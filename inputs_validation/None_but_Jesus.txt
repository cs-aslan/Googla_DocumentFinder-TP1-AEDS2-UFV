In the quiet in the stillness  
I know that You are God  
In the secret of Your presence  
I know there I am restored  
When You call I wont refuse  
Each new day again Ill choose  
There is no one else for me  
None but Jesus  
Crucified to set me free  
Now I live to bring Him praise  
In the chaos in confusion  
I know youre sovereign still  
In the moment of my weakness  
You give me grace to do Your will  
So when You call I wont delay  
This my song through all my days  
There is no one else for me  
None but Jesus  
Crucified to set me free  
Now I live to bring Him praise  
All my delight is in You Lord  
All of my hope all of my strength  
All my delight is in You Lord forevermore
