The life Ive always wanted  
I guess Ill never have  
Ill be working for somebody else  
Until Im in my grave  
Ill be dreaming of a live of ease  
And mountains Oh mountains o things  
  
To have a big expensive car  
Drag my furs on the ground  
And have a maid that I can tell  
To bring me anything  
Everyone will look at me with envy and with greed  
Ill revel in their attention  
And mountains Oh mountains o things  
  
Sweet lazy life  
Champagne and caviar  
I hope youll come and find me  
Cause you know who we are  
Those who deserve the best in life  
And know what moneys worth  
And those whose sole misfortune  
Was having mountains o nothing at birth  
  
Oh they tell me  
Theres still time to save my soul  
They tell me  
Renounce all  
Renounce all those material things you gained by  
Exploiting other human beings  
  
Consume more than you need  
This is the dream  
Make you pauper  
Or make you queen  
I wont die lonely  
Ill have it all prearranged  
A grave thats deep and wide enough  
For me and all my mountains o things  
  
Mostly I feel lonely  
Good good people are  
Good people are only  
My stepping stones  
Its gonna take all my mountains o things  
To surround me  
Keep all my enemies away  
Keep my sadness and loneliness at bay  
  
Ill be dreaming dreaming Dreaming
