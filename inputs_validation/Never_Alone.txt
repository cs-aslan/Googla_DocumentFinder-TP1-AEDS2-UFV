You were like a lost kid looking for home  
You found what you wanted right in my arms  
  
If you walk out on me  
Just leave your memory  
Just take my sympathy and go  
I love you so youre never alone  
  
If you find another one turns your head  
And you cant understand why it hurts so bad  
  
If you walk out on me  
Just leave your memory  
Just take my sympathy and go  
  
If you walk out on me  
Just leave your memory  
Just take my sympathy and go  
I love you so youre never alone  
  
Girl youre never alone  
Never alone
