Well shes washed and polished  
And full of high octane  
Ridin with the top down  
Crusin in the fast land  
Her red hairs blowin bright as a flame  
Cadillac reds her name  
  
Cadillac red  
Singin as she passes by  
Cadillac red  
See that hillbilly fly  
Catch her if you can  
She can out run any man  
Cadillac red  
  
Her radios loud and shes rollin to the back beat  
Her best girlfriends are piled in the backseat  
Shes puttin her lipstick on  
Cause theres a Mustang blowin his horn  
  
Cadillac red  
Singin as she passes by  
Cadillac red  
See that hillbilly fly  
Catch her if you can  
She can out run any man  
Cadillac red  
  
Hey hey Cadillac red  
Hey hey Cadillac red  
Hey hey Cadillac red  
Hey hey Cadillac red
