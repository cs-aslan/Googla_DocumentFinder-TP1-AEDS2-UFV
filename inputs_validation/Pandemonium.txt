Is this a riot or are you just pleased to see me  
Why arent we holding hands and talking sweets  
I love you really though I know noone believes me  
Theres chaos every time we meet  
  
Oh no look what youve gone and done  
Youre creating pandemonium  
That song you sing means everything  
To me Im living in ecstasy  
The stars and the sun dance to your drum  
And now its pandemonium  
  
Youre crashing everywhere its like youre smashing china  
Skidding on an icy road  
Youre major trouble since you were almost a minor  
I sometimes think well both explode  
  
Oh no look what youve gone and done  
Youre creating pandemonium  
That song you sing means everything  
To me Im living in ecstasy  
My worlds gone mad what did you do  
Telling perfect strangers that I love you  
The stars and the sun dance to your drum  
And now its pandemonium  
  
I cant make sense of anything  
All I know is the partys in full swing  
If we both just stopped for a minute  
I declare war and then youd win it  
  
To tell you the truth I thought I was shockproof  
Until I saw what you get up to  
When you think about it its quite an achievement  
That after all I still love you  
  
Oh no look what youve gone and done  
Youre creating pandemonium  
That song you sing means everything  
To me Im living in ecstasy  
My worlds gone mad what did you do  
Telling perfect strangers that I love you  
The stars and the sun dance to your drum  
And now its pandemonium
