Shall I wear a buttonhole to jog your memory  
So youll recall the promise  
That I swore you made to me when we were younger  
You look sorry for yourself but what about  
Im some idea youre not without a doubt  
So you can put away that tongue  
I dont know who Im trying to kid  
Ill find another name for you  
Ill try to put the blame on you  
For everything we did  
Life shrinks and before you know it  
You have forgotten all the cuts and bruises  
Just be thankful we were only fighting for buttons  
And you know by now who loses  
  
Youre only half awake because you never go to bed  
And when he hears about it  
You know then the both of yous is dead and thats a promise  
Youll be sorry because I wont tell you again  
Youll stick like that one day  
And if you dont believe me go and ask St Thomas  
I dont know where its going to stop  
Spend your whole time trying to stay  
From breaking down or running away  
Or trying to keep up
