Ive been burning my bridges  
For too many years  
Drowning the sorrow  
Of too many tears  
Women and whiskey  
Are my only friends  
One gives me strength  
One just pretends  
  
Ive been waiting my whole life  
For things to work out right  
But those lonely days turn into lonely nights  
Yes it do  
  
Ive heard all the wisdom  
Of prophets and seers  
It dont soothe my passion  
And it dont ease my fears  
Burned by love  
And blinded by snow  
Bad luck and trouble  
Are with me wherever I go  
  
Ive been waiting my whole life  
For things to work out right  
But those lonely days turn into lonely nights  
Lonely days lonely nights  
Lonely days lonely nights  
  
Lonely days lonely nights  
Someday babe its gonna be alright  
Lonely days lonely nights  
Someday babe its gonna be alright for me for me  
  
Lonely days lonely nights  
Someday babe its gonna be alright
