I ma clean this whole shit out like colonics  
With words put together better than Sony electronics  
King of the jungle humbly stay honest  
Eat with the lions swim with pyranhas  
Gasoline the seem strike the match  
Inferno Im too thorough nigga so stand back  
Oof  
I spit shine get mine and rip rhymes  
And make my career take an incline  
Im strict with knives straight with razors  
Good with grenades and great with gauges  
Been around the world in a million stages  
Watch niggas bitch up and go through changes  
I had guns before thugs was in fashion  
I mashed out before niggas knew mashin  
I knew terror before the plane started crashin  
I got punch lines and niggas aint laughin  
Im gon be here after the smoke die down  
Insomnia style I wont lie down  
Fight the good fight dont need no help  
Keep your hands up defend yo self  
Move like I move and live life long  
Cant move up if ya heart not strong  
Getcha own shit cause this shits mine  
Yeah  
Every time I spit I shine  
Cocksucka I preach what I practise back shit up  
Wrap this rap shit up still actin up  
Get found in a trunk of an Acura  
Yall suck like jail and Dracula  
X turn up the heat increase the hatred  
Straight stone faced dont fuck wit gay shit  
So I guess that means I cant fuck wit you now  
Two down let off vacate to new town  
It feel like Bishop and juice now  
Got a flame thrower thatll burn big holes through your goose down  
Yeah  
Rough sound same strong background  
Been on black the big boys layin chips down  
My whole train of thought is  
To bully any mothafucker wit problems and not get caught  
I was blessed with life but I curse to death  
Im a spit to my very last breath fuck yall  
Im gon be here after the smoke die down  
Insomnia style I wont lie down  
Fight the good fight dont need no help  
Keep your hands up defend yo self  
Move like I move and live life long  
Cant move up if ya heart not strong  
Getcha own shit cause this shits mine  
Every time I spit I shine  
Let me give this a three second look I hit a million dollar target  
You aint came up yet well nigga let me show ya  
Come across dope like planes and boats  
Like balloons filled with Coke down a mexicans throat  
You ever seen a man get smoked they shit on they self  
Their body shake for a second then it gets dissected  
For evidence of the weapon and the people involved  
Let one nigga talk everybody gettin caught fa sho  
I say that to say this  
What  
If you cant handle the time then ride the bitch  
Might as well touch ya tail and jump the fence  
Castrate ya self expose the bitch  
X go head up but fuck never ran from it  
I got a gauge with buck shot that you cant stomach  
You aint a killa you a album filla  
You aint a soldier you a rap promoter game over  
Im gon be here after the smoke die down  
Insomnia your style I wont lie down  
Fight the good fight dont need no help  
Keep your hands up defend yo self  
Move like I move and live life long  
Cant move up if ya heart not strong  
Getcha own shit cause this shits mine  
Every time I spit I shine
