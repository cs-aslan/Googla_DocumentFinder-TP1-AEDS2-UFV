Baby doll Im gonna steal you away  
Baby doll Im gonna steal you away  
One of these nights when all is still  
Im gonna climb your windowsill  
And if my plans work OK  
Im gonna steal you away  
When everyone is fast asleep  
Into your room Ill softly creep  
And in my cloak of misty gray  
Im gonna steal you away  
What if detectives begin to trail me  
What if they find us they wouldnt jail me  
Though I was stealing theyd set me free  
When they see that were married happily  
So if one night your window squeaks  
And if the floor around you creaks  
Its gonna be elopement day  
Im gonna steal you away  
But if the detectives begin to trail me  
What if they find me they wouldnt jail me  
Though I was stealing they let me be free  
When they see that were married happily  
So if one night your window squeaks  
And if the floor around you creaks  
Its gonna be elopement day  
Im gonna steal you away  
Im gonna steal you  
Baby Im gonna steal you away
