Theres a big old smokin crater  
Where our house used to be  
I spent all my pach check  
Buyin up that TNT  
  
I just got back from goodwill  
Where I dumped all your clothes  
And I fed all your flowers  
To some old billy goat  
  
Now it aint much but its all that  
I could think of at the time  
The worst things were the first things  
That came into my mind  
  
I aint done here enough  
To get you out of my heart  
But at least Im feelin better  
What the hell its a good start  
  
Pull out a chainsaw to the oak tree  
Where our car bear a name  
Took her back home to your parking spot  
Upon lovers lane  
  
Ive been leaving lots of messages  
On those bathroom walls  
With your name and number  
Foursome hot stuff just call  
  
It aint much but its all that  
I could think of at the time  
The worst things were the first things  
That came into my mind  
  
I aint done here enough  
To get you out of my heart  
But at least I feel better  
What the hell Its a start  
  
I aint done here enough  
To get you out of my heart  
But at least Im feelin better  
What the hell its start
