Well Ive dreamed about today  
The same dream in many ways  
But I never thought Id be here  
Be here with you my pretty one  
  
Well Ive searched the whole world through  
To find someone who  
Would make this dream come true  
Its you and only you my pretty one  
  
Chorus  
Pretty one I long to hold you  
Through the night I want to hold you  
Pretty one has no one told you  
I love you  
Any day and you will find me  
Full of joy when youre beside me  
In a moment like this  
Could it be what Ive missed all my life  
  
Well Ive dreamed about today  
The same dream in so many ways  
But nothing can compare with  
Compare with you my pretty one  
  
Well I love your smile  
And I love your eyes  
And the way you talk makes me feel so nice  
Nothing can compare with the way you are  
And I need you now as I write this song  
Did I hear you say youre the only woman  
From a lonely prayer I am in the air  
  
Well Ive dreamed about today  
The same dream in so many ways  
But nothing can compare with  
Compare with you my pretty one  
But I never thought Id be here  
Be here with you my pretty one  
  
Chorus  
  
Well Ive dreamed about today  
The same dream in so many ways  
But nothing can compare with  
Compare with you my pretty one  
No nothing can compare with  
Compare with you my pretty one
