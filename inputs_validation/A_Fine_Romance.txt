A fine romance with no kisses  
A fine romance my friend this is  
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes  
But youre as cold as yesterdays mashed potatoes  
A fine romance you wont nestle  
A fine romance you wont wrestle  
I might as well play bridge  
With my old maid aunt  
I havent got a chance  
This is a fine romance  
  
A fine romance my good fellow  
You take romance Ill take jello  
Youre calmer than the seals  
In the arctic ocean  
At least they flap their fins  
To express emotion  
A fine romance with no quarrels  
With no insults and all morals  
Ive never mussed the crease  
In your blue serge pants  
I never get the chance  
This is a fine romance
