I dont wanna wait its been too long  
I dont wanna lay here all alone  
I dont wanna need this phone  
To hear you breathe  
  
Every second feels just like a year  
Every moment youre not here  
Is like a lifetime of lonely  
Please  
  
Hurry baby  
I need you coming through that door  
Hurry baby  
I cant be without you anymore  
Come and save me  
Im losing it  
I swear that this  
Not kissin you missin you is got me goin crazy  
Hurry baby  
  
Every single car that passes by  
My heart beats faster everytime  
I pray its your headlights coming home  
If I could just speed up that clock  
Id get you here then make it stop  
Id wrap you in my arms  
And love you real slow  
  
Hurry baby  
I need you coming through that door  
Hurry baby  
I cant be without you anymore  
Come and save me  
Im losing it  
I swear that this  
Not kissin you missin you is got me goin crazy  
Hurry baby  
  
Hurry baby  
Hurry baby  
Come and save me  
Im losing it  
I swear that this  
Not kissin you missin you is got me goin crazy  
Hurry baby  
I cant be without you anymore  
Hurry baby hurry baby  
Hurry baby  
Not kissin you missin you is got me  
Is got me goin crazy
