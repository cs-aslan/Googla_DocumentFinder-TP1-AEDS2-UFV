Youve got a friend in me  
Youve got a friend in me  
When the road looks rough ahead  
And youre miles and miles from your nice warm bed  
You just remember what your old pal said  
Yeah youve got a friend in me  
Baby youve got a friend in me  
  
Youve got a pal in me  
Youve got a friend in me  
You got your troubles and I got em too  
There isnt anything I wouldnt do for you  
We stick together and see it through  
Cause youve got a friend in me  
Darling you got a friend in me  
  
Now some other boys might be little bit smarter than I am  
Are bigger and stronger too  
Maybe But none of them  
Is ever gonna love you the way I do  
Its me and you  
  
And as the years go by  
Our friendship will never die  
Youre gonna see its our destiny  
Youve got a friend in me  
Youve got a friend in me  
  
Now some other boys might be little bit smarter than I am  
Are bigger and stronger too  
Maybe But none of them  
Is ever gonna love you the way I do  
Cause its me and you  
  
And as the years go by  
Our friendship will never die  
Youre gonna see its our destiny  
Youve got a friend in me  
Youve got a friend in me  
I you and me you and me  
Youve got a friend in me  
My darling youve got a friend in me
