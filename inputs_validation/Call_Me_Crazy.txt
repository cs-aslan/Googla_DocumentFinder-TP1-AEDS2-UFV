You told me all i would need was a little time  
But getting over you is still such an uphill climb  
I know i ought to be living in the present tense  
But the past i had with you was the last time  
My life made sense  
  
Chorus  
Call me crazyfor hurting this way  
Call me crazygo on and say  
Its a phase im going through  
Call me crazycrazy over you  
  
I know you dont really mean to be so unkind  
But pardon me if im not in the right frame of mind  
To go on hearing how i should start all over again  
Face the future without you  
I wouldnt know how to begin  
  
repeat chorus  
Bridge  
You say Im lost in a fantasy  
But what we had was real to me  
Call me crazy  
  
Go on and say  
Its a phase Im going through  
Call me crazycrazy over you  
Call me crazy
