Its your move  
Im in pain  
Im a pawn  
In your game  
Its your life  
I just happen to be in it for a while  
  
Oh youre lovin me to death  
Youre killin me with kindness  
Whats behind this sudden tenderness  
  
Youre lovin me to death  
And leavin me to die  
You make me wanna scream  
But my tongue is tied  
You played me like a toy  
You made my life a mess  
Everybody knows  
Youre lovin me to death  
  
When you touch  
Can you feel  
Is your heart  
Only made of steel  
When you cry  
Do you ever let emotions  
Break your stride  
  
Oh you take away my breath  
Your unexpected hunger  
Makes me wonder  
What the hell comes next  
  
Youre lovin me to death  
And leavin me to die  
You make me wanna scream  
But my tongue is tied  
You played me like a toy  
You made my life a mess  
Everybody knows  
Youre lovin me to death  
  
Youre lovin me to death  
And leavin me to die  
You make me wanna scream  
But my tongue is tied  
You played me like a toy  
You made my life a mess  
Everybody knows  
Youre lovin me to death  
Youre lovin me to death  
And leavin me to die  
You make me wanna scream  
But my tongue is tied  
You played me like a toy  
You made my life a mess  
Everybody knows  
Youre lovin me to death
