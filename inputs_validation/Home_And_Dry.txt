So my babys on the road  
Doing business selling loads  
Charming everyone there  
With the sweetest smile  
  
Chorus  
Oh tonight  
I miss you  
Oh tonight  
I wish you  
Could be here with me  
But I wont see you  
til youve made it back again  
  
Home and dry  
Home and dry  
  
Theres a plane at JFK  
To fly you back from far away  
All those dark and frantic  
Transatlantic miles  
  
Chorus  
  
Home and dry  
Home and dry  
  
Far away  
Through night and day  
You fly long haul tonight  
Come to me  
You know Ill be here  
When you call tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
Home and dry  
Home and dry
