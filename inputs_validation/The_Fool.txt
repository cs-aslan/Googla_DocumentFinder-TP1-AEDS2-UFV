Alive in an ocean  
A world that I didnt see  
I walk the world back ways  
Its aways the same ballgame  
  
Thats out of mind  
Out of the living world  
Out of time  
I break all the rules  
  
They call me a fool  
I cartoon in motion  
A hero pretends no pain  
A clown slipping backwards  
  
You laugh at anothers shame  
But I dont mind  
I know Im limping low down  
I dont mind  
  
Winners or losers  
Its all just a game  
And Im going down  
And Im strolling down  
  
Life and an answer  
The key to an open door  
Admitting Im laughing  
Living Im limping more  
  
Its out of mind  
Out of the living world  
Out of time  
Winners or losers  
  
Its always a game  
And Im going down  
But Im strolling down  
To rout around  
  
And around and around  
To round round  
Theres a cloud  
Theres a cloud  
  
So the fool has found the golden key  
So its waiting there for you and me  
Just a fool a street jester  
The hero of society  
  
Just a fool a street jester  
Look at me now cant you see  
A life in emotion  
A world Im glad I didnt see  
  
A cartoon in motion  
A key to the same day  
I dont mind Im here to know  
I want to go go go go go  
  
So the fool has found the golden key  
Its so its waiting there for you and me  
Just a fool a street jester  
The hero of society  
  
Just a fool a street jester  
Look at me now cant you see
