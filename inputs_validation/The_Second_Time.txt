Dont start to fumble it up  
Just do it  
Go go  
Dont wanna know about vacations in this cheap motel  
Dont wanna know about your sea green curtains  
cause all I want and all I need is just some time with you  
Dont complicate it just do it once again  
Just go for it  
Just go for the second time  
Just go for it just go just go  
Dont wanna hear about the time and how its gettin late  
How can you stop when I could go for hours  
You need some magic come on let me lean on you  
Dont look around youre not goin anywhere  
Just go for it  
Just go for the second time  
Just go for it just go just go for it  
All I need and all I need  
cause all I want and all I need  
Im never letting go baby dont expect me to  
How can you stop when my whole worlds exploding  
Look in the mirrors and see the heat of something new  
Why dont we do it just do it once again  
Just go for it  
Just go for the second time  
Just go for it just go for it  
Dont be so nervous  
Dont get so hot  
Dont start to fumble it up  
cause all I want and all I need  
Theres such an urgency in everything I need from you  
Stop giving up you know you cant refuse me  
Ive every reason to believe theres still a man in you  
You done it once so come on go again  
Just go for it  
Just go for the second time  
Just go for it just go  
Just go for it just go  
Just go for it just go  
Just go for it
