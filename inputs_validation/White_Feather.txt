When I hit the streets back in 81  
Found a heart in the gutter and a poets crown  
I felt barbed wire kisses and icicle tears  
Where have I been for all these years  
I saw political intrigue political lies  
Gonna wipe those smiles of selfsatisfaction from their eyes  
  
I will wear your white feather  
I will carry your white flag  
I will swear I have no nation  
But Im proud to own my heart  
I will wear your white feather  
I will carry your white flag  
I will swear I have no nation  
But Im proud to own my heart  
My heart this is my heart  
  
We dont need no uniforms we have no disguise  
Divided we stand together well rise  
  
We will wear your white feather  
We will carry your white flag  
We will swear we have no nations  
But were proud to own our hearts  
We will wear your white feather  
We will carry your white flag  
We will swear we have no nations  
But were proud to own our hearts  
These are our hearts  
These are our hearts  
You cant take away our hearts  
You cant steal our hearts away  
I cant walk away  
No more
