I keep hangin on the promise of love  
Your eyes tell me that Im gonna see  
I feel the hunger like a starving man  
Honey when you stand close to me  
  
I start to shiver I start to shake  
Chills up an down my spine  
Im in the mood for action  
In need of satisfaction  
Babe Im gonna make you mine  
  
Now I believe in you  
An everything that you do  
Cause Im hungry for love  
Im hungry for love Im hungry for love  
I cant get enough I cant get enough I cant get enough  
  
Ive got the weakness of an ordinary man  
I need the comfort of womanly mind  
But I get nervous when I think about  
So many women an so little time  
  
But I believe in you  
An everything you do  
Cause Im hungry for love  
Im hungry for love Im hungry for love  
I cant get enough I cant get enough I cant get enough  
  
I start to shiver I start to shake  
Chills up an down my spine  
I get so nervous when I think about  
So many women an not enough time  
  
But I believe in you  
An everything that you do  
Cause Im hungry for love  
Im hungry for love Im hungry for love  
I cant get enough I cant get enough I cant get enough  
Im hungry for love Im hungry for love Im hungry for love  
I cant get enough I cant get enough I cant get enough  
I cant get enough I cant get enough I cant get enough  
  
Im hungry for love
