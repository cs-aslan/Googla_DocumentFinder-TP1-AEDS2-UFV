I got the  
I got them love sick blues yall  
Man I cant find my baby  
I think she took off with another man  
I been around the world looking twice  
  
You know I checked in New York City  
On the streets and on the subways  
And I looked around that tired town to find the one who loved me  
I looked out in the Hamptons thought shed be hangin with them rich folks  
But no she wasnt anywhere hangin on the east coast  
  
I wish my baby come home  
I want my baby come home  
I wish my baby come home  
I want my baby yeah my baby to come back home  
Man you know I love that girl  
  
I checked down to the Southern plains from Alabama to Georgia  
Honey if you hear this please know Im looking for ya  
I checked with all my rebel friends  
Ive looked around for weeks  
And I swear until I find her I wont eat and I wont sleep  
  
I want my baby come home  
I want my baby come home  
I want my baby come home  
I wish my baby yeah my baby would come back home  
  
I went from Albuquerque to Maine and didnt find a damn thing  
So I looked in California  up and down the coast  
I looked all over Hollywood  it wasnt even close  
Never found nothin  
So I came home home to Detroit City  
And there she was sittin on my porch  My baby looked so pretty  
  
Now my babys back home  
Yea my baby came home  
Yea my babys back home  
Im so happy that my baby is finally home
