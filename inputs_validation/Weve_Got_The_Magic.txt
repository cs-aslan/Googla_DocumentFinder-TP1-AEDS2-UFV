All I need is a place in my heart  
To keep me happy til the day I die  
All I want is a place in my soul  
To reach up far and touch the sky  
Its magic  
Weve got the smile thatll make you laugh ha  
A special way to show you its real  
Some people think its a touch of class  
But you know its just the way we feel  
Its magic  
Weve got the magic deep in our souls  
Weve got the magic to play rocknroll  
Weve got the magic to never grow old  
Cant you hear the sound in the air  
Cant wait to show this magic inside  
Gonna bust out and spread it wide  
Cant you hear what were trying to say  
Feelings gettin stronger everyday  
Its magic  
Weve got the magic deep in our souls  
Weve got the magic to play rocknroll  
Weve got the magic to never grow old  
Cant you hear the sound in the air whoa yeah  
Weve got the magic deep in our souls yeah  
Weve got the magic to play rocknroll  
Weve got the magic well never grow old  
Weve got the magic

Youve got the magic  
So take it on home  
Weve got the magic deep in our souls  
Weve got the magic to play rocknroll
