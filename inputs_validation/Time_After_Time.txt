What good are words I say to you  
They cant convey to you whats in my heart  
If you could hear instead  
The things Ive left unsaid  
  
Time after time  
I tell myself that Im  
So lucky to be loving you  
  
So lucky to be  
The one you run to see  
In the evening when the day is through  
  
I only know what I know  
The passing years will show  
Youve kept my love so young so new  
  
And time after time  
Youll hear me say that Im  
So lucky to be loving you  
  
I only know what I know  
The passing years will show  
Youve kept my love so young so new  
  
And time after time  
Youll hear me say that Im  
So lucky to be loving you  
Lucky to be loving you
