Nows not the time to say goodbye  
And Im not the kind to question why  
Well I dont feel very well and its getting cold as hell  
It wont be the same cant you tell  
  
Dont leave me alone  
Dont leave me on my own  
Im so afraid  
Why cant you stay  
Just dont leave me alone  
How long will my song be wrong  
  
Doing the things I should have known  
Only to reap what I have sown  
Jesus please  
  
Dont leave me alone  
Dont leave me on my own  
Im on my knees  
Forgive me please  
Just dont leave me alone  
How long will my song be wrong  
  
keyboard solo  
  
Dont leave me alone  
Dont leave me on my own  
Im so afraid  
Why cant you stay  
Just dont leave dont leave Me alone  
How long will my song Be Wrong
