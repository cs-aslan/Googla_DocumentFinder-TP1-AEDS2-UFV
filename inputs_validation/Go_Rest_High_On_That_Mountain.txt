I know your life  
On earth was troubled  
And only you could know the pain  
You werent afraid to face the devil  
You were no stranger to the rain  
  
Go rest high on that mountain  
Sonyour work on earth is done  
Go to heaven ashoutin  
Love for the Father and the Son  
  
Ohhow we cried the day you left us  
We gathered round your grave to grieve  
I wish I could see the angels faces  
When they hear your sweet voice sing  
  
Go rest high on that mountain  
Sonyour work on earth is done  
Go to heaven ashoutin  
Love for the Father and the Son
