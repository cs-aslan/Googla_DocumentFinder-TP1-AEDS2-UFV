I work all day and I work all night 4x  
I work all day and I work all night  
I work so my wife and kids will have a pleasant life  
I work as many jobs as I can  
Im proud to work I guess Im just a working man  
who am I to complain  
I live in the lap of luxury  
I got a car and a big tv thats so fine  
I go to the pictures when I can  
the pictures take me to faraway lands  
almost makes me forget who I am  
Sometimes at work Ive a fantasy  
That Im a man who livesa life of mystery  
but then the whistle brings me to  
I cant forget why Im here Ive got a job to do  
Responsibility is much more important to a man like me  
I work all day and I work all night  
I work all day and I work all night  etc etc  
Guitar solo  
I got a job at the factory  
But I dont mind cause I know that the job is right for me  
I dont complain Im satisfied  
And I dont care to rub elbows with the wealthy  
Theyve got their problems too I dont envy them a bit dont ya know  
Im doin what I want and it aint so bas  
Ive got everything that a man could have  
Im living in the lap of luxury  living in the lap of luxury  
Work all day and I work all night  
I work all day and I work all night etc etc
