Funny sometimes how you let  
The little things  
Get in your way  
Funny how you just cant talk  
Although sometimes  
Youve got so much to say  
Silly when you know youve got the thing  
That everybody  
Needs so bad  
Stupid if you let those jealous people  
Telling lies  
Make you sad  
  
I thought I heard a voice  
Telling me go home  
No need to run no more  
Neednt be alone  
  
I dont care what you do  
Im coming back  
I can look forward too  
Im coming back  
  
Crazy feelings that you get  
Sometimes they make you  
Want to run away  
The provocation that you let  
Overcome you  
When you ought to stay  
  
I thought I saw her face  
In every single crowd  
I heard her voice again  
Calling me aloud  
  
I dont care what you do  
Im coming back  
I can look forward too  
Im coming back  
  
I thought I never could  
Return where I belong  
But with her waiting there  
I knew I could be strong  
  
I dont care what you do  
Im coming back  
I can look forward too  
Im coming back  
I dont care what you do  
Im coming back  
I can look forward too  
Im coming back
