When Im all alone dreaming of where I want to go again  
Oh tell me  
Tell me youll never ever change  
Taprobane so Far away  
  
And you saved me I was wounded  
You saw it and delivered unto me an extraordinary day  
And its morning you were golden like sunshine  
Discovered when you came extraordinary day  
  
With the passing days  
My vision of you will never fade  
Its going on  
And I know  
Your love was there right from the start  
Taprobane still in my heart  
  
And you saved me I was wounded  
You saw it and delivered unto me an extraordinary day  
And its morning you were golden like sunshine  
Discovered when you came extraordinary day  
  
And I swim in your waters  
I took in your beauty  
I looked at the sunset and the fireworks display  
My only regret is  
That when we first met I never ever got your name  
  
You saved me I was wounded  
You saw it and delivered unto me an extraordinary day  
And its morning you were golden like sunshine  
Discovered when you came extraordinary day  
  
Oooh oooh oooh extraordinary day  
Oooh oooh oooh extraordinary day  
Oooh oooh oooh extraordinary day  
Oooh oooh oooh extraordinary day
