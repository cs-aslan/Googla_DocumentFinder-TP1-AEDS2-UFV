Verse  
Do you know how it feels  
To have come so far  
Just to get shot down  
And left to drown  
Cause Ive come so far  
And I need you now  
Yes its true  
So pull me through  
  
And get me out of this  
  
Prechorus 1  
I never hurt you  
Baby tell me is it what I didnt do  
Id never hurt you yeah  
Without you Im  
  
Chorus  
Asphyxiated  
Im dying please give me one last breath oh  
To pull me through it  
Please just give me one last breath while  
Im contemplating and Im wondering  
If you gave me one last breath oh  
Would I suffocate again  
  
Im suffocating  
  
Prechorus 2  
You were my everything  
Everything that I ever wanted  
But youve got me wounded again  
Without you Im  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
So are you gonna watch me die  
Or just walk on by  
Dont tell me you dont need me  
Cause I know you do  
  
Give me one last try  
And Ill get it right  
I swear Ill get it right  
This time  
  
Chorus
