Let me tell you babe  
You got me crazy  
You got your head in  
Those big white clouds  
  
Let me tell you babe  
You got me crazy  
You dont know girl  
What lifes all about  
  
Let me tell you babe  
You must be dreaming  
The world aint spinning  
Just for you alone  
  
Let me tell you babe  
You must be dreaming  
Cause its rough girl  
Out there on your own  
  
And love thats worth your salt  
Dont grow on trees  
It wont show upon  
Every breeze that blows  
  
It beats me honey  
How your eyes dont see  
They just dont see whats  
Right in front of your nose  
  
Let me tell you babe  
You just aint thinking  
The grass aint greener  
On that side of town  
  
Let me tell you babe  
You know I need you  
If you stay girl  
I wont let you down  
  
Let me tell you babe  
If you stay girl  
Let me tell you babe  
I wont let you down  
  
Let me tell you babe  
If you stay girl  
Let me tell you babe  
I wont let you down
