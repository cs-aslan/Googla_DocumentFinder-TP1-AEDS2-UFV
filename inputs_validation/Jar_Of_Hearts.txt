I know I cant take one more step towards you  
Cause all thats waiting is regret  
Dont you know Im not your ghost anymore  
You lost the love I loved the most  
  
I learned to live half alive  
And now you want me one more time  
  
Chorus  
Who do you think you are  
Runnin round leaving scars  
Collecting your jar of hearts  
And tearing love apart  
Youre gonna catch a cold  
From the ice inside your soul  
So dont come back for me  
Who do you think you are  
  
I hear youre asking all around  
If I am anywhere to be found  
But I have grown too strong  
To ever fall back in your arms  
  
Ive learned to live half alive  
And now you want me one more time  
  
Chorus  
  
It took so long just to feel alright  
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes  
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed  
Cause you broke all your promises  
And now youre back  
You dont get to get me back  
  
Who do you think you are  
Runnin round leaving scars  
Collecting your jar of hearts  
And tearing love apart  
Youre gonna catch a cold  
From the ice inside your soul  
Dont come back for me  
Dont come back at all  
  
Who do you think you are  
Runnin round leaving scars  
Collecting your jar of hearts  
Tearing love apart  
Youre gonna catch a cold  
From the ice inside your soul  
Dont come back for me  
Dont come back at all  
  
Who do you think you are  
Who do you think you are  
Who do you think you are
