Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man  
So we spell out the words we dont want him to understand  
Like TOY or maybe SURPRICE  
But the words were hiding from him now  
Tear the heart right out of me  
Our DIVORCE becomes final today  
Me and little JOE will be goin away  
I love you both and this will be pure HE double L for me  
Oh I wish that we could stop this DIVORCE  
Watch him smile he thinks its Christmas  
Or his 5th Birthday and he thinks CUSTODY spells fun or play  
I spell out all the hurtin words and turn my head when I speak  
Cause I cant spell away this hurt thats drippin down my cheek  
Our DIVORCE becomes final today  
Me and little JOE will be goin away  
I love you both and this will be pure HE double L for me  
Oh I wish that we could stop this DIVORCE
