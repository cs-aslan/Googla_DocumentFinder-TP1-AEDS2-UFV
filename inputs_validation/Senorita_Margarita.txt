She left more than just her lipstick  
When she walked out  
Her memory keeps haunting me  
Thats why Im hunting you down  
  
Its been a long time since our lips met  
Youve always been good at helping me forget  
Ill regret it in the morning but thats not stopping me now  
  
Senorita Margarita  
Im as lonesome as a man can be  
I still love her I still need her  
Im just hopin you can comfort me  
I dont want to do her wrong  
I dont need somebody new  
I just cant be alone tonight  
So Senorita Margarita  
Let me hold you tight  
  
She always comes to her senses  
With some space and time  
And youre just what I needed  
To pull off this hot head of mine  
  
I hope you realize this is a one night stand  
Im gonna get her back I know I can  
So lets keep this between you me the salt and the lime  
  
Senorita Margarita  
Im as lonesome as a man can be  
I still love her I still need her  
Im just hopin you can comfort me  
I dont want to do her wrong  
I dont need somebody new  
I just cant be alone tonight  
So Senorita Margarita  
Let me hold you tight
