Cant stand  
The way you look  
The way you talk  
The way you act  
Cant stand you  
  
Do I think  
Youre a dick  
Yeah  
Youre a fuck  
Yeah  
Well fight  
Yeah  
  
Do I think youll win  
No  
  
Do I think youre stupid  
Yeah  
Do I think youre lame  
Yeah  
Am I stressing  
Youre the one to blame  
  
I open my mouth at the wrong time  
Always ranking on somebody  
Im drunk all the time  
Throwing beer bottles and spitting in your face  
Checking through the purse  
Of the slut in our place  
  
Shell never notice if her money is gone  
Piss in her jacket  
And just send her along
