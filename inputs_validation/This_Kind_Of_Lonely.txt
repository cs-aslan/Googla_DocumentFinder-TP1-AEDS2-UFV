Sitting alone tonight rain falling on my window sill  
Just want to do whats right but I dont know if I ever will  
Theres so many reasons too many excuses  
And all these prescriptions got too many uses  
Im so lonely its kinda scary  
This kind of lonely is making me weary  
Im so lonesome I could die  
Sitting alone tonight waiting for the sunshine  
Sometimes I kneel and pray hoping someday that youll be mine  
But shes so many miles away Ive got so many things to say  
And all of the games wed play dont matter anyway  
Cause Im so lonely the sex is empty  
This kind of lonely its so easy to tempt me  
Im so lonesome I could die Im so lonesome I could die  
Sitting alone tonight waiting for somebody to call  
Think if Im up and died would nobody notice at all  
Cause Im so insecure and I feel so unsure  
Cant take it anymore its never been like this before  
And Im so lonely I feel like crying  
This kind of lonely is worse than dying  
Im so lonesome I could die Im so lonesome I could die  
Im so lonesome I could die
