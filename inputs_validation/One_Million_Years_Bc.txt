There calling me creatures of the night beautiful music  
Animal instinct survived the serpents tongue  
So ancient before the dawn of time like the rock of ages  
Im the blood of mankind  
Oooohhh Ive seen it all  
Oooohhh from grace men fall babylon curse of all creation  
Winged serpent of the pit monstrosity  
One million years bc one million years bc one million years bc  
Ten thousand centuries ago cast down from heaven to pilage below  
The serpents eyes still watching for its easy prey  
Feed upon the hopeless the weak and afraid  
Oooohhh Ive seen it all  
Oooohhh from grace men fall babylon curse of all creation  
Winged serpent of the pit monstrosity  
One million years bc one million years bc one million years bc
