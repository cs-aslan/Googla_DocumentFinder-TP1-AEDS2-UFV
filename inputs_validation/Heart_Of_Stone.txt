Can you hear me  
Now Ive found you  
Standing there in the lonely night  
Many times I  
Tried to reach you  
But you closed your doors  
And you closed them tight  
Come down before its too late  
Anyone can see youre just  
Looking in your eyes  
Tell me youre satisfied  
With the price you must pay  
Everyday everyday  
  
Chorus  
Heart of stone  
Heart of stone  
You cant make it on your own  
Heart of stone  
Heart of stone  
You cant make it all alone  
Breaking this heart of stone  
  
Are you dreaming lost forever  
In the fantasy  
That world of your own  
Time is passing now or never  
Cant you see youre  
A long way from home  
Wake up its been too long  
Wont you see that  
It cant go wrong  
Just cant understand why  
You make it this way  
Everyday everyday  
  
Chorus  
  
Ever wonder whoever thinks its right  
To fill the empty  
Place inside of you never do  
Ever wonder when youre turning round  
If everything you need to know  
Is what youre learning from  
Its to you yeah yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Heart of stone
