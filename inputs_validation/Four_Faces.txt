They kicked me out Repeat x4  
  
You mustve heard of them a kind of screwedup blend  
Split personality  
Two sides to fight and argue all night  
over coffee or tea  
  
Well thats okay I wouldnt mind two say  
or even three and thats no joke  
But with a fourway split the pocket moneys hit  
And all of me is broke  
  
I got four heads inside my mind  
Four rooms Id like to lie in  
Four selves I want to find  
And I dont know which one is me  
  
I get four papers in the box each day  
Four girls ringing that Im trying to date  
I look in the mirror and see my face  
But I dont know which one is me I dont know which one is me  
  
He kicked me out He kicked me out  
He kicked me out He kicked me out  
  
I wake up over here and then Im over here  
Im trying to brush my teeth  
Its little things that are hard  
Like starting up the car when Im still underneath  
  
I get along alright in fact its fun at night  
I get fourdimensional dreams  
But I have to think before I take a drink  
I get hungover times sixteen  
  
There are four records I want to buy  
Four highs Id like to try  
Every letter I get I send four replies  
And they dont know which ones from me  
  
Ive got four hangups Im trying to beat  
Four directions and just two feet  
Ive got a very very secret identity  
And I dont know which one is me  
  
You think its funny I can tell  
Well you dont understand too well  
I get so lonely and turned around  
But I cant let it bring me down  
  
I got four hangups Im trying to beat  
Four directions and just two feet  
Got a very very secret identity  
And I dont know which one is me
