Drive west on Sunset  
To the sea  
Turn that jungle music down  
Just until were out of town  
  
This is no one night stand  
Its a real occasion  
Close your eyes and youll be there  
Its everything they say  
  
The end of a perfect day  
Distant lights from across the bay  
Babylon sisters shake it  
Babylon sisters shake it  
  
So fine so young  
Tell me Im the only one  
  
Here come those Santa Ana winds again  
  
Well jog with show folk on the sand  
Drink kirschwasser from a shell  
San Francisco show and tell  
Well I should know by now  
  
That its just a spasm  
Like a Sunday in TJ  
That its cheap but its not free  
That Im not what I used to be  
And that loves not a game for three  
  
Babylon sisters shake it  
Babylon sisters shake it  
So fine so young  
Tell me Im the only one  
  
My friends say no dont go  
For that cotton candy  
Son youre playing with fire  
The kid will live and learn  
As he watches his bridges burn  
From the point of no return  
  
Babylon sisters shake it  
Babylon sisters shake it  
So fine so young  
Tell me Im the only one
