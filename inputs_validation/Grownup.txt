I stood in the doorway in my white nightgown  
Red roses on cotton I stood three feet from the ground  
the grownups inside used words I didnt know  
But still I enjoyed the show  
  
They looked so lovely they looked so selfassured  
And I just like them would know it all when I matured  
And I wouldnt be afraid of the darkness or the bears  
Or the cracks in the ceiling upstairs  
  
Now Ive just gotten older Ive just gotten taller  
And the little ones they call me a grownup  
  
Lat night at a friends house a little girl was there  
She stood in the doorway playing with her hair  
She looked up to me as if I could do no wrong  
As I got up to sing my song  
  
I sang it with a shiver in my throat and in my knees  
Feeling just as small as a thistle in a breeze  
But the childs imagination carried me along  
And saw me through my song  
  
Now Ive just gotten older Ive just gotten taller  
And the little ones call me a grownup
