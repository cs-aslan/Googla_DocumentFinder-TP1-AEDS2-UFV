She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress  
Summer tanned pretty little perfect mess  
With a story that could only be anybodys guess  
And I was thinking that I probably didnt stand a chance  
But I rolled up my sleeves walked up and I said  
Hey I dont know you but Id kinda like a shot  
She said I saw you comin over I already thought it over  
And OK so now what  
  
And I said well I got a car she said theres something  
At least its a start I said its better than nothing  
I aint in no hurry but Im ready when you are  
And she said where do you think all this is going  
I said there aint no way of knowing  
I guess I hadnt thought it through that far  
But I got a car  
  
So we let the wheels turn and the windows down  
We let ourselves go all the way through town  
She never said stop and I never asked her why  
We drove into the night when outta nowhere  
She said Id give anything to never go back there  
And I kinda wish this day would never end  
She said I could use a change but I dont even know where  
  
And I said well I got a car she said theres something  
At least its a start I said its better than nothing  
I aint in no hurry but Im ready when you are  
And she said where do you think all this is going  
I said there aint no way of knowing  
I really hadnt thought it through that far  
And I cant promise you the moon and stars  
But I got a car  
  
We got lost in the miles lost track of the days  
Til we finally found a stopping place  
When the doctors said you know whats on the way  
And we found ourselves in a little white house  
One Sunday morning rain pouring down  
She said I think its time but all the lines are out  
  
And her eyes teared up and she said what are we gonna do now  
And I said well I got a car she said theres something  
You think itll start I said its already running  
Got your things in the back and Im ready when you are  
She said are you sure itll get us where were goin  
I said if theres one thing I know girl its gotten us this far  
And I dont mean to hurry but Im ready when you are
