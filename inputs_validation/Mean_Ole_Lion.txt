Say what you wanna  
But Im here to stay  
cause Im a mean ole lion  
You can go where youre gonna  
But dont get in my way  
Im a mean ole lion  
  
Youll be standing in a draft  
If you dont hear me laugh  
And if you happen to come around  
Well you best not make me frown  
For I just might knock you down  
Im a mean ole lion  
  
You know Im ready to fight  
And turn your day into night  
cause Im a mean ole lion  
If youre half bright  
Youll detour to the right  
From a mean ole lion  
  
All you strangers better beware  
This is the king of the jungle here  
And if I happen to let you slide  
Dont just stand here  
Run and hide  
You just caught my better side  
  
Im a mean ole lion  
  
Look  
You better beware  
This is the king of the jungle here  
And if I happen to let you slide  
Dont stand here  
Run and hide  
You just caught my better side  
  
Im a mean ole lion  
Im a mean ole lion
