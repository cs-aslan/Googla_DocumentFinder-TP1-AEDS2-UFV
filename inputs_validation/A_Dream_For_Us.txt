Lately Ive been sleeping  
Far too long in bed  
Ive been dreaming of you lover  
Oh the things inside my head  
  
I dont want to wake up  
Im scared to break the spell  
Oh Im sleeping like a baby  
I hope you sleep so well  
  
You know Im hoping hoping  
  
Bridge  
I know theres a dream for us  
I know theres a dream for us  
I know theres a dream for us  
Been on our minds  
I know theres a dream for us  
I know theres a dream for us  
I know theres a dream for us  
Were gonna find  
  
Chorus  
I know theres a dream for us  
I believe its true  
In a word love you  
And Im hoping our dream comes true  
  
You know Im hoping hoping  
Miracles and moonbeams wishes on a star  
These are things I dream of I know it sounds bizarre  
I see familiar faces or is it deja vu  
The one recurring vision  
Is a dream I have of you  
  
You know Im hoping hoping  
Repeat bridge  
Come on now baby  
  
Chorus  
  
When you find someone you find someone you love  
You know you cant believe it  
When you find someone you know you cant deceive it  
Your love takes you high  
  
I know theres a dream for us  
Im sure theres a dreams for us  
  
Chorus
