The fisherman comes up  
Puts his two poles in the sand  
He stares out at the sea  
Just exactly like me  
But Ive got a book in my hand  
We will have caught on to something by the end of the day  
But mostly we think about the one that got away  
  
Ive seen like a bird  
What pleasures the surface can bring  
Ive lost my best craft  
Going foolishly back  
To where to Sirens sing  
Ive stared up at the place where the water meets the sky  
And though I stopped breathing I still believe I should try  
Maybe a boat in search of lost treasures will pass by  
  
Cause the fleet of hope is so pretty  
When shes shining in the port  
And the harbor clings to the jetty  
For protection and support  
Out in the choppy waters the sharks swim and play  
Youre all washed up when Poseidon has his day  
  
Ive walked through the desert  
Climbed over mountains so high  
Through jungles and plains  
I took buses and trains  
And airplanes across the sky  
But none as seductive as ocean before me alone  
And now I know why  
You layered your pockets with stones  
  
Cause the fleet of hope is so pretty  
When shes shining in the port  
And the harbor clings to the jetty  
For protection and support  
Out in the choppy waters the sharks swim and play  
Youre all washed up when Poseidon has his day  
  
When I was a girl  
All of my fancy took flight  
And I had this dream  
Could outshine anything  
Even the darkest night  
Now I wait like a widow for someone to come back from sea  
Ive always known  
I was waiting for me  
  
Cause the fleet of hope is so pretty  
When shes shining in the port  
And the harbor clings to the jetty  
For protection and support  
Out in the choppy waters the sharks swim and play  
Youre all washed up when Poseidon has his day
