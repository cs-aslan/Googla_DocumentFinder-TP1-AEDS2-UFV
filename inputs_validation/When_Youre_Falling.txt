Every day you crawl into the night  
A fallen angel with your wings set alight  
When you hit the ground  
Everything turns to blue  
I cant get through the smoke  
Thats surrounding you  
  
Cause when youre fallin  
I cant tell which way is down  
And when youre screaming  
Somehow I dont hear a sound  
  
And when youre seeing things  
Then your feet dont touch the ground  
Cause when youre falling  
I cant tell which way is down  
  
I can see through the clouds  
I can walk right through the walls  
Hang me off the ceiling  
But I cant take the fall  
  
Should I cross the river  
When I may get swept away  
Out there on the water  
You can still see me wave  
  
Cause when youre falling  
I cant tell which way is down  
When youre falling  
I cant tell which way is down  
  
I can see all those things  
My feet dont touch the ground  
  
Cause when youre falling  
I cant tell which way is down  
And when youre screaming  
Somehow I dont hear a sound  
  
And when youre seeing things  
Then youre feet dont touch the ground  
Cause when youre falling  
Somehow I cant hear a sound  
  
Somehow I dont hear a sound  
Falling
