Got a crazy feeling I dont understand  
Gotta get away from here  
Feelin like I shoulda kept my feet on the ground  
Waitin for the sun to appear  
  
Mammas gonna worry  
I been a bad bad boy  
No use sayin sorry  
Its somethin that I enjoy  
  
Cause you cant see what my eyes see  
I can see it I can see it  
And you cant be inside of me flying high again  
  
I can see through mountains watch me disappear  
I can even touch the sky  
Swallowing colors of the sound I hear  
Am I just a crazy guy You bet  
  
Mammas gonna worry  
I been a bad bad boy  
No use sayin sorry  
Its somethin that I enjoy  
  
If you could be inside my head  
Youd see that black and white is read  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again come on and join me  
  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again come on and join me  
  
Daddy thinks Im lazy he dont understand  
Never saw inside my head  
People think Im crazy but Im in demand  
Never heard a thing I said  
  
Mammas gonna worry  
Ive been a bad bad boy  
No use sayin sorry  
Its somethin I enjoy  
  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again
