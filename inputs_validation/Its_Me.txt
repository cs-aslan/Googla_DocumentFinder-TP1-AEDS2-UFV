You took a firstclass trip to Paris  
You danced in the streets of Spain  
You followed the sun to Rio de Janeiro  
Cuz you got so sick and tired of the  
London rain  
But honey late at night  
When you close your tired eyes  
Youll be there  
And Ill be here  
And one of us will cry  
  
Its me its me  
When you need something more  
Something youre dying for  
Its me its me  
When you cant see too clear  
Baby Im always near  
Its me  
  
You played your cards you felt the sorrow  
Cuz all that dealer dealt was pain  
But baby where you gonna play tomorrow  
The stakes were too damn high  
And now youre broke again  
You can trip around til all your moneys blown  
But whos the man thatll take you in  
When all your luck is gone  
  
Its me its me  
What are you searching for  
I know you can find my door  
Its me its me  
I know youve sinned every sin  
But Ill still take you in  
Its me  
  
And me Im sitting here  
Nothing much has changed  
You broke my heart to pieces babe  
But thats nothing strange  
Well I aint angry  
Thats all come and gone  
My arms are still open wide girl  
To catch you when you fall  
  
And if someday you realize  
Just where you belong  
Im the man thatll take you in  
When all your luck is gone  
Its me its me  
  
When you need something more  
Something youre dying for  
Its me its me  
When you cant see too clear  
Baby Im always near  
  
Its me its me  
What are you searching for  
I know you can find my door  
Its me its me  
I know youve sinned every sin  
But Ill still take you in  
Its me  
Yeah baby its me
