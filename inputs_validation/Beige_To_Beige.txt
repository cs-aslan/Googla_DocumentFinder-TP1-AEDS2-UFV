No songs on the stereo  
That we could sing with anymore  
No dance that I can do  
That would not embarrass you  
A sound bite here and there  
With no reason for me to care  
  
Chorus  
Its just beige to beige  
Thats all it is these days  
Little windows for you to crawl through  
You just do whats expected of you  
Its just beige to beige to beige  
These days  
  
Uniforms for this and that  
To be in our club you must wear this hat  
Charlies gonna look out for you  
You just do what youre supposed to do  
Youre gonna fit in here  
Just like you should  
Learn the rules and learn them good  
  
Chorus  
Its just beige to beige  
Thats all it is these days  
Little windows for you to crawl through  
You just do whats expected of you  
Its just beige to beige to beige  
These days  
  
If you need a thought  
Well give it to you  
Our statistics show what we do is true  
A world without color  
Is a world without sound  
A world to keep the rabble down  
So close the deal close the door  
Forget about the colors that you knew before  
  
Chorus  
  
Its just beige to beige  
Thats all it is these days yeah  
Little windows for you to crawl through  
And Charlie gonna take care of you  
Its just beige to beige to beige  
These days
