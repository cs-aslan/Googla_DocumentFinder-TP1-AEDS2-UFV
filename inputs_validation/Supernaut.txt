I want to reach out and touch the sky  
I want to touch the sun  
But I dont need to fly  
Im gonna climb up every mountain of the moon  
And find the dish that ran away with the spoon  
  
Ive crossed the ocean turned every bend  
I found the crossing near a golden rainbows end  
Ive been through magic and through lifes reality  
Ive lived a thousand years and it never bothered me  
  
Got no religion dont need no friends  
Got all I want and I dont need to pretend  
Dont try to reach me cause Id tear up your mind  
Ive seen the future and Ive left it behind
