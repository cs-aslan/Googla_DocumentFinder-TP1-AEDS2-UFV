I wrote the words of freedom  
Ive even sung the song  
But freedom is for children  
cause they dont understand whats wrong  
  
The children are so very lucky  
cause theyre not old enough to know  
Not old enough to realize  
But theyll find out as they grow  
  
The children are so very lucky  
But on the other hand whos gonna save the land  
The children are so very lucky  
But mans invention is gonna be the prevention of their life  
  
This song is nearly over  
And sos the world and the day  
Theres something missin  
But who will listen enough to do what it will take  
  
Freedom is for children why cant it be for me  
Freedom is for children why cant it be for me  
  
Freedom is for children why cant it be for me  
Freedom is for children why cant it be for me  
Freedom is for children why cant it be for me
