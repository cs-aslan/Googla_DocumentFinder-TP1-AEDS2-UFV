Come and hold me  
And dissolve me  
But I never do what I am told to  
You enthuse me  
Dont abuse me  
At the worst of times youll never lose me  
  
There are times when I could fall in love with you  
There are times when I would scream till I was blue  
  
Chorus  
Dont get me wrong  
I can be strong  
When I could fall in love with you  
Dont let me down  
Take me to test  
When I could fall in love with you  
Like a child  
Like a child  
  
I was dreaming  
We were sleeping  
And you held me tight to keep believing  
Dont upset me  
I wont let you  
Fall into a space thats empty  
  
There are times when I could fall in love with you  
There are times when I would scream till I was blue  
  
Chorus  
  
There are times when I could fall in love with you  
There are times when I would scream till I was blue  
  
Chorus x 2
