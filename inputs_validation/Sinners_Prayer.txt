Verse 1  
I came down the mountain  
Draggin our love affair  
Put on a pretty little number  
Im wearing you still  
It was a hell of a scene at daddys feast  
Nobody saw it coming but the little red devil in me  
He has a funny way saying forever too fast  
Dont get mad cant blame a tramp  
For something he dont have  
I get on my knees and beg you  
  
Chorus  
Hear my sinners prayer  
I am what I am  
And I dont wanna break the heart of any other man  
But you but you  
Hear my sinners prayer  
Its the only one I know  
It sure as hell dont rhyme  
But its as good as good as good as good as gold  
Verse 2  
Got a baby sister who looks just like me  
She wants nothing more than a man to please  
Maybe shes in too deep  
Her love for him aint cheap  
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece  
From Fulton Street  
The mans got a gift for getting what he wants  
Hes thirsty when he drinks  
Gets on the brink and throws her off  
I get on my knees and beg you  
  
Chorus  
Hear my sinners prayer  
I am what I am  
And I dont wanna break the heart of any other man  
But you but you  
Hear my sinners prayer  
Its the only one I know  
It sure as hell dont rhyme  
But its as good as good as good as good as gold  
Good as good as good as good as gold  
  
Bridge  
I can carry you but not your ghosts  
Wish I had the faith but I dont know oh  
  
Chorus  
Hear my sinners prayer  
I am what I am  
And I dont wanna break the heart of any other man  
But you but you  
Hear my sinners prayer  
Its the only one I know  
It sure as hell dont rhyme  
But its as good as good as good as good as gold  
Good as good as good as good as gold  
Good as good as good as good as gold
