Take me back to a south Tallahassee  
Down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy  
Cant stand up on my feet in the city  
Got to get back to the real nitty gritty  
  
Yes sir no sir  
Dont come close to my  
Home sweet home  
Cant catch no dose  
Of my hot tail poontang sweatheart  
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse  
From a J Paul Getty and his ear  
With a face in a beer  
Home sweet home  
  
Get out in the field  
Put the mule in the stable  
Ma shes a cookin  
Put the eats on the table  
Hates in the city and my loves in the meadow  
Hands on the plow and my feets in the ghetto  
  
Stand up sit down  
Dont do nothin  
Aint no good when boss mans stuffin  
Down their throats with paper notes  
As babies cry  
When youre rockin the street  
Home sweet home  
  
Mamma take me home sweet home  
I was the last child just a punk in the street
