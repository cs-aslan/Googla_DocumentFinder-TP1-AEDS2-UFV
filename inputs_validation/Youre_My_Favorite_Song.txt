Words dont come easy without a melody  
Im always thinking in terms of doremi  
I should be hiking swimming laughing with you  
Instead Im all out of tune  
  
But what you dont know  
You lift me off the ground  
Youre inspiration you helped me find myself  
Just like a baseline in halftime  
You hold down the groove  
Thats why Im counting on you  
  
And if I heard you on the radio  
Id never wanna change a single note  
Its what Im trying to say all along  
Youre my favorite song  
  
Im in a session writing tracks  
Youve got another class to teach  
And then rehearsal with a band  
Youre always one step out of reach  
Im looking for some harmony  
With you it comes so naturally  
You helped me find the right key  
  
And when I hear you on the radio  
Id never wanna change a single note  
Its what I tried to say all along  
Youre my favorite song  
  
My favorite song  
  
And when I hear you on the radio yeah yeah  
Id never wanna change a single note no no  
Its what I tried to say all along  
  
Youre my favorite song  
Youre my favorite song
