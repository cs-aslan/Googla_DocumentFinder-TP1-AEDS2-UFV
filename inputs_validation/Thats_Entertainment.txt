Police car with a screaming siren  
Pneumatic drill on rippedup concrete  
Baby wails a stray dog howling  
Brakes screech as lamp light blinking  
  
Thats entertainment  
Thats entertainment  
  
Smash of glass and a rumble of boots  
Electric train and a ripped up phone booth  
A hot day and a sticky black tarmac  
A hot day and Im wishing I was far away  
  
Thats entertainment  
Thats entertainment  
La la la  
La la la  
  
Days of speed and a slow time Mondays  
Wake up at six am and think about your holidays  
Open window and breathe in petrol  
Cold flat with damp on the walls  
  
Yes thats entertainment  
Thats entertainment  
La la la  
La la la  
La la la  
La la la  
  
Two lovers kissing over screams of midnight  
Two lovers miss the tranquility of solitude  
Read graffiti of slashseat affairs  
Splattered walls and a kick in the balls  
  
Is all that you get  in the name of entertainment  
La la la  
La la la
