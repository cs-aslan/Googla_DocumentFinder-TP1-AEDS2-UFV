Ive known some women in every state  
New York City to the Golden Gate  
Ive lived with some and buddy I loved em all Yes I did  
But no one woman had a claim on me  
Cause I still had a lotta world to see  
And I sometimes stagger but sugar I seldom fall  
Then like a hungry man I went to Louisiana  
Where the lovin and the livin was good  
Without a care to hide and just as satisfied as I could be  
A lotta women and wine and not a tie to bind me  
And behaving just as cool as I could  
Til that long legged sweet walkin ravenhaired cajun lookin  
Devil put the sweat on me  
They call her Smokey shes a little bita evil  
Smokey right as wrong can be  
Smokey she could shake the very devil  
Smokey put the sweat on me  
Oh my pulse is a beatin to the clickety clack  
Of this oneway ride thats gonna take me back  
And my bodys just abreathin in that Mississippi River smell  
Well my feet wasnt ready yet for settling down  
But my soul kept tellin me to turn around  
And the longer I tried to fight it the harder I fell  
And like a hungry man I went to Louisiana  
Where the lovin and the livin is good  
Ill get a brand new bride and be as satisfied as I can be  
And I wont even mind the world Im leavin behind  
Because I never really thought that I could  
Til that long legged sweet walkin ravenhaired cajun looking devil  
Put the sweat on me  
They call her Smokey shes a little bita evil  
Smokey right as wrong can be  
Smokey she could shake the very devil  
Smokey put the sweat on me  
Smokey put the sweat on me  
Awww Smokey put the sweat on me
