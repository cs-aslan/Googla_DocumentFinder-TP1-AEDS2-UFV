I will never be I will never be tall no  
And I will never be never ever be sure of it all  
Oh whys the world so cruel to me  
When all all I ever wanna be is anything Im not  
  
Gimme a break a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free I wanna be new and different  
Anything Im not Im not  
  
I will never be I will never be you no  
I will always be I will always be me that I know  
But oh even though Im happy being me  
I want to get away from all this harsh reality oh  
  
Gimme a break a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free I wanna be new and different  
Anything Im not  
  
Yeah gimme a break a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free I wanna be new and different  
Anything Im not anything Im not  
Oh anything Im not  
  
Gimme a break a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free I wanna be new and different  
Anything Im not  
  
Yeah gimme a break a little escape  
I am so tired of being me  
I wanna be free I want to be new and different  
Anything Im not anything Im not  
Anything Im not anything Im not  
Anything Im not
