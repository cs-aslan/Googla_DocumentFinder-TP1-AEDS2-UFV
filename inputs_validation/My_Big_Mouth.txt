Everybody knowsbut no ones saying nothing  
  
And its a sound so very loudthat no one can hear  
  
I got something in my shoesIts keeping me from walking  
  
Down the long and winding roadback home to you  
  
And round this town youve ceased to be  
  
Thats what you got for sleeping with the enemy  
  
Where angels fly you wont play  
  
So guess whos gonna take the blame for  
  
My Big Mouth my big name  
  
Wholl put on my shoes while theyre walking  
  
Slowly down the hall of fame  
  
Into my big mouth you can fly a plane  
  
Wholl put on my shoes while theyre walking  
  
Slowly down the hall of fame  
  
Slowly down the hall of fame  
  
I aint never spoke to God  
  
And I aint never been to heaven  
  
But you assumed I knew the way  
  
Even though the map was given  
  
And as you look into the eyes  
  
Of a bloody cold assassin  
  
Only then you realise  
  
With whos life you have been messin
