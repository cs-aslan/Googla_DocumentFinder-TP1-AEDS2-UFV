Weve been sweethearts for so long  
But now you say were through  
The love we shared is now a memory  
I have built a ship of dreams  
And planned them all for you  
But now I guess what is to be will be  
  
CHORUS  
Ill sail my ship alone  
With all the dreams I own  
Drifting out across the ocean blue  
Yes Ill sail my ship alone  
Tho all the sails youve torn  
And when it starts to sinkin  
Ill blame you  
Now I gave a message to the wind  
To take back home to you  
Hoping you would hear my SOS  
I thought that you would come back home  
My darlin if you knew  
How much my achin heart was in distress  
Well  
REPEAT CHORUS
