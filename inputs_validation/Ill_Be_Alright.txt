Ill be alright Ill be alright if I dont have to smile  
If I dont to face the morning sunrise for a while  
Ill get along you know Ill take tomorrow with a grin  
If I never have to think about her love again  
  
And I wont mind if words are spoken  
In empty love songs as long as I dont have to hear  
Ill be alright if I dont have to face the world again  
And if I never love again Ill be alright  
  
Last night she gave the final word she said her last goodbye  
And disappeared forever in the world outside  
One kiss and then she took her leave to go I know not where  
Into the misty shadows of the midnight air  
  
But I wont mind if words are spoken  
In empty love songs as long as I dont have to hear  
Ill be alright if I dont have to face the world again  
And if I never love again Ill be alright  
And if I never love again Ill be alright
