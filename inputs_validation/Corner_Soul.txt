Is the music of grove skin rock  
Soaked in the diesel of was boys war  
Blood black gold and the face of a judge  
Is the music calling for a river of blood  
  
Beat the drums tonight Alphonso  
Spread the news all over the grove  
The big meeting has decided  
That total was must burn on the grove  
  
Does it mean I should take my machete  
To chop my way through the path of life  
Does it mean I should run with the dog pack  
Is that the way to be the one to survive  
  
Never need a gun says Tai Chi  
Move on up to dragon snaps his tail  
Fall back on still waters  
Hammer with his eye on the nail  
  
Spread the word tonight please Sammy  
Theyre searching every house on the grove  
Dont go alone now Sammy  
The wind has blown away the corner soul  
  
Tell the news for me Sammy  
Theyre searching every place on the grove  
But dont go down alone new Sammy  
The wind has blown away the corner soul  
  
Is the music calling for a river of blood
