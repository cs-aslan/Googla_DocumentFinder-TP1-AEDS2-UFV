Dont know why I have to work  
Dont know why I cant play  
Turn me off turn me out  
But dont turn me away  
Save me a place  
Ill come running if you love me today  
Dont know why I have to go  
Dont know why I cant stay  
Guess I want to be alone  
And I guess I need to be amazed  
Save me a place  
Ill come running if you love me today  
Ill come running if you love me today
