All for you  
Everlasting love forever skies of blue  
All in your heart  
Never ending just a means for start  
  
Chorus  
Comfort in your eyes  
For the warmth inside your smile  
Faiths done gone astray  
It was you who made living all worth the while  
I thank you my child  
It was you who made living all worth the while  
I thank you my child  
  
With the touch of your hand  
Amidst confusion I can see enough to understand  
All my fears repressed  
Oh lovin you child its the best  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre all and everything to me  
Til the end of times you know youll always be  
Aint no second guess  
Oh you put my worried soul to rest
