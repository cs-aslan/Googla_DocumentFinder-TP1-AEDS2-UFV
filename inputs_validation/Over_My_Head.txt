Baby Im tryin to make some sense  
Of all we shouldve learned from experience  
We win we lose we conquer and we fail  
One part serious do or die  
Another part crush in junior high  
Im chasing my emotions like a tail  
I can still move my fingers  
But I cant seem to let go  
  
The cold winds are blowing I should be goin  
Im in over my head  
Without even blinkin youve got me thinkin  
I would be better off dead  
Yeah Im in over my head  
  
You made me weak I made you laugh  
Driving through the rain in a yellow cab  
The taste of your kiss is with me even now  
But this thing weve got goes by different names  
Never two days in a row the same  
I wanna stop feelin this but dont know how  
  
I see my legs and theyre moving  
But I just cant walk away  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill say goodbye but talk is cheap  
I count the memories in my sleep  
Ive had enough but I want more  
  
Makin me weak makin you laugh  
Driving through the rain in that yellow cab  
Baby your kiss is with me even now  
  
Chorus
