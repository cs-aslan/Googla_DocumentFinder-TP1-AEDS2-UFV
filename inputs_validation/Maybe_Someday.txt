And I would give up tomorrow  
And die for one yesterday  
Id lie beg steal and borrow  
To hear you whisper my name  
  
Tonight there aint no miracles  
Washing up on this beach  
The angels left here long ago  
But I still believe  
  
That maybe someday  
I will hold your hand  
And maybe someway  
Well trace our footsteps in the sand  
And just walk away  
Maybe someday  
  
Now I dont know how a heart beats  
But I sure know how one breaks  
Remember how I used to hold you  
To share every breath that youd take  
  
How can I forget  
Youre every tear that I cry  
I know youre coming back  
You never kissed me goodbye  
  
Maybe someday  
I will hold your hand  
And maybe someway  
Well trace our footsteps in the sand  
And just walk away  
  
They say that nothing lasts forever  
But we know our two hearts beat together  
And though youre far away every night I pray  
Maybe someday someday  
  
Maybe someday  
I will understand  
Maybe someway  
Well trace these footsteps in the sand  
Just walk away  
  
Maybe someday  
Maybe someday  
Maybe someday  
Maybe someway
