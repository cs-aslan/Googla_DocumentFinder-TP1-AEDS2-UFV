You thought youd found a good girl  
One to love you and give you the world  
Now you find that youve been misused  
Talk to me Ill do what you choose I want you to  
  
Tell Mama all about it  
Tell Mama what you need  
Tell Mama what you want  
And Ill make everything alright  
  
That girl you had didnt have no sense  
She wasnt worth all the time that you spent  
She had another man throw you outdoors  
Now the same man is wearing your clothes I want you to  
  
Tell Mama all about it  
Tell Mama what you need  
Tell Mama what you want  
And Ill make everything alright  
  
Tell me tell me now  
  
She would embarrass you anywhere  
Shed let everybody know she didnt care  
Give me a chance Ive been beggin you  
And I just want to take care of you I want you to  
  
Tell Mama all about it  
Tell Mama what you need  
Tell Mama what you want  
Tell Mama what you want right now  
  
Tell me tell your mom  
Im your Mama  
Tell me what you want
