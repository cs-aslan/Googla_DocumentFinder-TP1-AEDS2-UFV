Person to person woman to man  
Sing me a story to reach me  
Teach me to teach me to understand  
All these emotions I miss you  
  
So you leave her  
Cant believe her  
Cant escape  
Final eyes  
Final eyes  
  
Person to person woman to man  
Send me this song that will teach me  
Like a river without a stream  
Night time without dreaming  
Send me this song that will reach me  
  
So you leave me  
Cant deceive me  
See through me  
Final eyes  
Final eyes  
  
And I know you think theres nothing  
Theres nothing more to say  
And I know that Ive got something  
Ive got something to say  
  
If ever I needed someone  
You were there when I needed you  
  
If ever I needed someone  
You were there when I needed you  
  
If ever I needed someone  
You were there when I needed you  
  
Person to person woman to man  
Send me this song that will teach me  
Like a river without a stream  
Night time without dreaming  
Send me this song that will reach me  
  
So you leave me  
Cant deceive me  
See through me  
Final eyes  
  
And I know you think theres nothing  
Theres nothing more to say  
Dont hide behind the headlines oh yea  
Ive got something to say  
  
If ever I needed someone  
You were there when I needed you  
If ever I needed someone  
You were there when I needed you  
  
Whenever I needed  
Whenever I needed  
Whenever I needed  
  
Someone  
  
If ever I needed  
Whenever I needed someone  
You were there when I needed you  
  
You saved me from falling  
Saved me from falling  
Im so in love with you
