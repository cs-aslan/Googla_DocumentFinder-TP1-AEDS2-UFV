Ill say goodbye to love  
No one ever cared if I should live or die  
Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by  
And all I know of love  
Is how to live without it  
I just cant seem to find it  
  
So Ive made my mind up I must live my life alone  
And though its not the easy way  
I guess Ive always known  
Id say goodbye to love  
  
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine  
Surely time will lose these bitter memories  
And Ill find that there is someone to believe in  
And to live for something I could live for  
  
All the years of useless search  
Have finally reached an end  
Loneliness and empty days will be my only friend  
From this day love is forgotten  
Ill go on as best I can  
  
What lies in the future is a mystery to us all  
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls  
There may come a time when I will see that Ive been wrong  
But for now this is my song  
  
And its goodbye to love  
Ill say goodbye to love
