You think youre alone there in your silent storm  
But ive seen the tears youve cried falling down and trying to drown  
The flame of hope inside  
Let me tell you now tell you now  
  
chorus  
When youre walking in the dead of night  
And your soul is churning  
When your hope seems out of sight  
Keep the candle burning  
All it takes is one steady heart in a world thats turning  
Shine a light and pierce the dark  
Keep the candle burning  
Keep the candle burning  
  
When youre down and youre discouraged  
When the darkness clouds your view  
Youve got to gather up your courage  
You know the lord is gonna see you through  
Let me tell you now  
Tell you now  
  
repeat chorus  
One ray of light always breaks through  
Follow wherever he takes you  
Wherever he takes you
