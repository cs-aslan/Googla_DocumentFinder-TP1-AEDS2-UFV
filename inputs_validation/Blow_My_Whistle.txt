Verse 2 Hikaru Utada  
Cast your vote on me Say thats it for me Just place your bets on me  
Stop gettin high off of jealousy Whether you are a dear or not  
Im comin with all that I got  I got Then while you decide  
We are undefined  
My instincts says its hard to keep you free I want to keep you free  
And my mother says men besides stability Oh is it true  
My instincts says its hard to keep you free  
But I told you this life exclusively oh  
  
Repeat Chorus  
Verse 3 Hikaru Utada  
Scared to show or tell Keep what you just felt The secrets to yourself  
I gettin tired of mistreatment Even though I say they do not  
The games you play hurt me a lot alot  
When theres none to play Will you go or stay  
My instincts says its hard to keep you free  
When my mother says men will leave eventually is it true  
Nothing lives forever I agree  
But I wouldnt mind the possibility Oh  
  
Repeat Chorus
