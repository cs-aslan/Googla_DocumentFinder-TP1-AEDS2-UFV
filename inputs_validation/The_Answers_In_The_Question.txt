The answers in the question Will you be home late again Will you find the
courage When truth come closin in When trust is almost broken Faith is hard
to find The answers in the question Will you leave this all behind  
The hearts a lonely hunter It never quite feels safe The devils in the
details The thrill is in the chase You rise and fall like water You try to
stay the same The only thing thats certain Is that everything will change How
will I be remembered Will my critics be unkind  
The answers in the question You must leave this all behind
