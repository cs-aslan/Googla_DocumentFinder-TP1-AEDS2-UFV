Heres one from the head  
The one that bounced straight through  
The rubber soul  
Its good advice  
For everyone  
You end up where you started crawling from  
Im always bouncing into the other  
Again and again you find its yet another  
So Im always bouncing into the other  
Seven days to seven days  
Heres one from far away  
The way I lose confidence  
In what I say  
Im only here  
For a while  
Leave me quick Im only here for a while  
Im always bouncing into the other  
Again and again you find its yet another  
So Im always bouncing into the other  
Seven days to seven days  
Always seven days  
Always seven days  
Always always always  
Im always bouncing into the other  
Again and again you find its yet another  
So Im always bouncing into the other  
Seven days to seven days
