Rock your baby all night long  
Rock your baby all night long  
Rock your baby all night long  
Rock your baby all night long  
Rock your baby all night long  
Take me in your arms and whisper low  
Then rock your baby and dont be slow  
  
Birds was made to sit in a tree  
You were made to dance with me  
Heres your chance now dont go wrong  
Gotta rock your baby all night long  
  
Rock your baby all night long  
Rock your baby all night long  
Rock your baby all night long  
Rock your baby all night long  
Take me in your arms and whisper low  
Then rock your baby and dont be slow  
  
I got my hair fixed in a pony tail  
So when we dance itll really sail  
If you love me then tell me so  
But rock your baby and dont be slow  
  
Rock your baby all night long  
Rock your baby all night long  
Rock your baby all night long  
Rock your baby all night long  
Take me in your arms and whisper low  
Then rock your baby and dont be slow
