Our kind of love  
It was once in a lifetime  
It couldnt last  
It was doomed from the first time  
  
And you were 50s cool  
In blue suede shoes  
But it was a cover for  
All of the trouble  
You got into  
  
I always fall for the wrong guy  
Things that are bad always taste nice  
Thats what girls like me do lose you  
  
Dont tell me its over  
Dont tell me its over  
  
Hollywoods dead  
Elvis is crying  
Vicious in flames  
Roland is dying  
  
And in the light youre  
Sickeningly beautiful  
Say goodbye youre  
Sickeningly beautiful  
  
This kind of life  
Wasnt meant for the good girl  
Try as I might  
In the end its a cruel world  
  
And you are living proof  
Sinatra aloof  
That you were an actor  
Who only went after  
The ones who swooned  
  
I always fall for the same type  
Gangsters in Vegas on game night  
Thats what girls like me like  
The limelight  
  
Dont tell me its over  
Dont tell me its over  
  
Hollywoods dead  
Elvis is crying  
Marilyns sad  
Hendrix is lying there  
  
In the light youre  
Sickeningly beautiful  
Say goodbye youre  
Sickeningly beautiful  
  
If you should go  
Before me then know  
That I always loved you  
Theres no one above you baby  
  
Dont tell me its over  
Dont tell me its over  
  
Hollywoods dead  
Elvis is crying  
Lennon wake up  
Cobain stop lying there  
  
In the light youre  
Sickeningly beautiful  
Say goodbye youre  
Sickeningly beautiful  
  
Say goodnight youre  
So beautiful  
  
Hollywoods dead  
Hollywoods dead  
Hollywoods dead yeah  
Hollywoods dead  
Hollywoods dead  
Hollywoods dead yeah  
  
Cut
