Somewhere out in space  
A moonlit face was watching  
Lookin to find a time to become  
Slowly two lovers lay hypnotized  
Holding the moment in their eyes  
World in changes  
Lightly one by one  
We try to hide the mirrors  
But baby they just keep turnin up  
And I know you cant look away from you  
When youre lookin in into  
CHORUS  
Isabellas eyes  
Shine your light and make your mama smile  
All our angels come  
To welcome the awakening one  
Awakening wonder  
Repeat Chorus after second verse then go down to 3rd verse  
Repeat Chorus after third verse  
Once I met a man who knew where he was goin  
And let everybody tag along  
But suddenly love had another plan  
Shook him and took him by the hand  
World in changes  
N theres a boy I know  
Believes that hes in danger  
Hell never give up without a fight  
If you open your heart  
Theres no way to lose  
So just surrender to  
BACK TO CHORUS  
Millions of dreams are part of the plan  
But you are the one dream thats real  
This changes everything  
Now that I am  
In the spell of Isabellas eyes  
BACK TO CHORUS
