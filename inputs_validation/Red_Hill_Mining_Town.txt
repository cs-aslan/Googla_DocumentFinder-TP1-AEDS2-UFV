From father to son  
The blood runs thin  
See faces frozen still  
Against the wind  
  
The seam is split  
The coal face cracked  
The lines are long  
Theres no going back  
Through hands of steel  
And heart of stone  
Our labor day  
Has come and gone  
  
Yeah you leave me holding on  
In Red Hill town  
See lights go down Im  
  
Hanging on  
Youre all thats left to hold on to  
Im still waiting  
Im hanging on  
Youre all thats left to hold on to  
  
The glass is cut  
The bottle run dry  
Our love runs cold  
In the caverns of the night  
Were wounded by fear  
Injured in doubt  
I can lose myself  
You I cant live without  
  
Yeah you keep me holding on  
In Red Hill town  
See the lights go down on  
Im hanging on  
Youre all thats left to hold on to  
Im still waiting  
Hanging on  
Youre all thats left to hold on to on to  
  
Well scorch the earth  
Set fire to the sky  
We stoop so low to reach so high  
A link is lost  
The chain undone  
We wait all day  
For night to come  
And it comes  
Like a hunter child  
  
Im hanging on  
Youre all thats left to hold on to  
Im still waiting  
Im hanging on  
Youre all thats left to hold on to  
  
Love slowly stripped away  
Love has seen its better day  
  
Hanging on  
The lights go out on Red Hill  
The lights go down on Red Hill  
Lights go down on Red Hill town  
The lights go down on Red Hill
