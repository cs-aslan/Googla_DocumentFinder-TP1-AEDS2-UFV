Oh by gosh by golly its time for mistletoe and holly  
Tasty pheasants Christmas presents  
Countrysides covered with snow  
Oh by gosh by jingle  
Its time for carols and Kris Kringle  
  
Overeating merry greetings  
From relatives you dont know  
Then comes that big night  
Giving the tree a trim  
Youll hear voices by starlight  
Singing yuletide hollers  
  
Oh by gosh by golly  
Its time for mistletoe and holly  
Fancy ties and Grandmas pies  
And folks stealing a kiss or two  
As they whisper Merry Christmas to you
