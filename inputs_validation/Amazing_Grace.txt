Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now Im found  
I was blind but now I see  
  
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relived  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hours I first believed  
Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now Im found  
I was blind but now I see  
  
Now when weve been there ten thousand years  
Bright shining as the sun  
Weve no less days to sing Gods praise  
That when we first begun  
Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now Im found  
I was blind but now I see  
  
Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now Im found  
I was blind but now I see
