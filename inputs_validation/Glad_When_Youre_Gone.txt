Now you say that youre leavin  
Well it cant be too soon  
And you spend all of my money  
You knocked my guitar out of tune  
  
Well you say youre sick and tired  
Tired of having me around  
And you call me cheatin liar  
You drove my car into the ground  
  
And Ill be glad when youre gone  
Yes Ill be glad when youre gone  
And when you walk out that door  
Darlin please dont come back no more  
  
Now I wish Id never known you  
And I wish wed never met  
I was drunk you gave me whiskey  
When I was ill you called the vet  
  
Well you say that its over  
And you think youll bring me down  
If you come back lookin for me  
Ill be out there on the town
