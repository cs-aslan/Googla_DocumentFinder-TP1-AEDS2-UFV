Listen up child theres one thing Ive got to make clear  
Yeah I do  
You dont see it coming  
hear it coming  
Acting like you know nothing  
About that strange rumor going on around here  
  
Take me back to the land of the living  
Take me down where the sun do shine  
Take me back things be different  
You get it got it oh you better get it now  
  
Chorus  
Stay alive let your soul rise up from the bottom  
Stay alive dont let it take you down for the very last time  
Stay alive It dont do you no good looking up from the bottom  
Stay alive dont let it take you down for the very last time  
  
You talk about lies and pain  
It dont do you no good with your face in the cocaine  
  
Love hate watch that mother  
Shell bring you down like no other Ive seen  
If you know what I mean  
  
Take me back got to face that demon  
Take me down dont play its fool  
Take me back things be different  
You get it got it ooooh you better get it now  
  
Chorus  
  
No I aint seen nothin  
No I aint seen nothin  
No I aint seen nothin like you before  
  
Chorus
