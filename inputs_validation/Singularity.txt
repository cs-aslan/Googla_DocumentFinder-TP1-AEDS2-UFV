Verse 1  
Winter came so soon  
Like summer never happened  
Were players on a stage  
With roles already scripted  
Were working for a wage  
Im living for today  
On a giant piece of dirt  
Spinning in the universe  
  
PreChorus 1  
I can hear your cry out there  
And I can feel you close to me  
  
Chorus 1  
One day at a time  
Inch by inch  
For every kiss  
On lovers lips  
For all lost souls  
Who cant come home  
For friends not here  
We shed our tears  
  
Verse 2  
And all I wanna do  
Is make the right impression  
The instrument of truth  
A soldier with no weapons  
I care so much for you  
Id crawl a thousand miles  
Through deserts full of sand  
My love in every land  
  
PreChorus 2  
I can hear your cry out there  
And I can feel you everywhere  
  
Chorus 2  
One day at a time  
Inch by inch  
For every kiss  
On lovers lips  
For all lost souls  
Who cant come home  
For friends not here  
We shed our tears  
  
Chorus 3  
One day at a time  
Inch by inch  
For every kiss  
On lovers lips  
For all lost souls  
Who cant come home  
For friends not here  
We shed our tears  
  
PreChorus 3  
I can feel your presence here  
Tender softly through the air  
  
Chorus 4  
One day at a time  
Inch by inch  
For every kiss  
On lovers lips  
For all lost souls  
Who cant come home
