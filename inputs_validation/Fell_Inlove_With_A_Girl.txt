I fell in love with a girl  
Fell in love once and almost completely  
Shes in love with the world  
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading  
She turns and says Are you alright  
I said I must be fine cause my hearts still beating  
Come and kiss me by the riverside  
Yeah Bobby said its fine he dont consider it cheating now  
  
Red hair with a curl  
Mellow roll for the flavor and the eyes for peeping  
Cant keep away from the girl  
These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting  
Cant think of anything to do yeah my left brain knows that all love is
fleeting  
Shes just looking for something new  
And I said it once before but it bears repeating now  
  
Aaaaah aaaaah aaaaah aaaaaaah  
Aaaaah aaaaah aaaaah aaaaaaah  
Aaaaah aaaaah aaaaah aaaaaaah  
Aaaaah aaaaah aaaaah aaaaaaah  
  
Cant think of anything to do  
Yeah my left brain knows that all love is fleeting  
Shes just looking for something new well  
I said it once before but it bears repeating
