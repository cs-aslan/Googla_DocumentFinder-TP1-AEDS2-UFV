come and go as I please  
From down here up North and inbetween  
But baby its a shame cause I always feel the same  
When I cant see Texas from here  
  
Chorus  
I cant see Texas from here  
No matter how I try it makes me want to cry  
So if you see me lookin down  
Im tryin not to show this frown  
Cause I cant see Texas from here  
  
I cant say I dont like Tennessee  
The people here have all been good to me  
So please dont take offense if I start to get intense  
Just cause I cant see Texas from here  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Cause I cant see Texas I cant see Texas  
I cant see Texas from here
