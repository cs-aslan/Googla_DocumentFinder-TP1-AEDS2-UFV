STAMP Stampin on the ground  
STAMP Stampin on the ground  
STAMP Stampin on the ground  
STAMP Stampin on the ground  
  
Woah yeah  
  
Ive been round so many times before  
Broke my back been split open so oft  
Tried to make it to the finish line  
Been knocked down get up every single time  
Theyre up in your face they dont think you belong  
Man you got it you got it goin on  
What breaks the weak just makes you strong  
You got game baby bring it on bring it on  
  
Chorus  
And I said Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud make the biggest sound  
You aint goin  
Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud  
You aint going you aint goin down  
Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud make the biggest sound  
You aint goin  
Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud  
You aint goin you aint goin down  
  
Rain comes in every players life  
Gotta stay in the game not on the sidelines  
Gotta throw down you gotta stand and fight  
Keep your eye on the prize dont get caught up in strife  
Go go for the shot boy make that play just right  
Braggin about your swag wont get you through the night  
  
Chorus  
  
STAMP You got game  
STAMP You got fame  
STAMP You got name  
STAMP Do that thang  
We aint going down oh no  
Make me proud Stand up and fight  
  
Chorus  
  
Stamp your feet stamp your feet  
Stamp your feet stamp your feet  
  
STAMP No no no we aint goin down  
STAMP No no no we aint goin down  
Right till the ending well make it through life  
Better stamp your feet on the  
Stamp your feet on the ground
