Well Ive been a lot of places  
And Ive seen a lot of things  
I met all kinds of people  
Including queens and kings  
  
Had my share of heartbreak  
Stabbed me in my back  
I cried to my friends about it  
And they talked a lot of slack  
  
But oh what a revelation  
When much to my surprise  
Then came you wonderful you  
Right before my eyes  
  
5 minutes away 5 minutes away  
You know I been  
All around the world to find  
It was right at my door  
  
5 minutes away 5 minutes away  
I found love love  
Just minutes away  
  
Everybodys got a story  
And it aint nothing new  
Im talking to the one  
Whos been looking for love  
And it just might be you  
  
While youre running around  
Hanging all around town  
With a fool that aint no good  
But that very special someone  
Could be right in your neighborhood  
  
5 minutes away 5 minutes away  
You know I went  
All around the world  
Just to find it right at my door  
  
5 minutes away 5 minutes away  
You see I found love love love  
Just minutes away  
  
Times when love aint easy  
Its a game that we all play  
And the prize that we pay  
Is sometimes much too high  
  
Take it from me and dont look too far  
Love might be in your own backyard  
Theres a better chance to find romance  
Just by starting today  
  
5 minutes away  
You know I went  
All around the world  
To find it right at my door  
  
5 minutes away 5 minutes away  
You know love love love  
Could be minutes away  
I said love love love  
Is just minutes away  
  
5 5 5 5 minutes away  
5 5 5 minutes away  
5 5 5 5 minutes away  
5 5 5 minutes away  
  
5 5 5 5 minutes away  
5 5 5 minutes away  
5 5 5 5 minutes away  
5 5 5 minutes away  
5 5 5 5 minutes away  
5 5 5 minutes away
