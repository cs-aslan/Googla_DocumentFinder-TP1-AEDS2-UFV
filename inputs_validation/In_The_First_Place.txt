I used to think love was real  
When its just the way you feel  
After a moment  
When its gone its like it never existed  
In the first place  
  
I used to think you were mine  
Mistaken all the time  
We were togheter  
And now youre gone  
And its like we never existed  
In the first place  
  
Too much of this  
And Im enough of that  
You get so fast  
In your search for something new again  
  
I used to think I was real  
But now its no big deal  
It dont matter  
And when Im gone its like I never existed  
In the first place
