You do you remember me  
Like I remember you  
Do you spend your life going back in your mind to that time  
Cause I I walk the streets alone  
I hate being on my own  
And everyone can see that I really fell  
And Im going through hell  
Thinking about you with somebody else  
  
Chorus  
Somebody wants you somebody needs you  
Somebody dreams about you every single night  
Somebody cant breathe without you its lonely  
Somebody hopes that one day you will see  
That somebodys me  
That somebodys me  
Yeah  
  
How how did we go wrong  
It was so good and now its gone  
And I pray at night that our passing will cross  
What we hide isnt lost  
Cause you are always right here in my thoughts  
  
Chorus  
  
You will always be in my life even if Im not in your life  
Cause youre in my memory  
You will you remember me  
And before you set me free oh listen please  
  
Chorus  
  
That somebodys me  
That somebodys me
