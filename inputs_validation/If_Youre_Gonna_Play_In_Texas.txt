If youre gonna play in texas  
You gotta have a fiddle in the band  
That lead guitar is hot  
But not for lousiana man  
So rosin up that bow for faded love  
And lets all dance  
If youre gonna play in texas  
You gotta have a fiddle in the band  
  
I remember down in houston  
We were puttin on a show  
When a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled  
cottoneyed joe  
He said we love what youre doin  
Boys dont get us wrong  
Theres just somethin missin in your song  
  
Chorus  
  
So we dusted off our boots and put our cowboy hats on straight  
Them texans raised the roof when jeff opened up his case  
You say yall all wanna twostep You say ya wanna doesidoe  
Well heres a fiddlin song before we go  
  
Chorus  
Repeat and fade
