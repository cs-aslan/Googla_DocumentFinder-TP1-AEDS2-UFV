Whenever my soul is lonely  
Whenever Im feeling blue  
I start thinkin bout my blue eyed darlin  
And my heart starts pinin for you  
  
Chorus  
I want to hear that high lonesome sound  
Cause my sweet baby aint around  
When my lifes got me down  
I want to hear that high lonesome sound  
  
When Im lost in this ocean of darkness  
Not knowing which way I should turn  
And my eyes are filled with sadness  
Of knowing youll never return
