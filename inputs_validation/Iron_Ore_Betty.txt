Im going steady with iron ore betty  
And shes goin steady with me  
We receive our mail in the same mailbox  
And we watch the same tv  
I got rug burns on my elbows  
Shes got em on her knees  
Yeah Im goin steady with iron ore betty  
And shes going steady with me  
Hey I been pickin my brains out  
I been workin at the hardware store  
I been trying to put a chicken in the window  
Chase away the wolf from the door  
Bettys been down in the iron ore mine  
Bringing home energy  
Yeah Im goin steady with iron ore betty  
And shes goin steady with me  
I been speaking to her in english  
Shes been speakin in the english too  
We always speak the same language  
cause were always gettin through  
I met her at a dance at the union hall  
It was a night with daddy g  
Yeah Im goin steady with iron ore betty  
And shes goin steady with me
