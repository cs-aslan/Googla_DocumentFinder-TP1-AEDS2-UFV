Ive known about you for a while now  
When he leaves me he wears a smile  
Now as soon as hes away from me  
In your arms is where he wants to be  
  
Kelly  
But youre the one he rushes home to  
Youre the one he gave his name to  
Ive never seen his face in the early morning light  
You have his mornings his daytimes  
And sometimes I have his nights  
  
Both  
But does he love you does he love you  
Like he loves me like he loves me  
Does he think of you does he think of you  
When hes holding me  
Does he whisper all of his fantasies  
Does he love you does he love you  
Like hes been loving me  
  
Kelly  
But when hes with me  
He says he needs me  
And that he wants me  
That he believes in me  
  
Reba  
And when Im in his arms  
How he swears theres no one else  
Is he deceiving me  
Or am I deceiving myself  
  
Both  
Does he love you does he love you  
Like he loves melike he loves me  
Does he think of you does he think of you  
When hes holding me  
And does he whisper all of his fantasies  
Does he love you does he love you  
Like hes been loving me  
  
Oooh shouldnt I loose my temper  
Oooh shouldnt I be ashamed  
cause I have everything to loose  
I have nothing to gain  
  
Does he love you does he love you  
Like he loves me like he loves me  
Does he think of you does he think of you  
Whens hes holding me  
Does he whisper you all of his fantasies  
Does he love you does he love you  
Like hes been loving me  
  
Ooooh  
Does he love you
