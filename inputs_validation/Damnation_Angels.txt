Deliver me  
To the bad I was born  
Im a sinner in flames  
I was schooled by Lucifiers horn  
And bad religion all along the way  
Play with me  
I wont do you no harm  
No  I aint been a saint  
If I  
Do the time  then Ill do the crime  
Ill be raising hell in flames  
  
If theres a hell  
Then Ill buy a round  
Cause Im going anyway  
No dont let  
Five minutes with the Devil fool ya  
Oh yeah ya got some hell to pay  
  
Damnation angels  
Yeah Im going  
Down with the angels  
Into the fire  
Damnation angels  
Yeah Im going  
Down with the angels  
To the flames Im bound  
Ooh Im on the road to hell you see  
The road to terror dome is calling me
