A lovestruck Romeo sings a street suss serenade  
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made  
Finds a convenient streetlight steps out of the shade  
Says something like you and me babe how about it  
  
Juliet says hey its Romeo you nearly gave me a heart attack  
Hes underneath the window shes singing hey now my boyfriends back  
You shouldnt come around here singing up at people like that  
Anyway what you gonna do about it  
  
Juliet the dice were loaded from the start  
And I bet and you exploded in my heart  
And I forget I forget the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet  
  
Come up on different streets they both were streets of shame  
Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same  
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real  
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals  
  
Well you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold  
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold  
You promised me everything you promised me thick and thin yeah  
Now you just say oh Romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him  
  
Juliet when we made love you used to cry  
You said I love you like the stars above Ill love you till I die  
Theres a place for us you know the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet  
  
I cant do the talk like they talk on TV  
And I cant do a love song like the way its meant to be  
I cant do everything but Id do anything for you  
I cant do anything except be in love with you  
  
And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be  
All I do is keep the beat and bad company  
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme  
Juliet Id do the stars with you any time  
  
Juliet when we made love you used to cry  
You said I love you like the stars above Ill love you till I die  
Theres a place for us you know the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet  
  
A lovestruck Romeo sings a street suss serenade  
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
