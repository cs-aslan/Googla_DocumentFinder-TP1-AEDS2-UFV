No bad dream fuckers going to boss me around  
Christian Brothers going to take him down  
But it cant help me get over  
  
Dont be cross its sick what I want  
Ive seen the boss blink on and off  
  
Fake concerns is whats the matter man  
And you think I ought to shake your motherfucking hand  
Well I know how much you care  
  
Dont be cross its sick what I want  
Ive seen the boss blink on and off  
  
Come here by me I want you here  
Nightmares become me its so fucking clear  
Nightmares become me its so fucking clear
