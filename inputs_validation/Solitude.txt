1934 Eddie Delange Irving Mills Duke Ellington  
  
In my solitude you haunt me  
With reveries of days gone by  
In my solitude you taunt me  
With memories that never die  
  
I sit in my chair  
Filled with despair  
Nobody could be so sad  
With gloom evrywhere  
I sit and I stare  
I know that Ill soon go mad  
  
In my solitude  
Im praying  
Dear Lord above  
Send back my love  
  
  
  
Original lyric  
  
In my solitude you haunt me  
With reveries of days gone by  
In my solitude you taunt me  
With memories that never die  
  
I sit in my chair  
Im filled with despair  
Theres no one could be so sad  
With gloom evrywhere  
I sit and I stare  
I know that Ill soon go mad  
  
In my solitude  
Im praying  
Dear Lord above  
Send back my love
