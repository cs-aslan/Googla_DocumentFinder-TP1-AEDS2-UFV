Go  
  
Of all the things they taught you Im telling you this son  
All the wars fought before wont compare to this one  
Giant spiders prepare to take over  
  
Here comes another mutant suicidesquad  
You blast them out but now youre way off course  
You start to shiver and shake  
Im calling you Houston  
  
Am I following all the right leads  
or am I about to get lost in space  
When my time comes theyll write my destiny  
Will you take this ride  
  
Communications lost we crash to the earth  
Too late to see the giant spider monster giving birth  
The future is here and here is the future  
  
Am I following all the right leads  
or am I about to get lost in space  
When my time comes theyll write my destiny  
Will you take this ride with me
