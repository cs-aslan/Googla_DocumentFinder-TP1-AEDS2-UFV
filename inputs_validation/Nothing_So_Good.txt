Aint nothin so good  
As a Sunday morning  
When the day is dawnin  
Kinda makes you feel good  
  
There aint nothing so fine  
As a lazy weekend  
Just hangin out with your best friend  
There aint nothing so good  
There aint nothing so good as a good time  
  
Theres nothing so right as the right time  
I said please dont count on me  
Said please dont count on me  
Theres nothing so good as a good time  
Maybe there should  
There aint nothing so good  
  
Aint nothin so strong  
As the strength of a good love  
I cant get enough  
Cant ever get too much love  
  
There aint nothing so right  
As the sound of your voice  
Im gonna make it my choice  
And get into something good  
  
There aint nothing so good as a good time  
There aint nothing so right as the right time  
I said please dont count on me  
Said please dont you count on me  
Theres nothing so good as a good time  
Maybe there should  
There aint nothing so good  
  
Sail away  
Cant drift too far  
Gotta get away  
Be where you are  
Sail away sail away  
Sail on far  
Gotta find a way  
Into your heart  
  
Aint nothin so good  
As a Sunday morning  
When the day is dawning  
Kinda makes you feel good  
  
There aint nothing so fine  
As a lazy weekend  
Just hangin out with your best friend  
There aint nothing so good  
There aint nothing so good as a good time  
Aint nothing so right as the right time  
I said please dont count on me  
Said please dont count on me  
Theres nothing so good as a good time  
Maybe there should  
There aint nothing so good  
  
Good good nothin so good  
Good good nothin so good  
  
Good good nothin so good  
Nothin so good as a good time  
Good good nothin so good  
Nothin so good as a good time  
Good good nothin so good  
Nothin so good as a good time  
Good good nothin so good  
  
Nothin so good as a good time  
Good good nothin so good  
Nothin so good as a good time  
Good good nothin so good
