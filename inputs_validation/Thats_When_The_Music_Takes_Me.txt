Thats when the music takes me  
Takes to a brighter day  
Thats when the music takes me  
Helpin me to find my way  
  
When the day is so long that I cant hold on  
When Im down and I think my hope is gone  
Oooh Yeah  
Thats when the music takes me  
Closer to a brighter daaaay  
I can feel my soul explodin  
Theres a good feelin  
Helpin me to find my waaay  
My my my way  
  
When the bluebird sings her sad sad song  
And the wind brings a cold to tag along  
Oh yeah  
I can feel the spirit move me  
I can almost touch the sky  
Reachin for a new tomorrow  
I know its hard  
But music makes me waaaaanna try  
Wanna try  
And then  
Thats when the music takes me  
Takes to a brighter day  
Yeah yeah  
Thats when the music takes me  
Helpin me to find my way  
Thats when the music takes me  
Thats when the music takes me  
Oh yeah  
But when the music takes me  
Closer to a brighter day  
I can feel my soul explodin  
Theres a good feelin  
Helpin me to fiiiiiiind my waaay  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
And then Im sayin  
Thats when the music takes me  
Takes to a brighter day  
Yeah yeah yeah

Helpin me to find my way  
Clap
