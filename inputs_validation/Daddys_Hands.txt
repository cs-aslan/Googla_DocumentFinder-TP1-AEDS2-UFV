feat Loretta Lynn  
  
I remember daddys hands folded silently in prayer  
And reachin out to hold me when I had a nightmare  
You could read quite a story in the callous and lines  
Years of work and worry had left their mark behind  
  
Verse 2  
I remember daddys hands how they held my mama tight  
And patted my back for something done right  
There are things that Id forgotten that I loved about the man  
But Ill always remember the love in daddys hands  
  
Chorus  
Daddys hands were soft and kind when I was cryin  
Daddys hands were hard as steel when Id done wrong  
Daddys hands werent always gentle but Ive come to understand  
There was always love in daddys hands  
  
Verse 3  
I remember daddys hands workin til they bled  
Sacrifised unselfishly just to keep us all fed  
If I could do things over Id live my life again  
And never take for granted the love in daddys hands  
  
Repeat chorus
