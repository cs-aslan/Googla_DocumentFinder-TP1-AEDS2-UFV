Theres me  
Strong in what I believe but at times I try be correct politically  
Theres her  
Hard headed as can be makes no apologies the opposite of me  
  
But when it comes to love Im inspired by her middle finger to the world  
And I love that she dont care how they see us  
And because of her now I dont either  
And I love that she will not let them beat us  
And because of her now I wont either  
Now I wont either  
  
Theres us  
Opposite enough to occasionally fuss  
Over things we simply just disagree on  
But theres us  
Overwhelming trust in the fact that we gon be us  
Come what may and no matter what  
I learned that from her  
  
But when it comes to love Im inspired by her middle finger to the world  
And I love that she dont care how they see us  
How they see us  
And because of her now I dont either  
Now I dont either  
And I love that she will not let them beat us  
Will not let them beat us  
And because of her now I wont either  
Now I wont either  
Now I wont either  
  
Shes shown me with much stronger than  
What they may say the circumstance  
Im not ashamed to hold her hand  
Let the cameras flash I dont give a damn  
Oh whoa let the cameras flash I dont give a damn  
Let the cameras flash I dont give a damn  
  
And I love that she dont care how they see us  
And she dont care how oooh  
And because of her now I dont either  
Now I dont either I dont either  
And I love that she will not let them beat us  
Let them beat us  
And because of her now I wont either  
And I wont either  
I wont either no no
