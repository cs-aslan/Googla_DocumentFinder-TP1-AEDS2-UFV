Once my future was shiny as the  
Seat of my pants are today  
Then old mother luck and all her  
Daughters started duckin me  
When I finally got tired of just sittin there  
Watching my life slip away  
I said I better start takin all the living  
Thats acomin to me  
  
Chorus  
Now I love too much fight too much  
Stay out late at night too much  
But you bet your butt Im going to  
Live before I die  
And I may smoke too much drink too much  
Every blessed thing too much  
Its a lowdown life but it aint gonna pass me by  
I dont care if the world dont ever hear  
The sound of my name  
And old mother luck and all her daughters  
Keep aduckin me  
As long as that cat that I gotta look at when  
I shave aint ashamed  
There aint no Jody in the world  
Id ever rather be  
  
Chorus  
  
Now I love too much fight too much  
Stay out late at night too much  
But you bet your butt Im going to  
Live before I die  
And I may smoke too much drink too much  
Every blessed thing too much  
Its a lowdown life but it aint gonna pass me by
