I am what I am  
I dont want praise I dont want pity  
I bang my own drum  
Some think its noise I think its pretty  
And so what if I love each sparkle and each bangle  
Why not try to see things from a different angle  
Your life is a shame  
Do you can shout out I am what I am  
Do you can shout out I am what I am  
  
I am what I am  
And what I am needs no excuses  
I deal my own deck  
Sometimes the aces sometimes the deuces  
Its one life and theres no return and no deposit  
One life so its time to open up your closet  
Lifes not worth a damn till you can shout out  
I am what I am  
I am what I am  
  
I am what I am  
And what I am needs no excuses  
I deal my own deck sometimes the aces sometimes the deuces  
Its one life and theres no return and no deposit  
One life so its time to open up your closet  
Lifes not worth a damn till you can shout out  
I am what I am  
  
I am I am good  
I am I am strong  
I am I am somebody  
I am I do belong  
I am I do belong  
  
I am I am useful  
I am I am true  
I am I am worthy  
I am as good as you  
I am as good as you  
  
I am I am good  
I am I am strong  
I am I am somebody  
I am I do belong
