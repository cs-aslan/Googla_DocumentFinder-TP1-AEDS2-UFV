Now when I was a little boy bout the age of five  
I had something in my pocket  
Keep a lot of folks alive  
Now Im a man Im age twentyone  
You know baby we can have a lotta fun  
Im a man I spell M A N  
Man  
All you pretty women stand in line  
I can make love to you baby in an hours time  
Im a man spelled M A N  
Man  
Im going back down to Kansas  
To bring back the second cousin  
Little John the conqueroo  
Im a man spelled M A N  
Man  
The line I shoot will never miss  
The way I make love to em they cant resist  
Im a man I spell M A N  
Man
