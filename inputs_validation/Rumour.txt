I listen to rumours  
Stone cold and bleeding  
They burn my heart away  
Left me alone and afraid  
Words seem to leave me  
Just when I needed them  
Just like I need you  
Like Im supposed to do  
They say  
Love is deceiving  
She wont stay forever  
Love is deceiving  
Is all that she knows  
Love is deceiving  
Shell leave you forever  
Love is deceiving  
She comes and she goes  
I wonder  
I wonder  
I listen to rumours  
Listen to everyone  
Everyone but you  
And now its all too late
