Theres a town that I call home  
Where all the streets are paved with soul  
Down on Beale theres a honkytonk bar  
So hear the wail of a blues guitar  
Have a beer and drop a dime in the blind mans jar  
The blues sing softly in the air like a Sunday morning prayer  
Just one more drink and youll see God everywhere  
Like a sad old melody that cheers you up it sets you free  
Thats how Memphis lives in me  
There comes a time when muddy waters run rough  
There comes a point when a man has had enough  
Like a friend that always stands by me  
Memphis knows me  
Never showed me  
How did life just had to be  
I couldnt even try to run away say goodbye  
Here I was born and here is where Ill die  
Im just a man from Tennessee  
I cant be what I cant be  
All I know is Memphis lives in me  
I said Im just a man from Tennessee  
Cant be what I cant be  
All I know is Memphis lives  
All I know is Memphis gives
