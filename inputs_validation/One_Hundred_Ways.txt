Compliment what she does  
Send her roses just because  
If its violins she loves let them play  
Dedicate her favright song and hold  
Her closer all night long  
Love her today  
Find one hundred ways  
  
Dont forget there could be  
An old lover in her memory  
If you need her so much more  
Why dont you say  
Maybe she has it in her mind  
That shes just wasting her time  
Ask her to stay  
Find one hundred ways  
  
Bein cool wont help you keep a love warm  
Youll just blow your only chance  
Take the time to open up your heart  
Thats the secret of romance  
  
Sacrifice if you care  
Buy her some moonlight to wear  
If theres one more star she wants  
Go all the way  
  
In your arms tonight  
Shell reflect that she owes you  
The sweetest of debts if she wants to pay  
Find one hundred ways  
  
In your arms tonight  
Shell reflect that she owes you  
The sweetest of debts if she wants to pay  
Find one hundred ways  
  
Ya gotta believe it whoa  
Love her today  
Find one hundred ways
