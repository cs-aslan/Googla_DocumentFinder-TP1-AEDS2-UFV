Love me or leave me  
Make your choice but believe me  
I love you  
I do I do I do I do I do  
  
I cant conceal it  
Dont you see  
Cant you feel it  
Dont you too  
I do I do I do I do I do  
  
Oh Ive been dreaming through my lonely past  
Now Ive just made it  
I found you at last  
So come on  
Now lets try it  
I love you  
Cant deny it  
Cause its true  
I do I do I do I do I do  
  
Oh no hard feelings between you and me  
If we cant make it  
But just wait and see  
  
So come on now lets try it  
I love you cant deny it  
Cause its true I do I do I do I do I do  
  
So love me or leave me  
Make your choice but believe me

I cant conceal it dont you see  
Cant you feel it  
Dont you too I do I do I do I do I do
