When you give more than you get youre in danger youre in danger  
You may find that youre in love with a stranger with a stranger  
For who knows what evil lurks within the hearts of men  
Its vanity insanity to play when you cant win  
When you find that youre losing its time to get on moving  
Cause theres danger heartbreak dead ahead  
  
It only takes one second girl to learn to learn  
That playing with fire will get you burned get you burned  
Now girl dont you be foolish  
They say that love is blind but its clear as the highway sign  
That reads Danger heartbreak dead ahead  
Heartbreak dead ahead  
  
Read the sign girl youd better mind girl  
Yeah danger heartbreak dead ahead  
  
Once the lying starts start packing up your heart  
Listen to me girl  
When theres nothing to be gained dont keep goin on in vain  
Cause theres danger heartbreak dead ahead  
I said theres danger I said theres danger
