Well I guess this is where I left my life  
And all its operations  
And I know that I will never get this twice  
With all negotiations  
  
This feels like the place between what is and might have been  
So I guess this is where we both find out  
If this was meant to be  
And Ill tell myself I dont need you  
Ill tell myself enough to get me through  
But Ill finally show you how I should have been being with you every day  
If you can take a little more  
  
Now it takes me back to times on Lincoln Avenue  
When you said youd never get tired of the boy  
That seemed to be so far from growing up  
But we were different then  
  
This feels like the place between being ready and being in the way  
And Ill tell myself I dont need you  
Ill tell myself enough to get me through  
But Ill finally show you how I should have been being with you every day  
If you can wait a little more  
  
This feels like the time that Im ready for you  
Are you ready for me  
Cause Ill tell myself Ill make it through  
Ill tell myself anything to get over you  
  
And I wont blame you but Im finally ready to show you  
That Im ready to show you Im ready to show you yeah  
Ill tell myself that I never needed anybody anyway but anyway  
I need you  
I need you now  
I need you now  
Im ready now
