Singing ooh said ooh ooh lazy love  
  
Ooh my lobby call was 1130  
Im officially the opposite of early  
I gotta go downstairs downstairs  
Everybody waiting down there for me  
But I roll over into your curly hair  
And sexy body oh so nice and curvy yeah  
Reminiscing on last night  
Wake up baby let me get it one more time before before before  
I gotta go I got responsibilities I gotta take care of  
Ohwhoa ohwhoa thats when you wrap them legs around me  
And I fall victim to that lazy love  
  
Oh you got that I dont wanna  
That I dont wanna go nowhere that lazy love  
Hey you got that I dont wanna  
That I dont wanna do nothing you got that lazy love  
Oh you got that I dont wanna  
That I dont wanna do nothing that lazy love  
Oh you got that I dont wanna  
That I dont wanna do nothing  
  
Damn baby that was good Im gon hit the shower  
Even though Im about two hours late  
But I cant help it man  
If they knew what I knew they would understand understand  
Im washing last night off time to boss up  
When suddenly on my back I feel a soft touch  
She right behind me  
Water glisten off her body  
Looking at me like one more time  
But baby I gotta go I got responsibilities I gotta take care of  
Thats when you wrap them legs around me  
And I fall victim to that lazy love  
  
Oh you got that I dont wanna  
That I dont wanna go nowhere you got that lazy love  
Hey you got that I dont wanna  
That I dont wanna do nothing you got that lazy love  
Hey you got that I dont wanna  
That I dont wanna do nothing you got that lazy love  
Oh you got that I dont wanna  
That I dont wanna do nothing
