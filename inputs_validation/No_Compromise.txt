Dont tell me that you dont think it wont sell  
Thats just a fucking lousy lie  
If they dont like it it doesnt do well  
Well give them something else to buy  
If you wanna do it go ahead  
Life aint to long you cant hang around  
If you conform you might as well be dead  
Be sure of what you want and what youve found  
When you say theres no other way  
I just laugh know its not true  
Its just them what they say its not you  
What are you afraid of Do you know  
Do you begin to realise  
Just let it out let it show  
Dont compromise  
Dont compromise  
Dont think what you parents might say  
If its too noisy fast and loud  
Just fuck em all and do it anyway  
Stand up and be proud  
If you wanna  
When you say  
Dont try to be something youre not  
We can see through you who youre ripping off  
Try hard give it your best shot  
You may go far
