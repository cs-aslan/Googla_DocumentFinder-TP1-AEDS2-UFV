Be honest with me dear whatever you do  
Remember youre mine dear so always be true  
Where ever you wander on land or on sea  
If you really love me be honest with me  
  
My poor heart would break dear if you were untrue  
Asleep or awake dear I dream about you  
Oh you are my darling youre all that I see  
If you really love me be honest with me  
  
Some day Ill return dear kinda make you my own  
And how I will yearn dear when Im all alone  
But I never forget dear your sweet memory  
If you really love me be honest with me
