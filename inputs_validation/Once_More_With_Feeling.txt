Were just goin through the motions  
Of the parts weve learned to play  
Never quite together like before  
But somehow darlin something good  
Got lost along the way  
And our song aint nothing  
Special anymore  
  
Lets try it one more time  
With feeling darlin take it from the top  
Let me feel those tears a fallin babe  
I dont want to miss a single drop  
Darlin make believe your makin  
Me believe each word you say  
Try it once more with feeling  
And well call it a day  
  
Ah youre reachin out to touch me  
Darlin just the way you used to do  
An youre lookin everywhere but  
In my eyes  
Well thats an oldy but its a goody babe  
But them words aint ringin true  
And you dont seem very sure of your life  
  
So try it one more time with feeling  
Darlin take it from the top  
This one is the big one baby so give  
It everything you got  
Darlin make believe your makin me  
Believe each word you say  
Lets try it once more with feeling  
And well call it a day
