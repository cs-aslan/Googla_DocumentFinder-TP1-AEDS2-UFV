Im finding out how hot an old flame can burn  
Youre a feeling I havent forgot the love I cant unlearn  
Youve become a memory I cant live without  
Youll always be a fire I cant put out  
  
Chorus  
I dont know how to handle the dream you left behind  
Its like a lighted candle burning up my mind  
At least Im happy knowing what love is all about  
Youll always be a fire I cant put out  
  
Embers to ashes thats how it should be  
Youd think by now my heart would know and it could set you free  
The things Ive tried the tears Ive cried I guess theres no doubt  
Youll always be a fire I cant put out  
  
Chorus  
  
Youll always be a fire I cant put out
