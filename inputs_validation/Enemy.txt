Oh oh oh oh  
So back Im so bad Im so bad  
Can I be honest with you please  
Its really hard for me to speak right now  
Girl I been drinkin all day  
Its been a long week  
Cant you tell by my face  
I wanna lose myself between your legs  
I wanna make your body shake  
Girl if you drink this fifth no chase  
I promise youll have nothing to say  
Cause at least I deserve this no conversation  
I been working all week  
Id rather be your enemy  
Than any friend you think I would be  
  
Hook  
Im just tryin take you home without a word  
Im just trying to kiss your neck without a word  
Im just trying to lay you down without a word  
Im just trying to get you high without a word  
Im just trying to make you numb without a word  
Im just trying to make you cum without a word  
Im just trying to make you sleep without a word  
Girl Im just trying to let you leave without a word  
  
Please please please  
Let me be the enemy  
  
I forgot how it feels to regret my sins  
I need that old thing back baby  
You can help me out baby  
You remind me of a feeling that I used to have  
So I dont know what to expect from you tonight  
But Im not trying to waste nobodys time  
Im just trying to find material some inspiration  
We can put it in a song if you want  
But at least I deserve is no conversation  
I been working all week  
Id rather be your enemy  
Than any friend you think I would be  
  
Hook  
  
I never fall for a girl like you  
Ill never understand what youre going through  
But your body poppin your head game too  
You lookin at my nigga you can have him too  
Cause baby I aint perfect girl I hope you knew  
There aint nothin wrong you can pick and choose  
Just dont call tomorrow askin what did I do  
You know what you did all to blame is you  
Now the least I deserve is no conversation  
I been working all week  
Id rather be your enemy  
Than any friend you think I would be  
  
Hook
