What can I do what can I say  
Running down this suspicious highway  
I cant forget how love let me down  
And when we meet it still gets in my way  
  
But were already one  
Already one  
Now only time can come between us  
Cause were already one  
Our little son wont let us forget  
  
Your laughing eyes your crazy smile  
Every time I look in his face  
I cant believe how love lasts a while  
And looks like forever in the first place  
  
But were already one  
Already one  
Now only time can come between us  
Cause were already one  
Our little son wont let us forget  
  
In my new life Im travelin light  
Eyes wide open for the next move  
I cant go wrong til I get right  
But Im not fallin back in the same groove  
  
But were already one  
Already one  
Now only time can come between us  
Cause were already one  
Our little son wont let us forget
