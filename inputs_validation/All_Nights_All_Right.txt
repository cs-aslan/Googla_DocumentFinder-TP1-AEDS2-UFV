Ooh ooh  
Youre all alone  
Well so am I  
We could dance all night  
Are you willing to try  
All nights all right  
If youre in no hurry  well  
Neither am I  
Do you like to boogie  
Well just stop on by  
All nights all right  
All nights all right  
  
Ooh ooh  
Mamas away  
Daddy too  
Me and you all alone  
With nothing to do  
All nights all right  
Were taking it slow  
Were taking it fast  
Do you like tomorrow  
Make it last  
All nights all right  
All nights all right  
  
All nights all right  
All nights all right  
All nights all right
