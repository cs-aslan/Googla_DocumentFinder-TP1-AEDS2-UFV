I had a dream so big and loud  
I jumped so high I touched the clouds  
Wooooooh x2  
I stretched my hands out to the sky  
We danced with monsters through the night  
Wooooooh x2  
  
Im never gonna look back  
Woah never gonna give it up  
No please dont wake me now  
  
Ooooooo  
This is gonna be the best day of my liife  
My liiiiiife  
Ooooooo  
This is gonna be the best day of my liife  
My liiiiiife  
  
I howled at the moon with friends  
And then the sun came crashing in  
Wooooooh x2  
But all the possibilities  
No limits just epiphanies  
Wooooooh x2  
  
Im never gonna look back  
Woah never gonna give it up  
No just dont wake me now  
  
Ooooooo  
This is gonna be the best day of my liife  
My liiiiiife  
Ooooooo  
This is gonna be the best day of my liife  
My liiiiiife  
  
I hear it calling outside my window  
I feel it in my soul soul  
The stars were burning so bright  
The sun was out til midnight  
I say we lose control control  
  
This is gonna be the best day of my liife  
My liiiiiife  
Oooooo  
This is gonna be the best day of my liife  
My liiiiiife  
This is gonna be this is gonna be this is gonna be  
The best day of my life  
Everything is looking up everybody up now  
This is gonna be the best day of my liife  
My liiiiiife
