Who put the palm over my blond  
Who put all the tar on the morning sand  
Who took everything from where it once was  
And put it where it was last seen  
  
Fontainebleau they painted it green  
Fontainebleau for the welltodo  
At the Fontainebleau  
  
Theres a palace in the gravy  
Thats holding on and on and on  
Even after all the bluehaired ladies  
And the wheelchairs are gone  
  
I guess the reason Im so scared of it  
Is I stayed there once and I almost fit  
I left before I got out of it  
People were drownin in their own  
  
Fontainebleau  
Fontainebleau was that me  
Fontainebleau well I guess Ill see  
Fontainebleau  
  
Fontainebleau where the surfer works  
Fontainebleau til the break of day  
Fontainebleau cause it takes a shark  
Fontainebleau to catch a wave at the Fontainebleau
