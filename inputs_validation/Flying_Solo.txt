Feat Dr Dre  
  
Departure time 7 30  
Im packed and ready to go  
First class ticket outta here  
I think its time  
To put it back in gear  
No more standing by  
Im tryin to stay clear  
  
Turbulence got me nervous  
I should have never flown  
Scared when you  
Fly alone again  
You know the atmosphere  
Wasnt perfect  
Im thinkin to myself  
Was it worth it  
  
Layovers almost over  
I can see clearly  
No more stormy weather  
Exit row  
Dont pull on  
The lever lever  
This gon be  
My final destination  
No more sittin round  
Havin my time wasted  
  
You say its now or never  
I pick never  
We can be together  
So calm down  
No more red eye late nights  
Im one way  
No more connected flights  
  
When we stared out knew  
This relationship  
Was unhealthy  
You broke the code  
Never thought  
That you would stoop so low  
You got me flyin solo  
Now you cryin talkin bout you  
Cant live without me yeah  
  
Youve got me flying solo  
Solo solo  
  
Touchin down 11 30  
Im rushing  
Through the doors  
Im in a good place now  
Cant find my baggage  
And I dont even want it back  
And I dont want  
To have you no more  
  
I dont need to carry on  
Its gonna weight me down  
He didnt think  
That I would find out  
Whether or not  
Who is wrong or right  
I cant talk now  
I gotta catch another flight  
  
Layovers almost over  
I can see clearly  
No more stormy weather  
Exit row dont pull  
On the lever lever  
This gon be  
My final destination  
  
No more sittin round  
Havin my time wasted  
  
You say its now or never  
I pick never  
We can be together s  
O calm down  
No more red eye late nights  
Im one way  
No more connected flights  
  
When we stared out knew  
This relationship  
Was unhealthy  
You broke the code  
Never thought  
That you would stoop so low  
You got me flyin solo  
Now you cryin talkin bout you  
Cant live without me yeah  
  
Youve got me flying solo  
Solo solo  
  
Four hours scared to fly  
Without you here  
Now you cant get  
Under my skin  
Like you did before  
Why  
I was reluctant  
To walk out on us  
So now Im taking  
Back my life  
Goodbye  
  
When we stared out knew  
This relationship  
Was unhealthy  
You broke the code  
Never thought  
That you would stoop so low  
You got me flyin solo  
Now you cryin talkin bout you  
Cant live without me yeah  
  
Youve got me flying solo  
Solo solo
