For your own good  
Call me tonight  
Dont you think you should  
Call me tonight  
Life isnt easy  
So why dont you stay  
With the lover you need  
And not the devil you pay  
For your own good  
Call me tonight  
  
For your own good  
Call me tonight  
Dont you think I could  
Make a difference tonight  
When you need a lover  
And its so cold outside  
I could help you recover  
From pain that you hide  
Life isnt easy  
So why dont you stay  
With the lover you need  
And not the devil you pay  
For your own good  
Call me tonight  
  
Come on call me  
  
Call me tonight  
Ill make you feel good  
Come on call me  
Come on call me  
Call me tonight  
Ill make you feel good  
Want your body  
Want your body  
  
Come on call me  
Come on call me  
  
For your own good  
Call me tonight
