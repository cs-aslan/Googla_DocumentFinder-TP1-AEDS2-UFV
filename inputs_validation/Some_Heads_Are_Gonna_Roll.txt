You can look to the left and  
Look to the right  
But you will live in danger tonight  
When the enemy comes he will  
Never be heard  
Hell blow your mind and not say a word  
Blinding lights flashing colors  
Sleepless nights  
If the man with the power  
Cant keep it under control  
  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
  
The powermad freaks who are  
Ruling the earth  
Will show how little they think youre worth  
With animal lust theyll  
Devour your life  
And slice your word to bits like a knife  
One last day burning hell fire  
Youre blown away  
If the man with the power  
Cant keep it under control  
  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
  
Know what its like  
When youre taken for granted  
There goes your life  
Its so underhanded  
If the man with the power  
Cant keep it under control  
  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll
