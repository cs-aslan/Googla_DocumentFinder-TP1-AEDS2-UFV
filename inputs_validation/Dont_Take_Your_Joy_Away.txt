Dont take your joy away  
Dont take your joy away  
I know that I have done wrong  
But Im asking You as I sing this song  
Dont take your joy away  
  
Dont take it  
I cant make it  
Ive tried it  
I cant live without it  
  
Restore unto me the joy of my salvation  
Make me Jesus a new creation  
Shake me and make me  
Hold me and mold me  
Choose me and use me  
Chastise me  
Revive me
