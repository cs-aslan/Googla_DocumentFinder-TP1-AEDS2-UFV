I crossed on the river  
Therell be no returning  
I crossed all the bridges  
I watched them all burning  
And now Im a stranger  
To a strange land Im driven  
Where all is forgotten  
And nothings forgiven  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
Thats deeper and wider  
Than Ill ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
I think of him now  
On the road I am taking  
And wonder how long  
His heart will be breaking  
But hell never hear when  
The teardrops are falling  
Or the sound of my voice  
Or the name I am calling  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
Thats deeper and wider  
Than Ill ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
So weep for the sons  
And the dear darling daughters  
For the passing of time  
And the parting of waters  
For all who have passed through  
This world long before me  
To a far distant shore line  
Where no one waits for me  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
Thats deeper and wider  
Than Ill ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him
