Open up your arms to me  
Come and hold me tenderly  
Let me know your love for me is real  
And love me like theres no tomorrow  
Share my joys and share my sorrow  
Make me feel like a woman wants to feel  
  
Repeat x2  
I know you love me cause you told me so  
But that aint enough cause I want to be shown  
Make me feel like a woman wants to feel  
And let me know you miss me when Im not around  
Go ahead and kiss me when Im feeling down  
Make me feel like a woman wants to feel  
  
Love me like I want to be loved  
Let me know Im the one you dream of  
Make me feel like a woman wants to feel  
Make me feel like a woman wants to feel
