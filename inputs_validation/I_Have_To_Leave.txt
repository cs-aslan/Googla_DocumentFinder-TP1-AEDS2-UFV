This time I have to leave  
Its all to clear  
Its plain to see  
No use in hanging round  
Like a dog that whines and cries  
This time I have to leave  
  
Did you hear that Im attached  
Im on a dead end path  
Cant you see it hurts me so  
But I really got to go  
This time I have to leave  
  
Well Im gonna disappear  
Stayed too long Ill shake my tears  
You gave your all we werent shy  
So thanks again its been nice  
But this time I have to leave  
Its all too clear  
Its plain to see  
No use in hanging round  
They tell me Im outta bounds  
This time I have to leave  
  
Well it looks as though Ill be gone for awhile  
So try not to get too riled  
Therell be another time  
When we can unwind  
But I got to get it on down the line  
  
This time I have to leave  
Its all too clear  
Its plain to see  
No use in hanging round  
Youll get by somehow  
This time I have to leave  
  
But love wont go away  
I feel Ive got to stay  
And go on living a lie  
With you I know theres no goodbye  
This time I have to leave  
Its all too clear  
Its plain to see  
No use in hanging round  
After all anyway anyhow  
This time I have to leave
