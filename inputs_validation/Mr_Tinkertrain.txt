Would you like some sweeties little girl  
Come a little closer  
Im gonna show you a brand new world tonight  
Ive got a palace full of fantasy  
Ready made just for you and me  
Once youre there Im gonna take you for a ride  
I got a one way ticket  
To take you to the other side  
I got a one way ticket  
So come along and dont be shy  
They call Mr Tinker Train  
Thats how I got to get my name  
They call me Mr Tinker Train  
So come along and play my game  
Youll never be the same  
Close the curtains and turn out the lights  
Beneath my wing its gonna be alright  
A little secret just for you and me  
Ive got the kind of toys youve never seen  
Manmade and a bit obscene  
Little angel come and sit upon my knee  
  
Mr Tinker Train  
Nevr be the same  
Mr Tinker Train  
Can you say Mr Tinker Train  
No use crying cause you cant go back  
Now youre here to stay  
You cant run you cant hide  
You cant tell me what I feel inside  
Mr Tinker Train  
Whats how I go to get my name  
They call me Mr Tinker Train  
So come along and play my game  
Thats why they call me Mr Tinker Train
