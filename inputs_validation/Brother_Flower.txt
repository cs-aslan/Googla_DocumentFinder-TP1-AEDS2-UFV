Brother Flower are you listenin  
Let me sing a song for you  
Brother Flower petals glistenin  
In the bashful mornings dew  
Brother Flower when the sun shines  
And the dew has flown away  
If you dont mind weak and wrong rhymes  
Brother Flower may I stay  
  
Brother Flower you aint lonely  
For youve always been alone  
But I havent been so lucky  
I had love and now its gone  
I have arms to hold another  
Never to hold her again  
I have life to give lover  
You have life to give the wind  
  
Brother Flower when the snow flies  
And you lay your beauty down  
Brother Flower are you sleepin  
There upon the cold cold ground  
Brother Flower please awaken  
Show the sky your face of blue  
Let me know I aint forsaken  
Seems like all I have is you
