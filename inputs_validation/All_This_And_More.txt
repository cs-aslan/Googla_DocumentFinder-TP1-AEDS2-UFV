Its not that Im so cheerful though Ill always raise a smile  
And if at times my nonsense rhymes then Ill stand trial  
My friends are all around me but they only breathe through fear  
Were I to cry Im sure that still theyd never see a tear  
  
In darkness through my being here away from you  
The bright light of your star confronts me shining through  
  
Dull and sullen much subdued my skull a stony glaze  
Whirlpools rage on constantly Im not so well these days  
There must be something somewhere near who sees whats being done  
The harbor lights are burning bright my wax is almost run  
  
In darkness through my being here away from you  
The bright light of your star confronts me shining through  
  
Come Lollard raise your lute and sing and to my ears her beauty bring  
Like Maddox in the days of old well feast and drink until we fold  
And folding still well spare a thought for whats been lost and whats been
caught  
And maybe then begin again for love is life not poison  
  
In darkness through my being here away from you  
The bright light of your star confronts me shining through
