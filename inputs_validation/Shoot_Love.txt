You gotta let it go  
Cause were losing grip now  
Its about to go down  
With you let me talk to you  
You gotta let me know  
Cause Im on the edge now  
Of a nervebreakdown  
Cause I cant get through to you  
  
I got my head just spinning  
Got my head up spinning  
Dont shoot love baby  
Dont shoot love  
Dont shoot love baby  
Dont shoot  
When you get that feeling  
When you get that feeling  
Dont shoot love baby  
Dont shoot love  
Dont shoot love baby  
Dont shoot  
  
You never let me go  
Got me chained to your touch  
Like a slave for you love  
Im ashamed to say its true  
Afraid to let you go  
Cause without you Im lost  
And not matter the cost  
Im standing next to you  
  
I got my head just spinning  
Got my head up spinning  
Dont shoot love baby  
Dont shoot love  
Dont shoot love baby  
Dont shoot  
When you get that feeling  
When you get that feeling  
Dont shoot love baby  
Dont shoot love  
Dont shoot love baby  
Dont shoot  
  
My backs against the world tonight  
So go ahead pull the trigger  
Shoot the lights out  
So go ahead pull the trigger  
Shoot the lights out  
I see the fear thats in your eyes  
So go ahead pull the trigger  
Shoot the lights out  
Go ahead pull the trigger  
Shoot  
  
I got my head just spinning  
Got my head up spinning  
Dont shoot love baby  
Dont shoot love  
Dont shoot love baby  
Dont shoot  
When you get that feeling  
When you get that feeling  
Dont shoot love baby  
Dont shoot love  
Dont shoot love baby  
Dont shoot
