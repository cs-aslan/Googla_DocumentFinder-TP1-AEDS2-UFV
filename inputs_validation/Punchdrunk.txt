Did I park my car  
If I found it I would drive so far from here  
The city streets are dim  
And my hands are tempted once again  
To give in  
  
Im having trouble seeing  
Im punch drunk and  
I need to find a way back home  
Itd be a miracle if youd oblige  
  
I will survive  
On this island I am stuck  
Could you correct my crooked luck tonight  
  
On the road my thumb is out  
Im hitchin home tonight I am without a name  
Where was it that I lived  
Well nevermind just take me with you  
And forget  
  
The lack of information  
Im punch drunk and  
I need to find a way back home  
Itd be a miracle if youd oblige  
  
I will survive  
On this island I am stuck  
Could you correct my crooked luck tonight  
  
I will survive  
Tonight I wander and I roam  
Just lookin for a way back home tonight  
  
The sun is coming up  
I think Ive had my fill  
Wait who the fuck are you  
Where did I park my car  
Please forgive my  
  
Lack of information  
Im punch drunk and  
I need to find a way back home  
Itd be a miracle oh  
  
Im having trouble seeing  
Im punch drunk and  
I need to find a way back home  
Itd be a miracle if youd oblige  
  
I will survive  
On this island I am stuck  
Could you correct my crooked luck tonight  
  
I will survive  
Tonight I wander and I roam  
Just lookin for a way back home tonight  
  
Spare me a ride a ride tonight  
Spare me a ride a ride tonight  
  
On this island I am stuck  
Could you correct my crooked luck tonight
