Little girl dont you want to stay  
I want to be your lover man  
All by myself  
All by myself  
  
I dont need no one to love you  
Im gonna love you all by myself  
  
Youll find little girl you know it too  
Dont you know Im in love with you  
All by myself  
All by myself  
  
I dont want no one to love you  
I want to love you all by myself  
  
Meet me in the parlor bout half past one  
Well go on down and have some fun  
All by ourselves  
All by ourselves  
We dont need nobody with us  
We gonna do it all by ourselves
