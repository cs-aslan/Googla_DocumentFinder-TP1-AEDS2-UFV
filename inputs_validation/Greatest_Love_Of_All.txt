I believe the children are our are future  
Teach them well and let them lead the way  
Show them all the beauty they possess inside  
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier  
Let the childrens laughter remind us how we used to be  
Everybody searching for a hero  
People need someone to look up to  
I never found anyone who fulfill my needs  
A lonely place to be  
So I learned to depend on me  
  
Chorus  
I decided long ago never to walk in anyones shadows  
If I fail if I succeed  
At least Ill live as I believe  
No matter what they take from me  
They cant take away my dignity  
Because the greatest love of all  
Is happening to me  
I found the greatest love of all  
Inside of me  
The greatest love of all  
Is easy to achieve  
Learning to love yourself  
It is the greatest love of all  
  
I believe the children are our future  
Teach them well and let them lead the way  
Show them all the beauty they possess inside  
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier  
Let the childrens laughter remind us how we used to be  
  
Chorus  
  
And if by chance that special place  
That youve been dreaming of  
Leads you to a lonely place  
Find your strength in love
