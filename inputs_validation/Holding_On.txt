Lost lost like a precious flame  
The ashes burn on  
The ghost of a love we had  
Tries to hold on tries to hold on  
  
No communication  
All systems are down  
No new conversation  
Never a sound never a sound  
  
Whats the point in holdin on  
When the spirit is gone holdin on  
Whats the point in holdin on  
When the spirit is gone  
  
Cold cold as the empty night  
Deep in your eyes  
I know theres no truth no light  
Only your lies only your lies  
  
The circles broken  
The damage is done  
The crystal lies  
Smashed on the floor  
  
Your presence has left me now  
Your spirit has gone  
The ghost of a love we had  
Tries to hold on tries to hold on  
  
The circles broken  
The damage is done  
So whats the point in holdin on
