Its a 360 turn  
Sittin where we begin  
Like beginnin  
And heres the end  
Like kissin  
And missin class  
But what  
We needed to learn  
Was different  
Than just some math  
Its the big picture  
We missed it  
The big figures  
Just didnt add up  
  
We said  
Lets noy leave on bad terms  
In between  
Them bad words  
This could be love right  
Uh huh  
But are we gon leave  
When its this good  
Damnit we just cause  
Seems this lovins  
All for nothing  
Baby you know  
  
Chorus  
A heart aint a brain  
But I think  
That I still love you  
A happy endin  
Makes it right  
Cause it ends  
When you dont want to  
And it makes perfect sense  
To end it like the start  
How do I explain  
This nonsense to my heart  
A heart aint a brain  
But Im thinkin  
That I still love you  
  
Its a fly twist  
Just when you said  
I got this  
Right when the fight  
Has stopped it  
Seem my body felt wrong  
Held on them nights  
We held on  
We cant let it go  
But if we dont then  
We will never know  
  
We we said lets not leave on bad terms  
In between those bad words  
This could be love right  
Uh huh  
But are we gon leave  
When its this good  
Damnit we just cause  
Seems this lovins  
All for nothing  
Baby you know  
  
Chorus
