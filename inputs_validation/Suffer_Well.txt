Where were you when I fell from grace  
Frozen heart an empty space  
Somethings changing its in your eyes  
Please dont speak youll only lie  
I found treasure not where I thought  
Peace of mind cant be bought  
Still I believe  
  
Chorus  
I just hang on  
Suffer well  
Sometimes its hard  
Its hard to tell  
  
An angel led me when I was blind  
I said take me back Ive changed my mind  
Now I believe  
From the blackest room I was torn  
He called my name a love was born  
So I believe  
  
Chorus x2
