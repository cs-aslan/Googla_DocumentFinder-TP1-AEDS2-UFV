Theres a steam beat  
And its comin after you  
You can take it  
If you only let your feelings through  
Refrain  
So DJ spin the sounds  
There aint no way that your gonna  
Let us down  
Gonna dance gonna burn this disco out  
  
Chorus  
Groove all night  
Keep the boogie alright  
Get that sound  
Everybody just get on down  
  
Got a hot foot  
Better freak across the floor  
Join the party  
And well keep you movin thats for sure  
  
So DJ spin the sounds  
There aint no way that your gonna  
Sit us down  
Gonna dance til we burn this disco out  
  
Chorus  
  
Once you get the beat inside your feet  
There aint no way to stop you movin good  
Now the weekends come its time for fun  
You got to groove just like you know you should  
  
People now  
Are you ready  
Wont you rock across the room  
Got a feelin  
That were gonna raise the roof off soon  
  
So DJ spin the sounds  
There aint no way that your gonna  
Sit us down  
Gonna dance til we burn this disco out  
  
Chorus  
  
So DJ spin the sounds  
There aint no way that your gonna  
Sit us down  
Gonna dance til we burn this disco out  
  
Chorus

Gonna burn this disco out  
Gonna dance gonna shout  
Gonna burn this disco out  
Gonna dance gonna shout
