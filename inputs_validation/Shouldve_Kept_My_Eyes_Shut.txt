I shouldve kept my eyes shut  
But I had to go and peep  
But when you saw what I saw  
Well its hard just to roll back to sleep  
  
I wouldve kept my eyes shut  
But I thought I heard you scream  
And Ive a penchant for violence  
You dont seem to find in a dream  
  
The scene a little clearer  
My father with a rope  
And in the cage centrestage  
Its mother whos destined to choke  
  
And she choke and we choke  
On the words that we wish wed not spoke  
Just when you felt you had someone to trust  
Out comes the man with the dagger and cloak  
  
I shouldve read the novels  
Believed every word  
But the stories they wrote  
Were so different to ones that Id heard  
  
I shouldve kept my eyes shut  
My mouth shouldve closed  
But the mixture of vomit and blood  
Just crept up through my nose  
  
It became a little clearer  
As soon as I awoke  
My father stands with rope in hand  
A screaming mother kneels in hope  
  
And she hope and we hope  
That me words that she said wont provoke  
A smile is removed and a petal is crushed  
What once was a laugh has turned into a joke  
  
You shouldve kept your mouth shut
