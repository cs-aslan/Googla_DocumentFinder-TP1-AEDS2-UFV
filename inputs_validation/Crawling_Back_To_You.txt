Everybody knows that I was such a fool to ever let go of you  
And baby I was wrong  
And yeah I know I said wed be better off alone  
It was time that we moved on  
I know I broke your heart I didnt mean to break your heart  
  
But baby here I am banging on your front door  
My pride spilled on the floor  
My hands and knees are bruised and Im crawling back to you  
Im begging for a second chance  
Are you gonna let me in  
I was running from the truth and now Im crawling back to you  
  
I know you arent there and you can make me wait but Im not gonna wait  
Its the that least I could do just to tell you face to face  
I was lying to myself now Im dying in this hell  
Girl I know youre mad  
I cant blame you for being mad  
  
But baby here I am banging on your front door  
My pride spilled on the floor  
My hands and knees are bruised and now Im crawling back to you  
Im begging for a second chance  
Are you gonna let me in  
I was running from the truth and now Im crawling back to you  
  
If you could see these tears Im crying  
Touch these hands that cant stop shaking  
Hear the heart thats barely beating you would see a different man  
  
But baby here I am banging on your front door  
My pride spilled on the floor  
My hands and knees are bruised and Im crawling back to you  
Im begging for a second chance  
Are you gonna let me in  
I was running from the truth and now Im crawling back to you
