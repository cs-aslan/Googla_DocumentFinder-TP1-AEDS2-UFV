Verse 1  
If graffiti on the wall changed anything at all  
Then it would be illegal  
As  go away what would your body say  
Dont ever hide your feelings  
  
Refrain  
Oh oh oh  
Dont ever try to take my freedom  
Oh oh oh  
Your imperfections this world needs them

What do you got Show me your box   
He didnt keep it all to himself  
Even with  out on the street he died  
Fighting so you can do it as well  
  
Chorus  
Love is pain and pain is art  
Show me your graffiti heart  
Love is pain and pain is art  
Show me your graffiti heart  
  
Woahoohohoohohoh  
Woahoohohoohohoh yeah  
Woahoohohoohohoh  
Woahoohohoohohoh yeah

Back in the beginning  
Nothings what it seems she painted all her dreams  
Made her own reality  
  
Refrain  
Oh oh oh  
Dont ever try to take my freedom  
Oh oh oh  
Your imperfections this world needs them

This wall it must fall  
To make room for our masterpiece
