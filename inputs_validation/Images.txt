I think images are worth repeating  
Images repeated from a painting  
Images taken from a painting  
From a photo worth reseeing  
I love images worth repeating project them upon the ceiling  
Multiply them with silk screening  
See them with a different feeling  
Images images images images  
  
Some say images have no feeling I think theres a deeper meaning  
Mechanical precision or so its seeming  
Instigates a cooler feeling  
I love multiplicity of screenings  
Things born anew display new meanings  
I think images are worth repeating and repeating and repeating  
  
Im no urban idiot savant spewing paint without any order  
Im no sphinx no mystery enigma  
What I paint is very ordinary  
I dont think Im old or modern I dont think I think  
Im thinking  
It doesnt matter what I am thinking  
Its the images that are worth repeating  
Images images images images  
  
If youre looking for a deeper meaning Im as deep as this high ceiling  
If you think technique is meaning you might find me very simple  
You might think the images boring  
Cars and cans and chairs and flowers  
You might find me personally boring  
Hammer sickle Mao Tse Tung Mao Tse Tung   
I think that it bears repeating the images upon the ceiling  
I love images worth repeating and repeating and repeating  
Images images images images
