Theres no present theres no future  
I dont even know about the past  
Its all timeless and never ending  
To take it in its all too vast  
  
It goes forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes  
Tomorrow  
  
Journey to the center of eternity  
Journey to the center of eternity  
  
The time is coming but also going  
And its leaving never to return  
Maybe forever it could be heaven  
But if its hell then you can watch me burn  
  
It goes forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes  
Tomorrow  
  
I got to travel forever  
Its all within my mind  
An endless path to endeavor  
But forever is a long long time  
  
Theres no secrets and no corruption  
In the center of infinity  
Theres no limits in nonexistence  
And no beginning to my destiny  
  
It goes forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes  
Tomorrow  
  
Journey to the center of eternity  
Journey to the center of eternity
