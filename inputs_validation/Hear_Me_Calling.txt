I enter your life now make no mistake  
Can you reach me can you reach me  
I enter your life now make no mistake  
Can you reach me can you touch me  
  
Chorus  
Can you hear me calling in the night  
My loves so strong I cant get it right  
Can you feel my longing through the night  
Youve got me totally hypnotized  
  
I came in a black dress and left in a white  
Can you reach me can you reach me  
I came in a black dress and left in a white  
Can you reach me can you touch me  
  
Chorus  
  
Looking for eyes the dream is so nice  
The rhythm of the song where you belong  
I want is your heart and soul  
  
Hm Im high on emotion youre here with me  
You cam reach me you can reach me  
Hm Im high on emotion youre here with me  
You cam reach me you can touch me  
  
Chorus  
  
Hypnotized I am hypnotized
