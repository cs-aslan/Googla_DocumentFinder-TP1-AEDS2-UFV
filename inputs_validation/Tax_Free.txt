Front rooms  
Back rooms  
Slide into tables  
Crowd into bathrooms  
Joke around  
Cheap talk  
Deep talk  
Talk talk talk around the clock  
Crawl home  
Lie down  
Teeth chatter  
Heart pounds  
I dont feel so good  
I dont feel so good  
Push a button to escape  
Preacher on the tube crying Lord  
Theres evil in this land  
  
Rock and roll music  
Cast down these dopefiends  
And there noisy bands  
Damn their souls  
  
Preacher preaching love like vengeance  
Preaching love like hate  
Calling for large donations  
Promising estates  
Rolling lawns and angel bands  
Behind the pearly gates  
You know he will have his in this life  
But yours will have to wait  
Hes immaculately tax free  
  
Multiple hundreds of thousands of  
Tax free  
Hundreds and millions of dollars  
Tax free  
A hundred billion dollars  
And who is paying the price  
Who who  
Your children are  
  
Pissed off  
Jacked up  
Scream into the mike  
Spit into the loving cup  
Strut like a rooster  
March like a man  
Gods hired hands and the devil bands  
Packing the same grandstands  
Different clothes  
Pot in their pockets  
Different hair  
Sexually active  
Raise a screaming guitar or a bible in the air  
Theater of anguish  
Theater of glory  
Gods hired hands and the devil bands  
Oh come let us adore me  
Lord theres danger in this land  
You get witchhunts and wars  
When church and state hold hands  
  
Fuck it  
Tonight Im going dancing  
With the drag queens and the punks  
Big beat deliver me  
From this sanctimonious skunk  
Were no flaming angels  
And hes not heaven sent  
How can he speak for the Prince of Peace  
When hes hawkright militant  
And hes immaculately tax free  
  
Our nation has lost its guts  
Save me  
Our nation has lost its strength  
Tax free  
Our nation has whimpered and cried  
Save me  
And petted the Castros  
Tax free  
The Khomeinis and the Kaddafis  
Save me  
For so long  
Tax free  
That we dont know how to act like a man  
Save me  
I think that we should turn the United States Marines  
loose on that little island south of Florida and  
stop that problem  
I am preachin love I am
