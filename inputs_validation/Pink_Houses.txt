Theres a black man with a black cat  
Living in a black neighborhood  
Hes got an interstate running through his front yard  
You know he thinks hes got it so good  
And theres a woman in the kitchen cleaning up evening slop  
And he looks at her and says  
Hey darling I can remember when you could stop a clock  
  
Oh but aint that America for you and me  
Aint that America were something to see baby  
Aint that America home of the free yeah  
Little pink houses for you and me oh for you and me  
  
Well theres a young man in a Tshirt  
Listenin to a rock n roll station  
Hes got a greasy hair greasy smile  
He says Lord this must be my destination  
Cause they told me when I was younger  
Sayin Boy youre gonna be president  
But just like everything else those old crazy dreams  
Just kinda came and went  
  
Oh but aint that America for you and me  
Aint that America were something to see baby  
Aint that America home of the free yeah  
Little pink houses for you and me oh baby for you and me  
  
Well theres people and more people  
What do they know know know  
Go to work in some high rise  
And vacation down at the Gulf of Mexico  
Ooo yeah  
  
And theres winners and theres losers  
But they aint no big deal  
Cause the simple man baby pays the thrills  
The bills and the pills that kill  
  
Oh but aint that America for you and me  
Aint that America were something to see baby  
Aint that America home of the free yeah  
Little pink houses for you and me ooo ooo yeah
