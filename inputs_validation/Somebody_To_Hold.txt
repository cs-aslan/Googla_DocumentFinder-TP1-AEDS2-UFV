Verse  
Im falling down low  
No hand that I can hold  
Im left behind  
They dont see the tears I cry  
  
I cuddle up  
Writing a song  
About how I feel  
They say thats crazy  
  
Hook  
They dont understand my life  
And the ways that I cry  
Mmmmmm  
Things are getting really hard  
Cant search on google for my love  
  
Chorus  
These nights are sleepless  
These nights are cold  
Wish I could have somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
Dont care if its for one night  
Ill make do  
I just want somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
Verse 2  
They treat like me like Im  
A mental patient  
Wish somebody  
Could be in sync with me  
  
Hook  
They dont understand my life  
And the ways that I cry  
Mmmmmm  
Things are getting really hard  
Cant search on google for my love  
  
Chorus  
These nights are sleepless  
These nights are cold  
Wish I could have somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
Dont care if its for one night  
Ill make do  
I just want somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
Slow part  
I hug the air  
When reality hits me  
And no ones there  
  
Oh yeah  
  
I hug the air  
When reality hits me  
I wish some one was there  
  
Chorus  
These nights are sleepless  
These nights are cold  
Wish I could have somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
Dont care if its for one night  
Ill make do  
I just want somebody  
Somebody to hold
