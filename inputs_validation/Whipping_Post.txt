Ive been run down and Ive been lied to  
And I dont know why I let that mean woman make me a fool  
She took all my money wrecks my new car  
Now shes with one of my good time buddies  
Theyre drinkin in some crosstown bar  
  
Sometimes I feel sometimes I feel  
Like I been tied to the whippin post  
Tied to the whippin post tied to the whippin post  
Good Lord I feel like Im dyin  
  
My friends tell me that Ive been such a fool  
But I had to stand by and take it baby all for lovin you  
Drown myself in sorrow as I look at what youve done  
But nothing seemed to change the bad times stayed the same  
And I cant run  
  
Sometimes I feel sometimes I feel  
Like I been tied to the whippin post  
Tied to the whippin post tied to the whippin post  
Good Lord I feel like Im dyin  
  
Sometimes I feel sometimes I feel  
Like I been tied to the whippin post  
Tied to the whippin post tied to the whippin post  
Good Lord I feel like Im dyin
