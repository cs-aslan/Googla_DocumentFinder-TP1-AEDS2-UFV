Thoughts in time and out of season  
The hitchhiker  
Stood by the side of the road  
And leveled his thumb  
In the calm calculus of reason  
  
Hi how you doin I just got back into town LA  
I was out on the desert for awhile  
Riders on the storm  
Yeah in the middle of it  
Riders on the storm  
Right  
Into this world were born  
Hey listen man I really got a problem  
Into this world were thrown  
When I was out on the desert ya know  
Like a dog without a bone  
An actor out on loan  
I dont know how to tell you  
Riders on the storm  
But ah I killed somebody  
Theres a killer on the road  
No  
His brain is squirming like a toad  
Its no big deal ya know  
I dont think anybody will find out about it but  
Take a long holiday  
Just ah  
Let your children play  
This guy gave me a ride and ah  
If you give this man a ride  
Started giving me a lot of trouble  
Sweet family will die  
And I just couldnt take it ya know  
Killer on the road  
And I wasted him  
Yeah
