Watching all the insects march along  
Seem to know just right where they belong  
Smears a face reflecting in the chrome  
Hiding in the crowd Im all alone  
No ones heard a single word Ive said  
They dont sound as good outside my head  
It looks as though the past is here to stay  
Ive become a million miles aw  
Why do you get all the love in the world  
Why do you get all the love in the world  
  
All the jagged edges disappear  
Colors all are brighter when youre near  
The stars are all afire in the sky  
Sometimes I get so lonely I could  
Why do you get all the love in the world  
Why do you get all the love in the world  
Why do you get all the love in the world  
Why do you get all the love in the world  
  
Why do you get all the love in the world  
Why do you get all the love in the world  
Why do you get all the love in the world  
Why do you get all the love in the world  
repeat
