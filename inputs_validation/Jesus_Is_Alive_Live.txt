Hallelujah Jesus is alive  
Death has lost its victory  
And the grave has been denied  
And Jesus lives forever  
Hes alive Hes alive  
  
Hes the alpha and omega  
The first and last is He  
The curse of sin is broken  
And we have perfect liberty  
The lamb of God has risen  
Hes alive Hes alive  
  
Hallelujah Jesus is alive  
Death has lost its victory  
And the grave has been denied  
Jesus lives forever  
Hes alive Hes alive  
  
Hes the alpha and omega  
The first and last is He  
The curse of sin is broken  
And we have perfect liberty  
The lamb of God has risen  
Hes alive Hes alive  
  
Hallelujah Jesus is alive  
Death has lost its victory  
And the grave has been denied  
Jesus lives forever  
Hes alive Hes alive  
  
Hes the alpha and omega  
The first and last is He  
The curse of sin is broken  
We have perfect liberty  
The lamb of God has risen  
Hes alive Hes alive  
  
Hallelujah Jesus is alive  
Hes alive Hes alive  
Hes alive Hes alive  
Yes Hes alive
