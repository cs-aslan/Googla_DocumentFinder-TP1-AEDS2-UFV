Hey Im a fish out of water  
A lamb to the slaughter  
A moth to the flame  
Hey Im just a bird on a wire  
Just a coal in the fire  
Just a face and a name  
  
Hey I go chasing thunder  
Go dancing under  
Go falling free  
Hey I go running in circles  
Like baby turtles  
Down to the sea  
Down to the sea  
  
Hey Im just rust to a handle  
Im breeze to a candle  
Im a choice you cant choose  
Hey Im just a little bit later  
Im yesterdays paper  
Im yesterdays news  
  
Hey I go chasing thunder  
Go dancing under  
Go falling free  
Hey I go running in circles  
Like baby turtles  
Down to the sea  
Down to the sea  
  
Morning sun keep on shining  
Trees theyre climbing  
Tall and free  
Searching but never finding  
Rivers winding to the sea
