Communications never been  
As easy as today  
And it would make me happy  
When youve gone so far away  
If youd send me an email  
That says I love you  
Send me an email  
That says I love you  
  
Now time and distance  
Melt away  
No digital delay  
And some things  
Can be written down  
That were too shy to say  
Send me an email  
That says I love you  
Send me an email  
That says I love you  
  
There may be other  
Temptations in your life  
Dont want to add more  
Complications to your life  
But Im sending this email  
To say I love you  
  
Now theres a ghost  
Within this house  
Youre haunting me tonight  
Im looking at some photographs  
And thinking that I might  
Jump on a plane  
And surprise you where  
You are  
But do you want me there  
Im so insecure  
But one thing would make me sure  
If youd  
Send me an email  
That says I love you  
Send me an email  
That says I love You
