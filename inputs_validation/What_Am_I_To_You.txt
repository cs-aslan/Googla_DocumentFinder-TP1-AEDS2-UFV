What am I to you  
Tell me darlin true  
To me you are the sea  
Vast as you can be  
And deep the shade of blue  
  
When youre feelin low  
To whom else do you go  
Id cry if you hurt  
Id give you my last shirt  
Because I love you so  
  
Now if my sky should fall  
Would you even call  
Ive opened up my heart  
I never want to part  
Im givin you the ball  
  
When I look in your eyes  
I can feel the butterflies  
Ill love you when youre blue  
But tell me darlin true  
What am I to you  
  
If my sky should fall  
would you even call  
Ive opened up my heart  
I never want to part  
Im givin you the ball  
  
When I look in your eyes  
I can feel the butterflies  
Could you find a love in me  
Would you carve me in a tree  
Dont fill my heart with lies  
I will love you when youre blue  
But tell me darlin true  
What am I to you
