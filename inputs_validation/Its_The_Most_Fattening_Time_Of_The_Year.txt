Its the most fattening time of the year  
With that pumpkin pie filling  
And everyone swilling down eggnog and beer  
Its the most fattening time of the year  
  
Its the lip smackingest season of all  
While your shopping youre cheating  
Impulsively eating that junk at the mall  
  
Its the heavheaviest season of all  
  
Therell be turkeys for basting  
And stuffing for tasting  
And giblets and gravy will flow  
Therell be cookies that mom baked  
And leftover fruit cake from a Christmas a long time ago  
  
Its the scale flattening time of the year  
While your diet youre blowing  
Theres calories going straight down to your rear  
Its the scale flattening time of the year  
  
Therell be after meal dosing  
And arteries closing  
Cholesterol levels will grow  
Its too cold to go jogging  
To brisk for tobogganing  
So pass me a hot buttered roll  
  
Its the most fattening time of the year  
  
All those gingerbread shingles and  
Chocolate Chris Kringles will tremble in fear  
  
Its the most fattening time  
Its the belt loosening time  
Its the most fattening time of the year
