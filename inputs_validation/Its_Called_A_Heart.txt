Theres something beating here inside my body  
And its called a heart  
You know how easy it is to tear it apart  
If I lend it to you would you keep it safe for me  
Ill lend it to you will you treat it tenderly  
Theres something beating here inside my body  
And its called a heart  
Theres a sun shining in the sky  
But thats not the reason why Im feeling warm inside  
The answer isnt classified its my heart  
From the moment I started  
I tried to be good about it  
Yes Ive tried my best  
And more or less I spoke from my heart  
Theres a lot to be learned  
And you learn when your heart gets burned  
Theres something beating here inside my body  
And its called a heart  
You know how easy it is to tear it apart  
If I lend it to you would you keep it safe for me  
Ill lend it to you will you treat it tenderly  
Theres something beating here inside my body  
And its called a heart  
Hearts can never be owned  
Hearts only come on loan  
If I want it back  
I will take it back  
Ill take my heart  
But I will try my best  
And more or less  
I will speak from my heart  
Yes I will speak from my heart  
Speak from my heart  
Theres a lot to be learned  
And you learn when your heart gets burned  
Theres something beating here inside my body  
And its called a heart  
You know how easy it is to tear it apart  
If I lend it to you would you keep it safe for me  
Ill lend it to you will you treat it tenderly  
Theres something beating here inside my body  
And its called a heart
