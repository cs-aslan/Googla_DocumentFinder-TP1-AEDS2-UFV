Im heavy hearted heavy headed misunderstand it  
Try the permanent repercussions I empty the cannon  
Im addicted to ganja roll it up in a wood  
Drink a gallon of heaty throw it up with the hood  
Im a rhyme for my people give my people a voice  
Never follow the leader use the weapon of choice  
This is not an illusion this is not a mirage  
Conversation with God spilling my soul out  
I own assault weapons that fall down like Megatron  
The iron mob try better bombs Im better alone  
So tag along like a dog with a bag of bones  
Smoke to the sack of gold nigga on a grind  
Put my motherfucker records on  
So they can relate to the hate and the pain  
To the struggle and strain  
Never take it in vain bring the one and the same  
Press and push your forehead at the back of your brain  
So now  
  
Chorus  
Lets spread it out nigga  
Yeah yeah  
Spread it out spread it out spread it out  
It go oooo oooo  
And you cant get none you dont want none  
You cant get none  
Spread the fuck out gets these hot ones  
  
I try not to get involved with the nonsense  
Im from the time where you couldnt pause comments  
Couldnt hide behind a computer  
Catch a fatal get shot by a shooter  
A barracuda for Buddha  
I maneuver to the manure ignore the allure the illusion  
My bad sorry for all the confusion  
If you thought I was finished if you thought I was done  
The saga continue bring it back on the one  
Im coming back with a gun cause I saw that I know  
Meditated intentions my shit ready to go  
Never taking a smoke in my profession you need aggression  
A weapon you can brand the shit to your own discretion  
And I hear just a sandwich nigga whats your preference  
I chose bad and now Im headed in a right direction  
Theyre sick of the decisions now my family is good  
Make you well understood put you back where you should be  
  
Chorus  
  
This go for all my people people who see were equal  
I feel they come it is dark I protect us from evil  
We misheard an illusion car can make a confusion  
People constantly losing we suffer everywhere  
Enough with all this swagger partys a baggy bagger  
We hear a session is starting let me show you whats heading at  
Moneys so fucking tight the root to all them fights  
She make you wanna not ever not ever come home at night  
But she know that you go off with that stripping ho  
While your woman is wondering where does all your money go  
You try to make it rain maybe lock you a chain  
Maybe inducing brain from bitches everywhere  
Pussy nigga you lame get on top of your game  
Feed your family man this is simple and plain  
Children retain remember living upon the pain  
Thats when they curse your name they will see you do the same  
Yeah so spread it out nigga  
  
Chorus
