Feel your breath on my shoulder  
And I know we couldnt get any closer  
I dont wanna act tough I just wanna fall in love  
As we move into the night I get crazy  
Thinking how its gonna be with you baby  
I dont wanna play rough Ive been loving you enough  
Oh baby  
chorus I wanna take forever tonight  
Wanna stay in this moment forever  
Im gonna give you all the love that Ive got  
I wanna take forever tonight  
Fill you up fill you up with love  
When we close the door all I need is in your eyes  
I wanna take forever tonight  
Touch my lips Im on fire  
Youre the only one Ill ever desire  
Turn the lights down low make the world go slow  
When Im holding you tonight its so easy  
Nothing moves me like you do when you tease me  
And to rush would be a crime  
I just wanna spend some time with you baby  
Chorus  
And when Im here beside you  
I wanna see what drives you out of your mind  
I never wanna leave I only wanna be with you  
cause I love how you feel your love is so real  
I wanna take forever tonight  
Wanna stay in this moment forever  
Im gonna give you all the love that Ive got  
I wanna take forever tonight  
Wanna stay in this moment forever  
Im gonna give you all the love that Ive got  
cause I cant live without you
