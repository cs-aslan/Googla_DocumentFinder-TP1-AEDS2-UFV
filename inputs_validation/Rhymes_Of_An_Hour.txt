Cannot hear what your saying  
Could I tell you so  
And I cant believe my troubles  
And Im going home  
  
Lie and sleep  
Under deep  
You know  
  
While the cold winter waitin  
While its turning cold  
All these things we were searchin  
Now we just dont know  
  
Lie and sleep  
Under deep  
I think you know  
  
For the rhymes of an hour  
Now Im going home  
And I cant believe Im nothing  
Cause Im coming down  
  
Lie and sleep  
Under deep  
Do you know
