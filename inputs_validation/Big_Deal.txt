Well he used to be mine  
Not so very long ago  
I was crazy to ever let him get away  
But girl you should know better  
Then to go braggin in my face  
So forgive me for what Im bout to say  
  
Big deal  
So what Who cares  
Ya just got lucky thats all it was  
Shut up  
Dont want a hear another word about  
Candlelight and long stem roses  
And how youre fallin head over heels  
In love so what  
Big deal  
  
Hes perfect I heard ya  
The first ten times that ya told me  
Yeah yeah its amazin his lovin  
I cant believe I let him go  
I regret it there I said it  
Ya call yourself a friend  
But ya just keep rubbin it in  
  
Big deal  
So what Who cares  
Ya just got lucky thats all it was  
I swear if I hear another word about  
Candlelight or long stem roses  
And how youre fallin head over heels  
In love so what  
Big deal

Candlelight and long stem roses  
And how youre fallin head over heels
