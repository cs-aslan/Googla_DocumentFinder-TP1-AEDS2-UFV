Remember back in the days when niggaz had waves  
Gazelle shades and corn braids  
Pitchin pennies honies had the high top jellies  
Shootin skelly motherfuckers was all friendly  
Loungin at the barbeques drinkin brews  
With the neighborhood crews hangin on the avenues  
Turn your pagers to nineteen ninety three  
Niggaz is gettin smoked g believe me  
Talk slick you get your neck slit quick  
Cause real street niggaz aint havin that shit  
Totin techs for rep smokin blunts in the project  
Hallways shootin dice all day  
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit  
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit  
So step away with your fist fight ways  
Motherfucker this aint back in the days but you dont hear me though  
  
No more cocoa leaveio one two three  
One two three all of this to me is a mystery  
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it  
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it  
And Im down with the shit too  
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use kungfu  
Instead of a mac10 he tried scrappin  
Slugs in his back and thats what the fucks happenin  
When you sleep on the street  
Little motherfuckers with heat want ta leave a nigga six feet deep  
And we comin to the wake  
To make sure the cryin and commotion aint a motherfuckin fake  
Back in the days our parents used to take care of us  
Look at em now they even fuckin scared of us  
Callin the city for help because they cant maintain  
Damn shit done changed  
  
If I wasnt in the rap game  
Id probably have a key knee deep in the crack game  
Because the streets is a short stop  
Either youre slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot  
Shit its hard being young from the slums  
Eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from  
And now the shits gettin crazier and major  
Kids younger than me they got the sky grand pagers  
Goin outta town blowin up  
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up  
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie  
But I gotta go identify the body  
Damn what happened to the summertime cookouts  
Everytime I turn around a nigga gettin took out  
Shit my momma got cancer in her breast  
Dont ask me why Im motherfuckin stressed things done changed
