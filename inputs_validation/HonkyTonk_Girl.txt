Dont be fool by big blue eyes by a smile or a golden curl  
Cause shell love you now and then break every vow cause shes just a honky
tonk girl  
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun  
She thinks every mans a fool and youre another one  
She knows all the arts of love shell give your heart a twirl  
Cause shes just a honky tonk girl  
  
She can never change your ways though youll give her all the world  
Shes had more than one or two and each day theres someone new  
Cause shes just a honky tonk girl  
Breaking hearts to her
