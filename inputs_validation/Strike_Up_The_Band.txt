Living off the friends we made  
Never ever getting paid  
Kicking ass and paying dues  
Lose our mind in self abuse  
  
Loving ladies by the score  
Waking up and wanting more  
I hope my Mama understands  
When I strike up the band  
  
Well I spit out my anger as the sweat do fly  
Fifteen years of paying dues just to get me by  
Now the barkeeps would pay us by the crowds we bring  
But those sonofbitches never paid us one damn thing  
And my poor Daddy he just dont understand  
Its balls out tonight watch the shit hit the fan  
When we strike up the band  
  
Now those drop dead ladies line the very first row  
I do believe Id like to spend some time after the show  
Now them years gone by the barkeeps pay in cash  
And them lovely ladies feed me an earful of trash  
  
And my old lady she just dont understand  
Why those floozies got their hands on her man  
And my poor Daddy he still dont understand  
Why its balls out tonight watch the shit hit the fan  
Give it all that we can we dont give a good damn  
When we strike up the band  
  
Living like a gypsy  
an air conditioned hippie  
Whos never seen the light of day  
Rode dog and cowboy  
Dont know how boy  
I ever lived this long this way no no said  
  
And my poor Daddy he still dont understand  
Why its balls out tonight watch the shit hit the fan  
Give it all that we can we dont give a good damn  
When we strike up the band
