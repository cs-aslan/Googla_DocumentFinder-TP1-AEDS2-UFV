Take a message to my love  
And dont say where you saw me  
Seven men crossed the river  
And they took all the money  
  
Color the wind  
And search deep within  
And by the light of the moon  
Light of the moon  
Light of the moon  
Well begin again  
  
Secrets whispered in shadows  
While the village lay sleeping  
Guiding me to the answer  
Bang a drum and Ill follow  
  
Color the wind  
And search deep within  
And by the light of the moon  
Light of the moon  
Light of the moon  
Well begin again  
  
Say theyre taking the children  
Oh I think theyve forgotten  
Does their innocence wander  
On its way back to my love  
  
Color the wind  
And search deep within  
And by the light of the moon  
Light of the moon  
Light of the moon  
Well begin again
