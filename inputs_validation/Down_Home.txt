Chicago Green she was the ice cube queen of blue  
  
She got a tip from Aunt Mary saidsomebody was  
In love with you  
  
  
She was so nieve famous for her childlike mind  
  
I dont believe she ever opened her bedroom venetian blinds  
  
  
Already Eddie was unsteady on the levee  
Down Home  
  
  
Down Home  
  
Little Willy was Chicagos boyfriend a local screw  
  
  
He done kicking trippy hippies in the head with his  
  
  
Hobnail shoes  
Already Eddie pitching for pennies rockin for bennies  
  
Wound up in the local hole without a radio  
  
And he wrote Aunt Mary said Momma its getting hairyDown Home  
  
  
  
Well it was late in the morning when Chicago bailed  
Eddie on out  
  
  
Which tripped out Willie oh man you shouldve heard  
  
Him shout  
  
  
Their way home  
  
Yeah they wandered off somewhere they couldnt find  
  
Any road home  
You know Id really like to take her but you know I  
  
Couldnt make her  
Down Home  
  
  
Down Home get it in now  
  
Down Home in the morning
