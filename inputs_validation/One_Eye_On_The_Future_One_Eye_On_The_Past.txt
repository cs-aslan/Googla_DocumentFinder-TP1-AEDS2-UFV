Well raise our toast to pleasures past  
They came so quick and went so fast  
Idle boasts crazy ghosts  
Well make our toast and drain the glass  
Were know were out of favour  
We cant expect no saviour  
Were looking to the future but we keep one eye on the past  
  
Well time may heal and absence mend  
Well raise our glass to absent friends  
ere they dwell we wish them well  
To those we wronged well make amends  
Were know were out of favour  
We cant expect no saviour  
Were looking to the future but we keep one eye on the past  
  
Its time to change and start anew  
To leave our home for pastures new  
Where we go ah we wont know  
Its something that we got to do  
Were dont expect no favour  
We cant expect no saviour  
Were looking to the future but well keep one eye on the past
