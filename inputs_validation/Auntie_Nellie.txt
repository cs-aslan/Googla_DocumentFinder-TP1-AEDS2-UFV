Sitting here with Auntie Nelly she is so alone  
Talking idly shes in no hurry I wish I could go  
But how could I just say Goodbye theres noone who she knows  
  
No I cant leave my Auntie Nellie no  
No I cant leave my Auntie Nellie no  
  
Shes getting old and weary oh its such a shame  
Cause shes been good to everyone but now they dont know her name  
  
No I cant leave my Auntie Nellie no  
No I cant leave my Auntie Nellie no  
  
Sitting here with Auntie Nelly she is so alone  
Talking idly shes in no hurry I wish I could go  
But how could I just say Goodbye theres noone who she knows  
  
No I cant leave my Auntie Nellie no  
Shes so alone shed die if I should go  
No I cant leave my Auntie Nellie no  
Shes so alone
