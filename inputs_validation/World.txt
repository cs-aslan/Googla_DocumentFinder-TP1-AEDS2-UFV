I turn sideways to the sun  
Keep my thoughts from everyone  
Its a jungle Im a freak  
Hear me talk but never speak  
  
So Im stepping out of time  
Because breaking is a crime  
And it may all be too late  
But Ive no passion for this hate  
  
Thats the price of love thats the price of love  
Can you feel it can you feel it  
If we could buy it now thats the price of love  
How long would it last thats the price of love  
  
And when this building is on fire  
These flames cant burn any higher  
I turn sideways to the sun  
And in a moment I am gone  
  
Thats the price of love thats the price of love  
Can you feel it can you feel it  
If we could buy it now thats the price of love  
How long would it last thats the price of love  
  
Thats the price of love thats the price of love  
Can you feel it can you feel it  
If we could buy it now thats the price of love  
How long would it last thats the price of love
