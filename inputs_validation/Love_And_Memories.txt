Lovely youre always lovely  
A vision you were the one  
Now I am stuck inside a memory  
You forgot about our destiny  
You buried me didnt you  
  
Didnt you love me faster than the devil  
Run me straight into the ground  
Drownin deep inside your water  
Drownin deep inside your sound  
  
Youre always floating  
A vapor that I couldnt see  
Here I am stuck inside a yesterday  
Everything has given way  
You fell from me didnt you  
  
Didnt you love me faster than the devil  
Run me straight into the ground  
Drownin deep inside your water  
Drownin deep inside your sound  
  
Love me faster than the devil  
Run me straight into the ground  
Drownin deep inside your water  
Drown in love and memories  
  
Maybe I am a crowded mind  
I watch your eyes glaze over  
Stare down at the floor  
You were amazing to me  
I was amazing to you  
But here we go again  
  
Didnt you love me faster than the devil  
Run me straight into the ground  
Drownin deep inside your water  
Drownin deep inside your sound  
  
Love me faster than the devil  
Run me straight into the ground  
Drownin deep inside your water  
Drownin deep inside your sound  
  
Love me faster than the devil  
Run me straight into the ground  
Drownin deep inside your water  
Drown in love and memories
