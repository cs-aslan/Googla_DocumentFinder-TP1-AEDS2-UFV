Youre so quiet  
But it doesnt faze me  
Youre on time  
You move so fast makes me feel lazy  
Lets join forces  
Weve got our guns and horses  
I know youve been burned  
But every fire is a lesson learned  
  
I left my house  
Left my clothes  
Door wide open heaven knows  
Youre so worth it  
You are  
  
But I wish I could feel it all for you  
I wish I could be it all for you  
If I could erase the pain  
Then maybe youd feel the same  
Id do it all for you I would  
I would I would I would  
  
Lets type words  
Cause they amount to nothing  
Play it down  
Pretend you cant take what you found  
But you found me  
On a screen you sit at permanently  
  
I left my house  
Left my clothes  
Door wide open  
Heaven knows  
Youre so worth it you are  
  
But I wish I could feel it all for you  
I wish I could be it all for you  
If I could erase the pain  
Then maybe youd feel the same  
Id do it all for you I would  
I would I would I would  
  
Its time to come clean  
And make sense of everything  
Its time that we found out who we are  
Cause when Im standing here in the dark  
I see your face in every star  
  
But I wish I could feel it all for you  
I wish I could be it all for you  
If I could erase the pain  
The maybe youd feel the same  
Id do it all for you I would  
I would I would I would  
  
Id do it all for you  
Id do it all for you  
Id do it all for you  
Id do it all for you  
Id do it all for you  
Id do it all for you  
Id do it all for you  
Id do it all for you
