See the stars come fallin down from the sky  
Gently passing they kiss your tear drops dry  
See the wind come softly blow  
Your hair from your face  
And the rain comes falling down  
In its crazy way  
Still Im sad  
  
For myself my tears just fall in the dust  
As I search in the night and find theyre lost  
See the wind come gently blow  
Time into my heart  
And the rain comes falling down  
While were apart  
Still Im sad
