My old man is a bad man  
But I cant deny the way he holds my hand  
And he grabs me he has me by my heart  
He doesnt mind I have a Las Vegas past  
He doesnt mind I have a LA crass way about me  
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart  
  
Swimming pool  
Glimmering darling  
White bikini off with my red nail polish  
Watch me in the swimming pool  
Bright blue ripples you  
Sitting sipping on your black crystal oh yeah  
  
Light of my life fire in my loins  
Be a good baby do what I want  
Light of my life fire in my loins  
Gimme them gold coins  
Gimme them coins  
  
And Im off to the races races  
Up Bacardi chases  
Chasing me all over town  
Cause he knows Im wasted  
Facing time again at Rikers Island  
And I wont get out  
  
Because Im crazy baby  
I need you to come here and save me  
Im your little scarlet starlet  
Singing in the garden  
Kiss me on my open mouth  
Ready for you  
  
My old man is a tough man  
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam  
And he shows me he knows me every inch of my tar black soul  
He doesnt mind I have a flat broke down life  
In fact he says he thinks its what he might like about me admires me  
The way I roll like a rolling stone  
  
Likes to watch me in the glass room bathroom  
Chateau Marmont  
Slipping on my red dress putting on my make up  
Glass film perfume cognac lilac  
Fume says it feels like heaven to him  
  
Light of his life fire of his loins  
Keep me forever tell me you want me  
Light of your life fire of your loins  
Tell me you want me gimme them coins  
  
And Im off to the races races  
Up Bacardi chases  
Chasing me all over town  
  
Cause he knows im wasted facing  
Time again at Rikers  
Island and I wont get out  
  
Because Im crazy baby  
I need you to come here and save me  
Im your little scarlet starlet  
Singing in the garden  
Kiss me on my open mouth  
  
Now Im off to the races laces  
Leather on my waist is  
Tight and I am falling down  
I can see your faces shameless  
Ciprianis basement  
Love you but Im going down  
  
God Im so crazy baby  
Im sorry that Im misbehaving  
Im your little harlet starlet  
Queen of Coney Island  
Raising hell all over town  
Sorry bout it  
  
My old man is a thief and  
Im gonna stay and pray with him till the end  
But I trust in the decision of the law  
To watch over us  
Take him when he may if he may  
Im not afraid to say  
That Id die without him  
Who else is gonna put up with me this way  
I need you I breathe you Ill never leave you  
They would rue the day I was alone without you  
  
Youre lying with your gold chain on  
Cigar of hanging from your lips  
I said hon you never looked so beautiful  
As you do now my man  
  
And were off to the races places  
Ready set the gate is down  
And then were going in  
To Las Vegas pay us  
Cause you know well race this  
Honey it is time to spit  
Boy youre so crazy baby  
I love you forever  
Not maybe  
You are my one true love  
You are my one true love  
  
You are my one true love
