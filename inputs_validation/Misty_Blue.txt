Oh its been such a long long time  
Looks like I kept you off my mind  
But I cant  
Just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue  
  
Just the mention of your name  
Turns a flicker to a flame  
I think of things we used to do  
Then my whole world turns misty blue  
  
I should forget you  
Heaven knows Ive tried  
But when I say Im glad were through  
My heart knows that Ive lied  
  
Oh its been such a long long time  
Looks like I kept you off my mind  
But I cant  
Just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue  
  
I should forget you  
Heaven knows Ive tried  
But when I say Im glad were through  
My heart knows that Ive lied  
  
Oh its been such a long long time  
Looks like I kept you off my mind  
But I cant  
Just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue  
  
Oh but I cant  
Just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue
