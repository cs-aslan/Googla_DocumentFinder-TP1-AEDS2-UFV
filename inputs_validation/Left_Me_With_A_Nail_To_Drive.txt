Well its the same old story  
Another mobile home broken up  
Well Im eatin off of a paper plate  
Drinkin from a paper cup  
  
Chorus  
She caught me with another woman  
I guess Im lucky to be alive  
Well she stole my car  
And left me a nail to drive  
  
Chorus  
  
She caught me with another woman  
I guess Im lucky to be alive  
Well she stole my car  
And left me a nail to drive  
Yeah she stole my car  
And left me a nail to drive
