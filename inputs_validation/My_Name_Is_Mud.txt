My name is Mud  
Not to be confused with Bill or Jack or Pete or Dennis  
My name is mud and its always been  
Cause Im the most boring sonsabitch youve ever seen  
  
I dress in blueyes navy blue  
From head to toe Im rather drab except my patent shoes  
I make em shine well most the time  
Cept today my feet are troddin on by this friend of mine  
  
Six foort two and rude as hell  
I got to get him in the ground before he starts to smell  
  
My name is Mud  
  
My name is Mud  
But call me Alowishus Devadander Abercrombie  
Thats long for Mud so Ive been told  
Told that by this sonsabitch that lies before me bloated blue and cold  
  
Ive got my pride I drink my wine  
Id drink the finest except I havent earned a dime in several months  
Or were it years  
The breath on that fat bastard could bring any man to tears  
  
We had our words a common spat  
So I kissed him upside the cranium with an aluminum baseball bat  
  
My name is Mud
