Its only small town talk  
You know how people are  
They cant stand to see you  
Being who you are  
  
Its only small town talk  
Dont pay it no mind  
Dont believe a word they say  
They do it to you every time  
  
You cant believe everything you hear  
Only half of what you might see  
But if you have to believe in anyone  
Id believe darling believe in me  
  
Its only small town talk  
A wellknown fact  
You dont even know  
How one other might react  
To what youre thinking  
What are they thinking  
  
Its only small town talk  
Theyre telling all the lies  
And make some people crazy  
They dont realize were still thinking  
  
Were only people trying to live together  
Were trying to make this little life work  
Who are we to judge one another  
It may lead to tears or maybe something even worse  
  
Its only small town talk  
You know how people are  
They cant stand to see you  
Being just exactly who you are  
  
Its small town talk  
Pittle pattle its small town talk  
Tittle tattle its small town talk
