Whoa here it comes  
That funny feelin again windin  
Me up inside  
Every time we touch  
Hey I dont know  
Oh tell me where to begin  
Cause I never ever  
Felt so much Hey  
  
And I cant recall any love at all  
Oh baby this blows em all away  
  
Its got what it takes  
So tell me why cant this be love  
Straight from the heart  
Oh tell me why  
Cant this be love  
  
I tell myself  
Hey Only fools rush in  
Only time will tell  
If we stand the test of time  
All I know  
Youve got to run to win and  
Ill be damned if  
Ill get hung up on the line Hey  
  
No I cant recall anything at all  
Oh baby this blows em all away  
  
Woo Its got what it takes  
So tell me why cant this be love  
You want it straight from the heart  
Oh tell me why  
Cant this be love  
  
Woo Its got what it takes  
So tell me why cant this be love  
Straight from the heart  
Oh tell me why  
Cant this be love  
  
Baby why cant this be love  
Got to know why cant this be love
