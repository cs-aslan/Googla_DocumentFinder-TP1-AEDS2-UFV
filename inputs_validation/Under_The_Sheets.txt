Like all the boys before  
Like all the boys boys boys boys  
Like all the boys before  
Like all the boys boys boys boys  
  
You left a blood stain on the floor  
You set your sights on him  
You left a hand print on the door  
Like all the boys before like all the boys before  
  
This is our luck baby running out  
Our clothes were never off  
We still have our roads to run about  
To scale the map scale the map to get us back on track  
Ive seen you in a fight you lost  
Ive seen you in a fight  
  
Were under the sheets and youre killing me  
In our house made of paper your words all over me  
Were under the sheets and youre killing me  
  
Like all the boys before  
Like all the boys boys boys boys  
Like all the boys before  
Like all the boys boys boys boys  
  
In here the world wont bring us down  
Our plan is gold dust  
Out there a lonely girl could drown  
In here were frozen  
  
Where did the people go  
My hands are empty  
Youre not the answer I should know  
Like all the boys before like all the boys before  
  
Were under the sheets and youre killing me  
In our house made of paper your words all over me  
Were under the sheets and youre killing me  
  
Were in a mess baby were in a mess babe  
Your more is less babe oh  
Were in a mess baby were in a mess babe  
Your more is less babe oh oh  
  
Were under the sheets and youre killing me  
In our house made of paper and your words all over me  
Were under the sheets and youre killing me  
Ive seen you in a fight you lost  
Like all the boys before like all the boys before  
  
Were under the sheets and youre killing me  
In our house made of paper your words all over me  
Were under the sheets and youre killing me  
  
Were under the sheets and youre killing me  
In our house made of paper your words all over me  
Were under the sheets and youre killing me  
Killing killing killing me  
Killing killing killing me
