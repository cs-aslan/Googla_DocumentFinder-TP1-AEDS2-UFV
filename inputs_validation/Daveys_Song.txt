Im the kinda guy who cant stand the holiday  
So I drink em all away thats me  
I dont decorate no trees  
And I wont eat no potato laces  
But Ill give this old ladys melons a squeeze  
Thats just who I am  
  
Well Ill never spin a dreidle  
But Ill always throw an egg  
And Ill charlie horse your leg for laughs  
While youre singin your holiday tune  
Im actin like a town buffoon  
With an out my big white scary moon  
And blowin out beef your way  
  
I hate folks who think reindeer are cute  
To me theyre just somethin to shoot  
I hate love  
I hate you  
I hate me  
  
Well Im a snowmobile stealin no tears the season feelin kind of guy  
This time of year sucks  
So I take my nunchucks  
And make sure every snowman dies  
  
Believing in Santas all wrong  
And Hanukkahs eight nights too long  
I hate love  
I hate you  
I hate me  
  
I hate love  
I hate you  
I hate me
