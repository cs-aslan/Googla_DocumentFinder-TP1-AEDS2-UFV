Before you say its cheaper to keep her  
We consider and read her  
Man she might be the type that want P to feed her  
She wants a little cheaper a little margarita  
Mane them draws comin off when she see the twoseater  
So put your Porche up uh  
Get your divorce up uh  
Im sure shell sign it when she seen me put my doors up  
Mane them niggas only wanna motherfucker here  
She threw her heels in the ocean so she stuck to chill  
The trunk is still hopin theres something between ya  
Now she laughin how she took your ass to the cleaners  
Mane Im on your side not tryna inconvient  
Just know we got them mean keys in them plastic meaners  
So keep it player dawg  
Dont make me say it naw  
Do something drastic know that plastic heavy weighing dawg  
If it aint music or this money I dont play at all  
And she aint either so that means she doesnt weight at all  
  
Chorus  
Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane  
And we can both pull a misses keep it playa mane  
Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane  
Or you can scram cocksuck if you a hater mane  
I keep em ladies going uhuhuh  
Uhuhuh haa uhuhuh yea uhuhuh  
  
Im a grown mane Thug aint the one to play no games with ya  
Thug the one to call and come get out the chain with ya  
And hang with ya when ya full of Patrone  
And oh yeah brang one of ya cute partnas along  
Because Im only 25 and still going live  
I got the estate by the pool by the lake outside  
I wake up and gotta pick which car Ima drive  
The Doubble are 760 or the 645 Im  
Havin thangs mane check out the chain  
Money aint never been a thang  
You see watch and the rang the watch and the rang  
Rocks the nicest never seen nuthin like this  
Ima Boss I on ask what it cost my life priceless  
Baby girl you might just  
Get the shatter shine  
Long as you not selfish or learn to share sometimes  
And of course Im still youres and youre still mine  
But you cant be a hater mane  
You gotta keep it playa mane  
  
Chorus  
  
They say JLo shouldnt show her ass and all  
Knowin the worst thing could happen is a nigga could palm  
Now my angent sayin the only way that he could be calm  
I put a hundred mil on each song like my name was LaBron wha  
Not the ice my beat is worth more  
Attractive like a whole damn Jacob store  
See niggas hate you more when you take they broad  
But his girl looked in my ear and seen her matrix door  
Dudes is foolish they hues us to chew us  
I mean the smirfs the green the rocks is so bluish  
You cant out bling me or BBC jean me  
You aint got no vibe you can go and ask MiMi  
I think and relay it  
I blink and PJ it  
You wanna make fast bucks take this and Ebay it  
And all you Phantom owners know why you cant stand me  
Got one in Virigina nother one in Miami  
  
Chorus
