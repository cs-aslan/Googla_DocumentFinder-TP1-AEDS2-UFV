That girl will never be mine  
First time  
I saw her at the front door  
That girl  
Her face on every billboard  
Hands down  
You wont believe the way she laid her eyes on me  
Six feet  
What was I thought I got Id get for  
So fly  
We got into a small talk  
Too bad  
She had to move along  
One smile and she was gone  
  
Cant explain  
I never thought that I was gonna loose my head  
Call me insane  
Theres got to be a way  
  
How can I get next to her  
Now tell me how its gonna be done  
Will I win or lose this one  
Dont care about the fact  
Shes in a different league  
They say its no use that I try  
That girl will never be mine  
  
Next thing  
Shes livin in my TV  
And that girl  
Is stealin every daydream  
Tough love  
She had to be the one for me  
When I just sing away  
Last night ran into a big thing  
Guess what  
She didnt want to see me  
They said I was outta line  
Whos wrong whos right this time  
  
Cant explain  
I never thought that I was gonna lose my head  
Call me insane  
Theres got to be a way  
  
How can I get next to her  
Now tell me how its gonna be done  
Will I win or lose this one  
Dont care about the fact  
Shes in a different league  
They say its no use that I try  
That girl will never be mine  
  
That girl  
Is freakin me out  
Dont care about the fact  
That shes all that  
That girl  
Is pullin out the down  
Theres no way for me to stop  
  
That girl  
Tearin up the big screen  
That girl  
Stealin every daydream  
Tough love  
She had to be the one for me  
She will be mine  
No matter what they try to say  
Theres got to be a way  
  
How can I get next to her  
Now tell me how its gonna be done  
Will I win or lose this one  
Dont care about the fact  
Shes in a different league  
They say its no use that I try  
They say its no use that I try  
That girl will never be mine
