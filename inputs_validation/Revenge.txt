Whatever happened to you  
Youve changed  
And Im still wrong        
I know you wanted to stay so long  
And Im still alone      
There were no secrets  
There were no stories  
There was no one around  
There were no reasons  
There was no questions  
There is no point now  
Whatever happened to you  
Youve changed  
And Im still        
I know you wanted to stay so long  
                  
So tell me your secret  
Did you want to see me pull my guns           
So tell me your secret  
There were no stories  
Nobody won  
Ill give you a reason  
And Ill wage a war           
With a punch from your face             
Ill stand my guard  
Ill give you a reason  
You might see it  
You might hate it  
You might never know your name         
  
So tell me a secret  
Tell me one more lie
