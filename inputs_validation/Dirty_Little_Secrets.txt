It seems I loved you for so long  
It seems like all of my life  
Just like a child who doesnt belong  
Youd turn til even the sun became your shadow  
And I hate you in your innocence you know  
But I hate myself even more for lovin you so  
  
Sometimes I believed what you had to say  
Then I watched you bleed all the truth away  
Somewhere in my heart theres a place I know  
Where all our dirty little secrets go  
  
Nobodys perfect certainly not us  
Weve all got secrets to keep  
I would have kept yours safe in my heart  
You would have always known where to find me  
And I know you better that I know myself you know  
So why pretend youve got somewhere else to go  
  
Sometimes I believed what you had to say  
Then I watched you bleed all the truth away  
Somewhere in my heart theres a place I know  
Where all our dirty little secrets go  
  
Sometimes it hurt so bad that you cry  
Then theres the times you wish you had died  
Sometimes the truth is worse than the lie sometimes  
Sometimes its best to lock it away  
In a place thats secret and safe  
Sometimes you just pretend you dont know  
Sometimes its best to let go  
  
Sometimes I believed what you had to say  
Then I watched you bleed all the truth away  
Somewhere in my heart theres a place I know  
Where all our dirty little secrets go
