Translation  
  
The fresh smell of spring rain that  
Rose from the sidewalk  
Street lamps and violins tales that they tell  
The stars that plunged into my sparkling glass  
I remember these things  
I remember them well  
  
But I cannot recall was it really your eyes  
That sparked off this thunder from heavens  
Above  
I know not if it was with you and to you  
That I walked in these streets that howl of love  
  
Spring it was  
Flowering buds impregnated with laughter  
An oath of blood and a wine is taken  
Sworn to be true  
And every strangers glance I got  
Of longing and of passion  
I believe with all my heart  
That it was you
