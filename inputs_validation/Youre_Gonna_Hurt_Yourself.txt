I love you just you its true baby its true  
But how much more do you need to be satisfied  
Than I can give the way you live baby can give  
You cheat all over a rover you are  
Makes me tell you oh  
  
Chorus  
You know youre gonna hurt yourself hey  
You know youre gonna hurt yourself  
When youre broke and worn out  
When your heart is torn out  
  
1 2 Dont 3 oh call me  
1 2 Dont call me  
I love you to coda  
  
It cant wait til its too late baby its true  
If you want my love take my love but dont go shoppin  
Round the town til you have found baby can give  
The guy you needed was me all along  
Baby baby oh  
  
Chorus

Girl yeah know youre gonna hurt yourself hey  
You know youre gonna hurt yourself  
Girl yeah know youre gonna hurt yourself hey
