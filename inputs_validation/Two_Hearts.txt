Theres a man drinkin whiskey in a barroom  
Hes nursin a broken heart  
Theres a woman at a table  
With her own brand of misery  
Cryin in the dark  
  
Chorus  
Will two hearts make on tonight  
Will somebody lost fond someone whos lost  
Will strangers info comfort  
In the cold neon light  
Will two hearts make one tonight  
  
Oh theres just a waitress between them  
Theyre so close to finding their dreams  
Theyre just one dance away  
From easing the pain  
Of coming apart at the seams  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Will two hears make one tonight
