Hey bus driver keep the change  
Bless your children give them names  
Dont trust men who walk with canes  
Drink this and youll grow wings on your feet  
Broadway Mary Joan Fontaine  
Advertiser on a downtown train  
Christmas crier bustin cane  
Hes in love again  
  
Where dock workers dreams mix with panthers schemes  
To someday own the rodeo  
Tainted women in VistaVision  
Perform for outofstate kids at the late show  
  
Wizard imps and sweat sock pimps  
Interstellar mongrel nymphs  
Rex said that lady left him limp  
Loves like that sure it is  
Queen of diamonds ace of spades  
Newly discovered lovers of the Everglades  
They take out a fullpage ad in the trades  
To announce their arrival  
And Mary Lou she found out how to cope  
She rides to heaven on a gyroscope  
The Daily News asks her for the dope  
She said Man the dopes that theres still hope  
  
Senorita Spanish rose  
Wipes her eyes and blows her nose  
Uptown in Harlem she throws a rose  
To some lucky young matador
