I hurt your feelings  
And you hurt mine girl  
But I still love you  
More than anything in this world  
You got me crying girl  
Im going blind girl  
Im going up down down up  
Losing weight by the pound  
Heres my love take it all girl  
Heres my heart take it all girl  
Heres my lips kiss them again  
And baby youll be feeling  
That mine will never be hurt again  
So lets get clever  
And get together  
And baby where you go I go you stay I stay  
Everything will be just great
