Chorus  
Crocodile on my feet  
Fox fur on my back  
Bowtie round my neck  
Thats why they call me the gangsta mack  
In the Cadillac Yeah  
  
Nasty Noompsy Knightingale  
Fresh in that tuxedo  
Cumberbun with no suspenders  
My torpedo you libido  
Need to chat Chip chop it up shoot the breeze  
Im your areolaIds release the squeeze or release the keys  
To the shackles on her wrist she can tackle some of this  
Smack on smack on some of this Dick Tracy  
Arrest her book her fingerprint your hooker  
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor  
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Baileys Irish Cream  
Shes a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things  
What ya mean Chip chop it up shoot the breeze  
In the parking lot we primp crooked booty to the scene where Is  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh lord How can it be so hard  
To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard  
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique  
You unique you best believe Im gon skeet once I speak  
Spoke spit spatter spat and I macked her just like that  
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat  
So why dont I chase this Hennessy down with some of that  
On your back like a cheerleader missing the final stack  
As we strut skip the line through the glass window glance  
We look fine right on time  
As we step in the place the nurserys crunk weve come to play  
  
Everybodys watching cause them furs just hit the door  
While the gators creeping crawling oh so wicked across that floor  
To the VIP where we proceed to give you what you need  
Throw your hands up if you feel me Throw your hands up if you feel me  
Cause we well designed and fine as wine  
Feel good to be fly so dont you ask me why  
I got the ladies in line because they cant deny  
So raise your hands to the sky cause we super fly  
  
Chorus
