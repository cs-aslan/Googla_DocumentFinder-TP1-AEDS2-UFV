To line up to the ring  
For a battle that you cant win  
Swing as hard as you can swing  
It will still mean nothing  
Shouldve seen it coming  
It had to happen sometime  
But you went and brought a knife  
To an all out gunfight  
  
And the only thing to save  
Is the banner that you wave  
To be wrapped around your grave  
  
Youve gone too far who do you think you are  
Is this what you came for well this means war  
  
Say anything you want  
But talk will get you nowhere  
The only thing you brought is psychological warfare  
Well theres no getting off  
And now you got to wonder  
Who will dig you out when youre six feet under  
  
And the only thing to save  
Is the banner that you wave  
To be wrapped around your grave  
  
Youve gone too far who do you think you are  
Is this what you came for well this means war  
  
And the only thing to save  
Is the banner that you wave  
To be wrapped around your grave  
  
Youve gone too far who do you think you are  
Is this what you came for well this means war  
This means war
