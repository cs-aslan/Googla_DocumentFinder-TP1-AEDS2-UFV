You ruin my day  
You ruin my night  
You ruin everything I do  
Youre killing in my way  
Youre killing in my life  
Youre killing in everything I do  
  
Youre hurting my heart  
Youre hurting my pride  
Youre hurting everything I own  
Youre choking my head  
Its choking inside  
Why dont you leave my life alone  
  
I just want to do it like it used to be  
So why dont you leave it up to me  
I want to tell you if you think its right  
Baby wont you do it right
