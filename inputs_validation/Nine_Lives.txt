Is your luck enough  
Is your touch enough  
Cmon girl  
Can you keep it up  
Is your bluff enough  
  
Are you tough enough  
Is your stuff enough  
Can you start it up  
Are you sharp enough  
Let it roll let em go let em fly  
Took a chance on a chance  
But the aces were high  
Get it on give it up give it in  
You stole the wages of sin  
Got to be in it to win  
  
Chorus  
Nine lives nine times to die  
Ive been bitten once  Tim McGraw  
But I wont be twice shy  Tim McGraw  
Nine lives nine times to die  
Come on and show me your hand  
Cause its your time to cry  
  
Have you lost your touch  
Are the stakes too much  
Did you spin the wheel  
And could you close a deal  
Yeah yeah  
Let it roll let em go give em style  
Took a chance on a chance  
But the deuces were wild  
Get it on give it up give it in  
You stole the wages of sin  
Cause youre in it to win  
  
Chorus  
Nine lives nine times to die  
Ive been bitten once  
But I wont be twice shy  
Nine lives nine times to die  
Come on and show me your hand  Tim McGraw  
Cause its your turn to cry  Tim McGraw  
  
Hey  
  
Let it roll let em go let em fly  
Took a chance on a chance  
But the aces were high  
Get it on give it up give it in  
You stole the wages of sin  
Got to be in it to win  
  
Chorus  
  
Nine lives nine times to die  
Ive been bitten once  
But I wont be shy twice  
Nine lives nine times to die  
Its Russian roulette  
With every roll of your dice  
  
And nine lives is all were gonna get  
I said all were gonna get yeah  
Nine lives nine times to die  
Youve just bitten less than your nine lives
