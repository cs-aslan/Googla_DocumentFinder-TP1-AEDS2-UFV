I cannot sleep at night  
Thats what the day is for anyway  
And as the clock strikes midnight  
I hear them dancing at the graves  
Singing to my mind  
Killing the pain    sleepless nights    sleepless nights  
I cannot sleep at night  
Thats what the day is for anyway  
And as the clock strikes midnight  
Only they can let us meet  
Even though shes dead now  
I gotta see her again    sleepless nights    sleepless nights  
I cannot sleep at night  
I will do anything to see missy again  
Then let us make you an eternal deal  
You will attend to the graves  
Youll give us the house back and keep in mind  
That we only come here at night  
So we made the deal under the starry night and  
Amon belongs to them now     
I feel the dawn coming my way  
And as the sun breaks up the dark  
I cant hear them dance no more  
Theres no voices  
Killing the pain    pain    pain
