Just one more moment thats all thats needed  
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing  
Time to be honest this time Im pleading  
Please dont dwell on it cause I didnt mean it  
  
I cant believe I said Id lay our love on the ground  
But it doesnt matter cause I made it up forgive me now  
Everyday I spend away my souls inside out  
Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now somehow  
  
Chorus  
By now you know that Id come for you  
No one but you yes Id come for you  
But only if you told me to  
And Id fight for you  
Id lie its true  
Give my life for you  
You know Id always come for you  
  
I was blindfolded but now Im seeing  
My mind was closing now Im believing  
I finally know just what it means to let someone in  
To see the side of me that no one does or ever will  
So if youre ever lost and find yourself all alone  
Id search forever just to bring you home  
Here and now this I vow  
  
Chorus  
  
You know Id always come for you  
  
No matter what gets in my way  
As long as theres still life in me  
No matter what remember  
You know Id always come for you  
  
Yes Id come for you no one but you  
Yes Id come for you but only if you told me to  
  
And Id fight for you  
Id lie its true  
Give my life for you  
You know Id always come for you  
  
No matter what gets in my way  
As long as theres still life in me  
No matter what remember you know Id always come for you  
Id crawl across this world for you  
Do anything you want me to  
No matter what remember you know Id always come for you  
You know Id always come for you
