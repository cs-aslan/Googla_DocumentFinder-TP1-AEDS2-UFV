Im so incredible wait  
Wit no metal to waist  
I flow great  
And thatll level ya face  
But Ill still let a nigga have it  
You talk greasy but you still a fagot  
I front on cowards cause you niggas backwards  
I got my money right  
Game on top  
And its been said that Im the key to put this game on lock  
Im from the city  
Of the triflin hoods  
But when you see me  
Gotta smile on my face  
Nothin sweet its just that life is good  
Yea I dodged the hood  
Slums came up out that  
Rap game about that  
To gain pay wit out crack  
See Imma youngin wit too much on my plate  
To let some small change have a youngin dumped in a cage  
I seen niggas make sells  
Niggas get knocked and make bail  
And take lives they worries aint jail  
Wit no regards for life cause they livin aint well  
Who gotta make it to heaven cause they livin in hell  
But me I dont do much just keep to myself  
And stop these cocksuckin mothafuckas seekin my wealth  
I was told the worlds cold but I see for my self  
And Im too hot to take the back seat or the shelf  
So Im here  
For sum reason though they hate it to death  
The loves gone only hatred is left  
Only achin and stress  
A king not be mistaken for less  
And this here is for the taking  
This is history in the making  
  
Where Im from its kinda hard to trust  
Cause the hates from most of your own people  
Theyre fake and theyre all see through  
Hate to see a nigga when hes stackin his bucks  
Rather him be down in the dumps  
And out on his luck  
But Ill be damned if my grind stop  
My mind tickin like the time watch  
And Im gon be spittin till the times not  
Presently there  
I touch minds everywhere  
And Ill ride hopin heaven is near  
See the pain in your eyes young wit every stare  
I seek peace but these streets will never be fair  
Cause somebody went and took Gregs life  
Son reached  
Deceased  
No time to blink or think twice damn  
Wonder when it gonna be my time  
To meet death  
Im stressed need to ease my mind  
And unless one of yall try to see whats mine  
Then Ill eat through your flesh bones and leave that spine  
U see I did the right thing  
I stayed up out the gun and knife game  
I knew about the pain it might bring  
And we all got problems  
I chose to smoke blunts just to drown em  
The top but I rose from the bottom  
And Im here now  
Aint no body harming young  
My screws loose they say somethings wrong wit young  
Ya times up Im just warning young  
Cause this heres for the taking  
This is history in the making
