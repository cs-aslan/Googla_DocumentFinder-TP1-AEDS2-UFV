Why cant you do it  
Why cant you set your monkey free  
Always giving into it  
Do you love your monkey or do you love me  
  
Why cant you do it  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey  
Monkey with a monkey monkey  
La la la  
  
Oh I count to ten  
But I dont know how  
And I dont know when  
To open my eyes  
  
Baby if you kiss me again  
Like you did just now  
Like you did just then  
Just Do it again  
  
Ive had the rest  
Now its time I had the best  
So you tell me  
That you wont do anymore  
  
Well Id write your heart a letter  
But I think you know me better  
If I keep on asking baby maybe  
Ill get what Im asking for  
  
Why cant you do it  
Why cant you set your monkey free  
Always giving in to it  
Do you love your monkey or do you love me  
  
Why cant you do it  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey  
Monkey with a monkey monkey  
La la la  
  
Oh I hate your friends  
But I dont know how and I dont know when  
To open your eyes  
Yes the monkeys back again  
Do you want him now like you did back then  
  
I tried my best but your head is such a mess  
So I guess that I dont want you anymore  
Well you say you care about me  
That you just cant do without me  
But you keep on dancin baby  
Til that monkey has you on the floor
