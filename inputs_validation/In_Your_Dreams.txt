Chorus  
We spent summer dreaming when we could be leaving  
I get wild and dont give a fuck see you when the sun come up  
I guess Ill get you in your dreams  
I guess Ill get you in your dreams  
I get wild and dont give a fuck see you when the sun come up  
I guess Ill get you in your dreams  
  
The moons around my sun and my nights around my days  
Nocturnal creature by habit Bruce Wayne know what I mean  
I mean Im in between sunset and sunrise  
As its on type of nigga for the home invasion surprise  
Mother fucker powpow lay the fuck down now  
Now no dont try to talk your way out  
Because Im usually non violent positively vibing  
But every now and then you got a nigga wanna try you  
Why I dont know I dont even understand it  
But its simply overstood how you really suppose to handle it  
Pardon me one moment I just went off on a tangent  
  
Chorus  
  
Typical day off in the A aye  
But nicks up the Chevrolet aye  
Nigga wanna rob okay okay  
Where he stand is where he lay aye  
Keep looking at me with a gangsta grill  
Im gonna give your ass a gangstas pill  
Thats a little piece of lead taken to the head  
That nigga aint live that nigga there dead  
Taken dirt naps sleeping with the fishes  
Done like dishes this a wrap like Christmas  
Big Boi you say the word Ill make these niggas dreams a nightmare  
I will bust there motherfucking head ha ha ha ha ha ha  
  
Chorus  
  
Your ridin killin feelin straight chillin  
I feel wild and dont give a fuck see you when the sun come up  
  
We roastin boastin flowin straight coastin  
I feel wild and dont give a fuck see you when the sun come up  
  
Thats the way a  
  
Keep spinnin we grillin bendin straight pimpin  
I feel wild and dont give a fuck see you when the sun come up yeah  
  
Now we know when know when holding holding showing controlling  
I feel wild and dont give a fuck see you when the sun come up oh  
  
Chorus  
  
I guess Ill get you in your dreams  
  
I guess Ill get you in your dreams
