Im working on gospel time these days  
The summer this could be the cool part of the summer  
  
The sloe eyed creature in the reckless room shes so severe  
A wise child walks right out of here  
  
Im so excited I can barely cope  
Im sizzling like an isotope  
Im on fire so cut me some slack  
  
First shes way gone then she comes back  
Shes all business then shes ready to play  
Shes almost gothic in a natural way  
  
This house of desire is built foursquare  
The city the cleanest kitten in the city  
  
When she speaks its like the slickest song I ever heard  
Im hanging on her every word  
As if Im not already blazed enough  
She hits me with the cryptic stuff  
Thats her style to jerk me around  
  
First shes all feel then she cools down  
Shes pure science with a splash of black cat  
Shes almost gothic and I like it like that  
  
This dark place so thrilling and new  
Its kind of like the opposite of an aerial view  
Unless Im totally wrong  
I hear her rap and brother its strong  
  
Im pretty sure that what shes telling me is mostly lies  
But I just stand there hypnotized  
  
Ill just have to make it work somehow  
Im in the amen corner now  
Its called love I spell L you V  
  
First shes all buzz then shes noisefree  
Shes bubbling over then theres nothing to say  
Shes almost gothic in a natural way  
  
Shes old school then shes like young  
Little Eva meets the Bleecker Street brat  
Shes almost gothic but its better than that
