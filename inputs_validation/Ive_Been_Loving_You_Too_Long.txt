Ive been loving you a little too long  
To stop right now  
Youre tired and you wanna be free  
My love is growing stronger  
As you become a habit to me  
Ooh and loving you a little too long  
I dont wanna stop right now  
Oh with you my life has been so wonderful  
I just cant stop now  
Youre tired and your love is growing cold  
My love is growing stronger  
As our affair grows old  
And Ive been loving you just a little too long  
I dont wanna stop now  
Ooh ooh and loving you  
Loving you a little too long  
Dont wanna stop now  
Ooh ooh too long long  
Dont wanna stop my loving you right now  
No oh Ive been loving you a little too long  
To stop right now  
Ooh ooh loving you a little too long  
To stop right now  
No oh I cant stop now no  
Loving you a little too long  
To stop right now
