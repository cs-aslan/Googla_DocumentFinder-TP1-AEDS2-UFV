He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants  
But it tears her apart cause nothings for her heart  
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight  
If he could only read her mind shed say  
  
Buy me a rose  
Call me from work  
Open a door for me what would it hurt  
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes  
These are the little things  
I need the most in my life  
  
Yeah  
  
Now the days have grown  
To years of feeling all alone  
As she sits and wonders if all shes doin is wrong  
Cos lately shed try anything just to turn his head  
Would it make a difference if shed say if shed say  
  
Buy me a rose  
Call me from work  
Open the door for me what would it hurt  
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes  
These are the little things  
I need the most in my life  
  
And the more that he lives  
The less that he tries  
To show her the love that he holds inside  
And the more that she gives  
The more that he sees  
This is the story of you  
And me  
  
So I bought you a rose  
On the way home from work  
To open the door to a heart that I hurt  
And I hoped you noticed this look in my eyes  
Cause im gonna make things right  
For the rest of your liferest of your life  
And Im gonna hold you tonight tonight  
Do all those little things  
For the rest of your life
