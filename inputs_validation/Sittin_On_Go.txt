Im waiting on the green light to make you mine  
But your hearts just taking its own sweet time  
You want to be sure if youll sink or swim  
Well grab ahold of me and just jump on in  
Youre playing it safe  
But baby Ill wait  
  
Chorus  
Oh whenever youre ready  
I could be yours in a second or so  
Oh baby come and get me  
My hearts sittin on go  
Ooh its off to the races  
All youve gotta do is let me know  
Oh Im ready and waiting  
My hearts sittin on go  
  
You oughta give in now instead of resisting  
Cause Im not above a little arm twisting  
Im bettin its only a matter of time  
Before you and me are standing at the finish line  
Youre having your doubts  
But youll come around  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre playing it safe  
But baby Ill wait  
  
Chorus  
  
My hearts sittin on go  
My hearts sittin on go
