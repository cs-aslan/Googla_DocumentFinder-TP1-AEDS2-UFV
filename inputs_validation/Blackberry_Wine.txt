Theres a south wind risin and  
The moon shines on my window sill  
Ive got a feeling I might walk on over the hill  
Im bent but not broken all I need is some rest  
And a bottle of your very best  
Blackberry wine  
  
Theres a new moon risin and  
The wind sings its old song  
Pass it on over its a sin to be sober too long  
Im bent but not broken all I need is my share  
Of a bottle of that very rare  
Blackberry wine  
  
My old gals got a new dress on five and dime  
Try as she will she cant get me  
To come home on time  
But Id never cheat her  
Or mistreat her you know  
As over the mountain I go  
Blackberry wine  
  
Ill be soft spoken  
All I need is my rest  
And a bottle of your very best  
Blackberry wine  
  
Now my days are numbered  
And one more heels been killed  
Blackberry John left me  
His old recipe in his will  
Im bent but not broken  
All I need is some time  
And a bottle of your very fine  
Blackberry wine  
  
Blackberry wine  
You know that Im quite dry without you  
Blackberry wine
