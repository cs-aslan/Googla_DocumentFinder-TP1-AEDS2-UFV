Ive been waiting for the sky to clear to get me  
Out of here  
Get me on my way and go  
Ive been waiting for a sign to appear  
To show me the way to a place Ive never known  
All I have are my dreams  
Your love and blind faith  
There in the sky spins a wheel its givin me  
The feelin that my dream  
Came true today  
  
Theres a place where we two can be together  
Once the clouds are gone well both move on in search of all weve dreamed  
Therell come a day  
Blue skies endless  
And forever  
Well that time has come  
Ive found the sun in you I live and breathe  
  
From the moment that I close my eyes feel the  
Sun it rise hear it echo through my soul  
For the first time in this young mans life makes  
Me feel alive  
Fills my heart and makes me stronger  
All I have are my dreams  
Your love and blind faith  
There in the sky spins a wheel its givin me the feelin that my dream came
true today  
  
Theres a place where we two can be together  
Once the clouds are gone well both move on in search of all weve dreamed  
Therell come a day  
Blue skies endless  
And forever  
Well that time has come  
Ive found the sun in you I live and breathe  
  
Someplace closer to both our hearts  
Somewhere further than where we are  
Just as long as theres hope enough  
Long as I live and breathe  
  
Theres a place where we two can be together  
Once the clouds are gone well both move on in search of all weve dreamed  
Therell come a day  
Blue skies endless  
And forever  
Well that time has come  
Ive found the sun in you I live and breathe  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
