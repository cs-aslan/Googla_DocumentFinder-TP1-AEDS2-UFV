The selfish theyre all standing in line  
Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time  
Me I figure as each breath goes by  
I only own my mind  
  
The North is to South what the clock is to time  
Theres east and theres west and theres everywhere lying  
I know I was born and I know that Ill die  
The in between is mine  
I am mine  
  
And the feeling it gets left behind  
All the innocence lost at one time  
Significant behind the eyes  
Theres no need to hide  
Were safe tonight  
  
The ocean is full cause everyones crying  
The full moon is looking for friends at high tide  
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrows denied  
I only know my mind  
I am mine  
  
And the meaning it gets left behind  
All the innocents lost at one time  
Significant behind the eyes  
Theres no need to hide  
Were safe tonight  
  
And the feelings that get left behind  
All the innocents broken with lies  
Significance between the lines  
We may need to hide  
  
And the meanings that get left behind  
All the innocents lost at one time  
Significance between the linesTheres no need to hide
