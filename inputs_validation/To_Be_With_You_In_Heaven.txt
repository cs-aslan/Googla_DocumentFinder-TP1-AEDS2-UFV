You can shoot me down  
You can drag me round  
Girl Ill get you  
It wont be long  
You can smash my heart  
You can trash our love  
But my desire for you is much too strong  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
Theres no cure for love that kills  
  
You can waste my time  
But you cant change my mind  
I wont stop you  
So just go on  
You can play your games  
But its all in vain  
Cause my desire for you is much too strong  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
Theres no cure for love that kills  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
Theres no cure for love that kills  
  
Girl Im on fire  
Heaven seems so close tonight  
Girl I would die for your love  
  
You can shoot me down  
You can drag me round  
Girl Ill get you  
It wont be long  
You can smash my heart  
You can trash our love  
But my desire for you is much too strong  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
Theres no cure for love that kills  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
Theres no cure for love that kills  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
Theres no cure for love that kills
