Chorus  
MoreI dont know how to  
MoreI die without you  
Moreand I would stop the world turning  
I stop the sun burning  
But I cant love you more  
  
Moreis there more than a lifetime  
Morecount the stars in the nighttime  
MoreIm already your slave love  
Thats what I gave love  
And I cant love you more  
  
Every breath that I take  
My first thought when I wake  
Every song I hear  
How I feel when youre near  
How I feel by your side  
How Im glad Im alive  
Whether winter or spring  
Doesnt mean anything  
How my homes anywhere  
Knowing that I know you care  
And how nothing I see  
Beyond you and me  
  
Chorus
