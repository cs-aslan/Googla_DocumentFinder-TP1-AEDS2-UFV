If I wait for just a second more  
I know Ill forget what I came here for  
My head was so full of things to say  
But as I open my lips all my words slip away  
And anyway  
I cant believe you want to turn the page  
And move your life onto another stage  
You can change the chapter you can change the book  
But the story remains the same if youd take a look  
  
Chorus  
For the times weve had I dont want to be a page in your diary babe  
For the good the bad I dont want to see a page in your diary babe  
For the happy the sad I dont want to be another page in your diary  
  
Perhaps if I held you I could win again  
I could take your hands wed talk and maybe then  
That look in your eyes I always recognize  
Would tell me everything is gonna be fine  
Youre gonna be mine  
For a long time  
  
Chorus
