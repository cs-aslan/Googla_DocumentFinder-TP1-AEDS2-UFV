Down low double life  
1 2 equals us she she and me I fell in loves  
How could something so right go so wrong  
Just coming in on flight 412  
But she was listening on the phone  
I thought I had it all together  
But I was wrong obviously  
cause what was once done in the dark  
Came to light eventually  
  
Chorus  
Living down low down low  
Living that double life  
Living down low down low  
Living that double life  
It aint right  
  
I dont believe the shit I did the night we were at your moms  
I got a page from out of town lied and said it was my job  
Grabbed my hat coat gloves and scarf  
I told you that I would return  
But by the look upon your face you had already discerned  
You pulled me to the side and you begged for me to stay  
But I was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away  
  
Chorus  
  
Okay you youre saying you came in and  
And these two women they they poured  
Nah nah nah nah nah it wasnt nothing like that  
All I know is uh I was asleep they came in  
Woke me up pourin hot grits  
And all kinds of shit on me man okay beatin me and shit  
Hittin me with all sorts of type shit Damn  
  
With a cigar in my mouth over Vegas city lights  
On a path way up the hill to be with my other wife  
A rich nigga living strife going on like nothings wrong  
But that damn Caller ID is the reason for this song  
So one called up the other while I was out playing some golf  
Talking about my doggish ways and how I need to be dropped off  
  
Chorus  
  
Now go ahead shoot me now because Im guilty as sin  
Playin Russian roulette with hearts not to mention the kids  
Now every day I live I regret all that I did  
Out smoking with friends as I reminisced  
  
Chorus  
  
I cant take it no more Ive got to confess  
See now I dont know why  
I thought that I could keep creeping  
cause you see what goes around  
Comes back on around and back on around  
And back on around again yes it does  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
In a state of shock thats what it left me  
Take it from a man who knows  
That three aint company  
No no no thats what I kept telling myself  
Now I done lost the houses the kids and the dogs  
Now Im sleeping in my mommas house  
And even she says your sorry ass dont deserve no help  
Must be because of what my old man did to her
