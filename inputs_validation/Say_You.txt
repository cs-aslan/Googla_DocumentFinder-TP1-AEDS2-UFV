Say you  
Who do you belong to  
Say you  
Ive been hoping to meet you  
  
Baby Baby  
Youve caught my eye  
I cant deny  
I realize its you  
I like what I see  
Youre perfect for me  
Fast and fancy

Who do you love Say you  
  
I dont want to be friends if my heart kept seein  
Watching you play around You play around  
This would make me sad  
Hurt so bad  
Drag my spirit down
