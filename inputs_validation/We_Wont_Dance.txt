We wont dance no more  
We wont shine out on the floor  
We wont sway the band wont play  
We wont dance  
  
I kid you not we were hot  
When the weekend came wed dance nonstop  
No jitterbug no substitute  
No twist and turn no crash and burn  
Could top us two  
  
We wont dance no more  
We wont shine out on the floor  
We wont sway the band wont play  
We wont dance  
  
As I dipped you down in your yellow dress  
Wed brush the floor in a slow caress  
As minutes turned to a rising sun  
Wed leave the day to rest  
Our dancing done  
  
We wont dance no more  
We wont shine out on the floor  
We wont sway the band wont play  
We wont dance  
  
If I were God and controlled what is  
Id steal your shoes so you couldnt dance with his  
Well Im not all that I could be  
But youll never dance with him  
The way you danced with me  
  
We wont dance no more  
We wont dance no more  
Well Im not all that I could be  
But youll never dance with him  
The way you danced with me  
  
We wont dance no more  
We wont shine out on the floor  
We wont sway the band wont play  
We wont dance  
  
We wont dance no more  
We wont shine out on the floor  
We wont sway the band wont play  
We wont dance
