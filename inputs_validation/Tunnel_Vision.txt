All I want  
Is all you got  
Make me happy baby  
And Ill make it hot  
  
I dont need no doctor  
To tell me what to do  
Cause I know Im goin  
Straight ahead for you  
  
I got that tunnel vision goin through my head  
I cant help myself all I see is red  
Tunnel vision goin through my head  
Lay me down inside your flying bed  
  
All thats yours  
And all thats mine  
Well put together baby  
And we can combine  
  
We dont need no lawyer  
Lets not make this long  
We just need a love thing  
Thats beautiful and strong  
  
I got that tunnel vision  
Goin through my head  
I cant help myself all I see is red  
Tunnel vision goin through my head  
Lay me down inside your flying bed  
  
Tunnel vision goin through my head  
I cant help myself all I see is red  
Tunnel vision goin through my head  
Lay me down inside your flying bed  
Come on here  yeah   
  
Tunnel vision goin through my head  
I cant help myself all I see is red  
Tunnel vision goin through my head  
Lay me down inside your flying bed  
  
Tunnel vision goin through my head  
I cant help myself all I see is red  
Tunnel vision goin through my head  
Lay me down inside your flying bed
