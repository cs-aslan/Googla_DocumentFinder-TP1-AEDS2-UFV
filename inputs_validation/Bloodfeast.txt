When they pull out her tongue  
Pull off her face pluck out her eyes  
Well the blood runs cold for  
  
When it drips from the mouth  
Be forewarned be prepared  
For a grizzly bloodfeast  
  
And that bloods so real  
Because I just cant fake it  
And that bloods so real  
Because I just cant fake it  
  
When you think of severed heads  
Think of my face think that youre alive  
Well I guess I fooled you  
  
When you think of my face  
Think of your blood think that youre dead  
Cause its a grizzly bloodfeast  
  
Im possessing your death  
Possessing your blood  
Possessing your head  
Cause its a grizzly bloodfeast  
  
Im possessing your heart  
Possessing your tongue  
Possessing your blood  
Cause it just wont fake you  
  
And that bloods so real  
Because I just cant fake it  
And that bloods so real  
Because I just cant fake it  
And that blood and that blood  
  
Im possessing your death  
Possessing your blood  
Possessing your demise  
For a grizzly bloodfeast  
  
Im possessing your heart  
Possessing your tongue  
Possessing your blood  
Cause it just wont fake you  
  
And that bloods so real  
Because I just cant fake it  
And that bloods so real  
Because I just cant fake it  
And that blood and that blood
