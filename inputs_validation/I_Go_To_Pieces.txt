Ive been wrong  
Ive been of no use  
I wander these streets alone  
Heard every excuse  
I go to pieces  
Why dont you  
Get carried away  
I go to pieces  
Why dont you  
  
Ive know all about  
The pain Ive caused you  
I wish I could run away  
What else can I do  
Cause I go to pieces  
Why dont you  
Stick in my side  
I go to pieces  
Why dont you  
Hear anything that I say  
Watching you drifting away  
  
Ive known all about  
Love Ive refused  
I tried to hide you away  
Aint no use  
I go to pieces  
Why dont you  
Know what it means  
I go to pieces  
Why dont you  
Get carried away  
I go to pieces  
Why dont you  
Why dont you  
Why dont you
