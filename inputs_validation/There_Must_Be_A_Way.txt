There must be a way to help me forget that were through  
There must be a way to stop me from dreamin of you  
There must be a star in the skies that isnt reflecting your eyes  
I just dont know how to disguise how much I miss you  
  
There must be a song that doesnt remind me of you  
There must be a kiss thatll thrill me like yours used to do  
I look for a way to be happy happy with somebody new  
Oh there must be a way but I cant find a way without you  
  
There must be a song that doesnt remind me of you  
Yes there must be a kiss thatll thrill me like yours used to do  
I look for a way to be happy happy with somebody new  
Oh there must be a way but I cant find a way without you
