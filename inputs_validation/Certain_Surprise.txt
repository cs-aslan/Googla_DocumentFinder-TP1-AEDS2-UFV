And now the air is clear my dear and youre still here and so  
A certain surprise give you my sweet certain surprise  
Silence has never been my thing  
Im one of those I love to shout and sing about my love  
Sweet flying dove theres no one above sweet certain surprise  
  
Soft and certain tell the moon My love is how I think of you and so  
With certain surprise give you my sweet certain surprise  
Laughter has always been my thing  
Im one of those oh I love to shout and sing about my love  
Sweet flying dove theres no one above sweet certain surprise  
  
Oh were too sensitive my dear two fugitives from fear and so  
With a certain surprise give you my sweet certain surprise  
Silence has never been my thing  
Im one of those I love to shout and sing about my love  
Sweet flying dove theres no one above sweet certain surprise
