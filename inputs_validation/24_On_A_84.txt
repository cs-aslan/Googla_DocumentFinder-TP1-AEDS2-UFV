Esham  
The red of blood I seen it come in 25 shades  
Just your ordinary average homicide days  
Long ago a homie told me yo that crime pays  
No Im in the hot pursuit Im riding sideways  
I know my life aint worth the bullets in your 45  
But you aint hitting me I jump into a sporty dive  
Before you know I got my shank inside your throat and sides  
24s on 84 Regal as you was flooring right  
Pilling chrome creeping through the ghetto zone  
9 millimilli bang for the metal tome  
Send you back to your mama wrapped in cellophone  
You seen the lights of the flashy berretta chrome  
Slice your ass with this hatchet like we Tom and Jerry  
Knock your shit out get you paid by the tooth fairy  
When you die youre getting wet up like your bloody Carrie  
Tuck your ass nice and cozy for the cemetery  
When I burry your ass  
Chorus  
Money to my mamma Im sending that  
Corners full of drama Im bending that  
24s on a 84 Regal and Im grinding  
24s on a 84 Regal and Im grinding  
Money to my mamma Im sending that  
Corners full of drama Im bending that  
24s on a 84 Regal and Im grinding  
24s on my 84 Regal and Im grinding  
TNT  
24s on my 84 Regal  
Im riding down your block with 2 Desert Eagles  
Im fixing to save the underground like Neo People  
People theres no equal  
Fuck the sequel  
This is it  
A hit is a hit  
Youre about to get your wig split  
Its the real deal no counterfeit  
Niggas check my style my paint jobs gleaming  
My rims is beaming  
My hoes swallow my seamen  
Oops I was just peeing  
Let me restart fuck going to court  
Live in the fast lane cause life is to short  
Hoes quote my rhymes  
Fiends cop my dimes  
My shit is so clean  
I only ride when the sun shines  
Read between the lines  
Fucking with mine you lose your mind  
And I aint lying niggas is dying  
Chorus  
Money to my mamma Im sending that  
Corners full of drama Im bending that  
24s on a 84 Regal and Im grinding  
24s on a 84 Regal and Im grinding  
Money to my mamma Im sending that  
Corners full of drama Im bending that  
24s on a 84 Regal and Im grinding  
24s on my 84 Regal and Im grinding  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
Eightyfour Regal cruising on twentyfours  
Looking for these hoes  
Stop at every liquor store  
You aint peep my twentyfo spinners  
Diamond spoke  
Popos looking at them at red lights and catch strokes  
I get head while Im mashing on 7 mile and Grashiot  
Grip the stearing wheel tight bitch I aint crashing it  
Barrys in the rearview what the fuck  
Again Push him out the window pealed out on his head  
I aint scared fuck what he talking  
Talking about my Regal illegal cause flawsing  
So its back to the land to get my dime bags  
Not to mention my hatchet to deal with these fags  
Im back in my home turf Southwest  
Where the hoes got they mans name tatted on they chest  
What you hate me for  
Twentyfours on a eightyfour  
When I open the door  
What you waiting for  
Chorus  
Money to my mamma Im sending that  
Corners full of drama Im bending that  
24s on a 84 Regal and Im grinding  
24s on a 84 Regal and Im grinding  
Money to my mamma Im sending that  
Corners full of drama Im bending that  
24s on a 84 Regal and Im grinding  
24s on my 84 Regal and Im grinding
