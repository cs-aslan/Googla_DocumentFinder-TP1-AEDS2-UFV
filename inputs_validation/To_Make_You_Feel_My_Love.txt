When the rain is blowing in your face  
And the whole world is on your case  
I would offer you a warm embrace  
To make you feel my love  
  
When the evening shadows and the stars appear  
And there is no one there to dry your tears  
I could hold you for a million years  
To make you feel my love  
  
I know you havent made your mind up yet  
But I would never do you wrong  
Ive known it from the moment that we met  
No doubt in my mind where you belong  
  
Id go hungry Id go black and blue  
Id go crawling down the avenue  
Theres nothing that I wouldnt do  
To make you feel my love  
  
The storms are raging on a rolling sea  
Down on the highway of regret  
The winds of change are blowing wild and free  
You aint seen nothing like me yet  
  
I did make you happy make your dreams come true  
Theres nothing that I would not do  
Go to the ends of the earth for you  
To make you feel my love  
Theres nothing that I wouldnt do  
To make you feel my love
