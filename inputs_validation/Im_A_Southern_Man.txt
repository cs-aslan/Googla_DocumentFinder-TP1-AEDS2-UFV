Send me a pan of corn bread  
With some turnip greens on the side  
And if you really want to mess with my head  
Give me anything southern fried  
  
Give me some faded blue jeans  
And a pair of old cowboy boots  
And Im gonna tell you where I come from  
Tell you somethin about my roots  
  
Im a southern man  
Im a southern man  
Im a southern man  
Im a southern man  
  
Send me a woman to love me  
With a lot of meat on her bones  
Theres something about a big lady  
I just cant leave em alone  
  
Id like to take her down to the river  
Go skinny dippin in the night  
Aint nothin like being with my lady  
And makin love in the pale moon light  
  
Cause Im a southern man ah ah ah  
Im a southern man  
Im a southern man  
Southern man  
Im a southern man  
  
Give me that soulful music  
It sure makes me feel so nice  
So I can do the alligator  
And get it on every Saturday night  
  
Give me that Southern Comfort  
Give me Annie Greensprings wine  
Take me on down to the bayou  
and Ill sure have a real good time  
  
Cause Im a southern man  
Im a southern man  
Im a southern man  
Southern man  
  
Im a southern man
