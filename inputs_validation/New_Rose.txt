spoken Is she really going out with him  
  
Hey  
  
I got a feeling inside of me  
Its kinda strange like a stormy sea  
I dont know why I dont know why  
I guess these thingsve gotta be  
  
Chorus  
I got a new rose I got it good  
Yes I knew that I always would  
I cant stop to mess around  
I got a brand new rose in town  
  
See the sun see the sunny skies  
Dont get too close itll burn your eyes  
Dont you run away that way  
Come back another day  
  
Chorus  
  
I never thought this could happen to me  
Im a strange washing machine  
I never served somebody this sane  
Ill never never never be too late  
  
Hey  
  
Repeat first verse  
  
Chorus
