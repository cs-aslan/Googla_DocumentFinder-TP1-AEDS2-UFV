Do you belong to me all the way  
I never thought Id have to ask someday  
I dont really know what you mean to say  
Im so afraid to just let go  
Though Id believe if you let me know  
No matter how much you mean to me  
I couldnt just take that risk with you right now  
But whatever I do cant resist your love  
Its all up to you  
Before we can start something new  
Refrain  
Know it  
I wanna give it a chance  
First I must know you love me  
Know it  
Ive got to see you again  
Know it  
Oh how I wish you were sure  
Cause I wanna start believing  
Know what youre feeling  
So I can let go  
No matter how much you mean to me  
I couldnt just take that risk with you right now  
Stayin away gets harder and harder  
As I go on alone  
The more I want you here with me  
Repeat Refrain  
Know it  
I wanna give it a chance  
First I must know you love me  
Know it  
Ive got to see you again  
Know it  
Oh how I wish you were sure  
Cause I wanna start believing  
Know what youre feeling  
So I can let  
I can let go
