Ive been romanced and Ive been danced  
Crazy nights and hard times  
Life has lost it mystery  
And love is blind and can not find me  
Cause Im blowin away  
And shadows take my love and leave  
Im blowin away  
And shadows keep taking  
My love and leaving me  
I have past aside my foolish pride  
Going down for the very last time  
Cause I have searched this earth  
And sailed the seas  
But love is blind can not find me  
Chorus x 2
