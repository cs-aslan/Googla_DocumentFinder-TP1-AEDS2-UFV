They say that heaven is ten zillion light years away  
And just the pure at heart will walk her righteous streets someday  
They say that heaven is ten zillion light years away  
But if there is a God we need Him now  
Where is your God  
Thats what my friends ask me  
And I say its taken Him so long  
Cause weve got so far to come  
  
Tell me people  
Why cant they say that hate is ten zillion light years away  
Why cant the light of good shine Gods love in every soul  
Why must my color black make me a lesser man  
I thought this world was made for every man  
He loves us all thats what my God tells me  
And I say its taken Him so long  
Cause weve got so far to come  
  
But in my heart I can feel it yeah  
Feel His spirit wow oh woo  
Feel it yeah feel His spirit  
  
I cant say that heaven is ten zillion light years away  
But if so let all be pure at heart  
Just to walk her righteous streets I pray  
Let Gods love shine within to save our evil souls  
For those who dont believe will never see the light  
Where is my God  He lives inside of me  
And I say its taken Him so long  
Cause weve got so far to come  
No people where is your God  
Inside please let Him be  
And I say its taken Him so long  
Cause weve got so far to come  
  
But if you open your heart you can feel it yeah yeah  
Feel His spirit yeah  
Feel it feel His spirit wow oh wow  
Feel it you can feel His spirit  
I opened my heart one morning and  
I sho nuff could feel it yeah yeah  
Feel His spirit yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
You can feel it yeah feel His spirit  
You can feel it yeah feel His spirit
