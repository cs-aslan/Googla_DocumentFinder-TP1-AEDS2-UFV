It said 330 on my watch  
Big show dont start till 900  
Thought a cold one sure would hit the spot  
She started pouring shots  
It was only me and her in there  
Lets get outta here  
Might lose my job but I dont care  
Come along if you dare  
Lay down my tailgate  
Hey boy whatchu say  
Do a little day drinkin  
A little bit of love makin  
A whole lot of world shakin  
Then well do it again  
Do it again  
Start from the sun shinin  
Go until the stars light up the sky  
Boy dont you leave me hangin  
Cause its never too late  
To get down and dirty  
Low down and dirty  
I turned up her radio  
She started dancin real slow  
Like she was puttin on a show  
Three hours left to rock and roll  
Wet sweat was pourin off her skin  
Her body made me wanna sin  
Right then my buzz was kickin in  
She had a devils grin  
And then her boss drove by  
She flipped them the bird  
She looked me in the eye and said  
You give me the urge  
To do a little day drinkin  
A little bit of love makin  
A whole lot of world shakin  
Then well do it again  
Do it again  
Start from the sun shinin  
Go until the stars light up the sky  
Boy dont you leave me hangin  
Cause its never too late  
To get down and dirty  
Low down and dirty  
Do a little day drinkin  
A little bit of love makin  
Do a little day drinkin  
A little bit of love makin  
A whole lot of world shakin  
Then well do it again  
Do it again  
Start from the sun shinin  
Go until the stars light up the sky  
Boy dont you leave me hangin  
Cause its never too late  
To get down and dirty
