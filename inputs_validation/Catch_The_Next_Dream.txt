Hey baby its beginning to feel  
Like weve been spinning our wheels  
Hangin round this town too long  
Why dont we catch a ride  
Sail away on the outbound tide  
Its time that we be movin on  
Lets catch the next dream outta here  
Close our eyes and disappear  
Well say so long and well be gone  
On the next dream outta here  
Were as free as the night is young  
To go as far as our hearts can run  
Lets set our sights on paradise  
Throw caution to the wind  
And never look back again  
Well ride our love on through the night  
Chorus  
Well say so long  
And well be gone  
On the next dream outta here  
On the next dream  
On the next dream  
On the next dream  
On the next dream  
Just close your eyes  
And we can ride  
Oooohhhoawhooo  
On the next dream  
On the next dream outta here  
We can ride  
Oooohhhoawhooo
