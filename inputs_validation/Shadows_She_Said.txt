Theres no more place to go  
the other bars are closed  
the night the stranger came to town  
how do you know  
when youre right or wrong  
How do you know  
if you hurt or if you dont  
So many people say so many things  
but nobody agrees on anything  
theres no more place to go  
shadows she said  
theres no more place to go  
shadows she said  
this nights an empty shell  
shadows she said  
and all the shadows followed after her  
you burned the book of life  
the cradle and the tomb  
how could you ever dare  
theres no more turning back  
your stars lit up in flames  
theres gunsmoke in the air  
and yesterday you bought a brandnew car  
but you dont feel like going very far  
theres no more place to go  
Theres no more place to go  
shadows she said  
theres no more place to go  
shadows she said  
this nights an empty shell  
shadows she said  
and all the shadows followed after her  
here they come  
Shadows she said  
And all the shadows followed after her  
Shadows she said
