Well its just a simple fact I  
Need to have another drink or two to move on  
And then ya wont matter at all  
Well its just a simple fact I  
Need to lose you as a ball and chain and move on  
And then ya wont matter at all  
Wanted to believe  
Wanted to believe in something  
Now youre one less headache left at home  
Wanted to believe  
Wanted to believe in something  
Now youre one less headache left at home  
And now all thats left is  
Shattered glass and some broken dreams for all  
It really doesnt matter at all  
Now that its all said and done I  
Had to have another drink for you and move on  
And now you dont matter at all  
Wanted to believe  
Wanted to believe in something  
Now youre one less headache left at home  
Wanted to believe  
Wanted to believe in something  
Now youre one less headache left at home  
Wanted to believe  
Wanted to believe in something  
Now youre one less headache left at home  
Wanted to believe  
Wanted to believe in something  
Now youre one less headache left at home  
Left at home  
Believe in something  
Now youre one less headache left at home
