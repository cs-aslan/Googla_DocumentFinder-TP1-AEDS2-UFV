Wake up dreaming  
Crooked days left behind  
These closed eyes  
  
The places that weve been  
Footsteps and handprints  
The more weve yet to see the more I find  
  
Its all we have  
So good so far  
  
Its not over til were done  
And weve only just begun  
Im in the middle of the longest fight  
Ive ever had in all my life  
And it aint over til weve won  
  
Well I was thoughtless and careless  
The day I lost my innocence  
Chasing you into the sun  
  
Its okay when Im afraid  
Its okay when Im a fool  
Who only plays the cards hes got  
  
Its all we have  
So good so far  
  
Its not over til were done  
And weve only just begun  
Im in the middle of the longest fight  
Ive ever had in all my life  
And it aint over til weve won  
  
So heres to tomorrow  
The next one that follows  
All and anything that comes  
  
Well let the summer kiss the day  
Watch the rains come in  
And wash away the crazy thing weve done  
  
Its all we have  
So good so far  
All we have  
So good so far  
  
Its so good so far  
Im in the middle of the longest fight  
Ive ever had in all my life  
And it aint over til weve won  
  
Its not over til were done  
And weve only just begun  
Im in the middle of the longest fight  
Ive ever had in all my life  
And it aint over til Ive won  
  
This aint over til were done  
And weve only just begun  
Im in the middle of the longest fight  
Ive ever had in all my life  
And it aint over til weve won
