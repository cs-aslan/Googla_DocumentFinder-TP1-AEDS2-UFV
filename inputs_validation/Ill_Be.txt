When darkness falls upon your heart and soul  
Ill be the light that shines for you  
When you forget how beautiful you are  
Ill be there to remind you  
When you cant find your way  
Ill find my way to you  
When troubles come around  
I will come to you  
  
Ill be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on  
Be your shelter  
When you need someone to see you through  
Ill be there to carry you  
Ill be there  
Ill be the rock that will be strong for you  
The one that will hold on to you  
When you feel that rain falling down  
When theres nobody else around  
Ill be  
  
And when youre there with no one there to hold  
Ill be the arms that reach for you  
And when you feel your faith is running low  
Ill be there to believe in you  
When all you find are lies  
Ill be the truth you need  
When you need someone to run to  
You can run to me  
  
Ill be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on  
Be your shelter  
When you need someone to see you through  
Ill be there to carry you  
Ill be there  
Ill be the rock that will be strong for you  
The one that will hold on to you  
When you feel that rain falling down  
When theres nobody else around  
Ill be  
  
Ill be the sun  
When your hearts filled with rain  
Ill be the one  
To chase the rain away  
  
Ill be your shoulder when you need someone to lean on  
Be your shelter  
When you need someone to see you through  
Ill be there to carry you  
Ill be there  
Ill be the rock that will be strong for you  
The one that will hold on to you  
When you feel that rain falling down  
When theres nobody else around  
Ill be  
Ill be
