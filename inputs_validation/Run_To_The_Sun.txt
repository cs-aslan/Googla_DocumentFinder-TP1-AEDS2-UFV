For the first time in my life Im up to run away  
Its not a choice that I made easily  
  
Its not that Im ashamed to face the light of day  
Its really just a case of selfdelusion  
  
And I know it aint easy  
I know it aint easy  
I know it aint easy  
To see the truth  
  
So run the sun heres one for the road  
And may Gods love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
  
That I should fall from grace implies a twist of fate  
But Im open to the joys and woes of passion  
  
And who shall take the wheel when its time for overkill  
Theres no release when destiny is calling  
  
And I know it aint easy  
I know it aint easy  
I know it aint easy  
To see the truth  
  
So run the sun heres one for the road  
And may Gods love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
  
So run to the sun heres one for the road  
Though Ill never be lonely  
Are you so high above me  
Whoa  
  
Run to the sun  
Run to the sun  
Run to the sun  
  
And I know it aint easy  
Somebody reach me  
Willing to teach me  
  
So run to the sun heres one for the road  
And may Gods love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
  
Ill run to the sun heres one for the road  
Though Ill never be lonely  
Are you so high above me  
Whoa  
  
So run to the sun heres one for the road  
And may Gods love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
So run to the sun heres one for the road  
Though Ill never be lonely  
Are you so high above me  
Whoa
