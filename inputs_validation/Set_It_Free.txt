I can see the rain  
Come into my room again  
Broken window pane  
Now reminds me Im alive  
  
Could it be right  
Giving up my darling  
Ill wait for you now  
To remind me why Ive gone  
  
How I love to write  
Songs that have no answers  
Oh theres nothing on my mind  
That I want to let go of  
  
Letting it go on pretending  
Everything has its way of ending  
And Im a loner  
The way I should be  
  
Set it free  
Let it free my love to fly  
Set it free  
Set it free  
Let it free my love to be  
Can I be free  
  
Still its gotta rain  
Wonder when Ill see a change in weather  
Somethings getting tangled up again  
And I cant find an end  
  
Cant let it go on returning  
Ive given everything that the harlequin boy can find  
And Im tired of trying  
Id rather leave than tell lies  
  
Set it free  
Let it free my love to fly  
Set it free  
Set it free  
Let it free my love to be  
Youll be free  
  
Youll be free my love to fly  
Free to be what I cant face  
In love again  
Set it free  
  
Free  
Set it free  
Set it free my love  
  
Free  
Set it free  
Set it free my love
