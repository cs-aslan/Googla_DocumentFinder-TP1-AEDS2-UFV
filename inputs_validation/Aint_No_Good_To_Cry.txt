Hear a new girl moved to the town  
Now your baby just aint no where to be found  
Now you think youre in dispair  no  
You feel that chill  that cold black clinging in the air  
  
Loves a game  youre in it  
And youre so proud  
Someone you can depend on  
Someone you can rely on  
No matter what you say  
You wont come  
Running back to youre arms  
Its all over baby  
Well it dont do no good to cry  
  
How do think I felt when you  
Let me stay here never once said that were through  
You didnt fight it all the way no  
But I dont care  you just dont mean that much to me this way  
  
Loves a game  youre in it  
And youre so proud  
Someone you can depend on  
Someone you can rely on  
No matter what you say  
You wont come  
Running back to youre arms  
Its all over baby  
Well it dont do no good to cry  
  
solo  
  
Loves a game  youre in it  
And youre so proud  
Someone you can depend on  
Someone you can rely on  
No matter what you say  
You wont come  
Running back to youre arms  
Its all over baby  
Well it dont do no good to cry
