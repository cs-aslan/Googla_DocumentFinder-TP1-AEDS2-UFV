I ride I ride the winds that bring the rain  
A creature of love and cant be tamed  
I want you cause Im gonna take your love from him  
And Ill touch your face and hot burning skin  
No hell never ever touch you like I do  
So look in my eyes and burn alive the truth  
  
Im a wild child come and love me  
I want you  
My hearts in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
Im a wild child come and love me  
I want you  
My hearts in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
I want you  
  
Tell me tell me the lies youre telling him when you  
Run away cause I want to know  
Cause I Im sure its killing him to find  
That you run to me when he lets you go  
Cause Im burning burning burning up with fire  
So come turn me on and turn the flames up higher  
  
Im a wild child come and love me  
I want you  
My hearts in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
  
Im a wild child come and love me  
I want you  
My hearts in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
I want you  
  
A naked hit machine I want your love  
When the moons arise well feel just what it does  
  
Im a wild child come and love me  
I want you  
My hearts in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
Im a wild child come and love me  
I want you  
My hearts in exile I need you to touch me  
I want you  
My hearts in exile I need you to touch me  
Cause I want what you do  
I want you
