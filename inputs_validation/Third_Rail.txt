As much as I love you  
As much as I care  
I just cant pretend that  
The problems not there  
We know all the boundaries  
From where we both stand  
Our life has been happy  
Without any plan  
But now I feel sorrow  
As friendship turns stale  
Our loves still on track but  
Without a third rail  
The moon has come up now  
The sun has gone down  
A million or more times  
Since youve been around  
Our life still goes on but  
It wont be the same  
As when were together  
Love only knows pain  
With words that are tender  
Our love will prevail  
But can our love go on  
Without a third rail  
  
White clouds appear like cotton wool  
The wind bends trees to bow  
As we farewell this love of ours  
Like some old sacred cow  
As sure as heavens above us  
And hell is down below  
Without a third rail to drive us  
Well have no place to go  
  
Theres a lump in my throat  
Im choked as I say  
Our love has reached twilight  
Lets call it a day  
We kiss on the platform  
The doors slowly close  
Like theatre curtains  
Pulled after the show  
We both know its over  
And somehow weve failed  
Loves going in circles  
Without a third rail
