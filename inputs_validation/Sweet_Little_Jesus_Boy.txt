Sweet little  
Jesus boy  
They made you  
Be born  
In a manger  
Sweet little  
Holy child  
Didnt know  
Who You were  
  
Didnt know you  
Come to save us  
Lord  
To take  
Our sins away  
Our eyes  
Was blind  
We couldnt see  
We didnt know  
Who You were  
  
You have  
Told us how  
We are trying  
Master you have  
Shown us how  
Even when you  
Were dying  
  
Just seems like  
We cant do right  
Look how  
We treated you  
But please Sir  
Forgive us Lord  
We didnt know  
It was you  
  
Sweet little  
Jesus Boy  
Born  
A long time ago  
Sweet little  
Holy Child  
We didnt know  
Who You were  
We didnt know  
Who You were
