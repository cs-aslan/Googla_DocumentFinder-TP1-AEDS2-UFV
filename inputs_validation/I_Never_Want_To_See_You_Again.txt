I know the ether can never claim the earth  
Atmospheric gasses cannot remain with dirt  
We purchase pleasure and pay for it with hurt  
And we rarely get our moneys worth  
See how we grasp at the stars   
Theyre so far away  
You cant even see whats right in front of you  
Flesh wounds heal  
Broken bones mend  
But youre not my friend  
I never want to see you again  
I never want to see you again
