He beat on me He cheat on me  
Hes mean to me ooo but he could be so sweet to me  
My friends say I should give him up  
But ohhhh I need him I need him a lot  
Thats why Im gonna take it take it take it take what hes got  
  
He disowns me Hes going to sleep  
But when were alone he tells me Im his very own  
Yes hes got what I need but ohh I need what hes got  
Thats why Im gonna take it take it take it take what hes got  
  
Ohhh my friends say hes no good  
Hes not worth the time of day  
For he could be an ice man trash man a junk man any kind of man  
But nothing can drive me away ohhhh  
  
He cause me pain you make me wait sometimes out in the rain  
You can make me feel ashamed but I never dress the same  
And I love him so much nothing can make me stop  
  
Thats why Im gonna take it take it take it take what hes got x2  
  
Oooohhhh give it up give it up right now Im gonna take it baby  
Take it take it Take what hes got
