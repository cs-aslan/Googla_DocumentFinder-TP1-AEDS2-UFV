Its always one thing or another seems like we never get ahead  
Reaching out for the brass ring and landing in the dirt instead  
We cant get past yesterday were only counting down from ten  
It seems like every move we make brings us back where we began  
Youve gotta Run Between The Raindrops  
If you want to see the sun  
Run Run Run Between The Raindrops  
Run Between The Raindrops if you want to see the sun  
Run Run Run  Run Baby Run  
  
Somewhere theres a sun thats shining  
Somewhere well find a life thats good  
Some way Im gonna make it happen  
Just like you always knew I could  
  
Were treading water on a river of tears  
And I dont know what to do  
I can take a beating but I aint gonna let it happen to you you  
  
Youve gotta Run Between The Raindrops  
If you want to see the sun  
Run Run Run Between The Raindrops  
Run Between The Raindrops if you want to see the sun  
You Gotta Run Run Run  Run Baby Run  
  
Were treading water on a river of tears  
And I dont know what to do  
  
Youve gotta Run Between The Raindrops  
If you want to see the sun  
Run Run Run Between The Raindrops  
Run Between The Raindrops if you want to see the sun  
Run Run Run  Run Baby Run  
  
Run Between The Raindrops if you want to see the sun  
You Gotta Run Run Run  Run Baby Run  
  
You Gotta Run Run Run  Run Baby Run
