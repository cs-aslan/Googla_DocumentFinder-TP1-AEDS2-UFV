Pull back the curtain  
Open up the blind  
Let the light on the window  
I cant close for all this time  
I wanted to forget the pain of falling  
That you maybe remember now  
Dreams werent always made to be broken  
  
Chorus  
When you hold me in your arm  
Remind my heart  
Of the way love should be  
In the moment I let go  
Remind my heart  
That youre really there for me  
Like the sun breaking through the dark  
Remind my heart  
  
Ohh can it be this simple  
Can it be this true  
All the fears Ive held so long  
Swept away by you  
Slowly now you bring me to my senses  
And I can feel the warmth again  
Of the flame Id thought Ive lost forever  
  
Chorus  
  
What I missed so long remind my heart  
Of the tenderness and the feeling you remind remind my heart  
How love can make you strong  
Oh baby youre makin me strong  
  
Chorus  
  
Ohh in the moment I let go remind my heart  
Remind my heart remind my heart  
That youre really there for me  
Remind my heart  
Of the way this love should be  
Remind my heart  
Remind my heart
