Think Im steel tough as nails  
Never feel never fail  
But youre wrong  
So damn wrong  
Feel the weight of your hate  
I still bleed my heart aches  
As you take  
And You take  
  
Words cut through my skin  
Tears roll down my chin  
My walls crumble within  
But Ill take it all on  
And get up when I fell  
Till the last curtain call  
  
But youll never get the best of me no more  
Said youll never get the best of me no more  
Arent you tired of throwing stones  
Trying to kick me when Im down  
But youll never get the best of me no more  
  
So youre cold made of ice  
Heart of stone born to fight  
But I cry  
I still cry  
Are you happy you know  
Im unhappy you know  
Take your shot  
Im wide open  
  
Words cut through my skin  
Tears roll down my chin  
My walls crumble within  
But Ill take it all on  
And get up when I fell  
Till the last curtain call  
  
But youll never get the best of me no more  
Said youll never get the best of me no more  
Arent you tired of throwing stones  
Trying to kick me when Im down  
But youll never get the best of me no more  
  
But youll never get the best of me no more  
Said youll never get the best of me no more  
Arent you tired of throwing stones  
Trying to kick me when Im down  
But youll never get the best of me no more  
  
Heartbroken an beaten  
Knocked down and mistreated  
I will rise undefeated  
I will not let you bring me down  
Now the pain is deleted  
And I will never repeat it  
I will rise and defeat it  
I will not let you bring me down  
No I wont let you bring me down  
  
Knocked down and mistreated  
Heartbroken and bleeding  
Still I rise undefeated  
Cause youll never  
  
Cause youll never get the best of me no more  
Said youll never get the best of me no more  
Arent you tired of throwing stones  
Trying to kick me when Im down  
But youll never get the best of me no more  
  
Heartbroken and bleeding  
Knocked down and mistreated  
Still I rise undefeated  
I will not let you bring me down  
Now the pain is deleted  
And I will never repeat it  
I will rise and defeat it  
I will not let you bring me down
