Listen to me baby  
Theres something you must see  
I want to be with you gal  
If you want to be with me  
  
But if you got to go  
Its all right  
But if you got to go go now  
Or else you gotta stay all night  
  
It aint that Im questionin you  
To take part in any quiz  
Its just that I aint got no watch  
An you keep askin me what time it is  
  
But if you got to go  
Its all right  
But if you got to go go now  
Or else you gotta stay all night  
  
I am just a poor boy baby  
Lookin to connect  
But I certainly dont want you thinkin  
That I aint got any respect  
  
But if you got to go  
Its all right  
But if you got to go go now  
Or else you gotta stay all night  
  
You know Id have nightmares  
And a guilty conscience too  
If I kept you from anything  
That you really wanted to do  
  
But if you got to go  
Its all right  
But if you got to go go now  
Or else you gotta stay all night  
  
It aint that Im wantin  
Anything you never gave before  
Its just that Ill be sleepin soon  
Itll be too dark for you to find the door  
  
But if you got to go  
Its all right  
But if you got to go go now  
Or else you gotta stay all night
