I met a little girl  
She on her way to school  
I met a little girl  
She aint nobodys fool  
Well go on baby  
And Ill see you on your way to school  
Got the readin and a writin and arithmetic  
Know those teachers bout to make you sick  
Now go on baby dont be nobodys fool  
Ill see you in the mornin on your way to school  
Well you know they got you standin at the head of your class  
And the kids dont like it try to make you bad  
Go on baby dont be nobodys fool  
Ill see you in the mornin on your way to school  
Well I met a little girl  
She on her way to school  
I met a little girl  
She aint nobodys fool  
Well go on baby  
And Ill see you on your way to school
