You always said you were the compassionate one  
But now youre laughing at the sun  
With all your high class friends you think youve got it made  
The only thing you made was that tanned look on your face  
With all your cigarettes and fancy cars  
You aint a clue who or what you are  
Youre dreaming your life away  
Fish out of water  
Go swim in the tide today  
Fish out of water  
We used to sit and talk about primal scream  
To exorcise our past was our adolescent dream  
But now its sink or swim since your memory fails  
Now in Neptunes kitchen you will be food for killer whales  
And on the crucifix his mother made  
Hangs one more martyr to the hit parade  
Youre dreaming youre life away  
Fish out of water  
Go swim in the tide today  
Fish out of water  
Youre dreaming youre life away  
Fish out of water  
Go swim in the tide today  
Fish out of water
