Hes an ol altar boy  
Lying out there in the street  
Hes an ol alter boy  
Bound up in leather and chains  
Thats why Im feeling so blue  
Im an old altar boy  
What about you  
  
Now I can order in Latin  
Make em au gratin Joe  
Im an old altar boy  
Thats why Im so depressed  
I never got the rest of the dream  
Just the ritual  
Now Im habitual  
Majoring in crimes that are unspeakable  
Cause Im an old altar boy  
Thats what happened to me  
  
Im an old altar boy  
Hes hoping he can meet a woman dressed like a nun  
He knows theres got to be some around here  
Drinking across from the church  
A little Father Cribari wine  
On a Sunday morn time  
  
Im an old altar boy  
Why is he winking at this time in his life  
He never took a wife cause hes an old altar boy  
Oh yeah  
What about you
