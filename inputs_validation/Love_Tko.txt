Oooooh  
  
Lookin back over my years  
I guess Ive shed some tears  
Told myself time and again  
This time Im gonna win  
  
But another fight Things aint right  
Im losing again  
It takes a fool to lose twice  
And start all over again  
  
I think I better let him go  
Cause it looks like another love TKO  
Let it go baby  
I think I better let him go  
Cause it looks like another love TKO Ohh yeah  
  
I tried to take control of the love  
He took control of me  
See you lose all thought and sense of time  
You have a change of mind  
  
Takin the bumps and the bruises  
And all the pain of a twotime lose  
And I try to hold on My faith is gone  
Its just another sad song  
  
So I think I gotta  
Gotta let it go  
I gotta let him go  
Let it go baby  
Cause it looks like another love TKO  
Oh yes it does yes it does  
  
I think I gotta  
Gotta let it go  
Mmmmmmm  
Let it go baby  
Cause it looks like another love TKO  
  
Boy whatcha want me to do Cant stand up to you  
No no no no  
  
I try to take control of the love  
It took control of me  
See you lose all thought and sense of time  
You have a change of mind  
  
Taking the bumps and the bruises  
And all the pain of a twotime lose  
Then I try to hold on My faith is gone  
Its just another sad song  
  
I think I better  
Better let it go  
I better let him go  
Let it go baby  
Cause it looks like another love TKO  
  
Yeah I better  
Better let it go  
I gotta let him go  
Let it go Miss M  
Another love love TKO
