Calling all comas  
Prisoner on the loose  
Description  
A spitting image of me  
Except for a heartshaped hole where the hope runs out  
  
Shock me awake  
Tear me apart  
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown  
Prison of sleep  
Deepened now  
A rabbit hole never to be found  
Again  
  
Where are you hiding my love  
Cast off like a stone  
Feelings raw and exposed when Im out of control  
Pieces were stolen from me  
But dare I say given away  
Watching the water give in  
As I go down the drain  
I appear missing now  
  
I go missing  
No longer exist  
One day I hope  
Im someone youd met  
  
Shock me awake  
Tear me apart  
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown  
Deeper I sleep  
Further down  
A rabbit hole never to be found  
  
Its only falling in love  
Because you hit the ground  
  
Dancing on wire both ends are on fire  
Cut me loose  
Nowhere to run no more room to pretend  
Wandering along the road in the summer night  
  
I go missing  
No longer exist  
One day I hope  
Im someone youd met  
  
Shock me awake  
Tear me apart  
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown  
Deeper I sleep  
Further down  
A rabbit hole never to be found  
  
Dont cry  
With my toes on the edge its such a lovely view  
Inside  
I never loved anything until I loved you  
Inside  
Im over the edge what can I do  
Inside  
I never loved anything until I loved you  
  
Dont cry  
With my toes on the edge its such a lovely view  
Inside  
I never loved anything until I loved you  
Inside  
Im over the edge what can I do  
Inside  
  
Ive fallen through
