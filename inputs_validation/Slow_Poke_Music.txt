Why know the joint was jumping  
Like a dancing fool  
I saw you standing in the corner  
Looking oh so cool  
I had a word with the DJ  
To make the music hot  
Im gonna get you on the dance floor  
If you are ready or not  
  
Slow poke music  
Ill get you down to the bone  
Slow poke music  
Ill never leave you alone Ill never leave you  
  
When you move it to the left  
Or you shake it to the right  
No matter what you do babe  
Its like dynamite  
With your sweet French perfume  
An that criminal walk  
You know youd melt my ice cream  
With your body talk  
  
Slow poke music  
Ill get you down to the bone  
Slow poke music  
Ill never leave you alone Ill never leave you  
  
Im gonna shake you down  
Girl Im wont do you no harm  
  
Well you move so fine  
Like stepping on glass  
An when you give me that smile  
I see lightning flash  
East an West North an South  
Oh babe youre so hot  
Im gonna melt in your mouth  
  
Slow poke music  
Ill get you down to the bone  
Slow poke music  
Get into it babe  
Slow poke music  
Ill nail it down to the bone  
Slow poke music  
Baby baby baby baby  
Girl Ill never leave you alone
