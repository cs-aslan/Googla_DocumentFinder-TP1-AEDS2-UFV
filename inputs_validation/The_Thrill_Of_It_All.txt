The Thrill of it All  
Inclination of direction walk the turned and twisted rift  
With the children of creation futuristic dreams we sift  
Clutching violently we whisper with a liquefying cry  
Any deadly final answers that are surely doomed to die  
  
Wont you help me Mr Jesus wont you tell me if you can  
When you see this world we live in do you still believe in Man  
If my songs become my freedom and my freedom turns to gold  
Then Ill ask the final question if the answer could be sold  
  
Well thats my story and Im sticking to it  
Cause Ive got no reason to lie yeah  
Forget your problems that dont even exist  
And Ill show you a way to get high oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
So come along you know you matter to me  
Remember freedom is not hard to find yeah  
Time to stop all your messing around  
Dont you think that I know my own mind oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Why cant you believe its not here to perceive  
Do you always have to be told yeah  
For you have been taught that if your mind has been bought  
Lifes entire answer was sold oh yeah  
Oh yeah
