I see lovers passing by  
But no matter how I try  
I cant greet them with a grin  
Cause Im standing  
On the outside lookin in  
  
Friends have told me all along  
Ive been playing my cards all wrong  
But I just cant seem to win  
And Im always  
On the outside lookin in  
  
Oh how it hurts  
To see others enjoy love  
Ive never known  
And Im afraid  
That Ill spend all my night  
In my room all alone  
  
Maybe someday I will find someone  
That I can call mine  
On that day my lifell begin  
And I wont be  
On the outside lookin in
