All the time I try to reason with you  
But I just cant seem to make you understand  
Nothing seems to ever really get through  
Cant you feel emotions like any other man  
  
You never cared for anyone anyone  
You never cared for anyone at all  
Any love that youve ever given me  
You only gave me for your ego  
  
Look at how you wanted all of my tears  
Any time you felt you needed security  
All the nights you let me out on my own  
Thats the thing that you just cant give back to me  
  
You never cared for anyone anyone  
You never cared for anyone at all  
Any love that youve ever given me  
You only gave me for your ego  
  
Youre only plan it seems is look after number one  
You just cant comprehend what it means to love someone  
  
Stay away get lost get out of my life  
Cant you see the changes now and at last Im free  
Any plans I have just dont include you  
And thats the one thing you wont take from me  
  
You never cared for anyone anyone  
You never cared for anyone at all  
Any love that youve ever given me  
You only gave me for your ego  
  
Every time I tried to reason with you  
But it seemed that I never made you understand  
Nothing ever seemed to ever really get through  
Cant you feel emotions like any other man  
  
You never cared for anyone anyone  
You never cared for anyone at all  
Any love that youve ever given me  
You only gave me for your ego
