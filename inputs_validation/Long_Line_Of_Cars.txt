Long Line Of Cars  
  
Theres a long line of cars  
  
And theyre trying to get through  
  
Theres no single explanation  
  
Theres no central destination  
  
But this long line of cars  
  
Is trying to get through  
  
And this long line of cars  
  
Is all because of you  
  
You dont wonder where were going  
  
Or remember where weve been  
  
Weve got to keep this traffic  
  
Flowing and accept a little spin  
  
So this long line of cars  
  
will never have an end  
  
And this long line of cars  
  
Keeps coming around the bend  
  
From the streets of Sacramento  
  
To the freeways of LA  
  
Weve got to keep this fire burning  
  
and accept a little gray  
  
So this long line of cars  
  
Is trying to break free  
  
drawn out words  
  
And this long line of cars  
  
Is all because of me  
  
This long line of cars  
  
Long line of cars  
  
Long line of cars  
  
Long line of cars
