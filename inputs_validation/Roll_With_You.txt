When you feel out of place let me revolve around you  
When your light fades I have the strength to find you  
  
When what youre feeling is too intense  
When the darkness seems to draw you in I roll with you  
When youre so sorry and dont know why  
It came to be a sad time in your life I roll with you well get you through  
  
When you shut your eyes Ill show the images youre missing  
When youve heard enough through me you can listen  
  
When what youre feeling is too intense  
And the darkness seems to draw you in I roll with you  
And when youre crawling through all the hurt  
And you cant find a real friend in this world I roll with you  
Well get you through  
  
When you feel out place  
Let me revolve around you
