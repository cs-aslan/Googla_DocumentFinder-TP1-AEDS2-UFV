Downtown well drown Were in our never splendour  
Flowers showers Whos got the new boy gender  
Ill be your baby Ill be your score  
Ill run the gun for you and so much more  
  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble 4 ya  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble 4 ya  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble 4 ya  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble  
  
Uptown Their sound is like the native you send her  
Junktion funktion The boy with pop is slender  
Did he say maybe Or Im not sure  
Hell be a boy for you but you need more  
  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble 4 ya  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble 4 ya  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble 4 ya  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble  
  
I get a crazy feeling that chases in my head  
Its nothing that you do to me  
Its nothing that you said  
Its love in stereo  
And when I cant let got I say  
  
Ill be your baby  
Ill be your score  
Ill run the gun for you and so much more  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble 4 ya  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble 4 ya  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble 4 ya  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble 4 ya  
  
Downtown well drown Were in our never splendour  
Flowers showers Whos got the new boy gender  
Ill be your baby Ill be your score  
Ill run the gun for you and so much more  
  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble 4 ya  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble 4 ya  
Ill tumble 4 ya Ill tumble 4 ya
