Happy in our make believe

And with the hounds at bay  
Ill call your bluff  
Cause it would be okay  
To walk on tiptoes everyday  
And when I think of you and all the love thats due  
Ill make a promise Ill make a stand  
Cause to these big brown eyes this comes as no surprise  
Weve got the whole wide world in our hands
