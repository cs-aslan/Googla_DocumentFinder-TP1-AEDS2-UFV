When I was just a little young boy  
Papa said Son youll never get far  
Ill tell you the reason if you want to know  
Cause child of mine there isnt really very far to go  
  
Well baby baby wants a gold diamond ring  
Wants it more than most any old thing  
Well when I get those jelly roll blues  
Why Id go and get anything in this world for you  
  
Down to the jewelry store packing a gun  
Says Wrap it up I think Ill take this one  
A thousand dollars please the jewelry man said  
Dupree he said Ill pay this one off to you in lead  
  
Well you know son you just cant figure  
First thing you know youre gonna pull that trigger  
And its no wonder your reason goes bad   
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad  
  
Judge said Son this gonna cost you some time  
Dupree said Judge you know that crossed my mind  
Judge said Fact its gonna cost you your life  
Dupree said Judge you know that seems to me to be about right  
  
Well baby babys gonna lose her sweet man  
Dupree come out with a losing hand  
Babys gonna weep it up for awhile  
Then go on out and find another sweet mans  
Gonna treat her with style  
  
Judge said Son I know your baby well  
But thats a secret I cant never tell  
Dupree said Judge well its well understood  
And you got to admit that that sweet sweet jellys so good  
  
Well you know son you just cant figure  
First thing you know youre gonna pull that trigger  
And its no wonder your reason goes bad  
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad  
  
Same old story and I know its been told  
Some like jelly jelly  some like gold  
Many a mans done a terrible thing  
Just to get baby that shiny diamond ring
