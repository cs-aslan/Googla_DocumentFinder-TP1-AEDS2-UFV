Shes a singer and Im a smoker  
Im dragging it up all my extra store  
She was singing and I was smoking  
Saving butts all I can afford  
Im just smoking up what I got heavy into  
Dragged it up coughed it up  
Sat up wondering where you gone to  
All for your return I drank what wouldnt burn  
And called your name but you never came  
Shes a singer and Im a smoker  
Im dragging it up all my extra store  
She was singing and I was smoking  
Saving butts all I can afford  
Im just sitting up its late its getting rough  
Its two oclock black and white  
Ceilings got no good advice  
All for your return I drank what wouldnt burn  
And called your name but you never came  
Shes a singer and Im a smoker  
Im dragging it up all my extra store  
She was singing and I was smoking  
Saving butts all I can afford
