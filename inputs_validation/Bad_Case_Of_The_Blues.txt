Such a bad case of the blues  
  
I thought that you would be  
A little different when it came to lovin me  
Now I see I was living a dream  
Cause all I do is cry and kiss your love goodbye  
  
Got a bad case of the blues  
Its what I get from lovin you  
Such a bad case of the blues  
Its what I get from lovin you  
  
I thought that I would never see  
How it feels to live a life of misery  
I dont have anything to look forward to  
But miss the love Ive lost and pay the losers cost  
  
Got a bad case of the blues  
Its what I get from lovin you  
Such a bad case of the blues  
Its what I get from lovin you  
  
Now all I do is cry  
And kiss your love goodbye hey  
  
Got a bad case of the blues  
Its what I get from lovin you babe  
Such a bad case of the blues  
Its what I get from lovin you  
  
Got a bad case of the blues  
Its what I get from lovin you  
Such a bad case of the blues  
Its what I get from lovin you yeah  
  
Got a bad case of the blues  
Its what I get from lovin you babe  
Such a bad case of the blues  
Its what I get from lovin you
