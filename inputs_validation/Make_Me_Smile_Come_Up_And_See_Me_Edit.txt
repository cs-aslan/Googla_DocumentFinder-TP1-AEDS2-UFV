Youve done it all  
Youve broken every code  
And pulled the rebel to the floor  
Youve spoilt the game  
No matter what you say  
For only metal what a bore  
Blue eyes blue eyes  
How can you tell so many lies  
Come up and see me make me smile  
Ill do what you want running wild  
Theres nothing left  
All is gone and run away  
Maybe youll tarry for a while  
Its just a test  
A game for us to play  
Win or lose its hard to smile  
Resist resist  
Its from yourself youll have to hide  
Come up and see me to make me smile  
Ill do what you want running wild  
There aint no more  
Youve taken everything  
From my belief in Mother Earth  
Can you ignore my faith in everything  
Cos I know what faith is  
And what its worth  
Away away  
And dont say maybe youll try  
To come up and see me make me smile  
Ill do what you want just running wild  
Repeat to fade
