Hands out stretch what you got  
Give me your best and I wont turn you down  
Cause youre always out to impress  
Youre always out to impress  
Youre always out to impress  
This is the high life nothing dragging us through the thorns  
This is the best time to be young and then reborn  
Live like were gonna die  
Do things weve never done before  
This is the high life the high life  
No we wont say no  
Beautiful people say go go go  
Beautiful people dont stress stress stress  
They never rest  
Beautiful people say yes  
No we wont say no  
Beautiful people say go go go  
Beautiful people dont stress stress stress  
They never rest  
Beautiful people say yes  
Hands out stretch what you got  
Give me your best and I wont turn you down  
Cause youre always out to impress  
Always out to impress  
Always out to impress  
So come come come with me  
Lets push on til the break of dawn  
I love to party  
And when Im with you give me some  
Ive got the view you see  
Ready set go I drop the bomb  
This is the high life  
The high life  
No we wont say no  
Beautiful people say go go go  
Beautiful people dont stress stress stress  
They never rest  
Beautiful people say yes  
No we wont say no  
Beautiful people say go go go  
Beautiful people dont stress stress stress  
They never rest  
Beautiful people say yes
