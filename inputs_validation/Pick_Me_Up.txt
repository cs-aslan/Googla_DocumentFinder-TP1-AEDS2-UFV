Pick me up Oh pick me up  
All you gotta do is just pick me up  
You fall on your bottom  
You cant get up  
Pick me up pick me up  
  
Well I wanna sit down  
I dont wanna stand up  
Ive fallen on my bottom and I cant get up  
Im sayin  
  
When Ive fallen on my bottom  
And I cant get up  
One of my brothers runs over to pick me up  
Im sayin  
  
Chorus  
Pick me up Pick me up Say yo  
Pick me up Pick me up Say yo  
Pick me up Pick me up say yo  
All you gotta do is just  
Pick me up  
I said  
  
Well shes on the tables  
And shes on the chairs  
Man theres babies everywhere  
Im sayin  
  
Shes on the stairs  
And shes in the halls  
Better pick me up or Im gonna fall  
Im sayin  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Well she looks so   
She looks me in the eye  
You better bring me up  
Or Im gonna cry  
Im saying  
  
Repeat Chorus
