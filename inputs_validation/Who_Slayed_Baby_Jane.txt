TELL ME NOW who slayed oh my  
Little Baby Jane  
Rolling down the stairs  
Her Little head has rolled away  
Cause it feels so bizarre  
Put it in my hands  
Can Baby Jane come out to play  
Show me all you got  
You dont wanna know  No you dont  
No you dont wanna know  
Wanna know  
No you dont wanna know   
It wasnt me I know   
No you dont wanna know  
Who slayed Baby Jane I know  
No you dont wanna know  
No you dont wanna know  
No you dont wanna know   
No you dont wanna know  
I wasnt me I know   
Who slayed Baby Jane  
Can I rock your cradle  
Oh I love it when you scream  
Oh I love that fixed and dilated  
Look thats in your eyes  
Than when you were alive  
Ill make you worse and more perverse  
Oh Ill wear her face  
The shed get me off tonight  
No You dont wanna know   
With a big demonic smile  
If only she could scream  
No You dont wanna know  
No You dont wanna know   
No You dont wanna know  
No You dont wanna know  
I wasnt me I know   
Who slayed Baby Jane I know   
No You dont wanna know  
No You dont wanna know   
I wasnt me I know   
No You dont wanna know  
No You dont wanna know  
Who slayed Baby Jane  
Can I rock your cradle  
Oh Ill love it when you scream  
Who slayed Baby Jane  
Goodbye Baby Jane  
Shes all right its alright oh my Janie  
No it aint so strange  
You got no pain Baby Jane  
So goodbye goodbye oh my baby
