I know she says she wants me  
I hear it every day  
And I know she know it keeps me  
Well there aint no other way  
But shes got a heart must be made of stone  
Cause when I tell her that shell miss me when Im gone  
  
She says  
Who said I would  
She knows it aint easy for a simple boy like me  
She fills me full of loving  
Oh then she sets me free  
But shes got a heart must be made of stone  
Cause when I tell her that shell miss me when Im gone  
  
She says  
Who said I would tell me who said I would  
Who said I would who said I would  
  
Im not the only one but I do fine  
I suit her purpose and Im just her kind  
I dont own her and I never could  
Dont think I do dont think I should  
  
Tell me  
Who said I would who said I would  
  
But shes got a heart must be made of stone  
And when I tell her that shell miss me when Im gone  
  
Youre not the only one but you do fine  
You suit my purpose and youre just my kind  
I dont own me and you never could  
Dont think you do dont think you should  
  
Who said I would who said I would  
Now she knows when she calls me  
Ill come running every time  
And she knows she gets me hot  
But she dont know its her body never mine  
  
And shes got a heart must be made of stone  
Cause when I tell her that shell miss me when Im gone  
She says  
Who said I would tell me who said I would  
Who said I would who said I would
