Love me love me love me love me  
Say you do  
Let me fly away with you  
For my love is like the wind  
And wild is the wind  
  
Give me more than one caress  
Satisfy this hungriness  
Let the wind blow through your heart  
Oh wild is the wind  
  
You touch me  
I hear the sound of mandolins  
You kiss me  
With your kiss my life begins  
Youre spring to me  
All things to me  
Youre life itself  
  
Like the leaf  
Clings to the tree  
Oh my darling cling to me  
For were like creatures of the wind  
And wild is the wind
