All you slingers and fiends  
Hide behind your rocks  
Put down your guard  
Im not here to box  
This is no showdown  
So throw down your guns  
You see it doesnt matter  
Where you come from  
You could be from park ave  
Or from a park bench  
You could be a politician  
Or a bitchy princess  
But if youre lookin for a fist  
And youre lookin to unite  
Put your knuckleheads together  
Make a fist and fight  
Not to your death  
And not to your grave  
Im talking about t hat freedom  
Fight like a brave  
  
Fight like a brave  
Dont be a slave  
No one can tell you  
Youve got to be afraid  
  
If youre sickasickntired  
Of being sick and tired  
If youre sick of all the bullshit  
And youre sick of all the lies  
Its better late than never  
To setaset it straight  
You know the lie is dead  
So give your self a break  
Get it through your head  
Get if off your chest  
Get it out your arm  
Because its time to start fresh  
You want to stop dying  
The life you could be livin  
Im here to tell a story  
But Im also here to listen  
No Im not your preacher  
And Im not your physician  
Im just trying to reach you  
Im a rebel with a mission  
  
Fight like a brave  
Dont be a slave  
No one can tell you  
Youve got to be afraid  
  
Fight like a brave  
Dont be a slave  
No one can tell you  
Youve got to be afraid  
  
Im here today to pump up the uplift mofo party plan  
A plan based on a band a band based on a plan  
There should be noin the land of lands  
Its a Hollywood jam  
  
You say youre running and youre running  
And youre running afraid  
You say you ran across the planet  
But you couldnt get away  
The fire in your brain  
Was driving you insane  
You were looking for a day  
In a life that never came  
So dont tell me that  
Ive got to take a number  
Cause Ive been to that doctor  
And believe me thats a bummer  
Heres a one of a kind  
Convention of the mind  
And dont forget to mention  
That it doesnt cost a dime  
Come as you like  
And leave any time  
And one more thing  
You know it doesnt have to rhyme  
  
Fight like a brave  
Dont be a slave  
No one can tell you  
Youve got to be afraid
