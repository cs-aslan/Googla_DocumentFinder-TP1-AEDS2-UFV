The part of love that Im scared of  
is the actual taking off  
I can take a bumpy landing  
But the start must be soft  
soft soft soft  
It must be soft  
  
Some men need your attention  
every minute every hour  
Some women need the proof  
in every chocolate every flower  
Are you asking me down your runway  
Im asking you to be watchtower  
tower tower tower  
to be watchtower  
tower tower tower  
  
  
Some men just like the journey  
dont care if its incomplete  
Some women like a long trip  
Some women short n sweet  
But if we lift each other up  
Lets make it 10000 feet  
feet feet feet  
10000 feet  
feet feet feet  
  
  
The reason Im still down here  
and Ive never taken off  
Is I never had the courage  
To rummage through loves loft  
loft loft loft  
The highest loft  
loft loft loft  
  
  
Cos when were finally up there  
and the engines have been stopped  
the landing wont be fatal  
if loves parachutes been dropped  
dropped dropped dropped  
loves been dropped  
dropped dropped dropp
