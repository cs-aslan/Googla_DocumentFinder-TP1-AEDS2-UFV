Underground Im waiting  
Just below the crowded avenue  
Watchin red lights fading out of view  
  
Oh the air feels heavy  
Everything just passes by  
And I think that Im a little shy  
  
Chorus  
Meet me outside above ground  
I see you on your way  
Ill be with you someday someday  
  
Drawing lines above my head  
But the fan keeps spinning over me  
Just my thoughts to keep me company  
  
Now I know Im ready  
Pour the night into a glass  
Can I sip it slow and make it last  
  
Chorus x2
