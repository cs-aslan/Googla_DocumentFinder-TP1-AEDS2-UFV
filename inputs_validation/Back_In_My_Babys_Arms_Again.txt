Written by D Frazier and A Owens  
The honey bees are gonna be hummin  
Guitar strings are gonna be strummin  
When Im back in my babys arms again  
Happy wheels are gonna be turnin  
Flames of love are gonna be burnin  
When Im back in my babys arms again  
Chorus  
No more tears are gonna be fallin  
I done heard my true love callin  
Open arms are waitin yonder round the bend  
Rivers of honey are gonna be flowin  
Big sweet flowers are gonna be growin  
When Im back in my babys arms again  
The voice of love is gonna be talkin  
Hand in hand were gonna be walkin  
When Im back in my babys arms again  
Big ol swings are gonna be swingin  
Water springs are gonna be springin  
When Im back in my babys arms again  
Repeat Chorus  
Oh honey  
Back in my babys arms again
