I dont want to leave you on the farm  
I dont want to leave you on the farm  
I dont want to go  
Oh just so ya know  
I dont want to leave you on the farm  
  
Days go by and Im still high  
But you know Im thinkin about you  
Corns turned brown leaves fall to the ground  
Its a sound that reminds me of you  
  
I dont want to leave you on the farm  
I dont want to leave you on the farm  
I dont want to go  
Oh just so ya know  
I dont want to leave you on the farm  
  
No telephone to call you at home  
Im alone on the throne  
Go get somethin hey thanks for nothin  
Ill keep truckin and gettin myself stoned  
  
I dont want to leave you on the farm  
I dont want to leave you on the farm  
I dont want to go  
Oh just so ya know  
I dont want to leave you on the farm  
  
Days go by and Im still high  
But you know Im thinkin about you  
Corns turned brown leaves fall to the ground  
Its a sound that sticks like glue
