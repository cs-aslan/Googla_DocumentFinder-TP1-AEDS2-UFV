So were a little bit older now  
Were a little bit tired  
A little bit scared of looking down  
We wipe our weary eyes  
And step into the storm outside  
  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting for you  
  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting for you now  
I dont know where Ill end up tonight  
Perfect pictures fade to black  
When you turn out the lights  
  
And were a little bit lonely now  
We climbed a little too high  
A little too fast  
And we cant come down  
And Ive got two good eyes  
But I still feel so blind sometimes  
  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting for you  
  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting for you now  
I dont know where Ill end up tonight  
Perfect pictures fade to black  
When you turn out the lights  
When you turn out the lights  
  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting for you  
  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting for you  
  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting for you  
  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting  
Ill be waiting for you
