Shes been good to me  
Shes been as kind as a girl can be  
But I get the feeling  
She thinks that certain something is gone  
Its the little things  
Like the words to the songs she sings  
Are a little different  
And I can tell that Im not the one  
  
Its just a matter of time  
Forgotten but not gone  
Im the invisible guy  
Forgotten but not gone  
  
It was my mistake  
cause I gave less than I could take  
And I never noticed  
She wanted something I didnt have  
And my roving eye  
Drove her off to another guy  
Now she doesnt see that  
To keep from crying Ive got to laugh  
  
And its so hard to believe  
When I call her she turns away  
Like she dont see me at all  
And its so hard to believe  
All that water under the bridge  
Dont count for nothing at all  
  
Its the same old line  
Out of sight and youre out of mind  
But I never thought that  
Id see the day when she didnt care  
But the jokes on me  
I came home yesterday to see  
Them in bed together  
And making love like I wasnt there  
  
It was a matter of time  
Forgotten but not gone  
I could have rolled up an died  
Forgotten but not gone  
Im the invisible guy  
Forgotten but not gone
