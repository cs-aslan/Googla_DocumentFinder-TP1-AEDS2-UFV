This is a song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles Were stealing it
back  
When you get to the bottom  
You go back to the top of the slide  
And you stop and you turn  
And you go for a ride  
Then you get to the bottom  
Then you see me again  
  
Do you dont you want me to love you  
Coming down fast Im right here above you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
Aint no lover but you aint no dancer  
  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
  
Do you dont you want me to make you  
Im coming down fast now dont let me break you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
You aint no lover but you aint no dancer  
  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
  
When you get to the bottom  
You go back to the top of the slide  
And you turn and you stop  
And you go for a ride  
Then you get to the bottom  
Then you see me again  
  
Do you dont you want me to love you  
Coming down fast Im right here above you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
Aint no lover but you aint no dancer  
  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelterand again  
  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter
