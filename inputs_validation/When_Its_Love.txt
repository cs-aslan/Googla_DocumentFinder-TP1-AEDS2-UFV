Everybodys lookin for somethin  
Somethin to fill in the holes  
We think a lot but dont talk much about it  
Til things get out of control  
How do I know when its love  
I cant tell you but it lasts forever  
How does it feel when its love  
Its just something you feel together  
When its love  
You look at every face in a crowd  
Some shine and some keep you guessin  
Waiting for someone to come into focus  
Teach you your final love lesson  
How do I know when its love  
I cant tell you but it lasts forever  
How does it feel when its love  
Its just something you feel together  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh when its love  
Oh oh oh oh  
You can feel it yeah  
Oh oh oh oh  
Nothings missing  
Yeah  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Nothings missing  
How do I know when its love  
I cant tell you but it lasts forever  
How does it feel when its love  
I cant tell you but it lasts forever
