Im becoming less defined  
As days go by  
Fading away  
Well you might say  
Im losing focus  
Kinda drifting into the abstract  
In terms of how I see myself  
  
Sometimes  
I think I can see right through myself  
Sometimes  
I think I can see right through myself  
Sometimes  
I can see right through myself  
  
Less concerned  
About fitting into the world  
Your world that is  
cause it doesnt really matter  
Any more  
No it doesnt really matter  
Any more  
None of this really matters  
Any more  
  
Yes I am alone  
But then again I always was  
As far back as I can tell  
I think maybe its because  
Because you were never really real  
To begin with  
  
I just made you up  
To hurt myself  
I just made you up  
To hurt myself  
I just made you up  
To hurt myself  
repeat  
And it worked  
Yes it did  
  
There is no you  
There is only me  
There is no you  
There is only me  
There is no fucking you  
There is only me  
There is no fucking you  
There is only me  
  
Only only only  
  
Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye  
And it turned out to be a scab  
And I had this funny feeling  
Like I just knew its something bad  
  
I just couldnt leave it alone  
I cut off that scab  
It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut  
But I climbed through  
  
Now Im somewhere  
I am not supposed to be  
And I can see things I know  
I really shouldnt see  
  
And now I know why  
Now I know why  
Things arent as pretty  
On the inside  
  
There is no you  
There is only me  
There is no you  
There is only me  
There is no fucking you  
There is only me  
There is no fucking you  
There is only me  
  
Only only only only only only
