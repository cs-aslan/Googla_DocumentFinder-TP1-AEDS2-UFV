I wont cry for you  
When the night grows long  
And I wont lie for you  
Because you done me wrong  
So tell your mama  
I said hello  
And that she raised you  
Too damn slow  
Youre too damn slow  
Too damn slow  
  
Cuz Ive been waiting  
For your time  
And Ive been missing  
Out on mine  
So tell your father  
That I said so long  
And thanks for raising you  
So damn wrong  
Youre so damn wrong  
Youre so damn wrong so damn wrong
