When a days work is done  
And youre down on the ground  
You come home just to find  
That shes not around  
You see red you see red  
When she takes you for a fool  
You see red you see red  
Read the writing on the wall  
What you give is what you get  
When it comes to loving  
If you lie make her cry  
She will leave you alone  
You see red you see red  
When she takes you for a fool  
You see red you see red  
Read the writing on the wall  
So you drink your gin  
And drown your sorrows  
Dont expect a tomorrow  
Wasting away aint now way to say  
That youre sorry for what you have done  
When a days work is done  
And youre down on the ground  
You come home just to find  
That shes not around  
You see red you see red  
When she takes you for a fool  
You see red you see red  
Read the writing on the wall
