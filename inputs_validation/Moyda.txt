Schnine  
Hes a pretty good guy  
Hes nice to his neighbors  
You can count on him to buy your school candy bars  
Hes a real nice guy  
Hes always got the jumper cables  
Hell take your mail in when youre on vacation  
Hes a goodhearted man  
Volunteers at the library  
Hell help you find a book on whales  
Hes a thoughtful man  
Remembers your birthday  
Says God bless you when you sneeze  
  
But theres a problem  
Its not your average problem  
But its a pretty big problem  
His hobby is moyda  
His hobby is moyda  
Hell eat a hamboyga  
Then commit moyda  
  
Hes a friendly guy  
He waves to all the joggers  
Children use his backyard as a shortcut  
Hes a real sweet guy  
He always recycles  
Referees the Junior High basketball for no pay  
Hes a great great man  
Hell sign your petition  
Then proceed to compliment your new haircut  
  
But theres a problem  
Its not your average problem  
But its a pretty big problem  
His hobby is moyda  
His hobby is moyda  
South of the boyda  
Hes wanted for moyda  
  
Here he comes  
Hey Larry how ya doing  
Hows the garden coming  
You know its interesting  
I just read at the library  
That you need to rotate the soil  
To get real plump read tomatoes  
Oh and one more thing  
My hobby is moyda  
Two three four  
Im a sick man  
My hobby is moyda  
My hobby is moyda  
Ill eat a hamboyga  
Then commit moyda  
  
I never loiter  
After committing the doity deed of moyda  
Only Sigmund Freuda  
Knows why I cannot and will not stop committing moyda  
Murder murder murder murder murder
