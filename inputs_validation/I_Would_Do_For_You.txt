I didnt mean to be so late  
Its just that I got talking  
I had a drink with a couple of mates  
Missed my bus and wound up walking  
  
I tried to call and let you know  
It was busy and I couldnt get through  
I didnt want to let you down  
I know how much it hurts you  
  
I dont know what came over me  
It must have slipped my mind  
Ill try and make it up to you  
Lets leave the past behind  
  
I promise that Ill do my best  
To mend my wicked ways  
And dont believe the things you hear  
Dont listen to what they say  
  
Chorus  
I would do for you  
All youd have me do  
All you have to do  
Is ask me to  
All you have to do  
Is tell me when  
And Ill come running back again  
  
If theres something wrong then let me know  
Dont bottle things inside  
Your pretty eyes can melt my heart  
Your sadness they cant hide  
  
Please try and give me one more chance  
To set the record straight  
Meet me here tomorrow night  
And I promise I wont be late  
  
Chorus  
  
I would do for you
