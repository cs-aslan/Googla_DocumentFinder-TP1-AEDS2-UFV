One is for envy and one just for spite  
The cuts in my heart they show me your eyes  
Dont make it better by twisting knife  
Turns all by itself on to someone else  
  
Your selfliberation well leave this behind  
Beyond slings and arrows that rain on our minds  
Youll make it better shaking it off  
It never mattered anyway  
  
Chorus  
If we dont make it alive its a hell of a good day to die  
All our light that shines strong only lasts for so long  
And its ashes to ashes again should we even try to pretend  
All our light that shines strong only lasts for so long  
  
The banner youre waving is burning and red  
Its blocking the sun light that shines overhead  
You against the world diamonds and pearls  
Voices inside you churn watch the city burn  
  
Your own liberation will leave them behind  
All the slings and arrows that rain on your mind  
Dont make it better break it cause  
It never mattered anyway  
  
Chorus  
  
I wont calm down  
  
The banner youre waving is burning and red  
You against the world diamonds and pearls  
It never mattered mattered  
Mattered anyway  
  
Chorus  
  
All our light that shines strong only lasts for so long
