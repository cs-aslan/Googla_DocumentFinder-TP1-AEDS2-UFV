Fat and weak what a disgrace  
Guess the champ got too lazy  
Aint gonna fly now hes just takin up space  
Sold his gloves threw his eggs down the drain  
  
But hes no bum he works down the street  
He bought the neighborhood deli  
Back on his feet now hes choppin up meat  
Come inside maybe youll hear him say  
  
Try the rye or the kaiser theyre our special tonight  
If you want you can have an appetizer  
You might like our salami and the livers all right  
And theyd really go well with the rye or the kaiser  
  
Never eats while on the job  
He heard its good to stay hungry  
But he makes a pretty mean shishkabob  
Have a taste they were made fresh today  
  
Try the rye or the kaiser or the wheat or the white  
Maybe I can suggest an appetizer  
Stay away from the tuna it smells funny tonight  
But you just cant go wrong with the rye or the kaiser  
  
So today his deli comes first  
Still he dreams of his past days of glory  
Goes in the back and beats up on the liverwurst  
All the while you can still hear him say  
  
Its the rye or the kaiser its the thrill of one bite  
Let me please be your catering advisor  
If you want substitutions I wont put up a fight  
You can have your roast beef on the rye or the kaiser  
  
The rye or the kaiser  
The rye or the kaiser  
The rye or the kaiser
