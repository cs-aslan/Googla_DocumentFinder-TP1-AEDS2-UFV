Seven Oclock in the morning and Im riding the overnight train  
Ive got ten tonnes of luggage but I left it behind when I came  
I look at my watch says September seventeen  
Were riding past some place where Ive never been  
And Im waving through the window as we go  
Somebody says Well hey what are you waving at  
Well what have I got to lose  
Somebody might wave back  
  
Seven Oclock in the morning and Im carrying bags under my eyes  
Been awake all night counting the hours to sunrise  
Drawing patterns beating rhythms on the tabletop  
I lift my gaze and my mouth just dropped  
Someone waving in the window at me  
And I say Hey there what are you waving at  
When he says What do I have to lose  
Somebody might wave back  
What do I have to lose  
Somebody might wave back
