Twentyone and strong as I can be  
I know what freedom means to me  
And I cant give the reason why  
I should ever want to die  
Got no cause to be afraid  
Or fear that life will ever fade  
Cause as I watch the rising sun  
I know that we have just begun  
  
I might spend my life upon the road  
Just tryin to add to what I know  
Then someday I might settle down  
And all my friends will be around  
  
They say a man should have a stock and trade  
But me Ill find another way  
I believe in getting what you can  
And there aint no stoppin this young man  
  
Because Im you and fast as I can be  
I know what freedom means to me  
And I cant give the reason why  
I should ever want to die  
No I cant give the reason why  
I should ever want to die
