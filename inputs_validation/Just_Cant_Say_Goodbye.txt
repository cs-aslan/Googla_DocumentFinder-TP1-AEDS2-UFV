Here I stand  
Without an overcoat in January  
Where did I go wrong  
I try to smile  
But my hearts a heavy load to carry  
Baby now youre gone  
  
Maybe theres a way to stop  
The rain before its falling  
Maybe Im a fool to even try  
  
But I cant say goodbye  
How can I walk away  
When my heart wants you to stay  
And I cant tell you why  
I know the feelings gone and I know I should be strong  
But I just cant say goodbye  
  
Here I go  
Running after dreams and chasing rainbows  
Trying to hold on to your heart  
I made it through another lonely night  
Just thinking of you  
I long to be right where you are  
  
Maybe theres a way to stop  
The hands of time from turning  
Maybe it just hurts too much to try  
  
But I cant say goodbye  
How can I walk away  
When my heart wants you to stay  
And I cant tell you why  
I know the feelings gone and I know I should be strong  
But I just cant say goodbye  
  
Maybe theres a way to stop  
The rain before its falling  
Maybe Im a fool to even try  
  
I cant say goodbye  
How can I walk away  
When my heart wants you to stay oh yeah  
And I cant tell you why  
Yes I know the feelings gone and I know I should be strong  
But I just cant say goodbye  
  
No I just cant say goodbye
