I shut and locked the front door  
No way in or out  
I turned and walked the hallways  
And pulled the curtains down  
yeah I knelt and emptied the mouths of every plug around  
But nothings sound  
nothings sound  
  
Id stay where my last step left me  
Ignored all my rounds  
Soon I was seeing visions and cracks along the walls  
They were upside down  
  
I swallow my words to keep from lying  
I swallow my face just to keep from biting  
Yeah I swallowed my breath I went deep  
I was diving I was diving  
Yeah I surfaced and all of my being was enlightened  
  
Repeat x4  
Im in hiding  
  
Its been about three days now  
Since Ive been aground  
im no longer overwhelmed and it seems so simple now  
Yeah its funny how things change so much  
Its all state of mind  
  
I swallow my words to keep from lying  
I swallow my face just to keep from biting  
I I am I swallow my breath I went deep  
I was diving I was diving  
Yeah I surfaced and all of my being was enlightened  
  
Repeat x8  
Now Im in hiding
