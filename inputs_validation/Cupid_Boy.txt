If only you knew  
I shimmer for you  
Oh the very feel of it  
Im hooked on your line  
Under your spell  
Your love is king  
  
You color me gold  
And now that you know  
Baby youve got all of me  
Im hooked on your line  
Youre under my skin  
I need your touch  
  
So why dont you thrill me  
Like you did before  
Why dont you give me  
A little bit more  
Why dont you call me  
Start hittin me up hittin me up hittin me up  
  
Give me your love  
Youve got it all sown up  
And your beats so very  
I could never get enough  
Youve got the good stuff good stuff  
  
Chorus  
Cupid boy when we touch  
Im in heaven in your arms  
Firethe way you love  
Feels like Heaven in your arms  
Sky rocket to Mars  
Straight through to your heart  
Every time we touch  
Im shooting the stars  
Cupid boy when we touch  
Im in Heaven  
  
Im losing my grip  
Letting it slip  
Baby I want all of you  
Youre reeling me in  
Every time I give in  
Im addicted  
  
So why dont you thrill me  
Like you did before  
Why dont you give me  
A little bit more  
Why dont you call me  
Start hittin me up hittin me up hittin me up  
  
Give me your love  
You got it all sown up  
And your beats so very  
I could never get enough baby  
You got the good stuff good stuff  
  
Chorus  
  
Cupid Boy  
Cupid Boy  
Cupid Boy  
Cupid Boy  
  
I could never get enough  
Youve got the good stuff good stuff
