We jumped into a river on the moon  
But the water was too cold  
We tried to buy the morning star  
But it was already sold  
I wanted to make it big with you  
But my plans must have been to bold  
  
And its back down to earth again  
Back in my car and gone  
Back on the road  
Back on the road alone  
  
You were my summer angel  
Youre eyes how they shone  
Just last night we were talking about  
How much our love had grown  
I wanted to prove how good it could be  
But my plans will have to be postponed  
  
Cause its back down to earth again  
Back in my car and gone  
Back on the road  
Back on the road alone
