Thenardier  
What to do What to say  
Shall you carry our treasure away  
What a gem What a pearl  
Beyond rubies is our little girl  
How can we speak of debt  
Lets not haggle for darling Cosette  
Dear Fantine gone to rest  
Have we done for her child what is best  
Shared our bread shared each bone  
Treated her like shes one of our own  
Like our own Monsieur  
  
Valjean  
Your feelings do you credit sir  
And I will ease the parting blow  
  
He pays them  
  
Let us not talk of bargains or bones or greed  
Now may I say we are agreed  
  
Mme Thenardier  
That would quite fit the bill  
If she hadnt so often been ill  
Little dear cost us dear  
Medicines are expensive Msieur  
Not that we begrudged a sou  
Its no more than we Christians must do  
  
M And Mme Thenardier  
One thing more one small doubt  
There are treacherous people about  
No offense please reflect  
Your intentions may not be Correct  
  
Valjean  
No more words heres your price  
Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice  
Come Cosette say goodbye  
Let us seek out some friendlier sky  
Thank you both for Cosette  
It wont take you too long to forget  
  
Valjean and Cosette leave the inn  
  
Come Cosette come my dear  
From now on I will always be here  
Where I go you will be  
  
Cosette  
Will there be children  
And castles to see  
  
Valjean  
Yes Cosette  
Yes its true  
Theres a castle just waiting for you
