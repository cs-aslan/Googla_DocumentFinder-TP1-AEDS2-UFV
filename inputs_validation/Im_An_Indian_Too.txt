Like the Seminole Navajo Kickapoo  
Like those Indians  
Im an Indian too  
A Sioux  
A Sioux  
Just like Battle Axe Hatchet Face Eagle Nose  
Like those Indians  
Im an Indian too  
A Sioux  
A Sioux  
Some Indian summers day  
Without a sound  
I may hide away  
With Big Chief HoleintheGround  
And Ill have totem poles tomahawks pipes of peace  
Which will go to prove  
Im an Indian too  
A Sioux  
A Sioux  
With my chief in his teepee  
Well raise an Indian family  
And Ill be busy night and day  
Looking like a flour sack  
With two papooses on my back  
And three papooses on the way  
Like the Chippewa Iroquois Omaha  
Like those Indians  
Im an Indian too  
A Sioux  
A Sioux  
Just like Rising Moon Falling Pants Running Nose  
Like those Indians  
Im an Indian too  
A Sioux  
A Sioux  
Some Indian summers day  
Without a care  
I may run away  
With Big Chief SonofaBear  
And Ill wear moccasins wampum beads feather hats  
Which will go to prove  
Im an Indian too  
A Sioux  
A Sioux
