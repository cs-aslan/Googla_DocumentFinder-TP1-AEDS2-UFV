Hey there Mr Taxi Driver  
Take me to the station  
Ive been around for too long  
  
You said I lack understanding  
That I dont know right from wrong  
But oh no  
  
Theres a road that a man has to take  
Theres a road and its filled with my mistakes  
Ooh baby Dont misunderstand me  
  
How long will it take  
How long can you wait  
Tell me how long  
When we are living in a world  
Of loves imagination  
  
Senorita plays for the people who bother  
Outside those old department stores  
Shes singing out loud for no reason  
About a traveling man shes been hanging around  
But oh no  
  
Theres a road that a man has to take  
Theres a road and its filled with my mistakes  
Ooh baby Dont you misunderstand me  
  
How long will it take  
How long can you wait  
Tell me how long  
When we are living in a world  
Of loves imagination  
  
So I should beg for some forgiveness  
Borrowed time  
Cause someone else can wait that long again  
If only youll be leavin  
Tell me just  
How long
