Dont stand around like friends at a funeral  
Eyes to the ground  
It couldve been you  
Why do you weep for the passing of ages  
You slip with the back of your hand  
Youre taking it out on the one you love  
I couldnt believe it  
  
Chorus  
But we might still survive  
And rise up through the maze  
If you could change your life  
And never be the same  
  
How long must I wait  
For you to release me  
I pay for each mistake  
While you suffer in silence  
  
I could still have an easy life  
But the lie aint worth the living  
Once more will I hear you say  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont stand around  
Like friends at a funeral  
Eyes to the ground  
Dont suffer in silence  
  
Cause we might still survive  
And rise up through the maze  
If you could change your life  
And never be the same  
  
And every time I hear you  
Never be the same  
And every time I mess up  
Never be the same
