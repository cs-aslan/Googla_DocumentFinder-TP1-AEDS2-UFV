One look at you  
And just look at me  
Held under your spell  
So helplessly  
Yes Im still your fool  
Any fool can see  
One look at you  
And just look at me  
  
I thought Id be over you by now  
But I guess its too soon  
The truth was so plain to see  
Tonight when you walked in the room  
I just couldnt control the tears  
When I saw you again  
My love is still as strong for you  
As its ever been  
  
One look at you  
And just look at me  
Held under your spell  
So helplessly  
Yes Im still your fool  
Any fool can see  
One look at you  
And just look at me  
  
Im still your fool  
Guess Ill always be  
One look at you  
And just look at me
