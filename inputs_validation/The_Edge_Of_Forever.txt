No one can decide  
When lightning will strike  
And everything falls into place  
But lately it seems  
When youre in my dreams  
I find that I dont want to wake  
  
I want to slowly  
Unlock the mystery  
I want to make love  
I want to make history  
  
Chorus  
With you  
I see a lifetime with you  
And if one thing is true  
Its that God knew someday Id be standing  
On the edge of forever with you  
  
Im ready to fall  
To give you my all  
Cause youre everything Ill ever want  
Its amazing to me  
How far we can see  
Our horizon goes on and on  
  
I want to slowly  
Unlock the mystery  
I want to make love  
I want to make history  
  
Chorus  
And when Im shivering  
Your body will be my blanket  
And then Im drifting baby  
Youll be my anchor  
  
Chorus
