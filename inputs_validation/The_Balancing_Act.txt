My angel  
So much Id like to tell you  
So much of what Ive seen  
Id plant behind your eyes  
  
My angel  
I know I cant compel you  
To any of my ways  
As you walk beneath the merciless sky  
  
My angel  
My angel  
The more I see the more I grow  
The less that I seem to know  
Only that  
Life is just a balancing act  
  
The demons  
The fear that will confine you  
The fire that will burn  
Your innocence away  
  
The heartbreak  
The pain will seek and find you  
The loneliness will grow  
With each passing day  
  
My angel  
My angel  
I wont always be there to dry  
The tears that gently fill your eyes  
So will you remember that  
Life is just a balancing act  
  
My angel  
My angel  
The more I see the more I grow  
The less that I seem to know  
Only that  
Life is just a balancing act  
Only that  
Life is just a balancing act
