You fool no one waiting to see if Im gone  
So hard to see you are taking your chances with me  
If I find you with some other man  
You know what Im gonna do  
Better run if you see me comin ah  
  
Soon you will fall making mistakes like before  
When you tell me lies I can see by the look in your eyes  
If you think youre gonna take me for granted  
Chasin round with all you see  
Gonna make you live to regret it ah  
  
You fool no one waiting to see if Im gone  
So clear to see youve had all your chances with me  
You thought that you could take me for granted  
But I couldnt take it no more  
Better run when you see me comin ah
