I live my life in the city  
Theres no easy way out  
The days moving just too fast for me  
I need some time in the sunshine  
I gotta slow it right down  
The days moving just too fast for me  
  
I live my life for the stars that shine  
People say its just a waste of time  
Then they say I should feed my head  
That to me was just a day in bed  
Ill take my car and drive real far  
Theyre not concerned about the way we are  
In my mind my dreams are real  
Now were concerned about the way I feel  
  
Tonight Im a rock n roll star  
Tonight Im a rock n roll star
