Lies and reason you give  
Too much is not enough  
Leave what you see leave alone  
Someone else to go  
  
Romance holds you to tea yeah  
Sip it like youre typical  
My love is what you make of it  
Brothers and sisters its not enough  
Not enough  
  
Talk call talking of leading the way  
Wont ya give any lie  
Of all the ways  
Wont ya lie with me  
  
Man Ive no Raven to see here  
Flies the blackest way  
What you give when you get nothing  
Is everything you give  
  
All been tossed away  
Read light your morning candles  
Make your way  
All wise men today grieve  
It knows no better thing  
  
All I leave here a way to send you all down down down  
All my worries is where the girl will be found found found  
All my worries of all those things that I dreamed and dreamed and dreamed  
All I leave is I have to say  
Its nothing more than my point of view  
  
Its hard and cold tonight  
Youre warming by a fire  
Oh sweet juice  
Drink tonight  
Take me while Im out  
  
No no Raven to see here  
It imitates beauty well  
Black bird from a dark Heaven  
Oh wont you keep living a lie  
  
All God tossed away  
Read while you know  
You know things fade to grey  
Oh what came of grace  
Oh the morning and the rain  
  
All my worries warn enough to roam roam roam  
Fade away here the girl will go round and round and round  
Hey love  
What was the greatest thing you  
Moments in the cold rain  
Here to say theres nothing great that you wouldnt do  
  
Fly Raven  
Wont you guide me  
Oh whats the reason  
Wont you guide me  
Wait now what is the Raven  
Wont you come to me  
What you did with the same grace at all  
Wont you keep living a lie  
  
All been tossed away  
Read all youll have ever known  
I believe  
All I know today  
Read all to believe
