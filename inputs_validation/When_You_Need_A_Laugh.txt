You cant imagine how it hurts me  
To have you treat me like you do  
Knowing that my love is just a joke to you  
But Ill take it just to see you  
And laugh as teardrops fall  
So when you need a laugh give me a call  
  
Everybody says Im crazy  
To let you treat me this way  
But I cant explain so what else can I say  
At least Im on your mind when youre laughin  
Somehow that breaks the fall  
So when you need a laugh give me a call  
  
Id gladly trade the laugh you get  
For making fun of me  
To be around the one I love and need so desperately  
So even if the laughs on me  
I dont mind at all  
So when you need a laugh give me a call  
So when you need a laugh give me a call
