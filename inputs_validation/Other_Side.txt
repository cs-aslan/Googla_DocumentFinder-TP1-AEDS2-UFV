Its not the same without you up here  
Cant find my wheels  
Your absence is what breeds this fear  
Warm breath and all it steals  
  
You cant know how it feels to be in here  
All the dark horse fields befriendin me  
Playin aint the same without you here  
Weve come to hate the golden rule  
  
Cannot seem to make the dots connect  
The morning light dont show you near  
You cant know what its like to bleed from here  
The blackened world grows white it goes nowhere  
  
Oooh hoo  
Death aint the same without you dear  
I make the others run and hide  
New York streets seem to make it worse  
  
All this noise inside the quiet  
I cant hold on the weight you bear  
My bodys broken fast please lift me up  
You cant know what its like to be inside  
  
The fading melodies cant beat my need  
Im not the same without you here  
How can I quit to be there  
Sit and stare  
  
Stare  
Begging for a prayer
