Take a walk down memory lane with me  
Past a watermelon stand on the way  
Thinking I had everything wed need  
On Marthas foolish ginger  
You were late  
How could I forget what you said  
The part about that  
Love taking over your life  
Was not your plan  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
  
Through the cliffs  
Out of the bay I went  
From the starboard side  
I could black my visions and my passions  
They keep me awake  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
  
A familiar voice  
Hi Surprise  
Ive been searching trying to find you  
I couldnt speak  
My hands reached for Marthas foolish ginger  
We talked until the moon came up  
About how life without love  
Isnt worth very much  
Then I played this song  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
What I would have done  
What I would have done  
  
Memories that we have yet you said  
To make like our Burning Bed  
Love dont mistake that it wasnt safe  
On Marthas foolish ginger
