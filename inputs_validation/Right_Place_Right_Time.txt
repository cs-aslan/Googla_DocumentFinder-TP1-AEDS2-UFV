We got our eyes wide open and feeling like we are almost there  
Words unspoken disappearing in the air  
All I see is you and I  
Youre the only lifeline that I need tonight  
Im letting go  
  
So this is what it feels like  
Be in at the right place the right time  
Im bringing off a delight  
Hoping we can make this a long night  
This is why we came yeah I can feel it in my veins hey yeah  
So this is what it feels like  
Right place the right time  
  
Loud explosions only you and I can hear  
Doors fly open youre the cure for all my fears  
All I see is you and I  
Youre the only lifeline that I need tonight  
Im letting go  
  
So this is what it feels like  
Be in at the right place the right time  
Im hanging off a delight  
Hoping we can make this a long night  
This is why we came yeah I can feel it in my veins  
So this is what it feels like  
Right place the right time with you  
Right place the right time with you  
Right place the right time  
  
Right here and now feels like forever  
Never touch the ground when were together  
Right here and now feels like forever forever forever forever  
  
So this is what it feels like  
Be in at the right place the right time  
Im hanging of a delight  
Hoping we can make this a long night  
Right place the right time  
Right place the right time  
  
Right here and now feels like forever  
Never touch the ground when we are together  
  
Right here and now feels like forever  
Right place the right time
