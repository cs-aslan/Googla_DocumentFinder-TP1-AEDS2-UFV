She gave away all her love  
No reason to keep it  
Shed saved it for only one  
But he didnt need it  
And downtown the midnight circus  
Hypnotised like a spinning top  
Offering dreams like the gloss magazines  
She had so much to give so she gave it away  
  
And all of the loves youve known  
There must have been someone  
Who gave you that starry night  
And whose gonna point the finger  
Only those who never known  
She lost and she cried the tears run dry  
She had so much to give so she gave it away  
  
Mary was like you and I  
She remembers how she lay with him  
But to the world shes just a drunken cheap trick  
Red light side kick an angel downtown  
  
The priest calls her Wednesdays  
And shows her a wooden cross  
He tells of the love hes found  
She thinks of the one she lost  
And downtown the midnight circus  
Hypnotised like a spinning top  
So easy to choose when theres nothing to lose  
She had so much to give so she gave it away
