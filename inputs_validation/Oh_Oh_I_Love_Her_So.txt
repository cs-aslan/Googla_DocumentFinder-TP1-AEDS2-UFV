I met her at the Burger King we fell in love by the soda machine  
So we took the car downtown the kids were hanging out all around  
Then we went down to Coney Island on the coaster and around again  
And no ones gonna ever tear us apart cause shes my sweetheart  
All right oh yeah  
  
Oh oh I love her so  
Oh oh I love her so  
Oh oh I love her so  
  
Oh oh I love her so  
Oh oh I love her so  
Oh oh I love her so  
  
Hanging out on a night like this Im gonna give her a great big kiss  
Im gonna make her mine and everythings gonna be real fine
