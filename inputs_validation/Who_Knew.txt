Verse 1  
You took my hand you showed me how  
You promised me youd be around  
Uh huh thats right  
I took your words and I believed  
In everything you said to me  
Yeah huh thats right  
  
Chorus  
If someone said three years from now  
Youd be long gone  
Id stand up and punch them out  
Cause theyre all wrong  
I know better  
Cause you said forever and ever  
Who knew  
  
Verse 2  
Remember when we were such fools  
And so convinced and just too cool  
Oh no no no  
I wish I could touch you again  
I wish I could still call you a friend  
Id give anything  
  
Chorus  
When someone said count your blessings now  
For theyre long gone  
I guess I just didnt know how  
I was all wrong  
They knew better  
Still you said forever and ever  
Who knew  
  
Bridge  
Yeah yeah  
Ill keep you locked in my head  
Until we meet again  
Until we until we meet again  
And I wont forget you my friend  
What happened  
  
Chorus  
If someone said three years from now  
Youd be long gone  
Id stand up and punch them out  
Cause theyre all wrong and  
And that last kiss Ill cherish  
Until we meet again  
And time makes it harder  
I wish I could remember  
But I keep your memory  
You visit me in my sleep  
My darling  
Who knew  
  
Outro  
My darling my darling  
Who knew  
My darling I miss you  
My Darling  
Who knew  
Who knew
