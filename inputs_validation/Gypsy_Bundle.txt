This huddlin in my coat this gypsy bundle  
In Liverpool in squalor cast adrift  
A dirty ragged mess of desperation  
Though devil touched I took as Gods gift  
No history no owner no rhyme no reason  
Nor explanation of his sorry state  
And all the fire of the survivor  
I couldnt leave it I couldnt leave it to its fate  
What are we to do with it  
Dirty ragged coloured breed  
Welcome it with open arms  
Welcome one more mouth to feed  
Could your own blood not provide you  
With the gratitude you need  
We will call the boy Heathcliff  
And every man on earth conceals a secret  
On which he feeds and yet tears him apart  
And in this child so great that complication  
Will surely destroy the strongest heart  
And as you fall into the traps he sets you  
And as youre drawn to cross his reckless line  
And as I watch you peer into his darkness  
I pray youll never search I pray youll never search for mine  
What are we to do with it  
Dirty ragged coloured breed  
Welcome it with open arms  
Welcome one more mouth to feed  
Could your own blood not provide you  
With the gratitude you need  
Gonna call him Heathcliff  
What are we to do with it  
Dirty ragged coloured breed  
Welcome it with open arms  
Welcome one more mouth to feed  
Call him Heathcliff  
What are we to do with it  
Dirty ragged coloured breed  
Welcome it with open arms  
Welcome one more mouth to feed
