Have you ever passed the corner of Forth and Grand  
Where a little ball o rhythm has a shoeshine stand  
People gather round and they clap their hands  
Hes a great big bundle o joy  
He pops the boogie woogie rag  
The Chattanoogie shoeshine boy  
He charges you a nickel just to shine one shoe  
He makes the oldest kind o leather look like new  
You feel as though you want to dance when he gets through  
Hes a great big bundle o joy he pops the boogie woogie rag  
The Chattanoogie shoeshine boy  
Its a wonder that the rag dont tear the way he makes it pop  
You ought to see him fan the air  
With his hoppityhippityhippityhoppityhoppityhippityhop  
He opens up for business when the clock strikes nine  
He likes to get up early when theyre feelin fine  
Everybody gets a little rise n shine with the great big bundle o joy  
He pops the boogie woogie rag the Chattanoogie shoeshine boy  
instrumental break  
Its a wonder that the rag dont tear the way he makes it pop  
Just listen to him fan the air here he goes  
He opens up for business when the clock strikes nine  
He likes to get up early when theyre feelin fine  
Everybody gets a little rise n shine with the great big bundle o joy  
He pops the boogie woogie rag the Chattanoogie shoeshine boy  
The Chattanoogie shoeshine boy
