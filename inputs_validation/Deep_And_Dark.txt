Down I am down  
On the ground sad and tired  
Im down its over now  
Yes Im down should I like it  
  
Its deep and dark  
Deep down in my heart  
Its deep and dark  
Since weve been apart  
  
Ls this love that comes around  
That takes me up light years higher  
Cause I want to feel love once again  
  
Its deep and dark  
Deep down in my heart  
Its deep and dark  
Since weve been apart  
  
Its deep and dark  
Deep down in my heart  
Its deep and dark  
Without someones love
