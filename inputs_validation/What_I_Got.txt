Early in the morning risin to the street  
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet  
Got to find a reason a reason things went wrong  
Got to find a reason why my moneys all gone  
I got a dalmatian and I can still get high  
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot  
  
Well life is too short so love the one you got  
Cause you might get run over or you might get shot  
Never start static I just get it off my chest  
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest  
Take a small example take a tip from me  
Take all of your money give it all to charity  
  
Love is what I got  
Within my reach  
And the Sublime styles still straight from Long Beach  
It all comes back to you youll finally get what you deserve  
Try and test that youre bound to get served  
  
Loves what I got  
Dont start a riot  
Youll feel it when the dance gets hot  
  
Lovin is what I got I said remember that  
Lovin is what I got I said remember that  
  
Thats why I dont cry when my dog runs away  
I dont get angry at the bills I have to pay  
I dont get angry when my Mom smokes pot  
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock  
Fuckin and fightin its all the same  
Livin with Louie dogs the only way to stay sane  
Let the lovin let the lovin come back to me  
  
Lovin is what I got I said remember that  
Lovin is what I got I said remember that  
  
Lovin is what I got I said remember that  
Lovin is what I got I said remember that  
  
Lovin is what I got I said remember that  
Lovin is what I got I said remember that  
  
Lovin is what I got I said remember that  
Lovin is what I got I got I got I got I got
