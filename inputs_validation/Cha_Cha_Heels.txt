Im all dressed up and ready to fall in love  
Are you ready heels Stop stomping  
  
Here I am looking for crime Im looking for some action  
What I have a million times will give you satisfaction  
So dont you mess around with me you wont know what to do  
Cause Ill put on my cha cha heels and walk all over you  
  
Chorus  
Gimme gimme cha cha heels  
All I want is cha cha heels  
Gimme gimme cha cha heels  
If I dont get my cha cha heels  
Ill walk all over you  
  
Dressed up just for trouble to do what must be done  
Im gonna burst your bubble the fun has just begun  
So dont you mess around with me you wont know what to do  
Cause Ill put on my cha cha heels and walk all over you  
  
chorus  
  
Im all dressed up and ready to fall in love  
Im all dressed up Gimme Gimme Gimme  
  
Going back to Boise Im itching for a fight  
Im looking for a lover who loves my dynamite  
So dont you mess around with me you wont know what to do  
Cause Ill put on my cha cha heels and walk all over you  
  
chorus  
  
Are you ready heels Stop stomping
