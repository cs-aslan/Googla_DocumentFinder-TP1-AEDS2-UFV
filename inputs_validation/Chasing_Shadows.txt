Safe in the shadows  
Deep in the night  
I know youre near  
But youre nowhere in sight  
Safe from the darkness  
Down in the streets  
I hear your footsteps  
I hear your heartbeat  
Oh I can hear your heartbeat  
On the street corner  
Away from the light  
I know youre near  
But youre nowhere in sight  
Over my shoulder  
I feel youre near  
I feel you moving  
But you never appear  
Chasing shadows  
Chasing something I cant see  
Chasing shadows  
Will I ever be free  
Chasing shadows  
Into the darkness from the light  
Chasing shadows  
Im just a victim of the night  
The night  
Cloaked in darkness  
You play at your game  
I hear you breathing  
Call out your name  
Closer closer I feel you so near  
Youre just a shadow  
But you never appear  
Chasing shadows  
Chasing something I cant see  
Chasing shadows  
Will I ever be free  
Chasing shadows  
Into the darkness from the light  
Chasing shadows  
Another victim of the night  
The night  
Shadows in the night  
Safe from the darkness  
Deep in the night  
I know youre here  
Youre nowhere in sight  
Over my shoulder  
I know you are near  
I feel you moving  
Will you ever appear  
Im chasing something I cant see  
Will I ever be free  
Shadows in the night
