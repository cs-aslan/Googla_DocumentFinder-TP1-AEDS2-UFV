All You Died For Me To Be  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
Ive had trials and Ive had doubts  
Ive felt your presence  
And walked it out  
Every step of my life  
Youve been here with me  
And as we walk together  
Down a road I cannot see  
Chorus  
I want to live  
All you died for me to be  
I want to walk  
In all you bought on the Tree  
Cause you suffered so much pain  
You didnt suffer that pain in vain  
Cause I want to live  
All you died for me to be  
Now this road isnt easy  
You know its true  
When they laugh at me I know  
They laughed at you  
And when they say Ive gone too far  
Im not the way I used to be  
I ask myself this question  
Did you go too far for me  
I want to live  
All you died for me to be  
I want to walk  
In all you bought on the Tree  
Cause you suffered so much pain  
You didnt suffer it in vain  
Cause I want to live  
All you died for me to be  
Help me take my eyes off my problems  
And take a look at what you faced  
When they raised that hammer high  
And they held those nails in place  
When I see Calvary its all different  
When I see Calvary its all changed  
And I know I can overcome  
Just because you overcame  
Chorus  
I want to live  
All you died for me to be  
I want to live  
All you died for me to be
