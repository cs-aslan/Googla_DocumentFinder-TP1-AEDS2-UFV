CHORUS  
TIME TIME FOR YOU TA DIE  
AS I KISSYOASSGOODNIGHT  
  
I make yo mouthpiece obese like De laRese  
When I release you loose teeth like Little Cease  
Nigga please  
Blood floods yo dungarees  
And thats just a half of my warpath  
Laugh now cry later I rhyme greater  
Than the average playa hater and spectators  
Buy my CD twice  
They see me in the streets they be like yo he nice  
But thats on the low doe  
Be the cats wit no dough tried ta play me at my show  
I pull out 44s and go up in they clothes  
Shortchange niggas  
Snortcane niggas  
Extortion came quicker  
Bought the Range nigga  
Ya still tickle me  
I used ta be as strong as ripple till Little Cease crippled me  
Now I play hardlike my girls nipples be  
The games sour like like a pickle be  
Yall know da rules  
Move from BK ta New Jerus  
Thinkin bout all the planes we flew  
Bitches we ran through  
Now da years new  
I lay my game flat  
I want my spot back take two  
Muthafuckas mad cause I blew niggas envious  
Too many niggas on my dick shits strenuous  
When my men bust you just move wit such stamina  
Slugs missed ya  
I aint mad atchya we aint mad atchya  
Blood rushin concussions aint nothing  
Catch canes come out frontin  
Smokin something  
Sippin White Russians bitch in the Benz bumpin  
I laced it wit the basic  
6 TVs a system knockin Mase shit face it  
We hard ta hit  
Guard ya shit for I stick you for ya reup  
Wipe the P  
Mix shots work ya seat up  
Go in the ashtray spark the weed up  
LONG KISS  
  
CHORUS X 2  
UHI flamin gats aimin at these fuckin  
Maniacs put my name in rapssupport them  
Games dat  
Like they hustle backwards  
I smoke backwards and Duchees  
Ya cant touch me  
Try ta rush me  
Slugs go touchytouchy  
Ya bleedin lovely witchyo spirit above me  
Or beneath me ya whole life ya live sneaky  
Now ya rest eternally sleepy ya burn when ya creep me  
Rest where the wormsnthe weak be  
My nine flies baptize rap guys  
Wit the holy ghost  
I put holes in most you hold ya toast shakey  
Slipntryin ta break me  
Look whatchyou made me do brains blue  
My team in the Marine blew sixcoupe  
Skiid it out weeded out clean it out  
The block for distance is given long kisses bitch  
  
CHORUS X 2  
Frank White the menacin crawcraws demenacin  
I got the lettuce in  
You turn green like cucumber skin got the new hummer in the summer when I was  
A new comer  
Then  
Drugs and mac10s  
Hug from fake friends  
Make ends they hatechyou be broke girls wont datechyou  
Thats why I relate to choke yo ass till ya face blue make you  
Open the safe too  
No matter how ya call ithow ya call it  
This bralickalcoholic  
Like his weed greend out like his brick solid  
Distribute to kids who take heart like Valentine drink Valentine all the  
Time  
Slugs hitchya chest tap the spine  
Flatline  
Heard through the grapevine ya got fucked foe times  
Damn that three ta nine fucked you up for real doe  
Slink steal slow  
As you remorse we feel no  
  
CHORUS X 6
