When your soul finds the soul it was waiting for  
When someone walks into your heart through an open door  
When your hand finds the hand it was meant to hold  
Dont let go  
Someone comes into your world  
Suddenly your world has changed forever  
  
No theres no one elses eyes  
That could see into me  
No one elses arms can lift  
Lift me up so high  
Your love lifts me out of time  
And you know my heart by heart  
  
When youre one with the one you were meant to be find  
Everything falls in place all the stars align  
When youre touched by the cloud that has touched your soul  
Dont let go  
Someone comes into your life  
Its like theyve been in your life forever  
  
No theres no one elses eyes  
That could see into me  
No one elses arms can lift  
Lift me up so high  
Your love lifts me out of time  
And you know my heart by heart  
  
So now weve found our way to find each other  
So now I found my way to you  
  
No theres no one elses eyes  
That could see into me  
  
No theres no one elses eyes  
That could see into me  
No one elses arms can lift  
Lift me up so high  
Your love lifts me out of time  
And you know my heart by heart  
  
And you know my heart by heart  
  
And you know my heart by heart  
  
And you know my heart by heart
