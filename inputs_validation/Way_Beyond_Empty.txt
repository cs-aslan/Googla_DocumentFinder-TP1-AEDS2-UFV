If I could I surely would  
Child ease your pain  
But if I could no longer  
Would you still know my name  
  
If I couldnt drain the tears  
That pour from these eyes  
Would you turn your back on me  
Would you wave goodbye  
  
Chorus  
Or leave me way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my last day to arive  
Way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my end to arrive  
  
If I could be the shoulder  
Which your head would rest upon  
Would you still be waiting mama  
Or would you be gone  
If I couldnt keep the smile  
Forever on your face  
Would I still be around  
Or would I be replaced  
  
Yeah  
Way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my last day to arive yeah  
Way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my end to arrive  
  
Oho  
Ohooo  
Ohooo  
  
And Would you promise me  
Things theyd never change  
Could you promise me  
That things theyd stay the same  
  
If I couldnt clear the clouds  
From over your head  
Would you keep your word to me  
Amongst all the things you said  
  
Or leave me way beyond empty inside  
Awaiting my last day to arive yeah  
Way beyond empty inside  
ohoo  
Awaiting my end to arrive  
Oh yeah child
