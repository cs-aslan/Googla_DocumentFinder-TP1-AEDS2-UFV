Moving out to California Ive been living in Missouri too long  
When the sun sets tomorrow your soul rocking lovell be gone  
And I really doubt that Ill be back because Im taking everything that I own  
  
Bright lights big city I am ready ready ready for you  
Byebye Alma Mater Ive got to see what I can do  
Just tell the folks back home Im on a soul rocking rendezvous  
  
No more yakaty yakaty farewell my best to you  
You know you kept on teasing me just to see what I would do  
Now Ive got a soul rocker baby see if you can get yourself one too  
  
Oh soul rocking baby you know you make my head act up  
Oh send me send me deliver me into your world  
Let me loose let me live let me love a soul rocking girl
