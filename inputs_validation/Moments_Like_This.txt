Moments like this dont last long  
I lock them safe away  
What good is it to say  
Ill get along  
Just like before  
And I wont care  
I wont care anymore  
You called my name  
The music played  
And Im not sure of myself anymore  
  
Im not so sure  
  
Say you gotta know just what youre doin  
And dont you say that I could just be an illusion  
And thats ok its alright baby you the feel  
Love oh baby  
  
After this night is through  
After Im wondering it its you  
  
Oh  
  
Ill get along  
Just like before  
And I dont care  
I wont care anymore  
You called my name  
The music played  
And Im not sure of myself anymore  
Im not so sure  
  
Say you gotta know just what youre doin  
Dont you say that I could just be an illusion  
And thats ok its alright maybe Im the fool  
Love oh baby  
  
After this night is through  
After Im wondering it its you  
  
Ill get along  
Just like before  
Just like before
