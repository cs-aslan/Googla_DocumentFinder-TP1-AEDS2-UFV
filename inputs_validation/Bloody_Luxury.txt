Now when I first met you  
I was rolling along  
Just a bar room crooner  
Singing heartbreak songs  
An I supposed I could never get next to you  
But you seemed quite happy with my company  
You kept my body heat steady at 103  
With your mouth full of gimme  
An your body full of much obliged  
  
Its bloody luxury  
What you mean to me  
Bloody luxury  
What you do to me  
Its bloody luxury  
What you mean to me  
cause no matter what you do to me  
Its bloody luxury  
Bloody luxury  
  
Youre a five star woman  
An you know what to give  
To fill a part time loser  
Full of reasons to live  
But theres no doubt about it  
Im taking a chance on you  
Becos you get my heart beating heavy  
Make my knees go weak  
You get me so damn nervous  
I can hardly speak  
But nothings gonna stop me  
Hanging on my good luck charm  
  
Its bloody luxury  
What you mean to me  
Bloody luxury  
What you do to me  
Its bloody luxury  
What you mean to me  
Cause no matter what you do to me  
Its bloody luxury  
Bloody luxury  
  
Its bloody luxury  
What you mean to me  
Bloody luxury  
Honey what you do to me  
Its bloody luxury  
What you mean to me  
Cause no matter what you do to me  
Its bloody luxury  
  
Bloody luxury  
What you mean to me  
Bloody luxury  
Honey what you do to me  
Its bloody luxury  
What you mean to me  
Cause no matter what you do to me  
No matter what you do to me  
No matter what you do to me  
Its bloody luxury  
Bloody luxury  
  
Bloody luxury
