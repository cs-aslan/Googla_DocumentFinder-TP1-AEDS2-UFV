Hello darlin happy birthday  
Ive decided not to give you a present this year  
In fack I think its about time I took some things away  
Id like to take away this suspicion that I know clouds your world at times  
By giving you some faith to hold on to honey whenever your hand is not in mine  
Happy birthday darlin Ive no presents no fancy cake  
But I hope Ill make you happy with everything I take  
Id like to take away some of your lonely moments by spendin more of mine
with you  
And Id like to take away some of those soso kisses  
And replace them with ones that really say I love you  
And I wanna take away the doubt you sometimes have about my love  
By showin more much more that Ive shown lately  
And then if someone said asked you what Ive got you for your birthday  
Well you can say why he didnt give me anything but he sure took a lotta
things away  
Happy birthday darlin
