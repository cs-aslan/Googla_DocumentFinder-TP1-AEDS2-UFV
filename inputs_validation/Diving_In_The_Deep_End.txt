Why should it be  
Someone like me could make the same mistakes again  
Havent I learned  
People get hurt  
When they go diving in the deep end  
In the deep end  
In the deep end  
In the deep end  
Thought I was smart  
Controlling the art of turning off my intuition  
Havent I seen since I was fourteen  
That life is all just repitition  
You lose or you win  
You sink or you swim  
When you go diving in the deep end  
In the deep end  
In the deep end  
In the deep end  
Now its time to realise  
You dont have to agonise  
You dont have to compromise  
But the one thing you must do  
Is open your eyes  
Your eyes  
Your eyes  
Why should it be  
Someone like me could make the same mistakes again  
Havent I learned  
People get hurt  
When they go diving  
Diving diving fade
