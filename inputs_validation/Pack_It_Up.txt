You guys are the pits of the world  
  
Oh this is no place for me  
Burnin down the interbelt from jacuzzi to jacuzzi  
Its all right for you man  
Gettin smashed gettin suntanned  
But I know my place  
Wheres my suitcase  
  
Pack it up or throw it away  
What I cant carry bury  
Oh you remember me I remember you  
But that was a long long time ago  
When I was passin through  
  
All my family all my friends my lover  
I got to find them  
My enemies my new family my new friends  
My future enemies I got to flush them out  
  
Pack it all up nothing goes in storage  
Im burnin every bridge  
Burn baby burn  
I see your dog got shot  
Well hell never mind  
Thats show biz big boy  
Youve got to be cruel to be kind  
  
Oh give over and admit it  
Ive been tearing down the interstate  
Like some kind of bleeding cat  
Its all right for the boss  
His gains my loss  
That gets me down it really gets me down  
  
So pack it up and cut the crap  
When the clock starts talkin I start walkin  
When you pass in your Porsche  
Please dont offer me a ride  
I may be a skunk  
But youre a piece of junk and furthermore  
I dont like your trousers  
Your appalling taste in women  
And what about your mind  
Your insipid record collection  
That dumb home video center  
The usual pornography  
And all you scumbags around the world  
Youre the pits of the world
