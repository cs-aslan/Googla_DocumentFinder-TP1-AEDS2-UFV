I close the door  
Like so many times so many times before  
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor  
I wanna let you walk away tonight without a word  
  
I try to sleep yeah  
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me  
A thousand more regrets unraveling  
Oh if you were here right now  
I swear Id tell you this  
  
Chorus  
Baby I dont wanna waste another day  
Keepin it inside its killing me  
Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you to you  
I wish that I could find the words to say  
Baby I would tell you every time you leave  
Im inconsolable  
  
I climb the walls yeah  
I can see the edge  
But I cant take the fall no  
Ive memorized the number  
So why cant I make the call  
Maybe cause I know youll always be with me  
In the possibility  
  
Chorus  
  
No no no  
  
I dont wanna be like this  
I just wanna let you know  
That everything I hold in  
Is everything I cant let go oh cant let go  
  
Cause  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont you know it baby  
I dont wanna waste another day  
I wish that I could find the words to say  
Baby I would tell you every time you leave  
Im inconsolable  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Oh Im inconsolable  
Whoa yeah  
Im inconsolable
