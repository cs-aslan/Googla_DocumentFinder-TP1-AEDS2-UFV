Windscreen wipers never gonna stop  
Never stop wiping all the snow from the top of our car  
A car that has traveled so far from our homes  
Its never good to feel alone  
  
But weve got what weve got  
Its friends that weve got in a car  
A car that has traveled so far from our homes  
It never feels good to be alone  
  
Youre in the headlights  
Skidding out into the road  
Like a deer scared and covered in snow  
Oh youre in the headlights  
Skidding out into the road  
Like a deer scared and covered in snow  
  
Flakes they fall on boxes and tins and cans  
The tins and the cans that fall from bins and hands  
And our hands we hold in such a hurry in a world  
  
That doesnt seem to care about  
Themselves or each other  
Or themselves or each other  
Or sisters or mothers  
Or themselves or each other  
Or architects or brothers  
Or themselves or each other  
Or astronauts or fathers  
Or themselves or each other  
Or themselves  
  
So kiss me here beneath the street lights  
In a layby all covered in snow oh  
Yeah kiss me here beneath the street lights  
And oh in a layby all covered in snow for now  
  
You and I weve always been crows  
Hiding black wings beneath the snow  
You and I weve always been crows  
Hiding yellow feet beneath the snow  
  
Youre in the headlights darling oh  
And youre flying out over the road no no  
And youre covered in snow  
And oh youre in the headlights darling now  
Youre flying out over the road  
And youre covered in snow
