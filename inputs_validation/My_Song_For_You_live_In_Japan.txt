Ive been so many places in my life and time  
Ive sung a lot of songs Ive made some bad rhymes  
Ive acted out my life in stages  
With ten thousand people watching  
But were alone and Im singing my song for all of you  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be  
I treated you unkindly but boy cant you see  
Theres noone more important to me  
Baby cant you please see through me  
Cause were alone now and Im singing my song for all of you  
I love you in a place were theres no space or time  
I love you for my life cause youre friends of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singing my song for all of you  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing  
You came out in front I was hiding  
But now Im so much better and if my words dont come together  
Listen to the melody  
Cause my loves in there hiding  
I love you in a place where theres no space or time  
I love you for my life cause youre friends of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singing my song for all of you  
Thank you people  
Thank you people oh yeah  
And you will help me every step of the way  
Yes you will  
And I will sing my song for all of you
