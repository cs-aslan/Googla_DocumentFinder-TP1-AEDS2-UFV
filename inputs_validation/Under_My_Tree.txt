Its that time of year  
Christmas is here  
Everybodys back together again  
Spreading the joy  
Spreading the cheer  
Toasting to another years end  
So thankful for  
All of my friends  
Oh  
  
When the party is over  
The nights just begun  
I promise the best part is  
Yet to come  
Slow dance together  
Two become one  
  
Chorus  
Thats what weve waited all day for  
No one else but me and you  
Nothin I would rather do  
Than hold you all through the night under my tree  
Bring along the mistletoe  
Keep the music nice and low  
Ill show how good it could be  
I wish that Santa could be here to see  
Its beautiful under my tree  
  
The fires aglow  
Weve got Nat King Cole  
Singing us a song from his heart  
Sleigh bells and snow  
Makes us feel close  
To the stars  
When the carols are sung  
And the fire has died  
The embers still burns with the love in our eyes  
Cherish the moment  
Savor the night  
  
Chorus  
  
No one but me  
No one but you  
Sweet rendezvous  
Under my tree  
No one but me  
No one but you  
When the party is over  
The nights just begun  
I promise the best part is  
Yet to come  
Slow dance together  
Two become one  
  
Thats what weve waited all day for  
No one else but me and you  
Nothing I would rather do  
Than hold you all through the night under my tree  
Bring along the mistletoe  
Keep the music nice and low  
Ill show you how good it could be  
I wish that Santa could be here to see  
I wish that Santa could be here to see  
  
No one else but me and you  
Nothin I would rather do  
Than make all your dreams come true  
Under my tree  
Such a cozy rendezvous  
Just relax enjoy the view  
Ill show you how good it could be  
I wish that Santa could be here to see  
Its beautiful beautiful beautiful  
Under my tree  
  
Its that time of year  
Christmas is here  
Christmas is here  
Under my tree  
Its that time of year  
Christmas is here  
Full of love and good cheer
