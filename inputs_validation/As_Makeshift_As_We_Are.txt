You do the combat math Im the war artist  
You cant take your shots back I have to watch them miss  
The basketball rim shook like a tambourine  
Not an unlikely event in a game that means nothing  
In a game that means nothing  
  
Makeshift we are lead never leaves your system no matter who you are  
Makeshift we are as makeshift as we are  
  
Youre a complex dune Im a cloud of octopus ink  
Youre an elusive tune Im more ice sculpture than I think  
Youre the neutral tribe and I got the wrong openness  
Heres where I slowly close my eyes and say Im too drunk for this  
Yeah Im too drunk for this  
  
Makeshift we are Weaklings Make Trouble you played on your guitar  
Makeshift we are as makeshift as we are we are we are we are  
  
The loneliest boys on dolphin property  
Youre as quiet as a fish I only sing for the whole sea  
From memory metal tension springs we were gunsmoke and the truth  
Lets shake some snow off of his shoulders  
Lets shake some snow off of the roof lets shake some snow off of the roof  
  
Makeshift we are occurring to each other under the setups of the stars  
Makeshift we are we imagine us here and here we are  
Makeshift we are through halfsquinted eyes becoming a mirage  
Makeshift we are we are we are
