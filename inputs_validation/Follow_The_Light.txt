Nobody really knows  
Where theyre supposed to go  
Hiding behind a wall  
Afraid that theyll lose it all  
  
But its alright  
Just follow the light  
And dont be afraid of the dark  
In the moonlight  
Youll dance till you fall  
And always be here in my heart  
  
But nobody wants to know  
cos nobody even cares  
Everyones on the make  
Yeah and everyones out for themselves  
  
Me Im on the longest road  
Where everythings overload  
But Ive got my heart and soul  
So dont throw me overboard  
  
cos its alright  
Just follow the light  
And dont be afraid of the dark  
In the moonlight  
Youll dance till you fall  
And always be here in my heart  
  
cos its alright  
Just follow the light  
And dont be afraid of the dark  
In the moonlight  
Youll dance till you fall  
And always be here in my heart  
  
cos its alright alright now  
And youre alright  
Yeah were alright now
