Well if your hands start aclappin  
And your fingers start apoppin  
And your feet start amovin around  
And if you start to swing and sway  
  
When the band starts to play  
A real cool way out sound  
And if you get to cant help it and you cant sit down  
You feel like you gotta move around  
  
You get a shot of rhythm and blues  
With just a little rock and roll on the side  
Just for good measure  
Get a pair of dancin shoes  
  
Well with your lover by your side  
Dont you know youre gonna have a rockin time seemon  
Dont you worry bout a thing  
If you start to dance and sing  
  
And chills come up on you  
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too  
Well heres something for you to do  
  
Get a shot of rhythm and blues  
With just a little rock and roll on the side  
Just for good measure  
Get a pair of dancin shoes  
  
Well with your lover by your side  
Dont you know youre gonna have a rockin time seemon  
Dont you worry bout a thing  
If you start to dance and sing  
  
And chills come up on you  
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too  
Well heres something for you to do  
  
Get a shot of rhythm and blues  
Get a pair of dancin shoes  
Get a shot of rhythm and blues  
Well with your lover by your side  
  
Dont you know youre gonna have a rockin time seemon  
Dont you worry bout a thing  
If you start to dance and sing  
And chills come up on you  
  
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too  
Well heres something for you to do  
Well heres something for you to do  
Well heres something for you to do
