Isnt it strange  
How we move our lives for another day  
Like skipping a beat  
What if a great wave should wash us all away  
Just thinking out loud  
Dont mean to dwell on this dying thing  
But looking at blood  
Its alive right now  
Deep and sweet within  
Pouring through our veins  
Intoxicate moving wine to tears  
Drinking it deep  
Then an evening spent dancing  
Its you and me  
This love will open our world  
From the dark side we can see a glow of something bright  
Theres much more than we see here  
Dont burn the day away  
Is this not enough  
This blessed sip of life  
Is it not enough  
Staring down at the ground  
Oh then complain and pray more from above  
Greedy little pig  
Stop just watch your world trickle away  
Oh its your problem now  
Itll all be dead and gone in a few short years  
Just love will open our eyes  
Just love will put the hope in our minds  
Much more than we could ever know  
Dont burn the day away  
Come sister my brother  
Shake up your bones shake up your feet  
Im saying open up  
And let the rain come pouring in  
Wash out this tired notion  
That the best is yet to come  
But while youre dancing on the ground  
Dont think of when youre gone  
Love love what more is there  
We need the light of love in here  
Dont beat your head  
Dry your eyes  
Let the love in there  
There are bad times  
But thats ok  
Just look for love in it  
Dont burn the day away  
Look  
Here are we  
On this starry night staring into space  
And I must say  
I feel as small as dust  
Lying down here  
What point could there be troubling  
Head down wondering what will become of me  
Why concern we cannot see  
But no reason to abandon it  
Time is short but thats all right  
Maybe Ill go in the middle of the night  
Take your hands from your eyes my love  
Everything must end some time  
Dont burn the day away  
Come sister my brother  
Shake up your bones shake up your feet  
Im saying open up  
And let the rain come flooding in  
Wash out this tired notion  
That the best is yet to come  
But while youre dancing on the ground  
Dont think of when youre gone  
Love love what more is there  
We need the light of love in here  
Dont beat your head  
Dry your eyes  
Let the love in there  
There are bad times  
But thats ok  
Just look for love in it
