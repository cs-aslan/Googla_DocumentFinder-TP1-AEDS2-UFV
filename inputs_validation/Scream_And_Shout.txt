Yeah  
All right  
Oh yeah  
  
Oh come on boys  
  
Your lights sheen nothing like sparkles  
You look like youre toast  
Put you hands up in the air  
Treat me like a host  
  
I wonder if youre ready  
But I cant hear you breathe  
My nerves are not quite steady  
But you will only see that  
  
I want more  
I want more  
So give it all  
Give it all  
  
Scream  
Scream and shout  
Lose your minds  
Let it out  
Take me higher  
Higher  
Higher  
Scream and shout  
  
Coats are smaller in this asylum  
I can see whats on your minds  
Looking for some truth  
Is what you really want to find  
  
Cause we are pure escapists  
Yes times are getting tough  
We just want to rock and roll  
We cant get enough  
  
I want more  
I want more  
So give it all  
Give it all  
  
Scream  
Scream and shout  
Lose your minds  
Let it out  
Take me higher  
Higher  
Higher  
Scream and shout  
  
Hahahahahaha  
  
You see that from the front row  
We are shapes of things to come  
Youre handcuffed to your seat  
And there is no place left to run  
  
Your brains are in our power  
We ponder as we feed  
A healthy dose of metal  
And thats all youll ever need  
  
I want more  
I want more  
So give it all  
Give it all  
Shout to the car  
Shout to the car  
I want it all yeah  
  
Scream  
Scream and shout  
Lose your minds  
Let it out  
  
Scream  
Scream and shout  
Lose your minds  
Let it out  
Out  
Out
