Every morning when the people are out  
And Im free move around on my own  
I look into the sun and I see a reflection  
Of a sad and lonely shrivelled man  
Thats me thats me  
And I know its how Im always gonna be  
  
Nothing to do nothing to say  
Nothing to hope and nothing to pray  
  
I can see I can feel  
Ive forgotten what Im meant to be  
Wont come back not if I try  
  
They told me things about me that I didnt know  
But I could tell theyve told me lies  
And it really goes to show  
That everyone was wrong  
And they dont understand my ways  
But its not me thats going wrong its them  
  
I can see I can feel  
Ive forgotten what Im meant to be  
Wont come back not if I try  
  
They told me things about me that I didnt know  
But I could tell theyve told me lies  
And it really goes to show  
That everyone was wrong  
And they dont understand my ways  
But its not me thats going wrong its them  
  
Every morning when the people are out  
And Im free move around my own  
I look into the sun and I see a reflection  
Of a sad and lonely shrivelled man  
  
Thats me thats me  
And I know its how Im always gonna be  
  
Thats me thats me  
And I know its how Im always gonna be  
  
Shrivelled old man  
Who hides from a world  
Hes never seen the light  
That can set him free  
His vicious life  
Is such a shame  
I wanna find out whos to blame  
  
And thats me oh thats me aaoh  
Set me free
