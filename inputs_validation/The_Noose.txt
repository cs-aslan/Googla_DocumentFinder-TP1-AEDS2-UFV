Well our souls are all mistaken in the same misguided way  
We all end up forsaken were just choosing our own way  
The future now incinerates before our very eyes  
And leaves us with emptiness of no more tries  
  
Well our visions of glory have spiraled down the drain  
The best of our intentions come crashing down in flames  
The depths of our despair we are unable to contain  
Its shallow living  
  
The noose is falling  
And all my friends are crawling  
The noose is falling  
And enemies are rising  
A truth appalling  
Our makare comes a calling  
The noose is falling  
And enemies are rising  
  
Well the tracers from yesteryear are burning in the dust  
Your bruises are reminders of naivete and trust  
Youre only feeling stronger cause your bodys getting numb  
Now I lay you down  
Put the coins in your eyes  
And blow the candles out  
  
The noose is falling  
And all my friends are crawling  
The noose is falling  
And enemies are rising  
A truth appalling  
Our makare comes a calling  
The noose is falling  
And enemies are rising  
  
No more  
No more  
Nothing  
  
No more  
No more  
Ever  
No  
More
