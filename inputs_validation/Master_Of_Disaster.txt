You should run away when you see me play  
Im the source of all destruction  
Veins that pump with fear  
You better not get near  
All I do is wreck constructions  
  
Come near me and youll see  
You should run from me  
Im dedicated to  
Destroying me and you  
  
Keep running faster  
Away from the master  
It all breaks faster  
When youre near the master  
Of disaster  
  
Master of disaster is tangled in strings  
Tripping over stuff and smashing up things  
I watch too much Jackass see what that brings  
All around me I hear people scream  
Master  
Of Disaster  
All around me I hear people scream  
Master  
Of Disaster  
  
Jackassing away always goes astray  
Its the start of a new era  
Lose monopoly leads to misery  
Intoxication makes things weirder  
  
Come near me and youll see  
You should run from me  
Im dedicated to  
Destroying me and you  
  
Keep running faster  
Away from the master  
It all breaks faster  
When youre near the master  
Of disaster  
  
Master of disaster is tangled in strings  
Tripping over stuff and smashing up things  
I watch too much Jackass see what that brings  
All around me I hear people scream  
Master  
Of Disaster  
All around me I hear people scream  
Master  
Of Disaster  
  
Master of Disaster  
What the hell is it Im after  
Master of Disaster  
Fire fills the skies  
Laughter laughter  
Every time I just start laughter  
Laughter laughter  
As a pain disguise  
  
Nothings worth all that  
Destroying habitat  
Wrecking all without a reason  
Annihilating gaze  
Numbering your days  
All creations out of season  
  
I will make you cry  
I will make you die  
I will hurt you too  
Nothing I can do  
  
Keep running faster  
Away from the master  
It all breaks faster  
When youre near the master  
Of disaster  
  
Master of disaster is tangled in strings  
Tripping over stuff and smashing up things  
I watch too much Jackass see what that brings  
All around me I hear people scream  
Master  
Of Disaster  
All around me I hear people scream  
Master  
Of Disaster  
Ha ha ha  
Ha ha aargh
