Outside the carolers start to sing  
I cant descibe the joy they bring  
Cause joy is something they dont bring me  
  
My boifriend is by my side  
From the roof are hanging sickles of ice  
Their whiny voices get irritating  
Its Christmas time again  
  
So I stand with a dead smile on my face  
Wondering how much of my time theyll waste  
Oh God I hate these Satans helpers  
  
And then I guess I must have snapped  
Because I grabbed the baseball bat  
And made them all run for shelter  
  
Its Christmas time again  
Its time to be nice to the people you cant stand  
All year  
Im growing tired of all this Christmas cheer  
You people scare me  
Please stay away from my home  
If you dont wanna get beat down  
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone  
  
Well I guess its not cool to freak on Christmas Eve  
Cause the cops came and arrested me  
They had an unfair advantage  
And even though the jail didnt have a tree  
Christmas came a night early  
Cause a guy named bubba unwrapped my package  
  
Its Christmas time again  
Its time to be nice to the people you cant stand  
All year  
Im growing tired of all this Christmas cheer  
You people scare me  
Please stay away from my home  
If you dont wanna get beat down  
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone  
  
I wont be home I wont be home for Christmas  
I wont be home I wont be home for Christmas  
Please post my bail  
I wont be home I wont be home for Christmas  
Please post my bail  
I wont be home I wont be home for Christmas  
Please post my bail  
I wont be home I wont be home for Christmas  
Please post my bail  
I wont be home I wont be home for Christmas
