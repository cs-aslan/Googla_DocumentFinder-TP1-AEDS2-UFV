Oh oh oh oh oh oh x18  
  
Remember make believe in you  
All the things I said Id do  
I wouldnt hurt you like the world did me  
Keep you safe Id keep you sweet  
Everything that I went through  
Im greatful you wont have to do  
I know that you will have to fall  
I cant hide you from it all  
  
Chorus  
But take the best of what Ive got  
And you know no matter what  
Before you walk away you know you can  
Run run run  
Back to my arms back to my arms  
Run run run back to my arms and they will hold you down  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh x4  
  
See heres the bloody bloody truth  
You will hurt and you will lose  
Ive got scars you wont believe  
Wear them proudly on my sleeve  
I hope youll have the sense to know  
That sadness comes and sadness goes  
Love so hard and play life loud  
Its the only thing to give a damn about  
  
Chorus  
But take the best of what Ive got  
And you know no matter what  
Before you walk away you know you can  
Run run run  
Back to my arms back to my arms  
Run run run  
Back to my arms and they will hold you down  
  
All this time I swear Ill never waste it  
All your smiles Im always gonna save them  
Put it in the back of my mind  
Whenever Im away from you x2  
  
Run run run  
Back to your arms back to your arms  
Run run run  
Back your arms and they will hold you  
Whoa whoa whoa  
Back to my arms back to my arms  
  
All this time I swear Ill never waste it  
All your smiles Im always gonna save them  
Put it in the back of my mind  
Back to my arms and they will hold you down  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh x2  
They will hold you down  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh x2
