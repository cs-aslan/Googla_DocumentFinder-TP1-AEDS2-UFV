I dont like young girls  
I dont like boys  
I like some bitch to scare me  
I like that noise  
I dont like secrets  
I dont like God  
I dont like people  
When they say Im things Im not  
I dont need opinions and rumours  
I dont need a voix in the dark  
I dont need to listen to strangers  
I dont need to tear out my heart  
One stranger  
One heartbeat  
One love is  
Forever  
One picture  
One morning  
One tear lasts  
Forever  
I like this motion  
I like this heat  
I like this breathing  
And I know I like this beat  
I like your whispers  
I like your screams  
I like your lies  
And Im sure Id like your dreams  
You dont need opinions and rumours  
You dont need a voix in the dark  
You dont need to listen to strangers  
You dont need to tear out your heart  
Ill show you pictures  
Ill make you cry  
Ill show you things youve done  
And then Ill ask you why  
I dont need heroes  
I dont need this name  
I dont need favours  
And I know I dont need fame  
We dont need opinions and rumours  
We dont need a voix in the dark  
We dont need to listen to strangers  
We dont need to tear out our hearts  
One reason  
One secret  
One lie is  
Forever  
One nightmare  
One rumour  
Your shame is  
Forever
