Hey kid I got a ride for you  
They say your brain is a comic book tattoo  
And youll never be anything  
What will you do with your life  
Thats all you hear from noon till night  
  
Take a trip on a rocket ship baby where the sea is the sky  
I know the guy who runs the place and hes outasight  
Flying Dutchman are you out there  
Flying Dutchman are you out there  
  
Straight suits they dont understand  
She tried that one with the alligator boots but the other side drew her in  
Heart falling fast when she left even the Milky Way was dressed in black  
  
Take a trip on a rocket ship baby where the sea is the sky  
I know the guy who runs the place and hes outasight  
Flying Dutchman are you out there  
Flying Dutchman are you out there  
  
Cause they cant see what youre born to be  
They can see me  
They cant be  
What they cant believe  
They can see what you see  
  
Theyll keep the boy spinning in their own little world ah  
Tie him up so he wont say a word  
Theyll keep the boy spinning in their own little world  
So afraid hell be what they never were
