I want to give her something shell remember  
And she say No no no no no  
I want to squeeze her tight and not offend her yeah  
She said No no no no no  
And he thought that she was coming back but she wrote him a letter  
Sealed it with a kiss and placed it in front of my door  
  
Chorus  
Seems as though youve got your way before  
You left me standing helpless just when I need more  
You broke my heart for the last time you broke my heart for the last time  
You broke my heart for the last time goodbye Elenore  
  
I tried to tell the boys all about her yeah  
And they say No no no no no  
They told me she was loose no doubt about her  
Well I say No no no no no  
And he thought that she was coming back but she wrote him a letter  
Sealed it with a kiss and placed it in front of my door  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus You broke my heart for the last time broke my heart its the last
time  
You stole my heart and now youre gone forevermore
