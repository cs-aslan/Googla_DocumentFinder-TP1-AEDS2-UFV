I remember that monday morning  
When I was subpoenaed to be in court  
  
Many things ran through my mind  
I started thinking about the people  
All day long trying to think of something to say to the people  
  
Are you ready for the question  
All in favour let it be known by standing on you feet  
  
I want young men and young women who are not alive today  
But who will come into this world with new preivleges  
And new oppurtunities  
I wnat them to know and see that these new priveleges and oppurtunities  
Did not come without somebody suffering and sacrificing for  
  
Freedom is never given to anybody  
  
Like anybody  
I would like to live a long life  
Longevity has its place  
But Im not concerned about that now  
I just want to do god will  
And he has allowed me to go up to the mountian  
And Ive looked over  
And Ive seen the promise land  
I may not get there with you  
But I want you to know tonight  
That we as a people  
Will get to the promise land  
So Im happy tonight Im not worried about anything  
Im not fearing any man  
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord  
  
Glory hallelujah glory hallelujah  
Glory hallelujah glory hallelujah  
His tuth is marching on
