The road is long  
With many winding turns  
That leads us to  
Who knows where  
Who knows where  
But Im strong  
Strong enough to care  
Ah He aint heavy  
Cause hes my brother  
So on we go  
His welfare is my concern  
No burden is he  
To where well get there  
But I know  
He will not uncomfort me  
Ah He aint heavy  
Cause hes my brother  
The road is long  
With many winding turns  
That leads us to  
Who knows where  
Who knows where  
But Im strong  
Strong enough to care  
Ah he aint heavy  
Cause hes my brother  
When the going gets rough  
Ive got a brother  
When the going gets tough  
Ive got a friend  
Ah you must call me  
Yeah yeah  
All you must call me  
He hes my brother  
Hes my brother
