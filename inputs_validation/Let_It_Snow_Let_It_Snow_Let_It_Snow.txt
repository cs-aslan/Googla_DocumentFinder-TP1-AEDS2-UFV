Oh the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since weve no place to go  
Let it snow let it snow let it snow  
  
Hey It doesnt show signs of stopping  
And Ive brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow let it snow let it snow  
  
And when we finally kiss good night  
How Ill hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home Ill be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
Hey and Honey were still goodbying  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
