You did the best that you could do  
You were a great crew  
Who tried to nurture and preserve your faith in you  
And with the bureau chiefs and the shrugging spies  
You could stay but why  
  
You see a light and then another  
And everything you fought for naughts uncovered  
Youre not a fighter youre a lover  
You got no business in here brother  
So stay  
Stay  
  
Is it the worst that you could do  
You were a great you  
Who tried to nurture and preserve your faith in you  
And with the bureau chiefs and the shrugging spies  
You could stay and why  
Cause you see a light and then another  
Everything you thought you soughts uncovered  
Youre a fighter and a lover  
And theres no one up above her  
So stay  
Stay  
  
All things being balanced its balanced and called balancing  
Somewhere beyond everything its being balanced  
Not for the sake of balance  
But balancing between the throes of learning  
And the entire thing  
Entirely  
Balancing
