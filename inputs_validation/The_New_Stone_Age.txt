This is the room  
This is the wall  
This is the body  
Ive been hoping for  
These are the words  
Ive been longing just to say  
  
So this is my goal  
The aim of my life  
This is the feeling  
They warned me about  
  
Oh my god  
What have I done this time  
Oh my god  
What have I done his time  
  
The things that youve done  
You dont understand  
The feeling the longing  
The failing thats gone  
  
real heart stop in  
The arms to be  
Everything shouting  
In the new stone age  
  
Of my god  
What have we done this time  
Oh my god  
What have we done this time  
  
well start living  
In the real stone age
