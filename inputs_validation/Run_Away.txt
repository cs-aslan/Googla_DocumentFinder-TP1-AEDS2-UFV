I thought you would always be my friend  
Now everything must end  
And so the world moves on  
And everything must change  
  
When Im looking at the night sky I can see my soul  
I can see the little lights flashing at each other up above  
Is it us making love in the Milky Way  
Long before we threw it all away  
  
Hey you ooh  
Were running out of time ooh  
And you know its true ooh  
I just want to run away from here with you  
Tonight  
Tonight  
  
Sometimes I wish I was a house at the end of the block  
You could smash all my windows with the throw of a rock  
And make the hurt go away come again some other day  
Theres so much I want to say about  
  
You ooh  
Were running out of time ooh  
And you know its true ooh  
I just want to run away from here with you  
  
I thought you would always be my friend  
But everything must end  
And so the world moves on  
Cause everything must change  
And now youre all alone  
Youre sitting by the telephone  
You wonder why  
Everyone will cry  
Tonight  
Tonight  
Tonight  
Tonight
