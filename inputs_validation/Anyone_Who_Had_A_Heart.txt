Anyone who ever loved  
Could look at me  
And know that I love you  
Anyone who ever dreamed  
Could look at me  
And know I dream of you  
  
Knowing I love you so  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in her arms  
And love me too  
You you couldnt really have a heart  
And hurt me  
Like you hurt me  
And be so untrue  
What am I to do  
  
Every time you go away  
I always say its goodbye dear  
Loving you the way I do  
I take you back  
Without you Id die dear  
Knowing I love you so  
  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in her arms  
And love me too  
You you couldnt really have a heart  
And hurt me  
Like youve hurt me  
And be so untrue  
So what can I do  
  
Knowing I love you so  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in her arms  
And love me too  
You couldnt really have a heart  
And hurt me  
Like you hurt me  
And be so untrue  
  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would love me too  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would surely take me in her arms  
And and always love me and love me love me  
Why wont you  
  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would love me too  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would surely take me  
Anyone would take me

No ones gonna make you feel the way I do
