Im a fool baby fool yeah uh  
If I fuck up forgive me  
Im a fool Im a fool Im a fool yeah he  
Yeah yeah  
  
Im a fool hundred thousand for the jewels  
Last year we killed the game  
And left yall browsing for the clues  
Old niggas out here searching for that fountain of the youth  
Money talks and hoes say its point of view  
Dont make me act a fool like Malcolm before the suit  
How can you justify I testified and theres proof in it  
Through out the years shed tears and spill truths  
Somehow they love a nigga better  
When he talk about is loot  
Chain like a kaleidoscope see light through a wider scope  
And for I know this necklace really represents the news  
Still I hit the jeweler how much racks to make me cooler  
I just play the game homie I aint making rules up  
Started from the bottom same way you lace your shoes up  
So if Im blowing cake just blame it on the place I grew up  
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television  
Got no plans of seeing hella prison  
You can tell Im living right  
Im a fool  
Never said Im living right  
Such a fool for you  
  
Boy you a fool boy you a fool  
Boy you a fool and they like  
And they like and they like  
Boy you a fool boy you a fool  
Boy you a fool and they like  
And they like and they like  
  
Hey Im a fool hunned thous to go to school  
 debt me and my mama dared me  
Drowning in the pool  
The first to go to college  
They say knowledge is the truth  
But these hoes on campus make a young nigga drool  
So we party skip class get ass and talk cool  
Meanwhile she back home work hard  
I use that as my few  
So I finally graduated  
But Im sad to say it I aint learn a fucking thing  
Except the game and how to play it  
Im a fool no on my shoes  
No cuts out on prove  
So fuck yall reviews  
She told me Cole I love you roll with you before the riches  
But you way too educated to be calling women bitches  
And calling brothers niggas  
Pardon if I cross the line  
But all the time thought you was different than  
All them other niggas  
I responded to her please dont put me on a pedestal  
Cause I know better  
And Im still a fool
