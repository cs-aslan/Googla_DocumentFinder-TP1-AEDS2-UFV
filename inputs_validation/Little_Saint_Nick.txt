Oo merry Christmas Santa only comes this time each year oooo  
Well way up north where the air gets cold  
theres a tale about Christmas that youve all been told  
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red  
and he spends the whole year working out on his sled  
its a little Saint Nick its a little Saint Nick  
  
Just a little bobsled calls it old Saint Nick  
But he sparks the buggy with a full speed stick  
Hes candy apple red with a ski for a wheel  
Then he gives gas and just watch him peel yeah  
its a little Saint Nick its a little Saint Nick  
  
Run run reindeer run run reindeer run run reindeer  
run run reindeer run run run yeah  
  
Hes rolling through the snow at a frightful speed  
with a half dozen deer with Rudy to lead  
Hes gotta wear his goggle cause the snow really flies  
and hes cruising every path with a little surprise  
its a little Saint Nick its a little Saint Nick  
  
Oo merry Christmas Santa only comes this time each year
