Theres a spirit of a storm in my soul  
A restlessness that I cant seem to tame  
Thunder and lightning follow everywhere I go  
Theres a spirit of a storm in my soul  
  
Theres a hurricane thats raging through my blood  
I cant find a way to calm the sea  
Maybe Ill find someday the waters arent so rushed  
Right now theyve got the best of me  
And oh its been a long long time  
Since I had real peace of mind  
So Im just going to sit right here  
In this old chair till this storm rolls by  
  
Oh maybe its just the way I am  
Maybe I wont ever change  
So Im just going to sit right here  
In this old chair and just soak up the rain  
  
Theres a spirit of a storm in my soul  
Every time I think its gone away  
Dark clouds gather that old wind begins to blow  
The suns going to shine someday I hope  
Theres a spirit of a storm in my soul in my soul
