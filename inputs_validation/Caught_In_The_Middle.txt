Just an ordinary day all around it seems OK  
With a normal view  
  
Then you open up your eyes suddenly you realize  
Everyones confused  
  
Caught in the middle of life and fantasy  
Caught in the middle is where you seem to be  
  
Everyone around is sad but they analyze you mad  
Sayin youve lost your mind  
  
Seems their lives have been abused  
With a risk of being used no happiness to find  
  
Caught in the middle of life and fantasy  
Caught in the middle is where you seem to be  
  
Seems the whole society in the worlds insanity  
Sayin youve lost your mind  
  
Seems their lives have been abused  
With a risk of being used no happiness to find  
  
Caught in the middle of life and fantasy  
Caught in the middle is where you seem to be
