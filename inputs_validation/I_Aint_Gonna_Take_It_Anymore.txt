Youve worn the soles of both your shoes  
Walkin on me like ya do  
This aint what forevers for  
And I aint gonna take it  
  
I aint gonna take it anymore  
Ive cried and begged and cursed and prayed  
But nothings worked nothings changed  
No way I win when you keep score  
  
And I aint gonna take it  
I aint gonna take it anymore  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna crawl out from this stone  
That Ive been under  
To see the light and breathe the air  
And youll have a million reasons why  
I shouldnt leave you  
But for the first time in a long time  
I dont care  
  
I guess on one hand you should laugh  
cause Ive said the same things in the past  
But this time one hands on the door  
And I aint gonna take it  
I aint gonna take it anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
Now I cant help but think of you  
Lookin back in my rear view  
But Ive been down that road before  
And I aint gonna take it  
  
I aint gonna take it anymore  
I aint gonna take it  
I aint gonna take it anymore
