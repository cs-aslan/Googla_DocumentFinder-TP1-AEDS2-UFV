Te amo te amo she says to me  
I hear the pain in her voice  
Then we danced underneath the candelabra she takes the lead  
Thats when I saw it in her eyes its over  
  
Then she said Te amo then she put her hand around my waist  
I told her no she cried Te amo  
I told her Im not gonna run away but let me go  
My soul is awry and without asking why  
I said Te amo wish somebody would tell me what she said  
Dont it mean I love you  
I think it means I love you  
Dont it mean I love you  
  
Te amo te amo shes scared to breathe  
I hold her hand I got no choice uhh  
Pulled me out on the beach danced in the water I start to leave  
Shes begging me and asking why its over  
  
Then she said Te amo then she put her hand around my waist  
I told her no she cried Te amo  
I told her Im not gonna run away but let me go  
My soul is awry and without asking why  
I said Te amo wish somebody would tell me what she said  
Dont it mean I love you  
I think it means I love you  
Dont it mean I love you  
  
Yes we can dance  
But you gotta watch your hands  
Watch me all night  
I move under the light because I understand  
That we all need love and Im not afraid  
I feel the love but I dont feel that way  
  
Then she said Te amo then she put her hand around my waist  
I told her no she cried Te amo  
I told her Im not gonna run away but let me go  
My soul is awry and without asking why  
I said Te amo wish somebody would tell me what she said  
Dont it mean I love you  
I think it means I love you  
Dont it mean I love you  
I think it means I love you I love you  
  
Te amo te amo dont it mean I love you
