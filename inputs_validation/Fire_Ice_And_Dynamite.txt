If you find me tugging at your sleeve  
Oh yeah well maybe youd better believe  
Im searching for the one to love  
Thats all Im thinking of  
  
I believe in taking chances  
Gonna see what your romance is  
Ill be risking my life tonight  
Fire ice and dynamite  
In the fire ice and dynamite  
If you see me running to extremes  
Oh yeh well Im only chasing my dreams  
If you see me coming close the door  
Im coming back for more  
  
I believe in taking chances  
Gonna see what your romance is  
Ill be risking my life tonight  
Fire ice and dynamite  
In the fire ice and dynamite  
Fire and ice And dynamite  
  
Dont you worry if it starts to rain  
Step aside if you cant stand the pain  
From the mountain top to the valley below  
Oh yeh well Im fighting with the flow  
I maybe burning in the frozen sun  
Cos Im gonna be number one  
  
I believe in taking chances  
Gonna see what your romance is  
Ill be risking my life tonight  
Fire ice and dynamite  
Fire ice and dynamite  
Fire ice and dynamite  
Fire ice and dynamite  
Cos I believe In taking chances
