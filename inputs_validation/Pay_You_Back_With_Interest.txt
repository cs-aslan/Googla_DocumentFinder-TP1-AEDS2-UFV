Too many people need me  
Ive got so much  
So much to do  
But when my traveling is over  
Ill pay you back with interest  
Ill pay you back with interest  
It seems unfair to leave you  
And sell myself the way I do  
But when my wandering is over  
Ill pay you back with interest  
Ill pay you back with interest  
Most of my life Ive been moving  
And when I tire out Ill come home to you  
But until then Ill be waiting  
Ill pay you back with interest  
Ill pay you back with interest  
How cold is my room How cold is my room  
Without your love beside me  
We look at the same old moon Looking at the moon  
But youre not here beside me  
Ill pay you back with interest  
Ill pay you back with interest
