Lost and all alone  
I always thought that I could make it on my own  
But since you left I hardly make it through the day  
My tears get in the way and I need you back to stay  
  
I wander through the night  
And search the world to find the words to make it right  
All I want is just the way it used to be  
With you here close to me  
And Ive got to make you see  
That Im lost without your love  
Life without you isnt worth the trouble of  
And Im as helpless as a ship without a wheel  
A touch without a feel  
I cant believe its real  
And someday soon Ill wake  
And find my heart wont have to break  
  
Yes Im lost without your love  
Life without you isnt worth the trouble of  
All I want is the way it used to be  
I need you here with me  
Oh darling cant you see  
If we had love before  
We can have it back once more
