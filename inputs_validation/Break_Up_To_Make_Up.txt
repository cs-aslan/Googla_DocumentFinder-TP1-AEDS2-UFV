Chorus  
You and me havin sex  
After an argument that shits the best  
You and me havin sex yeahh  
After an argument that shits the best  
Think about it while the streets you roam  
Its Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home  
  
I storm in she storm out  
Its like the War of the Roses goin on in my house  
Its a little separation but I know how to fix the situation  
Mami just sufferin from love deprevation  
So I gotta give her thug reperations  
Put it in the life until love leg is shakin  
Slow and passionate til we forget what happens  
Then we laughin and we back friends  
  
You dont have to fuss and fight  
Why dont you just spend the night  
Baby lets just kiss and hug  
You know the words girl lets make up  
So much love to be made  
Instead of screamin Whos to blame  
Girl I dont wanna let you go I need you so  
  
Chorus  
  
Girlfriend didnt believe me when I said Id be back in a little  
Cause I had the Chris T on with the crease in the middle  
Plus a fresh cut and the freezin icicles  
On my wrist on my hand thats when shit hit the fan  
Said You never spend timey whats up with that  
Translated it means  
Hit it hard from the back  
Yeah she hid my car keys  
And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont want baby I dont want to fight  
I just want to make it right ooh yeah  
Put out problems to the side  
Lets just make sweet love tonight I dont want  
Baby I dont want to fight  
I just want to make it right ohhhhh love  
Put our problems to the side  
Lets just make sweet love tonight  
  
Sex so intense all thats on my mind  
It aint feel this good since the very first time  
Im pullin her close shes pullin away  
Im tryin to kiss her mouth but she keeps turnin her face  
Cute sex game like our very first date  
We aint know each other well enough we had to wait  
But oh I know just where your hot spot at  
You can not deny that so do not try that  
I do not buy that  
  
Chorus
