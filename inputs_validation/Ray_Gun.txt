I know someone  
Doesnt believe in God  
Someone I know  
He doesnt even know God  
He came from a planet  
Three thousand miles away  
Just a short trip  
A kind of brief holiday  
Can you give someone  
Somewhere to stay  
I gotta warn you hes gotta gun  
I gotta warn you hes gotta gun  
I know someone  
Came on a short trip  
Traveling lightly  
Traveling by spaceship  
He came from a planet  
Three thousand miles away  
Can you give someone  
Somewhere to stay  
I gotta warn you hes gotta gun  
Oh look out woman  
A ray gun
