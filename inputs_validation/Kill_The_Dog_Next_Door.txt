I once was a happy man of sound and stable mind  
Then my neighbour bought a dog  
He put a ribbon on its head to make it cute  
But it still looked like a chihuahua  
He had me over to watch it sit and beg  
It bit my knee and made love to my leg  
Now it barks all the night and all of the day  
Whenever its not peeing on my lawn  
I didnt get to sleep last night till very late  
The stupid dog barked and grrrrd  
I got up late for work and ran to catch the bus  
But I slipped on a turd  
I was certain it wasnt one of mine  
That that dog had crossed over the line  
I wanted to exterminate it and all its kind  
From my lovely little suburb  
Im gonna kill the dog next door  
Aint gonna bark anymore  
Cause this is Judgment Day  
And the little runt has got to pay  
No more turds on my lawn  
That stupid mutt will soon be gone  
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that dog  
I see the little monster in my garden  
So I grab an axe and off I go  
And I try my best to get it  
All I do is sever my big toe  
My neighbour comes outside to call me  
He says his dog and me should just be friends  
He puts his little pet in my forgiving hands  
Then it starts to bite  
So I strangle it with all my might  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Im gonna kill the dog next door kill the dog next door  
Aint gonna bark anymore  
Cause this is Judgment Day  
And the little runt has got to pay  
No more turds on my lawn doodoos on my lawn  
That stupid mutt will soon be gone  
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that dog  
Now the stupid mutts in doggy heaven  
I strangled it to death and now Im free  
But my trouble aint quite over  
My neighbour called the cops on me  
I end up at the police station  
Where I am told that I must pay  
A 300 dollar fine  
Wow what a good value  
I think Ill kill my neighbour too  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Im gonna kill the guy next door kill the guy next door  
Wont call the cops anymore  
I never liked him anyway  
300 isnt much to pay  
There are turds on my lawn doodoos on my lawn  
They must be his his dog is gone  
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill  
Kill kill kill kill kill kill kill  
Kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that guy
