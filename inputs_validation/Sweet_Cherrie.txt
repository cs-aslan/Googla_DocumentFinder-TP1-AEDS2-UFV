Ive got to find sweet cherry  
Shes gone away from home  
Ive got to find sweet cherry  
Shes left me all alone  
chorus  
Cherry cherry  
Dont go and leave me alone  
Dont go and leave me alone  
  
My thoughts are always with you  
The emptiness leaves me blue  
If you should ever desert me  
Then life deserts me too  
  
chorus  
Cherry cherry  
Dont go and leave me alone  
Dont go and leave me alone  
  
When we were together downtown  
We would do things together downtown  
The first place I met you downtown  
There we could always be  
  
chorus  
Cherry cherry  
Dont go and leave me alone  
Dont go and leave me alone
