5411s poppin wheelies front of Willyburgers  
Candy apple M3s slidin out gently  
Rollin up in Bentleys Tyson was the champ then  
Right after the Rooftop years before the Hamptons  
  
You was a ghetto queen and a diamond in the rough  
You was so beautiful and the world was so rough  
Your man was locked up cause the cops popped up  
You dropped out of school on top of that you knocked up  
  
He was yo crush you was his crutch  
Hell be gone a dime and its hard to stay in touch  
Your moms say you stupid but you love him so much  
Now its broken dreams and broken Beemers in the dust  
  
Standin up on a crowded bus for college courses  
Stay on course when it gets rough you never lost it  
Stay strong baby trust youll be back flossin  
Diamond studs and linen crush keep your head up

Her boyfriends comin through with them hickeys on his neck  
He claims hes lovin her but never shows her no respect  
All she knows is neglect a lifetime of stress  
Big momma huh momma now lil momma is next  
  
You can see the effects of gettin treated incorrect  
Cause she let the cycle continue make excuses for his steps  
Her girlfriends tried to warn her all he wanted was the sex  
Once he get it then he gone then its on to somethin fresh

But thats aight you still young you got your lifetime left  
You gotta leave all that alone find yourself  
Theres no love until you love you remind yourself
