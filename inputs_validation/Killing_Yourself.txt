Move up from the table  
Stick her arm let her go  
Dropped dime on me last time  
By morning his blood turned bold  
Runnin from the law since Monday  
Cause Suzy went down on time  
Got enough to last till Sunday  
So Im burning on down that line  
Killing Yourself  
Killing Yourself  
Killing Yourself  
KKKKilling Yourself  
Move up from the table  
Fat man going down  
Some run from the big gun  
Some just run from the sound  
Runnin from the law since Monday  
Cause Suzy went down on time  
Got enough to last till Sunday  
So Im burning on down that line  
Suzy was a bad child  
Always on the wrong side  
Ah she was no good  
She was bad bad bad with the bad cats  
Always punching the needle in her arm  
Ah but when shes good shes so damn good  
Killing Yourself  
Killing Yourself  
Killing Yourself  
KKKKilling Yourself  
Youre just killing yourself
