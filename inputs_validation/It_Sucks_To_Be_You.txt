Verse 1  
You got a laundry list of todays complaints  
you think youre a superstar whos shit dont stank  
Youre a nothing wrapped up in a somethings clothes  
Youre the kinda person I dont want to know  
I dont hear you please shut up  
I dont see you cause youre too tough  
  
Chorus  
All the things I do they make you crazy  
You always say Im useless and Im lazy  
You moan and groan and bitch what does that prove  
  
Verse 2  
You cant sit still you never act straight  
I get uncomfortable when I see your face  
Everybodys talking behind your back  
Youre a three time loser into the cracks
