Theres a man in me whos lost his way  
And he searches for his pride  
Hes confused by who hes told to be  
Cause he feels the beast inside  
  
He is troubled by the changing times  
And he fears his dreams have died  
Theres a man thats waited  
Hoping to be liberated  
  
Theres a man in me who  
I want to save  
Revive his dignity  
Free from his cage  
And release the man in me who  
Cries for the day  
He will be let out  
And show us the way  
I believe theres a man in me  
  
I have lived inside my mothers eyes  
I have felt my fathers heart  
I am torn between the dark and light  
But I wont be torn apart  
  
Cause theres a man in me whos unafraid  
Who only now can feel his rage  
Hes been taught to hide it  
But he can no longer fight it  
  
Theres a man in me who  
I want to save  
Revive his dignity  
Free from his cage  
And release the man in me who  
Cries for the day  
He will be let out  
And show us the way  
I believe theres a man in me  
  
Here we are  
I didnt think wed get this far  
We were overdue  
When its time  
To understand the man  
Then I can love  
The woman in you  
  
Theres a man thats waited  
Hoping to be liberated  
  
Theres a man in me who  
I want to save  
Revive his dignity  
Free from his cage  
And release the man in me who  
Cries for the day  
He will be let out  
And show us the way  
I believe theres a man in me
