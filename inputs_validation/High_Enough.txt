I dont want to hear about it anymore  
Its a shame Ive got to live without you anymore  
Theres a fire in my hearta pounding in my brains driving me crazy  
  
We dont need to talk about it anymore  
Yesterdays just a memory can we close the door  
I just made one mistakeI didnt know what to say when you called mebaby  
  
Dont say goodnightsay your gonna stay forever  
All all the way  
  
Can you take me high enough  
To fly me over yesterday  
Can you take me high enough  
Its never over yesterdays just a memory  
Yesterdays just a memory  
  
And I dont want to live without you anymore  
Cant you see Im in misery and you know for sure  
I would live and die for you and I know just what to do when you call mebaby  
  
Dont say goodbyesay your gonna stay forever  
All all the way  
  
Can you take me high enough  
Can you fly me over yesterday  
Can you take me high enough  
Its never overyesterdays just a memory away  
  
I was running for the door  
And next thing I remember  
I was running back for more  
  
Dont say goodbyesay your gonna stay forever  
All all the way  
  
Can you take me high enough  
Can you fly me over yesterday  
Can you take me high enough  
Its never overwhoa whoa whoa  
  
Can you take me high enough  
Wont you fly me over yesterday
