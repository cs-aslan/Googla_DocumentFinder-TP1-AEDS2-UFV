Stay by me  
And make the moment last  
Please take these lips  
Even if I have been kissed  
A million times  
And I dont care if there is no tomorrow  
When I could die here in your arms  
Even if the stars have made us blind  
Were blind were blind  
So blind in love  
Sweet darling  
Dont you know that were no different to anyone  
We stumble  
We falter  
But were no different to anyone  
And all the winter snow has melted down  
Into a pool of silver water  
And we were standing in a thunder cloud  
Dark as your hair  
Dark as your hair
