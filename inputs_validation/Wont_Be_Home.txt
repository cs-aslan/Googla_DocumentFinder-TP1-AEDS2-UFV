Youre a bottle cap away  
From pushing me too far  
Well the problems gettin big  
An empty compact car  
So I wont feel so bad  
I did all I could do  
Now Im on wounded knee  
And were at Waterloo  
So please get out of my car  
  
I was born in the backseat of a mustang  
On a cold night in a hard rain  
And the very first song that the radio sang  
Was I wont be home no more  
  
Youre a rattle trap tonight  
My ears are gettin tired  
So listen for awhile  
Before this thing expired  
Oh it was bound to fail  
All because of where Im from  
Now the moons at four oclock  
And its high time kingdom come  
So please get out of my car  
  
I was born in the backseat of a mustang  
On a cold night in a hard rain  
And the very first song that the radio sang  
Was I wont be home no more  
  
I was born in the backseat of a mustang  
On a cold night in a hard rain  
And the very first song that the radio sang  
Was I wont be home no more
