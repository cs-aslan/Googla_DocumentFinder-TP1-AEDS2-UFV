Im Pachacuti the Incan lord  
All other tribes dreaded  
My name means he who shakes the earth  
Not that Im bigheaded  
  
When it comes to claiming nearby lands  
I was the type to risk it  
But its how I treat dead enemies  
That really took the biscuit  
  
I drink from their skull  
Do the Pachacuti  
Pull out their teeth whole  
Do the Pachacuti  
Turn teeth into charms  
Do the Pachacuti  
Make flutes out of their arms  
Pachacuti  
  
Once on a hillside my troops hid  
To cause a rival strife  
And when they jumped out it looked like  
The ground had come to life  
  
The rocks they are my warriors  
I then used to boast  
And that little lie helped us win wars  
But violence helped the most  
  
I drink from their skull  
Do the Pachacuti  
Pull out their teeth whole  
Do the Pachacuti  
Turn teeth into charms  
Do the Pachacuti  
Make flutes out of their arms  
Pachacuti  
  
If you were a rival chief  
Wed kill you fast and then  
Wed stuff you like a scarecrow  
But one for scaring men  
  
Then wed rest your bony fingers on  
The stretched skin of your belly  
And in the breeze theyd tap that tum  
Like a drummer but more smelly  
  
Drink from their skull  
Do the Pachacuti  
Pull out their teeth whole  
Do the Pachacuti  
Use their skin as a drum  
Do the Pachacuti  
Ive never had so much fun  
Pachacuti
