Beside to December Will Be Magic Again single  
Written by Kate Bush  
Warm and soothing  
Thats how I remember home  
Walking into arms  
Through the back door  
Hearing voices I know well  
And long for  
Cold and boozy  
Our holiday in the Alps  
Sitting in the lobby  
Mostly smoking  
Choking on the woozy afternoon  
Im reeling in the music  
And Ive only had a few  
And Im afraid  
By the way we grow old  
My darling  
Abrupt too moody  
You making our party list  
I remember sulking  
On the sofa  
For most of the winter  
We were strangers  
Just one more  
To ease the ache  
Before the night takes me  
When you stay asleep  
On your side of the bed  
Dont look at me  
Dont look at you  
Im reeling in the music  
And Ive only had a few  
And Im afraid  
By the way we grow old
