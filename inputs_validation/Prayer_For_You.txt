Youre gonna say something to the people  
A prayer for you  
A prayer to you  
Just a simple thought of you means everything  
To my life you give meaning that youre the best thing  
So precious like it for life  
That why I send you up this prayer  
I pray for your protection your covering  
That everything intended for you youll receive  
And I believe hell guide ya  
Right out of my prayer  
A prayer for you  
A prayer to you  
I Pray for you  
A prayer for you  
Ill do my best to be there for you everyday  
To be what my father wished he was to me  
Baby I got you  
Daddy youll be there  
Ill be there to encourage you to be the best you can be  
You carry my name I pray that youre better than me  
I aint going no where even when I get on your nerves  
Cause Im your daddy  
My prayer for you  
Son I pray for you
