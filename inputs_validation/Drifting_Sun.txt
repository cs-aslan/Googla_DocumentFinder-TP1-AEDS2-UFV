Well Im sitting on a stone  
Sitting all alone  
Daisies are rolling down the mountain  
Well see the lonesome tramp  
Whos living in the damp  
Nobodys in the valley  
Shine on Shine on sun  
Oh its so cold right here  
Shine on shine on sun  
Shine on all night long  
All night long  
  
Baby doll Im sad and blue  
Glossy wings will carry you  
Well midnight sun will never shine  
These ravings of a fool  
Youre thinking all about him all the time  
Shine on shine on sun  
Oh its so cold right here  
Shine on shine on sun  
Shine on all night long all night long  
All night long yeah  
  
One day baby told you sun just fades away  
Forgot your life is fading now hes in the grave  
Some days like drifting haze  
Some days like glowing blaze  
Some days like tides of light  
Some days like tides of night  
  
One day baby told you sun just fades away  
Forgot your life is fading now hes in the grave  
Some days like drifting haze  
Some days like glowing blaze  
Some days like tides of light  
Some days like tides of night  
  
Traveling along a tropic highway  
Crazy as the world goes round and round  
Hallowed heaven night or day  
Burning thing has putting the sun away  
Shine on shine on sun  
Let it shine on all night long  
Shine on shine on sun  
Let it shine on all night long
