The boy with the thorn in his side  
Behind the hatred there lies  
A murderous desire for love  
How can they look into my eyes  
And still they dont believe me  
How can they hear me say those words  
Still they dont believe me  
And if they dont believe me now  
Will they ever believe me  
And if they dont believe me now  
Will they ever they ever believe me  
Oh  
  
The boy with the thorn in his side  
Behind the hatred there lies  
A plundering desire for love  
How can they see the Love in our eyes  
And still they dont believe us  
And after all this time  
They dont want to believe us  
And if they dont believe us now  
Will they ever believe us  
And when you want to live  
How do you start  
Where do you go  
Who do you need to know  
  
Oh  
Oh no  
Oh  
La
