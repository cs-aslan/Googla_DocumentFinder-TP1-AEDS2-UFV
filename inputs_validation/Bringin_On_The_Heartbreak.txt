Gypsy sittin lookin pretty  
The broken rose with laughin eyes  
Youre a mystery always runnin wild  
Like a child without a home  
Youre always searching searching for a feeling  
That its easy come and easy go  
  
Oh Im sorry but its true  
Youre bringin on the heartbreak  
Takin all the best of me  
Oh cant you see

Youre such a secret misty eyed and shady  
Lady how you hold the key  
Oh youre like a candle your flame slowly fadin  
Burnin out and burnin me
