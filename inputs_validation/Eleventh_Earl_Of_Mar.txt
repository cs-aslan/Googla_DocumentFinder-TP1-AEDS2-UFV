The sun had been up for a couple of hours  
Covered the ground with a layer of gold  
Spirits were high and the raining had stopped  
The larder was low But boy that wasnt all  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Couldnt get them very far  
Daddy Oh Daddy You Promised  
  
Out on the road in the direction of Perth  
Backwards and forwards in a circle they went  
Found a city half open and ready to greet  
The conquering heros with blisters on their feet  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Somehow got them all this far  
Daddy You Promised You Promised  
  
See the Stewart are dressed up  
Hes got eyes in the back of his head  
Who came in a cockleshell boat  
That could only just float  
Couldnt even lift a sword  
Dressed too fine and smelling of wine  
  
Daddy youve got to go  
Here come the bishop all dressed up  
Hes gonna bless you if youre ready to pay  
One wave of his funny old stick  
Theres a band of light across your eyes  
  
Waited a week still they hadnt appeared  
That glorious timing that everyone feared  
So theyre riding along on the crest of a wave  
Theyre headed for London And that will be their grave  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Well he couldnt get them down that far  
Daddy Im waiting Im waiting  
  
Time to go to bed now  
Never seems too keen  
To be a guest now  
In a house of dreams  
  
Flying from a hillside  
Beckoning the trees  
A sailboats awning  
Mimicking the breeze  
  
Im fighting gravity falling  
My Daddy wont let them get me  
A voice screams seems to be calling  
The face turns features are burning  
  
Daddy youve got to go  
See the fifteen going by  
Tell the Lairds and the Lords  
Theyre running backwards today  
And once again you stand alone  
  
Bury your memories bury your friends  
Leave it alone for a year or two  
Till the stories go hazy and the legends come true  
Then do it again Some Things never end  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Wont be going very far  
You Promised You Promised You Promised  
DADDY
