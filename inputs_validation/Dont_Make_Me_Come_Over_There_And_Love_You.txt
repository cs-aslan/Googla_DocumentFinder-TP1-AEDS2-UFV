Dont make me come over there and love you  
Ill be beside you in a single Bound  
Dont make me come over there and love you  
Cause I will right now  
I dont need any explanation  
Why I crave all your honey talk  
Dont make me come over there and love you  
Cause its a short walk  
You better tone down  
Your persuasion  
Start behaving  
Before I go and fall apart  
My hearts been on a long vacation  
And now its beating like a ChaChaCha  
Dont make me come over there and love you  
Cause I will right now  
You better tone down  
Your persuasion  
Start behaving  
Before I go and fall apart  
Dont make me come over there and love you  
Because its looking like a perfect spot  
Dont make me come over there and love you  
And give all I got  
Dont make me come over there and love you  
Cause I will right now  
Yes I will right now  
Dont make me come over there and love you
