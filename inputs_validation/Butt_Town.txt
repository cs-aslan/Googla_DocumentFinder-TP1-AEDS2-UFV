The cops are wellgroomed with  
Muscled physiques in butt town  
Their tan uniforms are tailored in chic  
In butt town  
Any young black male who walks down the street  
Is gonna get stopped by a car full of meat  
But the girl with the hair  
Flies by in her underwear  
  
Shes done nothing so far to deserve that car  
When you live in butt town  
You gotta get down  
But in butt town Im learnin  
In butt town Im earnin  
In butt town Im turnin  
Into my worst nightmare  
  
Im tellin you its a motley crew in butt town  
Monday youre new and Friday youre through  
In butt town  
The producer is wily and owns what he sells  
The talent is eager to go straight to hell  
Th tits are amazing and everyones gazing  
At some body part  
Thats the nature of art in butt town  
  
All over butt town dreams have a show down  
All over butt town values are thrown down  
But in butt town Im learnin  
In butt town Im earnin  
In butt town Im turnin  
Into my worst nightmare  
  
In butt town baby  
Im gonna be a star  
Im gonna shake my butt far  
Now here we go  
Im gonna shake my butt  
Shake my butt shake my butt  
In butt town
