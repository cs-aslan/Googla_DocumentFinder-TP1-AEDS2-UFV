Dancing like the nights are down in nashville  
But I seem to know the ghosts who like to run  
I got a call to go to a late night picture show  
So I traded in the darkness and Im already there  
Im already there  
  
Chorus  
And Im tryin to make some friends  
So if you see that movie star and me  
If you see my picture in a magazine  
  
Or if you fall asleep by the bedroom TV  
  
Well honey Im just tryin to make some sense  
Outta me  
  
I left a lot of ghosts in San Francisco  
And now you wanna say you see through me  
But what you wanna see aint your memories of me  
So why you turn around tonight  
But Im already there  
Im already there  
  
Chorus  
  
Or if you fall asleep while youre watching TV  
  
Well honey Im just trying to make some sense  
Los Angeles  
Boston gets cold this time of year  
Seems like each day just leaves me numb  
I gotta get out of here  
Go walking in the sun  
  
Well if you see that movie star and me  
Or if you should see my picture in a magazine  
Or if you fall asleep by the bedroom TV  
  
But honey Im just trying to make some sense  
Honey Im just trying to make some friends  
Well baby Im not trying to make amends  
For coming to Los Angeles  
Oh Los Angeles  
  
No more Boston no more Nashville no more Oakland  
Oh baby come on out to the sea  
Come on take a walk down Sunset with me  
  
Oh we gonna get drunk find up some skinny girls and go street walking  
In Los Angeles  
  
And man its a really good place to find yourself a taco
