Ill tell you a story  
bout a man that i loved  
He lives in the sky  
In the clouds above  
He knows every river  
Every mountain and stream  
Hes a gentleman i tell you  
That lives in my dream  
If you don t believe  
What i say is true  
Maybe someday he will happen to you  
Its like hes always watching over me  
I do believe in magic  
When its plain to see  
If you dont believe  
What i say is true  
Maybe someday he will happen to you  
Softly he whispers into my ear  
The dream is over but i dont want to hear  
No no no no  
Softly he whispers into my ear  
The dream is over but i dont want to hear  
So take me i m lonely  
Take me in your dreams  
Please dont leave me waiting here  
As long as it seems  
If you dont believe  
What i say is true  
Maybe baby someday he will happen to you  
Softly he whispers into my ear  
The dream is over but i dont want to hear  
But i dont want to heari dont want to hear  
I dont wannai dont want to hear
