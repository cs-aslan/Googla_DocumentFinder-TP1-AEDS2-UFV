Open up the sky  
Cause Im coming up to you  
So send down your wings  
Itll bring me to you  
You know Im standing at the station  
Ready to go  
Big ol airplane you know I trust in you so  
  
Get on up big bird  
To my baby love  
Get on up big bird  
To my baby love  
Get on up big bird  
I got to make it heard  
Get on up big bird

You know Im standing at the station  
Ready to go  
Big ol airplane you know I trust in you so  
  
Get on up big bird

Get on up big bird  
To my baby love  
Get on up big bird
