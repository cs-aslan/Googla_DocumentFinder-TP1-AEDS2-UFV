Im tired of waiting  
An closing my eyes  
Im asking myself  
Why is it all my horizons  
Are so far away  
  
I look in the mirror  
Dont like what I see  
In my reflection  
A stranger is staring at me  
Looking for love  
  
The love of a woman  
The needs of a man  
I try so hard to believe  
But I dont understand  
The search goes on  
  
But over the mountains  
Across the sea  
I know love is waiting  
I hear it calling to me  
Calling my name  
  
Im looking for love all around me  
Looking for love to surround me  
The love that I need  
To rescue the state of my heart  
  
Alone again Its always the same  
Ive just been marking my time  
Since the day I was born  
With no one to blame  
  
The candle is burning  
Its way down low  
I just need someone  
To show me the way to go  
Which way to go  
  
Im looking for love all around me  
Looking for love to surround me  
The love that I need  
To rescue the state of my heart  
  
Im looking for love  
An finding only heartache  
Looking for love  
An finding only heartache  
Im looking for love to rely on  
Looking for love a shoulder to cry on  
Im looking for love  
To rescue the state of my heart
