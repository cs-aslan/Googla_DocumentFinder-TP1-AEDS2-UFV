Yo here comes the intro  
Its time to let it go  
I live the life of my rhyme I think Ill let it show  
So keep it goin so the mic can stay warm  
Then I know Ive been doin my job cause therell be sweat pourin  
  
So pick and choose your weapon but dont slip  
Im here to kill you boys with the flex of my mic grip  
So pump your fist like this but dont miss  
The hook and the break when you decide to dance to this  
Lyrical concept thats meant for the dance floor  
I know you adore cause thats what you came for  
The ice rhymer is back and livin large  
And when Im at a show you better wear camouflage  
cause there was plenty who thought I couldnt swing this  
But now all I get from the crowd is just a pumped fist  
So sing along with the chorus cause its a hit  
Or stay at home alone cause ice will be workin it  
  
Chorus  
Work it work it work it work it work it work it work  
It work it work it ice yea cmon and work it baby  
Work it work it work it work it work it work it work  
It work it work it ice yea cmon and work it baby  
  
Go white boy go white boy go  
Check out the hook vanilla ice yep yep  
  
Im makin a killin and chillin because Im cool as an ice  
Pack  
Youre lovin everything when I think of a new track  
I keep my rhyme flowin notice its right on time  
And separate the wax and keep my mic in line  
So put your body in motion and let me know that youre there  
And those playin the wall dont be scared  
cause its a foundation of breaks put to a beat  
Strong as concrete cause Im rockin the beat  
Im in rock mode now cause Im steppin like a soldier  
Move to the groove and try to hold your composure  
Never the less Im back to attack  
I came to manifest and express to this dope track  
Blow off the lid for the kid I get nice  
Thats why the ladies scraemoh vanilla ice  
Forthcomin Im risin to the top  
The real definition of funk is put to hip hop  
Thats what I though youre cause by the friction  
Pens to the pad when Im shakin the mixin  
What I like to hear is a drummer get wicked  
The tone of a vocal thrown and then kick it  
Dont be surprised if your eyeballs swell  
I know its hard to regard cause Im loved by the females  
Masses of many which is plenty comes to a halt  
No ones in the runnin so I guess that is my fault  
So pump up the crowd and give em somethin to step to  
My djs at his max to enhance what I bring you  
The concepts hittin so follow along like a cookbook  
Acknowledge the pros from all the titles I took yea  
The crowds at ease when I breat through the mic end  
As I whip up a dance better move all the mic stands  
I go to work on the floor like a wet mop  
If youve ever been moved check it out when I rock  
  
Chorus  
  
Throw your hands in the air and lets get hyper  
Flip this thing and sting like a viper  
Rollin with the rhythm I did it for my opponent  
If there was a crown to be taken yea I would own it  
Believe that my rhyme is spoken like it has to be  
With slang to stain its a sheer catastrophe  
Sheer to the point to the point its like lethal  
The dope that Im sellin is not even illegal  
But still knowck you out with clout to make you shout  
To rock the party people sho em what its all about  
Money yea is the key to all problems  
If you believe that then you should surely solve em  
cause I got the key the key to attack  
The knowledge from my dome from the top of my track  
To my foes I can show I can flow cause Im legit  
Thinkin of a new dance ice will be workin it  
  
Chorus
