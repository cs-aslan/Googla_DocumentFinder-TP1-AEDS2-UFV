Just one innocent smile that I could have missed  
Thats all it took to start all this  
One word so softly spoken when I needed it most  
Why you why right now who knows  
  
And I dont know why this is happenin  
Why it feels so right  
But I do know I dont want to say goodnight  
  
Last kiss until tomorrow out on the front porch swing  
Till then nothin means anything  
  
And I dont know why this is happenin  
Why it feels so right  
But I do know I dont want to say goodnight  
  
I cant let go when Im holdin you tight  
All I dream of is that day when we dont have to say goodnight  
  
And I dont know why this is happenin  
Why it feels so right  
But I do know I dont want to say goodnight  
And I dont know why this is happenin  
Why it feels so right  
But I do know I dont want to say goodnight  
  
Just one innocent smile that I could have missed  
Thats all it took to start all this  
Oh no I dont want to say goodnight  
Oh no I dont want to say goodnight  
Oh I dont want to say goodnight  
Oh no just want to hold you tight
