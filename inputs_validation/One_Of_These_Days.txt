Used to chase that boy home from school  
We called him freckled faced red headed fool  
He was different he wasnt cool like me  
Sticks and stones didnt break any bones  
Bet we never left well enough alone  
And one day he ran away from home you see  
And I passed him as he walked away  
And in his eyes I heard him say  
One of these days youre gonna love me  
Youll sit down by yourself and think  
About the times you pushed and shoved me  
And what good friends we mightve been  
And then youre gonna sigh a little  
Maybe even cry a little but  
One of these days youre gonna love me  
  
Patty Sue was a small town beauty  
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me  
Lord knows she shouldve seen right through me  
When I promised her the world  
But at seventeen you only want one thing  
I left her standin there with my high school ring  
Innocent tears in the pourin rain  
As I walked away  
And I still see her in my dreams  
And to this day shes whispering  
  
One of these days youre gonna love me  
Youll sit down by yourself and think  
About the time you turned from me  
And what good friends we mightve been  
And then youre gonna sigh a little  
Maybe even cry a little but  
One of these days youre gonna love me  
  
Now everybody stands up  
The congregation sings  
Its a song of sweet forgiveness  
And as the chorus rings  
The wind blows clear my memory  
The pages start to turn  
Then suddenly Im singin  
The moment that I learn  
  
One of these days Im gonna love me  
And feel the joy of sweet release  
One of these days Ill rise above me  
And at last Ill find some peace  
Then Im gonna smile a little  
Maybe even laugh a little but  
One of these days Im gonna love me
