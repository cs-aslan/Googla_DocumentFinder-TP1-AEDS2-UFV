You left me spinning like a disco  
Trying but I dont know  
If I can stand straight  
You took me left when you knew I was right  
Now I got to try to fight just to make it through the day  
  
I never knew what you were capable of  
Baby I wouldve kept my heart  
But I gave it up  
Baby I fell in love  
Now I dont know where to start  
  
Its so cold with nobody to hold me  
Youre so wrong for leaving when you told me  
You would never leave me by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere  
Now Im lost  
Trying to make it on my own  
I thought I could never do this  
But now Im walking by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere  
  
You left me broken like a record  
Baby Im baby Im hurt and I dont want to play anymore  
Missed every sign  
Believed ever lie  
And I was waiting for more  
  
I never knew what you were capable of  
Baby I wouldve kept my heart  
But I gave it up  
Baby I fell in love  
Now I dont know where to start  
  
Its so cold with nobody to hold me  
Youre so wrong for leaving when you told me  
You would never leave me by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere  
Now Im lost  
Trying to make it on my own  
I thought I could never do this alone  
But now Im walking by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere  
  
You took my heart off my sleeve  
But now Im taking it back  
Baby here I come  
You took advantage of me  
I dont appreciate that that  
You son of a gun  
  
Its so cold with nobody to hold me  
Youre so wrong for leaving when you told me  
You would never leave me by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere  
  
Its so cold with nobody to hold me  
Youre so wrong for leaving when you told me  
You would never leave me by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere  
Now Im lost  
Trying to make it on my own  
I thought I could never do this alone  
But now Im walking by myself  
Out in the middle of nowhere
