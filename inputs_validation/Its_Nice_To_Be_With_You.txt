Hey  
Look what you have done  
Showing me the sun  
And now its shining through  
Its nice to be with you  
  
Hey  
I like the things you say  
And I like the way  
You do the things you do  
Its nice to be with you  
  
Each time that I give my heart to someone new  
They just turn it blue  
But this time  
Is my time  
And my time  
Is all the time I have  
To be with you  
So please  
Never go away  
Say youre going to stay  
And make my dreams come true  
Its nice to be with you  
  
Each time that I give my heart to someone new  
They just turn it blue  
But this time  
Is my time  
And my time  
Is all the time I have  
To be with you  
So please  
Never go away  
Say youre going to stay  
And make my dreams come true  
Its nice to be with you
