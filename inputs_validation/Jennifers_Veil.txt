So youve come back for Jennifer  
You know she hides her face behind a veil  
Im warning you Frankie leave on the next train  
Your Jennifer she just isnt the same  
Quit waving that thing about Come back  
Come back and give me a chance to explain  
Your baby will never cry again  
  
So dont try to reach out  
And dont let the ships flag down  
Point the figurehead at the storm  
And drive her hard upon  
Dont stop and dont stop  
And dont let the veil drop  
Another ship ready to sailthe rigging is tight  
Tight like Jennifers veil  
  
She drew the curtain on her face  
Ever since they came and burnt the old place down  
Why is she searching through the ashes  
Why only Jennifer knows that now  
And the officer without a word  
Left all his junk and just moved out  
  
So dont try to reach out  
And dont let the ships flag down  
Point the figurehead at the glass  
Smash Smash Into shards  
Dont stop and dont touch  
And dont let the veil drop Behind Jennifers veil  
  
Oh God Frankie Is that really you  
Get back Dont reach out  
Get back and get that lantern out of my room  
  
Dont try to reach out  
And dont let the ships flag down  
Down down over her like a shroud  
  
And let her sail on the sea like a stone  
Dont touch and dont touch  
And dont let the veil drop  
Another ship ready to dock The rigging comes loose
