I hear every word they say  
They tell me to stay away  
They say Im better off without you baby  
Youve caused me nothing but pain  
  
Heartaches your middle name  
But seems I never see it coming  
Ill just admit it baby  
You really drive me crazy  
  
Let go of my heart  
Cause every time youre near me  
I cant think clearly  
Defenses fall apart  
  
I keep livin and lovin and learnin the hard way  
Youre the hardest lesson baby of my life  
I keep livin and lovin and learnin the hard way  
Someday baby I will get it right  
  
I never will understand  
Why I let you think you can  
Treat me any way you please baby  
I guess I hope someday  
  
Youll settle down and say  
Give me all the love I need baby  
Time and time Ive found  
You always let me down  
  
Always ends the same way  
Youd think that I could see the way youre treatin me  
Wont ever change  
  
I keep livin and lovin and learnin the hard way  
Youre the hardest lesson baby of my life  
I keep livin and lovin and learnin the hard way  
Someday baby I will get it right  
  
If I could just hold on if I could just be strong  
My heart would see its wrong lovin you lovin you  
  
I keep livin and lovin and learnin the hard way  
Youre the hardest lesson baby of my life  
I keep livin and lovin and learnin the hard way  
Someday baby I will get it right  
  
Livin and lovin the hard way  
Youre the hardest lesson oh baby of my life  
Livin and lovin the hard way  
Someday I will get it right
