Chorus  
Ferrari Lifestyle  
Tell the haters Im sorry  
Im passing them on the rise  
What can they say now  
Ferrari Lifestyle  
Tell the haters Im sorry  
Im passing them on the rise  
What can they say now  
I know I know I now I know  
  
Fabolous  
Yo Im such a sight to see I turn a hater to a tourist  
The way I order Rose I turn a waiter to a flourist  
Ferrari Lifestyle that mean Im living fast  
On the road to riches you dont slow down  
You give it gas  
25 is what they couldnt see us living past  
We was broke just once  
Someone give us cash  
Obama on the wrist presidential Rollie  
Beverly Hills coppin I aint Axel Foley  
Im just a young ngga moving like a Californian  
Word to proposition 19 in California  
I go from 060 a couple seconds  
She go from sober to tipsy and gettin naked  
Me and Game the 010 Crockett and Tubbs  
Trey said he gon meet us on the block of the club  
You heard Jerome but instead of a Benzo  
Get rid of your Friendsoh to ride in this Enzo  
  
Chorus  
Ferrari Lifestyle  
Tell the haters Im sorry  
Im passing them on the rise  
What can they say now  
Ferrari Lifestyle  
Tell the haters Im sorry  
Im passing them on the rise  
What can they say now  
I know I know I now I know
