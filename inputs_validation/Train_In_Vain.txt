You say you stand by your man  
Tell me something I dont understand  
You said you love me and thats a fact  
And then you left me said you felt trapped  
  
Well some things you can explain away  
But the heartaches in me till this day  
  
Chorus  
Did you stand by me  
No not at all  
Did you stand by me  
No way  
  
All the times  
When we were close  
Ill remember these things the most  
I see all my dreams come tumbling down  
I cant be happy without you around  
  
So all alone I keep the wolves at bay  
And there is only one thing that I can say  
  
Did you stand by me  
No not at all  
Did you stand by me  
No way  
  
You must explain why this must be  
Did you lie when you spoke to me  
  
Did you stand by me  
No not at all  
  
Now I got a job  
But it dont pay  
I need new clothes  
I need somewhere to stay  
But without all these things I can do  
But without your love I wont make it through  
  
But you dont understand my point of view  
I suppose theres nothing I can do  
  
Did you stand by me  
No not at all  
Did you stand by me  
No way  
  
Did you stand by me  
No not at all  
Did you stand by me  
No way  
  
You must explain why this must be  
Did you lie when you spoke to me  
  
Did you stand by me  
Did you stand by me  
No not at all  
Did you stand by me  
No way  
Did you stand by me  
No not at all  
Did you stand by me  
No way
