Oh Madonna Madonna  
  
I dont miss you  
Just who you used to be  
And you dont ring true  
So please stop calling me  
  
Your I love yous  
Are ten a penny  
Youre dropping clues  
Like youve got any  
You got to choose  
Theres been so many  
  
I love you baby  
But face it shes Madonna  
No man on Earth  
Could say that he dont want her  
  
This look of love  
Says Im leaving  
Youre frozen now  
Ive done the freezing  
Im walking out  
Madonnas calling me  
  
Shes got to be  
Obscene to be believed  
Thats her routine  
Not what she means to me  
  
I found myself by circumstance  
Across a room where people dance  
And quite by chance she danced right next to me  
  
I love you baby  
But face it shes Madonna  
No man on earth would say that he dont want her  
Its me not you  
Ive got to move on  
Youre younger too  
But shes got her groove on  
Im sorry love  
Madonnas calling me  
  
Madonna Madonna  
  
I want to tell you a secret  
  
Were having drinks  
With Kate and Stella  
Gwyneths here  
Shes brought her fella  
But all I wanna do  
Is take Madonna home  
  
I love you baby  
But face it shes Madonna  
No man on earth  
Would say that he dont want her  
  
Its me not you  
Ive got to move on  
Youre younger too  
But shes got her groove on  
Im sorry love  
Madonnas calling me
