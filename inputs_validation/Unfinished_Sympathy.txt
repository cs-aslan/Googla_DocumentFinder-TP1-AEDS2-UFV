Baby baby baby  
I know that Ive been mad in love before  
But how I can be with you  
You really hurt me baby you really cut me baby  
How could you have a day without a night  
Youre the book that I have opened  
And now Ive gotten no much more  
Baby baby  
The curiousness of your potential kiss  
Has got my mind and body aching  
You really hurt me baby you really cut me baby  
How could you have a day without a night  
Youre the book that I have opened  
And now Ive gotten no much more ohh  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Like a soul without a mind and a body without a heart  
And Im missing every part hey yeah  
Hey  
Like a soul without a mind and a body without a heart  
And Im missin every part  
Like a soul without a mind and a body without a heart  
And Im missin every part  
Like a soul without a mind and a body without a heart  
And Im missin every part  
You really hurt me baby you really hurt me baby  
Like a soul without a mind and a body without a heart  
Im missin every part  
Ohh hey
