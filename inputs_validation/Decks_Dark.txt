Chorus  
And in your life there comes a darkness  
Theres a spacecraft blocking out the sky  
And theres nowhere to hide  
You run to the back and you cover your ears  
But its the loudest sound youve ever heard  
Are we trapped Rag doll cloth people  
We are helpless to resist  
In your darkest hour  
  
Verse  
But it was just a laugh just a lie  
Just a laugh just a laugh  
Even at this angle  
And so we crumble  
A 10ton head made of wet sand  
Oh this dread circumference  
You gotta be kidding me  
The grass grows over me  
Your face in the glass in the glass  
It was just a laugh just a laugh  
Its whatever you say it is  
Split infinities  
  
Chorus  
Then into your life there comes a darkness  
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky  
And theres nowhere to hide  
You run to the back and you cover your ears  
Its the loudest sound youve ever heard  
In your darkest hour  
  
Outro  
Have you had enough of me  
Have you had enough of me  
Sweet time  
Have you had enough of me  
Have you had enough of me  
Sweet time  
Sweet time  
Sweet time  
Sweet time
