Mao Mao Mao  
  
I love the sound of smashing guitars  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Red guitars against the wall  
Big guitars can turn so small  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Show it  
  
The 6string kick inside  
The 6string kick inside  
The 6string kick inside  
  
I love the sound of breaking guitars  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Hey you long haired vintage Jesus  
Break the guitar into 1000 pieces  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Dont you  
  
The 6string kick inside  
The 6string kick inside  
  
Dont you love the sound of crashing guitars  
Dont you love the sound of crashing electric guitars  
Dont you love that sound drivin in your car  
Dont you love the sound of crashing electric guitars  
Dont you  
Dont you  
  
I love the touch of watching the stars  
I love the sound of trashing guitars  
Custom made Townshends ace  
Smash the axe and break the case  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Crashing and crashing  
  
The 6string kick inside  
The 6string kick inside  
  
I love the sound of crashing guitars
