Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Would one day walk on water  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Would save our sons and daughters  
  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Has come to make you new  
This child that youve delivered  
Will soon deliver you  
  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will give sight to a blind man  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will calm a storm with His hand  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Has walked where angels trod  
And when youve kissed your little baby  
Then youve kissed the face of God  
Oh Mary did you know  
  
Mary did you know  
The blind will see the deaf will hear  
The dead will live again  
The lame will leap the dumb will speak  
The praises of the Lamb  
  
Oh Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Is Lord of all creation  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will one day rule the nations  
  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Is heavens perfect Lamb  
And the sleeping child youre holding  
Is the great I am  
Oh Mary
