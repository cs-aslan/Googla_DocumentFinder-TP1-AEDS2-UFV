Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
  
We go where we like we got over time  
We get paid to rattle our chains  
We go in the back paint our money black  
Spend it on the enemy  
  
  
Sleepin in the church ridin in the dirt  
Put a banner over my grave  
Make a body work make a beggar hurt  
Sell me somethin big and untamed  
  
  
Now our time  
Real good time  
Now our time Now our time  
Real good time  
Now our time Said now our time  
Real good time Its a really good time  
Baby youre mine  
  
  
We know how to pray party every day  
Make a desolation of play  
Ridin in a rut till the powers cut  
We dont even have a good name  
  
  
Sleepin in the church ridin in the dirt  
Put a banner over my grave  
Make a body work make a beggar hurt  
Sell me somethin big and untamed  
  
  
Now our time Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Real good time Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Now our time Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
A real good time  
Now our time Now our time  
A real good time Yeah yeah yeah  
Baby youre mine  
  
  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
  
Now our time Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Real good time Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Now our time Said now our time  
Real good time Its a really good time  
Now our time Now our time  
Real good time Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
  
Feel good real good  
Its the same old sayin  
Feel good feel good  
Dont got no brains  
  
  
Feel good real good  
Its the same old sayin  
Feel good real good  
Dont have no brains I dont got no brains  
Baby youre mine
