Theres a hand thats old and rough  
And its holding on  
To one thats new and small  
Whose life has just begun  
Hand in hand  
Young and old  
Calm each others fears  
Christmas is almost here  
  
Theres a rocky road ahead  
Two people walk alone  
Wondering in the fading light  
If they can find their home  
When hope is almost gone  
A distant light appears  
Christmas is almost here  
  
Almost here for those in doubt  
For those who must remain  
Left behind when love goes cold  
And shifting life makes change  
  
Almost here for dreamers  
Who think that theres a chance  
That they will find their music  
And a partner for the dance  
  
Theres a dream that doesnt die  
Now we walk as one  
Justice has a gentle hand  
And love is like the sun  
  
The darkest night is past  
And by the stars we steer  
Christmas is almost here  
Christmas is almost here
