Well I aint been home for so doggone long  
I almost forgot where I come from  
Aint got no money but I still aint a bum  
Im almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
A back last summer down by the sea  
I seen a pretty girl in  
I snapped my fingers said son of a gun  
Shes almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
Some people wonder how I live  
Sometimes I pick sometimes I give  
People say Im a bum  
Im almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
I met a pretty girl up in Chicago  
She said honey baby I love you so  
She begged me to stay and not act like a bum  
Ive been almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
Friends ask me why I dont take a wife  
Settle down to a married life  
They say its good as most and its better than some  
I say Im almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
Some people wonder how I live  
  
Just the other night out in Tucson  
I had a little date with a great big blonde  
I took her home she said didnt we have fun  
Hmm almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
When its time for the final date with  
Old Saint Petes at the pearly gate  
Hell say I hope youre ready for your times come  
Ill say Im almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
Some people wonder how I live
