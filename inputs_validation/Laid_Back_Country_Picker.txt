South bound out of Shreveport heading hell bent for his grave  
He reads a sign on the barn door that says the good lord Jesus saves  
But I dont think Jesus knows him cause he aint the Jesus kind  
Hes a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind  
  
He gave the folks a good show at the Shreveport Coliseum  
They all heard hes dying so they all come out to see  
Friends and neighbors make him happy  
Lord them snuff queens treat him kind  
Hes a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind  
  
Uppers downers turn arounders picked him up and laid him down  
His old troubles keep on swimming cause their to damn mean to drown  
He keeps looking for an answer I know hes never gonna find  
Hes a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind  
  
Big Bertha back in Beaumont says he really turns her on  
She hits the floor a dancing when the DJ plays his song  
You can see somebody loves him or at least they did one time  
Hes a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind  
  
Uppers downers turn arounders picked him up and laid him down  
His old troubles keep on swimming cause their to damn mean to drown  
He keeps looking for an answer I know hes never gonna find  
Hes a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind
