Do you remember  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
How you were gonna stay free  
But they had plans for you  
And things to do  
The same thing goes for me  
Well well I never  
Saw it coming to me  
But when I turn around to look at you  
It was all that I could do  
  
To see the distance  
Everybody wants to run  
And Im no different  
Feeling like the only one  
  
In the beginning  
Everything was so close  
And it seems that everywhere you go  
Everybody knows  
You dont remember  
What you wanted to be  
Well they went round the class  
And you were last  
The clock was fast  
So noone asked  
  
To see the distance  
Everybody wants to run  
And Im no different  
Feeling like the only one  
  
Well how long can you run  
How far and what fun  
How far will you run  
To get whatever youre after  
Youre after  
Youre after  
Youre  
  
Well Ive been looking  
And I still cant see  
How we get from A to be to see  
And feel like should be  
Well Ive been running  
But Ive been running around  
Now theres nothing left  
For me to do  
But sit around  
And see the view  
  
And see the distance  
Everybody wants to run  
And Im no different  
Feeling like the only one  
  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
Do you remember
