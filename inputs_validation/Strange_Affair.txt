I had enough of this strange affair  
Tried so hard but we got nowhere  
You drag me down what you doing it for  
I cant handle it anymore  
Why oh why wont you hear me  
This information is yours for free  
Im telling you like I know I should  
Im hurt but you cant see the blood  
Well I must have been mad  
Went to the doctor I felt so sad  
Yeah I must be insane  
You turned me over again and again  
Had enough of this strange affair  
Plain to see that you just dont care  
You been fooling around for too long  
That aint the way to be carrying on  
Why oh why dont it matter to you  
Dont you know what youre putting me through  
But its over tears I have cried  
This strange affair is a thorn in my side  
Had enough of this strange affair  
I was a victim of a love so rare  
Told me lies and betrayed my trust  
Feel like a sucker with a teenage crush  
Why oh why keep leading me on  
Dont you know you been doing me wrong  
Your best friend confirmed my worst fears  
Should have known it had to end in tears
