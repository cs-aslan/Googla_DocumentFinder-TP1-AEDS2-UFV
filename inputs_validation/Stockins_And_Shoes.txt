Oh my baby goes rockin ooh rockin all night  
No shoes no stockins but thats all right  
Well she dont need stockins and shoes to rock all night  
Ooh stockins and shoes stockins and shoes  
Well you dont need stockins and shoes to dance the blues  
Well I love amy baby indeed I do  
Well I love amy baby she loves me too  
You oughta see us rock without stockins and shoes  
Ooh stockins and shoes stockins and shoes  
Well you dont need stockins and shoes to dance the blues  
Well the bare feet slappin on the hardwood floor  
These crazy things ahappen along about four  
And the very next night my babys aback for more  
Ooh stockins and shoes stockins and shoes  
Well you dont need stockins and shoes to dance the blues  
Well I bought my baby some crazy socks

Ooh stockins and shoes stockins and shoes  
Well you dont need stockins and shoes to dance the blues  
Ooh stockins and shoes stockins and shoes
