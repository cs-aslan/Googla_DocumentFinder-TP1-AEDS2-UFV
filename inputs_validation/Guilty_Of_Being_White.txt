Im sorry  
For something I didnt do  
Lynched somebody  
But I didnt know who  
  
You blame me  
For slavery  
A hundred years before I was born  
  
Repeat x4  
Guilty of being white  
  
Im sorry  
For something I didnt do  
Lynched somebody  
But I didnt know who  
  
Repeat x4  
Guilty of being white  
  
Im convicted  
Of a racist crime  
Ive only served  
19 years of my life  
  
Im sorry  
For something I didnt do  
Lynched somebody  
But I didnt know who  
  
Repeat x3  
Guilty of being white  
  
Guilty of being right
