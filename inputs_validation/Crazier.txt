Ive never gone with the wind just let it flow  
Let it take me where I want to go  
Till you open the door theres so much more  
Ive never seen it before  
I was trying to fly but I couldnt find wings  
But you came along and you changed everything  
  
Chorus  
You lift my feet off the ground  
You spin me around  
You make me crazier crazier  
Feels like Im falling and I am lost in your eyes  
You make me crazier crazier crazier  
  
I watched from a distance as you made life your own  
Every sky was your own kind of blue  
And I wanted to know how that would feel  
And you made it so real  
You showed me something that I couldnt see  
You opened my eyes and you made me believe  
  
Chorus  
You lift my feet off the ground  
You spin me around  
You make me crazier crazier  
Feels like Im falling and I am lost in your eyes  
You make me crazier crazier crazier oh  
  
Baby you showed me what livin is for  
I dont wanna hide anymore  
  
Chorus  
You lift my feet off the ground  
You spin me around  
You make me crazier crazier  
Feels like Im falling and I am lost in your eyes  
You make me crazier crazier crazier crazier crazier
