Come down off your throne and leave your body alone  
Somebody must change  
You are the reason Ive been waiting so long  
Somebody holds the key  
  
But Im near the end and I just aint got the time  
And Im wasted and I cant find my way home  
  
Come down on your own and leave your body alone  
Somebody must change  
You are the reason Ive been waiting all these years  
Somebody holds the key  
  
But Im near the end and I just aint got the time  
And Im wasted and I cant find my way home  
  
But Im near the end and I just aint got the time  
And Im wasted and I cant find my way home  
Cant find my way home  
Cant find my way home  
Cant find my way home
