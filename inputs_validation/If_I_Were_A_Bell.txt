Ask me how do I feel  
Now that were cosy and clinging  
Well sir all I can say is if I were a bell Id be ringing  
  
From the moment we kissed tonight  
Thats the way Ive just gotta behave  
Boy if I were a lamp Id light  
And If I were a banner Id wave  
  
Ask me how do I feel little me with my quiet upbringing  
Well sir all I can say is if gate Id be swinging  
And if I were a watch Id start popping my springs  
Or if I were a bell Id go ding dong ding dong ding  
  
Ask me how do I feel from this chemistry lesson Im learning  
Well sir all I can say is if I were a bridge Id be burning  
Yes I knew my moral would crack  
From the wonderful way that you looked  
Boy if I were a duck Id quack  
Or if I were a goose Id be cooked  
  
Ask me how do I feel  
Now that were fondly caressing  
Well if I were a salad I know Id be splashing my dressing  
Oh If I were a season  
I shortly be spring  
Yes or if I were a bell Id go  
Ding dong ding dong ding
