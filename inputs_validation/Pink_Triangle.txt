When Im stable long enough  
I start to look around for love  
See a sweet in floral print  
My mind begins the arrangements  
But when I start to feel that pull  
Turns out I just pulled myself  
She would never go with me  
Were I the last girl on earth  
  
Im dumb shes a lesbian  
I thought I had found the one  
We were good as married in my mind  
But married in my minds no good  
A pink triangle on her sleeve  
Let me know the truth let me know the truth  
  
Might have smoked a few in my time  
But never thought it was a crime  
Knew the day would surely come  
When Id chill and settle down  
When I think Ive found a good oldfashioned girl  
Then she put me in my place  
If everyones a little queer  
Cant she be a little straight
