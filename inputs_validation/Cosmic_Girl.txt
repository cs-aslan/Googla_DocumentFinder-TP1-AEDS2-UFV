The heart of the ocean told me youre the only one  
Youre like a rose in the snow and you need the sun  
And my heart is crying when your love is dying  
What have I got to do  
And Im tossing and turning my heart is burning  
Were more than two  
  
Youre my cosmic girl you are in my mind  
And a girl like you is so hard to find  
Youre my cosmic girl from rainbow two  
And to hell and back I will go for you  
Oh cosmic girl come hear my heart  
Ill never try to break apart  
Oh cosmic girl give me some time  
I swear youre always on my mind  
  
You are like the sunshine and I kiss away the rain  
I tell you I miss you baby cant we be friends  
Lets stay together here and forever  
Its good for me good for you  
The heart of the ocean is always in motion  
What can I do
