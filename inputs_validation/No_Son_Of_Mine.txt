Well the key to my survival  
Was never in much doubt  
The question was how I could keep sane  
Trying to find a way out  
  
Things were never easy for me  
Peace of mind was hard to find  
And I needed a place where I could hide  
Somewhere I could call mine  
  
I didnt think much about it  
Til it started happening all the time  
Soon I was living with the fear everyday  
Of what might happen that night  
  
I couldnt stand to hear the crying  
Of my mother and I remember when  
I swore that that would be the last theyd see of me  
And I never went home again  
  
They say time is a healer  
And now my wounds are not the same  
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth  
I had to hear what hed say  
  
He sat me down to talk to me  
He looked me straght in the eyes  
He said  
  
Youre no son no son of mine  
Youre no son no son of mine  
You walked out you left us behind  
And youre no son no son of mine  
  
Oh his words how they hurt me Ill never forget it  
And as the time it went by I lived to regret it  
  
Youre no son no son of mine  
But where should I go and what should I do  
Youre no son no son of mine  
But I came here for help I came here for you  
  
Well the years they passed so slowly  
I thought about him everyday  
What would I do if we passed on the street  
Would I keep running away  
  
In and out of hiding places  
Soon Id have to face the facts  
Wed have to sit down and talk it over  
And that would mean going back  
  
They say time is a healer  
And now my wounds are not the same  
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth  
I had to hear what hed say  
  
He sat me down to talk to me  
He looked me straght in the eyes  
He said  
  
Youre no son no son of mine  
Youre no son no son of mine  
When you walked out you left us behind  
And youre no son no son of mine  
  
Oh his words how they hurt me Ill never forget it  
And as the time it went by I lived to regret it  
  
Youre no son no son of mine  
But where should I go and what should I do  
Youre no son no son of mine  
But I came here for help I was looking for you
