When I feel that chill smell that fresh cut grass  
Im back in my helmet cleats and shoulder pads  
Standing in the huddle listening to the call  
Fans going crazy for the boys of fall  
  
They didnt let just anybody in that club  
Took every ounce of heart and sweat and blood  
To get to wear those gameday jerseys down the hall  
The kings of the school man were the boys of fall  
  
Well its turn to face the stars and stripes  
Its fighting back them butterflies  
Its call it in the air alright  
Yes sir we want the ball  
And its knocking heads and talking trash  
Its slinging mud and dirt and grass  
Its I got your number I got your back  
When your backs against the wall  
You mess with one man you got us all  
The boys of fall  
  
In little towns like mine thats all theyve got  
Newspaper clippings fill the coffee shops  
The old men will always think they know it all  
Young girls will dream about the boys of fall  
  
Well its turn and face the stars and stripes  
Its fighting back them butterflies  
Its call it in the air alright  
Yes sir we want the ball  
And its knocking heads and talking trash  
Its slinging mud and dirt and grass  
Its I got your number I got your back  
When your backs against the wall  
You mess with one man you got us all  
The boys of fall  
  
Well its turn and face the stars and stripes  
Its fighting back them butterflies  
Its call it in the air alright  
Yes sir we want the ball  
And its knocking heads and talking trash  
Its slinging mud and dirt and grass  
Its I got your number I got your back  
When your backs against the wall  
You mess with one man you got us all  
The boys of fall  
  
Were the boys of fall  
Were the boys of fall
