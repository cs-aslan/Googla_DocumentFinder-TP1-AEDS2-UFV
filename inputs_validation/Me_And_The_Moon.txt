Theres not a star left in the sky tonight  
That hasnt been wished on  
And Ive been wishin I could find me a wishin well  
Id throw in every penny I own  
  
Ive got moonlight and a warm June night  
All thats missing here is you  
Me and the moon have never been so blue  
If I may I wish I might find you lying beside me  
  
In a way  
I can see your eyes in the stars  
But its not the same  
I want to see the stars in your eyes tonight  
  
To be the stars in your eyes tonight  
Just me and the stars in your eyes tonight  
But its me and the moon  
It seems if you believe in a dream enough  
  
It has to come true  
And mine would turn back time til the world unwinds  
If I could be holding you  
So if a star falls from the sky tonight  
  
Youll know what I tried to do  
Me and the moon have never been so blue  
If I may I wish I might find you lying beside me  
In a way  
  
I can see your eyes in the stars  
But its not the same  
I want to see the stars in your eyes tonight  
To be stars in your eyes tonight  
  
Just me and the stars in your eyes tonight  
Not me and the moon  
And If I may I wish I might find you lying beside me  
In a way  
  
I can see your eyes in the stars  
But its not the same  
I want to see the stars in your eyes tonight  
To be the stars in your eyes tonight  
  
Just me and the stars in your eyes tonight  
But its me and the moon  
And me and the moon have never been so blue
