The streets here are empty all the people went home  
Well I was just wondering if youre alone  
So how youve been lately I hear youre a little down  
And do you think maybe I could come around  
  
Chorus  
I could be someone you need  
Wrap you in blankets on dark winter nights  
Be your best confidante pay the right compliment  
I could be someone you need  
  
We had coffee on 3rd Street and talked for a time  
I still have your letter I know every line  
I hope this aint coming from way out of the blue  
Cause I got to thinking and I thought of you  
  
Chorus  
  
You need someone there when the world isnt fair  
Or its all just too good to be true  
Someone to care for you issue a dare to you  
When the moment comes you need to fly fly  
  
Chorus
