Children cry on the street  
They dont have enough to eat  
Mothers wait for days to end  
A hopeless situation they cant mend  
  
Is it good for you  
Is it good for me  
I dont know how the world can sleep  
Its just not right to close the door turn out the light  
  
Chorus  
Theyd better be the ones you love  
The children ought to get some love  
If noone else should get enough  
Theyd better be the ones you love  
  
Daddy waits there in line  
A little work he hopes to find  
Something wrong with times like these  
Its enough to bring a man down to his knees  
  
Is it good for you  
Is it good for me  
I dont know how the world can sleep  
Its just not right to close the door turn out the light  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Thinking of the children  
You better be think about the children  
Better be you better be  
Better be the ones you love  
Better be you better be  
Better be the ones you love  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Is it good for you  
Is it good for me  
I dont know how the world can sleep  
Its just not right to close the door turn out the light  
  
Theyd better be the ones you love  
The children ought to get some love  
If noone else should get enough  
Theyd better be the ones you love
