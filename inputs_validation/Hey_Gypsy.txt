Hey gypsy hey gypsy come on home  
Even if its just to paint your wagon  
Old hobo how long can this go on  
Shes mending socks and sittin home a naggin  
Hey outlaw lets spend some time together she said outlaw  
It does matter whether were alone come on home  
  
Hey drifter has your feeling for her gone  
Have you spent too many night out on the highway  
Hey loner she said hit the road and sing your songs  
It wont be long until I have your baby  
Hey outlaw lets spend some time together  
Hey drifter hey gypsy hey outlaw hey drifter  
Hey loner hey outlaw hey hobo hey drifter  
Hey gypsy hey gypsy
