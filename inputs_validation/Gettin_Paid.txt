We blowin money bitch  
I go hard I go hard gettin paid  
I go hard I go hard gettin paid  
  
We dont even count the money no more we just blow it  
We spend it all up  
We dont even count the money no more we just throw it  
And make em pick it all up  
  
Money strapped to my waist  
Somewhere in the whip Im in with no bass  
Flooded the trap I need a new place  
Money got to go I told em theres no space  
Never love hoes hoes I dont chase  
Only wear locs the same as my race  
All I know is stunt make a hater feel like shit to the point  
That he in another place Real talk  
III aint the one but I lean on haters looking so clean on gator  
Try to jack me I guarantee Ill put the beam on haters  
Hood nigga when I come to this Im stocked up  
Shit on my wrist tryna light this block up  
Nigga said I got a dope man swag take a look at these jewels  
Every one of em rocked up  
And we still on the corner packed in  
Ace town president somethin back then  
Hope the slut that Im with got insurance so  
She know Im about to run up on her back end  
Like I set of bad she was gettin plugged  
Can take it to the streets take it to the club  
I dont rubber band shit I got trash bags  
Niggas make it rain Ima make it flood  
I aint gonna talk shit Ima talk bread  
I f a hater dont like it tell em drop dead  
Im in the hood like a fresh set of projects  
Where they either rock blue or they rock red  
Im the king of the streets  
Aint nobody finna take away what I came to get  
Audi R8 that I came is sick with interior the color of a all white  
  
We dont even count the money no more we just blow it  
We spend it all up  
We dont even count the money no more we just throw it  
And make em pick it all up  
We dont even count the money no more we just blow it  
We spend it all up  
We dont even count the money no more we just throw it  
And make em pick it all up  
  
Big weed in my joint diss me theres no point  
Lil guy but still all my nggas got big heat they on point  
Rollin up while I drive engine be in the trunk  
Decided in 2005 that I can fuck any bitch that I want  
Ooh and and and I aint trying to stunt  
This a two seater my bitch cant help but ride up in the front  
Ballin most nggas wont try to pick em up  
Throwin so much money you even try to pick some up  
You tryin different stuff look at how I block em out  
Smoke like a Cali nigga even when Im in the south  
And when when my car come out the whores come out  
Dont even get on twitter no more  
cause Im what your bitch talkin bout  
  
We dont even count the money no more we just blow it  
We spend it all up  
We dont even count the money no more we just throw it  
And make em pick it all up  
We dont even count the money no more we just blow it  
We spend it all up  
We dont even count the money no more we just throw it  
And make em pick it all up
