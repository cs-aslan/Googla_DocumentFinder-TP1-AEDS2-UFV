City sidewalks busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air theres a feeling of Christmas  
  
Hear the snow crunch see the kids rush  
This is Santas big day  
And above all this bustle you hear  
  
Silver bells silver bells  
Its Christmas time in the city  
Ringaling hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
City sidewalks busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air theres a feeling of Christmas  
  
Children laughing people passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
Very soon it will be Christmas day
