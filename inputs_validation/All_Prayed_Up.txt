Im all prayed up Im ready to meet my Savior  
Eternal life is waitin in the by and by  
Im all prayed up my faith will never waiver  
Heavens doors gonna swing wide open when I die  
I made my peace with Jesus a long long time ago  
Trusted in Him that He would save my soul  
I walked up there beside Him He guides me me on my way  
And I know He hears me when I kneel and pray  
Im all prayed up Im ready to meet my Savior  
Eternal life is waitin in the by and by  
Im all prayed up my faith will never waiver  
Heavens doors gonna swing wide open when I die  
Now I aint afraid of Satan his wicked ways of sin  
They tempted me but he couldnt pull me in  
When Ive gone to live with Jesus face my judgment day  
Hell fulfill for me the promise that He made  
Im all prayed up Im ready to meet my Savior  
Eternal life is waitin in the by and by  
Im all prayed up my faith will never waiver  
Heavens doors gonna swing wide open when I die  
Im all prayed up Im ready to meet my Savior  
Eternal life is waitin in the by and by  
Im all prayed up my faith will never waiver  
Heavens doors gonna swing wide open when I die  
Im all prayed up my faith will never waiver  
Heavens doors gonna swing wide open when I die
