Oh wont you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride

Well Im flying across land  
Trying to get a hand  
Playing in a travelling band  
  
Take me to the hotel baggage car no where  
Come on come on wont you get me to my room

Playing in a travelling band eeya  
Well Im flying across the land  
Trying to get a hand  
Playing in a travelling band

Trying to get a hand  
Playing in a travelling band Ohwow

Hell will come again on a Saturday night  
Oh with your fussing and your fighting
