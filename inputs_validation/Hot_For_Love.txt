Twentyfour hours of the day  
Youre on my trail  
And I cant get away  
I cant shake you off  
Youre a wolf on the prowl  
You got my scent and I can hear you howl  
  
No where to run  
No where to hide  
No where to go  
No where to run to  
No where to hide this hurt inside  
  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
  
When the sun goes down  
I can feel your heat  
Till the sun comes up  
When youve got me worn deadbeat  
I said Im all burned out  
Im a physical wreck  
But there you go again with your  
Hot breath on my neck  
  
No where to run  
No where to hide  
No where to go  
No where to run to  
No where to hide this hurt inside  
  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
  
No where to run  
No where to run  
No where to run to  
No where to run  
  
No where to run  
No where to hide  
No where to go  
No where to run to  
No where to hide this hurt inside  
  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Oh baby hot for love  
Yes youre hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love  
Hot for love
