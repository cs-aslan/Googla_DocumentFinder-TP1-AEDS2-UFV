Would you like to take  
This magic potion with me  
On a trip to a cosmic  
Playground far beyond  
She understands  
Shes been before  
Its in her hands  
To find the door  
  
Sweet Lorraine  
Let the party carry on  
You and I will swim the sea  
Sweet Lorraine  
Let the party carry on  
You and I can feel the breeze  
  
There is no time no wealth  
Only I surround you  
The fortune of this guide  
Is simply sincerity  
She understands  
Cause shes been before  
Its in her hands  
To find the door so
