If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
Why dont I dream  
Anymore  
Ive tried to tell myself  
Nothings changed my dear  
But I look around me  
And think maybe thats not so  
I only have nightmares  
  
And wake up with cold sweat  
Coming through my pores  
Why dont I dream anymore  
Im in the garden  
All the trees bear fruit  
I have to pick them before they fall  
I finally grab one  
I hold it in my hand  
I open it up  
  
Its rotten to the core  
Why dont I dream anymore  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
Why dont I dream  
Anymore  
We lose our patience  
Lose our trust  
Yes we lose our innocence  
  
To forget our sorrow and hide our pain  
We lose old memories  
But dreams are what lifes worth living for  
I wish I could dream  
Once more  
Im in the garden  
All the trees bear fruit  
I have to pick them before they fall  
I finally grab one  
  
I hold it in my hand  
I open it up  
Its rotten to the core  
Why dont I dream anymore  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
Why dont I dream anymore  
Ive tried to tell myself  
Its all for the best my dear  
  
But I look around me and think  
Maybe thats not so  
I only have nightmares  
Wake up in a cold sweat  
Have I become as corrupt  
As all I abhor  
Im in the garden  
All the trees bear fruit  
I have to pick them before they fall  
I finally grab one  
I hold it in my hand  
  
I open it up  
Its rotten to the core  
Why dont I dream anymore  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
I dont want anymore
