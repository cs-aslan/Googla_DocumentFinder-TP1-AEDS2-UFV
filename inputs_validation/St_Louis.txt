St Louis song  
Something is wrong  
I kill that man  
From your own shoulders down  
And here comes an empty  
People look at each other like me  
  
I dont wanna be  
I dont want to be hehere  
I dont wanna be  
I dont want to be hehere  
Cause theres nothing  
Here to be  
  
St Louis song  
Where has the good thing gone  
Dreaming himself to hell  
Stuck in his good cell  
Hes still trying to suffer  
Left handed stop  
  
I dont wanna be  
I dont want to be hehere  
I dont wanna be  
I dont want to be hehere  
  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
  
Im not trying to suffer  
Left handed stop  
  
I dont wanna be  
I dont want to be hehere  
I dont wanna be  
I dont want to be hehere  
I dont wanna be  
I dont want to be hehere  
I dont wanna be  
I dont want to be hehere
