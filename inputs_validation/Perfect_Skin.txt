I choose my friends only far too well  
Im up on the pavement theyre all down in the cellar  
With their government grants and my IQ  
They brought me down to size academia blues  
Louise is a girl I know her well  
Shes up on the pavement yes shes a weather girl  
And Im staying up here so I may be undone  
Shes inappropriate but then shes much more fun and  
When she smiles my way  
My eyes go out in vain  
Shes got perfect skin  
Shame on you youve got no sense of grace shame on me  
Ah just in case I might come to a conclusion  
Other than that which is absolutely necessary  
And thats perfect skin  
Louise is the girl with the perfect skin  
She says turn on the light otherwise it cant be seen  
Shes got cheekbones like geometry and eyes like sin  
And shes sexually enlightened by cosmopolitan and  
When she smiles my way  
My eyes go out in vain  
For her perfect skin  
Yeah thats perfect skin  
She takes me down to the basement to look at her slides  
Of her family life pretty weird at times  
At the age of ten she looked like greta garbo  
And I loved her then but how was she to know that  
When she smiles my way  
My eyes go out in vain  
Shes got perfect skin  
Up eight flights of stairs to her basement flat  
Pretty confused huh being shipped around like that  
Seems we climbed so high now were down so low  
Strikes me the moral of this song must be there never has been one
