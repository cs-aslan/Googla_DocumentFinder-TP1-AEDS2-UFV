Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
  
I feel it inside down in my soul  
And I just cant hide these things I know  
We could be friends  
And I promise that it wont go bad  
But hopefully this story ends  
But you aint got nothing I never had  
So lets take it slow  
  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
  
Someone must have loved you  
Not the way that I do  
Youre missing what Im trying to say  
Aint nothing getting in my way  
  
So tell me thats fantastic  
  
And promise me youll always try  
I find it so romantic  
When you look into my beautiful eyes  
And lose control  
  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
Who let you go  
  
I dont know what it means  
But Ive been wondering  
Who let you go  
  
And honey when you walk my way  
It makes me wanna say  
Ohhhh  
  
Shalalala shalalala  
Shalalala shalalala  
Shalalala shalalala  
Shlalalalalala
