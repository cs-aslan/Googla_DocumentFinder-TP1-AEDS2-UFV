Ive got my wife the other women  
And the whiskey killing me  
The first two make it so that I see red  
The third one makes it so that I cant see  
If I had half a brain left after my debauchery  
Id give up the other women and the WIFE  
Wedding vows werent made to be broken  
These here lips werent made to tell no lies  
Somewhere along the way I guess I must have gone astray  
Cause Im drinking here and wishing for to die  
Ive got my wife the other women  
And the whiskey killing me  
The first two make it so that I see red  
The third one makes it so that I cant see  
If I had half a brain left after my debauchery  
Id give up the other women and the WIFE  
Its just like my little sister told me  
Dear old momma  
In the end you reap what you sow  
Ive been sowing seeds from Mexico to Tennessee  
And Im reaping now an awful lot of woe  
Ive got my wife the other women  
And the whiskey killing me  
The first two make it so that I see red  
The third one makes it so that I cant see  
If I had half a brain left after my debauchery  
Id give up the other women and the WIFE  
Id give up the other women and the WIFE
