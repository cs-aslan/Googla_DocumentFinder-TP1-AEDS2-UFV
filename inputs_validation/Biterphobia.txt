Dj scratching  Do it  
  
Eminem  
  
Sneakin in through the back door fruity mcs get ambushed  
Rammed and squooshed slammed and pushed crammed and mushed  
Then Im movin on down from the right to left  
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death  
To get jacked attacked and cracked in two  
Smackin through til youre black and blue for actin true  
Im dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands  
Proof that I be sniffin on aerosol cans  
Im stompin Im kickin Im chokin Im stampin em  
Clompin em stickin and pokin and clampin em  
To electric chairs and tightenin bolts  
Hit em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts  
Im zappin rappers singers and dancers  
Faster than you could snap your figures for ransom  
Cancer is in the flesh alive and breathin  
Survivin by connivin and theivin  
  
Dj scratching  Do it Eat em up

I had a dream I was gettin jacked by biters  
It felt like I was bein attacked by spiders  
Developin a fear of biterphobia  
Im holdin a gas can and lighter over ya  
If I detect ya Ima pulverize  
Dissect your brain diggin in your skull for lies  
And Ima torture with material iller  
Than a stark ravin mad serial killer  
Im more dangerous than a loaded chamber is  
A major risk to a plagiarist  
So beware of the aura A terror for the horrible  
Will scare ya tomorrow is the airbourne assault of the rappers  
Hit the source to better my skills  
I head for the border  
And run the Galloping Hills the choice is yours  
Cause now buddys noises force me to scream til my voice is hoarse  
Cause Im sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage
yours to bite like labradors  
In the range of my doublebarrel  
And your life is in danger trouble and peril

I trample and stamp liars like they were campfires  
Cuz vampires right on my balls and clamp pliers  
And swing on my big thingamajig  
So Im bringin my nig Proof for backup when I sing at my gig  
Cause biters are fallin head over heels  
In love with every rhyme that Ive said over reels  
Thats how I became paranoid  
Chewin my fingernails pullin my hair annoyed  
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate  
So Im forced to hit a little quicker with  
An ultimatum I assault and slayed em  
With rhymes and its ultimatum just to cultivate em  
Energetic and imaginative  
Pronouns and verbs predicates and adjectives  
Will reach out and grab ya 9 times outta 10  
Thats why Im spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen  
  
Dj scratching  Everybody walk out the back door
