My dream sonata is the music I hear  
Each night when all the world is deep in slumber  
And in my dreams my darling you appear  
While the musics playing I hear you say  
I love you I love you  
  
My dream sonata has the beauty of prayer  
A prayer my lonely heart has set to music  
That when I wake my darling youll be there  
But when I awaken youre gone it seems  
Like my sonata you are only in my dreams  
  
My dream sonata has the beauty of prayer  
A prayer my lonely heart has set to music  
That when I wake my darling youll be there  
But when I awaken youre gone it seems  
Like my sonata you are only in my dreams
