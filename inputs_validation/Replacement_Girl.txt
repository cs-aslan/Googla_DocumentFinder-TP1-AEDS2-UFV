EchoTrey Songz  
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement  
  
Verse 1Drake  
Lat me show what it is  
I was born up top but was raised at the bottom of the map  
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap  
If you lookin for the goods then we got in the trap like  
Trey  
Ooo wee  
Drake  
Took em from white snakes to  
Trey  
Ooo wee  
Drake  
This metaphore might sound a little confusing but  
Trey  
Yall dont really even know me yeah yeah  
Drake  
I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that stayed in  
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say its sittin at
amazing  
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us  
Hear em all screamin then its probably is  
But I cant blame females females cant really ignore something this obvious  
What you really expect when I strut through town  
Two or three days I shut you down  
Chilin wit the homie Trey Songz  
You call him the prince he rep two up two down  
Anyone I know get used to me  
Im far from the man that I used to be  
I dont ever really kick game  
I know you find it impressing whenever you introduced to me  
Cause Im a good dude who take pride in that  
Need good lovin Im providing that  
Understand that Im worldwide  
You get who you want it wherever you be residing at  
Cause I do things from the Mtown  
To the uk  
From Spain back out to Texas  
This albums for my fans  
But yo this hook is for my exes  
  
ChorusTrey Songz  
This one is for you girl  
You know who you are girl  
You only show youre face  
Cause you know that Im a star girl  
What you trying to to make it  
Dont ever mistake it  
Cause my time is limited and I aint trying to waste it all on you  
You had a chance now Its gone  
Oooooh  
You had a man now you dont  
Back to the basics  
I think I made it  
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl  
  
Verse 2Trey Songz  
Aint ya never seen a yougin so fly  
Lookin for someone your type  
I done left behind the love of my life  
Tryin to find another one tonight  
And if its you baby  
Let yourself be seen  
Don matter skirts  
Dresses or jeans  
I got that work  
Know what I mean  
And Im flexing on my ex if you know what mean  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3Drake  
Check this out  
From the that she get picked for some take out  
Until they slip up and break out  
But its another story over here at Drakes house  
Cause Im dripped up and Im drapped out  
And Im lean back  
Scoping  
Looking for a woman that I should wife  
Who got just the right amount of loyalty  
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life  
We go la va  
Ny to  
Sunshine in that heat stroke  
And them fur hoods in that deep snow  
We have breakfast in the bedroom  
Break bread downstairs in the basement  
Since Jay and Kelz aint doing the thing no more  
Guess me and the boy Songz is the replacement  
  
Chorus  
  
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay  
Ay Ay Ay  
Lets Go
