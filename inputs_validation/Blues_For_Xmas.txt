Blues for XMas  
Baby I aint got a feakin dime  
Im just aint and theyre wasted  
I hang my head down baby  
Im cryin

Santa Clause  
Bring my Baby back on home  
See I aint got a lot of money  
But my baby shes rich enough for us both  
Blues for XMas  
Im as blue as I can be  
Blues for XMas  
Baby Im as blue as I can be

Tryin to drink my Baby back to me  
Tryin to drink my Baby back  
Santa Clause

Blues for XMas  
Aint no time to be home all alone  
I cant lose these XMas Blues  
Baby I just cant seem to shake off  
Held so many arms  
All I seem to do is break em  
Yeah break em  
I said I break em Baby
