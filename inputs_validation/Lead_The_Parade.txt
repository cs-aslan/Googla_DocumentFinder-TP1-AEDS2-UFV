Lost and alone  
Im out of the stone  
Locate this process everyday  
Nothings my own  
The dreams that Ive grown  
I wont control and throw away  
  
I need to make the decisions  
I need to make it right  
I need to lead the parade  
Or this shit will fucking take my life  
  
I want to kill the decisions  
I want to make it right  
I want to pass this test  
And complete my tormented life  
  
This curse is my own  
It followed me home  
Its like a child that wants to play  
The thoughts in my brain  
The subconscious pain  
Makes me think why do I stay  
  
I need to make the decision  
I need make it right  
I need to lead the parade  
Or this shit will take my life  
  
I want to kill the decisions  
I want to make it right  
I want to pass this test  
And complete my tormented life  
  
I want to kill the decisions  
I want it to be right  
I want to pass this test  
And complete this tormented life  
  
Happy everything was wonderful  
So happy its beautiful  
  
I need to make the decision  
I need to make it right  
I want to kill the decisions  
I want to make it right  
I want to pass this test  
And complete my tormented life  
I want to kill the decisions  
I want to make it right  
I want to pass this test  
And complete my tormented life  
  
Im happy I knew youd make it right  
Everything is wonderful
