I used to love her but I had to kill her  
I used to love her but I had to kill her  
I had to put her six feet under and I can still hear her complain  
  
I used to love her but I had to kill her  
I used to love her but I had to kill her  
I knew Id miss her so I had to keep her  
Shes buried right in my back yard  
  
I used to love her but I had to kill her  
I used to love her but I had to kill her  
She bitched so much She drove me nuts and now Im happier this way  
I used to love her but I had to kill her and I can still hear her complain
