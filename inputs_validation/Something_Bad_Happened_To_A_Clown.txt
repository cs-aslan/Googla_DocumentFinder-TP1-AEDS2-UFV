Written by Warren Zevon 1995 Zevon Music BMI  
Every touch is measured out  
Every word is written down  
Sunny skies are seldom seen  
In the land of few and far between  
And everybody wears a frown  
Someone lost their squirting rose  
Theres his red nose on the ground  
No ones seen his painted smile  
Hes been gone for quite a while  
Something bad happened to a clown  
Something bad happened to a clown  
He used to honk his horn and everyone would laugh  
He used to honk his horn  
She doesnt think hes very funny anymore  
Footprints in the sawdust leading to the edge of town  
Something bad happened to a clown  
Something bad happened to a clown  
He used to honk his horn and everyone would laugh  
He used to honk his horn  
She doesnt think hes very funny anymore  
Footprints in the sawdust leading to the edge of town  
Something bad happened to a clown  
Something bad happened to a clown
