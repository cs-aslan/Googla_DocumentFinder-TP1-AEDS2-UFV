Remember when  
Never needed each other  
The best of friends  
Like sister and brother  
We understood  
Wed never be alone  
  
Those days are gone  
Now I want you so much  
The night is long  
And I need your touch  
Dont know what to say  
Never meant to feel this way  
Dont want to be  
Alone tonight  
  
Chorus  
What can I do to make you mine  
Falling so hard so fast this time  
What did I say  
What did you do  
How did I fall in love with you  
  
I hear your voice  
And I start to tremble  
Brings back the child that  
I resemble  
  
I cannot pretend  
That we can still be friends  
Dont want to be  
Alone tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
I want to say this right  
And it has to be tonight  
Just need you to know  
  
I dont want to live this life  
I dont want to say goodbye  
With you I want to spend  
The rest of my life  
  
Chorus  
  
What can I do to make you mine  
Falling so hard so fast this time  
Everythings changed  
We never knew  
How did I fall in love with you
