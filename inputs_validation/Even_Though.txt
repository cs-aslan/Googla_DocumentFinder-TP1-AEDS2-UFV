Something about the way he touched me  
Was so slow the way he put his arms around me  
Even though Im feeling lonely  
Im Im feeling lonely  
  
Dont understand the words he said  
Made me do wrong  
But now theres nothing thats in my head  
And though its strong I wish hed leave me alone  
I wish hed leave me  
  
Cause I know trouble will follow  
But I have to go  
I have to go  
  
Cause I know trouble will follow  
But I have to go  
But I have to go  
  
He makes me think that I dont know me  
So Ill show him what I remember all the things he showed me  
And I want more  
Im feeling lonely  
Oh Im feeling lonely
