Nothings gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me  
Nothings gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me  
  
Its the middle of the night 3 am Im waiting  
For the cell phone by my bed to ring Im acting like a fool  
The alarm on my clock rings just like a fairy tale  
Even if I find the glass slipper itll be no good  
If its too much trouble for you to care then let me know soon  
Even I dont have that much time  
Im movin on without you  
  
I cant pretend anymore  
That I dont know about your stupid alibis  
We didnt always have these kind of memories  
It shouldnt have been painful  
Why  
Maybe it was to soon to play a good girl  
  
Nothings gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me  
  
The lines I planned to say were perfect  
But I still cant get through its 4 am  
When the nights too quiet my thoughts get restless  
I understand but I still cant get enough sleep  
Ive forgotten that promise  
Ill give you back your ring so give me back my heart  
I have to go on without you  
  
Its hard so Ill be the one to break up  
Its not good playing a good girl  
It shouldnt have been painful  
Why  
Maybe it was to soon to play a good girl  
  
Nothings gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me  
  
Even if its confusing I want to be loved  
Without saying it I want you to understand  
It shouldnt have been painful  
Why  
Maybe it was to soon to play a good girl  
  
Nothings gonna stop me  
Only you can stop me
