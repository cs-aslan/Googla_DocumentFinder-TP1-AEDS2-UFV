Theres a light a different kind of light  
When we close we close our eyes  
Theres a place a distant kind of place  
We cant let go just cant let go  
  
Theres a faith a stronger kind of faith  
It makes you try just a little harder  
Theres a time a lonely kind of time  
When you know you simply know  
  
That you just cant fake it  
  
A mothers son knows he never walks alone  
No matter what hes become  
Hard as he tries he can never give it back  
Lifes too short for a mothers son  
  
Theres a rage a silent kind of rage  
It makes you live out on the edge  
Theres a pain a different kind of pain  
Knowing time will change everything  
  
You just cant fake it  
  
A mothers son knows he never walks alone  
No matter what hes become  
Hard as he tries he can never give it back  
Lifes too short for a mothers son  
  
You just cant fake it  
  
A mothers son knows he never walks alone  
No matter what hes become  
Hard as he tries he can never give it back  
Lifes too short for a mothers son  
  
Theres a light a different kind of light
