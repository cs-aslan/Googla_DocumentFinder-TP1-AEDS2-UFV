Its beautiful your honesty  
You cry when you need to  
You say what you feel  
Youre never afraid to wear your heart on your sleeve  
Youre always so open with me  
  
Its in your voice I can hear it  
The sound of a woman in love  
  
Chorus  
Only a woman can love you so much  
Give you her life and give you her trust  
Not any woman can do what you do  
Only a woman like you  
  
Its magical your love for me  
Its more than a man could ever receive  
Im just a man and its hard to believe  
A woman like you could love me  
  
Its in your eyes I can see it  
The look of a woman in love  
  
Chorus  
  
If only I could find the words to say  
But I just cant so forgive me  
Cause you took the words away  
You answered every prayer I always prayed  
  
Its in your touch I can feel it  
The feeling of a woman in love
