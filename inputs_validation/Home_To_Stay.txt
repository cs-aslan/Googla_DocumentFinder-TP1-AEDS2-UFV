I know youre gone  
I watched you leave  
I always thought  
That it was me  
You made it clear  
With that last kiss  
You couldnt live a life  
With maybes and whatifs  
  
When every boat  
Has sailed away  
And every path  
Is marked and paved  
When every road  
Has had its say  
Then Ill be bringing you back  
Home to stay  
  
I have the cards you sent to me  
You wrote of trains and Paris galleries  
This spring youll draw  
Canals and frescoed walls  
Look how far your dreamings gone  
  
When every town looks just the same  
When every choice gets hard to make  
When every map is put away  
Then Ill be bringing you back  
Home to stay  
  
And now I know why you had to go alone  
Isnt there a place between  
  
When every boat  
Has sailed away  
And every path  
Is marked and paved  
  
When every road  
Has had its say  
Then Ill be bringing you back  
Home to stay  
  
Reach out to me  
Call out my name  
And I would bring you back again  
Today
