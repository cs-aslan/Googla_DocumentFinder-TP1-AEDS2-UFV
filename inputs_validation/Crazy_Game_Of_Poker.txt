And the man to my left has folded down  
Well johnny doubled up with a royal flush  
I had three jacks and a pair of nines  
My mind is turning  just two shots more

And I walked into the bar yesterday  
Cause I had something to do something to say  
And Johnny walked in right behind me and I didnt turn around  
Til I heard the sound of his feet falling on the ground  
I looked over my shoulder and I saw a clown  
And I said whatcha doin in the bar tonight  
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight  
He looked at me with a face full of fright  
And I said how bout a revolution  
And he said right

He hit me across the face with a bat  
I grabbed my 45 and I said lets get out and go  
So he opened the door and said do what youre here for  
I said Im wandering round the road four to four  
And I said I been walking for about a thousand years  
And my feet are growing tired  
My eyes a little wired  
Dont know what to do unless I retire  
And he just said lets play some crazy poker  
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight  
He looked at me with a face full of fright  
And I said how bout a revolution  
And he said right

I said that was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw  
But Im not gonna quit and Im not gonna stop  
Dont give a shit cause I got the drop  
Johnny just got two eyes just like mine  
And Im feeling kinda funky kinda fine  
And I drank a bottle of whiskey fore I came  
Came to the bar to see whats the same  
I saw my man named Johnny sittin across the table from me  
And to my left was a man he had no chance  
Didnt really think about starting a scene  
The man to my right wasnt feeling kinda nice  
He looked kinda mad and I felt bad  
Beacuse I took his money last night its kinda funny  
But now Im just struggling  
I need a honeybunny  
I dont know what to say anymore  
So Im just gonna go out anywho  
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight  
He looked at me with a face full of fright  
And I said how bout a revolution  
And he said right
