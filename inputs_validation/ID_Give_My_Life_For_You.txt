You who I cradled in my arms  
You  
Asking as little as you can  
Little snip of a little man  
I know Id give my life for you  
  
You didnt ask me to be born  
You  
Why should you learn of war or pain  
To be sure youre not hurt again  
I swear Id give my life for you  
  
Ive tasted love beyond all fear  
And you should know its love that brought you here  
And in one perfect night  
When the stars burned like new  
I knew what I must do  
Ill give you a million things Ill never own  
Ill give you a world to conquer when youre grown  
  
You will be who you want to be  
You  
Can choose whatever heaven grants  
As long as you can have your chance  
I swear Ill give my life for you  
  
Sometimes I wake up reaching for him  
I feel his shadow brush my head  
But theres just moonlight on my bed  
Was he a ghost  
Was he a lie  
That made my body laugh and cry  
Then by my side the proof I see his little one  
Gods of the sun  
Bring him to me  
  
You will be who you want to be  
You  
Can choose whatever heaven grants  
As long as you can have your chance  
I swear Ill give my life for you  
  
No one can stop what I must do  
I swear Ill give my life for you
