Halfcaste from Man and His music Volume II  
  
I got a girl in Brixham town  
Her daddy dont like me hangin round  
The boy aint black the boy is brown  
Dont he know its a halfcaste town  
Big smoke  
Big smoke  
Big smoke  
Big smoke  
The boy is halfcaste  
Halfcaste  
Halfcaste  
I got a girl up near Richmond way  
Her daddy dont like me to lead the girl astray  
The brown boy is born to serve he say  
Dont he know its a different day  
In the big smoke  
No joke  
Big smoke  
I like it  
Big smoke  
Big smoke  
Mister Im halfcaste  
You see Im halfcaste

You see Im halfcaste  
Halfcaste
