Out in Black Mountain a child will smack your face  
Im saying out on Black Mountain a child will smack your face  
The babies cryin for liquor and all the birds sing bass  
Well those people in Black Mountain are mean as they can be  
And those people in Black Mountain are mean as they can be  
Now they uses gun powder just to sweeten up their tea  
Well out in Black Mountain you cant keep a good man in jail  
Yeah out in Black Mountain you cant keep a good man in jail  
Cause if the jury convicts him the judge will pay his bail  
I had a man in Black Mountain the sweetest man in town  
I had a man in Black Mountain the sweetest man in the town  
But then he met a city gal thats when he throwed me down  
Lord Im bound for Black Mountain me and my razor and my gun  
Im going back to Black Mountain me and my razor and my gun  
Im gonna fire him if he stands still Ill just cut him if he runs  
Lord now youve heard my story now youve heard my news  
Lord now youve heard my story now youve heard my news  
Now my man can clear off Ive got the Blackest Mountain blues
