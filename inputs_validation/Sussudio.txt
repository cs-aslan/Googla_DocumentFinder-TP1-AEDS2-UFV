Theres this girl thats been on my mind  
All the time Sussudio oh oh  
Now she dont even know my name  
But I think she likes me just the same

I feel so good if I just say the word  
Sussudio just say the word  
Oh Sussudio

She makes me nervous and makes me scared  
But I feel so good if I just say the word
