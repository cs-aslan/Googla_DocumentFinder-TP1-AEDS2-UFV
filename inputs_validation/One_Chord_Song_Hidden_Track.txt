This is my one chord song  
Its easy to sing along  
Cause there aint much in the way it changes  
But sometimes life can be that way  
  
Yeah there aint to much  
That I can do with the melody  
Cause Im stuck within the confines  
Of the single key of G  
  
This is my one chord song  
I cant go on too long  
Cause Ive said all Ive got to say  
And you probably wont hear this anyway  
  
Yeah now heres the same thing  
That you heard 8 bars before  
And if your just like me  
Im sure that you are bored with this chord  
  
But if I can make you stop and think  
About the life your living in  
Cause you and I we dont have long  
So make the most before its gone  
  
Cause this is my one chord song  
  
Now I can make it sound  
Like theres another chord  
But youd be fooled  
Cause there is only one  
  
This is my one chord song  
This is my one chord song  
  
This is my one chord song
