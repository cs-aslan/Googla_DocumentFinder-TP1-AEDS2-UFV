Somewhere the evening sun  
Is falling down the day is done  
How Id like to be there how Id like to  
Share  
  
Somewhere the darkness frowns  
And hides behind the ones in doubt  
Would you like to be there would you  
Like to share  
  
With me cause my arms are stretched a  
Mile wide yeah  
  
under the ocean floor the sand is crawling  
Up the shore  
How Id like to be there n how Id like  
To share  
  
Under the western sky the days are  
Slowly passing by  
Would you like to be there would you  
Like to share  
  
With me cause my arms are stretched a  
Mile wide yeah  
  
the more you see the more you know  
The more you see the more  
  
somewhere the songbird sings but  
Hears theres no one listening  
How Id like to be there n how Id like  
To share  
  
Out in the blackened sea theres unison  
And harmony  
Would you like to be there would you  
Like to share with me  
  
Cause my arms are stretched a mile  
Wide yeah  
  
The more you see the more you know  
The more you see the more
