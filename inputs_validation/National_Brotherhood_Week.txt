One week of every year is designated National Brotherhood Week This is just
one of many such weeks honoring various worthy causes One of my favorites is
National Makefunofthehandicapped Week which Frank Fontaine and Jerry Lewis
are in charge of as you know During National Brotherhood Week various special
events are arranged to drive home the message of brotherhood This year for
example on the first day of the week Malcolm X was killed which gives you an
idea of how effective the whole thing is Im sure we all agree that we ought
to love one another and I know there are people in the world that do not love
their fellow human beings and I hate people like that Heres a song about
National Brotherhood Week  
  
Oh the white folks hate the black folks  
And the black folks hate the white folks  
To hate all but the right folks  
Is an old established rule  
  
But during National Brotherhood Week National Brotherhood Week  
Lena Horne and Sheriff Clarke are dancing cheek to cheek  
Its fun to eulogize  
The people you despise  
As long as you dont let em in your school  
  
Oh the poor folks hate the rich folks  
And the rich folks hate the poor folks  
All of my folks hate all of your folks  
Its American as apple pie  
  
But during National Brotherhood Week National Brotherhood Week  
New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans cause its very chic  
Step up and shake the hand  
Of someone you cant stand  
You can tolerate him if you try  
  
Oh the Protestants hate the Catholics  
And the Catholics hate the Protestants  
And the Hindus hate the Moslems  
And everybody hates the Jews  
  
But during National Brotherhood Week National Brotherhood Week  
Its National Everyonesmileatoneanotherhood Week  
Be nice to people who  
Are inferior to you  
Its only for a week so have no fear  
Be grateful that it doesnt last all year
