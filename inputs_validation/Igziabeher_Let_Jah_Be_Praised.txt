Igziabeher  
Let jah be praised  
Negusa neghast  
Let jah be praised  
Me don eah lamb  
Let jah be praised  
Let him be praised3x  
  
He watereth the hills  
From his chambers  
And the earth is satisfied  
So satisfied  
He maketh the grass to grow for animals  
Jah made the herb for man  
Jah made the herb for man  
Jah made the herb for man  
  
Fret not thyself  
Because of evildoers  
Neither be thou envious  
Against the workers of inequity  
For they shall soon be cut down  
  
Cut down like grass  
And they shall wither like corn  
Let jah arise  
And let all his enemies be scattered  
Let them that hate jah  
Now scat up shut up butt up and flat up  
  
As the smoke was driven away  
Jah drive them away  
As the rocks melted  
Let them be melted jahjah  
  
Igziabeher  
Let jah be praised  
You don eah lamb  
Let jah be praised  
  
Negusa neghast  
Let jah be praised  
Let him be praised4x  
  
Ah lightning  
Earthquake  
Brimstone  
For the fire  
I said lightning  
Brimstone and fire  
  
Igziabeher  
Weakheart scat up shut up flat up and butt out  
I feel it  
Weakheart feel it  
Kill them dead before them spread
