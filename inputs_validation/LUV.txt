Guilty til proven innocent  
Im thinking about the government  
Wondering where the money went  
Into outer space I guess  
Lying CSs everywhere  
Pretty boys in their underwear  
Statue of Liberty  
Who really cares  
About freedom  
  
Chorus  
Singin about luv baby luv  
Singin about luv baby luv  
  
Throw up throw down  
Get yourself a better town  
All these towns look the same  
Self pity number one recreation  
Were dying in the USA  
Preacher man he keeps  
Preachin  
While he covets your wife  
I aint sayin whats good  
I aint sayin whats right  
  
Chorus  
  
Wait a minute let me check my tan  
Am I the same color as Superman  
Helter skelter in a foreign land  
Monkeys versus dogs  
Lying under a big palm tree  
With cream and bananas all over me  
Thats the way its supposed to be  
Here in the Garden of Eden  
  
Chorus x 2
