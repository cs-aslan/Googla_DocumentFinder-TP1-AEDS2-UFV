I was taking a chance on a tightrope  
Walking the line to the end  
I was ready to fall had my back to the wall  
But Im flying again  
I been shifting my gears I been moving  
Cause they wanted me dead or alive  
But Im making a break and I want you to take a ride  
Take a ride   
Bring on the night  
Into the shadows and out of the light  
Bring on the night  
Let the dream chaser take you away  
  
When the sun hits another horizon  
And the joker has started to deal  
You can quit if you choose but theres nothing to lose  
By a spin of the wheel  
Gotta burn all your bridges behind you theyll keep dragging  
You down if you stay  
And I know I aint wrong cause Im free and Im on my way  
On my way  
Bring on the night  
Into the shadows and out of the light  
Bring on the night  
Let the dream chaser take you away  
  
I live on the edge of tomorrow  
Im racing along on the wind  
I can see what I need you better believe  
Im playin to win  
I got nothin to fear when Im flyin  
Cause yesterdays over and gone  
And theres nothin I can do So I gotta keep movin on  
Movin on   
Movin on   
Bring on the night  
Into the shadows and out of the light  
Bring on the night  
Let the dream chaser take you away Take you away  
Bring on the night  
dream chaser  
  
Repeat till fade
