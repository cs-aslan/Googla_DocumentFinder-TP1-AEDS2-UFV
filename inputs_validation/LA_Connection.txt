Oh carry home my broken bones and lay me down to rest  
Forty days of cries and moans I guess  
Ive failed to pass the test  
Ive been sent away not a thing to say  
Im banished from the fold  
Im a fallen angel whos lost his wings and left out in the cold  
  
Oh LA connection  
Oh LA connection  
LA connection yeah  
  
Operator place a call keep secret but it through  
Investigator knows it all hes at the window I wonder who  
Ive got to cut the line and let me drift find a haven in the storm  
I got no time I need a lift to where its sweet and close and warm  
  
I say  
Oh LA connection  
Oh LA connection  
LA connection  
  
Hey carry home my broken bones and lay me down to rest  
Forty days of cries and moans well Ive just failed the test  
Feel Im balanced on the brim should I lean another way  
Like a flame thats going on the dim needs blessing from the day oh  
  
Oh LA connection LA connection  
Oh take me away I got nothing to say  
Its got to be an LA connection oh  
Oh LA connection LA connection
