Did you hear that  
It sounds like Im losing my faith did you feel that  
It feels like Im so far away  
But if I knew what I know now  
  
This wouldnt be so wrong  
Now Im back to where I started from  
And if I was sure then Id be right  
But I guess Ive lost this fight  
  
Wait until the next time  
I can feel it  
It feels like my lucks going to change  
I can see it  
  
It seems like this time its ok  
And if I was sure then Id be right  
But I guess Ive lost this fight  
Wait until the next time  
  
I know I was close that time  
Before theres still a need for something more  
Wait until the next time
