Ive never been the type whos gonna wait around  
Not make a sound while others bring me down  
Im not someone wholl tell you what you want to hear  
Oh youve got to feel by keeping it real  
  
And until now Ive been patient  
Ive been good somehow  
But anticipations leaving me no doubt  
About how it will be  
When you let go of your fear and release  
  
Chorus  
Lets move it to the fast lane  
Take a chance and love me  
Ill give you all I have  
Im good like that  
Baby when you crash into me  
Youll finally understand  
How loving me can change all your plans  
  
Im good like that  
Im good like that  
Dont make me have to tell you that I told you so  
Cause I know you know and its hard to hold  
I cannot do this feeling youll find theres double meaning  
To the things I say when you walk this way  
  
Just relax let me take control of you sit back  
Make you see where all this goes  
Im in too bad  what you got to lose  
Compared to what Im offering you  
  
Chorus  
  
Im good like that  
Im good like that  
So take a chance and love me fast  
Ill give you allall that I have  
Im good Im good Im good like that  
Im good Im good Im good like that  
Im good Im good Im good like that  
  
Chorus  
Im good like that
