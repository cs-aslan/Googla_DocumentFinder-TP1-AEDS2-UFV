I can see the wait there in your eyes  
I can feel the thought in your sigh  
Your knuckles are bruised from a losing flight  
One way down a dead end street  
Broken glass underneath your feet  
You think the day wont break the sunless night  
  
The sun will rise  
The sun will rise  
When youve lost your lights  
The sun will rise  
Itll be alright  
Itll be alright  
  
Ive been in stuck in a storm before  
Felt the wind raging at my door  
Couldnt move couldnt breathe couldnt find a way out  
Somehow my clouds disappeared  
Somehow I made it here  
Maybe just so you could hear me say  
  
The sun will rise  
The sun will rise the sun will rise  
When youve lost your lights  
The sun will rise  
Itll be alright itll be alright  
Itll be alright  
Itll be alright  
Itll be alright  
  
Although you cant see it  
So hard to believe it  
Sometimes you just need a little faith all you need is a little faith  
Theres an answer to your prayer  
And I swear that therell come a day yeah  
  
The sun will rise  
The sun will rise the sun will rise  
The sun will rise the sun will rise  
The sun will rise  
Yeah  
The sun will rise  
The sun will rise  
  
Itll be alright  
Itll be alright yeah yeah  
Itll be alright yeah yeah  
Itll be alright yeah yeah  
Itll be alright  
  
The sun will rise
