No matter what you are  
I will always be with you  
Doesnt matter what you do girl  
Ooh girl with you  
No matter what you do  
I will always be around  
Wont you tell me what you found girl  
Ooh girl oh wont you  
  
Knock down the old brick wall  
And be a part of it all  
Nothing to say  
Nothing to see  
Nothing to do  
  
If you would give me all  
As I would give it to you  
Nothing would be  
Nothing would be  
Nothing would be  
  
No matter where you go  
There will always be a place  
Cant you see it in my face girl  
Oh girl wont you  
  
Yeah  
  
Knock down the old brick wall  
And be a part of it all  
Nothing to say  
Nothing to see  
Nothing to do  
  
If you would give me all  
As I would give it to you  
Nothing would be  
Nothing would be  
Nothing would be  
  
No matter what you are  
I will always be with you  
Doesnt matter what you do girl  
Ooh girl with you  
  
Ooh girl you girl I want you  
Ooh girl you girl I want you
