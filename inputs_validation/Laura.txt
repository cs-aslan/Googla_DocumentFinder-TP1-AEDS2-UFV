The grain bag sits on the chair and why the hell am I with ya  
And if you told me that it wasnt there why the hell am I with ya  
You know I really dont care and why the hell now with ya  
I told my mommy that it was ok and why the hell now with ya

Oh baby I cut myself  
  
And if you threw the garbage away why the hell am I with ya  
And if you knew you wanted to stay then why the hell now with ya  
Little Eddie Dingle is going away and why the hell now with ya  
Somebody wants to come and play and why the hell am I with ya

You know something Ive got somethin Ive got somethin  
Ive got somethin for all the people in the world
