Never thought that Id so inspired  
Never thought that Id find the higher truth  
I believed that love was overrated  
Till the moment I found you  
  
Now baby I know I dont deserve  
The love you give me  
But now I understand that  
  
Chorus  
If you want me I must be doing something right  
I got nothing left to prove  
And its all because of you  
So if you need me  
And baby I make you feel alive  
I know I must be doing  
Doing something right  
  
Its because of you I feel so lifted  
Ive been looking at my life from higher ground  
Never thought Id be so elated  
Youre the one that turned it all around  
  
Now baby I didnt know myself  
Until you changed me  
And made me understand that  
  
Chorus  
  
And baby I know I dont deserve the love you give me  
But I dont really care cause  
  
Chorus  
  
Doing something right  
Yeah yeah  
Something right  
  
So if you need me  
And baby I make you feel alive  
I know I must be doing I know I must be doing  
Must be doing something right  
Yeah yeah  
Something right
