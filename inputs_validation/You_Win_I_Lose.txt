You win I lose  
I beg you choose  
Youre so cool and Im confused  
Im me and youre you  
Youre so loose and Im uptight  
Youre day Im night  
  
Like two ships in the night in foggy weather  
Just a waitin for fresh winds to blow  
Maybe were losin one another  
I could be wrong I dont know  
  
You get the best I get the rest  
You pass the test Im just a mess  
You got it made Im in the shade  
Like two ships in the night  
Like two dopes in the boat without a paddle  
Just a wonderin why it dont go  
We could be losin one another  
I could be wrong I dont know  
  
I know youre tryin to phase me  
Its gonna drive me crazy  
I cant wait for the day when  
  
I win You lose  
You beg and I choose  
Youre in the shade Im on parade  
  
Like two ships in the night
