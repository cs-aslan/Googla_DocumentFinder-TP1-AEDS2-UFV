Come lay by my side little darlin  
Come lay your cool hand on my brow  
Promise me that you will always  
Be nobodys darlin but mine  
Be nobodys darlin but mine love  
Be honest be faithful be kind  
And promise me that you will always  
Be nobodys darlin but mine  
Youre as sweet as the flowers of springtime  
Youre as pure as the dew from the rose  
Id rather be somebodys darlin  
And a poor boy nobody knows  
Be nobodys darlin but mine love  
Be honest be faithful be kind  
And promise me that you will always  
Be nobodys darlin but mine  
Goodbye little darlin Im leaving  
Im leaving this cold world behind  
So promise me that you will never  
Be nobodys darlin but mine  
Be nobodys darlin but mine love  
Be honest be faithful be kind  
And promise me that you will always  
Be nobodys darlin but mine
