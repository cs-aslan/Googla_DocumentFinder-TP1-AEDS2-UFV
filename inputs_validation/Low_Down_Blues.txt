Lord I went to the doctor he took one look  
He said the trouble with you aint in my book  
Ill tell you what it is but it aint good news  
Youve got an awful bad case of them low down blues  
  
Ive got the mean old miseries in my soul  
I went to the river but the waters too cold  
Ive walked the floor till Ive wore out my shoes  
Lord theyre killin me I mean them low down blues  
  
Lord I never knew a man could feel so bad  
I never knew livin could be so sad  
All I do is set and cry  
Lord Id have to get better before I could die  
  
Ive got the mean old miseries in my soul  
I went to the river but the waters too cold  
Ive walked the floor till Ive wore out my shoes  
Lord theyre killin me I mean them low down blues
