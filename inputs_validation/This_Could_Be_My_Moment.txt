Im the only man who ever really thought that I had qualified  
From the corners of your mind you would care for another guy  
  
Now Im lookin at you straight in the eye  
I know it feels good and I know you should try me  
  
But every chance you get you just hesitate  
Is there something in my look that you really hate  
  
Open me up I feel real glad  
You can take all I have

Dont you wanna try it maybe maybe  
This could be my moment somethin more than weather  
Dont you wanna try it
