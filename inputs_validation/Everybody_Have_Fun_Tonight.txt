Ill drive a million miles  
To be with you tonight  
So if youre feeling low  
Turn up your radio  
The words we use are strong  
They make reality  
But now the musics on  
Oh baby dance with me yeah  
  
Rip it up  
Move down  
Rip it up  
Move it down to the ground  
Rip it up  
Cool down  
  
And get the feeling not the word  
  
Chorus  
Evrybody have fun tonight  
Evrybody have fun tonight  
Evrybody Wang Chung tonight  
Evrybody have fun tonight  
Evrybody Wang Chung tonight  
Evrybody have fun  
  
Deep in the world tonight  
Our hearts beat safe and sound  
Ill hold you so close  
Just let yourself go down  
  
Rip it up  
Move down  
Rip it up  
Move it down to the ground  
Rip it up  
Cool down  
Rip it up  
Get out whats inside of you  
  
Chorus  
  
On the edge of oblivion  
All the world is Babylon  
And all the love and evryone  
A ship of fools sailing on  
Evrybody  
Evrybody have fun tonight  
Evrybody  
Evrybody have fun tonight  
  
Across the nation  
Around the world  
Evrybody have fun tonight  
A celebration so spread the word  
  
Chorus  
  
Evrybody  
Evryone
