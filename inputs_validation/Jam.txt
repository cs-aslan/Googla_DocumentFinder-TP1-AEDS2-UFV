Nation to nation all the world must come together  
Face the problems that we see  
Then maybe somehow we can work it out  
I asked my neighbor for a favor she said later  
What has come of all the people have we lost love of what its about  
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be  
False prophets cry of doom what are the possibilities  
I told my brother therell be problems times and tears for fears  
But we must live each day like its the last  
Go with it go with it  
  
Chorus  
Jam It aint it aint too much stuff  
It aint too much it aint too much for me to jam  
It aint it aint too much stuff  
It aint dont you it aint too much for me to  
  
The world keeps changing rearranging minds and thoughts  
Predictions fly of doom the baby boom has come of age well work it out  
I told my brother dont you ask me for no favors  
Im conditioned by the system dont you talk to me dont scream and shout  
She pray to God to Buddha then she sings a Talmud song  
Confusions contradict the self do we know right from wrong  
I just want you to recognize me Im the temple  
You cant hurt me I found peace within myself  
Go with it go with it  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Uh huh it aint too much stuff it aint too much  
It aint too much for me to jam  
It aint it aint too much stuff it aint dont you  
It aint too much for me to  
  
Jam jam here comes the man hot damn  
The big boy stands movin up a hand  
Makin funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson  
Smooth criminal thats the man Mikes so relaxed  
Mingle mingle jingle in the jungle bum rushed to door 3 and 4s in a
bundle  
Execute the plan first I cooled like a fan  
Got with Janet then with Guy now with Michael cause it aint hard to  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
  
Repeats  
Jam It aint it aint too much stuff  
It aint too much it aint too much for me to jam  
Uh huh it aint too much stuff it aint dont you  
It aint too much for me to
