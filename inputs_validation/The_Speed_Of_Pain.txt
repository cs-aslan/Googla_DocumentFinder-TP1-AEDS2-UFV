They slit our throats  
Like we were flowers  
And our milk has been  
Devoured  
  
When you want it  
It goes away too fast  
When you hate it  
It always seems to last  
But just remember when you think  
Youre free  
The crack inside your fucking heart is me  
  
Thought not spoken  
I want to outrace the speed of pain for another day  
  
I wish I could sleep  
But I cant lay on my back  
Because theres a knife  
For everyday that Ive known you  
  
When you want it  
It goes away too fast  
When you hate it  
It always seems to last  
  
But just remember when you think  
Youre free  
The crack inside your fucking heart is me  
  
Thought not spoken  
I want to outrace the speed of pain for another day  
  
Lie to me cry to me give to me  
I would  
Lie with me die with me give to me  
I would  
Keep all your secrets wrapped in dead hair  
I hope at least we die holding hands for always
