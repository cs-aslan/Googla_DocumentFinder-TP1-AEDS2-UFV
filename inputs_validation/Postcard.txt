Well Ive been sittin here thinkin about you  
Bout what it is that you you want from me  
You know it seems that I still dont know you well  
Know many faces I have seen  
  
Still I try to make you happy  
Still I try to make you sing  
Now if youre wonderin what I think of it all  
Just read the back of this postcard  
  
The air here breathings great  
Lord weve cooked ourselves  
Now were cookin up an ass kickin time didnt we  
  
This town is nuts my kind of place  
I dont want to leave  
I dont never never never never want to leave  
I never never never never want to leave  
Never never  
  
I see you in a  
Thousand costumes  
Strike many a silent pose  
I heard you tell a thousand stories  
Everyone in a different voice  
  
Still I try to make you happy  
Still I try to make you sing  
Now if youre wonderin what I think of it all  
Just read the back of this postcard  
  
The air here breathings great  
Lord weve cooked ourselves  
Now were cookin up an ass kickin time didnt we  
  
This town is nuts my kind of place  
I dont want to leave  
I dont never never never never want to leave  
I never never never never want to leave  
Never never  
  
Im taking my car  I never want to leave  
Im taking my car
