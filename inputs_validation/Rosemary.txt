Let me in this bitch Let me get some change shit Man fuck this dress code
bitch I can dance  
Muthafucka I can daaannncccee  
  
Im on crack Walkin alleyways downtown people drop change so Im checkin the
ground behind a  
Nightclub I can hear the bump outside I hear em laughin and drinkin and
dancin getin live and  
Im lonely graspin on my 55 cent I dont know where my meds went they been
spent and Im bent I  
Dont remember yesterday at all Im barkin at the moon as Im pissin on the
wall people grippin  
New cars checkin out a few bars they see me comin side step a few yards Im
like a bad man holdin  
Out my crusty ass hands scouldin an imaginary friend scary and Im blackin
out just about to lose  
All hope I was peerin through the window of a nightclub scopin and there
she was everything I  
Planned for on the spotlight on the dance floor gravitatin  
  
Chorus  
She kept her rythum her feet to the floor she dipped down she did the twirl
and she shook it some  
More shes ruby She made me happy I tried to refrain I walk off but then I
run right back Im at it  
Again shes callin  
  
I ran a few blocks away and broke a bottle carjacked a minivan and punched
full throttle right back  
To the spot then I waited to get her but when she came out she had a bitch
boy wit her no problem  
Hit the pipe and follow em home and my imaginary friend gone have to leave me
alone cause this really  
Goin down I feel it pullin me home knowin Im a wicked clown I gotta throw it
down she pulled in her  
And her fuck ass strolled in I hit the pipe again and jump out the stolen
jumpin through back yards  
Clumsey and trippin it dont matter where ya go theres a throat slingin
and the way she danced  
Split flames burnin me alive out here quit playin games Im on the side of her
house lookin in through  
The back den and there she was with him again dancin  
  
Chorus  
  
I walk right in through the front door unlocked no gun cocked cinder block
clown paint I came  
Here to dance boogy umph ahhh and maybe tap a little nookie Im creepin
music bumpin in the back  
Im down the hallway hidin behind the coat rack and here come the punk bout
to get champaighned I  
Take the rock and pop em with the damn thang hit em in the back of the
head he dropped the wine  
But I caught him in time I had to take his life with a steak knife I washed
it off and put it back  
Im keepin the place nice Im comin bitch you want an olive or somethin Im
fuckin straight out the  
Streets but Im down with some frontin I want to tango but instead Im still
outside the club and its  
All in my head  
  
Chorus
