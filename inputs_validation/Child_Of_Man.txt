If I were a desert flower  
All winter long Id pain and cower  
Spring would make me sing  
My voice would ring  
As tiny buds begin to bloom  
In spring Id blossom and forget  
The winters gloom  
  
If I were a brook of water  
Kissed by the frost along my borders  
Spring would make me sing  
My voice would ring  
As Id release my ice chains  
In spring Id bubble and forget the  
Winters rains  
  
But I am only a child of man  
I am only a child of man  
Just an innocent child of man  
  
Dont look so surprised as my  
Eyes shine and glow  
Its the sunlight in the skies that  
Is making me so  
  
If I were a joyful songbird  
All winter long so cold and somber  
Spring would make me sing  
My voice would ring like tiny bells  
On scarves of silk  
A song as beautiful and pure as  
Mothers milk  
  
But I am only a child of man  
I am only a child of man  
Just an innocent child of man  
  
Dont look so surprised as my eyes  
Shine and glow  
Its the sunlight in the skies  
That is making me so  
  
Dont be surprised  
But this look in my eyes  
Like a flower or tree  
I will bloom in the spring  
I will shed all my woes  
As the green grass grows  
Like a flower or tree  
I will throw my head back and sing  
  
If I were a desert flower desert flower
