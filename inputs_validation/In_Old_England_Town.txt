Down down you can see them all  
Rising gaily to the top  
Keep on rising babe you know you got a long drop  
You better cling cos its the done thing  
  
Down down at the policemans ball  
Theyre all dancing in a line  
Keep on gruntin boys you know youre doin fine  
Come quickly ive been strangled  
  
Down down at the military  
Theyre all marching round and round  
Keep them boots shined and that still upper lip down  
Ablution revolution  
  
Down down at the launching pad  
Giant phallus stands erect  
Ten thousand tons of waste throb then eject  
Look out space were gonna change our place  
  
Down down in old england town  
There was air and now theres smoke  
Lets build more cars and drive away before we choke  
Suddenly its always night time  
  
Down down at that nice trade fair  
All the money gone astray  
Lets inflate this price and float away  
Just you and me and everyone
