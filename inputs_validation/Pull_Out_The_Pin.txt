Just as we hit the green  
Ive never been so happy to be alive  
Only seven miles behind  
You could smell the child  
The smell of the front lines survival  
  
With my silver Buddha  
And my silver bullet  
I pull the pin  
  
You learn to ride the Earth  
When youre living on your belly and the enemy are citybirths  
Who need radar We use scent  
They stink of the west stink of sweat  
Stink of cologne and baccy and all their Yankee hash  
  
With my silver Buddha  
And my silver bullet  
Im pulling on the pin  
Ooh I pull out pull out the pin  
pulling on the pin oh  
  
Chorus  
Just one thing in it  
Me or him  
Just one thing in it  
Me or him  
And I love life  
Just one thing in it  
Me or him  
And I love life  
I love life  
I love life  
  
Ive seen the coat for me  
Ill track him til he drops  
Then Ill pop him one he wont see  
Hes big and pink and not like me  
He sees no light  
He sees no reason for the fighting  
  
With my silver Buddha  
And my silver bullet  
Im pulling on the pin  
Ooh I pull out pull out the pin  
pulling on the pin oh  
  
I had not seen his face  
til Im only feet away  
Unbeknown to my prey  
I look in American eyes  
I see little life  
See little wife  
Hes striking violence up in me  
  
With my silver Buddha  
And my silver bullet  
  
Chorus x2
