Your hairs a mess  
You better put on a dress  
And get your feet back on the ground  
You fix your eyes  
For some city guys  
Who wouldnt save you if you drowned  
You hang on Fortysecond street  
And do your homework in the bar  
Saint Helen says youre missin school  
And Im wondrin where you are  
  
Holyanna  
Holyanna  
Girl what you do to me  
Holyanna  
Holyanna  
Girl youre a blueeyed mystery  
  
You read your books  
Until nobody looks  
And then you slip out after dark  
You steal my love  
Then say youre sorry  
And do your penance in the park  
You fooled your mother when you skipped ballet  
To paint your face for the midnight show  
And in the morning you knelt beside your bed  
And prayed shed never know  
  
Holyanna  
Holyanna  
Girl what you do to me  
Holyanna  
Holyanna  
Girl youre a blueeyed mystery  
  
Holyanna  
Holyanna  
Girl what you do to me  
Holyanna  
Holyanna  
Girl youre a blueeyed mystery
