Well youre just in time to be too late I tried to but I couldnt wait  
And now Ive got another date so I wont be home no more  
Youre just in time to miss the boat so dont take off your hat and coat  
Be on your way thats all she wrote cause I wont be home no more  
I stood around a mouth or two and waited for your call  
Now Im too busy pitchin woo so come around next fall  
I stretched your name right off my slate and hung a sign on my front gate  
Youre just in time to be too late and I wont be home no more  
 guitar  piano  fiddle  steel   
Well youre just in time to turn around and drive your buggy back to town  
You lookedf me up I turned you down and I wont be home no more  
Youre just in time to change your tune go tell your troubles to the moon  
And call around next May or June cause I wont be home no more  
I used to be a patient kind believed each alibi  
But thats all done Ive changed my mind Ive got new fish to fry  
Well youre just in time to celebrate the thing you didnt calculate  
Youre just in time to be too late and I wont be home no more
