Little Mr Roo  
Reaching up  
For the moon  
So many things  
Youve got to do  
And no time  
For dreaming  
  
Little Mr Roo  
Let the stars  
Shine over you  
Dont grow up  
Too fast  
Too soon  
Save some time  
For dreaming  
  
Settle in  
Settle down  
Let me see  
That sleepy yawn  
On your face  
Close your eyes  
I will love you  
Completely  
And always  
  
Little Mr Roo  
The moon shines  
Silver over you  
No one knows  
You like I do  
And little Mr Roo  
Reaching  
For the moon  
Dont grow up  
Too fast  
Too soon
