Red sun go down way over dirty town  
Starlings are sweeping around crazy shoals  
A girl is there high heeling across the square  
Wind blows around in her hair and the flaqs upon the poles  
Waiting in the crowd to cross at the light  
She looks around to find a face she can like  
  
Church bell clinging on trying to get a crowd for Evensong  
Nobody cares to depend to depend upon the chime it plays  
Theyre all in the station praying for trains  
Congregation late again  
Its getting darker all the time these flagpole days  
Drunk old soldier he gives her a fright  
Hes crazy lion howling for a fight  
  
Strap hanging gunshot sound  
Doors slamming on the overground  
Starlings are tough but the lions are made of stone  
Her evening paper is horror torn  
But theres hope later for Capricorns  
Her lucky stars give her just enough to get her home  
Then shes reading about a swing to the right  
But shes thinking about a stranger in the night  
Im thinking about the lions tonight  
What happened to the lions
