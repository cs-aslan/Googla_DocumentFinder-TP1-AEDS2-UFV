Would you let all your friends down  
Is your love in drugs and money  
Did you care enough  
Not before you said  
Its not too late  
  
We have waited all our lives  
To become something more than nothing  
Did you think more of us now  
I said  
  
Chorus  
Its not too late  
Im not that scared  
Of it anymore  
Oh yeah  
Thats why  
You are the voice of reason  
I know the reasons why  
Weve covered up our treason  
Cant seem to find out why  
  
Cant seem to find out why  
  
So Ill take all your advice  
And Ill check to see if Im running  
Cause its not like I can care enough  
Its not too late  
  
Chorus  
Im sick and tired of pulling down  
  
Ill pinch the mouse trap on this one  
Ive had the most in on this one  
Youll turn away youll turn away  
Ill play my cards out on this hand  
Ill separate it while I can  
Youll turn away youll turn away youll turn away youll turn away  
  
You are the voice of reason  
I know the reasons why  
You are the voice of reason  
I know the reasons why  
We covered up our treason  
Cant seem to find out why  
Im sick and tired of pulling down  
  
This time Im not  
Shy anymore  
Now this time Im not  
Shy anymore  
Now this time Im not  
Shy anymore  
Now this time Im not  
Shy anymore
