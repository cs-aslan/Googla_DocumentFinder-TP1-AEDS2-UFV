Did you think Id stand there  
While you kicked me in the face  
Doesnt make much sense to push me down  
I need explanation to adjust my way of thought  
Did you think youd find me hanging round  
And its ten years later and I havent left your side  
Even though you gave me reason to  
And Im standing over your bodys losing life  
I guess things are hard to name a few  
Did you think Id take it when you pushed me in disgrace  
Very hard to leave that behind  
I hate aggravation but thats why you made me fight  
Have to face it you were just high
