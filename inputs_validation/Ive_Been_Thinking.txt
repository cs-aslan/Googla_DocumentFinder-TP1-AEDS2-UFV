All I need is a place to be  
And a way to feel  
A space to figure out where I belong  
A chance to know my thoughts  
And find a way to show  
What I feel  
And if this is real  
Yeah  
  
Dont wanna disappoint you  
Dont wanna let you down  
Cause thats the last thing I would do  
Im asking for your patience  
I realize I could loose you  
But lately Ive been so confused  
  
Ive been thinkin thinking  
Youve been on my mind on my mind  
So Ive been praying praying  
To find a way that I a way that I  
Can be sure the way that the way that  
Youve been sure with me sure with me  
Dont you want that from me  
  
Wondering endlessly if this is right or wrong  
Or if its just about me all along  
All I need is time to search within my soul  
So I can share a deeper part of me  
Yeah  
  
Dont wanna disappoint you  
Dont wanna let you down  
Cause thats the last thing I would do  
Im asking for your patience  
I realize I could loose you  
But lately Ive been so confused  
  
Ive been thinkin thinking  
Youve been on my mind on my mind  
So Ive been praying praying  
To find a way that I a way that I  
Can be sure the way that the way that  
Youve been sure with me sure with me  
Dont you want that from me  
  
Baby whats meant to be what was meant to be  
Will surely be will surely be baby  
If you love me baby you would understand  
But I cant give you anything cant give you anything  
If I dont have myself to give if I dont have myself to give  
And its killing me inside  
  
Ive been thinkin thinking  
Youve been on my mind on my mind  
So Ive been praying praying  
To find a way that I a way that I  
Can be sure the way that the way that  
Youve been sure with me sure with me  
Dont you want that from me  
  
Ive been thinkin thinking  
Youve been on my mind on my mind  
So Ive been praying praying  
To find a way that I a way that I  
Can be sure the way that the way that  
Youve been sure with me sure with me  
Dont you want that from me
