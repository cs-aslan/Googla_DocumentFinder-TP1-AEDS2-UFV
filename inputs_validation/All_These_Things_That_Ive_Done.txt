When theres nowhere else to run  
Is there room for one more son  
One more son  
If you can hold on  
If you can hold on hold on  
I want to stand up I want to let go  
You know you know  no you dont you dont  
I want to shine on in the hearts of men  
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand  
  
Another head aches another heart breaks  
I am so much older than I can take  
And my affection well it comes and goes  
I need direction to perfection no no no no  
  
Help me out  
Yeah you know you got to help me out  
Yeah oh dont you put me on the backburner  
You know you got to help me out  
  
And when theres nowhere else to run  
Is there room for one more son  
These changes aint changing me  
The coldhearted boy I used to be  
  
Yeah you know you got to help me out  
Yeah oh dont you put me on the backburner  
You know you got to help me out  
Youre gonna bring yourself down  
Yeah youre gonna bring yourself down  
Yeah youre gonna bring yourself down  
  
I got soul but Im not a soldier  
I got soul but Im not a soldier  
I got soul but Im not a soldier  
I got soul but Im not a soldier  
I got soul but Im not a soldier  
I got soul but Im not a soldier  
I got soul but Im not a soldier  
I got soul but Im not a soldier  
I got soul but Im not a soldier  
I got soul but Im not a soldier  
  
Yeah you know you got to help me out  
Yeah oh dont you put me on the backburner  
You know you got to help me out  
Youre gonna bring yourself down  
Youre gonna bring yourself down  
Yeah oh dont you put me on the backburner  
Yeah youre gonna bring yourself down  
Yeah youre gonna bring yourself down  
  
Over and again last call for sin  
While everyones lost the battle is won  
With all these things that Ive done  
All these things that Ive done  
Time truth hearts  
If you can hold on  
If you can hold on
