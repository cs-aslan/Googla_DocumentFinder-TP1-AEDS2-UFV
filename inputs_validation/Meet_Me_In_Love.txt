I know you dont know me  
Only our eyes have met  
But what yours are saying  
Is making me sweat  
The dance floor is empty  
Why dont you meet me in love  
  
Your breath on my body  
The touch of your skin  
Your touch is ungodly  
And way beyond sin  
Ive fallen so deeply  
Beggin you meet me in love  
  
Darling please meet me  
And Ill whisper sweetly  
Youre the one  
All my life  
That Ive dreamed of  
Ive fallen so deeply  
Im yours completely  
So darling please meet me forever in love  
  
Lips warm and tender  
Ask if Ill always care  
Simply surrender  
And follow me there  
Trust me completely  
Darling please meet me in love  
  
Darling please meet me  
Ever so sweetly in love
