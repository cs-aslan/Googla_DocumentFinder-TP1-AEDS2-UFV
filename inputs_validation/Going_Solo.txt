She left a message after the tone  
I hear it over and over on the answer phone  
No one can find her address unknown  
She just decided to go out and make it alone  
  
Solo solo  
My little child is going solo  
Solo solo  
My little child is going solo  
  
I feel like crying Im in a rage  
I cant understand why she just ran away  
What made it happen guess well never know  
She just decided to go out and make it solo  
Solo solo solo solo solo  
  
We work like dogs all of our lives  
Like millions of other husbands and wives  
Sent her through college didnt care what we spent  
Think of how we feel  
She didnt say she didnt ask she just went  
  
Solo solo  
My little child youre going solo  
Its like a pattern its like a crime  
We see it happen time after time  
You raise your children you watch them grow  
Then one day its goodbye theyve decided theyre going solo  
Solo solo solo solo solo  
  
The toys are forgotten now it appears  
Youve let them down after all of these years  
Sacrificed all now theres nothing to show  
Ungrateful youth decided youre going solo  
  
Solo solo  
My little child youre going solo  
Solo solo  
Ungrateful youth youre going solo  
  
The obligations all of the ties  
Have got to be broken so you can survive  
Just because they gave you life they cant stop if you grow  
Now they cant hold you back cause youre going solo
