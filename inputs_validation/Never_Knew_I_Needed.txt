For the way you changed my plans  
For being the perfect distraction  
For the way you took the idea that I have  
Of everything that I wanted to have  
And made me see there was something missing oh yeah  
  
For the ending of my first begin  
Ooh yeah yeah ooh yeah yeah  
And for the rare and unexpected friend  
Ooh yeah yeah ooh yeah yeah  
For the way youre something that Id never choose  
But at the same time something I dont wanna lose  
And never wanna be without ever again  
  
Youre the best thing I never knew I needed  
So when you were here I had no idea  
You the best thing I never knew I needed  
So now its so clear I need you here always  
  
My accidental happily  
Ever after  
The way you smile and how you comfort me  
With your laughter  
I must admit you were not a part of my book  
But now if you open it up and take a look  
Youre the beginning and the end of every chapter  
  
Youre the best thing I never knew I needed  
So when you were here I had no idea  
When you were here  
You the best thing I never knew I needed  
That I needed  
So now its so clear I need you here always  
Now its so clear  
  
Who knew that I could be  
Who knew that I could be  
So unexpectedly  
So unexpectedly  
Undeniably happier  
Sitting with you right here right here next to me  
Girl youre the best  
  
Youre the best thing I never knew I needed  
Said I needed  
So when you were here I had no idea  
When you were here  
Said I had no idea  
Youre the best thing I never knew I needed  
That I needed  
So now its so clear I need you here always  
Now its so clear  
So clear so clear I need you always  
  
Now its so clear I need you here always
