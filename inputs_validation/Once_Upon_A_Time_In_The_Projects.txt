Once upon a time in the projects yo  
I damn near had to wreck a ho  
I knocked on the door  who is it  
Its ice cube come to pay a little visit to ya  
And whats up with the niggas in the parking lot  
She said fuck em cause they get sparked alot  
I sat on the couch but it wasnt stable  
And then I put my nikes on the coffee table  
Her brother came in hes into gangbangin  
Cause he walked up and said what set you claimin  
I dont bang I write the good rhymes  
The whole scenery reminded me of good times  
I dont like to feel that Im put in a rut  
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up  
He threw up a set and then he was gone  
Im thinkin to myself wont this bitch bring her ass on  
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth  
And fired up the sess it was sess no doubt  
She said please excuse my house and all that  
I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact  
Lookin at a fucked up black and white  
Her moms bitchin cause the county check wasnt right  
She had another brother that was three years old  
And had a bad case of the runny nose  
He asked me who I was then I had to pause  
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers  
I saw her sister that needs get her ass kicked  
Only thirteen and already pregnant  
I grabbed the forty out the bag and took a swig  
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids  
They were runnin and playin and cursin and yellin  
And tellin and look at this young punk bailin  
I heard a knock on the door without the password  
And her moms got the 12 guage mossberg  
The nigga said yo whats for sale  
And the bitch came out with a bag of yayo  
She made the drop and got the 20 dollars  
From a smoked out fool with ring around the collar  
The girl I was waiting for came out  
I said bitch I didnt know this was a crack house  
I got my coat and suddenly  
The cop busted in and had a mac10 pointed to my dome  
And I said to myself once again its on  
He threw me on the carpet and wasnt cuttin no slack  
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back  
First he tried to slap me up wrap me up rough me up  
They couldnt do it so they cuffed me up  
I said fuck how much abuse can a nigga take  
Hey yo officer youre making a big mistake  
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope  
He thought I was selling base and couldnt hear my case  
He said get out my face and musta had a grudge  
His reply tell that bullshit to the judge  
The girl I was with wasnt sayin nothin  
I said aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin  
She started draggin and all of a sudden  
We all got tossed in the patty wagon  
Now I beat the rap but that aint the point  
I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint  
Now the story you heard has one little object  
Dont fuck with a bitch from the projects
