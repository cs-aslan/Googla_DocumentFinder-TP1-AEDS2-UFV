The slightest words you said  
Have all gone to my head  
I hear angels sing in your voice  
When you pull me close  
Feelings Ive never known  
They mean everything  
And leave me no choice  
  
Light on my heart light on my feet  
Light in your eyes I cant even speak  
Do you even know how you make me weak  
  
Im a lightweight  
Better be careful what you say  
With every word Im blown away  
Youre in control of my heart  
Im a lightweight  
Easy to fall easy to break  
With every move my whole world shakes  
Keep me from falling apart  
  
Make a promise please  
Youll always be in reach  
Just in case I need  
You there when I call  
This is all so new  
Seems too good to be true  
Could this really be  
A safe place to fall  
  
Light on my heart light on my feet  
Light in your eyes I cant even speak  
Do you even know how you make me weak oh whoa  
  
Im a lightweight  
Better be careful what you say  
With every word Im blown away  
Youre in control of my heart  
Im a lightweight  
Easy to fall easy to break  
With every move my whole world shakes  
Keep me from falling apart  
Keep me from falling down  
  
Drowned in your love  
Its almost all too much  
Handle with care  
Say youll be there  
  
Oh Im a lightweight  
Better be careful what you say  
With every word Im blown away  
Youre in control of my heart  
Im a lightweight  
Easy to fall easy to break  
With every move my whole world shakes  
Keep me from falling apart  
Keep me from falling apart  
Keep me from falling apart oh  
Falling apart
