They say to have her hair done Liz flies all the way to France  
And Jackies seen in a Discotecque doin a brand new dance  
And the White House social season should be glitterin an gay  
  
But here in Topeka the rain is a fallin  
The faucet is a drippin and the kids are abawlin  
One of em a toddlin and one is a crawlin  
And ones on the way  
  
Im glad Raquel Welch just signed a million dollar pact  
And Debbies out in Vegas workin up a brand new act  
While the TVs showin newlyweds a real fun game to play  
  
But here in Topeka the screen doors a bangin  
The coffees boilin over and the wash needs a hangin  
One wants a cookie and one wants a changin  
And ones on the way  
  
Now what was I doin Jimmy get away from there  
Darn there goes the phone  
Hello honey whats that you say  
Youre bringin a few old army buddies home  
Youre callin from a bar  
Get away from there No not you honey  
I was talkin to the baby  
Wait a minute honey the door bell  
Honey could you stop at the market and hello hello  
Well Ill be  
  
The girls in New York City they all march for womens lib  
And better homes and garden shows the modern way to live  
And the pill may change the world tomorrow but meanwhile today  
  
Here in Topeka the flies are a buzzin  
The dog is a barkin and the floor needs a scrubbin  
One needs a spankin and one needs a huggin  
Lord ones on the way  
  
Oh gee I hope it aint twins again
