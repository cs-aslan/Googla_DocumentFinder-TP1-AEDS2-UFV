She can kill with a smile she can wound with her eyes  
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies  
And she only reveals what she wants you to see  
She hides like a child but shes always a woman to me  
  
She can lead you to love she can take you or leave you  
She can ask for the truth but shell never believe you  
And shell take what you give her as long its free  
Yeah She steals like a thief but shes always a woman to me  
  
Chorus   
Ohhh she takes care of herself  
She can wait if she wants shes ahead of her time  
Ohhh and she never gives out  
And she never gives in she just changes her mind  
  
And shell promise you more than the garden of Eden  
Then shell carelessly cut you and laugh while youre bleeding  
But shell bring out the best and the worst you can be  
Blame it all on yourself cause shes always a woman to me  
  
Chorus   
  
Shes frequently kind and shes suddenly cruel  
She can do as she pleases shes nobodys fool  
And she cant be convicted shes earned her degree  
And the most she will do is throw shadows at you  
But shes always a woman to me
