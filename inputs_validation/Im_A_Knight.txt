Chorus  
Im a knight Im a knight and Im a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
Im a knight Im a knight and Im a knight  
We fight by day and when its not so bright  
Were not so bright  
  
Verse 1  
We like to beat and chop and stab our wicked enemy  
But all the time we try to stick to rules of chivalry  
Rule one we have to do brave deeds for some great lady fair  
Id write poems I would joust and I would fight a bear  
Well maybe a teddy bear Oh I cant   
  
Chorus  
Im a knight Im a knight and Im a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
Im a knight Im a knight and Im a knight  
We charge ahead but never left or right  
Were never right  
  
Verse 2  
Rule two we have to practise in the noble art of war  
Battle for our king and country thats what knights are for  
And if there is no war to fight ahunting we will go  
We hunt for deer and rabbits too so long as they are slow  
Otherwise we cant catch them   
  
Chorus  
Im a knight Im a knight and Im a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
Im a knight Im a knight and Im a knight  
We are fighters and our armours always tight  
And these swords arent light  
  
Verse 3  
Rule three in war we aim to capture other knights alive  
Their families pay us lots of dosh so long as they survive  
We act like gentlemen and only fight with other gents  
A real knight he would never fight against peasants  
Anyway peasants pong Eurgh   
  
Chorus  
Im a knight Im a knight and Im a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
Im a knight Im a knight and Im a knight  
When we ride to war were such a splendid sight  
We are a sight
