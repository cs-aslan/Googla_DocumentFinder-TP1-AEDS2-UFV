The Potters Field  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
I fell asleep the other day  
Dreamed that I was falling  
And I woke up in a field of clay  
Voices were calling  
In the potters field  
In the potters field  
The broken pieces  
Lying on the ground  
It was the strangest thing  
Got up and began to dance around  
And I heard them sing  
chorus  
In the potters field  
Love is truly spoken  
Nothing is concealed  
Cause everything is broken  
In the potters field  
In the potters field  
And they sang about the garden  
Where Jesus was betrayed  
And how Judas tried to take back  
All the money hed been paid  
How the money bought the field of dirt  
The money bought the mud  
But all the broken pieces  
We have been purchased by the Blood  
In the potters field  
Love is truly spoken  
He has come to heal  
Everything thats broken  
In the potters field  
Love is truly spoken  
He has come to heal  
Everything thats broken  
Everything thats broken  
In the potters field  
In the potters field
