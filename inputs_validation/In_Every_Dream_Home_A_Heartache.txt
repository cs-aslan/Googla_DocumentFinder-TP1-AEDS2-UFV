In every dream home a heartache  
And every step I take  
Takes me further from heaven  
Is there a heaven  
Id like to think so  
Standards of living  
Theyre rising daily  
But home oh sweet home  
Its only a saying  
From bell push to faucet  
In smart town apartment  
The cottage is pretty  
The main house a palace  
Penthouse perfection  
But what goes on  
What to do there  
Better pray there  
  
Open plan living  
Bungalow ranch style  
All of its comforts  
Seem so essential  
I bought you mail order  
My plain wrapper baby  
Your skin is like vinyl  
The perfect companion  
You float my new pool  
De luxe and delightful  
Inflatable doll  
My role is to serve you  
Disposable darling  
Cant throw you away now  
Immortal and life size  
My breath is inside you  
Ill dress you up daily  
And keep you till death sighs  
  
Inflatable doll  
Lover ungrateful  
I blew up your body  
But you blew my mind  
  
Oh those heartaches  
Dreamhome heartaches
