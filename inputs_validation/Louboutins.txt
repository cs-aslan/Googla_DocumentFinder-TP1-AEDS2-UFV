Taking back my love 7X  
  
You said youd change  
But still nothin  
Youre still the same  
Im just a parttime lover  
And Im the blame  
Shoulda went away  
But yet I stayed  
With a parttime lover  
  
See some days you would love me  
Then you dont then you do then you wont  
Then youre here then youre gone Im alone  
Now you got me stressin out on the phone  
But its the last time  
Im moving on  
Im throwin on my Louboutins 9X  
  
I left the state  
And changed everything  
No more 818  
For the parttime lover  
What goes around  
Comes back around  
And then you get what you deserve  
You parttime lover  
  
See some days you would love me  
Then you dont then you do then you wont  
Then youre here then youre gone Im alone  
Now you got me stressin out on the phone  
But its the last time  
Im moving on  
Im throwin on my Louboutins 9X  
  
Watch these red bottoms  
And the back of my jeans  
Watch me go by babe  
  
You dont know what you got until its gone  
Tail lights is all youll see  
Watch that Benz exit that driveway  
  
Im throwin on my Louboutins 9x  
  
Watch me walk it out  
Walk it out 2X  
Walk this right up out the house  
Walk it out  
Boy watch me walk it out  
Walk it out  
Walk this right up out the house  
Im throwin on my Louboutins out the house 8X
