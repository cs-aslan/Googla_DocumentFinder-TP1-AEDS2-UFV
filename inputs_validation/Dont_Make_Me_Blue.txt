Dont make me blue dont make me blue  
I cant forget moments of love  
Im not too old to dream youre in my heart  
I cant forget these love and tears  
Your make up was wet turn back the years  
Oh I cant forget you babe you know its true  
Oh I cant forget you girl we are more than two  
  
Dont make me blue  
When the sky is grey  
And I want to fly  
With you night and day  
Dont leave me here  
Seas in my eyes  
Dont let it end  
My paradise  
  
Oh I dont care what people say  
Im walking through these walls if thats my way  
Like snow in June love is hard to find  
And I know for sure this girl is mine  
Oh I cant forget you babe you know its true  
Oh I cant forget you girl we are more than two  
  
Dont make me blue dont make me blue  
When the sky is grey when the sky is grey  
And I want to fly  
With you night and day  
Dont leave me here dont leave me here  
Seas in my eyes seas in my eyes  
Dont let it end  
My paradise  
  
Dont make me blue
