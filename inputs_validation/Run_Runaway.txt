I like black and white  
Dream in black in white  
You like black and white  
Run runaway  
  
Chorus  
See chameleon lying there in the sun  
All things to everyone  
Run runaway  
  
If your in the swing  
Money aint everything  
If your in the swing  
Run runaway  
  
Chorus  
  
If you got it sussed to figure out  
Dont beat around the bush  
If you got it sussed  
Run runaway  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
Oh now cant she wait  
No no come on and wait  
Oh now cant she wait  
Run runaway  
  
Chorus  
  
I like black and white  
Dream in black in white  
You like black and white  
Run runaway  
  
ChorusRepeat x2
