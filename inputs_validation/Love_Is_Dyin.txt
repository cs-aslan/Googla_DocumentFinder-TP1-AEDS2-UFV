You say that this is the end  
And I feel the knife cut off my right hand  
You may not care right now  
But if its over its done and I wont turn around  
  
Love is dyin  
There aint no use in cryin  
  
You oughta know me better than that  
I really love you if thats where its at  
I really love you but I wont be back  
Oh how I love you I love you but I wont be back  
  
A dreamer of dreamers I have always been  
And this time there wont be no givin in  
Chances are we could change our minds  
But I dont think I can make it another time  
  
Love is dyin  
There aint no use in cryin  
  
You oughta know me better than that  
I really love you if thats where its at  
I really love you but I wont be back  
Oh how I love you I love you but I wont be back  
  
Love is dyin  
There aint no use in cryin  
  
I really love you if thats where its at  
I really love you but I wont be back  
  
Love is dyin  
There aint no use in cryin
