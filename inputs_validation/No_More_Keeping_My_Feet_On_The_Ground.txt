Sometimes I wake up when Im falling asleep  
I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me  
But I wake up yes I wake up smiling  
  
Chorus  
So what I feel fine  
Im okay Ive seen the lighter side of life  
Im alright I feel good  
So ill go ill try to start moving  
  
Sometimes I wake up and Im falling asleep  
But Ive got to get going so much that I wanted to do  
But I wake up smiling  
  
And this could be my last chance  
Of saving my innocence  
And this could be my last chance  
No more keeping my feet on the ground  
  
Sometimes I feel the chance is surprising  
Surprisingly good to be moving around  
And I move and I wake up smiling  
  
Chorus  
  
And this could be my last chance  
Of saving my innocence  
And this could be my last chance  
No more keeping my feet on the ground  
  
And theres nothing to keep them  
Nothing to keep them down  
And theres nothing to keep them  
Theres nothing to keep them down
