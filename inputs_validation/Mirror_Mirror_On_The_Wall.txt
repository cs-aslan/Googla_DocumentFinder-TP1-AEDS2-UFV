ZRo  
Let my coedine settle and have a toast one time  
Multiplications on my digits come up over some time  
357 in my spine they cant hold me like Kobe Bryant  
Powered up popping tulips and clovers and stop signs  
Taylor made Gucci looking like a million bucks  
Neck full of gold baggets and trillion cuts  
I reside on cuts cause having money is a must  
Give me the issue or get touched the scuffling up  
Fuck with the raw like a cut cause I hit too hard  
Radio stations dont play cause I spit too hard  
I know they hate me everyday and I aint quit so far  
But if you cross the line AK is gone hit your car  
Hook  
Mirror mirror on the wall whos the throwdest of them all  
Cause you know my name its ZRo the Crooked  
ZRo the Mo City Don it aint over it just begun  
Mirror mirror on the wall whos the throwdest of them all  
Cause you know my name its ZRo represent the third coast  
Let my codeine settle and have a toast  
ZRo  
Im a guerilla thats after the scrilla I cock glocks  
Im the top knotch body armored like Shaq done blocked shots  
Dropping cops cause they crooked Im the law now  
Posted on the corner selling raw now  
Looking for them people keep an open eye  
And if I see the jackers never hesitate I gotta open fire  
Active like a live wire retalliation is a must  
Rock and buy these bezzels and then I bust  
Geniva watch telling me its time to ball  
Get in the line till I make it to the front and then its time to fall  
But if I ever fall off just fall back behind the scene  
Take seven catch me up in sitcoms and big screens  
Hook  
ZRo  
When I roll I roll one deep  
I never stop wrecking these HTown streets  
And aint nobody holding me down Im a roll Im rolling  
If you didnt know Southside still holding folding  
Big lemon faces got real money cause I catch cases  
Sipping on skeet tastes and Ima lean in private or public places  
Milicated refreshness keep my mind at ease  
Trying to reach another level keep me climbing trees  
Coming smoke out my nose bald faded minus before  
Keep it gangsta got groupie hoes striking a pose  
But see they aint getting chose or catch me tipping my dob  
I need a independent thug chick launder money and drug shit  
Im the boss hog aint nobody hogging me over harder  
Soft then Im off in the funk in my roller  
Hook  2x
