How old are you  
Are you old enough  
Should you be in here watching that  
And how old are you  
Are you owning up  
Should you be in here with  
  
Twenty four hour party people  
Plastic face cant smile the whites out  
With the twenty four hour party people plastic face cant smile the whites out  
  
You cannot beat them  
So why dont you join in  
You cannot beat them  
So why dont you join in with  
  
Twenty four hour party people  
Plastic face cant smile the whites out  
With the twenty four hour party people plastic face cant smiles the white out  
  
I can see you through the door  
You been chewing bread and water  
And theres a grudge on you  
You know you not ought not to have  
Youve been running around the racetrack  
Youve been running around the racetrack  
Put that mudder to bed to bed  
Put that mudder to bed  
  
With the twenty four hour party people plastic face cant smile the whites out  
Cause I have to wait for you to conduct  
Press the pause of the self destruct  
With the twenty four hour party people plastic face cant smile the whites out  
With the twenty four hour party people  
  
Now better youre the white out  
  
I need fulltime  
I dont need parttime  
I need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
3 6 5 all the time  
I need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 full time  
I dont need a parttime  
I need a 3 6 5  
  
Oh no days off  
  
Twenty four hour party people  
Plastic face cant smile the whites out  
I need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
3 6 5 all the time  
I need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 full time  
I dont need a parttime  
I need a 3 6 5
