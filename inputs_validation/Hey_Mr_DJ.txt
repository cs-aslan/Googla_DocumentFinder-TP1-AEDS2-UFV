Listen Mr DJ  
Wont you play me something slow  
Play me the songs  
For the lonely ones  
Play me something  
That I know  
  
Hey Mr DJ  
Im in a sad mood tonight  
Play me something just for me and my baby  
Wont you make everything alright  
  
Im gonna turn it way down low  
Leave it on all night long  
Till the morning comes  
Like my lover my friend until the end  
And that special someone  
  
Hey Mr DJ  
Play me Rainbow 66  
Cause Im drifting like a ship out on the fog  
And I just dont know whats coming next  
  
Gonna turn it way down low  
Leave it on all night long  
Until the morning comes  
For my lover my friend until the end  
And that special someone  
  
Hey Mr DJ  
Play me Rainbow 66  
Cause Im drifting like a ship out on the sea  
And I just dont know whats coming next  
  
Well Mr DJ  
Im in a sad mood tonight  
Play me something for me and my darling  
Want you to make everything  
Alright  
  
La ta ta ta tata
