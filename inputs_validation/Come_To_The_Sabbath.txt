Come come to the sabbath down by the  
Ruined bridge  
Witches and demons are coming  
Just follow the magic call  
Come come to the sabbath down by the  
Ruined bridge  
Later on the master will join us  
Called from the heart of hell  
At first we light up a fire and then we hail  
Our lord  
Two candles a black and a white are placed  
Upon the altar  
North south east and west and so we  
Clean the air  
High priestess invoking the devil infernal  
Names are spoken  
Come to the sabbathsabbath  
sabbathsabbath  
Come to the sabbath  
The ceremonys proceeding its time to  
Grant your wishes  
An evil curse on the priest who took the life  
Of melissa  
Now we must close up the ritual read the  
Enochian key  
And so it will be done amen now come  
Come to the sabbathsabbath  
sabbathsabbath  
Come to the sabbathnow here we come  
Solo hs  
If you say heaven I say a castle of lies  
You say forgive him I say revenge  
My sweet satan you are the one
