You like ridin around with your big brother in your uncles custom van  
You want to bleach your hair so bad but your mama dont understand  
Hangin around by the monument dancin to the radio  
You got a memory even shorter than your dress  
But theres nothin that you dont know  
  
Chorus  
Priscilla Priscilla nearly sixteen but they treat you like a kid  
Priscilla Priscilla theyre gonna kill ya for what you did  
  
Cuttin class with a backstage pass and always skippin lunch  
Ya put your hand on the knees of the boys and daddys vodka in the punch  
Learned how to jump start your grandmas car how to French inhale your Kools  
And now you know that breakin hearts is easy as breakin the rules  
  
Chorus  
  
You dont remember no revolution you dont belong to no baby boom  
  
Just you and your headphones dreamin in your pink bedroom  
  
Strong girls break the records and rich girls break their nails  
  
Smart girls always know by heart what some girls always fail  
  
Bad little girls grow up to be good and good girls finish last  
  
But crazy girls dont care how they grow up as long as they grow up fast  
  
Chorus
