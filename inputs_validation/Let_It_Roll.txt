Cold run speed highway was the place where wed all go  
When our nerves were razor sharp and wed all let it roll  
Let it roll  
Let it roll let it roll  
Let it roll  
  
Our machines geared up and were really layin it down  
Layin it out let it roll  
  
When these wheels get rollin  
Let em roll right over you  
Cause Im well greased down and Ill always win it through  
Let it roll let it roll  
Let it roll  
  
Our machines geared up and were really layin it down  
Layin it out let it roll
