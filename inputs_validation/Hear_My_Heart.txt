Hear my heart hear the sound it makes of love  
The sound that whispers I love only you  
Every beat seems to tell me that well meet  
Yet I know youre meeting someone new  
  
Ask youre heart if our love is really lost  
If it answers yes Ill know it then  
But if theres a chance then darling well have our romance  
Then darling we will be sweethearts again  
  
Ask youre heart if our love is really lost  
If it answers yes Ill know it then  
But if theres a chance then darling well have our romance  
Then darling we will be sweethearts again
