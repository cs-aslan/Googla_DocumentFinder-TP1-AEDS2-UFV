You know it hurts me  
When I cant be next to you  
And though were young I know  
You feel the same way too  
Deep in our hearts we know  
Its just a matter of time  
Cause well be together one day  
And when we met  
Out on the streets along the way  
It wasnt by chance that we  
Were passing by that day  
As sure as theres a moon  
And stars above I know  
Well be together for sure  
As sure as that nose on your face  
We were meant for each others arms  
Just as one and one make two  
You were made for me  
I was made for unverified  
dont try to hide that smile  
I know thats on your face  
And when you unverified at me  
Ill look the other way  
And we wont give away  
What we know from the start  
That weve got that love in our hearts  
Deep in our hearts  
In our hearts weve got that love  
In our hearts weve got that love  
In our hearts weve got that love  
Oh deep down in our hearts  
Weve got that love  
Oh were very into lovin yeah  
Oh that love in our hearts  
Weve got that love in our hearts  
Oh baby weve got that love
