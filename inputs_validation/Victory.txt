Chorus  
Ive got got the victory  
Ive got the sweet sweet victory in Jesus  
Yes I do  
He is a mighty conqueror  
In him I will trust all my battles hell fight  
Ive got got the victory  
Ive got the sweet sweet victory in Jesus  
For me he died but he rose on the third day  
Thats why I have true victory every day  
  
Truly Ive been through the storm and rain  
I know everything about heartache and pain  
But God carried me through it all  
Without his protection I would surely fall  
Ive been broke without a dime to my name  
But all my bills got paid  
Because I called on Jesus name  
You cant tell me that God isnt real  
Cause Ive got the victory  
And thats why Im still here  
  
Chorus  
  
Im not worried about material things I dont have  
Im just blessed cause I know that my saviors there  
Because I know that my blessing is on the way  
I cant see it right now but I stand by faith  
Ive fought many many battles in his name  
Ive held up the bloodstained banner  
And proclaimed that Jesus is the truth and the light  
Believe me when I say he will make it right  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah I got the victory yeah  
I got the victory yeah yeah yeah  
And if you got the victory sing along with me  
Yeah Ive got the victory yeah  
I got the victory yeah yeah yeah  
Sing it with me Ive got the victory  
  
Chorus
