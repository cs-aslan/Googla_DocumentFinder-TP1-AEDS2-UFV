What can the problem be  
Sweet Mehehehehelanie  
Why wont you go out with me  
  
She lived across the street on the fifteenth floor of the Gilmore building  
I saw her in the shower reaching for some soap  
I knew she had to be the girl for me  
And to think I probably never would have found her  
If I hadnt bought that telescope  
  
Oh mehehehelanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet mehehehehelanie  
Why wont you go out with me  
  
I just cant understand it  
Why wont you return my phone calls  
Are you still mad I gave a Mohawk to your cat  
If youd just say the word  
Im certain that our love would last forever and ever  
Or are you too dumb to realize that

What can the problem be  
Sweet mehehehehelanie  
Why wont you go out with me  
How can you ignore me when you know that I cant live without you  
I have to go through your garbage just to learn more about you  
  
Melanie ooh  
Oh sweet mehehehelanie  
Why wont you go out with me  
  
You werent impressed when I tattooed your name across my forehead  
You wouldnt listen when I promised to be true  
I couldnt stand it so I jumped out from the sixteenth story window  
Right above you  
Now I may be dead but I still love you
