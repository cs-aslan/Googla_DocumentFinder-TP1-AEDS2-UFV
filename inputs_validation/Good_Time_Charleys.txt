Oh I know a place called Good Time Charleys  
A little four piece band swingin out of sight  
And Ill be here if you want to party  
Come nine in the morning til twelve at night  
Two miles from town cross the railroad track  
Turn right at the light and park in the back  
Youre always welcome dont forget to drop in  
Old Good Time Charleys any time you can  
Well I heard talk bout a troublemaker  
Dropped in one night and never came again  
Well they said he left with an undertaker  
Old Charleys done time two years in the pen  
Well the beat goes on theres a hardwood floor  
And the sound of laughter runnin out the door  
Wall to wall women plenty of icecold beer  
Anything youre after you can find in here  
Two miles from town cross the railroad track  
Turn right at the light and park in the back  
Youre always welcome dont forget to drop in  
Old Good Time Charleys any time you can  
And youre always welcome dont forget to drop in  
Old Good Time Charleys any time you can
