I want to be your honey man  
I want to be I want to be your honey man  
To wash your clothes and hold your hand  
I want to be I want to be your honey man  
  
Youve got a lot  
But all of your money and stuff  
Just isnt enough to buy what I can give  
When things get rough  
And all of your friendliest friends  
Are turning to dust  
  
We will live  
You know Ill give you the world  
Ill sacrifice girl anything  
Ill do it all on my own believe me
