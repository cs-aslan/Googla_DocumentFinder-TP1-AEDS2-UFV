Dolly Parton  
Blue me blue me  
Blue is the color  
That fits best on me  
Im blue  
Just as blue as can be  
Blue me Blue me  
I cry  
And I die  
I lie awake at night  
And I question why  
Must it be  
I can never be free  
Blue me Blue me  
My heart is heavy  
But its empty inside  
No one to love me  
Or to lay down beside  
Im blue  
The queen of sorrow  
Wears royal blue  
My luck aint changin  
Is it ever goin to  
Im blue Oh Im blue  
Why must I wear this robe of blue misery  
Blue me Blue me  
Ooh  
This sad old feeling  
Is breakin me down  
No satisfaction with these blues hangin round  
Lord Im blue  
Oh Im so blue Why cant I shake it tell me where will this end  
When will I get out of this blue rut Im in  
Oh Im blue  
Looks like the blues just took a liking to me  
Blue me Blue me Blue me Blue me  
Blue is the color that fits best on me  
Ooooh Im blue  
Im just as blue as can be  
Blue me  
Blue me
