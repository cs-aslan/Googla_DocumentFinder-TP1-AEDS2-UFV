Dry drunk on a corner  
Wet waste of a girl  
Theme for a jackal  
  
Play you deathsong  
You probably listen  
Stand idly by as they rape your children  
Like you do now  
In fact you showed them how  
  
All thoughts are in place  
All deeds are complete  
Play theme for a jackal play  
  
Die sweet prince  
Meat tastes like mince  
The jackals eaten enough for today  
  
Die sweet prince  
Meat tastes like shit  
Enough to make that jackal spit  
  
Spit jackal spit  
Spit and choke on the lives youve taken  
You cant shake them loose  
  
All morsels are gone theyre too small  
Accessible from a source so tall  
Little sister all of my love  
  
Bitch  
Bitch she is  
Cut her from the inside out  
  
Dead daughter in the river  
Entrance gained by her liver  
Play theme for a jackal play  
  
They play you a deathsong  
You probably listen  
Stand idly by as they rape your children  
Like you do now  
In fact you showed them how  
Play theme for a jackal play  
Play theme for a jackal play
