Here I am waiting Ill have to leave soon  
Why am I still holding on  
We knew this day would come we knew it all along  
How did it come so fast  
This is our last night but its late  
And Im trying not to sleep  
Cause I know when I wake  
I will have to slip away  
  
And when the daylight comes Ill have to go  
But tonight Im gonna hold you so close  
Cause in the daylight well be on our own  
But tonight I need to hold you so close  
Ooh whoa ooh whoa ooh whoa  
Ooh whoa ooh whoa ooh whoa  
  
Here I am staring at your perfection  
In my arms so beautiful  
The sky is getting bright the stars are burning out  
Somebody slow it down  
This is way too hard  
Cause I know when the sun comes up  
I will leave this is my last glance  
That will soon be memory  
  
And when the daylight comes Ill have to go  
But tonight Im gonna hold you so close  
Cause in the daylight well be on our own  
But tonight I need to hold you so close  
Ooh whoa ooh whoa ooh whoa  
Ooh whoa ooh whoa ooh whoa  
  
I never wanted to stop  
Because I dont wanna start all over start all over  
I was afraid of the dark  
But now its all that I want all that I want all that I want  
  
And when the daylight comes Ill have to go  
But tonight Im gonna hold you so close  
Cause in the daylight well be on our own  
But tonight I need to hold you so close  
  
And when the daylight comes Ill have to go  
But tonight Im gonna hold you so close  
Cause in the daylight well be on our own  
But tonight I need to hold you so close  
Ooh whoa ooh whoa ooh whoa  
Ooh whoa ooh whoa ooh whoa  
  
Ooh whoa yeah ooh whoa yeah ooh whoa yeah  
Ooh whoa yeah ooh whoa yeah ooh whoa
