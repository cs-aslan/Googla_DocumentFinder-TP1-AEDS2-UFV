Jack my friend hes a busy man  
Trying to hustle an easy buck instead of a good mans dollar  
Oh Jack my buddy hes so goddamn full of money  
Workin for a funny company for his father  
He got a black satin shirt best you could buy  
And a big fat straw hat to match his white tie  
And a shiny thirtyeight thatll look you straight in your eye  
Jack miraculous he was a sure spectaculous  
The son of a New York gun  
Look out Jack   
He got a black satin shirt best you could buy  
And a big fat straw hat to match his white tie  
And a big twentytwo thatll make you do what he want  
Jack miraculous he was a sure spectaculous  
The son of a New York gun  
Look out Jack  Jack miraculous  
The son of a New York gun  
Look out Jack
