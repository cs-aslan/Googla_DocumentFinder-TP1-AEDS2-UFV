Im gonna stay Im gonna stay  
  
The pain inside  
When you think you love another  
But cant decide which way to go  
And youre searching for a reason to leave his side  
In time youll see  
It has to be this way  
And though it hurts to say  
Im gonna be staying with my baby  
  
Im gonna stay Im gonna stay  
I know hes good for me  
I can see that hes feeling down  
Im gonna stay Im gonna stay  
But I know he cares for me  
And in time he will come around  
So dry your eyes before you turn away  
You must know that Ill always love you  
But now Im staying with my baby  
  
You used to say  
I should maybe take it further  
And leave one day  
My family  but Im responsible for them  
They depend on me  
So now you see our love is history  
Im sad it has to end  
But Im gonna be staying with my baby  
  
Im gonna stay Im gonna stay  
I know hes good for me  
I can see that hes feeling down  
Im gonna stay Im gonna stay  
But I know he cares for me  
And in time he will come around  
So dry your eyes before you turn away  
You must know that Ill always love you  
But now Im staying with my baby  
Im staying with my baby yes I am  
  
Please understand  
Hes just a desperate man  
Whos doing all he can  
So Im going back  
  
Im gonna stay Im gonna stay  
I know hes good for me  
I can see that hes feeling down  
Im gonna stay Im gonna stay  
But I know he cares for me  
And in time he will come around  
Im gonna stay Im gonna stay  
Im gonna stay  
Im gonna stay Im gonna stay  
Im gonna stay
