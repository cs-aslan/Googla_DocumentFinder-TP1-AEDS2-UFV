Looking at you now you seem just a shadow  
You had the energy to recharge our batteries  
I suppose your success became your security  
Darkness is not what you need  
  
You were the one who refused to give up  
You were the one who lifted us lifted us off our knees  
Now its our turn to give you some help  
Fresh air thats just what you need  
  
Not the stale bread from the failing bitter table  
Its so hard  
Wheres the justice we cry  
Its there and will follow us til the day we die til  
The day that we die  
  
Looking at you know you seem just a shadow  
You had the energy and you recharged our batteries  
Now its our turn to give you some help  
Fresh air thats just what you need  
  
Now its our turn to give you some help  
Fresh air thats just what you need  
Thats just what you need
