Maybe we dont need to share the same roof maybe  
If you really love me you dont need me round for proof baby  
If I go to the desert for some clean dry air  
We could have ourselves a long distance love affair  
Well take it anywhere a nationwide pair  
Well If your living together isnt working out  
Id rather live in Nebraska than keep livin here in doubt  
Ill take an alternate route Ill find a new way  
There are places to go that weve never dreamed of  
Were gonna find a new way to love  
  
Chorus  
Were gonna find a new way to love find out what satisfies us  
The good old ways just aint good enough  
Were gonna find a new way to love  
  
Maybe we could learn to like the same things maybe  
Discover the joy that togetherness brings baby  
We could share our records we could see the same plays  
Even plan our vacations for the very same days  
Well put our lives in phase livin in a happiness haze  
Well it may not be easy but then nothin else was  
Ask a mountain climber why he does what he does  
Hell tell you just because I need to find a new way  
Hey now weve got a mountain of our own to rise above  
Were gonna find a new way to love  
  
Chorus  
  
Maybe we dont need to see eye to eye maybe  
We dont need to vote for the very same guy baby  
You can move to the left whenever I keep right  
Im a big bad wolf you can be Snow White  
Ive got a huge appetite you want to eat light  
Im down here beggin for more you tell me youve had enough  
We gotta find a new way to love  
  
Chorus x4  
  
Were gonna find a new way to love
