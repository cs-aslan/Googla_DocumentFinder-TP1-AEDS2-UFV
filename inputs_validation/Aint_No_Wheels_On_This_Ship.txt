Row Row Row  
Row Row Row  
I use to have big money  
That was many moons ago  
You use to call me honey  
Now you call me so and so  
Cause there aint no wheels on this ship  
And we cant row row row  
We cant row row row  
We cant row  
Row row row  
Row row row  
You use to be big papa  
The cat of every ball  
Now listen little papa  
Well Im at your big downfall  
Cause there aint no wheels on this ship  
And we cant row row row  
We cant row row row  
We cant row  
Row row row  
Row row row  
You use to like my lovin  
Because you liked my gold  
Now ya dont want my lovin  
Cause there aint no dough no more  
And there aint no wheels on this ship  
And we cant row row row  
We cant row row row  
We cant row  
Row row row  
Row row row  
Well I tell you for the last time  
And I told you this before  
If you want to keep your mama  
Ya gotta love me more and more  
Cause there aint no wheels on this ship  
And we cant row row row  
We cant row row row  
We cant row
