The winds of life will blow  
Theyre sure to come and go  
They meet me at a time when Im calm and feeling fine  
But the captain of my soul is always on board  
He rocks me in his arms  
While Im riding through the storm  
  
While riding through the storm  
Jesus hold me in his arms  
And I am not afraid of the stormy winds and the rains  
Although clouds become high  
Jesus holds me while I ride  
I find safety in the Masters arms  
While Im riding through a storm  
  
I have no fear on the raging sea  
Knowing Jesus is there for me  
He can speak to the winds and the wave  
And make them behave  
All powers in his hand  
On sea or dry land  
I find safety in my Masters arms  
While Im riding through a storm  
Riding through a storm
