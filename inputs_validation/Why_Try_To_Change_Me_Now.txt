Im sentimental  
So I walk in the rain  
Ive got some habits  
Even I cant explain  
Go to the corner  
I end up in Spain  
Why try to change me now  
  
I sit and daydream  
Ive got daydreams galore  
Cigarette ashes  
There they go on the floor  
Go away weekends  
Leave my keys in the door  
Why try to change me now  
  
Why cant I be more conventional  
People talk  
People stare  
So I try  
But cant be  
Cause I cant see  
My strange little world  
Just go passing me by  
  
So let people wonder  
Let em laugh  
Let em frown  
You know Ill love you  
Till the moons upside down  
Dont you remember  
I was always your clown  
Why try to change me now  
  
Dont you remember  
I was always your clown  
Why try to change me  
Why try to change me now
