Walk around in circles  
Without peace and little sleep  
Cant cool down and unwind  
What Im feeling is a feeling  
Thats just you down deep  
Got a man on my mind  
Havent seen him for so long  
Hes always on the go  
Not the sticking round kind  
I dont care whatever happens  
One thing I do know  
Got a man on my mind  
Sometimes I stand there  
Just starrin into space  
And I talk about how I feel yeah yeah  
Being there  
Yet I clearly see his face  
And I hold him and hes quite real  
Never thought that I could care  
For anyone that much  
Oh how wrong can you be  
Im so hungry for his kisses  
For his tender touch  
Hes the whole world for me  
Oooh  
Walk around in circles  
Without peace and without sleep  
Cant cool down and unwind  
What Im feeling is a feeling  
Thats just you down deep  
Got a man on my mind  
Sometimes I stand there  
Just starrin into space  
And I talk about how I feel oh yeah  
Being there  
Yet I clearly see his face  
And I hold him and hes quite real  
Walk around in circles  
Without peace and without sleep  
Got a man on my mind  
Im hungry for kisses  
Im thirsty for love  
Got a man on my mind
