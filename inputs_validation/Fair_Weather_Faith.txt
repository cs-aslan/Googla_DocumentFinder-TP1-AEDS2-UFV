Prentending to act so serene  
On your so called submissive knees  
A shopping list of begging pleas  
Adds to your complacencies  
As soon as the sun dont shine your way  
And youre saving it all up that rainy day  
Its a matter of time before you get down n pray  
Fair weather faith  protect me from the storm  
Fair weather faith  gonna right all my wrongs  
Fair weather faith  you know Im doing alright  
Fair weather faith  out of mind out of sight  
Well I wonder if the man upstairs  
Will bother to lend an ear  
If you took the time to share  
Another one of your puppet prayers  
I aint talkin bout the weather
