A song I heard the ocean sing  
A shining light in darkness deep  
I prayed a prayer into the tide  
And both they soothed me in my sleep  
  
For every season that has passed  
I prayed a prayer into the tide  
A shining light in darkness deep  
In my ten years before the mast  
  
For every season that has passed  
I laid my body oer the side  
A shining light in darkness deep  
I prayed a prayer into the tide  
  
How can I answer questions Ive known  
How can I answer questions Ive known  
How can I answer questions Ive known  
How can I answer questions Ive known  
  
A song I heard the ocean sing  
A shining light in darkness deep  
Ten years before the mast  
I heard the ocean sing
