What can I say now after all is said and done  
You cut me up in pieces when the shooting first begun  
What did I do to you to make you turn away  
cause now theres nothing left for me  
Theres nothing I can say  
  
Now its too late you feeling sorry  
Youll never change  
And theres nothing you can do about it  
  
Falling out  why did you do it to me yeah  
Falling out  cutting me up into pieces  
Falling out  you know that you upset me yeah  
Falling out  you know that Im so hurt baby  
  
You said you loved me I believed you for a while  
You sure could fool the angels  
When you use that painted smile  
I should have known that it was too good to be true  
But now that its all over you know I wont forget you  
  
Now its too late you feeling sorry  
Youll never change  
And theres nothing you can do about it  
  
Falling out  why did you do it to me yeah  
Falling out  cutting me up into pieces  
Falling out  you know that you upset me yeah  
Falling out  you know that Im so hurt baby  
  
So now its over and theres nothing left to say  
The flame that burned within my heart  
Now slowly fades away  
So dont you ever think of knocking at my door  
Just turn the light out close your eyes  
And think of me no more  
  
And its too late to say youre sorry  
Youll never change  
And theres nothing you can do about it  
  
Falling out  why did you do it to me yeah  
Falling out  cutting me up into pieces  
Falling out  you know that you upset me yeah  
Falling out  you know that Im so hurt baby
