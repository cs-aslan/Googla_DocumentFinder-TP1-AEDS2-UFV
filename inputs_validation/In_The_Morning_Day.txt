Everybodys got the blues  
In the morning day yeah  
If you find the answer  
And you wonder  
Lets find a way  
I want to give you happiness  
Just like the sun gives to the day  
Id like to make you mine yeah  
Im gonna make you mine  
Just like a blinding dream  
Yeah youre gonna be with me  
  
Strolling through a summers breeze  
And you find its not the rain  
Leaving wrong behind you  
All your fantasies so very plain  
  
I want to give you happiness  
Just like the sun gives to the day  
Id like to make you mine yeah  
Im gonna make you mine  
Just like a blinding dream  
Yeah youre gonna be with me
