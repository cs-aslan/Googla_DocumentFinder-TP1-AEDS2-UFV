Here you are again  
Tellin me youre sorry baby  
Tellin me you wanna come on back home  
Where you belong  
  
There you go again  
Lyin and alibiin  
Singin that same old worn out song  
Here it comes now  
  
I cant hear you no more  
Ive heard it all before  
You aint a reachin me no how  
No way no time until dooms day  
  
I cant hear you no more  
I cant hear you no more  
  
You walked out on me  
Once too often baby  
And I cant take no more of your jive  
And thats the truth  
  
I aint about to let you  
Run me into the ground  
Im not gonna throw away my youth  
No not hardly  
  
I cant hear you no more  
Ive heard it all before  
You aint a reachin me no how  
No way no time until dooms day  
  
I cant hear you no more  
I cant hear you no more  
  
You aint a reachin me no how  
No way no time until dooms day  
I cant hear you no more  
I cant hear you no more  
  
You gotta speak out louder  
You gotta speak out louder  
Cause I cant hear you no more  
I cant hear you no more  
Just a little bit louder
