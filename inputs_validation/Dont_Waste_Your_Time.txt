Its over its over its over  
  
It seems you cant hear me  
When I open my mouth you never listen  
You say stay but what does that mean  
Do you think that I honestly want to be reminded forever  
  
Chorus  
Dont waste your time trying to fix  
What I want to erase  
What I need to forget  
Dont waste your time on me my friend  
Friend what does that even mean  
I dont want your hand  
Youll only pull me down  
So save your breath  
Dont waste your song on me on me  
Dont waste your time  
  
Its not easy not answering  
Everytime I want to talk to you  
But I cant  
If you only knew the hell I put myself through  
Replaying memories in my head of you and I  
Every night  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre calling  
Youre talking  
Youre trying  
Trying to get in  
But its over its over  
Its over friend  
  
Dont waste your time trying to fix it  
So save your breath  
Dont waste your song on me on me  
Dont waste your time  
  
You held me  
You felt me  
You left me  
But its over its over its over  
You touched me  
You had me  
But its over its over  
Its over my friend  
Dont waste my time
