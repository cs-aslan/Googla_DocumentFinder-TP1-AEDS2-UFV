Tired of playing this game  
And I wont play it no more  
And I wont take it no more  
Through with being your fool  
And I wont do it no more  
And I wont I wont keep up this act  
Not for one minute  
Im gonna pull Im gonna pull this curtain down  
  
Chorus  
This time I wont play this game  
I made a vow to make a change  
And I bow out  
I wont be hanging around baby  
I decline to take the pain  
And I resign the masquerade  
And I bow out  
I wont be staying around baby  
I bow out  
  
Cant go on with the show  
Youre just a stage I went through  
Now youre just fading from view yeah baby  
Its time for a change of scene  
Guess Ill be taking my leave  
I guess I wont I wont stay in this play  
Not for one minute  
Im gonna make Im gonna make my exit now  
Oh baby  
  
Chorus  
  
When youre left standing on that stage all alone  
Maybe you will realize  
You should of learned to treat me right  
And when this final act is finally through  
Maybe youll wish youd been  
The kind of man you should have been  
Now watch me say goodbye  
And walk right out of your life  
Oh baby all right babe  
  
Chorus x2
