The secret of life  
Is enjoying the passage of time  
Any fool can do it  
There aint nothing to it  
Nobody knows how we got  
To the top of the hill  
But since were on our way down  
We might as well enjoy the ride  
  
The secret of love  
Is in opening up your heart  
Its okay to feel afraid  
But dont let that stand in your way  
Cause anyone knows  
That love is the only road  
And since were only here for a while  
Might as well show some style  
Give us a smile  
  
Isnt it a lovely ride  
Sliding down gliding down  
Try not to try too hard  
Its just a lovely ride  
  
Now the thing about time  
Is that time isnt really real  
Its just your point of view  
How does it feel for you  
Einstein said he  
Could never understand it all  
Planets spinning through space  
The smile upon your face  
Welcome to the human race  
  
Some kind of lovely ride  
Ill be sliding down  
Ill be gliding down  
Try not to try too hard  
Its just a lovely ride  
Isnt it a lovely ride  
Sliding down gliding down  
Try not to try too hard  
Its just a lovely ride  
The secret of life  
Is enjoying the passage of time
