It aint over till its over  
  
Here we are still together  
We are one  
So much time wasted  
Playing games with love  
  
So many tears Ive cried  
So much pain inside  
But baby it aint over till its over  
  
So many years weve tried  
To keep our love alive  
But baby it aint over till its over  
  
How many times did we give up  
But we always worked things out  
And all my doubts and fear  
Kept me wondering if Id always be in love  
  
So many tears Ive cried  
So much pain inside  
But baby it aint over till its over  
  
So many years weve tried  
To keep our love alive  
But baby it aint over till its over  
  
So many tears Ive cried  
So much pain inside  
But baby it aint over till its over  
  
So many years weve tried  
To keep our love alive  
But baby it aint over till its over
