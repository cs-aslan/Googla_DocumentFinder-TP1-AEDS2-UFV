Look whos advertising  
Billboards everywhere  
See hellacious acres  
Your tailor made nightmare  
Traffic is backed up for miles  
Attendants welcome you with devilish smiles  
Steadysteady   
Have your tickets ready  
Steadysteady   
Go to hell  
After dark  
Its a sin filled city  
An amusement park  
Its a one way ticket to the other side  
Its a Dr Jekyll and a Mr Hyde  
See Lizzie Borden shes one of the stars  
And tricky Dicky barkin  
Flashin you his pardon  
Jack the ripper slashin your tires  
Even the devil needs money  
To cover his overhead  
Thats why he opened hellacious acres  
Or so his press agent said  
Hang out with heavies  
Your partners in crime  
Forget the consequences have a good time  
Steadysteady   
Have your tickets ready  
Steadysteady   
Go to hell  
After dark  
Its a sin filled city  
An amusement park  
Its a one way ticket to the other side  
Its a Dr Jekyll and a Mr Hyde  
Get down and study suspicion and doubt  
At hellacious acres  
Listen mischief makers
