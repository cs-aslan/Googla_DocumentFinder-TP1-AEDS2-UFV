Staring in the window of the shop that never opens  
Planning my selection from all the treats inside  
Should I take as I desire  oh shall I oh shall I   
Or should I hang around to be enticed inside   
  
Im trying to explain to myself  
I can have both  
Im trying to explain to the voice inside  
I can have both  
I can have both  
Theres nobody around to say no  
Whove brainwashed the small shy boy inside  
He doesnt know he can have both  
  
Smiling through the window to the one who never serves you  
Ive not been feeling myself tonight  
Should I take as I feel like it  well shall I oh shall I   
Or should I wait and hope to be dragged inside   
Oh  
  
Im trying to explain to myself  
I can have both  
Im trying to explain to the voice inside  
I can have both  
I can have both  
Theres nobody around to say no  
Whove brainwashed the small shy boy inside  
He doesnt know he can have both  
  
I can have both  
Theres no need to choose  
Because  
I can have both  
Theres no need to choose  
I can have both  
Theres no need to choose  
Because  
I can have both  
Theres no need to choose  
I can have both  
Theres no need to choose
