15 years together  
We climbed by work and will  
From a simple two room cottage  
To a mansion on the hill  
Now theres rose in the garden  
But its the coldest place in town  
It took 15 years goin up  
And one night coming down  
  
15 years of heaven  
For one short night of sin  
From blue skies forever  
To an end  
From out on a mountain  
To both knees on the ground  
15 years goin up  
And one night coming down  
  
Her dreams have all been shattered  
Her faith in my is gone  
My tears tell her Im sorry  
But they cant write my wrong  
One night wrote my story  
How a man can lose it all  
After 15 years goin up  
Its hard to take a fall  
  
15 years of heaven  
For one short night of sin  
From blue skies forever  
To an end  
From out on a mountain  
To both knees on the ground  
15 years goin up  
And one night coming down  
  
Ive been 15 years goin up  
And one night comin down
