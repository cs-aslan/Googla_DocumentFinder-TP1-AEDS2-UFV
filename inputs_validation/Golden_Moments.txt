Now if all my golden moments could be rolled into one  
They would shine just like the sun for a summer day  
And after it was over we could have it back again  
With credit to the editor for striking out the rain very clean  
And all it really needed was the proper point of view  
  
No ones gonna bring me down no ones gonna stop me now  
  
Now I gathered up my sorrows and I sold them all for gold  
and I gathered up the gold and I threw it all away  
It all went for a good time and a song come on  
The laughter was like music it did float my soul along for a while  
And all it really needed was the proper point of view  
  
No ones gonna reach me here no ones gonna know Im gone  
  
You may think I might be crazy and I guess you might be right  
but I know the way I feel today is out of sight  
I do not trust your senses to remember your name  
Without corrective lenses things are never twice the same anyway  
And all it really needed was the proper point of view  
  
No ones gonna bring me down no ones gonna stop me now  
No ones gonna reach me here no ones gonna know Im gone
