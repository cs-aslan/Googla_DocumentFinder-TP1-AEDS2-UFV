Two more days and well be home  
Two more days and we wont be alone  
Well see things that we recognize  
Well get to look in our babys eyes  
And I know that youre lonesome baby  
Its hard hanging on  
I know that youre tired baby  
But Ill help you be strong  
Chorus  
Cause Im gonna hold you tighter tighter  
Tighter tighter tighter tighter  
Baby  
Im gonna hold you tighter tighter  
Tighter tighter tighter tighter  
Baby yeah yeah  
Weve been out on a thirtyday gig  
Paid our dues cause thats how we live  
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry  
Sometimes were weary and sometimes were high  
Hey I know that youre lonesome baby  
Its hard hanging on  
I know that youre tired baby  
But Ill help you be strong  
Chorus  
Howd you tell a baby thats just eight months old  
Her daddy and momma gotta work on the road  
Every night she wont get kissed  
Cause were out here trying  
To get her all the things that we missed  
And I know that youre lonesome baby  
Its hard hanging on  
I know that youre tired baby  
But Ill help you be strong  
Chorus  
Its seems kinda funny that it aint just you and me  
The number was two and now we changed to three  
We added one more color and the color made us brighter  
But to keep our rainbow blowing now we gotta be a fighter  
And I know that youre lonesome baby  
Its hard hanging on  
I know that youre tired baby  
But Ill help you be strong  
Chorus
