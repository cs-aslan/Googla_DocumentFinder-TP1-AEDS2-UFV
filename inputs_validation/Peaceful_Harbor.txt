Ive been sailing these seas for most of all these years  
Riding the crest of a wave made of tears  
Ive been drifting on a troubled sea  
traveling aimlessly  
till I put my anchor down on Peaceful Harbor  
  
Well the winds of dispair were blowing on my face  
till the day I felt the gentle breeze of amazing Grace  
So I chartered a brand new course  
Let the Savior be my guiding Host  
Then I put my anchor down on Peaceful Harbor  
  
Now Ive emptied all my cargo  
on the docks of Heavens gate  
Troubled seas Im traveling no more  
My sailing life is over  
My legs have felt the land  
Standing now upon the other shore  
  
Well Im watching the sun set down on a peaceful sea  
Never in all my life have I felt so free  
Now Im standing upon the shore  
sailing out no more  
since I put my anchor down in Peaceful Harbor  
since I put my anchor down in Peaceful Harbor  
since I put my anchor down in Peaceful Harbor
