Forgotten about you before your body cold in a coffin  
Just another failed attempt you fall through the cracks  
Sure as God made man the first man was Black  
The Black man made pyramids and gangsta rap  
Thats all I know cause poppa didnt raise no rats  
Face the facts not the fiction  
I Build my empire from a pocket full of stones  
And a fifth of ambition  
Niggas want to ball but they never want to listen  
So instead of coming up they just come up missin  
My mission is to hit with precision shake whole continents

I know pussy sells faster than crack ambassador rap  
Twist back your salary cap who fuckin with that  
Welcome to the X games enjoy my pain  
Inhale my smoke its hard not to cough or choke  
Motorola nigga up the old fashion way  
This aint rap this is shit that I was born to say  
Though lately I been having dillemas with insignificant niggas  
And halfass rappers that think they can get it  
We the Golden State we keep the whole thing bouncing  
Whyall move units we move mountains  
Whyall rap for bullshit tryna be on TV  
We seen you now we dont like Chandra Levy Ima  
  
Chorus
