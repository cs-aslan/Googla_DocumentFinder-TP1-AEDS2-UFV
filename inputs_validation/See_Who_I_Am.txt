Is it true what they say  
Are we too blind to find a way  
Fear of the unknown clouds our hearts today  
Come into my world  
See trough my eyes  
Try to understand  
Dont want to lose what we have  
  
Weve been dreaming  
But who can deny  
Its the best way of living  
Between the truth and the lies  
  
Chorus  
See who I am  
Break through the surface  
Reach for my hand  
Lets show them that we can  
Free our minds and find a way  
The world is in our hands  
This is not the end  
  
Fear is withering the soul  
At the point of no return  
We must be the change  
We wish to see  
Ill come into your world  
See trough your eyes  
Ill try to understand  
Before we lose what we have  
  
We just cant stop believing  
Because we have to try  
We can rise above  
Their truth and their lies  
  
Chorus  
  
I hear their silence  
Preaching my blame  
Will our strength remain  
If their power reigns  
  
Chorus
