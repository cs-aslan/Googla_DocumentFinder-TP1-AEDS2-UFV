Youre banging your drum  
You blow your own trumpet  
Your ship came in  
And your fanfare sunk it  
The tide has turned  
Our loves gone forever  
I stand on the shore  
As it floats down the river  
  
Chorus  
I had such hopes  
I had such visions planned  
The frames were shot  
But now our futures canned  
I had my hopes so high  
They fell right down  
I had my hopes so high  
They fell right down  
  
Im banging my head  
You watch without malice  
You watch with no interest at all  
I bet all your friends  
Compare this to Dallas  
I might as well talk to a brick wall  
  
So under the arm  
I feel the cold shoulder  
So Ill once again  
Have to play the wild rover  
  
Chorus  
  
Do I need all this pressure  
Do I bury my temper  
I had my hopes so high  
They fell right down
