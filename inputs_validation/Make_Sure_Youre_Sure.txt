Well the night is young  
And the stars are out  
And your eyes are all aglow  
And you say you feel  
Ways youve never felt  
But are you sure make sure youre sure  
  
Well the wine is sweet  
And the music sways  
And your lips are so divine  
And you say you know  
That youre falling in love  
Now lets be mature make sure youre sure  
  
Im not accustomed to wearing my feelings  
In a place thats so obvious to see  
But if eyes dont lie  
Theres a chance that you are not fooling yourself  
And me  
  
Well the night is through  
And the suns come out  
And so too has your lovely smile  
And you vow to stay  
In these arms always  
Can you endure now are you sure  
  
Love can be so insecure  
So please be sure
