Here I lay so close to you  
Knowing that youll see me through  
Another night when well feel the joy  
The joy that makes me smile more and more  
  
And every day I dream  
Of holding you close to me  
And every night I find me  
Touching your lips with mine  
Nah ohh oh babe  
  
It seems that time moves much too fast  
Love is here and love will last  
Your bodys warm and sure to please  
Lady of love take all of me  
  
Every day I dream  
Of holding you close to me  
Every night I find me  
Touching your lips with mine  
No ooh  
  
Every day I dream  
Of holding you close to me  
Every night I find me  
Touching your lips with mine  
Oh ooh aah  
  
And through the night the touch of love will be  
Forever strong and forever sweet  
And giving in to passions flow  
Creates a world we want to grow  
  
Every day I dream  
Of holding you close to me  
Every night I find me  
Touching your lips with mine  
  
Every day hey hey ooh every night  
Every day hey hey whoa every every night  
Every day hey hey  
Naa ooh every every night  
  
Every day I dream oh I dream  
Naa ooh each and every night  
Youre moving me soothing me girl  
Loving touching feeling ohh  
And Im feeling good ohh feels good
