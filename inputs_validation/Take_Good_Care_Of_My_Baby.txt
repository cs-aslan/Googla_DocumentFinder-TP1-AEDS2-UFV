Take good care of my baby  
Please dont ever make her blue  
Just tell her that you love her  
Make sure youre thinking of her  
In everything you say and do  
  
Take good care of my baby  
Dont you ever make her cry  
Just let your love surround her  
Paint rainbows all around her  
Dont let her see a cloudy sky  
  
Once upon a time  
That little girl was mine  
If I had been true  
I know shed never be with you  
  
So take good care of my baby  
Be just as kind as you can be  
And if you should discover  
That you dont really love her  
Just send my baby back home to me  
  
Take good care of my baby  
Be just as kind as you can be  
And if you should discover  
That you dont really love her  
Send my baby oh send my baby  
Just send my baby home to me
