Those magic men the Magi some people call them wise or Oriental even kings  
Well anyway those guys they visited with Jesus they sure enjoyed their
stay  
Then warned in a dream of King Herods scheme they went home by another way  
Yes they went home by another way home by another way  
Maybe me and you can be wise guys too and go home by another way  
We can make it another way safe home as they used to say  
Keep a weather eye to the chart on high and go home another way  
  
Steer clear of royal welcomes avoid a big todo  
A king who would slaughter the innocents will not cut a deal for you  
He really really wants those presents hell comb your camels fur  
Until his boys announce theyve found trace amounts of your frankincense gold
and myrrh  
Time to go home by another way home by another way  
You have to figure the Gods saying play the odds and go home by another way  
We can make it another way safe home as they used to say  
Keep a weather eye to the chart on high and go home another way  
  
Home is where they want you now  
You can more or less assume that youll be welcome in the end  
Mustnt let King Herod haunt you so or fantasize his features when youre
looking at a friend  
Well it pleasures me to be here and to sing this song tonight  
They tell me that life is a miracle and I figured that theyre right  
But Herods always out there hes got our cards on file  
Its a lead pipe cinch if we give an inch old Herod likes to take a mile  
Its best to go home by another way home by another way  
We got this far to a lucky star but tomorrow is another day  
We can make it another way safe home as they used to say  
Keep a weather eye to the chart on high and go home another way
