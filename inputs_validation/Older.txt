I should have known  
It seemed too easy  
You were there  
And I was breathing blue  
  
Strange  
Dont you think Im looking older  
But something good has happened to me  
Change is a stranger  
You have yet to know  
  
Well youre out of time  
Im letting go  
Youll be fine  
Well that much I know  
Youre out of time  
Im letting go  
Im not the man you want  
  
I should have known  
It seemed so easy  
You were there  
I thought I needed you  
  
Strange  
Dont you think Im looking older  
But something good has happened to me  
Change is a strange  
Who never seems to show  
  
Well youre out of time  
Im letting go  
Youll be fine  
or maybe you wont  
Youre out of time  
Im letting go  
  
Im not the man that you want  
  
I never should have looked back in your direction  
I know that  
Just the same old fights again baby  
These are wasted days without affection  
Im not that foolish anymore
