Its Bad Boy bitch  
Scram Jones the Clipse BIG  
Lets go  
  
Niggas in my faction dont like asking questions  
Strictly gun testing coke measuring  
Giving pleasure in the Benzito  
Hitting fanny spendin chips at Mannys  
Hope you creeps got receipts my peeps get dirty like cleats  
Run up in your crib wrap you up in your Polo sheets  
Six up in your wig piece nigga decease  
Muah may you rest in peace  
With my Sycamore style more sicker than yours  
Fourfour and fiftyfour draw  
As my pilot steers my Leer  
Yes my dear shits official only the Feds I fear  
Heres a tissue stop your blood clot crying  
The kids the dog everybody dyin no lying  
So dont you get suspicious  
Im Big dangerous youre just a Likkle Vicious  
As I leave my competition respirator style  
Climb the ladder to success escalator style  
Hold yall breath I told yall death controls yall  
Big dont fold yall big dont fold yall  
I spit phrases thatll thrill you thrill you  
Youre nobody till somebody kills you I dont wanna die  
  
Chorus  
Do you know where your going too  
Just a memoryeverybody dying  
When I throw my clip in the AK  
May you rest in peace  
Your nobody till somebody kills you  
Do you know where your goin too  
Just a memoryso you better pack a pistol  
Everybody dying death controls yall  
Your nobody till somebody kills you  
  
Label limbo I treat it like the wind blows  
My back dont bend see papi is my kinfolk  
Spin out the work as if its on a ten spoke  
Soul benefactor the Benz he made the rims poke  
Trust me they cant touch P in one touchie  
Turn drophead coupe to dunebuggy  
Admire the verses their inspired by the hearses  
That carried my niggas and had the church mothers cursing  
Imagine the glamor that comes out the flow  
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa  
The wrist is rushing my ears is blushing  
And the diamonds in my chain big as grandmas buttons yes  
On the flip side the steel Im gripping  
You thought all the floss had me slipping  
Think again blink again let me know that your bluffing  
Lead give permanent concussion your nothing  
  
Chorus  
  
Ha ha ha ha ha check out the fisad  
On the face of rap so we gon raise the bar  
A mil on the crib mean a quarter on the car  
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage  
Even as a youth I was laundering the stoop  
Underneath the nose and the Feds had no clue  
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof  
Rich black two big guns and no coof  
Things at the label well they tend to get unstable  
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table  
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle  
Because Im a provider as long as I am able  
This here hughe the most foolish of blues  
When I tell my mom the price  
She damn near sent me to my room  
Its the MALICIOUS  
You dont wanna try nigga you next uh  
  
Chorus  
  
Biggie Duets  
Born Again  
Life After Death  
Legacy lives onand on and on  
These motherfuckers still cant see you BIG  
shit you aint even here  
Motherfuckers better step their game up  
Greatest of all time Greatest of all time  
Motherfuckers
