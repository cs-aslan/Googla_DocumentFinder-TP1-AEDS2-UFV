I love you once  
Rock you twice  
My loves a gun that wants to talk tonight  
I kiss the lust  
Right from your lips  
The way it feels will hit you like a blitz  
  
Day after day  
Day after day I rock the speed  
Night after night  
Night after night  
  
Love on the run  
Always loaded like a gun  
For love  
  
Turn outside in  
And inside out  
With me youll find the kicks youve never found  
I kiss the pearl  
Right from the shell  
Until Youll feel what all these words cant tell  
Day after day  
Day after day Im burning free  
Night after night  
Night after night  
  
Love on the run  
Always loaded like a gun  
For love on the run
