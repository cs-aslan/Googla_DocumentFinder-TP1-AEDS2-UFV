One of the black boys said  
I need none of your pity  
Its your mama that dont  
Like you loose in the city  
  
But stick about take note  
Take a tip take no back lip  
Come come a little closer  
Let me see you snap your fingertip  
  
Because standing on the corner  
Just might suit you or maybe baby  
Theres something else you wanna do  
  
Like rolling dice nice  
Like shooting pool hey thats cool  
  
Im a little black boy and I dont know my place  
Im just a little black boy I just threw my ace  
Im a little black boy recognize my face  
  
One of the black boys said  
Im a giving a warning  
People been putting me down  
Im so tired Im yawning  
  
A new suit pretty boots to boot  
And Im feeling slick  
Gonna go to town look around  
And pull a chick  
  
Of course standing on the corner  
Might suit you or maybe baby  
Theres something else that you wanna do  
  
Like playing poker joker  
Like to back a race ace  
  
Im a little black boy and I dont know my proper place  
Im a little black boy get my head in its space  
Im a little black boy I just play my bass  
Im a little black boy its no disgrace
