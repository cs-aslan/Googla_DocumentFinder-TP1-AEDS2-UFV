Woke up this morning  
With a funny funny feelin  
And that feelin  
Was an unusual feelin  
Inna my bone yeah  
It inna my blood  
Inna my toes  
Coming up to my brain  
Went to the doctor  
To check out whats matter  
I Went to the doctor  
To find out the matter  
Doctor said son  
You have a Reggaemylitis  
I saidWhat  
Doctor said son  
You have a Reggaemylitis  
Is it contagious  
Is it outrageous  
Is it vicious  
Or is it dangerous  
Inna mi bones  
Inna me blood  
From my toes  
Up to my brain  
I can feel it inna my bones  
Inna my ankle  
From my toes  
Up to my brain  
Is it incurable  
Its fit for desirable  
It isnt curable  
Fit for desirable  
I have it inna my toes  
Inna my ankles  
Inna my knees  
Up to my waist  
Under mi ribs  
Across mi shoulder  
Inna mi finger  
Up to my brain  
Reggaemylitis I say  
You only catch it one way  
Its reggaemylitis I say  
Sometimes your temperature  
It really gets higher  
And the music  
Sets your soul on fire  
Got it inna my toes  
Inna my knees  
Inna my ankles  
Inna my waist  
Inna my heart  
Inna my soul  
Inna my mind  
Come through my mouth  
Inna my finger  
Registered in my brain
