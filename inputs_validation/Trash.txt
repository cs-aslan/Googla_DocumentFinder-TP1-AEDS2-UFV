Dont ya wanna come to my motel honey  
Dont ya wanna hold me down tell me that you love me  
Dont ya know that I have really never loved nobody but you X2  
Ill do my hair up all high and wild wild flowers tied  
Green swimming pool pink flamingos high christmas lights  
Blue bedspread and silver tinsel my hearts delight  
Dont ya wanna come to my motel honey  
Dont ya wanna hold me down tell me that you love me  
Dont ya know that I have really never loved nobody but you X2  
Do you like my fake nails daddy  
Black palmtree pink tigerstripes  
Used to go to the kamfreena  
Will you buy me a slice of cherry pie  
We didnt know much just worked at night  
Sweet trailer light

Dont ya know that I have really never loved nobody but you  
Dont ya wanna come to my motel honey  
Dont ya wanna hold me down tell me that you love me  
Dont ya know that I have really never loved nobody but you  
He said LanaRay will you serve me lemonade  
And I said yes Bill I will its the day of the parade  
  
And you look even more handsome than you did  
The day that I left you  
How do you spend your nights honey  
Still watchin tv I long to be in your arms honey  
Come back to me

Dont ya wanna hold me down tell me that you love me  
Dont ya know that I have really never loved nobody but you  
Dont ya wanna come to my motel honey

Dont ya wanna hold me down tell me that you love me  
Dont ya know that I have really never loved nobody but you  
Dont ya wanna come to my motel honey
