I thought I felt you touch my cheek this mornin  
But I musta been dreamin  
And in the middle of the night with out a warnin  
I thought I heard you breathin  
Me and my socalled independence  
Ive got this loneliness thats so relentless  
  
Chorus  
I guess you get used to somebody  
Kind of like havin them around  
I guess you get used to the way they make you happy  
Bring you up when youre feelin down  
I never dreamed when I was letting you go  
That I would wake up and miss you this much  
I guess you get used to somebody  
I guess you get used to bein loved  
  
I kinda miss those ramblin conversations  
Where we talked about nothin  
The way you always made me laugh at my frustrations  
Baby that was somethin  
I shouldve been careful what I wished for  
Cause Ive got my freedom and so much more  
  
Chorus  
  
I never dreamed when I was letting you go  
That I would wake up and miss you this much  
I guess you get used to somebody  
I guess you get used to bein loved
