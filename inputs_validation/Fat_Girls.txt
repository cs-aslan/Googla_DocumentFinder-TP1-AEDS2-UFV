Harry Take the garbage out  
Yes poopsie  
  
Fat girls  
Ooo can be so much fun  
Their mouths are motors  
What a girl  
So let their motors run  
  
After they have eaten you  
Out of house and home  
Strip down to your birthday suit  
And let them halves explode  
  
Cant to back in their cake too much  
With only goes out for an occasional where to put  
Cant to back in their cake too much  
Ooo theyre never gonna stop  
  
What a girl  
Fat girls

What a girl Woo  
Fat girls can be so much fun  
  
When youre done and satisfied  
You must throw them out  
Never have to say for sure  
Gross them out  
  
Feeding my special ladies  
Have but one thing to gain  
They want to have your babies  
They want you ball and chain  
  
They clean to back and they clean too much  
With only goes out for an occasional where to put   
They clean to back and they clean too much  
Ooo theyre never gonna stop  
  
What a girl  
Fat girls

What a girl Woo  
Fat girls Oooouhhh
