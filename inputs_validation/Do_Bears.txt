Rowan Atkinson  
For years I thought  
Id have to live alone  
I never got a letter  
Had to disconnect the phone  
The only girls I ever saw  
Were on tv  
But now Ive got a Venus  
Whos sitting next to me  
Both  
Do I love you  
Do I want you  
Would I give my life  
To you if I could  
Do birds fly  
Do fish swim  
And do bears shalalalala  
In the woods  
Rowan  
I met her in the first class lounge  
Of a jumbo jet  
It was love at first sight  
Romeo and Juliet  
Kate  
He looked pretty rich  
And I was down on m luck  
So I charged him a fortune  
For a flying f  
Rowan  
 For crying out loud  
Both  
Do I love you  
Do I want you  
Would I sacrifice my life  
To you if I could  
Is the Pope Catholic  
Is Luxembourg small  
And do those hairy bears shhh  
In the woods  
Rowan  
I introduced her round my friends  
She was ace  
I was no longer on Earth  
But in better place  
Kate  
Hes an utter creep and he  
Drives me round the bend  
And so to alleviate the boredom  
I sleep with his friends  
Rowan  
Ho ha ho  
Both  
Do I love you  
Do I want you  
Kate  
Would I tear out both my eyes  
And fry them if I could  
Both  
Is the Bible fiction  
Is True Love a contradiction  
And do bears shalalalala  
In the woods  
Do I desire you  
Do I adore you  
Rowan  
Would I cut off all my toenails  
And put them in an envelope with my feet  
Both  
Is Reagan Godhead  
Is Chairman Mao dead  
And do those bears shalalalala  
Rowan really Tim BrookeTaylor  
Lalalalalalalaah  
Kate  
Mmmmm  
Rowan Tim  
And do those bears shalalalala  
Lalalalalalalaah  
Kate  
Ahoo Ahoo  
Yeahyeyeah Yeahyeyeah  
Both  
Do those bears shalalalaah  
Rowan  
On Main Street  
Kate  
Oh Yeah Yeahyeyeah
