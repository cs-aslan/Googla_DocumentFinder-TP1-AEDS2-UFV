One heart one voice living out love in this world of noise  
My dream and my joy giving you all I have made a choice  
Desperately Im waiting to answer to your calling  
I will be a candle in the darkness  
I will be the hand of heaven above  
I will be a mirror that reflects your endless love  
I will be the hope among the hopeless  
Where there is conflict I will be peace  
Only by the power of your spirit thats living in me I will be  
Your heart your plan give me your eyes help me understand  
My feet my hands holding out living hope to every man  
Knowing what youve made me with every single heartbeat  
Gracious gentle and kind  
Knowing that your love will shine through mine  
Gracious gentle and kind  
Knowing that your love will shine through mine  
Unverified  
This little light of mine Im gonna let it shine  
This little light of mine yeah
