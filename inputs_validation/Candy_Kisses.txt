My old lady shes so sweet and fine  
I cant help it wanting her kisses all the time  
I run to meet her like kid with a dollar to the corner candy store  
Its what Im living for but I want more than your candy kisses  
  
She starts moving I say honey please  
I aint foolin you know it isnt right to tease  
I tell her sugar youre a true fine lover youre sweet as cherry pie  
But no matter how I try I cant get by on your candy kisses  
  
I dont want our love to stop  
If it should stop my heart would break  
If the sun should get too hot  
Its gonna melt the icing on our cake  
  
Candy kisses knock me off my feet  
Fill me up but leave me feeling incomplete  
Fancy wrappin and well made trappins will lead me to your door  
But what Im hungry for is so much more  
Than your candy kisses
