Well hello lonely woman  
Wont you take a walk with me  
I know a place where we can go  
Grab a bite to eat  
Hello lonely woman  
Are you feelin all right  
Well you look just like heaven  
On a clear clear night  
Well I know youre a lonely woman  
And I know whats on your mind  
I wont ask you any favors  
Im familiar with your kind  
I know you need me  
Like a river needs rain  
I wont ask you any favors  
Until I pass this way again
