Take me back to the rivers of belief  
Take me back to the rivers of belief  
my friend  
  
I look inside my heart  
I look inside my soul  
I promise you  
I will return  
  
And when the Lamb opened the seventh seal  
silence covered the sky  
  
Take me back to the rivers of belief  
Take me back to the rivers of belief  
my friend  
  
I look inside my heart  
I look inside my soul  
Im reaching out for you  
Lets hope one day  
Well rest in peace  
on my rivers of belief
