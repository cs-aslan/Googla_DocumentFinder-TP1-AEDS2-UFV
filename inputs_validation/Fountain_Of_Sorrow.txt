Looking through some photographs I found inside a drawer  
I was taken by a photograph of you  
There were one or two I know that you would have liked a little more  
But they didnt show your spirit quite as true  
  
You were turning round to see who was behind you  
And I took your childish laughter by surprise  
And at the moment that my camera happened to find you  
There was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes  
  
Now the things that I remember seem so distant and so small  
Though it hasnt really been that long a time  
What I was seeing wasnt what was happening at all  
Although for a while our path did seem to climb  
When you see through loves illusions there lies the danger  
And your perfect lover just looks like a perfect fool  
So you go running off in search of a perfect stranger  
While the loneliness seems to spring from your life  
Like a fountain from a pool  
  
Fountain of sorrow fountain of light  
Youve known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight  
Youve had to hide sometimes but now youre all right  
And its good to see your smiling face tonight  
  
Now for you and me it may not be that hard to reach our dreams  
But that magic feeling never seems to last  
And while the futures there for anyone to change still you know it seems  
It would be easier sometimes to change the past  
Im just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you  
In my lessons at loves pain and heartache school  
Where if you feel too free and you need something to remind you  
Theres this loneliness springing up from your life  
Like a fountain from a pool  
  
Fountain of sorrow fountain of light  
Youve known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight  
  
Youve had to hide sometimes but now youre all right  
And its good to see your smiling face tonight  
  
Fountain of sorrow fountain of light  
Youve known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight  
Youve had to struggle youve had to fight  
To keep understanding and compassion in sight  
You could be laughing at me youve got the right  
But you go on smiling so clear and so bright
