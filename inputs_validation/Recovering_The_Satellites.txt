Gonna get back to basics  
Guess Ill start it up again  
Im fallin from the ceiling  
Youre falling from the sky now and then  
  
Maybe you were shot down in pieces  
Maybe I slipped in between  
But we were gonna be the wildest people they ever hoped to see  
Just you and me  
  
So whyd you come home to this sleepless town  
Its a lifetime commitment  
Recovering the satellites  
All anybody really wants to know is  
When you gonna come down  
  
Your mother recognizes all youre desperate displays  
And she watches as her babies drift violently away  
Til they see themselves in telescopes  
Do you see yourself in me  
Were such crazy babies little monkey  
Were so fucked up you and me  
  
So whyd you come home to this faithless town  
Where we make a lifetime commitment  
To recovering the satellites  
And all anybody really wants to know is  
When are you gonna come down  
  
She sees shooting stars and comet tails  
Shes got heaven in her eyes  
She says I dont need to be an angel  
But Im nothing if Im not this high  
  
But we only stay in orbit  
For a moment of time  
And then youre everybodys satellite  
I wish that you were mine  
  
So whyd you come home to this angel town  
Its a lifetime decision  
Recovering the satellites  
Everybody really knows for sure  
That youre gonna come down  
That youre gonna come down
