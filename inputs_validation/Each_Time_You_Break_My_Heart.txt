Each time you break my heart  
Each time you break my heart  
  
I know how it feels to be the talk of the town  
Im not gonna let you go and run around  
I need to know that youll be true to me  
Cause thats the way its got to be  
  
Why cant you give your promise to me  
Is love so blind that you cannot see  
Im trying hard not to walk out the door  
Know that I oh know that I cant take no more  
  
Chorus  
  
Each time you break my heart  
I try to put my pride aside  
Each time you break my heart  
A little voice inside me cries  
  
No matter what you do or say  
Im gonna love you Im gonna love you anyway  
And if youre so sure that Im not your kind  
How come you cant just walk away  
  
In the beginning we were nothing but glad  
Those were the best days that we ever had  
Theres no compassion all your warmth is gone  
Tell me how oh how can I keep holding on  
  
Chorus  
  
Intermediate  
  
I see the look in your eyes  
I know youre hurting inside  
Let me try  
To make you love me again  
Ill say that I knew you when  
You were mine  
You were mine  
  
Each time oh yeah  
  
In the beginning we were nothing but glad  
Those were the best days that we ever had  
Theres no compassion all your warmth is gone  
Tell me how oh how can I keep holding on  
  
intermediate  
  
Chorus  
  
Each time you break my heart again  
Well I can say I knew you when each time  
You were mine  
  
Break my heart  
Dont break my heart  
repeat and fade
