I am a problem child  
Ive been wild all my days  
All my anger and my rage  
My senses said it would lead me astray  
I said go go go  
  
Raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Dont take a seat  
Dont stand aside this time  
Dont assume anything  
But go go go  
  
Five generations running fast  
These things will not pass  
This debtors blood runs in my veins  
I cant change anything  
I said no no no  
  
Raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Dont take a seat  
Dont stand aside this time  
Dont assume anything  
But go go go  
  
So youve learned to cry  
But you dont know why  
So youve learned to laugh  
What are we laughing at  
  
So I am a problem child  
Ive been wild all my days  
All my anger and my rage  
My senses said it would lead me astray  
And I said go go go  
Go go  
  
Raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Dont take a seat  
Dont stand aside this time  
Dont assume anything this time  
Dont assume anything  
I said go go go
