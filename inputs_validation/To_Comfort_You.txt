Youve been down in the dumps  
It seems like forever  
Now what have they done to you  
Not a single things turned out  
The way you imagined  
It all looks unreachable to you  
  
You dont know for the life of you  
What is missing  
Or why it always happens to you  
And you dont like yourself  
You feel nobodys listening  
You dont need another platitude  
  
For a moment you forget  
And a smile comes to your face  
Aah but it doesnt last too long  
Its like a string you got tied  
Around your finger  
Reminding you of  
Everything thats wrong  
  
I wont try to say I know what youre feeling  
I wont try to second guess you  
I wont try to give advice you wont be needing  
Im only here to comfort you  
Im only here to comfort you  
  
And Id love to be the reason  
A smile comes to your face  
Even if it doesnt last too long  
And Id love to take that string  
Youve got tied around your finger  
Reminding you of everything thats wrong  
  
I wont try to say I know what youre feeling  
I wont try to second guess you  
I wont try to give advice you wont be needing  
Im only here to comfort you  
Im only here to comfort you  
Im only here to comfort you
