Intro  
Oh x4  
  
Verse 1  
When I was just a little boy  
Barely strong enough to stand  
I could always count on him  
Oh  
  
He thought me everything I know  
And till this day it shows  
  
He was more than just a friend Ah ah ah  
  
PreChorus  
There were so many times I would doubt myself  
But his words were always there to help  
  
Chorus  
How would it be  
Where I am  
If my father didnt tell me  
To never say I cant  
  
Hed carry me  
And never let me fall  
Oh and the only thing he asked  
Right before he passed  
Was to never say you cant  
  
Oh  
Never say you cant  
Oh oh oh Oh  
  
Verse 2  
So when last rain begins to fall  
And youre out there on your own  
And you cant see a thing  
No no no  
  
Just find a voice that understands  
For me it was my old man  
Taught me to say the words I can  
Oh  
  
Prechorus  
There were so many times I would doubt myself  
But his words were always there to help  
  
Chorus  
How would it be  
Where I am  
If my father didnt tell me  
To never say I cant  
  
Hed carry me  
And never let me fall  
Oh and the only thing he asked  
Right before he passed  
Was to never say you cant  
  
Bridge  
Everything he taught me would stay with me forever  
No I wont forget a thing  
Oh because of dad I now know myself better  
And I hope I can do for him what he did for me  
  
Chorus  
How would it be  
Where I am  
If my father didnt tell me  
To never say I cant  
  
Hed carry me  
And never let me fall  
Oh and the only thing he asked  
Right before he passed  
Was to never say you cant  
  
Oh  
Never say you cant  
Oh  
Never say you cant
