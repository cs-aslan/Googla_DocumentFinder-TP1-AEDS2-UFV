Whoo hoo yeah  
Whoo hoo yeah  
  
Shell adore you and shell floor you  
With her wisdom and her vision  
And youll love it and think of it  
Till you lose all intuition  
Come on  
  
She can move you and improve you  
With her love and her devotion  
And shell thrill you and shell chill you  
But youre headed for commotion  
  
And youll need her so youll feed her  
With your endless dedication  
And the quicker you get sicker  
Shell remove your medication  
  
Get the firehouse  
Cause she sets my soul afire  
Get the firehouse  
And the flames keep gettin higher  
  
Shes like bad weather but it seems so good  
Youd never leave her but you know you should  
  
Shes like bad weather but it seems so good  
Youd never leave her but you know you should  
  
Ooh  
Get the firehouse  
Cause she sets my soul afire  
Get the firehouse  
Whoo hoo yeah  
Get the firehouse  
Whoo hoo yeah
