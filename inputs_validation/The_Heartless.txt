Your pain aint love  
Cant you see hes the heartless  
Your pain is not love  
Hes taking it too far  
Dont you know it is wrong  
  
Youre the one for me lady  
Youre the one  
If youd only see in my heart  
Youd know know all is not lost  
  
Your time is running out  
And you still havent made up your mind  
Cant you see hes the heartless  
And youre one of a kind  
  
Hes the heartless  
You cant you see hes the heartless  
Your pain wont ever be love  
It doesnt matter how hard you try  
To you all is lost  
  
Hes the heartless
