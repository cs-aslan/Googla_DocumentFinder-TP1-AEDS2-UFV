You say its time to leave now babe I cant believe  
That you have the strength to go now  
I wont stand in your way Id be standing there all day  
Aint that something we both know now  
You play your games but the fact remains  
Im the only one that can hold your reins  
  
Didnt I bring your love down  
Didnt I bring your love down all night  
  
If you think you need a change well Im sure we can arrange  
For you to get on your own for a while  
But I dont need to worry cause youll get back in a hurry  
I know that you like my style  
You play your games but the fact remains  
Im the only one that can hold your reins  
  
Didnt I bring your love down  
Didnt I bring your love down all night
