You dont know me but Im your brother  
I was raised here in this living Hell  
You dont know my kind in your world  
Fairly soon the time will tell  
You telling me the things youre gonna do for me  
I aint blind and I dont like what I think I see  
Takin it to the streets  
Takin it to the streets  
Takin it to the streets  
Take this message to my brother  
You will find him everywhere  
Wherever people live together  
Tied in povertys despair  
You telling me the things youre gonna do for me  
I aint blind and I dont like what I think I see  
Takin it to the streets  
Takin it to the streets  
Takin it to the streets  
Takin it to the streets

Takin it to the streets  
Takin it to the streets

You telling me the things youre gonna do for me
