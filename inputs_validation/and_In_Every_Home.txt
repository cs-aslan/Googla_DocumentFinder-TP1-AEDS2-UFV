You turn to the sinister when you get the boot  
Sliding down the banister in your Sunday suit  
Lying on a slag heap of blankets and magazines  
Shes only thirtyfive going on seventeen  
Youd better roll over and go to sleep if you dont come clean  
  
Chorus  
And in every home there will be lots of time  
I will be all yours you might have been admired  
And in every home there will be lots of time  
They say theyre very sorry but you are not desired  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Because they dont deserve us  
  
Holding your life in your hand  
With an artificial limp wrist  
And so a young blade becomes a hasbeen  
Looking for a new twist  
  
A year after the wedding he broke all their china plates  
Hes in prison now shes running with his mates  
Sees him every Sunday  
And he asks her where shes been  
Shes only thirtyfive going on seventeen  
Shes going to cop a packet if he ever finds her  
In between the sheets  
  
Chorus
