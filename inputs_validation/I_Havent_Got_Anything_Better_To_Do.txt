I never loved him he never reached me  
He was just someone someone I knew  
I think about him on alternate Thursdays  
When I havent got anything better to do  
  
Hes got a problem if he thinks I need him  
I couldnt care less now that were through  
I only sit home and I wait for his phone call  
When I havent got anything better to do  
  
Wasnt I awfully smart not to fall and break my heart  
He never meant a thing to me hes gone  
Im glad Im free  
And when he kissed me no no he never moved me  
Nothing fantastic thrilling or new  
So if Im crying Im only crying  
Cause I havent got anything better  
No I havent got anything better  
I havent got anything better to do without you  
I never loved him no he never moved me  
Nothing fantastic
