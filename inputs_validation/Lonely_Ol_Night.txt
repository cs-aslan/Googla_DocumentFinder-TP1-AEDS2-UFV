She calls me up  
And says baby its a lonely ol night  
I dont know  
Im just so scared and lonely all at the same time  
Nobody told us  
It was gonna work out this way no no no no no no  
I guess they knew  
Wed work it out in our own way  
  
Chorus  
Its a lonely ol night  
Can I put my arms around you  
Its a lonely ol nigh  
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you  
  
Radio playin softly  
Some singers sad sad song  
Hes singing about  
Standing in the shadows of love  
I guess it feels awfully alone  
She says I know exactly what he means  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
And its a sad sad sad sad feeling  
When youre living on those in betweens  
But its ok  
  
Chorus  
Its a lonely ol night  
Can I put my arms around you  
Its a lonely ol nigh  
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you  
  
She calls me baby  
She calls everybody baby  
Its a lonely ol night  
But aint they all  
  
Chorus  
Its a lonely ol night  
Can I put my arms around you  
Its a lonely ol nigh  
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you  
  
Girl like me and you  
Yeah like me and you
