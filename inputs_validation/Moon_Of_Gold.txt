Moon of gold in the sky  
My loving sweetheart said goodbye  
Those moonlight kisses that she shared with me  
Are just a memory  
  
By the light of your glow  
Those tender love words whispered low  
Were just a promise that never came true  
For she found someone new  
  
How how was I to know shed soon go  
And leave me longing in the moon glow  
  
Since shes gone Im alone  
I have no sweetheart of my own  
Just a memory of a love thats grown cold  
And a tarnished moon of gold  
  
Since shes gone Im alone  
I have no sweetheart of my own  
Just a memory of a love thats grown cold  
And a tarnished moon of gold
