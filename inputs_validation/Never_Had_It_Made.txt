First I was born young and healthy  
I told my mother one day Id be wealthy  
Cant forget my first day at school  
Got stabbed in the head with a pencil but its cool  
Get my education  
A job and a family a good reputation  
And what about grade two  
Got shot in the neck and the bullet went straight through  
But Im packing a textbook  
Dont fuck with me cause Im going to grade three  
Thank god its lunch in a minute  
Bit into my hot dog with a razor blade in it  
And it cut my tongue off  
But I know how to multiply so whats up boss  
Finally had to step out  
I dropped out of school when they ripped my neck out  
Who knows where the road led  
Seen a man with a briefcase and no head  
So Im like fuck that  
Show me a quarter and an ounce of crack  
And Im straighter than a fucking lightpost  
I sold a lot of crack but I bought the most  
Now Im a basehead down on my luck  
Roaming the streets and got hit by a Mack Truck  
And thrown about a block  
But Im thinking nothing but gimme a rock  
Holding my sign Ill work for crack  
With my oldass ET shirt on my back  
And Im sleeping in the gutter  
Right next to Jam Towns mother  
Im eating dead rats in the street  
I keep on checking for my ownheart beat  
Now Im weighing at a buckofive  
Twitchy little neck and Im barely alive  
Got my first taste of life in hell  
I ate a dead shh but dont tell  
Excuse me sir can you spare some change  
Ill cut your face off and eat your brains  
You know all about me  
You act like you aint seen penatentiary  
Spitting and cussing and you know Ill piss  
With these iron braces on my fucking wrists  
And Im heading for the slammer  
Serial killer all on the camera  
First day they broke my back  
Next day they broke my neck  
Third day they broke my leg  
Fourth day they broke my head  
Swallowing kept on trucking  
But therell be no fucking  
Thats strictly for the soft  
Seen a freak in a week and my nuts fell off  
So Im finna escape  
How much shit can one clubno take  
Stop fool Stop or Ill fire  
Shot me off and I fell in the razor wire  
Im all tangled up cut cut cut slit slit cut cut  
You dont love me I really dont care  
Tie my ass up in the electric chair  
I got no family I got no friends  
I pray to God that my life ends  
They thought that they had killed me  
They took me to the morgue  
Im just a little stiff thats all like a board  
I lay there in my coffin just chill and wait and chill  
But then I jump out knife swinging all about  
And motherfuckingmothermothermothermotherfucking kill  
I used to wonder what lifes about  
Until it chewed me up and spit me out  
Your ghetto created a psycho nut  
Not just psycho psycho nut  
Now Im living in the walls of your house  
And Ill die there and lay and rot like a dead mouse  
Im packing a sickle Im on your roof and Im playing the fiddle  
You want me in a straight jacket  
cause when I see a throat Im a hack it  
Where Im at Whats my name  
Somehow somewhere I got hit by a train  
And it ripped my legs off  
Huh nothing but a minor coft  
You cant get me I swing from a tree  
Shouting and cussing and shooting at me  
Everybodys end make two cents  
A branch broke and I fell on a picket fence  
Im stuck and theyre coming to get me  
Rip myself off and I took my lungs with me  
Im stuffing them back in  
Fuck They wont go back in  
Now my lifes gettin dense  
cause my hearts still beating on a wooden fence  
They shoot me up and down  
Thinking thinking thinking clown  
Wicked wicked wicked clown  
You want to know all about a wicked clown I never had it made
