Take the worst of this quirky world  
Roll it up in a ball  
Add the hair of a gogo girl  
Turn it into a dance thats called  
The bloody  
Brain Tap Shuffle  
Lose your mind  
Youll see the oceans part  
youll think your goin blind  
You can talk about your daily grind  
While shell dish out the soft shoe  
If makin money doesnt suit your mind  
Weve got something here  
Here for you  
You can sit there and suck your thumb  
Hear the rock and roll hum  
But youre just a crazy wall flower  
Til you join all your friends on the floor  
And do the  
Brain Tap Shuffle  
Lose your mind  
Youll see the oceans part  
youll think your goin blind  
Take your clothes off and start to shake  
Shake rattle and roll  
Watch the walls and the ceiling quake  
Let it move your body and soul  
And do the  
Brain Tap Shuffle  
Lose your mind  
Youll see the oceans part  
youll think your goin blind
