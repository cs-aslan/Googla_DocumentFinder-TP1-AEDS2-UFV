Girl I know the grass is greener just around the bend  
Gotta say goodbye but dont you fear  
Though the road is broken I might fail to find the end  
I wont disappear  
Ill be back up on my feet  
Ill be back up on my feet  
Chase the moon and sun to find my one and only you  
Ill be back up on my feet  
Ill be back up on my feet  
Looking high Im looking low  
When I find my boots I know I got to go  
Back up on my feetah ah  
Maybe I will be a star or maybe just a clown  
Girl Ill never know until I try  
Maybe I will meet a girl wholl try to keep me down  
But you wont have to cry  
Ill be back up on my feet  
Ill be back up on my feet  
Chase the moon and sun to find my one and only you  
Ill be back up on my feet  
Ill be back up on my feet  
Looking high Im looking low  
When I find my boots I know I got to go  
Back up on my feet ah ah  
  
Maybe I will meet a girl wholl try to keep me down  
But you wont have to cry  
Ill be back up on my feet  
Ill be back up on my feet  
Chase the moon and sun to find my one and only you  
Ill be back up on my feet  
Ill be back up on my feet  
Looking high Im looking low  
When I find my boots I know I got to go  
When I find my boots I know I got to go  
When I find my boots I know I got to go
