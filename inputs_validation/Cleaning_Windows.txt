Oh the smell of the bakery from across the street  
Got in my nose  
As we carried our ladders down the street  
With the wroughtiron gate rows  
I went home and listened to Jimmie Rodgers in my lunchbreak  
Bought five Woodbines at the shop on the corner  
And went straight back to work  
  
Oh Sam was up on top  
And I was on the bottom with the V  
We went for lemonade and Paris buns  
At the shop and broke for tea  
I collected from the lady  
And I cleaned the fanlight insideout  
I was blowing saxophone on the weekend  
In that down joint  
  
Whats my line  
Im happy cleaning windows  
Take my time  
Ill see you when my love grows  
Baby dont let it slide  
Im a working man in my prime  
Cleaning windows number a hundred and thirtysix  
  
I heard Leadbelly and Blind Lemon  
On the street where I was born  
Sonny Terry Brownie McGhee  
Muddy Waters singin Im A Rolling Stone  
I went home and read my Christmas Humphreys book on Zen  
Curiosity killed the cat  
Kerouacs Dharma Bums and On The Road  
  
Whats my line  
Im happy cleaning windows  
Take my time  
Ill see you when my love grows  
Baby dont let it slide  
Im a working man in my prime  
Cleaning windows
