She cant put her finger on a single lipstick stain  
Perfume doesnt linger on a shirt on  
Theres no matchbook in his pocket with a number and name  
So why does she still hurt  
  
Cause a woman knows when theres another woman  
She can feel her all over her man  
A woman knows when theres another woman  
You cant fool her so dont try to think you can  
  
What she dont know wont hurt her  
Thats what he tells himself  
So he hides his cheatin heart inside his chest  
He thinks hes put one over but what he dont know is  
Hes already confessed  
  
Cause a woman knows when theres another woman  
She can feel her all over her man  
A woman knows when theres another woman  
You cant fool her so dont try to think you can  
  
A woman knows when theres another woman  
You cant fool her so dont try to think you can  
You cant fool her so don try to think you can
