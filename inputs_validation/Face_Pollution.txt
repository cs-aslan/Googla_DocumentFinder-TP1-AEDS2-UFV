I can count it on my fingers  
Ive got all my reasons not to feel  
Im numb as rigor mortis  
Scared by monkey faces  
Drowned in shark fins  
  
But I dont feel like feeling  
Feeling like you  
  
Now Im in the mirror  
Now its getting clear  
I fear that Im in you  
Now Im into plastics  
Now Ive made a mask  
It looks like fish heads  
  
But I dont feel like feeling  
Feeling like you  
  
Face pollution Repeat x4
