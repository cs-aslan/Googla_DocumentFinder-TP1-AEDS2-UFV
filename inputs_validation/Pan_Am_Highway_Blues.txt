Ive gotten good at missin her  
I practice all the time  
While I drive the Pan Am highway through  
With that cactus friend of mine  
Its gettin hard to see the white line rollin by  
I cant forget her memory deep inside  
  
I dropped a bundle down in Panama  
But the loss didnt do me no good  
Spendin cash and talkin trash  
Dont do it like it should  
I realized I just couldnt buy her smile  
Ill keep tryin on that Pan Am mile by mile  
  
If shed meet me in San Salvador  
Id buy her a drink or two  
Wed talk about our used to be  
And ride on to Peru  
The time to get it right is here and now  
If she wont Ill move on anyhow
