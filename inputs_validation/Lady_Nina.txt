You pick out your credit cards and check into the night  
A dozen tequilas and youre feeling alright  
So you swim to the disco out of your depth jaded gigolo  
Your lucky charms are tarnished so you leave alone  
But theres one place left to go before the taxi home  
After all you made your marks  
  
One night youll play Elizabeth Taylor  
The next night youre Marilyn Monroe  
Forever kissing frogs that think theyre princes  
Oh Lady Nina where did all the romance go  
  
Your little sister babysits your husband picks you up at six  
The makeup hides the bruises and the tears so they never show  
Cause your beauty is the only thing youve ever owned  
Its the only way youve ever known to make your marks  
You made your marks you made your marks  
We believe its for real  
  
Lady Nina Id love to take you home with me  
But I love my wife and I love my family  
Ive got a good job responsibilities  
And I need to keep respect from society  
I know youll never act with me I know that youre in love with me  
So how do I compare to the sailors of the ships of the night  
Was I all right did you come tonight Lady Nina  
You made your marks you made your marks  
  
Ebony flowers pinned to a velvet cushion in a red light  
And Edith Piaf sings a lullaby for the night  
Just made your marks just made your marks  
Just made your marks just made your marks  
  
You made your marks  
  
Ebony flowers pinned to a velvet cushion in a red light  
And Edith Piaf sings a lullaby for the night  
Just made your marks just made your marks  
You made your marks and you made your marks  
Just made your marks and you made your marks  
Just made your marks
