Hot sun dancin on the river  
Wed sit on the bank and watch the world roll by  
Our feet in the water shed press her lips to mine  
We were so long on love but short on time  
She could be honeymoon sweet and a little wild  
And she was mine for a little while  
  
I laugh every time when I think about us  
We sent the summer out in style  
Shes gone but she left me with a smile  
Cause she was mine for a little while  
  
Wed take a drive and park down next to airport road  
Put the seats back and watch the planes leave town  
She always said nobodys strong enough to tie her down  
But I wasnt lookin for that anyhow  
I knew shed leave but I didnt know when  
It matters but didnt back then  
  
I laugh when I start to think about us  
We sent the summer out in style  
Shes gone but she left me with a smile  
Cause she was mine for a little while  
  
I keep seeing pictures now of me and her  
And those summer nights  
My minds filled with her oh and its alright  
  
I laugh when I start to think about us  
We sent the summer out in style  
Shes gone but she left me with a smile  
Cause she was mine for a little while
