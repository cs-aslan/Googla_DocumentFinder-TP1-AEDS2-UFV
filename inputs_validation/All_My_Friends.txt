Thought I might get a rocket ride  
When I was a child but it was a lie  
That I told myself when I needed something good  
At seventeen had a better dream  
Now Im thirtythree and it isnt me  
But Id think of something better if I could  
  
All my friends and lovers leave me behind  
Im still looking for a girl  
One way or another  
Im just hoping to find a way  
To put my feet out in the world  
  
Caught some grief from a falling leaf  
As she tumbled down to the dirty ground  
Said I should have put her back there if I could  
But everyone needs a better day  
And Im trying to find me a better way  
To get from the things I do to the things I should  
  
All my friends and lovers leave me alone  
To try to have a little fun  
One way or another I just wish I had known  
To go out walking in the sun  
And find out if you were the one  
  
Does it make you wanna come a little closer now  
And did you wanna dance with me  
Did you wanna hum a little harder now  
Can you see her waiting there  
Can you see her Because Im almost there  
Can you see her waiting there for someone like me  
All you want is a beauty queen  
Not a superstar but everybodys dream machine  
All you want is a place to lay your head  
You go to sleep dreaming how you would  
Be a different kind if you thought you could  
But you come awake the way you are instead  
  
All my friends and lovers shine like the sun  
I just turn and walk away  
One way or another  
Im not coming undone  
Im just waiting for the day
