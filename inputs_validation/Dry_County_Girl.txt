A tall drink of water in a cotton dress  
That preachers daughter she sure is blessed  
As sunlight passes through the fabric so soft  
You can imagine what goes through my thoughts  
She says theyll be a time for all of that  
When my dress is white and your suit is black  
  
Chorus  
Theres so many fish in the sea  
And I know its a great big world  
But I couldnt help but fall in love so hard  
For my dry county girl  
For my dry county girl yeah  
  
Its widely known that I have my flaws  
While shes the Joan of Arkansas  
Her lips wont touch the demon wine  
But her eyes are full of pure moonshine  
And I get drunk just holding her hand  
I get high thinking I could be her man  
  
Chorus  
  
For my dry county girl  
Lord I fell so hard  
For my dry county girl  
For my dry county girl yeah  
Yeah talking about my Fade
