Theres a singing waterfall  
In the mountains far away  
Thats where I long to be  
At the close of everyday  
Thats where my sweethearts sleepin  
Down beneath the clay  
I often sit and wonder why  
The Lord took her away  
Wed meet there every evening  
When the sun was sinkin low  
And wed listen to the waters  
As they rippled soft and low  
And since shes gone to Heaven  
I miss her most of all  
Tonight my darlins sleepin  
By the singing waterfall  
Last night as I lay dreamin  
I heard my darlin call  
And then I went to meet her  
By the singing waterfall  
She took me in her arms  
Just like she used to do  
And then I heard her whisper  
Well meet beyond the blue  
Wed meet there every evening  
When the sun was sinkin low  
And wed listen to the waters  
As they rippled soft and low  
And since shes gone to Heaven  
I miss her most of all  
Tonight my darlins sleepin  
By the singing waterfall
