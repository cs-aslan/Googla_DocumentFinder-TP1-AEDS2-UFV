Look out cause theres something wrong  
And you dont know what it is  
Watch out or its Sodom and Gomorrah  
The malevolent order  
Right now before its much too late  
Before its much too late  
A dark light a darkness never ending  
A dark light the devil gets his due  
A dark night is everywhere descending  
A dark light is coming for you  
Now look up well the skies are black  
And theyre getting darker all the time  
Watch out for the things that you believe in  
Youre gonna be attacked  
And you wont know what it is  
Wise up you better watch your step  
You better watch your step  
A dark light a darkness never ending  
A dark light of perversion and hate  
A dark night is everywhere descending  
A dark light theres no time to wait  
Look out for the death of love  
There will be no more love  
Watch out its yourself that you are fooling  
Who do you think youre fooling  
Shout it out its a terrible thing  
Such a terrible thing  
A dark light a darkness never ending  
A dark light the sun is turning cool  
A dark night is everywhere descending  
A dark light is shining at you  
Dark light dark light  
Is shining at you dark light
