Night after night I try to make it all fit together  
Night after night I see you as someone I remember  
You took me by surprise opened up my eyes  
Now we gotta talk this over  
  
Can it really be so serious to be all broken up and delirious  
I guess weve really been out of touch but can it really be so serious  
  
Day after day I know its not the way that you wanted it  
Day after day I try to find the key but it dont fit  
But you know how it is no matter what I did  
We gotta talk it over  
  
Can it really be so serious to be all broken up and delirious  
I guess weve really been out of touch but can it really be so serious  
  
Tonight tonight Im thinking over everything you said to me  
Tonight tonight Im sorry but I just didnt see  
And now its up to you theres nothing else to do  
Weve gotta talk it over  
  
Can it really be so serious to be all broken up and delirious  
I guess weve really been out of touch but can it really be so serious
