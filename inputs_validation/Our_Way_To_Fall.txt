I remember a summers day  
I remember walking up to you  
I remember my face turned red  
And I remember staring at my feet  
I remember before we met  
I remember sitting next to you  
And I remember pretending I wasnt looking  
So well try and try  
Even if it lasts an hour  
With all our might  
Well try and make it ours  
Cause were on our way  
Were on our way to fall in love  
I remember your old guitar  
I remember I Cant Explain  
I remember the way it looked around your neck  
And I remember the day it broke  
I remember song you sang  
I remember the way you looked tonight  
And I remember the way it made me feel  
So we try and try  
Even if it lasts an hour  
With all our might  
Well try and make it ours  
Because were on our way  
Were on our way to fall in love
