When we come to place where the road and the sky collide  
Throw me over the edge and let my spirit glide  
They told me I was going to have to work for a living  
But all I want to do is ride  
I dont care where were going from here  
Honey you decide  
  
Well I spend my time at the bottom of a wishing well  
And I can hear my dreams singing clear as a bell  
I used to know where they ended and the world began  
But now its getting hard to tell  
I could be just around the corner from heaven or a mile from hell  
  
Im just rolling away from yesterday  
Behind a wheel of a stolen Chevrolet  
Im going to get a little higher  
And see if I can hotwire reality  
  
Now can you see those dark clouds gathering up ahead  
Theyre going to wash this planet clean like the bible said  
Now you can hold on steady and try to be ready  
But everybodys gonna get wet  
Dont think it wont happen just because it hasnt happened yet  
  
Im just rolling away from yesterday  
Behind the wheel of a stolen Chevrolet  
Im going to get a little higher  
And see if I can hotwire reality
