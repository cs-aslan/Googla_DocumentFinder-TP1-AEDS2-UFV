Dreaming  
I was only dreaming  
Of another place and time  
Where my familys from  
  
Singing  
I can hear them singing  
When the rain had washed away  
All these scattered dreams  
  
Dying  
Everyones reminding  
Hearts are washed in misery  
Drenched in gasoline  
  
Laughter  
There is no more laughter  
Songs of yesterday  
Now live in the underground  
  
Life before the lobotomy  
Christian sang the eulogy  
Sign my love a lost memory  
From the end of the century  
  
Well its enough to make you sick  
To cast a stone and throw a brick  
When the sky is falling down  
It burned your dreams into the ground  
  
Christians lesson is what hes been sold  
We are normal and selfcontrolled  
Remember to learn to forget  
Whiskey shots and cheap cigarettes  
  
Well Im not stoned  
Im just fucked up  
I got so high I cant stand up  
Im not cursed cause Ive been blessed  
Im not in love cause Im a mess  
  
Like refugees  
Were lost like refugees  
Like refugees  
Were lost like refugees  
The brutality of reality  
Is the freedom that keeps me from  
  
Dreaming  
I was only dreaming  
Of another place and time  
Where my familys from  
  
Singing  
I can hear them singing  
When the rain had washed away  
All these scattered dreams  
  
Dying  
Everyones reminding  
Hearts are washed in misery  
Drenched in gasoline  
  
Laughter  
There is no more laughter  
Songs of yesterday  
Now live in the underground
