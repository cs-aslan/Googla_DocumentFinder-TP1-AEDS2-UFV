Back before I was a movie star  
Straight off of the farm  
I had a picture of another mans wife  
Tattooed on my arm  
  
With a pack of Camel cigarettes  
In the sleeve of my Tee shirt  
Im headin out to Hollywood  
Just to have my feelings hurt  
  
That town will make you crazy  
Just give it a little time  
Youll be walking round in circles  
Down at Hollywood and Vine  
  
Youll be waitin on a phone call  
At the wrong end of a broom  
Yes that townll make you crazy  
Crazy as a loon  
  
So I headed down to Nashville  
To become a country star  
Every night youd find me hangin  
At every honkytonk and bar  
  
Pretty soon I met a woman  
Pretty soon she done me wrong  
Pretty soon my life got sadder  
Than any country song  
  
That town will make you crazy  
Just give it a little time  
Youll be walking round in circles  
Lookin for that country rhyme  
  
Youll be waitin on a phone call  
At the wrong end of a broom  
Yea that townll make you crazy  
Crazy as a loon  
  
So I gathered up my savvy  
Bought myself a business suit  
I headed up to New York City  
Where a man can make some loot  
  
I got hired Monday morning  
Downsized that afternoon  
Overcome with grief that evening  
Now Im crazy as a loon  
  
So Im up here in the North Woods  
Just staring at a lake  
Wondering just exactly how much  
They think a man can take  
  
I eat fish to pass the time away  
Neath this blue Canadian moon  
This old world has made me crazy  
Crazy as a loon  
Lord this world will make you crazy  
Crazy as a loon
