Road narrows pouring down  
Im breaking without a sound  
Bits and pieces of trying  
Get what you pay for nothing  
  
Frozen dreaming of yesterday  
Potent creeping Im far away  
From my hometown I lit out  
To save my skin and shed some doubt  
  
I know how false the floor  
How high the sky  
Been down that road before  
  
Its a lie you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel cut yourself  
Its a lie you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel cut yourself  
  
Hard as truth is been my friend  
Dont need to be invited in  
Ill go round til bested  
Pick up myself and try again  
  
I know how false the floor  
How high the sky  
Been down that road before  
  
Its a lie you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel cut yourself  
Its a lie you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel cut yourself  
  
All comes in time  
Dont fight it dont mind it  
Whatever may come  
  
All comes in time  
Dont fight it dont mind it  
Whatever may come  
  
I know how false the floor  
How high the sky  
Been down that road before  
  
Its a lie you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel cut yourself  
Its a lie you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel cut yourself
