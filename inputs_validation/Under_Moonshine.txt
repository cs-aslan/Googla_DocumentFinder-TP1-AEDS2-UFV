The dawn crept into by room  
And stole my dream  
Now Ill never know  
Just what it means  
Or what could have been  
Yet still I try to lie  
But Im seen  
  
Under moonshine thats where Ive been  
Under moonshine Im clearly seen  
Under moonshine thats where Ive been  
Under moonshine Im clearly seen  
  
Creator of dreams that melt with the sun  
Ill send you the things this man has done  
He was a saint and a sinner rolled in one  
But I miss now that hes gone  
I sure miss him now that hes gone  
  
Sure I feel the pain  
Deep inside I pour like rain  
Remember when you smile  
Loves in your eyes  
  
The world keeps turning  
The grass still grows green  
The fruit on my tree  
Is the biggest youve ever seen  
Which way up you know when youre down  
Theyve gotta stand tall  
With your feet on the ground  
You must stand tall  
With your feet on the ground  
  
Or maybe Im crazy  
Also they say Im lazy  
But Ill have my days  
When I do as I please  
For you wont see the woods  
While youre a tree  
No youll never see the woods  
While youre a tree  
  
Yes Im crazy  
Also they say Im lazy  
But Ill have my days  
When I do as I please  
You wont see the woods  
While youre a tree  
No youll never see the woods  
While youre a tree
