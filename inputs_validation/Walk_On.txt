If you dont like what you see  
If you can do better than me  
Walk on  
  
If the road before you winds  
Obscuring all the signs  
Walk on  
  
You mean more to me  
Than just a pretty face  
I wont hold you down  
You need a little space  
  
If you dont like what you see  
If you can do better than me  
Walk on  
  
You know I dont like to fight  
No matter whos wrong or right  
Walk on
