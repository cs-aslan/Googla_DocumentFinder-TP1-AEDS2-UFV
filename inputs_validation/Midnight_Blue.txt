Aint got no regrets  
And I aint losin track of  
Which way Im going  
I aint gonna double back no  
Dont want no misplay  
Put on no display  
And angel no  
But I know my way  
Oh yeah oh oh oh oh  
  
I used to follow  
Yeah thats true  
But my following days are over  
Now I just got to follow thru in  
I remember what my father said  
He said son life is simple  
Its either cherry red  
  
Or midnight blue oh oh oh oh oh  
Midnight blue oh oh oh ooh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
You were the restless one  
And you did not care that  
I was the trouble boy  
Lookin for a double dare  
I wont apologize for the  
Things Ive done and said  
But when I win your heart  
Im gonna paint it cherry red  
I dont want to talk about it  
What you do to me I cant live without it  
And you might think that its  
Much too soon for us to go this far  
  
Into the midnight blue oh oh oh oh oh  
Its midnight blue oh oh oh ooh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
The things could be different  
But thatd be a shame cause  
Im the one who could feel the sun  
Right in the pouring rain  
I wont say where and I  
Dont know when but  
Soon theres gonna come a day babe  
Ill be back again  
Yeah Ill be back for you  
Ah ah ah ah you see Im saving up my love  
  
Midnight blue oh oh oh oh oh  
Into the midnight blue oh oh oh oh oh  
Another midnight blue oh oh oh oh oh  
Tonight is midnight blue woah oh oh oh oh its midnight blue  
Into the midnight blue oh oh oh oh oh  
Midnight blue oh oh oh oh oh  
Midnight blue oh oh oh oh  
Tonight is midnight blue oh oh oh oh oh  
Into the midnight blue oh oh oh oh
