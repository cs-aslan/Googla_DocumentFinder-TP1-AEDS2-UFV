You are all the same  
Go the way you came  
Different names  
But very little else has changed  
  
Difficult to find  
Easy to resign  
Didnt seem to matter  
When I didnt mind  
  
Out before its in  
Everybody wins  
Give them what they want  
And they are giving in nothing in return  
  
Will we ever learn  
Its jumbled  
And its getting harder to discern  
I run my mind circles the vertigo  
  
Ive had enough  
It feels as though nothings going to change
