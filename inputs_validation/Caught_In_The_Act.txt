Suspicions rising answers arent clear  
I thought we made a promise now youve disappeared  
You seem to lead two lives at a time  
Do I still fit in I thought you were mine  
Sitting at the bar in our favorite cafe  
I turn and see ya laughin with her and your smile fades away  
Didnt surprise me theres nothin left to say  
I caught you redhanded now and you cant walk away  
CHORUS  
You were caught in the act  
When you thought I wasnt lookin at ya  
CITA I can see what youre doin  
Caught in the act and I cant stand to hear your lies  
Caught in the act dont you try and change my mind  
You called me the only you said shes only a friend  
Dont pretend youre sorry my heart will mend  
Dont you come back to me dont you try to call  
You couldnt hold my heart with love now you cant hold me at all  
CHORUS  
Caught in the act caught in the act  
Caught in the act CITA  
Caught in the act caught in the act  
Caught in the act CITA
