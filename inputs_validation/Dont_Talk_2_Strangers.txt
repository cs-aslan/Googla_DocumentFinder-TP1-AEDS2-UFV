Little darling  
Gotta go now  
Dont know when Ill be coming back  
Got my future  
All planned out  
Got my bags packed  
Things dont always turn out right  
Thats just the way it goes  
Before I leave you theres just a few things you should know  
  
Dont talk 2 strangers  
Dont forget to say your prayers at night  
Remember god he made you  
And one day hell make everything alright  
Dont cross on yellow  
you always got to wait 4 a green light  
Remember god he made you  
One day hell make everything alright  
  
Alright  
Little darling  
Gotta go now  
Dont worry youll be just fine  
When it comes 2 good luck  
I just know I just know youll always be the first in line  
Nobodyll ever love you as much as I do  
That doesnt mean other people wont love you 2  
Dont talk 2 strangers  
Dont forget 2 say your prayers at night  
Remember god he made you  
And one day hell make everything alright  
Dont cross on yellow  
you always got to wait 4 a green light  
Remember god he made you  
And one day hell make things alright  
  
Alright  
Make everything alright  
Alright  
  
Little darling  
Gotta go now  
Got my future all planned out  
Before I go  
Dont talk 2 strangers  
Dont forget to say your prayers at night  
Remember god he made you  
One day hell make everything alright
