Gene Autry  
  
Santa works all day in his workshop  
Making lots of games and toys  
Then one day he hops in his sleigh  
To bring them to the girls and boys  
Santas just as nice as he can be  
Theres just one little thing that worries me  
  
If it doesnt snow on Christmas  
How is Santa goin to use his sleigh  
In case of rain will there be a train  
Thatll speed him on his way  
If it doesnt snow on Christmas  
How will Santa get around to us  
If he breaks down on his way to town  
Will they let him use a bus  
  
I sent him a nice long letter  
And I hope its not in vain  
Id really feel much better  
If I knew he could fly a plane  
  
People say he has eight reindeer  
For the sleigh hes driving here  
But howll he go if it doesnt snow  
On Christmas this year  
  
If it doesnt snow on Christmas  
How is Santa goin to use his sleigh  
In case of rain will there be a train  
Thatll speed him on his way  
If it doesnt snow on Christmas  
How will Santa get around to us  
If he breaks down on his way to town  
Will they let him use a bus  
  
I sent him a nice long letter  
And I hope its not in vain  
Id really feel much better  
If I knew he could fly a plane  
  
People say he has eight reindeer  
For the sleigh hes driving here  
But howll he go if it doesnt snow  
On Christmas this year
