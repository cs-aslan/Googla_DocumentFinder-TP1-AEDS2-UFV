Not of this Earth  
youve changed places with the Sun  
I know that youre the one  
I love what weve become  
  
Not of this earth  
I wear you like a shroud  
I know I make you proud  
You done your crying now  
  
She is not of this earth  
And I no longer need to search  
If I ever leave this World  
You will have a song to sing  
So you know what you were  
  
Not of this Earth  
She keep walking down my lane  
Ive learned to laugh again  
Like a muff to a flame  
  
Not of this Earth  
Not surprised were unashamed  
shes gonna have to change your name  
They will know that were the same  
  
She is not of this Earth  
And I believed weve seen the worst  
If I ever leave this world  
You will have a song to sing  
So you know what you were  
  
Not of this Earth  
Better get used to the smile  
Not of this Earth  
Gonna be around for awhile  
Not of this Earth  
Spent too much time being cursed  
Not of this Earth  
  
Not of this Earth  
You changed places with the Sun  
I know that youre the one  
I love what weve become  
  
Not of this earth  
I wear you like a shroud  
I know I made you proud  
I know I made you proud  
You done your crying now  
Not of this Earth
