Sleep and dream of this  
Death angels kiss  
Brings final bliss  
Dont believe it  
  
Empty they say  
Death wont you let me stay  
Empty they say  
Death hear me call your name  
Oh call your name  
Suicide Ive already died  
Its just the funeral Ive been waiting for  
Cyanide living dead inside  
Break this empty shell forevermore  
  
Wait wait patiently  
Your deathblack wings  
Unfolding sleep  
Treading on me  
  
Empty they say  
Death wont you let me stay  
Empty they say  
Death hear me call your name  
Oh call your name  
Suicide Ive already died  
Its just the funeral Ive been waiting for  
Cyanide living dead inside  
Break this empty shell forevermore  
  
Say is that rain or are they tears  
That stained your concrete face for years  
Crying weeping shedding strife  
Year after year life after life  
A narrow freshly broken ground  
A concrete angel laid right down  
Upon the moon that swallows fast  
Its peace at last  
Oh peace at last  
  
Empty they say  
Death wont you let me stay  
Empty they say  
Death hear me call your name  
Oh call your name  
Suicide Ive already died  
Its just the funeral Ive been waiting for  
Cyanide living dead inside  
Break this empty shell forevermore  
  
Forevermore  
Forevermore  
Its the funeral Ive been waiting for
