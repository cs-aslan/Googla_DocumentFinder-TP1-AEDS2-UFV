Verse 1  
There I was completely wasting  
Out of work and down  
All inside its so frustrating  
As I drift from town to town  
Feel as though nobody cares  
If I live or die  
So I might as well begin  
To put some action in my life  
  
Chorus  
Breaking the law breaking the law  
Breaking the law breaking the law  
Breaking the law breaking the law  
Breaking the law breaking the law  
  
Verse 2  
So much for the golden future  
I cant even start  
Ive had every promise broken  
Theres anger in my heart  
You dont know what its like  
You dont have a clue  
If you did youd find yourselves  
Doing the same thing too  
  
Chorus  
Breaking the law breaking the law  
Breaking the law breaking the law  
Breaking the law breaking the law  
Breaking the law breaking the law  
  
Bridge guitar solo 1  
You dont know what its like  
Sirens blare  
  
Bridge guitar solo 2  
  
Chorus x2  
Breaking the law breaking the law  
Breaking the law breaking the law  
Breaking the law breaking the law  
Breaking the law breaking the law
