Peaches and cream  
  
The light was on and everything I felt was strong  
I watched as your mascara ran  
Didnt get far on that golden tan  
  
I heard you sigh but I dont wanna see you cry  
You looked just like a walking dream  
Sweeter than peaches and cream  
  
Chorus  
If you want me let me know  
I can show you how  
If youve got nowhere to go  
I can show you now  
  
Im yours to tame and I dont even know your name  
I like to touch your perfect skin  
I cant stop once I begin  
  
To show you more than I have ever shown before  
If you could read whats on my mind  
Give me yours and Ill give you mine  
  
Chorus  
  
We could be we could see  
More than we know  
We should be we should see  
More than we know  
And Id like to know  
  
ChorusTwice  
  
Sweeter than peaches and cream If you want me let me know  
Sweeter than peaches and cream I can show you how  
Repeat and fade
