Little Boy kneels at the foot of the bed  
Droops on the little hands little gold head  
Hush Hush Whisper who dares  
Christopher Robin is saying his prayers  
  
God bless Mummy I know thats right  
Wasnt it fun in the bath tonight  
The colds so cold and the hots so hot  
Oh God bless Daddy I quite forgot  
If I open my fingers a little bit more  
I can see Nannys dressing gown on the door  
Its a beautiful blue but it hasnt a hood  
Oh God bless Nanny and make her good  
Mine has a hood and I lie in bed  
And pull the hood right over my head  
And I shut my eyes and I curl up small  
And nobody knows that Im there at all  
Oh Thank you God for a lovely day  
And what was the other I had to say  
I said Bless Daddy so what can it be  
Oh Now I remember it God bless me  
  
Little Boy kneels at the foot of the bed  
Droops on the little hands little gold head  
Hush Hush Whisper who dares  
Christopher Robin is saying his prayers
