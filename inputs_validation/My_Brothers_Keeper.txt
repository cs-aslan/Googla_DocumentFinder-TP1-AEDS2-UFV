Chorus  
They dont know how far back that we go we go  
From riding skates to riding 24s  
From off the block hustlin to rockin shows  
We done seen many bumps in the road  
But still we remain still in the game  
Never worry  about them haters that will never change  
And I put this on everything babe  
I am my brothers keeper  
  
Listen Droc I know you dont think I care for ya  
But at a drop of a dime Ill be there for ya  
And anybody want to see us apart we need to get rid of  
They ass man and thats from the heart  
Pick em apart now that the ying yang twins got some ends  
We seem to have plenty of friends excuse me then friend  
Let me borrow a stack and when tomorrow comes dont ask me to borrow it back  
If they cant do that they dont contribute to the answer  from the   
Serious as cancer If I was jojo dancer I would do the same thang  
Not to let another man spark my flame Droc is the ying  
Kain is the yang but without  
The both of us we aint got a damn thang  
Its me and my brother my brother and me all that you see on TV  
  
Chorus  
  
United states of Atlanta its still me  
And my brother we done been through a lot but still kain I love ya  
Blood sweat and tears good days and bad from  
The time you make me laugh you made me mad  
I still got cha back but imma take ya way back  
When we was sufferin just to get a nickle sack scraping up  
Change trying to make 2 dollars or 3 to get  
Some 99 cent hamburgers to eat  
And then ride thorough atlanta in yo raggedy car  
Back then we was some  
Underground superstars and these last 5 years we done put work in  
Now the whole world know of the ying yang twins  
Even though we dont spend time at home  
Together we hit the road and its like we never left each other  
Now thats love  
I love you til the day that I leave so its still my brother and me  
  
Chorus  
  
People of the world we must change our mind frame  
And stay away from the con and mind games  
Its hard to maintain and stay sane at the same time steady  
Working hard but you bareky gettin by trying  
To make a line between stress and peace  
And satan always gettin the best of me  
My closest of kin my best  
Friend man we all in the struggle  
But you gotta remember Im yo brother  
Listen people you need to start helping yo brother  
Helping yo sister mama daddy children and all  
Dont leave these babies out here all alone they  
Dont know whats going on THey dont know right from wrong  
So when you see yo brother give him a hug  
And a shoulder to lean on and dont leave him out here  
On his own cause times gettin hard these days  
We at war amongest ourselves and we at war overseas brother  
  
Chorus
