I got the invitation that you sent me  
You wanted me to see you change your name  
I couldnt stand to see you wed another  
But dear I hope youre happy just the same  
  
I planned a little cottage in the valley  
I even bought that little band of gold  
I thought some day Id place it on your finger  
But now the future looks so dark and cold  
  
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel  
That should be ringing now for you and me  
Down the aisle with someone else youre walking  
Those wedding bells with never ring for me  
  
Darling lets turn back the years  
And go back to yesterday  
Lets pretend that time has stopped  
And I didnt go away  
  
We had our love to make us happy  
Love wasnt meant to bring us tears  
Love like ours should never die  
So darling lets turn back the years  
  
I fancy that I see a bunch of roses  
A blossom from and orange tree in your hair  
While the organ plays I Love You Truly  
Just let me pretend that I am there  
  
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel  
That should be ringing now for you and me  
Down the aisle with someone else youre walking  
Those wedding bells will never ring for me  
Those wedding bells will never ring for me
