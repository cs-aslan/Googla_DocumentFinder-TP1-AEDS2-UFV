Your lips were made for kisses so tender  
Im almost in love tonight  
When we are close my heart says surrender  
Im almost in love tonight  
  
And here under the spell of evening  
I long to hold you tight  
Heaven is near why think of tomorrow  
Im almost in love tonight  
  
It may be just the spell of evening  
I long to hold you tight  
Heaven is near why think of tomorrow  
Im almost in love tonight  
  
Almost in love
