What would you do What would you say  
How does it feel Pretend its OK  
My eyes deceive me but its still the same  
Pretend its OK  
  
I remember the day when we were out all night  
I wish that I can get the day back and tell you its alright  
Cause we all do the same thing we just dont realize  
That were living on borrowed time  
  
What would you do What would you say  
How does it feel Pretend its OK  
My eyes deceive me but its still the same  
Pretend its OK  
  
I see the light that Im chasing  
A memory but its fading  
When its gone Ill be waiting  
Knowing its too late knowing its too late  
You chose the road that Im walking  
Now its your soul that Im caught in  
And youre not hearing when Im calling  
Calling your name  
  
One breath one step one life one heart  
Two words two eyes new beginning new start  
Too neat too narrow too short too bright  
Im there with you here by my side  
  
What would you do What would you say  
How does it feel Pretend its OK  
My eyes deceive me but its still the same  
Pretend its OK  
  
Nothing here no one talking knowing its too late  
But sometimes it can get so hard pretending its OK  
Nothing here no one talking nothings gonna change  
But sometimes it can get so hard pretending its OK  
  
What would you do what would you do  
What would you say what would you say  
How does it feel Pretend its OK  
My eyes deceive me but its still the same  
Pretend its OK  
  
What would you do what would you do  
What would you say what would you say  
How does it feel Pretend its OK  
My eyes deceive me but its still the same  
Pretend its OK  
  
Oh yeah  
What would you do What would you say  
Pretending its OK  
What would you do What would you say
