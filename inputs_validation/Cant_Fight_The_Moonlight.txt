Under a lovers sky  
Gonna be with you  
And no ones gonna be around  
If you think that you wont fall  
Well just wait until  
Til the sun goes down  
  
Underneath the starlight starlight  
Theres a magical feeling so right  
Itll steal your heart tonight  
  
You can try to resist  
Try to hide from my kiss  
But you know  
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight  
Deep in the dark  
Youll surrender your heart  
But you know  
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight  
No you cant fight it  
Its gonna get to your heart  
  
Theres no escape from love  
Once a gentle breeze  
Weaves its spell upon your heart  
No matter what you think  
It wont be too long  
Til your in my arms  
Underneath the starlight starlight  
Well be lost in the rhythm so right  
Feel it steal your heart tonight  
  
You can try to resist  
Try to hide from my kiss  
But you know  
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight  
Deep in the dark  
Youll surrender your heart  
But you know  
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight  
No you cant fight it  
No matter what you do  
The night is gonna get to you  
  
Dont try then  
Youre never gonna win  
  
Part of me the starlight starlight  
Theres a magical feeling so right  
It will steal your heart tonight  
  
You can try to resist  
Try to hide from my kiss  
But you know  
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight  
Deep in the dark  
Youll surrender your heart  
But you know  
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight  
No you cant fight it  
  
You can try to resist  
Try to hide from my kiss  
But you know  
Dont you know that you cant fight the moonlight  
Deep in the dark  
Youll surrender your heart  
But you know  
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight  
No you cant fight it  
Its gonna get to your heart
