Its the dawn of the day and Im crashed and Im smashed  
As it is Im feelin like my chips are cashed  
All of my clothes strewn all over the room  
The crisis at hand is Im all out of zoom  
  
Chorus  
I got the sunlight blues  
I cant find my shoes  
The only thing on TV  
Is the Good Morning News  
  
The tricks of the night  
Keepin me in a daze  
Open a bottle and Ill pull down the shades  
Glance in the mirror  
Back into bed  
Forget that its day time to party again  
  
Chorus  
Bright light fright  
Bright light fright  
Bright light fright  
Give me the night  
  
Bright light fright  
Bright light fright  
Bright light fright  
Give me the night  
  
Repeat Chorus To Fade
