True we acted like we should  
And did all that we could  
When you pushed we never pulled  
We answered back yes anything  
We can give you anything  
  
Will you take everything  
Cause we do not need a thing  
  
This fire  
This fire burning it burns inside of me  
This fire  
This fire burning it burns inside of me  
Not fading away not fading away  
Our love our hope never faded away  
This fire  
This fire burning it burns inside of me  
  
Truth we were never understood or acted like we should  
I cannot let you win we dont owe you anything  
For we wont give you anything  
Try and take everything  
But we wont give you anything  
  
This fire  
This fire burning it burns inside of me  
This fire  
This fire burning it burns inside of me  
Not fading away not fading away  
Our love our hope never faded away  
This fire  
This fire burning it burns inside of me  
  
Build a fire for yourself  
  
We wont give you anything  
  
This fire  
This fire burning it burns inside of me  
This fire  
This fire burning it burns inside of me  
Not fading away not fading away  
Our love our hope never faded away  
This fire  
This fire burning it burns inside of me
