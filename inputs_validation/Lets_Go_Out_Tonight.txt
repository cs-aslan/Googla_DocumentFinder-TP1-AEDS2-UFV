Look At Me  
Hanging On A Word Every Little Word  
Look At You  
Staring Out The Window For A Different Point Of View  
What Should We Do  
  
Nothings Changed  
Everythings The Same Same Old Same  
Lie In Bed  
Staring At The Ceiling Wish I Was Somewhere Else Instead  
Enough Said  
  
Lets Go Out Tonight  
Cant Stand To Look At These Four Walls  
Lets Go Out Tonight  
  
I Have Found  
I Cant Stand The Silence Cant You Make A Sound  
What Is Wrong  
I See Your Body Language Telling Me You Think Its Over  
Before Its Over  
  
Lets Go Out Tonight  
Cant Stand To Look At These Four Walls  
Lets Go Out Tonight  
Lets Go Out Tonight  
Ill Do Anything At All  
Lets Go Out Tonight  
  
You Say Weve Got To Get Away  
Weve Outgrown This Town Its So Mundane  
But If Youre Asking Me  
The Chance Is There But Were Never Gonna Leave  
Never Gonna Leave
