Storm warning  
Feels like a heavy rain  
Winds on the coast tonight  
We may get tossed tonight  
  
Storm warning  
Hes made it pretty plain  
Hes fallin for another  
Found a new lover and he wont be back again  
  
Cant stop a river  
When its burst its banks  
Ive seen the look in his eyes  
Hes in love and hypnotized  
  
Time of mourning  
Theres already been a flood of my tears  
Such a sense of loss tonight  
Nought to do but ride it out  
  
Cant stop a river when its burst its banks  
I wonder how long its gonna take  
To get over this heartbreak  
  
Storm warning  
Feels like a heavy rain  
Winds on the coast tonight  
We may get tossed tonight  
  
Storm warning
