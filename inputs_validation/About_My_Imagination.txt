I kept my eyes open and tried to see  
The point of what went on in front of me  
I kept what moved me forgot about the rest  
And took my young imagination to the acid test  
  
And it was easy then to say what love could do  
Its so easy when your world is new  
  
Its been so hard sometimes to find my way  
I let my pleasure lead my little world astray  
And if Im truthful Ill say that I was blind  
To everything about this life but what I had in mind  
  
And it was easy then to say where love could go  
Its so easy when theres so much you dont know  
  
About my imagination it got me through somehow  
Without my imagination I wouldnt be here now  
  
And it was easy then when love was guaranteed  
Its so easy when love is all you need  
  
About my imagination  
Im making this investigation  
Into my imagination  
According to my computations  
Were overdue for a transformation  
Or is it my imagination  
  
I keep my eyes open and try to see  
This life in terms of possibility  
With so much changing and changing for the worse  
You got to keep your head up Baby  
From the cradle to the hearse  
  
And it was easy then to say where love could go  
Its so easy when love is all you know  
  
About my imagination  
Im getting ready for the celebration  
Im bringing my imagination  
Taking charge of my elevation  
No fear no trepidation  
Register my affirmation  
No doubt no hesitation  
People get ready for the embarkation  
  
About my imagination  
Calling out across the nation  
Its time for some kind of rededication  
Not talking bout just my generation  
Im sending out this invocation  
I keep getting these excitations  
More light more love  
More truth and more innovation
