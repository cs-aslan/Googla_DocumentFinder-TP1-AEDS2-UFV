Shes all crazy and shit  
She shows us her tits  
Shes just a cornfed whitebred chick  
Born in the right zip code  
She comes with a gold card  
Shell never have to pay for it  
What would she do without you x2  
What would she do  
Hes not afraid of the future  
Hes hot off the platter  
Hes been handed a blank check  
  
Hes brung an agenda  
And hes got a place to put it  
What would he do without you x3  
What would he do  
Is this the best that you can get x2  
That you can get  
The best that you can get  
Is this the best that you can get  
The best that you can get  
Im not afraid of the ocean  
Afraid of devotion  
Ive got the balls to prove it  
What would I do without you x3  
Is this the best that you can get  
What would I do
