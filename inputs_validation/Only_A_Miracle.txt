Ive always said that I believe anything can happen  
Lately Ive been wonderin if thats really true  
For a boy time can be a lovely dance  
Then suddenly the music can fade  
Leave the man alone and dreamless  
Till he only sees that hes used up all his chances after all  
Til now only a miracle could do to save the man Ive turned into  
Wont somebody let me know wheres my miracle  
Love it always seemed so easy  
Just like a child who plays with imaginary friends  
I could see the face of someone I believe  
But only in the words of a song  
Then she came along and got me dreamin  
Thats when you began and when I held you I held a miracle in my hands  
Til now only a miracle could do Ive found the boy I was in you  
Youve come to let me know there are miracles  
And now only a miracle could do what I have finally found in you  
Ive come to let you know I believe that  
Miracles can happen in the end
