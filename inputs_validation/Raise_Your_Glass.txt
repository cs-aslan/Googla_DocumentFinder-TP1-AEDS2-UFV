Right right turn off the lights  
We gonna lose our minds tonight  
Whats the dealio  
  
I love when its all too much  
Five am turn the radio up  
Wheres the rock and roll  
  
Party crasher  
Panty snatcher  
Call me up if you want a gangsta  
Dont be fancy just get dancy  
Why so serious  
  
So raise your glass if you are wrong  
In all the right ways  
All my underdogs  
We will never be never be anything but loud  
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks  
Wont you come on and come on and raise your glass  
Just come on and come on and raise your glass  
  
Slam slam oh hot damn

Its so on right now so fuckin on right now
