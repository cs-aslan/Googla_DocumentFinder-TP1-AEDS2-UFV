Well Ive hiked through the sage brush I ran up some rail  
I slept on the bench in a few county jails  
And they laugh as they knocked all the wind from my sail  
When I was a young Dallas Cowboy  
Ive tried hard to tackle the problems at hand  
Ive kicked a few habits and Ive marched to the band  
I tried hard to follow the lady of the land  
When I was a young Dallas Cowboy  
Ive made a few passes that werent incomplete  
I stumbled through yards on my way to the street  
Running from beds where I did more than sleep  
When I was a young Dallas Cowboy  
  
Well he tackled the bottle and he fumbled the ball  
And hed touchdown in alleys along where hed fall  
Just wait for his son to make up for it all  
When I was a young Dallas Cowboy  
When I was a baby he broke up the team  
Divorcing my mama to live with a dream  
He had back in college when he was still green  
And I was a young Dallas Cowboy  
  
Now the footballs I held did not fit in my hand  
Got me a guitar and Ive got me a band  
So dont put me down when Im taking my stand  
Be proud of this young Dallas Cowboy  
Yeah Im proud Im a young Dallas Cowboy  
Be proud of those young Dallas Cowboys
