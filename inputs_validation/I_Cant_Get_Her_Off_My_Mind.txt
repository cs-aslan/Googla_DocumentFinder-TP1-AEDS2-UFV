Ive been standing on the corner all day  
Tryin to think of little things to say  
Cause she walks by evry day about this time  
And I dont think Ill ever get her off of my mind  
  
Well I only met her bout a week ago  
But the way she smiles let me know  
That she could see that maybe we were two of a kind  
And I dont think Ill ever get her off of my mind  
  
Oh shes so pretty I couldnt believe  
Shed ever look my way  
But the way Im feeling  
Im gonna be stealing  
That little girls heart today  
  
Well Im so happy I could almost fly  
And I guess you know the reason why  
Im walkin down the street with her little hand in mine  
And I dont think Ill ever get her off of my mind  
  
Oh shes so pretty I couldnt believe  
Shed ever look my way

Im walkin down the street with her little hand in mine  
And I dont think Ill ever get her off of my mind  
And I dont think Ill ever get her off of my mind
