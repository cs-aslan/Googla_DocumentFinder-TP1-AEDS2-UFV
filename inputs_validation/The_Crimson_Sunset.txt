Im much wiser now  
A lifetime of memories  
Run through my head  
They taught me how  
For better or worse alive or dead  
I realize theres no turning back  
Life goes on the offbeaten track  
I sit down with my son  
Set to see the Crimson Sunset  
Many years have come and gone  
Ive lived my life but now must move on  
Hes my only one  
Now that my time has come  
Now that my life is done  
We look in to the sun  
Seize th day and dont you cry  
Now its time to say goodbye  
Even though Ill be gone  
I will live on
