My baby never treats me  
Sweet and gentle  
The way he should  
I got it bad and that aint good  
No that aint good  
My poor heart is sentimental  
Not made of wood  
Cause Ive got it bad and that aint good  
And when the weekends over  
And Monday rolls around  
I end up like I start out  
Just cryin my heart out  
Lord above me  
Make him love me  
The way he should  
The way he should  
Because Ive got it so bad and that aint good  
I got it bad and that aint good
