Imma shine Im gonna make it  
Aint nothing to it to it  
Ill take it i take it  
I feel it i feel it  
Ill flip it ill flip it  
Pull it pull it ill straight get it  
Imma climb  
I aint waitin  
Theres no end to the money Im makin  
For streetin for chasin we get it in  
The crunk hatin  
  
If ya dont believe you dont succeed  
And if ya dont apply you wont achieve  
Keep ya head up high  
Feet down low and follow your heart  
To get to the door  
  
If there is a will then heres a way not bells and wheels and wheels away  
Never trust a soul Im here to say  
Stop dependin and be yourself  
And grab a hold and dont look left  
So take a swing now heres your chance  
You got nothing to lose so make a stance  
See the clock is tickin and time aint waitin when ya  
All alone see thats what your facin  
  
Chorus  
  
Ya I know Imma make it I was meant for this  
Imma with ya in the eye lookin for the ten for this  
And I dont steal for this I pimp for this  
Ride round with a hundred round clip for this  
What happen to the struggle its called  
And eviction notice  
Now people strong self eviction notice  
Prescription cops serve keep it real  
That fine but if I get wit it Imma face some time  
And its hard being young and rich  
Trying to survive  
Trying to keep a shot to shine  
On the poor headed ties  
Couple mill  
And I buy new whip for the wife  
Talk that shit but this is my life  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
Im gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel
it  
Im gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
Im gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel
it  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X  
  
Im gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
Im gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel
it  
Im gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
Im gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel
it
