Im in control I got a bulletproof soul  
And Im full of selfesteem  
I invented myself with no ones help  
Im a prototype supreme  
I sit on my private throne  
And run my lifestyle all alone  
Me myself and I agree  
We dont need nobobdy else  
  
I never learned to bow bend or crawl  
To any known authority  
I really want to build my statue tall  
Thats all  
  
Im just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why cant I be God  
  
I got no time to take advice  
I want to gamble with my eternity with loaded dice  
I dont need a preacher in my face  
When Im the omnipresent ruler of the human race  
Aint gonna spend my life being no ones fool  
I was born to rock and I was born to rule  
But if Im wrong on judgement day  
Im royally screwed with hell to pay  
  
I never learned to bow bend or crawl  
To any known authority  
I really want to build my statue tall  
Thats all  
  
Im just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why cant I be God  
Im just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why cant I be God  
  
Im just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why cant I be God  
Im just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why cant I be God
