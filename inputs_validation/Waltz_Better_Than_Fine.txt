If you dont have a song  
To sing youre okay  
You know how to get along  
Humming  
Hmmm  
  
If you dont have a date  
Celebrate  
Go out and sit on the lawn  
And do nothing  
Cause its just what you must do  
Nobody does it anymore  
  
No I dont believe in the wasting of time  
But I dont believe that Im wasting mine  
  
If you dont have a point to make  
Dont sweat it  
Youll make a sharp one being so kind  
And Id sure appreciate it  
Everyone elses goals to get big headed  
Why should I follow that beat being that Im  
Better than fine
