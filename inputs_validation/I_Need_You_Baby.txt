Please listen baby try and understand  
As sure as a woman needs a man  
I need you baby I just wanted you then  
But Im in love with you now  
I walk the floor sprinkled with tears since youve been gone  
Oh itd seem like a thousand years  
I need you baby I just wanted you then  
But Im in love with you now  
True love like yours is so hard to find  
If you dont come back baby Lord knows Ill lose my mind  
I need you baby I just wanted you then  
But Im in love with you now  
He loved other women and I love only you  
But you fall on him Lord like the morning dew  
I need you baby I just wanted you then  
But Im in love with you now  
Do you care for me less than you did before   
Or dont you love me at all anymore   
I need you baby I just wanted you then  
But I do love you now
