Hey look yonder  
Whats that I see  
Well that old bogus honey  
Comin after me  
  
I goin told you  
Was out of town  
I wonder how she knowed  
I was hangin around  
  
Say listen babe  
Dont go wastin your time  
You keep comin round  
Youll hear the same old line  
  
You got a thousand boys  
You say you need em  
You take whats good for you  
And Ill take my freedom  
  
Cause lately its been so hard  
To make ends meet  
And honey youre headin down a  
One way street  
And I gotta go the other way  
Heh heh heh  
  
I thought I knew her  
My cagey lady  
How come my sunshine  
Was so damn shady  
Shell say she love to talk  
A conversation  
But Im the one  
Who makes my situation  
  
This one way city  
That I thought I knew  
Its such a pity honey  
Thats it for you  
Cause lately its been so hard  
To make ends meet  
And honey youre headin down a  
One way street  
And I gotta go the other way  
  
Theres nothing over here  
I never showed you  
I made it pretty clear  
Im glad to know you  
  
You know your brother Spike  
Hes on the level  
But you always lookin  
Like youre mad at the devil  
  
Dont say I cop a tude  
Its all forgotten  
Its just youre much too rude  
Your fruits are rotten  
  
You know I work so hard to keep it alive  
Now all I hear from you  
Is nothing but jive  
  
Lately its been so hard  
Now to make ends meet  
And honey youre headin down a  
One way street  
And Im goin on the other way  
Yes I do  
  
And lately its been so hard  
To make ends meet  
And honey youre headin down a  
One way street  
And I really been feelin  
Like I could be movin on  
  
Youre headin down a one way street  
Youre foolin everybody you meet  
I said youre headin down a one way street  
Youre foolin everybody but me  
I said youre headin down a one way street  
Youre foolin everybody you meet  
I said youre headin down a one way street  
Youre foolin everybody but me  
You got to get yourself back on your feet
