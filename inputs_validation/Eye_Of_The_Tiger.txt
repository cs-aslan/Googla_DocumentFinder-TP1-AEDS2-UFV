Risin up back on the street  
Did my time took my chances  
Went the distance now Im back on my feet  
Just a man and his will to survive  
So many times it happens too fast  
You trade your passion for glory  
Dont lose your grip on the dreams of the past  
You must fight just to keep them alive  
  
Its the eye of the tiger  
Its the thrill of the fight  
Rising up to the challenge of our rival  
And the last known survivor  
Stalks his prey in the night  
And hes watching us all  
With the eye of the tiger  
  
Face to face out in the heat  
Hangin tough stayin hungry  
They stack the odds still we take to the street  
For the kill with the skill to survive  
  
Its the eye of the tiger  
Its the thrill of the fight  
Rising up to the challenge of our rival  
And the last known survivor  
Stalks his prey in the night  
And hes watching us all  
With the eye of the tiger  
  
Risin up straight to the top  
Had the guts got the glory  
Went the distance now Im not gonna stop  
Just a man and his will to survive  
Its the eye of the tiger  
Its the thrill of the fight  
Rising up to the challenge of our rival  
And the last known survivor  
Stalks his prey in the night  
And hes watching us all  
With the eye of the tiger  
The eye of the tiger  
The eye of the tiger  
The eye of the tiger
