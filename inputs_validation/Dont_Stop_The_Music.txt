Dont stop the music let it play one more song  
The same one thats played tonight for so long  
Shes out with another I saw them tonight  
Sitting there close together she knows that not right  
So dont stop the music let it play one more song  
The same one thats played tonight for so long  
My pockets are empty I spent my last dime  
But Ive just got to hear that song one more time  
  
Dont be mad at me Mister I know that its wrong  
But I want you to hear the words of that song  
So dont stop the music dont make me go home  
I know shes not there and I cry all night long  
So dont stop the music
