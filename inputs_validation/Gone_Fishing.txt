Im going fishing  
I got me a line  
Nothin I dos gonna make the difference  
So Im taking the time  
  
And you aint never gonna be happy  
Anyhow anyway  
So Im going fishing  
And Im going today  
  
Im going fishing  
Sounds crasy I know  
I know nothing about fishing  
But just watch me go  
  
And when my time has come  
I will look back and see  
Peace on the shoreline  
That could have been me  
  
You can waste whole lifetime  
Trying to be  
What you think is expected of you  
But youll never be free  
  
May as well go fishing
