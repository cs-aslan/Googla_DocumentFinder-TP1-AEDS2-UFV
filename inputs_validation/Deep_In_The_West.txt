Deep in the west where the tall mountains grow Ive gone home  
Where the heavens above turn red from the fire down below  
Are you listening to me when Im talking to you  
Said together were one divided were through  
Divided were through  
  
Silver friend at night yellow friend you come with the dawn  
Back in my heart Ive been drying my eyes see me run  
So you hang on to me and Ill hang on to you  
Said together were one divided were through  
Divided were through  
  
Refusing to talk I suppose that its all for loves sake  
And learning to give thats important before you can take from me  
Are you listening to me when Im talking to you  
Said together were one divided were through  
  
So you hang on to me and Ill hang on to you  
Said together were one divided were through  
Divided were through
