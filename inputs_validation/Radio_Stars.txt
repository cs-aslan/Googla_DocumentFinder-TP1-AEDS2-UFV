Occasionally the overwhelming temptation to reach  
The pinnacle of the pop music genre will reduce even  
The most deplorable examples of the underground music scene  
To attempt to change their socalled artistic endeavors in a  
Vain attempt to appeal to the public at large  
Behold the metamorphosis  
  
Uh fuck platinum platinum just aint enough  
We need more money more house and cars and stuff  
Im sick of juggalos I want them other hoes  
I want them shitty hoes you get with radio and videos  
Well do whatever it takes to get some air play  
Well make that bounce shit triple our sales and pay  
Yeah come on Shaggy What Follow my lead Lets go  
Its time we change our shit up to get what we need Come on  
  
Uh radio play  
Yo Yo Come on and ride me ride me  
Pull Pull Come on and hide me hide me  
Cat black Im gonna grow one gold one  
Club Cat You want them old ones old ones  
Black black

Cut cut We gonna throw it away throw it away  
Give up Give us the radio play radio play  
  
What Hey What What What Hey What What What Hey  
What Hey What What What Hey What What What Hey  
  
We in this woodie what  
We seeing forty forty  
  
The pathetic attempts never cease  
The moronic musical onslaught continues to insult  
The intelligence of the savvy consumer  
How much more can an audience be asked to endure  
  
Didnt work ah fuck what happened  
They always told us that we sucked at rapping  
Well I dont know how to play a guitar  
Ill play the skin flute to be a radio star  
Im sick of keeping it real and underground  
I want the ten millions fans sellout radio sound  
Even though well be played next summer  
Show me a radio dick and Ill show you a hummer  
Here we go oh my god  
  
Joey fell in love with a college girl  
She had a backpack and a pony tail  
She said her name was Lisa but I do not know  
She drinks disco lemonade and cherry jello  
I can put my Buddy Holly glasses on  
I can even sing one of these faggot songs  
I can play in checkered pants and never smile  
Whatevers cool for your radio show  
Tommy fell in love with a college  
  
The borish bumbling buffoons are baffled in their journey  
Through the music business Each sonnet is more ridiculous  
Than the last Their strides towards musical success are  
Little more than a stumble into complete failure  
  
That was bullshit What the fuck You think of something  
Im sitting here trying to write hits your doing nothing  
You wrote the crump shit but did it work No  
It flopped on its ass At least I tried though  
Alright aint no need to be fighting with each other  
We need to start talking about relationships and lovers Why  
Can you sing No Neither can I  
If were gonna be radio stars we at least gotta try  
  
Correction remix uh remix Clownboy uh feel me  
Touch me Clownboy remix uh  
Girl I gotta let you know on radio  
I want to lick you from head to toe  
Girl your perfume its smelling so sweet  
I want to make love between the sheets  
Girl play my song when Im on the phone long  
Im a radio man and I know that I cant sing yes I can  
Give me one more chance and Ill make you dance  
Girl we make radio songs for radio fans we cant go wrong  
Girl we make radio songs for radio fans we cant go wrong  
Girl we make radio songs for radio fans we cant go wrong  
Girl we make radio songs for radio fans we cant go wrong  
Girl so you fucked my boy I dont give a fuck  
  
After years of endless attempts  
ICP received almost no radio play  
Finally the two dim witted idiots  
Decided to stay with the wicked shit for life
