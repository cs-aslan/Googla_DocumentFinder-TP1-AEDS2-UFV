He had his fathers eyes  
And his mothers point of view  
There was no disguise  
He couldnt see through  
Sometimes the little things  
They dont seem so small  
But they had a good thing overall  
  
Chorus  
  
Nobody nobody nobody nobody  
Knew him the way you did  
Its hard to say exactly why he left you  
Maybe a change for good  
Dont cry Ilene  
  
There was a rainbow over here  
He didnt see it from over there  
Black and white are fine  
But hes color blind  
Watching over me  
There must have been some kind of mystery  
Because I wanted him too  
But it was all wrong all wrong  
  
Chorus  
  
Nobody nobody nobody nobody  
Knew him the way you did  
Its hard to say exactly why he left you  
Maybe a change for good  
Dont cry Ilene  
  
Nobody nobody nobody nobody  
Knew him the way you did  
Its hard to say exactly why he left you  
Maybe a change for good  
Dont cry Ilene no dont cry  
Its hard to say exactly why he left you  
Maybe a change for good  
Dont cry Ilene  
Oh no Dont cry
