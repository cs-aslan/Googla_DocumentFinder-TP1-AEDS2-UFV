Rag doll ooh Hand me down  
When she was just a kid  
Her clothes were handmedowns  
  
Handmedown  
They always laughed at her when she came into town  
Called her rag doll  
Little rag doll  
  
Such a pretty face should be dressed in lace  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Shag rag doll  
  
Id change her sad rags into glad rags  
If I could if I could  
My folks wont let me  
Cause they say that shes no good  
Shes a rag doll such a rag doll  
Though I love her so  
I cant let her know  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh  
Aah aah aah aah aah  
I love you just they way you are
