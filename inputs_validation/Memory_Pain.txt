It serves me right to suffer  
It serves me right to be alone  
It serves me right to suffer  
It serves me right to be alone  
  
You see Im living in the memory  
Of a day that has passed and gone  
  
Everytime I see a woman  
You know it makes me think about mine  
Everytime I see a woman  
You know it makes me think about mine  
  
You see Im living in the memory  
Of a woman Ive left behind  
  
It serves me right to suffer  
It serves me right to be alone  
It serves me right to suffer  
It serves me right to be alone  
  
Now Im living in the memory  
Of a woman that has passed and gone
