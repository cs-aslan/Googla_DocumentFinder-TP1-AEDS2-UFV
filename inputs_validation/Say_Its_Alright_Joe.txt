Say its alright Joe  
  
Say its alright Joe  
I need another drink  
To blow on the glass so I know Im alive  
  
Play me a song Joe  
To fill the hours till morning  
Then never again will I bother you  
Ooh build myself a tower  
No way in no way out  
Then my friends can visit me  
Once in a while  
  
Say its alright Joe  
I need some reassurance  
You never know what you might find in the night  
Ooh Im just a busy bee still alone in my hive  
Im looking for some other world  
To dream out my dreams  
  
There were kings who were laughing in the rain  
And they told me Id come here to lead the parade  
All the colors were changing the sky was in ruins  
The lights are all shining on me and on you  
Shine on  
  
Say its alright Joe  
The night will soon be over  
And nothing and no one will ever know  
Open my eyes Joe  
Id like to see the daylight  
The clock on the wall says its time to leave  
Never seen the same face twice  
Never walked the same way  
The little love that I have known  
I keep to myself  
  
If theres a fire its asleep in my bed  
I must leave it to burn until it burns itself out  
Catch as you can Im not staying here long  
Ill be coming back early or never at all  
Shine on
