Capo 3rd fret key f play d  
I got a feelin called the bluues oh lawd  
Since my baby said goodbye  
And I dont know what Ill dooooo  
All I do is sit and sighigh oh lawd  
That last long day she said goodbye  
Well lawd I thought I would cry  
Shell do me shell do you shes got that kind of lovin  
Lawd I love to hear her when she calls me  
Sweet dadadaddy such a beautiful dream  
I hate to think it all oover  
Ive lost my heart it seems  
Ive grown so used to you somehow  
Well Im nobodys sugar daddy now  
And Im loonlonesome  
I got the lovesick bluues  
  
Well Im in love Im in love with a beautiful gal  
Thats whats the matter with me  
Well Im in love Im in love with a beautiful gal  
But she dont care about me  
Lawd I tried and I tried to keep her satisfied  
But she just wouldnt stay  
So now that she is leaeavin  
This is all I can say  
  
Repeat 1st verse
