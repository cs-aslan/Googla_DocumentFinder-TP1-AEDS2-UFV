Learn to love me  
Assemble the ways  
Now today tomorrow and always  
My only weakness is a list of crime  
My only weakness iswell never mind never mind  
  
Oh shoplifters of the world  
Unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world  
Hand it over  
Hand it over  
Hand it over  
  
Learn to love me  
And assemble the ways  
Now today tomorrow and always  
My only weakness is a listed crime  
But last night the plans of a future war  
Was all I saw on Channel Four  
  
Shoplifters of the world  
Unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world  
Hand it over  
Hand it over  
Hand it over  
  
A heartless hand on my shoulder  
A push  and its over  
Alabaster crashes down  
Six months is a long time  
Tried living in the real world  
Instead of a shell  
But before I began  
I was bored before I even began  
  
Shoplifters of the world  
Unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world  
Unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world  
Unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world  
Take over
