I want somebody to share share the rest of my life  
Share my innermost thoughts know my intimate details  
Someone wholl stand by my side and give me support  
And in return shell get my support  
She will listen to me when I want to speak  
About the world we live in and life in general  
Though my views may be wrong they may even be perverted  
Shell hear me out and wont easily be converted  
To my way of thinking in fact shell often disagree  
But at the end of it all she will understand me  
want somebody who cares for me  
Passionately  
With every thought and with every breath  
Somebody who will help me see things in a different light  
All of the things I detest I will almost like  
I dont wont to be tied to anyones strings  
Im carefully try to steer clear of those things  
But when Im asleep I want somebody  
Who will put their arms around and kiss me tenderly  
Though things like this make me sick  
In a case like this Ill get away with it  
And in a case like this Ill get away with it  
Tenderly
