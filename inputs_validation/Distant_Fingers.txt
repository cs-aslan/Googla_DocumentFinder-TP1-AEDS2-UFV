When when will you be landing  
When when will you return  
Feel feel my heart expanding  
You and your alien arms  
  
All my earthly dreams are shattered  
Im so tired I quit  
Take me forever it doesnt matter  
Deep inside of your ship  
  
La la la la la la landing  
Please oh oh wont you return  
Feel see your blue lights are flashing  
You and your alien arms  
  
Deep in the forest I whirl like I did as a little girl  
Let my eyes rise in the sky looking for you  
Oh you know I would go anywhere at all  
cause no star is too far with you with you  
  
La la la la la la landing  
Please oh oh wont you return  
Feel feel my heart expanding  
You and your alien arms  
  
All my earthly dreams are shattered  
Im so tired I quit  
Take me forever it doesnt matter  
Deep inside of your ship  
Land land  
  
Oh I am waiting for you  
Oh I am waiting for you oh I am waiting for you  
Waiting for you to take me up by my starry spine  
Ohhhh ohhhh with your distant fingers  
Oh Im waiting for you waiting for you  
Oh I am waiting for you
