She doesnt know what shes done  
Little one doesnt know when to stop  
Love must find her love must find her away  
She doesnt know what hes thinking  
She only knows how he behaves  
Love must find him love must find him a way  
  
I reckon I must be just an old softy  
Cause I still believe in love  
I think the best is yet to come cause  
Where Im from is also where Im going  
And in the time that it takes to sing this song  
I hope you can see for yourself  
Love must find you love must find you a way  
  
I reckon I must be just an old softy  
Cause I still believe in love  
I think the best is yet to come cause  
Where Im from is also where Im going  
And in the time that it takes to sing this song  
I think I can see for myself  
Love has found me love has found me a way  
Oh love has surely found a way  
  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la  
  
Never did I feel like this before  
Never was I so confused  
I dont know if Im up or down  
I guess Ive got nothing to lose  
Never did I feel so good before  
Guess I might as well hold onto a feeling  
It feels so fine as long as its on my mind  
  
What a blue Monday talk about lonely  
Dont look back dont look down  
I dont know how I made it through  
I guess its got something to do with you  
Never was I so in love before  
The world is like a collageyes  
And the only thing I can see clearly  
Is the slow steady glow of love in her eyes  
Talking about the slow steady glow of love in her eyes  
  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
