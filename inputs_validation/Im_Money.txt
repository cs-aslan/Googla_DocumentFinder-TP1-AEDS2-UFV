Cause Im a user  
A schmoozer  
A big dollar loser  
But that dont matter cause my friends call me a bruiser  
And I get chicks  
Too many chicks want me  
  
Cause Im not funny  
Honey  
A big oafwhy dummy  
And I get drunk  
Too many drinks want me  
  
Yo get out get out  
The way of the money man  
Ladies know Im dope so consider me contraband  
Fellas are just jealous cause theyre ponies and Im a mustang  
Dont try to hang cause Im out with a big bang

All the ladies want to be with me  
Get get down  
All the fellas compete with me

And I know that Im trippin  
But I really dont care cause this is how Im livin

They ignore me  
Intimidated by me  
All the fellas all the fellas want to be me  
They ignore me  
Intimidated by me

But that dont matter cause I drive a land cruiser  
And I get chicks  
Too many chicks want me

Honey  
A big oafwhy dummy  
But that dont matter cause I know I play with money  
And I get drunk  
Too many drinks want me  
Slow down

Just like Anthrax  
Boys want to battle so I got me a battle axe  
Climax your girl screams my name when you have sex  
I should charge a sales tax

All the ladies want to get with me

But that dont matter cause this is how Im stickin
