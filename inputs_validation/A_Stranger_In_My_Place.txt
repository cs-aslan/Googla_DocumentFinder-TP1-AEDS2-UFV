I see the town  
Where we were born  
I see the place  
We were raised  
  
I see all the things you wanted  
That I never gave  
I see sadness  
I see sorrow  
  
I see pain in your face  
But I just cant see  
A stranger in my place  
  
I can see now where we quarrelled  
I can see now I was wrong  
I can see where you might weaken  
  
When I wasnt strong  
I see memories of a love gone bad  
That time cannot erase  
But I just cant see a stranger in my place  
  
No one seems to know you quite like I do  
No one knows the thigs that make you cry  
Looking back it seems  
I never showed you  
  
And now I lay alone and wonder why  
I can see now  
Where you might grow tired of dreams  
That dont come true  
  
I can see where I have fallen short  
Of the things I promised you  
I can see mow through my tear filled eyes no love on your face  
I must get used to seein strangers in my place
