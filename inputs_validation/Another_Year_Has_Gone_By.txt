So many 25ths of December  
Just as many 4th of Julys  
And were still holding it together  
It only comes down to you and I  
  
I know you can still remember  
Things we said right from the start  
When we said that this could be special  
Im keeping those words deep down in my heart  
  
Another year has gone by  
And Im still the one by your side  
After everything thats gone by  
Theres still no one saying goodbye  
Though another year has gone by  
  
I never been much for occasions  
You never let another birthday go by  
Without announcing how much you love me  
But the truth was always there  
Right there in your eyes  
  
And were still holding hands when were walking  
Acting like weve only just met  
But how can that be  when theres so much history  
I guess thats how true lovers can get  
  
Another year has gone by  
And Im still the one by your side  
After everything thats gone by  
Theres still no one saying goodbye  
Though another year has gone by  
  
Another year has gone by  
And Im still the one by your side  
After everything thats gone by  
Theres still no one saying goodbye  
Though another year has gone by
