X and why  
The land sea rivers trees  
The stars the sky  
That and this  
Were part of a bigger plan  
Dont know what it is  
Dont know what it is  
  
You and me  
The land sun trees the sky  
The stars the sea  
Three hundred and sixty five degrees  
I am the puzzle youre the missing piece  
Hang on a minute just a minute please  
Ill come  
And everything under the sun  
And everything under the sun  
  
What is this feeling that I cant explain  
And why am I never gonna sleep again  
What is this thing Ive never seen before  
A little boy lost in a breaking storm  
  
Pilots up and away they fly  
Some write your name in the summer sky  
Life has really only just begun  
Life it comes  
And everything under the sun  
  
X is why  
The land sea rivers trees  
The stars the sky  
Three hundred and sixty five degrees  
All of the surface and the underneath  
Searching the measures in this extra key ah  
And everything under the sun  
And everything under the sun  
  
What is this feeling that I cant explain  
And why am I never gonna sleep again  
What is this thing Ive never seen before  
A little boy lost in a breaking storm  
  
Pilots up and away they fly  
Some write your name in the summer sky  
Life has really only just begun  
Life it comes  
And everything under the sun  
  
And you dont know that youve been born  
Cant see the calm until the storm  
Cant tell your right side from your wrong  
Cant see the wave youre riding on
