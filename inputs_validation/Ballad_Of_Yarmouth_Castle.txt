Well its four oclock in the afternoon  
And the anchors have been weighed  
From Miami to Nassau  
Shes bound across the waves  
Shell be headin south through Biscayne Bay  
Into the open sea  
Yarmouth Castle shes adyin and dont know it  
Now the many years shes been to sea  
Shes seen the better times  
She gives a groan of protest  
As they cast away her lines  
And the grumble of her engines  
And the rust along her spine  
Tells the Castle shes too old to be sailin  
But the sands run out within her heart  
A tiny spark glows red  
It smolders through the evening  
Theres laughter overhead  
Now the dinners served and the cards are dealt  
And the drinks are passed around  
Deep within the fire starts aburnin  
Now its midnight on the open sea  
And the moon is shinin bright  
Some people join the party  
And others say goodnight  
Theres many who are sleepin now  
Its been a busy day  
And a tiny wisp of smoke is arisin  
Oh Lord she groans Im burning  
Let someone understand  
But her silent plea is wasted  
In the playin of the band  
Everybodys dancin on her deck  
And theyre havin such a time  
And a voice says Shut up and deal Im losin  
Deep within the Yarmouth Castle  
The fire begins to glow  
It leaps into the hallways  
And climbs and twists and grows  
And the paint she wore to keep her young  
Oh Lord how well it burns  
And soon that old fire is aragin  
Up beneath the bridge its climbin fast  
The captain stands aloft  
He calls up to the boatswain says  
Boatswain we are lost  
For the ragged hoses in the racks  
No pressure do they hold  
And the people down below will soon be dyin  
All amidships oh shes blazin now  
Its spreadin fore and aft  
The people are ascramblin  
As the fire blocks their path  
The evil smoke surrounds them  
And theyre fallin in their tracks  
And the captain in his lifeboat is aleavin  
Oh then the ship Bahama Star  
Comes steamin through the night  
She sees the Castle blazin  
And tis a terrible sight  
Jump down jump down the captain cries  
Well save you if we can  
Then the paint on his funnels is afryin  
God help the ones who sleep below  
And cannot find the way  
Thank God for those we rescue  
Upon this awful day  
Now the heroes they are many  
But the times are growin slim  
And now from stern to bow shes ablazin  
Oh the Yarmouth Castles moanin  
Shes cryin like a child  
You can hear her if you listen  
Above the roar so wild  
Is she cryin for the ones who lie  
Within her molten sides  
Or cryin for herself Im awonderin  
But the livin soon were rescued  
The ones who lived to tell  
From the Star they watched her  
As she died there in the swells  
Like a toy ship on a mill pond  
She burned all through the night  
Then slipped beneath the waves in the mornin
