His father was a Princeton lawyer  
A man of means  
His mother summacumlaude  
Former beauty queen  
With a house as big as a hotel  
On Spencer boulevard  
Thats where he got his start  
  
Eighteen years of summer camp  
And private schools  
All american golden boy  
With a silver spoon  
His future held all the promise of a president  
Wonder where it went  
  
Its hard to be the crowned prince  
When it all hits home  
You cant hide behind the wall  
Around the throne  
  
The real worlds not a playground  
Its a danger zone  
You find out who you really are  
When the pressures on  
Hes the first one in his family to wind up second best  
He couldnt pass the test  
  
His share of the fortune  
Spent on saving face  
His family comes to visit  
On the holidays  
Sometimes its so quite there  
He hears the flowers bloom  
Hes got a private room  
  
Its hard to be the crowned prince  
When it all hits home  
You cant hide behind the wall  
Around the throne  
  
Insanity is a state of mind  
Where life begins  
Or where it ends  
It all depends
