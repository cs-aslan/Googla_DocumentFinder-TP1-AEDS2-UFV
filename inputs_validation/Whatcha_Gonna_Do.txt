You never known anyone else but me and now youre free whatcha gonna do  
When youre alone and you fall down and Im not around whatcha gonna do  
And when you reach out for me and find that I aint there  
And nobody cares whatcha gonna do  
Just think of the lonely road ahead it goes bad whatcha gonna do  
Think about all weve almost had make it sad whatcha gonna do  
How will you make it through the night when youre all alone  
Youll remember me and all those good times that weve known  
Who will you lean on whatcha gonna do  
 trumpet   
How will you make it through the night  
Who will you lean on whatcha gonna do  
Whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do
