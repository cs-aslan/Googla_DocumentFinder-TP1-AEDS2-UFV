Inside always trying to get back inside  
But its so hard to penetrate pigthick skin  
Im bout as low as I can get  
Id leave but I cant forget  
Still I wonder why it aint right mmm it aint right oooh  
Aint right mmm it aint right yeah  
Bout as low as she can get  
Shell leave me but she wont forget  
And she wonders why she aint right she aint right  
  
Aint right she aint right  
Now were as low as we can get  
Cant leave and cant forget  
We aint right we aint right  
Not right we aint right  
Well its hard to believe that somebody tricked you  
when you can see you were only high  
Its all up to you so you gamble  
flat on your face and into the fire
