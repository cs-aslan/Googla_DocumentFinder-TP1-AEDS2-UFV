From New York to Hong Kong  
And back again  
Its the No1 fun maker in the nation  
Making you dance  
  
She wanna rub me down keep my muscles strong  
Keep it going on from New York to Hong Kong  
Think of something freeky in a crazy form  
As long as I dont have to put ma pants back on  
Shes the girl I never had shes the girl of my dreams  
A body like a Lamborgini covered in jeans  
Too much for a man much more than I can stand  
Wanna pack my bags aud move to Japan  
  
She has China in her eyes cant you see it  
China in her eyes  cant you feel it  
China in her eyes  a secret smile  
Oh cant you see its you and me  my china woman oh no  
I miss you so cant let you go  my China girl  dont go  
  
From Paris to Bankok  
I just cant stop  
You feel the music all around the world  
My China girl  Come on  
  
Let me get tonight you know Ill treat you right  
Want China in your eyes til the morning light  
The next day youll realize Ill be holding you tight  
Because the love you be giving is dynamite  
I wanna freak you here i wanna freak you there  
I wanna run my fingers through your hair  
Tall as the China wall I wanna feel the world  
Let nothing come between me and my China girl  
  
She has China in her eyes cant you see it  
China in her eyes  cant you feel it  
China in her eyes  a secret smile  
Oh cant you see its you and me  my China woman oh no  
I miss you so cant let you go  my China girl  dont go  
  
From the moon to the stars  
And all around the universe  
This is a dedication to you  
China in your Eyes
