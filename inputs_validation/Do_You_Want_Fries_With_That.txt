I thought that was your voice  
I thought that was my car  
Now we aint ever met before  
But I know who you are  
Youre living in my house  
And Im living in a tent  
And dont laugh this second job of mine  
Is paying both our rents  
Youre out here buying Happy Meals  
And Im eating rice and pintos  
You so much as crack a smile at me man  
Ill come through this here window  
  
Well you took my wife  
And you took my kids  
And you took that life  
That I used to live  
My pride the pool the boat my tools my dreams the dog the cat  
Yeah I think thats just about everything  
Oh I almost forgot  
Do you want fries with that  
  
Your ketchups in the bag  
And a check is in the mail  
I hope your chickens raw inside  
And I hope your bun is stale  
Im supposed to tell you  
Please come back  
But how bout this instead  
I hope you both choke on a pickle  
Man that would tickle me to death  
I dont know what youre waiting on  
Youre holding up the line  
Oh man you aint got no change coming back  
Are you out of your mind  
  
Well you took my wife  
And you took my kids  
And you took that life  
That I used to live  
My pride the pool the boat my tools my dreams the dog the cat  
Yeah I think thats all there is  
Do you want fries with that  
  
Well you took my wife  
And you took my kids  
And you stole that life  
That I used to live  
My pride the pool the boat my tools my dreams the dog the cat  
Yeah I think that about covers it  
Do you want fries with that
