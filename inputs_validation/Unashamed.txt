If I changed my mind  
If I changed my faith  
Every time a stop light signaled  
Each time I made mistakes  
I dont think that I would be where I am today  
I live my life without regrets  
What you see is what you see is  
What you see is what you get and Im  
Unashamed of the life I lead  
Unashamed of the strength on my knees  
The choices Ive made of the love that Ive saved  
Of things Ive done my belief in the one  
Unashamed of the words of my friends  
I know who they are make mistakes make amends  
Follow my instincts my star on my sleeve I wear my heart  
Unashamed unashamed  
Adding up my life it totals all my dreams  
Im counting all my blessings and the gifts I have received  
Still theres always someone something to overcome  
Took all my life to understand that I am what I am who I am  
Unashamed  
Unashamed of the life I lead  
Unashamed of the strength on my knees  
The choices Ive made of the love that Ive saved  
Of things Ive done my belief in the one  
Unashamed of the words of my friends  
I know who they are make mistakes make amends  
Follow my instincts my star on my sleeve I wear my heart  
Unashamed  
Do you wanna know how it goes  
Do you wanna control how I feel  
Do you wanna stay in my life  
Then listen here and listen good  
You got to get it got to get it got to get it right  
Unashamed  
Unashamed of the life I lead  
Unashamed of the strength on my knees  
The choices Ive made of the love that Ive saved  
Of things Ive done my belief in the one  
Unashamed of the words of my friends  
I know who they are make mistakes make amends  
Follow my instincts my star on my sleeve I wear my heart  
Unashamed  
Unashamed of the life I lead  
Unashamed of the strength on my knees  
The choices Ive made of the love that Ive saved  
Of things Ive done my belief in the one  
Unashamed of the words of my friends  
I know who they are make mistakes make amends  
Follow my instincts my star on my sleeve I wear my heart  
Unashamed
