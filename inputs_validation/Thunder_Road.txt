Red light green light  
Im coming home tonight  
Burning the freeway  
Out of control  
  
Red light dead lines  
We streak from town to town  
Is too much I need your touch  
Ive been away too long  
  
Out again upon the thunder road  
Driving back to you where I belong  
Ive had enough  
Dreams can wait  
Im coming home  
  
Spotlights wild nights  
I know it wrong from right  
Places the faces  
All look the same  
  
Hot wired so tired  
Living from song to song  
The madness the badness  
Its just a game  
  
Watch the sunrise  
From coast to coast  
Thats when I need your loving  
Oh Thats when I need it most  
Cant explain its something in the blood  
Wouldnt change it even if I could
