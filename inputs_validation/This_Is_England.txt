I hear a gang fire on a human factory farm  
Are they howling out or doing somebody harm  
On a catwalk jungle somebody grabbed my arm  
A voice spoke so cold it matched the weapon in her palm  
  
This is England  
This knife of Sheffield steel  
This is England  
This is how we feel  
  
Time on his hands freezing in those clothes  
He wont go for the carrot  
They beat him by the pole  
Some sunny day confronted by his soul  
Hes out at sea too far off he cant go home  
  
This is England  
What were supposed to die for  
This is England  
And were never gonna cry no more  
  
Black shadow of the Vincent  
Falls on a Triumph line  
I got my motorcycle jacket  
But Im walking all the time  
South Atlantic wind blows  
Ice from a dying creed  
I see no glory  
When will we be free  
  
This is England  
We can chain you to the rail  
This is England  
We can kill you in a jail  
  
The British boots go kick them  
Got em in the head  
Police aint watchin  
The newspapers been read  
Who cares to protest  
A  in the eye like a flare  
Out came the batons and  
The British warned themselves  
  
This is England  
The land of illegal dances  
This is England  
Land of a thousand stances  
This is England  
This knife of Sheffield steel  
This is England  
This is how we feel  
This is England  
This is England
