Hooked on the touch of your hand high on how you understand  
Lost when you whispered hello something in your eyes said dont go  
  
I just had to stay couldnt go away from you you knew what to do to get me  
Hung up on youhung up on youhung up on youhung up on you  
  
You knew the first time we met that I could never forget  
You held me so close to you I could never get over you  
  
You were so aware how to make me care and keep me  
Hung up on youhung up on youhung up on youhung up on you  
  
Yeah you got me where you wanted me I am where I really want to be  
Hung uphung uphung up on you  
  
Im so hung up on you that I dont know what I would do without you  
Oh it will take me forever to get enough of you and I cant help it if Im  
Hung up on youhung up on youhung up on you babyhung up on you  
Hung up on youhung up on you
