Oo ooo ooo ooo ooo  
Now the puzzles laid out on my table  
The pieces dont fit  
I move from chair to chair  
But that empty ones there where she used to sit  
Im sitting here going out of my mind  
Cause shes gone away  
She couldnt wait now I  
Im afraid its too late  
Im waitin till my angel comes home  
Its been hell bein here alone  
Ill be in heaven when my angel comes home  
Angel angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel come home  
Oo oo oo angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
Does she remember  
That I cant forget  
Does she know I regret  
I never told her how I  
I wanted to hold her  
I just let her go  
Lonely nights thinkin  
Its starting to sink in  
We had a way to go  
Well grow closer together  
By being apart  
When my angel comes home  
Its been hell bein here alone  
God tell me why has she flown  
So far away  
I pray she wont stay another day  
Ill be in heaven when my angel comes home  
Please come home  
Angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel come home  
Hoo ooo angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
Hey hey angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
Ho oo angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
Hey angel come home  
If you see her tell my angel to come home  
If you see that girl my angel come home  
Hey hey angel come home
