Come on baby lets kiss and make up  
I dont know why we had to break up  
The way you act is just not right  
I cant sleep a wink at night  
Each time I think of you I I wake up  
Say you forgive me lets kiss and make up  
I never thought Id miss you honey  
Well I was wrong thats not funny  
If I could only tell you so  
Youd be mine again I know  
Cant we start again and take up  
Say you forgive me lets kiss and make up  
  
I cant stand the game were playin  
Because of you everyones sayin  
I oughta give up and start forgettin  
But Im a fool Im still regrettin  
Since the night we had our breakup  
Say you forgive me lets kiss and make up
