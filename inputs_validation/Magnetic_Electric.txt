Oh oh oh dont dont ask me to dance  
Im scared this feelings out of my hands  
That look just took my breath away  
Its plugged me into you  
  
And Im tuning in tuning in slowly like a radio  
Radio radio radio  
You pull me in pull me in baby and I cant let go  
Cant stop now where  
  
Two hot bodies with chemistry thats on the rise  
Its electric magnetic electric  
The heat screams out and echoes all around tonight  
  
Two hot bodies bound together with no choice  
Its electric magnetic electric  
Star crossed lovers drowned in the sound of this white noise  
  
Oh yes oh yes Im hearing it loud  
I must confess I like it  
Its everything I wanted and more  
You give me bait I bite it  
  
And Im tuning in tuning in slowly like a radio  
Radio radio radio  
Its coming in coming in this signal is out of control  
Cant stop now where  
  
Two hot bodies with chemistry thats on the rise  
Its electric magnetic electric  
The heat screams out and echoes all around tonight  
  
Two hot bodies bound together with no choice  
Its electric magnetic electric  
Star crossed lovers drowned in the sound of this white noise  
  
Its electric magnetic electric  
White noise  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Two hot bodies with chemistry thats on the rise  
Its electric magnetic electric  
The heat screams out and echoes all around tonight  
  
Two hot bodies bound together with no choice  
Its electric magnetic electric  
Star crossed lovers drowned in the sound of this white noise
