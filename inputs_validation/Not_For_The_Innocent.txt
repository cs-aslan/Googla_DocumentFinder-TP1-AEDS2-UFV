Im mean and Im dirty like none youve ever seen  
Bad habits drip like honey no tongue can lick me clean  
Im not of royal blood Ive never been discreet  
Better lock up your daughters were comin to your town  
Were here for the slaughter kick you when youre down  
Kick you when youre down  
  
Chorus  
Were not for the innocent were not for the innocent  
Were not for the innocent let the beast run wild  
  
Ive been damned Ive been cursed Ive been guilty and abused  
I spit the hangman in his face and hung him on his noose  
Habitual threat I got you in my claws  
  
Gonna tan your hide rip the flesh off your bones  
Look me in the eye and youre gonna turn to stone  
Youre gonna turn to stone  
  
Chorus  
  
Better lock up your daughters were comin to your town  
Better pray were not around  
  
Let the beast run wild  
  
Chorus
