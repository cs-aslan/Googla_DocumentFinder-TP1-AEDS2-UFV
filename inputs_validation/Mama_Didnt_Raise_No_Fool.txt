The best of times the worst of times  
The times you cant ignore  
Sometimes you bite the bullet  
And flip flop on the floor  
  
They tell you where to go  
And they tell you what to do  
They set your face on fire  
Then stomp it out with their shoes  
  
I aint no fool  
Mama didnt raise no fool  
  
The times I cant complain  
Are the times I do the most  
On a diet of black coffee  
And prozac buttered toast  
  
These eunuchs in their prada  
And Gucci flavored clothes  
Wouldnt know a fresh perspective  
If it bit em up on the nose  
  
I aint no fool  
Mama didnt raise no fool  
  
Dont do as they say  
Just say as they do  
No flavors quite so bitter  
As the taste of ones own shoe  
  
I aint no fool  
Mama didnt raise no fool
