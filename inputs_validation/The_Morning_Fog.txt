The light  
Begin to bleed  
Begin to breathe  
Begin to speak  
Dyou know what  
I love you better now  
  
I am falling  
Like a stone  
Like a storm  
Being born again  
Into the sweet morning fog  
Dyou know what  
I love you better now  
  
Im falling  
And Id love to hold you know  
Ill kiss the ground  
Ill tell my mother  
Ill tell my father  
Ill tell my loved one  
Ill tell my brothers  
How much I love them
