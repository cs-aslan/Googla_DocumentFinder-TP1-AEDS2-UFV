Well Im out on the road and the devils got my soul  
And Im looking for the Lord in New York City  
  
Yeah Im out on the run got some heat got a gun  
If they dont find me soon itll be a damn pity  
  
So its  
  
Chorus  
  
Goodbye girl goodbye girl girl goodbye  
Its so hard to see the truth with the sun in your eyes  
Goodbye girl goodbye girl girl goodbye  
Must be in the way that she cries must be in the way that she cries  
Must be in the way that she cries  
  
Oh theres smoke in the air and theres blood everywhere  
But Im hoping that the white man dont recognize me  
  
Im so sorry what Ive done and I say it not in fun  
When I tell you that theres no one left inside me  
  
And its  
  
So its
