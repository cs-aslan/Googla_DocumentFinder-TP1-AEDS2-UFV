Back in the days of the 33 and 45  
First time I remember feelin alive  
Playin like aringin a bell n I learned it off the radio  
Sure it was only mamas broom but I was strummin like a fool  
A true believer till the day I die  
If youd a plugged me in in front of all my friends  
I woulda set the livin room on fire  
I was alive  
Alive n Kickin  
Like a time bomb tickin  
Headed for the Hullaballoo  
There were no big gigs in sight  
No bright whitehot spotlight  
But everybody knew that I was Alive n Kickin  
Got in a battle of the bands when I stole my big brothers guitar  
Let me tell you thatll never get you far  
2000 Overnights later n Im still not on the radio  
Got a new Best Friend  
He was more than Sittin In  
N we were makin our mark on the road  
Our regaliad hit Full Sail  
N we were trapped into the Mother Lode  
We was alive  
Alive n Kickin  
Like a timebomb tickin  
On the cover of the Rollin Stone  
As far as we could see  
It was the way it was meant to be  
The whole world knew that we was  
Alive n Kickin  
Its been miles n miles  
Still Alive  
And pickin  
Now Im in the daze of the downloadin digital fights  
Bit by bit byte by byte  
But everybody says its music cause they hear it on the radio  
N when I hit the stage Im gonna rattle your cage  
I still remember how to howl at the moon  
And I can carry the load whether Im on the road  
Or jus appearing in my living room  
Cause I am alive  
Alive n Kickin  
Like a timebomb tickin  
This boys ready to blow  
Dont need to tell you why  
Im gonna love to do it til the day I die  
Everybodys gonna know that I  
Am Alive n Kickin  
We been rockin since 73  
And just between you n me  
You better believe that we  
Are alive  
Alive n Kickin
