Oh so my love  
This sleeping pill  
Will watch you through the night  
And come dawn  
Ill be long long gone  
I tried I tried I tried  
I Tried i Tried  
We feed upon the broken branch  
We kiss the stars goodbye  
For the sun cant fight this overcast  
I tried I tried I tried  
I Tried i Tried  
The spiders web  
It cant break our fall  
I whisper to the sky  
I pray she takes you in her arms  
I tried I tried I tried  
I Tried i Tried  
I Tried  
Storm warning in the sand  
She evaporates beneath my fingernails  
The road is lost underwater  
Shes running down a river with eels  
She is lost to me
