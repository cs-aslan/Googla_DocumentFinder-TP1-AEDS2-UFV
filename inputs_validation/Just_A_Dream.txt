It aint a thang in this world thats gonna knock me off my feet  
As I unleash total chaos into the streets  
For I observe these dirty words whispering through your mouth  
So I now I take it you the big dog about the south  
Oh really now though whose to say that we wont never make it  
Or even get the chance to tell the world just how we made it  
Cause know that we gonna keep it crunk no matter what  
Now who the fuck just al nut its a must for you to get crushed  
So dont rush to get dat change  
Youd besta wake on up and take a look inside this frame  
For everything aint everything when times are gettin rough  
To pressure is your conscience in this game you callin bluff  
Now nigga what yeah  
Oh a lot of hatin went on doing this thang here  
Folks just swore we wasnt finna put it down for the Atown  
You know what Im saying I aint gotta call no names  
Cause you know who you are  
You know what Im sayin  
All I got to say to all of yall is  
You cant keep nobody from the Attic down  
Know what Im sayin and thats on the floor  
Yea its me remember me from back in the day  
The same ol nigga you thought wouldnt get paid  
Look at me now nigga shit done changed  
Aint no mo gettin wet in the rain  
Hennessey and dank to kill all my pain  
Sho nuff you can hear but you cant feel me man  
And its a damn shame we go through what we do  
Playa hatin while Im chillin on the avenue  
Cant hold no nigga down from the Attic Crew  
thats for trill on the blow straight from me to you  
Better listen up now cause aint no tellin whats next  
The dem between real and the ones that flex  
All in your face grinnin when you cash that check  
But when they get down and dirty its like fuck dat bitch  
Ass nigga so how you figga I was wrong  
Got a baby and a crib to keep clothes on  
Long time ago way before the grind  
Trouble had become a friend of mine  
You off up in my head its just a matter of time  
Before I rip shit apart and let Sean Paul shine  
Like dem folks open face off in yo grill  
I aint tryin to be greedy Im just tryin to live  
Now that the picture clear and you know what I mean  
Being broke all again slick its just a dream
