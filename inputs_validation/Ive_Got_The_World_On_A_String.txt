Ive got the world on a string  
Im sittin on a rainbow  
Got a string around my finger  
What a world what a life Im in love  
  
Ive got a song that I sing  
I can make the rain go  
Any time I move my finger  
Look at me cant you see Im in love  
  
Life is a beautiful thing  
As long as I hold the string  
Id be a silly soandso  
If I should ever let you go

Life is a beautiful thing  
As long as I hold the string  
Id be a silly soandso  
If I should ever let you go yes  
  
Ive got the world on a string  
Im sittin on a rainbow  
Got a string around my finger  
What a world  
And this is the life hey now  
Im so in love
