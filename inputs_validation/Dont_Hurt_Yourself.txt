Therell come a time when all of this is over  
Something else will grow and take its place  
The brand new carscrap metal in a junkyard  
The children playing will grow up and leave home  
  
Put it away this dream you cant stop dreaming  
Put it away this anger and desire  
The open road is infinitely hopeful  
Take all those memories and throw them in the fire  
  
And dont hurt yourself  
Dont hurt yourself  
Dont hurt yourself anymore  
  
Theres old man on a warm and sunny island  
No job no money just a smile to call his own  
Know what he says The past will only haunt you  
Live for today Each days an open door  
  
Dont hurt yourself  
Dont hurt yourself  
Dont hurt yourself anymore  
  
Nothing to lose is nothing to fight over  
The shining stars  
Theyve seen it all before  
  
Dont hurt yourself  
Dont hurt yourself  
Dont hurt yourself anymore  
  
Dust keeps coming Rust keeps coming Weeds keep growing Seeds keep growing  
Where you going
