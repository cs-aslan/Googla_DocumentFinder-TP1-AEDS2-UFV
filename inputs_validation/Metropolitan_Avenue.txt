Noel Brazil  
First Days in the loft I thought I might live new faces  
New streets  
No cash in the hand was making me thing what now Whats  
Next  
Thats not to say I wasnt welcomed I was welcomed I was  
Taken in  
I took the bait when I was hunted I was wretched I was  
Freezing  
  
Chorus  
  
Metropolitan ave standing tall in the winter snow Ill  
Be back with you before I go  
Dont run like a dog I know how it feels without heat  
Without love  
Ran free in the park like Jekyll and Hyde me and Pete  
Me and Pete  
Up half the night unwilling witness to some strangers  
Feud  
Deep underground I hear the notes of some old gamblers  
Blues  
  
Metropolitan etc  
This rose will never blossom now it needs light shining  
On its back  
This road will never take me out Ive been stopped in  
My tracks  
There goes the night and now the sun begins to filter  
Through  
I took the bait when I was hunted I was wretched didnt  
Know that I was failing you  
  
Metropolitan etc
