Over the moor take me to the moor  
Dig a shallow grave  
And Ill lay me down  
  
Over the moor take me to the moor  
Dig a shallow grave  
And Ill lay me down  
  
LesleyAnne with your pretty white beads  
Oh John youll never be a man  
And youll never see your home again  
Oh Manchester so much to answer for  
  
Edward see those alluring lights   
Tonight will be your very last night  
  
A woman said  I know my son is dead  
Ill never rest my hands on his sacred head  
  
Hindley wakes and Hindley says   
Hindley wakes Hindley wakes Hindley wakes and says   
Oh wherever he has gone I have gone  
  
But fresh lilaced moorland fields  
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death  
Fresh lilaced moorland fields  
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death  
  
Hindley wakes and says   
Hindley wakes Hindley wakes Hindley wakes and says   
Oh whatever he has done I have done  
  
But this is no easy ride  
For a child cries   
  
Oh find mefind me nothing more  
We are on a sullen misty moor  
We may be dead and we may be gone  
But we will be we will be we will be right by your side  
Until the day you die  
This is no easy ride  
We will haunt you when you laugh  
Yes you could say were a team  
You might sleep  
You might sleep  
You might sleep  
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM   
Oh you might sleep  
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM   
You might sleep  
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM   
  
Oh Manchester so much to answer for  
Oh Manchester so much to answer for  
  
Oh find me find me   
Find me   
Ill haunt you when you laugh  
Oh Ill haunt you when you laugh  
You might sleep  
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM   
Oh  
Over the moors Im on the moor  
Oh over the moor  
Oh the child is on the moor
