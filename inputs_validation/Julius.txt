Danger  
Ive been told to expect it  
I begin my descent  
Down the cold granite steps  
  
And who could have turned among those I confide in  
I think that I know what I havent known yet  
Cause a week is a month  
and an hour a day  
When your reaching just pushes it further away  
With your past and your future precisely divided  
Am I at that moment  
I havent decided  
  
And stretching out into the sea Aquitana  
Is that what the prophet told me he saw  
You gave it to me but I really dont want it  
I came out on top by the luck of the draw  
Cause a week is a month and an hour a day  
When your reaching just pushes it further away  
And whats the return on the faith Ive provided  
I think that I know now but I havent decided
