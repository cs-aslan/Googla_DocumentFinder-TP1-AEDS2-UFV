I know youre goin  
I know this is goodbye  
And I cant make you stay  
No matter no matter how I try  
But ooh if youre leaving  
Please grant this one request  
And leave my heart with some happiness  
  
If this is the last kiss  
Lets make it last all night  
If this is the last time Im ever ever gonna bold you  
Let me hold you tight till the morning light  
  
  
If this is the last time  
Ooh well ever be together  
Kiss me and baby give me something  
Tender to remember you by  
  
  
If I cant be with you  
Oh baby all my life  
The next best thing  
Is you next to me all through the night  
  
  
Pull all the shades down  
Put your heart next to mine  
Tonight give me a chance  
To feel heaven just one more time  
And ooh if youre leaving  
Honey Ill set you free  
Just leave my arms this one sweet memory  
  
  
If this is the last kiss  
Lets make it last all night  
If this is the last time Im ever ever gonna hold you  
Let me hold you tight till the morning light  
  
  
If this is the last time  
Ooh well ever be together  
Kiss me and baby give me something  
Tender to remember you by  
  
  
If I cant be with you  
Ooh baby all my life  
The next best thing  
Is you next to me all through the night  
  
  
If this is the last kiss  
Lets make it last all night  
If this is the last time Im ever ever gonna hold you  
Let me hold you tight till the morning light  
  
  
If this is the last time  
Ooh well ever be together  
Kiss me and baby give me something  
Tender to remember you by  
Kiss me and baby give me something  
Tender to remember you by  
Baby give me something tender to remember you by
