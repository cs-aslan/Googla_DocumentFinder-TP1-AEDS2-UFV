Violent J  
And they wanted to know if I would trade 10 juggalos for a 100 main stream
fans And I said I wouldnt trade 10 juggalos for a 100 000 mainstream fans 10
juggalos is priceless to me  
Blaze Ya Dead Homie  
I gots love for my homies members of the Lotus  
United we stand squashing all deadly forces  
Been to hell could of spent eternity there  
All the bad shit Ive done I should still be there  
Juggalos can ya feel me feel me worldwide worldwide  
Running with the hatchet straight out the Lotus Pod  
Always got your back till the end screaming juggalos  
Dark lotus psychopathic thats the way you go  
Monoxide Child  
So many people in the matrix die alone hey  
Not me my soul belongs to juggalos they  
Keep me going when Im down and out  
I pick the phone up drop them a line and here them shout  
Saying Twiztid is the shit and Im down with the clown  
Dark Lotus for life until Im dead in the ground  
I give a dap to all my homies and killaz who get it started  
All my juggalos always represent for the departed  
Chorus  
Mass murder makes me happy  
Dead bodies make me happy  
Say what you will of me  
Ill always have juggalo family  
Mass murder makes me happy  
Dead bodies make me happy  
Say what you will of me  
Ill always have juggalo family  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
6 individual pedals formed from 1 stem  
Who try to run away and not follow any trends no friends  
Cause we accend from the dirt filth grit and grime  
And combine Juggalo minds to crush Mason shrines  
Whats yours is mine it was mines is yours  
Let the wagons of the Dark Carnival show you different worlds  
Any hoes front a juggalos or the hatchet  
Tell them to come suck on your dick we psychopathic  
Jamie Madrox  
All my life Ive been living it all alone  
Im like a king with no people and no crown or a throne  
And what Im speaking on is what Im feeling like  
Do you know what it feels like to feel the warmth of the sunlight  
Id really like to know cause Ive been chilling in the dark  
For so many years that I question love in my heart  
And I hate everyone and I hate everything  
Except for all the juggalos and the love that they bring  
Chorus  
Marz  
Let me get your ear and make myself clear  
Its the L Family Juggalos right here  
You can take away my mic you can take away this life  
But this love we got aint never gonna stop  
We eternal pass the earthly bullshit  
Dogs on another level can you feel this  
Its Twisted Blaze and icp  
And if youre fuckin with my dogs then you DIE  
Violent J  
If it wasnt for Shaggy my shirt would still be baggy  
I wouldnt be fat Id still be hungry and crabby  
We used to buy our own records at the stores  
So they would think its a hot seller and order more  
But we built a team of same killers with the same dream  
But we couldnt reach the top wed stay B level like Charlie Sheen  
Finally realized we will always have the juggalos  
Ill never give another second to them other hoes  
Chorus x3  
Lotus  
Lotus Lotus Lotus Lotus  
And they wanted to know if I would trade 10 juggalos for a 100 main stream
fans And I said I wouldnt trade 10 juggalos for a 100 000 mainstream fans 10
juggalos is priceless to me  
Chorus x2 repeats and fades out until song ends
