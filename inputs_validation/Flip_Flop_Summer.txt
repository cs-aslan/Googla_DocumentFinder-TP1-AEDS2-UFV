Sprins sprung the suns up and shinin  
Schools out and everyones smilin  
Lets pop the top off and lie for a while  
And some take it easy days  
  
Lets tell that old grind where to stick it  
Put the rest of the stress in there with it  
Dont you think weve had enough  
Its time to get away  
  
Its gonna be another flip flop summer  
Kick off your shoes and call up your lover  
Say hey baby the winter is over  
Lets head south awhile  
Were going to take us a long vacation  
Mix us up some strong libations  
No worries just good vibrations  
And lazy days in style  
Its a flip flop summer Its a flip flop summer  
  
Put your coat away in the closet  
You wont need it baby  
Because its a clear blue sky  
And the weatherman says it looks that way for weeks  
Baby well cruise down to Montigo  
Raise us a glass as we pass Puerto Rico  
It dont matter cause wherever we go  
Its where its good to be  
  
Its gonna be another flip flop summer  
Kick off your shoes and call up your lover  
Say hey baby the winter is over  
Lets head south awhile  
Were going to take us a long vacation  
Mix us up some strong libations  
No worries just good vibrations  
And lazy days in style  
Its a flip flop summer Its a flip flop summer  
  
Lets sail away where no problems can find us  
Weve got 90 days  
To watch that ole Tequila sun rise  
And leave all our troubles behind us  
  
Its gonna be another flip flop summer  
Kick off your shoes and call up your lover  
Say hey baby the winter is over  
Lets head south awhile  
Were going to take us a long vacation  
Mix us up some strong libations  
No worries just good vibrations  
And lazy days in style  
Its a flip flop summer Its a flip flop summer  
  
Its a flip flop summer
