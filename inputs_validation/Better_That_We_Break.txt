I never knew perfection till  
I heard you speak and now it kills me  
Just to hear you say the simple things  
Now waking up is hard to do  
And sleepings impossible too  
Everything is reminding me of you  
What can I do  
  
Chorus  
Its not right not okay  
Say the word that you say  
Maybe were better off this way  
Im not fine Im in pain  
Its harder everyday  
Maybe were better off this way  
Its better that we break  
  
A fool to let you slip away  
I chase you just to hear you say  
Youre scared and that you think that Im insane  
  
The city looks so nice from here  
Pity I cant see it clearly  
While youre standing there it disappears  
It disappears  
  
Chorus  
  
Saw you sitting all alone  
Youre fragile and youre cold  
But thats all right  
Life these days is getting rough  
Theyve knocked you down and beat you up  
But its just a roller coaster anyway yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Im not fine not okay  
Say the word that you say  
Maybe were better off this way  
  
Im not fine and Im in pain  
Its harder everyday  
Maybe were better off this way  
Its better that we break baby
