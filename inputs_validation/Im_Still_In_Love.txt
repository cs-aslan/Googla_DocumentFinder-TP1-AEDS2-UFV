Youve been livin with your broken heart  
Ive been trying hard to play the part  
But some pretender with an easy smile  
Can tell you its alright  
  
I aint got nothin if you leave me now  
Just a hypocrite with broken vows  
If I could change the way of circumstance  
Id do it just for you  
  
Im still in love  
Im still in love  
Im these days still in love I find  
Im still in love  
  
Ive been staring in an empty glass  
In a downtown bar thinking about the past  
Im spinning round you like a moth in flames  
But I still cant help myself  
  
And should you tell me  
That youve changed your mind  
Made some decisions  
Gonna cross that line  
  
I can always be available  
Cause time is on my side  
Im still in love  
Im still in love  
  
Im these days still in love I find  
Im still in love with you  
Time will tell the truth for us  
It can only make us strong  
  
Itll be alright  
Im still in love  
Im still in love  
Im these days still in love I find  
  
Im still in love with you  
Im in your eyes still in love in my mind  
Im still in love with you  
Im these days still in love I find  
  
Im still in love with you  
Im cant you see me falling still in love  
Im still in love with you  
Im these days still in love I find  
  
Im still in love with you  
Im cant you see me falling still in love  
Im still in love with you
