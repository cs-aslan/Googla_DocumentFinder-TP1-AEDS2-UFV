Please dont ask me how I feel I feel fine  
Oh I cry a bit dont sleep too good but Im fine  
When can I see you  
When can I see you  
  
Again and again I ask myself was I wrong  
Oh but times a healer and heaven knows Ive been strong  
Maybe we could try  
Maybe we could work this time  
  
I can remember when it was easy to say I love you  
But things have changed since then now I really cant say if I still do  
  
But I can try  
I know that the kids are well youre a mother to the world  
But I miss my boy  
I hope hes good as gold  
  
But enough of me tell me how are you You look good  
Oh youve lost weight I can see your hair looks nice you look good  
Maybe we should try dont say it I know why  
  
I can remember when it was easy to say I love you  
But things have changed since then now I really cant say if I still do  
  
But I can try  
I know that the kids are well youre a mother to the world  
But I miss my boy  
I hope hes good as gold
