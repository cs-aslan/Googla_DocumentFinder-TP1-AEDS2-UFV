I like walking in the park  
When it gets late at night  
I move round in the dark  
And leave when it gets light  
I sit around by day  
Tied up in chains so tight  
These crazy words of mine  
So wrong they could be right  
What do I get out of this  
I always try I always miss  
One of these days youll go back to your home  
You wont even notice that you are alone  
One of these days when you sit by yourself  
Youll realize you cant shaft without someone else  
In the end you will submit  
Its got to hurt a little bit  
  
I like talking in my sleep  
When people work so hard  
They need what they cant keep  
A choice that leaves them scarred  
A room without a view  
Unveils the truth so soon  
And when the sun goes down  
Youve lost what you had  
What do I get out of this  
I always try I always miss  
One of these days youll go back to your home  
You wont even notice that you are alone  
One of these days when you sit by yourself  
Youll realise you cant shaft without someone else  
In the end you will submit  
Its got to hurt a little bit
