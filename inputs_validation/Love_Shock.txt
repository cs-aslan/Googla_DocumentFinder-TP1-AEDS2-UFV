Meet me at the station about a quarter past five  
Thats about the time that I come alive yeah  
Dont make sense if it aint the real thing whyall  
Nothing but the real thing makes my bell ring  
  
Love me baby wont you love me please  
You got me down here on my knees yeah  
Im so glad that Im still alive  
Come on baby wont you make me feel good now  
  
Come on baby now dont be too slow  
Now Im in a hurry you know I got to go  
Dont make sense if you dont know how to move  
Im a natural born lover I was born in a groove yeah  
Oooh  
  
Its Jumpin Jack Flash on the drums
