She calls out to the man on the street  
Sir can you help me  
Its cold and Ive nowhere to sleep  
Is there somewhere you can tell me  
  
He walks on doesnt look back  
He pretends he cant hear her  
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street  
Seems embarrassed to be there  
  
Oh think twice its another day for you and me in paradise  
Oh think twice cause its just another day for you  
You and me in paradise think about it  
  
She calls out to the man on the street  
He can see shes been crying  
Shes got blisters on the soles of her feet  
She cant walk but shes trying  
  
Oh think twice cause its another day for you and me in paradise  
Oh think twice its just another day for you  
You and me in paradise think about it  
  
Oh Lord is there nothing more anybody can do  
Oh Lord there must be something you can say  
  
You can tell from the lines on her face  
You can see that shes been there  
Probably been moved on from every place  
Cause she didnt fit in there  
  
Oh think twice cause its another day for you and me in paradise  
Oh think twice its just another day for you  
You and me in paradise just think about it think about it  
  
Its just another day for you and me in paradise  
Its just another day for you and me in paradise paradise  
Just think about it paradise just think about it  
Paradise paradise paradise
