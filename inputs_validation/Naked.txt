So you want me to take it off  
Just to see whats  
Underneath my cloth  
Ill show you Im every  
Inch a man  
Measure all that you  
Think you can  
  
Im more than what  
Meets the eye  
Flesh n blood is  
Often a white lie  
By the cover you misjudge  
The book  
Open your mind and take  
Another look  
  
Chorus  
Naked and Im unashamed  
Naked with no one to blame  
Naked ya you want the truth  
Naked heres my birthday suit  
Naked naked naked naked  
  
I pretend to be not anyone  
Except me and my imperfections  
There is nothing I  
Expect of you  
That you wouldnt  
Expect of me too  
  
Chorus  
  
Will you excuse me for my ignorance  
Cause I can see only one  
Difference  
Those of you who seek to find  
While all the others choose  
To walk n talk blind
