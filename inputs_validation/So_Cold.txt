Chours  
So cold  
So cold  
Bringing back all the memories of winter  
Remembering when we were little  
Playin in the snow and fighting all day yea yeaChours ends  
I remember making snow man on the snowy days  
I remember everything  
And i wont forget my best friends  
Chours  
Its so cold  
So cold  
To think about my life  
But ill never forget my best friends  
Chours  
So cold  
So cold  
Remember when we were little  
Playin in the snow and fighting all day yea yea  
So cold  
So cold  
Remembering when we were little  
Playin in the snow and fighting all day yea yea  
Itsd so cold  
So cold  
To think about my days
