One day without you  
And I feel just like Im somebody else  
One day without you  
And theres a fear there might be somebody else  
You know Id like to keep you  
Keep you to myself and by my side  
You know Id like to keep you  
Just like I know its wrong to try  
Just like my baby is born to cry  
Every bird that sings is born to fly  
One day without you  
And I feel just like some lost ship at sea  
One day without you  
And every friend I meet seems strange  
You know that Id like to keep you  
Keep you to myself and by my side  
You know Id like to keep you  
Just like I know its wrong to try  
Just like my baby is born to cry  
Every bird that sings is born to fly  
One day without you  
I feel a hole just where my heart should be  
One day without you  
And I feel just how sad my life could be  
You know Id like to keep you  
Keep you to myself keep by my side  
You know Id like to keep you  
Just like I know its wrong to try  
Just like my baby is born to cry  
Every bird that sings deserves to fly
