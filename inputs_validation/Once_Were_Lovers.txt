We shared a life we shared a heart  
But what we united seems to be breaking apart  
Its a haunting pain goes right to the core  
Now were dividing whats mine from whats yours  
  
Ill keep the same old things I had when we met  
And youll keep whats yours cause that would only be fair  
But what about the heart that we both created together  
  
Chorus  
We used to be the toast of the town  
We used to have the best love of all  
We had blue skies but they came falling down  
What happened to us  
  
You and I once were lovers  
No cheating hearts and no one did wrong  
So why did we break cant say our love wasnt strong  
But I know with time things that start to mend  
  
So lets fix these hearts so they cant be broken again  
You need a man who sees how lonely youve been  
dont worry I will start all over and then  
We will get back the heart that we both created together  
  
CHORUS  
  
Last night I cried but girl you were not here  
So it was just a big waste of tears  
But then I smiled I heard your voice in my ear  
Tellin me you wish it could be like it was in the beginning  
  
Chorus
