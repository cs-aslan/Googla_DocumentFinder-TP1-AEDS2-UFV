Chorus  
Racked up shawty racked up shawty  
All these bitches call me racked up shawty x2  
  
Meek Mill  
Racks all on my wrist racks all on my neck  
I spend racks all on my bitch look at these racks all on my check  
Nigga Im racked up and Im racked out fuck a bitch til she tap out  
Fuck a bitch then I pass out and my pockets all in Jay Stack house  
Cus I balled hard Im swag out all black Maybachs out  
Ya niggas just spit shit and I live the shit that I rap bout  
See these racks came from my crack house dirty money like diddy  
Hammers niggas aint never seen got 30 off in that 50  
Now tell them hoes that Im busy tell them hoes that Im ballin
