Aint a day goes by I dont burn a little bit of my soul  
Aint a day goes by I dont burn a little bit of my soul  
Scored some friends along the way  
Did what I did said what I had to say  
And Id do it all again if I had to today  
When all is said and done  
Im the one  
Its a long hard road when your friends start to leave you behind  
Its a long hard road when you try to find peace of mind  
Some might go for poison  
And some go for too much stuff  
Some just go to sleep at night  
And forget to wake up  
Cocaine eyes  
Cant hide your face  
Its no surprise  
You lose the race  
Again  
Aint a day goes by I dont burn a little bit of my soul  
Aint a day goes by I dont burn a little bit of my soul  
Scored some friends along the way  
Did what I did said what I had to say  
And Id do it all again if I had to today  
Cause when all is said and done  
Im the one  
Im the one yeah  
Cocaine eyes  
It wont hide your face  
Its no surprise  
You lost the race  
Once again  
My old friend
