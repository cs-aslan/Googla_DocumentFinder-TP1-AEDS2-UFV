Verse 1  
Ive got to get out of here  
This towns no longer fun  
And Im falling closer falling closer  
Closer to the sun  
Ive got to get out of here  
Come kiss another face  
Cause it hurts too bad it hurts too bad  
And I dont like the taste  
  
PreChorus  
You say its over leaving me so far from sober  
Now sun is colder I lean on a strangers shoulder  
I walk the streets and there are beats and cities smoulder  
Without a trace Im under  
  
Chorus  
And God knows I try  
Looking for lovers at night  
But each time I do  
It only reminds me of you  
It only reminds me of you  
  
Verse 2  
Ive got to get out of here  
Cause you never want me back  
You are moving on moving on  
And Im stuck on the track  
Ive gotta get out of here  
Before I selfdestruct  
And I dont want I dont want  
My heart to ever stop  
  
PreChorus  
I walk the streets and there are beats and cities smoulder  
Without a trace Im under  
  
Chorus  
And God knows I try  
Looking for lovers at night  
But each time I do  
It only reminds me of you  
It only reminds me of you  
  
And God knows I try  
Looking for lovers at night  
But each time I do  
It only reminds me of you  
It only reminds me of you
