Lonely lonely lonely child crystalline and lace  
Wont you walk me awhile put a smile upon my face  
I dont want to take your love in vain  
Gonna keep on coming back again  
Beauty leads the full grown child a rose among the thorns  
Like a ray of sunshine she comes heaven in my arms  
I dont want to take your love in vain  
Gonna keep on coming back again  
  
When i see you smilin  
It takes away my pain  
Oh theres no denyin  
Cant keep away from the flame  
  
A thousand indian summers die in desert sands  
The moon and lovers shadows they go slippin through our hands  
I dont want to take your love in vain  
Gonna keep on coming back again  
  
I dont want to take your love in vain  
Gonna keep on coming back again
