Long Dark Road  
The Hollies  
Tony Hicks  Kenny Lynch  
  
Its over well over  
In my mind and in my heart  
Its over well over  
But then again it didnt have a good start  
Youd tell me try to sell me  
It could have been all I asked  
Its over well over  
Yes there it flows away a distant past  
Now its a long dark road  
Yes its a long dark road  
And you know I loved you  
Yes you know I loved you  
Now its a long dark road  
Yes its a long dark road  
And you know I loved you  
Yes you know I loved you  
Its over well over  
And we cant revive whats passed  
Its gone now moved on now  
But then again it didnt have a chance to last  
No no no a chance to last  
Now its a long dark road  
Yes its a long dark road  
Now its a long dark road  
Yes its a long dark road  
Now its a long dark road  
Yes its a long dark road  
Now its a long dark road  
Yes its a long dark road  
Now its a long dark road  
Yes its a long dark road
