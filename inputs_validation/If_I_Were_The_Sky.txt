When I wake up in the morning  
Theres something on my mind  
And suddenly without warning  
Somebodys standing behind  
And its you  babe  
And its you  babe  
  
If I were the sky  I could look down onto you  
That one day  if you join me  evry sky will be blue  
Evry day with you  
  
You know I still think you owe me  
I dream evry night that you do  
So what is it thats making me lonely  
Ive known all along what it is  
And its you  babe  
And its you  babe  
  
If I were the sky  I could look down onto you  
That one day  if you join me  evry sky will be blue  
Evry day with you  
  
If I were the sky  I could look down onto you  
That one day  if you join me  evry sky will be blue  
Evry day with you  
With you  
With you
