Lost boys and golden girls  
Down on the corner and all around the world  
Lost boys and golden girls  
Down on the corner and all around all around the world  
  
It doesnt matter where theyre going  
Or wherever theyve been  
Cause theyve got one thing in common its true  
Theyll never let a night like tonight go to waste  
  
And let me tell ya something neither will you  
Neither will you  
Neither will you  
  
Weve gotta fast we were born out of time  
Born out of time and alone  
And well never be as young as we are right now  
Runnin away and runnin for home  
Runnin for home  
  
It doesnt matter where theyre going  
Or wherever theyve been  
Cause theyve got one thing in common its true  
Theyll never let a night like tonight go to waste  
And let me tell ya something neither will you  
  
Neither will you  
Neither will you  
Neither will you  
  
Lost boys and golden girls  
Down on the corner and all around the world  
Lost boys and golden girls  
Down on the corner and all around and all around the world
