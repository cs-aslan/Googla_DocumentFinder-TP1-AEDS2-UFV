Sled dogs after dinner  
Close their eyes on  
The howlin wastes  
Kurt Cobain reincarnated  
Sighs and licks his face  
Then they drift past strips  
Of Serengeti and the gates  
Of Sleepy Hollow too  
You can pause in wonder  
They paused in wonder and  
Yea I paused in wonder too  
Just dont wake daddy  
  
They can lay their heads  
On their futonbeds  
So many miles from home  
You can teach your children  
Some fashion sense and they  
Fashion some of their own  
For when the policyweary  
Commune on the untamed land  
Through white sheers  
Whispers in their ears  
Youre damned  
And dont wake daddy  
  
You can stuff yer void  
With the asteroid  
Thats hurtlin toward the earth  
You can drop the bomb  
That restores some calm  
Then promises rebirth  
Just dont wake daddy  
  
Its the perfect time now  
For an eclectic choice  
Theyre all asleep but us now  
Its time to hear your voice  
  
Sing to end all songs  
To end all songs
