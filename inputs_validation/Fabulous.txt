I dont need to tell ya what you already know  
Youre the one with style youre the whole darn show  
The other guys play their instruments fine  
But next to you their looks are a crime  
  
Well they say true beauty it comes from within  
But your have to be comfortable in your own skin  
So I exfoliate with this exotic cream  
Just look at me I look like a dream  
  
Youre the one yes youre the star  
We need you back on bass guitar  
Youre Fabulous Im Fabulous   
Youre Fabulous Im fabulous   
Youre the one we all can see its all about you its all about me   
Youre Fabulous Im Fabulous   
Youre fabulous Im Fabulous   
  
Now no two people are like each other  
So dont be a lookalike copying another  
Unless of course youre copying me  
Because that gives you individuality  
  
Nice do But back to the matter at hand  
So what do you say  
Are you back in the band  
  
Well maybe if I can fine my old leather  
Dude Were gettin the band back together  
  
Youre the one who sets the bar  
Your hairdo king the fashion Tsar  
Youre fabulous Im fabulous  
Youre fabulous ooh Im fabulous  
Youre the one we all can see its all about you  
Its all about me   
Youre Fabulous Im Fabulous  
Youre Fabulous Im Fabulous
