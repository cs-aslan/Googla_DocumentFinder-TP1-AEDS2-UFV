Ive ridden down the sunset  
Drank expensive wine  
Ive been married two dozen times  
Raised ten children on a workmans pay  
And Im glad to say Ive enjoyed every day  
Of the full catastrophe of life  
  
Ive sat in courtrooms  
Had people call me names  
Ive been to London town  
On a supersonic plane  
I was lovin your wife  
While you were lovin mine  
And Im glad to say Ive enjoyed every day  
Of the full catastrophe of life  
  
Ive opened my belt to trouble everyday  
Aint looking for a fight  
But you know I wont run away  
From the full catastrophe of life  
  
Ive seen the goodness  
Ive known the baddest around  
I was tattooed when it first came out  
I shook the hand that showed Moses the way  
And Im glad to say Ive enjoyed every day  
Of the full catastrophe of life
