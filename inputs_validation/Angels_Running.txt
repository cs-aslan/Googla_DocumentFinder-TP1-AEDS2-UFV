Well I heard enough  
And Ive seen enough  
And I know enough to know  
I know a good thing when I see it  
And its a bad thing to let go  
  
Well Ive been around  
Ive been up and down  
Until I bailed out of control  
With your world all in motion  
Gonna put a ball  
And chain on your soul  
  
All those angels running  
Picking up the pieces  
Putting hearts together  
Broke long ago  
I know a good thing when I see it  
And its a bad thing to let go  
  
Well always be lovers  
With borders of there own  
And you may charge across  
In a golden chariot  
But you will never be at home  
  
Cause I had dreams  
Like distant thunder  
I had hope like a prayer unheard  
This nothing less than perfect  
In a less than perfect world  
  
All those angles running  
Picking up the pieces  
Putting back together  
Hearts broke long ago  
I know a good thing when I see it  
And its a bad thing to let go  
Its a bad thing to let go  
Its a bad thing
