Caught under the starry night  
Breathing in everything but air  
See as the fire light  
Dies in your eyes  
Oh youre leaving  
  
Love screaming  
I will be the end of you  
And Im pleading  
Dont you stop now  
Go on and tear me apart  
Show me all that youve got  
And I will be so free  
  
Hear the cries of the stormy skies  
Letting go of all that she has held in  
Waiting for that shadow to smile  
And realize youre not winning me  
  
Love screaming  
I will be the end of you  
And Im pleading  
Dont you stop now  
Go on and tear me apart  
Show me all that youve got  
We will be so free  
  
Love screaming  
I will be the end of you  
And Im pleading  
Dont you stop now  
Go on and tear me apart  
Show me all that youve got  
We will be so free  
Free from all that has been  
So free from all that weve seen  
So free
