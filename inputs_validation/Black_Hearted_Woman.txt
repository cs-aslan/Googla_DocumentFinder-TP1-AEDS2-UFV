Black hearted woman cant you see your poor man dyin  
Cant count on both hands babe all the lonely nights Ive been cryin  
Well Im tired of all your slippery ways I cant take your evil lyin

Black hearted woman cheap trouble and pain is all you play  
Black hearted woman cheap trouble and pain is all you play  
Some time thinking Ill be much better if I was stiff down in my grave

Yesterday I was your man now you dont know my name  
Yesterday I was your man now you dont know my name  
Well Im going out to find a new way babe oh to get back into your game

One of these days Im gonna catch you with your back door man  
One of these days yeah Im gonna catch you with your back door man
