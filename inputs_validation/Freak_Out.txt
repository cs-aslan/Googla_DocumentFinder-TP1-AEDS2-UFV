Try to tell me what I shouldnt do  
You should know by now I wont listen to you  
Walk around with my hands up in the air  
Cause I dont care  
  
Cause Im alright Im fine  
  
Just freak out let it go  
  
Im gonna live my life  
I cant ever run and hide I wont compromise cause Ill never know  
Im gonna close my eyes  
I cant watch the time go by  
I wont keep it inside  
Freak out let it go  
Just freak out let it go  
  
Do you always have to do everything right  
Stand up for yourself  
And put up a fight  
Walk around with your hands up in the air  
Like you dont care  
  
Cause Im alright Im fine  
  
Just freak out let it go  
Im gonna live my life  
I cant ever run and hide I wont compromise cause Ill never know  
Im gonna close my eyes  
I cant watch the time go by  
I wont keep it inside  
Freak out let it go  
  
On my own  
Let it go  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Just let me live my life  
I cant ever run and hide I wont compromise cause Ill never know  
Im gonna close my eyes  
I cant watch the time go by  
  
I wont keep it inside  
Freak out let it go  
Just freak out let it go  
Gonna freak out let it go
