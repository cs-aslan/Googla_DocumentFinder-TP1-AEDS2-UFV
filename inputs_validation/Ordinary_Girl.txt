Chorus  
Just an ordinary girl inside my head  
Cant help thinking about all the things she said  
She said good girls are just like bad girls  
If shes a bad girl then makes her a good girl  
Just an ordinary girl inside my head  
  
Im in the club in love with this girl thats been dancing for me  
I know she likes cause she tells me she dont want my money  
I think shes special yow Im certain shes got what I need  
She aint the girl next door but shes perfect for me  
Cause the way she moves the way she smells the way she feels I can tell
it  
 Get out of this shit  
Baby never look back I dont care about the past  
Yeah I know about life what to do with the bad  
Must to Turn right when the day needs right  
  
Chorus  
Just an ordinary girl inside my head  
Cant help thinking about all the things she said  
She said good girls are just like bad girls  
If shes a bad girl then makes her a good girl  
Just an ordinary girl inside my head  
  
Man I went crazy when she hit the floor  
 Everyone wants to know  
Who she is because she want new new in town  
And you can tell by the way she dance she can put it down  
And at this point Im just fantasizing with this girl now  
And my mind is playing tricks on me  
Is ay my mind
