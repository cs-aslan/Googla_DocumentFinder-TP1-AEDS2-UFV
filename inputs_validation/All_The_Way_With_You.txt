Love gives  
Love takes  
It takes a lot of lucky breaks  
Lucky strikes  
Lucky stars  
I dont know how I got this far  
Who knows where its coming from  
Or where its going to  
Can I go all the way with you  
  
You have your way  
You have your doubts  
The falling in  
The falling out  
A bridge is built  
A bridge is burned  
Till you reach the point of no return  
Dont know where were coming from  
Or where were going to  
  
Can I go all the way with you  
Heaven knows that this aint nothing new  
God knows how much I love you  
Love comes  
Love goes  
Can I go all the way with you  
Can I go all the way with you
