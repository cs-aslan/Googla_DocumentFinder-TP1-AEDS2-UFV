Someone I know is staring at me  
And when I look into her eyes  
I see a girl that I used to be  
I hardly recognize  
cause in the space of a year  
Ive watched the old me disappear  
All of the things I once held precious  
Just dont mean anything anymore  
cause suddenly  
  
You came and changed the way I feel  
No one could love you more  
Because you came and turned my life around  
No one could take your place  
  
Ive never felt good with permanent things  
Now I dont want anything to change  
You cant imagine the joy you bring  
My life wont be the same  
And Ill be there when you call  
Ill pick you up if you should fall  
cause I have never felt such inspiration  
Nobody else ever gave me more because  
  
You came and changed the way I feel  
No one could love you more  
Because you came and turned my life around  
No one could take your place  
  
I watch you sleep in the still of the night  
You look so pretty when you dream  
So many people just go through life  
Holding back they dont say what they mean  
But its easy for me  
Since you came  
No one could love you more  
Because you came and turned my life around  
No one could take your place  
You came and changed the way I feel  
No one could love you more  
Because you came and turned my life around  
No one could take your place
