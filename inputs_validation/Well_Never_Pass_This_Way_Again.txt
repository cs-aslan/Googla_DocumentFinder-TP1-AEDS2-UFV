Darling  
While the firelight is low  
Im disappearing  
Like the last day of the snow  
And really its better this way  
We both know its over  
And well never pass this way again  
Sunshine and the desert call to me  
And you know moonshine  
Makes you blind so you cant see at all  
But whatever you feel  
It may not be real  
And baby well never pass this way again  
Im not the only love youll ever know  
Look to your stars above and wish it so  
Let me go  
Darling  
If I stay too long youll tire of me  
cause darling thats the way we are designed to be  
So hard as it is to say  
We had the night and we had our day  
Well never pass this way again
