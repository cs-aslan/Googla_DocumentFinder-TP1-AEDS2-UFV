I want you to uh I want to a  
If you dont mind Carl Id like you to stay out and help us on some songs  
Id love to  
One of the greatest guitar players as well as song writers and singers in
Memphis  
Appreciate a little help on guitar alright Thank you Carl  
  
Wellmy daddy left home when I was three  
And he didnt leave much to ma and me  
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze  
Now I dont blame him cause he run and hid  
But the meanest thing that he ever did  
Was before he left he went and named me Sue  
  
Well he must o thought that is quite a joke  
And it got a lot of laughs from a lots of folk  
It seems I had to fight my whole life through  
Some gal would giggle and Id get red  
And some guyd laugh and Id bust his head  
I tell ya life aint easy for a boy named Sue  
  
Well I grew up quick and I grew up mean  
My fist got hard and my wits got keen  
Id roam from town to town to hide my shame  
But I made a vow to the moon and stars  
That Id search the honkytonks and bars  
And kill that man who gave me that awful name  
  
Well it was Gatlinburg in midJuly  
And I just hit town and my throat was dry  
I thought Id stop and have myself a brew  
At an old saloon on a street of mud  
There at a table dealing stud  
Sat the dirty mangy dog that named me Sue  
  
Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad  
From a wornout picture that my motherd had  
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye  
He was big and bent and gray and old  
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold  
And I said My name is Sue how do you do  
Now youre gonna die  
  
yeah thats what I told him  
  
Well I hit him hard right between the eyes  
And he went down but to my surprise  
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear  
But I busted a chair right across his teeth  
And we crashed through the wall and into the street  
Kicking and a gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer  
  
I tell ya Ive fought tougher men  
But I really cant remember when  
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile  
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss  
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first  
He stood there lookin at me and I saw him smile  
  
And he said Son this world is rough  
And if a mans gonna make it hes gotta be tough  
And I knew I wouldnt be there to help ya along  
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye  
I knew youd have to get tough or die  
And its the name that helped to make you strong  
  
He said Now you just fought one hell of a fight  
And I know you hate me and you got the right  
To kill me now and I wouldnt blame you if you do  
But ya ought to thank me before I die  
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye  
Cause Im the sonofabitch that named you Sue  
  
Well what could I do What could I do  
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun  
And I called him my paw and he called me his son  
And I came away with a different point of view  
And I think about him now and then  
Every time I try and every time I win  
And if I ever have a son I think Im gonna name him  
Bill or George Anydamnthing but Sue  
  
Alright thank you very much
