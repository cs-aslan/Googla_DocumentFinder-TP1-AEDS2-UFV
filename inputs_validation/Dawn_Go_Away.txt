Pretty as a midsummers morn they call her Dawn  
Dawn go away Im no good for you  
Oh Dawn stay with him hell be good to you  
Hang on Hang on to him  
  
Think what a big man hell be  
Think all the places youll see  
Now think what the future would be  
With a poor boy like me  
  
Dawn go away please go away  
Although I know I want you to stay  
Dawn go away please go away  
Baby dont cry its better this way  
  
Oh Dawn go away back where you belong  
Girl we cant change the places  
Where we were born  
Before you say that you want me  
  
I want you to think what your family would say  
Think what youre throwing away  
Now think what the future would be  
With a poor boy like me  
  
Repeat x5  
Dawn go away Im no good for you
