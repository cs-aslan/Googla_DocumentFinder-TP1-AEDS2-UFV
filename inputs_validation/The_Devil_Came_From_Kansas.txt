The Devil came from Kansas Where he went to I cant say  
Though I teach Im not a preacher and I aim to stay that way  
Theres a monkey riding on my back been there for some time  
He says he knows me very well but hes no friend of mine  
  
I am not a humble pilgrim  
Theres no need to scrape and squeeze  
And dont beg for silver paper  
When Im trying to sell you cheese  
  
The Devil came from Kansas Where he went to I cant say  
If you really are my brother then youd better start to pray  
For the sins of those departed and the ones about to go  
Theres a dark cloud just above us dont tell me cause I know  
  
I am not a humble pilgrim  
Theres no need to scrape and squeeze  
And dont beg for silver paper  
When Im trying to sell you cheese  
  
No I never came from Kansas dont forget to thank the cook  
Which reminds me of my duty I was lost and now I look  
For the turning and the signpost and the road which takes you down  
To that pool inside the forest in whose waters I shall drown  
  
I am not a humble pilgrim  
Theres no need to scrape and squeeze  
And dont beg for silver paper  
When Im trying to sell you cheese
