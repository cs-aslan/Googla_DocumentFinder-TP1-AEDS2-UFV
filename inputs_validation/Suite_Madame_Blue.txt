Time after time I sit and I wait for your call  
I know Im a fool but why can I say  
Whatever the price Ill pay for you Madame Blue  
Once long ago a word from your lips and the world turned around  
But somehow youve changed youre so far away  
I long for the past and dream of the days with you Madame Blue  
  
Suite Madame Blue gaze in your looking glass  
Youre not a child anymore  
Suite Madame Blue the future is all but past  
Dressed in your jewels you made your own rules  
You conquered the world and more heavens door  
  
America America America America  
America America America America  
America America America America  
  
Red white and blue gaze in your looking glass  
Youre not a child anymore  
Red white and blue the future is all but past  
So lift up your heart make a new start  
And lead us away from here
