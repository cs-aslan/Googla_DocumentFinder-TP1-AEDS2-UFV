Im so sorry  
That I called you  
Im trying to pick up  
The pieces of my life  
I forgot that we were over  
Tell me what went wrong  
Wrong wrong wrong  
Twelve days four hours twenty minutes  
Im stuck and you know youve got me in it  
Broken glass on the floor from the picture frame  
Shame shame shame  
We had it all  
This love so strong  
Now everything  
We had is gone  
If you could read my mind  
Youd know Ive crossed that line  
  
Cos Im as sick as my secrets  
Yeah its killing me  
You know that I mean it  
I need you next to me  
Theres nowhere to run  
Girl I cant let you go  
And its twisted I know  
But I just cant take it no more  
  
Six miles twelve lights till your front door  
Im on my way just like I have so many times before  
Does he know that its me youve been talking to  
Shame shame shame  
  
If you could read my mind  
Im gonna fight to get you back this time  
  
Cos Im as sick as my secrets  
Yeah its killing me  
You know that I mean it  
I need you next to me  
Theres nowhere to run  
Girl I cant let you go  
And its twisted I know  
But I just cant take it no more  
  
Im tired of all these lies  
Theres nothing but regret behind these eyes  
All this love I could never show  
I dont care any more  
Give a damn who knows  
  
Cos Im as sick as my secrets  
Yeah its killing me  
You know that I mean it  
I need you back with me  
Theres nowhere to run  
Girl I cant let you go  
And its twisting my soul  
But I just cant take it no more  
  
Sick as my secrets  
Yeah its killing me  
You know that I mean it  
I need you next to me  
Theres nowhere to run nowhere to run  
Girl I cant let you go nowhere to hide  
And its twisted I know  
But I just cant take it no more  
  
Yeah I just cant leave you alone  
Yeah yeah  
Tired of all the lies  
Oh babe youve got me stripped of my pride  
Gonna shout it from a mountain top  
Yeah drain the oceans from the tears weve cried  
Gonna break down these walls  
Gonna stand tall  
Gonna
