Youre the fuel to the fire Youre the weapons of war  
Youre the irony of justice And the father of law  
  
Ive been waiting for a while to meet you  
For the chance to shake your hand  
To give you thanks for all the suffering you command  
And when all is over and we return to dust  
Who will be my judge and which one do I trust  
Angst  
  
Youre the champion of sorrow Youre the love and the pain  
Youre the fighter of evil Yet youre one and the same  
  
Ive been waiting for a while to meet you  
For the chance to shake your hand  
To give you thanks for all the suffering you command  
And when all is over and we return to dust  
Who will be my judge and which one do I trust  
Angst
