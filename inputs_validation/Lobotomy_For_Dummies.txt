You can lie to me and say its you I adore  
You can poison me and drown me on the shore  
You can kick me again when Im down on the floor  
Give me some more  
Give me some more  
You say Im desperate and if Im desperate  
At least Im honest  
At least I own it  
And if Im desperate  
Reap what you sow  
Give me some more  
Give me some more  
  
She said thanks for my misery  
Then I said Hell needed company  
And maybe a new lobotomy would  
Make easier to throw it all away  
She said I wish you were dead  
  
Left me out in the gutter  
To settle a score  
Poured salt on my wounds  
When my stitches tore  
And now Im giving it back  
Cause paybacks a whore  
Im slamming the door  
Im slamming the door  
Cause now Im over  
And since Im over it  
Ill be honest  
I think youre heartless  
I think you need this  
Reap what you sow  
Im slamming the door  
Im slamming the door  
  
She said thanks for my misery  
Then I said Hell needed company  
And maybe a new lobotomy would  
Make easier to throw it all away  
She said I wish you were dead  
  
You can lie to me and say its you I adore  
You can poison me and drown me on the shore  
You can kick me again when Im down on the floor  
Give me some more  
Give me some more  
Left me out in the gutter  
To settle a score  
Poured salt on my wounds  
When my stitches tore  
And now Im giving it back  
Cause paybacks a whore  
Im slamming the door  
Im slamming the door  
  
She said thanks for my misery  
Then I said Hell needed company  
And maybe a new lobotomy would  
Make easier to throw it all away  
She said I wish you were dead
