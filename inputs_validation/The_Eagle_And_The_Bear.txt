I will fight and I will die for freedom up against an eagle or a bear  
I will help my brother and well sink or swim together  
If you dont like it Mister I dont care  
I have served with honor in the army I have been a soldier overseas  
I have seen my fatherland stagger like a dying man blinded and bewildered by
disease  
I aint gonna take it any longer I cant look around it anymore  
Ill defend what I believe in a land of liberty like my father did before  
Ill just pray to God for Nicaragua and the sorrow of El Salvador today  
And Ill say until the day we free Mandela all the world will be in chains
