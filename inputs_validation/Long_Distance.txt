Spent last winter playing in the sand  
With the prisoners of the motherland  
Damn hotel is feeling like a cell  
  
And even paradise can be so cruel  
Sitting by the swimming pool  
Trying to keep my head together  
In that hot Australia weather  
  
Three days to kill and my per diems getting low  
Cause I spent all my money calling long distance  
Calling long distance such a long way from home  
  
Am I talking to long distance can you put me through  
Twelve thousand miles but Ive got not resistance  
Long distance long distance long distance long distance  
  
Now the Road Hogs face is turning red  
Larrys still asleep in bed  
Romeo he cant get no head at all  
And the Doctor looks on so annoyed  
You disappoint me Mr Boyd  
And the Electric Dwarf wishes he was six foot tall  
  
Now Romeos patience is wearing thin  
Cmon baby let me in  
Its five am and Ive been creeping round the hall  
Got no resistance calling long distance  
You sound so close but your such a long way from home  
  
Am I talking to long distance can you put me through  
Twelve thousand miles but Ive got not resistance  
Long distance long distance long distance long distance  
  
Still no points for my merrymen  
Except Ricard he just scored ten  
Now Road Hogs getting drunk again  
And I only get to hold my pen  
Instead of what I love to hold the most  
  
I feel so lonesome I could cry  
Count the hours as they roll by  
Its day time now  
I think Ill make a call  
  
Hello long distance calling long distance  
You sound so close but youre such a long way from home  
Youre such a long way from home
