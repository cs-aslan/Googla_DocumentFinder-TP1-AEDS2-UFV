I was wandering in the rain  
Mask of life feelin insane  
Swift and sudden fall from grace  
Sunny days seem far away  
Kremlins shadow belittlin me  
Stalins tomb wont let me be  
On and on and on it came  
Wish the rain would just let me  
  
How does it feel How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
When youre alone  
And youre cold inside  
  
Here abandoned in my fame  
Armageddon of the brain  
KGB was doggin me  
Take my name and just let me be  
Then a beggar boy called my name  
Happy days will drown the pain  
On and on and on it came  
And again and again and again  
Take my name and just let me be  
  
How does it feel How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel How does it feel now  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
When youre alone  
And youre cold inside  
  
How does it feel How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel How does it feel now  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
When youre alone  
And youre cold inside  
  
Like stranger in Moscow  
Like stranger in Moscow  
Were talkin danger  
Were talkin danger baby  
Like stranger in Moscow  
Were talkin danger  
Were talkin danger baby  
Like stranger in Moscow  
Im livin lonely  
Im livin lonely baby  
Stranger in Moscow  
  
KGB interrogator   
Russian to English Translation  
Why have you come from the West  
Confess To steal the great achievements of  
the people the accomplishments of the workers
