We filled the day with careless displays  
Going sailing with nothing to say  
When I fell  
We could tell  
  
Now youre torn apart  
The suns driving fast  
Taking photographs  
Its morning at last  
And the sailors are taking a stand  
With their heads buried deep in the sand  
  
Feeling well  
Life is swell  
When I fell  
We could tell  
Hooray  
When I fell  
We could tell  
Feeling well  
Life is swell
