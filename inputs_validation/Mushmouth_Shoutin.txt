You know Im wild about you baby  
Been keepin me from my sleep at night  
You know Im hung up on you little doll  
You just dont treat your daddy right  
  
You know you crazy when you get drunks you be talkin all out your head  
Youre acting mighty strange about me sayin those things you said  
Im just wild about you baby  
Been keepin me from my sleeps at night  
You know Im hung up on you little darlin  
You just dont treat your daddy right oh yeah  
  
Dya know I came home last night and I looked down on the floor  
I saw a fine pair of alligators somethin I never had before  
But Im wild about you baby  
Been keepin me from my sleeps at night  
You know Im hung up on you little darlin  
You just dont treat your daddy right  
  
Said now honey if you dont stop messin round with me  
Tryn to make me out a dumbbell somethin I aint never gonna be  
Im still wild about you baby  
You been keepin me from my sleeps at night  
You know Im hung up on you little doll  
But you just dont treat your daddy right
