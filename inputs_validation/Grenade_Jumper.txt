My heart ticks in beat with  
These kids that I grew up with  
Living like lifes going out of style  
And you came to watch us play  
Like a big shot talent  
But at the end of the day you know  
Where we came from and where we call home  
  
Hey Chris you were our only friend  
And I know this is belated we love you back  
  
Theyll say its not worth  
So well leave this town in ruins  
Living like lifes going out of style  
And you came to watch us play  
Like a big shot talent  
But at the end of the day you know  
These busted lips we take back home  
  
Hey Chris you were our only friend  
And I know this is belated we love you back  
  
I know you would be there either way  
Im so glad it seems like these time will never fade
