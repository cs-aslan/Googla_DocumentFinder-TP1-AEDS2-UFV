I dont care if youre leavin on the train  
I think all of your musics done in vain  
And I dont care about the girls that you lay  
Im not the one who sees you anyway  
You came to that  
If I can set you free  
Let that be  
Wont you let that be  
I dont care if youre going home  
I think all of your musics done all wrong  
And I dont care if you live in misery  
Things apparent are the things you just cant see  
You came to that  
If I can set you free  
Let that be  
Wont you let that be
