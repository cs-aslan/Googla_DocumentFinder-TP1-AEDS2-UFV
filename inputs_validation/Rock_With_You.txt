Girl close your eyes  
Let that rhythm get into you  
Dont try to fight it  
There aint nothing that you can do  
Relax your mind  
Lay back and groove with mine  
You gotta feel that heat  
And we can ride the boogie  
Share that beat of love  
  
I want to rock with you all night  
Dance you into day sunlight  
I want to rock with you all night  
Rock the night away  
  
Out on the floor  
There aint nobody there but us  
Girl when you dance  
Theres a magic that must be love  
Just take it slow  
Cause we got so far to go  
You gotta feel that heat  
And we can ride the boogie  
Share that beat of love  
  
I want to rock with you all night  
Dance you into day sunlight  
I want to rock with you all night  
Rock the night away  
  
And when the groove is dead and gone yeah  
You know that love survives  
So we can rock forever on  
  
I want to rock with you  
I want to groove with you  
  
I want to rock all night with you girl sunlight  
Rock with you rock with you girl yeah all night  
Dance the night away  
  
I want to rock with you yeah all night  
Rock you into day sunlight  
I want to rock with you all night  
Rock the night away  
  
Feel the heat feel the heat  
Rock you into day sunlight  
I want to rockrock the night away
