Someone point me in the right direction  
Tell me wheres the nearest piece of mind  
Im going crazy  
  
Knight in shining armor in the distance  
He sees the angel threatening my life  
Why wont he save me  
  
All I want is somebody to give a damn  
Notice that Im struggling and lend a hand  
They say  
Everybody needs someone to understand  
Well damnit that includes me too  
  
And all I want is someone to be there for me  
Someone that genuinely cares  
But Im just dreaming  
Its like Im silently screaming  
  
Even though Im totally surrounded  
I feel like Im in here by myself  
  
How about you do it cuz you love me  
Not cuz you want something in return  
Is that so crazy  
Crazy  
  
In the middle of the sea of helpless  
But see I never learned how to swim  
Somebody save me  
Somebody save me  
  
All I want is somebody to give a damn  
Notice that Im struggling and lend a hand  
They say  
Everybody needs someone to understand  
Well damnit that includes me too  
  
And all I want is someone to be there for me  
Someone that genuinely cares  
But Im just dreaming  
Its like Im silently screaming  
  
Somebody to catch me when I fall  
Somebody to help me through it all  
Someone I can trust  
Tell me if Im asking too much  
  
All I want is somebody to give a damn  
Notice that Im struggling and lend a hand  
They say  
Everybody needs someone to understand  
Well damnit that includes me too  
  
All I want is someone to be there for me  
Someone that I can genuinely trust  
But Im just dreaming  
Its like Im silently screaming  
  
Even though Im totally surrounded  
  
Silently screaming  
  
I feel like Im in here by myself  
  
Silently screaming
