Your fathers gone ahunting  
Hes lost in the forest so wild  
And he cannot take his wife with him  
He cannot take his child  
  
Your fathers gone ahunting  
Through the quicksand and the clay  
And a woman cannot follow him  
Although she knows the way  
  
Your fathers gone ahunting  
Through the silver and the glass  
Where only greed can enter  
But spirit spirit cannot pass  
  
Your fathers gone ahunting  
For the beast he cannot bind  
And he leaves a baby sleeping  
And his blessings all behind  
  
Your fathers gone ahunting  
And hes lost his lucky charm  
And hes lost the guardian heart  
That keeps the hunter the harm  
  
Your fathers gone ahunting  
He asked me to say goodbye  
And he warned me not to stop him  
I wouldnt I wouldnt even try
