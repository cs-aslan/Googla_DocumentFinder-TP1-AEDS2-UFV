When I say goodnight in your little room  
Ah thats the time I love you best of all  
When I say goodnight in your little room  
The shadow of your smile is on the wall  
But I can see the reason its just your way of teasin  
But my oh my my my Ill take it all  
When I say goodnight in your little room  
The only place where we can be alone  
When I say goodnight in your little room  
To hold you close this way you say is wrong  
But I can see no reason why you should keep on teasin  
If you dont stop our love just cant go on  
But I can see no reason why you should keep on teasin  
Why cant we let the night just linger on
