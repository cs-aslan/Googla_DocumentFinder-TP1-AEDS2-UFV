Crying over you in the morning  
Crying over you in the evening  
Crying over you dont know what to do  
You make me feel ashamed people say  
Its all in the game woman please let me explain  
Then I know you will be mine  
Everyday I pray  
To have you and to hold  
Now that you are here by my side  
I really really dont want to cry cry  
Crying over you in the morning  
Crying over you in the evening  
Crying over you dont know what to do  
You make me feel ashamed people say  
Its all in the game woman please let me explain  
Then I know you will be mine  
And I will stop crying crying over you  
And I will stop sighing sighing dont know what to do  
Dying dying every day  
Sighing sighing
