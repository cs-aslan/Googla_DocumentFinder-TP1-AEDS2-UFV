Jennifer we cant go wrong lets put it in writing  
Jennifer we cant go wrong lets do it right now  
Maybe youre a little hasty  
But they say love is blind  
Now her names on you  
Her name on you  
Her name on you  
Jennifer in blue  
Did you ever have a bad dream wake up and it not stop  
Did you ever feel for a girl for a time and then stop  
Well its written there in blue  
With a heart and arrow through  
Her name on you  
Her name on you  
Her name on you  
Jennifer in blue  
Oh forever you said thats forever you said yes forever  
And forever she said thats forever she said yes forever  
Still its written there in blue  
With a heart and arrow through  
Her name on you  
Her name on you  
Her name on you  
Jennifer in blue  
Oh forever you said thats forever you said thats forever  
And forever she said thats forever she said yes forever  
Bup ba da da da da Bup ba da da da da  
Bup ba da da da da  
Bup ba da da da da Bup ba da da da da  
Bup ba da da da da  
But you change with the weather  
You change with the weather  
With the weather  
This is the rain
