Broken bones broken hearts  
Stripped down and torn apart  
A little bit of rust  
Im still runnin  
Counting miles counting tears  
Twist of roads shifting gears  
Year after year  
Its all or nothing  
  
But Im not home  
Im not lost  
Still holding on to what I got  
Aint much left  
Though theres so much thats been stolen  
Guess Ive lost everything Ive had  
But Im not dead at least not yet  
Still alone still alive still unbroken  
Im still alone still alive Im still unbroken  
  
Never captured never tamed  
Wild horses on the plains  
You can call me lost I call it freedom  
I feel a spirit in my soul  
Its something Lord I cant control  
Im never giving up while Im still breathing  
  
Im not home  
Im not lost  
Still holding on to what I got  
Aint much left  
Though theres so much thats been stolen  
Guess Ive lost everything Ive had  
Im not dead at least not yet  
Still alone still alive still unbroken  
Im still alone still alive Im still unbroken  
  
Im still unbroken  
  
Still unbroken  
  
Like the wind like the rain  
Keeps on running through my veins  
Like a river pouring down into the ocean  
Im out here on the street  
But Im standing on my feet  
Still alive still alone still unbroken  
  
Im not home  
Im not lost  
Still holding on to what I got  
Aint much left  
Though theres so much thats been stolen  
Guess Ive lost everything Ive had  
But Im not dead at least not yet  
Still alive still alone still unbroken  
Im still alone still alive Im still unbroken  
Im still alone still alive Im still unbroken  
  
Im still unbroken  
  
I aint never going down  
  
Im still unbroken  
Oh
