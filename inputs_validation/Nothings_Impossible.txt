Just give me a reason some kind of sign  
Ill need a miracle to help me this time  
I heard what you said and I feel the same  
I know in my heart that Ill have to change  
  
Even the stars look brighter tonight  
Nothings impossible  
I still believe in love at first sight  
Nothings impossible  
  
How did we get to be this far apart  
How did we get to be this far apart  
I want to be with you have something to share  
I want to be hear Im not there  
  
Even the stars look brighter tonight  
Nothings impossible  
I still believe in love at first sight  
Nothings impossible  
  
Even the stars look brighter tonight  
Nothings impossible  
If you believe in love at first sight  
Nothings impossible  
  
I still believe in love at first sight  
Nothings impossible
