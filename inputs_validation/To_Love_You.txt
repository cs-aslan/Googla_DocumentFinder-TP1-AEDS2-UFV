In overdrive  
I search for life and feeling  
No other ride  
cause baby Ive tried  
Baby Ive tried to reach you  
To reach you so  
To love you  
To love you  
Your figure cuts the shape  
In the embrace of my will  
Theres no mistake  
Baby Ive tried  
Baby Ive tried to love you  
To love you so  
To reach you  
To reach you  
To reach you  
All secrets all the time  
Are wishing more than fine Im waiting  
Still no one on the lines out here  
I rode my horse  
Who ride in bliss  
She showed the course  
But baby Ive tried  
cause baby Ive tried  
To love you  
To love you so  
Just to reach you
