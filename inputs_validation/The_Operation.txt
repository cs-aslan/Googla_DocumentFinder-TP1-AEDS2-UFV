You fight with your right hand  
And caress with your left hand  
Everyone I know is sick to death of you  
  
With a tear thats a mile wide  
In the kite that youre flying  
Everyone I know is sick to death of you  
Ever since  
You dont look the same  
Youre just not the same no way  
You say clever things and  
You never used to  
  
You dont catch what Im saying  
When youre deafened to advice  
Everyone here is sick to the  
Back teeth of you  
  
With a tear thats a mile wide  
In the kite that youre flying  
Everyone here is sick to the  
Tattoo of you  
  
Ever since  
You dont look the same  
Youre just not the same no way  
You say pleasant things and  
There is no need to  
  
Still you fight with your right hand  
And caress with your left hand  
Ooh ooh  
  
Sad to say  
How once I was in love with you  
Sad to say  
  
You dont catch what Im saying  
When youre deafened to advice  
Ooh ooh  
  
Ever since  
You dont look the same  
Youre just not the same no way  
What the hell have  
They stuck into you
