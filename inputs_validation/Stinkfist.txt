Something has to change  
Undeniable dilemma  
Boredoms not a burden  
Anyone should bear  
Constant over stimulation numbs me  
And I wouldnt have  
It any other way  
Its not enough  
I need more  
Nothing seems to satisfy  
I dont want it  
I just need it  
To breathe to feel to know Im alive  
Finger deep within the borderline  
Show me that you love me and that we belong together  
Relax turn around and take my hand  
I can help you change  
Tired moments into pleasure  
Say the word and well be  
Well upon our way  
Blend and balance  
Pain and comfort  
Deep within you  
Till you will not want me any other way  
Its not enough  
I need more  
Nothing seems to satisfy  
I dont want it  
I just need it  
To breathe to feel to know Im alive  
Knuckle deep inside the borderline  
This may hurt a little but its something youll get used to  
Relax Slip away  
Something kinda sad about  
The way that things have come to be  
Desensitized to everything  
What became of subtlety  
How can it mean anything to me  
If I really dont feel anything at all  
Ill keep digging till  
I feel something  
Elbow deep inside the borderline  
Show me that you love me and that we belong together  
Shoulder deep within the borderline  
Relax Turn around and take my hand
