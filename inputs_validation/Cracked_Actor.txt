Ive come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs  
The best of the last the cleanest star they ever had  
  
Im stiff on my legend  
The films that I made  
Forget that Im fifty  
Cause you just got paid  
  
CHORUS  
Crack baby crack  
Show me youre real  
Smack baby smack is that all that you feel  
Suck baby suck  
Give me your head  
Before you start professing  
That youre knocking me dead  
  
You caught yourself a trick down  
On Sunset and Vine  
But since he pinned you baby  
Youre a porcupine  
  
You sold me illusions for a sack full of checks  
Youve made a bad connection cause I just want your sex  
  
CHORUS
