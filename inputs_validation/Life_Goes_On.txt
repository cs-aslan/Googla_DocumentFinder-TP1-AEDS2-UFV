Life goes on the world keeps turning and life goes on  
Life goes on the world keeps turning and life goes on  
He was a company man  
He put his faith in the union and his takehome pay  
A good republican man  
But they closed down the factory his retirement day  
Life goes on whether or not theres a reason  
Life goes on enter another season  
She was the pride of her dad  
But she harbored a secret in her bureau drawer  
And when the news was too bad  
She would get into trouble with the boy next door  
In the dead of the night  
They escape to their fantasy without a sound  
Her father still burns a light  
But they never returned and they were never found
