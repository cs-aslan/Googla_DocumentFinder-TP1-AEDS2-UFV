Step off a train all alone at dawn  
Back into the hole where I was born  
Sun in the sky never raised an eye to me  
  
Theres blood on the tracks and they must be mine  
Fool on the hill and I feel fine  
Dont look back cause you know what you might see  
  
Look into the wall of my minds eye  
I think I know but I dont know why  
Questions of the answers you might need  
  
Comin in a mess going out in style  
I aint good lookin but Im someones child  
No one can give me the air thats mine to breathe  
  
I met my maker I made him cry  
And on my shoulder he asked me why  
His people wont fly through the storm  
I said listen up man they dont even know youre born  
  
All my people right here right now  
Dyou know what I mean yeah yeah  
  
All my people right here right now  
Dyou know what I mean yeah yeah  
  
All my people right here right now  
Dyou know what I mean yeah yeah  
  
I dont really care for what you believe  
So open up your fist and you will receive  
The thoughts and the words of every man youll meet  
  
Get up off the floor of the leaving line  
No ones ever gonna ever ask you twice  
Get all the fuss and bring it all home to me  
  
I met my maker I made him cry  
And on my shoulder he asked me why  
His people wont fly through the storm  
I said listen up now they dont even know youre born  
  
All my people right here right now  
Dyou know what I mean yeah yeah  
  
All my people right here right now  
Dyou know what I mean yeah yeah  
  
All my people right here right now  
Dyou know what I mean yeah yeah
