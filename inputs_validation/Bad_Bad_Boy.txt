Im a bad bad boy  
And Im gonna steal your love  
Said Im a bad bad boy  
And Im gonna steal your love  
  
Come take me to your house  
Then Im gonna rip you off  
Well I made my first kill  
With the old town girl  
  
She was the apple of her daddys eye  
Well that woman looked up at me  
And I said honey well be  
Together till the day I die  
  
But I lied  
Im a bad bad boy  
And Im gonna steal your love  
Im a bad bad boy  
  
And Im gonna steal your love  
Come take me to your house  
Then Im gonna rip you off  
There seems to be no end  
  
Of women who are lookin for a man  
My services dont come cheap  
But I help out when I can  
Tell them lies that they want to hear  
  
And I really lead em on  
Spend all of their money  
And Im long gone  
Im a bad bad boy  
  
And Im gonna steal your love

And Im gonna steal your love  
Come take me to your house  
  
Then Im gonna rip you off  
  
Ive got tastes for fast cars  
I dont want to settle down  
The good life sure come s easily  
With all the mugs around  
  
The women they just come to me  
I dont have to look around  
I move into their homes with them  
Then I move on  
  
Im a bad bad boy  
And Im gonna steal your love

Come take me to your house  
Then Im gonna rip you off
