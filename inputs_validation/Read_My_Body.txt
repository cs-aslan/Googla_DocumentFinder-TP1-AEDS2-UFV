Would you want to know what Im thinking about  
Do you wonder do I want to make you scream and shout  shout it out  
Would you like to see whats in my brain  
Does your curiosity make you insane  insane  
  
Baby youre just wastin precious time if you want to know whats on my mind  
  
Read my body are the letters big enough  
Read my body do you like the book of my love  
Read my body turn the page get to the good stuff read my body  
  
Would you like to go on a moonlight ride  
Do you think you want to show me what youre like inside  
Would you like to touch do you want to know  
How good it can get how far it can go  ooh lets go lets go  
  
Baby if youre lost between the lines open up your eyes and see the signs  
  
Read my body are the letters big enough  
Read my body do you like the book of my love  
Read my body turn the page get to the good stuff read my body  
Baby youre just wastin precious time if you want to know whats on my mind  
  
Read my body are the letters big enough  
Read my body do you like the book of my love  
Read my body turn the page get to the good stuff read my body
