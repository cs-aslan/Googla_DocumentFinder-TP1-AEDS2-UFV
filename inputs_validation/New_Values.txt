Im healthy as a horse  
But everything is spinnin  
And if I use a gun Im sure to go to prison  
Im stubborn as a mule  
And nobody breaks my rules  
But nothin comes my way  
  
Ive got a hardass pair of shoulders  
Ive got a love you cant imagine  
Yeah and what I got I double  
I swear Im keepin out of trouble  
  
Im lookin for one new value  
Im lookin for one new value  
But nothing comes my way  
  
We live in the same world  
  
But nothin comes my way
