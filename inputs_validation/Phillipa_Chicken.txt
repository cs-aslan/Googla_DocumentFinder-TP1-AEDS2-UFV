I got wings I got arms I got shrinks  
I got bombs I got guns I got brains  
So theres no point in your warbird  
Shes no point in denying  
I got guns I got bombs I got brains  
And I wont fall for you  
And I wont fall for you  
Take me up to a warmer place  
I got eggs I got feathers I got brains  
And theres no point in your warbird  
Shes no point in denying  
I got guns I got bombs I got brains  
And I wont fall for you  
And I wont fall for you  
For you for you  
Or you  
I got brains I got feathers I got hands  
I got friends I got ammo I got plans  
So theres no point in your warbird  
Shes no point in denying  
I got guns I got arms I got plans  
And I wont fall for you  
And I wont fall for you  
And I wont fall for you  
And I wont fly for you
