I have no need of half of anything  
No half time no half of a mans attention  
Give me all the earth and sky  
And at the same time add a new dimension  
Half the truth is of no use  
Give it all give it all to me  
I can stand it  
I am strong that way  
  
Give me all night  
Give me the full moon  
And if I cant take the whole of you  
Give it to me anyway  
Give me all night  
Till the last star fades  
And if you cant take my heart and soul  
Take it from me anyway  
  
Dont give me fountains I need waterfalls  
And when I cry my tearsll fill an ocean  
The pain of love Ill accept it all  
As long as youll join me in that emotion  
Half of lovin is no fun  
Give it all give it all to me  
I can stand it  
I am strong that way  
  
Dont leave me guessing alone  
Dont walk me half the way home  
You can do that tomorrow  
Just give me give me all night
