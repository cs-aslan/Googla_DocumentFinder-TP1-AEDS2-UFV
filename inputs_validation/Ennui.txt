All the things you said  you thought I was dead  
Everything made me feel aware  
Ah youre getting old youre doing things  
Youre losing your hair  
All the things that you used to believe in  
Turned out to be true  youre guilty of reason  
  
Youre the kind of person that I could do without  
And certain kinds of money would make you see what its all about  
Theres a first time for everything  
Theres a first ones on me dont you see  
  
All of the things that your old lover said  
Look at them they jump out of windows  
And now theyre just dead  
Its the truth dont you realize  
  
Faded without any talent of fun  
Running out in the streets balling everyone  
Its the truth Its the truth  
  
Pick up the pieces that make up your life  
Maybe some day youll have a wife and them alimony  
Oh cant you see
