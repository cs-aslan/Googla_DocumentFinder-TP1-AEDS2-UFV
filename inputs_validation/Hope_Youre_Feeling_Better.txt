Is that you  
Your eyes slowly fading  
Is that you  
Your mind full of tears  
Is that you  
Searching for a good time  
Is that you  
Waitin for all these years  
  
Chorus  
And I hope youre feelin better  
Yes I hope youre feelin good  
Yes I hope youre feelin better  
  
Is that you  
Look across the ocean  
Is that you  
Thinkin nothin is really there  
Is that you  
Waiting for the sunshine  
Is that you  
When all you see is glare  
  
Chorus  
  
Is that you  
Who never saw your baby  
Is that you  
Who never had a friend  
Is that you  
Movin to a new town  
Is that you  
Will diamonds replace your friends  
  
Chorus
