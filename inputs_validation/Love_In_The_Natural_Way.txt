Well it sounded like a whisper  
But soon became a cry  
And the moment that I touch you  
I know the reason why  we got love  
No union is stronger than a woman with a man  
Im gonna give love in the natural way  
With everything I can  
Never mind if things go wrong  
You and I will still be strong  
And how I love you now  
  
Oh baby were here tonight  
We can make it last forever  
Wen can make it last for life  
Oh baby no matter what  
Im gonna give love in the natural way  
With everything I got  
  
All times it can be gentle  
And at times it can be cruel  
It can treat you like a stranger  
It can treat you like a fool  
But tonight I wanna hold you  
Cos tonight youre gonna see  
Im gonna give you love in the natural way  
And keep you here with me  
Lovin like youve never known  
Now at last Were on our own  
And I still love you now  
  
Oh baby were here tonight  
We can make it last forever  
We can make it last for life  
Oh babe its me and you  
And its a natural reaction  
When you feel the way we do  
What is left thats still unknown  
Lets discover on our own  
  
Cos when loves the culmination  
Of everything you feel  
Well its the only thing thats precious  
Its the only thing thats real
