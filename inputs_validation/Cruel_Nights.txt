Every night without you is more than I can bear  
Moonlight can be torture when your love isnt there  
I see you in the shadows I can hear you in the wind  
I think of you and I can feel my world closin in  
I cant sleep I keep wishin I could touch you  
Id be fine if I could make it through through these  
Cruel nights cruel nights  
Missing you nights  
What do I do nights  
Cruel nights without your love  
Counting every minute every minute feels like days  
Feels like time is standing still since you went away  
Always thought youd stay forever always thought that youd be here  
Now its been a lifetime since I held you near  
Days crawl by I keep wishing theyd be over  
But I know theyre only leading me to to these  
Cruel nights cruel nights  
Missing you nights  
What what do I do nights  
Cruel nights without your love  
Cruel nights since weve been apart  
Cruel nights its been tearing up my heart  
Cruel nights since youve been away baby cruel nights  
Oh I just cant get through another night  
Without you beside me I need you beside me  
I cant sleep I keep wishin I could touch you  
Id be fine if I could make it through  
Through these  
These cruel nights cruel nights  
Missin you nights baby  
What do I what do I do nights  
Cruel nights without your love  
Cruel nights its tearing me apart  
Cruel nights youre playing with me heart  
Cruel nights since youve been away  
Cruel nights well well well baby  
Cruel nights these cruel nights  
These cruel cruel nights  
Cruel nights come home come home baby  
Cruel nights come home now baby
