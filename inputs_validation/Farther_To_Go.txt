Ive been up to the top of a heartbreak mountain  
Ive been down in the valley of the blues  
Ive been down the road of loneliness and back again  
And Ive got farther to go than Ive been  
Ive been down in the dust of broken memries  
Ive been up on the clouds of happiness  
Ive seen many a glass held high in the house of sin  
And Ive got farther to go than Ive been  
Ive got farther to go Ive got things to forget  
Ive got things I remember about you  
Ive been up when you told me that you love me  
I went down when you told me we were through  
Cried until my eyes would dry then I cried again  
And Ive got farther to go than Ive been  
Yes Ive got farther to go than Ive been
