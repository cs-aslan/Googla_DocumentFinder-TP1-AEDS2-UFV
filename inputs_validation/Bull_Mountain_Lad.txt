Just a poor mountain lad  
The devil must have been his dad  
Ive seen a lot of trouible in my time  
  
Ive seen his moma cryin while he was arunnin wild  
I heard his daddy say boy youre no son of mine  
I watched his uncle whip him hard with a double plow line  
Ive seen a lot of trouible in my time  
  
Just a poor mountain lad  
The devil must have been his dad  
Lord Ive seen a lot of trouible in my time  
  
Well I seen his moma barefoot in the cold winter time  
His dad would lay out drinkin for weeks on the wine  
Ive seen the children hungry and cry at supper time  
Lord Ive seen a lot of trouble in my time  
  
Well Ive heard moma prayin read the bible late at night  
His dad would say its bedtime woman blow out the light  
Ive see her do the washin the clothes freezin on the line  
Ive seen a lot of trouble in my time  
  
Just a poor mountain lad  
The devil must have been his dad  
Ive seen a lot of trouible in my time  
  
Just a poor mountain lad  
The devil must have been his dad  
Lord Ive seen a lot of trouible in my time  
  
Just a poor mountain lad  
The devil must have been his dad  
Lord Ive seen a lot of trouible in my time
