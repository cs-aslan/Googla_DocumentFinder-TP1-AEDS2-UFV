Traditional  
Down in the valley while on my knees  
I asked my Jesus carry please  
He promised that hed take care of me  
If I would lift him up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
I ll be your father  
Ill be your mother  
Ill be your sister  
And your brother  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
Ill bring joy joy joy  
To your soul  
When I am lonely  
When I am sad  
My Jesus comes and makes me glad  
He is the dearest friend Ive have had  
I want to lift Him up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
I ll be your father  
Ill be your mother  
Ill be your sister  
And your brother  
He said if I  
Be lifted up  
Ill bring joy joy joy  
To your soul
