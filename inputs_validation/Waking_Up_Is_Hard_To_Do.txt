You slept your night now its morning time  
Thats the time to rise and shine  
Dont you cry and dont be blue  
Wakin up is hard to do  
Just brush your teeth and then get dressed  
When you comb your hair youll look the best  
Now you know its really true  
Wakin up is hard to do  
They say that wakin up is hard to do  
Wear a smile dont you be blue  
Just wipe the sleep from your eyes  
Instead of going back to bed  
You got to stretch and face the day  
Just listen to the birdies sing  
And the flowers that await the spring  
Rise and shine youre dreamings through  
Wakin up is hard to do  
They say that wakin up is hard to do  
Wear a smile dont you be blue  
Just wipe the sleep from your eyes  
Instead of going back to bed  
You got to stretch and face the day  
Just listen to the birdies sing  
And the flowers that await the spring  
Rise and shine youre dreamings through  
Wakin up is hard to do
