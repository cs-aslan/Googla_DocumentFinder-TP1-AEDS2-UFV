Kid  
Stay and snip your cord off  
Talk and let your mind loose  
Cant all think like Chekov  
But youll be ok  
  
Kid  
Is this your first time here  
Some cant stand the beauty  
So they cut off one ear  
But youll be ok  
  
Welcome to the garden of earthly delights  
Welcome to a billion Arabian Nights  
This is your life and you do what you want to do  
This is your life and you spend it all  
This is your life and you do what you want to do  
Just dont hurt nobody  
And the big rewards here  
In the garden of earthly delights  
  
Kid  
Pick up with another  
Some will even drop you  
But hearts are built like rubber  
So youll be alright  
  
Kid  
Swallow but believe us  
You wont die of boredom  
Should you have to leave us  
Itll be alright  
  
Welcome to the garden of earthly delights  
Welcome to a billion Arabian Nights  
This is your life and you do what you want to do  
This is your life and you spend it all  
This is your life and you do what you want to do  
Just dont hurt nobody  
less of course they ask you  
In the garden of earthly delights
