If I owned Aladdins lamp  
Id make all your dreams come true  
But nothing in the world  
Could make me love you  
More than I do  
  
If I owned a magic clock  
Then Id keep our love brand new  
But nothing in the world  
Could make me love you  
More than I do  
  
Dont ever doubt my feelings  
My love is real  
My darling Im revealing  
Exactly how I feel  
  
If I owned a magic wand  
Id wave it for no one but you  
But nothing in the world  
Could make me love you  
More than I do  
  
My darling Im revealing  
Exactly how I feel  
  
If I owned a magic wand  
Id wave it for no one but you  
But nothing in the world  
Could make me love you  
More than I do
