Give me one more chance  
And youll be satisfied  
Give me two more chances  
You wont be denied  
  
Well my heart is where its always been  
My head is somewhere in between  
Give me one more chance  
There will be a lover tonight  
  
Check it out  
  
Youre the real thing  
Yeah the real thing  
Youre the real thing  
Even better than the real thing  
  
Give me one last chance  
And Im gonna make you sing  
Give me half a chance  
To ride on the waves that you bring  
  
Youre honey child to a swarm of bees  
Gonna blow right through you like a breeze  
Give me one last chance  
Well slide down the surface of things  
  
Youre the real thing  
Yeah the real thing  
Youre the real thing  
Even better than the real thing  
  
Were free to fly the crimson sky  
The sun wont melt our wings tonight  
  
Oh now  
Here she comes  
  
Take me higher  
Take me higher  
Can you take me higher  
Will you take me higher  
  
Youre the real thing  
Yeah the real thing  
Youre the real thing  
  
Even better than the real thing  
Even better than the real thing  
Even better than the real thing
