Theres a place in the sun  
For anyone who has the will to chase one  
And I think Ive found mine  
Yes I do believe I have found mine so  
  
Close your eyes  
And think of someone  
You physically admire  
And let me kiss you  
Let me kiss you  
  
Ive zigzagged all over America  
And I cannot find a safety haven  
Say would you let me cry  
On your shoulder  
Ive heard that youll will try anything twice  
  
Close your eyes  
And think of someone  
You physically admire  
And let me kiss you  
Let me kiss you  
  
But then you open your eyes  
And you see someone  
That you physically despise  
But my heart is open  
My heart is open to you
