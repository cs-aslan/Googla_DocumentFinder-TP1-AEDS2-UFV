Lookin for a love  
Searchin everywhere  
I cant get enough and I dont really care  
If it takes a lot of waitin  
Cause Ive got the time to spare  
Its gonna take a lot more lovin  
But we got plenty of that around here  
  
Laughin heading home a woman could be fine  
Flying back alone I dont really mind  
Cause it gives me the time for thinking  
How so many people just ruin their lives  
Folks miss out on so much lovin  
By picking it up before it arrives  
  
I cant see it but I know when its there  
I can just feel it its everywhere  
I cant see it but I know when its there  
I can just feel it its everywhere  
  
Lookin for a love

I cant see it but I know when its there  
I can just feel it its everywhere
