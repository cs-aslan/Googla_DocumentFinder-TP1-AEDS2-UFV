Well we dance without our shoes  
But theres glass around our feet  
And wed walk around the town  
But were allergic to concrete  
Wed be stuffed to the gills  
But theres nothing here to eat  
No theres nothing here to eat  
No theres nothing here to eat  
  
Oh well wed love to rest our eyes  
But we hear the floor boards creek  
So we lie with one eye open and  
Clutch knives between the sheets  
If theres no rest for the wicked  
Well then well never get no sleep  
Well never get no sleep  
No well never get no sleep  
Oh no  
  
Cause were banging our heads against brick walls  
And the walls are hard and our heads are soft  
Its a painful way to get attention  
Its a painful way to get attention  
  
Were banging our heads against brick walls  
And the walls are hard and our heads are soft  
Its a painful way to get attention  
Its a painful way to get attention  
  
Were banging our heads against brick walls  
And the walls are hard and our heads are soft  
Its a painful way to get attention  
Its a painful way to get attention  
  
Were banging our heads against brick walls  
And the walls are hard and our heads are soft  
Its a painful way to get attention  
Its a painful way to get attention  
  
Were banging our heads against brick walls  
And the walls are hard and our heads are soft  
Its a painful way to get attention  
Its a painful way to get attention  
  
Were banging our heads against brick walls  
And the walls are hard and our heads are soft  
Its a painful way to get attention  
Its a painful way to get attention no
