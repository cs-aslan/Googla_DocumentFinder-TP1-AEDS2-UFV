You always had an eye for things that glittered  
But I was far from bein made of gold  
I dont know how but I scraped up the money  
I just never could quite tell you no  
Just like when you were leavin Amarillo  
To take that new job in Tennessee  
And I quit mine so we could be together  
I cant forget the way you looked at me  
  
Chorus  
Just to see you smile  
Id do anything  
That you wanted me to  
And all is said and done  
Id never count the cost  
Its worth all thats lost  
Just to see you smile  
  
When you said time was all you really needed  
I walked away and let you have your space  
Cause leavin didnt hurt me near as badly  
As the tears I saw rollin down your face  
And yesterday I knew just what you wanted  
When you came walkin up to me with him  
So I told you that I was happy for you  
And given the chance Id lie again  
  
ChorusRepeat x2
