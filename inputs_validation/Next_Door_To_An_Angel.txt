Im living right next door to an angel  
And I just found out today  
Im living right next door to an angel  
And she only lives a house away  
She used to be a skinny little girl  
But all of a sudden shes out of this world  
Im living right next door to an angel  
And Im gonna make that angel mine  
  
Since I saw her this morning  
Im on cloud number nine  
Theres a garden of Eden  
At the house next door to mine  
I took a look and oh what a shock  
To find a little bit of heaven  
Right here on the block  
Im living right next door to an angel  
And Im gonna make that angel mine  
  
I cant believe that this is the girl next door  
Her funny little face isnt funny no more  
Sixteen and oh what a dream  
Aint it strange how she changed  
Into such a lovely angel  
  
Saw her walkin down main street  
And I couldnt believe my eyes  
It used to be such a plain street  
But now its paradise  
  
I feel so happy Im feelin so good  
Im the luckiest devil in the neighbourhood  
Im living right next door to an angel  
And Im gonna make that angel mine
