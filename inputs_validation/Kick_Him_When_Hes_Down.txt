Hey youre a riddle  
I say as I move aside  
Like I really need your advice  
But you wont leave it alone  
  
Little men try but dont get a lot done  
Living in sin doesnt move me either way  
I get a feeling youre so vague  
Like I said before  
Little men come when anything goes  
  
Chorus  
When the rain comes I sit home and pray  
Make it all numb  
I wish it all away  
All I really need is just somewhere to hide away  
Kick him when hes down  
Here alone Ill put up and fight  
Kick him when hes down  
Beat me all the way Ill take it all night  
Kick him when hes down  
Hey dont worry Ill get along home alright  
  
Hey everybodys supposed to be the same  
So how come theyre so lame  
Its like taking a fall  
Keep on running back into that wall  
  
Awake in a dream get up and go to work  
But Im feeling like such a jerk  
Like I said before  
Little men come when everything goes  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey youre a riddle I say as I move aside  
Like I really need your advice  
But you wont leave it alone  
Little men try but dont get a lot done  
  
Living in sin doesnt move me either way  
I get a feeling youre so vague  
Like I said before  
Little men come when anything goes
