This bloody road remains a mystery  
This sudden darkness fills the air  
What are we waiting for  
Wont anybody help us  
What are we waiting for  
  
We cant afford to be innocent  
Stand up and face the enemy  
Its a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
  
This shattered dream you cannot justify  
Were gonna scream until were satisfied  
What are we running for  
Weve got the right to be angry  
What are we running for  
When theres no where we can run to anymore  
  
We cant afford to be innocent  
Stand up and face the enemy  
Its a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
And with the power of conviction  
There is no sacrifice  
Its a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
  
Wont anybody help us  
What are we running for  
When theres no where no where we can run to anymore  
  
We cant afford to be innocent  
Stand up and face the enemy  
Its a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
  
And with the power of conviction  
There is no sacrifice  
Its a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
  
Repeat x2  
We cant afford to be innocent  
Stand up and face the enemy  
Its a do or die situation  
We will be invincible
