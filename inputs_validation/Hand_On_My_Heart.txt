Rescue me  
I cant dream this dream any more my dream oh my dream  
Set me free  
I keep holdin on but  
I dont know what for  
  
All I know  
Is that Ive breathed your name for what feels like a lifetime  
I cant let go youre a part of me  
  
And I die each time  
I lose a little more of you  
And I look for a sign to give me hope  
Well find a love we once knew  
  
And all I know  
Is when were face to face when theres no one between us  
With one last embrace well let time heal the pain  
  
Keep your hand on my heart dont let go  
I cant see youre too close to me  
Dont leave me in the dark keep your hand on my heart  
Oh please only you lonely me  
  
Its not enough to simply talk about love  
As if it were in our control  
Now as I struggle with the past I cant think about the future  
Its so hard to let go  
  
And all I know  
Is I still whisper your name girl it wont be the last time  
As our lives go separate ways  
And let time heal the pain  
  
Keep your hand on my heart dont let go  
I cant see youre too close to me  
Dont leave me in dark keep your hand on my heart  
Oh please only you lonely me  
  
Keep your hand on my heart dont let go  
I cant see youre too close to me  
Dont leave me in dark keep your hand on my heart  
Oh please  
  
Keep your hand on my heart dont let go  
I cant see youre too close to me  
Dont leave me in dark keep your hand on my heart  
Oh please only you lonely me  
Only you lonely me
