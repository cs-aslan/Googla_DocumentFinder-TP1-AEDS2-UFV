While you were out  
The message says  
You left a number  
And I tried to call  
But they wrote it down  
In a perfect Spanish scrawl  
In a perfect Spanish scrawl  
  
Yet again  
Im missing you  
King size bed  
in a hotel someplace  
I hear your name  
I see your face  
I see your face  
  
The back street dolls  
And the side door johnnies  
The wide eyed boys with their bags full of  
Money  
Back in the alley  
Going bang to the wall  
Tied to the tail  
Of a midnight crawl  
Heaven wouldnt be  
So high I know  
If the times gone by  
Hadnt been so low  
The best laid plans  
Come apart at the seams  
And shatter all my dreams  
  
Sometimes I feel like  
Screaming  
Close my eyes  
Its times like this  
My head goes down  
And the only thing I know  
Is the name of this town  
Is the name of this town  
  
Yet again  
Im missing you  
Wont be long  
O coming home  
Until that distant time  
Ill be moving on  
Ill be moving on
