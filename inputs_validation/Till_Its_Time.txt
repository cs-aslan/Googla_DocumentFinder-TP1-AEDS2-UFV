I just cant tell  
This feeling here inside me  
I feel so strange  
Whenever you are near me  
Everytime I see you pass I smile  
But then you never seem to realize  
Its for your eyes  
If you would say hello  
It would be nice  
Chorus  
Youre in my mind  
Almost all the time  
Every single minute all I do is think of you  
And deep inside  
In this heart of mine  
I have to go on wishing till its time  
One day you came  
And you are oh so near me  
I smiled and then  
You turn and did not see me  
How am I supposed to get to meet you  
What should I do  
Your in my dreams I feel it seems  
That you dont feel it quite the way I do  
Repeat chorus  
Yeahhh heyyyy ohhh  
Yes deep inside  
In this heart of mine  
I have to go on wishing till its time  
Repeat chorus  
Yeaaaaahhh  
Till its time
