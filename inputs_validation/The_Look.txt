One two three four walking like a man  
Hitting like a hammer  
Shes a juvenile scam  
Never was a quitter  
Tasty like a raindrop  
Shes got the look  
  
Heavenly bound  
Cause heavens got a number  
When shes spinning me around  
Kissing is a color  
Her loving is a wild dog  
Shes got the look  
  
Shes got the look Shes got the look Shes got the look Shes got the
look  
What in the world can make a browneyed girl turn blue  
When everything Ill ever do Ill do for you  
And I go la la la la la shes got the look  
  
Fire in the ice  
Naked to the tbone  
Is a lovers disguise  
Banging on the head drum  
Shaking like a mad bull  
Shes got the look  
  
Swaying to the band  
Moving like a hammer  
Shes a miracle man  
Loving is the ocean  
Kissing is the wet sand  
Shes got the look  
  
Shes got the look Shes got the look Shes got the look Shes got the
look  
What in the world can make a browneyed girl turn blue  
When everything Ill ever do Ill do for you  
And I go la la la la la shes got the look  
  
Walking like a man  
Hitting like a hammer  
Shes a juvenile scam  
Never was a quitter  
Tasty like a raindrop  
Shes got the look  
  
She goes na na na na na na
