Time aint nothing but time  
Its a verse with no rhyme  
Man it all comes down to you  
  
Change aint nothing but change  
Just the faces and the names  
But you know were gonna make it through  
  
Ill believe  
When you dont believe in anything  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna hold you til your hurt is gone  
Be the shoulder that youre leaning on  
Ill be standing here  
For the next 100 years  
If it all should end tonight  
Ill know it was worth the fight  
And well be standing here  
For the next 100 years  
  
I when I think that Im losing my mind  
It all comes back to you  
  
And you you know that its true  
After all weve been through  
Theres nothing that I wouldnt do  
  
Stand by me  
And I would gladly give up everything  
  
Chorus x2
