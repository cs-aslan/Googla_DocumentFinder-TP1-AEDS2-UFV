What I feel when Im playing guitar  
Is completely cold and crazy  
Like I dont owe nobody nothing  
And its just a test just to see  
How far I can relax  
Into the cold wave of a note  
  
When everything hits just right just and right  
The note of nobility can go on forever  
I never tire of the solitary E  
And I trust my guitar  
And I dont care about anything  
  
Sometimes I feel like Ive broken through  
And Im free and I could dig into eternity  
Into eternity riding the wave  
And realm of the E  
Sometimes its useless  
  
Here I am struggling and filled with dread  
Afraid that Ill never squeeze enough  
Graphite from my damaged cranium  
To inspire or asphyxiate any eyes  
Grazing like hungry cows across the stage or page  
  
Inside of me Im crazy Im just crazy  
Inside I must continue  
I see her my stiff muse  
Jutting around round round  
Round like a broken speeding statue  
  
The colonial year is dead  
And the Greeks too are finished  
The face of Alexander remains not only solely  
Due to sculpture but through the power and foresight  
And magnetism of Alexander himself  
  
The artist must maintain his swagger  
He must he must he must be intoxicated  
By ritual as well as result  
Look at me I am laughing  
I am laughing  
I am lapping cocaine from the hard brown palm  
Of the bouncer and I trust my guitar  
  
Therefore we black out together  
Therefore I would run through scum  
And scum is just ahead ah we see it  
But we just laugh  
Were ascending through the hollow mountain  
We are peeking  
We are laughing  
We are kneeling  
We are laughing  
We are radiating at last  
  
This rebellion is just a gas  
Our gas a gas that we pass
