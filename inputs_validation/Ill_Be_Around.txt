Hey boy  did you find out  
Whatcha had to know  n what its all about  
When you started to move  just a step at a time  
You never wanted to fall  
You took a chance on the wild side  
Hey girl  cantcha come down  
Are ya way at the top  afraid of somethin you found  
Then you try to go back  not as easy to do  
Did you find who you are  
From a dance on the wild side  
  
I know sometimes its hard for you  
To keep your feet upon the path that youve chosen  
Its not for you to walk alone  
Together we can take this road where its going  hang on  
  
Chorus 1  
Stand by me  stand right here  
The time has come to say it clear  
Now dont give up  but dont give in  
We will stand together to the end  
And Ill be around  Ill be around yeah  
  
No joke  the sooner you find  
It happens all the same  for every mothers child  
when you walk in the dark  then you stumble and fall  
Its a part of it all  
When we dance on the wild side  
  
But everybody needs someone  
Who loves em through the toughest times  while theyre growing  yah  
Who keeps a candle burning  
When the darkness covers up the path where theyre going  hang on  
  
Chorus 2  
Stand by me  stand right here  
The time has come to say it clear  
Now dont give up  dont give in  
We will stand together to the end  
And Ill be around  come what may  
Heaven hears us when we pray  
So dont give up  but dont give in  
We will stand together to the end  
I will be there my good friend  
And Ill be around  
  
Be around Ill be around  
Ill walk this road with you  
wherever it may wind  
And Ill be around  
  
Chorus 2
