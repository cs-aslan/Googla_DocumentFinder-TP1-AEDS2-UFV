Bless me father I have sinned  
Im not sure where to begin  
I wont name names or where Ive been  
But Ive been there and back again  
No Hail Marys will save me  
You learned to live with memories  
Here slip this sinner up your sleeve  
Just stay inside until I leave  
  
Ive been running always running  
Never have both feet on the floor  
Ive been running always running  
Now I aint running any more  
  
The hands of time they tick no more  
Let darkness fall upon this door  
No waves to wash up on this shore  
I won the fight but lost the war  
  
Ive been running always running  
Never had both feet on the floor  
And Ive been running always running  
Now I aint running anymore  
  
There were those who I have loved  
Whove given all and given up  
I pushed your patience and my luck  
It wasnt love I didnt trust  
It wasnt you or me or us  
Youve shouldered ifs and ands and buts  
Its not that way okay Ive said too much  
But Ive been running always running  
Never had both feet on the floor  
Ive been running always running  
Now I aint running anymore
