He threw down a glove you made the mistake  
Of picking it up now youre gone  
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords  
The choice of weapons is done  
Hell tear you apart as soon as you start  
You know you dont have a chance  
CHORUS  
OHOHFight for the honour  
Fight for the splendour  
Fight for the pleasure  
OHOHFight for the honour  
Fight for the splendour  
Fight for your life  
Ready to start the duel begins the best man wins in the end  
A lunge and a feint a parry too late  
A cut to the chest and youre down  
Seeing the stain then feeling the pain  
Feeling the sweat on your brow  
CHORUS  
The fighting resumes a silence looms the swordsmen move gainst each  
other  
A cut and a thrust a parry a blow a stab to the heart and youre down  
The Angel of Death hears your last breath  
Meanwhile the Reaper looks on  
CHORUS  
OHOHFought the honour  
Fought for the splendour  
Fought for the pleasure  
OHOHFought for the honour  
fought for the splendour  
Fought to the death
