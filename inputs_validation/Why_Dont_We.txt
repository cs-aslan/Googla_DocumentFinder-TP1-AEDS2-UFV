Why dont we get some answers  
Stop messin around with our lives  
We hear the same old story wheres the glory  
Its our lives its our lives  
Changes are vital do we care  
Its taken far too long  maybe were there  
Start walkin with our time if you dare  
There is a rightness yes everywhere  
Why dont we why dont we  
Open our eyes  
Why dont we why dont we  
Change our minds  
Honest and sweet surrender   
Never wanted this illusion  
In our lives  
Trials and tribulations  
Familiar conversations  
In our lives in our lives  
Competing against everyone  
A trap that and a snare  
Return to nature no solution so beware  
How can it be this way  
Shouldnt be so  
Surviving day after day  
Unwilling to let go  
Why dont we why dont we  
Share this time  
Why dont we why dont we  
Open our eyes  
Livin with a global village  
Aware of the unexpected  
In our lives  
Transforming greed and pillage  
Not to be rejected   
Its our lives its our lives  
Changes are vital do we care  
Its taken far too long  maybe were there  
Stop workin with our time if you dare  
There is a rightness yes everywhere  
Why dont we why dont we  
Open our eyes  
Why dont we why dont we  
Share this time  
Why dont we why dont we  
Change their minds  
Why dont we why dont we  
Share our lives
