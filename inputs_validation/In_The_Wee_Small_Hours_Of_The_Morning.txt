When the sun is high in the afternoon sky  
You can always find something to do  
But from dusk till dawn as the clock ticks on  
Something happens to you  
  
In the wee small hours of the morning  
While the whole wide world is fast asleep  
You lie awake and think about the boy  
And never ever think of counting sheep  
  
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson  
Youd be his if only hed call  
In the wee small hours of the morning  
Thats the time you miss him most of all  
  
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson  
Youd be his if only hed call  
In the wee small hours of the morning  
Thats the time you miss him most of all
