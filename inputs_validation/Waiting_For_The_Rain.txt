Im waiting for the rain  
Im waiting for you  
Im waiting for the rain  
To clean my soul  
Im waiting for the rain  
Nothings gonna be better  
Without you  
  
The day you left me  
The day you came  
Ill never forget you  
Feel you in my pain  
The time stood still  
The time was flying  
I wonder why  
Im not dying  
  
Im waiting for the sun  
Im waiting for a new day  
Im waiting for the night  
To close my eyes  
Im waiting for the dark  
Oh its gonna be harder  
Without you  
  
The way we danced  
Ill always miss  
Ill never forget  
The way we kissed  
The time stood still  
The time was flying  
I wonder why  
Im not dying  
  
Na na na na na  
Na na na na na
