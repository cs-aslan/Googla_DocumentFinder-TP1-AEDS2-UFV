In the time before the twilight  
Settles on the world  
Woah you can feel the magic  
Dreamin of someone to hold tight  
One more lonely girl  
Woah dances in her attic  
  
Everywhere across the land  
In front of their mirrors with combs in their hands  
They prepare to make a stand  
Lover to lover woman to man  
Livin for the   
  
Small town hot summer nights  
Radio bout to blow  
Top down under the lights  
Feel the heat wild and sweet  
Hot summer nights  
  
Riding solo in his front seat  
Bursting at the seams  
Woah drivin by desire  
Home town hero haunts the main street  
Dreaming desperate dreams  
Woah where theres smoke theres fire  
And some believe that love is won  
And some of them go like theyre under the gun  
In between whats already done  
And the promise they feel in the evening to come  
Out for the  
  
Small town hot summer nights  
Radio bout to blow  
Top down under the lights  
Feel the heat wild and sweet  
Hot summer nights  
  
In the end two hearts will meet  
And maybe theyll find whatever they seek  
If they can theyll learn how to keep  
The faith that they found in the sound of the beat  
Out for those  
  
Small town hot summer nights  
Radio bout to blow  
Top down under the lights  
Feel the heat wild and sweet  
Hot summer nights
