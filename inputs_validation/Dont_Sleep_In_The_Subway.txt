You wander around on your own little cloud  
When you dont see the why or the wherefore  
You walk out on me when we both disagree  
Cause to reason is not what you care for  
Ive heard it all a million times before  
Take off your coat my love and close the door  
Dont sleep in the subway darlin dont stand in the pouring rain  
Dont sleep in the subway darlin the night is long  
Forget your foolish pride nothings wrong  
Now youre beside me again  
  
You try to be smart then you take it to heart  
Cause it hurts when your ego is deflated  
You dont realize that its all compromise  
And the problems are so overrated  
Goodbye means nothing when its all for show  
So why pretend youve somewhere else to go  
Dont sleep in the subway darlin dont stand in the pouring rain  
Dont sleep in the subway darlin the night is long  
Forget your foolish pride nothings wrong  
Now youre beside me again  
Dont sleep in the subway darlin
