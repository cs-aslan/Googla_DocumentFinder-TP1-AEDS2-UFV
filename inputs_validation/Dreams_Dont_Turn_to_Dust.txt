Splashdown in the silver screen  
Into a deep dramatic scene  
I swim through the theater  
Or maybe Im just a dreamer  
Like a kite in the bright midday  
Wonder stole my breath away  
  
Shy sonata for Mercury  
The stars always sing so pretty  
This picnic will soon depart  
Real life Im sad to see you go  
Ill miss you with all my heart  
But Id rather be alone  
  
Cause I couldnt live without  
The sunsets that dazzle in the dusk  
So Ill drag the anchor up  
And rest assured cause dreams dont turn to dust  
Dreams dont turn to dust  
I made for the countryside  
  
And my eyes never grew so wide  
Apple raspberry river blue  
I dont wanna leave without you  
In the sound Ill gladly drown  
Into the emerald underground  
I rub my eyes cause its hard to see  
  
Surrounded by all this beauty  
This picnic will soon depart  
Real life Im sad to see you go  
Ill miss you with all my heart  
But Id rather be alone  
Cause I couldnt live without  
  
The sunsets that dazzle in the dusk  
So Ill drag the anchor up  
And rest assured cause dreams dont turn to dust  
Im sad to see you go  
But Id rather be alone  
When tiger eyes begin making you blush  
When diamonds boast that they cant be crushed  
Let em go cause dreams dont turn to dust  
  
This picnic will soon depart  
Real life Im sad to see you go  
Ill miss you with all my heart  
But Id rather be alone  
Cause I couldnt live without  
The sunsets that dazzle in the dusk  
  
So Ill drag the anchor up  
And rest assured  
Cause dreams dont turn to dust  
Dreams dont turn to dust  
Dreams dont turn to dust  
Ill rest assured cause dreams dont turn to dust
