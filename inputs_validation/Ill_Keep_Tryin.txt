If I had the time and lotsa money  
The Id take you round the world  
N if I had a dime for every penny  
Then Id buy you diamonds girl  
You dont even know how much I love you  
And how much I want to be  
Your knight in shining armor yeah baby  
Thats good enough for me  
  
Chorus  
And Ill keep tryin  
Yeah Ill keep tryin to make you mine  
Mine all mine  
I hope youre buyin I hope youre buyin  
All of my lines  
  
Now if I was the king and had a castle  
Then youd surely be my queen  
We would live up in the tallest tower  
And we rarely would be seen  
You dont even know how much I need you  
And how much you mean to me  
Im dog without a bone hear me cryin  
And its time for you to see that  
  
Chorus
