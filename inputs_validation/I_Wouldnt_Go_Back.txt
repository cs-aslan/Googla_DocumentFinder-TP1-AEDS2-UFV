I Wouldnt Go Back  
Words and Music by Lawrence Chewning  
I wouldnt go back I wouldnt go back  
I wouldnt go back  
To that life I used to live  
I wouldnt go back  
Im never going back again  
Thats all behind me  
So dont you remind me  
Its all too vivid in my mind  
I wouldnt go back  
To that life I used to live  
I chose to leave it all behind  
Lead me on lead me on  
Whatever it takes  
Oh Lord lead me on  
I wouldnt go back  
To that life I used to live  
Before the night I knelt  
And asked God to forgive me  
Oh the pain I felt the tears I shed  
The loneliness inside  
I wouldnt go back  
I wouldnt go back not I  
I still recall that night one Fall  
How close I came to ending my life  
Just before You came  
Lying on my bed  
The ceiling over my head kept screaming  
Who are you anyway  
What could I say  
Sitting in my living room  
Tears streaming down my face  
Life was such a waste til I met You  
Jesus I wouldnt go back  
I wouldnt go back  
Never again never again  
Never again no  
I wouldnt go back  
To that life I used to live  
I wouldnt go back I wouldnt go back  
Ill never go back  
Ill never go back  
Im never going back again
