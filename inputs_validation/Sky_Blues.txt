I was sittin on a plane I was lookin at the dreary day  
I saw somebody she was sittin just an aisle away  
She was a first class lady and I knew that she looked refined  
My heart started thumpin louder than the engine whine  
  
I got the sky blues Im up in the air  
Runnin from a lady who just dont care  
And all I want to do is get down to earth with you  
Oooooooooo I got the sky blues  
Oooooooooo I got the sky blues  
  
Well I sat down beside her and I told her I was feeling blue  
I said My girl dont want me and its breaking my heart in two  
Well I felt so bad that I didnt even stick around I said  
We may be flying but hearts draggin on the ground
