Down in amongst the streets tonight  
Books will burn people laugh and cry in their turmoil  
Turmoil turns rejoiceful  
Shed your fears and lose your guilt  
Tonight we burn responsibility in the fire  
Well watch the flames grow higher  
But if you get too burnt you cant come back home  
And as I was standing by the edge  
I could see the faces of those led pissing themselves laughing  
And the flames grew  
Their mad eyes bulged their flushed faces said  
The weak get crushed as the strong grow stronger  
We feast on flesh and drink on blood  
Live by fear and despise love in a crises  
What with todays high prices  
Bring some paper and bring some wood  
Bring whats left of all your love for the fire  
Well watch the flames grow higher  
But if you get too burnt  you cant come back home  
And as I was standing by the edge  
I could see the faces of those led pissing themselves laughing  
And the flames grew  
Their mad eyes bulged their flushed faces said  
The weak get crushed as the strong grow stronger  
In the funeral pyre  
Well watch the flames grow higher  
But if you get too burnt  you cant come back home  
Well I feel so old when I feel so young  
Well I just cant grow up to meet the demands
