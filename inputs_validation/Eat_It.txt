How come youre always such a fussy young man  
Dont want no Capn Crunch dont want no Raisin Bran  
Well dont you know that other kids are starvin in Japan  
So eat it just eat it  
  
Dont want to argue I dont want to debate  
Dont want to hear about what kinds of foods you hate  
You wont get no dessert till you clean off youre plate  
So eat it  
  
Dont you tell me youre full  
Just eat it eat it  
Get yourself an egg and beat it  
  
Have some more chicken  
Have some more pie  
It doesnt matter  
If its boiled or fried  
  
Just eat it just eat it  
Just eat it just eat it Woo  
  
Your table manners are a crying shame  
Youre playing with your food this aint some kind of game  
Now if you starve to death  
Youll just have yourself to blame  
So eat it Just eat it  
  
You better listen better do as youre told  
You havent even touched your tuna casserole  
You better chow down or its gonna get cold  
So eat it  
  
I dont care if youre full  
Just eat it eat it  
Open up your mouth and feed it  
  
Have some more yogurt  
Have some more Spam  
It doesnt matter if its fresh or canned  
Just eat it Eat it Eat it Eat it  
Dont you make me repeat it  
  
Have a banana have a whole bunch  
It doesnt matter what you had for lunch  
  
Just eat it Eat it  
Eat it Eat it  
Eat it Eat it  
If its getting cold reheat it  
  
Have a big dinner  
Have a light snack  
If you dont like it you cant send it back  
  
Just eat it Eat it  
Get yourself an egg and beat it  
  
Have some more chicken Have some more pie  
It doesnt matter if its boiled or fried  
  
Just eat it Eat it  
Dont you make me repeat it
