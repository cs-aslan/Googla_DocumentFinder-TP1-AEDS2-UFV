One day soon its gonna happen just by chance  
You and I will just succumb to this romance  
On that day my love will find you  
And youll discover what a wonder life can be  
And you will know how much I love you  
If we were lovers  
If we were more than just good friends  
I know how good it could be  
Just by the way youre looking at me  
As if we were lovers if we were lovers  
Ive waited so long for that day  
I think you feel the same way  
You try so hard not to give it away  
Afraid that Ill discover  
What in your heart you know is meant to be  
Darlin if you want it to be me  
To be the one to say I want you  
Then Im telling you now  
Gonna find a way somehow to be your lover  
And spend the whole night making love  
Then find its never enough  
Just think what we are giving up  
Every day that were not lovers  
Few times in our lives can we feel this way  
It would be a shame just to throw it away  
Time is slipping by we dont know whats ahead  
I dont want to look back and have any regrets  
One day soon its gonna happen just by chance  
You and I will just succumb to this romance  
On that day my love will find you  
And youll discover what a wonder life can be  
And you will know how much I love you  
On that day my love will find you  
And youll discover what a wonder life can be  
And you will know how much I love you  
How much I love you
