Friends may often come to you  
With idle gossip  
Should they say our love through  
Thats idle gossip  
  
Let the rumors come and go  
Well prove to everyone  
We still carry on as though  
Our love affair has just begun  
  
Now and then lets stop and kiss  
When we love walking  
Someones sure to notice this  
And theyll start talking  
In their idle gossip  
They may say that I love you  
And this time idle gossip will be true  
  
In their idle gossip  
They may say that I love you  
And this time idle gossip  
Will be true
