Nothing blooms  
In a loveless room  
Youve got to want it  
Youve got to want it  
  
Whos the fool  
Where apathy rules  
Youve got to want it  
Youve got to want it  
  
If you dont want it  
It remains the same  
Its a heart of darkness  
That wants to play that game  
If theres no defiance  
It remains insane  
If its all compliance  
Its a runaway train  
  
Nothing so cruel  
When malevolence rules  
Youve got to want it  
Youve got to want it  
  
There is no defence  
Against pointed arrogance  
Youve got to want it  
Youve got to want it  
  
If you dont want it  
It remains the same  
Its a heart of darkness  
That wants to play that game  
It can be surprising  
When you lose the shame  
And the sun starts rising  
Another day to tame  
  
If your heart is aching  
Just remove the shame  
Youve got to want it  
  
Give your soul a shaking  
And refuse the blame  
Youve got to want it  
  
Whos the fool  
Where apathy rules  
Youve got to want it  
Youve got to want it  
  
If you dont want it  
It remains the same  
Its a heart of darkness  
That wants to play that game  
If theres no defiance  
It remains insane  
If its all compliance  
Its a runaway train
