Your hairs so fair your eyes so dark  
I love you hard as my life  
You pass me by as though I were a stone  
You cut me like a knife  
  
Boy I do I got my eye on you  
Got my eye on you  
  
Im walking down by the waters edge  
Feel like Im coming apart  
Im so afraid of this jealous rage  
Thats taken hold of my heart  
  
And boy I do I got my eye on you  
Boy I do I got my eye on you  
  
Boy Now I Ive reached the end  
End of the line  
Baby heres a kiss  
To remember me by  
  
Boy I do I got my eye on you  
My eye on you  
  
I had a dream I was dressed in white  
The witness swears on the stand  
They caught me cryin in the street last night  
The gun was still in my hand  
  
And Boy I do I got my eye on you  
Boy I do I got my eye on you  
Got my eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
Yes I do babe  
My eye on you
