BY LOVE I MEAN  
  
Ran away would of stay  
But loneliness made me afraid  
My heart decided and my feet obeyed  
Now Im living just to love you  
  
Day again night again  
Im waiting for a ride again  
I need to be inside again  
And a friendly fire to warm me  
  
Chorus  
By love I mean  
Well be alone together  
By love I mean  
I want to spend my life with you  
By love I mean  
I will need or want no other  
Thats what I mean by love  
  
Back again inside again  
Feeling Im alive again  
Got my lover got my friend again  
And I got some pride inside me  
  
Ran away would of stay  
But loneliness made me afraid  
My heart decided and my feet obeyed  
Now Im living just to love you  
  
Chorus
