I know theres nothing to say  
Someone has taken my place  
When times go bad  
When times go rough  
Wont you lay me down in tall grass  
And let me do my stuff  
  
I know I got nothin on you  
I know theres nothing to do  
When times go bad  
And you cant get enough  
Wont you lay me down in the tall grass  
And let me do my stuff  
  
One thing I think you should know  
I aint gonna miss you when you go  
Been down so long  
Ive been tossed around enough  
Awh couldnt you just  
Let me go down and do my stuff  
  
I know youre hopin to find  
Someone whos gonna give you piece of mind  
When times go bad  
When times go rough  
Wont you lay me down in tall grass  
And let me do my stuff
