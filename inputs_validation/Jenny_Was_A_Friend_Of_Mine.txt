We took a walk that night but it wasnt the same  
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain  
She said she loved me but she had somewhere to go  
She couldnt scream while I held I close  
I swore Id never let her go  
  
Tell me what you want to know  
Oh come on oh come on oh come on  
There aint no motive for this crime  
Jenny was a friend of mine  
So come on oh come on oh come on  
  
I know my rights Ive been here all day and its time  
For me to go so let me know if its alright  
I just cant take this I swear I told you the truth  
She couldnt scream while I held her close  
I swore Id never let her go  
  
Tell me what you want to know  
Oh come on oh come on oh come on  
And then you whisper in my ear  
I know what youre doing here  
So come on oh come on oh come on  
There aint no motive for this crime  
Jenny was a friend of mine  
Oh come on oh come on oh come on
