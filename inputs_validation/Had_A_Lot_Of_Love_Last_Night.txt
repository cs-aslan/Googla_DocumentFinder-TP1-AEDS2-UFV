Ah I had a lot of love last night  
Ah  
Ah I had a lot of love last night  
Ah  
Ah  
  
Ive given all my love away and Ive been left with none  
But can you say that Im to blame for loving anyone  
I used to think that I was always older then my time  
Were all breaking promises  who will cry this time  
Were all breaking promises  who will cry this time  
  
Ah I had a lot of love last night  
had a lot a lot of love  
Ah  
Ah  I had a lot of love last night  
had a lot a lot of love  
Ah  
  
Im casting all my dreams hereto  my fish have gone to sea  
And fate no longer has the faith to walk ahead of me  
I always used to think that I was better then my kind  
Were all breaking promises  who will cry this time  
Were all breaking promises  who will cry this time  
  
Ah  I had a lot of love last night had a lot a lot of love  
Ah  I had a lot of love last night
