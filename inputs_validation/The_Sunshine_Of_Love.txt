Where there is sunshine oh thats where you are  
Where there is laughter then you cant be far  
Youre in my dreams every night  
Oh how I long to hold you tight I need you  
Ill follow you dear from here to a star  
Your lips are honey but sweeter by far  
From now till forever Ill keep dreamin of  
You and the sunshine of love the sunshine of love  
Where there is sunshine oh thats where you are  
Where there is laughter then you cant be far  
Yes youre in my dreams every night  
Mmm how I long to ahold ayou tight  
Ill follow you dear from here to a star  
Your lips are honey but sweeter by far  
Yes now until forever Ill keep dreamin of  
You and the sunshine of love
