Johnnys got an addiction  
Hes strung out without conviction  
He was raised with a microwave  
Sticky trashy fast food slave  
  
Hes a junk food junky  
He could be a lot more spunky hunky  
But hes a junk food junky  
Blame it on the food yeah you know its bad  
  
Mother doesnt really know  
Shopping in a glossy show  
Then again her budgets low  
Her health so bad it makes her slow  
Shes a junk food junky  
Shes stressed and very jumpy  
Shes a junk food junky  
Blame it on the food yeah we know its bad  
Blame it on the food yeah we know its bad  
Jennys in a fix  
With her arithmetics  
Poor concentration  
Boys in the classroom cause agitation  
  
Shes a junk food junky  
She could be a lot more fun  
  
But shes a junk food junky  
Blame it on the food yeah  
Blame it on the food yeah  
Blame it on the food yeah  
You know its bad  
You know its bad  
be a d
