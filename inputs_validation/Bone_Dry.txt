Baby wants me to go cold turkey bone dry  
No Jack Daniels no Jim Beam whiskey bone dry  
No stoppin after work for a beer with the guys  
Nothin in the mornin to open my eyes  
Well Im comin down from a permanent high bone dry  
  
I got my doubts if I can make it a bone dry  
Its a crazy world I dont know if I can take it a bone dry  
Its only been an hour Im startin to shake  
Sixty more minutes and I know Ill break  
How much more of this hell can I take bone dry  
  
Well bone dry boy am I dry as a bone  
Howd I ever say Id ever leave it alone  
Break down shake down layin in bed  
Covers are soaked and Im damn near dead and Im bone dry  
  
Baby took a look at her cold turkey bone dry  
I tried to smile but my mouth wasnt working I was bone dry  
This is one promise that Im gonna keep  
Unless I get lucky and die in my sleep  
One way or the other Im gonna be bone dry  
  
Well bone dry why am I dry as a bone  
Bone dry bone dry bone dry
