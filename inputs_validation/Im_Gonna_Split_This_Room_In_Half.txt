I know a guy who took too many pills  
Now hes got a mansion that sits on a hill  
14 million served thats correct  
17 cars 3 cribs and 2 jets  
I came to test to blood sweat tears  
Persevered for ten long years  
10 years I was there for 8  
And I aint seen a meaner mother puttin food on our plate  
Ive learned to hate and thats a damn shame  
Because Im gettin pretty good at this bitch ass game  
See fame aint the problem its broke  
Pissin on my dog cause theyre down on their luck  
Now youre stuck like a pig in the poke  
You know youre makin him mad and youre goin to get choked  
Dont you know every dog has a limit  
Yo Im about to kick somebodys ass in a minute  
  
Chorus  
Im Gonna Split This Room In Half  
Whyd you have to go and get my dog all mad  
Im Gonna Split This Room In Half  
I said Whyd you have to go and get my dog all mad  
Im Gonna Split This Room In Half  
Whyd you have to go and get my dog all mad  
Im Gonna Split This Room In Half  
I said Whyd you have to go and get my dog all mad  
  
Sometimes success leads to stress  
Legal roles and dumb hoes and death threats  
Nat work for network and that works  
And people jerk for perks that aint theirs  
And that hurts you work your whole life  
And that still aint enough  
Cause a bunch of punks wanna poach your stuff  
Thats not your stuff  
So dont touch that  
And dont make me break with this baseball bat cause  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre not playing nice  
My dog likes to share  
Youre going to get smacked for not playing fair  
Its in the air you can feel the tension  
We dont take kind to senseless dissension  
You bark like a dog You fight like a dog  
You live by your dog You die by your dog  
Now theres a calm before the storm  
And Id hate to be you when it starts to get warm  
Clouds are forming Crowds are swarming  
Youve had forwarning Now pray for mourning cause  
  
Chorus x2
