I have heard the big music  
And Ill never be the same  
Something so pure  
Hey  
Just called my name  
I have drowned in the big sea  
Now I find Im still alive  
And Im comin up for ever  
Hey  
Shadows all behind me  
Ecstasy to come  
I have climbed the big tree  
Touched the big sky  
I just stuck my hand up in the air  
And everything came into color  
Like Jazz manna  
From sweet sweet chariots  
I have seen the big mountain  
And I swear Im half way there  
Youll never get there youll never get there  
Youll never get there  
But I will  
I will always climb the mountain  
Because I have heard the big music  
And Ill never be the same  
Something so pure  
Hey  
Has called my name
