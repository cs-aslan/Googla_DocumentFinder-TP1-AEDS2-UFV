He said Ill make your dreams come true in Texas  
And he captured my Appalachian heart  
I was so naive that I believed him  
When he promised wed never be apart  
  
So we packed and pulled a youHaul down to Dallas  
A year went by and the baby came along  
Then his old friends and the night life came between us  
Dreams turned into sleepless nights waiting all alone  
  
Chorus  
Im staring out the window through these teardrops  
Holding on to the only dream that turned out right  
Were on a Greyhound bus bound for West Virginia  
Hes in Dallas without us tonight  
  
Oh Lord I hate to break the news to mama  
Shes gettin on in years and worries so  
Maybe I should have stayed in Dallas  
And gave him another chance right now I just dont know  
  
Chorus  
  
He said Ill make your dreams come true in Texas  
Hes in Dallas without us tonight
