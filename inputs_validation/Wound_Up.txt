Little Carrie Ann what a beautiful girl  
From the moment she was born  
She was always perfect  
Whole town said  Why cant you be more like her  
  
Lights go on and shes ready to spin  
On stage doing all the things shes told to  
Puts on a show in front of the whole damn world  
  
I pray to the heavens to try to save her soul  
Cause that sweet little angel is not the girl I know  
  
Chorus  
She gets wound up  
She gets higher by the minute  
Turns the sound up  
To drown out all the pain  
They all think they know her  
But no one really knows  
That she goes a little crazy sometimes  
  
She parks her car at the top of the hill  
Only inches from the edge  
Where shes almost falling  
Stares at the sky till shes drowning in the rain  
  
Nice dress nice smile  
What a wonderful child  
If they knew all the lies shes told them  
Its too complicated for her to explain  
  
She prays to the heavens to try to save her soul  
Cause the sweet little angel is close to letting go  
  
Chorus  
  
I pray to the heavens to try to save her soul  
Cause the sweet little angel is close to letting go  
  
Chorus
