I never knew why I loved you so much  
Maybe its the way you look at me when you get up in the morning  
I didnt need a shove  
I just fell in love  
With your little baby face  
  
Baby face  
You got the prettiest little baby face  
There isnt another one to take your place  
Baby face  
You got my heart a jumpin  
You sure have started something  
  
Baby face  
Im up in heaven when Im in your firm embrace  
I didnt need a shove  
I just fell in love  
With your pretty little baby face  
  
You got my heart ajumpin  
You sure have started something  
  
Baby face  
Im up in heaven when Im in your firm embrace  
I didnt need a shove  
I just fell in love  
With your pretty little baby face  
Pretty little baby face  
Pretty little baby face
