99  
Ive been waiting so long  
Oh 99  
Where did we go wrong  
Oh 99  
I love you  
  
99  
I keep breaking your heart  
Oh 99  
How can we be apart  
Oh 99  
I love you  
  
I never thought it would happen  
I feel quite the same  
I dont want to hurt you anymore  
I never knew it would work out  
No one to blame  
You know I love you 99  
  
99  
You keep holding my hand  
Oh 99  
They dont know who I am  
  
99  
I cant take it no more  
Oh 99  
Oh we were so sure  
Oh 99  
I love you
