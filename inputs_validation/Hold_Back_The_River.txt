Stop your pretending  
Listen to what Ive got to say  
How your heads went away  
Only here for a day  
And that grave I just made  
Is for me when I get paid  
  
Wont you wait a while  
Move to the blue  
Sometimes people dont want to say  
Old time dancers dont die that way  
See that grave Ive just made  
Its for me when I get paid  
  
Somebodys gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
  
Do you love and surrender  
Sometimes I dont feel I can remember  
I think its fair to mention  
About the days when I get paid  
  
Somebodys gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
Somebodys gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
  
I want a little loving  
I told you all to listen  
But you never liked what you heard  
I take what I am given  
This may sound absurd  
I share a double vision  
That started the transition  
  
Hey wheres Jimmy Jazz  
Steady on the scale  
  
I told you to listen  
I told you all to listen  
  
Somebodys gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
Somebodys gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
  
You know that somebody  
You know that somebody  
You know that somebody  
But it aint you
