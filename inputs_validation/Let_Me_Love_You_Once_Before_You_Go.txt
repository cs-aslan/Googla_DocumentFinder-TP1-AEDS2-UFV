Its like looking in the window of a fine boutique  
Knowing there is nothing that I could ever buy  
Still I want your love so much that I could die  
But I just cant lead a double life  
Being one mans lover one mans wife  
  
But you can start a fire raging  
Just by touching me  
Even though I know were not supposed to touch no  
Oh I never wanted anyone so much  
How I wish that I had found you first  
Dont you see my hearts about to burst  
  
Let me love you once before you go  
Your eyes keep saying yes to me  
So dont keep saying no  
Let me love you once and you will see  
Noones ever gonna love you more than me  
  
Let me lock the door  
Open up all my love to you  
All the love Ive longed to give you since we met  
Its the only chance Im ever gonna get  
And I just cant let it disappear  
Sweet baby please come over here  
  
Let me love you once before you go  
Your eyes keep saying yes to me  
So dont keep saying no  
Let me love you once and you will see  
Noones ever gonna love you more than me  
  
Ahh  
Let me love you once before you go  
Your eyes keep saying yes to me  
So dont keep saying no ahh ahh ahh ahh  
Let me love you once and you will see  
Noones ever gonna love you more than me  
Ahh ahh ahh  
Let me love you once before you go  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Let me love you once ahh ahh  
Ever gonna love
