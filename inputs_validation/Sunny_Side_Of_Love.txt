You hear them people talking  
About the man above  
Theres too much talking trash  
And not enough love  
  
Now I believe in rainbows  
I gotta make it clear  
That I told everyone you know  
That you were my idea  
  
Youre the love of my life and a keeper  
Head over heels and a were falling deeper  
I got a feeling its time and so maybe I got  
That something in mind so baby  
  
Take me to your sunny side of love  
Thats right where we belong  
Take me to your sunny side of love  
  
Youre one of a kind girl  
And I just cant get enough  
A needle in a haystack  
A diamond in the rough  
  
Your perfect imperfections  
You know you got that right  
Its all that loving all day long  
Keeps me up all night  
  
No doubt about it she rhymes for no reason  
Were talking love yeah the kind you know shes in  
You want a kiss and you know that you ought to  
Yeah you cant miss and you know youve got to  
  
Take me to your sunny side of love  
Thats right where we belong  
Take me to your sunny side of love  
You know that it wont take long  
Take me to your sunny side of love  
  
Youre the love of my life and a keeper  
Head over heels and a were falling deeper  
I got a feeling its time and so maybe I got  
That something in mind so baby  
  
Take me to your sunny side of love  
Thats right where we belong  
Take me to your sunny side of love  
You know that it wont take long  
Take me to your sunny side of love
