All night long he calls her snookey ookum snookey ookums  
All they do is talk like babies  
Shes his jelly elly roll  
Hes her sugey ugar bowl  
Hear the way they bill and coo poogywoopoogywoo poogywoo  
All night long he calls her snookey ookums snookey ookums  
All nigh long the neighbors shout Cut it out Cut it out Cut it out  
They cry For goodness sake dont keep us all awake with your snookey ookey
ookey  baby talk
