Under the pillow  
I bury my head and try to shut Chicago out  
As it turns out theres a whole other world of sounds  
Of perfect fifths low skids and Arctic howls  
  
All saying are you going through something  
Are you going through something  
  
Under the pillow a little room to breathe  
The early morning lights a pale cranberry  
I hear the notwowwow  
Of a siren faraway and closing steadily  
  
Saying Are you going through something  
Are you going through something  
Cause IIII I am too  
  
Under the pillow  
I can hear you whisperin are you going through something  
  
Well honey are you going through something  
Are you going through something  
Then IIII I am too  
Then IIII I am too  
  
Then IIII  
  
I am too  
  
Gimme gimme gimme gimmegimme  
Gimme an opportunity gimmegimme  
Put me put me put me put meput me  
In the saddle Ill ride youll see  
  
Theres new work in the Day Room  
I cant lounge online  
Dont you laugh  
Id sell a giraffe and Id give you half  
Just to occupy my mind  
  
Ill be driven my eyes always moving  
Ill be riveted to the task yea  
No smiling Thats important  
I will make my face a mask  
  
And Im thinking just in passing  
What if this song does nothing  
What if this song does nothing  
  
Working in the new New Orleans World  
Im emptying slots working like a ghost  
I move through huge rooms with no windows  
And no Gulf of Mexico  
  
Gimme gimme gimme gimmegimme  
Gimme an opportunity gimmegimme  
Put me put me put me put meput me  
In the saddle please  
  
Ill be driven my eyes always moving  
Ill be riveted to the task yea  
No smiling Thats so important  
I will make my face a mask  
  
And Im thinking just in passing  
What if this song does nothing  
What if this song does nothing  
What if this song does nothing  
What if this song does nothing  
  
Bring on the requisite strangeness  
It always has to get a little weird a little weird  
Yea you just bring on the requisite strangeness  
Bring it on then disappear disappear  
Go to be a man of the boom  
To Florida without the ocean  
But  
Dont you wanna see how it ends  
When the door is just starting to open  
When Athabasca depends  
Dont you wanna see how it ends  
  
I can hear you  
But I cant stay here  
You left me lost in the Barrens  
You left me born on the stairs  
Its minus 11  
Inside my kettle  
I didnt come to get lost in the Barrens  
I didnt come to settle  
To be a man on the moon  
To get my little slice of heaven  
Yeah  
Dont you wanna see how it ends  
When the door is just starting to open  
And Athabasca depends  
Dont ya wanna see how it ends  
  
Dont you wanna see how it ends  
The door is just starting to open  
Athabasca depends  
Dont you wanna see how it ends  
Yeah  
Dont you wanna see how it ends  
Im holding the door to the Barrens  
And Athabasca depends  
Dont ya wanna see how it ends
