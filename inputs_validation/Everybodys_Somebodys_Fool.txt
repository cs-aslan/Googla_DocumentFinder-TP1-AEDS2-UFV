Everybodys somebodys fool  
The world is the biggest school  
As you live you learn though a torch will burn  
Everybodys somebodys fool  
  
You go through life making fools of others  
Pretending youre giving them love  
But remember sister or brother  
You all have to answer to the one you above  
  
Its beautiful to watch love begin  
But oh so sad when it ends  
As you got through life remember this rule  
Everybodys somebodys fool  
  
Its beautiful to watch love begin  
But oh so sad when it ends  
As you got through life remember this rule  
Everybodys somebodys fool
