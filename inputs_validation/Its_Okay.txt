Its okay its okay x4  
You dont have to run and hide away  
Its okay its okay  
I love you anyway  
Its okay its okay  
You dont need to run and hide away  
Its okay its okay  
This is my life this is my chance  
This is my hope in an alleyway  
This is my choice this is my voice  
There may be no tomorrow now  
This is my plea this is my need  
This is my day to be free  
This is my time this is my way  
In a world thats never safe  
Its okay its okay  
You gotta let me run away  
Its okay its okay  
Oh now let me run away  
Its okay its okay  
Youre gonna run and hide away  
Its okay its okay
