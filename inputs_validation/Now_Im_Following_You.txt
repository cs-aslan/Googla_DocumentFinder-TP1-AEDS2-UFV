Lets dance you can do a little twostep  
Ill go anywhere that you step to cause Im following you  
My feet might be falling out of rhythm  
Dont know what Im doing with them but I know Im following you  
  
Unlikely as it is to me on the floor with two left feet  
Lets boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat but whos counting  
Encore once again around the dance floor  
Romance is in the picture too now Im following you  
  
Unlikely as it is to me on the floor with two left feet  
Lets boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat but whos counting  
Encore once again around the dance floor  
Romance is in the picture too now Im following you
