Sometimes the bad guys go right on top  
Sometimes the good guys lose  
We try not to lose our hearts not to lose our minds  
  
Sometimes the bad days may take their grip  
Sometimes the good days fade  
But the rain today hurts the head to drink  
  
But nothing ever stays the same  
Nothings explained  
The harder the we go  
The longer we climb  
  
Cause this isnt the road we know  
So say good night to me  
Lose no more time  
No time  
Cause its been fun  
  
I heard you called me  
From far away far like the king Tut  
Having the voice to make it right  
So I just cry  
  
I fell to stay good  
So been away  
Before I could even see  
Tried once more  
Lost my  and were gone  
But nothing ever stays the same  
Nothings explained  
The longer it takes  
The looser the times  
  
Cause this isnt the road we know  
So say good night to me  
Lose no more time  
No time  
Cause this aint the road  
  
But nothing ever stays the same  
Nothings explained  
The stronger   
The faster   
  
Cause this isnt the road we know  
So say good night to me  
Lose no more time  
No time  
Cause this aint the road  
Cause this aint the road  
Cause this aint the road  
Cause this aint the road  
Cause this aint the road  
Cause this aint the road  
Cause this aint the road  
Cause this aint the road  
Cause this aint the road
