Ive been stopping at green lights  
Got lost on my way home  
Sleep walking at night  
I put my shirt on inside out  
  
Umbrella in the sun  
My head up in the clouds  
My friends just laugh at me  
Theres only one thing it could be  
  
Ive come down with love  
Got bit by the bug  
Im sick and I feel confused  
I know its true  
  
Ive come down with love  
I cant get enough  
I wont break this fever  
I need her Im bit by the bug  
  
Ive come down with love  
Ive come down with love  
  
You got me trippin on my feet  
My mind starts racing  
And my heart forgets beat  
When you start to walk my way  
  
I forget where I am  
Cant find a word to say  
My friends just laugh at me  
Theres no cure for this disease  
  
Ive come down with love  
Got bit by the bug  
Im sick and I feel confused  
I know its true  
  
Ive come down with love  
I cant get enough  
I wont break this fever  
I need her Im bit by the bug  
  
Ive come down with love  
Ive come down with love  
  
Dont need a shot  
Dont need a doctor  
They cant make me ok  
Its up to you  
  
Give me an answer  
Because Im trying just to see you  
Only want to feel you  
Dying just to hear you say  
  
Ive come down with love  
Got bit by the bug  
Im sick and I feel confused  
I know its true  
  
Ive come down with love  
Got bit by the bug  
Im sick and I feel confused  
I know its true  
  
Ive come down with love  
I cant get enough  
Im sick and I feel confused  
I know its true  
  
Ive come down with love  
Got bit by the bug  
I wont break this fever  
I need her Im bit by the bug  
  
Ive come down with love  
Ive come down with love  
Ive come down with love  
Ive come down with love  
Weve come down with love
