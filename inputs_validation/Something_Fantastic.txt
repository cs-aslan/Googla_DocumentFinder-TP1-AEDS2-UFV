Call her Ruth  
Cause she knows the price  
Call her Sandy  
Cause heart is like ice  
You can call her  
Whatever you wish  
Nothing can change  
The person she is  
  
Call her Maria  
Her real names Eve  
Try not to slam the door  
Or youll wake her as you leave  
You can tell by  
The pictures on her wall  
That she never really  
Knew you at all  
  
Everywhere I look  
Its just looking into waste  
I cant see any courage  
Or hope in your face  
You say theres no point  
Of searching anymore  
Cause whatever I find  
Ill have found before  
  
I must be looking  
For something fantastic  
And all this reality  
Its such a test  
You take what youre given  
And Ill take my time  
You in your small corner  
And I in mine
