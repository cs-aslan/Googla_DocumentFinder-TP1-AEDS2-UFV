We come into this Holy place  
To bring a sacrifice of praise  
Bow down before you and seek your face  
  
We sing of the mighty things youve done  
Cry out to you  
Let your will be done  
Tell all the World youre the Holy One  
  
Hear the shouts of praise  
As theyre rising up to you  
Come and fill this place  
As we bring glory to your name  
  
Open up the gates and let the  
King of glory in  
Fill this house with praises as we  
Lift our hands and worship you  
Open up the doors and let your  
Glory fill the earth  
King of heaven we dance before your throne  
  
King of heaven come and  
Take your place  
Dwell among us as we  
Seek your face
