Yeah yeah  
Dont think about it  
Yeah yeah  
Dont think about it  
  
Honey its cold outside  
Pour another glass of wine light up the fireplace  
The holiday starts right now  
Make yourself slow down put on a happy face  
  
I dont want you to buy me nothin its alright  
Loves the only thing on my list  
All I want is a kiss for Christmas  
Wont you give me a kiss for Christmas  
  
Early on Christmas day  
Everyone looks for love under the Christmas tree  
And though you might think its strange  
I wanna tell you my love  
Dont buy a thing for me

Cause if I could just get my wish  
All I want is a kiss for Christmas  
Wont you give me a kiss for Christmas

A kiss for Christmas dont make me wait for love  
This Christmas all that I want is  
A kiss for Christmas
