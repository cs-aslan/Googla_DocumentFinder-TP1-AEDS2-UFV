Well Ive been lying in this dungeon  
Since I was eighteen  
Ten lonely years of my life taken  
Ive been living in the pages of a magazine  
  
It breaks my heart to awaken  
Set me free sleep come free me  
Please please please  
Set me free set me free  
  
Now the state of Alabama says I killed a man  
The jury reached the same conclusion  
I remember I was there with a tire iron  
In my hand the rest is all confusion  
  
Set me free sleep come free me  
Please please please  
Set me free set me free  
  
More like an animal and less like a man  
What they leave you aint worth keeping  
Brother let me tell you  
I got a clock with no hands  
  
The only way out is through sleeping  
Set me free sleep come free me  
Please please please  
Set me free set me free  
  
You get to where you used to be  
Whoever you claim its open to interpretation  
Just remember your number  
And abandon your name  
  
And hold on to your name  
And hold on to your imagination oh no no  
Set me free sleep come free me  
Please please please  
Set me free set me free
