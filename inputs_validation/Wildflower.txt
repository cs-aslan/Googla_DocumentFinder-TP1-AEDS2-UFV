She was the kind of girl that never quite fit in  
Holes in her shoes and freckles on her skin  
Every time she saw those school doors open wide  
Shed wanna turn around and run back home and hide  
  
She got used to being stuck at the back of the line  
The kind that kept her head down  
Most of the time  
Secret dreams bout the boy in the high school band  
And wake up thinking  
She never had a chance  
  
Shes a wildflower  
Thats waitin on a sunny day  
Waitin on the winds of change to blow  
Just a red hot spark thats looking for a little flame yeah  
Trying to find the perfect place to grow  
Shes a wildflower  
  
She makes a wish on every single star she sees  
Yeah somewhere deep down she still believes  
She prays every night before she goes to bed  
Pretty soon her life is gonna change  
She just doesnt know it yet  
  
Shes a wildflower  
Thats waitin on a sunny day  
Waitin on the winds of change to blow  
Just a red hot spark thats looking for a little flame yeah  
Trying to find the perfect place to grow  
Yeah shes trying to find a place  
Shes a wildflower thats waiting on a sunny day  
Shes the secret that nobody knows  
Shes a wildflower shes a wildflower shes a wildflower
