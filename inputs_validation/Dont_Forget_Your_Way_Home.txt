Now you spread your wings to fly  
There are some new things you must try  
No matter where it is you go  
Oh whoa dont forget your way home  
  
I see the leaving in your eyes  
I see no reason I should try  
To hold you back  
And keep you for my own  
Oh whoa dont forget your way home  
  
Chorus  
Many roads may lead you back this way  
And you may change your mind someday  
And when youve missed this life weve known  
Oh whoa dont forget your way home  
  
I guess Ill always feel the same  
Ill always be the keeper of this flame  
And it will burn long after youre gone  
Oh whoa dont forget your way home  
  
Chorus  
  
Darling have you ever cheated on me  
And I said only in my mind
