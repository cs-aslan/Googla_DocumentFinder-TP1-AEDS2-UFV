Lost in the city  
Im movin around  
To the sound of the song  
Ive been living  
  
High altitudes mixed  
With wrong attitudes  
Make me wonder  
Just what Ive been giving  
Why has it taken so long  
Tell me where I belong  
  
Oh oh  
Love can open the door  
Through these eyes I see  
And love has opened this heart  
For me  
  
See you I see you fly high  
All above all of this  
Makes me miss home  
And the freedom  
  
Ive known for so long  
Why has it taken so long  
Tell me where I went wrong  
Oh oh
