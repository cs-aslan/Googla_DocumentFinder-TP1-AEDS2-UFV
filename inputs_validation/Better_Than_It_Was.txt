Once I had it all planned out  
My dirty fingers moved about  
to make a mess of everything around me  
Now I dont claim to know my way  
I still run in circles every dayrunnin around half blind  
Life can be unkind  
But its better than it was  
Its better than it was  
Oh I complain very little because  
its better than it was  
I get to remembering we  
had a lot more money then  
to make a mess of everything around us  
Now that money comes and goes  
a bit faster than my confidence grows  
Everybody knows  
there aint nothin new about money woes  
But its better than it was  
Its better than it was  
Its better than it was  
Its better than we ever could have wished it to before  
It was bad awhile agobetter this I know  
Its better than it was  
Better than it was  
I complain very little because its better than it was  
Better than it was  
Better than it was  
Better than it was
