Not too many years ago  
When dreams were coming true  
Id reach for inspiration  
Sometimes it would be you  
Id hear you on the radio  
I sure did like your sound  
Say its good to know theres still  
A few ol country boys around  
  
From the smoke its hard to tell  
Whats coming down the line  
We heard you were a fast train  
Coming out of Caroline  
We wondered what you were haulin  
When you rolled into to town  
Say its good to know theres still  
A few ol country boys around  
  
You must have felt that same old feeling  
More than once or twice  
Guitars pressed against our hearts  
Under the neon lights  
Ive got to say that feeling is the best that I have found  
Lord its good to know theres still  
A few ol country boys around  
  
Theres a lot of truth you know  
In our kind of songs  
About the life youre living  
And how loves done you wrong  
As long as theres a jukebox  
And a honky tonk in town  
Its good to know theres still  
A few ol country boys around  
  
Its good to know theres still  
A few ol country boys around
