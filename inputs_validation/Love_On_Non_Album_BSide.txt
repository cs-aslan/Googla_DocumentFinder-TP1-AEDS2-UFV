Did you know I can feel your smile  
You and I grow closer all the while  
Cant think of a time when youre more than I love you away  
You are the moon in my night  
Youre the sun in my day  
  
Shine on shine on  
  
Have I told you youre my morning star  
Youre my rainbow youre my Summer shower  
Cant think of a time when youre more than a raindrop away  
You are the moon in my night  
Youre the sun in my day  
  
Shine on  
  
Do my ears deceive me  
Or did you say youd not leave me  
That from now on we could be together  
Closer than a hand is to a glove  
That Im the only one you love  
Its forever  
  
Love on  
  
Instrumental  
  
Do my ears deceive me  
Or did you say youd not leave me  
That from now on we could be together  
Closer than a hand is to a glove  
That Im the only one you love  
Its forever forever forever  
  
Love on forever  
Love on forever
