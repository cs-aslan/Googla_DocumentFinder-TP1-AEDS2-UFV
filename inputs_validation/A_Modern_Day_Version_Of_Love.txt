And the night was filled with laughter  
Echoing through painted smiles  
And I knew each morning after  
I never loved was never touched  
Gave not at all got back as much  
In the cooomfort of  
A modern day version of looove  
  
Truly how Ive cursed the sweet taste  
Of lips that ask soo much of me  
Still I wonder with every embrace  
Could I give and not break  
Should I care and forsake  
All the cooomfort of  
A modern day version of looove  
  
Close my eyes and keep on runnin  
Realise it isnt gonna work anymorore  
For me yeaheah  
Im afraid well maybe thats somethin  
Never cared enough to be afraid of anything  
Before not before   
  
Baffled child on streets of sinner  
Sleeping child a morning call  
Playful spring look face the winter  
Take thy hand taste the kiss  
Leave behind emptiness  
And the cooomfort of  
A modern day version of looove
