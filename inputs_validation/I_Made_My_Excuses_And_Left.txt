Im all alone again  
  
I walked into the room  
Imagine my surprise  
You were sitting close to him  
Staring in each others eyes  
  
Each of you looked up  
But no one said a word  
I felt I should apologise  
For what I hadnt heard  
  
A silence filled the room  
Awkward as an elephant  
In the crowded court of your love  
I was now a supplicant  
  
And clumsy as I felt  
At stumbling on this theft  
To save further embarrassment  
I made my excuses and left  
  
So long ago  
I felt like such a fool  
For crying  
All that I know  
Is when you feel inside  
Youre dying  
It all begins again  
Defying  
Your excuses
