Since ages now were caught and occupied  
With our basic civil rights denied  
They cametoconquer took our beloved world  
Were left to thrive in sorrow and disgrace  
  
Some never knew what freedom was  
Now theres guards everywhere  
Someone come  
Rise up tomorrow to rectify the injustice being done  
  
Raise the noise bring it on  
Ill sing it while youre gone  
Forever and ever  
On with this for as long  
There wont be another song now or whenever  
  
But theyre flawed they crave the sound of our melodies  
Though exposed to complex things just faint  
This way theyre rendered helpless easy prey  
To be grabbed and bound safely locked away  
  
Aldo heres one guy to play the pipe  
Summons mean tunes that kill  
Stadium like set up and verified  
Knock em out with your skill  
  
Raise the noise bring it on  
Ill sing it while youre gone  
Forever and ever  
On with this for as long  
There wont be another song now or whenever  
  
Raise the noise bring it on  
Ill sing it while youre gone  
Now and forever  
On with this for as long  
There wont be another song now or whenever
