Baby you pretend that things aint what they seem  
All this tension telling me just exactly what we should be  
Now I dont mind us being some kind of casual thing  
Listen all I want to do right now is have your contact on me  
  
Chorus  
Can you put your hands my waistline  
Want your skin up against mine  
Move my hips to the baseline  
Let me get mine you get yours  
Hang a please dont disturb sign  
Put my back into a slow grind  
Sending chills up and down my spine  
Let me get mine you get yours  
  
If you see me with a man  
Understand that you cant question me  
The feelings that you call it aint my fault  
It cant help your jealousy  
If you can handle the fact that  
What we have has got to be commitment free  
Then we can keep this undercover lovin comin hittin  
Underneath the sheets  
  
Chorus  
  
Now listen  
So come on and freak my body  
We can get nasty naughty  
All night a private party  
Gotta hit that spot just right  
Work me like a 9 to 5  
It aint about the kissin and huggin  
Cause this is a physical lovin  
Straight sweatin our bodies are rubbin  
Gotta hit that spot just right  
Work me like a 9 to 5  
  
We have a physical thing  
Well make love but dont fall in love  
Let me get mine you get yours  
You spend time  
Just enough so you get yours and I get mine  
No strings attached  
I want your body not your heart  
Let me get mine you get yours  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Come here  
Dont be shy  
I wont bite  
Let me get mine you get yours
