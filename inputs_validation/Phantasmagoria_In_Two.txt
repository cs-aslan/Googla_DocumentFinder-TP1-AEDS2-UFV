If a fiddler played you a song my love  
And if I gave you a wheel  
Would you spin for my heart and loneliness  
Would you spin for my love  
  
If I gave up all of my pride for you  
And only loved you for now  
Would you hide my fears and never say  
Tomorrow I must go  
  
Everywhere theres rain my love  
Everywhere theres fear  
  
If you tell me a lie Ill cry for you  
Tell me of sin and Ill laugh  
If you tell me of all the pain youve had  
Ill never smile again  
  
Everywhere theres rain my love  
Everywhere theres fear  
  
I can plainly see that our parts have changed  
Our sands are shifting around  
Need I beg to you for one more day  
To find our lonely love  
  
Everywhere theres rain my love  
Everywhere theres fear
