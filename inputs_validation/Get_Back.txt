Im spinning out  
I cant control my car  
It doesnt matter  
If you think you might be you are  
I misplace it I dont know where its at  
And I could find it but Id never get it back  
Dont get it back Repeat x2  
The more you want it  
The less youre gonna get back  
Im running out  
I dont know when to stop  
I thought Id wait until  
I saw the penny drop  
It started raining  
Pennies falling in my lap  
And I could spend it  
But Id never get it back  
Dont get it back Repeat x2  
The more you want it  
The less youre gonna get back  
Dont get it back Repeat x2  
The more you want it  
The less youre gonna get back Repeat x3  
Im spinning out  
I cant control my car
