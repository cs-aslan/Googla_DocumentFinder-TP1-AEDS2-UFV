Is the Richard Gere Gerbil story true  
Who came third in World War 2  
Did Sooty sleep with Sue  
These things I think about  
When Im with out with you  
What are the holes in biros for  
Which ones which in the Corrs  
Did Geff Hurst really score  
Coz frankly your a bore  
And Im not  
And if its leavin season your second on the bill  
If you wont leave me baby ill find someone who will  
I tried love Im sorry  
I tried love  
Does God ever get it wrong  
Where has Gary Barlow gone  
Why is Christmas Day so long  
It just goes on and on And on  
Like you  
And if its leavin season your the second on the bill  
If you wont leave me baby ill find someone who will  
I tried love Im sorry  
I tried love  
Do duh duh duh duh duh duh  
Duh duh duh duh  
Do duh duh duh duh duh duh  
Duh duh duh duh  
I tried love Im sorry  
I tried love  
Why is there ketchup on my sleeve  
Do you think Adam fancied Eve  
What if Eve could not conceve  
And he had to breed with Steve  
Wed all be gay  
Laughs
