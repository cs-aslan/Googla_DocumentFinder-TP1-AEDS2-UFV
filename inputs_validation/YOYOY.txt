Why oh why why oh why cant I  
Be in love forever  
Oh why cant I  
Be in love for ever  
And ever and ever  
I wonder  
Why oh why why oh why cant I  
Be in love forever  
  
First thing you know  
Is what youre looking for  
Next thing you know is where you find it  
You cant explain the pain  
Of feelin so alone  
So I wont even try to tell you no  
  
Why oh why why oh why cant I  
Be in love forever  
Oh why cant I  
Be in love for ever  
And ever and ever  
I wonder  
Why oh why why oh why cant I  
Be in love forever  
  
Some days it hurts so bad  
Cant take it anymore  
Those days and nights  
They last forever  
Some ways of feelin good dont feel good anymore  
They only mask your real feelings  
Why oh why why oh why  
  
Halfway up halfway down  
Wont you turn my luck around  
Halfway here halfway there  
Say the words and Ill be there  
  
Why oh why why oh why cant I  
Be in love forever  
Oh why cant I  
Be in love for ever  
And ever and ever  
I wonder  
Why oh why why oh why cant I  
Be in love forever  
  
Be in love forever  
Be in love forever  
Be in love forever
