Im sitting on 2 heads  
  
 some seat I heard some said  
  
Just waiting for sunday  
  
Four days after wednesday  
  
The higher clouds are closing in  
  
To hide the deeds of fertile jim  
  
Could this be a brand new low  
  
One that we cant talk about  
  
One that we cant live without  
  
One that we can join in now  
  
Im standing on 2 feet  
  
Now buried in concrete  
  
Just waiting for sundown  
  
So as to be not found  
  
The higher clouds
