I came along when he broke your heart  
Thats when you needed someone  
To help forget about him  
  
I gave you love with a brand new start  
Thats what you needed the most  
To set your broken heart free  
  
I know you cried and you felt blue  
But when I could I gave strength to you  
Im waiting for the day when you can love again  
  
I kissed your lips  
And when your face looked sad  
It made me think about him  
And that you still loved him so  
  
But you know that pretty soon  
I made you feel glad  
That you belonged to me  
And love began to show  
  
He hurt you then but thats all gone  
I guess Im saying youre the only one  
Im waiting for the day when you can love again  
  
He hurt you then but thats all done  
I guess Im saying youre the only one  
Im waiting for the day when you can love again  
  
You didnt think that I could sit around and let him work  
You didnt think that I could sit around and let watch him take you  
You didnt think that I could sit around and let him go  
You didnt think that I could sit back and let you go  
You didnt think
