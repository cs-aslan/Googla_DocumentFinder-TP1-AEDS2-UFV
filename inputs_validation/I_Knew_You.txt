I knew you before you knew  
Who you wanted to be  
Now I see the new you  
Shes a perfect stranger to me  
  
Loves unkind for I find  
If only saw the best of you  
But my mind not so blind  
Showed my heart the rest of you  
Scheming lies and alibis  
That butter wouldnt melt disguise  
With happy ever after eyes  
That made a fool of me  
  
I knew you before you knew  
Who you wanted to be  
Now I see the new you  
Shes a perfect stranger to me  
Shes a perfect stranger to me  
  
Love is cruel It makes a fool  
Of one who thought we had it all  
All bridges burned the lesson learned  
You never really loved at all  
Now youre gone Im on my own  
Dont come around dont even phone  
Please leave a happy man alone  
And we can both be free  
  
I knew you before you knew  
Who you wanted to be  
Now I see the new you  
Shes a perfect stranger to me  
Shes a perfect stranger to me
