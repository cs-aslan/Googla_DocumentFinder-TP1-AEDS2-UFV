When Captain Jonas Psalter  
Sailed his ship to sea  
Anne Bonny kept him company  
  
The skull and crossbones flew  
Above the ocean blue  
The captains men where a pirates crew  
  
The ships they sought to take  
Were of the Spanish Main  
A gift from Ferdinand of Spain  
  
And though you rob and kill to find your dream  
Your crimes are hardly what they seem  
  
Tortuga held the treasure of a thousand kings  
So Jonas planned to steal everything  
  
Two hundred men stood guard  
Around the fortunes nest  
But Psalters steel slew all the rest  
  
And when the smoke had cleared  
And bloody bodies lay  
Everyone could hear the minstrel play  
  
Woo woo Jonas Psalter  
Youve captured every prize  
There is to dream of in one life  
  
And so we wonder why  
We found you in your bed  
With that bullet in your head
