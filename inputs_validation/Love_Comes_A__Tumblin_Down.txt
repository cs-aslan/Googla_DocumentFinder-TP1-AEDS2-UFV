Tell you a story not a little white lie  
Wasnt long tall sally it was no surprise  
Thats right tell me thats right  
A tough act to follow not too good in your shoes  
A whole lotta shakin was terrible news  
That night tell me thats right  
The band was singin and playin a tune  
Love comes atumblin down oh yeah yeah  
  
All shook up and bent out of shape  
Wasnt Johnny B Goode but it sounded great  
That night tell me thats right  
From the cabaret to the highway of hell  
Had a monkey on his back it was easy to tell  
That night tell me thats right  
The band was singin and playin a tune  
Love comes atumblin down oh yeah yeah  
  
The band was singin and playin a tune  
Love comes atumblin down oh yeah  
  
Im wishing to live longer aided by the supreme healing force of music  
It most definitely overcomes all weakening aspects of the body  
Ive felt quite lost and distraught without those wonderful vinyl productions  
Im convinced its an addiction too I feel just great again  
band get ready  
  
When you see the train come  
Then youll know what to do  
A tough act to follow not too good in your shoes  
Thats right tell me thats right  
love came astumblin and atumblin down  
Not a pretty picture when the body was found  
That night tell me thats right  
  
The band was singin and playin a tune  
love comes atumblin  
Tough act to follow not too good in your shoes  
love comes atumblin  
You see the train come you know what to do  
love comes atumblin  
Johnny b goode it sounded just great  
love comes atumblin  
Long tall sally it was no surprise  
love comes atumblin  
A whole lotta shakin was terrible news  
love comes atumblin  
Not a pretty picture when the body was found  
love comes a tumblin
