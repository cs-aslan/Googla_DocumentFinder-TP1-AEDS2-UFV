Its more than just a feeling  
When it gets inside and takes a hold of you  
You dont want to beat it  
Cause the pain subsides and the hurt is gone from you woah  
  
It makes you kinda wonder  
What are we supposed to do woah  
When the fate of many  
Is guided by the hands of few  
  
Elevating elevating  
  
No more hiding  
Love is elevating love  
Your light rising  
Love is elevating love  
  
You cant fight it  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
You cant fight it  
The love gets high  
Always gets higher  
  
Its more than just a feeling  
And its growing stronger brighter by the day  
You just gotta feel it  
And you just cant doubt it you cant hide the truth woah  
  
All this light and this beauty  
And its shining down all over you woah  
When the fate of many  
Is guided by the hands of few  
  
No more hiding  
Love is elevating love  
Your light rising  
Love is elevating love  
  
You cant fight it  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
You cant fight it  
The love gets high  
Always gets higher  
  
You cant fight it  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher
