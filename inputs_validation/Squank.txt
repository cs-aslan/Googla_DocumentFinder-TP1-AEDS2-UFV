Woman grab your children run and hide  
Dont let it catch up with you  
You gotta fight it to stay alive  
And if it gets you man youre through  
  
It smells so rotten and rank  
Well everybody calls it the squank  
  
Its sick depressing getting bigger all the time  
Dont help it any way you can  
Its grey and brown and sometimes lime  
And its spreading all over the land  
  
And soon well be all breathing out of tanks  
If something aint done about the squank  
  
The meanest thing the worlds ever bred  
By me and you and my kin fold too  
A monster cant live unless its fed  
And its being fed by me and you  
And soon its gonna leave the world blank  
And well all be erased by the squank
