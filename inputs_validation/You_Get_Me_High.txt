Well I dont know  
Just what Im here for  
I want more than words can describe  
Ive been deprived  
Can you believe it  
My whole world  
Well its falling apart  
Well it falls  
Still it falls  
Well it falls apart around me  
  
And you pick me back up  
Oh said you pick me back up  
Oh youre gonna pick me back up  
And you get me high  
Said you pick me back up  
Oh said you pick me back up  
Oh youre gonna pick me back up  
And you get me high  
Cause Im drinking all of the tears you cry  
  
And I dont wish to know my ending  
I just say  
I wanna know when I begun  
I wanna know when I begun  
I wanna know where it started from  
Where it all started from  
Cause I feel like I am spinning  
I feel like Im spinning  
I feel just like Im spinning  
Im spinning around  
Said I feel like I am spinning  
All around the summer  
And the winter comes and another storm  
And it falls  
Well it falls  
Still it falls apart around me  
  
And you pick me back up  
Oh said you pick me back up  
Oh youre gonna pick me back up  
And you get me high  
Oh my my my  
Said you pick me back up  
Oh said you pick me back up  
Oh youre gonna pick me back up  
And you get me high  
  
Im drinking all of the tears you cry  
Breathing every breath that you sigh  
Im drinking all of the that you cry  
That you cry  
All the tears that you cry  
Breathing every breath that you sign
