I find you in my arms this is how it begins  
and we are so close like Siamese twins  
Though youre separate from me and were often apart  
Still nobody can see that were joined at the heart  
Joined at the heart  
Joined at the heart  
Joined at the heart  
  
You dont look like me its true and I dont look like you  
as we lead separate lives our secret still survives  
  
Only we know our special affection  
only we know our secret connection  
  
Now youre back in my arms at the end of the day  
and like Siamese twins with each other well stay  
Though youre separate from me and were often apart  
Still nobody can see that were joined at the heart  
Joined at the heart  
Joined at the heart  
Still nobody can see that were joined at the heart
