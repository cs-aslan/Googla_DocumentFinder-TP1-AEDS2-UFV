Here I am all alone been two days since youve been gone  
Three am wide awake yeah Im lonely and I cant take it  
You win a few you lose a few but I cant help missing you  
Cant sleep at night aint feelin right but Im gonna get to you  
  
Chorus  
Come hell or high water  Im gonna love you  
Come hell or high water  gonna hold you  
Come hell or high water  wrap my arms around you  
Come hell or high water  
  
Now youre gone hurt so bad feelings I have never had  
Been so long since youve been mine now Im wound in the lost and found  
And there you stand now I know Im never gonna let you go  
Aint foolin around no no gonna make every minute count  
  
Chorus  yeah Im gonna get to you  
  
Gonna love you hold you wrap my arms around you  
Baby dont doubt it aint no doubt about it  
  
Im gonna love you  come hell or high water  
Gonna hold you  come hell or high water  
Wrap my arms around you  come hell or high water  yeah  
  
Come hell or high water  come hell or high water  
Come hell or high water  come hell or high water  
Come hell or high water  come hell or high water  
Come hell or high water  come hell or high water
