Well I was thinking that I should of  
But I didnt ever leave you  
But baby Im leaving tonight  
And theres a trucker drinking coffee in the station who can give me a ride  
  
Well I was thinking about heading down to Mobile Alabama  
And that was just last Saturday night  
Well I can leave you if I wanna little baby  
And Im gonna tonight  
  
Cause I got a bucket full of tears  
And a hard luck story  
Theres a bad moon rising behind  
And I swore it to your daddy that I loved you  
  
But I changed my mind  
Well Im a fast talking hell raising son of a bitch  
And Im a sinner and I know how to fight  
And I can leave you if I wanna little baby  
  
And Im gonna tonight  
Cause I got a bucket full of tears  
And a hard luck story  
And theres a bad moon rising behind  
  
And I swore it to your daddy that I loved you  
But I changed my mind  
Well Im a fast talking hell raising son of a bitch  
And Im a sinner and I know how to fight  
  
Cause I can leave you if I wanna little baby  
And Im gonna tonight  
Well I was sitting  
I was drinking on a barstool  
  
Thinking how true love could come as a lie  
And I never should have left you  
But I had to  
And Ill bet you theres a man there with you tonight  
  
And I swore it to your daddy that I missed you  
But I didnt  
If I came back it wouldnt be right  
Cause I can leave you if I wanna little baby  
  
And Im gonna tonight
