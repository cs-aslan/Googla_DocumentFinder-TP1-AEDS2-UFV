Spinning around spinning around  
Oh  
Im spinning around  
Move outta my way  
I know youre feeling me  
cause you like it like this  
Im breaking it down  
Im not the same  
I know youre feeling me  
cause you like it like this  
  
Traded in some sorrow  
For some joy that I borrowed  
From back in the day  
Threw away my old clothes  
Got myself a better wardrobe  
I got something to say  
Im through with the past  
Aint no point in looking back  
The future will be  
And did I forget to mention  
That I found a new direction  
And it leads back to me yeah  
  
Im spinning around  
Move outta my way  
I know youre feeling me  
cause you like it like this  
Im breaking it down  
Im not the same  
I know youre feeling me  
cause you like it like this  
  
The mistakes Ive made  
Have given me the strength  
To really believe  
That no matter how I take it  
Theres no way Im gonna fake it  
cause its gotta be real  
Ive got nothing left to hide  
No reason left to fight  
cause the truths given me  
A new freedom inside  
Getting rid of my desire  
Do you like what you see  
  
Im spinning around  
Move outta my way  
I know youre feeling me  
cause you like it like this  
Im breaking it down  
Im not the same
