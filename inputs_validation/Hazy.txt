When you disapear on me its like parades in the rain  
Every time I see you you just disapear again  
Every time your leavin I dont know what to say  
I wanna see all that damn go away  
  
So would you tell me why your leavin  
Cause I dont know why it has to be so  
So could you tell me Why your leavin  
Cause I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know  
  
All this everlasting love songs come into my eyes  
Every time I see you Im alive Im alive  
  
So could you tell me why your leavin  
Cause I dont know why it has to be so  
So could you tell me Why your leavin  
Cause I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know
