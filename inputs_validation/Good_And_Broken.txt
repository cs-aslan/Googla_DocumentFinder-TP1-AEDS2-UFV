All you overloaded candy coated  
Your lifes imploding now  
Theres a risk worth taking a pain worth aching  
On this hollow ground  
  
We can let go  
Dont hold on to all of lifes hardest parts  
When we think of stopping lets keep on rocking  
To the rhythm of our hearts  
  
We can we can break out of here  
Jump on over there where the air is clearer  
We can we can forget the pace  
Win in our own race become a broken chain yeah  
We are broken chains yeah good and broken  
  
Find the magic go and grab it  
Your fate is in your hands  
Come on find a reason to believe  
And just tell yourself We can  
  
We can we can break out of here  
Jump on over there where the air is clearer  
We can we can forget the pace  
Win in our own race become a broken chain yeah  
We are broken chains yeah good and broken  
  
Get off your seat on your feet  
Raise your hands feel the beat  
Let it go lose control  
Feel it in your soul  
  
Dont you know what you can do  
If you have faith in you  
Lets not be invisible  
Theres no red light in life just go  
  
We can we can break out of here  
Jump on over there where the air is clearer  
We can we can forget the pace  
Win in our own race become a broken chain yeah  
We are broken chains yeah good and broken  
We can we can yeah  
  
Oh we can oh we can oh we can oh we can  
Oh we can  
Oh we can oh we can oh we can oh we can  
Oh we can  
Oh we can oh we can oh we can oh we can  
Oh we can  
Good and broken
