When daylight appears  
Through a crack in the curtain  
Im laying in bed  
Staring up at the skirting  
Im alone in my room  
But someone is turning the key in the door  
And I wake up to find  
Its still daylight outside  
Theres a taste in my mouth  
Like the thoughts in my mind  
And I wake up to find  
That I left on the light the world can take a jump  
Im feeling like a lump when daylight appears  
Through a crack in my mind  
I wont ever go drinking again  
When daylight appears  
Its the third time around  
And I swear I wont drink  
Ever again with that crowd  
What on earth did I say  
Did I let the side down Ive been guilty before  
And I wake up to see  
The old wonderful me  
All naked and wrinkled  
From knots in the sheets  
And I get up to see  
My hair like a tree  
The world can shut the door  
Because Im feeling so sore when daylight appears with my eyes full of sleep  
I wont ever go drinking again  
  
Aaaaah how my heads like an anvil  
Aaaaah go the sparks as I angle  
Aaaaah goes the spray from the shower  
How could I smell like a flower  
When I feel like weed in the rain  
I wont ever go drinking again
