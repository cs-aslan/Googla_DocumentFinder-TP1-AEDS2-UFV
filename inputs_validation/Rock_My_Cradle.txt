Far away from friends and loved ones  
Midst the storm a soldier lay  
Gathered round him all his buddies  
Raised his head we heard him say  
Theres a lamp light in the window  
Where an angel from above  
Gently rocked my baby cradle  
With such tender care and love  
Mother dearest darlin mother  
It would ease this awful pain  
If shed sing until Im sleepin  
Rock my cradle once again  
Neath the palms tonight hes sleepin  
On an island far away  
Though the years pass on in sorrow  
I still recall his words today  
Theres a lamp light in the window  
Where an angel from above  
Gently rocked my baby cradle  
With such tender care and love  
Mother dearest darlin mother  
It would ease this awful pain  
If shed sing until Im sleepin  
Rock my cradle once again
