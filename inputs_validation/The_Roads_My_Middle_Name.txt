I told you once the day we met  
I wouldnt be your queen  
Your little darlin sweet coquette  
Just what my routine  
Youve been around enough to know  
Theres really no one else  
When I hear that siren call baby  
I just cant help myself  
I gotta go  
I hope youll understand  
I love you so  
Want you to be my man  
I hear it call  
Sounds so sweet and plain  
I gotta go baby  
Because the roads my middle name  
Well its hard enough to love someone  
When theyre right close to home  
Dont you think I know its hard honey  
To squeeze the sugar from the phone  
Guess the road is in my blood  
Cause Im my daddys kid  
Just have to learn how to let me go  
Just like my momma did  
I gotta go  
I hope youll understand  
Yeah I love you so  
Want you to be my man  
I hear it call baby  
Sounds so sweet and plain  
I gotta go  
Because the roads my middle name  
Hear it call  
And it sounds so sweet and plain  
I gotta go  
Cause the road is my middle name  
I gotta go  
Cause the road my middle name  
Ooh I gotta go darlin  
Because the road is my middle name
