For you to think of me  
It would only take a minute of your time  
To spare one thought for me  
Would you miss just one minute of your time  
  
When you are far away  
Id like to be part of your time each day  
So think of me  
  
A minute of your time  
Is all it takes to bring us close  
When we are far apart  
  
And if Im on your mind  
I know that theres a chance  
Youll find that Im right there in your heart  
One minute evry day  
May help to keep the wolf away  
Until that moment you are back to stay  
But better still Id like to think you think of me  
Evry minute of your time
