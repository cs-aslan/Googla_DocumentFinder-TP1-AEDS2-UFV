While the world keeps turning round and round  
While I feel I just canT hear A sound  
I hear your name I hear your name  
I try to go back to my usual day  
I try to slip back to my usual ways  
But its not the same  
IM not the same  
Refrain I  
DonT you know that love is the voice  
That whispers each time I try to hide it  
IVe lost all control IM helpless inside  
And youLl see it in my eyes you know  
Chorus  
YouVe taken over me  
My baby now youVe taken over my heart  
YouVe taken over me  
My baby now youVe taken over my heart  
From the start  
IVe never felt this way for anyone  
My security has come undone  
And I feel alive I feel alive  
To A place IVe never been before  
When you came you opened up the door  
And it feels so right it feels so right  
Refrain ii  
I didNt know that love would be here  
But now that youVe come I just canT fight it  
And now itS so clear with this feeling inside  
ThereS no need to ask why because  
Repeat chorus  
Bridge  
Whatever you want is my command now thatS how I feel  
ItS like whatever you wish for I will grant  
And the feeling is oh so real  
Adlib  
Repeat chorus till fade
