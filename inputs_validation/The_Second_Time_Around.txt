with Nicollette Sheridan  
  
There are those wholl bet love comes but once and yet  
Im oh so glad we met the second time around  
  
Love is lovelier the second time around  
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground  
Its that second time you hear your love song sung  
Makes you think perhaps that love like youth is wasted on the young  
  
Loves more comfortable the second time you fall  
Like a friendly home the second time you call  
Who can say what brought us to this miracle weve found  
There are those wholl bet love comes but once and yet  
Im oh so glad we met the second time around  
  
Love is lovelier the second time around  
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground  
Who can say what brought us to this miracle weve found  
There are those wholl bet love comes but once and yet
