The sign says families welcome  
At the Oaks Retirement Home  
But mostly no one comes cept on the weekends  
Ruby Wilson lives in 303  
Where she spends most her time  
But its almost noon on Sunday  
And shes been sitting in the lobby since nine  
  
Shes all dressed up in her best hat and gloves  
Shes all dressed up  
Watching and waiting but nobody comes  
Some days sure are lonely days  
And time can move so slow  
When youre all dressed up  
With nowhere to go  
  
As Ruby watches all the others  
Leaving with their families  
The nurse tells her its time to come to dinner  
She says shes expecting company  
Theyre just running late  
But the nurse knows the truth too well  
She just sighs and walks away  
  
Shes all dressed up in her best hat and gloves  
Shes all dressed up  
Watching and waiting but nobody comes  
Some days sure are lonely days  
And time can move so slow  
When youre all dressed up  
With nowhere to go
