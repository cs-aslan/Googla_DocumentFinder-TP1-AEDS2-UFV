Static static static  
Were on a video rage  
Static static static  
Were on a video rage  
  
Were all blue from projection tubes  
Were all blue from projection tubes  
  
This is the static age we live in  
Our eyes crisscross hold and gaze  
This is the static age we live in  
Breathe in  
Catch your radiation blue disease and turning tossing  
  
This is a static age  
Our very static age  
This is a static age  
  
Static static static  
Were on a video rage  
Static static static  
Were on a video rage  
  
And were all blue from projection tubes  
Were all blue from projection tubes
