Things have been goin wrong long enough to know  
Everything is right  
Been walkin in the dark long enough to know  
Finally seen the light  
Been losin long enough to know when Ive finally won  
And even a blind man can tell when hes walkin in the sun  
  
Ive cried enough tears to know  
This feelings called a smile  
Been bottom rung long enough to know  
When Im doin it in style  
Been runnin so long I know  
Theres no more need to run  
And even a blind man can tell when hes walkin in the sun  
  
Oh the wind is at my back  
And Im sailin on a ship thats overdue  
Well Ive blown so many chances  
I aint gonna blow this one with you  
Ive seen enough bad times to know  
Good times have begun  
And even a blind man can tell when hes walkin in the sun  
And even a blind man can tell when hes walkin in the sun
