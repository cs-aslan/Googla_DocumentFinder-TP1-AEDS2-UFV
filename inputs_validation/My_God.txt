Im Feelin kind of strange  
Im feelin kind of jammed up and out of the way  
I know its all deranged  
And now thats gonna give til Im out of this place  
Look at the horizon  
Want it to the one where is flawless  
Im gonna take your time  
I wanna wonder if you float while the sea is rising  
  
I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know  
I dont know the way you make me feel  
Here we go here we go here we go here we go  
Here we go again  
  
My god  
Your face is so beautiful  
My god  
I see you so clear  
If I could stay with you  
Oh my god  
Ill give my soul  
Theres nothing else my god  
Dont you leave me here  
  
Youre looking for a flower  
Youre looking for a flower but you find a tree  
Im looking for a river  
And suddenly an oceans washing over me  
  
I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know  
I dont know the way you make me feel  
Here we go here we go here we go here we go  
Here we go again  
  
My god  
Your face is so beautiful  
My god  
I see you so clear  
If I could stay with you  
Oh my god  
Ill give my soul  
Theres nothing else my god  
  
I wanted to know you  
Wanted to see you  
Wanted to feel you  
Shouldve believed you  
Wanted to hold you  
Wanted to show you  
Wanted to be you be you  
  
My god  
Face is so beautiful  
My god  
I see you so clear  
If I could stay with you  
Oh my god  
Ill give my soul  
Theres nothing else my god  
Dont you leave me here
