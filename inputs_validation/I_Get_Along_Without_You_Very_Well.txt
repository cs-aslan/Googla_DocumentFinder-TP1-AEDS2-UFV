I get along without you very well  
Of course I do  
Except when the soft rains fall  
And drip from the leaves then I recall  
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms  
Of course I do  
But I get along without you very well  
  
Ive forgotten you just like I should  
Of course I have  
Except to hear your name  
Or someones laugh that is just the same  
But Ive forgotten you just like I should  
  
What a guy  
What a fool I am  
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon  
Whats in store  
Should I phone once more  
No its best that I stick to my tune  
  
I get along without you very well  
Of course I do  
Except perhaps in Spring  
But I should never think of Spring  
For that would surely break my heart in two
