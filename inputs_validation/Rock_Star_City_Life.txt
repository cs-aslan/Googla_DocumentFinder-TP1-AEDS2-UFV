A real bollita

La senorita  
Inside a cage  
Youll find a cheetah  
  
Shes all the rage  
A double feature  
She got that thing take  
The bible from the preacher  
Youll need a sage  
To find that creature  
  
She knows that shes got the look  
And shes gonna play  
She knows that shes got the hook  
And ya gonna pay
