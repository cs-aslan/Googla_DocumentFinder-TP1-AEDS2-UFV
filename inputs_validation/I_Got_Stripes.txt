On a Monday  
I was arrested uh huh  
On a Tuesday  
They locked me in the jail oh boy  
On a Wednesday  
My trial was attested  
On a Thursday  
They said guilty and  
The Judges gavel fell  
  
I got stripes  
Stripes around my shoulders  
I got chains  
Chains around my feet  
I got stripes  
Stripes around my shoulders  
And them chains them chains  
Theyre about to drag me down  
  
On a Monday  
My momma come to see me  
On a Tuesday  
They caught me with a file  
On a Wednesday  
Im down in solitary  
On a Thursday  
I start on bread and water for a while  
  
I got stripes  
Stripes around my shoulders  
I got chains  
Chains around my feet  
I got stripes  
Stripes around my shoulders  
And them chains them chains  
Theyre about to drag me down  
  
I got stripes  
Stripes around my shoulders  
I got chains  
Chains around my feet  
I got stripes  
Stripes around my shoulders  
And them chains them chains  
Theyre about to drag me down
