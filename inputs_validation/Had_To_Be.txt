Had to be  
No escape no room for doubt  
No way out  
Seeing you it was easy to decide  
Cut and dried  
Had to be  
Now we know why we exist  
Dont resist dont even think at all  
Simply fall in love  
This is what  
Had to be  
She was easy to seduce  
Let her loose  
In a world where the fake and shallow shine  
Shell be fine  
Had to be  
Shes a woman nothing more  
Falling for wathever comes along  
Shes so wrong  
A fool to herself  
Had to be  
  
Dont ever tell me  
How to live my life who to love what to do  
And dont try to hold on  
You are in my past I am no longer tied to you  
  
Had to be noone can tell me  
For we get what we deserve how I should live mu life  
Lose your nerver noone can tell me  
And the fates hustle in and take control or take control  
Of your soul  
Had to be  
But the spark of hope remains  
Adn sustains the echo of a smile  
sustains the echo of a smile  
For a while noone can tell me  
Were fools to ourselves have to be  
noone has told me  
Were fools it had to be  
To ourselves  
Had to be  
You are the reason  
I am in this world  
I will be all you need  
You wont come to grief now  
Youre my every thought every word and my every deed  
  
Had to be you are the reason  
For we get what we deserve who I am in this world  
Lose your nerve You are the reason  
And the fates hustle in and take control Ill take control  
Of your soul  
  
Had to be  
But the spark of hope remains  
And sustains the echo of a smile  
For a while you are the reason  
Were fools  
To ourselfs  have to be you are the reason  
Were fools it had to be  
To ourselves  
Had to be
