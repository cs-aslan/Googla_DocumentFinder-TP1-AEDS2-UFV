Look at the powerful people  
Stealing the sun from the day  
Wish I could do something about it  
When all I can do is pray  
  
Its a lonely afternoon  
With nowhere to go but my room  
And Sunday when theres time  
I think of these things on my mind  
And I dont know  
Where I will go  
  
Look at the ominous people  
Draining the salt from the sea  
Wish I could just stand up and shout it  
Why cant they let goodness be  
  
Oh its a lonely afternoon  
With nowhere to go but my room  
And some day when theres time  
I think of these things on my mind  
And I dont know  
Where I will go  
  
Come on you world wont you give a damn  
Turn on some lights and see this garbage can  
Time is the essence if we plan to stay  
Death is in stride when filth is the pride of our home  
Wish I could just stand up and shout it  
Why cant they let goodness be  
  
Oh its a lonely afternoon  
With nowhere to go but my room  
And Sunday when theres time  
I think of these things on my mind  
  
Oh and Monday theres no time  
So I close both my eyes and Im blind  
And I dont care where oh where is my prayer
