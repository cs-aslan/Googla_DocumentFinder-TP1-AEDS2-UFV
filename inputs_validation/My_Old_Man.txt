My old man  
Hes a singer in the park  
Hes a walker in the rain  
Hes a dancer in the dark  
We dont need no piece of paper  
From the city hall  
Keeping us tied and true  
My old man  
Keeping away my blues  
  
Hes my sunshine in the morning  
Hes my fireworks at the end of the day  
Hes the warmest chord I ever heard  
Play that warm chord play and stay baby  
We dont need no piece of paper  
From the city hall  
Keeping us tied and true  
My old man  
Keeping away my blues  
  
But when hes gone  
Me and them lonesome blues collide  
The beds too big  
The frying pans too wide  
  
Then he comes home  
And he takes me in his loving arms  
And he tells me all his troubles  
And he tells me all my charms  
We dont need no piece of paper  
From the city hall  
Keeping us tied and true  
No my old man  
Keeping away my blues  
  
But when hes gone  
Me and them lonesome blues collide  
The beds too big  
The frying pans too wide  
  
My old man  
Hes a singer in the park  
Hes a walker in the rain  
Hes a dancer in the dark  
We dont need no piece of paper  
From the city hall  
Keeping us tied and true  
No my old man  
Keeping away my lonesome blues
