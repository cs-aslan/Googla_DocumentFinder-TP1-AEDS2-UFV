Im through with love  
Ill never fall again  
Said adieu to love  
Dont ever call again  
For I must have you or no one  
Thats why Im through with love  
  
Ive locked my heart  
I keep my feelings there  
I have stocked my heart like an icy Frigidaire  
For I need to care for no one  
Thats why Im through with love  
  
Why did you lead me to think that you cared  
You didnt need me  
For you had your share  
Of slaves around you to hound you and swear  
Their deep devotion emotion to you  
  
Goodbye to spring  
And all it meant to me  
It could never bring the things that used to be  
For I must have you or no one  
Thats why Im through with love  
Thats why Im through with love  
  
Goodbye to spring  
And all it meant to me  
It could never bring the things that used to be  
For I must have you or no one  
And so Im through with love
