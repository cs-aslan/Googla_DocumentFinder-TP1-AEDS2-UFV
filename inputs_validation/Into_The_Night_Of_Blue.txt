Into the night of blue into the night of blue  
  
Havent heard your voice for a long long time  
Still you have me hanging on the line  
Still thinking bout you  
Havent seen a smile upon my face  
And I havent slept a night for days  
I go I go  
  
Into the night of blue  
You dont know what Im going through  
Life is empty and sad without you  
Im living lonely wheres my baby  
Into the night of blue  
I dont know what Im gonna do  
Life is empty and sad without you  
Im living lonely wheres my baby  
  
In my mind are pictures of the past  
Telling me a story meant to last  
Still holding onto  
Days out on the beach out in the sun  
Nights when I was still your only one  
Now I go I go  
  
Into the night of blue  
You dont know what Im going through  
Life is empty and sad without you  
Im living lonely wheres my baby  
Into the night of blue  
I dont know what Im gonna do  
Life is empty and sad without you  
Im living lonely wheres my baby  
  
Funny how these memories  
Only lead me back to you  
They lead me back to you  
I go I go  
  
Into the night of blue  
  
Havent heard your voice for a long long time  
Still you have me hanging on the line  
Now I go I go  
  
Into the night of blue  
You dont know what Im going through  
Life is empty and sad without you  
Im living lonely wheres my baby  
Into the night of blue  
I dont know what Im gonna do  
Life is empty and sad without you  
Im living lonely wheres my baby  
Into the night of blue into the night of blue  
  
Into the night of blue into the night of blue
