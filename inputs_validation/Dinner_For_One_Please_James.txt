Dinner for one please James  
Madame will not be dining  
Yes you may bring the wine in  
Love plays such funny games  
  
Dinner for one please James  
Close Madames room weve parted  
Please dont look so downhearted  
Love plays such funny games  
  
Seems my best friend told her of another  
I had no chance to deny  
You know there has never been another  
Someday shell find out the lie  
  
Maybe shes not to blame  
Leave me with silent hours  
No dont move her favorite flowers  
Dinner for one please James  
  
Maybe shes not to blame  
Leave me with silent hours  
No dont move her favorite flowers  
Dinner for one please James
