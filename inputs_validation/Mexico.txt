One more promise soaked in rye whiskey  
One more word that bites the dust on some bar room floor  
Im the man who travels round doing  
Hey we dont talk about that  
Ill get the favor done for you  
No one will ever know  
  
Then Ill run to Mexico  
  
Cold as stone my eyes fall on another  
Just another name thats runnin through my mind  
At your request Ill do whatever you require  
You give me the light I supply the fire  
  
Then Ill burn for Mexico  
  
Pretty senorita she lies to me  
Smiles sweetly in the morning when I wake up cold sweating  
Cause some day Ill be in the sights  
  
One more call when someone finds a target  
Only guarded whispers never mentions names  
Money on the line will be just fine  
Youll never be involved  
And even if a clue shows youll never know  
  
Cause Ill be in Mexico
