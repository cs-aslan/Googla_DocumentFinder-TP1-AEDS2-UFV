My Monkey  
The World of Madness is a lot Bigger than the World of Sane  
  
I had a little monkey  
I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread  
Along came a choo choo  
Knocked my monkey koo koo  
And now my monkeys dead  
At least he looks that way  
But then again dont we all  
  
Im the Pope Im ten times the pope Im a fifty times the Pope  
But Im the Pope in the hills and in the mountains  
  
I had a little monkey  
I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread  
Along came a choo choo  
Knocked my monkey koo koo  
And now my monkeys dead  
Yeah hes dead  
Poor little monkey  
  
Lying down on the ground with his head stuffed under his arms  
My monkey my monkey my monkey bought the farm  
  
I play music people are affected by the music I play  
That doesnt mean I direct the traffic  
That I put a knife in somebodys hand  
Tell them to go kill somebody  
  
We are our own wicked gods  
With little gs and big dicks  
Sadistic and constantly inflicting a slow demise  
  
Heh heh yeah  
  
I had a little monkey  
I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread  
Along came a choo choo  
Knocked my monkey koo koo  
And now my monkeys dead  
Dead Dead my monkeys dead hes dead  
Now why why  
  
I had a little monkey  
I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread  
Along came a choo choo  
Knocked my monkey koo koo  
And now my monkeys dead  
  
The primates scream of consonance is a reflection of his own minds dissonance
