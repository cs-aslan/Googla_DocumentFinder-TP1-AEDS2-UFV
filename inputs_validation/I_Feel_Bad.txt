I should be out in that driveway stopping you  
Tears should me rolling down my cheek  
And I dont know why Im not falling apart like I usually do  
And how the thought of losing you is not killin me  
I feel bad  
  
That I can stand here strong  
Cold as stone  
Seems so wrong  
I cant explain it  
Maybe its just  
Ive cried so much  
Im tired and Im numb  
Baby I hate it  
I feel bad  
That I dont feel bad  
  
I could let myself be angry over wasted time  
Sad about just throwing love away  
Yeah I almost wish my heart was breakin  
But I cant lie  
All I want to do is turn the page  
I feel bad  
  
That I can stand here strong  
Cold as stone  
Seems so wrong  
I cant explain it  
Maybe its just  
Ive cried so much  
Im tired and Im numb  
Baby I hate it  
I feel bad  
That I dont feel bitter alone  
Its time to I just feel its time  
Its time to move on  
I just got to move on and on and on and on  
  
Yeah  
  
Maybe its just  
Ive cried so much  
Im tired and Im numb  
Oh baby I hate it  
I feel bad  
That I dont feel bad  
No I dont feel bad
