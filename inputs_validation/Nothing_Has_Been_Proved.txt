Mandys in the papers cause she tried to go to spain  
Shell soon be in the dock and in the papers once again  
Vickis got her story about the mirror and the cane  
It may be false it may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
  
Stephens in his dressinggown now breakfasting alone  
Too sick to eat hes on his feet and to the telephone  
The police inspector soothes him with his sympathetic tone  
It may be false it may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
  
In the house a resignation  
Guilty faces every one  
Christines fallen out with lucky  
Johnnys got a gun  
Please Please Mes number one  
  
Its a scandal its a scandal such a scandal  
Now Stephens in the dock for spending money that was earned  
By Christine and the prosecution says that money burned  
A hole in Stephens pocket for expensive sins he yearned  
It may be false it may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
  
In the news the suicide note  
In the court an empty space  
Even Mandys looking worried  
Christines pale and drawn  
Please Please Mes number one  
  
its a scandal its a scandal such a scandal  
Last night he wrote these words to his friend  
Sorry about the mess  
Im guilty til proved innocent  
In the public eye and press  
The funerals very quiet because all his friends have fled  
They may be false they may be true  
Theyve all got better things to do  
They may be false they may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
Nothing  
Nothing has been proved  
Oh nothing  
Nothing  
Oh nothing  
Nothing  
Oh nothing
