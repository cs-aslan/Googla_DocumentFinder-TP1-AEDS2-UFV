She walks over to him and she says  
Do you remember me  
I think we mightve met somewhere before  
Southern Carolina is the place that comes to mind  
But hey I guess you never really can be sure  
  
Oh theres nothing like a true love  
To go and make a fool of someone  
Just like before  
And right there for a minute  
I forgot that you dont love me anymore  
  
Then an old familiar feeling  
Wraps its arms around the moment  
And he says so many times Ive tried to call  
Well youd think its been a lifetime  
Its been two years since Ive seen you  
But it seems just like no times gone by at all  
  
Oh theres nothing like a real love  
To give you back the feel of someone  
Just like before  
And right there for a minute  
I forgot that you dont love me anymore  
  
Oh and how far well travel  
For a place to heal our hearts  
We watched it unravel  
To whys tonight the hardest part  
  
Then he says the weathers changin  
And its icin up the highway  
So I guess its time for me to hit the road  
So she says goodbye and then before  
She knows what she is sayin she says  
I wish you didnt have to go  
  
Oh theres nothing like a true love  
To go and make a fool of someone  
Just like before  
And right there for a minute  
I forgot that you dont love me anymore  
And right there for a minute  
I forgot that you dont love me anymore
