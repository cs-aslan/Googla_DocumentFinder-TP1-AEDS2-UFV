If a baby is born and no one complains  
Then thats good luck runnin through young veins  
And if life is a blessing  
That brushes the tops of the trees  
Well its a short walk in a sweet breeze  
  
I will need you feed you  
Seed you plead with you  
All for a taste of your sweet love Thelma  
  
If the heart is an open memory book  
That was the chance I took  
The more I searched  
The more I shook for Thelma  
  
Last night I slept on a rented pillow  
A silver moon above my head  
A thirsty dreamless sleep released me  
And I reached for the phone by the side of the bed  
  
Now the first time that I saw you I thought  
Shes beautiful but shes too young to be caught  
People aware of my history  
Trying to steer you away from me  
I left a message at your hotel  
Dont let management poison the well  
  
I will need you feed you  
Seed you plead with you  
All for a taste of your sweet love Thelma  
  
The phone is ringing and I realize  
We are time zones and oceans apart  
The words I speak in the middle of my night  
Fall on your yesterdays heart  
  
If the sun dont shine  
If the wind dont break  
If the clock dont jump off the wall  
Thelma my darlin I will cushion your fall  
  
I will need you feed you  
Seed you plead with you  
Without the taste of your sweet love Thelma  
I am only a man who skirted the edge of despair  
For a long time now  
And I dont care  
  
I watch you sleeping in the hospital bed  
The baby curled up in a ball  
Winter sunlight hits the family tree  
And everything else becomes nothing at all
