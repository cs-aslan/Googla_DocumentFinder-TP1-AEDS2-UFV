Limited Edition Bonus Acoustic Live CD Paradise Lost cover  
You live for times of solace  
Within a sign theres a promise  
Dont lose all faith cause you shake at night  
Its in the art of the process  
In another rhyme beyond this place  
The healings fast enough  
Done a thousand times a thousand ways until  
Youve had enough  
Its mercy youre asking for cheating life  
By taking more its mercy youre asking for  
Take my life or give me more  
The loss of prize possession to cure the minds obsession  
Could trade your soul for that normal life  
Elite to all objections  
See beyond all tears and broken years your senses giving  
Up lose all confidence at your expense your courage swallows up
