Whats new  
How is the world treating you  
You havent changed a bit  
Lovely as ever I must admit  
  
Oh whats new  
How did that romance come through  
We havent met since then  
Gee but its nice to see you again  
  
Whats new Probably Im boring you  
But seeing you is grand  
And you were sweet to offer your hand  
I understand adieu  
  
Pardon my asking whats new  
Of course you couldnt know  
I havent changed I still love you so
