No guardian angel looking down on me tonight  
Im on the streets again  
And I cant tell wrong from right  
Im on the run from love  
But I dont know what Im running for  
But it all looks alright when Im standing at your door  
This could be ecstasy  
Ive been dreaming of you  
This could be reality  
Tonight tonight  
Desperate love  
Got no reflection in the mirror anymore  
Im falling backwards  
But I never hit the floor  
Dont give me counterfeits  
I need the real thing  
This aint a game no more  
Im bettin everything  
This could be ecstasy  
Ive been dreaming of you  
This could be reality  
Tonight tonight  
Desperate love  
Yeah desperate love  
I dont feel I should fight  
When you pull me through your door  
You take me to your room  
And show me what Im living for  
And I lose myself  
But my heart keeps poundin  
If you wont take me now  
Dont take me anymore  
Cause I dont read books  
But I know the score  
This could be ecstacy  
Ive been dreaming of you  
This could be reality tonight  
You could be next to me  
Ive been waiting for you  
This could be reality tonight  
Yeah  
I dont feel I should fight  
When you pull me through your door  
You take me to your room  
And show me what Im living for  
And I lose myself  
But my heart keeps poundin  
If you wont take me now  
Dont take me anymore  
Cause I dont need books  
To know the score  
You could be next to me  
Ive been dreaming of you  
This could be ecstasy  
Tonight tonight  
Desperate love  
Yeah  
Desperate love  
Desperate love  
Yeah desperate love  
Ooh yeah  
Desperate love  
Desperate desperate love  
Desperate desperate love  
Love  
Its desperate desperate love
