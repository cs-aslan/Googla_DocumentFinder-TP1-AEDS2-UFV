Do you like true stories I do  
Thats why Im singing this song  
A song about one legged chicken  
Who lives in the straw on the floor in my barn  
I remember the day she was hatched out  
The vet came to see her and said  
She has only one leg shell never grow up  
He said that chick would be better off dead  
I said No lets just let her keep growing  
Well just wait and see how she gets  
Before very long she was hopping  
And pecking and chasing the bugs with the rest  
And now she is a beautiful chicken  
Though she has only one leg  
When I go to see her each morning  
She hops from the nest and she leaves me an egg  
And she cackles  
Do you like true stories I do  
Thats why Ive sung you this song  
The song about the one legged chicken  
Who lives on the floor in my barn
