  
  
Get at em boys go back home  
Back to the girl you love  
Treat her right never wrong  
How mountain girls can love  
  
Ridin at night in a high cold wind  
On the trail of the old lonesome pine  
Thinking of you baby  
Feelin so blue  
Wondering why I left you behind  
  
Get at em boys go back home  
Back to the girl you love  
Treat her right never wrong  
How mountain girls can love  
  
Theres a lake in the hill  
Where my true love goes  
Thats when shes thinkin of me  
Why Im not there only heaven knows  
Heaven knows thats where Id rather be  
  
Get at em boys go back home  
Back to the girl you love  
Treat her right never wrong  
How mountain girls can love
