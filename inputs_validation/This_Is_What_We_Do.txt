Teenage mutant ninja turtle  
On a half shell theyre the heroes four  
In this day and age who could ask for more  
The crime wave is high with muggings mysterious  
Our police and detective are furious  
Cause they cant find the source  
Of this lethally evil force  
This is serious so give me a quarter  
I was a witness get me a reporter  
Call April ONeil in on this case and  
Youd better hurry up theres no time to waste  
We need help like quick on the double  
Have pity on the city man its in trouble  
We need heroes like the lone ranger  
When tonto came pronto when there was danger  
They didnt say theyd be there in half an hour  
Cause they displayed  
Turtle power

Now our miss reporter was hot on the trail  
Determined to put these crooks in jail  
She spied the bad guys and saw what happened  
But before she knew it she fell in a trap and got caught  
Yeah she was all alone  
With no friends and no phone  
Now this was beyond her worst dreams  
Cause she was concerned by some wayward teens  
Headed by shredder they were anything but good  
Misguided unloved they called them the foot  
They could terrorize and be angry youth and  
They mugged the people who needed proof  
Then from out of the dark came an awesome sound  
Shouted Cowabunga as they hit the ground  
From the field of weeds the heroes rescued the flower  
Cause they possessed  
Turtle power

Do you stand for what you believe in  
And find the strength to do whats right  
Thats turtle power  
Heroes on a half shell theyre on a mission  
When theres a battle got the enemy wishin  
That they stayed at home instead of fightin  
These ninja masters with moves like lightnin  
They were once normal but now theyre mutants  
Splinters the teacher so they are the students  
Leonardo Michaelangelo and Donatello  
Make up this group with one other follow  
Raphael hes the leader of the group  
Transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop  
Pizzas the food thats sure to please  
These ninjas are into pepperoni and cheese  
Back to the story its not hard to find  
Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind  
These are the words that their master instructed  
But a letter from shredder has splinter abducted  
That was the last straw spring into action  
Step on the foot now theyre gonna lose traction  
Now this is for real so you fight for justice  
Your shell is hard so you shout They cant dust us four  
Like some old coffee table  
Since you were young youve been willing and able  
To defeat the snake protect the weak  
Fight for rights and the freedom to speak  
Now the villain is showin so you take a stand  
Back to the wall put your sword in your hand  
Remember the words of your teacher your master  
Evil moves fast but good moves faster  
Then light shining for your illumination  
Good versus evil equals confrontation  
So when youre in trouble dont give in and go sour  
Try to rely on your
