Listen  
Baby by the time you get this letter  
Ill be gone  
But I left something for you on the pillow  
Put this tape in  
Press play  
I love you  
  
Its four in the morning Im sitting here at night  
Im writing you this song to say whats on my mind  
Im leaving in an hour and you wont be up in time to say goodbye whoa  
Im putting this on tape baby youre wonderful  
I really mean it babe more than you will ever know  
I wish that I could stay but I gotta go  
Ill be back but in the meantime  
Keep in mind  
  
Chorus  
What you are  
Something too big for words  
And its my pleasure to love you baby for better or worse  
Cause what you are  
A beautiful mother to your kids  
Sometimes it slips my mind so in case I forget  
Girl you are youre better than anything  
I ever had  
You are the perfect love  
Never give you up because you are  
My heart my soul my breath  
Take it all until theres nothing left  
Cause baby you are  
  
Now no man has ever loved his woman  
More than I love you  
Girl you know its true  
And no man can ever say he does his woman better than I do you  
That aint true heres what I do  
Send you freshcut roses every day of the week  
Take you shopping whenever  
More importantly  
Wrap my loving arms around you  
To reassure everything I felt that first night  
I feel it more  
  
Chorus x2  
  
You are  
You are  
You are  
Girl you are  
You are  
You are
