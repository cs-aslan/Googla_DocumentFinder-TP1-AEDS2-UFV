You find a hair on my jacket  
And you know its not mine  
You look at my pillow  
But youre wasting your time  
  
Because Im out of touch with you  
Your smile no longer sings  
Im so out of touch with you  
Now your phone forever rings  
  
You see a code in my book  
And it doesnt ring a bell  
And this girl I am seeing  
Says she really couldnt tell  
  
Because Im out of touch with you  
I have seen another heart  
I was so in love with you  
Love and thanks I can I cant  
  
I wont comb my hair for you anymore  
I wont be in early  
I wont be in late  
I wont be in at all so dont sit in and wait  
  
You hear a howl in the dark  
And you hope that it is me  
But theres no chance  
Now theres no one else to see  
  
Because Im out of touch with you  
Your trap will never be sprung  
Im so out of touch with you  
So the final verse is sung
