Sitting all alone with my whisky on ice  
I wonder why hes not with me tonight  
If the rain be on tonight then I wont sleep  
Im haunted by this loneliness I keep  
  
And its too late to cry cause we left it all behind  
Too late to cry cause theres nothing left defied  
You wont get more than youre living for  
And its too late to cry tonight  
  
It doesnt seem much point in us carrying on  
We pretend to cry but the feelings are gone  
I hear the death man has lost his mate  
The silence that follows him tells me about our fate  
  
And its too late to cry cause we left it all behind  
Too late to cry cause theres nothing left defied  
You wont get more than youre living for  
And its too late to cry tonight  
  
Empty glass before me tells the story in my eyes  
The dimness it has giving me wont let me realize  
That love is more or less the state of mind we go through  
With no guarantee to what it holds me or you  
  
And its too late to cry cause we left it all behind  
Too late to cry cause theres nothing left defied  
You wont get more than youre living for  
And its too late to cry tonight
