How in the hill did this begin  
Like some cruel game we cant seem to win  
It just goes on over and over again  
  
It took the best outta you and me  
I thought we swore wed let this love rest in peace  
Am I wrong  
Didnt we part as friends  
  
How many lifetimes must we live through  
Til were lookin through the eyes of the truth  
  
We are joined at the soul  
With a heart that dont know how to let go  
What does it mean when it dont mean a thing  
When we say goodbye  
But if life is unkind  
And forever aint a place we can find  
Well know how weve tried  
And that forevers just a matter of time  
  
So much love so much pain  
No one to judge no one to blame  
It holds on  
How desperate this need that remains  
  
We know the passion that leads us blind  
Cause the two of us are one of a kind  
  
We are joined at the soul  
With a heart that dont know how to let go  
What does it mean when it dont mean a thing  
When we say goodbye  
But if life is unkind  
And forever aint a place we can find  
Well know how weve tried  
And that forevers just a matter of time  
  
Time after time we stumble and fall  
Past the point of no return  
God knows weve given so much more than our all  
To this lesson we may never learn  
  
We are joined at the soul  
With a heart that dont know how to let go  
What does it mean when it dont mean a thing  
When we say goodbye  
But if life is unkind  
And forever aint a place we can find  
Well know how weve tried  
And that forevers just a matter of time
