Fleeting breath Frailest flesh  
Im a casualty at best  
And so I sink into Your depth  
My only place of rest  
Where earth and wind and sky and sea  
Could never match Your majesty  
From where I stand Im crying out  
Jesus You are life to me  
The treachery of valleys deep  
Has only made me weak  
I clothe this flesh with holiness  
My only place of rest  
Where earth and wind and sky and sea  
Will never match Your majesty  
From where I stand Im crying out  
Jesus You are life to me  
And when I see Your face Ill know  
All the pain and tears will go  
To the bottom of the sea  
Youll forever be holy holy  
Holy4x  
Where earth and wind and sky and sea  
Will never match Your majesty  
From where I stand Im crying out  
Jesus You are life to me  
Holy8x  
When all is fallen You are life to me  
When all is broken You are life to me  
When all is empty You are life to me  
Life to me life to me  
Life to me  
When I am fallen You are life to me  
When I am broken You are life to me  
When I am empty You are life to me  
Life to me life to me  
Life to meLife to me
