You know that I love you my love made me your fool  
The way down deep inside I know you never will be true  
But Ill keep holdin on for life just as long as I can  
Im one mans woman but youre any womans man  
Im one mans woman but youre any womans man  
But I cant let that change me into something I cant stand  
I give you all the love I have but your love is out of hand  
Im one mans woman but youre any womans man  
 piano   
Sometimes I have a notion to get revenge but then  
Since Im in love who cares about the place Ive never been  
When temptation smiled at me back to your arms I ran  
Im one mans woman but youre any womans man  
Im one mans woman
