The reactors down  
I guess for Labour Day today  
Its the first day I aint seen  
A great plume of steam from across the lake  
From across the lake  
Hey thats a morning moon yeah  
  
Im not making strain  
Said Someones paying  
When somethings too cheap  
Somebodys paying something  
You said Some ones paying something  
Under a morning moon yeah  
Say those little things that dont make anyone feel better yeah  
  
It didnt take too much to upset her  
Nothing that could clear the room  
To say one little thing that could make me feel better  
Under this morning moon yeah  
  
The suns a light bulb and the moon is a mirror  
There are times when you can see both the bulb and the mirror  
See the bulb and the mirror  
And thats the morning moon yeah  
Say those little things that dont make anyone feel better  
  
It doesnt take too much to upset her  
Nothing that could clear the room  
Just saying one little thing trying to make you feel better  
Under this morning moon yeah  
Under this morning moon  
  
Morning moon yeah  
Trying to make you feel better  
Nothing too far from the truth
