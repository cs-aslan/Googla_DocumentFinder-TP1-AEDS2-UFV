Now just because your pretty and you think youre mighty wise  
You tell me that you love me then you roll those big brown eyes  
When I saw you last week your eyes were turnin black  
Go find the guy that beat you up  ask him to take you back  
Dont roll those bloodshot eyes at me  
I can tell youve been out on a spree  
Well its plain that youre lyin  
When you say that youve been cryin  
Dont roll those bloodshot eyes at me  
  
I used to spend my money to make you look real sweet  
I wanted to be proud of you when we walked down the street  
Now dont ask me to dress you up in satin and in silk  
Your eyes look like two cherries in a glass of bottled milk  
  
Dont roll those bloodshot eyes at me  
I can tell youve been out on a spree  
Well its plain that youre lyin  
When you say that youve been cryin  
Dont roll those bloodshot eyes at me  
  
So I guess our little romance has finally simmered down  
You should join the circus you make a real good clown  
Your eyes look like a roadmap Im scared to smell your breath  
You better shut your peepers before you bleed to death  
  
Dont roll those bloodshot eyes at me  
I can tell youve been out on a spree  
Well its plain that youre lyin  
When you say that youve been cryin  
Dont roll those bloodshot eyes at me  
  
Dont roll those bloodshot eyes at me
