Know its around I dont have any doubts about that night  
Ill see you get it tonight and if I cant Ill cry and cry  
You wont see me without it and Ill see you tonite  
  
But I know its around I dont have any doubts about that night  
  
Ill see you get it tonight and if I cant Ill cry and cry  
You wont see me without it and Ill see you tonite outside  
See you tonite outside see you tonite  
  
Ill see you get it tonight and if I cant Ill cry and cry  
You wont see me without it and Ill see you tonite outside  
See you tonite outside see you tonite
