Had a bad day dont talk to me gonna ride this out  
My little black heart breaks apart with your big mouth  
Im sick of my sickness Dont touch me youll get this  
Im useless lazy perverted and you hate me  
  
You cant save me you cant change me  
Well Im waiting for my wakeup call and everything everythings my fault  
  
Went to the doctor and I asked her to make this stop  
Got medication a new addiction fuckin thanks a lot  
Had to relapse Im outta rehab ruins everything  
So point your finger at the singer hes in the pharmacy  
  
You cant save me you cant change me  
Well Im waiting for my wake up call and everythings my fault  
You cant save me you cant blame me  
Well Im waiting here to take a fall  
And everything and everythings my fault  
  
And Im a death threat havent slept yet  
Baby why the wake up call  
Im a bad boy tell the tabloids everythings my fault  
  
Whoa whoa yeah write it write it  
Whoa whoa everythings my fault everythings my fault  
  
I went to heaven but couldnt get in for what I have done  
I said Please take me he said Youre crazy you had too much fun  
  
You cant save me you cant change me  
Well Im waiting for my wake up call and everythings my fault  
You cant save me you cant blame me  
Well Im waiting here to take a fall  
And everything and everythings my fault
