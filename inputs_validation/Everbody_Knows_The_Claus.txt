Dont you smell the cookies hes bakin  
Cant you see that belly its shakin  
Dont take a cookie off of that pan  
You dont want to mess with this man  
  
Youve never seen this side of him before  
You know he wont be knockin at your door  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Doin all those good things  
Everybody know the cause  
Here comes Santa Claus  
You know hes the big man  
Dont mess with the boss  
  
Ask Rudolph and he wont steer you wrong  
Santa wasnt this fat all along  
Until he started cookin one day  
Dont try and take that turkey away  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Doin all those good things  
Everybody know the cause  
Here comes Santa Claus  
You know hes the big man  
Dont mess with the boss  
  
Cruisin down the air highway on his sleigh  
Bringing all the presents for the next day  
Dont forget the donuts  
  
His cookies and his milk are his pride  
Or anything that can be deepfried  
Dont get me wrong Santas a nice guy  
But you dont want to get on his bad side  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Doin all those good things  
Everybody know the cause  
Here comes Santa Claus  
You know hes the big man  
Dont mess with the boss
