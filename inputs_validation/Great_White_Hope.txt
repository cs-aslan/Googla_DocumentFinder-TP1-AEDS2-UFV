When I was a young man I had to kick and scratch and claw  
Now its like top gun in the Old West everybody wants me to draw  
If I had known it would be like this I might have given it a second thought  
But if someone had told me to give it up its a line that I wouldnt have
bought  
  
Look at me  
Im the great white hope  
Cant you see  
Im up against the ropes  
Dont you know  
Its so hard to cope  
When you feel  
Like the great white hope  
  
Now youve paid your money youre sitting in your ringside seat  
And I know that some of you out there might want to see the champ get beat  
If I had known it would be like this I might have given it a second thought  
But real life sure isnt like school theres some lessons that just cant be
taught  
  
Look at me  
Im the great white hope  
Cant you see  
Im up against the ropes  
Dont you know  
Its so hard to cope  
When you feel  
Like the great white hope
