History never repeats  
I tell myself before I go to sleep  
Dont say the words you might regret  
I lost beforeyou know I cant forget  
There was a girl I used to know  
Wellshe dealt my love a savage blow  
And I was so youngtoo blind to see  
But anywaythats history  
And I sayhistory never repeats  
I tell myself before I go to sleep  
And theres a light shining in the dark  
Leading me on towards a change of heart  
You say I always play the fool  
I cant go on if thats the rule  
Better to jump than hesitate  
I need a change and I cant wait  
I sayhistory never repeats  
I tell myself before I go to sleep  
And theres a light shining in the dark  
Leading me on towards a change of heartheart  
Never repeatswhoa  
History never repeats  
History never re  
Deep in the night its all so clear  
I lie awake with great ideas  
Lurking about in no mans land  
I think at last I understand  
History never repeats  
I tell myself before I go to sleep  
And theres a light shining in the dark  
Leading me on towards a change of heart  
Yeah
