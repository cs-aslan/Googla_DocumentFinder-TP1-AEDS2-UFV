Oh I can see there aint no room for me  
Youre only holding out your heart in sympathy  
If theres another man then girl I understand  
Go on and take his hand and dont you worry bout me  
  
Ill be blue and Ill be crying too  
But girl you know I only want whats best for you  
What good is all my pride if our true love has died  
Go on and be his bride and dont you worry bout me  
  
Ill be strong Ill try to carry on  
Although you know it wont be easy when youre gone  
Ill always think of you the tender love we knew  
But somehow Ill get through so dont you worry bout me  
  
Oooh baby  
  
Sweetie pie before you say goodbye  
Remember if he ever leaves you high and dry  
Dont cry alone in pain dont ever feel ashamed  
If you want me again just dont you worry bout me  
  
I love you no matter what you do  
Ill spend my whole life waiting if you want me to  
And if this is goodbye you know Id rather die  
Than let you see me cry cause then youd worry bout me  
  
Repeat 2X  
Ill be strong Ill try to carry on  
Although you know it wont be easy when youre gone  
Ill always think of you the tender love we knew  
But somehow Ill get through so dont you worry bout me
