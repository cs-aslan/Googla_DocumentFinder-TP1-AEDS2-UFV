Its never over til its really over  
And someones left standing behind  
It goes without sayin  
Its too late for stayin  
And leavins been comin for a long long time  
  
Chorus  
I packed up my suitcase and started my pickup  
So many times in my mind  
Its a hard road to travel  
From blacktop to gravel  
And the next hill is the hardest to climb  
  
Ive got all the answers for most of the questions  
And some aint been easy to find  
Theres no more erasin  
The things Ive been facin  
And leavins been comin for a long long time  
  
Chorus  
And leavins been comin for a long long time
