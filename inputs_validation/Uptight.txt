Say goodbye to all your friends  
They will miss you when this trends  
I get so uptight I get so uptight  
I get so uptight I get so uptight  
  
Hey Sit tight green light everybodys out at night go  
Why dont you beeline outshine everybody blow your mind go  
Why dont you see what theyre saying its crazy Ive seen it  
Those things they believe in they get hazy I think I mean it  
  
When the current drags me in when the current drags me in  
Leave me to the hands of men leave me to the hands of men  
I get so uptight I get so uptight  
I get so uptight I get so uptight  
  
Hey Sit tight green light everybodys out at night go  
Why dont you beeline outshine everybody blow your mind go  
Why dont you see what theyre saying its crazy Ive seen it  
Those things they believe in they get hazy I think I mean it  
  
Hey Sit tight green light everybodys out at night go  
Why dont you beeline outshine everybody blow your mind go  
Why dont you see what theyre saying its crazy Ive seen it  
Those things they believe in they get hazy I think I mean it
