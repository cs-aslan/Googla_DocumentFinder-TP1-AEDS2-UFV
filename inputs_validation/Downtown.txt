Red pants and the sugarman in the temple street gloom drinkin chivas  
Regal in a four dollar room just another dead soldier in a powder blue night  
Sugarman says baby everythings alright goin downtown down downtown  
  
Montclaire de havelin doin the st vitus dance lookin for someone to chop  
The lumber in his pants how am I gonna unload all of this ice and all this  
Mink all the traffic in the street but its so hard to think goin downtown  
Down downtown  
  
Frankies wearin lipstick pierre cardin I swear to god I seen him holdin  
Hands with jimmy bond sallys high on crank and hungry for some sweets shes  
Fem in the sheets but shes butch in the streets goin downtown down  
Downtown  
  
Its the cool of the evening the suns goin down I want to hold you in my  
Arms I want to push you around I want to break your bottle and spill out all  
Your charms come on baby well set off all the burglar alarms goin downtown  
Down downtown  
  
Red pants and the sugarman in the temple drinkin Chivas Regal in a four  
Dollar room just another dead soldier in a powder blue night red pants turns  
To sugarman and says everythings alright goin downtown down downtown
