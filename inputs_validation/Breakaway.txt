Grew up in a small town  
And when the rain would fall down  
Id just stare out my window  
Dreamin of what could be  
And if Id end up happy  
I would pray  
  
Trying hard to reach out  
But when I tried to speak out  
Felt like no one could hear me  
Wanted to belong here  
But something felt so wrong here  
So I pray  
I could breakaway  
  
Ill spread my wings and Ill learn how to fly  
Ill do what it takes till I touch the sky  
And Ill make a wish  
Take a chance  
Make a change  
And breakaway  
Out of the darkness and into the sun  
But I wont forget all the ones that I love  
Ill take a risk  
Take a chance  
Make a change  
And breakaway  
  
Want to feel the warm breeze  
Sleep under a palm tree  
Feel the rush of the ocean  
Get on board a fast train  
Travel on a jet plane  
Faraway  
And breakaway  
  
Ill spread my wings and Ill learn how to fly  
Ill do what it takes till I touch the sky  
And Ill make a wish take a chance make a change  
And breakaway  
Out of the darkness and into the sun  
I wont forget all the ones that I love  
I gotta take a risk take a chance make a change  
And breakaway  
  
Buildings with a hundred floors  
Swinging round revolvin doors  
Maybe I dont know where they take me  
But gotta keep movin on  
Movin on  
Fly away  
Breakaway  
  
Ill spread my wings and Ill learn how to fly  
Though its not easy to tell you goodbye  
I gotta take a risk take a chance make a change  
And breakaway  
Out of the darkness and into the sun  
But I wont forget the place I come from  
I gotta take a risk take a chance make a change  
And breakaway  
Breakaway  
Breakaway
