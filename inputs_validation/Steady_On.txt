Kicking up the dust heaven or bust  
Were headed for the promised land  
Since the moment we believed weve been eager to leave  
Like a child tugging daddys hand  
May we never forget that patience is a virtue  
Calm our anxious feet so faithful hands can serve you lord  
  
Chorus  
  
We run up ahead we lag behind you  
Its hard to wait when heavens on our mind  
Teach our restless feet to walk beside you  
Cause in our hearts were already gone  
Will you walk with us  
Steady on  
  
We want to walk awhile  
We know that every mile is bringing us closer home  
We want to tell the story  
Of sinner bound for glory and turn to find were not alone  
When we walk in your light the lost will see you better  
As the narrow road gets crowded lord wont you lead us  
  
Chorus  
  
Steady me when the road of faith gets rocky  
Oh ready me for fears I cannot see  
Lord wont you let me be a witness to your promise  
Wont you steady me  
  
Chorus  
  
We run on up ahead we lag behind you  
Its hard to wait when heavens on our minds  
Teach our restless feet to walk beside you  
Cause in our hearts were already gone  
  
Chorus  
  
Will you walk with us  
Steady on
