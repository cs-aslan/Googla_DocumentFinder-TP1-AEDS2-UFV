Well children by and by when the morning comes  
All the saints of God together they come  
We will tell the story how the Lord will come  
And well understand him better by and by  
Trials dark on every hand and we cannot understand  
All the ways God will lead us  
To the blessed promised land  
He will guide us with his eye  
And well follow till we die  
And well understand him better by and by  
Well children by and by when the morning comes  
All the saints of God together they come  
We will tell the story how the Lord will come  
And well understand him better by and by  
Temptations hidden snares often take the sun away  
And our hearts are made to bleed  
For some thoughtless word or deed  
And we wonder why the test when we try to do our best  
But well understand it better by and by  
Well children by and by when the morning comes  
All the saints of God together they come  
We will tell the story how the Lord will come  
And well understand him better by and by  
And well understand him better by and by
