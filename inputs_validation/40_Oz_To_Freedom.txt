Youve got your hair permed  
Youve got your red dress on  
Screamin that second gear was such a turn on  
And the fog forming on my window tells me that the morning here  
And youll be gone before too long  
  
Who taught you those new tricks  
Damn I shouldnt start that talk  
but life is one big question when your starin at the clock  
And the answers always waiting at the liquor store 40 oz to Freedom  
so Ill take that walk  
  
And I know that ohhhh Im not comin back  
Oh not going back  
God knows not going back  
  
You look so fine when you lie it just dont show  
That I know which way the wind blows  
40 oz to freedom is the only chance I have to feel good  
Even though I feel bad  
  
And I know that oh Im not comin back  
Oh not going back  
God knows Im not going back  
God knows Im not going back
