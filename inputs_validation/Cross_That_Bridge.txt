I wasnt born in a lap deluxe  
I didnt have no silver spoon  
We all dream bout mega bucks  
Like wishing for the moon  
They say money just buys you problems  
Bigger taxes jealousy  
Big decisions on what to do with it all  
Thats the kind of problem I mean  
I would cross that bridge when I come to it  
When I come to it  
I wanna get to it  
Gonna cross that bridge when I come to it  
Maybe just around the bend  
Then Im gonna burn that bridge other side of it  
Other side of it  
Greener side of it  
Gonna burn that bridge other side of it  
cause Ill never wanna go back there  
I thought Id been in love  
But its a feeling I cant trust  
cause nine times out of nine I find  
Ive been head over heels in lust  
Married man say loves nothing but trouble  
Like its some kind of terminal disease  
They say loves strange love is blind love hurts  
Well thats the kind of trouble I need  
I would cross that bridge when I come to it  
When I come to it  
I wanna get to it  
Gonna cross that bridge when I come to it  
Maybe just around the bend  
I said never never never never  never  
Never come back again  no  
Never come back again  
They say money cant buy you happiness  
And that true love never runs smooth  
They talk of the trouble and the strife they bring  
Well I dont care cause heres what I would do  
I would cross that bridge when I come to it  
When I come to it  
I wanna get to it  
Gonna cross that bridge when I come to it  
Maybe just around the bend  
Then Im gonna burn that bridge other side of it  
Other side of it  
Greener side of it  
Gonna burn that bridge other side of it  
cause Ill never wanna go back there  
I said never never never never  never  
Never come back again  no  
Never come back again
