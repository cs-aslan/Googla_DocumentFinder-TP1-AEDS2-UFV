Sitting by my stereo all alone  
My baby calls me on the telephone  
She says baby take me out for a dance  
I tell my baby I feel so bad  
I cant go out and its making me sad  
But when you see me I know you will understand  
  
I got hay fever blocking up my head  
Hay fever I ought to be in bed  
How can I dance when I can hardly breathe  
Wish I could cure this infernal allergy  
I got hay fever blocking up my brain  
Hay fever feel the sinus pains  
And all the pills and the powders are in vain  
Thought I was cured but here it comes again  
It goes oohah  
  
The pollen counts getting higher and higher  
My eyes are sore and my nose is on fire  
My throats dry now and Im starting to perspire  
My stuffed up heads killing all of my desire  
I got hay fever you wicked allergy  
Hay fever you put the curse on me  
And Ive inhaled every know remedy  
  
I cant stay cool cause Im starting to sneeze  
I cant make love when I cant hardly breathe  
We start to dance and my nose starts to bleed  
There must be a cure for this hay fever  
Is there a pill or a powder I can take  
I must get a cure for my romance is at stake  
  
Hey fever you tore my image down  
Hey fever I must look like a clown  
I must have used every tissue in town  
Im running round sniffin like a hound  
It goes oohah  
  
I want to kiss but Im sneezin instead  
I cant make love when my head feels like lead  
How can I pose when my nose is all red  
We should be home should be tucked up in bed  
But I got hay fever  
Hay fever  
  
Hay fever  
Hay fever  
Hay fever
