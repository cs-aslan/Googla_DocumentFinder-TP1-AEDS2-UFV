Your scrapbooks filled with pictures of all your leading men  
Well baby dont put my picture in there with them  
Dont make us some little girls dream that cant ever come true  
That only serves to hurt and make you cry like you do  
Well baby dont do it to me and I wont do it to you  
  
You see all the romantic movies you dream and take the boys home  
But when the action fades youre left all alone  
You deserve better than this little girl cant you see that you do  
Do you need somebody to prove it to you  
Well you prove it to me and Ill prove it to you  
  
Now every night you go out looking for true loves satisfaction  
But in the morning you end up settling for just lights camera action  
  
And another cameo role with some bit player youre befriending  
Youre gonna go brokenhearted looking for that happy ending  
Well girl youre gonna end up just another lonely ticket sold  
Cryin alone in the theater as the credits roll  
  
You say Ill be like those other guys  
Who filled your head with pretty lies  
And dreams that can never come true  
Well baby you be true to me  
And Ill be true to you
