While standing at the junction on 42nd Street  
I idly kick a pebble lying near my feet  
I hear a weird noise take a look up and down  
The cause of the commotion is right there on the ground  
Imagine my surprise thought Id left it at home  
But theres no doubt about it its my own tombstone  
  
I went into a shop and bought a loaf of bread  
I sank my teeth into it thought Id bust my head  
I dashed to the dentist said Ive got an awful pain  
The man looks in my mouth and screams This boy is insane  
Imagine my surprise thought Id left it at home  
But theres a lump in my mouth of my own tombstone  
  
I went to see a movie got the only empty seat  
I tried to stretch out in it something blocking my feet  
Finally the lights came up and I could clearly see  
A slab of engraved marble just staring up at me  
Imagine my surprise thought Id left it at home  
But theres no doubt Im sitting on my own tombstone
