Thats all I wanted  
Something special something sacred  
In your eyes  
For just one moment  
To be bold and naked  
At your side  
Sometimes I think that youll never  
Understand me  
Maybe this time is forever  
Say it can be whoh  
  
Thats all you wanted  
Something special someone sacred  
In your life  
Just for one moment  
To be warm and naked  
At my side  
  
Sometimes I think that youll never  
Understand me  
But something tells me together  
Wed be happy oh oh  
  
Baby  
I will be your father figure  
Oh baby  
Put your tiny hand in mine  
Id love to  
I will be your preacher teacher  
Be your daddy  
Anything you have in mind  
It would make me  
I will be your father figure  
Very happy  
I have had enough of crime  
Please let me  
I will be the one who loves you  
Til the end of time  
  
Thats all I wanted  
But sometimes love can be mistaken  
For a crime  
Thats all I wanted  
Just to see my babys  
Blue eyes shine  
This time I think that my lover  
Understands me  
If we have faith in each other  
Then we can be  
Strong baby  
  
I will be your father figure  
Put your tiny hand in mine  
I will be your preacher teacher  
Anything you have in mind  
I will be your father figure  
I have had enough of crime  
I will be the one who loves you  
Til the end of time  
  
If you are the desert  
Ill be the sea  
If you ever hunger  
Hunger for me  
Whatever you ask for  
Thats what Ill be  
  
So when you remember the ones who have lied  
Who said that they cared  
But then laughed as you cried  
Beautiful darling  
Dont think of me  
  
Because all I ever wanted  
Its in your eyes baby  
And love cant lie no  
Greet me with the eyes of a child  
My love is always tellin me so  
Heaven is a kiss and a smile  
Just hold on hold on  
I wont let you go my baby  
  
I will be your father figure  
Put your tiny hand in mine  
I will be your preacher teacher  
Anything you have in mind baby  
I will be your father figure  
I have had enough of crime  
So I am gonna love you  
Til the end of time  
I will be your father  
I will be your preacher  
I will be your daddy whoa  
I will be the one who loves you til the end of time
