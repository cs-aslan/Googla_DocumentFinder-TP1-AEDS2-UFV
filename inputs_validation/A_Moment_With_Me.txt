You choose drawn curtains instead of light  
Your airy demeanor becomes polite  
All the things you adore dont mean all that much anymore  
Well theres really no mystery  
You just need someone to listen  
So come and spend a moment with me  
  
It isnt so easy to walk alone  
Especially knowing youre on your own  
The secret youve kept so well is much better with someone to tell  
We can speak confidentially  
Ill tell you what youve been missing  
Come and spend a moment with me  
  
You feel your heartache as bad as its been  
Its finally beaten you down  
You dont want to partake but you want to win  
And theres no other party in town  
  
Its much too early to say goodnight  
Just one more moment and you just might  
See that a moment with me is more than you thought it could be  
We dont have to make history  
We can start with some kisses  
Come and spend a moment with me
