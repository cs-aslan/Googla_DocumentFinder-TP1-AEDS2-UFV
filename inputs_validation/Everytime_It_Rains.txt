I see dark clouds out my window  
I know the storm is coming any minute  
And the thunder just confirms my fears  
And I know the tears are in it  
Ill be cryin unable to stop  
Look here comes the very first drop  
  
Cause every time it rains  
I fall to pieces  
So many memories the rain releases  
I feel you  
I taste you  
I cannot forget  
Every time it rains  
I get wet  
  
Darlin I am still in love with you  
As time passes by it just intensifies  
I know Ill never be with you again  
Ill never find another with that kindness in his eyes  
Ill be trying unable to stop  
Look here comes the very first drop  
  
Cause every time it rains  
I fall to pieces  
So many memories the rain releases  
I feel you  
I taste you  
I cannot forget  
Every time it rains  
I get wet  
  
On sunny days Im all right  
I walk in the light  
And I try not to think about  
The love I live without  
  
But every time it rains  
I fall to pieces  
So many memories the rain releases  
I feel you  
I taste you  
I cannot forget  
Every time it rains  
I get wet  
  
Cause every time it rains every time it rains  
I fall to pieces every memory  
So many memories the rain releases  
I feel you  
I taste you  
I cannot forget  
Every time it rains every time it rains  
I get wet  
  
Cause every time it rains every time it rains  
I fall to pieces every memory  
So many memories the rain releases  
I feel you  
I taste you  
I cannot forget  
Every time it rains every time it rains  
I get wet
