Chorus x2  
All I see is blood and murder my mind state  
Makes it too late for cops in tryin to stop the crime rate  
All I see is blood and murder my mind state  
Murder murder murder and kill kill kill  
  
Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand  
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman  
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands  
The shit is in my hands heres yo life span  
And for what yo lifes worth this money is twice than  
You grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland  
See Im a nice man but money turned me to Satan  
Im thirsty for this green so bad Im dehydratin  
Hurry up with the cash bitch I got a ride waitin  
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin  
I want the whole pie I wont be denied Nathan  
Maybe I need my head inside straightened  
Brain contemplatin clean out the register  
Dip before somebody catches ya  
Or gets ya description and sketches ya  
Then connects you as the prime suspect  
But I aint set to flee the scene of the crime just yet  
Cause I got a daughter to feed  
And two hundred dollars aint enough to water the seed the best thing  
Would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King  
And have the lady at the desk bring  
Money from the safe in the back stepped in wavin the Mac  
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack  
This bitch tried escapin the jack  
Grabbed her by the throat its murder she wrote  
You barely heard a word as she choked  
It wasnt nothin for her to be smoked  
Then I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke  
Just then the pigs bust in yellin Freeze  
But Im already wanted for sellin Kis  
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees  
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees  
I bust shots they bust back  
Hit the square in the chest he wasnt wearin a vest  
  
Chorus  
  
Left the house pullin out the drive backin out  
We were backin out this ladys Jag started blackin out  
Pulled the Mac10 out stuck it in her face  
Shut ya yakkin mouth  
fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp  
Drug her by her hair smacked her up  
Thinkin fuck it mug her while youre there jacked her up  
Stole her car made a profit  
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window  
Like the girl on Set it Off did  
Jetted off kid stole the whip now Im a criminal  
Drove it through somebodys yard dove into they swimmin pool  
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio  
I made it out alive but Im injured badly though  
Parents screamin Son go in and call the police  
Tell em theres a crazy man disturbing all of the peace  
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up  
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff  
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before  
Smashed the window grabbed the Nintendo sixty four  
When they sell out in stores the price triples  
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles  
And collided with an eightyyear old lady with groceries  
There goes the cheese eggs milk and Post Toasties  
Stood up and started to see stars  
Too many siren sounds it seemed like a thousand police cars  
Barely escaped musta been some dumb luck  
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck  
But I think somebody seen me maybe  
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby  
Fuck it I give up Im surrounded in blue suits  
Came out with a white flag hollerin truce truce  
Dont shoot Surrendered my weapon to cops  
Wasnt me  
It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnapps
