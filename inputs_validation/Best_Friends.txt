I know youve been down just as far as a good man can go  
And the hurtins come easy but the healins been slow  
But youre on your way to recovery and youre not alone  
Cause Nancy sure loves you and shes gonna take care of ol Jones  
  
Chorus  
So cry on my shoulder and lets both get over the bad  
Lets chalk it up to just one more bad memory we have  
Friendships the one thing that keeps love from driving us mad  
So cry on my shoulder were the best friends that we ever had  
  
I heard you left Haggard I knew by the words in his song  
And youre wondering if youre right sittin at home all alone  
But I know you still love him cause youre always there when he calls  
And always remember that youre his favorite memory of all  
  
Chorus  
So cry on my shoulder and lets both get over the bad  
Lets chalk it up to just one more bad memory we have  
Friendships the one thing that keeps love from driving us mad  
So cry on my shoulder were the best friends that we ever had
