The moon is bright above  
Oh what a night for love  
And as I hold you near  
I whisper in your ear  
  
I go ape everytime I see you smile  
Im a dingdong gorila and  
I carry on cave man style  
Im gonna bop you on the head  
And love you all the while  
  
Well Im a monkeys uncle  
Whos a cousin to a chimpazee  
Like I was reelin and rockin  
And swingin from a coconut tree  
  
Oh honey cant you see  
You bring out the monkey business in me  
  
Orangotango ringtingtong  
Im related to old King Kong  
Honey wont you say youre mine  
With no hunky dunky monkey shine  
  
When you hold my hand  
Im a prehistoric man  
I go ape  
  
Like a barrel of monkeys  
On an abadaba honey moon  
I go squealin and screechin and howlin  
Like a big baboon  
  
Well baby Ill explode  
If you dont come and kiss me soon  
  
Yeah Ooh  
  
Ohh Honey you know that  
Im gonna be true to you  
Ill keep you in bananas  
and bring you coconuts too  
And well settle down  
In the nearest county zoo  
  
Orangotango ringtingtong  
Im related to old King Kong  
Honey wont you say youre mine  
With no hunky dunky monkey shine  
  
When you hold my hand  
Im a prehistoric man  
I go ape
