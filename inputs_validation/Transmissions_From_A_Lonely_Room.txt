Miles above your circumstance theres water on your mind  
Ive wrestled with convictions and Ive settled with the tide  
Its more or less uncertainty but still you play the game  
A pedicure wont change the score but all of this will fade  
  
So low better get on  
Everythings stopped down  
So slow better get on  
Everythings slowed down  
  
Down  
  
Take a bath with consecrated water from the shrine  
And wash away the mud of all the miles youve left behind  
Triplicates and wedding rings both lethal to obtain  
So batten down the credit cards the devils in the den
