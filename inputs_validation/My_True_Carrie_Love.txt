Chorus  
Singin O lan tickalo Carrie  
O lan tickalo doo  
Singin O lan tickalo Carrie  
My Carries love is true  
  
Theres someone who belongs to me  
My true Carrie love  
And I know that she waits for me  
My true Carrie love  
  
Yes Im returning to her side  
My true Carrie love  
Shell be my apple blossom bride  
My true Carrie love  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres no one  
Who can take her place  
My true Carrie love  
A vision in old fashioned lace  
My true Carrie love  
  
Her lips are sweet as berry wine  
My true Carrie love  
As dainty as a columbine  
My true Carrie love

And when I give my heart to her  
My true Carrie love  
I nevermore will part from her  
My true Carrie love  
  
And every day Ill spend with her  
My true Carrie love  
My life will start again with her  
My true Carrie love  
  
Chorus x3
