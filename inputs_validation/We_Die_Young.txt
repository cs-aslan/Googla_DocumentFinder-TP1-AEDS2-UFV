Scarys on the wall  
Scarys on his way  
Watch where you spit  
Id advise you wait until its over  
Then you got hit  
And you shoulda known better  
And we die young  
Faster we run  
Down down down youre rollin  
Watch the blood float in the muddy sewer  
Take another hit  
And bury your brother  
And we die young  
Faster we run  
Scarys on the wall  
Scarys on his way  
Another alley trip  
Bullet seek the place to bend you over  
Then you got hit  
And you shoulda known better  
Faster we run  
And we die young
