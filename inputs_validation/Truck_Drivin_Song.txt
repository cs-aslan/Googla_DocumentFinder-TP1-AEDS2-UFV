Im drivin a truck  
Drivin a big ol truck  
Pedal to the metal hope I dont run out of luck  
Rollin down the highway until the break of dawn  
Drivin a truck with my high heels on  
  
My diesel rig is northward bound  
Its time to put that hammer down  
Just watchin as the miles go flyin by  
Im ridin twenty tons of steel  
But its sure hard to hold the wheel  
While Im still waiting for my nails to dry  
  
Oh I always gotta check my lipstick in that rear view mirror  
And my pink angora sweater fits so tight  
Im jammin gears and haulin freight  
Well I sure hope my seams are straight  
Lord dont let my mascara run tonight  
  
Because Im drivin a truck  
Drivin a big ol truck  
Smokeys on my tail and my accelerators stuck  
Got these eighteen wheels arollin until the break of dawn  
Drivin a truck with my high heels on  
  
Oh I dont mind when my crotchless panties creep right up on me  
And my nipple rings dont bother me too much  
But when I hit those big speed bumps  
My darling little rhinestone pumps  
Keep slippin off the motherlovin clutch  
  
But still Im drivin a truck  
Drivin a big ol truck  
Headin down the interstate just tryin to make buck  
Wearin feather boas with sequins and chiffon  
While Im drivin a truck with my high heels on  
  
Im drivin a truck  
Drivin a truck  
Got a load to carry and some eyebrows left to pluck  
And Im late for my appointment down at the hair salon  
So Ill be drivin a truck with my high heels on
