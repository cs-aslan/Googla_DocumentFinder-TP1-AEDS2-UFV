Crash on the levee mama  
Waters gonna overflow  
Swamps gonna rise  
No boats gonna row  
Now you can train on down  
To Williams Point  
You can bust your feet  
You can rock this joint  
But oh mama aint you gonna miss your best friend now  
Youre gonna have to find yourself  
Another best friend somehow  
  
Now dont you try an move me  
Youre just gonna lose  
Theres a crash on the levee  
And mama youve been refused  
Well its sugar for sugar  
And salt for salt  
If you go down in the flood  
Its gonna be your own fault  
Oh mama aint you gonna miss your best friend now  
Youre gonna have to find yourself  
Another best friend somehow  
  
Well that high tides risin  
Mama dont you let me down  
Pack up your suitcase  
Mama dont you make a sound  
Now its king for king  
Queen for queen  
Its gonna be the meanest flood  
That anybodys seen  
Oh mama aint you gonna miss your best friend now  
Yes youre gonna have to find yourself  
Another best friend somehow
