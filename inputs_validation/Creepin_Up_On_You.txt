I like the way you walk  
You got a giggle when you talk  
I like the way you talk  
You got a wiggle when you walk  
Nothing you can do sure as one and one is two  
Ill be creepin up on you  
  
Im gonna be your man  
Youd better understand  
Be your pretty little thing  
Your puppet on a string  
Nothing you can do sure as one and one is two  
Ill be creepin up on you  
  
Gonna write a little letter  
Poetry for two  
Send you pretty flowers  
Creepin up on you  
  
Gonna write a little letter  
Poetry for two  
Send you pretty flowers  
  
Gonna take a little time  
Before I make you mine  
But Ill bet you anything  
Youre gonna wear my ring  
Nothing you can do  
Sure as one and one is two  
Ill be creepin up on you  
  
Nothing you can do sure as one and one is two  
Ill be creepin up on you  
  
Nothing you can do sure as one and one is two  
Ill be creepin up on you
