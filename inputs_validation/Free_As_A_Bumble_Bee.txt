Im down and I feel depressed  
Sitting here just waiting  
For next bus travelling  
Downtown  
Its a crying shame  
Isnt it  
The beautiful weather  
If I could have my way  
Well I would not be working  
On a day like this I know what Id like to be  
As free as a bumble bee  
Take a sip from  
Every flower  
Free as a bumble bee  
While away each lazy hour  
What a good life  
Lying laid back  
Like an old railroad bum by the track  
What a good life  
Living outdoors  
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw
