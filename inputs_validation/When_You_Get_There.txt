You wake up in the morning  
And youre not feeling quite the same  
You feel a gentle hand upon you  
But you seem to have forgotten her name  
You put on your clothes  
Youre heading home  
Youre hoping and praying you  
Wont be all alone  
Chorus  
When you get there  
When you get there  
You havent had a chance to think  
About explaining where you slept till noon  
You cant say you were working all night  
Cause its Sunday afternoon  
The truth is too hard  
Youll never come back  
Cause a one night stand is not  
Worth the attack  
Chorus  
When you get there  
When you get there  
Youre walking up to our front door  
As my face comes into view  
You think youve got a pretty good lie  
You say you slept at Mary Lous  
You open the door  
You start telling lies  
But then from the hall  
You hear Mary Lou cry  
Chorus  
When you get there  
When you get there  
When you get there  
When you get there
