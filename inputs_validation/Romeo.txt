My baby wears his heart on his sleeve  
He wears a look on his face that says please please please  
Love it  
Everything he flaunts love it  
Everything he vaunts I just  
Cant hesitate when he wants what he wants  
  
Oh chucka oh chucka oh chucka oh chucka  
And I said oh chucka oh chucka oh chucka oh chucka  
  
Last night he calls me on the telephone  
You know at two in the morning I just want to sleep on  
But hes got a way with words and  
Hes got a way with charm  
And at three in the morning hes back into my arms  
  
And I said oh chucka oh chucka oh chucka oh chucka  
And I said oh chucka oh chucka oh chucka oh chucka

He looks so good the girls stop and stare  
But I soon wanna look with his double dark hair  
Im not gonna let him go  
Im not taking any chance  
Its a one in million mad mad romance
