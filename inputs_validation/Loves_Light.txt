Well I know that no one is to blame  
But do you feel my strength when you call my name  
Cause I feel yours inside  
How could this be more right  
  
And I have travelled through my mind  
Ive given all my dreams up to time  
Tell me what else can I do  
Well Im nothing wothout you  
  
But you you just dont know what to do  
I guess Ill have to lose my love for you  
These feelings cannot stay  
Cause Im withering away  
  
Im withering away  
Withering away  
  
And teardrops are all that I can give  
But do you really know what true love is  
Dont let it slip away  
  
This doesnt happen everyday  
  
And youd have no problems without me  
So take this song as my apology  
But you have closed my eyes  
s light shall never rise  
rise on me  
Shall never rise  
It shall never rise  
  
And Im scared Ill never hold you again  
But I know that no one is to blame
