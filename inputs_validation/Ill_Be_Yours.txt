When I first saw you my heart said yes  
Youd be the one to cure my loneliness  
And so every night I pray  
Pray that some day you will say  
Pray that youll say you love me and then Ill be yours  
  
I see you everyday you say hello  
But I cant say a word  
I love you so  
And so every night I pray  
Pray that some day you will say  
Pray that youll say you love me and then Ill be yours  
  
I love you so but you will never know  
You think Im just a friend that all Ill ever be I know  
  
I just a dreamer its nothing new  
But still I hope someday theyll all come true  
And so every night I pray  
Pray that some day you will say  
Pray that youll say you love me and then Ill be yours  
Say youll love me and then Ill be yours
