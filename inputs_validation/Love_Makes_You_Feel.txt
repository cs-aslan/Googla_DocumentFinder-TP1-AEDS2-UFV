Life isnt what is seems Im forever drifting into dreams  
Such a sad affair to always be drifting into air  
  
But its not what you say or you do  
That makes me feel like I am falling  
Its things that weve both been through  
That makes me feel like I am upside down  
  
And love makes you feel ten foot tall  
Yes love makes you feel ten foot tall  
  
Just a funny thing Im forever drifting into dreams  
Just not the proper thing to always be drifting into dreams  
  
But its not what you say or you do  
That makes me feel like I am falling  
Its things that weve both been through  
That makes me feel like I am upside down  
  
And love makes you feel ten foot tall  
Yes love makes you feel ten foot tall  
  
And it sounds like this
