There used to be a time  
I wore my heart upon my sleeve  
There used to be a time  
Id show my gentle side to anyone  
Through these years of wandering  
I know Ive been deceived  
Through these years of wandering  
  
And every time you try to hurt me  
You know youll only hurt yourself  
And every time you try to hurt me  
I know youll be the one to suffer  
When you think youre hurting someone  
  
A little of you a little of me  
A little of you  
Is hurting someone  
  
Dont tell me Im the only one  
Cause I dont need that space  
Dont ask for love  
Ill throw it back in your face  
All of these promises  
Were only made to break  
All of these promises
