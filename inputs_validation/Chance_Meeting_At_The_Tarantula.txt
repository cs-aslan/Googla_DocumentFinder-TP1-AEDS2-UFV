Hey dont I know you from somewhere  
Yeah it was down in New Orleans  
In one of those backstreet bars in the quarter  
Between Desire and Honalee  
You were dancin with a friend of Michaels  
I remember how we met  
You were talkin to ol Jimmy  
And you lit my cigarette  
  
Chorus  
How come you cant remember  
This is me youre talkin to  
From May through September  
It was all about me n you baby  
It was all about me n you  
  
Well it looks like to me  
That you have conveniently forgotten everything  
This confusion that has surrounded you  
Is this your morality and not your brain  
Youve got a birthmark below your navel  
You wear a size seven and a half shoe  
You got this Rolex watch that I suspect you cobbed  
From that doctor who said he loved you  
  
Chorus  
  
Well you told me that you lived in the wind  
Like a bird who never touched the ground  
And if you did you would surely die without making a sound  
Live lets live thats all you kept sayin  
And our summer was full of life  
Were gonna send them a postcard and show em what its like to be alive  
But I never wanted to leave your side  
No I just couldnt believe that youd lie  
No I never wanted to say goodbye baby  
  
Chorus
