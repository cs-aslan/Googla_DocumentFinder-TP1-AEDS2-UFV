Londons burning Londons burning  
  
All across the town all across the night  
Everybodys driving with full headlights  
Black or white turn it on face the new religion  
Everybodys sitting round watching television  
  
Londons burning with boredom now  
Londons burning dial 99999  
  
Im up and down the Westway in an out the lights  
What a great traffic system  its so bright  
I cant think of a better way to spend the night  
Then speeding around underneath the yellow lights  
  
Londons burning with boredom now  
Londons burning dial 99999  
  
Now Im in the subway and Im looking for the flat  
This one leads to this block this one leads to that  
The wind howls through the empty blocks looking for a home  
I run through the empty stone because Im all alone  
  
Londons burning with boredom now  
Londons burning dial 99999
