Love what have you done Oh wow  
I was sure up to now that she was a friend  
I stayed till the end Dont be a fool again  
I once believed that love was fair  
But I dont anymore She said Im a bore  
My heart hit the floor  
  
Dont be a fool anymore  
Each time around  
I tell myself its the game of love  
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love  
Well Ive decided I cant let nobody hurt me again  
So Ill say to the end  
I just dont want to be a fool Dont want to be a fool  
Said I dont want to be a fool ever again  
  
Whenever a fools in love he doesnt know hes to blame  
Hes caught in the game It all ends up the same  
He doesnt feel the shame He looks at love in a diffrent way  
It breaks his heart evrytime they all turn out strange  
  
But hell never change Hes never gonna change  
Next time around Ill tell myself itll be better than before  
I wont look back  
Therell be no one tearing my heart out anymore  
I just decided I cant let nobody fool me again  
So Ill swear to the end  
I just dont want to be a fool Dont want to be a fool  
Said I dont want to be a fool ever again  
No way I mean no more Never again Oo no never  
I cant be a fool cant be No way No way No way Oo  
I dont want to be I dont want to be a fool No  
I cant love anybody I cant love nobody  
walking on a one way street Any way any way any way no  
If I dont If I dont find somebody somebody body   
thatll be alright with me know I know itll be alright now  
cause I decided not to let nobody kill me again  
So Ill stay to the end  
I just dont want to be a fool Dont want to be a fool  
Said I dont want to be a fool Dont wanna be a fool  
Ever ever again Dont want to be a fool Cant be a fool  
Dont want to be a fool ever again  
I dont want to be a fool Never oh never oh never again  
Dont want to be a fool Cant be a fool
