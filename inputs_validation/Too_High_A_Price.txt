No one lives forever  
So dont waste your time  
Just aint right to walk away  
Roll the dice lay it on the line  
Many roads to travel  
In your search you might find  
That getting there will have no meaning  
If you cant enjoy the ride  
Too high a price that everyones paying  
The world aint so nice trying to survive  
Spending your life takin chances youre given  
Thats always enough to keep the dream alive  
If youre lookin for trouble  
You can bet its gaining from behind  
When you give you get back double  
You cant lose let your heart decide  
Too high a price that everyones paying  
The world aint so nice trying to survive  
Spending your life takin chances youre given  
Thats always enough to keep the dream alive  
No one lives forever  
So dont waste your time  
Just aint right to walk away  
Roll the dice lay it on the line  
Too high a price that everyones paying  
The world aint so nice trying to survive  
Spending your life takin chances youre given  
Thats always enough to keep the dream alive  
Too high a price  
The world aint so nice  
Spending your life takin chances youre given  
Thats always enough to keep that dream alive  
Too high a price  
The world aint so nice  
Spending your life  
Thats always enough  
Too high a price  
The world aint so nice  
Spending your life  
Thats always enough  
Too high a price  
The world aint so nice
