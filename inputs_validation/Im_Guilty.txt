Whenever I get down  
I look to someone else  
I need your love to bring me round  
And so I must confess  
Im guilty  
Of believing you to be  
The better part of me  
I never thought to look around  
In times when more is less  
Im guilty  
Guilty of lovin you  
Cause I need you  
Yes and I want you  
You know you always bring me through  
Im guilty  
And if you want to know  
You really let me down  
But I wont never let you go  
Theres something in my heart keeps sayin  
Theres something in my heart thats sayin  
Youre guilty of lovin too  
And you need me  
Yes and you want me  
And I wont never let you down  
Theres something in my heart keeps sayin  
Theres something in my heart thats sayin  
Youre guilty of lovin too  
Im guilty
