Have I ever told you  
How good it feels to hold you  
It isnt easy to explain  
  
And though Im really tryin  
I think I may start cryin  
My heart cant wait an other day  
  
When you kiss me I just gotta  
Kiss me I just gotta  
Kiss me I just gotta say   
  
Baby I love you  
Come on baby  
Baby I love you  
Baby I love I love only you  
  
I cant live without you  
I love everything about you  
I cant help it if I feel this way  
  
Oh Im so glad I found you  
I want my arms around you  
I love to hear you call my name  
  
Oh tell me that you feel  
Tell me that you feel  
Tell me that you feel the same  
  
Baby I love you  
Come on baby  
Baby I love you  
Baby I love I love only you
