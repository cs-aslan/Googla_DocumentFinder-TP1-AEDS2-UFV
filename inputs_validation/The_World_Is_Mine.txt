Inhale the joy  
Inhale the fun  
Now its time for me to get on top  
Of the world  
  
Inhale the music and the warmth  
The crowd is ready to bring me to the top  
Of the world  
  
Cause the world is mine  
I wont stop this time  
Cause the world is mine  
And Im feeling so divine  
  
Im part of this illusive show  
Time for me to get on stage  
Lights fade  
  
Tomorrow youll be at my feet  
Saturated senses set me free  
Its all I need  
  
Cause the world is mine  
The world the world is mine  
I wont stop this time  
I wont stop this time  
Cause the world is mine  
The world the world is mine  
And Im feeling so divine  
  
Because the world is mine  
I wont stop this time  
The world the world is mine  
I wont stop this time  
Oh no

Cause the world is mine  
The world the world is mine  
I wont stop this time  
I wont stop this time  
Cause the world is mine  
The world the world is mine  
And Im feeling so divine  
  
Cause the world is mine  
The world the world is mine  
I wont stop this time  
I wont stop this time  
Cause the world is mine  
The world the world is mine  
And Im feeling so divine

Cause the world is mine  
The world the world is mine  
And Im feeling so divine  
  
Cause the world is mine  
The world the world is mine  
I wont stop this time

Cause the world is mine  
The world the world is mine  
And Im feeling so divine
