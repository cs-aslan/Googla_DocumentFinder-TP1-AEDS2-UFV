Black Rage is founded on twothirds a person  
Rapings and beatings and suffering that worsens  
Black human packages tied up in strings  
Black Rage can come from all these kinds of things  
Black Rage is founded on blatant denial  
Squeezed economics subsistence survival  
Deafening silence and social control  
Black Rage is founded on wounds on the soul  
  
When the dogs bite  
When the beatings  
When Im feeling sad  
I simply remember all these kinds of things and then I dont fear so bad  
  
Black Rage is founded who fed us self hatred  
Lies and abuse while we waited and waited  
Spiritual treason this grid and its cages  
Black Rage is founded on these kinds of things  
Black Rage is founded on dreaming and draining  
Threatening your freedom to stop your complaining  
Poisoning your water while they say its raining  
Then call you mad for complaining complaining  
Old time bureaucracy drugging the youth  
Black Rage is founded on blocking the truth  
Murder and crime compromise and distortion  
Sacrifice sacrifice who makes this fortune  
Greed falsely called progress  
Such human contortion  
Black Rage is founded on these kinds of things  
  
So when the dogs bite  
And when the ceilings  
And when Im feeling mad  
I simply remember all these kinds of things and then I dont fear so bad  
  
Free enterprise is it myth or illusion  
Forcing you back into purposed confusion  
Black human trafficking or blood transfusion  
Black Rage is founded on these kinds of things  
Victims of violence both psyche and body  
Life out of context is living unGodly  
Politics politics  
Greed falsely called wealth  
Black Rage is founded on denial of self  
Black human packages tied and subsistence  
Having to justify your very existence  
Try if you must but you cant have my soul  
Black Rage is founded on unGodly control  
  
So when the dogs bite  
When the beatings  
And when Im feeling sad  
I simply remember all these kinds of things and then I dont feel so bad
