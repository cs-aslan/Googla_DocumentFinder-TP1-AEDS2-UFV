One more sad tomorrow  
And Im not very good at hiding my sorrow  
Its not the same without you  
So alone and so afraid  
I thought we had it made  
What about us what about the way  
We were so in love when we were together  
I thought youd never leave  
Now I know this time youre gone forever  
  
Chorus  
Only love can break your heart  
Fill you with desire  
And tear you all apart  
Only love can make you cry  
Only love knows why  
  
One more night without you  
Im just trying to pretend that youre coming back again  
You know I never meant to doubt you oh no  
We were young and we were free  
Now I cant believe this has happened to me  
  
What about us what about the way  
We were so in love when we were together  
  
Chorus  
  
Gonna be a long hard road without you  
And theres one thing you should know  
Tell me who will I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
I really dont want you to go no  
  
Tell me who can I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
Baby please dont leave me  
Cant you see you must believe me  
  
Only love can break your heart  
Fill you with desire  
And tear you down the minute that you fall apart  
  
Only love can make you cry  
Only love knows why oh no  
Only love can tear you down  
Only love knows why oh no  
  
Only love will make you cry
