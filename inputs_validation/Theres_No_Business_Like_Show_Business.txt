Theres no business like show business  
Like no business I know  
Everything about it is appealing  
Everything that traffic will allow  
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling  
When you are stealing that extra bow  
  
Theres no people like show people  
They smile when they are low  
Even with a turkey that you know will fold  
You may be stranded out in the cold  
Still you wouldnt change it for a sack of gold  
Lets go on with the show  
  
The butcher the baker the grocer the clerk  
Are secretly unhappy men becauause  
The butcher the baker the grocer and the clerk  
Get paid for what they do but no applause  
  
Theyd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye  
For anything theatrical and why whyy  
  
Theres no business like show business  
Like no business I know  
You get word before the show has started  
That your father died inside of dawn  
Top of that your pa and ma have parted  
Youre brokenhearted but you go on  
  
Theres no people like show people  
They smile when they are low  
Yesterday they told you you would not go far  
That night you open and there you are  
Next day on your dressing room  
Theyve hung a star  
Lets go on with the show
