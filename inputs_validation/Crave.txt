If this aint love  
I guess Ill never know it even if I were as blinded by the light  
If this aint love  
I guess Ill never know it even if it were a give me back my sight  
I will crave you tonight I will crave you come tomorrow  
I will crave you for always time brings me to the truth  
And the truth brings me back to you back to you  
If this aint love  
I guess Ill never know it even if the thunder strikes me down tonight  
If this aint love  
I guess Ill never know it even if you kiss me in the broad daylight  
I will crave you tonight I will crave you come tomorrow  
Ill crave you for always time brings me to the truth  
And the truth brings me back to you back to you  
I will crave you crave you I will crave you  
If this aint love ooh oh  
Crave you  
If this aint love  
I will crave you  
Crave you crave you if this aint love  
Crave you  
This aint love oh  
I will crave you  
This aint love crave you yeah  
Crave you  
This aint love this aint love
