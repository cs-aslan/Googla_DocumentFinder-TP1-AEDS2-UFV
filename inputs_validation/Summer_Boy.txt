Nowhere  
Yeah were going nowhere fast  
Maybe this time Ill be yours youll be mine  
Crazy get your ass in my bed  
Baby youll be just my summer boyfriend  
Summer boy  
  
Chorus  
Lets get lost you can take me home  
Somewhere nice we can be alone  
Bikini tops coming off  
Dont be sad when the sun goes down  
Youll wake up and Im not around  
Ive got to go oh oh oh oh oh  
Well still have the summer after all  
  
Sometimes you might start a fight  
But Im happy pretending were alright alright  
Sun glasses cover up my green eyes  
My martini glistens yeah  
While checking out other guys  
Summer boy  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey there summer boy  
Lets go for a drive  
Take me for a ride  
Never gonna close our eyes  
  
Hey there summer boy  
Im a busy girl  
Dont got too much time  
Hurry up before I change my mind  
  
Hey there summer boy  
Im taking off my heels  
Lets go for a run  
Have a little summer fun  
Have a little summer fun  
Summer boy  
  
Lets get lost you can take me home  
Somewhere nice we can be alone  
Bikini tops poppin off  
Dont be sad when the sun goes down  
Youll wake up and Im not around  
Youve got to go oh oh oh oh oh  
Well still have the summer after all  
  
Lets get lost you can take me home  
Somewhere nice we can be alone  
Ive got my summersummer boy  
  
Dont be sad when the sun goes down
