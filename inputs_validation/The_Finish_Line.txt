Hello friend its been too long and every town sings the same sad song  
Without you here this hotel year  
will sure slow down with so much left to hear  
  
Lets take back down that highway now  
Blast stereos loud  
Lets take back down that highway now  
  
The finish line is almost here  
And someone softly whispers in my ear  
Times like these are memories  
to hold deep down inside of you and me  
  
Lets take back down that highway now  
Blast stereos loud  
Lets take back down that highway now  
  
Im not leaving you  
Im not leaving  
Im not leaving you  
Goodbye friend it wont be long  
Im not leaving  
And until then well sing the same sad song  
  
Same sad song  
  
Lets take back down that highway now  
Blast stereos loud  
Lets take back down that highway now
