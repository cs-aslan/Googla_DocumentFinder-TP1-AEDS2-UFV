I never really thought Id want to know  
I never thought Id end this stand but you know  
Its hard for me to just ignore  
Oh its just a matter of time  
Before I take your phone and Ill call everyone you know  
So hate me for letting go  
But youll leave me if I try to stay  
  
Oh give it up give it up Jessica  
Oh wont you just let me go  
All the secrets you keep  
And the words that you speak  
Mean more to me than youll know  
Oh give it up give it up Jessica  
Oh wont you just let me go  
All the secrets you keep inside  
Mean more to me  
They mean more to me than youll know  
  
Are you living a lie or are you living away  
Does he know he is only just a place to stay  
So lets just stop and rewind  
Before I lose my mind  
Before I dont wanna hear you say  
Its the worst of our types that go  
The worst who stay  
  
Oh give it up give it up Jessica  
Oh wont you just let me go  
All the secrets you keep  
And the words that you speak  
Mean more to me than youll know  
Oh give it up give it up Jessica  
Oh wont you just let me go  
All the secrets you keep inside  
Mean more to me  
They mean more to me than youll know  
  
You tear apart my mind  
And make me wonder where you are  
But I still remember everything  
That happened before dawn  
Im begging you for honesty  
And all youre spitting out are lies  
Do you even have an alibi  
I dont know I dont know  
  
Oh give it up give it up Jessica  
Oh give it up give it up Jessica  
  
Oh give it up give it up Jessica  
Oh wont you just let me go  
All the secrets you keep inside  
Mean to more to me  
They mean more to me than youll know  
Oh give it up give it up Jessica  
Oh give it up give it up for Jessica  
All the secrets you keep  
And the words that you speak  
Mean more to me  
You mean more to me than youll know  
More to me  
You mean more to me than youll know
