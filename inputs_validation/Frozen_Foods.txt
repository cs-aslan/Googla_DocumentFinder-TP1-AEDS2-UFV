I met her last night  
I saw her move  
She took my eye  
I had to prove  
That I was cool and she was hot  
Ill tell you what she wore but I forgot  
I had the guts to walk her way  
She didnt move  
I didnt stray  
I have one chance and this is it  
But then I fell right on her left tit  
  
Im just a kid on a branch  
I wish youd come up and dance  
I want a little romance  
Could you please give me a chance  
Im probably last on the list  
But all I want is this wish to come true  
If its you then Ill be down for that too  
  
I saw her next week  
In frozen foods  
I sized her up  
She had the goods  
I tried to walk by with cool reserve  
She probably thinks that Im a perv  
And as I rode by in my squeaky cart  
It occurred to me the supermart  
Is not the best place to get a date  
Maybe at the rollerrink is where Ill find my soul mate  
  
Im just a kid on a branch  
I wish youd come up and dance  
I want a little romance  
Could you please give me a chance  
Im probably last on the list  
But all I want is this wish to come true  
If its you then Ill be down for that too  
  
Its ok cause Counselor Troy tells me  
That my selfesteem is high  
He held me close and tried to tell me  
That Im not like the other guys  
Youre special I like you  
Counselor Troy is like me too  
Maybe thats why I couldnt get the girls Ive wanted to  
  
Im just a kid on a branch  
You should come up and dance  
I want a little romance  
Will you please give me a chance  
Im just a kid on a branch  
I wish youd come up and dance  
I want a little romance  
Will you please give me a chance  
Im just a kid on a branch  
Im just a kid on a branch  
I want a little romance  
I want a little romance  
Im probably last on the list  
Im probably last on the list  
Come true  
If its you  
And Ill be down for that too
