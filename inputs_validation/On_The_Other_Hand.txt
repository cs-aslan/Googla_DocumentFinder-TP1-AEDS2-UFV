On one hand I count the reasons I could stay with you  
And hold you close to me all night long  
So many lovers games I could play with you  
And on that hand I see no reason why its wrong  
  
Chorus  
But on the other hand Theres a golden band  
To remind of someone who would not understand  
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man  
But the reason I must go is on the other hand  
  
In your arms I feel the passion I thought had died  
When I looked into your eyes I found myself  
When I first kissed your lips I felt so alive  
Ive got to hand it to you girl youre something else  
  
Chorus
