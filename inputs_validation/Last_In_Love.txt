Blues outside my door  
I dont even know if its raining  
But Ive been here before  
And I dont wanna be here again  
  
Evry now and then  
voices on the wind  
call me back to the first time  
far away and clear  
you can hear the tear drops  
falling for the last in love  
  
If I let you down  
All I can say is Im sorry  
Now its all over town  
So I dont want to hear it from you  
  
Please dont look away its hard enough to say  
This could go on forever  
When the night is clear  
I can hear the teardrops  
Falling for the last in love  
  
Every now and then  
I hear voices on the wind  
I may love you always and always  
Far away and clear  
You can hear the teardrops  
Falling for the last in love  
Calling for the last in love
