People say a lot when they want the job yeah  
Lining up sideways around the block  
Its not for the money she say to you  
Almost convincing herself that its true  
Ill take care of your dog when youre away  
I dont mind working Saturdays  
When you wanna work Ill work with you she say  
And Ill go on working when you wanna play  
Nothing gonna hurt you when Im around  
Ill keep my eyes wide open and my nose to the ground  
Ill be like a mama with a baby cub  
  
Chorus  
People say a lot when they want the job  
People say a lot when they want the job yeah  
People say a lot when they want the job  
  
When you begin to see a sinister gleam  
Youre locked in too tight on the same team  
Theres a little holiday in her heart  
When she sees you slip up Ah  
Its like Christmas Eve just to see you trip up  
Ooops then down again  
Shell sit on the floor hardly hiding a grin  
When her tears spill out crocodile chagrin  
Its her contempt for you she thinks youre a slob  
  
Chorus  
  
Greatest cook to bring a meal didnt need a recipe  
Said shell also deal the cards dealt the knave and two and three  
Said she also feel the thrill of the willow in the wind  
Feel the thrillo the willow or oak or elm or ash or pine sol  
  
Its already too late when shes reading your mail  
Calling your agent and making the deal  
Shell just copy and paste it and make it last  
Nothing is sacred about your past  
  
Shell tell of the poppies in the July fest  
Maybe her brother with the badge can make the arrest  
You could go to jail fail all the tests  
Forget your keys and your secrets and your little black box  
  
Chorus  
  
She was awfully good at fire fiery fiery hussy burn  
She burned bridges where she could she really couldnt burn them very well  
She turned young men into torches burning scarecrow  
She had a way with wood do away with wood do away with wood  
  
People say a lot when they want the job  
Lining up eager around the block  
Promising promising never to quit  
Well its a full time job to be a hypocrite  
Maybe they remember that theyve done it before  
Practicing with their dolls on the floor  
The lie itself becoming the seed  
The messy mascara the future deed  
The actors bow the junkies need  
They line up again just to wipe you clean  
  
They line up again just to wipe you out  
Line up again around the block  
A mighty force of youth for hire  
Spouting ideas that geniuses would rob oh  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Tell me Phoebe do you want someday to have an award like that of your own  
  
More than anything else in the world  
  
Then you must ask Miss Harrington how to get one  
Miss Harrington knows all about it
