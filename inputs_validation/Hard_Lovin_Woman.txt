She walked into the room  
Her hand upon her hip  
Said look out boy  
Ill make your backbone slip  
She looked straight at me  
The devil in her eye  
I knew what I was getting but took it by surprise  
No fooling she really knocked the stuffing out of me  
Some woman  
A hard lovin woman  
She chewed me up and spat me out  
  
Some woman  
Shes a hard lovin woman  
Some woman  
A hard lovin woman  
  
She didnt wear nothing  
But a smile upon her face  
Licking her lips but I had the taste  
Her temperature was rising  
I was coming to the boil  
Her fires were burning  
She was pouring on the oil  
I do not jest she really took me to the cleaners  
Some woman  
A hard lovin woman  
It felt just great when she pulled her 38s  
  
Some woman  
Shes a hard lovin woman  
Some woman  
A hard lovin woman  
  
It started with a smile  
It turned into a laugh  
It ended with a scream  
I said enoughs enough  
Never heard a word  
She wouldnt let go  
A mans a man and every woman ought to know  
And there I was  
And she was dancing  
Some woman  
Here we go again  
  
Some woman  
Shes a hard lovin woman  
Some woman  
A hard lovin woman
