I remember the times I was lonely without her  
Now shes mine and I spend my times dreamin about her  
  
Love her all I can and try to understand  
The things that make her glad  
The things that make her sad  
Im a lucky guy I hardly ever cry  
And when the world looks bad  
Shes never ever sad  
  
Shes so easy to please and it doesnt take money no no  
We can have a good time when the skies arent sunny  
  
Ah I love her all I can and try to understand  
The things that make her glad  
The things that make her sad  
Im a lucky guy I hardly ever cry  
And when the world looks bad  
Shes never ever sad  
  
Whoo  
I remember the times I was lonely without her  
Now shes mine and I spend my time dreamin about her  
  
I love her all I can and try to understand  
The things that make her glad  
The things that make her sad  
Im a lucky guy I hardly ever cry  
And when the world looks bad  
Shes never ever sad
