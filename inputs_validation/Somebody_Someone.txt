I cant stand to let you win  
Im just watching you  
And I dont know what to do  
Feeling like a fool inside  
Feeling all the love you hide  
Thought you were my friend  
Seems it never ends  
  
I need somebody someone  
Can somebody help me  
All I need is some pain  
Not just for me  
  
Giving you with this and that  
Giving gave nothing back  
Its all related to  
All the things I do  
Feeling like a fool inside  
Seeing all the things you tried  
I am nothing  
  
I need somebody someone  
Can somebody help me  
All I need is some pain  
Not just for me  
  
I look I sign  
I need someone  
Inside to help me out  
With what  
Im trying  
Im crying  
Im frying  
In a pile of  
Shit  
Im dying  
Im dying  
  
Im dying  
  
I need somebody someone somebody somebody someone  
I need somebody someone somebody somebody someone  
Someone
