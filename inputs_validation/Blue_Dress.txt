Put it on  
And dont say a word  
Put it on  
The one that I prefer  
Put it on  
And stand before my eyes  
Put it on  
Please dont question why  
Can you believe  
Something so simple  
Something so trivial  
Makes me a happy man  
Cant you understand  
Say you believe  
Just how easy  
It is to please me  
Because when you learn  
Youll know what makes the world turn  
Put it on  
I can feel so much  
Put it on  
I dont need to touch  
Put it on  
Here before my eyes  
Put it on  
Because you realise  
And you believe  
Something so worthless  
Serves a purpose  
It makes me a happy man  
Cant you understand  
Say you believe  
Just how easy  
It is to please me  
Because when you learn  
Youll know what makes the world turn
