Nothing in this world such a pure delight  
As a faisdodo on a Saturday night  
Work your tail off all week long  
But forget about your troubles with a party and a song  
  
Boy I love those old time tunes  
They can tickle your senses like a Cajun moon  
Creole food sure tastes fine  
When you wash it on down with that homemade wine  
  
CHORUS  
Get out the fiddle rosin up the bow  
Theres gonna be some music and I hope it aint slow  
Grab your baby dance til three down at the Bayou Jubilee  
Grab your baby dance til three down at the Bayou Jubilee  
  
Theres Pierre and his girl Laverne  
Dancin so hot youd think their shoes were burning  
Grandmas in the corner shakin it too  
Shes got her own version of a Cajun boogaloo repeat chorus
