Standing on the corner of 6th and How To Forget  
Trying to do right by you all night Annette  
You can go ahead and get married  
and this will be our secret thing  
I wont tell a soul except the people in the nightclub where I sing  
  
I dont want to get you all worked up  
Except secretly I do  
  
Id be lying if I said I didnt have designs on you  
Id be lying if I said I didnt have designs on you  
  
Standing on the corner of 6th and Where do I go  
The parades shut down now the rain is running the show  
Where did all these people come from  
And how soon can they leave  
Normally Id be into it but I need to get some sleep  
  
Though I do wish you1d come over  
But Im warning you if you do  
  
Id be lying if I said I didnt have designs on you  
Id be lying if I said I didnt have designs on you  
  
Standing on the corner of 6th and Where do I get  
Trying to do right by you all night Annette  
This would only be an experiment  
In things that could have been  
You can go ahead and get married  
And itll probably never happen again  
  
I dont mean to make you excited  
Except secretly I do  
  
Id be lying if I said I didnt have designs on you  
Id be lying if I said I didnt have designs on you  
Id be lying if I said I didnt have designs on you  
Id be lying if I said I didnt have designs on you
