Maybe one breath away  
Ill find the words to say  
Ill sit and light the bong  
Ill hold my hit in real long  
  
I dont know if I can go up inside of you tonite  
Oh Mary baby please dont fuss and fight  
  
Youve heard the line before  
Mary baby please dont think Im a whore  
If you come home with me  
Turn off the lights lock up the door and start gettin busy  
  
I dont know if I can go so far up inside you tonite  
Mary baby I could do it right  
  
When we got to her pad  
Mary baby started callin me her dad  
As she gave me head  
We could not find the damn bed  
  
Fifteen years old plus one  
Hotter than a microwave oven  
  
Mary baby daddy is comin home
