Baby  
Why dont you be my girl  
Ill give it a try  
Cause Im your kind of guy  
  
I said baby  
Why dont you be my girl  
Ill give it a try  
Cause Im your kind of guy  
  
Ill send you flowers  
Every day girl  
If you will promise to be mine  
Forever more  
And if you say  
The words I long to hear  
You know how happy Ill be  
  
So baby  
Why dont you be my girl  
Ill give it a try  
Cause Im your kind of guy
