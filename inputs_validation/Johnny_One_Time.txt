So he told you youre the dream that hes been searching for  
And he told you that hed never met anyone like you before  
And I can hear him telling you your lips taste just like sherry wine  
But did he tell you that hes known as Johnny one time  
  
So he told you that hed never lead your heart astray  
And he told you that hed love you forever and a day  
And I can hear him telling you hes the shy and bashful kind  
But did he tell you that hes known as Johnny one time  
  
Did he tell you that your heart will soon become  
Another trinket on his bracelets of broken hearts  
Did he tell you that the morning sun will find you  
Patching up your shattered pride and searching for the missing parts  
  
Did he tell you that the special love youre saving  
Will disappear in shame and flames like mine  
Did he tell you that hes known as Johnny one time  
Did he tell you that your heart  
Did he tell you that your heart
