In my neighborhood  
We dont live so good  
The rooms are small  
And the buildings made of wood  
  
I hear the neighbors talking bout you and me  
I guess I heard it all  
Cause the talk is loud  
And the walls are much too thin  
  
He dont really love her  
Thats what I heard them say  
He sure wasnt thinking of her today oh no  
He wasnt thinking of her today  
  
I saw them in the front yard  
Said the boy in room one four nine  
He was talking to a girl Ive never seen before  
And standing there together oh they looked so good  
  
I dont want to hear it anymore  
I dont want to hear it  
I dont want to hear it anymore  
Anymore  
Cause the talk just never ends  
And the heartache soon begins  
The talk is so loud  
And the walls are much too thin  
  
Aint it sad said the woman down the hall  
That when a nice girl falls in love  
Aint it just too bad that she had to fall  
For a boy who doesnt care for her at all  
Its so sad  
  
I dont want to hear it anymore  
I dont want to hear it  
I just cant stand to hear it anymore  
Anymore  
Cause the talk just never ends  
And the heartache soon begins  
The talk is so loud  
And the walls are much too thin  
  
I dont want to hear it anymore  
Cant stand to hear it  
Dont want to hear it  
I just cant stand to hear it anymore  
Dont talk about it  
Cant stand to hear it  
Oh baby baby  
I just cant stand
