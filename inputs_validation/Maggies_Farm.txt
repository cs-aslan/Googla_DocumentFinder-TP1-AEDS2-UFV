No I aint gonna work on Maggies farm no more  
Well I wake up in the morning  
Fold my hands and pray for rain  
I got a head full of ideas  
That are drivin me insane  
Its a shame

Scrub the floor

I aint gonna work for Maggies brother no more  
Nah I aint gonna work for Maggies brother no more  
Well he hands you a nickel  
And he hands you a dime  
And he asks you with a grin  
If youre havin a good time  
Then he fines you every time you slam the door

Out in your face just for kicks  
His bedroom window  
It is made out of bricks  
The National Guard stands around his door

I aint gonna work for Maggies ma no more  
No I aint gonna work for Maggies ma no more  
Well she talks to all the servants  
About man and God and law  
And everybody says

Shes sixtyeight but she says shes twentyfour

To be just like I am  
But everybody wants you  
To be just like them  
They sing while they slave and just get bored  
I aint gonna work on nah  
I aint gonna work on Maggies farm no more
