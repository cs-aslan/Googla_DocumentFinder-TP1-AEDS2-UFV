Why do we have to go and face the same routine  
And the traffic jams and crowded streets a real  
Neurotic scene  
I dont know why do we take it each day yeah  
Why does my girl tell me shes got to  
Have her way  
Out all night come home to fight  
What am I to say  
I dont know why do we take it each day  
Life is what it is  
Who wants to try not to believe  
Thats the way it is  
Oh oh  
I dont know why what you feel inside  
Days go on  
Love is something that you just cant hide  
If its wrong  
Then youll want to know you dont know why  
I sing a song  
And it helps me yet Ill get by  
At times  
Lost in time sometimes your mind unwinds  
Sun does shine  
But no pleasure from your beautys mine  
Like champagne wine  
A bitter taste thats so refined  
Life its fine  
You always pay for whats behind  
Why do I have to go and face the same routine  
And the traffic jams and crowded streets a real  
Neurotic scene  
I dont know why do we take it each day yeah  
Life is what it is  
Who wants to try not to believe  
Thats the way it is
