I know what you want  
Im gonna take you a midnight show tonight  
And if you keep a secret  
I got a blanket in the back seat of my mind  
And a little place that sits beneath the sky  
She turned her face to speak  
But no one heard her cry  
  
Drive faster boy  
Drive faster boy  
  
I know theres a hope  
Theres too many people trying to help me cope  
You got a real short skirt  
I wanna look up look up look up yeah yeah  
  
We were just in time  
Let me take a little more off your mind  
Theres something in my head  
Somewhere in the back said  
We were just a good thing  
We were such a good thing  
  
Make it go away without a word  
But promise me youll stay  
Fix these things Ive heard  
Or make it go away Oh  
  
Drive faster boy yo uh oh no  
  
The crashing tide cant hide a guilty girl  
With jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls  
I took my babys breath beneath the chandelier  
Of stars and atmosphere and watched her  
And watched her disappear  
Into the midnight show  
  
Faster faster faster faster faster faster  
Oh no no no no no no no no no no no  
If you keep a secret  
Well baby I can keep if you can keep a secret  
She said she loved me  
If you can keep a secret I can keep a secret  
She said she loved me  
If you can keep a secret well baby I can keep it a secret
