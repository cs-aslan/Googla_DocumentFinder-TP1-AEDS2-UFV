Dear Tiffany  
Youve mad me nauseous for the last time  
Everything Ive said to you I will form a spike to drive through my  
throat In order to stop my words  
This time Ill put them in the ground along with my memories and my feelings  
Ill burn it down and walk away  
Let the fire warm my back  
I wish you would say you hate me  
It would make it so much easier  
Burn it down and walk away  
Love Daniel
