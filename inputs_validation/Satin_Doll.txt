Cigarette holder which wigs me  
Over her shoulder she digs me  
Out cattin that satin doll  
  
Baby shall we go out skippin   
Careful amigo youre flippin  
Speaks Latin that satin doll  
  
Shes nobodys fool so Im playing it cool as can be  
Ill give it a whirl but I aint for no girl catching me  
Swicherooney  
  
Telephone numbers well you know  
Doing my rhumbas with uno  
And thatn my satin doll
