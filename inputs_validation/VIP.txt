Im a Very Important Person  
I park in the VIP  
And when I go to the bathroom  
I go in the VIP toilet  
And when I wanna change a light bulb  
I dont do it myself  
I have a technician  
Cause Im a VIP  
Im a VIP  
Im a VIP  
Im a VIP  
Now as I began to become a VIP  
I forgot what Ive become a VIP for  
I began to grow accustomed to people saying  
Right this way sir drinks are on the house  
Flight attendants on airplanes saying  
  
Please really I dont wanna bother you sir but its such a pleasure to
have you on board  
May I have your autograph for my daughter  
Yeah baby right after I go to the toilet  
I Ill give you a couple of em  
Cause Im a VIP  
  
Nowone thing about VIP isis they never seem to be alone  
Oh no   
The true VIP must travel with an entourage   
People who say Right on boss  
Cause its a VIP  
Right on boss  
Im a VIP  
As I began to realize that I had gained VIP status  
Worries began to creep in  
What if one dayI woke upand I was no longer a VIP  
No more good tables at the restaurants  
No more strange women smiling and approaching me on the streets  
No more top notch booty  
No more entourage to say Right boss  
I began to have nightmares  
And in my nightmares I was just a fucking nobody  
Laying at the beach imagining myself being a VIP  
Just like I was before  
Hearing the applause in my head  
Beautiful warm embraces of superior members of the female gender  
  
VIP  
VIP  
  
Of course when one becomes a VIP  
One meets other VIPs  
At social occasions  
And one inevitably thinks  
thick How shallow and crass these people are  
Theyre not down to earth and real like me  
Oh no Im a very special VIP  
  
Another interesting phenomenon associated with VIP celebrity hood  
Is the VIP reflection effect during which anyone associated with the
VIP  
Becomes a sort of VIP in their own right Such as son OF the VIP  
Guitar player FOR the VIP  
Girlfriend WITH the VIP  
Accountants of the VIP  
The maid the dog the music publisher huh  
All enjoy a sort of reflected glory as in  
  
Hi this is Nastea  
I work for Iggy  
And Id like 6 tables tonight in the VIP section  
And he needs passes for everyone  
And free drinks of course  
In the VIP area  
Right on boss  
Cause Im a VIP  
Its also true that when one is a VIP everybodys happy to see you all the
time  
And theres an implicit rule that a VIP must never never  
Be on a barn  
Cause everybody expects YOU to make their day  
And theyre all be on to you if youre in a bad mood  
They will thcktchktchk  mur mur mur mur mur  
And you will find yourself with the wrong kind of attention  
A difficult VIP  
Psychologists tell us that a sense of selfesteem  
Is so necessary in todays world  
As a VIP I can guarantee you youll never be alone  
Youll never be alone  
Cause youre a VIP
