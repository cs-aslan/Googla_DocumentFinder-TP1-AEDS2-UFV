Hey there pretty one  
Take a look at what youve done  
Youve broken my heart in two  
You told a hundred lies  
To as many other guys  
Oh lovely unfaithful pretty one  
Somedaywhen youre older  
And your future has past  
You will find that your beauty  
And loveliness wont last  
When the traces of time  
Show in every line  
Remember I still love you  
Pretty one pretty one pretty one  
Hey there pretty one

And you future has passed  
You will find that your beauty  
And your loveliness wont last  
When the traces of time  
Show in every line  
Remember I still love you  
Pretty one pretty one pretty one
