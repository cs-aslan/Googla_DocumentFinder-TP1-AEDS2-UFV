Im a big fuckin dick  
Im a pain in your ass  
I drink all your beer  
Ill eat the last slice  
Ill give you charley horses  
Ill pull your shorts down at the beach  
I always need a ride  
Nobody likes me  
  
My names Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
I spit when I talk  
I swear in front of your mother  
I throw shit at the movies  
I wear tight pants  
I ask you to buy an extra Yankee ticket  
And then I dont show  
I tell you I saw your girlfriend  
Fucking two guys at a party  
  
Cause my names Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
Ill piss on your toilet seat and tell your dad you got stoned  
Ill borrow your jacket and never think of returning it  
  
Polychronopolous  
Pansy  
Pussy  
Shit for brains  
Douchebag  
  
Ill leave your gate open  
So your dog runs away  
Ill make fun of your pimple  
Then Ill grab your sisters ass  
  
Cause my names Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
And I dont care  
And I dont give a shit  
  
Ill break your brothers stereo  
And then tell him it was you  
You think youre better than me  
Well youre fucking wrong  
  
Everybody knows Im Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
Deal with it
