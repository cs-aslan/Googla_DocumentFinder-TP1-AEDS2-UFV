From morning to night I stayed out of sight  
Didnt recognize what Id become  
No more than alive Id barely survive  
In a word overrun  
  
Wont hear a sound  
From my mouth  
Ive spent too long  
On the inside out  
My skin is cold  
To the human touch  
This bleeding hearts  
Not beating much  
  
I murmured a vow of silence and now  
I dont even hear when I think aloud  
Extinguished by light I turn on the night  
Wear its darkness with an empty smile  
  
Im creeping back to life  
My nervous system all away  
Im wearing the inside out  
  
Look at him now  
Hes paler somehow  
But hes coming round  
Hes starting to choke  
Its been so long since he spoke  
Well he can have the words right from my mouth  
  
And with these words I can see  
Clear through the clouds that covered me  
Just give it time then speak my name  
Now we can hear ourselves again  
  
Im holding out  
For the day  
When all the clouds  
Have blown away  
Im with you now  
Can speak your name  
Now we can hear  
Ourselves again  
  
Hes curled into the corner  
But still the screen is flickering  
With an endless stream of garbage to  
Curse the place  
In a sea of random images  
The selfdestructing animal  
Waiting for the waves to break  
  
Hes standing on the threshold  
Caught in fiery anger  
And hurled into the furnace hell  
Curse the place  
Hes torn in all directions  
And the screen is still flickering  
Waiting for the flames to break
