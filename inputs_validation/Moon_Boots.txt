Im gonna leave this place  
I made a snap decision  
Im gonna find another earth  
And start my own religion  
Yeah Im shooting through space  
Where there aint no division  
Im gonna see some shapes  
You wont see on the television no no oohoh oh  
  
The countdown started on the day we parted  
Leaving you is hardest  
Till the song kickin in and Im ready to go  
  
Ive got my moon boots on  
Yeah Im a man on a mission  
Ive built a rocket to the sky  
Gonna say goodbye  
Gonna cut off all transmission yeah  
Ive got my moon boots on  
Yeah Im a man on a mission  
Ive built a rocket to the sky  
Gonna say goodbye  
Gonna cut off all transmission yeah yeah yeah  
  
Im in a far off place  
Thats stranger than a distant land  
I cut my parachute off  
Oh to see if I could stand  
Im headed for a great new world  
Somewhere where there aint no fears  
Its gonna look and sound the same  
Only difference is that youre not here  
Youre not here no  
  
The countdown started on the day we parted  
Ive been brokenhearted  
Till the song kickin in and Im ready to go  
  
Ive got my moon boots on  
Yeah Im a man on a mission  
Ive built a rocket to the sky  
Gonna say goodbye  
Gonna cut off all transmission  
Ive got my moon boots on  
Yeah Im a man on a mission  
Ive built a rocket to the sky  
Gonna say goodbye  
Gonna cut off all transmission yeah yeah
