Everybody wanna know  
Where Jimmy has gone  
He left town  
I doubt if hes comin back home  
Tony gotta job  
Three kids and a lovely wife  
Workin in the commerce bank  
For the rest of his life  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
Nobody wants to do the crazy things  
We used to do before  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
  
Im gonna hit the road  
Adios my friend  
Go some place  
And start all over again  
Dont know where Im goin  
Like a gypsy out on the road  
Go some place and join a travelin show  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
Nobody wants to do the crazy things  
We used to do before  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
  
I think Jimmy mustve had the right idea  
He packed his stuff  
And he got right out of here  
I dont know where hes at  
But Im sure that hes ok  
Now I realize  
What Jimmy was tryin to say  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
Nobody wants to do the crazy things  
We used to do before  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
  
Nobody left to run with anymore  
No no nobody left to run with anymore
