You know I see you when youre sleeping  
When youre all insane with dreaming  
I can tell you that you been fighting baby  
But youve been losing  
  
You know theres clearer ways of thinking  
And theres quicker ways of dying  
But Im a sucker for your drinking  
And now Im losing  
  
I dont know who you think youre cheating  
Or with whom you have been sleeping  
But all the shit that youve been eating  
Says youre losing  
  
When I let my hate pervert me  
And theres no more tears for crying  
Ill just kill you if you hurt me  
Ill kill you  
  
You know I see you when youre sleeping  
When youre all insane with dreaming  
I can tell you that you been fighting baby  
Fighting hard and losing  
  
Fighting hard and losing  
Fighting hard fighting hard losing
