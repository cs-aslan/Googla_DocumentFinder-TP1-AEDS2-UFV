Through the years million tears  
Drops of blood glistening  
And she sings speaks of dreams  
What will come what will be  
Of a time yet to come  
I must look try to see  
Speaks of love speaks of dreams  
Of eternity  
  
Ive a bad feeling inside  
As Im drawn to a place  
A hundred corpses  
Woven graves  
The widow now lay inside  
The future is told through her eyes  
This web be not my grave  
  
From what Im seeing  
Its not hard believing  
The words of her spell as she speaks  
  
I have a feeling  
I wont be leaving  
One second more and Im spellbound  
  
I want to look in her eyes  
See what the future will bring  
One step too close and Im dead  
  
A numbing cold freezing inside  
Darkness and gloom  
As she spins her web  
It takes your life  
  
Face to face eye to eye  
Times unwinding  
As she sings all it seems  
To hypnotize me  
Touch of doom for her groom  
Shes paralyzing  
Hers to feast when deceased  
Her trap surrounds me  
  
They wont stay open my eyes  
The visions beginning to blur  
Fever beginning to rise  
Spins her web  
The face of death in her eyes  
The kiss of death is on her lips  
The grip of death is in her thighs  
Spins her web  
Spins her web  
  
Its no use pleading  
The beast is needing me  
For the spell has been cast  
  
I feel her kisses  
My life dismisses  
One last kiss and Im spellbound  
  
Death is the only surprise  
Cunning her prey with her lies  
Taking you down then youre  
Spellbound  
Too many brave men have died  
To know what tomorrow will bring  
Another cast on a silk tomb  
Spellbound

Spellbound
