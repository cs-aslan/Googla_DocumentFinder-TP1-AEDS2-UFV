Saying I love you  
Is not the words  
I want to hear from you  
Its not that I want you  
Not to say  
But if you only knew  
How easy  
It would be to  
Show me how you feel  
More than words  
Is all you have to do  
To make it real  
Then you wouldnt  
Have to say  
That you love me  
Cos Id already know  
  
What would you do  
If my heart was torn in two  
More than words to show you feel  
That your love for me is real  
What would you say  
If I took those words away  
Then you couldnt make things new  
Just by saying I love you  
  
Its more than words  
Its more than what you say  
Its the things you do  
Oh yeah  
Its more than words  
Its more than what you say  
Its the things you do  
Oh yeah  
  
Now that Ive tried to  
Talk to you  
And make you understand  
All you have to do  
Is close your eyes  
And just reach out your hands  
  
And touch me  
Hold me close  
Dont ever let me go  
More than words  
Is all I ever  
Needed you to show  
Then you wouldnt have to say  
That you love me  
Cos Id already know  
  
What would you do  
If my heart was torn in two  
More than words to show you feel  
That your love for me is real  
What would you say if I took those words away  
Then you couldnt make things new  
Just by saying I love you
