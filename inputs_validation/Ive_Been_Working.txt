I dont know why the world loves a forever love affair  
Im just a freak  
Who loves a one night thing oh yeah  
A one night all night  
And after a long day of work all I wanna do is play around  
So Im going out  
For a little bit of love  
And a whole lotta getting down  
Do you believe me you gotta believe me  
  
Chorus  
Ive been working  
Ive been all day working  
And I need somebody  
Said I need some  
I need some love tonight oh yeah  
I need some love  
I need some love tonight  
  
People talk about my life and heres what they say  
Its incomplete  
Its too bad that they feel that way  
Hes sho is crazy  
But I dont listen to any of them after five oclock  
Because the night is mine  
And I dont wanna change anything cause I like what I got  
  
Chorus  
  
So dont give me a forever love affair no dont you dare  
I like to freak  
To the one night beat oh yeah  
Again and again yeah yeah  
I work hard every day so I do what I wanna do  
Thats why Im steppin out Stepping out  
To find me somebody to do what I wanna do  
  
Chorus
