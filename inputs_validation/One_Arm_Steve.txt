Well OneArm Steve yeah he threw me out the door  
Said come back sometime when your pictures on the wall  
Hey now you got to get on out got no time to field your problems  
God damn the repo man been knocking on the door  
Said sonny wont you walk this line and put your hands up on the car  
Well he may not be a talker but he always knows whats going on  
  
So Sister Ann she sat my ass up on the table  
Said sit still son cause this wont hurt a bit  
Hey now shes got a wonder drug for this deaf dumb and blind man  
Took me to the hospital some nurse rolled up my sleeve  
Hey Annie break my walking stick and work a miracle on me  
She may not be the doctor but she always knows whats going on  
  
Well Say Hey Willy Mays whats in your suitcase full of wonders  
Big city doctor fix me up and make me right
