Put me in  
A special school  
Cause I am such a fool  
And I dont need  
A single book  
To teach me how to read  
Who needs stupid books  
They are for petty crooks  
And I will learn  
By studying  
The lesson in my dreams  
Turn off the TV  
Cause thats what others see  
And movies are as bad as  
Eating chocolate ice cream  
They only sicken me  
Dont let me play football  
Ill sack the quarterback  
A jack the brother of the ball  
  
Chorus  
Im a troublemaker  
Never been a faker  
Doing things my own way  
And never giving up  
Im a troublemaker  
Not a double taker  
I dont have  
The patience  
To keep it on the up  
  
I picked up a guitar  
What does that signify  
Im gonna play  
Some heavy metal riffs  
And you will die  
You wanted arts  
And crafts  
Hows this for arts  
And crafts  
  
Thats right  
Im growing out my hair  
Im movin out  
To Cherokee  
Im gonna be  
A rock star  
And you will go  
To bed with me  
Cause I cant work a job  
Like any other slob  
Punch it in  
And punch it out  
And suckin up to Bob  
Marrying a bitch  
Having 7 kids  
Giving up  
And growing old  
And hoping  
Theres a God  
  
Chorus  
  
Im gonna be a star  
And people  
Will crane necks  
To get a glimpse of me  
And see  
If I am having a sex  
In studying  
And my moves  
They try  
To understand  
Why I am so unlike  
The singers  
In the other bands  
  
Im such a mystery  
As anyone can see  
There isnt  
Anybody else  
Exactly quite  
Like me  
  
And when  
Its party time  
Like 1999  
I party by myself  
Because Im such  
A special guy  
  
Chorus  
  
Keep it on the up  
Im a troublemaker  
Keep it on the up  
Im a troublemaker  
Keep it on the up  
Im a troublemaker  
Never giving up
