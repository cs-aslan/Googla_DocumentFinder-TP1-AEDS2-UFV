Love is like the ocean burning in devotion  
When you go go go oh no  
Feel my heart is burning when the night is turning  
I will go go go oh no  
  
Baby I will love you  
Every night and day  
Baby I will kiss you  
But I have to say  
  
No face no name no number  
Your love is like a thunder  
Im dancing on a fire burning in my heart  
No face no name no number  
Oh girl Im not a hunter  
Your love is like desire burning in my soul  
No face no name no number  
Oh love is like a thunder  
Oh love is like the heaven its so hard to find  
No face no name no number  
Girl Im not a hunter  
Your love is like a river flowing in my mind  
  
Feel your dreams are flying dreams are never dying  
I dont go go go oh no  
Youre eyes tells a story baby oh dont worry  
When you go go go oh no  
Baby cause I love you  
Forever and a day  
Baby I will kiss you but I have to say
