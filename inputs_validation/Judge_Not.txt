Dont you look at me so smug  
And say Im going bad  
Who are you to judge me  
And the life that I live  
I know that Im not perfect  
And that I dont claim to be  
So before you point your fingers  
Be sure your hands are clean  
Judge not  
Before you judge yourself  
Judge not  
If youre not ready for judgement Woah oh oh  
The road of life is rocking  
And you may stumble too  
So while you talk about me  
Someone else is judging you  
Saxophone solo  
Judge not  
Before you judge yourself  
Judge not  
If youre not ready for judgement Woah oh oh  
The road of life is rocky  
And you may stumble too  
So while you talk about me  
Someone else is judging you  
Someone else is judging you  
Someone else is judging you  
Someone else is judging you  
Someone else is judging you  
fadeout
