ill need time to get you off my mind  
and i may sometimes bother you  
try to be in touch with you  
even ask too much of you from time to time  
now and then  
lord you know ill need a friend  
til i get used to losin you  
let me keep on usin you til i can make it on my own  
ill get by but no matter how i try  
therell be times you know ill call  
chances are my tears will fall  
and ill have no pride at all from time to time  
but they say therell be brighter days  
but til then ill lean on you thats all i mean to do  
til i can make it on my own  
surely someday ill look up and see the mornin sun  
without another lonely nite behind me  
then ill know im over you  
and all my cryins done  
no more hurt and memories can find me  
but til then lord you know im gonna need a friend  
til i get used to losin you  
let me keep on usin you til i can make it on my own  
til i can make it on my own
