To obey is better than sacrifice  
I dont need your money  
I want your life  
And I hear you say that Im coming back soon  
But you act like Ill never return  
  
Well you speak of grace and my love so sweet  
How you thrive on milk but reject My meat  
And I cant help weeping of how it will be  
If you keep on ignoring My words  
Well you pray to prosper and succeed  
But your flesh is something I just cant feed  
  
To obey is better than sacrifice  
I want more than Sunday and Wednesday nights  
Cause if you cant come to Me every day  
Then dont bother coming at all  
La la la  
  
To obey is better than sacrifice  
I want hearts of fire  
Not your prayers of ice  
And Im coming quickly  
To give back to you  
According to what you have done  
According to what you have done  
According to what you have done
