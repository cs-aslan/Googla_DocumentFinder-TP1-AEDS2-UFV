On returning I cant believe this world is still turning  
The pressures on  
Because the pleasure hasnt gone  
And Im  
Not sorry for  
For the things Ive done  
And Im  
Not looking for  
Just anyone  
  
On competing  
Oh when will this tired heart stop beating  
Its all a game  
Existence is only a game  
And Im  
Not sorry for  
For the things Ive done  
And Im  
Not looking for  
Just anyone  
  
Im  
Slipping below the water line  
Im  
Slipping below the water line  
Reach for my hand  
And  
And the race is won  
Reject my hand  
And  
The damage is done  
  
Im  
Slipping below the water line  
Im  
Slipping below the water line  
  
The woman of my dreams  
She  
She never came along  
The woman of my dreams  
Well  
There never was one  
  
And Im  
Not sorry for  
For the things Ive said  
Theres a wild man in my head  
Theres a wild man In my head
