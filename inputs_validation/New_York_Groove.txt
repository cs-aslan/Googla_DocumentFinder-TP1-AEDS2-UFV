Many years since I was here on the street I was passin my time away  
To the left and to the right buildings towering to the sky  
Its outta sight in the dead of night  
Here I am again in this city with a fistful of dollars  
And baby youd better believe  
  
Chorus  
Im back back in the New York Groove  
Im back back in the New York Groove  
Im back back in the New York Groove  
Back in the New York Groove in the New York Groove  
  
In the back of my Cadillac  
A wicked lady sittin by my side sayin Where are we   
Stop at Third and Fortythree exit to the night  
Its gonna be ecstacy this place was meant for me  
  
Feels so good tonight who cares about tomorrow  
So baby youd better believe  
  
Chorus  
  
Im back back in the New York Groove repeats out
