Im in love with a dolly named Glendora  
She works in the window of a big department stora  
Eyes of blue hair like gold  
Never been young but shell never get old  
Oh GlendoraI want to see more of you  
  
O GlendoraO Glendora  
O GlendoraI want to see more of you  
  
Shes so shy that I dont know how I found her  
With three big body guards always workin around her  
One just nods an two just grins  
An three got a mouth full of safety pins  
O GlendoraI want to see more of you  
 Youmore of you   
  
O GlendoraO Glendora  
O GlendoraI want to see more of you  
more of you   
  
I stand left an I stand right  
Outta my head cause Im outta sight  
O GlendoraI want to see more of you  
  
Late last night at the store they did some changin  
An I stood watchin when they started rearrangin  
She lost her wig she lost her arms  
An when they got through she lost all of her charms  
O Glendorawhat did they do to you  
  
What they do what they do what they do   
O GlendoraO Glendora  
O Glendorawhat did they do to you  
  
What they do what they do what they do   
O GlendoraO Glendora  
O Glendorawhat did they do to you  
  
Do to you oh what did they do to you  
O Glendorawhat did they do to you
