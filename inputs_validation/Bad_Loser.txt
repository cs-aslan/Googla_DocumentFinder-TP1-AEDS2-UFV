Well you thought you had a hold on me  
But its different now  
Everything you done before has fell upon you now  
Are you just a bad loser  
But you never let go  
and youre gonna go down  
Yes youll go down but youll never let it show  
All the strings and strokes in the ocean  
Wont buy you piece of mind  
All because you did what you did  
Youre not the peaceful kind  
Youre just a bad loser  
And youll never let go  
and youre gonna go down  
Yes youll go down but youll never never let it show  
I think you really know what I mean  
But Ill tell you one more time  
Oh cause its the truth and you know it  
That youre no friend of mine  
Youre just a bad loser  
And youll never let go  
and youre gonna go down  
Yes youll go down but youll never let it show
