Empty spaces what are we living for  
Abandoned places I guess we know the score  
On and on does anybody know what we are looking for  
Another hero another mindless crime  
Behind the curtain in the pantomime  
Hold the line does anybody want to take it anymore  
The show must go on  
The show must go on yeah  
Inside my heart is breaking  
My makeup may be flaking  
But my smile still stays on  
  
Whatever happens Ill leave it all to chance  
Another heartache another failed romance  
On and on does anybody know what we are living for  
I guess Im learning Im learning learning learning  
I must be warmer now  
Ill soon be turning turning turning turning  
Round the corner now  
Outside the dawn is breaking  
But inside in the dark Im aching to be free  
The show must go on  
The show must go on yeah yeah  
Ooh inside my heart is breaking  
My makeup may be flaking  
But my smile still stays on  
  
Yeah yeah whoa wo oh oh  
  
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies  
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die  
I can fly my friends  
The show must go on go on go on go on yeah yeah  
The show must go on go on go on go on  
Ill face it with a grin  
Im never giving in  
On with the show  
  
Ooh Ill top the bill Ill overkill  
I have to find the will to carry on  
On with the show  
On with the show  
The show the show must go on  
Go on go on go on go on go on  
Go on go on go on go on go on  
Go on go on go on go on go on  
Go on go on go on go on go on  
Go on go on
