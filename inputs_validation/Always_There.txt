Im running away  
Ive got to get home  
Im lost in a crowd  
But Im still on my own  
Im looking ahead  
So Im staying behind  
Im not being cruel  
Im just being kind  
I close my eyes  
Its no surprise  
Im always there  
Cant count the times  
Ive tried to hide  
And found nowhere  
  
Im trying to lay low  
But I keep getting high  
My feet on the ground  
Got my head in the sky  
My eye on the future  
Thats stuck in the past  
I find I cant lose  
When I aim to come last  
  
I realize  
Its no surprise  
That nothings clear  
That black is white  
That day is night  
And there is here  
  
Im right on the ball  
But Im missing the mark  
I burn in the sun  
Im scared of the dark  
Got an ivory tower  
With a birds eye view  
Got plenty of time  
But nothing to do  
  
The best disguise  
Its no surprise  
Is disappear  
Cant count the times  
Ive tried to hide  
And found nowhere  
  
Im running away  
Ive got to get home  
Im lost in a crowd  
But Im still on my own  
Im looking ahead  
So Im staying behind  
Im not being cruel  
Im just being kind  
  
I realize  
Its no surprise  
That nothings clear  
That black is white  
That day is night  
And there is here  
  
The best disguise  
Its no surprise  
Is disappear  
Cant count the times  
Ive tried to hide  
And found nowhere  
  
I close my eyes  
Its no surprise  
Im always there  
Cant count the times  
Ive tried to hide  
And found nowhere  
  
I realize  
Its no surprise  
That nothings clear  
That black is white  
That day is night  
And there is here  
  
The best disguise  
Its no surprise  
Is disappear  
Cant count the times  
Ive tried to hide  
And found nowhere
