Dont count your chickens  
Cause theyre never gonna hatch  
You cant catch a monkey with a shotgun and a sack  
cause youre too dull baby  
You cant see the wood for the trees  
Cause youre too slow baby  
You just couldnt get off your knees  
Dont count your chickens  
Cause theyre never gonna hatch  
You cant catch a monkey with a shotgun and a sack  
Cause youre too dull baby  
You cant see the wood for the trees  
Cause youre too slow baby  
You just couldnt get off your knees  
  
I can see the love and the hate in your eyes  
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise  
What you gonna do and what you gonna say  
Im not the only one believing theres an easier way  
  
It doesnt pay to disorientate me  
It doesnt cost to be someone  
I am the vine  
And youre the branches  
  
Dont knock a young man  
you dont know what hell get done  
You cant kick and old man see what hes become  
You are far too lazy  
You stick to your pillow with ease  
Cause youre much too lazy  
you just couldnt get off your knees  
  
I can see the love and the hate in your eyes  
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise  
What you gonna do and what you gonna say  
Im not the only one believing theres an easier way  
  
It doesnt pay to disorientate me  
It doesnt cost to be someone  
I am the vine  
And youre the branches  
  
Dont count your chickens  
Cause theyre never gonna hatch  
You cant catch a monkey with a shotgun and a sack  
Cause youre too dull baby  
You cant see the wood for the trees  
Cause youre too slow baby  
You just couldnt get off your knees  
  
I can see the love and the hate in your eyes  
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise  
What you gonna do and what you gonna say  
Im not the only one believing theres an easier way  
Whatya gonna do with the rest of your life  
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise  
  
I am the vine  
And youre the branches
