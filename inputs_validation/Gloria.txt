I try to sing this song  
II try to stand up  
But I cant find my feet  
I try I try to speak up  
But only in you Im complete  
  
Gloriain te domine  
Gloriaexultate  
GloriaGloria  
Oh Lord loosen my lips  
  
I try to sing this song  
II try to get in  
But I cant find the door  
The door is open  
Youre standing there  
You let me in  
  
Gloriain te domine  
Gloriaexultate  
Oh Lord if I had anything  
Anything at all  
Id give it to you  
Id give it to you  
  
GloriaGloria
