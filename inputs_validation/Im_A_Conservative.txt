I used to lead a quiet life  
In fact it was a bare existence  
I passed out on many floors  
I dont do that any more  
  
Hello my friends  
Is everybody happy  
Hey look me over  
lend me an ear  
Im a conservative  
  
I like the small black marks on my hands  
Im a conservative  
I like the crazy girls that I screw  
Hey I know them all well  
  
And when I run out of bread I laugh  
All the way to the bank  
Sometimes I pause for a drink  
Conservatism aint no easy job  
  
I smile in the mornings  
I live without a care  
Nothing is denied me  
And nothing ever hurts  
  
I got bored so Im making my millions  
When youre conservative you get a better break  
Youre always on the rigltt side  
When youre conservative  
  
You walk with pride  
Pride is on your side  
Pride pride pride  
Is on our side  
Oh boy  
Pride is on our side  
  
I like my beer  
I like my bread  
I love my girl  
I love my head  
  
Im in the clear man  
Im in the dear  
Because Im a conservative  
Im a conservative  
I really am  
Ohyeslam  
  
And it would mean so much to me  
If you would only be like me  
Yes it could mean so much to me  
  
Hey look me over  
lend me an ear  
Im a conservative
