My son My son why are you striving  
You cant add one thing to whats been done for you  
I did it all while I was dying  
Rest in your faith my peace will come to you  
  
For when I hear the praises start  
I want to rain upon you  
Blessings that will fill your heart  
I see no stain upon you  
Because you are my child and you know me  
To Me youre only holy  
Nothing that youve done remains  
Only what you do for Me  
  
My child My child why are you weeping  
You will not have to wait forever  
That day and that hour is in My keeping  
The day Ill bring you into Heaven  
  
For when I hear the praises start  
My child I want to rain upon you  
Blessing that will fill your heart  
I see no stain upon you  
Because you are My child and you know me  
To me youre only holy  
Nothing that youve done remains  
Only what you do in Me  
  
My precious bride the day is nearing  
When Ill take you in My arms and hold you  
I know there are so many things that youve been hearing  
But you just hold on to what I have told you  
  
For when I hear the praises start  
My bride I want to rain upon you  
Blessings that will fill your heart  
I see no stain upon you  
Because you are My child and you know Me  
To me youre only holy  
Nothing that youve done will remain  
Only what you do for me
