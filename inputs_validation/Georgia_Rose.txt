Georgia Rose Georgia Rose  
youre the most precious rose Dixie Rose  
Though we dont see quite right cause youre skins dark as night  
I know you are hidn from the light  
  
To the good Lord above we all look the same so dont hang your head in
shame  
Georgia Rose Georgia Rose dont be blue cause youre black Georgia Rose  
  
Georgia Rose Georgia Rose dont be blue  
Cause youre black Georgia Rose
