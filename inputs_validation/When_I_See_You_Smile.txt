Sometimes I wonder  
If Id ever make it through  
Through this world  
without having in you  
I just wouldnt have a clue  
Cause sometimes it seems  
Like this worlds closing in on me  
And theres no way of breaking free  
And then I see you reach for me  
Sometimes I want to give up  
want to give in  
I want to quit the fight  
And then I see you baby  
And everythings alright  
Everythings alright  
When I see you smile  
I can face the world  
Oh you know I can do anything  
When I see you smile  
I see a ray of light  
Oh I see it shining  
right through the rain  
When I see you smile  
Baby when I see you smile at me  
Oh yeah  
Baby theres nothing in this world that could ever do  
What the touch of your hand can do  
Its like nothing that I ever knew  
Hey  
And when the rain is falling  
I dont feel it  
Cause youre here with me now  
I want to ask you baby  
Its all Ill ever need  
All Ill ever need  
When I see you smile  
I can face the world  
Oh you know I can do anything  
When I see you smile  
I see a ray of light  
Oh I see it shining  
right through the rain  
When I see you smile baby  
Baby when I see you smile at me  
Sometimes I want to give up  
I want to give in  
I want to quit the fight  
Then one look at you baby  
And everythings alright  
Hey everythings alright  
Its alright  
When I see you smile  
I can face the world  
Oh you know I can do anything  
When I see you smile  
I see a ray of light  
Oh I see it shining  
right through the rain  
Yeah  
When I see you smile  
Yeah I can face the world  
Oh you know I can do anything now  
When I see you smile  
Oh yeah  
Baby when I see you smile  
Smile at me
