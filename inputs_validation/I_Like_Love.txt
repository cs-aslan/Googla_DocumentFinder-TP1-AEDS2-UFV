First of all you gotta understand  
This album is not about  
Me trying to show somebody I can do reggae music  
Or Im reggae or anything like that  
This song is about is about reaching the masses  
You know what I sayin  
As a matter of fact  
The whole MVProject is really about  
Its not about RKelly shinin  
Its about me shinin the light  
On my people in Jamaica with my music  
Cause I got fans there and they love me  
You know what I mean  
  
Dont like confrontation  
Dont like inconsideration  
Dont like false accusations  
Cant stand victimization  
Dont like starvation  
Oh I never liked discrimination  
Its not all about seperation  
Its about healing the nations  
  
Repeat x4  
I like love  
Im all about that thing called love  
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love  
  
I dont like aggravation  
Dont like humiliation  
And I cant stand defamation  
And I really dont like temptation  
Dont like exploitation  
I dont like decamation  
Its not about tribulations  
Its all about salvation  
  
Repeat x4  
I like love  
Im all about that thing called love  
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love  
  
Its all about love  
No matter where I go theres this one thing I know yeah

And if you feel me real people then put your hands up  
  
Repeat x4  
I like love
