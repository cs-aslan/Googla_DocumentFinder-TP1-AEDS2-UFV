When you made love to me tonight  
I felt as if Id died and gone to heaven  
And if thats how it feels to die  
Then lay me in your arms Im through with livin  
Ill get down on my knees and thank the good lord up above  
That Im the lucky girl you chose to love  
  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isnt me tonight  
So if you think Im braggin well youre right  
Your love has sent me flyin and Im higher than a kite  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isnt me tonight  
  
Youve got the kind of body  
That was made to give a man a lot of pleasure  
And what youre giving me tonight  
Is more than anything on earth can measure  
  
Every inch of you thats woman makes me that much more a man  
Ive just about enjoyed all that I can stand  
  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isnt me tonight  
So if you think Im braggin well youre right  
Your love has sent me flyin and Im higher than a kite  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isnt me tonight  
  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isnt me tonight  
So if you think Im braggin well youre right  
Your love has sent me flyin and Im higher than a kite  
And I feel sorry for anyone who isnt me tonight
