In the heat of the morning  
When your day is still dawning  
And your bird shes singing  
Catch your soul hes willing to fly away  
  
Packed your bags in a hurry  
Because your minds in a worry  
Mark my words youre gonna be sorry if you ever fly away  
  
Sweet little girl with the Saint Da Vincismile  
Stares at me with sadness in her eyes  
Im not sure if shes really real or makebelieve  
Maybe shes a vision that comes to only me  
  
Cause Im so tired  
Yes Im so tired  
So tired  
Yes Im so tired  
  
In the heat of the morning  
When your day is still dawning  
And your bird shes singing  
Catch your soul hes willing to fly away
