Hey  
  
Verse 1  
I know what I came to do  
And that aint gonna change  
So go ahead and talk your talk  
Cause I wont take the bait  
Im over here doing what I like  
Im over here working day and night  
And if my real aint real enough  
Im sorry for you bae

Lets find a light inside our universe now  
Where aint nobody keep on holding us down  
Just come and get it let them say what they say  
Cause Im about to put them all away
