Life goes on day after day after day after day  
Hearts torn in every way  
So ferry cross the Mersey cause this lands the place I love and here Ill
stay  
And here Ill stay  
  
People they rush every where Each with their own secret care  
So ferry cross the Mersey cause this lands the place I love and here Ill
stay  
And here Ill stay  
  
People around every corner they seem to smile and say theyll tell you  
We dont care what you name is boy Well never send you away  
Send you away Send you away Send you away  
  
So Ill continue to say heres where I always must stay  
So ferry cross the Mersey cause this lands the place I love  
Ferry cross the Mersey cause this lands the place I love and here Ill stay  
And here Ill Stay stay stay  
  
Ferry cross the Mersey cause this lands the place I love  
Ferry cross the Mersey cause this lands the place I love  
Ferry cross the Mersey cause this lands the place I love
