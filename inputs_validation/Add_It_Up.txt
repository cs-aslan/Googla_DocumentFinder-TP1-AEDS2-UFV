Day after day  
I will walk and I will play  
But the day after today  
I will stop  
And I will start  
  
Why cant I get just one kiss  
Why cant I get just one kiss  
Believe me thered be somethings that I wouldnt miss  
But I look at your pants and I need I need a kiss  
Why cant I get just one screw  
Why cant I get just one screw  
Believe me I know what to do  
But something wont let me make love to you  
  
Why cant I get just one fuck  
Why cant I get just one fuck  
I guess its something to do with luck  
  
But I waited my whole life for just one  
Day after day  
I get angry  
And I will say  
  
That the day  
Is in my sight  
When Ill take a bow  
And say goodnight  
  
Oh mamama mamamomamum  
Have you kept your eye your eye on your son  
I know youve had problems youre not the only one  
When your sugar left he left you on the run  
  
Oh mamama mamamomamum  
Take a look now at what your boy has done  
Hes walking around like hes number one  
Went downtown and you got him a gun  
  
So dont shoot shoot shoot that thing at me  
Dont shoot shoot shoot that thing at me  
You know youve got my sympathy  
But dont shoot shoot shoot that thing at me  
  
Dont shoot shoot shoot that thing at me  
Dont shoot shoot shoot that thing at me  
You know youve got my sympathy  
But dont shoot shoot shoot that thing at me  
  
Broken down kitchen at the top of the stairs  
Can I mix in with your affairs  
Share a smoke make a joke  
Grasp and reach for a leg of hope  
  
Words to memorize words hypnotize  
Words make my mouth exercise  
Words all failed the magic prize  
Nothing I can say when Im in your thighs  
  
Oh mamama moma moma mother  
I would love to love you lover  
City is restless its ready to pounce  
Oh here in your bedroom ounce for ounce  
  
Oh mamama moma moma mother  
I would love to love you lover  
City is restless its ready to pounce  
Oh here in your bedroom ounce for ounce  
  
Ive given you a decision to make  
Things to lose things to take  
Just as shes about ready to cut it up  
She says Wait a minute honey Im gonna add it up  
Add it up Add it up Add it up  
Add it up Add it up Add it up  
Add it up Add it up  
  
Day after day I get angry and I will say  
That the day is in my sight  
When Ill take a bow and say goodnight
