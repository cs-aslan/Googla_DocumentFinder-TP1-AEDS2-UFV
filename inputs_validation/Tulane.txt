Tulane and Johnny opened a novelty shop  
Back under the counter was the cream of the crop  
Evrything was clickin and the business was good  
Till one day lo and behold an officer stood  
Johnny jumped the counter but he stumbled and fell  
But Tulane made it over Johnny fell as he yelled  
  
Chorus  
Go head on Tulane he cant catch up with you  
Go Tulane he aint man enough for you  
Go Tulane use all the speed you got  
Go Tulane you know you need a lot  
Go Tulane hes laggin behind  
Go head on Tulane  
  
Go by your fathers house and tell him business is slow  
And see if he will loan us something soon as he hits the dough  
Put the cat out in the hall and rumple up the room  
Go by Doctor Kellers tell him you swallowed some perfume  
Tell him we need him quick cuz he may have to testify  
That you been sick all day and thats a perfect alibi  
  
Chorus  
  
Golet Daddy drive in case you run into the Man  
Back by the shop and get the stuff and hide it in the van  
Go back by your fathers get the money for the bail  
And bring it down and bail me out this rotten funky jail  
We gotta get a lawyer in the clique of politics  
Somebody who can win the thing or get the thing fixed  
  
Chorus  
Go head on Tulane
