You keep knockin but you cant come in  
The way you love I adore  
You always come never know where you been  
But anow Im here baby to even the score  
  
Youre up youre down  
Youre always running in place  
Triathlon if you please  
Youre always beggin me for a taste  
But I aint up to snuff if you sneeze  
  
Yak yak yak  
  
Lord you give me the bends  
Heads and tails  
Youre all out of love  
  
Chorus  
Like the reason a dog  
Has so many friends  
He wags his tail instead of his tongue  
  
Your older sister  
Shes a lot like you  
She likes to grab my microphone  
Now there aint too much she wont do  
Especially when were all alone  
  
Youre up youre down  
Youre always runnin in place  
Triathlon if you please  
Her minds on rewind and erase  
You might get shot babe  
When youre shootin the breeze  
  
Yak yak yak  
  
Lord you give me bends  
Youre heads and tails  
Are calling for love  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Your older sister  
Shes a lot like you  
And there aint too much she wont do  
  
Theres always something  
That you got to say  
I lose my mind and then I surely fade away yeah  
  
Yak yak yak  
  
Lord you give me the bends  
Youre heads and tails  
Now look what you done  
  
Chorus x2
