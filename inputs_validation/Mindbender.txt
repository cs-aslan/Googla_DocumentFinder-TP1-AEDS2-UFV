If only I could be less blind  
If only I knew what to find  
Everywhere and all of the time  
Its bending my mind  
  
Confusions prince is at my door  
The crown I wear is the one he wore  
Hes here to bring me down some more  
And bend my mind  
  
The friendly stranger calls my name  
He only wants me for his game  
But it dont matter just the same  
Ill bend his mind  
  
Ive waved my flags into the sun  
Ive fought my wars and now theyre won  
And I didnt need nobodys gun  
I bent their mind  
  
If only I could be less blind  
If only I knew what to find  
Everywhere and all of the time  
Its bending my mind
