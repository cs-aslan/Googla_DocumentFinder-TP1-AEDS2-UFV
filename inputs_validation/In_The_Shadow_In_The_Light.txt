I promise you for all my life  
Ill be always on your side  
In the shadow in the light  
  
Ill follow you wherever life goes  
But Ill always be aside  
In the shadow in the light  
  
But if we dont understand  
Hell is happy heaven is sad  
And thats the result of our brain  
Insane  
  
Caravan of life  
By day and by night  
Every tiles a part of life  
If its shadow or if its light  
  
I promise you even when the tide is high  
Ill be always on your side  
In the shadow in the light
