Pull on up  
To the soapbox stool  
Let me tell ya some stories  
About how life can be cruel  
I had big dreams  
But they turned to dust  
I need another shot of oil  
Cause its starting to rust  
  
And Im tryin to make a living  
Tryin to find my way  
Ive been bustin my ass  
To be somebody someday  
Tryin to make a living  
Tryin to get ahead  
Shootin at the moon  
But it shot me down instead  
  
Chorus  
War stories  
Im kickin and fightin for my life  
Through those war stories  
I made it through the battle of life  
And its on and on until youre long gone  
But the strong keep stickin it out  
Through those war stories  
Everybodys got em when you hit the bottom and survive  
  
I said have another drink  
This ones on me  
Let me tell ya bout pain from A to Z  
I got scars from my head to my feet  
Some like a junkyard car still rolling down the streets  
  
And Im tryin to make a dollar  
Tryin to pay my way  
Ive been bustin my balls  
And then they take it all away  
Tryin to climb the ladder  
Reaching for the sky  
I aint going down  
Until they hang me out to dry  
  
Chorus  
  
And its on and on until youre long gone  
But the strong keep stickin it out  
They got towing the line til the sun dont shine  
But all I got left to talk about  
Are those war stories  
Im kickin and fightin for my life  
Through those war stories  
I made it through the battle of life  
  
War stories  
Through those war stories  
Everybodys got em when you hit the bottom and survive
