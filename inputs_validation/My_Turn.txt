Turn out the light  
Turn yourself over to me  
Turn off the world  
Turn my feelings free  
  
Just enjoy the pleasure  
For the pleasure pleases me  
Youve been turning me on all night long  
Now its my turn  
  
You have reached the woman in me  
Through the man in you  
Let me be that woman  
Before the lovins through  
  
You just turn yourself over to me  
While I turn my feelings free  
Youve been turning me on all night long  
Now its my turn  
  
All night long  
Ive been driven to your touch  
Havent had time to give  
Ive been taking so much  
  
I know you want to hold me  
But darling youve done enough  
Youve been turning me on all night long  
Now its my turn  
  
You have reached the woman in me  
Through the man in you  
Let me be that woman  
Before the lovins through  
  
You just turn yourself over to me  
While I turn my feelings free  
Youve been turning me on all night long  
Now its my turn  
  
All night long  
Ive been driven to your touch  
Havent had time to give  
Ive been taking so much
