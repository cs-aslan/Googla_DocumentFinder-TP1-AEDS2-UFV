I built a wall in China I sank an ocean liner  
Ive wrecked homes Ive burned thrones chasing the crown  
Ive put thorns in your feet I spread plague in the streets  
Ive sprung traps confused maps chasing the crown  
  
Im chasing the crown till he bites the apple  
I was licking my lips till his Son come down  
Im chasing the crown the crown Im chasing the crown  
Im taking a turn in the right direction  
By leaving his soul in the lost and found  
Im chasing the crown Im chasing the crown  
  
I saw the tea float in Boston I saw the live wire shock them  
I made them float I made them drown chasing the crown  
I laid the desert sands I froze the polar caps  
Well theyd dry out and Id shout Hey Im chasing the crown
