In the cruel month grey morning  
I woke up freezing cold  
To possibly start over  
Before the day got old  
  
To my anger in my solitude  
I had to say goodbye  
So I turned on my ignition  
No reason to deny  
  
I95  
Alright  
From the canyons on the sidewalks  
Where the Wall St banners fly  
  
To the farmlands and the deserts  
And the flying saucer skies  
To the running of the life lines  
The highway spirits rhyme  
  
Theres a voice that speaks so clear to me  
And says  
I95  
Yeah  
  
And I say hey hey hey yeah  
Im so glad Im alive  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Im so glad I can drive  
  
Burning down I95  
Its a simple song of freedom  
And it feels like de ja vu  
Tai Jean knew about it  
  
John Lennon sang it too  
Its the ringing bell of truth and free speech  
On the radio  
Its there in the Constitution  
  
Its little sister  
Its called rock n roll  
And shes alright  
And I sing  
  
Hey hey hey yeah  
Im so glad Im alive  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Im so glad I can drive  
  
Burning down I95  
Yeah yeah  
Im so glad I can drive  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Im so glad Im alive  
Burning down I95  
Yeah  
I95  
  
Shes alright  
I95  
In daylight  
I95  
  
At nighttime too  
Shes alright  
Shes alright  
Shes alright  
Shes alright  
  
Yeah  
Said shes alright
