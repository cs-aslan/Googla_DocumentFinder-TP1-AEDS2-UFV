Let me hear you say hey hey hey Hey hey hey  
All right now let me hear you say hey hey ho Hey hey hey  
  
I hate it when a guy doesnt get the door  
Even though I told him yesterday and the day before  
I hate it when a guy doesnt get the tab  
And I have to pull my money out and that looks bad  
  
Where are the hopes where are the dreams  
My Cinderella story scene  
When do you think theyll finally see  
  
That youre not not not gonna get any better  
You wont wont wont you wont get rid of me never  
Like it or not even though shes a lot like me  
Were not the same  
  
Chorus  
And yeah yeah yeah Im a lot to handle  
You dont know trouble Im a hell of a scandal  
Me Im a scene Im a drama queen  
Im the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen  
  
All right all right  
Yeah  
  
I hate it when a guy doesnt understand  
Why a certain time of month I dont want to hold his hand  
I hate it when they go out and we stay in  
And they come home smelling like their exgirlfriend  
  
But I found my hopes I found my dreams  
My Cinderella story scene  
Now everybodys gonna see  
  
That youre not not not gonna get any better  
You wont wont wont you wont get rid of me never  
Like it or not even though shes a lot like me  
Were not the same  
  
Chorus  
  
Give me an A always give me what I want  
Give me a V be very very good to me  
R are you gonna treat me right  
I I can put up a fight  
Give me an L let me hear you scream loud let me hear you scream loud  
  
One two three four  
  
Where are the hopes where are the dreams  
My Cinderella story scene  
When do you think theyll finally see  
  
That youre not not not gonna get any better  
You wont wont wont you wont get rid of me never  
Like it or not even though shes a lot like me  
Were not the same  
  
Chorus
