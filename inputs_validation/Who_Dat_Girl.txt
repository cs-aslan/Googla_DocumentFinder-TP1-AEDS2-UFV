Hey Ms Red Carpet  
She can autograph my pockets  
Anytime anyplace anyway  
Ill be looking at everybody else watchin  
I dont wanna be obnoxious  
But this girl worth the gossip  
Take away the smile  
The tattoos now forever she very guardless  
I imagine her topless  
She might set off my rocket  
Ten nine eight seven six five four three two one  
On and poppin she mad marketing  
Attitude like we arguing  
With her by my side bring glitter to my life  
I should twitter this girl is sparkling  
  
Chorus  
She aint no rock star  
But she got groupies  
She aint no actress  
But she makes movies  
And when she struts that thing around  
Everybody be breaking their neck like  
Who dat girl who dat girl who dat girl  
She aint got riches but she got fashion  
She aint a model but cameras flashing  
And when she struts that thing around  
Everybody be breaking their neck like  
Who dat girl who dat girl who dat girl  
  
Hey I wanna know her mammas name  
Cause that where she get it from  
They aint never shot her with silicon  
Shawty is her and her shes the real one  
Touch one grab one feel one  
I wish she woulda told me that  
Aint nothing wrong bringing the old me back  
Little mamma knows my body so trophy glass  
She worth it bring me some Chloe bags  
Like damn can I be yo police badge  
Pull it up get a little cozy and  
Woman is sorta like and oldie jam  
Record some ssh  
On a playboy cam  
She aint no actress  
The movie from my mattress  
Rock star none of that practice  
But still she got fanatics  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh oh oh look at her goo ooh ooh  
I wanna know ooh ooh  
Who dat girl who dat girl who dat girl  
  
Ooh oh oh look at her goo ooh ooh  
I wanna know ooh ooh  
Who dat girl who dat girl who dat girl  
  
Chorus
