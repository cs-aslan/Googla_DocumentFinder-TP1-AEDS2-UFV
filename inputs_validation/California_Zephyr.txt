From the Great Salt Lakes of Utah  
To Californias golden shore  
Colorado and Nevada  
Through the deserts burnin door  
While shes circlin through the canyons  
Cant you see that mountain stream  
Its the California Zephyr  
The Union Pacific Queen  
See her rockin see her rollin  
As she rambles on her way  
She left LA this mornin  
Burnin up the right of way  
In the distance hear her moanin  
Hear her lonesome whistle scream  
Its the California Zephyr  
The Union Pacific Queen  
She leaves the city of the angels  
Headin for ole Santa Fe  
Shes a makin nauts shes makin time  
Just watch her swing and sway  
And from way out in the darkness  
See that headlight gleam  
Its the California Zephyr  
The Union Pacific Queen  
From the Great Salt Lakes of Utah  
To Californias golden shore  
Colorado and Nevada  
Through the deserts burnin door  
While shes circlin through the canyons  
Cant you see that mountain stream  
Its the California Zephyr  
The Union Pacific Queen
