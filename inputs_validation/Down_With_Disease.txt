Down with disease  
Three weeks in my bed  
Trying to stop these demons that keep dancing in my head  
  
Down with disease  
Up before the dawn  
A thousand barefoot children outside dancing on my lawn and I keep  
  
Waiting for the time when I can finally say  
That this has all been wonderful but now Im on my way  
But when I think its time to leave it all behind  
I try to find a way but theres nothing I can say to make it stop  
  
Down with disease and the jungles in my mind  
Theyre climbing up my waterfalls and swingin on my vines  
So I try to hear the music but Im always losing time  
Cause theyre stepping on my rhythm and theyre stealin all my lines  
Stealin all my lines and I keep  
  
Waiting for the time when I can finally say  
That this has all been wonderful but now Im on my way  
But when I think its time to leave it all behind  
I try to find a way but theres nothing I can say to make it stop
