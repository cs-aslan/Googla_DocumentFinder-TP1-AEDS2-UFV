You dont know the meaning  
Of the words I love you so  
But when youve found your one love  
Then youll know  
  
You dont know the heartache  
Or the laughter youll forego  
Until youve lost that one love  
Then youll know  
  
Now you pretend to care for me  
But honey if you do  
Why dont you give the kind of kiss  
I always give to you  
  
So Ive just made my mind up  
Even though my tears will flow  
Go on and find a new love  
Then youll know  
  
Repeat last two verses  
  
Then youll know
