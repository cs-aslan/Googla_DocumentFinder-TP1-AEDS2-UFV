Yeah I found nowhere  
It got to know me  
Let me sleep all day  
Spent the money  
I havent felt my legs  
Since the summer  
And I dont call my friends  
Forgot the numbers  
  
VIP 223  
Have my chances  
They have me  
Now stay up nights  
Watch TV  
Im a country sad  
Im a ballad man  
  
Im on a come back roll  
Yeah Im a bizzard  
And in my motor home  
Sweat on my pillow all night  
  
VIP 223  
Have my chances  
They have me  
Now stay up nights  
Watch TV  
Im a country sad  
Im a ballad man
