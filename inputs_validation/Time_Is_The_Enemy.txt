Those days we gave our all  
Unaffected  
I bravely faced the fall  
No reflection  
Freak armies of the night  
Misdirected  
I fought the useless fight  
Unprotected  
  
Dont cry for me  
Time is the enemy  
Soon Ill be free  
I surrender  
Sweet moon she marks the year  
Unreflected  
How sad she has no tears  
So neglected  
  
Dont cry for me  
Time is the enemy  
Soon Ill be free  
I surrender
