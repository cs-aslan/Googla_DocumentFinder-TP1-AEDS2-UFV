Do you remember what you said to me the day I met you  
Like yesterday I still can hear your voice you promised to be  
Still in my life no matter what you had to do to be there  
Well its been a while and here we are lookin back on times that we shared  
  
I still imagine us being young and so in love  
Never apart you were my heart  
Seems like its always just been us  
  
I remember we were in the park  
Holding hands and you said to me  
Im the only thing you need  
And I would make your life complete  
If I said Id be your girl  
You would stay with me forever  
Boy you never let me down  
Through it all youre still around  
Still around yeah  
  
I still believe in all the things you said to me in those days  
You gave me love and kept your word with every promise you made  
I sing your favorite song inside my head when youre not with me  
Until you come back home and take me in your arms and hold me  
  
I can imagine us being old and still in love  
Never apart you are my heart  
Makes me smile were still in love  
  
I remember we were in the park  
Holding hands and you said to me  
Im the only thing you need  
And I would make your life complete  
If I said Id be your girl  
You would stay with me forever  
Boy you never let me down  
Through it all youre still around  
  
Looking back through all the years  
  
Heh  
You remember the first time I went to your house  
And your father looked at me like I had three heads  
And I will never forget the day  
Heh  
We were so in love  
Looking back through all the years  
You were so beautiful and so young  
And I will never forget the day you came into my life and what you said to
me  
I cant believe youre still mine  
Thats crazy  
I love you  
  
I remember we were in the park we were in the park  
Holding hands and you said to me holding hands  
Im the only thing you need  
And I would make your life complete and I would your life complete  
If I said Id be your girl  
You would stay with me forever Im still your girl  
Boy you never let me down  
Through it all youre still around Ill never let you down my baby  
  
I remember we were in the park  
Holding hands and you said to me  
Im the only thing you need  
And I would make your life complete  
If I said Id be your girl said Id be your girl and  
You would stay with me forever  
Boy you never let me down  
Through it all youre still around  
Still around yeah
