I know you wanna leave me  
But I refuse to let you go  
If I have to beg plead for your sympathy  
I dont mind cause you mean that much to me  
  
Aint to proud to beg sweet darling  
Please dont leave me girl dont you go  
Aint to proud to plead baby baby  
Please dont leave me girl dont you go  
Now Ive heard a crying man is half a man  
With no sense of pride  
But if I have to cry to keep you  
I dont mind weeping  
If itll keep you by my side  
Aint to proud to beg sweet darling  
Please dont leave me girl dont you go  
Dont you go away  
Aint to proud to plead baby baby  
Please dont leave me girl dont you go  
Aint to proud to beg sweet darling  
Aint to proud to plead baby baby  
Please dont leave me girl dont you go  
INSTRUMENTAL  
Dont you go away

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day  
Just to keep you from walking away  
Let your friends laugh even this I can stand  
Cause I wanna keep you any way I can  
Aint to proud to beg sweet darling  
Please dont leave me girl dont you go  
Aint to proud to plead baby baby
