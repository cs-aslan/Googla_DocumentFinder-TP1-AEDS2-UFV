Try to face up to the blinding sun  
Racing for the final word to come  
Facing up its hard to stay devout  
I can see the sand and its running out  
And its running out  
  
We quote each other only when were wrong  
We tear out the threads and move along  
We cant seem to find common ground  
I can see the sand and its running out  
  
It was only circumstances  
But its the difference  
It gets in the way  
No race is run in this direction  
  
You cant break even  
You cant even quit the game  
The current drags to the bottom  
A hemorrhage that moves us around  
  
It pulls and beckons in a strong direction  
High water forever bringing us down  
I can see the sand and its running out  
Its running out  
  
It was only circumstances  
But its the difference  
It gets in the way  
No race is run in this direction  
You cant break even  
  
You cant even quit the game
