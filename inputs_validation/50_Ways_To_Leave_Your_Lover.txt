The problem is all inside your head she said to me  
The answer is easy if you take it logically  
Id like to help you in your struggle to be free  
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover  
  
She said its really not my habit to intrude  
Furthermore I hope my meaning wont be lost or misconstrued  
But Ill repeat myself at the risk of being crude  
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover  
Fifty ways to leave your lover  
  
You just slip out the back Jack  
Make a new plan Stan  
You dont need to be coy Roy  
Just get yourself free  
Hop on the bus Gus  
You dont need to discuss much  
Just drop off the key Lee  
And get yourself free  
  
She said it grieves me so to see you in such pain  
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again  
I said I appreciate that and would you please explain  
About the fifty ways  
  
She said why dont we both just sleep on it tonight  
And I believe in the morning youll begin to see the light  
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right  
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover  
Fifty ways to leave your lover  
  
You just slip out the back Jack  
Make a new plan Stan  
You dont need to be coy Roy  
Just get yourself free  
Hop on the bus Gus  
You dont need to discuss much  
Just drop off the key Lee  
And get yourself free
