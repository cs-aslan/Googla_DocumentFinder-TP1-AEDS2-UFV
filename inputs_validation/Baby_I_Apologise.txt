Love my baby in the afternoon  
But shes cryin  
Shes cryin  
  
Told my baby in the afternoon  
But she dont like it  
She dont like it  
Baby used to love me so  
  
Chorus  
Baby I apologise  
For tellin them dirty lies  
Ive had my fun  
But now its gone  
Baby I apologise  
  
Loved her in the mornin  
In the evenin too  
But she wont do what I want to  
  
Kicked me out of my own front room  
For my lyin  
My dirty lyin  
Baby you do say  
  
Chorus  
  
Spoken  
You know my darlin  
I was a broken man  
And my dreams had fell apart  
And then a voice from above  
Told me the truth of the world below  
And my darlin  
Id just like to say one more time  
Please come back  
  
Chorus  
  
Loved her in the mornin  
In the evenin too  
But she wont do what I want to  
  
Kicked me out of my own front room  
For my lyin  
My dirty lyin  
Baby used to love me so  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus
