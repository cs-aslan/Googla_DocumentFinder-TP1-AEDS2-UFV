Youve got a problem  
With the reason why  
An asymmetric haircut  
And a painted eye  
Its psychological  
Psychological  
  
Is it a cry for help  
Or call to arms  
Frustration  
False alarms  
Its psychological  
All in the mind  
  
Theres something in the attic  
And it smells so bad  
An undertaker  
In a bowler hat  
Psychological  
Whats that spilt  
On the kitchen floor  
Whos that knocking  
On the cellar door  
Its psychological  
Or is it only your imagination  
Driving me crazy crazy  
Baby baby please  
  
Its psychological  
Psychological  
  
I thought I heard a baby cry  
I thought I heard a train  
Down in the cemetery  
Cellophane  
  
Its second nature to you  
All in the mind  
Its psychological  
Psychological  
Its psychological  
Psychological
