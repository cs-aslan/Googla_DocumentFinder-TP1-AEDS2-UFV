Im glad I got to see you once again  
Although were through I still love you  
I guess Ill have to call you just a friend  
Cause someone new has just stepped in  
I try to say that I dont really miss you  
But in my heart I know its just a lie  
And if someday his love should prove untrue  
Ill be around when he has said goodbye  
I try to say that I dont really miss you  
But in my heart I know its just a lie  
And if someday his love should prove untrue  
Ill be around when he has said goodbye  
Goodbye
