How soon tears begin to tumble  
From her laughing eyes  
Shes been talking to somebody  
Who told her lies  
Shell never trust in anybody no more  
Who told her lies  
Shell never trust in anybody no more  
  
How can I begin to reach her  
Let her know the truth  
What that someone has been saying  
Is only lies  
Shell never trust in anybody no more  
Its only lies  
Shell never trust in anybody no more  
  
How could she think that I  
Would take advantage of a girl like her  
How could she think that I  
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her  
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her  
  
Like a flower she is fading  
Soon shell wilt and die  
If she doesnt get the sunlight  
That I can give  
Shell never trust in anybody no more  
That I can give  
Shell never trust in anybody no more  
  
How could she think that I  
Would take advantage of a girl like her  
How could she think that I  
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her  
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her  
  
Like a flower she is fading  
Soon shell wilt and die  
If she doesnt get the sunlight  
That I can give  
Shell never trust in anybody no more  
That I can give  
Shell never trust in anybody no more
