Listen up  
  
You said that you would treat me right  
But now all we do is fight  
You said that you would love me long  
But oh boy you were wrong  
  
You should have known that I dont play  
So get outta my fucking way and  
  
Dont hold it against me baby  
Youre the one who forced me to leave  
So dont hold it against me  
  
Cause you had it  
But you lost it  
And youll never get it  
Again  
  
You said that you would buy me rings  
But my love dont cost a thing  
You said that Im the only girl  
But theres another in your world  
  
You should have known that I dont play  
So get outta my fucking way and  
  
Dont hold it against me baby  
Youre the one who forced me to leave  
So dont hold it against me  
  
Cause you had it  
But you lost it  
And youll never get it  
Again  
  
Boom boom boom  
Youre blowing up my  
Boom boom  
Youre blowing up my love  
  
Boom boom boom  
Youre blowing up my  
Boom boom  
Youre blowing up my  
LOVE  
  
Yeah you should have known that I dont play  
So get outta my fucking way and  
  
Dont hold it against me baby  
Youre the one who forced me to leave  
So dont hold it against me  
  
Cause you had it  
But you lost it  
And youll never get it  
Again
