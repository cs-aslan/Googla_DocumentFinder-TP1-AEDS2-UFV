Penny lover dont you make me cry  
Cant you see girl who my hearts beating for  
Youre the only girl that I adore  
  
The first time I saw you

Honey you came along and captured my heart  
Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss  
When Im all alone its you that I miss  
Girl a love like yours is hard to resist
