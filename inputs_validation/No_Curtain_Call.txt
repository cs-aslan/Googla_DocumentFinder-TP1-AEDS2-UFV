You say you need someone  
But everybody does  
Im no different than you  
I just believe what I do  
  
You point your finger at  
Everyone but yourself  
And blame the ones that you love  
Who are only trying to help  
  
As its winding down to zero  
I am yours like a hero  
Ill see this through  
Theres so much me and you  
Take this enemy together  
Fight these demons off forever forever forever forever  
  
Chorus  
Five four three two one I wont stop until its done  
No curtain call I will not fall  
This may be the one weve been waiting for  
No curtain call just take it all  
  
I have no time for fear  
Or people in my ear  
Head down and running so fast  
Try not to dwell on the past  
  
Im fighting through this pain  
And things I cannot change  
Running right into the flame  
Rather than running away  
  
As its winding down to zero  
I am yours like a hero  
Ill see this through  
Theres so much me and you  
Take this enemy together  
Fight these demons off forever forever forever forever  
  
Chorus  
  
Sweat drips down from every angle  
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet  
You turn up the heat  
Tossing and turning you cannot sleep  
Quietly weep youre in too deep  
  
Chorus x2
