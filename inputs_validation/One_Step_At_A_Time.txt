Footsteps  
  
Hurry up and wait  
So close but so far away  
Everything that youve always dreamed of  
Close enough for you to taste  
But you just cant touch  
  
Bridge  
You wanna show the world but no one knows your name yet  
Wonder when and where and how youre gonna make it  
You know you can if you get the chance  
In your face and the door keeps slamming  
Now youre feeling more and more frustrated  
And youre getting all kind of impatient waiting  
We live and we learn to take  
  
Chorus  
One step at a time  
Theres no need to rush  
Its like learning to fly  
Or falling in love  
Its gonna happen when its  
Supposed to happen that we  
Find the reasons why  
One step at a time  
  
Verse 2  
You believe and you doubt  
Youre confused you got it all figured out  
Everything that you always wished for  
Could be yours should be yours would be yours  
If they only knew  
  
Bridge  
You wanna show the world but no one knows your name yet  
Wonder when and where and how youre gonna make it  
You know you can if you get the chance  
In your face and the door keeps slamming  
Now youre feeling more and more frustrated  
And youre getting all kind of impatient waiting  
We live and we learn to take  
  
Chorus  
One step at a time  
Theres no need to rush  
Its like learning to fly  
Or falling in love  
Its gonna happen when its  
Supposed to happen that we  
Find the reasons why  
One step at a time  
  
Verse 3  
When you cant wait any longer  
But theres no end in sight  
When you need to find the strength  
Its the faith that makes you stronger  
The only way we get there  
Is one step at a time  
  
Chorus  
Take one step at a time  
Theres no need to rush  
Its like learning to fly  
Or falling in love  
Its gonna happen when its  
Supposed to happen that we  
Find the reasons why  
One step at a time  
  
Chorus  
One step at a time  
Theres no need to rush  
Its like learning to fly  
Or falling in love  
Its gonna happen when its  
Supposed to happen that we  
Find the reasons why  
One step at a time
