Im standing in the backyard  
Listening to the party Inside  
Tonight Im drinkin in the forgiveness  
This life provides  
The scars we carry remain but the pain slips away it seems  
Oh wont you baby be in my book of dreams  
  
Im watchin you through the window  
With your girlfriends from back home  
Youre showin off your dress  
Theres laughter and a toast  
From your daddy to the prettiest bride hes ever seen  
Oh wont you baby be in my book of dreams  
  
In the darkness my fingers slip across your skin  
I feel your sweet reply  
The room fades away and suddenly Im way up high  
Just holdin you to me  
As through the window the moonlight streams  
Oh wont you baby be in my book of dreams  
  
Now the ritual begins  
Neath the wedding garland we meet as strangers  
The dance floor is alive with beauty  
Mystery and danger  
We dance out neath the stars ancient light into the darkening trees  
Oh wont you baby be in my book of dreams
