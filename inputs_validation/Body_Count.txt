All the young kids learn to dance in the combat zone  
Never dared to take a chance  
Goin home alone  
But it gets so very cold  
When its late at night  
Leave the foxholes on their own  
Do you sleep well at night  
Bodycount Feeling hot  
Bodycount Keeping warm  
Friends are playing with danger  
They dont know where its found  
With their casual letters  
Its just another chain  
Youve lost the innocence  
That youve never found  
Standing in the dmz  
Dont get turned around  
Body count Feeling hot  
Body count Vietnam  
Its not the game Well its a scar  
And they wont let you wear your khakis  
And your Izods anymore  
You can go get shot to hell  
They dont want you anymore because  
All the young kids learn to dance  
In the combat zone  
Never dare to take a chance  
Youre going home alone  
Military metaphors  
Are metaphors no more  
Keeping up with protocol  
Youre dancin off to war  
Body count feeling hot  
Body count Vietnam  
Do you sleep well at night  
Body Count Vietnam  
They can say what they want  
But you have your doubts  
Its not what youve lost  
Its what your without  
When I ran so far  
And they just turned away  
I doesnt bother me by the light of day  
But at night I hear your call  
Late at night I hear your call  
I saw the mirror that you broke today  
I saw the ceiling falling down your way  
When they looked at you you could turn away  
You didnt bother then by the light of day Youll stay  
But at night I hear your call  
Late at night I hear your call  
You said that you could turn away  
I knew that you going to stay  
The walls are falling all around  
They pinned you down onto the ground  
But at night I hear your call  
Vietnam I hear you call
