When you light those candles  
Up there on that mantle  
Setting the mood  
I just lie there staring silently preparing  
To love on you  
I can feel the heat from across the room  
Aint it wild what a little flame can make you wanna do  
  
I melt  
Every time you look at me that way  
It never fails  
Any time any place  
This burn in me is the coolest thing that Ive ever felt  
I melt  
  
Dont know how you do it  
I love the way I lose it every time  
And whats even better  
Is knowing that forever youre all mine  
The closer you get the more my body aches  
One little stare from you is all it takes  
  
I melt  
Every time you look at me that way  
It never fails  
Any time any place  
This burn in me is the coolest thing that Ive ever felt  
I melt  
  
I melt  
Every time you look at me that way  
It never fails  
Any time any place  
This burn in me is the coolest thing that Ive ever felt  
I melt  
  
Every time you look at me that way  
I melt  
I melt
