Whats the use in staying  
When everythings a lie  
I hear what youre saying  
And it makes me want to cry  
  
You know the truth is so overrated  
That should come as no surprise  
Its all so complicated  
Especially in these times  
  
Dont it make you crazy  
Dont it make you ask yourself why  
Nobodys got an answer  
Especially in these times  
  
Life is like a puzzle  
Best to chose the edges first  
And work back to the middle  
To the places where it hurts  
  
Lately Ive been thinkin  
Maybe theres a chance for us  
If we take it slow now  
And dont expect too much  
  
Dont it make you wonder  
Dont it make you ask yourself why  
Nobodys got an answer  
Especially in these times  
And dont it make you crazy  
Dont it make you ask yourself why  
Nobodys got an answer  
Especially in these times  
  
Ooh ooh  
Whats the use in stayin when everythings a lie  
And theres nothing sacred especially in these times  
  
Hey dont it make you crazy  
Dont it make you ask yourself why  
Nobodys got an answer  
Especially in these times  
And dont it make you wonder  
Dont it make you ask yourself why  
Nobodys got an answer  
Especially in these times  
In these times
