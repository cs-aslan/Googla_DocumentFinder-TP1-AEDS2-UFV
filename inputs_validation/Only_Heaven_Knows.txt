Why ask Why  
Show yourself some mercy  
Dont be shy  
You dont have to look away  
Its alright  
You dont have to know the answers  
In your heart you know youll do  
The Very best you can  
  
Sail away tonight on the ocean of forgiveness  
We cannot decide which way the wind will blow  
Baby close your eyes let go of tomorrow  
Some things in life only heaven knows  
  
Face the sky like I never heard you  
Live your life you dont have to be afraid  
Here inside are those who truly love you  
theres nothing you can ever do  
To make them turn away  
  
Sail away tonight  
Us now baby  
Oohh now and dont you cry  
Say a little prayer to heaven  
And I will sing a lullaby  
  
Sail Away tonight
