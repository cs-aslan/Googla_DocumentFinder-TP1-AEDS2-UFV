A woman made a man  
A man he made a house  
And when they lay together  
Little creatures all come out  
  
Well Ive seen sex and I think its alright  
It makes those little creatures come to life  
I can laugh or I can turn away  
Well Ive seen sex and I think its okay  
  
We are creatures creatures of love  
We are creatures creatures of love  
From the sleep of reason a life is born  
We are creatures creatures of love  
  
Its okay to be afraid  
When the blue sparks hit your brain  
We can love one another  
Ive been told that its okay  
  
Doctor doctor tell me what I am  
Am I one of those human beings  
Well I can laugh or I can learn to think  
So help me now to find out what I feel  
  
We are creatures creatures of love  
We are creatures creatures of love  
Weve been here forever before you were born  
We are creatures of love We are creatures of love  
  
A man can drive his car  
And a woman can be a boss  
Im a monkey and a flower  
Im everything at once  
  
Well a woman and a man can be together  
If they decide to theyll make little creatures  
Watch em now  
Little creature of love  
With two arms and two legs  
From a moment of passion  
Now they cover the bed  
  
We are creatures of love we are creatures of love  
We are creatures creatures of love  
We are creatures creatures of love  
From the sleep of reason a life is born  
We are creatures of love we are creatures of love
