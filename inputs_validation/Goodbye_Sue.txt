They were standing in a crowded station  
So unaware  
Of all the people there  
I didnt mean to hear their conversation  
But anyone could tell  
It was their last farewell  
  
Goodbye Sue  
All the best of luck to you  
Youve been my only gal  
whats more my best pal  
  
Please dont cry  
Smile until the clouds roll by  
Dont kiss me dear just walk away  
Or I could never ever say  
Goodbye goodbye Sue  
  
Goodbye Sue My little Sue  
All the best of luck to you Good luck to you  
Youve been my only gal  
whats more my best pal  
My best pal  
  
Please dont cry  
Smile until the clouds roll by  
Dont kiss me dear just walk away  
Or I could never ever say  
Goodbye goodbye Sue
