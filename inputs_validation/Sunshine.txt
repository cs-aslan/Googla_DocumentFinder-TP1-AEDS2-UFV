ZRo talking  
Yes sir ZRo Lil Keke Screw to Mo City  
CMG KMJ this how it go  
  
Chorus  
Sunshine living in the ghetto daily trying to find  
Sunshine trying to make a million hustling got to dodge  
One time I keep my head up even though I feel like giving up  
Sometimes Keep your head up trying to find sunshine  
  
ZRo  
Man what happened to the sun on my lawn its so gloomy and grey  
I got a feeling 5O gone try to do me today  
Nothing but backstreets for me cause I dont need a vacation  
Looking for front run up that seem the only compensation  
The hood is on fire other soldiers wont let it down  
They aint set tripping but out here jacking has been alive  
Misery spinning what they clicking for no reason at all  
Even intentions of stacking paper they pleasing them all  
And outside smelling like nothing but formaldrahide  
Its an everyday suicide RIP to the ones that died  
Wake up before you get caught up dont keep on selling your soul  
Until your life fall up you got to try to find  
  
Chorus  
Lil Keke  
We living in a world thats dirty and so shife  
You trying to figure out this the game thats called life  
These days is cold and got me searching for my soul  
Like paper bags and lawn chairs man you unfold  
Im looking out my window for some sunshine  
Im trying to give it up cause I swear its my time  
I five petreat and start thinking about my sins  
Roll up another square and start thinking about the benz  
Talent and skills is what Im bringing  
New homes and microphones got the cell phone ringing  
Push play on the deck to let my mind collect  
And try to mash on the gas with no time to sweat  
This the ghetto and thats all I know  
Another episode from the young don and Ro  
If the family is tight then everythings alright  
So quick to catch flight for the sunlight uh  
  
Chorus  
ZRo  
Seem like I cant stand the rain prosecution and struggle up in my brain  
Got to tell me slow down if you can see all of my veins  
Cause I aint having none of that riff raff to get back and blood  
Keep my enemy close to me cause your killer be your cause  
I wish I was able to socialize with whyall  
Instead of trading war stories and taking lies from whyall  
Its how it be though Lil Keke and ZRo we on the grind  
Long as they talking about us we know we staying on they mind  
Dont hate us congratulate us why whyall turning up whyall nose  
Cause its been we be spittng straight be burning up whyall glow  
Want to take it away from pin and pad and pick up a gun  
You better repent my dog its over you done better try to find  
  
Chorus  2x
