Hooray for the last of the madness  
Hooray for no more misery  
Cause Im in the middle of darkness  
Ya see no hopes a dangerous thing  
  
Come on and kill me  
I know thats what you want  
Kill me I know thats what you want  
Kill me I know thats all you want  
Kill me I know thats all you all that you want  
  
One way takes away all the sadness  
One way take away all of me  
You pushed me to a suicide darkness  
Gimme some death mama my names misery  
  
Come on and kill me  
I know thats what you want  
Kill me I want to die in your arms forever  
Kill me I know thats what you want  
Kill me so my tortured eyes  
Never see you again  
  
Theres hate on face the last that Ill ever see  
As I stare into the eyes of my misery  
And Ill leave you with the memory of me  
My sweetest revenge lies here in your misery  
  
Hooray for the horror of darkness  
Horray for the horror is me  
Im inside on the dark ride of madness  
Gimme some death daddy my names misery  
  
Come on and kill me  
I know thats what you want  
Kill me I want to die in your arms forever  
Kill me I know thats what you want  
Kill me so my tortured eyes  
Never see you again  
So I never see you again  
So I never see you again
