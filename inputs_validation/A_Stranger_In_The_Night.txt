Key of d  
d Im lonesome for someone to g kiss me good  d night  
Just the way you used to a7 do  
My d achin heart needs someone to g shine loves d light  
For without you Ill a7 always be d blue  
  
1st chorus  
d if I g dont have you to d help me along  
I g know I can never go d right  
With  g out you beside me to d show me the way  
Im lost like a a7 stranger in the d night  
  
Like a lonely dove that flies from pine to pine  
My heart cant be gay and light  
Like sightless eyes that will never see the sun  
Im lost like a stranger in the night  
  
2nd chorus  
Theres no need for me to even try  
Nothin will turn out right  
When I lost your love I lost the will to live  
And Im lost like a stranger in the night  
  
3rd chorus  
Like a broken heart thats lost on lifes sea  
Tho I pray with all my might  
I know I cant face to  morrow alone  
And Im lost like a stranger in the night
