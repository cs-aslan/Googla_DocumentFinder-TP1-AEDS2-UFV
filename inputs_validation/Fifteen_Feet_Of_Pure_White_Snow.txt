Where is Mona Shes long gone  
Where is Mary Shes taken her along  
But they havent put their mittens on  
And theres fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Where is Michael Where is Mark  
Where is Mathew now its getting dark  
Where is John They are all out back  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Would you please put down that telephone  
Were under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
I waved to my neighbor my neighbor waved to me  
But my neighbor is my enemy  
I kept waving my arms till I could not see  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Is anybody out there please  
Its too quiet in here and Im beginning to freeze  
Ive got icicles hanging from my knees  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Is there anybody here who feels this low  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Is it any wonder  
Oh my Lord oh my Lord  
Oh my Lord oh my Lord  
Doctor doctor Im going mad  
This is the worst day Ive ever had  
I cant remember ever feeling this bad  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Wheres my nurse I need some healing  
Ive been paralyzed by a lack of feeling  
I cant even find anything worth stealing  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Is there anyone else here who doesnt know  
Were under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Is it any wonder  
Oh my Lord oh my Lord  
Oh my Lord oh my Lord  
Save yourself help yourself  
Save yourself help yourself  
Save yourself help yourself  
Save yourself help yourself
