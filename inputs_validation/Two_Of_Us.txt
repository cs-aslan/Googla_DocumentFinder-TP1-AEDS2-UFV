Look at me Im a speck of sand  
And Im building dreams in a strangers land  
Tell me why do I care  
Tell me why do I care  
  
Every time that Im feeling down oh they  
Pick me up and they spin me round  
Tell me where do we go  
Tell me where do we go from here  
  
What are we gonna find out find out  
What are we gonna find out find out  
Leave the wilderness and as long as theres dreams  
Just as long as theres two of us  
Just as long as theres two of us Ill carry on  
  
Wont you hold me  
  
When is man gonna find out find out  
When are we gonna find out find out  
What the universe is just waiting to here  
Just as long as theres two of us  
Just as long as theres two of us  
Just as long as theres two of us  
Well carry on
