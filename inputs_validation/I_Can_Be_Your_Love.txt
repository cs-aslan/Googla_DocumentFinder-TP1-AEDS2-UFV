I just wanna let you know  
I will never have to let you go  
I can be your love again  
Just remember once again  
When were dancing in the Londons rain  
  
Slow down slow down slow down  
You broken my heart again  
Broken my soul again  
Move on move on move on  
I feel like Im going down  
Tell me whats going on  
  
I just wanna let you know  
I will never have to let you go  
I can be your love again  
Just remember once again  
When were dancing in the Londons rain  
I can be your love again  
  
I just wanna let you know  
I will never have to let you go  
I can be your love again  
Just remember once again  
When were dancing in the Londons rain  
I can be your love again  
  
Take control take control  
Take me everything I got inside my empty soul  
Walk with me stay with me  
And I show how Ill be  
  
I just wanna let you know  
I will never have to let you go  
I can be your love again  
Just remember once again  
When were dancing in the Londons rain  
I can be your love again  
  
I can be your love again  
  
I just wanna let you know  
I will never have to let you go  
I can be your love again  
Just remember once again  
When were dancing in the Londons rain  
  
I just wanna let you know  
I will never have to let you go  
I can be your love again  
Just remember once again  
When were dancing in the Londons rain  
I can be your love again  
I can be your love again
