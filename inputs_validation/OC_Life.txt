Wannabe a member wannabe a name  
Wannabe a local face that plays the social games  
Dancing through a time will bring you dinosaur trends  
The limits of your mind is where the county line ends  
Listen to the media present it all as fact  
Following the lead cause you dont know how to act  
Travel in a straight line cause you dont know your own way  
Theyll get you in the end before you know youll have a say  
  
This O C Life is not the life for me  
Insulated world trade your happy thoughts  
O C Life is not the life so free  
 For you girls and boys  
  
Wannabe a member wanna have some fame  
Fighting to stay ahead a part of the game  
Atm and starbucks on every corner are the norm  
Environment so sterile itll get you to conform  
714 wear it like a brand  
Contaminated future is   
Fight all their rules I dont see a better way  
Guess youre really in before you know youll have a say  
  
This O C Life is not the life for me  
Insulated world riot out your thoughts  
O C Life is not the life so free  
Pressure is for real with artificial joys  
 For you girls and boys  
  
Check you out  
Youre all  fiend
