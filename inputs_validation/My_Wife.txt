My lifes  
In jeopardy  
Murdered in cold blood is what Im gonna be  
I havent been home since Friday night and now my wife  
Is comin after me  
  
Give me police protection  
Gonna buy a gun so I can look after number one  
Give me a bodyguard  
A black belt judo expert  
With a machine gun  
  
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane  
When she catches up with me  
Wont be no time to explain  
She thinks Ive been with another woman  
And thats enough  
To send her halfinsane  
  
Gonna buy a fast car put on my lead boots and take a long long drive  
I may end up spendin all my money  
But Ill still be alive  
  
All I did was have a bit too much to drink  
And I picked the wrong precinct  
Got picked up by the law and now I aint got time to think  
  
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane  
When she catches up with me  
Wont be no time to explain  
She thinks Ive been with another woman  
And thats enough  
To send her halfinsane  
  
Gonna buy a fast car put on my lead boots and take a long long drive  
I may end up spendin all my money  
But Ill still be alive  
  
And Im oh so tired of running  
Gonna lay down on the floor  
I gotta rest some time  
So I can get to run some more  
Yeah  
  
Shes comin

Shes comin  
Shes comin  
Shes comin  
Shes comin  
Shes comin  
Shes comin  
Shes comin
