I guess I should have stayed in bed  
My pillow wrapped round my head  
Instead of waking up to find  
A nightmare of a different kind  
She went away  
This just doesnt seem to be my day  
  
She didnt have to say a lot  
Her pretty eyes revealed the plot  
Twas someone else she want more  
And so I walked her to the door  
What can I say  
This just doesnt seem to be my day  
  
My oh my how sad am I  
How I wish she would have stayed  
This just doesnt seem to be my day  
  
My whole world is upside down  
She turned my smile into a frown  
Its such a pity the shape Im in  
I must get on my feet again  
Cant stay this way  
This just doesnt seem to be my day
