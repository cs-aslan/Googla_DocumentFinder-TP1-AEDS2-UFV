You think youre so smart you think that youd throw my heart  
Dont at your feet every time that you walk by  
But I I got news for you cause I dont care for you and  
I dont care honey if you love me or not  
If you were half as smart as you think you are  
The world would be astanding at your door  
But I I wont be there cause I no longer care and  
I dont want you around me anymore  
  
Because you cant have your way you tell me every day  
I should grow up stop acting like a child  
But I I think its you thats got some growing to do  
And honey I think its gonna take you quite a while  
  
If you were half as smart as you think you are  
The world would be astanding at your door  
But I I wont be there cause I no longer care and  
I dont want you around me anymore
