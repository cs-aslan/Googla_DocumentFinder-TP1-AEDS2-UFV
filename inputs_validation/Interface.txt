Dont just sit there and stare at me  
Dont just sit there and watch me bleed  
Im losing you and you youre losing me  
Im tired of what we are  
Im tired of all the pain  
Im losing you and you youre losing me  
Faace lies flat  
I see my reflection  
Download thoughts  
But your files are corrupted  
Dont just sit there and stare at me  
Dont just sit there and watch me bleed  
Im losing you and you youre losing me  
Im tired of what we are  
Im tired of all the pain  
Im losing you and you youre losing me  
Time stands still  
And youre frozen in motion  
Held down your escape  
But youre crashing  
Youre crashing  
Dont just sit there and stare at me  
Dont just sit there and watch me bleed  
Im losing you and you youre losing me  
Im tired of what we are  
Im tired of all the pain  
Im losing you were losing
