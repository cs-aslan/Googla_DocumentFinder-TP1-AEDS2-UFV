Oh Shannon  
I might be dreaming  
The stars fell down on the factory  
The cathedrals repeating the light receding  
Bells on another day  
Have you ever seen my face  
Fast asleep and dreaming  
Oh Shannon  
The lightning fell  
Theres an army down by the riverside  
But I might be dreaming  
I can see that you dont believe me  
And I might be dreaming  
If I dip into your water  
Fall through my reflection  
I will shadow myself anyway  
Have you ever seen my face  
Fast asleep and dreaming  
And it dont seem right  
That I dont get no sleep at night  
Whats the river gonna know about leaving  
Oh Shannon  
The soldiers are coming  
The guns are drumming the night away  
Rain rain go away  
Come again some other day  
When I got time for believing  
Have you ever seen my face  
Fast asleep and dreaming  
Yeah What is there left to believe in  
Oh Shannon  
I might be dreaming  
I might be wasting my life away  
Listening to you  
Down on under the streetlight  
You shudder and beat  
The edge of the waterway  
And I know if I had time  
I might dive in your water  
Lie right down in the evening rain  
I just want this pain pain to go away  
Come again some other day  
When I got time for bleeding  
Have you ever seen my face  
Fast asleep and dreaming  
And it dont seem right that I dont get no sleep at night  
Whats the river gonna know about leaving  
Oh Shannon  
I might be dreaming
