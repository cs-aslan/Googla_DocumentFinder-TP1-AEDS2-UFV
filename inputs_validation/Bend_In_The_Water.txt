Come on Pearl come on Kitty  
If you feel inclined  
Down around the bend in the water  
Bring your fishin line  
Come on Pearl Im rough and ready  
Got my fishin pole  
Down around the bend in the water  
To the fishin hole  
  
Its a fine July on a beautiful night  
With a heavenly sky and moonlight on the bay  
  
Down around the bend in the water  
If you feel inclined  
Come on Pearl come on Kitty  
Im gonna make you mine  
  
All around the world tonight  
What a beautiful scene below  
Too fine a time to stand in line  
Im gonna take my love to go  
Its a fine July and a beautiful way  
For a boy and a girl to pass the time of day  
  
Come on Pearl come on Kitty  
If you feel inclined  
Down around the bend in the water  
Bring your fishin line  
  
All around the world tonight  
What a beautiful sight below  
Too fine a time to stand in line  
Im gonna take my love to go  
Its a fine July on a beautiful light  
With a heavenly sky and moonlight on the bay  
  
Down around the bend in the water  
If you feel inclined  
Come on Pearl come on Kitty  
Bring your fishin line  
Come on Pearl Im rough and ready  
Got my fishin pole  
Down around the bend in the water  
To the fishin hole
