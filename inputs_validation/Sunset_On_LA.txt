Blow east wind blow  
Blow as you may  
Wish I had the power  
To take your breath away  
This life is golden  
But its only deep as the skin  
Feelin much colder  
Though Im standin in the warm desert wind  
Gotta leave this town  
Else Ill go crazy if I stay  
If I see one more sunset on la  
Ill miss you blue sky  
But not so much  
Too much of a good thing  
Keeps this old soul out of touch  
Sometimes youre empty  
Though your dreams they all seem fulfilled  
Youre cool on the outside  
Though the real you is slowly being killed  
Gotta leave this town  
Else Ill go crazy if I stay  
If I see one more sunset on la  
Left a girl lyin neath an old willow tree  
At times I think shell still be waitin there for me  
Gotta leave this town  
But its always one day away  
Just saw one more sunset on la  
Gotta leave this town  
Else Ill go crazy if I stay  
If I see one more sunset on la  
One more sunset on la  
Dont want to see  
One more sunset on la  
Baby wait for me
