Father Lucifer  
You never looked so sane  
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain  
Tell me that youre still in love with that milkmaid  
Hows the Lizzies  
Hows your Jesus Christ been hanging  
  
Nothing gonna stop me from floating  
Nothing gonna stop me from floating  
  
He says he reckons Im a watercolour stain  
He says I run and then I run from him  
And then I run  
He didnt see me watching  
From the aeroplane  
He wiped a tear  
And then he threw away our appleseed  
  
Nothing gonna stop me from floating  
  
Everydays my wedding day  
Though babys still in his comatose state  
Ill die my own Easter eggs  
Dont go yet  
And Beenie lost the sunset but thats but thats OK  
Does Joe bring flowers to Marilyns grave  
And girls that eat pizza but never gain weight  
Father Lucifer you never looked so sane
