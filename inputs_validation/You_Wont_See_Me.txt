Why cant we see eye to eye  
I feel you dont want to try  
Cause you wont see me as I am  
If you cant accept in me  
The good with the bad  
Then you wont see me cry again  
You wont see me  
  
Whyd you want to go and walk away  
I have got some things to say  
But you wont see me as I am  
If you cant accept in me  
The good with the bad  
Then you wont see me try again  
You wont see me  
Ill be movin on Ill be long gone  
  
You are in my range  
I am in your sight  
You say things dont change  
I say they just might  
  
You just might find that you can trust in me  
If you look at more than just what you want to see  
But you wont see me as I am  
If you cant accept in me  
The good with the bad  
Then you wont see me around here again  
You wont see me  
Ill be movin on Ill be long gone
