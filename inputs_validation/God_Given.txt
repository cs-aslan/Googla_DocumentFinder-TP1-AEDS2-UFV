Hey man please dont make a sound  
Take a look around  
Cant you see whats right in front of you  
Have a little taste  
No more time to waste  
You dont wanna get left behind cause its all coming down right now  
  
How hard is it to see  
Put your faith in me  
Cause you wouldnt want to be  
Praying to the wrong piece of wood  
You should get where you belong  
Everything you know is wrong  
Come on sing along everybody now  
  
God given  
  
Chorus  
And He gives us sight  
And we see the light  
And it burns so bright  
Now we know were right  
It is kingdom come  
And Thy will be done  
We have just begun  
Were the chosen ones  
  
I would never tell you anything that wasnt absolutely true that hadnt come
right from  
His mouth that He wants me to tell you  
  
Wait  
Step into the light  
How can this be right  
Im afraid were going to ask you to leave  
Guess you cannot win  
With the color of your skin  
You wont be getting in to the Promised Land  
This is just another case  
You people still dont know your place  
Step aside out the way wipe that look off your face  
Cause we are the divine  
Separated from the swine  
Come on sing along everybody now  
  
God given  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
I would never tell you anything that wasnt absolutely true that hadnt come
right from  
His mouth that He wants me to tell you  
  
God given
