I try so hard I dont know what to do  
Im gonna lose my mind if I cant have you  
The brake lights are on and nobodys home  
I can hear you talking on the telephone  
And my baby has the blues again  
Somehow they just seem to hit him  
And Im breaking up again with another long term boyfriend  
  
I believe that youre leaving  
And I believe youre already gone  
Youre already gone  
  
If you cant find love youve gotta find a method  
Of learning to live in the world today  
I dont know what it was that I expected  
I guess Im a fool to want perfection  
And Im breaking up again with another long term boyfriend  
  
I believe that youre leaving  
And I believe youre already gone  
I better believe what Im seeing  
Cause I believe that its so long  
Its so long as in see ya  
  
I try so hard I dont know what to do  
Its obvious I wont end up with you  
The brake lights are on and its so clear  
You cant pretend you want to be here  
This train of thought has arrived at the station  
We dont need anymore contemplation  
And Im breaking up again with another long term boyfriend
