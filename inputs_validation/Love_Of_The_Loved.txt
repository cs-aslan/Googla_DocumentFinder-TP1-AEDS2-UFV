Each time I look into your eyes  
I see that there a heaven lies  
And as I look  
I see the love of the loved  
  
Someday theyll see that from the start  
My place has been deep in your heart  
And in your heart  
I see the love of the loved  
  
Though I said it all before  
I will say it more and more  
Now that Im really sure  
You love me  
  
And I know that from today  
Ill see it in the way  
That you look at me  
And say ah you love me  
  
So let it rain Ill never care  
Deep in your heart Id still be there  
And when Im there  
I see the love of the loved  
  
Though I said it all before  
I will say it more and more  
Now that Im really sure  
You love me  
  
And I know that from today  
Ill see it in the way  
That you look at me  
And say ah you love me  
  
So let it rain Ill never I care  
Deep in your heart Id still be there  
And when Im there  
  
I see the love of the loved  
I see the love of the loved  
I see the love of the loved
