Before you go away  
To the one you do belong  
So glad we met and you stayed  
Though it wasnt very long  
Was it only just a dream  
Its over now it seems  
If there were no goodbyes  
Would you stay that you still care  
I wont believe my eyes  
When I see you wont be there  
Cause this love so hard to find  
Now youre leavin me behind  
Oh please  
  
Chorus  
Show me and tell me  
How do you put this love aside  
And Put it away for another time  
With no guarantee that youll be mine  
A fool I am it seems  
Cause Ill been lovin you in my dreams  
Until I wake up and I find out  
That time aint our friend  
Ill just stay a fool till the end  
  
Till the end Ill be a fool  
Till I find its me and you  
If it only was game  
Whyd you have to fool my heart  
Oh girl aint it a shame  
That we promised from the start  
That our love was here to stay  
For each and everyday  
If I had only known  
And if I didnt have to care  
Then being all alone  
It woulnt be so hard to bear  
This love so hard to find  
That were leavin here behind  
Oh please  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I maybe over acting  
I know I must stay strong  
But you pulled the string too hard  
And now were going on our own  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Till the end  
You know I just stay a fool
