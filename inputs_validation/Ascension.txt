Brothers and sisters  
Everythings gonna be alright  
We gonna be together in the moonlight  
No more pain or strife or sorrow  
Its a brand new day  
You dont need no money  
Cause everythings free  
  
Come with me baby  
Cause its been such a long long time  
Its time for ascension  
To be free to be wild  
  
Hey look at that smile  
On that pretty girls face  
She got no positions  
But shes poised and has grace  
Its an inner beauty thing baby  
That shines and shines  
It aint about your appearance  
But the soul look inside  
  
So come with me baby  
Cause its been such a long long time  
Its time for ascension  
To be free to be wild  
  
Rise up rise up  
Get up get up  
Come on come on  
  
Come with me baby  
Cause its been such a long long time  
Its time for ascension  
To be free to be wild  
Come with me baby  
Cause its been such a long long time  
Its time for ascension  
To be free to be wild  
To be wild to be wild  
To be free to be wide  
Free
