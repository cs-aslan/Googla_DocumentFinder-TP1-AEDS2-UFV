This kind of love aint right  
Wont take us through the night  
This kind of loves not true  
Not good for me or you  
  
Woke up to find myself  
Standing in another day  
Filled with anxiety  
Im praying for a different way  
I give it all I have  
Till I have no more to give  
I used to think Id die for love  
Now Id rather live  
If everywhere you look you find some misery  
The view from there can make you feel  
Just a little crazy  
  
This kind of love aint right  
Wont take us through the night  
Some think love equals pain but  
This kind of loves not true  
Not good for me or you  
I think we got to get out of this rain  
  
Stay walking through life  
Waiting for the other shoe to fall  
Dreams cut like a knife  
When you think you shouldnt dream at all  
I saw a dark cloud  
Looks like it follows us around  
It doesnt take that much you know  
To make it tumble down  
How did we ever go from being so happy  
To suffer alone and be strong  
Just so we can keep on giving up  
  
This kind of love aint right  
Wont take us through the night  
Some think love equals pain but  
This kind of loves not true  
Not good for me or you  
I think we got to get out of this rain  
  
If everywhere you look you find some misery  
The view from there can make you feel  
Just a little crazy  
  
This kind of love aint right  
Wont take us through the night  
Some think love equals pain but  
This kind of loves not true  
Not good for me or you  
I think we got to get out of this rain
