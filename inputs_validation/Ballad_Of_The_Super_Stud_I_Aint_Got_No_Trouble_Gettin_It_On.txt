Hey a woman made my habit  
Lord I need to have  
Feel just like a lion  
A womans like a little calf  
And everything I got  
Is everything that I want  
And I aint got no trouble gettin it on babe  
Hey I aint got not trouble gettin it on  
  
A flowers made for pickin  
One that fits me is better off  
Than the one that fades away  
And everything I got  
Is everything that I want  
And I aint got no trouble gettin it on babe  
Hey I aint got no trouble gettin it on  
  
Mary Jean from New Orleans  
She said she married mainly for love  
But before she could say  
She wasnt that kind of girl  
Uh she was  
  
Girl you better look out  
Cause love is a little like Chinese food  
Youre hungry after half an hour  
And everything I got  
Is everything I want  
I aint got no trouble gettin it on baby  
Hey I aint got no trouble gettin it on  
Cmon hey hey hey hey
