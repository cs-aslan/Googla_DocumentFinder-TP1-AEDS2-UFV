Slowly bleeding watch the vortex feeding  
Like a swirling vulture on your face  
Every hour the unseen rays devour  
Your screaming eyes cry out but they are blind  
  
Father forgive me my sins  
Give me the nails Ill hammer them in  
  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Say farewell we may never meet again  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Get on the lefthand highway with no sinister regrets  
  
Brave new world of secret fantasy  
That hovers just beyond your bloody grasp  
Close enough to thrill the danger of the kill  
Price for failure of your will  
  
Father forgive us our sins  
Cause were all the junkies who never can win  
  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Say farewell we may never meet again  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Down the lefthand highway with no sinister regrets  
  
Father forgive me my sins  
Give me the nails Ill hammer them in  
  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Parody of hope is the one that I must kill  
We all have to live with our family inventions  
Down the lefthand highway with no sinister regrets  
  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Say farewell we may never meet again  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Down the lefthand highway with no sinister regrets
