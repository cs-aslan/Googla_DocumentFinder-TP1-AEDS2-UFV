Verse 1  
Yes I do I believe  
That one day I will be where I was  
Right there right next to you  
And its hard the days just seem so dark  
The moon the stars are nothing without you  
Your touch your skin where do I begin  
No words can explain the way Im missing you  
Deny this emptiness this hole that Im inside  
These tears they tell their own story  
  
PreChorus  
Told me not to cry when you were gone  
But the feelings overwhelming its much too strong  
  
Chorus  
Can I lay by your side next to you you  
And make sure youre alright  
Ill take care of you  
I dont want to be here if I cant be with you tonight  
  
Verse 2  
Im reaching out to you  
Can you hear my call  
This hurt that Ive been through  
Im missing you missing you like crazy  
  
PreChorus  
Told me not to cry when you were gone  
But the feelings overwhelming its much too strong  
  
Chorus  
Can I lay by your side next to you you  
And make sure youre alright  
Ill take care of you  
I dont want to be here if I cant be with you tonight  
  
Outro  
Lay me down tonight lay me by your side  
Lay me down tonight lay me by your side  
Can I lay by your side next to you youou
