When she dont need me  
It makes me crazy  
She say rest easy  
And it makes me lazy  
But when she please me  
She please me all night long  
  
My friends are leavin  
She say dont worry  
Theyre only leavin  
There is no parting  
You will be lonely  
I will be here with you  
  
On the winds of darkness  
The light is soring  
And chains are bonded  
Freedom is singing  
Cling to the darkness  
Until youve turned to song  
  
The blues shall wash me  
And sun shall dry me  
The world will hide me  
But she will find me  
And when she find me  
She will take me home  
  
When she dont need me  
It makes me crazy  
She say rest easy  
And it makes me lazy  
But when she please me  
She please me all night long
