Hey hey good morning girl  
Hey hey good morning girl  
Hey hey good morning girl  
But I cant pass this time of day  
Cause Im on my way to rest my head  
And Ive lost the mind that I used to have  
And I dont have a dime to spare  
Hey hey good morning girl  
Hey hey good morning girl  
Hey hey good morning girl  
But I cant pass this time of day  
So go tell the man that collects the dues  
That you saw a guy without any shoes  
Who would do the job if he was built that way  
Hey hey good morning girl  
Hey hey good morning girl  
Hey hey good morning girl  
But I cant pass this time of day no  
I cant pass this time of day  
Cause Im on my way to rest my head  
And Ive lost the mind that I used to have  
I dont have a dime to spare  
Hey hey good morning girl  
Hey hey good morning girl  
Hey hey good morning girl  
But I cant pass this time of day  
So go tell the man that collects the dues  
That you saw a guy without any shoes  
Who would do the job if he was built that way  
Hey hey good morning girl  
Hey hey good morning girl  
Hey hey good morning girl  
But I cant pass this time of day no  
I cant pass this time of day  
No I cant pass this time of day
