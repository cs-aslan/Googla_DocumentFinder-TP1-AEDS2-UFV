One two one two  
Ultramagnetics in full effect  
We talkin about givin the drummer some  
You know what cool Keith yo tell em whats on your mind  
  
Cool Keith  
Im ready  
And now its my turn to build  
Uplift get swift then drift  
Off and do my own thing  
Switch up  
Change my pitch up  
Smack my bitch up like a pimp  
For any rapper who attempt to wear Troops  
And step on my path  
Im willing as a A1 General  
Rhyme Enforcer 235 on a rhyme test  
Whatever group or vest in line  
I put em all behind  
Play MC Ultra as a warning sign of my  
Skill and what my mind deserves  
I smell a grape in the duck preserves  
And who deserves the right to be king of the screen  
And shout wack poetry  
What are you buggin  
Germs that want to law me  
Quit it before I heat your ear off  
Let your burn deduct another year off rappin  
For a face Im slappin  
Gimme applause when hands start clappin  
Now give the drummer some  
  
CEDGEE  
Well Im Ced  
The Rhyming Force Delta  
When I enter you best take shelter  
cause Im dope and yes I will melt a  
Anyone who tried to even felt a  
Emotion or thought that they could hang with me  
I cut you up because you are my enemy  
On my stage interfering with my radius  
So step back cause Ima start to spray with this  
Can of Raid Spray  
If youre a germ filthy like AIDS Ill  
Clean you up with heat  
Vapors scrubbin and scrubbing  
Like a mistake on paper Im rubbin  
Erasin you out like some ink  
Cause you dirty your rhymes are stink  
Like garbage I hafta put you in a Hefty  
Or instead should I just let thee  
Weak MCs accu
