Jesse called her best friend Jenny  
Said were goin out tonight  
Gonna chase the moon  
Right out of the sky  
Were gonna drink Boones Farm  
Like we were seventeen again  
You cant say no  
As long as weve been friends  
  
Good girls  
Always walk the line  
Good Girls  
Never let you seem them cry  
  
Took off like a bottle rocket  
Through a field of corn  
And hell hath no fury  
Like a woman scorned  
Then Jesse lit a cigarette and said  
My mans been sleepin around  
And I know who it is  
And Jennys head fell down  
  
Good girls  
Always walk the line  
Good girls  
Never let you see them cry  
  
Next mornin the paper read  
Two killed in a fatal crash  
The train never had time to stop  
They were parked right on the tracks  
The only witness was  
A weeping willow on a faraway hill when  
Jesse told Jenny  
Hey if I cant have him neither one of us will  
  
Good Girls  
Always walk the line  
Good Girls  
Never let you see them cry  
  
Cry cry cry cry  
  
Jesse called her best friend Jenny  
Said were goin out tonight  
Gonna chase the moon  
Right out of the sky
