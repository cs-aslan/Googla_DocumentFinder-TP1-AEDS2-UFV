You cant believe things you see and read  
The Soviet threat  
Our pseudo enemy  
Whats scaring me  
Our foreign policy  
To make the world safe for business  
Call it democracy  
  
Our human nature its all the same  
We spend our lives in the pursuit of happiness  
So stop the hate open the iron gate  
Its our destiny to make the cold war history  
  
You think I give a shit  
If youre a socialist  
If youre a capitalist  
Weve all got to exist  
On this planet with nowhere to run  
The millions of brainwashed must open their eyes  
We are one  
  
With us over here and them over there  
Barbed wire borders are going nowhere
