Afraid to tell you how much I care  
Afraid Ill need you  
And you wont be there  
Id love to take you into my heart  
But something tells me  
We would only part  
I loved and lost  
Just one love ago  
I paid the cost and it hurt me so  
A heart gets careless  
When vows are made  
I want to love you but Im so afraid  
  
I loved and lost  
Just one love ago  
I paid the cost and it hurt me so  
A heart gets careless  
When vows are made  
I want to love you but Im so afraid
