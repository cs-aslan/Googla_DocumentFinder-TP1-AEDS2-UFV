The food is cold  
Your eyes are cold  
The windows cold  
The beds cold  
  
Give me something thats not cold come on come on  
Give me something thats not cold come on come on  
Give me something thats not cold come on come on  
Give me give me give me  
  
The chairs hard  
Your voice is hard  
The moneys hard  
The livings hard  
  
Give me something thats not hard come on come on  
Give me something thats not hard come on come on  
Give me something thats not hard come on come on  
Give me give me give me  
  
Ill give you my heartbeat  
And a bit of tear and flesh  
Its not very much but while its there  
You can have it you can have it
