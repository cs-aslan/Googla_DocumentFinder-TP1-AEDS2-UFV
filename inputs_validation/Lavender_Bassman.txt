Listen to my bassman he is lavender  
His woman is his bass and he is loving her loving her  
Listen to the sounds hes giving  
As he is living  
True to lavender  
  
Listen to the things my friend is saying now  
A poetry of notes as he is playing now playing now  
Listen to the tales hes telling  
Magic bass compelling  
Lavender  
  
Listen to my bass man he is lavender  
His fingerboards a highway hes a traveler traveler  
Listen to his fingers making music  
Hear his soul embarking  
Lavender  
  
Listen to my bass man he is lavender
