In the morning when I saw the light  
On the letter you left in the night  
After you had gone without saying goodbye  
Here to tell you that Im not afraid to cry  
  
Oh no oh no  
Tried to find you but I lost my way  
Tried to tell you what I couldnt say  
After you had gone without telling me why  
  
Im just here to tell you  
That Im not afraid to cry oh no  
And Im not afraid to cry oh no  
  
Chorus  
Not afraid to cry  
And Im not afraid to say  
Doesnt seem the same  
When youre not around  
  
Now Im here to tell you  
That Im going out today  
Gonna pickamyself back up  
Get my feet on the ground  
  
Chorus  
  
Im not afraidrepeat
