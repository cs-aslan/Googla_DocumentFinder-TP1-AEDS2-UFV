Up in the morning  
Up in the evening  
Picking down talks when the birds get back to me  
Oh to me  
  
Up on the mountain  
Down in the kings lair  
Pushing these boxes in the heat of the afternoon  
Oh afternoon  
  
We were never welcome here  
We were never welcome here at all  
No  
  
Its who we are  
Doesnt matter if weve gone too far  
Doesnt matter if its all okay  
Doesnt matter if its not our day  
  
Save us  
What we are  
Dont look clear  
Its all uphill from here  
Ooh  
  
Up in the attic  
Down in the cellar  
Lost in a static  
Coming back for more  
Oh for more  
  
Out with the reason  
In with the season  
Taking down names in my book of jealousy  
Jealousy  
  
We were never welcome here  
We were never welcome here at all  
No  
  
Its who we are  
Doesnt matter if weve gone too far  
Doesnt matter if its all okay  
Doesnt matter if its not our day  
Because its who we are  
Doesnt matter if weve gone too far  
Doesnt matter if its all okay  
Doesnt matter if its not our day  
  
Save us  
What we are  
Dont look clear  
Its all uphill from here  
Ooh  
  
They say were crazy  
They say were crazy  
They say were crazy  
They say were crazy  
They say were crazy  
They say were crazy  
They say were crazy  
They say were crazy  
  
Its who we are  
Doesnt matter if weve gone too far  
Doesnt matter if its all okay  
Doesnt matter if its not our day  
Because its who we are  
Doesnt matter if weve gone too far  
Doesnt matter if its all okay  
Doesnt matter if its not our day  
  
Why wont you save us  
What we are  
Dont look clear  
Its all uphill from here  
Ooh
