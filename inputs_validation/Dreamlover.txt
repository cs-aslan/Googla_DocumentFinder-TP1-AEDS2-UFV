I need a lover to give me  
The kind of love  
That would last always  
I need somebody uplifting  
To take me away  
  
I want a lover who knows me  
Who understands how I feel inside  
Someone to comfort and hold me  
Through the long lonely nights  
Till the dawn  
Why dont you take me away  
  
Chorus  
Dreamlover come rescue me  
Take me up take me down  
Take me anywhere you want to baby now  
I need you so desperately  
Wont you please come around  
Cause I want to share forever with you baby  
  
I dont want another pretender  
To disillusion me one more time  
Whispering words of forever  
Playing with my mind  
  
I need someone to hold on to  
The kind of love that wont fly away  
I just want someone to belong to  
Everyday  
Of my life  
Always  
So come and take me away  
  
Chorus x2
