We search for an answer  
And when it appears  
We can challenge the world with our sweat and our tears  
Through winning and losing  
The brave never bend  
The hero keeps fighting standing tall in the end  
  
Time can change anything And mend any fall  
The moment of truth is facing us all  
Its time for the hero to stand tall  
  
Its a time for heroes  
Time to answer the call  
Its a time for the hero in us all  
  
We carry the flame  
For all to see  
The fire and the passion of what we can be  
Sometimes we must fight  
But we never bend  
The hero keeps fighting standing tall in the end  
  
Love can change anything Its inside of us all  
To reach out a hand whenever we fall  
Its time for the hero to stand tall  
  
Its a time for heroes  
Time to answer the call  
Its a time for the hero to stand tall  
Its a time for heroes  
When our backs to the wall  
Its a time for the hero In us all
