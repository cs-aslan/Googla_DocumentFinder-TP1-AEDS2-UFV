Please dont ask me what went wrong  
I never planned it to come out like this  
Silent moments thoughtless words  
I never wanted these memories  
  
Joanna  
I love you so  
  
Dont wait for me Joanna  
I never meant to hurt you so  
But now i have to let you go  
Dont wait for me Joanna  
Ill always say a prayer for you  
And hope some day that you  
Will found true love  
  
When as children we used to play  
We sat and wondered where wed be today  
I said wed never be apart  
But now we lie among the broken hearts  
  
Joanna  
I love you so  
  
Dont wait for me Joanna  
I never meant to hurt you so  
But now i have to let you go  
Dont wait for me Joanna  
Ill always say a prayer for you  
And hope some day that you  
Will found true love  
  
Dont wait no no  
Joanna  
I cant let go no  
  
Dont walk away Joanna  
I never meant to hurt you so  
But now i know i cant let you go  
Dont walk away Joanna  
Ill always say a prayer for you  
And i hope that you will find  
In me true love
