I know its dumb to say  
That you are on my mind  
I know its stupid to dream  
That you might think of me as a man  
I can loose my own tie knot  
I can button up my own pants  
I can buy my own cigarettes  
I can pluck my own moustache  
I read its lame to wish  
That you wont walk out on me  
Im not embarrassed to sing  
Plainly the words love and your name  
I can pay all my own bills  
I can unroll my own tights  
I can untuck all I have to untuck  
I can weep through my own midnights  
I can loose my own tie knot  
I can button up my own pants  
I can buy my own cigarettes  
I can pluck my own moustache  
I can pay all my own debts  
I can rip off my own tights  
I can humiliate myself to your face  
I can weep through my own midnights
