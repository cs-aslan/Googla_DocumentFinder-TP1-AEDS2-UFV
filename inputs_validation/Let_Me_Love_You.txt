Sometimes I close my eyes  
And imagine youre with me  
Chasing passion into the night  
All tangled in a dream  
  
Oh if you could see my heart  
The way I feel inside  
You would know just how far  
Im willing to go to get to you  
There is nothing I wont do  
  
Show me what its like to lose control  
Free the desire in your soul  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Let me take you to a place like no where else  
Show you the things you never felt  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Oh I want to taste your kiss  
Be the reason for your smile  
Touch the magic on your skin  
Be the one that drives you wild  
  
Oh if you could read my mind  
Youd know youre everything I need  
Youd see yourself through my eyes  
You may understand what Im going through  
Just how much I want you  
  
Show me what its like to lose control  
Free the desire in your soul  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Let me take you to a place like no where else  
Show you the things you never felt  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Let me love you  
Let me love you  
  
Show you what its like to lose control  
Free the desire in your soul  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Let me take you to a place like no where else  
Show you the things you never felt  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Oh I love you  
  
Show you what its like to lose control  
Free the desire in your soul  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Yeah baby  
  
Let me take you to a place like no where else  
Show you the things you never felt  
Oh oh let me love you  
  
Let me love you  
Let me love you  
Let me love you  
Let me love you
