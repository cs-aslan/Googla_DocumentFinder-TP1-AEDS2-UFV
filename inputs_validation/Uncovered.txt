Small creature are you  
Small creature you are  
How quickly you are uncovered  
Naked and cold  
Mumbling and crying  
Knowing everythings been discovered  
  
Many secrets have you  
Many secrets you have  
But its only a matter of time  
Did you finally decide  
Theres nowhere to hide  
And really no reason why  
  
Hey Mr Shame  
Have you got a name  
I dont feel like calling you Buddy  
I dont want to hear your story  
I dont want to hear why  
And I dont even care if youre sorry  
  
Many secrets have you  
Many secrets you have  
But its only a matter of time  
Did you finally decide  
Theres nowhere to hide  
And really no reason why  
  
Strong is your body  
Strong are your bones  
Strong as your bloody lie is uncovered  
  
Small creature are you  
Small creature you are  
How quickly you are uncovered  
Naked and cold  
Mumbling and crying  
Knowing everythings been discovered
