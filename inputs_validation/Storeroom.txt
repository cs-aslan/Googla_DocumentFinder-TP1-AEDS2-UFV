I love you without caring whom you love  
My hands below the belt or my hands above  
In the arms of other men  
Or in my bed again  
Its just a man  
Taking what he needs  
From the store room  
Store room store room  
I love to see you sitting there upon your throne  
Your preachers all around you  
Being bored and your prophet straight and tall  
And yet theyll undermine it all  
Just a man just a man  
Taking what he needs  
From the store room  
Store room store room  
Yeah Shakespeare said it all then he said no more  
And he left me feeling just like a two bit whore  
Well the silence broke my heart but yes  
I spread my legs apart  
Its just a man  
  
  
The hermit in the Wild  
The parent in the child  
Just a man  
Oh my love let us unpin you  
 You done bringing more  
The mother and the father the daughter and the son  
But should one refuse to come it does not subtract the sum  
Its just a man  
Its not a due of burning pounds that ruins your mind  
Like a spoon that you turn and you turn and you dont unwind  
Though these wars that you did not stop  
They dont tear your sleep apart  
Its just a man  
 That keeps you up  
What a moon coming like a headlight through the window  
Not the thumbnail of a screen   
No best way to dream   
Its just a man  
Now the woman by your side is she awake  
But theres nothing you want to give her  
And theres nothing that you really want to take  
You dont even try to prove that the noisy neighbors making love   
Its just a man  
I love you without caring whom you love
