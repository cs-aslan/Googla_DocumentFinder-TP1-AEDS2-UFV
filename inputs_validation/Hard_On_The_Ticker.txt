I gave up pimento cheese  
Dominos delivery  
Whiskey sours  
Apple pies  
Fingerlickin chicken fried  
Are gastronomic history  
I used to like them scary shows  
But I gave em up a while ago  
Dont do no dipdefyin  
Roller coaster ridin  
Nowadays I just take it slow  
Every since we started datin  
I been compensatin  
To keep from gettin up  
To hell any quicker  
Cause  
  
Chorus  
Shes hard on the ticker  
Hard on the ticker  
The girl is such a hazard that she ought to have a sticker  
Sayin hard on the ticker  
  
Now when she wiggles through my door  
My chin gets heavy hits the floor  
Silky hair garnet lips  
Swingin doublejointed hips  
My blood begins to roar  
And when she nibbles on me ear  
Its partly pleasure partly beer  
Little dab is all it takes  
To get my heart a palpatatin  
Feelin like the end is near  
I ought to get a policy  
A double indemnity  
Itd make my beneficiary  
A whole lot richer  
Cause  
  
Chorus  
  
Thats my girl  
Yeah shes hard on the ticker  
I ought to get a policy  
A double indemnity  
Itd make my beneficiary  
A whole lot richer  
  
Because shes hard on the ticker  
Hard on the ticker  
The girl is such a hazard that she ought to have a sticker  
Sayin hard on the ticker  
  
Oh shes hard on the ticker  
Hard on the ticker  
Shes hard on the ticker  
Hey shes hard on the ticker
