Lost in the middle of nowhere  
As cold as a stone in the sky  
Regretting the mistakes that I made  
When I was a young boy  
Looking for a guiding light  
Looking for a guiding light  
Looking for a guiding light  
Looking for a guiding light  
  
Lookin for an answer that I aint found yet  
A twinkle in a blinds man eye  
Lookin for the light at the end of the tunnel  
Looking for a reason why  
  
Youre my guiding light  
Youre my guiding light  
Wheres my guiding light  
Wheres my guiding light  
  
I know youre out there  
I know youre out there  
I know youre out there  
Guiding Light  
  
Somewhere in the darkest night  
  
I swear on the cover of the King James Bible  
Im never gonna let you go  
Youre my idol youre my survival  
I just want you to know  
  
Youre my guiding light  
Youre my guiding light  
Youre my guiding light  
Youre my guiding light  
  
I been searchin  
I been searchin  
I been searchin  
One day I will find my guiding light  
  
And well shoot for the moon together  
Well shoot for the moon together babe  
Well shoot for the moon together babe  
Well shoot for the moon together babe
