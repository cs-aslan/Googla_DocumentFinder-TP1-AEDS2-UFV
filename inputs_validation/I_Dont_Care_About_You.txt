Yeah  
  
Im from South Philadelphia up on Avenue C  
Ive seen empty hands that was waitin to freeze  
Up from the power at home  
  
I dont care about you  
Fuck you  
I dont care about you  
Fuck you  
  
Ive seen Hollywood Boulevard  
Welfare hotel  
And I spent the night in jail  
At the Wilcox Hotel  
  
I dont care about you  
Fuck you  
I dont care about you  
  
Ive seen an old man have a heart attack in Manhattan  
Well he died while we just stood there lookin at him  
Aint he cute  
  
I dont care about you  
Fuck you  
I dont care about you  
  
I seen mad rollin drunks  
I seen bodies in the streets  
I saw a man who was sleepin in his own puke  
And a man with no legs crawlin down  
Fifth Street tryin just to get somethin to eat  
  
I dont care about you  
Fuck you  
I dont care about you  
Fuck you  
I dont care about you  
Fuck you  
I dont care about you  
  
Fuck you
