Im going back just a few years  
All people used to seem tall  
When everyday would be voices calling  
Id take no notice at all  
Id take no notice at all  
Then when I asked if youd  
Held conversation  
I was the talk of the town  
Until the voice let me see in the future  
They didnt look so way down  
  
I have to make them listen  
Or they may never come back  
I have to make them listen now  
  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
  
And so I heard and I saw  
Something happening  
They were just like you and me  
But they were wiser and all had the message  
We really had to believe  
We really had to believe  
  
They showed me how the world keeps on turning  
Its not as hard as it seems  
So many secrets you wouldnt believe in  
They manufacture our dreams  
  
I have to make you listen  
Or they may never come back  
I have to make you listen now  
  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
  
I was afraid of things that I cant see  
I cant see love but I like it a lot  
I used to take a life in the back seat  
Until the front row began to move off  
There must be more to sleep than waking  
I was so sure there was something waiting  
There
