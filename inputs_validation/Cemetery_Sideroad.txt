I had heart but I used to be older  
Im not like I used to be had you  
But I guess its all over you talk  
But youre not like me  
  
You talk and you talk like some weird saint  
What do you think that we could taint  
When youre nothing I am and Im something you aint  
  
Hold me until the night makes colder  
Tell me how lifes made you bad kick  
When I choke and I smolder  
When Im not what you had  
  
Im looking for a cemetery side road  
Im screaming like a lighthouse lamp  
Im chasing after what I think that Im owed  
Like a french foreign legion tramp  
  
You swim in an ocean thats storming  
You eat when the wolves all do  
You ache like a mother in mourning  
When youre left along with you
