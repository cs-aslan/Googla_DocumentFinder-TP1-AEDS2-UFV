Dont tell me hard luck stories  
And I wont tell you mine  
Dont tell me hard luck stories  
And I wont tell you mine  
  
Every time youre feelin fine  
Got another good one on the line  
It slips away  
You feel it slip away slip away  
  
I dont want no more from you  
Wont do what you want me to  
Turn me loose  
Come on turn me loose turn me loose  
  
Every time Im feelin good  
The phone rings and I knock on wood  
Hoping that it wont be you  
Calling like you always do  
  
All you ever seem to say is  
How much bad luck came your way  
You wont try to start again  
You just count on your old friends  
  
Dont tell me hard luck stories  
And I wont tell you mine  
Dont tell me hard luck stories  
And I wont tell you mine  
  
Now you call up every day  
Got no money no place to stay  
That girl made a mess of you  
You got what was comin too  
  
Build her up and let her down  
Tastin everythin in town  
Treat her right you never  
Treat her right treat her right  
  
Now shes gone and youre alone  
Bite your fingers to the bone  
Slip away  
You feel it slip away slip away  
  
You dont know whats goin on  
How you lost it what went wrong  
What ever happened to  
The love that you once knew  
  
Dont tell me hard luck stories  
And I wont tell you mine  
Dont tell me hard luck stories  
And I wont tell you mine
