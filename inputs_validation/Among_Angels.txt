Only you can do something about it  
Theres noone there my friend any better  
I might know what you mean when you say you fall apart  
Arent we all the same In and out of doubt  
I can see angels standing around you  
They shimmer like mirrors in Summer  
But you dont know it  
And they will carry you oer the walls  
  
If you need us just call  
Rest your weary world in their hands  
Lay your broken laugh at their feet  
I can see angels around you  
They shimmer like mirrors in Summer  
Theres someone whos loved you forever but you dont know it  
You might feel it and just not show it
