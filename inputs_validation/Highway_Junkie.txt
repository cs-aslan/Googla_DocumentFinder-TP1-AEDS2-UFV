  
A hundred cups of coffee five hundred cigarettes  
A thousand miles of highway and I aint forgot her yet  
But I keep on moving I keep moving down the line  
There aint nothing in my mirror just a cloud of dust and smoke  
But what do you expect when some old truckers heart gets broke  
Yeah truckers hearts gets broke  
  
But them big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind  
Im a highway junkie I need that old white line  
  
Ten miles out of nashville I was doing a hundred and one  
State boy me over and he said Wheres the fire son  
He said Wheres the fire son  
I said Man there aint no fire Im just running from a flame  
Go on and write your ticket but I aint the one to blame  
That county judge tried to rob me blind  
  
But them big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind  
Im a highway junkie I need that old white line  
  
So I rolled on down to Memphis  
I had nothing left to lose  
I wanted to hear some rock and roll but all they played was blues  
I didnt wanna hear no blues  
So I went to call up Elvis and Roger Miller grabbed the phone  
He said drive that 18 wheeler boy youre the king of the road  
Said I was the king of the road  
  
But them big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind  
Im a highway junkie I need that old white line  
  
But them big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind  
Im a highway junkie I need that old white line
