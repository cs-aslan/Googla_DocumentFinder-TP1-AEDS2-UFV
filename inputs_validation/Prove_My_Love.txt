Just last night  
I was reminded of  
Just how bad  
It had gotten and  
Just how sick  
I had become  
But it could change  
With this relationship  
Dede range  
Weve all been through some shit  
And if were a thing  
I think this things begun  
Tell me now  
What do I have to do  
To prove my love to you  
Special favors come in 31 flavors  
Were out of mints  
Pass the life savers  
Im droppin hints  
Candy for candycoated tongue  
Youd be so good  
So very good for me  
What do you think  
Tell me honestly  
Im wait wait wait  
Wait wait  
Waiting for you to come  
Tell me now  
What do I have to do  
To prove my love to you  
Id do anything  
Id do it all  
Id do it all for you  
Id climb a mountain  
Id cross the ocean  
Id do it it all  
To prove my love to you
