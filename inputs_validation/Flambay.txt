He used to be very kind in his own crude way  
He wasnt always like I wanted him to be  
He wasnt smart he wasnt handsome either  
But he thrilled me when he drilled me  
And I never loved a monster quite like he  
  
Because his love was so flambay  
His kisses burned me so his kisses turned me  
From a queen on a throne to a shriveling spool  
Here I stand all alone a spiders fool  
  
When its me he needs to fondle his tool  
I guess some bugs are just that way  
He dont really need your love  
He dont really need you  
To be there when his hair gets matted and grey  
With a broom cleaning his room from the mess he made that day  
All those earthling worms he nibbled away  
  
Oh hunchentoot my love how could you desert me now  
Oh hunchentoot you brute cant you see I want you  
Stay with me flagrantly  
And well have ecstasy for all eternity  
  
Because your love is so flambay  
You kisses burn me so your kisses turn me  
From a queen on a throne to a shriveling spool  
I dont mind if youre unkind cause spiders rule  
  
Yes you are real cool  
With those little webs you spool  
And all your spider drool  
Oh let me float in your pool
