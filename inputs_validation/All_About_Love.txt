Thinkers think about love till it comes out their ears  
Drinkers drink about love and they cry in their beers  
Now you can think about it drink about it  
But if youre on the brink about it  
Dont fall till you know all about love  
  
Singers croon about love sing with sadness and pain  
A tycoon about love spends a fortune in vain  
Sing a dirge about it splurge about it  
But if youre on the verge about it  
Dont fall till you know all about love  
  
You must examine your motives clearly  
Look at the facts sincerely  
Or you mess up very dearly if you dont  
  
Writers write about love till their fingers are sore  
Fighters fight about love till their flat on the floor  
You can write about it fight about it  
Think about it drink about it  
But theres one item I forgot to recall  
  
You cant know all about love unless you fall  
  
Ah thinkers think about love till it comes out their ears  
And drinkers drink about love and they cry in their beers  
But you can think about it drink about it  
But if youre on the brink about it  
Dont fall till you know all about love  
  
Writers write about love till their fingers are sore  
Fighters fight about love till their flat on the floor  
Now you can write about it fight about it  
Think about it drink about it  
But theres one item I forgot to recall  
  
You cant know all about love no no  
Cause I know all about love yeah yeah  
You cant know all about love unless you fall  
In love  
  
You must examine your motives clearly  
Look at the facts sincerely  
Or you mess up very dearly if you dont  
  
Doctors know about love that its bad on the nerves  
Drivers show about love that its hard on the curves  
Lose your nerve about it squirm about it  
Doubt about it pout about it  
But theres one item I forgot to recall  
  
You cant know all about love no no  
Cause I know all about love yeah yeah  
You cant know all about love no no  
Cause I know all about love yeah yeah  
  
You cant know all about love unless you fall  
In love
