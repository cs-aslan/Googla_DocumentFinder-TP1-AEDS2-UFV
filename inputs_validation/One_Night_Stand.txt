When Im on the road playin in a town without a name  
And Im feelin low an everybody looks the same  
Well you catch my eye and then you come on strong an try to make your play  
Just because we loved tonight please dont you think its gonna stay that
way  
  
Dont you know that youre nothin more than a one night stand  
Tomorrow Ill be on my way an you can catch me if you can  
Honey take me by the hand and play that game again yeah  
  
Everywhere I go the people want to make some time with me  
Thats okay if the next day I can be free  
Well its feelin good and youre the one Im lovin tonight  
Well dont you go and spoil it babe by trying to get yourself all uptight  
  
Dont you know that youre nothing more than a one night stand  
Ill be on my way an you can catch me if you can  
Honey take me by the hand and play that game again yeah
