I may not have a whole lot of money  
But I got enough girl for you and me  
Im takin off wont you come with me honey  
Gonna take you all the way to Paris Tennessee  
  
I want to show you the Riviera  
Got good tires and a good CB  
Put on some lipstick your mascara  
Cause were goin all the way to Paris Tennessee  
  
Baby I adore you  
And dont say Ive never done nothin for you  
Girl that just aint true  
  
Here we go  
  
Baby I adore you  
And dont say Ive never done nothin for you  
Girl that just aint true  
  
We might not see no Eiffel Tower  
But I got a cousin that I want you to meet  
He can pick the wildwood flower  
Bettern anybody down in Paris Tennessee  
  
Were goin all the way to Paris Tennessee  
Ooooh lala baby  
Vous le vous  
Barbecue
