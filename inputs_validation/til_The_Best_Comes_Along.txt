Now I aint the best lookin guy in the world  
And I aint got much money at all  
But when our eyes met Ill never forget  
And for you I could easily fall  
  
Chorus  
So why dont we just keep on dancin  
While the band sings an old country song  
Well I wont be depressed  
If I aint the best  
But will I do til the best comes along  
  
I aint got a mansion on some mountain top  
And I aint got no long limousine  
But Ive got a heart as warm as the sun  
And could love you like youve never seen  
  
Chorus  
  
No I wont be depressed  
If I aint the best  
But will I do til the best comes along
