When will I learn to take you on my journey  
When will I see that you belong to me  
When will I learn to take you on my journey  
When will I see that you belong with me  
  
Sweet Forgiveness  
How could go my babe  
I never really knew how I needed you but you were right there  
I dont know the rest  
  
Sweet forgiveness thats what you give to me  
When you hold me close  
And you say Thats all over  
You dont go looking back  
You dont hold the cards to stack  
Cause you mean what you say  
  
Sweet forgiveness you help me see  
Im not near as bad  
As I sometimes appear to be  
When you hold me close  
And you say Thats all over  
And I still love you  
  
Theres no way that I could make up  
For those angry words I said  
Sometimes it gets to hurting  
And the pain goes to my head  
  
Sweet forgiveness dear God above  
I say we all deserve  
A taste of this kind of love  
Someone wholl hold our hand  
And whisper I understand  
And I still love you
