Baby trust me  
i know youre shy  
But when youre with me  
i see the love in your eyes  
tell me why cant you see the way it feels  
and if our love is real  
say youll love me  
forever and ever  
  
Chorus  
Cause ill be back for more  
Lady ill be back for more  
Why cant you say  
That you feel the same way  
Lady ill be back for more  
  
You say youre afraid youll get burned again  
but baby i pray that someday  
youll let my love in  
i cant wait  
tell me how you really feel  
and say our love is real  
say youll love me forever and ever  
  
Chorus  
Ill be back for more  
Baby ill be back for more  
Why cant you say  
you feel the same way  
Baby ill be back for more  
  
Oh baby Just let me know Just let me know  
Girl if you love me  
youve got to let it show Just let it show  
Im down on my knees  
Im begging you please  
  
Ill be back for more  
Ill be back for more  
Why cant you say  
you feel the same way  
Lady ill be back for more  
  
And i will be back for more
