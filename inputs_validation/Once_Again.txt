Jesus christ I think upon your sacrifice  
You became nothing poured out to death  
Many times Ive wondered at your gift of life  
And Im in that place once again  
Im in that place once again  
  
And once again I look upon the cross where you died  
Im humbled by your mercy and Im broken inside  
Once again I thank you  
Once again I pour out my life  
  
Now you are exalted to the highest place  
King of the heavens where one day Ill bow  
But for now I marvel at your saving grace  
And Im full of praise once again  
Im full of praise once again  
  
Thank you for the cross  
Thank you for the cross  
Thank you for the cross my friend
