Whys my blood race  
Why I gnash my teeth  
Sand mans come here  
With his misery  
You wrought with pain  
As you slash my flesh  
Wraths revenge lives again  
  
Cane killed abel did his brothers deed  
Cursed all time  
Damned to spread his seed  
Pricks to blind  
  
Thorns in my side  
Oh slay they brothers life  
Ill kill your pain on the seeds of cane  
I aint no stranger giving love  
Dont ya plead  
Oh wont ya bleed for me  
Hells be raining from above  
  
Im coming home  
Vengence be they name  
Im coming home  
Revengeance scream my name  
  
Oh your Gods got you dying to be  
Oh your martys in the sand  
Ill hunt you down like the dogs that you be  
You Armageddons in my hands  
Come to me Ill set you free  
Come to me will you die for me
