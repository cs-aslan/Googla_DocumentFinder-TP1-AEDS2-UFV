Rainy night and we worked all day  
We both got jobs cause theres bills to pay  
We got something they cant take away  
Our love our lives  
  
Close the door leave the cold outside  
I dont need nothing when Im by your side  
We got something thatll never die  
Our dreams our pride  
  
My heart beats like a drum all night  
Flesh to flesh one to one and its alright  
And Ill never let go cause  
Theres something I know deep inside  
  
You were born to be my baby  
And baby I was made to be your man  
  
We got something to believe in  
Even if we dont know where we stand  
Only God would know the reasons  
But I bet he must have had a plan  
Cause you were born to be my baby  
And baby I was made to be your man  
  
Light a candle blow the world away  
Table for two on a TV tray  
It aint fancy baby thats OK  
Our time our way  
  
So hold me close better hang on tight  
Buckle up baby its a bumpy ride  
Were two kids hitching down the road of life  
Our world our fight  
  
If we stand side by side all night  
Theres a chance well get by and its alright  
And Ill know that youll be live  
In my heart till the day that I die  
  
Cause you were born to be my baby  
And baby I was made to be your man  
  
We got something to believe in  
Even if we dont know where we stand  
Only God would know the reasons  
But I bet he must have had a plan  
Cause you were born to be my baby  
And baby I was made to be your man  
  
My heart beats like a drum all night  
Flesh to flesh one to one and its alright  
And Ill never let go cause  
Theres something I know deep inside  
  
Cause you were born to be my baby  
And baby I was made to be your man  
  
We got something to believe in  
Even if we dont know where we stand  
Only God would know the reasons  
But I bet he must have had a plan  
  
Cause you were born to be my baby  
And baby I was made to be your man  
  
You were born to be my baby  
And baby I was made to be your man
