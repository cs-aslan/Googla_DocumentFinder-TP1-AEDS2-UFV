In the event  
that this fantastic voyage  
Should turn to erosion  
and we never get old  
Remember its true dignity is valuable  
But our lives are valuable too  
  
Were learning to live with somebodys depression  
And I dont want to live with somebodys depression  
Well get by I suppose  
Its a very modern world  
but nobodys perfect  
  
Its a moving world  
but thats no reason  
To shoot some of those missiles  
Think of us as fatherless scum  
It wont be forgotten  
Cause well never say anything nice again will we  
  
And the wrong words make you listen  
In this criminal world  
Remember its true loyalty is valuable  
But our lives are valuable too  
  
Were learning to live with somebodys depression  
And I dont want to live with somebodys depression  
Well get by I suppose  
But any sudden movement Ive got to write it down  
They wipe out an entire race and Ive got to write it down  
But Im still getting educated but Ive got to write it down  
And it wont be forgotten  
Cause Ill never say anything nice again how can I
