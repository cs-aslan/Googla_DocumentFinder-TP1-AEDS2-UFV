Youre the sky that I fell through  
And I remember the view  
Whenever Im holding you  
The sun hung from a string  
Looking down on the world as it warmed over everything  
Chills run down my spine  
As our fingers entwine  
And your sighs harmonize with mine  
Unmistakably I can still feel your heart beat fast when you dance with me  
  
We got older and I should have known  
Do you feel alive  
That I feel colder when I walk alone  
Oh but youll survive  
So I may as well ditch my dismay  
Bombs away bombs away  
  
Circle me and the needle moves gracefully  
Back and forth  
If my heart was a compass youd be north  
Risk it all cause Ill catch you if you fall  
Wherever you go  
If my heart was a house youd be home  
  
It makes me smile because you said it best  
I would clearly feel blessed if the sun rose up from the west  
Flower balm perfume  
All my clothes smell like you  
Cause your favorite shade is navy blue  
  
I walk slowly when Im on my own  
Do you feel alive  
Yeah but frankly I still feel alone  
Oh but youll survive  
So I may as well ditch my dismay  
Bombs away bombs away  
  
Circle me and the needle moves gracefully  
Back and forth  
If my heart was a compass youd be north  
Risk it all cause Ill catch you if you fall  
Wherever you go  
If my heart was a house youd be home  
  
If my heart was a house youd be home
