Would it be asking too much of you  
To let me stay tonight  
Until I find my way back home again  
Lifes been so simple lately  
I dont want to go away  
There is precious little left for me to say  
  
Ive go nowhere else to turn  
Will you help me tonight  
Theres noone to stand in our way  
I just want to feel needed  
Wont you give me a chance  
I know that you want me to stay  
  
And theres no need to be disguising all your feelings  
Cos I cant leave you alone  
Ive got nowhere else to turn  
  
Would it be taking a liberty  
In loving you tonight  
I just want to hold you close again  
I get so lonely sometimes  
Then I think of you  
There is precious little else that I can do  
  
Ive go nowhere else to turn  
Will you help me tonight  
Theres noone to stand in our way  
I just want to feel needed  
Wont you give me a chance  
I know that you want me to stay  
  
Ive go nowhere else to turn  
Will you help me tonight  
Theres noone to stand in our way  
I just want to feel needed  
Wont you give me a chance  
I know that you want me to stay  
  
And theres no need to be disguising all your feelings  
Cos I cant leave you alone  
Ive got nowhere else to turn  
  
Would it be taking a liberty  
In loving you tonight  
I just want to hold you close again  
I get so lonely sometimes
