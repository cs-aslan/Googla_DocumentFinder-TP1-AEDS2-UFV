Our day will come  
And well have everything  
Well share the joy  
Falling in love can bring yeah  
No one can tell me  
That Im too young to know  
That I love you so  
And you love me  
Oh our day will come  
If we just wait a while  
No more tears for us  
Just think love and wear a smile  
Our dreams have magic because  
Well always stay in love this way  
Cause our day day our day  
Our day is gonna come  
So how long baby  
Its gonna come  
Wait a minute baby  
Its gonna come
