I remember an evening so long  
How your innocence sang  
And the notes made me shiver inside  
Like your honesty can  
You asked me to please explain some things that seemed new  
What was it that felt like pain and cuts in two  
  
CHORUS  
Youre only in love only in love  
Where life is new and dreams come true  
Youre only in love only in love  
To rise and fall and wait as we learn from it all  
  
When conscience pulls you away and your destiny calls  
Just follow your heart all the way youll never need more  
More than the burning light when evening must die  
Youll never forget this night or wonder why  
  
CHORUS  
  
You thought that everything was just a lie  
Now after so much time dont let the secret pass you by
