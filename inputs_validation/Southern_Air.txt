Ive watched the world go by  
Outside a window  
I still cant believe where I am now  
Its been forever long  
Adventures come and gone  
And Im left alone but not let down  
  
Cause I have found a gravity  
A voice that pulls me to my knees  
Telling me Remember where youre from  
  
This southern air is all I need  
Breathe it in and I can see  
Canvasses behind my eyes  
All the colors of my life  
This southern air is in my lungs  
Its in every word Ive sung  
It seems the only truth I know  
This well always be home  
  
Ive thought about the day  
When I could truly say Im better now  
Well here I am  
Cause I have left this gravity  
Grab a hold and carry me  
And I will not forget where I am from  
Forget where I am from  
  
This southern air is all I need  
Breathe it in and I can see  
Canvasses behind my eyes  
All the colors of my life  
This southern air is in my lungs  
Its in every word Ive sung  
It seems the only truth I know  
This well always be home  
Always be home always be home  
  
The sun lays down inside the ocean  
Im right where I belong  
Feel the air the salt on my skin  
The futures coming on  
And after living through these wild years  
Im coming out alive  
I just wanna lay my head here  
And stop running for a while  
  
This southern air is all I need  
Breathe it in and I can see  
Canvasses behind my eyes  
All the colors of my life  
This southern air is in my lungs  
Its in every word Ive sung  
It seems the only truth I know  
This well always be home  
Always be home always be home  
This will always be home  
  
This southern air is in my lungs  
Its in every word Ive sung  
It seems the only truth I know  
Is well always be home  
Always be home always be home
