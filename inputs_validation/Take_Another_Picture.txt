Saw my father living in a picture  
Squinting in the Michigan sun  
Caught forever in his blouse and knickers  
Wasnt he the lucky one  
While the fear is growing stronger  
The sun is almost gone  
So hold me in your naked eye  
And shoot me on the run  
  
Oh wont you please please  
Take another picture  
Please please freeze my features  
Oh wont you please please  
Take another  
I dont want to fade away  
  
I saw a picture hidden in the bedroom  
Underneath fathers ties  
A beautiful woman caught naked forever  
Black strip over her eyes  
I still remember that picture  
The image sits sharp and clear  
And Ill never erase that eyeless face  
Still smiling all these years  
  
Oh wont you please please  
Take another picture  
Please please freeze my features  
Oh wont you please please  
Take another  
I dont want to fade away
