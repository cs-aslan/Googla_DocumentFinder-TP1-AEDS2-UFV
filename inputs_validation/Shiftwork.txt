Shift work hard work tired bar  
Bluecollar shirt and a baseball cap  
You knew me  
  
Hes hot sweat drops round the clock  
Door never locks  
Noise never stops  
Not all day  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Shift work tough work for the convenience store clerk  
Two feet that hurt going insane  
Shes mad at some lad  
Drove off and didnt pay for his gas and he wont be the last  
round the clock pain  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Talking about a bunch of shift work  
A big ol pile of shift work  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Well I work shift work  
Ten years man I hated that work  
I made a break with the money I made  
It took me to the beach to have a beer by the edge of the sea  
And this round a clock place  
I drank my money away  
We partied  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Talking about a bunch of shift work  
A big ol pile of shift work  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven
