I stood and saw the judges gavel fall  
And much to my dismay these words Ive heard him say  
Ive listened to your story boy and it seems to me  
Youd be better off if youll set her free  
But I love her I love her down on my knees I cry  
And I dont want to lose her heaven knows I try  
To make her happy but she wants more than me  
And Ill take her like she is before Ill set her free  
 steel   
Judge I know she loves me in her own kind of way  
Even though she hurts me a hundred times a day  
You tell me that its better that I should set her free  
But judge what would you do if you were me  
You see I love her I love her in spite of all shes done  
And Ill keep right on hoping someday that time will come  
When shell decide that she wants only me  
And Ill take her like she is before Ill set her free
