I wish I  I wish I was in Richmond  
I do I would I  
I wish I I wish I was back home  
Im waitin here in New York City  
The rain is falling  
Theres no one who cares  
Theres no one loves me here  
The women they may look very pretty  
And some they know it  
But some look good  
They show a leg and smile  
But they all look like the flowers  
In someone elses garden  
Ill not act on love  
For anyone but you
