Im out on the range surveying the land  
Thinking of the job thats to be done  
My life is hard but I dont mind  
Men like me thats how the west was won  
I stand the pain and the suffering  
For on the trail I am the king  
On doors I knock and on bells I ring  
Always sure that I will get the sale  
  
Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beatup Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
And on the dotted line I make them sign  
Hidehey Hidehey hidehey hidehey hey  
  
The door swings wide and I sense my prey  
Ready to fall victim to my pitch  
I tell him all about the plan  
With all of its inherent benefits  
If you lose an arm its a thousand bucks  
Lose both of them and get twice as much  
And if you should die well then bless your luck  
Youll just be raking in the cash  
  
Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beatup Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
And on the dotted line I make them sign  
Hidehey Hidehey hidehey hidehey hey  
  
The sucker signs the deed is done  
Its time for me to get back on the road  
A lonely man out on the land  
Where the wind can blow so cold  
I ride into the setting sun  
With the knowledge of a job well done  
But I cant rest until everyone  
Has become properly insured  
  
Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beatup Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
And on the dotted line I make them sign  
Hidehey Hidehey hidehey hidehey hey  
  
Yes I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beatup Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
For on the dotted line I make them sign
