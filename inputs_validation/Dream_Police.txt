The dream police  
They live inside of my head  
The dream police  
They come to me in my bed  
The dream police  
Theyre coming to arrest me  
Oh no  
  
You know that talk is cheap  
And rumors aint nice  
And when I fall asleep  
I dont think Ill survive  
  
The night the night  
  
Cause theyre waiting for me  
Looking for me  
Every single night  
Theyre driving me insane  
Those men inside my brain  
  
The dream police  
They live inside of my head  
The dream police  
They come to me in my bed  
  
The dream police  
Theyre coming to arrest me  
Oh no  
  
Well I cant tell lies  
Cause theyre listening to me  
And when I fall asleep  
Bet theyre spying on me tonight  
Tonight  
  
Cause theyre waiting for me  
Looking for me  
Every single night  
Theyre driving me insane  
Those men inside my brain  
  
I try to sleep  
Theyre wide awake  
They wont let me alone  
They dont get paid to take vacations  
Or let me alone  
They spy on me  
I try to hide  
They wont let me alone  
They persecute me  
Theyre the judge and jury all in one  
  
Cause theyre waiting for me  
Looking for me  
Every single night  
Theyre driving me insane  
Those men inside my brain  
  
The dream police  
They live inside of my head  
The dream police they come  
To me in my bed  
  
The dream police  
Theyre coming to arrest me  
  
The dream police police police  
The dream police police police
