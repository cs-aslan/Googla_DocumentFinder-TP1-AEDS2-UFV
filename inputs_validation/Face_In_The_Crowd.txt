Im just a face in the crowd  
You probably dont know me as I dont stand out  
And Im sure your heart doesnt beat for me no  
  
And when youre cold and lonely there are not my arms  
You long to feel around you to keep you safe and warm  
No Im just a face in the crowd you cant see  
  
Save a little love for me  
Save a little love for me yeah  
Save a little love for me yeah yeah  
And I will save my love for you  
My face in the crowd  
  
Dont know your name dont know mine  
Yet Im wearing all initials round this heart of mine  
I dont need no proof to know that you are there yeah  
  
Hey my heart is strong and my wings are wide  
Im true to all my colors and I wear them all with pride  
I am your face the face in the crowd  
  
So save a little love for me  
Save a little love for me yeah  
Save a little love for me yeah yeah  
Cause Ill save my love for you  
My face in the crowd  
  
In the twilight sometimes we meet  
Just before we wake or as we fall asleep  
I still cant see your face and I know you cant see mine  
But I can feel your heart beat you can hear my voice  
You touch my soul and my soul touches yours  
  
We make a promise somewhere down the line  
Somewhere down the line  
  
So save a little love for me  
Save a little love for me yeah  
Save a little love for me yeah yeah  
And Ill save my love for you  
All my love my love  
My face in the crowd  
  
Dont know the color of your skin but I felt the love that lies within  
Im sure I know without a doubt Ill find your face in the crowd  
Ill never let this feeling slide no world can put my faith aside  
Im sure I know without a doubt Ill find your face in the crowd
