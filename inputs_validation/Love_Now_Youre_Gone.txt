Love now that youre gone  
I just cant carry on  
Love left a space  
I cant erase that face  
Love that I knew gone like the morning dew  
What will I do without her  
  
Love where is she now  
I sit and think of how  
She used to be  
Happy to be with me  
Love that I knew gone like the morning dew  
What will I do without her  
  
Love left me for good  
I never thought she would  
Now Im alone  
Wondering where shes gone  
Love that I knew gone like the morning dew  
What will I do without her
