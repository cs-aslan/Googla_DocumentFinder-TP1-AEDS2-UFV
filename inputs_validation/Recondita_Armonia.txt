ToscaWhat strange and lovely harmony  
  
Recondita armonia di belleze diverse  
E bruna Floria lardente amante mia  
E te beltade ignota cinta di chiome bionde  
Tu azzuro hai locchio Tosca ha locchio nero  
Larte nel suo mistero le diverse belleze insiem confonde  
Ma nel ritrar costei il mio solo pensiero  
Ah Il mio solo pensier sei tu Tosca sei tu  
  
Synopses  
Cavaradossi is working on a portrait of the Madonna for the church of Saint
Andrea Though the painting closely resembles a beautiful parishioner there
Cavaradossi explains that it is a combination of that woman who he does not
know and his own darkhaired darkeyed lover Floria Tosca  
  
English translation  
What strange and lovely harmony of such different beauties  
How dark is Floria this ardent love of mine  
And you mysterious beauty long and blond flowing tresses  
How your eyes are skyblue Toscas eyes are blacknight  
Art too with its many mysteries blends all together  
Such different beauties But though I paint another  
My only thought is you oh my only thought is you  
Tosca is you is you
