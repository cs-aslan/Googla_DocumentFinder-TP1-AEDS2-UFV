I wanna live fast love hard die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
  
I wanna live fast love hard die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
Dont want slow walkin or sad singin  
Let em have a jubilee  
I wanna leave a lot of happy women  
Athinkin pretty thoughts of me  
I wanna live fast love hard die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
  
I got a hotrod car and a cowboy suit  
And I really do get around  
I got a little black book and the gals look cute  
And I know the name of evry spot in town  
I wanna find em fool em leave em  
An let em do the same to me  
I wanna live fast love hard die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
  
I wanna live fast love hard die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
Im a wampus cat let me grab my hat  
And baby come aiong with me  
Were gonna do some fancy steppin  
Were really goin on a spree  
I wanna live fast love hard die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
  
Now you may not approve of the things I do  
But it really dont bother me  
But dont ever think you can tie me down  
Im gonna stay footloose and fancy free  
So jump back make tracks move out  
An let the pretty gals at me  
I wanna live fast love hard die young  
And leave a beautiful memory
