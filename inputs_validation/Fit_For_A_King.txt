His pulpits a corner at 19th and Main  
His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame  
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin by  
He offers salvation from the savior on high  
  
His khakis are tattered he aint bathed in weeks  
His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks  
He looks like a scarecrow a sight to behold  
While he works for the shepherd bringin lambs to the fold  
  
He points to the Bible he holds in his hand  
Says Im proof that the good Lord can save any man  
  
Son it aint what youre drivin or the clothes that you wear  
Material possessions wont matter up there  
Someday in heaven with the angels Ill sing  
And these rags that Im wearin will be fit for a king  
  
Hes fightin a fever in spite of the chills  
He pulls up his collar and speaks of Gods will  
His body is weakened but his faith is still strong  
Hes filled with conviction for the mission hes on  
  
Cause a mansion is waitin hell be homeless no more  
And his words will still echo from that far distant shore  
  
Son it aint what youre drivin or the clothes that you wear  
Material possessions wont matter up there  
Someday in heaven with the angels Ill sing  
And these rags that Im wearin will be fit for a king
