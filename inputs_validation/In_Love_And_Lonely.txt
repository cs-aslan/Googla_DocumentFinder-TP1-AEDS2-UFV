In love and lonely  
Just to see you cry  
In love and lonely  
  
Im not with you my baby  
  
Im in love with you  
Not the tears in your eyes  
I cant remember  
The last time you smiled  
Oh I know how it feels  
I know what its like  
To be  
In love and lonely  
  
In love and lonely  
Dont what to do my baby  
  
Its not alright  
This cant be the end  
  
The time to say good bye  
No I wont walk away that easy  
After all this time  
Oh you know how it feels  
You know what its like  
  
In love and lonely  
To be  
In love and lonely  
  
Oh you know how it feels  
You know what its like  
You know how it is  
But you just cant stop crying  
In love and lonely  
  
In love and lonely  
  
In love and lonely  
In love and lonely
