In the desert where we searched for gold  
The daysre hot the nightsre cold  
Hank and Joe and me walked on  
So bold and brave and free  
For days and days we fought the heat  
I got so thirsty and I got so weak  
And when I fell cause I couldnt go  
I heard Hank say to Joe  
Hes dyin  
Dyin dyin  
For water  
Hear him cryin  
Cryin cryin  
For water  
Well lay him down in the dust and sand he said  
Joe you know hes a dyin man  
Leave him there and let him die  
I cant stand to hear him cry for water  
I dont remember how long I lay  
But when I awoke it was the break of day  
Buzzards circled miles ahead  
I knew Hank and Joe were dead  
My eyes were dimmed but I could see  
A bed of gold nuggets under me  
Now I know that it wont be long  
Till they decorate my bones  
Cause Im dyin  
Dyin dyin  
For water  
Cant help cryin  
Cryin cryin  
For water  
Well they laid me down in the dust and sand he said  
Joe you know hes a dyin man  
Leave him there and let him die  
I cant stand to hear him cry for water  
He couldnt stand to hear me cry for water
