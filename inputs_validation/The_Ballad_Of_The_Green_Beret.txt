Fighting soldiers from the sky  
Fearless men who jump and die  
Men who mean just what they say  
The brave men of the Green Beret  
  
Silver wings upon their chest  
These are men Americas best  
One hundred men will test today  
But only three win the Green Beret  
  
Trained to live off natures land  
Trained in combat handtohand  
Men who fight by night and day  
Courage peak from the Green Berets  
  
Silver wings upon their chest  
These are men Americas best  
One hundred men will test today  
But only three win the Green Beret  
  
Back at home a young wife waits  
Her Green Beret has met his fate  
He has died for those oppressed  
Leaving her his last request  
  
Put silver wings on my sons chest  
Make him one of Americas best  
Hell be a man theyll test one day  
Have him win the Green Beret
