Flo Rida  
Everythin safe gotta walkin safe  
Treadmill rapper still runnin in place  
All these meals I can share my plate  
Flo Rida full yeah I already ate  
  
Plenty to give or take Im bout business  
Make no mistake hey this serious this real estate  
Is some million it just out weigh  
My position Im cuttin cake Im the chef in the kitchen late  
On my recipe bill gates on the essence Im all the way  
  
Dont worry bout a dollar don dollar with the product  
Aint no problem if you starta you a starter you get hot up  
Grand pieces I got em I get em ballin like somethin  
Consider the show stopper Im all in the damn profit  
  
Chorus  
  
Brisco  
My life is straight Im livin good I aint hurtin for nothin  
I knock the riches in them word but Im workin with somethin  
The Escalade all pearl you control it with buttons  
They keep the tabs on they curb when I come through stuntin  
Thats Brisc best to believe it seatin on skates  
Im the don take it or leave it throw it in ya face  
Big Bs makin it rain no need to hate  
Got beef loadin them things grip the whole case  
I got my money right and Im livin up some rubba bands  
Hit the club baby bet I spend a couple grand couple grand  
Im pitchin chauffeur keys under hand  
When Im on the scene know that Brisc be a wanted man

Ricky Ross  
Im pitchin my jeans Im gettin brain everyday  
Bitches thicker than Venus I told Serina she can train  
Got my money like a train its always on track  
I love my money more than fame so explain the all black  
All black Maybach in the back Im gettin blown  
People wanna build a case Im like fuck it just bring it on  
Then maybe it make me stronger

Still hustlin out the honda  
Just tryin to take out my momma  
Gotta problem nigga holla

All this shit Ima copppa  
Suck dick and cant stop her  
Doin tricks with big poppa  
  
Chorus
