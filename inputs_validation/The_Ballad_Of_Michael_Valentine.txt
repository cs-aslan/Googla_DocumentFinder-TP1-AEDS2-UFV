Michael plays with stars  
Soul Sister wont you take a ride in his car  
Late to call  
When you wanted to be all  
  
Baby dont be so shy  
Rock children hold your heads up high  
In the night while I try  
And tell the ballad of Valentine  
  
You got it bad but you know its true  
  
I caught up with a friend in Dallas  
We took a trip to New Orleans  
Those blackeyed ladies  
Wont say theyre sorry  
  
We finally caught a train to Memphis  
Where everybody talks the same  
Those blue suede babies  
All know my name  
  
And I said hold tight  
Cant you see its hurting me  
But Ive got the buzz  
Like Marlon Brando  
Michael Valentine cant we unite  
  
We ended up in North Dakota  
Although my hearts in Mexico  
My  
All went to Soho  
  
With your new suit and your black tie  
Hold on youre just a gambling man all proper like  
I broke to the right and I caught your eye  
Shut your mouth and wave goodbye  
Tonight I aint gonna let you rain on this parade  
  
And I said hold tight  
Cant you see its hurting me  
But Ive got the buzz  
Like Marlon Brando  
Straight faced with misery tonight  
  
And I will not lie when I say I aint cold no more  
But Ive got the buzz  
Like Greta Garbo  
Walking forwards in the sun  
And Ive got a cold tale left to write  
  
Well uh oh  
I know hes gonna be there tonight
