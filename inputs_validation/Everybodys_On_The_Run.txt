First time I ran  
Was to the end of the block  
I didnt know then  
That it never would stop  
Mow I look around  
And what do I see  
More and more people  
Running faster then me  
These days  
Everybodys on the run  
  
When I fell in love  
For the very first time  
I couldnt keep up  
With that girl of mine  
On a mighty fast track  
She ran like the wind  
And she never looked back  
These days  
Everybodys on the run  
  
Now Ive been to England  
And Ive been to France  
Ive learned to love oysters  
And I know how to dance  
Someday Ill die  
And come back again  
As some little boy  
Just running to win  
These days  
Everybodys on the run  
  
Look in the mirror  
And what do I see  
The gypsy and fool that I always will be  
These days  
Everybodys on the run  
These days  
Everybodys on the run
