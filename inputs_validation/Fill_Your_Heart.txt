Fill your heart with love today  
Dont play the game of time  
Things that happened in the past  
Only happened in your mind  
Only in your mindforget your mind  
And youll be freeyea  
The writings on the wall  
Freeyea And you can know it all  
If you choose Just remember  
Lovers never lose  
Cause they are free of thoughts unpure sic  
And of thoughts unkind  
Gentleness clears the soul  
Love cleans the mind  
And makes it free  
  
Happiness is happening  
The dragons have been bled  
Gentleness is everywhere  
Fears just in your head  
Only in your head  
Fear is in your head  
Only in your head  
So forget your head  
And youll be free  
The writings on the wall  
Freeyea And you can know it all  
If you choose Just remember  
Lovers never lose  
Cause they are free of thoughts unpure  
And of thoughts unkind  
Gentleness clears the soul  
Love cleans the mind  
And makes it free
