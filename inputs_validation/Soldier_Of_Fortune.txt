Ill follow my dreams like a soldier of fortune  
Id rather chase rainbows than stay here  
And grow old and never know  
How high I could fly if I reach for the sky  
Its my turn to try  
So Ill take my best hold  
Ive done my time in the beer and wine mines  
Tryin to climb with my own kind of rhymes  
It aint easy  
Ive had my doubts what theyre mostly about  
Whether I should reach out to the crowd  
To just try to please me  
Chasin the brass rein and bendin guitar strings  
Are the things I enjoy most of all  
We can just call this a mission of mercy  
But the soldier of fortune should fall  
Ill follow my dreams  
I already know its a rough row to hoe  
But I cant let go  
Ive been almost so close a few times  
My sights are all set its my chance to get  
Somethin better than whatever  
It is that Im leavin behind  
Chasin the brass rein and bendin guitar strings  
Are the things I enjoy most of all  
We can just call this a mission of mercy  
But the soldier of fortune should fall  
Ill follow my dreams like a soldier of fortune  
Id rather chase rainbows than stay here  
And grow old and never know  
How high I could fly if I reach for the sky  
Its my turn to try  
So Ill take my best hold  
Ill follow my dreams like a soldier of fortune
