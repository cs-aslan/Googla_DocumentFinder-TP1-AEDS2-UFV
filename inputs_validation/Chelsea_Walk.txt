I went down to Chelsea Walk  
Where the sun doesnt shine at all  
And I went looking for something for me  
But I came back with nothing at all  
Except an old man who could not see  
But he said that he knew God  
In Chelsea Walk  
On Chelsea Walk  
  
Now Ive been down to Chelsea Walk  
Where the sun just refuses to shine  
And I ran back to my little room  
And I jumped straight into a bottle of wine  
You know Ill be alright for just a day  
But tomorrow I must wake  
In Chelsea Walk  
On Chelsea Walk  
  
Old man I must be on my way  
Dont you worry Im just scared for those who pray  
In Chelsea Walk  
On Chelsea Walk
