I remember what my father said  
He said You dont slow down  
Youre gonna end up dead  
I remember what my brother said  
He said Youre runnin blind  
Like a bird flyin into the sun Yeah  
  
They might be older than me  
But the eyes of the seeker  
Are the ones that see  
  
Old man with a new brown bag  
Washed away his home  
Hung over the nag  
Threw the ring in the river  
At the end of the street  
Then he laid on down in the park  
With the bag at his feet Yeah  
  
He might think hes really free  
But the eyes of the seeker  
Are the ones that see  
All All yall  
  
Try to push it further  
Than you think your life is worth  
Or youll get nowhere  
Spendin all your time with the devil  
Grind Your mind  
Stead of sittin home  
Lyin in your bed  
Sayin you just dont care Well  
  
Big Daddy from the back of the cell  
Said You want to last  
You gotta run like hell  
But Big Daddy must been runnin slow  
He told me the views real good  
From the top of the rope Yeah  
  
Its overcast with an ill decree  
And the eyes of the seeker  
Are the ones that see
