I got the style but not the grace  
I got the clothes but not the face  
I got the bread but not the butter  
I got the window but not the shutter  
  
But Im big In Japan  
Im big in Japan  
Hey but Im big in Japan  
Im big in Japan  
  
I got the house but not the deed  
I got the horn but not the reed  
I got the cards but not the luck  
I got the wheel but not the truck  
  
But hey Im big in Japan  
Im big in Japan  
But hey Im big in Japan  
Im big in Japan  
  
I got the moon I got the cheese  
I got the whole damn nation on their knees  
I got the rooster I got the crow  
I got the ebb I got the flow  
  
I got the powder but not the gun  
I got the dog but not the bun  
I got the clouds but not the sky  
I got the stripes but not the tie  
  
But hey Im big in Japan  
Im big in Japan  
Im big in Japan  
Im big in Japan  
Im big in Japan  
  
Heyho they love the way I do it  
Heyho theres really nothing to it  
  
I got the moon I got the cheese  
I got the whole damn nation on their knees  
I got the rooster I got the crow  
I got the ebb I got the flow  
  
I got the sizzle but not the steak  
I got the boat but not the lake  
I got the sheets but not the bed  
I got the jam but not the bread  
  
But hey Im big in Japan  
Im big in Japan  
Im big in Japan  
Hey Im big in Japan  
Im big in Japan  
Im big in Japan
