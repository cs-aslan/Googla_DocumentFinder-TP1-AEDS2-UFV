Lonesome Number Onejust call me Lonesome Number One  
Although no titles have I wonI surely must be Lonesome Number One  
  
Every love Ive had has faded like the dew  
Every one Ive wanted has wanted someone new  
Heartaches hang around and always come  
I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
  
Lonesome Number One just call me Lonesome Number One  
Although no titles have I won I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
  
It seems Im always losing love just cant come near  
Just when love gets close it always disappears  
Sorrow always keeps me on the run  
I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
  
Lonesome Number One just call me Lonesome Number One  
Although no titles have I won I surely must be Lonesome Number One  
Just call me Lonesome Number One here I come Im Lonesome Number One
