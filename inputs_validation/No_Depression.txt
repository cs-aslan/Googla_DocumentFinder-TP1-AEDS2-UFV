Fear the hearts of men are failing  
These our latter days we know  
The great depression now is spreading  
Gods word declared it would be so  
  
Im going where theres no depression  
To a better land thats free from care  
Ill leave this world of toil and trouble  
My homes in heaven  
Im going there  
  
In this dark hour midnight nearing  
The tribulation time will come  
The storms will hurl the midnight fear  
And sweep lost millions to their doom  
  
Im going where theres no depression  
To a better land thats free from care  
Ill leave this world of toil and trouble  
My homes in heaven  
Im going there  
  
Im going where theres no depression  
To a better land thats free from care  
Ill leave this world of toil and trouble  
My homes in heaven  
Im going there
