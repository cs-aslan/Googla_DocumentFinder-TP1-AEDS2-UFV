At the first sign of the morning light  
Old Glory is in the sky  
Cross the pond its afternoon and the Union Jack flies high  
Were on our first cup of coffee were on our third cup of tea  
We cant pretend to live on different planets you and me  
In this collision of worlds watch the new day dawn on a distant shore  
In this collision of worlds oh you cant sit this out no more  
  
Abbey Road Route 66 cia to the mi6 right lane left lane  
Metric Imperial pounds dollars howdy cheerio  
V8 growl to a V12 scream Hail to the Chief well God Save the Queen  
Cops bobbies tabasco wasabi pistachio ice cream  
In this collision of worlds its too late you cant stop it now  
In this collision of worlds yeah find your place and just watch it now
watch it now  
  
Yeah youre a good old boy well youre at decent bloke  
I say its irony I say its a joke  
When I look around now I can see  
We aint so different you and me  
  
Meat and potatoes bangers and mash  
Dollars pounds dosh cash autobahn to the rising sun  
The I10 to the M1 Congress Parliament president the queen  
Petrol you say gasoline now grab your bird and get your girl now  
Its a small world  
Collision of worlds watch the new day dawn on a distant shore  
In this collision of worlds no you cant sit this out no more  
Its a collision of worlds  
Its too late you cant stop it now  
Collision of worlds find your place and watch it now watch it now
