Across the ocean across the sea  
Starting to forget the way you look at me now  
Over the mountains across the sky  
Need to see your face I need to look in your eyes  
  
Through the storm and through the clouds  
Bumps on the road and upside down now  
I know its hard babe to sleep at night  
Dont you worry  
Cause everythings gonna be alright aiaiaiaight  
Be alright aiaiaiaight  
  
Through the sorrow and the fights  
Dont you worry  
Cause everythings gonna be alright aiaiaiaight  
Be alright aiaiaiaight  
  
All alone in my room  
Waiting for your phone call to come soon  
And for you oh I would walk a thousand miles  
To be in your arms holding my heart  
  
Oh I  
Oh I  
I love you  
And everythings gonna be alright aiaiaiaight  
Be alright aiaiaiaight  
  
Through the long nights  
And the bright lights  
Dont you worry  
Cause everythings gonna be alright aiaiaiaight  
Be alright aiaiaiaight  
  
You know that I care for you  
Ill always be there for you  
I promise I will stay right here yeah  
  
I know that you want me too  
Baby we can make it through anything  
Cause everythings gonna be alright aiaiaiaight  
Be alright aiaiaiaight  
  
Through the sorrow and the fights  
Dont you worry  
Cause everythings gonna be alright aiaiaiaight  
Be alright aiaiaiaight  
  
Through the sorrow and the fights  
Dont you worry  
Everythings gonna be alright
