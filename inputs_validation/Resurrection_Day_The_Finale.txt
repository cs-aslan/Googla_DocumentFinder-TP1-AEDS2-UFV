Fire and water victims change  
Seasons learning nothings gained  
Now the time has come apparition waiting  
Before the hours of doom approaching lies  
In these hallowed halls sanctuary reach me  
Before the hour of dooms approaching lights  
  
And the dark gods awaken into the sun  
And their darkness is frozen fortunate one  
They will not heal they now will follow  
The sacred light and sound  
  
Angry now but you are not beaten down  
Whispered wind the verdict leaves him unbound  
In the flowing course of time a greater honor for thee  
Will be found on the shores of my country  
Power surge echoes down from the sky  
Raise your fist cultivate noble lives  
Clothe them now in garments dyed  
Matching gold of the sky  
Bold enough to sleep where they lie  
  
Rise up rise again after the ring of fire  
Youll see them recover their honor and grace  
Rise up ride the wind this is the end of violence  
Believe in the sunlight on this chosen night  
  
Im returning slowly to the ground its resurrection day  
Returning slowly to the ground  
  
Rise up rise again after the reign of terror  
The skies are proclaiming the city is blest  
Rise up ride the wind after the ring of fire  
The moment of never on this frozen night  
The curse walks among you  
  
Rise up rise again after the reign of terror  
Youll see them recover the garden of life  
Rise up ride the wind after the ring of fire  
The bond of the goddess guards this chosen night  
  
Rise up ride the wind after the ring of fire  
The skies are proclaiming the city is blest  
Rise up ride the wind after the reign of terrord  
With fortune inside us on this dawn of night  
  
Were alive the gods arrive the cracks of doom roll by  
Steer the course that pallas walks dont let the violence fall  
Under the spell of darkness or light  
We are proven now fortune rides on our side  
Descend to paradise its narrow virgin bright  
Endless night  
  
Guide the rings of the sun now we are all forms in one  
  
Victory in the sunlight of union above and below  
  
Sacrosanct lords of the skies revere the queen of remorse  
Wielding the signs of grace the signs of faith  
And their darkness aligns with your rays  
  
Victory in the sunlight of union we stand  
  
Im returning slowly to the ground its resurrection day  
Returning slowly to the ground  
To the ground
