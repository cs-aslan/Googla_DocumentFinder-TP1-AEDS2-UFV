My teardrops remind me that Im water blue  
A conscience too healthy for all Ive been through  
The sun shines and I think that I should improve  
But Im heartsick and Im water blue  
Im heartsick and Im water blue  
Whiskey in water and salt in my tears too many long nights for too many years  
They say Ill forget you but I never do Im heartsick and Im water blue  
Im heartsick and Im water blue  
 dobro  sax   
As blue as an ocean as blue as a lake thinking about you and all my mistakes  
All I ever wanted was my job and you now Im heartsick and Im water blue  
Im heartsick and Im water blue
