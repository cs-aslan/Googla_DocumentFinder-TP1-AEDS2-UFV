Uh my head is like a sharks fin  
  
Chorus  
were in deepest bluest my head is like a sharks fin  
the deep deepest bluest my head is like a sharks fin  
blue sea deepest bluest my head is like a sharks fin  
ah ah deepest bluest my head is like a sharks fin  
  
Manmade terror  
Hungry jaws of death  
Yall dont cross my depths  
Ill pause your breaths  
I cause you to sink down forty thousand leagues  
Bleeding to death with no arms in short sleeves  
My worlds deep blue  
Killers gotta eat too  
Looking for human flesh to rip my teeth through  
Other fish in the sea but barracudas aint equal  
To a half human predator created by a needle  
Jet black eyes baby they stare while you sleep  
When your titanic sink Im the one you gon meet  
Hearing terrified screams they surround my team  
All you see is trails of blood  
Even god wont intervene  
Nightmares of darkness  
My appetite is heartless  
Even if we related you eliminated regardless  
In the deep blue underwater wars  
Half man half shark  
My jaws dont pause  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Our father who art in heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
Killers sworn to beast  
Swallowed them in flames  
Switch my dna  
Flip me into cool j  
I cant fight the feelin  
Im born to kill prey  
To survive an attack  
Theres only one way  
Battle to the death  
Thats how sharks play  
Weapons left behind  
We dueling with the mind  
You blind crippled or crazy  
Youre real easy to find  
Struggling to float  
With heomorhages in your throat  
Getting the lap dance  
While I smash through your boat  
Eat your whole fam  
Nothing left but da right hand  
Clinging to a rail  
Escape attempts fail  
Youll never make it home  
Tear the flesh off your bone  
Walking in undercurrents is a dangerous zone  
Im talking death out a moments notice  
You wasnt focused  
Me and my crew strike  
Like some underwater locust  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Uh uh take it deeper  
Uh uh take it deeper  
Uh uh take it deeper  
Uh uh take it deeper  
  
These waters are waist level  
The hallways flooded  
Lost your scuba gear  
The killers coldblooded  
His names ll  
You dont really want it  
I ate your ancestors  
The ocean is haunted  
Im closing in cause Im supposed to win  
How the cold steel feel when it froze your chin  
Should of stayed on dry land  
Stroke while you can  
Cause now you under pressure in the land of the damned  
Abandoned pirate ships  
Eels and sod scum  
Fish that glow in the dark  
The titanics hub  
Underwater storms  
Youre blood is so warm  
Youre life vest is off  
And that turns me on  
Killer for centuries  
The gotti of the deep  
In the next millennium  
Im still gonna creep  
Sand under my belly ocean over my head  
Through the light in the shadows  
You become the living dead  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Yeah dbs
