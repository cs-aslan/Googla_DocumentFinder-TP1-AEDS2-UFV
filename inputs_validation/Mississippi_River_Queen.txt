Hey California you dont know me New York City you cant show me  
Anything I havent seen at least a hundred times before  
I still love you New Orleans Mississippi River Queen  
Cause when it comes to lovin you beat all Ive ever seen  
And Ive seen a lot of ladies in my time  
Ive had me a few women that were fine  
Ah but I dont need no city woman messin with my mind  
So goodbye San Francisco girl Im leavin you behind  
And Ive had some senoritas down in Mexico  
I met a few potatoes up in Idaho  
Ive had a few peaches in Georgia and that San Antoine rose  
If the good Lord made any better that you  
Hes the only one who knows
