  
Was that me  
Was that him  
Did a Prince really kiss me  
And kiss me  
And kiss me  
And did I kiss him back  
  
Was it wrong  
Am I mad  
Is that all  
Does he miss me  
Was he suddenly  
Getting bored with me  
  
Wake up Stop dreaming  
Stop prancing about the woods  
Its not besseming  
What is it about the woods  
  
Back to life back to sense  
Back to child back to husband  
No one lives in the woods  
There are vows there are ties  
There are needs there are standards  
There are shouldnts and shoulds  
  
Why not both instead  
Theres the answer if youre clever  
Have a child for warmth  
And a Baker for bread  
And a Prince for whatever  
Never  
Its these woods  
  
Face the facts find the boy  
Join the group stop the Giant  
Just get out of these woods  
Was that him yes it was  
Was that me No it wasnt  
Just a trick of the woods  
  
Just a moment  
One peculiar passing moment  
Must it all be either less or more  
Either plain or grand  
Is it always or  
Is it never and  
Thats what woods are for  
For those moments in the woods  
  
Oh if life were made of moments  
Even now and then a bad one  
But if life were only moments  
Then youd never know you had one  
  
First a Witch then a child  
Then a Prince then a moment  
Who can live in the woods  
And to get what you wish  
Only just for a moment  
These are dangerous woods  
  
Let the moment go  
Dont forget it for a moment though  
Just remembering youve had and and  
When youre back to or  
Makes the or mean more  
Than it did before  
Now I understand  
  
And its time to leave the woods
