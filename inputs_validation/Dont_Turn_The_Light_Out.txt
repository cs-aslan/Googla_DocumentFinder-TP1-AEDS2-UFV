On my way home I met an  
Old friend of mine  
We walked and we talked an shared  
A bottle of wine  
  
We started to dance and my  
Intentions were good  
How could I know Id be misunderstood  
I promised to call before the weekend  
  
Was through  
Wed all get together sho she could  
Meet you  
I was just being friendly I met her  
  
By chance  
You gotta believe me  its not a romance  
Dont turn the light out Im starting to see  
Dont turn the light out youre getting to me  
  
Dont turn the light out were burning so bright  
Dont turn the light outdont turn the light out  
You gotta see it from my point  
Of view  
  
The same situation could  
Happen to you  
I said it was over before she left  
Town  
  
I cant believe that youre putting me down  
Dont turn the light out Im starting to see  
Dont turn the light out youre getting to me  
Dont turn the light out were burning so bright  
Dont turn the light outdont turn the light out  
  
It would be easy if youd lighten up  
Do it to please me enough is enough  
All that weve been through how can you doubt  
The ups an the downs are what lovings about  
So dont turn the light out Im starting to see  
  
Dont turn the light out youre getting to me  
Dont turn the light out were burning so bright  
Dont turn the light outdont turn the light out
