Oh its your face it isnt even  
True the jaws and claims  
You entertain and chew the fungus mold  
Is my intraction  
Oh its only a it is infection  
Only her tonight until I pay  
Only her tonight I fell asleep  
Oh coming from the diarrhea  
Oh her tired form  
I come in peace and live a dirty book  
On the cloudy class fender burn and become a childhood mess  
Only her tonight until I plea  
Only her tonight until I sing  
Oh take me back lets just concise some  
Flies bugs and fleas and even meal cant  
Stain the vaseline  
Its headed burgers out  
In case it learns and takes its childhood such
