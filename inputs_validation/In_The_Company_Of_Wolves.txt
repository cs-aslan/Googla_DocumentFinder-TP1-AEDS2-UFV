I was lost but now I am found  
A line was crossed a vessel run aground  
The boy has gone lets grieve and let him go  
He left at dawn but its a new day dont you know  
  
In the company of wolves I sat in silence  
Observant and afraid  
He was there with the eyes like glowing embers  
The man you see was made oh whoa whoa  
  
I was low but now I am high  
It helps to know serenity from ennui  
Oh oh somethings wrong somethings wrong  
When it all remains the same  
So face the fire come into your name  
  
In the company of wolves I sat in silence  
Observant and afraid  
He was there with the eyes like glowing embers  
The man you see was made oh whoa ooh  
  
Even I cant recall how many days I had been out there for  
But when all those lights cease to shine  
I was alive I think for the first time  
Infinity it falls in feathery folds  
But she bites like loveless eyes  
And with her belly full she called this rite of passage  
It was the longest night of my life  
  
It was the longest night of my life  
  
Even I cant recall how many days I had been out there for  
But when all those lights cease to shine  
I was alive I think for the first time  
Infinity it falls in feathery folds  
But she bites like loveless eyes  
And with her belly full she called this rite of passage  
It was the longest night of my life  
  
It was the longest night of my life
