Come join the love boat  
Were anchored offshore  
Martinis and bikinis  
Oh lamour  
  
Loved up in lame  
Quest ce quon va faire  
Live your love like Heaven  
Sur la mer  
  
Well just float cause the beach is boring  
Our loveboat is more alluring  
Well sail on with savoir faire  
Sur la mer  
  
Have an Havana  
Pass me a peach  
Rub on some lotion  
The places l cant reach  
  
Cool down with cocktails  
Lose all your cares  
007 Heaven  
Sur la mer  
  
Well just float cause the beach is boring  
Our love boat is more alluring  
Well sail on with savoir faire  
Sur la mer  
  
Were in a place where Heaven breathes  
Making some love and shooting the breeze  
Living out the memories well share  
Sur la mer  
  
Waltz in the wake of the shore  
I will be there  
Marine sunset dream Im your cure  
I will be there  
  
Well just float cause the beach is boring  
Our love boat is more alluring  
Well sail on with savoir faire  
Sur la mer  
  
Were in a place where Heaven breathes  
Making some love and shooting the breeze  
Living out the memories well share  
Sur la mer
