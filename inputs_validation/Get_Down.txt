Chorus  
And thats the only way we get down we get down  
Cause thats the only way we was taught we was taught  
And everything we got we bought we bought  
And real niggas still shine in the dark still shine in the dark yeah  
And thats the only way we get down we get down  
And thats the only way we was taught we was taught  
And everything we got we bought we bought  
And real niggas still shine in the dark  
Still shine in the dark fuck a law oh  
Cause thats the only way we get down

We aint cut from the same cloth you Downy soft  
Bullets separate ya body compound a buster  
Im a find ya if ya hiding Im a bounty hunter  
In ya home putting dick all down ya woman  
You come home we in the bedroom counting money  
I bring her home and I fuck her on a thousand hundreds  
Then I shoot the nasty bitch in the mouth for nothing  
I say Birdman Birdman whats good today  
We aint never let them niggas take our food away  
And we recognize real and got a rude awakening  
And woke up together and our life was better  
Im the Cash Money son I live a life of cheddar  
Not a rat though hat low Nikes is leather  
Lil maw twist two get my life together  
Ya bitch meet me at the bar and we knife together cut  
  
Chorus  
  
Throw my weight like Sherman Klump  
I gotta hold up my estate like Donald Trump  
And I aim kinda straight when its time to pump  
I bring the pump when its time to pump  
Wrapped around my waist like a cumber bun  
Dont make a nigga pump you up  
I come in that new thing she threw up  
Now yo bitch ass gotta clean yo shoe up  
Im rich as fuck and I never blew up  
Business mug gotta get my loot up  
Bet ya bitch get fucked if I ever met her  
Bet ya ditch get dug you ever step up  
One by one I push em down fat bullet fat head make a pussy sound  
Hard head soft ass make a gushy ground Im straight from a crooked town  
Like that bitch  
  
Chorus  
  
I give my arms and my legs to the game Im ahead of the game  
I dead any mane if he said anything  
But its cool as long as nigga paid when he came  
And Im a fool with the flame and the caine  
Cut it just a little bit but the drain stay the same yeah  
Young Wayne and the pain and the stain still remain  
On the chest where the four made a mess yes  
Im still here in the flesh twenty one year old legend  
Im a live way after my death  
I sacrifice whatever thats left  
I give yall the last of my breath like  
Write it down take a picture record a copy  
Press pause only way you stop me fucker  
Im a get mine and make you not me  
Spit wine in ya face if you watch me Bitch  
  
Chorus  
  
And thats the only way we getting down nigga  
Cash Money CMB man

See me if you got a problem boy
