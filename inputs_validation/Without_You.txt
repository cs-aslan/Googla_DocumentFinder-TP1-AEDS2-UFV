Im feeling low I tear out my hair  
Walking round in circles like I dont care  
One shoe off the other one on  
Cause I threw the damn shoe the night that you were gone  
Im in the mood Im in such a mess  
My heart is broken and Im in distress  
Dont want to eat dont want to sleep  
Cause Im thinking bout the dirty way you treated me  
Im in no mood for company  
You see I just dont want your pity  
  
Cause I call your name to drive me insane  
And I feel the need to make my heart bleed  
And baby I dont know why Im drowning in tears  
Cause I dont want to die  
So I find myself another way to learn to live another day  
Without you yeah  
  
Looking down at the way I get dressed  
I need to know is that why you left  
My face is sweet but my head is wrecked  
By the things that you said on the night you left  
You can keep your sympathy  
Because I just dont want your pity  
  
Cause I call your name to drive me insane  
And I feel the need to make my heart bleed  
And baby I dont know why Im drowning in tears  
Cause I dont want to die  
So I find myself another way to learn to live another day  
Without you  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I can live without you Im telling you girl now  
I can live without you can you hear me  
  
You know you can keep your sympathy  
Because I just dont want your pity  
  
Cause I call your name to drive me insane  
And I feel the need to make my heart bleed  
And baby I dont know why Im drowning in tears  
Cause I dont want to die  
So I find myself another way to learn to live another day  
Without you baby  
  
I call your name I call your name to drive you insane to drive me insane  
Cause I feel the need cause I feel the need to make my heart bleed to
make my heart bleed  
And baby I dont know why Im drowning in tears  
Cause I dont want to die  
So I find myself another way to learn to live another day  
Without you baby
