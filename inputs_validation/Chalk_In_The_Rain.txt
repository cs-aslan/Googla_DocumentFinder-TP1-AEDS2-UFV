We want it all we want it now  
We want life to be fair everybody does  
We lose ourselves under the faces  
That we learn to wear oh we just wanna be loved  
Were so busy tryin to find wonderland  
We forget just what weve got right here in our hands  
  
All I know is we gotta hold on to  
The beautiful before its gone  
Life is a sidewalk Mona Lisa  
And it breaks your heart when you see her  
Wash away  
Its all just chalk in the rain  
  
We wanna laugh we wanna live  
Were dyin for peace in the worst way  
When will we learn to trust each other  
Have a little faith and not be afraid  
Every moments fleeting like a breath in the wind  
The truth is we may never pass this way again  
  
Lets slow down  
Take a good look around  
At what we got  
Before the sky opens up  
  
Its all just chalk in the rain
