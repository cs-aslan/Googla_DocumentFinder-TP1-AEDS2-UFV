Go home pretender  
I think this is the end here  
Its been a long time decidin  
But I think Ive found the right end  
  
Youre gonna go away start a new life  
Forget today start a new life  
Start a new life  
  
Hopes crushed and battered  
But you laugh as if it didnt matter  
This joke is gonna turn blue  
And I wont be there to hold you  
  
Youre gonna go away start a new life  
Forget today start a new life  
Start a new life  
  
Go home debater  
It was soon and now its later  
And thats only a piece of paper  
So dont you stand there alaughin and awavin it  
  
Youre gonna go away start a new life  
Forget today start a new life  
Start a new life
