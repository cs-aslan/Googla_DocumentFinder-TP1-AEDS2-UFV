Theres a new wind blowing like Ive never known  
Im breathing deeper than Ive even done  
And it sure feels good to finally feel the way I do  
And I want to love somebody love somebody like you  
  
And I let go of all my lonely yesterdays  
Ive forgiven myself for the mistakes Ive made  
Now theres just one thing the only thing I want to do  
I want to love somebody love somebody like you  
  
Chorus  
Yeah I want to feel the sunshine  
Shining down on me and you  
When you put your arms around me  
You let me know theres nothing in this world I cant do  
  
I used to run in circles going nowhere fast  
Id take one step forward and took two steps back  
I couldnt walk a straight line even if I wanted to  
I want to love somebody love somebody like you  
  
Oh here we go now ooo yeah  
Hey I want to love ya baby  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Yea I want to feel the sunshine  
Shining down on me and you  
When you put your arms around me  
Well baby there aint nothing in this world I cant do  
  
Sometime its hard for me to understand  
But your teaching me to be a better man  
I dont want to take this life for granted like I used to do no no  
I want to love somebody love somebody like you  
  
Im ready to love somebody love somebody like you  
I want to love somebody love somebody like you  
  
Hey I want to love ya baby ah uh  
  
I want to be the man in the middle of the night shining like its true  
I wanna to be the man that you run to whenever I call on you  
When everything that loved someone finally found its way  
I wanna be a better man I can see it in you yeah  
  
Hey I want to love you baby  
  
Ah ah yeah na na na na na
