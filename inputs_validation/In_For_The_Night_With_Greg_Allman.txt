In for the night  
With greg allman  
  
Snuggle with me mama like you used to  
Weathers kind of cold but I dont care  
Slip off your old red flannel nightgown  
Getting to feel like fall  
Hey were a fallen pair  
  
Chorus  
Well theres a bluebird  
Flying home to Mobile  
Camping in your cornfield for a while  
Seems he just backed into a square meal  
And hes in for the night  
  
See that fine yellow moon a rising  
Through the frost along the window pane  
All of your shooting stars  
Are in the wrong direction  
Well I love you darling  
But you just seem to change  
  
Chorus  
  
Strut with me mama like you used to  
Weathers kind of cold but I dont care  
Slip off your old red flannel nightgown  
Getting to feel like falling with a fallin fare  
  
Chorus
