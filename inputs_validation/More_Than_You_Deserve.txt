From the very first moment I saw you I knew our love would be so strong  
And the very first moment I kissed you I knew our joy would last so long  
And then I saw you making love to my best friend I didnt know whatever to
say  
I saw you making love to my best friend  
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said  listen boy  
  
Chorus  
  
Wont you take some more its what you came for  
And dont mind me I wont throw you no curves  
Have yourself a ball with my good woman  
Wont you take some more boy its more than you deserve  
Wont you take some more boy its more than you deserve  
  
When I saw you hanging round the truck stop shining like an angel in the
night  
And when I saw you crying like a baby I knew youd have to be my wife  
  
Then I saw you making love to my best friend I didnt know whatever to say  
I saw you making love to my best friend  
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said  listen boy  
  
Now I think Im gonna have to leave you  
Because Im feeling much too weak to share  
And the pie oh its cut in too many pieces  
The flavor that I crave is no longer there  
  
Then I saw you making love to two of my best friends  
I didnt know whatever to say  
I saw you making love to a group of my best friends  
So I looked them right in their eyes and I said  listen here group  
  
Wont you take some more boys its more than you deserve
