Verse 1  
Its another bad dream  
Poison in my blood stream  
Im dying but I cant scream Cant scream  
Will you show me the way  
  
Its another wolf bite  
Howlin in the moonlight  
I wanna get my life right  
Will you show me the way  
Tonight  
  
Chorus  
If the darkness falls and my angel calls  
In my despair In my despair  
Will you be there  
In the darkest night  
When I need your light  
Will you show me the way  
If my time runs out and the sky falls down  
Despite my fear  
Will you appear  
If the world goes blind  
And I lose my mind  
Will you show me the way  
Tonight  
  
Postchorus  
Will you show me the way  
Tonight  
Will you show me the way  
Tonight  
  
Verse 2  
Its another nightmare  
I swear theres something out there  
So save me cause Im so scared  
Will you show me the way  
  
Its another warewolf  
All dressed up in sheeps wool  
And changing when the moons full  
Will you show me the way  
  
Chorus  
If the darkness falls and my angel calls  
In my despair In my despair  
Will you be there  
In the darkest night  
When I need your light  
Will you show me the way  
If my time runs out and the sky falls down  
Despite my fear  
Will you appear  
If the world goes blind  
And I lose my mind  
Will you show me the way  
Tonight

Despite my fear  
Will you appear  
If the world goes blind  
And I lose my mind  
Will you show me the way  
Tonight
