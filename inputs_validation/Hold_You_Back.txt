How dyou know the music when you dont know the score  
Do you think that you can make it when you dont need no more  
Is it really the reason when it is not a need  
Are you trying hard to write it before you can read  
  
Hold you back hold you back and slow you down  
Hold you back hold you back slow you down  
Hold you back hold you back slow you down  
Slow you down youve gotta try  
  
Does the clock that youre watching ever tell you bout the time  
Does the song that youre singing sound to you like a rhyme  
Will there be an answer when you stop asking why  
All because of the jigsaw that makes up a lie  
  
Hold you back hold you back slow you down  
Hold you back hold you back slow you down  
Hold you back hold you back slow you down  
Slow you down youve gotta try
