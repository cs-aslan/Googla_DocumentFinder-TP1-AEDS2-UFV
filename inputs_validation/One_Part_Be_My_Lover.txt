When he looks into her eyes  
He sees only the truth  
Telling him hes been living a lie  
over and over like a line in a song  
About all the love he let pass by  
  
To her he might be the man of her dreams  
To find where shes been hiding inside  
Broken or battered it really doesnt matter  
Her hearts like a wave and hes the tide  
  
Theyre not forever theyre just for today  
One part be my lover one part go away  
  
Hes like a boxer who had to retire  
After winning but killing a man  
Hes got all the moves and none of the courage  
Afraid to throw a punch that might land  
  
Not too much later she cant meet his glance  
You see her start pulling away  
Over and over like fire and ice  
One is color one is grey  
  
Theyre not forever theyre just for today  
One part be my lover one part go away  
  
So if you know how  
Why dont you sayem a prayer  
Theyre need all the help they can get  
They remember too much about what went wrong  
It might be they should learn to forget  
  
Forget themselves in each other  
And leave what belongs in the past  
Carry their hearts like a newborn child  
Cause its only the moment that lasts  
  
Theyre not forevertheyre just for today  
One part be my loverone part go away
