Every day  
Girl I wake up and pray  
That youll come back home  
Dont take too long  
Cause since youve been gone  
Everythings gone all went wrong  
I wish you were here  
holding me near  
  
You know Id go  
out of my mind  
If you ever left  
my heart behind  
So Im begging you please  
Bring your sweet love back to me  
  
If I dont have you  
Dont have you  
to hold on to  
to hold on to  
I cant go on  
in this world alone  
Baby Its true  
Baby Its true  
If I dont have you  
If you say goodbye  
you said goodbye  
Girl I would die  
Girl I would die  
Im a star with no light  
a day with no night  
If I dont have you
