It could rain for a thousand days  
Or something I dont know  
Look to the sun and were having fun  
Beside the river flow  
Youre doing this and youre doing that  
Workin all the time  
Tonight youll call me on the phone  
Youve got a worried mind  
  
And when you leave  
Youll go away  
Gone to stay  
Dont feel so bad  
It was nice what we had  
Youll be glad  
  
Ill miss you  
Theres a moon and its bright tonight  
The sun has gone away  
Stop the sweat and Ill feel alright  
You know I like it this way  
Youre packin stuff for your big big move  
In just a couple of days  
Youll be off on youre big big cruise  
Across the USA  
  
And when you leave  
Youll go away  
Gone to stay  
Dont feel so bad  
It was nice what we had  
Youll be glad  
  
Ill miss you  
Ill miss you  
Ill miss you
