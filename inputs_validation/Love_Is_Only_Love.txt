Dolly  
Horace vandergelder mrs horace vandergelder  
Just leave evrything to me  
Though it wont be like the first time  
How can it be like the first time  
But why does it have to be  
Dont look for shooting stars  
For love is only love  
You touch and still you touch the proud  
Dont listen for those bells  
For love is only love  
And if its love youve found  
Your heart wont hear a sound  
And you hold his hand  
You only hold his hand  
The violins are all a bluff  
But if youre really wise  
The silence of his eyes  
Will tell you  
Love is only love  
And its wonderful enough  
Without the shooting star  
Without the sounds of bells  
Without the violins  
Love is wonderful enough
