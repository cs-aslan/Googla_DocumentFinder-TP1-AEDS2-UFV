Say my hell is the closet  
Im stuck inside  
Cant see the light  
And my heaven is a nice house in the sky  
Got central heating  
And Im alright  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Cant see the light  
Keep it locked up inside  
Dont talk about it  
Talk about the weather  
Cant see the light  
Open up my head and let me out little baby  
Here we have been standing for a long long time  
Treading trodden trails for a long long time  
  
I say my hell is the closet Im stuck inside  
Cant see the light  
And my heaven is a nice house in the sky  
Got central heating and Im alright  
Here we have been standing for a long long time  
Treading trodden trails for a long long time  
I find sometimes its easy to be myself  
Sometimes I find its better to be somebody else  
  
I see you young and soft oh little baby  
Little feet little hands little baby  
One year of cryin and the words creep up inside  
Creep into your mind  
So much to say  
Here we have been standing for a long long time  
Treading trodden trails for a long long time  
I find sometimes its easy  
To be myself  
Sometimes I find its better  
To be somebody else  
  
So much to say  
Open up my head and let me out  
Little baby
