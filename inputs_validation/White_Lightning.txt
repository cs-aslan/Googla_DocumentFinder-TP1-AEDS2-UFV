Well way back in Carolina way back in the hills  
Lived my ol pappy and we had us a still  
Well we brewed white lightning till the sun went down  
Id fill him a jug and hed pass it around  
Mighty mighty pleasin my daddys gone squeezin  
Sssh mercy white lightning  
  
Oh the Gmen Tmen and revenuers too  
Searchin for the place where he made his brew  
They were lookin tryin to book him  
But my daddy kept on cookin pprrrsss white lightning  
  
Well my mammy asked pappy what hed call his brew  
White lightning stead of mountain dew  
I took a little sip and right away I knew  
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue  
Well lightning started flashing thunder started crashing  
White lightning
