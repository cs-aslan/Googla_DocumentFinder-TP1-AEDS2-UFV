I want a guy to love me  
One who will love me completely  
Not like the last  
Whos in the past  
Who broke my heart and made me cry  
  
I wish that he could come and kiss me  
And tell me that he misses me  
I know someday  
Hell come my way  
And Ill never be lonely again  
  
I dont need riches like diamond rings  
As long as he loves me thats everything  
As long as he holds me tight  
As long as he treats me right  
Ill never let him out of my sight  
  
I want a guy with a love thats true  
One that I can tell my troubles to  
Hell be my guy  
And stay by my side  
Id be so glad if I only had  
  
A guy a guy  
Why cant I have a guy  
A guy
