Eva  
The actress hasnt learned the lines youd like to hear  
Shes sad for her country sad to be defeated  
By her own weak body  
  
Crowds  
Evita Evita repeat in background  
  
I want to tell the people of Argentina  
Ive decided I should decline  
All the honors and titles youve pressed me to take  
For Im contented  
Let me simply go on as the woman who brings her people  
To the heart of Peron  
  
Dont cry for me Argentina  
The truth is I shall not leave you  
Though it may get harder for you to see me  
Im Argentina and always will be  
  
Have I said too much  
Theres nothing more I can think of to say to you  
But all you have to do is look at me to know  
That every word is true
