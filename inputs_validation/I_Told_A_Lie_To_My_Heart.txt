I told my heart I didnt love you  
That Id be happy if wed part  
But now I know I was mistaken  
I told a lie to my heart  
I told my heart I didnt love you  
Now well forever be apart  
Lonely years of tears and sorrow  
I told a lie to my heart  
If we sin somehow we pay  
And now the bitter teardrops start  
I must learn to live without you  
I told a lie to my heart  
I told my heart I didnt love you  
That Ill be happy if well part  
Lonely years of tears and sorrow  
I told a lie to my heart
