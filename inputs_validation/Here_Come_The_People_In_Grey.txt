I got a letter this morning with serious news thats gone and ruined my day  
The borough surveyors used compulsory purchase to acquire my domaine  
Theyre gonna pull up the floors theyre gonna knock down the walls  
Theyre gonna dig up the drains  
  
Here come the people in grey theyre gonna take me away to Lord knows where  
But Im so unprepared I got no time to pack and I got nothing to wear  
Here come the people in grey  
To take me away  
  
Me and my babys gonna get on a train thats gonna take us away  
Im gonna live in a tent were gonna pay no more rent were gonna pay no more
rates  
Were gonna live in a field were gonna buy me gun to keep the policemen
away  
  
Im gonna pass me a brand new resolution  
Im gonna fight me a one man revolution someway  
Gonna beat those people in grey  
But here come the people in grey  
To take me away  
  
The people in grey have gone and taken away my right to voice my complaint  
Her Majestys Government have sent me a form I must complete it today  
But its making me blue dont want to tell all my secrets to  
The people in grey  
  
Im gonna pass me a brand new resolution  
Im gonna fight me a one man revolution someway  
Gonna start my rebellion today  
But here come the people in grey  
To take me away  
  
Oh Lord those people in grey  
I gotta get back at those people in grey  
Here come the people in grey  
To take me away
