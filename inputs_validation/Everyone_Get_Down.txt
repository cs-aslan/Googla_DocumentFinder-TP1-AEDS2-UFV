Everyone Get Down  
Rock your body  
Work your body  
Rock it all night long  
Doesnt matter where youre from  
You gotta keep it goin strong  
On the beaches of Ibizia  
They got it goin on  
And they lose their mind every time  
They hear this song  
From Miami to Havannah  
From the streets of LA to the Kasbah  
Down in Mexico out to Tokyo  
All over the world theres a party  
I think its time we get one started  
Everyone get down  
Move up now  
Youre getting closer to me  
Check my sound  
And how its flowin through me  
Everyone get down  
Move up now  
Youre getting closer to me  
Check my sound  
And how it flows  
Rock your body  
Work your body  
Rock it all night long  
Enjoy it while its underground  
It wont be there for long  
Simplify and amplify  
And unify us all  
Let yourself lose control  
When you hear this call  
From Miami to Havannah  
From the streets of LA to the Kasbah  
Down in Mexico out to Tokyo  
All over the world theres a party  
I think its time we get one started  
Everyone get down  
Move up now  
Youre getting closer to me  
Check my sound and  
How its flowin through me  
Everyone get down  
Move up now  
Youre getting closer to me  
Check my sound  
And how it flows
