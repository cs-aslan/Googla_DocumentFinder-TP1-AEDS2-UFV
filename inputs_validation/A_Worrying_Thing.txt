Will you ever say what I fear youre dying to say  
Well I dont mind if I dont think about it  
Another sleepless night reading over by the only light  
But I dont mind if I dont think about it  
What scares me most  
Ill keep from you  
If you want me to Ill keep from you  
  
Does it makes sense to you getting old living life 22  
Well I dont mind if I dont think about it  
Lets go far away  
Lets leave today  
If you want us to well leave today  
Will you ever say
