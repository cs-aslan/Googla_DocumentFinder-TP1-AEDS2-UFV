I should thank you for the flowers  
Cant imagine how you came to think of those  
That same colour rose for me  
My world is made up of memories  
You and I the laughter and tears  
You never need to worry  
  
I cant see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be so many others  
But I cant see anything  
See anything but you  
  
I remember all the good things  
When you held me for the first time  
Things were right  
On that rainy night for us  
Love then now and forever  
No time real and right where we are  
As good as my eyes can be  
  
I cant see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be some many others  
But I cant see anything  
See anything but you  
  
No one ever cried  
No one ever stood in the way  
Evrybody lies  
Evrybody buys what love is today  
You can be a fool  
In the beginning baby you were there  
And when youre winning  
What do you do  
Dont ask me  
  
I cant see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be so many others  
But I cant see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be so many others but  
  
repeat last verse and fade out
