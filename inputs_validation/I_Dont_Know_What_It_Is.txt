Can you feel it  
  
Nothing that I do is right  
I think Ive had an oversight  
You dont know what youre doin to me  
Why do you always put me down  
Its better when youre not around  
We always seem to disagree  
  
Youre killing our love  
Youre screwing me up  
I cant take no more  
And Ive had enough  
Again it aint right  
Im choking inside  
I love you in death and the afterlife  
  
But I dont know what it is that keeps me goin  
You get enough of this it keeps us flowin  
Im pushin ahead and you cant stop me now  
  
Took some time to realize  
I saw it right before my eyes  
That we dont get along anymore  
I tried my best to make it work  
You always keep me in the dark  
And now Im feeling oh so unsure  
  
But you know I love ya  
Youre stringin me out  
I cant anymore and Ive had enough  
And it aint right  
Im chokin inside  
Ill love you to death in the afterlife  
  
But I dont know what it is that keeps me goin  
You get enough of this it keeps us flowin  
Im pushin ahead and you cant stop me now  
And I dont know what it is that makes it matter  
So tell me what to give to make it better  
Im pushing ahead and you cant stop me now  
  
Pushin and ashovin  
Pushin and ashovin  
Pushin and ashovin  
Pushin and ashovin  
  
But I dont know what it is that keeps me goin  
You get enough of this it keeps us flowin  
Im pushin ahead and you cant stop me now  
And I dont know what it is that makes it matter  
So tell me what to give to make it better  
Im pushing ahead and you cant stop me now  
  
Dont know what it is  
Dont know what it is  
Dont know what it is
