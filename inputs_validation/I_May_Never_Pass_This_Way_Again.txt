Little girl dont be so quit to give your love so free  
Little girl what makes you want to throw yourself with me  
Just in your teens youre lookin more like twenty one  
You run ahead of life when its only just begun  
Dont you know I may never pass this way again  
Little girl youd better go before Id change my mind  
Little girl walk away while you still have the time  
Its just a part of growin up someday youll see  
Then youll wonder what you ever saw in me  
Dont you know I may never pass this way again  
Mama sets home awaitin you to call by now daddys lookin tired  
Wonder what can she be and what shes doin out now late at night  
Little girl you better go before I lose all sense and my control  
Ill be crossed bridge down on the road and youll be left behind to pay the
toll  
I may never pass this way again  
Little girl wait for him hell soon be on his way  
Little girl you think within what Id do today  
Its just a part of growin up someday youll see  
And then youll wonder what you ever saw in me  
Dont you know I may never pass this way again I may never pass this way again
hmm
