We were just friends babe  
But love came on too strong  
We could not stop  
What we knew was wrong  
We meet in this hotel  
To hide from prying eyes  
Nobody knows  
About out secret life  
  
Weve got ourselves in love babe  
Weve got ourselves in love  
What are we going to do about us  
Were so much in love  
We got ourselves in love girl  
Weve got ourselves in love  
Nothin we can do about us  
Being in love  
Oh were so much in love  
  
Dont talk in my sleep babe  
I dont repeat your name  
But somehow she knows  
That were playing games  
So we talk in whispers  
And plan out getaway  
Weve got to make our move  
Before its too late  
  
Weve got ourselves in love girl  
We got ourselves in love  
What are we going to do about us  
Were so much in love  
Weve got ourselves in love babe  
Weve got ourselves in love  
Nothin they can do  
My conscience says  
That you and I should stay as friends  
My heart pretends oh baby  
With you my life can start again  
Got ourselves in love babe  
Weve got ourselves in love  
Theres nothin they can do about us  
Being in love  
  
We got ourselves in love  
Weve got ourselves in love  
And I know well pull through  
Just being in love
