Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill  
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt  
Ive been burned before and I know the score  
So you wont hear me complain  
Will I be able to count on you  
Or is your love in vain  
  
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude  
When I am in the darkness why do you intrude  
Do you know my world do you know my kind  
Or must I explain  
Will you let me be myself  
Or is your love in vain  
  
Well Ive been to the mountain and Ive been in the wind  
Ive been in and out of happiness  
I have dined with kings Ive been offered wings  
And Ive never been too impressed  
  
All right Ill take a chance I will fall in love with you  
If Im a fool you can have the night you can have the morning too  
Can you cook and sew make flowers grow  
Do you understand my pain  
Are you willing to risk it all  
Or is your love in vain
