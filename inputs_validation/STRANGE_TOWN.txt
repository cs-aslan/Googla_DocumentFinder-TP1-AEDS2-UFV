Found myself in a strange town  
Though Ive only been here for three weeks now  
Ive got blisters on my feet  
Trying find a friend in Oxford Street  
I bought an A to Z guide book  
Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs  
But when you ask in a strange town  
They say dont know dont care  
And Ive got to go mate  
  
They worry themselves about feeling low  
They worry themselves about the dreadful snow  
They all ignore me cause they dont know  
Im really a spaceman from those UFOs  
  
Youve got to move in a straight line  
Youve got to walk and talk in four four time  
You cant be weird in a strange town  
Youll be betrayed by your accent and manners  
  
Youve got to wear the right clothes  
Be careful not to pick or scratch your nose  
You cant be nice in a strange town  
Cause we dont know dont care  
And we got to go man  
  
Rush my money to the record shops  
I stop off in a back street  
Buy myself a snort  
We got our own manifesto  
Be kind to queers  
And Im so glad the revolutions here  
Its nice and warm now  
  
Ive finished with clubs where the musics loud  
Cause I dont see a face in a single crowd  
Theres no one there  
I look in the mirror  
But I cant be seen  
Just a thin clean layer of mister sheen  
Looking back at me  
Oh oh

Break it up  
Burn it down shake it up  
Break it up
