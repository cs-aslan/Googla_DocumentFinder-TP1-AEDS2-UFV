Give you love give you love

I used to be on my own  
Every night every day by myself  
Feeling so far from home  
How could I know I would go  
Down the road that would lead me right into your arms  
Destiny told me that you were the one  
Stars fill the sky now Ive finally found you  
  
No one can love you more  
No one can give it all  
Im gonna give you all my loving  
No one can love you more  
Ill give you my heart and soul  
Feel it deep deep down inside  
  
Give you love give you love  
Im gonna give you all my love all my love  
Give you love give you love  
Im gonna give you all my love all my love ooo yeah  
  
I thought I was wasting time  
Living in hope that Id find a new love  
Life can be so unkind  
How could it be you and me took so long  
To discover that dreams do come true  
Everythings changed since the day I met you  
The suns gonna shine every time were together  
  
No one can love you more  
No one can give it all  
Im gonna give you all my loving  
No one can love you more  
Ill give you my heart and soul  
Ill take you all the way to heaven  
  
No one can love you more  
No one can give it all  
Im gonna give you all my loving  
No one can love you more  
Ill give you my heart and soul  
Feel it deep deep down inside  
  
Yesterday has gone  
And from this moment on you will see  
This will be a forever lasting love  
  
Give you love give you love  
Im gonna give you all my love all my love  
Give you love give you love  
Im gonna give you all my love all my love  
  
No one can love you more
