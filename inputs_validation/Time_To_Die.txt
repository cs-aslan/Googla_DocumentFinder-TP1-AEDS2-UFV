And I have seen wonders  
And I have seen miracles  
Oh I have seen some things  
Its all lost to me now  
Like tears in the rain  
  
And I have seen sadness  
And I have seen time run out  
Ive even seen men cry  
Its all lost to me now  
Like tears in the rain  
  
And my memories  
I cant give them away  
So its easy  
Like a long long sleep  
  
Im so tired  
Now its my time to die  
Welcome home  
Welcome home  
  
No exhibition  
No screaming war songs  
No conversation  
No more opinions here  
  
And I have seen new wars  
And I have seen things  
That you wouldnt believe  
And I have seen my days  
Its all lost to me now  
Like tears in the rain
