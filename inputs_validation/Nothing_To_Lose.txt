Well Im sitting on the bus  
Rolling down through Georgia  
Dont know where Im going  
And I dont care whats new  
Ive got nothing to lose  
  
Well Ive had no sleep  
Going on three days  
Smoked my last cigarette  
Somewhere near Atlanta  
Its true Ive got nothing to lose  
  
Nothing to lose since Ive lost you  
Feeling all alone  
Used to have it all and now my heart is gone  
Its true Ive got nothing to lose  
  
Well were coming up on Macon  
Gonna rest here a spell  
Making idle conversation  
With a stranger without you  
Ive got nothing to lose  
  
Nothing to lose since Ive lost you  
Feeling all alone  
Used to have it all and now my heart is gone  
Its true Ive got nothing to lose  
  
Ooh nothing to lose  
Ooh since I lost you  
  
You left me with no worry  
You left with no cares  
And you took my whole life with you  
And you left me standing there  
Its true Ive got nothing to lose  
  
Nothing to lose since Ive lost you  
Feeling all alone  
Used to have it all and now my heart is gone  
Its true Ive got nothing to lose  
  
Yes its true  
Ive got nothing to lose  
  
Ive got nothing nothing left to lose  
Ive got nothing nothing left to lose  
Ive got nothing nothing left to lose  
Ive got nothing nothing left to lose  
  
Nothing left to lose
