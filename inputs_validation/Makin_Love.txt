I just hate when the girl says wait  
I really want her by my side  
Dont hesitate  
I really want her by my side  
The whole night through  
We do all the things that we wanna do  
Well come on baby dont leave me sad  
Cause youre good lookin the best Ive had  
Makin love makin love makin love makin love  
Makin love makin love all night long  
Makin love makin love makin love makin love  
Makin love makin love all night long  
Ow all night long  
  
Red light green light dont say No  
I really want her she says  
Stop baby go go go  
I really want her by my side  
The whole night through  
We do all the things that we wanna do  
Well come on baby dont leave me sad  
Cause youre good lookin the best Ive had  
Makin love makin love makin love makin love  
Makin love makin love all night long  
Makin love makin love makin love makin love  
Makin love makin love all night  
  
Whoo makin love makin love  
All night long makin love makin love  
Makin love makin love all night long  
  
Makin love makin love makin love makin love  
Makin love makin love all night long  
Makin love makin love makin love makin love
