Shut up  
I dont never want to hear you say that again  
Baby Im not going nowhere  
Look at me you understand me  
  
Now what gave you the silly idea that Im about to leave  
Girl who you been listening to They must be crazy  
Look back and see our past and all the shit that we been through  
Ill be damned if Im gon let this bullcrap take me away from you  
Cause I vow to give my all and girl Im a man of my words  
And on that word Ill stand tall  
Being without you sounds absurd  
So dry your weeping eyes  
Cause Ill be here by your side  
No need to doubt the sky  
Im in this for the long ride  
  
Chorus  
I will never leave no  
You dont have to worry  
Girl I will be right there for you  
I will never leave no  
Baby cant you see  
I was born to be with you  
I will never leave no  
God put us together  
Nothing can take that away  
I will never leave you no  
Now until forever be with you the rest of my days  
  
You never have to question the love I have for you  
Girl I will put my life on bended knees for you  
Ask all my friends theyll tell you  
Your all I talk about  
Even when I go to sleep your the only one I dream about  
See Im your picture girl and baby you are my frame  
And thats why I know our love will stay the same  
So dry your weeping eyes  
Girl Im by your side  
Just trust me Im that guy  
Im in it for the long ride  
  
Chorus  
  
Since that the day the doctor took me out of the womb and spanked me  
Girl I was born to be with you and the rest is history  
Generations and now Im all grown up and you carry my seed  
Now we are flesh and blood  
With you I am in love  
For the rest of my life  
For the rest of my life  
Weve been blessed with a love thats rare  
Thats why Im not going nowhere  
  
Chorus  
  
I was meant to be with you
