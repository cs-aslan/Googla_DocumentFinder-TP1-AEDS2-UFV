Here I am again  
I feel time is dragging on  
Arent you getting tired of me  
Whinging overdrawn  
  
Chorus  
Faceless blind  
Want to take her out again  
Shes not just mine  
Want to take her out again  
  
In a bodiless embrace  
Thriving I have grown  
Fickle changing grip replaced  
Choking take it all  
  
Chorus  
  
Dedicated true to form  
Still the only one  
Only guarantee  
Continue after I am done  
  
Chorus
