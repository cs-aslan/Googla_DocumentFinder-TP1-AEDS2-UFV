Out in the West Texas town of El Paso  
I fell in love with a Mexican girl  
Nighttime would find me in Rosas Cantina  
Music would play and Felina would whirl  
  
One night a wild young cowboy came in  
Wild as the West Texas wind  
Dancing and daring a drink he was sharing  
With wicked Falina the girl that I loved  
So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden  
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore  
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat  
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor  
  
Out through the back door of Rosas I ran  
Out where the horses were tied  
I caught a good one it looked like it could run  
Up on its back and away I did ride  
Just as fast as I could from the West Texas town of El Paso  
Out to the badlands of New Mexico  
I saddled up and away I did go  
Riding alone in the dark  
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me  
Tonight nothings worse than this pain in my heart  
  
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso  
I can see Rosas Cantina below  
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys  
Off to my left ride a dozen or more  
Shouting and shooting I cant let them catch me  
I have to make it to Rosas back door  
Something is dreadfully wrong for I fear  
A deep burning pain in my side  
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle  
Im getting weary unable to ride  
But my love for Felina is strong and I rise where Ive fallen  
Though I am weary I cant stop to rest  
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle  
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest  
  
From out of nowhere Felina has found me  
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side  
Cradled by two loving arms that Ill die for  
One little kiss and Felina goodbye
