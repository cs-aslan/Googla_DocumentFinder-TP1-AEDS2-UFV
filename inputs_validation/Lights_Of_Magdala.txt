Oh the lights of magdala flicker  
Dimly on the shore  
Holy sailor sailing on the sea  
Patiently waiting she walked quietly  
To the door  
Another lonely night in galilee  
Chorus  
Magdalene dont wrap your dreams in sorrow  
Save them for tomorrow if it comes  
When well meet within the circle  
Round the sun  
Oh if heaven were a lady dont you  
Know youd been the one  
Through the streets of jerusalem  
You followed him once more  
Holy sailors come home from the sea  
Someone somewheres calling him  
To a golden distant shore  
Far from the lonely nights in galilee  
Chorus  
Magdalene dont wrap your dreams in sorrow  
Save them for tomorrow if it comes  
When well meet within the circle  
Round the sun  
Oh if heaven were a lady dont you  
Know youd been the one
