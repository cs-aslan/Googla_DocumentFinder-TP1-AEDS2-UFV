Things aint so bad  
They sure could be better  
Things aint so good  
But Im sure it wont last  
Storm clouds above  
But I got my umbrella  
I would if I could  
I cant change the past  
  
Chorus  
Im on the up  
My futures tomorrow  
Why should I worry  
All Ive got to find  
Is another sad someone  
Wholl happily give me  
Must enough loving  
For their peace of mind  
  
Things are a drag  
But Ill get it together  
Things make you strange  
But thats how it goes  
I always say sorry  
So no one remembers  
I caused the pain  
When I struck the first blows  
  
Chorus  
  
Things aint so good  
But Im not complaining  
Things could be worse  
I dont need to tell you  
Hang out your washing  
Its gonna start raining  
Thunder clouds burst  
So tell me whats new  
  
Chorus
