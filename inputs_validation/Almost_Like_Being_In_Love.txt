What a day this has been  
What a rare mood Im in  
Why its almost like being in love  
  
Theres a smile on my face  
For the whole human race  
Why its almost like being in love  
  
All the music of life seems to be  
Like a bell that is ringing for me  
And from the way that I feel  
When the bell starts to peal  
I would swear I was falling  
I could swear I was falling  
Its almost like being in love
