I never feel a thing is real  
When Im away from you  
Out of your embrace  
The worlds a temporary parking place  
  
Mmm mm mm mm  
A bubble for a minute  
Mmm mm mm mm  
You smile the bubble has a rainbow in it  
  
Say its only a paper moon  
Sailing over a cardboard sea  
But it wouldnt be makebelieve  
If you believed in me  
  
Yes its only a canvas sky  
Hanging over a muslin tree  
But it wouldnt be makebelieve  
If you believed in me  
  
Without your love  
Its a honkytonk parade  
Without your love  
Its a melody played in a penny arcade  
  
Its a Barnum and Bailey world  
Just as phony as it can be  
But it wouldnt be makebelieve  
If you believed in me
