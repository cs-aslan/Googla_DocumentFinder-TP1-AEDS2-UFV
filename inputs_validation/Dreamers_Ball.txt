Oh I used to be your baby  
Used to be your pride and joy  
Mmm You used to take me dancing  
Just like any other boy  
But now youve found another partner  
And left me like a broken toy  
  
Oh its someone else youre taking  
Someone else youre playin to  
Honey though Im aching  
Know just what I have to do  
If I cant have you when Im wakin  
Ill go to sleep and dream Im with you  
  
Oh take me take me take me  
To the dreamers ball  
Mmm Ill be right on time and Ill dress so fine  
Youre gonna love me when you see me  
I wont have to worry  
Take me take me  
Promise not to wake me till its morning  
Its all been true  
  
What do you say about that then honey   
Are you gonna take me to that dreamers ball   
Id like that  
Right on that forty second street  
Way down down town we must go  
  
Oh take me take me take me  
Im your plaything now  
You make my life worthwhile with the slightest smile  
Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper  
Gently take me remember Ill be dreamin of my baby  
At the dreamers ball  
  
Oh take me hold me  
Remember what you told me  
Youd meet me at the dreamers ball  
Ill meet you at the dreamers ball  
Ooh
