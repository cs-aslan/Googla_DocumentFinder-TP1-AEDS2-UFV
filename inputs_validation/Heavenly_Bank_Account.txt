And if these words you do not heed  
Your pocketbook just kinda might recede  
When some man comes along and  
Claims godly need  
He will clean you out right through your  
Tweed  
Thats right remember there is a big  
Difference between kneeling down  
And bending over  
Hes got twenty million dollars  
In his heavenly bank account  
All from those chumps who was  
Born again  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
Hes got seven limousines  
And a private plane  
All for the use of his  
Special friends  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
Hes got thousanddollar suits  
And a wembley tie  
Girls love to stroke it  
While hes on the phone  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
At the house of representatives  
Hes a groovy guy  
When he gives thanks  
He is not alone  
He is dealin  
He is really dealin  
Irs cant determine  
Where the hook is  
It is easy with the bible  
To pretend that  
Youre in show biz  
They wont get him  
They will never get him  
For the naughty stuff  
That he did  
It is best in cases like this  
To pretend that  
You are stupid  
Hes got presidential help  
All along the way  
He says the grace  
While the lawyers chew  
Oh yeah  
They sure do  
And the govenors agree to say  
hes a lovely man  
He makes it easier for  
Them to screw  
All of you  
Yes thats true  
cause he helps put the fear of god  
In the common man  
Snatchin up money  
Everywhere he can  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
Hes got twenty million dollars  
In his heavenly bank account  
You aint got nothin people  
You aint got nothin people  
You aint got nothin people  
Thank the manoh yeah
