Peaceful valleys animals and children asking me  
Tell the story that you told of sailors drinking tea  
Tell the one about the man who saddled up the wind  
Pegasus and flying fish and woodsmen made of tin  
  
A kid knows what he wants to be before hes nine or ten  
Cowboys clowns and men of war and someone elses friend  
But nine grows into big boys pants and then to scars and pain  
Twentys fast and hard as nails but doesnt come again  
  
Theres days to fall and days to rise and days for making haste  
Days for seeking out yourself but no days you can waste  
Nighttimes filled with love so good it aches to rest it down  
Endless hallways dark with sleep and rivers dark with sound  
  
Peaceful valleys animals and children asking me  
Tell the story that you told of sailors drinking tea  
Tell the one about the man who saddled up the wind  
Pegasus and flying fish and woodsmen made of tin  
  
Children climbing on my arms and pigeons on my head  
Get thee up my little man and dream a dream instead  
dream a dream of rocking chairs and flying through the night  
Dream until the mornings gone and turned the dark to light  
  
Then come and get your daddy if he hasnt blown away  
Rock him in your childrens hands and help him find his way  
Take him to your hiding place and let him come inside  
Hell never tell your secret cross my heart and hope to die  
  
Peaceful valleys animals and children asking me  
Tell the story that you told of sailors drinking tea  
Tell the one about the man who saddled up the wind  
Pegasus and flying fish and woodsmen made of tin
