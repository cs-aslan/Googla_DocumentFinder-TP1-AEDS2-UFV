Jump down the shelters to get away  
The boys are cockin up their guns  
Tell us general is it party time  
If it is can we all come  
  
Dont think that we dont know  
Dont think that were not trying  
Dont think we move too slow  
Its no use after crying  
Saying  
  
Its a mistake its a mistake  
Its a mistake its a mistake  
  
After the laughter as died away  
And all the boys have had their fun  
No surface noise now not much to say  
Theyve got the bad guys on the run  
  
Dont try to say youre sorry  
Dont say he drew his gun  
Theyve gone and grabbed old Ronnie  
Hes not the only one saying  
  
Its a mistake its a mistake  
Its a mistake its a mistake  
  
Tell us commander what do you think  
Cause we know that you love all that power  
Is it on then are we on the brink  
We wish youd all throw in the towel  
  
Well not fade out too soon  
Not in this finest hour  
Whistle your favorite tune  
Well send a card and flower  
Saying  
  
Its a mistake its a mistake  
Its a mistake its a mistake
