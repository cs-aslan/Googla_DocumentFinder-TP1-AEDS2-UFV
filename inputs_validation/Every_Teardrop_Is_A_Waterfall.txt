I turn the music up I got my records on  
I shut the world outside until the lights come on  
Maybe the streets alight maybe the trees are gone  
I feel my heart start beating to my favourite song  
  
And all the kids they dance all the kids all night  
Until Monday morning feels another life  
I turn the music up  
Im on a roll this time  
And heaven is in sight  
  
I turn the music up I got my records on  
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song  
Dont want to see another generation drop  
Id rather be a comma than a full stop  
  
Maybe Im in the black maybe Im on my knees  
Maybe Im in the gap between the two trapezes  
But my heart is beating and my pulses start  
Cathedrals in my heart  
  
As we saw oh this light I swear you emerge blinking into  
To tell me its alright  
As we soar walls every siren is a symphony  
And every tears a waterfall  
Is a waterfall  
Oh  
Is a waterfall  
Oh oh oh  
Is a is a waterfall  
Every tear  
Is a waterfall  
Oh oh oh  
  
So you can hurt hurt me bad  
But still Ill raise the flag  
  
Oh  
It was a wa wa wa wa waaterfall  
A wa wa wa wa waaterfall  
  
Every tear  
Every tear  
Every teardrop is a waterfall  
  
Every tear  
Every tear  
Every teardrop is a waterfall  
  
Every tear  
Every tear  
Every teardrop is a waterfall
