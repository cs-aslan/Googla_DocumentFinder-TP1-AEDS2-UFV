Anybody looking on they can see youre not so good  
People in the know they can see I miss you  
In the night with no one to hear me Im afraid and I cry  
Seasons change but theres nothing changes my mind  
  
Ive been loving you too long and I cant seem to stop  
You are my lifeline you make me happy  
I said that had to say it baby  
Who on earth ever held me like you  
Id like to see someone try  
Love by you and no other loving will do  
  
In your time baby come back to me please  
Dont leave this girl lost in space  
Youre the only one who could guide me out of this maze
