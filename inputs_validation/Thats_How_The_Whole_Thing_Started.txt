I feel just like your love tonight  
So whos to say Im wrong  
Ive got to say I feel just right  
Its never been so strong  
  
There seems so many points to make  
But I feel this is a big mistake  
Were so old and this is new  
And Ive really got to tell you  
I always said that we should remain free  
But that was up to you and not to me  
I started strong but Ive met someone  
You know how long its been  
  
Thats how the whole thing started  
Thats how the whole thing started  
  
Baby baby its wrong  
But Ive been in and out of love so long  
Here we stand not more than friends  
I broke your heart again  
Ive gone and met someone  
  
Thats how the whole thing started  
Thats how the whole thing started  
Thats how the whole thing started  
Thats how the whole thing started
