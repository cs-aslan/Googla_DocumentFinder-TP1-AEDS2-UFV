Well the clouds didnt look like cotton  
They didnt even look like clouds  
I was underneath the weather  
My friends looked a crowd  
The swimmin hole was full of rum  
I tried to find out why  
All I learned was this my friend  
You got to swim before you fly  
  
I got two girls  
Ones in heaven and ones below  
Oh one I love with all my heart  
And one I do not know  
  
Two lonesome dudes on an ugly horse  
Passed by not long ago  
They asked me where the action was  
I said I did not know  
As they disappeared into the brush  
I heard the driver say  
Hes a little slow between the ears  
Hes always been that way  
  
Jolly Jane just lays around  
And listens with her mouth  
Shes had about a dozen husbands  
But the last one pulled out  
Now whos gonna bring her dinner  
Through the weary years ahead  
All shell get from me is sympathy  
Got no time to see shes fed  
  
Its cold down on the bayou  
They say its in your mind  
But the moccasins are treadin ice  
And leavin strange designs  
Cajuns say the last time  
That this happend they werent here  
All Beaumonts full of penguins  
And Im aplayin it by ear
