Inconsequent social infant insolent insignificant  
And youre my sycophant  
Brown noser confidante poser  
Shoved down the garbage disposer sycophant  
Yes feeder accolade breeder  
Like I need another cheerleader  
Youre spineless and morally impotent  
Youre my sycophant  
  
I dont need any more affirmation  
I get enough love in my rockupation arrogant  
Is a word that people call me  
Thats why I dont need any more flattery  
  
Yes dudes and compliment throwers  
Ass kissers anal smoke blowers  
I dont need to feel any more eminent  
From a sycophant  
  
Seriously you guys are totally wrong about Mike being wrong  
And frankly Mikes right about him being right  
Not only that remember my great idea that Mike had last week  
I love it we think its great  
  
Dont inflate my head anymore  
I dont need a bigger ego  
Shoot me down I need regression  
Honesty mixed with rejection  
  
Take me down a rung or three  
I like to live in reality  
My head does not need more inflation  
Its already past regulation  
Brown nosers smoke blowers yes yesers no noers  
Agreeers with meers those drinking my peeers  
  
Yes feeder accolade breeder  
Like I need another cheerleader  
Youre spineless and morally impotent  
Youre my sycophant
