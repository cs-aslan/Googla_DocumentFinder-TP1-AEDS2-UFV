Oh oh oh  
Sitting here with nothin to do  
Sitting here thinkin only of you  
But youll never get out of there  
Shell never get out of there  
Texas chain saw massacre  
They took my baby away from me  
But shell never get out of there  
Shell never get out of there  
I dont care wohoho  
  
When I saw her on the corner  
She told me told me told me told me  
She wouldnt go far  
Ooh now I know Im so much in love  
Cause shes the only girl that Im ever thinking of
