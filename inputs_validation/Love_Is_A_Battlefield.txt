We are young  
Heartache to heartache we stand  
No promises no demands  
Love is a battlefield  
  
Woah  
We are strong no one can tell us were wrong  
Searchin our hearts for so long  
Both of us knowing  
Love is a battlefield  
  
Youre beggin me to go then makin me stay  
Why do you hurt me so bad  
It would help me to know  
Do I stand in your way or am I the best thing youve had  
Believe me believe me I cant tell you why  
But Im trapped by your love and Im chained to your side  
  
We are young  
Heartache to heartache we stand  
No promises no demands  
Love is a battlefield  
  
We are strong no one can tell us were wrong  
Searchin our hearts for so long  
Both of us knowing  
Love is a battlefield  
  
Were losing control  
Will you turn me away or touch me deep inside  
And when all this gets old will it still feel the same  
Theres no way this will die  
But if we get much closer I could lose control  
And if your heart surrenders youll need me to hold  
  
We are young  
Heartache to heartache we stand  
No promises no demands  
Love is a battlefield  
  
We are strong no one can tell us were wrong  
Searchin our hearts for so long  
Both of us knowing  
Love is a battlefield
