1st floor decide what youll be one day  
With a head full of comment and nothing to say  
2nd floor mixed up it happens that way  
Soon you realize that listening dont pay  
3rd floor in limbo no easy moves  
Up or down its time to choose  
  
Chorus  
The elevators going up  
Quick the doors about to shut  
Too late were full just hang around  
It wont be long  it wont be long before its down  
  
4th floor the job hunt and all that you ask  
Is an honest days pay for an honest days graft  
5th floor you may make a little more money  
Now its apparent downstairs aint so fuuny  
6th floor a mortgage a collar and tie  
2 weeks vacation in June or July  
  
Chorus  
  
The elevators going up  
Quick the doors about to shut   
  
7th floor expenses and private schools  
Pushing a pen youre not turning the tools  
8th floor position respect and acclaim  
Move up the 9th for fortune or fame  
10th floor for investment and real estate  
Recouping the redies before its tool late  
11th floor the penthouse the final cut  
With a head full of comment and a mouth that stays shut  
  
Chorus  
  
The elevators going up  
Quick the doors about to shut
