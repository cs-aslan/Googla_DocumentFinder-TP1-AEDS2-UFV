I hold no grudge  
Theres no resentment undneath  
Ill extend the laurel wreath and well be friends  
But right there is where it ends  
  
I hold no grudge  
And Ill forgive you your mistake  
But forgive me if I take it all to heart  
And make sure that it doesnt start again  
  
Yes Im the kind of people  
You can step on for a little while  
But when I call it quits  
Baby thats it  
Im the kind of people  
You can hurt once in a while  
But crawling just aint my style  
  
I hold no grudge  
Deep inside me theres no regrets  
But a gal whos been forgotten may forgive  
But never once forget
