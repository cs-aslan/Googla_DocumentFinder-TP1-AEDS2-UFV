Hey baby youve got nothing to lose  
Nows the time to slip away  
Oh woman cant you see  
I really want you here with me  
Hey Mama I can make you forget  
What you ever saw in him  
Dont understand  
Why you want to be with that man  
  
The time is right so take it from me  
Youll find out when were alone  
Good lovin follows good company  
Theres no tellin what Ill do when I get next to you  
  
Hey baby if you look in my eyes  
I wont let you get away  
Oh woman dont you see  
Id rather have you here with me  
  
Hey Mama dont you tell me good night  
Wheres your curiosity  
Dont understand  
Why you want to be with that man  
  
The time is right so take it from me  
Youll find out when were alone  
Good lovin follows good company  
Theres no tellin what Ill do when I get next to you  
  
I cant explain  
Hope you feel the same  
Want to wake up to love  
I know its true  
Cant get over you  
Want to wake up to love  
  
The night is still young  
Weve got nothing but time  
All alone  
In our own paradise  
  
The time is right so take it from me  
Youll find out when were alone  
Good lovin follows good company  
Theres no tellin what Ill do I just want to feel it too  
  
I cant explain  
Hope you feel the same  
Want to wake up to love  
I know its true  
Cant get over you  
Want to wake up to love
