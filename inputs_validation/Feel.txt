Come and hold my hand  
I wanna contact the living  
Not sure I understand  
This role Ive been given  
I sit and talk to God  
And he just laughs at my plans  
My head speaks a language  
I dont understand  
  
I just wanna feel  
Real love feel the home that I live in  
Cause I got too much life  
Running through my veins  
Going to waste  
I dont wanna die  
But I aint keen on living either  
Before I fall in love  
Im preparing to leave her  
  
Scare myself to death  
Thats why I keep on running  
Before Ive arrived  
I can see myself coming  
  
I just wanna feel  
Real love feel the home that I live in  
Cause I got too much life  
Running through my veins  
Going to waste  
And I need to feel  
Real love and the love ever after  
I cannot get enough  
  
I just wanna feel  
Real love feel the home that I live in  
I got too much love  
Running through my veins  
To go to waste  
  
I just wanna feel  
Real love and the love ever after  
Theres a hole in my soul  
You can see it in my face  
Its a real big place  
  
Come and hold my hand  
I wanna contact the living  
Not sure I understand  
This role Ive been given  
Not sure I understand  
Not sure I understand  
Not sure I understand  
Not sure I understand
