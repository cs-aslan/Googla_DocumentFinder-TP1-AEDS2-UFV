Tell your honey  
Living all alone  
  
I guess Ill always be  
I guess I fear  
Go and tell your honey  
Can help from what Ive seen  
I dont feel true  
Do you anyway  
I can see you sometimes  
And then I just dont care  
She loves loathes me  
She loves loathes me  
I dont think I could ever see  
Tell me that youre near  
So free that Im leaving you behind  
Dont plan to let you say youre sorry  
Indeed so  
Or maybe youll be high  
Be high x3  
Shiver in a bath  
I feel nice  
And see the light
