Hello there my old friend  
Not so long ago it was till the end  
We played outside in the pourin rain  
On our way up the road we started over again  
  
Youre livin out dreams of you on top  
My mind is achin oh lord it wont stop  
thats how it happened livin life by the drop  
  
Up and down the road in our worn out shoes  
Talkin bout good things and singin the blues  
You went your way and I stayed behind  
We both knew it was just a matter or time  
  
Youre livin out dreams of you on top  
My mind is achin oh lord it wont stop  
thats how it happened life by the drop  
  
No waste of time were allowed today  
Churnin up the past theres no easier way  
Times been between usa means to a end  
God its good to be here walkin together my friend  
  
Livin our dreams  
My mind stoped achin  
thats how it happened livin life by the drop
