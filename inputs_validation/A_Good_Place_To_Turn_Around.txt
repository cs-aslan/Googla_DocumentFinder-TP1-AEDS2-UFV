Devils highway hes right beside me  
Whispering in my ear  
He drew the map and set the trap  
But Im the one that got me here  
Made a mess of my whole life  
Burned every bridge I crossed  
Am I too far gone which way is home  
How did I get so lost  
  
Chorus  
Im looking for a good place to turn around  
And get off this road that Im headed down  
Ive gotta find some peace of mind  
Lord send a sign somehow  
I just need a good place to turn around  
  
If You can hear me Im on empty  
Forgive me of my past  
For being hateful to every angel  
You put into my path  
For mamas tears and wasted years  
And getting so off track  
Ill do anything is there any way  
That You can take me back  
  
In the dead of night I see a light  
Shining up ahead  
Theres a parking lot I had to stop  
Cause the little church sign says  
  
Chorus  
Are you looking for a good place to turn around  
And get off that road that youre headed down  
You can find some peace of mind  
What better time than now  
Are you looking for a good place to turn around  
This feels like a good place to turn around
