Neither one of us is getting out of here alive  
Both of us are stranded and we wont make it back inside  
The whole world is blowing away  
We just watch it pass us by  
Yeah it swept up both our  
Feet when we meet in the northern sky  
  
Like thunder and lightning go in the one  
Together we make the perfect storm  
Youre like the wind Im like the rain  
Together we both make hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
  
Were heading towards each other at 150 miles an hour  
Knocking us off course with the force once you feel the power  
Were tryina get away tryina clear the path  
From everything we buried in the aftermath  
Swell like a super cell raging getting louder and louder  
  
Like thunder and lightning go in the one  
Together we make the perfect storm  
Youre like the wind Im like the rain  
Together we both make hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
  
On my own Im just another cold rainy day  
Waiting for the wind to come along and take me away  
But shes just a breeze on a sunny day  
Unless the two of us together  
Man were blown away  
  
Like thunder and lightning go in the one  
Together we make the perfect storm  
Youre like the wind Im like the rain  
Together we both make hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
  
Away hurricanes away hurricanes
