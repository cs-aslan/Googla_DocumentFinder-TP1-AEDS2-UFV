Took a walk alone last night  
Slept inside your head  
It was raining hard again  
Crawled back into bed  
Tried to catch up to you  
But you moved too fast  
Thought about a million things  
Fell asleep at last  
Got up again last night  
Tore all over town  
Skidding tires screeching brakes  
Barely make a sound  
We were on a winding road  
Going 65  
Slid along an icy stretch made it back alive  
Little eyes are open but they dont see very far  
You can only hurt the ones you love  
Not the ones youre thinking of  
Little eyes are open but theyre sinking back again  
Dont you know youre sleeping much too long  
Wake up little eyes  
Moving but not gaining any ground  
Climbing up the escalator as it takes you down  
Last night I heard this sound  
Echoed everywhere  
Like a buzzing amplifier  
Burning through the air  
Its still raining hard you said  
Have you any clue  
Is it ever gonna stop  
I guess thats up to you  
Little eyes are open but they dont see very far  
You can only hurt the ones you love  
Not the ones youre thinking of  
Little eyes are open but theyre sinking back again  
Dont you know youre sleeping much too long  
Wake up little eyes
