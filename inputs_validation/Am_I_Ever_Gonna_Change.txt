Im tired of being me  
And I dont like what I see  
Im not who I appear to be  
So I start off every day  
Down on my knees I will pray  
For a change in any way  
But as the day goes by  
I live through another lie  
If its any wonder why  
  
Am I ever gonna change  
Will I always stay the same  
If I say one thing  
Then I do the other  
Its the same old song  
That goes on forever  
Am I ever gonna change  
Im the only one to blame  
When I think Im right  
I wind up wrong  
Its a futile fight  
Gone on too long  
  
Please tell me if its true  
Am I too old to start anew  
Cause thats what I want to do  
But time and time again  
When I think I can  
I fall short in the end  
So why do I even try  
Will it matter when I die  
Can anyone hear my cry  
  
Am I ever gonna change  
Take it day by day  
My will is weak  
And my flesh too strong  
This peace I seek  
Till thy kingdom comes
