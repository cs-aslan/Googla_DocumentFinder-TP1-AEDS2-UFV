Got no time for foolin with you baby  
Your stupid game is about to end  
You played it out  
Thought you had it made  
And it looks like someone passed you by again  
  
I left her standin in her corner  
She told me she was tryin to find her way  
Ive got to leave before I get much older  
Cause she aint moved in nearly forty days  
  
Ive got a woman thats treatin me better  
She takes her time and she aint so cruel  
Ive got someone to take you over  
Your mother aint so bad  
What happened to you
