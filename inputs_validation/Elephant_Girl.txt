Shes interested in me  
Im interested in her  
But theres a distance  
Each morning as she walks  
Our eyes exchange a thought  
Our hearts an interest  
Ive seen her at the club  
Expanding with the funk  
She looks so brilliant  
She sticks close to her friends  
And when the music ends  
She is the Indian  
Id like to meet the elephant girl  
I feel we know each other so well  
From eyes that meet the love they seek  
Interested to get close to you  
Interested to get close to you  
Im interested to meet  
The girl that looks at me  
I will be trying  
Her color unlike mine  
Her hair the plaited vine  
I will be climbing  
My leg is always pulled  
By friends who really would  
But say they wouldnt  
The jokes against my heart  
Immediately shes barred  
Their hearts are wooden  
Id like to meet the elephant girl  
I feel we know each other so well  
From eyes that meet the love they seek  
Interested to get close to you  
Interested to get close to you  
Im interested in her  
Shes interested in me  
Her distance shortens  
She walks towards the light  
I walk towards the lines  
That seem important  
Im counting up to ten  
By five shes gone again  
Into the distance  
Ill try again to nudge my  
Courage for the love look  
Without resistance  
Id like to meet the elephant girl  
I feel we know each other so well  
From eyes that meet the love they seek  
Interested to get close to you  
Interested to get close to you
