Intro  
The milky milky milk  
The milky milky milk  
The milky milky milk  
The milky milky milk  
  
Verse 1  
The purple that is collapsing  
Head for the hills and prepare your intellect to flow  
The game of life is changing  
Man is about to awake  
Electric sun beams dancing in a liquid in my skull  
  
Chorus 1  
The milky milky milk  
Your tongue licking me so hard  
And from sucking on your nipples  
Licking milky milky stars  
  
PostChorus  
I feel like A slab of butter  
That is melting in the sun  
The presence melts away  
Now that you and me are one  
  
Verse 2  
Little  and the greatest truth appear  
That open up the  of the last 2 billion years  
I ask myself a question  
What the fuck is gone  
But I knew that I knew it  
From the milky milky gods  
  
Chorus 2  
The milky milky milk  
Your lips get me so wet  
While Im singing all the verses from the Tibetan Book of the Dead  
  
Bridge  
The milky milky milk  
The milky milky milk  
Yeah Im digging it  
Its time to look   
Yeah Im digging it  
Its time to look   
Yeah Im digging it  
Yeah Im digging it  
  
Outro  
I feel like a slab of butter  
Yeah Im digging it  
That is melting in the sun  
Yeah Im digging it  
The presence melts away  
Yeah Im digging it  
Now that you and me are one  
Yeah Im digging it  
Now that you and me are one  
Yeah Im digging it  
Now that you and me are one  
Yeah Im digging it  
Yeah Im digging it  
Yeah Im digging it  
Yeah yeah
