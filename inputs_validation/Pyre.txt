Follow the embers into cities of dreams  
What youll be seeing is not all what it seems  
Dawn of the liar  
Futures a pyre  
  
Outside the window I see people passing by  
If they could see me now theyd break down and cry  
  
Look down your senses  
Await the gritting beyond  
And in the morning  
  
Born as a failure  
And died as a stranger  
  
When your countrys bleeding while youre forced to mourn  
  
Outside the window I see people passing by  
If they could see me now theyd break down and cry  
  
Bring me back again
