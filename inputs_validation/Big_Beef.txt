On the road to Damascus  
I met you and the task was thankless  
We were carefree and classless  
And then you changed  
Im nouveau rich  
What can I do  
  
Youre legionnaires on a summer breeze  
Its who you do  
You had something to put to me now  
I got something Im gonna stick in you  
  
I couldnt give a flying toss bout the relatives you lost  
I think its better that  
Your bloodline stops from here  
On in and  
Whoops there I go again  
With friends that I wanna rip apart  
  
Limb by limb  
Soak the skin with paraffin  
Drop a row  
Hitn the limb  
And Max lets see what happens  
Hey now youre getting in my way now  
Youre a waste of time  
Youre a waste of time  
  
You got under my radar  
You said kicking shins in the clock end  
Was just a phase so I paged ya  
And you became my new best friend  
For a while  
  
I should have known you were a psychopath  
Its who you do  
I was lonely we were having a laugh  
Should have known but worshipped a few  
  
I couldnt give a flying toss bout the relatives you lost  
I think its better that  
Your bloodline stops from here  
On in and  
Whoops there I go again  
With friends that Id like to tear apart  
  
Limb by limb  
Soak the skin with paraffin  
Drop a row  
Hitn the limb  
Oh Max lets see what happens  
  
Hey now theres nothing left to say now  
Youre just a waste of time
