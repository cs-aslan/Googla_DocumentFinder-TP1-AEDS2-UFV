Who was with you  where you been  
Baby it cant be this again  
I cant cool it cos I cant win it with you  
  
Words like punches  things we said  
Under the belt and in the head  
Down for the count in a cold cold bed  
Beat by jealousy  
  
Jealousy  jealousy  
Stanglehold  love cant breathe  
Let me be  set me free  
Jealousy  
  
You wont hear what I imply  
What you say  I wont buy  
You deny but you lie  
Jealousy  
  
Jealousy  jealousy  
Stanglehold  love cant breathe  
Let me be  set me free  
Jealousy  
  
Down suspicious  torn in doubt  
Dirty vicious  knock me out  
Danger danger  stakes are high  
Hook the blow between the eyes  
Every round  we lose more ground  
Jealousy  
  
Jealousy  jealousy  
Stanglehold  love cant breathe  
Let me be  set me free  
Jealousy
