Heard somebody speak her name  
They said she was still looking fine  
I could feel that same old flame  
I once felt when she was mine  
Always thought that I was missing something  
But I found out much too late  
Therell never be another who loved me that way  
  
Chorus  
Id like to have that one back  
Ive never known someone so true  
And a love thats pure and sweet  
Is what a man should never lose  
And if my lips had said Im sorry  
She might have stopped right in her tracks  
Now I find my poor heart saying  
Id like to have that one back  
  
I can almost see her standing there  
Tears rolling down her face  
As she packed away her memories  
In that old worn out suit case  
If Id only known then what I know now  
Id never open that door  
Oh they just dont make hearts like hers any more  
  
Chorus  
  
I wouldnt here my poor heart saying  
Id like to have that one back  
I wouldnt here my poor heart saying  
Id like to have that one back
