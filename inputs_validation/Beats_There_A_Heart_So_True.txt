Someone who would try to understand  
Someone whod be thrilled to touch my hand  
An through all eternity shed be good for only me  
Beats there a heart so true  
  
Someone who could make her lips so warm  
That my lonely heart could brave each storm  
Someone whod be miles away still within her heart Id stay  
Beats there a heart so true  
  
Or did I ask too much when I met you  
Or was the task too much to just be a little true  
Ive been told it only hurts a while  
But my broken heart wont crack a smile  
  
Till that someone comes along  
With a love that proves me wrong  
Beats there a heart so true  
  
Ive been told it only hurts a while  
But my broken heart wont crack a smile  
Till that someone comes along  
With a love that proves me wrong  
Beats there a heart so true  
  
So true
