Hey brothers hear me call  
It aint that I had to fall  
Wasnt no ones fault last night  
When I looked up and felt the light  
  
Heres hoping youll understand  
I want to fell like a natural man  
Get up early in the morning to do what I can  
You cant help no one with money  
If you cant with your hands  
  
And you got to be there brothers yes you do  
If the world is turning under you  
Aint no good to sit around  
And bring it up or down  
You got to be there brothers yes you do  
  
Hey brothers now and then  
Theres something that oughta move you  
More than a pen  
You dont need no school or knowledge  
Youve got something else to lend  
And all the people in the world  
Can make it better again  
  
And it aint easy yes I know  
Its a hard and rugged road  
Dont be swindled dont be fooled  
Just be honest and stay cool  
  
Cause you got to be there brothers yes you do  
If the world is turning under you  
Aint no good to sit around  
And bring it up or down  
You got to be there brothers yes you do
