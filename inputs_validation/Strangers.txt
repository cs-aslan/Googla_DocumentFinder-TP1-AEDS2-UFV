I see one thing coming at me  
Im the little girl and you and your friends are the strangers  
You take me away to nowhere anyone else will find us  
We hide we deny all the things weve done to one another  
Going crazy over you  
Youre an alien in disguise  
So extraterrestrial  
Im a hooker  
You work for the government  
  
Im so proud of you you sexual creature  
Hooker  
Were gonna drink until we die  
Well die together  
Were sexual lovers  
Fuck everything else  
Ill fuck you all fucking night  
I bet I can make you yell until your fucking lungs burst  
Youll never be unusual to me  
I may not like your friends but they still arent strangers  
Strangers strangers hooker  
  
Loving calling to my gay friends  
Theyre fucked up bad  
Were bad bad bad bad  
You may be transgendered but I still love you  
A transgendered alien  
So impossible  
No alien birth

Well die together
