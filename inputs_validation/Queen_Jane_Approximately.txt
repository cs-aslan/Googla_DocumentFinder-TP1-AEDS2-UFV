Now when your mother sends back all your invitations  
And your father to your sister he explains  
That youre tired of yourself and all of your creations  
Wont you come see me Queen Jane  
Wont you come see me Queen Jane  
Now the flower lady wants back what she has have lent you  
And the smell of her roses does not remain  
When all your children start to resent you  
Wont you come see me Queen Jane  
Wont you come see me Queen Jane  
Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned  
Have all died in battle or in vain  
And you find yourself sick of all this repetition  
Wont you come see me Queen Jane  
Wont you come see me Queen Jane  
Now when all of your advisers heave their plastic  
At your feet to convince you of your pain  
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic  
Wont you come see me Queen Jane  
Wont you come see me Queen Jane  
Now when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to  
All throw down their bandannas and complain  
Maybe you want somebody you dont have to speak to  
Wont you come see me Queen Jane  
Wont you come see me Queen Jane
