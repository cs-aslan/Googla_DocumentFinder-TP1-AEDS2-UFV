Quiet please theres a lady on stage  
She may not be the latest rage  
But shes singing and she means it  
And she deserves a little silence  
  
Quiet please theres a woman up there  
And shes been honest through her songs  
Long before your consciousness was raised  
Doesnt that deserve a little praise  
  
So put your hands together and help her along  
All thats left of the singers  
All thats left of the song  
Stand for the ovation  
And give her one last celebration  
  
Quiet please theres a person up there  
And shes been singing of the things  
That none of us could bear to hear for ourselves  
Give her your respect if nothing else  
  
Quiet please theres a lady on stage  
Conductor turn the final page  
And when its over we can all go home  
But she lives on  on the stage alone
