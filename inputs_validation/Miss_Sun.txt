Been thinking bout you all night  
Guess you got me in a spell  
But I think that Il be all right  
Even if I dont get well  
  
Chorus  
Hey Miss Sun  
What could I say  
I tried to hold you  
But the moon got in the way  
It wont be long before the morning has you back in my arms  
  
I can still remember  
What you told me with your eyes  
One kiss now its down to this  
Guess its time you realized  
  
Chorus  
Hey Miss Sun  
What could I say  
I tried to hold you  
But the moon got in the way  
It wont be long before the morning has you back in my arms  
  
Hey Miss Sun  
What could I say  
I tried to hold you  
But the moon got in the way  
It wont be long before the morning has you back in my arms  
  
Hey Miss Sun  
What could I say  
I tried to hold you  
But the moon got in the way  
It wont be long before the morning has you back in my arms
