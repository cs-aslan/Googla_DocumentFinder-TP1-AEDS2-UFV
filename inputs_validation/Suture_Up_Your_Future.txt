Im gonna suture up my future  
I aint jaded I just hate it  
See Ive been down too long  
Its kinda hard to explain  
Gone and buried all I carried  
All my evil through a needle  
As it pulled through the eye what was  
What went on around gone  
  
Dont sweat  
Thread to forget  
To feel like youve already gone on  
To the rest of the rest of the life that youve got  
Take a picture and bury it all away  
Bury it all away  
  
Tried to fake it I just cant take it  
I dont care if it hurts  
Just so long as its real  
I wont waste it turned to face it  
Id sharpened a knife then used it till bone made it dull  
Tried explaining done explaining  
I got caught in a plant  
Of all this talking at once  
Ive been giving my love away  
To the things that tear it apart  
Im gonna suture up my future  
  
Thread to forget  
To feel like youve already gone on  
To the rest of the rest of the life that youve got  
Tie the loose ends and bury it all away  
Its like this its like this
