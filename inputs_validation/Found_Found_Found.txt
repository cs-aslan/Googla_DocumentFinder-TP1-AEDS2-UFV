Found found found  
Found found found  
Someone whos worth it  
In this murkiness  
Someone whos never  
Seeming scheming  
Ive  
Found found found  
Found found found  
Someone whos worth it  
In this murkiness  
Someone whos never  
Seeming to be scheming  
  
Oh but if Id never found  
Oh but if Id never found  
Oh but if Id never found  
  
I do believe that  
The more you give your love  
And I do believe that  
The more you give your trust  
The more you give your trust  
And the more you give your love  
The more youre bound to lose  
The more youre bound to lose  
  
Oh but if Id never found  
Oh but if Id never found  
Somebody who wants to be  
Who wants to be with me  
All the time
