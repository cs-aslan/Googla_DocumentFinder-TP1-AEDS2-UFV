Che  
Goodnight and thank you Huevo  
She is in every magazine  
Been photographed seen she is known  
We dont like to rush but your case has been packed  
If shes missed anything you could give her a ring  
But she wont always answer the phone  
  
Eva  
Oh but its sad when a love affair dies  
But we have pretended enough  
Its best that we both stop fooling ourselves  
  
Che  
Which means  
  
Chorus  
Che and Eva  
There is no one no one at all  
Never has been and never will be a lover male or female  
Who hasnt an eye on in fact they rely on  
Tricks they can try on their partner  
Theyre hoping their lover will help them or keep them  
Support them promote them  
Dont blame them youre the same  
  
Che  
Goodnight and thank you Emilio  
Youve completed your task  
What more can we ask of you now  
Please sign the book on the way out the door  
And that will be all if she needs you shell call  
But I dont think thats likely somehow  
  
Eva  
Oh but its sad when a love affair dies  
But when we were hot we were hot  
I know youll look back on the good times weve shared  
Which means   
  
Chorus substituting blame her for blame  
Them sung only by Che  
  
Eva  
There is no soap no soap like Zaz  
No detergent lotion or oil with such power in the shower  
Its the mother and father of luxury lather  
The talk of the bath the great ointment  
One little frolic with new Zaz carbolic  
Youre scented youll be sent  
  
Che  
Goodnight and thank you Senor Jabon  
We are grateful you found her a spot on the sound radio  
Well think of you every time shes on the air  
Wed love you to stay but youd be in the way  
So do up your trousers and go  
  
Eva  
Oh but its sad when a love affair dies  
The decline into silence and doubt  
Our passion was just too intense to survive  
  
Che  
Which means   
  
Lovers  
This is a club I should never have joined  
Someone has made us look fools  
Argentine men call the sexual shots  
Someone has altered the rules  
  
Eva  
Fame on the wireless as far as it goes  
Is all very well but every girl knows  
  
Che  
She needs a man she can monopolize  
With fingers in dozens of different pies  
  
Lovers
