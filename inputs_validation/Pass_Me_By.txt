Does this excite you Think about it Does it not stagger the  
imagination No builder on earth can concieve any structure to  
compare to the mansions above Wont that be something when you go  
to live in your own mansion Therell be no concern about paying for it  
its already taken care of Therell be no worry about veing moved out  
of it It will be yours forever  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
I got shot ah the murder was heinous  
The bullet went in my eyeball and out my anus  
And I was hit that was it on the spot  
Flash I woke up in a parking lot  
And Im sittin in a 64 Reinkeys  
With Shaggy Dope written on the car keys  
I look around I cant believe that its possible  
Im dead and I made it to the carnival  
I walk in its everything I dreamed of  
Everybody and they momma got clown luv  
Japanese Lebanese and Chinese  
Portuguese and southwest ghetto gs woowoo  
Hangin out with redneck truck drivers  
Instead of always givin each other piledrivers  
I see my old homey he died in a drag  
Chillin with two bitches What up Shaggs  
And he passed me a blunt like a tree trunk  
I tried to hit it but couldnt even fuck with it  
And to think I always been afraid to die  
But I aint never goin back to wonder why  
Chorus 2x  
We all gonna die but Im not gonna fry  
Even though most never try  
Im not gonna let this pass me bye no  
Violent J  
I was born first they threw me in a shit pile  
I dealt with it and lived there for a while  
I got dissed on pissed on and beat down  
Mutilated and tossed out a dead clown  
Next thing ya know Im chillin at the big top  
Free money and mad bitches nonstop  
No water its Faygo on tap  
I wash my hair and my face and my buttcrack with it  
cause I can cause Im phat paid  
I got a five story funhouse with a maid  
And she walks around with her titties hanging out  
And when I cough she come and dust my balls off woowoo  
Im headed up to the show Im gonna see  
Jimi Hendrix Selena and Eazy E  
Elvis tried to open up but got dissed off  
We got pissed off because he sounded like butt  
Theres no fights its a perfect match  
Hillbillies in the crowd tryin to cabbage patch  
And to think Ive always been afraid to die  
But I aint never goin back to wonder why  
Chorus 2x  
Violent J  
Did ya ever burn your finger on somethin hey  
Well picture this your nuts burnin that way  
And a roman candle stickin in your butthole  
Thats where the greedy skank motherfuckers go  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
This is all hell now we livin in it  
But this bullshitll be over in a minute  
Then its off to the Faygos and neden hoes  
New clothes and patent leather for your toes woowoo  
Violent J  
And while you sit around cryin for your dead friend  
Hes chillin up there paid getting mad ends  
Hes probably there tryin to figure out why youre sad  
Hes on the beach gettin fat you got it bad  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
And for those who aint down for the next man  
Who rob from the poor and snatch all ya can  
And any chicken talkin shit lemme tell ya something  
Hold a lighter to your balls and youll see whats coming  
Chorus 2x  
Does this excite you Think about it Does it not stagger the  
imagination No builder on earth can concieve any structure to compare  
to the mansions above Wont that be something when you go to live  
in your own mansion Therell be no concern about paying for it  
its already taken care of Therell be no worry about veing moved out  
of it It will be yours forever  
Chorus 10x
