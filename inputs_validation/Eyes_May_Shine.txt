Yeah yeah  
Look you couldve got away but your response wasnt quick enough  
Cant preserve life cause the best wasnt thick enough  
Teflon Napalm Homicide scenes  
These are a few of my favorite things  
But I aint Mary so aint a damn thing poppin  
Only death disease and a whole lota palm trees  
Not only for mics Xzibit is a way of life  
Until my death so I celebrate success  
Best of the best wouldnt test these waters with a yacht  
Sendin sixteen shots across your parking lot  
All up on your proximity drinking Hennessy  
Holdin down ground like the Statute of Liberty  
So nobody ever can rush my spot  
And the torch stay lit so I aint worried about shit  
It aint where your from its al about how you represent  
Unfamiliar faces better know who your fuckin with  
  
Chorus 2x  
Eyes may shine Teeth may grit  
And all of that shit  
And you still wont step  
So whats next  
All of a sudden you aint sayin nothin  
You Better off buckin yourself  
You need to stop frontin  
  
Im only comin through when its time for collection  
Xzibit forever nasty spread like infection  
Aint no protection ever made by man to withstand this punishment  
In other words runnin shit  
Keep your eyes wide cause the style gets darker  
I make papers and see more new cars than Bob barker  
Cause if the price aint right then its time to take flight  
Let the piece go twice to make sure you see the light  
Plus Im dreaded not by the locks but by the cops  
And flocks of females that only think with their croth  
Unlimitted smoke  
The bonified cut throat Columbian neck tie  
Now dont you look fly  
Ill leave you there to be discovered by your mother  
Or maybe your brother or your boty boy lover  
No matter your backround Xzibit never backs down  
Be prepared for static and semi automatics in your grill  
  
Chorus 2x  
Eyes may shine Teeth may grit  
And all of that shit  
And you still wont step  
So whats next  
All of a sudden you aint sayin nothin  
You Better off buckin yourself  
You need to stop frontin  
  
Everything that come around go 360  
Longtitude and latitude  
Its alll in the attitude  
Im in the mood to put a twist on things  
Xzibit here to rock the planet till the fat bitch sings  
The shit is closer than you think  
Dont blink it might be over in a matter of seconds  
Id like to say this off the record  
But its not  
So I testify to the fact  
Chronic mixed with the Yak make a hellified contact  
It makes it real easy to trip  
Unload the whole clip on your block then split  
aint no answers to the test you taken  
Never move fakin  
Cant be shaken  
From my solid foundation like this  
  
Chorus 2x  
Eyes may shine Teeth may grit  
And all of that shit  
And you still wont step  
So whats next  
All of a sudden you aint sayin nothin  
You Better off buckin yourself  
You need to stop frontin
