Im the only one down here  
Whos got nothing to say  
About the war  
Or the rice  
That keeps going astray on its way to bombay  
And the smog that keeps polluting up our shores  
Is boring me to tears  
Why dont you call me miss odell  
Im the only one down here  
Whos got nothing to fear  
From the waves  
Or the night  
That keeps rolling on right up to my front porch  
The record players broken on the floor  
And ben he cant restore it  
Miss odell  
I can tell you  
Nothing new  
Has happened since I last saw you  
And Im the only one down here  
Whos got nothing to say  
About the hip  
Or the dope  
Or the cat with most hope to fill the fillmore  
And your pushing shoving ringing on my bell  
Is not for me tonight  
So wont you call me miss odell  
Wont you call me miss odell
