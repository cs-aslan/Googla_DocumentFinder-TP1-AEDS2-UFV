Born in pure innocence  
Born without fear  
  
She says mommy what did I do wrong  
To make you cry your angry tears   
  
Feeling dirty and ashamed  
Keeps making up excuses  
Shes learned how to hide the pain  
But she cant hide the bruises anymore  
  
Theres no light behind her eyes  
Shes tryin to find love in a strangers touch  
14 years old and so alone  
Desperate for what she needs so much  
  
Michael She cries herself to sleep at night  
And prays she wont wake up  
Love shouldnt hurt  
Love shouldnt scar  
But sometimes we can be so blind  
To the way things really are  
Love can be so unkind  
Truth is that hearts get broken every day  
But love should never hurt this way  
  
Children having children  
And growing up too fast  
  
If youve never been shown love  
How can you give love back  
  
Her newborn babys cryin  
Its more than she can stand  
  
She doesnt see the tragedy  
When she raises her own hand  
  
Theres no light behind her eyes  
She doesnt realize what she has done  
Didnt think she was being so rough  
  
Little one wont you please wake up  
  
Chorus X2  
  
 But love should never hurt this way
