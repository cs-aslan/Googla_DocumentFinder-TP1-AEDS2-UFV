Im sitting here praying that you werent just saying  
Leaving tomorrow was what you had planned  
No point in pretending I know that its ending  
I just want to know where the ending began  
  
Chorus  
Where did I go wrong to make it like this  
No warmth in your body no touch in your kiss  
Holding you now hurts more than it should  
If I let you go girl youll be gone for good  
  
I thought you had saved me the love that you gave me  
The sweetest loving in all of the land  
But youve taken my heart and youve torn it apart  
And its crumbled to dust in the palm of your hand  
  
Chorus  
  
Where did I go wrongetc  
Theres nothin worth sayin I know youre not staying  
Might as well face it its out of my hand  
No point in pretending I know that its ending  
I just want to know where the ending began  
  
chorus  
Where did I go wrongetc
