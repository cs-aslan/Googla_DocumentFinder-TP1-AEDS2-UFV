Looking back on everything  
And all the things that stay  
I can count on memories  
Because they dont go away  
Good times were hard to hold  
Until she came along  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
  
Im not always there I know  
But she dont mind at all  
As pretty as a picture  
That hangs on my own wall  
Shes like Mississippi  
When the sun comes up at dawn  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
  
With an angel on my left side  
And a devil on my right  
Shes the one who saves me  
From them dark and holy nights  
Of all the ones whove left me  
Its a wonder shes not gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
  
She dont care what the game is  
Shes always down to play  
My world without her  
Seems a million miles away  
She dont have to worry  
I know where I belong  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
  
Ive been dealt some aces  
And Ive played them all the same  
But shes the only one  
That keeps me in the game  
No fame or fortune  
Could ever keep me gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
  
With an angel on my left side  
And a devil on my right  
Shes the one who saves me  
From them dark and holy nights  
Of all the ones whove left me  
Its a wonder shes not gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
  
Theres a magic down in Memphis  
That never seems to fade  
Even now them voices carry  
Like a lonely serenade  
Its the memories that still  
And always will be on my mind  
They move me every time  
  
She sees the good  
In everything there is to see  
Sometimes I wonder  
What she ever sees in me  
Im not always right you know  
But shes never led me wrong  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
  
In all my travels  
Ive never found a way  
To find the words that say  
The things Id like to say  
Ive sang some melodies  
But shes my favorite one  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
  
With an angel on my left side  
And a devil on my right  
Shes the one who saves me  
From them dark and holy nights  
Of all the ones whove left me  
Its a wonder shes not gone  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song  
She moves me like a Memphis soul song
