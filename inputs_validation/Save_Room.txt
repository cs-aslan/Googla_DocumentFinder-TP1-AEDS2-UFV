Say that youll stay a little  
Dont say bye bye tonight  
Say youll be mine  
Just a little bit of love is worth a moment of your time  
Knocking on your door just a little  
So cold outside tonight  
Lets get a fire burning  
Oh I know I keep it burning right  
If you stay wont you stay stay  
  
Save room for my love  
Save room for a moment to be with me  
Save room for my love save a little  
Save a little for me  
Wont you save a little  
Save a little for me oh  
  
This just might hurt a little  
Love hurts sometimes when you do it right  
Dont be afraid of a little bit of pain  
Pleasure is on the other side  
  
Let down your guard just a little  
Ill keep you safe in these arms of mine  
Hold on to me pretty baby  
You will see I can be all you need  
If you stay wont you stay stay  
  
Save room for my love  
Save room for a moment to be with me  
Save room for my love save a little  
Save a little for me  
Wont you save a little  
Save a little for me oh  
  
pa ya pa pa  
pa ya pa pa  
pa ya pa pa  
da da da  
  
Oh come on  
Make time to live a little  
Dont let this moment slip by tonight  
Youll never know what youre missing till you try  
Ill keep you satisfied  
If you stay wont you stay stay  
  
Save room for my love  
Save room for a moment to be with me  
Save room for my love save a little  
Save a little for me  
Wont you save a little  
Save a little for me oh  
  
Save room for my love  
Save room for a moment to be with me  
Save room for my love  
Save a little save a little for me  
Wont you save a little  
Save a little for me
