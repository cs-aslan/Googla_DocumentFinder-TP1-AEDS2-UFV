She came all rightoned and shes all too tight in my neighborhood  
She cried both day and night  
I know it because it was there  
Its a milestone but shes down on her luck  
And she daily salooning but to me too hot to book  
I would then  
  
I believe where shed stop in if she wants time to care  
I believe that shed look upon beside him to care  
And I go by the Lord and where shes on my way but I dont belong there  
No I dont belong to her I dont belong to every choir  
Shes my prize forsaken angel but she dont hear me cry  
Shes a long hearted mystic and she cant carry on  
When Im there shes alright but when shes not when Im gone  
Heaven knows that the answers shes dont calling no one  
Shes the way for sailing beautiful  
Shes mine for the one  
And I lost her attention by tempation as it runs  
But she dont bother me  
But Im not there Im gone  
  
Now Ive cried tonight like I cried the night before  
And Im leased on the high some  
But I dream about the door  
Its so long shes forsaken by a fate with the tale  
It dont hang approximation  
She smiled Fare Thee Well  
  
Now when Ill treat the way we all was born to love her  
But she knows that the kingdom weighs so high above her  
And I run but I wait  
And its not too fast or slam  
But Ill not perceive her  
Im not there Im gone  
  
Well its all about division  
And I cry for a bail  
I dont need anybody now beside me to tell  
And its all affirmation I received but its not  
Shes a long haunting beauty  
But shes gone like the spark  
And shes gone  
  
Yes shes gone like the rainbow that shined in yesterday  
But now shes home beside me  
And Id like to hear to stay  
Shes a bone forsaking beauty and it dont trust anyone  
Now I wish I was beside her but Im not there Im gone  
  
Well its too hard to stake in  
And I dont far believe  
Its a bag full its amusing  
That shes hard too hard to lead  
Its a load its a crime  
The way she mauled me around  
Was she told for to hate me but just dont forethink in clown  
  
Yes I believe that its rightful  
Oh I believe it in my mind  
I been told like I said one night before  
Carry on the grind  
And this song gypsy told her like I said carry on  
I wish I was there to help her  
But Im not there Im gone
