ANGEL OF ORLEANS in me  
Ill tell you no lies  
Ravens have bore me wings to fly  
King of the night time forever  
Ill embrace my immortal  
Forever night  
One crimson kiss is bleeding  
Its all Im living for  
Bring me the nighttime forever  
Tales of the darkside here is all right  
Take me hand and Ill show ya  
My raven heart  
Raven  say you want me to  
Its all youre dying for  
Forever night  
Rain the dark on forever you  
Raven heart  
No there aint nothing dark that I wont do  
My raven heartll bleed all over you
