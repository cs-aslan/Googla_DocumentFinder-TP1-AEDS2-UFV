I stopped askin why  
Girl the wells gone dry  
Time to say the words Im sayin  
And hurtin you dont come easy  
  
God only knows  
Hurtin you dont come easy  
But I need to go  
Thought we had it once  
  
But what was once was once  
Time can change  
Both dreams and dreamers  
And hurtin you dont come easy  
  
God only knows  
Hurtin you dont come easy  
But I need to go  
I need to find what I aint found  
  
Ill may be lookin for it  
Til the last day Im alive  
Dont ask me what Ill do  
Dont ask me where Im bound  
  
I just know Im not alive  
Unless I can get up and try  
And hurtin you dont come easy  
God only knows  
  
Hurtin you dont come easy  
But I need to go  
Hurtin you dont come easy  
God only knows
