Theres a bench in every park dedicated to  
Those who sat there once but didnt make it through  
There are names carved deep in bark on every tree  
By those who spent their time like you and me  
And wherever geography may place you now  
Theres a piece of history all folk carry around  
Whatever your situation whatever it may allow  
Theres an even larger piece in every lost and found  
There is song theres always a song  
Wherever theres perfection theres a wrong  
Theres always song but a broken bond  
And an unkissed frog in every village pond  
Theres a name that we graffitid up on a wall  
To the folks who live there now makes no sense at all  
And in every underpass on every street  
A promise someone made but couldnt keep  
A tiny piece of chalk in every coat  
In every film the smallest lump in throat  
In every song youve sung in every novel read  
That unkissed love will rear rear its head  
There is song theres always song  
Wherever theres a right theres always wrong  
Theres always a song but a broken bond  
And an unkissed frog in every village pond
