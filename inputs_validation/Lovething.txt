It must have been the way that she kissed me  
Made me as weak as a lamb  
Tastes so fine like french silk pie  
Sweet as strawberry jam  
It could have been the thing that she told me  
When she threw her wrench at my monkey  
  
Should of been a cool scene  
Like honey on a ripped queen  
I thought it was a daydream  
But it must have been a love thing  
  
I smiled at the way that she told me  
I just cant turn you aloose  
She was a force majeure in her haute couture  
I was howlin at the moon  
Thats when I jumped out of her window  
Before my monkey could cook her goose  
  
Should of been a cool scene  
Like honey on a ripped queen  
I thought it was a daydream  
But it must have been a love thing
