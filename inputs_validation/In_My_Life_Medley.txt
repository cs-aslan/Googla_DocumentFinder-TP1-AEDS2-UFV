There are places I remember  
All my life  
Though some have changed  
Some forever not for better  
Some have gone  
And some remain  
Though I know Ill never ever lose affection  
For people and things that went before  
I know Ill often stop and think about them  
In my life  
I loved you more  
Though the music is sweet  
But the song aint complete  
Now in my life  
Boy in my life  
Somethin is missing  
Its a tune yes its true  
Still theres no me and you  
Here in my life  
Boy in my life  
Somethin is missing  
In my life  
There aint no melody oh no  
In my life  
There aint no harmony  
To help me sing a song  
Oh the music is sweet  
There are places I remember  
But the song aint complete  
Now in my life  
All my life  
Somethin is missing  
Though some have changed  
Its a tune yes its true  
Some forever not for better  
Still theres no me and you  
And some have gone  
Here in my life  
Somethin is missing  
And some remain  
In my life there aint no melody oh no  
All these places have their moments  
With lovers and friends  
I still can recall  
In my life there aint no harmony  
Some are dead and some are living  
To help me sing this song  
In my life  
I loved them all  
All I need is a cue  
Well Im waiting for you  
Here in my life  
But of all these friends and lovers  
Boy in my life  
There is no one compares with you  
You are the melody melody  
Cause in my life  
In my life  
I know Ill often stop and think about them  
You are the songac
