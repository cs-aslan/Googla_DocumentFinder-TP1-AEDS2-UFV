Noone seems to take up the chase and with the familiar faces fresh in his
mind he moves into a reconstruction of his old life above ground  Too much
time was one thing he didnt need so he used to cut through it with a little
speed He was better off dead than slow in the head His momma and poppa had
taken a ride on his back so he left very quickly to join The Pack  
  
I see faces and traces of home back in New York City   
So you think Im a tough kid Is that what you heard  
Well I like to see some action and it gets into my blood  
The call me the trail blazer  Rael  electric razor  
Im the pitcher in the chain gang we dont believe in pain  
Cause were only as strong yes were only as strong  
As the weakest link in the chain  
  
Only after a spell in Pontiac reformatory was he given any respect in the
gang  
  
Let me out of Pontiac when I was just seventeen  
I had to get it out of me if you know what I mean what I mean  
  
You say I must be crazy cause I dont care who I hit who I hit  
But I know its me thats hitting out and Im Im not full of shit  
I dont care who I hurt I dont care who I do wrong  
This is your mess Im stuck in I really dont belong  
When I take out my bottle filled up high with gasoline  
You can tell by the night fires where Rael has been has been  
  
Now walking back home after a raid he was cuddling a sleeping porcupine  
That night he pictured the removal of his hairy heart and to the accompaniment
of very romantic music he watched it being shaved smooth by an anonymous
stainless steel razor  
  
As I cuddled the porcupine  
He said I had none to blame but me  
Held my heart deep in hair  
Time to shave shave it off it off  
No time for romantic escape  
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape No  
Off we go  
  
Your sitting in your comfort you dont believe Im real  
You cannot buy protection from the way that I feel  
Your progressive hypocrites hand out their trash  
But it was mine in the first place so Ill burn it to ash  
And Ive tasted all the strongest meats  
And laid them down in coloured sheets laid them down in coloured  
Sheets  
Who needs illusion of love and affection  
When youre out walking the streets with your mainline connection  
Connection  
  
As I cuddled the porcupine  
He said I had none to blame but me  
Held my heart deep in hair  
Time to shave shave it off it off  
No time for romantic escape  
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape No
