I thought sometime alone  
Was what we really needed  
You said this time would hurt more than it helps  
But I couldnt see that  
I thought it was the end  
Of a beautiful story  
And so I left the one I loved at home to be alonealone  
And I tried to find  
Out if this one thing is true  
That Im nothing without you  
I know better now  
And Ive had a change of heart  
  
Id rather have bad times with you than good times with someone else  
Id rather be beside you in a storm than safe and warm by myself  
Id rather have hard times together than to have it easy apart  
Id rather have the one who holds my heart  
Whoooooooo yeah  
  
And then I met someone  
And thought she could replace you  
We got a long just fine  
We wasted time because she was not you  
We had a lot of fun  
Though we knew we were faking  
Love was not impressed with our connection they were all lies all lies  
So Im here cause I found this one thing is true  
That Im nothing without you  
I know better now  
And Ive had a change of heart  
  
Id rather have bad times with you than good times with someone else  
Id rather be beside you in a storm than safe and warm by myself  
Id rather have hard times together than to have it easy apart  
Id rather have the one who holds my heart  
Who holds my heart  
  
I cant blame you if you turn away from me like Ive done you  
I can only prove the things I say with time  
Please be mine  
  
Id rather have bad times withplease be mine you
