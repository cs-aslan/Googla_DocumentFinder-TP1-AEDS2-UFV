Dont close the door behind you  
You might wanna go through it someday  
Dont burn that bridge  
You might wanna cross it someday  
Your best friends today  
Could be your worst enemies to morrow  
Your worst enemies today  
Could be your best friends tomorrow  
Dont burn the bridge  
Dont cross the door  
Chorus  
And if you cant say something good about somebody  
Oh shut up  
And if you cant say something about somebody  
Just shut up  
Ungafakaz amanga ngomakhelwane wakho  
Ungakhulumi Indaba ezingafuni wena  
Vulumlomo wakho ufakipapa lakho  
Vulumlomo wakho ufakinyama yakho  
Ungakhulumindaba uxabanisabantu  
Uma uthanda futhi ufakamachips  
Amagwinya wona uwashiya nobani  
Dont say those words that will hurt people  
Dont do those things that will hurt people  
The things you say today  
Will come and haunt you tomorrow  
The things you do today  
Will come and haunt you tomorrow  
Do unto others as you would like them do unto you  
And if you cant say something good about somebody  
Oh shut up  
And if you cant say something good about somebody  
Just shut up  
Reap  
Ungafakazamanga  
Till fade
