I see people walking down the street  
Got their heads so high  
They cant see their feet  
With their blinders on  
They walk the endless mile  
Working for that perfect life of style  
  
But Im lookin for a better way  
Something in my life  
Nothing ever seems to satisfy  
I reach my hands out to the sky  
And Ill be climbing for the rest of my life  
  
Ill be climbing for the rest of my life  
Im still climbing oh yeah  
Ill be climbing for the rest of my life  
  
I hear people talkin all day long  
Got their minds made up  
They cant do no wrong  
With their hearts so cold  
They never ever feel  
Losing touch with everything thats real  
  
But Im lookin for a better way  
Something in my life  
Nothing ever seems to satisfy  
I reach my hands out to the sky  
And Ill be climbing for the rest of my life  
  
Ill be climbing for the rest of my life  
Im still climbing ooo yea  
Ill be climbing for the rest of my life  
  
Oh in the darkest hour  
Feel Im sinkin low  
But Ill reach higher  
  
Now Im lookin for a better way  
Something in my life  
Nothing ever seems to satisfy  
I reach my hands out to the sky  
And Ill be climbing  
Oh Im still climbing  
Oh yeah  
  
Ill be climbing for the rest of my life  
Im still climbing ooo yea  
Ill be climbing for the rest of my life  
  
Ill be climbing for the rest of my life  
Ill be climbing for the rest of my life  
Im still climbing  
Ill be climbing for the rest of my life  
Ill be climbing for the rest of my life
