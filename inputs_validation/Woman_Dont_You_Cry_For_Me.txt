Im gonna leave you here  
Im gonna leave you at the station  
Ive got a long way to go baby  
Woman dont you cry for me  
  
Now I cant take no more  
Now I dont need no complication  
Ive got a long way to go baby  
Woman dont you cry for me  
  
Theres no one place I want to be  
Attachment only hurts you  
Take care of yourself baby  
Cmon wont you let me be  
  
Theres just one thing I got to see  
Thats the Lord got to keep him in sight  
Take care of yourself baby  
Cmon wont you let me be  
  
Theres no one place I want to be  
Attachment only hurts you  
Better take care of yourself baby  
Cmon wont you try to see  
  
There is just one thing I got to see  
Thats the Lord got to keep him in sight  
Take care of yourself baby  
Cmon wont you let me be  
  
Now baby heres the door  
I dont need no aggravation  
Ive got a long way to go baby  
Woman dont you cry for me  
  
Im gonna leave you here  
Im gonna leave you at the station  
Ive got a long way to go baby  
Woman dont you cry for me  
  
Ive got a long way to go baby  
Woman dont you cry for me
