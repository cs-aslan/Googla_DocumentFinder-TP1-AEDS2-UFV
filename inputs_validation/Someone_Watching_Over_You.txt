Someone Watching Over You Lyrics  
Say that your not afraid  
Your just fine  
Got it all figured out this time  
All of the plans you made  
Will work out  
Deep inside you have your doubts  
But your clinging to your pride  
And you just dont know  
Your free to let it go  
Cause even when it rains outside  
There is light  
Even when you cry all night  
Your alright  
Even when you loose your way  
Youll get through  
Cause there is someone watching over you  
Say youve been hurt before your afraid  
That youll never love again  
And why should you take a chance just to fall  
But youd rather build a wall  
Than believe that you are loved  
Open up your heart  
Someone needs you as your are  
Ive been there  
At times I get scared  
Its true  
But I hold on to that  
I cant see  
Something inside of me  
And thats what give me strength to believe
