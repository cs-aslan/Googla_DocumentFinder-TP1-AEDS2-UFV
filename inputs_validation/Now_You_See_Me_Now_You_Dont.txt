You say youd really like to know me  
Why dont we meet and you will show me  
Heres the note you hope Ill read it  
Take your number if I need it  
Someone said its hard to find out  
What it is I think about  
Im good at smiles and easy phrases  
Dont look too close I dont like gazes  
Now you see me now you dont  
Understand me then you wont  
Im in vision Im on stage  
Im 17 I dont look my age  
I share a word you know I mean it  
You give a smile you know Ive seen it  
Across the rooms our eyes keep meeting  
Music is my special greeting  
Another night another town  
Its all so quick it spins me round  
Now you see me now you dont  
Understand me then you wont  
Im in vision Im on stage  
Im 17 I dont look my age
