Verse 1  
What happened here  
As the New York sunset disappeared  
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there  
Who lived here  
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot  
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop  
And now it all looks strange  
Its funny how one insect can damage so much grain  
  
Verse 2  
And whats it for  
This little empty garden by the brownstone door  
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more  
Who lived here  
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot  
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop  
And we are so amazed were crippled and were dazed  
A gardener like that one noone can replace  
  
Chorus  
And Ive been knocking but no one answers  
And Ive been knocking most all the day  
Oh and Ive been calling oh hey hey Johnny  
Cant you come out to play  
  
Verse 3  
And through their tears  
Some say he farmed his best in younger years  
But hed have said that roots grow stronger if only he could hear  
Who lived there  
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot  
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop  
Now we pray for rain and with every drop that falls  
We hear we hear your name  
  
Chorus  
And Ive been knocking but no one answers  
And Ive been knocking most all the day  
Oh and Ive been calling oh hey hey Johnny  
Cant you come out to play  
  
Chorus  
And Ive been knocking but no one answers  
And Ive been knocking most all the day  
Oh and Ive been calling oh hey hey Johnny  
Cant you come out cant you come out to play  
  
Outro  
Johnny cant you come out to play in your empty garden  
Johnny cant you come out to play in your empty garden  
Johnny cant you come out to play in your empty garden
