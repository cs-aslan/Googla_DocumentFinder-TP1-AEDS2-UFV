I think youre oh so beautiful  
I think youre so kind  
And I think I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
And I think of an apple core  
When you start thinking of God  
  
And I know I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
And I think youre so beautiful  
Beautiful as the blackened space and stars  
But all I see is a coreless seed  
When you cry for a God whos not there  
  
And I think youre so beautiful  
And I see youre as the sun  
That shines out through these galaxies  
Shimmering and warm ah  
  
And I think youre so beautiful oh oh oh oh  
And if theres one thing I believe at all  
Its how much I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
Its how much I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
Its how much I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
  
How much how much  
How much how much  
How much how much  
How much how much how how much  
If you disappear into the  
How much how much  
How much hey hey hey hey  
  
How much
