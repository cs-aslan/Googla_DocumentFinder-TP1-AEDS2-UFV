How can I convince you to stay  
Even though I hurt you  
I didnt mean to how can I begin to say  
Though all my words are fading  
Im begging you please dont go away  
  
Im softly saying sorry now  
Down on my knees begging you please  
Its the same old story somehow  
Trying the days dont turn your heart away  
Sorry if I love you begging just to hold you now  
  
You touch my innermost sensitivity  
If you right saying  
The things I keep denying  
Its hard to capture in love on the need to pay  
I wont stop loving  
Im begging you please dont go away  
  
Im softly saying sorry now  
Down on my knees begging you please  
Its the same old story somehow trying the days  
Dont turn your heart away  
Sorry if I love you  
Begging just to hold you now  
  
Down on my knees begging you please  
Its the same old story somehow counting the days  
Dont turn your heart away  
Sorry cause I love you  
Im begging just to hold you now
