Well a nickel is a nickel a dime is a dime  
I need a new man Lord I know I wont mind  
Tell me how long dear do I have to wait   
Can I get you now dear must I hesitate   
  
Well now the eagle on the dollar says In God we trust  
You say you wont obey me you want to see that dollar first  
How long dear do I have to wait   
Can I get you now dear mm must I hesitate   
  
Lord if the river was made of whiskey an I was a duck  
Id just swim to the bottom an Id never come up  
How long dear mm do I have to wait   
Why can I get you now dear mm must I hesitate   
  
Now theres rocks down in the ocean and theres fish in the sea  
I know you mean the whole world to me  
How long dear must I have to wait   
Can I get you now dear mm must I hesitate
