Young girls and porches are filling out  
Tempers and torches are burning  
Brown is the color of town  
Living in thunder  
  
Hair on my top lip now Im a man  
I so often hear and feel it  
Nice paying the price for being kept under  
  
Mama says dont hang around that front gate too long  
Boys like you who stay too late are surely gonna go so wrong  
But Mama theres safety in numbers  
Its the first time Ive ever felt strong  
Delaware Taggett and the Outlaw Boys  
Adding a laugh to the Broadway noise  
Slipping your mind where your mind dont want to go  
  
Offduty porters lay sleeping wives  
Onduty daughters are finding  
Why just touching a boy gives a thrill like a shiver  
  
Whispers and shadows are moving fast  
No prizes given to people  
Last drowned in the past down on the river
