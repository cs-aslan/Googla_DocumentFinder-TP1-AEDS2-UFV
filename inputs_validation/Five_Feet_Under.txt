Five feet under hes got one foot in the grave  
Would you look at him I think hes lost it  
I dont think that he can be saved  
  
Hes got a down payment on his tombstone  
Hes not alone his whole life has been out  
On a limb Just look at him watch  
Him get smashed and race bikes so fast  
Just dont laugh what will it say on his epitaph  
Here he lies may he rest in peace  
Hung on to life by the skin of his teeth  
Pushing his luck through the bottle he drinks  
  
Hes got a date with his maker and he  
Doesnt want to be late and make no mistake  
Hes a good friend so why might his life  
Have to end my friend I dont want to  
See you dead  
I dont want to see him dead  
I dont want to see him dead  
I dont want to see him dead
