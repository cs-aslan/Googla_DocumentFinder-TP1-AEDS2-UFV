Wake up in the morning and its hard to live  
Hard to live yes its hard to live  
And it will be a long time before shit starts to give  
And every single day its getting harder to give  
But God would be up for being down with a ho  
Lord knows that I got fuckin mic control  
Do you got the mic control  
You notice your style is well original  
  
This man makin money  
How I know  
It wont be no man of me  
In my bed I watch TV  
Im drunk by noon  
But thats OK  
Ill be president someday  
Light my cigarette and  
I think that Bert Susanka made me drink  
Load the box and then pump that shit  
Got my greatest hits  
Got my greatest hits  
  
Is this band makin money  
I dont know  
The writing on the wall  
All my friends drink alcohol  
Im too drunk to light the bong  
Im too stoned to write this song  
Light my cigarette and  
I think that Bert Susanka made me drink  
Load the box and then pump that shit  
Got my greatest hits  
  
Wake up in the morning and its hard to live  
Hard to live hard to live  
Its hard to live and it will be a long time  
Before shit starts to give  
And every single day its getting harder to give  
But God would be up for being down with a ho  
Lord knows that I got fuckin mic control  
Do you got mic control  
You notice your style is well original  
  
This man makin money how I know  
It wont be no man of me  
In my bed I watch TV Im drunk by noon  
But thats OK Ill be president someday  
Light my cigarette and  
I think that Bert Susanka made me drink  
Load the box and then pump that shit  
Its the Ziggens Greatest Hit  
The Ziggens Greatest Hit  
The Ziggens his Greatest Hit
