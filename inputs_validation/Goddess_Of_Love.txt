Goddess of love  
Goddess of love  
She never slows down  
And she cant get enough  
The goddess of love  
The goddess of love  
Shes holding her heart to the stars above  
  
She cant afford dreams  
And her clothes are old  
She cant afford hope  
Wouldnt be so bold  
But shes holding his heart  
And she wont let go again  
  
Shes a femme fatal  
Well thats what they say  
But she knows he couldnt love her  
Any other way  
Cause shes holding him now  
And she wont let go again  
Yes shes holding him now  
And she wont let go again

She never slows down  
And she cant get enough  
The goddess of love  
The goddess of love  
Shes holding her heart to the stars above  
  
She never slows down  
And she doesnt play straight  
Just cruising around in her own sweet way  
But shes taking her time  
And hes gonna get fooled again  
She learned about life  
Til she wished shew were dead  
So she treats that guy like a hole in the head  
Can you see him now  
Hell never get lucky again

Heart and soul  
  
Shes the goddess of love as she covers the gorund  
She looks just great and she never slows down  
And shes holding his heart and she wont let go again  
Yes shes holding his heart and she wont let go again  
Oh shes holding his heart and she wont let go again  
Yes shes holding his heart and she wont let go again  
  
Oh shes holding his heart and she wont let go again
