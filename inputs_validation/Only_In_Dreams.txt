You cant resist her  
Shes in your bones  
Shes in your marrow  
And your ride home  
You cant avoid her  
Shes in the air  
In between molecules  
Of oxygen and carbon dioxide  
  
Only in dreams  
We see what it means  
Reach out our hands  
Hold on to hers  
But when we wake  
Its all been erased  
And so it seems  
Only in dreams  
  
You walk up to her  
Ask her to dance  
She says hey baby  
I just might take the chance  
You say Its a good thing  
That you float in the air  
That way theres no way  
I will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces  
  
Only in dreams  
We see what it means  
Reach out our hands  
Hold on to hers  
But when we wake  
Its all been erased  
And so it seems  
Only in dreams
