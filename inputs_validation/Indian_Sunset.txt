As I awoke this evening with the smell of wood smoke clinging  
Like a gentle cobweb hanging upon a painted tepee  
Oh I went to see my chieftain with my warlance and my woman  
For he told us that the yellow moon would very soon be leaving  
This I cant believe I said I cant believe our warlords dead  
Oh he would not leave the chosen ones to the buzzards and the soldiers guns  
  
Oh great father of the Iroquois ever since I was young  
Ive read the writing of the smoke and breast fed on the sound of drums  
Ive learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild  
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux to make a chieftains daughter mine  
  
And now you ask that I should watch  
The red mans race be slowly crushed  
What kind of words are these to hear  
From Yellow Dog whom white man fears  
  
I take only what is mine Lord my pony my squaw and my child  
I cant stay to see you die along with my tribes pride  
I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons  
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run  
  
Trampling down the prairie rose leaving hoof tracks in the sand  
Those who wish to follow me I welcome with my hands  
I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead  
Hed been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead  
  
Now there seems no reason why I should carry on  
In this land that once was my land I cant find a home  
Its lonely and its quiet and the horse soldiers are coming  
And I think its time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running  
For soon Ill find the yellow moon along with my loved ones  
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields without the sound of guns  
  
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold  
And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet hole
