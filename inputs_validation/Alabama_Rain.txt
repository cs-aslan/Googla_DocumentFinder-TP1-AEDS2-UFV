Lazy days in midJuly  
Country Sunday mornins  
Dusty haze on summer highways  
Sweet magnolia callin  
  
Chorus  
But now and then I find myself  
Thinkin of the days  
That when we were walking in  
The Alabama rain  
  
Drivein movies Friday nights  
Drinkin beer and laughin  
Somehow things were always right  
I just dont know what happened  
  
Chorus  
  
We were only kids  
But then Ive never heard it said  
That kids cant fall in love  
And feel the same  
I can still remember the first time  
I told you I love you  
  
On a dusty midJuly  
Country summers evenins  
Weepin willows sang its lullaby  
And shared our secret  
  
Chorus  
  
Walking in the Alabama rain
