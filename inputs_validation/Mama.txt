Mama just had to call oh mama  
Your baby boy just had his heart  
Broken in two she said were through  
But to send her best to you  
Oh mama Id like to run to you mama  
Id come home today leave right away  
But things wont work that way  
Gotta stay and be a man  
If I can oh mama  
  
No mom I dont know I called her tonight  
No not at home yeah youre probably right  
Yes Ill take care of myself No Ill be alright  
Ill go to bed early tonight  
Oh mama tell dad I think of him mama  
Hows uncle Joe my puppy gogo  
Tell them hello oh Id better go  
But good gosh I loved her so  
  
Oh mama dont worry so much darling mama  
Now mama dont cry just say goodbye  
Cant have us both in tears well mom you know me  
Yes Ill always be your baby through all the years
