I will run and not be weak  
Hope has come  
Renewed my strength  
I have found what I did seek  
And Im ready to fly  
  
All forgiven all forgot  
Heaven waits beyond the plot  
Swing low sweet chariot  
Yes Im ready to fly  
  
Father come to save my soul  
Father come to  
Make me whole  
There was a price  
He paid the toll  
Gave me freedom to fly  
  
And every battle every war  
You will be my shield and my sword  
You know Im waiting on You Lord  
You give me freedom to fly  
  
Watch the eagles fly  
Gonna set your feet on high  
On the wind like a dove  
Go on and fly  
In the shadow of love  
  
Fly gonna fly  
  
Yes Im watching you fly  
He set your feet on high  
On the wind like a dove  
Go on and fly  
In the shadow of love
