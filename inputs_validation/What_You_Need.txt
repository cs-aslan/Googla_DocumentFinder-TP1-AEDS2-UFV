I just wanna take you there  
He dont got to go away  
Does he touch you here like this  
Let me take the friction from your lips  
  
And Ima love you girl  
The way you need  
Aint no one goin stop us  
Aint no one goin stop us  
And Ima give you girl what you fiend  
Im the drug in your veins  
Just fight through the pain  
  
Hes what you want  
Hes what you want  
Hes what you want  
Hes what you want  
Im what you need what you need what you need what you need  
Im what you need what you need what you need what you need

I do everything he does times three  
And he dont gotta know I got you on the floor  
Doing things you never thought youd do  
Baby leave them high heel shoes  
Cause I love it when youre lookin down at me  
Im lookin up at you  
And I dont give a damn shorty watch me knock them boots off  
  
And Ima love you girl  
The way you need  
Aint no one goin stop us  
Aint no one goin stop us  
And Ima give you girl what you fiend  
Im the drug in your veins  
Just fight through the pain
