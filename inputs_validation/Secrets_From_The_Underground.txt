Feel the way it goes when the words have left the mark  
With the promise of tomorrow  
That tricks and leaves you in the dark  
Theres something in the air  
And theres something rising up  
Not one but a million that have had enough  
  
Chorus  
Heyyo no  
Im not good at going away  
I got something more to say  
Kickin screaming it knocks you down it knocks you down  
Hey yo go underneath well tear you down  
Secrets from the underground  
Aint gonna stop so far  
  
This is not an anthem  
Or a threat in someones name  
But a promise that tomorrow  
Will rock and burn and things wont change  
Theres something in the air  
Theres something rising up  
Not one but a million that have had enough  
  
Chorus  
  
Underneath well tear you down  
Oh oh oh secrets from the underground  
  
Hey no no  
Im not good at going away  
I got something more to say  
Kickin screaming it knocks you down it knocks you down  
Hey yo go underneath well tear you down  
Secrets from the underground  
Aint gonna stop so far  
Hey yo go  
Hey yo go  
Secrets from the underground  
Aint gonna stop so far
