Look at your heart ache as you try tell me  
The love we made was not enough for you  
Youre walking away from all that we dreamed of  
The things you say are leading to  
  
Goodbye goodbye  
You made you mind up but your heart cant say it  
Goodbye goodbye  
Say anything but darling dont say goodbye  
  
You wait at the door and turn round to see me  
The look into your eyes says you really want to stay  
And then we touch your hands are a whisper  
They tell my heart that you cant say  
  
Goodbye goodbye  
You made your mind up but your heart cant say it  
Goodbye goodbye  
Say anything but darling dont say goodbye  
  
Oh baby with or without you  
Ill always love what we both knew  
  
Goodbye goodbye  
You made your mind up but your heart cant say it  
Goodbye goodbye  
Say anything but darling dont say goodbye  
  
Dont say goobye  
Baby lets talk about love  
Lets talk about it now  
Please baby dont say  
Baby lets talk about love  
Without your love I cant go on without you  
Baby dont say  
Baby lets talk about love
