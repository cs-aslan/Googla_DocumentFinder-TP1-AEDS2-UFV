Got those highway blues cant you hear my motor runnin  
Flyin down the road with my foot on the floor  
All the way in town they can hear me comin  
Fords about to drop she wont do no more  
And i smell my motor burnin  
Underneath the hood is smoke  
Cant stop and i cant stop  
Got to keep on movin or ill lose my mind  
  
Oh rockin down the highway  
Oh rockin down the highway  
Oh rockin down the highway  
Oh rockin down the highway  
  
The highway patrol got his eyes on me  
I know what hes thinkin and it aint good  
Im movin so fast he can barely see me  
Gonna lose that man i know i should  
I gotta kick in my pedal  
Make my ford move a little bit faster  
Cant stop and i cant stop  
Got to keep on movin or ill lose my mind  
  
Oh rockin down the highway  
Oh rockin down the highway  
Oh rockin down the highway  
Oh rockin down the highway
