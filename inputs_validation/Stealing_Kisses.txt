Its late enough  
All your kids should be home  
The policeman says  
As he takes your beer for his own  
  
You remember  
Wondering what his wife thought  
About his occupation  
He knows that you were just chasing a dream  
  
To the town line and back and over again  
So he winks at your girls  
And tells you all Ill see you later  
  
I was stealing kisses from a boy  
Now Im begging affection from a man  
In my house dress  
Dont you know who I am  
Dont you know who I am  
Standing in your kitchen  
  
Its late enough  
Your husbands dinner is cold  
So you wrap it up and leave it for him on the stove  
Its probably the traffic again  
  
Another important meeting  
You havent talked to an adult all day  
Except for your neighbor who drives you crazy  
When he finally gets in  
Hes sure not in the mood for talkin  
  
I was stealing kisses from a boy  
Now Im begging affection from a man  
In my house dress  
Dont you know who I am  
Dont you know who I am  
Im standing in your kitchen  
  
And hours become days  
Days become years  
And you could burn down this town  
If they made matches from fear  
Cause youre no worse off than anybody else  
Hey dont you even know  
Dont you even know yourself  
  
So youre standing outside your high school doors  
The ones you walked through twenty years before  
And you whisper to all the girls  
Run run oh run  
  
I was stealing kisses from a boy  
Now Im begging affection from a man  
In my house dress  
Dont you know who I am  
Dont you know who I am  
Take a look at who I am  
Take a look at who I am  
Im stealing kisses  
Stealing kisses
