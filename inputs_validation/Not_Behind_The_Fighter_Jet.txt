Militant babies came to me  
And tole me dont be afraid to try  
Phenomenal stuntkids in the street  
Popping out of the black ghost pie it pleases the chef  
Fearless onescracked up jack and jill  
Theyre down there in the bunker still  
You look like a sniper anyway  
Im not behind the fighter jet  
Id much rather back a simple girl  
Ive seen your plan and its all wet  
A noseload of prophecies coming to me  
Caught in the trap where bravery steps  
A wounded mercenary bleeds  
In the hall of fantastically fine things  
Where the path of glory leads  
Lately I think its grown too hard  
Coming up with the winning card  
But whos gonna beat them in their own backyard  
a motion to remove the entire staff  
Dont forget the double crossing crew
