I might be too strung out on compliments  
Overdosed on confidence  
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence  
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments  
Faded way too long Im floating in and out of consciousness  
And they sayin Im back Id agree with that  
I just take my time with all this shit I still believe in that  
I had someone tell me I fell off oh I needed that  
And they wanna see me pick back up well whered I leave it at  
I know I exaggerated things now I got it like that  
Tuck my napkin in my shirt cause Im just mobbin like that  
You know good and well that you dont want a problem like that  
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that  
No dont do it please dont do it cause one of us goes in  
And we all go through it  
Drizzy got the money so Drizzy gonna pay it  
Those my brothers I aint even gotta say it  
Thats just something they know  
  
Chorus  
They know they know they know  
They know they know they know  
They know they know they know  
Yeah they know yeah  
That the real is on the rise  
Fuck them other guys  
I even gave them a chance to decide  
Now its something they know  
They know they know they know  
  
Yeah I be yelling out money over everything money on my mind  
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty  
Tell her I apologize it happened over time  
She says they missed the old Drake girl dont tempt me  
If they dont get it theyll be over you  
That new shit that you got is overdue  
You better do what you suppose to do  
Im like why I gotta be all that but still I cant deny the fact that its
true  
Listen to you expressing all them feelings  
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children  
And thats who you thinking is bout to come and make a killing  
I guess it really is just me myself and all my millions  
You know the game even got it like that  
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that  
Cause I live for this it isnt just a hobby like that  
When they get my shit and play it I aint even gotta say it they know  
  
Chorus  
  
I be yelling out money over everything money on my mind mind mind mind  
Tell em I apologize it happened over time time time time  
They know
