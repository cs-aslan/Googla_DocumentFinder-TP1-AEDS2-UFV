Ok I just want to warn you that when I wrote this song I was listening to the
Cure a lot  
  
You dont know how much I need you  
While youre around I dont feel blue  
And when we kiss I know that you need me too  
I cant believe I found a love thats so pure and true  
  
But it all was bullshit  
It was a goddamn joke  
And when I think of you and I  
I hope you fucking choke  
  
I hope youre glad with what youve done to me  
I lay in bed all day long feeling melancholy  
You left me here all alone tears running constantly  
  
Oh somebody kill me please  
Somebody kill me pleease  
Im on my knees  
pretty pretty please kill me  
  
I want to die  
Put a bullet in my head  
  
Youre going to the mental institution
