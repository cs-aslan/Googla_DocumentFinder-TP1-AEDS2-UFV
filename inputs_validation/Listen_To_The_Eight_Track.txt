mick Ive got a  
There must be one million stories in new york city the naked city and this
is one of em  
I live out on the island and I got problems  
My mom dont like me cause she says I know sultan   
Sitting in the cark park in my old buick skylark  
Getting high getting high  
Getting high on the eight track  
Oh listen to the eight track  
Oh listen to the eight track  
Oh listen to the eight track  
Oh listen to the eight track  
Oh it aint easy when you gotta survive  
Keep on giving death just to survive  
Oh get out into the car park sitting in my own buick skylark in the dark  
Oh n Ill listen to the eight track  
Oh Ill listen to the eight track  
Oh listen to the eight track  
Oh listen to the eight track  
Yeah cant wind it back  
Listen to the eight track  
In between the seats in the cracks  
Listen to the eight track  
Oh sometimes I get a woman in here  
And I put on bruce springsteens new double album  
And then just when everythings getting hot  
I start turning the volume right down low  
Baby let me snuggle right next to you  
You turned to me sweetly you know what she said  
She said turn up the eight track  
Oh listen to the eight track  
Oh listen to the eight track aint no winding it back  
Listen to the eight track  
Listen to the eight track  
Listen to the eight track  
There must have been about a million stories in new york city the naked city
and this has been one of them
