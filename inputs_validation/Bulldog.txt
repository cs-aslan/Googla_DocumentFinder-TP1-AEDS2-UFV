Hey now bulldog  
Dont you rush in  
With your eyes wild  
Hey there big bear  
Take a moment  
To decide  
All these angels together  
Walk the wire line  
Scarecrow angels  
Says the bulldog  
With a smile  
They catch you in a corner  
Shut your eyes  
They come at you at night  
They catch you in a corner  
Shut your eyes  
They come at you at night  
One less bell to warn you  
One more chance to say goodbye  
I dont I dont I dont think  
I understand you  
Dont really think I do  
I dont I dont I dont  
 Think I understand you  
Dont really think I do  
Hey Louise whats the barrier  
Between love and need  
How far is it from love underneath  
What are you supposed to mean to me  
What do you mean to me  
They catch you in a corner shut your eyes  
They come at you at night  
They catch you in a corner  
Shut your eyes  
They come at you at night  
One less bell to warn ya one more song to play  
Im going back to california  
Your gonna get your chance to say goodbye  
Hey mathew is anybody mean to you  
And dont you harbor points of view  
Secretly belive in your doom  
I dont think I understand you  
I dont really think I do  
I dont think I understand you  
I dont really think I do  
Well ya got One less bell to warn ya  
One more song to play  
Im going back to California  
Gonna get your chance to say goodbye  
One less bell to warn ya one more chance to say goodbye
