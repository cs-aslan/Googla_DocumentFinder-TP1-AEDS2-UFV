Money aint nothing but money  
When you get to the money aint nothing but money  
Love aint nothing but love when you learn to love aint nothing but love  
Party aint nothing but a party when you party everyday aint nothing but a
party  
  
Love money party love money party  
Love money party love money party  
We want love money party  
  
If I cant trust then why am I giving my heart  
In exchange for him to love me  
Cause there aint much difference  
In a one night stand then one that aint for me  
Giving too much cause you hate that you love  
Everything that he do and you cant deny you want him  
So what light a fire underneath this bitch and blow  
  
Money aint nothing money cant buy you love  
I dont give a damn if hes sitting on a crib  
Money aint nothing what about the real and the way you build  
Money get low and the DJ stop and the music slow down and the shit gets blurry  
  
Love money party  
Money aint nothing but money  
When you get to the money aint nothing but money  
Love aint nothing but love when you learn to love aint nothing but love  
Party aint nothing but a party when you party everyday aint nothing but a
party  
  
Love money party love money party  
Love money party love money party  
We want love money party  
  
Ive been through heartbreaks heartbreaks  
Much for anybody with a human heart to take  
You know its something that you care to elaborate  
But Ive been left with the live bait  
I done messed with the fire I met a girl on the side  
I done leave it all on the line  
  
Money aint nothing money cant buy you love  
I dont give a damn if hes sitting on a crib  
Money aint nothing what about the real and the way you build  
Money get low and the DJ stop and the music slow down and the shit gets blurry  
  
Love money party  
Money aint nothing but money  
When you get to the money aint nothing but money  
Love aint nothing but love when you learn to love aint nothing but love  
Party aint nothing but a party when you party everyday aint nothing but a
party
