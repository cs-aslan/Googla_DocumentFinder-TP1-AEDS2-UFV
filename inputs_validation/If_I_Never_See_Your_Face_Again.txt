Now as the summer fades I let you slip away  
You say Im not your type but I can make you sway  
It makes you burn to learn youre not the only one  
Id let you be if you put down your blazing gun  
  
Now youve gone somewhere else far away  
I dont know if I will find you find you find you  
But you feel my breath on your neck  
Cant believe Im right behind you right behind you  
  
Cause you keep me coming back for more  
And I feel a little better than I did before  
And if I never see your face again I dont mind  
Cause we gone much further than I thought wed get tonight  
  
Sometimes you move so well  
Its hard not to give in  
  
Im lost I cant tell  
Where you end and I begin  
  
It makes you burn to learn  
Im with another man  
  
I wonder if hes half  
The lover that I am  
  
Now youve gone somewhere else Far away  
I dont know if I will find you find you find you  
But you feel my breath On your neck  
Cant believe Im right behind you right behind you  
  
Cause you keep me coming back for more  
And I feel a little better than I did before  
And if I never see your face again I dont mind  
Cause we gone much further than I thought wed get tonight  
  
Baby baby please believe me  
Find it in your heart to reach me  
Promise not to leave me behind  
Promise not to leave me behind  
  
Take me down but take it easy  
Make me think but dont deceive me  
Torture me by taking your time  
Talk to me talk to me  
  
Cause you keep me coming back for more  
And I feel a little better than I did before  
  
And if I never see your face again I dont mind  
Cause we gone much further than I thought wed get tonight  
  
Cause you keep me coming back for more  
And I feel a little better than I did before  
And if I never see your face again I dont mind  
Cause we gone much further than I thought wed get tonight
