Im a punk get off my ass  
Because Im fucking working class  
I get up everyday and go to work  
Im treated like a fucking jerk  
They suck my money every week  
Now my futures looking bleak  
They say the moneys almost gone  
But what will I do when my time comes  
  
Hey hey hey  
  
Blue collar job you and I  
Kiss your hardearned dough goodbye  
Soon youll be old youll be gray  
And how will you earn your pay  
For over 40 years you broke your back  
But they gave your money to some bum on crack  
They say we wont get it  
But fucking the governments leeches are still money sucking  
  
Hey hey hey  
  
Did you hear what they want to do to you and me  
They want to take away our social security
