In the heat of the Indian summer  
Out along the Appalachian way  
You can hear the sound of the overnight angels  
As they pray  
Charged by the light of some mariners lantern  
Spitting out a cold but triangular spray  
Cant you hear the screams of the overnight angels  
As they play  
  
Talking to the spirits through a silver curtain  
Reaching out beyond the length of the light  
You can catch a glimpse of an overnight angel  
As he shines  
Dancing through the toys of the dead and the living  
Laughing at the poets changing their rhymes  
Cant you feel the pulse of the overnight angels  
Beating time  
  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
Were talking bout the overnight angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
Were talking bout the overnight angels angels angels  
  
Children of the junkies led the revolution  
Push yourselves over get yourselves there  
Someone throw their arms round the overnight angels  
Cause they care  
Angels dont need no phony religion  
Throw them out along with the ethnic nowheres  
They will never speak to the overnight angels  
They can only stare  
  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
Were talking bout the overnight angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
Were talking bout the overnight angels angels angels angels  
  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
Were talking bout the Overnight Angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
Were talking bout the Overnight Angels Angels Angels Angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
Were talking bout the Overnight Angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
Were talking bout the Overnight Angels Angels Angels Angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
Were talking bout the Overnight Angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
Were talking bout the Overnight Angels Angels Angels Angels
