Didnt sleep a wink last night  
Cause you walked out the night before  
Just been sittin here rottin hoping youd come knockin  
Knocking at my door  
  
Watched the moon pass by my window  
The stars faded out of sight  
The sun came into view an still I thought of you  
An I didnt sleep a wink last night  
  
Tryin to remember what Id done  
To make you treat me so  
What have I been guilty of  
Well Id just like to know  
  
Thought if we could talk it over  
Maybe I could make things right  
Cause until Im forgiven Im exisitin Im not livin  
An I didnt sleep a wink last night  
I didnt sleep a wink last night
