A mansion on a hill is a lovely sight to see  
But like any other house its only temporary  
Home is anywhere you choose to put your heart  
If theres no love inside itll soon fall apart  
  
Ashes to ashes dust into dust  
Buildings will crumble bridges will rust  
Mountains will disappear rivers will dry on  
And so it goes with everything but love  
So it goes everything but love so it goes  
  
You can drive around in a long limousine  
If you dont know where youre going you dont mean a thing  
He would walk a mile just to hold an empty hand  
He knows what it means to be a wealthy man  
  
Ashes to ashes dust into dust  
Colossus will crumble bridges will rust  
Mountains will disappear rivers will dry on  
And so it goes with everything but love  
So it goes everything but love so it goes  
  
Worldly treasures will all pass away  
Theres just one things put here to stay  
  
Ashes to ashes dust into dust  
Kingdoms will crumble bridges will rust  
Mountains will disappear rivers will dry on  
And so it goes with everything but love  
So it goes everything but love  
So it goes everything but love  
So it goes everything but love
