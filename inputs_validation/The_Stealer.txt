Words and music by fraser and rogers  
  
I went down to the center of town  
  
Beneath my feet was the burning ground  
  
Just stood on the corner as sexy as could be  
  
Said hey good looking walk away with me  
  
I said yeah Im your stealer  
  
Come to steal your love  
  
  
  
Sun was shining the world was bright  
  
I said tell me darling where you gonna be tonight   
  
goin around the corner where the musics loud  
  
Im tired of the city gonna cat me around  
  
And I said yeah Im your stealer  
  
I come to steal your love  
  
I come to  
  
I come to steal  
  
  
  
Goin around the corner where the musics loud  
  
Im tired of the city gonna cat me around  
  
And I said yeah Im your stealer  
  
I come to steal your love
