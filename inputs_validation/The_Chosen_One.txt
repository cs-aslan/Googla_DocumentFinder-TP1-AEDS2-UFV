I was your first and you were my last  
And we are the journeys end  
I was the blues and you were my sunshine friend  
  
Now Im your lover you are my cover  
Keeping the loneliness from me  
You are my chosen one arise and be the one  
The chosen one  
  
You are the sea and I am the sailor  
Riding the perfect wave  
I couldve drowned but you came around and save me  
She wont play your game  
  
Now Im your hopes and you are my dreamer  
Helping me see beyond tomorrow  
You are the chosen one youll always be the one  
The chosen one  
  
Out of the darkness out of the shadow  
Oh wherever you go Ill follow along  
Wherever you lead me wherever you need me  
Ill bring you my message Ill bring you my song  
  
You are the chosen one arise and be the one  
The chosen one  
  
Darlin I choose you Ill never use you  
I couldnt abuse you with all that youve done  
You are my sunshine you are my lifeline  
Forever my sweet wine forever the one
