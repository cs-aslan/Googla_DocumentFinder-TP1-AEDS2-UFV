Icy steel shooting through concrete cool city  
Mountains of glass reflect the sky  
Everybody feels real good in cool city  
Each day brings a new surprise  
Johnny came twothousand miles to the cool city  
He came to see what makes things tick  
He cut his hair and bought new clothes in the cool city  
Finally found his lifes ambition  
  
How to do nothing perfectly  
To do it with style so gracefully  
Cause life is so delicious in Cool City  
  
Outside no ones on the street  
Dont stop or youll miss a beat  
  
Someones standing in a doorway  cool city  
You open the door and check him out so casually  
The musics blasting all night long in cool city  
They recognize his face so its all right  
This one knew the right address  
He even knew someone in a band  
While the others wait all night standing there in  
Cool city  
  
So hard to make the right friends  
You might have to sell some skin  
The nights go on forever  
  
The blacks they all hate the whites  
The whites think theyre tough but theyre not cool city  
The boys go out with each other  
The girls who will be in movies  
  
If youre high youre in the right place cool city  
Animals seek out their own kind  
Shake some hands and take a lunch in cool city  
Someones going to try and tempt you  
Listen to all the brilliant plans in the cool city  
Its all free now but youll pay later with your soul  
Pray to the the objects on the wall  
That youll stay young and never grow old  
So come on the waters fine  
Have a drink snort a line  
Cause the nights get very chilly here in cool city
