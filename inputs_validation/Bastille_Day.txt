Theres no bread let them eat cake  
Theres no end to what theyll take  
Flaunt the fruits of noble birth  
Wash the salt into the earth  
  
But theyre marching to Bastille Day La guillotine will claim  
Her bloody prize Free the dungeons of the innocent The king  
Will kneel and let his kingdom rise  
  
Bloodstained velvet dirty lace  
Naked fear on every face  
See them bow their heads to die  
As we would bow as they rode by  
  
And were marching to Bastille Day La guillotine will claim  
Her bloody prize Sing o choirs of cacophony The king has  
Kneeled to let his kingdom rise  
  
Lessons taught but never learned  
All around us anger burns  
Guide the future by the past  
Long ago the mould was cast  
  
For they marched up to Bastille Day La guillotine  claimed  
Her bloody prize Hear the echoes of the centuries Power isnt  
All that money buys
