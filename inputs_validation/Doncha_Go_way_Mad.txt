I must confess what you say is true  
I had a rendezvous with somebody new  
Thats the only one I ever had  
Baby baby doncha go away mad  
  
Cheatin shows and it never goes  
You got a reason to be mad I suppose  
But she only was a passin fad  
Baby dont you be mad  
  
Her kinds a dime a dozen  
And thats not the kind I want  
Whod ever dream your cousin  
Would wander into that restaurant  
  
I understand that you feel upset  
What do you say that you forgive and forget  
Come on and kiss me just to show youre glad  
Baby baby doncha go away mad  
  
Now her kinds a dime a dozen  
I shouldve passed her by  
Whod ever dream your cousin  
Would come along and give us the eye  
  
I understand that you feel upset  
What do you say that you forgive and forget  
Come on and kiss me just to show youre glad  
Baby doncha go away mad  
  
Understand that youre quite upset  
What do you say that you forgive and forget  
Come on and kiss me just to show youre glad  
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby doncha go way mad  
Now doncha go away mad
