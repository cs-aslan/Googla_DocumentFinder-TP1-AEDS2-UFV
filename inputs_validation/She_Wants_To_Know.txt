She wants to know which way the wind blows  
And which way to go Im never gonna tell her  
And she wants to know why Im been hiding myself out on the road alone  
Where no one knows my number  
She wants to know why I cant take it slow  
And why I cant settle down but Im never gonna burn out  
She wants to know why Ive been lyin to myself  playing a losers game  
Fightin a losin battle  
Far away thats where Ill be  
Shine a light down hard on me  
She wants to know which way the wind blows  
And which way to go Im never gonna tell her  
And she wants to know why Im been hiding myself out on the road alone  
Where no one knows my number  
Far away thats where Ill be  
Shine a light down hard on me  
Down hard on me  
Down hard on me
