What do you want to hear when were making love  
What do you want to hear when were making love  
Can I take you from behind and hold you in my arms  
What do you want to hear when were making love  
  
Can I take you from behind and feel you in my heart  
What do we need to relive to bring us close  
Why dont you do it to me  
Why dont you do those things to me  
  
Why dont you do it to me  
Why dont you do those things to me  
Four fall in a bed three giving head one getting wet  
Four fall in a bed three giving head one getting wet  
  
What do you want to hear when were making love  
Can I hold you from behind and tell you that its me  
Why dont you do it to me  
Why dont you do those things to me  
  
Why dont you do it to me  
Why dont you do those things to me  
The love drug is a bug that cuts us both up  
Why dont you do those things to me  
  
Why dont you do it of me why dont you do those things to me  
What can I say to you when were making love  
I could take you from behind and make you live  
What do you need me to say when were making love  
  
I can take you from behind and then Ill forgive  
Why dont you do it to me  
Why dont you do those things to me  
Why dont you do it to me  
Why dont you do those things to me
