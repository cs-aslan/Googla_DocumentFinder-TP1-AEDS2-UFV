Indiscriminate Id rather be elite  
Ill choose my own shit scene  
Unsubstantiated rumors flown are true  
Im here for me not you  
  
Non conglomerate I mean what I say  
Im not your fucking scape  
Goat apparently Ive alienated some  
It seems my jobs half done  
  
Youll never understand it  
Try to buy and brand it  
I win you lose cause its my job  
To keep punk rock elite  
  
This music aint your fuckin industry
