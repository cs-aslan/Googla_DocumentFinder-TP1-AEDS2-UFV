Here we are just goin through the motions one more time  
You look into my eyes but you dont see me  
Here I am feelin like a stranger in your arms  
I touch you I hold you but lately I dont know you  
  
Something is wrong but we go on from day to day  
And we just pretend it all away  
We act like nothings changed  
But in our hearts we know its not the same  
  
Chorus  
Cause were not makin love anymore  
Baby were not makin love like before  
We may hold each other tight  
Say that everythings alright  
But were not makin love  
  
Remember when you couldnt wait to run into my arms  
When the love inside my heart was all you needed  
Remember when you made me wish the night would never end  
The fire the thunder we lived to love each other  
  
If ever two hearts were one then it was your and mine  
But that was another place in time  
Now all we have to show  
Are memories of a dream we used to know  
  
Chorus  
  
When did we lose our way we had it all  
Dont know how it all just slipped away  
But oh can we get it back again  
Is it too late can we try just one time Cause darling  
  
Chorus  
  
Were not makin love anymore  
Baby were not makin love like before  
Can we find a way to try  
Find the magic one more time  
Cause were not makin love
