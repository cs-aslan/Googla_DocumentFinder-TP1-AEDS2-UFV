Here comes the doo doo flying up the street  
Running like the fire burning on his feet  
Casting his eye left to the right  
Looking for a place he can duck out of sight

Looking for somebody to fill up the load  
A big fat cat he had get off the bag  
Scooping up the striker lest given him a whack
