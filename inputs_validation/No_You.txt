Feeling so crazy lately  
When it seems that Youre not around  
The sun and the moon shine bright  
But my eyes are all Yours now  
Dont know how I lived with out You  
I dont remember how it used to feel  
Lord I cant imagine if I had no You to hold me  
  
Chorus  
Where would I go with no You to run to  
No You to hold me when I am afraid  
Who would I be with no You beside me  
I ought to know it by now without You theres no me  
Oh theres no me  
  
Lord when I need You Youre always here  
To play through the laughter love through the tears  
And when my heart seems so far away  
Into Your arms is where I wanna stay  
I try to find the words to tell You  
All the things my hearts been telling me  
I dont wanna know how it feels to have no You to love me  
  
Chorus  
  
Where would I go with no You to run to  
No You to hold me when I am afraid  
Where would I be with no You beside me  
I ought to know it by now without you  
  
Chorus
