Breathe you out  
Breathe you in  
You keep coming back to tell me  
Youre the one who could have been  
And my eyes see it all so clear  
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears  
I try to put it in the past  
Hold on to myself and dont look back  
  
Chorus  
I dont wanna dream about  
All the things that never were  
Maybe I can live without  
When Im out from under  
I dont wanna feel the pain  
What good would it do me now  
Ill get it all figured out  
When Im out from under  
From under from under from under from under  
  
So let me go  
Just let me fly away  
Let me feel the space between us growing deeper  
And much darker every day  
Watch me now and Ill be someone new  
My heart will be unbroken  
It will open up for everyone but you  
Even when I cross the line  
Its like a lie Ive told a thousand times  
  
Chorus  
  
And part of me still believes  
When you say youre gonna stick around  
And part of me still believes  
We can find a way to work it out  
But I know that we tried everything we could try  
So lets just say goodbye  
Forever  
  
Chorus x2  
  
From under from under from under from under
