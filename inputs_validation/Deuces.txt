All the bullshits for the birds  
You aint nothin but a vulture  
Always hopin for the worst  
Waiting for me to fuck up  
Youll regret the day when I find another girl yeah  
Who knows just what I need she knows just what I mean  
When I tell her keep it drama free  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh chuchuckin up the deuces  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
I told you that Im leaving deuces  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
I know you mad but so what  
I wish you best of luck  
And now Im bout to throw them deuces up  
  
Chorus  
Im on some new shit  
Im chuckin my deuces up to her deuces  
Im moving on to something better better better  
No more tryin to make it work  
You made me wanna say bye bye  
say bye bye say bye bye to her  
You made me wanna say bye bye  
say bye bye say bye bye to her  
  
Uh use to be valentines  
Together all the time  
Thought it was true love but you know women lie  
Its like I sent my love with a text two times  
Call cause I care but I aint gettin no reply  
Tryna see eye to eye but its like we both blind  
Fuck it lets hit the club I rarely sip but pour me some  
  
Cause when its all said and done  
I aint gon be the one that she can always run to  
I hate liars fuck love Im tired of tryin  
My heart big but it beat quiet  
how never feel like we vibin  
Cause every time we alone its a awkward silence  
  
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter  
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond  
Shit is over what you trippin for  
I dont wanna have to let you go  
But baby I think its better if I let you know  
  
Chorus  
  
Look my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago  
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow  
Deuces we aint got no future in tomorrow  
Im a dick so it shouldnt be that hard to swallow  
The other chick Im with never complainin  
She make wanna leave the one Im with Usher Raymond  
  
Probably didnt register dont trip later on it will  
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles  
I finally noticed it it finally hit me  
Like Tina did Ike in the limo it finally hit me  
I got a new chick and she aint you  
She Paula Patton thick she give me deja Vu  
  
And all that attitude I dont care about it  
But all that shit I do for her you gon hear bout it  
Breezy rep two up two down  
But Im just puttin two up chuckin up the deuce now  
  
Chorus  
  
Deuces
