Lying here in this sleepy town  
Listening to the sun go down  
The only one who hears the sound  
Is you  
  
You look at life so wild and free  
I love the way you smile at me  
The only love Ill ever need  
Is you  
  
I need you  
To start a clear blue mornin  
I need you  
At the end of a long hard day  
  
Ive never seen you wear a frown  
Blues dont even come around  
The only love Ive ever found is you  
  
We dont go much of anywhere  
Sunday church and county fairs  
The world looks good from these rocking chairs  
Its true  
  
Be my woman Ill be your man  
Well go through life hand in hand  
All I want to understand  
Is you  
  
I need you  
To start a clear blue mornin  
I need you  
At the end of a long hard day  
  
Ive never seen you wear a frown  
Blues dont even come around  
The only love Ive ever found is you  
  
Ive never seen you wear a frown  
Blues dont even hang around  
The only love Ive ever found is you
