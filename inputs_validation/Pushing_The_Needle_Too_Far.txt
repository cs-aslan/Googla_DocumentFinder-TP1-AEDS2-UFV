Well I woke up this morning  
Grey dawn  
With a prayer on my breath  
See I lost something precious  
And Godll save me  
From losing myself  
I said I think I know whats wrong  
I think I know whats wrong  
  
Now I met the queen and I understand why  
Why she closed the door  
Im not making excuses  
But you know Ive been there a few times  
You know I was  
I was knocking on the door  
I said I think I know whats wrong  
I think I know whats wrong  
Wrong wrong  
  
Theres a man  
He lived in a house  
Had a family of five  
Well he blew up the windows and the doors  
He said I just couldnt  
I just couldnt survive  
Weve all been removed  
In one way or another  
We dont know our families  
We dont need our brothers  
Were pushing the needle too far  
Pushing the needle too far  
  
Well if you wake up in the morning  
Grey dawn  
Theres a prayer on your breath  
See maybe you lost something precious  
Godll save you  
From losing yourself  
I said I think I know whats wrong  
Let me hear you  
I think I know whats wrong  
  
Theres queen who closed the door  
The family that lies  
People who turn  
The cat that has died  
A boy that odds  
A girl with a gun  
The world on its knees  
And a band on the run  
You know youd help me more  
The queen who closed the door  
By not giving in  
The family that lies  
You know youd help me more  
People who turn  
By not giving in  
And the cat that has died  
You know youd help me more  
A boy that odds  
By not giving in  
And a girl with a gun  
I said youd help me more  
The world on its knees  
Now dont you give in  
And a band on the run  
Ah now youd help me more  
By not giving  
I said dont you dare  
Not giving in no  
Dont you dare  
Not giving in no  
Dont you dare  
Youd help me more  
By not giving in  
I said youd help me more  
By not giving in  
I said I  
I think I know whats wrong  
I think I know whats wrong  
Were pushing the needle too far
