The love that you had  
In your heart is gone  
Any touch of sincerity  
Any trace of compassion  
What hardened your heart  
What turned it to stone  
What made you forget  
You were in love with someone  
Your hands dont reach out  
Your voice doesnt call me  
I know youve stopped listening  
Your eyes look straight through me  
If nights are like this  
Id rather be alone  
Who said you could forget  
You were in love with someone  
Tell me what hardened your heart  
Tell me what turned it to stone  
Tell me what made you forget  
You were in love with someone  
Was I wrong to forgive  
Your indiscretions  
Should I have been more hysterical  
Less understanding  
If youre looking for a villain  
Go on assume the role  
But dont say that its my fault  
That youre not in love with someone  
Tell me what hardened your heart  
Tell me what turned it to stone  
Tell me what made you forget  
You were in love with someone  
Tell me theres someone in your life  
Ill fight to keep your for my own  
Tell me because I really want to know  
Why you cant be in love with someone
