We got something dont you know its true  
We got something dont feel it too  
We got something we got something to do  
Not a mushy line that Im pushing on you  
Just another bluenote sung slightly out of tune  
We got something we got something to do  
  
Prayer for peace prayer for peace  
Prayer for peace  
  
It may appear that weve been sleeping through our years  
And weve been living in an imaginary world  
But we know what  
We know what we got  
And if the choice was your of love eternally  
Or destruction of the world by some atomic energy  
The youd know what  
You know what we got  
  
Prayer for peace prayer for peace  
Prayer for peace repeat  
We got got got we got got got we got we got something  
We got we got got got we got got got we got we got something  
Prayer for peace prayer for peace  
Prayer for peace repeat
