Who built the ball that is this earth  
Gave me life and water for my thirst  
Home for a heart till death from birth  
And were only love at its best or worst  
Love calling your name  
I will live on  
Calling your name  
Who wrote the pages of our lives  
In black and white and taught me wrong from right  
Its your heart that held you tight  
But were only love  
Spin me around and round and round  
Love calling your name  
I will live on  
Calling your name  
And the world seems like my enemy  
The waterfall of frowns  
And the wave of life will capture me  
And Im falling down upon love  
Cmon now darling  
Im falling falling down on love  
Im falling down falling down on love  
Im falling down on love  
Chorus
