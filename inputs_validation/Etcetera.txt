Baby Im so glad youre over here  
Now I get to show you all the things  
That I been wanting to show you for such a long time  
Dont say nothin  
  
Picture this you and me in the kitchen babe on the counter  
Feeding each other fruits babe  
Straight from there walk into the bedroom babe  
I touch your hair and then you turn around and say whats on your mind  
And girl tonight well be making sweet love  
  
Chorus  
Girl tonight well make sweet love  
Until the rain comes falling down on you and me  
All of these things and etcetera etcetera etcetera  
Wanna kiss you places you want me to  
Promise girl that Ill do all of these things  
And etcetera etcetera etcetera  
  
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo  
Doing you pretty much all night long babe  
Till I hear you screaming my name babe  
In the pool you and me skinny dipping darlin Kellys rules  
No playing hard to get now tell me what the deal cause  
Girl tonight well be making sweet love  
  
Chorus  
  
Put on some clothes and lets go to the IHOP baby  
Lets go to the IHOP babe  
No no no Baby we just made love  
No matter how good the food may taste  
No matter how the food may taste  
Im still thinking about your body baby yes I am  
Its your body Im thinking of  
  
Chorus
