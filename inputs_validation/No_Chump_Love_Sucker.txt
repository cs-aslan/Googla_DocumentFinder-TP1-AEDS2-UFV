Shes a witch  
A bonafide bore  
Whats more  she snores  
And that is a fact  
Cow eyes lie  
Yes its time to resist  
How did I ever  
Get into this  
How could I ever  
Have kissed that bitch  
So what if shes  
Got big tits  
  
Shes the kinda girl  
Who changes her mind really quick  
Shes the kinda girl who  
Wont just let things sit  
  
She came like a cat  
Like a cat to cat nap  
She came in my lap  
With her womanly hips  
When I first met her  
I came unglued  
I played the part of  
A blue blooded fool  
Im through with your sewage  
Im through with your trash  
I always knew that Id  
Get the last laugh  
  
Shes the kinda girl  
Who changes her mind really quick  
Shes the kinda girl who  
Wont just let things sit  
  
Like two trains on one track  
Bound for a crash  
Two red white and blues we were  
Destined to clash  
I cant fix the future  
I cant change the past  
Like fly by night news  
We were not meant to last  
Im through with your bluefish  
Im through with your gash  
Im through being screwed with by  
You and your wack attack  
  
Jump back for chump love  
You wont be back for cover  
But no no no no  
Im no chump love sucker  
No chump love sucker  
  
No chump love sucker  
  
I thought that your love  
Was a matter of fact  
But I lost my pride  
When I realized that  
The smack in my bag  
And my baseball bat  
Was all you were after  
Boys you dirty rat  
Shes a bitch and a brat  
And a living disaster  
She thought she was fast  
But I was faster
