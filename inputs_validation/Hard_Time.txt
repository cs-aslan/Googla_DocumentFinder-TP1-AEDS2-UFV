Asked my girl what she wanted from me  
She said everything that I can see  
I said baby what dyou think of me  
And she said nothing at all  
  
So I sit here waiting patiently  
To see if there will be a change or three  
I think that baby she is using me  
It doesnt matter at all  
And now Im wondering which way to go  
  
So its a hard time for us all til she gets it right  
Yes its a hard time for us all be some kind of fight  
She makes the same excuse for making all the same mistakes again  
  
Now I think of all the times we had  
Yeah of all the good and all the bad  
I sometimes think that maybe Ive been had  
It doesnt matter at all  
And now Im wondering which way to go  
  
So its a hard time for us all til she gets it right  
Yes its a hard time for us all be some kind of fight  
She makes the same excuse for making all the same mistakes again
