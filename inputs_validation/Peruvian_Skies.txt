There there it is  
I swear hes gonna murder that poor kid  
Wait I hear it again  
Dont turn on the lights until we  
Hear the way it ends  
  
Under Peruvian skies  
Vanessa regretfully waits  
The story unfolds in her eyes  
Where midnight hysterias  
No big surprise  
Battered and bruised  
Always confusing  
The love that shes losing for hate  
Poor Vanessa  
  
Hey I hope you know  
Im taking all of this time with me when I go  
Shame youre not to blame  
Im the monster you created  
In your daddys name  
  
Under Peruvian skies  
Vanessa regretfully waits  
The story unfolds in her eyes  
Where midnight hysterias  
No big surprise  
Battered and bruised  
Always confusing  
The love that shes losing for hate  
Poor Vanessa  
  
Terror by night  
Liar by day  
Telling her secrets  
Wont take them away  
  
Under Peruvian skies  
Vanessa regretfully waits  
The story unfolds in her eyes  
Where midnight hysterias  
No big surprise  
Battered and bruised  
Always confusing  
The love that shes losing for hate  
Poor Vanessa
