Chorus  
I decided to stay home tonight  
I decided Ima treat you right  
I decided to be there for you  
Decided to be on my Ps and Qs  
I decided to give up my friends  
Decided Ima take you out weekends  
Decided to give you a reason to trust  
These are decisions that I make for love  
  
Enough is enough no more running around  
Searchin for whats right here at home  
Because my luck is bout to turn around  
And I just cant keep doin you wrong  
Girl I take it for granted that you will be here always  
Tired of this ego trip  
Cause soon youll be searchin for another man  
And I just cant have that happen to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Now Ive had about all that I can stand no more  
Im turnin in my playas card  
See Im retirin from the secret life I chose  
Cause I just cant keep breakin your heart  
It was silly of me to be the way that I was  
First was blind but now I see  
Baby soon youll be sayin Im fallin out of love  
And I just cant let it happen whoa whoa I  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
When tha morning comes you see the sun will shine on you and me  
Was on my way to losin you until I found reality  
So cast away your doubts and fears cause from now on Ill be right here  
For always  
Forever more I decided  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
  
Girl Im going to dump my friends  
Yes I will  
Truly I will  
We are going to be together on the weekend  
Whoa whoa  
See these are the decisions I made for love  
For the two of us  
Get up off this bull and rebuild your trust  
Yeah yeah oh no whoa  
There will be  
No more cheatin  
No more creepin  
No more fuckin  
No more sneakin
