I will choke until I swallow  
Choke this infant here before me  
What is this but my reflection  
Who am I to judge and strike you down  
But youre  
Pushing and shoving me  
You still love me and you pushit on me  
Rest your trigger on my finger  
Bang my head upon the fault line  
Take care not to make me enter  
Cause if I do we both may disappear  
But youre pushing me  
Shoving me Pushit on me  
Slipping back into the gap again  
Im alive when youre touching me  
Alive when youre shoving me down  
But Id trade it all  
For just a little bit of  
Piece of mind  
Put me somewhere I dont wanna be  
Seeing someplace I dont wanna see  
Never wanna see that place again  
Saw that gap again today  
As you were begging me to stay  
Managed to push myself away  
And you as well  
If when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay  
You minimize my movement anyway  
I must persuade you another way  
Theres no love in fear  
Staring down the hole again  
Hands upon my back again  
Survival is my only friend  
Terrified of what may come  
Just remember I will always love you  
Even as I tear your fucking throat away  
But it will end no other way
