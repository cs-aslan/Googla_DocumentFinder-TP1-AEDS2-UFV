Why why  
Cause Im the type of guy  
Who believes in a Spirit I cant see with my eyes  
You cant deny even if you try  
The one who created you the earth and the sky  
Im a baptized disciple so I shall not tell a lie  
Ive got the Holy Spirit now Im flyin high  
Now while Im rippin a record take a second  
Do me a favor make the Lord Jesus Christ your saviour  
Yes I must confess I had a lot of stress  
On my chest  I was a mess  
But now Im blessed  
By the Lord Jesus Christ being in my life  
Now Im a whole new guy  
Go tell em thats why  
Refrain  
Maybe youve seen the change  thats why  
Things are not the same  thats why  
Things just happen when you call upon His name  thats why  
Maybe you want the change  thats why  
Maybe you want the same  thats why  
Maybe youd better call upon His name  
Yeah  
Bridge  
So light so light so free  
Thats what I feel now that Ive got the Lord in me  
So right so right so real  
Nothing in the world can make me feel  
What Im feeling now  
Now its time time to open up  
Your heart and your mind  
Thats why Im here bustin this rhyme  
So can you hear me  
Just tryin to save your soul  
Well can you feel me  
Let the Lord take control  
Then the life you think will be eternal  
Instead its gonna be inside hells inferno  
Now get it straight dont wait  
Hesitate or procrastinate  
The Lords comin back dont wait  
So light so light so free  
Thats what I feel now that Ive got the Lord in me  
Maybe youve seen the change  thats why  
Things are not the same  t
