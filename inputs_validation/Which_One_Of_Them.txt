The girl at the bar she bought me a beer  
And shed like to know if Im new around here  
And the gal that I danced with says shes all alone  
Her friends have all left and she needs a ride home  
  
Oh and there have been others who gave me the eye  
But if they only knew they were wasting their time  
Cause theres only one lover I can give my heart to  
But you didnt want it and you broke it in two  
  
So tell me which one of them will you be tonight  
Oh which one will hold me in your arms so tight  
Ive forgotten whats wrong given up on whats right  
Tell me which one of them will you be tonight  
  
So Ill just smile and pretend and shell never know  
Who shes up against when shes holdin me close  
Youre all that I want girl your all that I need  
And when I close my eyes honey youre all that I see  
  
So tell me which one of them will you be tonight  
Oh which one will hold me in your arms so tight  
Ive forgotten whats wrong given up on whats right  
Tell me which one of them will you be tonight
