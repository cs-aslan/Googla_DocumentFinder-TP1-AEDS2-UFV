Still drinking on the corner  
Just dont say I didnt warn you  
Always nagging big brother  
Hes only looking out for you  
  
Tony the pony  
Tony the pony  
  
Youre still standing on the corner  
Just dont say I didnt warn you  
Old and jealous big brother  
You had your time and you spent it  
Crying  
  
Now Tony the pony  
Tony the pony  
So thats what they call you now  
When youre free outside  
So cold and hard and in control  
And  
Theres a free ride on  
Tony the pony  
  
Oh why do you always want to stop me  
From doing the things in life that make me happy  
And when Im outside with friends laughing loudly  
Why do you always want to stop me  
  
Oh I would never  
I would never  
  
But you will carry the can for anyone  
The free ride on  
Gullible Tony  
  
Youre drunker quicker  
And youre sicker even quicker  
For something heavy is gonna fall on you  
Oh  
  
And what do they call you now  
When youre free outside  
So cold and hard and in control  
And ohbeen a lark  
Theres a free ride on  
Fuckedup Tony  
  
I will never say I told you so  
Or how I knew that something bad  
Would happen to you  
I dont want to say I told you so  
Oh but Tony I told you so  
I told you so
