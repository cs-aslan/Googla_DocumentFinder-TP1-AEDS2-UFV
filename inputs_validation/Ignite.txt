Drop in hey  
  
Call us degenerate heads in a purple haze  
Breaking our necks with crime that pays  
Its the war of Rolex versus renegades  
So place your bets and burn the beds you made  
  
You know were never bending or breaking forsaking anything  
Bonded together we can share in the pain  
And we can feel it believe it timing is everything  
And this time were going out with a bang  
  
Right now I can feel the world is spinning  
Right now fight for a new beginning  
Right now ignite and light the shape of the world youre living  
And Im sticking with the fuse so tight  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Dont let me down were running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Dont let me down were running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
We fight the eminent threat like a macrophage  
Blood tears and sweat with a war we wage  
If we cant get the key well break the cage  
Bleed for liberty and get machines to rage  
  
You know were never fearing or faking braking for anyone  
We come together yeah were just having fun  
And we can feel it believe it and there goes the neighborhood  
And this time I think youre misunderstood  
  
Right now I can feel the world is spinning  
Right now fight for a new beginning  
Right now ignite and light the shape of the world youre living  
And Im sticking with the fuse so tight  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Dont let me down were running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Dont let me down were running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
Weve been dreaming it bleeding it believing what they say  
While theyre killing it leaving it and lying all the way  
Heard the counterfeit syndicate is growing everyday  
But were over it today were gonna light the way  
  
Ignite light it up ignite light it up  
Ignite light it up ignite tonight ignite tonight  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Dont let me down were running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Dont let me down were running on high  
Ignite worldwide
