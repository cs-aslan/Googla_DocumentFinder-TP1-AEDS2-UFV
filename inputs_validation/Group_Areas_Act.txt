If Im dreaming dont wake me up if its a lie dont tell me the truth  
  
Chorus  
Cause what the truth will do its gonna hurt my heart  
Being in the darkness for so long now  
Mr President did I hear you well Last night on TV  
You said  
The group areas act is going Apartheid is going x2  
  
Ina me eye me sight the future so bright  
I mean I my eyes  
I see the future so bright  
  
When the blackie manna coming together  
With the whitey manna x2  
Whitey manna coming together with the blackman  
  
Chorus  
If Im dreaming  
  
Gazing at my crystal ball I see the future so bright  
The fightings gonna stop now  
Well forgive and forget I know Mr President  
You cant please everyone  
But everybody liked it  
When you said  
  
Group areas act is going  
Apartheid is going x2  
  
Chorus  
If Im dreaming till fade
