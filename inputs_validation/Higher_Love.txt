VERSE 1  
Think about it  
There must be higher love  
Down in the heart or  
Hidden in the stars above  
Without it life is wasted time  
Look inside your heart  
Ill look inside mine  
Things look so bad everywhere  
In this whole world what is fair  
We will walk the line  
And try to see  
Falling behind in what could be  
  
CHORUS  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love  
Wheres that higher love  
I keep thinking of  
  
VERSE 2  
Worlds are turning  
And were just hanging on  
Facing our fear  
And standing out there alone  
A yearning and its real to me  
There must be someone  
Whos feeling for me  
Things look so bad everywhere  
In this whole world what is fair  
We will walk the line  
And try to see  
Falling behind in what could be  
  
CHORUS  
BRIDGE  
I will wait for it  
Im not too late for it  
Until then Ill sing my song  
To cheer the night along  
I could light the night up  
With my soul on fire  
I could make the sun shine  
From pure desire  
Let me feel that love come over me  
Let me feel how strong it could be  
  
CHORUS
