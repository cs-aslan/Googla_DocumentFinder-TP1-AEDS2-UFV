These lips were made for kissing  
These hips were made fro blissing  
These arms were made for squeezing you tight  
Everyday olay everynight  
  
These lips were made for selecting  
These hips were made for connecting  
These legs were made for wrapping around you  
So tight olay everynight  
  
When you see my dancing on the floor  
Youll agree Im class to the core  
When you see me dancing with the boys  
Youll agree youve never seen such poise  
  
These lips were made for tasting my time  
Werent made for wasting so Im  
Gonna show you how its done  
Just for fun anyone wanna come  
  
These lips were made for kissing  
Take a sip and youll know what youve been missing  
Youll flip when you see this tamale wants to make you stay  
Everyday olay everynight  
  
Whatd you say everyday olay everynight  
We can play everyday olay everynight well alright
