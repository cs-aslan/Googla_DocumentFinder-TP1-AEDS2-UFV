Waist down deep tied now its chest high  
Pressure pours down from the top down all sides  
Something seeps down inside  
you cant suppress when its your want  
To revise could have skipped the slide  
But you did not try  
Change it all when you get time  
When your first trys not so bad  
Change it all when you get time  
Stay inside its as safe as you can get  
Trust in sleep your delivery from what your feeling  
In the time your awake  
Try to fake out yourself  
The second you get wind of  
What went wrong this time  
Could have skipped the slide but you did not try  
Change it all when you get time  
When your first trys not so bad  
Change it all when you get time  
Stay inside its as safe as you can get  
Safest from the life that you got  
Try to catch yourself you slipped again  
Try to catch yourself you slipped again  
But dont let it keep you in
