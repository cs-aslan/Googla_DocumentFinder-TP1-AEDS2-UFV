I could find another girl to kiss me  
I could find another girl to miss me  
I could find another girl who wants to be true  
But Ill never get over you  
I got over Marie Lou I got over Suzie Q  
I got over Connie too  
I got over losing you to somebody new  
But Ill never get over you  
No Ill never get over you  
Ah ah oh no ah ah  
No Ill never get over you  
Oh no my heart tells me so  
I dont know just what there is about you  
But I know that I cant live without you  
I could find another girl to flirt with  
I could find another girl to hurt with  
I could find another girl almost like you  
But Ill never get over you  
I got over Linda Lou I got over Peggie Sue  
I got over Betty too  
I got over losing you to somebody new  
But Ill never get over you  
No Ill never get over you  
Oh no ah ah oh no  
No Ill never get over you  
Oh no my heart tells me so  
No Ill never get over you  
Ah ah oh no ah ah  
No Ill never get
