I could give you a dozen  
Fresh  
Cut  
Pink or red or white  
I wonder if they knew what they  
Would grow to become

Youll have to cut it down  
And burn me into splinters  
Or Ill unwrap the string  
That was me  
Around your finger  
And Ill hang you in  
Your bedroom burial ground  
  
There is a taste for blood  
And its something deep inside  
There is a taste for blood  
And its deep inside

I dont ever want god  
To hear our screams  
And mistake them for prayers  
And you know Im loaded  
But not which chamber  
Touch me and Ill go  
Click click click click click  
Click click click click click  
Click click click click click

Im born villain  
Dont pretend to be a victim  
Im born villain  
Dont pretend to be a victim  
Im born villain  
Dont pretend to be a victim  
Im born villain  
Dont pretend to be a victim
