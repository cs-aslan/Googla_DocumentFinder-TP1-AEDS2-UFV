Verse  Violent J  
I like to suffocate people and bite their necks  
They got me in a place that aint like the rest  
And all you gotta do is try to go for the neck  
And its sedativessedativeslike that  
Slow down color smear all around  
Weird sounds you in the mind of a clown  
And a wicked one somehow spinnin around  
Wheel me down the hallway arms strapped down  
With sedatives  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
Hangin all out the neck from the IV  
Sedatives for the lively  
Study me ask me no answer  
Im cuttin your neck first chance sir  
Violent J  
White walls white floor small rooms  
After sedatives they become ballrooms  
Crows fly by my window slow  
Headed that way but lookin at me though  
Sedatives  
Sedatives  
Sedative me  
Sedatives  
Sedative me  
Sedatives  
Sedatives  
Sedatives  
Verse  Shaggy 2 Dope  
Im an accident human malfunction at best  
And Im lookin at a scalpel diggin into your chest  
If I could only move but them sedatives  
You know they saving your life them sedatives  
Some of these other patients are strong as hell  
Suffocating one creep took me long as hell  
But I took his sedatives well I thought they were sedatives  
But they were only medatives  
Violent J  
I fake pain call em over and play dead  
And yank a fistful of hair out the nurse ladys head  
High on sedatives again put me in a tiny place  
Chin strap muzzle over my face  
I threw a guy off the roof first day they admitted me  
I was sedated and thats when it hit me  
The only time Im at peace is when I aint even there  
God tell me why the fuck am I here  
Verse  Violent J  
I want a lobotomy no shock therapy  
Come clean me nurse take care of me  
I suffocated the last 2 they sent in alone  
They had to stick me in the chest with a shot of methadone  
Recreation time wheel me to the courtyard  
Four guards in white and they might be important  
And the sky is blue and I can watch trees grow  
Watch leaves flow enjoy the sedative show  
Shaggy 2 Dope  
Well I even have my very own room these days  
White straight jacket padded walls and PJs  
But theres so many ways and every stunt I pull  
I even slammed my own mouth down on the toilet bowl  
For attention maybe not to mention a sedative  
Heard one guy say why even let it live  
Theres probably no sedatives in Hell  
And thats the only reason Im alive still  
Violent J  
The Witch is everywhere and I can see that yall  
Stabbed one nurse in the neck with a straw  
A plastic straw yet flimsy and weak  
But if you cork it with your thumb and hold it rightFREEEK
