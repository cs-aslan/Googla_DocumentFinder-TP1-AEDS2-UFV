Sometimes I think about Saturdays child  
And all about the times when we were running wild  
  
Ive been asearchin for the dolphins in the sea  
Ah but sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me  
  
This old world will never change the way its been  
And all our ways of war cant change it back again  
  
Ive been asearchin for the dolphin in the sea  
Ah but sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me  
  
Lord Im not the one to tell this old world how to get  
along  
I only know that peace will come when all our hate is gone  
  
Ive been asearchin for the dolphin in the sea  
Ah but sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me
