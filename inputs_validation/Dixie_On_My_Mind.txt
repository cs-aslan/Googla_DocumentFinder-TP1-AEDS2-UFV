All the stations up here dont sign off with Dixie  
The way they did in sweet home Alabama  
The people here dont sip Jack Daniels whiskey  
The way they do in that Tennessee mountain land  
  
Ive always heard lots about the big apple  
So I thought Id come up here and see  
But all Ive seen so far is one big hassle  
Wish I was camped out on the Okeechobee  
  
If this is the promised land  
Ive had all I can stand  
And Im headed back below that Dixie line  
Well I just dont fit in  
And Ill never come back again  
Im busted here with Dixie on my mind  
Oh Im stuck up here and I got Dixie on my mind  
  
These people never smile or say a word  
Theyre all too busy tryin to make an extra dime  
Oh Id love to haul em all down around Spartanburg  
And show em how to raise hell in Carolina  
  
Oh the things you know that I miss most of all  
Is the freedom of the rivers and the pines  
They dont do much huntin and fishin up here ya know  
But I have met a few squirrels and one porcupine  
  
If this is the promised land  
Ive had all I can stand  
Wish I was down in Houston town tonight  
Well I just dont fit in  
And Ill never come back again  
Im busted here with Dixie on my mind  
Oh Im stuck up here and I got Dixie on my mind
