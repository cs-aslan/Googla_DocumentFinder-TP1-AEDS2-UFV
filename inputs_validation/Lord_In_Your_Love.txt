Lord in Your love  
Youve given life to me  
Lord in Your love  
Lord for Your love  
I give my life to You  
Lord for Your love  
  
As You shed Your blood  
May I shed my blood for You  
In Your Truth revealed  
May my life be ever true  
  
Through Your grace my Lord  
Is my life redeemed from sin  
In Your death my Lord  
Did my life begin again  
  
I was empty Lord  
Till Your presence filled my soul  
Without purpose Lord  
Till Your purpose made me whole  
  
How can I repay  
All the good Youve done for me  
How can I express  
All the love I have for Thee
