Can I sleep in your arms tonight  
Lady its so cold lying here all alone  
And I have no hold to hold on you  
And I assure you Ill do you no wrong  
  
Dont know why but the one I love left me  
Left me lonely and cold and so weak  
And I need someones arms to hold me till  
Im strong enough to get back on my feet  
Can I sleep in your arms tonight  
Lady its so cold lying here all alone  
And I have no hold to hold on you  
And I assure you Ill do you no wrong  
  
Can I sleep in your arms tonight  
Lady its so cold lying here all alone  
And I have no hold to hold on you  
And I assure you Ill do you no wrong
