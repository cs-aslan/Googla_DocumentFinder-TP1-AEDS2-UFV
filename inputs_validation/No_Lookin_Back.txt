Im fading out of sight  
My wheels are the only sound  
Runnin at the speed of a light  
N I cant slow down now  
  
Out on an open road  
Racin to beat the night  
No matter where Im goin  
I guess Ill get alright  
  
So why dont I understand  
Whats trippin me up  
It oughta be a simple thing  
  
Chorus  
I cant hold on  
N I cant return  
Its time to let go  
N start to live and learn  
  
I took a oneway flight  
Too high to see the ground  
Now I know how long it takes  
A heart to come down  
  
Alone on the highway now  
Takin it mile by mile  
Id rather be a lonely man  
than an imprisoned child  
  
So why do I feel the strain  
That keeps trippin me up  
Will it ever be a simple thing  
  
I cant hold on  
And I cant return  
Rivers will run  
N bridges will burn  
I cant say just how  
But theres no lookin back now  
  
When everything fades away  
And theres nothing left  
Then you got to keep rememberin  
  
I wont slow down  
N I cant return  
Its time to let go  
N start to live and learn  
  
So why dont I understand  
Whats trippin me up  
well it oughta be a simple thing  
  
I cant hold on  
N I cant return  
Rivers will run  
N bridges will burn  
I cant say just how  
but theres no lookin back now  
I wont slow down  
N I cant return  
As night turns to dawn  
The pages will burn  
I cant say just how  
But theres no lookin back now  
I cant hold on  
N I cant run  
Its time to let go  
N start to live and learn
