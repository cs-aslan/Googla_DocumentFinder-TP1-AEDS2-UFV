Take the jib sail down boys take the jib sail down  
Turn this ship around boys before we run aground  
The fish arent bitin today boys fish arent bitin today  
Im gonna lay on my bunk and get drunk as a sunk cause the fish arent bitin
today  
  
Theres six foot waves and my stomach craves some good old Antiguan Rum  
I took some away for a rainy day and the rain she is startin to come now  
Take the jib sail down boys  
  
Theres a northern wind and the lights are dim like a good fresh Cuban cigar  
I got me a hunch where there might be a bunch in the Captains pickle jar  
So take the jib sail down boys  
 guitar   
The fish arent bitin today boys
