Dont play that song for me  
cause it brings back the memories  
Of the days that I once knew  
Of the days that I spent with you  
  
Oh no dont let it play  
It fills my heart with pain  
Please stop it right away  
cause I remember just what it said  
It said darling  
  
You know that you lied  
Boy you know that you lied  
You know that you lied  
You lied you lied you lied  
  
Remember on our first date  
You kissed me  
Then you walked away  
And I was only seventeen  
I never dreamed that he could be so mean  
  
Oh darling dont you play no more  
Dont you dare play that song  
You know you lied  
  
Ohh
