Sing a sad song  
In a lonely place  
Try to put a word in from me  
Its been so long  
  
Since I found this place  
You better put in two or three  
We as people are just walking round  
Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground  
  
What we dont see  
Well it cant be real  
What we dont touch we cannot feel  
  
Where were living in this town  
The sun is coming up and its going down  
But its all just the same at the end of the day  
And we cheat and we lie  
  
Nobody says its wrong  
So we dont ask why  
Cause its all just the same at the end of the day  
  
Were throwing it all away  
Were throwing it all away  
Were throwing it all away at the end of the day  
  
If youre needing  
Something I can give  
I know Id help you if I can  
If your honest and you say that you did  
  
You know that I would give you my hand  
Or a sad song  
In a lonely place  
Ill try to put a word in for you  
  
Need a shoulder Well if thats the case  
You know theres nothing I wouldnt do  
  
Where were living in this town  
The sun is coming up and its going down  
But its all just the same at the end of the day  
When we cheat and we lie  
  
Nobody says its wrong  
So we dont ask why  
Cause its all just the same at the end of the day  
  
Dont throw it all away  
Dont throw it all away  
Dont throw it all away  
Dont throw it all away  
  
Throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
  
Throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
Youre throwing it all away at the end of the day
