VERSE  
Joy there a joy in my soul  
I cant explain it but I know its You  
Light Oh Im feeling so light  
Like a weight has been lifted by You  
  
Jesus You are my breakthrough its You  
  
CHORUS  
Now Im free Yeah  
There is nothing holding me  
Im free yeah  
cause You died and rose for me  
  
Now Im Free  
  
VERSE  
Peace theres a peace in my heart  
Theres a power thats with me its You  
  
BRIDGE  
No weapon formed against me will overcome  
The enemys defeated Jesus has won
