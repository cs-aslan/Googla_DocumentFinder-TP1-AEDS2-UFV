  
  
Yeah I saw you coming down the street  
  
I could tell by your look that you didnt want to meet  
  
So this time I went away but next time  
  
Im just gonna have to say  
  
can I buy you a dress or something  
  
Could I buy you some drewery or something  
  
Would you go out with me or something  
  
Would you sleep with me or something  
  
  
Better watch out if youre train is moving to fast  
  
You better look out if youre living in the past  
  
because thats why youll never lose these sweet misery blues  
  
Thats why youll never lose these sweet misery blues  
  
  
Yeah Im gonna corner you in an elevator  
  
and then you wont be able to put me off till later  
  
Ill put on my charm and Ill tingle your spine  
  
Ill take off my charm and then youll want to die  
  
Could I buy you a dress or something  
  
Could I buy you some drewery or something  
  
Would you go out with me or something  
  
Would you sleep with me or something  
  
  
You better watch out cause you cant get rid of me  
  
You better look out now babe dont you see  
  
Thats why youll never lose these sweet misery blues 2 times
