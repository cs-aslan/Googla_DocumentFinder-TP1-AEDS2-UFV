I used to cry myself to sleep at night  
But that was all before she came  
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right  
But now youre here its not the same  
Its not the same  
  
She builds me up  
She gives me love  
More love than Ive ever seen  
Shes all I got  
Shes all I got in this world  
And shes all the woman that I need  
  
And in the morning when I kiss her eyes  
She takes me down and rocks me slow  
And in the evening when the moon is high  
She holds me close and wont let go  
She wont let go  
  
She builds me up  
She gives me love  
More love than Ive ever seen  
Shes all I got  
Shes all I got in this world  
And shes all the woman that I need
