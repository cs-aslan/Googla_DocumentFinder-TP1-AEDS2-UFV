Im gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad  
Im gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad  
I work a hundred grand scam from a border town  
Well Ill be feeling glad  
  
Im gonna find me a blondehaired mama  
In a Jeep with a German Shepherd by her side  
Im gonna find me a blondehaired mama  
With boots and a fortyfour on her side  
And if I aint too hjigh or used up  
Ill have her take me for a groovy little hippie ride  
  
Im gonna fix brown rice every day  
And drink down a bottle of Midnight Red  
Im gonna fix brown rice every day  
And drink down a bottle of Midnight Red  
Thats all I need to get groovy  
Thats what all the little hippie said
