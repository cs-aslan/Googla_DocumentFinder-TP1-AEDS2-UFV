This I swear  
Each and every way I can  
I will prove to you  
Ive got a fortune in my hands when Im holding you  
Never want to let you go again  
And thats the truth  
I will try and answer all your prayers  
This I swear  
  
Theres always a danger  
Theres always a fear  
Loves not gonna make it out of here  
Im not asking for perfection  
Just want a love thats true  
And in return  
Ill do my best for you  
It seems the higher we climb  
The further we fall together  
But right here Ill vow  
Baby I promise you know  
  
Each and every way I can  
I will prove to you  
Ive got a fortune in my hands when Im holding you  
Never want to let you go again  
And thats the truth  
I will try and answer all your prayers  
This I swear  
  
We each have our moments  
Our times of doubt  
But I know deep down  
Dont want to live without you  
Youre the exception to the rule  
cause where loves concerned  
I guess Ive been a fool  
I know its a long long road  
But as long as we stand together  
Right here Ill vow  
Baby I promise you now  
  
Each and every way I can  
I will prove to you  
Ive got a fortune in my hands when Im holding you  
Never want to let you go again  
And thats the truth  
I will try and answer all your prayers  
This I swear
