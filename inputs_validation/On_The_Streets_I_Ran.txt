Ooh a workingclass face glares back  
At me from the glass and lurches  
Oh forgive me on the streets I ran  
Turned sickness into popular song  
Streets of wet black holes  
On roads you can never know  
You never have them  
But they always have you  
Till the day that you croak  
its no joke  
Ooh a workingclass face glares back  
At me from the glass and lurches  
Oh forgive me on the streets I ran  
Turned sickness into unpopular song  
And all these streets can do  
Is claim to know the real you  
And warn if you dont leave  
You will kill or be killed  
Which isnt very nice  
Here everybodys friendly  
But nobodys friends  
Oh dear God when will I  
Be where I should be  
And when the Palmist said  
One Thursday you will be dead  
I said No not me this cannot be  
Dear God take him take them take anyone  
The stillborn  
The newborn  
The infirmed  
Take anyone  
Take people from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania  
Just spare me
