All these posers keep you awake  
I guess Im just too tired to sleep  
And God only knows Im too lost to cry  
Kissing last has kept me true  
Ill fall hold me tight  
But Ill leave hold me tight  
So hold me tight  
Cause Im so lonely  
  
Ill fall hold me tight  
But Ill leave hold me tight  
So hold me tight  
Cause Im so lonely  
  
He hates so much its love he says  
Inside his dark I need to smile  
He shouts so loud I never hear  
Thats why the truths always abused  
  
As I slip into unconsciousness  
I never felt so much to blame  
Ill fall hold me tight  
But Ill leave hold me tight  
So hold me tight  
Cause Im so lonely  
  
Ill fall hold me tight  
But Ill leave hold me tight  
So hold me tight  
Cause Im so lonely  
  
As I slip into unconsciousness  
I never felt so much to blame  
Ill fall hold me tight  
But Ill leave hold me tight  
So hold me tight  
Cause Im so lonely  
  
Ill fall hold me tight  
But Ill leave hold me tight  
So hold me tight  
Cause Im so lonely  
  
Ill fall hold me tight  
But Ill leave hold me tight  
So hold me tight  
Cause Im so lonely  
  
Ill fall hold me tight  
But Ill leave hold me tight  
So hold me tight  
Cause Im so lonely  
  
Ill fall another day another night  
So hold me tight  
Cause Im so lonely  
  
Ill fall another day another night  
So hold me tight  
Cause Im so lonely
