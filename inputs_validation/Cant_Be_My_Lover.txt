Have ah piece of body where every good guy deserve  
But I wont allow this girl to mess with my nerves  
Blessed figure not to mention the curves  
Through the corner of her eyes she slowly observe  
  
Anytime she come around  
Something is about to go down  
Listen to the siren sound  
Wake up wake up right now  
Cause if I was to go to sleep  
Catch me dreaming of a way to creep  
Trouble always seems to follow me  
Oh dont follow me now  
  
Over and over and over again  
I try to tell her no no no  
I already have a friend  
Over and over shes reeling me in  
She says nobody has to know  
But I got to let her go  
  
So I had to walk on bye  
She cant be my lover  
Shes flashing me them pretty brown eyes  
She cant be my lover  
Though theres green grass on the other side  
She cant be my lover  
All I can say is hi  
She cant be my lover  
Listen listen right now  
  
Anytime she hear the beat  
She be dancing right in front of me  
Trying to lure me in between the sheets  
But Im a man and I still get week  
But Ill be damned if I loose my girl  
Ill be damned if I dont touch her  
Curiosity it killed the cat  
Oh and I dont want that so  
  
Over and over and over again  
I try to tell her no no no  
I already have a friend  
Over and over shes reeling me in  
She says nobody has to know  
But I got to let her go  
  
So I have to walk on bye  
She cant be my lover  
Flashing me them pretty brown eyes  
She cant be my lover  
And though theres green grass on the other side  
She cant be my lover  
All I can say is hi  
She cant be my lover  
Listen listen right now  
  
Ah couldnt let you pass even if I try  
Im a bird in the hand  
Why chase one in the sky  
Sex female refuse to comply  
Plus she is an empress  
Who want ah stand by  
Been receiving love but she cant satisfy  
Would like to have my cake and even enjoy the pie  
Politely decline like me shy  
Honey say me sof come one give it a try  
Look in ah me eyes with seductive eyes  
Fill with deception trouble and lies  
And ah doh want no more problems in a me life  
Ask me if me number so that we could enjoy the night  
She want  
  
Over and over and over again  
I try to tell her no no no  
I already have a friend  
Can you hear  
Over and over she reeling me in  
Oh nobody has to know  
But I got to let her go  
  
So I have to walk on bye  
She cant be my lover  
Flashing me them pretty brown eyes  
She cant be my lover  
Though theres green grass on the other side  
She cant be my lover  
All I can say is hi  
She cant be my lover
