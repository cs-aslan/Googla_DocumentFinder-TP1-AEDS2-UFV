When Im down when my souls in need of rest  
Come your words of comfort and of hope  
I see your face always smiling back at me  
A stream of light shining straight to the heart  
Child of God child of light  
Therell be no more lonely nights  
Cause you have brightened up my life  
  
Theres a road that leads me to this place  
A path of love running straight to the heart  
  
Over the years Ive learned one important thing  
Its that real friends shall never truly be apart  
You were there in my darkest time of need  
With a hand reaching straight to the heart  
  
Child of God child of light  
Therell be no more lonely nights  
Cause you have brightened up my life  
  
Take this gift it is all I have to give  
A prayer of love forever straight to the heart
