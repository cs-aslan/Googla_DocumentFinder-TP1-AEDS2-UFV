Theres a light in the darkness that shines  
Giving hope to all the world  
Hope to all the world  
And theres a door thats been opened to all  
Into a new and living way  
A new and living way  
  
Praise the name of Jesus  
Perfect Redeemer Star of the Morning  
Yesterday today and forever  
Jesus the Same  
  
Theres a fire that burns in our hearts  
To see the lost return  
To the Father  
And its a passion thats not of our own  
We have seen it in the Son  
In the face of the Son  
  
Wonderful Counsillor  
Mighty God Eternal Father  
Prince of Peace
