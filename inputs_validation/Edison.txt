He made electric lights to read  
He gave us light today  
He gave us cylinders to please  
When Edison came to stay Edison came to stay  
  
Edison set the world on fire  
He really made the day  
Station to station many wires  
Edison came to stay  
Edison came to stay  
  
Oh how look at us now  
Weve still got a lot to learn  
But its someone elses turn  
Edisons here to stay  
Edisons here to stay  
  
All of the world can taste his glory  
All of the people say  
You be the man to write his story  
Edisons here to stay  
Edisons here to stay  
  
Oh how look at us now  
Weve still got a lot to learn  
But its someone elses turn  
Edisons here to stay  
Edisons here to stay  
  
He made electric lights to read  
He gave us light today  
He gave us cylinders to please  
when Edison came to stay  
Edison came to stay  
Edison came to stay  
Edison came to stay  
  
You be the man to write his story  
Edison came to stay  
Edison came to stay  
All of his world can hear his story  
Edison came to stay Repeats
