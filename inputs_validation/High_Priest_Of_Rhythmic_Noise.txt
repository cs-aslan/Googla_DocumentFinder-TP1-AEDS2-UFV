Its been a long time baby  
High priest of rhythmic noise  
Living inside of me  
I been goin round in circles  
And Ive considered first degree  
Just a singer in a mind choir  
Lives on harmony  
If the song dont change the choir wont sin  
Wont sing the same song forever  
Its such a pity  
Whats a poor boy to do  
Its such a pity  
Whats a poor boy to do  
You look strange thats what I like  
You look strange like me  
Fit to be tied a little bedtime story  
Next position please  
Just a singer in a mind choir  
Lives on harmony  
If the song dont change the choir wont sing  
Wont sing the same song forever  
Its such a pity  
Whats a poor boy to do  
Its such a pity  
Whats a poor boy to do  
Its such a pity  
Whats a poor boy to do  
When the high priest of rhythmic noise  
Is inside of you  
Dont give up get out get down  
forever is a long long time  
Dont stand up shut up sit down  
youre strange thats what I like  
Dont make a move till you hear that sound  
im just a singer in a mind choir  
Dont give up get out get down  
high priest of rhytmic noise  
Its such a pity  
Whats a poor boy to do  
Its such a pity  
Whats a poor boy to do  
Its such a pity  
Whats a poor boy to do  
When the high priest of rhythmic noise  
Is inside of you  
Forever is a long long time  
If you can  
Im a little tiny plastic pills  
From my little plastic pills  
Its such a pity  
Whats a poor boy to do  
Its such a pity  
Whats a poor boy to do  
Its such a pity  
Whats a poor boy to do  
When the high priest of rhythmic noise  
Is inside of you  
Dont give up get out get down  
forever is a long long time  
Dont stand up shut up sit down  
youre strange thats what I like  
Dont make a move till you hear that sound  
Im just a singer in a mind choir  
Dont give up get out get down  
high priest of rhytmic noise  
Dont give up get out get down  
forever is a long long time  
Dont stand up shut up sit down  
youre strange thats what I like  
Dont make a move till you hear that sound  
im just a singer in a mind choir  
Dont give up get out get down  
high priest of rhytmic noise
