Well I guess its in my genes  
Not in horoscopes or cosmic things  
These feelings run in my blood  
Always was and always is  
Comes on strong and it never quiets  
Never had to work that hard at love  
It aint magic know its automatic  
You walk in a room  
Girl I gotta have it  
Cupid didnt even have to let an arrow go  
There was no love potion  
No walking on the ocean  
No miracle hat to break through  
If you wonder why I love you like I do  
Baby I was born too  
What everybody else calls a mystery  
Sure comes easy to me  
Yeah you might say Im natural  
Well its got nothing to do with me  
Its all about you and the way you set me free  
To be the man who has it all  
It aint magic know its automatic  
You walk in a room  
Girl I gotta have it  
Cupid didnt even have to let an arrow go  
There was no love potion  
No walking on the ocean  
No miracle hat to break through  
If you wonder why I love you like I do  
Baby I was born to love love give give  
Share everything that Im feeling only with you  
It aint magic know its automatic  
You walk in a room  
Girl I gotta have it  
Cupid didnt even have to let an arrow go  
There was no love potion  
No walking on the ocean  
No miracle hat to break through  
If you wonder why I love you like I do  
Baby I was born too  
If you wonder why I love you like I do  
Baby I was born too  
Oh
