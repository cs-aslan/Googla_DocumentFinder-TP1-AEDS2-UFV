So many nights I lay awake  
Cant sleep  
I lay here thinkin bout a woman  
I used to love  
Cant sleep but no good to count sheep  
Ill just count the worries  
That Ive got plenty of  
  
And how many times  
Must I be the fool  
Before I can make it  
Oh make it on home  
Ive got to find a place to sing my words  
Is there nobody listening to my song  
  
You talk about a life  
Been searching for the key  
But cant find an answer  
To comfort me  
I ask myself about love  
Cant even find the door  
To take me to a place  
Ive never seen before  
  
But how many times  
Must I be the fool  
Before I can make it  
Oh make it on home  
Ive got to find a place to sing my words  
Is there nobody listening to my song
