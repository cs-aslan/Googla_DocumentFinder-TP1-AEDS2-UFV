Every night stopping  
Its raining  
Scary oh  
So rage you again  
Your  
On fire  
I one decide to run out  
Oh they got off you did  
Wonder where you say you knew  
  
Sugar aint poison  
But sugar will kill you  
Its too much of a good thing  
Maybe not so  
  
I wasnt somebody  
No hand out  
I give you  
I stare back and  
Gonna let you out  
I wonder what you  
All of sad you knew  
  
Sugar aint poison  
But sugar will kill you  
Too much of a good thing  
Maybe not so  
  
You did what you thought was fitting baby  
Dreams about oh what is sunning you  
Oh baby  
I hung up my package  
Never no never you knew  
  
Sugar aint poison  
But sugar will kill you  
Too much of a good thing  
Maybe not so sweet
