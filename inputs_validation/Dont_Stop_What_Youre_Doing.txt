Verse one puff daddy  
  
Yeah yeah uhhuh check it out yeah cmon  
Whether you like it hard or the live guitars  
Anything dropped if its hot its ours  
If its not its yours we on the job  
Everybody eatin everybody involved  
You cant stop that like you cant stop rap  
Bad boy stop whats the chance of that  
We dont stop so check the mansions and stacks  
And we dont have to answer to jack  
No wonder we had this rap shit locked for eight straight summers  
Pull up at the party eight straight hummers  
Six be the 6th 7th and 8th wonders  
Pop corks we be the toast of new york  
And out west we want yall to understand  
All we wanna do is make you dance  
We know the song aint done wrong when the party is hot  
Yall dont really want us to stop do you  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse two lil kim  
  
When it comes to the cheese baby girl roll dough  
Fuck dominos strictly dice  
Bet you niggaz wont flow for this ice notes is the price  
Lil sis walk away with the dough yall niggaz still broke  
While my pockets on reup  
Yall niggaz shit on e what a pity  
Aint it a shame how your man chose me  
And you wanna know why its mad simple  
Even in the winter still pull a baller wit my jimmies  
Drive a tahoe wit plenty cash flow  
He know anything I touch I blow  
And I crush a show wit my luscious flow  
Gotta crew full of niggaz and a lexus too  
All of them hold me down while Im pressin you  
So who stressin who and even though my nigga gone  
Lil kim and puff daddy keep keepin it on  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse three puff daddy  
  
Now you can pump this in your jeep on an off road  
Pump this to your blows on the way to the tow  
Bang this til youre bein old when you at home  
On the sixfour sittin on chrome  
Yo we dont stall we ball while you playin the wall  
We in the middle of the danceflo gettin off  
Gotta bunch of hot chicks gettin live with us  
At the end of the night they gonna slide with us  
I could tell yall the rest but its obvious  
To the top now ride with us cmon  
We dont stop we run the game we dont watch  
Every single region we own blocks  
Never let up you tell me who do it better  
Every single I drop at least two are better  
The song aint the wrong when the party is hot  
Yall dont really want us to stop do you
