You know nothins gettin done when talk is all you hear  
Like someone revvin up a truck never put in gear  
But you dont see a cowboy run his mouth and strut around  
He just takes the bull by the horns and throws him to the ground  
Takin care of business not just puttin on a show  
When it gets down to it everybody knows  
  
It aint the smoke its the fire that gets the burnin done  
If it wasnt for the bullet nobodyd fear the gun  
It aint the bark it aint the growl its the bite that hurts  
Thunders just a noise boys lightnin does the work  
  
You can talk about the farm or you can plow the ground  
Argue with a rusty nail or hammer it on down  
You can stand there in the dark cussin at the night  
Or you can just reach out your hand and turn on the light  
There aint no limit in this life to how far you can get  
But if youre goin all the way you gotta break a sweat  
  
It aint the smoke its the fire that gets the burnin done  
If it wasnt for the bullet nobodyd fear the gun  
It aint the bark it aint the growl its the bite that hurts  
Thunders just a noise boys lightnin does the work  
  
Ive heard thunder talkin up a storm  
Rattlin my windows and knockin on my door  
But Ive seen lightnin blow a cypress tree in half  
The thunders busy talkin and lightnins kickin  
  
It aint the smoke its the fire that gets the burnin done  
If it wasnt for the bullet nobodyd fear the gun  
It aint the bark it aint the growl its the bite that hurts  
Thunders just a noise boys lightnin does the work  
Thunders just a noise boys lightnin does the work  
  
Ahh yeah  
Gonna getcha  
Getcha good
