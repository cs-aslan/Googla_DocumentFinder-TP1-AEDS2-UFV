In line in line its all in line  
My ducks are all in a row  
They do not change they do not move  
They have nowhere to go  
Ive been talking to a friend of mine  
He says making moneys just a waste of time  
Hes a lazy gent he dont pay no rent  
Hes all bent out of shape from living in a tent  
Its hard to hear what he has to say cause Everyone around me is just the same
way  
More more Daddy gimme some  
Gimme some more more Daddy gimme some more  
  
Some kind of funny looking money machine it is Saddest looking people that
Ive ever seen  
Living in a hole body and soul  
Strung out on the company dole  
One for a nickel and two for a dime  
Time may be money but your money wont buy time  
  
In line in line its all in a line  
My ducks are all in a row  
They do not shift they do not move  
They have nowhere to go  
  
Me and my flea we were down by the water  
Fell in a hole with Supermans daughter  
Living alone chewing on a bone  
Pretty as homemade sin  
She had to be high by the look in her eye  
Her hands were wet and her mouth was dry  
The sun on the moon the sun on the moon  
The sun on the moon made a mighty nice light  
Bow wow wow honk your horn  
  
In line in line its all in a line  
My ducks are all in a row  
They do not shift they do not move  
They have nowhere to go  
Sometimes Im hungry  
I dont know what to do  
You can take a taco to Katama too
