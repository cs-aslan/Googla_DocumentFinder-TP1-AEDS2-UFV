You could shoot off a cannon  
Down the middle of bond  
And attract no attention in downtown st Johns  
This getting nowhere is getting to me  
Wondering where can you go  
To be all you can be  
  
No regular joe wants to pull up and go  
And wind up homesick  
Where theres no one you know  
Just a smoke and a beer  
And the sports on tv  
Being sorry you left  
With no choice but to leave  
  
Chorus  
No change in the weather  
No change in me  
I dont want to leave  
But I cant live for free  
Cant eat the air cant drink the sea  
No change in the weather  
No change in me  
  
You could shoot off a cannon  
From the top of longs hill  
And a gullivers taxi might be all that youd kill  
We were promised the sun  
And the moon and the stars  
We got weathered old clapboard and saltrusted cars  
  
So Ill join in the leaving like all of the rest  
Montreal calgary vancouver west  
Lay down on the sidewalk  
Kick off and die  
And watch people not looking  
As they hurry by  
  
Chorus
