Pete Townshend various dates  
The people keep repeatin  
The children follow along  
Everybody keeps from changin  
And you could say you did enough  
Let my love open your door 3x  
To your heart  
Let my love open the door 2x  
When everything feels all over  
Everybody seems unkind  
Ill give you a fourleaf clover  
Take all worries out of your mind  
Let my love open your door 3x  
To your heart  
Let my love open the door  
To your heart  
Let my love open the door  
Have the only key to your heart  
I can stop you from fallin apart  
Tried to say in my own way  
Somebody give me the chance to say  
Let my love open your door  
Its all Im lookin for  
And erase yourself from misery  
Theres only one thing thats gonna set you free  
When trouble really falls you  
Dont let it tie you down  
Love can cure your problems  
Youre so lucky Im around  
Let my love open your door 3x  
To your heart  
Let my love open the door  
To your heart  
Let my love open the door 5x  
Ohto your heart  
Ohbaby I know I said I said I said I said I said I said  
I said I said I said I said I said I said  
Ohna na nalet my love open the door  
Let my love 2x
