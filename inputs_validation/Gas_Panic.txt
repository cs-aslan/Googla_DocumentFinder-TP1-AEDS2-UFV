What tongueless ghost of sin crept through my curtains  
Sailing on a sea of sweat on a stormy night  
I think he dont got a name but I cant be certain  
And in me he starts to confide  
  
That my family dont seem so familiar  
And my enemies all know my name  
And if you hear me tap on your window  
Better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way  
  
My pulse pumps out a beat to the ghost dancer  
My eyes are dead and my throats like a black hole  
And if theres a god would he give another chancer  
An hour to sing for his soul  
  
cause my family dont seem so familiar  
And my enemies all know my name  
And when you hear me tap on yer window  
Yer better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way  
  
cause my family dont seem so familiar  
And my enemies all know my name  
And when you hear me tap on yer window  
Then you get on your knees and you better pray  
cause my family dont seem so familiar  
And my enemies all know my name  
And when you hear me tap on your window  
Yer better get on yer knees and pray  
Panic is on the way  
Panic is on the way
