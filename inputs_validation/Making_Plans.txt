You say tomorrow youre going  
Thats so hard for me to believe  
Im making plans for the heartaches  
Cause youre making plans to leave  
The tears for me will be falling  
Like a tree shedding its leaves  
Im making plans for the teardrops  
Cause youre making plans to leave  
Youre making plans to forget me  
Im making plans to miss you  
Im getting ready to grieve  
Im making plans to be lonesome  
Cause youre making plans to leave  
Im making plans to be lonesome  
Cause youre making plans to leave  
Im making plans to be lonesome  
Cause youre making plans to leave
