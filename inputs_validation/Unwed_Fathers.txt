In an Appalachian Greyhound station  
She sits there waiting in a family way  
Goodbye brother Tell Mom I love her  
Tell all the others Ill write someday  
Chorus  
From an teenage lover to an unwed mother  
Kept undercover like some bad dream  
While unwed fathers they cant be bothered  
They run like water through a mountain stream  
In a cold and gray town a nurse says Lay down  
This aint no playground and this aint home  
Someones children out having children  
In a gray stone building all alone  
On somewhere else bound Smokey Mountain Greyhound  
She bows her head down hummin lullabies  
Your daddy never meant to hurt you ever  
He just dont live here but youve got his eyes  
Chorus  
Well they run like water  
Through a mountain stream
