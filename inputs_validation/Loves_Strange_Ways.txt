When passion shines her blinding light on you  
You know my friend theres nothing that you can really do  
Just follow on behind her veil of deepest purple haze  
Down to loves strange ways  
  
Drowning in a laughter as you go  
Intoxicating laughter that spins you high and low  
Dangerous times are these but oh so wonderfully new  
Laugh along you fool cant you theyre laughing at you  
Lost in the haze  
Of loves strange ways  
  
Aint it funny how it turns  
When its all over nothings learned  
Just a passion and a fool  
And a memory that burns  
And thats what you get  
When you play with loves strange ways
