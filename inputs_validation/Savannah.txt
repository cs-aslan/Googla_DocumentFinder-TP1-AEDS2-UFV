A day not to forget  
The machine has collapsed under the program its been given  
Look inside the broken shell  
Look inside the broken shell  
To see the broken heart  
They cant believe the machine was alive but we saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
  
We saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
We saw it bleed  
  
The machine it falls apart and when its cut it bleed  
The machine bleeds  
The machine bleeds  
The machine bleeds  
The machine bleeds  
The machine bleeds  
The machine bleeds  
She was alive
