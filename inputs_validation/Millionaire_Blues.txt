I woke up this morning my Jacuzzi wouldnt work  
Then the butler quit on me man can you believe it Jerk  
Mustve been my artistic temperament he couldnt take  
How come nobody wants to give me a break  
  
I got the blues right there mean and low  
Im as low as the heels of my alligator shoes  
You should know how it feels to have these millionaire blues  
Millionaire blues  
  
Well I found one of my bathrooms and I made it to the sink  
I called one of my managers up and I poured myself a drink  
Oh I swear Id kill that little weasel if I could  
Checked myself in the mirror my hair was looking good but  
  
I had the blues right there mean and mean and mean and low  
As low as the heels on my alligator shoes  
You should know how it feels to have these millionaire blues  
Millionaire blues  
Get down  
  
Well so much for breakfast I couldnt face lunch  
I thought Id raise my spirits with a little champagne brunch  
I take the Lamborghini the flunky parks the car  
Can you believe it man this other monkey wont let me in the bar  
  
I said I said Dont you know who I am man  
And he says No no Can you believe it  
Im as low as the heels of these alligator shoes  
You should know how it feels to have these millionaire blues  
Millionaire blues to have these millionaire blues millionaire blues  
  
Bad bad  
Thats bad Yeah  
So hard  
Its hard sometimes for a boy  
  
Ah I like that  
Thats good  
Get down  
Youre making a very big mistake man  
  
Oh yeah  
Youll never work in this town again  
All right
