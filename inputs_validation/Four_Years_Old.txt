Hey  
Whyd you wake me from my nap  
Im not in the mood  
To play your games  
Or sit on your lap  
  
You  
Wheres my Yankees drinking glass  
I want some juice  
And I want it now  
So you better move your ass  
And feel bad for me  
Cause Im just getting over a cold  
  
Im four years old  
Im four years old  
Im four years old  
Somebody better tie my shoes  
  
Now  
I run down the hall  
I scream and I yell  
And I cry cause I fell  
Bring the rubbing alcohol  
  
Outside  
I get mud on my shoe  
I come back in the house  
I get it on the rug  
The cleangings up to you  
And I wont take a bath  
Unless you make me SpaghettiOs  
  
Im four years old  
Im four years old  
Im four years old  
Mommy reads to me at night  
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  
  
Well  
I cant have a job  
And I cant go to school  
If no grownups are around  
I cant go near the pool  
Im not alowed to climb  
My neighbors apple tree  
Im not allowed to sit  
Too close to the TV  
I dont know how to drive  
And I dont know how to spell  
But if I hear my brother cursing  
I do know how to tell  
cause he made me eat some bread  
That was covered in mold  
  
Im four years old  
Im four years old  
Im four years old  
I just threw up on my grandmother
