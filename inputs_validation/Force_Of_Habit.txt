Too much coffees gonna shatter my nerves  
Too much whiskeys gonna stutter my words  
A whole lotta speed gonna take me to fast  
How much longer can I last  
  
Too many women gonna put me to waste  
Too much money gonna spoil my taste  
Doctor says to slow down if you want to stay alive  
How am I gonna survive I want to know  
I want to know I want to know I want to know oh yea  
Been working to hard dont got no time to rest  
Dont look to well I aint feeling my best  
Cant push much harder before I fall on the ground  
Im gonna have a nervous breakdown  
  
Ive gotta slow down  
Get my feet on the ground yeah  
I better slow down fast  
Today could be my last all right
