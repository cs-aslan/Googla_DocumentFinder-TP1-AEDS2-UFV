Dont let me find you  
Sleepin with another man  
Say youre gonna be true  
And stay and love me like you can  
Cause I really love you and its true  
Im gonna love you rain or come shine  
  
Honey wont you tell me  
You dont want nobody else  
Dont you tear my heart out  
And lay it on your shelf  
  
Cause I really love you and its true  
Im gonna love you rain or come shine  
  
And Im gonna love you gonna love you  
Rain or come shine rain or come shine  
You know youre gonna find me gonna find me  
Around you all the time time  
  
Cause I really love you and its true  
Im gonna love you rain or come shine  
Rain or come shine rain or come shine  
Rain or come shine rain or come shine  
Rain or come shine rain or come shine
