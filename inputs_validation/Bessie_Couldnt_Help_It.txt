Bessie couldnt help it  
Bessie couldnt help it  
Bessie couldnt help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
Bessie couldnt help it though she tried to be good  
Oh so good  
She was pretty as the heavens above  
Oh boy but how she could love  
Bessie had affection that was simply wonderful terrible  
But Bessie couldnt help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
When she smiled you were bound to fall thats all  
A boy kissed Bessie in the parlor one night  
Why oh why did she yell with delight  
Cause Bessie couldnt help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
Aww dumb pe dumb now people listen  
Bessie couldnt help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
No Bessie couldnt help it though she tried to be good  
Oh so good  
She was pretty as the heavens above  
And oh boy how that girl could love  
Bessie had affection that was simply wonderful  
Bop bop be de oww  
Bessie couldnt help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
Now when she smiled you were bound to fall thats all boy  
Boy kissed Bessie in the street one night  
My oh my how she yelled with delight  
Bessie couldnt help it any more  
Than you could or I could
