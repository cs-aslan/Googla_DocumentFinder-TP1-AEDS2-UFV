Just as I expected here you are back at my door  
Telling me the things you aint gonna do no more  
And just as I expected you wanna love me again  
Id like to help you out way which way did you come in  
Im not the type of girl thats gonna let you down  
Ill point the right direction to get you out of town  
And if you need a guiding hand to find the road to sin  
Id like to help you out way which way did you come in  
 dobro   
Well if you think youll get your kicks by hanging around  
Well honey heres a kick that I help you cover ground  
And what dont you just take yourself go back to where youve been  
Id like to help you out way which way did you come in  
Im not the type of girl  
Id like to help you out way which way did you come in
