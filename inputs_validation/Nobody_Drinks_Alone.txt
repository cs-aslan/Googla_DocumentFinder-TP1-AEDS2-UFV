You brought that bottle home in a paper sack  
Drew the blinds and locked the doors  
And theres nothing but empty there inside that glass  
So you pour a little more  
And theres no one there to judge you  
At least thats what you tell yourself but  
  
Chorus  
Dont you know  
Nobody drinks alone  
Every demon every ghost  
From your past  
And every memory youve held back  
Follows you home  
Nobody drinks alone  
  
You remember whiskey on your daddys breath  
So you always stick to wine  
And you scared your little brother half to death  
You just kept it all inside  
You can hear your mama cryin  
Only now she cries for you and  
  
Chorus  
  
Though youre only  
Hey dont you let that feelin fool ya  
  
Chorus  
  
Nobody drinks alone
