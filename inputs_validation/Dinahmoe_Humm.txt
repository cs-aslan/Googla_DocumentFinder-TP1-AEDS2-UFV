Dinahmoe  
I couldnt say where shes coming from  
But I just met a lady named dinahmoe  
She stroll on over say look here bum  
I got a forty dollar bill say you cant make me cum  
  
She made a bet with her sister whos a little dumb  
She could prove it any time all men was scum  
I dont mind that she called me a bum  
But I knew right away she was really gonna cum so I got down to it  
  
I whipped off her bloomers and stiffened my thumb and applied rotation on her
sugar plum  
I poked and stroked till my wrist got numb  
But I still didnt hear no dinahmoe  
  
Chorus  
Dinahmoe humm  
Dinahmoe humm  
Dinahmoe humm  
Where this dinahmoe coming from  
  
Done spent three hours  
An I aint got a crumb  
From the dinahmoe  
Dinahmoe  
Dinahmoe  
From the dinahmoe humm  
  
I got a spot that gets me hot  
But you aint been to it  
I got a spot that gets me hot  
But you aint been to it  
  
I got a spot that gets me hot  
But you aint been to it  
I got a spot that gets me hot  
But you aint been to it  
  
Cause I cant get into it  
Unless I get out of it  
And I gotta get out of it  
Before I get into it  
  
Cause I never get into it  
Unless I get out of it  
An I gotta be out of it  
To get myself into it  
  
Just get me wasted  
And youre halfway there  
Cause if my minds tore up  
Then my body dont care  
  
I rubbed my chinnychinchin  
An said mymymy  
What sort of thing  
Might this lady get high upon  
  
I checked out her sister  
Who was holding the bet  
And wondered what kind of trip  
The young lady was on  
The forty dollar bill didnt matter no more  
When her sister got naked and laid on the floor  
  
She said dinahmoe might win the bet  
But she could use a little if I wasnt done yet I told her  
Just because the sun  
Want a place in the sky  
  
No reason to assume  
I wouldnt give her a try  
So I pulled on her hair  
Got her legs in the air  
  
And asked if she had any cooties on there  
  
She was bunsup kneeling  
Buns up  
I was wheeling an dealing  
Wheeling and dealing an  
She surrendered to the feeling  
She sweetly surrendered  
An she started in to squealing  
  
Dinahmoe watched from the edge of the bed  
With her lips just atwitching an her face gone red  
Some drool rolling down  
From the edge of her chin  
While she spied the condition  
Her sister was in  
  
She quivered and quaked  
And clutched at herself  
While her sister made a joke  
About her mental health  
  
Till dinahmoe finally  
Did give in  
But I told her  
All she really needed  
Was some discipline  
  
Kiss my aura  
Dora  
Mmm  
Its real angora  
Would yall like some morea  
  
Right here on the flora  
An how bout you fauna  
Why want to  
Mmmsound like why might be choking on something did you say you want some
more  
Well heres some more  
  
Mmm surelisten  
Do you think I could interest you  
In a pair of zirconencrusted tweezers mmmtweezers  
Here lemme sterilize em  
Gimme your lighter  
  
I couldnt say where shes coming from  
But I just met a lady named dinahmoe  
She stroll on over say look here bum  
I got a forty dollar bill say you cant make me cum  
  
I whipped off her bloomers and stiffened my thumb an applied rotation on her
sugar plum  
I poked and stroked till my wrist got numb  
An you know I heard some  
  
Chorus
