Birds fly they dont think twice  
They simply spread their wings  
The sun shines it dont ask why  
Or what the whole thing means  
  
The same applies to you and I  
We never question that  
So good its just understood  
Aint no conjecture  
Just a matter of fact  
  
Chorus  
Love is a wonderful thing  
Make ya smile through the pouring rain  
Love is a wonderful thing  
Ill say it again and again  
Turn your world into one sweet dream  
Take your heart and make it sing  
Love love is a wonderful thing  
  
The only thing a river knows  
Is runnin to the sea  
And every spring when a flower grows  
It happens naturally  
  
The same magic when youre in my arms  
No logic can define  
Dont know why just feels so right  
I only know it happens every time  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh when the cold wind blows  
I know youre gonna be there to warm me  
Thats what keeps me goin  
And our sweet love will keep on growin  
  
Chorus  
  
Love is a wonderful wonderful thing  
Love is a wonderful wonderful thing  
Its what makes honey taste sweet  
Its what makes your life complete
