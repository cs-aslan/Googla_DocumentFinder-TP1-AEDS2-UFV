Lately I dont know where I went wrong  
But the spell of that pretty young girl is far too strong  
Between her fine perfume and angel face  
My whole world became another place  
The dark side of her intelligence was so strong  
Soon therell be no difference in right or wrong  
Next thing I know I had a key that unlocked her door  
I could not wait to hear the siren song  
The beginning of the end of my happy home  
Sailin sailing cross the devils sea oooh hooo  
too blind in love too blind to see  
Heard them say the paybacks doublefold  
Just cant seem to remember who I bought and sold  
Ill probably still be here when you come around next year  
Trying to climb from this deep dark hole  
Ill be damned if I just dont feel Im growin old  
Sailing sailing cross the devils sea ohhh hooo  
Too blind in love too blind to see  
Cause she was eviler than evil slippery like a fox  
set me up with pain and woe and I swear it wont seem to stop  
If I could just remove her hook from deep from within my soul  
Swear Ill leave and not come back just let me out that door  
Sailin sailing cross the devils sea ohhh hooo  
Too blind in love too blind to see
