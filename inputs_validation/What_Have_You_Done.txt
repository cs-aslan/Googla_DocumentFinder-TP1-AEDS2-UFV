Would you mind if I hurt you  
Understand that I need to  
Wish that I had other choices  
Than to harm the one I love  
What have you done now  
I know Id better stop trying  
You know that theres no denying  
I wont show mercy on you now  
I know I should stop believing  
I know theres no retrieving  
Its over now what have you done  
What have you done now  
I Ive been waiting for someone like you  
But now you are slipping away  
What have you done now  
Why why does fate make us suffer  
Theres a curse between us between me and you  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done now  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done now  
Would you mind if I killed you  
Would you mind if I tried to  
Cause you have  
Turned into my worst enemy  
You carry hate that I dont feel  
Its over now what have you done  
What have you done now  
I Ive been waiting for someone like you  
But now you are slipping away  
What have you done now  
Why why does fate make us suffer  
Theres a curse between us between me and you  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done now  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done now  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done  
What have you done  
I will not fall wont let it go  
We will be free when it ends  
I Ive been waiting for someone like you  
But now you are slipping away  
What have you done now  
Why why does fate make us suffer  
Theres a curse between us between me and you  
Ive been waiting for someone like you  
But now you are slipping away  
What have you done now  
Why why does fate make us suffer  
Theres a curse between us between me and you
