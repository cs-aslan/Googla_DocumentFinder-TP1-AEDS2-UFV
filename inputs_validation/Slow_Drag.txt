Slow drag of a cigarette  
Slow drag and Im lying in my bed  
All the world is sleeping like a baby tonight  
I wanna lay you down in the ground alright  
Slow drag and I cant get up now  
Slow drag youve been messing with my mind  
  
And all the world is sleeping like a baby tonight  
I wanna see you dead in the muddy ground  
Youre nothing to me  
Youre nothing to me  
Youre nothing to me no more  
Youre nothing to me  
Nothing to me  
Nothing to me no more  
  
And all the world is sleeping like a baby tonight  
I wanna see you dead in the muddy ground  
Youre nothing to me  
Youre nothing to me  
Youre nothing to me no more  
Youre nothing to me  
Nothing to me  
Nothing to me no more  
  
Aint nothing to me  
Youre nothing to me  
Nothing to me no more  
No more oh  
No more no
