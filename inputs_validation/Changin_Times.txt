When I was younger I used to understand  
That when youre with a girl you gotta act like a man  
Mama told me thats the way it should be  
And I know my mama never lied to me  
  
What do you think about youre changin times  
Cause when Im with you I just cant make up my mind  
Since I met you dont know right from wrong  
Somebody tell me just whats goin on  
  
Just cant get myself thinkin straight  
Im all shook up and in a terrible state  
Sometimes I think I got it all figured out  
Then you do something new and it just knocks me right out  
  
Someday baby Im going to have to make a stand  
The way that you treat me baby  
Dont make me feel too much like a man  
And baby baby the changes youre goin through  
Youre drivin me half crazy  
Cant make up my mind what to do about you  
  
Tellin myself that time is on my side  
Youre gettin this feelin that my minds on the slide  
Dumped on the floor I feel Im trapped in a spin  
Dont know how to end cant think of where to begin  
  
She dont care I know she dont even try  
But when she turns it on  
You know she gets me so high  
  
Shes a lady thats making my life a sin  
You know that Im runnin in a losin race  
There aint no way I can win  
Baby baby the changes youre goin through  
Theyre drivin me half crazy  
Cant make up my mind what to do about you
