I can still remember yesterday  
We were so in love in a special way  
And knowing that you loved me  
Made me feel oh so right  
  
But now I feel lost dont know what to do  
Each and every day I think of you  
Holdin back the tears  
Im trying with all my might  
  
Because youve gone and left me standing  
All alone  
And I know Ive got to face tomorrow  
On my own  
  
Before I let you go  
I want to say I love you  
I hope that youre listnin  
Coz its true baby  
  
Youll be forever in my heart  
And I know that no one else will do  
So before I let you go  
I want to say itI love you  
  
I wish that It could be just like before  
I know I coulve given you so much more  
Even though you know  
Id given you all my love  
  
I miss your smile I miss your kiss  
Each and every day I reminisce  
Coz baby its you  
That im always dreaming of  
  
Because youve gone and left me standing  
All alone  
And I know Ive got to face tomorrow  
On my own  
  
Before I let you go  
I want to say I love you  
I hope that youre listnin  
Cause its true baby  
  
Youll be forever in my heart  
And I know that no one else will do  
So before I let you go  
I want to say itI love you  
  
Letting love go  
Is never easy  
But I love you so  
Thats why I set you free  
  
I know someday  
Somehow Ill find a way  
To leave it all behind me  
Guess it wasnt meant to be  
  
But baby  
  
Before I let you go  
I want to say I love you  
I hope that youre listnin  
Cause its true baby  
  
Youll be forever in my heart  
And I know that no one else will do  
So before I let you go  
I want to say itI love you
