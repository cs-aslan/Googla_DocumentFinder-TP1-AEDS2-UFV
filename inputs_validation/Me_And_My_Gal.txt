The bells are ringing  
For me and my gal  
The birds are singing  
For me and my gal  
Everybodys been knowing  
To a wedding their going  
And for weeks theyve been sewing  
Every Suzie and Sal  
Theyre congregating  
For me and my gal  
The parsons waiting  
For me and my gal  
And sometime Im going to build  
A little home for two  
For three or four or more  
In Loveland for me and my gal
