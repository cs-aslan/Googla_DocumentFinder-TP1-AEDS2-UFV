Oh my goodness  
What have I done oh no  
I cant believe it  
Its like Ive got the whole world  
In my palm  
And Im ready to drop bombs  
  
Welcome to the slim shady mecca Rebbecca  
Its the village in New York right next to the Tribeca  
Its my sector homosexual dissector  
Come again rewind selector  
I said nice rectum  
I had a vasectomy Hector  
So you cant get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya  
Hannibal Lector in the guy sex and I bet ya  
I tantalize ya in the less than five seconds I get ya  
They said once bitten n twice shy  
We lie next to the guy  
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra  
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yes sir  
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills for my dresser  
Its my kinda vibe what else should I try Lester  
Drop kick the bits before a second trimester  
Performed a home abortion with Dexter the ni yeser  
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanging then digest her  
  
Chorus  
I guess its time for you to hate me again  
Lets begin now hand me the pin  
How should I begin it and were does it all end  
The world is just my medicine ball your all in  
I said  
I guess its time for you to hate me again  
Lets begin now hand me the pin  
How should I begin it and were does it all end  
My medicine ball your in my medicine ball friends  
  
All my west side bitches throw it up  
Put a balloon inside your pussy queef and blow it up  
Man I think that he just fell off the teeth and showin up  
So you better change the station  
To keep from throwin up  
Man you seen it all before your alter a million with it  
Theres a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it  
You know you with it girl dont front oh no you didnt  
I won right by the Pussy Cat Dolls When call you kitten  
Ill pee on Rihanna see man I do what I wanna  
Spray perfume in the sauna room  
Crazy glue in Madonna to  
The lazy boy so called fold her in two and sit on her  
Imagine if visual for that man  
Who woulda thought  
Could ever be such a relentless prick  
And leashin his fingers  
For the chicks who waltz  
She looks like she outlived her life sentence  
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive  
If you werent so defensive it wouldnt be  
Your so sensitive  
  
Chorus  
  
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand  
Kick it up and push him and knee him right into quick sand  
Here you need a hand big man grab hold of this branch  
With both hands man they dont understand Im just a sick man  
Now everybodys pissed at me like its my fault his name rhymes with so many
different words jeez  
So one last time Mister Christopher Reeves  
Wont you break it down for me and just spit the first please  
Chrisopher Reeves Eminem Im coming to kill you sniff  
Always hated you and I still do  
Youll never feel my chumps my superman costume sniff  
Doesnt even fit you they dont feel you  
You taking this shit too far sniff  
Who do you think you are hang my suit up in the armoir  
Everyday I hate you more and more  
Throw down the cardboard  
Lets break down you think your hardcore  
  
Chorus
