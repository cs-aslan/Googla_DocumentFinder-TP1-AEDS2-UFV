I know everyone on  
This planet wished that they had you  
I feel so blessed baby  
Listen now that I got you  
I know every man  
Probably told you that he loved you  
This aint ordinary love song  
No this aint no ordinary love song  
So Imma say it in the stadium scream  
It like an anthem  
Say it from the mountain top  
Sing it like a favourite song  
Imma put my cards on the table for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause I love you eh  
And Baby theres nothing in the world  
That I wont do for you  
Oh I love you oh  
I gotta tell you about a million trillion times  
Baby youre the best thing in my life  
  
Put your hand on my heart  
Cant you feel that boom boom boom  
Only one reason that it beats is for you  
In this love game baby I play the fool  
  
This is no ordinary love song  
No this aint no ordinary love song  
So Imma say it in the stadium  
Scream it like a love song  
Say it from the mountain top  
Sing it like a favourite song  
Imma put my cards on the table for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause I love you eh  
And Baby theres nothing in the world  
That I wont do for you  
Oh I love you oh  
I gotta tell you about a million trillion times  
Baby youre the best thing in my life  
  
For once in my life  
Once in my life  
I can see it clearly  
Cause you open my eyes  
For once in my life  
Once in my life  
Im that in my mind  
Youre the only one for me  
Baby cant you see Oh oh oh oh  
Im so oh oh oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause I love you eh  
And Baby theres nothing in the world  
That I wont do for you  
Oh I love you oh  
I gotta tell you about a million trillion times  
Baby youre the best thing in my life
