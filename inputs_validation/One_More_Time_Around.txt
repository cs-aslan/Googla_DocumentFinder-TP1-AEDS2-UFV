Well its concrete and asphalt drivin into work every day  
This livin cant be healthy but the Lord knows I got bills to pay  
And theres others here just like me they got families to feed  
  
Chorus  
One more time arouund time around on the job is where Ill be found  
One more time arouund time around earn my pay and hear that whistle sound  
  
Well thunder and lighting it dont matter nothin stops the clock  
The radios are blastin mine is playin country some play rock  
The rhythm and blues of the workplace we take pride in everything we make  
  
Chorus  
  
Five oclock is comin were all racin down the same track  
Life is a circle sometimes we meet ourselves comin back well  
  
Chorus  
  
One more time around  
Time around time around  
Time around time around  
Time around time around  
Time around
