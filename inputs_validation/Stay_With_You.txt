Weve been together for a while now  
Were growing stronger everyday now  
It feels so good and theres no doubt  
I will stay with you as each morning brings sunrise  
And the flowers bloom in springtime  
On my love you can rely  
And Ill stay with you  
  
Oh Ill stay with you through the ups and the downs  
Oh Ill stay with you when no one else is around  
And when the dark clouds arise  
I will stay by your side  
I know well be alright  
I will stay with you  
  
Though relationships can get old  
They had a tendency to grow cold  
We have something like miracle  
Yeah Ill stay with you  
  
Oh Ill stay with you through the ups and the downs  
Oh Ill stay with you when no one else is around  
And when the dark clouds arise  
I will stay by your side  
I know well be alright  
I will stay with you  
  
And there will be heartaches and pains yes it will  
But through it all we will remain  
In this life we all know  
Friends may come they may go  
Through the years I know  
I will stay  
And in the end I know that well find  
Love so beautiful and divine  
Well be lovers for a lifetime yeah  
And Ill stay with you  
I will stay with you  
  
Oh Ill stay with you through the ups and the downs  
Oh Ill stay with you when no one else is around  
And when the dark clouds arise  
I will stay by your side  
I know well be alright  
I will stay with you  
Everything will be fine  
And I will stay with you  
Through the end of time  
I will stay with you
