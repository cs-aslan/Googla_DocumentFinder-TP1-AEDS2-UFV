Act sleazy  
Behave like a tart  
Its so easy  
To get what you want  
  
Yeah  
You cant get enough  
  
Hey baby  
We all know your name  
Its sex  
That will lead you to fame  
  
Dont Dont Dont Give it up  
Dont Dont Die of a broken heart  
  
Your ego  
Is never at fault  
If you believe it  
Youll get all you want  
  
Yeah  
You cant get enough  
  
Dont Dont Die of a broken heart  
  
I feel your pulse  
Beating blue  
And I feel your skin crawls  
When we we we we  
Fuck  
  
Dont Dont Die of a broken heart
