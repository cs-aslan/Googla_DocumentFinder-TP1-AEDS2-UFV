Were the pilgrim fathers  
You may have heard rather  
A lot bout our notions  
Crossing the ocean  
On the good ship Mayflower  
But its true our journey  
Turned into quite a commotion  
  
People report that we sported these hats  
But thats not true I mean would you  
Anyway the main thing to say  
We began the usa  
Our little band of religion fans  
From the East Midlands  
  
We all believed slowly  
That England was becoming less holy  
So set off for Holland  
Cause there we had friends  
But in the end seemed the Netherlands  
Would never be the land we planned  
  
Couldnt stand to remain on that terrain  
So again we rearranged  
To start a new nation with our congregation  
A new and calmer life took a farmer and a builder and his wife  
And a clerica to find America  
  
Oh its a new world  
It wasnt new to the natives  
Still we thought wed claim it  
Yeah its the new world  
  
I still remember 9th of November  
The year 1620 and we saw plenty of land  
We thanked God when we found ground  
I kept calm but it didnt go as planned  
  
Couldnt land on the sand  
A month later though we made it  
New Plymouth man we claimed it  
The natives said not  
But ran when we shot  
  
Moved there it proved yeah  
That life would be tough  
Cause we didnt have enough  
Of the right stuff  
Did you know had no seeds we could grow  
Although William Mullins had stacked  
126 pairs of shoes in his pack  
Now thats whack  
  
A fishing rod a plough  
A pig or a cow  
Would have been a much better idea  
But now theres no food for us to eat  
Does this mean that well meet with de feet  
  
No fun in the new world  
Im glad weve arrived here  
But will we survive here  
Yeah in the new world  
  
People were staving  
Our numbers halving  
And when the winter winds blew  
Even fewer live through  
It wasnt pretty in our new city  
But the natives took pity even though  
They didnt have to  
  
Man called Squanto  
Showed us how to grow maize  
Catch eel for a meal  
Build shelter in the baze  
Tribe gave us a feast  
Our starvation ceased  
What they had done  
Turned us back from the dead  
To the living and to this day  
Thats why we have thanksgiving  
  
In Massachusetts built a colony its true  
They say modern America was founded by our crew  
Its a new world  
But we cant call it England  
Lets call it New England  
Yeah in the world  
  
My home was in Plymouth  
Lets call it New Plymouth  
I got an idea lets call this New Hampshire  
Wait Im from Newcastle  
Can we call it New Newcastle  
Nah  
Its a new world
