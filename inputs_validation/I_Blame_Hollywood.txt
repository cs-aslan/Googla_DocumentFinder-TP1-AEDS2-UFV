Frankly my dear I dont give a damn  
I wish thats how I felt  
I just cant hide the fool that I am  
As I let you walk away into the sunset  
Its just another famine  
I try to do the right thing  
I ended up with nothing good  
  
I blame Hollywood  
  
I tried to be strong to be brave to behave like a hero hero  
I tried to be tough to be cool to be smooth like De Niro De Niro  
But it hurts without you  
And I look like a fool  
And I dont have a clue what to say when love breaks down  
Cause this aint Tinseltown  
  
I made a mistake  
I got confused  
Its easy to forget  
Cause this is real life  
With so much to lose  
When I let you walk away into the sunset  
I wasnt brokenhearted  
Itd be a happy ending but  
I ended up with nothing good  
  
And I blame Hollywood  
  
I tried to be strong to be brave to behave like a hero hero  
I tried to be tough to be cool to be smooth like De Niro De Niro  
But it hurts without you  
And I look like a fool  
And I dont have a clue what to say when love breaks down  
Cause this aint Tinseltown  
No oh oh  
Tinseltown oh  
Tinseltown no oh oh  
Tinseltown  
  
I fell for the lines  
You knew that I would  
Hurray for Hollywood  
  
I tried to be strong to be brave to behave like a hero hero  
I tried to be tough to be cool to be smooth like De Niro De Niro  
But it hurts without you  
And I look like a fool  
And I dont have a clue what to say when love breaks down  
Cause this aint Tinseltown
