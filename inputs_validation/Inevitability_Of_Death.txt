Puffy lips glistening skin and everything comes rushing in we dont go to hell
memories of us do  
  
I get a sense of connectedness exclusive tight but nothing dangerous we dont
go to hell memories of us do and if you go to hell  
Ill still remember you  
  
But I thought you beat the death of inevitability to death just a little bit I
though you beat the inevitability of death to death just a  
Little bit  
  
Terrys gift is forever green it got me up and back on the scene we dont got
hell just our memories do  
  
Fantastic gap commom space open concept in your smiling face we dont go to
hell memories of us do  
  
And if you go to hell Ill still remember you
