She never has to stop and think  
Never makes you lose a thing  
She is so enchanting  
I always have to stop a while  
Cross my hands and close my eyes  
I am so demanding  
When she smiles she opens wide  
Touching you inside to lie  
Life can be so shaking handed  
Nervously youre shaking signs  
Life is better taken blind  
Still youre left so disenchanted  
Giving it all away  
Giving it all away  
You always have to stop and think  
Desperately to find something  
That is even handed  
I never want to think a thing  
That shatters almost everything  
Life can leave you hanging  
When she smiles she opens wide  
Touching you inside to lie  
Life can be so shaking handed  
Nervously youre shaking signs  
Life is better taken blind  
Still youre left so disenchanted  
Giving it all away  
Giving it all away  
Today new day  
Im so tired of flown day  
Ive got no one to say  
What is wrong is that you cant say  
When she smiles she opens wide  
Touching you inside to lie  
Life can be so shaking handed  
Nervously youre shaking signs  
Life is better taken blind  
Still youre left so disenchanted  
Giving it all away  
Giving it all away  
Giving it all away  
Giving it all away
