It wasnt much but I sold it all and I moved to San Antone  
Knowing in my heart that Texas had to be my home  
I fell in love with Texas I was happy I was free but Texas never fell in love
with me  
I found out my style just didnt suit the local squirrels  
I found out that I cant fit into a cowboy world  
Im back in Indiana just as lonesome as can be Texas never fell in love with
me  
  
I bought myself a cowboy hat of course it didnt fit  
I bought myself a case of Coors and I used to drink and sip  
I watch the cowgirls come and go Lord dont they love to play  
The one I wanted never came my way  
I found out my style  
Texas never fell in love with me
