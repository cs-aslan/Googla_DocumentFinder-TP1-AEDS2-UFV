The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
  
As I watch the world as it keeps spinning round  
And try to figure out whats going down  
With so much joy and love in demand  
Why cant we get it right and understand  
  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
  
Look at the faces out there everywhere  
There is a happiness we all can share  
Walk in the sunshine come out the rain  
Its time to face the truth that were all the same  
  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
  
Its so right it cant be wrong  
All you got to do is come along  
Its our time to celebrate  
Tonight its gonna be that way  
  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
The world is a party  
  
Its so right it cant be wrong  
All you got to do is come along  
Its our time to celebrate  
Tonight its gonna be that way  
  
The world is a party The world is a party
