It doesnt matter what car you drive shell wreck it  
It doesnt matter where you sleep at night shell wreck it  
It doesnt matter where you go to work  
Doesnt matter where you go to church  
Doesnt matter just how bad it hurts shell wreck it  
  
My bleached bones in the desert its all shes left of me  
  
Poison ivy in your touch being with you destroyed so much

Deadly venom in your kiss hell cant be worse than this  
Home wrecker  
  
It doesnt matter what you pretend shell wreck it  
It doesnt matter what you defend shell wreck it  
It doesnt matter how you live your life  
Doesnt matter anymore to your wife  
Doesnt matter even how you die shell wreck that too  
  
Like a vulture picking my bones clean its all thats left of me  
  
Poison ivy in your touch being with you destroyed so much
