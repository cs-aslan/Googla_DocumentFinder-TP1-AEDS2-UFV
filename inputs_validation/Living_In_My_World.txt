Living in my world  
  
So many riffs you have with your girl  
But Im here to hear all your problems and tell you I understand  
Falling in and out of love with her now As I watch all I can see Is you
being with me  
I know you feel like a fool being used paying dues  
Afraid of your loving is taken advantage of  
You dont have to live a life full of strife take my hand and ill be the
leader  
You can depend on me  
  
Chorus  
You can be living in my world sharing my time being the one  
Stare in the face of love long enough to see  
You can be living in my world youll never shed another tear  
And ill never stop the love Ill give you all of me  
  
With open eyes and ears I can hear hear your crys come from the inside  
But baby its alright you can just let it go Im your friend  
Sitting here willing to listen Oh baby see that you dont have to live  
Like you do come with me be my king ill be by your side  
Just let me know what to do only one goal in mind  
Take your heart share with mine make you believe so you can see that  
  
Chorus  
  
It only takes one look to see  
That shes a fool and you should know  
Come with me and I will be All that you need  
Theres no dreams we cant make real  
And theres no feelings we cant feel  
Im just Wanting you Needing you Dont you know  
  
Chorus
