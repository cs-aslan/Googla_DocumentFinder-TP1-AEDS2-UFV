I couldnt see  
I couldnt hear  
Shut me off when you were near  
Like a cloud  
A dusty mirror  
Disappear you disappear  
  
All of a sudden  
All alone  
Im calling out  
Im calling loves gonna let me know  
Like the day you took me home  
We counted every minute left to go  
My loves gonna let you know  
  
Time without you drags me down  
It all feels right with you around  
It all feels light with you around  
Like that night we hit the ground  
And all the lightning sends a chill  
Cant forget about you still  
All of a sudden all alone  
Im calling out  
Im calling  
  
Loves gonna let me know  
Like the day you took me home  
We counted every minute left to go  
My loves gonna let you know  
  
Calling loves gonna let me know  
Like the day you took me home  
We counted every minute left to go  
My loves gonna let you know  
  
Im calling out Im calling  
Im calling out Im calling  
Im calling out Im calling  
Im calling out Im calling  
Im calling out Im calling out
