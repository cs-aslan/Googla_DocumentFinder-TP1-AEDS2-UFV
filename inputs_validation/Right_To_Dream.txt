I lay awake sometimes  
Scared to close my eyes  
And I wonder where I left myself  
And lost the will to fight  
  
And the night melts into morning  
Still its cold beneath the sun  
Cause the fire in me is languishing  
And Im too frozen to run  
  
And every once in a while  
Theres a distant glimmer of hope  
I find somewhere deep inside  
Someone strong still resides  
And I know shes gonna be fine in time  
  
Cause you see  
Ive got a lot to dream  
Theres more than this for me  
  
An angel lands with broken wings  
He warms me with his eyes  
And the ice thats sheathed around my heart  
Unravels as he smiles  
  
See I grew up locked in sorrow  
So I learn to block the pain  
But I wont give up tomorrow  
Cause Ive come to life again  
  
And every once in a while  
Theres a distant glimmer of hope  
I find somewhere deep inside  
Someone strong still resides  
And I know Im gonna be fine thats right  
  
Cause for real  
Ive got a right to dream  
Theres more than this for me  
  
But I keep goin cause every once in a while  
Theres a distant glimmer of hope  
I find somewhere deep inside  
Someone strong still resides  
And I know shes gonna be fine in time  
  
Cause you see  
Ive got a right to dream  
Theres more than this for me
