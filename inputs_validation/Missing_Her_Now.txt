M Greaves  
  
I was always told that time could heal  
And change the way the brokenhearted feel  
Now I know its not true  
For Im sad and blue  
And Im sure missing her now  
  
When she said goodbye  
I was not sad enough to cry  
The misery Id known  
Would end somehow  
Oh but Im sure missing her now  
  
I always thought the single life would soothe me  
A different girl depending on my mood  
But the dance floor is no place for a lonesome heart  
And Id wind up nailed to a barstool
