Back and forth I sway with the wind  
Resolution slips away again  
right through my fingers back into my heart  
Where its out of reach and its in the dark  
Sometimes I think Im blind  
Or I may just be paralyzed  
Because the plot thickens every day  
And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin away  
But I know theres a picture beneath  
Indecision clouds my vision  
No one listens  
Because Im somewhere in between  
My love and my agony  
You see Im somewhere in between  
My life is falling to pieces  
Somebody put me together  
Layin face down on the ground  
My fingers in my ears to block the sounds  
My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight  
Anticipating the end losing the will to fight  
Droplets of yes and no  
In an ocean of maybe  
From the bottom it looks like a steep incline  
From the top another downhill slope of mine  
But I know the equilibriums there  
Indicision clouds my vision  
No one listens  
Because Im somewhere in between  
My love and my agony  
You see Im somewhere in between  
My life is falling to pieces  
Somebody put me together
