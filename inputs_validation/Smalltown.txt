When youre growing up in a small town  
when youre growing up in a small town  
when youre growing up in a small town  
you say no one famous ever came from here  
  
When youre growing up in a small town  
and youre having a nervous breakdown  
and you think that youll never escape it  
yourself or the place that you live  
  
Where did Picasso come from  
theres no Michelangelo coming from Pittsburgh  
if art is the tip of the iceberg  
Im the part sinking below  
  
When youre growing up in a small town  
bad skin bad eyes gay and fatty  
people look at you funny  
when youre in a small town  
  
My father worked in construction  
its not something for which Im suited  
oh what is something for which you are suited  
getting out of here  
  
I hate being odd in a small town  
if they stare let them stare in New York City  
as this pink eyed painting albino  
how far can my fantasy go  
  
Im no Dali coming from Pittsburgh  
no adorable lisping Capote  
my hero oh do you think I could meet him  
Id camp out at his front door  
  
There is only one good thing about small town  
there is only one good use for a small town  
there is only one good thing about small town  
you know that you want to get out  
  
When youre growing up in a small town  
you know youll grow down in a small town  
there is only one good use for a small town  
  
You hate it and youll know you have to leave
