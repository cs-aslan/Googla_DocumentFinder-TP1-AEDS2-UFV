I feel it in my fingers  
I feel it in my toes  
Love is all around me  
And so the feeling grows  
  
Its written on the wind  
Its everywhere I go  
So if you really love me  
Come on and let it show  
  
You know I love you I always will  
My minds made up by the way that I feel  
Theres no beginning therell be no end  
Cause on my love you can depend  
  
I see your face before me  
As I lay on my bed  
I kinda get to thinking  
Of all the things you said  
  
You gave your promise to me and I gave mine to you  
I need someone beside me in everything I do  
  
You know I love you I always will  
My minds made up by the way that I feel  
Theres no beginning therell be no end  
Cause on my love you can depend  
  
I got to keep it moving  
  
Its written in the wind  
Oh everywhere I go  
So if you really love me love me  
Come on and let it show  
Come on and let it show  
Come on and let it  
Come on and let it  
Come on and let it show  
Come on and let it  
Come on and let it  
Come on and let it show  
Come on and let it show  
Come on and let it show
