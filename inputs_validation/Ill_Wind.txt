Blow ill wind blow away find my love today  
Youre blowin me no good no good  
Go ill wind go away skies are oh so gray  
Around my neighborhood and thats no good  
  
Youre only misleadin the sunshine Im needin  
Aint that a shame  
Its so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up  
From out of nowhere when loves to blame  
  
So ill wind blow away find my love today  
Youre blowin me no good no good no good
