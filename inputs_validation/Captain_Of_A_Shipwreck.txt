I was lost until you found me  
Youre the reason for my today  
Was tempest tossed now I sleep soundly  
Thanks to you I gladly say  
  
That if your goldmine comes up empty  
Ill be there to work the claim  
If youre a captain of a shipwreck  
Ill be first mate to your shame  
  
Trust in me to share your burden  
Stand by you where I belong  
When life brings the day uncertain  
I will soothe you with my song  
  
And if your goldmine comes up empty  
Ill be there to work the claim  
If youre a captain of a shipwreck  
Ill be first mate to your shame  
  
Fear no flood in stormy weather  
Fear no fire if winds arise  
Flesh and blood Im yours forever  
And forever it never dies  
  
And if your goldmine comes up empty  
Ill be there to work the claim  
If youre a captain of a shipwreck  
Ill be first mate to your shame  
  
If youre a captain of a shipwreck  
You can find me up on the top deck  
Youll be captain of a shipwreck  
Ill be first mate to your shame
