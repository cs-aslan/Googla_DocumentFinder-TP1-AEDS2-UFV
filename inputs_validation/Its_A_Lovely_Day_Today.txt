Its a lovely day today  
So whatever youve got to do  
Youve got a lovely day to do it in thats true  
  
And I hope whatever youve got to do  
Is something that can be done by two  
For Id really like to stay  
  
Its a lovely day today  
And whatever youve got to do  
Id be so happy to be doing it with you  
  
But if youve got something that must be done  
And it can only be done by one  
There is nothing more to say  
Except its a lovely day for saying  
Its a lovely day

Its a lovely day today  
And whatever Ive got to do  
Ive got a lovely day to do it in thats true  
  
But perhaps whatever Ive got to do  
Is something that can be done by two  
If it is then you could stay  
  
Its a lovely day today  
But youre probably busy too  
So I suppose theres nothing we can do  
  
For if youve got something that must be done  
And it can only be done by one  
There is nothing more to say  
Except its a lovely day for saying  
Its a lovely day
