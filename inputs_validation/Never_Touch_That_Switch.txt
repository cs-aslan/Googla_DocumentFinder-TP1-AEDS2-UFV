Size of which is paradoxic the only way youre gonna stop this  
In the vessel theres a switch in the middle  
You really shouldnt fiddle cause its toxic  
Listen up cause its a red light  
And the pressures blowing up tight  
Theres a schism in the time mechanism  
Theres a schism in the time mechanism  
Never touch that switch  
Even if you want to  
You dont know what it can do  
Never touch that switch even if you want to  
You dont know what it can do  
  
See the futures in the distance  
I know Im facing some resistance  
Getting back within the blink of a bubble  
Time machine never gives us any trouble  
Theres a riot down in Shelton  
Only minutes after Brixton but this city never made it on the telly  
Or the rumble of the nations underbelly  
  
Never touch that switch even if you want to  
You dont know what it can do  
Never touch that switch even if you want to  
You dont know what it can do  
  
You know youre heading for a meltdown and youre living in a tin town  
Thinking that youre gonna be somebody living in the land of milk and honey  
Listen up cause its a red light and the futures blowing up tight  
Theres a schism in the time mechanism theres a schism in the time mechanism  
  
Never touch that switch even if you want to  
You dont know what it can do  
Never touch that switch even if you want to  
You dont know what it can do  
Never touch that switch even if you want to  
You dont know what it can do  
Never touch that switch even if you want to  
You dont know what it can do
