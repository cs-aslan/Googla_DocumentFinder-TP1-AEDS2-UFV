When you hit the bottom  
When youre left with nothing  
When you cant tell the difference yeah  
You still wont know what its like  
  
When you think youre Damaged  
When its overwhelming  
When you cant get past it yeah  
You still wont know what its like  
What its like  
  
You havent seen the ghosts that Ive seen  
You havent lived enough to know what it means  
To feel the Pain In love turned cold  
To taste the end before its over  
  
When your heart is broken  
And you can trust no one  
When you think youre lonely yeah  
You still wont know what its like  
  
When you feel like nothing  
You just cant take it  
When your heart is breaking  
You still wont know what its like  
What its like  
  
You havent seen the ghosts that Ive seen  
You havent lived enough to know what it means  
To feel the Pain In love turned cold  
To taste the end before its over  
  
You dont know the person suffering  
So before you start Cant make any of this out Sympathies  
Take a look at whats left of me  
Take a look at whats left of me left of me  
  
Every day I fight a war with God  
 And every time I think youve figured it out  
 No its not  
  
You havent seen the ghosts that Ive seen  
You havent lived enough to know what it means  
To feel the Pain In love turned cold  
To taste the end before its over  
  
You dont know the person suffering  
So before you start Cant make any of this out Sympathy  
Take a look at whats left of me  
Take a look at whats left of me left of me  
  
You dont know the person suffering  
So before you start Cant make any of this out Sympathy  
Take a look at whats left of me  
Take a look at whats left of me left of me
