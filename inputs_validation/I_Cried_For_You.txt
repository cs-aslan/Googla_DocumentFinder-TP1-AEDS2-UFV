I cried for you  
Now its your turn to cry over me  
Every road has a turning  
Thats one thing youre learning  
I cried for you  
What a fool I used to be  
But Ill find two eyes just a little bit bluer  
Ill find a heart just a little bit truer  
I cried for you  
Now its your turn to cry over me  
  
I know Im no glamour girl like Baby  like her  
But maybe someday youll realize that glamour isnt the only thing in this
world  
If your shows a flop youll find you cant eat glamour for breakfast  
Anyway I might be pretty goodlooking myself when I grow out of this ugly
duckling stage  
And youre no Clark Gable yourself  
But thats all right  
Dont worry about me Ill recover  
Time is a great healer  
But in the future if we should meet again at the opera or at a ball and  
Im dazzling in my diamonds and pearls and ermine wraps  
And surrounded by lords and dukes and princes youll probably be sorry  
And youll probably realize that life is just an idiots delight  
And as I speed through the night into the abyss of oblivion  
I can only say thanks  thanks for the memory  
  
Ill find two eyes just a little bit bluer  
Ill find a heart just a little bit truer  
I cried for you  
Now its your turn to cry over me
