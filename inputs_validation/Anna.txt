Anna please turn around well work it out somehow  
Anna dont turn me down theres still a chance if we can hold out once more  
  
Cause we started out with love that was more than enough  
And thats a lot to give up  
  
Chorus  
Even if you turn and walk away love will bring you back somehow  
I will wait forever and a day cause I believe without a doubt  
The time will not run out on our love  
  
Anna you gotta stay its just a stage were going through  
And Anna this all can change if we turn the page then we can start all again  
  
Cause we almost touched the sky and it could never again be this right  
Anna please change your mind  
  
Chorus x3  
  
And I believe without a doubt the time will not run out  
And I believe without a doubt the time will not run out on our love
