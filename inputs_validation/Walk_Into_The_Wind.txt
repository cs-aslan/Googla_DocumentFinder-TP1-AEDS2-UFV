You have to learn to love my loving  
Turn around and say you care  
You have to learn to give by giving  
Give me a beatnik love affair  
Well watch the shooting stars go crazy  
So what dya say a definite maybe  
Should we walk into the wind  
Maybe fall when autumn falls  
Lets walk into the wind  
You have to learn to touch by touching  
  
Touch me touch me if you dare  
Weve reached the end of the beginning  
In this beatnik love affair  
Should we walk into the wind  
Maybe fall when autumn falls  
Lets walk into the wind  
Before you taste another tear my love  
I know a place where rainbows end  
The kingdom of the final kiss is but a breath away  
Here come those shooting stars again  
  
Should we walk into the wind  
Maybe fall when autumn falls  
Lets walk into the wind
