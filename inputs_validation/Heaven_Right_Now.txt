Shes everything  
A married man  
Should look for in a girl  
Shes married too  
But not to you  
And thats part of the thrill  
Shes the one who makes you feel alright  
Her alibis your alibi its watertight  
  
Shes old enough  
To know of love  
And know that this is not  
But young enough  
To not be willing  
To settle for what shes got  
Shes the one who makes you feel alright  
Her alibis your alibi its watertight  
  
And if you get caught  
Youre going to hell  
But its heaven right now  
  
Shes the one who makes you feel alright  
Her alibis your alibi its watertight  
  
Shes everything  
A married man  
Should look for in a girl  
Shes married too  
But not to you  
And thats part of the thrill  
Shes the one who makes you feel alright  
Her alibis your alibi its watertight  
  
Shes the one who makes you feel alright  
Her alibis your alibi its watertight  
  
Oh and youre going to hell  
But its heaven right now
