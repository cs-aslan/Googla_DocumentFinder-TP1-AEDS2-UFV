Dont say you love me  
Strange things that make me die  
Dont say you love me  
Strange things that make me die  
  
I dont belong Im still around wont steal you like a radio  
Im still around I wont be long gonna treat you like an angel  
  
But dont say you love me  
Strange things that make me die  
Dance till were high youre shy  
Dont say youll cry  
  
I told you lies Im still around wont steal your act my angel  
I wont be long its still your round or serialize the radio  
  
But dont say you love me  
Strange things that make me die  
Dance till were high youre shy  
Dont say dont say youll cry  
  
What do you say  
What do you say  
  
Dont go on I see your eyes I screw you around my angel  
Youre still my love its in your eyes our song is on the radio  
  
But dont say you love me what do you say  
Strange things that make me die  
Dance till were high youre shy  
Dont say youll cry  
  
Dont say you love me  
Dont say youll cry Im high  
Dont say youll cry
