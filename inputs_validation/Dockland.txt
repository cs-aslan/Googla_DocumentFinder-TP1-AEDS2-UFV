Late glow on an early winter evening in Dockland  
With my ship of dreams moving easily across the sound  
Reminiscence is weighing me down with a vengeance  
Tide water so deep I think Im going to drown  
  
But in the wink of an eye I am rising above the affliction  
In the wink of an eye I am come back in from the cold  
I dont even have to try and Im gone out of here without notice  
Gone out of Dockland without a care in the world  
  
It didnt hit me when I met you coming out of the shambles  
It didnt hit me when you took me to the summer field  
I didnt flinch when you told me that youd get what you wanted  
I never had what it takes to have a heart of steel  
  
But in the wink of an eye I am rising above the affliction  
In the wink of an eye I am come back in from the cold  
I didnt even have to try and Im gone out of here without notice  
Im gone out Dockland without a care in the world  
Gone out of Dockland  
  
Yes I loved you the time that is was  
And yes you may rip me whenever you want  
  
So it goes on a crystalclear morning in Dockland  
And heaven knows if Ill ever live to love again  
Struck down by the kiss of an angel in limbo  
Laid low by the act of the going  
  
But in the wink of an eye I am rising above the affliction  
In the wink of an eye I am come back in from the cold  
I dont even have to try and Im gone out of here without notice  
Gone out of Dockland without a care in the world  
  
Im gone out of Dockland without a care in world
