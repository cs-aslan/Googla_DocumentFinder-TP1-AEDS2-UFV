Nights gonna fall  
Letting the stars shine through and through  
Time on the wall  
Bringing me closer to the  
One i want  
I cant wait no more no no  
  
Lost like a child  
Even my knees are shaking  
Caught for a while  
Under a wave thats breaking  
Over me  
In his arms i float  
  
When he looks at me this way  
I know what hell say  
  
Chorus  
Get ready get set  
You aint seen nothing yet  
All day all night  
Heres something you cant forget  
Get ready get set  
You aint seen nothing yet  
All day all night  
Heres something you cant forget  
  
I could try  
Imagining something better than  
You and i  
Making sweet love together  
Taking me much farther than before  
When he looks at me this way  
I know just what hell say  
  
Ooh ooh  
When he looks at me this way  
I know just what hell say  
  
Na na na na  
Na na na na
