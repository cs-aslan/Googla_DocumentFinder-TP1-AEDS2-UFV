Oh Now when you think the times flying  
Take a look around  
Cause babies are dying from disease  
Sleeping out on the ground  
  
People never seen the tortured eyes  
From a foreign land No  
When you see somebody whos down and out  
Lend a helpin hand  
  
You better lend a helpin hand If you can  
Lend a helpin hand  
Do it if you can  
  
Oh Every time you feed your face  
Do you bow your head  
Hunger kills each and every day  
Wont you share your bread  
  
If youve ever felt the pain inside  
I know youd understand  
When you see somebody whos down and out  
Lend a helpin hand  
  
You better lend a helpin hand If you can  
Lend a helpin hand  
Do it if you can  
  
Oh Every time you feed that face  
Do you look around  
For somebody right in your own neighborhood  
Sleepin out on the ground  
  
And do some down south jukin  
If youve ever felt the pain inside  
I know youd understand  
When you see somebody whos down and out  
  
Lend a helpin hand  
Why dont you lend a helpin hand If you can  
Lend a helpin hand  
Wont you please lend a helpin hand
