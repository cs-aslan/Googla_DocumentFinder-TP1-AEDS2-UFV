I know just how you want it  
Here goes just how you need it  
I know just how to give it  
You say you love me yes you do  
I believe it cause I can see it  
When you hold me a feelin inside  
Youre givin and Im takin  
Im there just when you want me  
You know Ill never leave you  
Happens every time I see you  
You got my lovin in your hands  
Dont shake it dont break it  
I love you so much dont you know  
Love thinkin start dreamin

Here I stand on the ground  
Your love baby is what Ive found  
You say you love me yes you do  
I believe it cause I can see it  
When you hold me a feelin inside  
Youre givin and Im takin  
I know just how you want it  
Here goes just how you need it  
I know just how you want it  
I know I know I know I know
