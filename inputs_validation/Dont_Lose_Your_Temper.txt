Dont lose your temper  
Dont lose your temper  
Dont lose your temper  
Cause I love you when youre wild  
Dont lose your temper  
Dont lose your temper  
Dont lose your temper  
Cause Id hate you to grow mild  
Since you took that job with a company  
Youve changed so much you just wont recognise me  
They have you dressed up like a secretary  
You mustnt change the things that make you what you are  
Since youve been listening to that linguaphone  
Youre speaking in a voice that is not your own  
Im not sure if its you when I call home  
You mustnt change the things that make you what you are  
Whatever happened to my fighting biting lightning lioness  
Little girl little girl little girl little girl  
I think I preferred it when your hair was in a mess  
Brittle girl brittle girl  
Theyre not your real curls  
Dont lose it  
Dont lose it  
Dont lose it  
Dont lose it
