She sits quiet  
In the shadow of the sun  
She looks tired  
Her life thats come undone  
She turns turns turns turns  
  
She likes hockey  
And summers by the lake  
Were not talking  
Because of my mistakes  
I burn burn burn burn  
  
Chorus  
If you walk out that door  
I just dont know what Id do  
Ill never get over you  
In my heart  
I just dont know what Id do  
Ill never get over you  
  
End the silence  
But its never been so loud  
I try to fight it  
But the words just dont come out  
I burn burn burn burn  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres no hiding  
From your silence  
Theres no hiding  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont you go  
Dont you go  
Dont you go  
Dont you go
