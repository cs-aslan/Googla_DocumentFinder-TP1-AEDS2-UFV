Venetian blinds are crackling  
I like the noise  
Its got texture  
Hit it again when Im mad  
Close it again when Im sad  
With the door closed Im a king  
No questions  
No answers  
Dont like talking without reason  
Whats the use if you stop feeling  
  
All alone Im cynical to the TV  
Newsmans making passes to newslady  
Camera stops  
Newsreel babies  
  
I like to close all the doors  
Make it dark  
Make it cool  
Come in and talk  
Whatever you like  
I dont mind if its something new
