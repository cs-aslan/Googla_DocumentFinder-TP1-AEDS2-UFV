I see the way the salesmen stare into the sun  
I stood and watched them as they fell off one by one  
And everyones so blind  
Theyre not to help mankind  
  
Reach into your bag of tricks and pull another one  
You dont want to change the world  
Like you say  
Youre in it for yourself  
  
No one else  
Youre ready  
Saving yourself  
Youre gonna change the world  
  
Youre ready  
Saving yourself  
Youre gonna change the world  
Now when the day is set theyll line up all the same
