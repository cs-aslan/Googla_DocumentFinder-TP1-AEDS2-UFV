When Im dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
I may be dead but I am not deceased dear  
One day science will reanimate me  
Oh I heard about the rich who when they die  
Get themselves frozen cryogenicwise  
I know we cant afford to hire no company  
When my heart dont beat no more and I lay rigourmortisously  
But we got that freezer up on top our fridge  
Cant squeeze in my whole body baby Im just way too big  
How I wish we had afforded that fancy Frigidaire  
So youd just have to chop off my legs and my derriere  
When Im dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
I may be dead but I am not deceased dear  
One day science will reanimate me  
Oh I know baby youre up for the task  
Youll wrap me up with more than just string and plastic wrap  
Using Tupperware cause you care and out of concern  
That Id come back to life with a case of freezer burn  
When Im dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
I may be dead but I am not deceased dear  
One day science will reanimate me  
Oh when I thaw when I thaw  
Hope my new bodys six feet tall or more  
And if you cant find a man in time  
Get a horse I might make a nice centaur  
Oh youll see my face each night in your dreams  
And when you go to the kitchen to fetch some ice cream  
But dont worry honey soon Ill be back on earth  
When they cure death and get bodies for the rich guys first  
When Im dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
You can dispose of my body at your leisure  
You know I dont think that it ever suited me  
When Im dead put my head in the freezer  
Right beside the corn and the peas  
I may be dead but I am not deceased dear  
One day science will reanimate me
