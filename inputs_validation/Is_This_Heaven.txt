Walking home with you last night  
You said the world is beautiful  
And how things look that way when youre  
Love  
I love this world  
When Im in your arms  
Is this heaven  
  
I opened up the letter that the  
Postman gave to me this morning  
Had to stop myself from shouting out  
I love this world  
When Im in your arms  
Is this heaven  
When Im in your arms  
Is this heaven  
  
I know that heaven waits  
For those whose love is true  
I want to be there when  
The age love is come again  
  
Tell me all about yourself  
And how you came to me like in a dream  
And every night I dream of you  
I dream of you  
When Im in your arms  
Is this heaven  
When Im in your arms  
Is this heaven  
  
I know that heaven waits  
For those whose love is true  
Dont ask me where or when  
The time for us will come again  
  
I sit and watch the sun go down  
And in the darkness theres no sound  
While in the sky tonight the stars all cry I love  
You  
Are they crying out over you  
cause youre in my heart  
Is this heaven  
cause the story starts and ends with you
