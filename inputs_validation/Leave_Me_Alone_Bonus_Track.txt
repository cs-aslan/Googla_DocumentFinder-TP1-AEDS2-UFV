Hmm  
Oh oh  
They all say  
Im ridiculous  
But Ive got news for them  
Ive got news for us  
  
Im freaking pissed off  
Whats up wit them  
Im freaking pissed off  
Leave  
Leave  
  
Chorus  
Leave me alone  
Let me live my life in peace  
Leave me alone  
What cant you just be  
Normal  
Not those freaking paparazzi people  
Leave me alone  
Im private  
Ive learned my lesson  
So theres no stripping to see  
Yeah  
Leave me alone  
  
Myself  
I am personal  
You dont need to bring me  
To see  
What i have done  
Its not my fault  
You just give me space  
Leave me  
Leave me  
  
Chorus  
  
Yes  
Leave me  
Leave me  
Leave me  
  
Chorus 2x
