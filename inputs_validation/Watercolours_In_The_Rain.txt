Going through the motions  
Ending up nowhere at all  
Cant see the sun on my wall  
Going through emotions  
Ending up on a frozen morning  
With a heart not even broken  
  
Seems Ive been running all my life all my life  
Seems Ive been running all my life all my life all my life  
  
Like watercolors in the rain  
  
Find a place to settle down  
Get a job in a city nearby  
And watch the trains roll on by  
Ill find the falling star  
Ill fall in love with the eyes of a dreamer  
And a dream worth believing  
  
Seems Ive been running all my life all my life  
Seems Ive been running all my life all my life all my life  
Like watercolors in the rain
