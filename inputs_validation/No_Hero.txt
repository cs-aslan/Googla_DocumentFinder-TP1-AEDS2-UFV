Once you said youd stick to it until the end  
I guess you lied they call it suicide  
Now youre gone  
What was so wrong that you couldnt find a way to carry on  
Second guess  
Did I do my best  
There was a friend I had  
  
Chorus  
Johnny was a weirdo  
So what did you expect  
I aint no fucking hero  
Im just trying to survive myself  
  
I should have known you went through it alone  
I wonder why did you even try  
You could have come to me  
I would have helped you see  
You could have found a way to carry on  
Second guess  
Did I do my best  
There was a friend I had  
  
Chorus  
  
Johnnys strange behavior was a tipoff they say  
But I aint no fucking savior  
Im just living day by day  
  
Little things little lives hanging til the end  
I say it doesnt really mean nothing  
Telling truth telling lies  
I used to have a friend  
I say it dont really mean nothing  
And I cant let this feeling go  
Let this feeling go  
Let this feeling go
