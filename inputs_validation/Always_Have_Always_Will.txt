Always have always will  
I was mesmerized when I first met you  
Wouldnt let myself believe  
That you could step right out of my wildest dreams  
But you didnt know  
That secret part of me  
Until we kissed an made it open up so easily  
  
I always have  
Even when it didnt show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever youre close to me  
I always have  
Doesnt matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have always will  
  
Everything that you give in to  
Everything youll ever need  
Is locked up somewhere deep inside of me  
You gotta know  
But more importantly  
Youve got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy  
  
I always have  
Even when it didnt show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever youre close to me  
I always have  
Doesnt matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
  
Sometimes we try too hard to please  
We should let love come naturally  
And sometimes I dont know  
Just what you really do to me  
That is OK  
cause its all part of the mystery  
  
I always have  
Even when it didnt show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever youre close to me  
I always have  
Doesnt matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have always will  
  
I always have  
Even when it didnt show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever youre close to me  
I always have  
Doesnt matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have always will
