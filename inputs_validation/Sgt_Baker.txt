Sgt Baker is my name  
Im gonna teach you how to play the game  
Of warfare  
Suddenly it appears to me  
You got a bit much dignity  
For your own good boy  
Yes sir yes sir  
  
I will rape your personality  
Pummel you with my own philosophy  
Strip you of your selfintegrity  
To make you all a bit like me  
I said right left right left  
  
Sgt Baker here again  
And if you calls me Puddin Tame  
Ill stomp you down boy  
Steers and Queers  
Steers and Queers where you come  
From theres just steers and queers  
And you aint got no horns boy  
Yes sir yes sir  
  
I will rape your personality  
Pummel you with my own philosophy  
Strip you of your selfintegrity  
To make you all a bit like me  
I said right left right left right left
