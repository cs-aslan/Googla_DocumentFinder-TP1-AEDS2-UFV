As you sit there in your loneliness  
Confused as you must be  
Im sure a dozen questions come to mind  
And if youre wondering why I left you  
After all youve done for me  
I guess youll have to blame it on the times  
  
The many times you had your way  
No matter what the cost  
And the many times you took for granted  
Love you now have lost  
And if Ive hurt you darling  
I dont mean to be unkind  
I guess youll have to blame it on the times  
  
That small conceited world of yours  
Could never understand  
That to want to stand alone is not a crime  
And if for one time in my life  
Im acting like a man  
I guess youll have to blame it on the times  
  
Blame it on the many times  
A hiding place Id seek  
Afraid to say whats on my mind  
An ashamed for being weak  
So if at last Im seeing  
After so long being blind  
I suppose youll have to blame it on the times
