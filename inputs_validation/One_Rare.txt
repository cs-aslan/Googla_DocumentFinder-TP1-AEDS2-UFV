The cerebrum has suffered massive and reparable damage  
You never know what has happened to him  
If I have not been sure of this I would not have permitted him to live  
Where am I Father what happened I need help  
  
What is democracy What is democracy  
It got something to do with young men killing each other Arthur  
What if its my turn will you want me to go  
For democracy any man would give his only begotten son  
  
It is impossible for any severed individual to experience pain  
Pleasure memory dream or thought of any kind  
This young man will be as unfeeling as unthinking as the dead  
Until the day joins them  
  
I dont know weather Im alive or dreaming or dead or remembering  
How can you tell whats a dream and whats real  
When you cant even tell when your awake and when your asleep  
Where am I  
  
I cant remember anything  
Cant tell if this is true or dream  
Deep down inside I feel to scream  
This terrible silence stops with me  
  
Now that the war is through with me  
Im waking up I cannot see  
That theres not much left of me  
Nothing is real but pain now  
  
Hold my breath as I wish for death  
Oh please God wake me  
  
They kept my head and chopped off everything  
Oh God please make them hear me  
They wont listen they wont hear me  
They got to wake me up Ill be like this for years hear me  
  
Back in the womb its much too real  
In pumps life that I must feel  
But cant look forward to reveal  
Look to the time when Ill live  
  
Fed through the tube that sticks in me  
Just like a wartime novelty  
Tied to machines that make me be  
Cut this life off from me  
  
Hold my breath as I wish for death  
Oh please God wake me  
Its like a piece of me
