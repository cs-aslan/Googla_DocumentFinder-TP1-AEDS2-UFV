And if you really love me wont you tell me  
And if you really love me wont you tell me  
And if you really love me wont you tell me  
Then I wont have to be  
Playing around  
You call my name  
Oooh so sweet  
To make your kiss incomplete  
When your mood is clear  
You quickly change your ways  
Then you say Im untrue  
What am I supposed to do  
Be a fool who sits alone waiting for you  
But if you really love me wont you tell me  
But if you really love me wont you tell me  
And if you really love me wont you tell me  
Then I wont have to be  
Playing around  
I see the light of your smile  
Calling me all the while  
You are saying baby  
Its time to go  
First the feelings alright  
Then its gone from sight  
So Im taking out this time to say  
Oh if you really love me wont you tell me  
Oh if you really love me wont you tell me  
And if you really love me wont you tell me  
Then I wont have to be  
Playing around no  
Playing around no  
Hey yeah  
Goofin around no  
Oh baby  
Playing around no  
Let me know how you feel baby  
Hey oh baby  
Playing around no
