What you gonna do when you get out of jail  
Im gonna have some fun  
What do you consider fun  
Fun natural fun  
  
Im in heaven  
With my boyfriend my laughing boyfriend  
theres no beginning and there is no end  
Time isnt present in that dimension  
Hell take my arm  
When were walkin rolling and rocking  
Its one time Im glad Im not a man  
Feels like Im dreaming but Im not sleeping  
  
Im in heaven  
With the maven of funk mutation  
Clintons musicians such as Bootsy Collins  
Raise expectations to a new intention  
No one can sing  
Quite like Smokey Smokey Robinson  
Wailin and shakin to Bob Marley  
Reggaes expanding with Sly and Robbie  
  
All the weekend  
Boyfriend was missing  
I surely miss him  
The way hed hold me in his warm arms  
We went insane when we took cocaine  
  
Stepping in a rhythm to a Kurtis Blow  
Who needs to think when your feet just go  
With a hiditihi and a hipitiho  
Who needs to think when your feet just go  
Who needs to think when your feet just go  
James Brown James Brown  
James Brown James Brown  
  
If you see him  
Please remind him unhappy boyfriend  
Well hes the genius of love  
hes got a greater depth of feeling  
Well hes the genius of love  
hes so deep
