They come from the cities  
And they come from the smaller towns  
Beat up cars with guitars and drummers  
Goin crack boom bam  
  
Chorus  
ROCK in the USA  
ROCK in the USA  
ROCK in the USA Yeah Yeah  
Rockin in the USA  
  
Said goodbye to their families  
Said goodbye to their friends  
With pipe dreams in their heads  
And very little money in their hands  
Some are black and some are white  
Aint to proud to sleep on the floor tonight  
With the blind faith of Jesus you know that they just might be  
Rockin in the USA  
Hey  
  
Voices from nowhere  
And voices from the larger towns  
Filled our head full of dreams  
Turned the world upside down  
  
There was Frankie LymanBobby FullerMitch Ryder  
They were Rockin  
Jackie WilsonShangralasYoung Rascals  
They were Rockin  
Spotlight on Martha Reeves  
Lets dont forget James Brown  
Rockin in the USA  
Rockin in the USA  
Hey  
  
Chorus
