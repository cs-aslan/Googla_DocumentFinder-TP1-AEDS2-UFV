When I was young I spoke like a child And I saw with a childs eyes  
And an open door was to a girl Like the stars are to the skies  
Its funny how the world lives up to all your expectations  
With adventures for the stout of heart And the lure of the open spaces  
  
Theres two lanes running down this road And whichever side you are on  
Accounts for where you want to go And what you are running from  
Back when darkness overtook me On a blindmans curve  
  
Chorus  
  
I relied upon the moon I relied upon the moon  
I relied upon the moon and St Christopher  
  
Now Ive paid my dues cause I have owed them But Ive paid a price sometimes  
For being such a stubborn woman In such stubborn times  
I have run from the arms of lovers I have run from the eyes of friends  
I have run from the hands of kindness I have run just because I can  
  
Now Ive grown and I speak like a woman And I see with a womans eyes  
And an open door is to me now Like the saddest of goodbyes  
Well its too late for turning back And I pray for the heart and nerve  
  
Chorus repeat chorus  
  
I relied upon the moon I relied upon the moon  
I relied upon the moon and St Christopher to be my guide
