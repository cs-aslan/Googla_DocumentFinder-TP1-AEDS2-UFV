Play us a song we can slow dance on  
We want to hold each other  
Play us a groove so we hardly move  
Just let our hearts beat together  
Oh baby cause it feel so good  
When were close like this  
Whisper is my ear and let me steal a kiss  
  
Come on and touch me  
When were dancing  
You know youve got that loving touch  
Loving touch  
Touch me when were dancing  
I want to feel you when Im falling in love  
  
Tonights the night and it feels so right  
My heart is saying it to me  
Youre the one Ive waited for so long  
So let your love flow through me  
Oh baby cause it feels so good  
Just to be this close  
Youve got me up so high  
I could fly coast to coast
