Yeah  
  
Queen Bitch eat the rich  
Im on the second course today  
Im not the first  
And I wont be the worst  
You done most of LA  
Cant find a virgin  
I can get you a surgeon  
24 hours a day  
Wasnt Jean Genie a Rolling Stones hit  
Im about to be blown away  
  
Come on sing it  
  
Take me to the place where the sunshine flows  
Oh my sunset rodeo  
  
Hot fudge  
Here comes the judge  
Theres a green card and a way  
The holy ghost  
And the whole east coast  
Are moving to LA  
And weve been  
Dreaming of this feeling  
Since 1988  
Mother things have got to change  
Im moving to LA  
  
Take the piss  
I was English  
God bless you Uncle Sam  
You got a cool gene pool  
And I went to school  
And God knows I love to tan  
Making cents and dead presidents  
Before I could count to ten  
With the nation behind me  
Cant stop the limey  
Shes on her back again  
  
Come on sing it  
  
Take me to the place where the sunshine flows  
Oh my sunset rodeo  
  
Hot fudge  
Here comes the judge  
Theres a green card and a way  
The holy ghost  
And the whole east coast  
Are moving to LA  
Cause weve been  
Dreaming of this feeling  
Since 1988  
Mother things have got to change  
Im moving to LA LA LA  
  
Take me to the place where the sunshine flows  
Oh my sunset rodeo  
  
Hot fudge  
Here comes the judge  
Theres a green card and a way  
The holy ghost  
And the whole east coast  
Are moving to LA  
Cause weve been  
Dreaming of this feeling  
Since 1988  
Mother things have got to change  
Im moving to  
  
Keep amoving keep amoving keep amoving to LA  
Mo mo mo mo
