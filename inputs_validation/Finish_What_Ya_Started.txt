Come on baby finish what ya started  
That aint no way to treat the broken hearted  
If you want to see other guys  
Baby I could let it slide  
You want to lover you want a friend  
Mama I can be both of them  
I got the tools to satisfy  
Just walk away if I fall shy at all  
Come on baby finish what you started  
Im incomplete  
That aint no way to treat the broken hearted  
I need some sympathy  
I like to take each step one by one  
Right on time you will arrive  
By keepin the dream alive  
Its alive and its kicking  
Inside of me  
So come on baby please  
Come on baby finish what you started  
Im incomplete  
That aint no way to treat the broken hearted  
Come on and finish me  
Come on baby finish what you started  
That aint no way to treat the broken hearted  
Come on baby finish what you started  
That aint no way to treat the broken hearted  
Baby come on  
Baby come on
