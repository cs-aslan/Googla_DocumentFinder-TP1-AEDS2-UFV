See these eyes so green  
I can stare for a thousand years  
Colder than the moon  
Well its been so long  
And Ive been running on fire  
With gasoline  
See these eyes so red  
Red like jungle burning bright  
Those who feel me near  
Pull the blinds and change their minds  
Its been so long  
Still this pulsing night  
A plague I call a heartbeat  
Just be still with me  
But you wouldnt believe what Ive been through  
Youve been so long well its been so long  
And Ive been putting out the fire with gasoline  
Putting out the fire with gasoline  
See these tears so blue  
An ageless heart that can never mend  
Tears can never dry  
A judgement made can never bend  
See these eyes so green  
I can stare for a thousand years  
Just be still with me  
You wouldnt believe what Ive been through  
Well youve been so long its been so long  
And Ive been putting out fire with gasoline  
Putting out fire with gasoline  
Putting out fire  
Ive been putting out fire  
Well its been so long so long so long  
Yes its been so long so long so long  
Ive been putting out fire  
Been so long so long so long  
Been so long so long so long  
Been so long so long so long
