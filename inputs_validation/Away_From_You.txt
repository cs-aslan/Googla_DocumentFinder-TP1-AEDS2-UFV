It made me cry  
To say goodbye  
Im sad and blue  
Now that youve gone  
I cant go on  
Away from you  
  
I smile to hide  
The tears inside  
Its hard to do  
My happiness  
My lifes success  
Depends on you  
  
The hours seem long  
The world goes wrong  
When were apart  
My skies are gray  
What can I say  
To soothe my heart  
  
It is the end  
I cant pretend  
That Im not blue  
Oh cant you see  
Lifes misery  
Away from you  
  
The hours are long  
The world goes wrong  
When were apart  
My skies are gray  
What can I say  
To soothe my heart  
  
It is the end  
I cant pretend  
That Im not blue  
Oh cant you see  
Lifes misery  
Away from you  
Away from you
