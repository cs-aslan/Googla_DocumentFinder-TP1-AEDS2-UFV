Does she love me

How can I tell if she loves me so  
Is it in her eyes No no youll be deceived  
Is it in her sighs No no shell make believe  
If you want to know  
If she loves you so

Is it in her face No no thats just her charms  
In her warm embrace No no thats just her arms  
If you want to know if she loves you so
