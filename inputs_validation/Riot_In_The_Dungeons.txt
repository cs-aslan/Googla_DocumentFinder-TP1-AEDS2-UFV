Locked up in chains backs to the wall  
Tick like a time bomb till we hear the call  
Pushed from outside thrown underground  
Frozen in time we wait for the sound  
  
Chorus  
Oh I feel something coming  
Looks like a riot in the dungeon  
  
Trapped behind bars prisoners of death  
All hope is ours we cant give up yet  
Ready to fight to get what we need  
Die on your feet or live on your knees  
  
Chorus  
Oh I feel something coming  
Looks like a riot in the dungeon  
You stand and die or start your running  
Cause theres a riot in the dungeon  
  
Its got to give its gonna break  
Dying to live our freedoms at stake  
Beating the odds with our hearts and blood  
We wont give in till theyve had enough
