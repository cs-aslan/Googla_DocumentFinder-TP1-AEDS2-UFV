Hmm Young Mullah baby

To listen to me whine

Shit Im above the stars  
And now I done got so high

I tell her Im in love with you  
But I cant be with you  
Tomorrow Ill be back  
Up on the first flight  
Right up out of town  
  
Hop back in my spaceship  
Girl I gotta drop your ass off  
Cause I just come to take it  
Then you know I gotta take off  
But Imma be here next week  
So call your company and take off  
  
And she say Wayne you aint shit  
You got me all impatient  
Cry me a river  
I can hear my conscience while I sail off  
  
Boy you got a problem  
And you aint foolin no one but yourself  
Youre like a hot revolver  
But you aint killin no one but yourself  
And Tunechis gon find someone to love  
And you go by yourself so all alone  
  
One minute she love me  
The next minute she hate me  
Thats two minutes of my time she done wasted  
She say she pray she have Weezy Fs baby  
And I be having seizures  
But she say she cant shake me  
And my homies say shes cuter than my other bitches  
And every time Im in that pussy it feel customfitted  
I swear I like her more than she think I do  
Girl when I think of you  
My dick just start to jumpin like a fucking kangaroo  
I suck and fuck and finger you  
But you want me to cling to you  
And I aint asking you to change  
Cause I know I cant jingle you  
I got my ways  
And you have your days  
And we gave it our best shot  
But I just got grazed  
Im sorry  
  
Boy you got a problem  
And you aint foolin no one but yourself  
Youre like a hot revolver  
But you aint killin no one but yourself  
And Tunechis gon find someone to love  
And you go by yourself so all alone
