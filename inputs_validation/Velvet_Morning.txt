Yes  
Its been long  
And yes  
I still feel strong  
Into the half light  
Another velvet morning for me yeah  
  
Time  
Stands still  
As you take  
Your last pill  
Into the half light  
Another velvet morning for me  
  
And now Im trying to tell you  
About my life  
And my tongue is twisted  
And more dead than alive  
And my feelings  
Theyve always been betrayed  
And I was born a little damaged man  
And look what they made  
  
I said dont you find  
That its lonely  
The corridor  
You walk there alone  
And life is a game  
Youve tried  
And life is a game  
Youre tired  
  
Yes  
Im coming down  
Your beauty is  
A color surround  
Into the half light  
Another velvet morning for me  
  
And now Im trying to tell you  
About my life  
And my tongue is twisted  
And more dead than alive  
And my feelings  
My feelings theyve been betrayed  
And I was born a little damaged man  
And look what they made  
  
He said dont you find  
That its lonely  
The corridor  
You walk there alone  
And life is a game  
Youve tried  
And life is a game  
Youre tired  
And life is a game  
Youve tried
