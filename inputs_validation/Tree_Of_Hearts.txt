On a tree inside a heart  
A dull boyscout knife  
Took half a day to carve  
Michael loves Caroline  
He just turned ten and she was nine  
  
The summer she turned sweet sixteen  
He finally found his nerve  
And took her out to see  
And what she saw through her tears  
Were seven hearts for seven years  
  
CHORUS  
And they stood beneath the tree of hearts  
And they watch their feelings grow  
And they swore theyd never be apart  
True love left its mark  
On the tree of hearts  
  
The tenth time he carved their names  
Carolines dad was giving her away  
There beneath the shelter of  
The tree of hearts they pledged their love  
  
And then four hearts down the road  
They brought the first of two born home  
  
CHORUS  
And they played beneath the tree of hearts  
And they watched their children grow  
And they swore theyd never be apart  
True love left its mark  
On the tree of hearts  
  
BRIDGE  
In the blinking of an eye  
Somehow fiftyseven hears flew by  
  
Fiftyeight fiftynine  
Sixty he missed Caroline  
At sixtyone Michael knew  
There wouldnt be a sixtytwo  
  
CHORUS  
Now they lay beneath the tree of hearts  
An you can watch their love still grow  
Where they swore theyd never be apart  
True love left its mark  
On the tree of hearts
