I know youre a gangster but Im the queen of space  
A ruler of hearts I shoot the moon  
I take my tricks right from the start  
  
Im a sucker for love the jokers running wild  
My heart it can break oh it can break  
Frail as a child  
  
Whatever it is it is Whatever will be its gonna be  
Whoever you are you are  
Those games that you play dont you play em with me  
  
Youre a visionary dreamer  
A fool leaving things to chance risk is a hazard  
Oh such a hazard if you flirt with romance  
  
Its like a shooting the dice  
Flipping coins in the air  
Youre running on luck the odds are against you  
If youre not playing fair  
  
Whatever it is it is Whatever will be its gonna be  
Whoever you are you are  
Those games that play dont you play em with me  
  
Stacking the deck dealing those cards  
Watch what you take and stand it on guard  
  
Whatever it is it is Whatever will be its gonna be  
Whoever you are you are
