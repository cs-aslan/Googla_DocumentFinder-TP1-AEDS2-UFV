Hey you guys I just wanted to thank you for listening to the record and I
hope you had as much fun as I did and heres one last little diddy just for
you  
I used to ride my big wheel and sell lemonade  
Eat popcorn with grandpa while we watched the parade  
But now Im only happy when Im drinking JD  
What the hell happened to me  
  
I used to have fun throwing snowballs with my best friend Billy  
And Mom would make us cocoa if we got too chilly  
But now I only get excited when I see a girl pee  
What the hell happened to me  
  
I used to be the nicest kid in the neighborhood  
I only did the things that Momma said I should  
But now I just do whatever I want  
I even whipped it out in a restaurant  
  
I used to help clean the park in the middle of town  
And then played kickball til the sun went down  
But now all I do is get VD  
What the hell happened to me  
  
It makes no sense  
I cant believe I ended on me  
Im out of my gourd  
Wont somebody please help me  
  
A dodododo doo a dodo waa dodoweoh  
  
Im kind of a wierdo
