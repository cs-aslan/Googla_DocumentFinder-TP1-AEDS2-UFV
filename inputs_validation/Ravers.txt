Well were the ravers we just want to come out and play  
If you try to keep us down you better get out of our way  
If you dont know by now Im tellin you were here to stay  
Were a supercharged machine like a rockmobile  
Our pistons are poppin right under your wheels  
Were the ravers oh yeah  
The ravers ahh yeah yeah yeah  
The ravers look out  
They say were brats with no manners or pride  
Our reputations spreadin far and wide  
A bottle of gin is all we need tonight  
A hellraisin night  
Start to shake oh yeah  
Were a supercharged machine like a rockmobile  
Our pistons are poppin right under your wheels  
Were the ravers oh yeah  
The ravers yeah yeah yeah yeah  
The ravers watch out

Look out baby or well get you too  
We go anyway way we choose  
Anyway anyhow anywhere we wanted too  
Here we go  
Were the ravers

Well were a supercharged machine like a rockmobile  
Our pistons are poppin right under your wheels  
Were the ravers oh yeah  
The ravers yeah yeah yeah yeaheyeah

Were here to stay
