Well the red light shines  
On the streets of hate  
Where the devil dines  
Who knows what he ate  
  
Its a simple thing  
Trying to stay afloat  
The captain said  
Without his boat  
  
Some things are getting better  
Other things a little worse  
Its a situation  
Much like a curse  
  
Its the devils sidewalk  
Its the devils door  
Ive tried to avoid it  
Said the captain of the shore  
  
Theres a garden growing  
And a million weeds  
With no way of knowing  
Whos done which deed  
  
Thats an honest tale  
Said the helmsman to the mate  
About a woman delicious  
And a matter of fate  
  
Big wheel keep rollin  
Down on me  
One thing I can tell you  
Is you got to be free  
  
John Lennon said that  
And I believe in love  
But I believe in action  
When push comes to shove  
  
Who cares what you believe  
Said the captain amazed  
If you stood in my shoes  
Your eyes would be glazed  
  
So my fair damsel  
Wont you take your leave  
Are you headed for the country  
Where you wear the greensleeves  
  
And the children laugh  
And the old folks sing  
And the church bell tolls  
For a miraculous thing  
  
Where the big red furnace  
Just blooms and glows  
Where the big heart beats  
Where the big wheel rolls
