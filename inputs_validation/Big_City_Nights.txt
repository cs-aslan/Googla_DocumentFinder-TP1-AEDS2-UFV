When the daylight is falling down into the night  
And the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life  
It feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrill  
But its more like spinning wheels of fortune  
Which never stand still  
  
Big city big city nights  
You keep me burning  
Big city big city nights  
  
When the sunlight is rising up in my eyes  
And the long night has left me back at somebodys side  
It feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours before  
But its more like looking out for something  
I cant find anymore  
  
Big city big city nights  
You keep me burning  
Big city big city nights  
Always yearning  
  
There is no dream  
That you cant make true if youre looking for love  
But theres no girl  
Whos burning the ice away from my heart  
Maybe tonight  
  
Big city big city nights  
You keep me burning  
Big city big city nights  
Always yearning  
  
Big city big city nights  
You keep me burning  
Big city big city nights  
Always yearning
