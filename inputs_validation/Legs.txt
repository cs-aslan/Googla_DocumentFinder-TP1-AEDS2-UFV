Shes got legs  
She knows how to use them  
She never begs  
She knows how to choose them  
Shes holdin legs  
Wonderin how to feel them  
Would you get behind them  
If you could only find them  
Shes my baby

Alright  
Shes got hair  
Down to her fanny  
Shes kinda jet set  
Try undo her panties  
Every time shes dancin  
She knows what to do  
Everybody wants to see  
To see if she can use it
