All you need is time  
All you need is time time  
Time to make me bend  
Give it a try dont be rude  
Put it to the test and  
Ill give it right back to you  
  
Its cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
  
Kick it around take it to town  
Try to defy what you feel inside  
You better be strong  
Your love belongs to us  
  
Its cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
  
All I need is trust  
All I need is trust trust  
Trust to make it show  
I dont want to know everything you done  
If you get a tip then tell it to the eskimos  
  
Its cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
Its cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
  
All we need is faith  
All we need is faith faith  
Faith to make it nice  
Kick it around dont be rude  
If youre gonna make a mistake  
Dont you make it twice  
  
Its cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
Its cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
Its cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
Its cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day
