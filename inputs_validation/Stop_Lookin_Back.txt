Stuck in the county jail  
Nobody here gonna pay my bail  
Thirty days with a smelly drunk  
A turnkey callin me a dirty punk  
I got to pick myself up and stop lookin back  
And Ive got to move straight ahead stop lookin back  
  
Chorus  
Shoot for the stars when my eyes cant see the starlight  
Reach for the sun in the night  
Stop lookin back at the times I was defeated  
I pick myself up I move straight ahead I stop lookin back  
  
Stranded nothing worse  
Im livin on coffee I got an empty purse  
Im dreamin bout blue eyes lookin my way  
Hopin my dreams dont blow away  
I got to pick myself up and stop lookin back  
And Ive got to move straight ahead stop lookin back  
  
Chorus
