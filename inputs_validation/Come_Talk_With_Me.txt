Come talk with me  
Take off your coat  
Sit down for awhile  
Stick around for awhile  
  
Its been a long year  
My luck is down think  
Ill skip town for awhile  
To search for my smile  
  
You look so nice  
You shine just like an angel  
But Im sure that you must get that all the time  
  
Have you heard that new song on the radio  
It reminds me of us  
But I forget how it goes  
  
Its been a long week  
And my mind is tired  
I think Ill sit down for a while  
Settle down for a while  
You look so nice  
You shine just like the morning  
And at 9PM you glow just like the night  
  
As all these weeks roll by I wonder why  
You wont talk with me why  
Why does it make me crazy when I know  
Youre coming down down down  
Youre coming down down down down down  
  
You wont see me  
You wont leave me  
Leave me where I am I am  
  
You wont see me  
You wont leave me  
Leave me where I am  
  
As all these weeks roll by I wonder why  
You wont talk with me why  
Why does it make me crazy when I know  
Youre coming down down down  
Youre coming down down down down down  
  
As all these weeks roll by I wonder why  
You wont talk with me why  
Why does it make me crazy when I know  
Youre coming down down down  
Youre coming down down down down down  
  
Come talk with me  
Take off your coat  
Sit down for a while  
Stick around for a while
