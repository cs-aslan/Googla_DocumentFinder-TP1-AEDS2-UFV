Looking for another chance for someone else to be  
Looking for another place to ride into the sun  
  
Ride into the sun ride into the sun  
Ride into the sun ride into the sun  
Where   
  
everything seems so pretty  
But if youre tired and youre sick of the city  
Remember that its just a flower made out of clay  
Oh the city  
  
Where everything seems so dirty  
But if youre tired and youre filled with selfpity  
Remember that youre just one more person whos there  
  
Its hard to live in the city  
Its hard to live in the city oh  oh  oh  
Its hard to live in the city oh  wow  wow  
Its hard to live in the city
