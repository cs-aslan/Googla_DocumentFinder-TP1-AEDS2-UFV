I couldnt wait forever  
Did you expect me to  
I guess you thought Id never  
Find somebody new  
I lived on dreams and promises  
As long as I could  
I couldnt wait forever  
The way you thought I would  
The lonely nights grew longer  
As I prayed for time to fly  
I lived on hopes that youd return  
And thats how I got by  
The agony of loneliness  
Just got too much for me  
I couldnt wait forever  
Needing love so desperately  
  
So I found new lips to kiss me  
New arms to hold me tight  
I found new love and happiness  
To fill these empty nights  
You took my love for granted  
Now my heart has found a new home  
I couldnt wait forever  
Forevers just too long  
I couldnt wait forever  
Forevers just too long
