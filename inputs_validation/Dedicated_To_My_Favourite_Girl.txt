You have given me the best of you  
And you have made my dreams come true  
And after all the things that you have done  
Girl it makes me say that you are more than a woman  
  
So Im Dedicating this one to my favorite girl  
Shes the only woman in the whole wide world  
Dedicating this one to my favorite girl  
Shes the only woman in the world for me  
  
Never thought that love could be so kind  
Till you came and brought me peace of mind  
Ill treasure every moment spent with you  
Cause no one does the things for me you do  
  
So Im Dedicating this one to my favorite girl  
Shes the only woman in the whole wide world  
Dedicating this one to my favorite girl  
Shes the only woman in the world  
  
Dedicating this one to my favorite girl  
Shes the only woman in the whole wide world  
Dedicating this one to my favorite girl  
Shes the only woman in the world 2 times
