Afternoon see a guy with rubies on his head  
And hes shifting like shifting like he was dead  
And hes hearing something she never said  
On his way back home under his bed  
  
When the weight comes down  
When the weight comes down  
  
In the night theres a girl who doesnt mind her ragged sleeves  
Knowing someone soon is gonna grieve  
And a man he tells her a story she just wont believe  
Called Adam never could do right by Eve  
  
And the weight comes down  
And the weight comes down  
And the weight comes down  
Down on you down on me  
And a girl walks by the burning bush  
She asks whats going on here man  
And he smiles says open wide wide wide  
  
In my dreams a candy coated train comes to my door  
With a little girl I cant have anymore  
You know a letter washes up to the shore  
That I cannot read and I probably should ignore  
  
When the weight comes down  
When the weight comes down  
When the weight comes down
