You say you love me  
And I hardly know your name  
And if I say I love you in the candle light  
Theres noone but myself to blame  
But theres something inside  
Thats turning my mind away  
Woh  how I could love you  
If I could let you stay  
  
Its late  and Im bleeding deep inside  
Its late  ooh is it just my sickly pride  
Too late  even now the feeling seems to steal away  
So late  though Im crying I cant help but hear you say  
Its late  Its late  Its late  
But not too late  
  
Mmm yeah  
The way you love me  
Is the sweetest love around  
But after all this time  
The more Im trying  
The more I seem to let you down yes  
Now you tell me youre leaving  
And I just cant believe its true  
Oh you know that I can love you  
Though I know I cant be true  
Oh you made me love you  
Dont tell me that were through  
  
Its late  mmm and its driving me so mad  
Its late  yes I know but dont try and tell me that its  
Too late  save our love you cant turn out the light  
So late  Ive been wrong but Ill learn to be right  
Its late  Its late  Its late  
But not too late  
  
Mm Ive been so long  
Youve been so long  
Weve been so long tryin to work it out  
I aint got long  
You aint got long  
Weve gotta know what this lifes all about ooh  
Tell me  
Tryin to work it out yeah ooh  
Ooh too late yeah too late much too late aaah  
  
Youre staring at me  
With suspicion in your eye  
You say what game are you playing  
Whats this that youre saying  
I know that I cant reply  
If I take you tonight  
Is it making my life a lie  
Oh you make me wonder  
Did I live my life right  
  
Its late  ooh but its time to set me free  
Its late  ooh yes I know but theres no way it has to be  
Too late  so let the fire take our bodies this night  
So late  let the waters take our guilt in the tide  
Its late  Its late  Its late  Its late  
Its late  Its late  Its late  
Oh Its all too late  
  
Woah woah cmon  
Ooh m m m m late too late oh yeah  
Waaa
