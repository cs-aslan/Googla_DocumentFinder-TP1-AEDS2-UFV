Cold winds may blow over icy seas  
And Ill take with me the warmth  
A taste of honey  
Tasting much sweeter than wine  
Ill leave behind my heart to wear  
And may it always remind you of  
A taste of honey  
Tasting much sweeter than wine  
Ill return I will return  
Ill come back for the honey and you  
He never came back to his love so fair  
And so she died dreaming of his kiss  
His kiss was honey  
Tasting more bitter than wine  
Ill return I will return  
Ill come back for the honey and you  
Ill come back for the honey and you
