Order huh  
Yo we at war  
We at war with terrorism racism but most of all we at war with ourselves  
  
Jesus Walks  
God show me the way because the Devils tryin to break me down  
Jesus Walks with me with me with me with me with me  
  
You know what the Midwest is  
Young and Restless  
Where restless niggas might snatch ya necklace  
And next these niggas might jack ya Lexus  
Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is  
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is  
Top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless  
Try to catch it its kinda hard  
Getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method  
They be asking us questions harass and arrest us  
Saying We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast  
Huh Yall eat pieces of shit Whats the basis  
We aint goin nowhere but got suits and cases  
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis  
My Mama used to say only Jesus can save us  
Well Mama I know I act a fool  
But Ill be gone til November I got packs to move I hope  
  
Jesus Walks  
God show me the way because the Devils tryin to break me down  
Jesus Walks with me  
The only thing that I pray is that my feet dont fail me now I want Jesus  
Jesus Walks  
And I dont think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs  
Jesus Walks with me  
I want to talk to God but Im afraid because we aint spoke in so long  
I want Jesus  
God show me the way because the Devils tryin to break me down  
The only thing that I pray is that my feet dont fail me now  
And I dont think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs  
I want to talk to God but Im afraid because we aint spoke in so long so

So long  
Jesus Walks with me  
  
To the hustlers killers murderers drug dealers even the strippers  
Jesus walks for them  
To the victims of welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah  
Jesus walks for them  
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly  
I know He hear me when my feet get weary  
Cause were the almost nearly extinct  
We rappers are role models we rap we dont think  
I aint here to argue about his facial features  
Or here to convert atheists into believers  
Im just trying to say the way school need teachers  
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis thats the way I need Jesus  
So here go my single dog radio needs this  
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus  
That means guns sex lies video tape  
But if I talk about God my record wont get played  
Huh  
Well let this take away from my spins  
Which will probably take away from my ends  
Then I hope this take away from my sins  
And bring the day that Im dreaming about  
Next time Im in the club everybody screaming out  
  
Jesus Walks  
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down  
Jesus Walks with me with me with me  
The only thing that I pray is that me feet dont fail me now
