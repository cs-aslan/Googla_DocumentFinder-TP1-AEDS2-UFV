Yeah ay yo  
2000 its us  
Yo its time to uturn  
Ya heard me  
Youre either with us or against us yo  
  
Its been some years now  
Since we hit the floor to get down  
We always had a step to go with the sound  
Now everybody want to sit around drink and ball  
Remember the snake  
And how the floor used to clear  
And everybody would break  
Whats crunk now used to be called getting to it  
Were bringing it all back  
This is how we do it just  
  
Chorus x 2  
Put your hands up bend your knees  
Bounce around in a circle get down with me  
Oh come on come on  
Its not hard to learn  
Come on come on  
Its called the uturn  
  
In the 80s fresh was the talk  
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk  
In the 90s I had a high flat top  
Doing the wop Pee Wee to the Reebok  
I cant forget about my high school days  
The sound was Bobby Brown  
The dance was the running man  
Now everybody want to push Bentleys  
The year is two everybody do the uturn  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
All you need to do is let go  
Let the tempo take over you  
I came to have a good time  
Let the rhythm deep inside your soul  
Let it lead you to the floor whoa  
  
Chorus
