Im needing lest restraint before  
Im needing to hit the lights and close the door  
Im fine Im fine cause Im  
  
Dripping in this strange design  
None is yours and far less mine  
Hold the wheel read the sign  
Keep the tires off the line  
Just relax youre doing fine  
Swimming in this real thing I call life  
Can I bring a few companions on this ride  
  
Im feeling my hearts not beating anymore  
Im feeling its alright this happened once before  
Im fine Im fine cause Im
