You read the business page  
See how you did today  
You live up on the hill  
Youve got a view that kills  
Never wonder why  
  
Bridge  
After youve counted everything you saved  
Do you ever hit your knees and pray  
You know theres gonna be a judgment day  
So what will you say  
  
Chorus  
No matter what you make  
All that you can take  
Is what you give away  
What you give away  
  
Theres people on the street  
Aint got enough to eat  
You just shake your head  
The measure of a man is one who lends a hand  
Thats what my father said  
  
After youve counted everything you saved  
Do you ever hit your knees and pray  
You know theres gonna be a judgment day  
So what will you say  
  
Chorus  
  
Its what you give away  
  
After youve counted everything you saved  
Do you ever hit your knees and pray  
You know theres gonna be a judgment day  
So what will you say  
  
No matter what you make  
All that you can take  
Is what you give away  
  
You know its not too late  
Its all for Heavens sake  
What you give away  
What you give away  
What you give away
