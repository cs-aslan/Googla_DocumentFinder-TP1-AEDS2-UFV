When the heart of the hundred acre wood is beating  
And time is passing through  
Theres a shadow looking like a rainbows halo  
And there Im resembling you  
  
More than fame  
A name on a tree  
More than power or might  
Sweeter than the treats of a honey bee  
Ill be here through the night  
  
Its comforting to know  
Its comforting to know  
  
Silent as the moon at dawn  
Soothing as a bed filled with hay  
Strong as a hero in the land of old  
Ill be here through the day  
  
Its comforting to know  
Its comforting to know  
  
Greyer than gloom on a rainy afternoon  
Sadder than being sorry for me  
Finer than finding my tail again  
Ill be here for all of thee  
  
Its comforting to know  
Its comforting to know  
  
You only get a few good friends in this life  
Who are devoted and true  
And right here in this now and near  
Its clear that its all of you  
  
Ill find you when youre hard to see  
Ill look for you everywhere  
Youll know just how Im feeling when  
I show you that I care  
  
Its comforting to know  
Its so comforting to know
