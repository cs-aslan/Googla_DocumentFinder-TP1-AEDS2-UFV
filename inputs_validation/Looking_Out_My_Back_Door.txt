Just got home from Illinois locked the front door oh boy  
Got to sit down take a rest on the porch  
Imagination sets in pretty soon Im singin  
  
Doo doo doo lookin out my back door  
  
Theres a giant doing cartwheels a statue wearin high heels  
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn  
A dinosaur Victrola listning to Buck Owens  
  
Doo doo doo lookin out my back door  
  
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band  
Wont you take a ride on the flyin spoon  
Doo doo doo  
Wondrous apparition provided by magician  
  
Doo doo doo lookin out my back door  
  
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band  
Wont you take a ride on the flyin spoon  
Doo doo doo  
Bother me tomorrow today Ill buy no sorrow  
  
Doo doo doo lookin out my back door  
  
Forward troubles Illinois lock the front door oh boy  
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn  
Bother me tomorrow today Ill buy no sorrow  
  
Doo doo doo lookin out my back door
