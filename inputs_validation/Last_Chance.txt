Yo I coulda been had fame  
Jump shot with a stupid ass aim  
Cause you couldnt around the last name  
So my crossover wins the last game  
And its ill right  
Switched up the flow but its still right  
Go back to that yea I still might  
Ima just do me when it feel right uh  
You can bring it any day  
Natural Bad Ass NBA  
Thats my initials  
Thats why officials  
Dont blow the whistle  
Bang bang the pistol  
And Im and Im bossy  
Cant keep these hoes up off me  
Damn the flow nasty coffee  
Dont treat me like the Pope and cross me  
  
Chorus  
Yea this is my last chance oh last chance oh  
Yea this is my last chance then shoot  
Im ready to shoot  
Im ready to shoot ready to shoot  
Im ready to shoot ready to shoot  
Im ready Im ready to shoot ready to shoot  
Im ready Im ready to shoot  
Im ready to shoot  
  
I get it in though  
No sexual innuendo  
Nobody that I can just depend on  
Until I touchdown in the end zone  
And then they come out like roaches  
PPPeck it away like vulchers  
But little did they know  
Distribute the payroll  
Pick up the album pick up the single  
Sadly Im so business savvy  
Similar protocol but the templates vary  
Never been like me and never been like this  
My flows are crisis they scream in high pitch  
Uh gun cock pause  
And Im well aware of the gun laws  
Telling em that Im running for the top Forbes  
Headedtothetop dot org  
  
Chorus  
  
All the days of my life I have been waiting for this time  
Could you believe now its right before my eyes  
Anybody trying to stop me better not fuck with me this time  
Shoot Im ready to shoot into the sky  
  
Yea this is my last chance oh last chance oh  
Yea this is my last chance then shoot  
Im ready to shoot  
Im ready to shoot ready to shoot  
Im ready to shoot ready to shoot  
Im ready to shoot ready to shoot  
Im ready to shoot  
Im ready to shoot  
  
Only one chance one bullet in the gun  
This is my life and I only got one yea  
The safteys off and I put on stars  
Oh stick em up stick em up  
Ready to shoot  
Yeah yeah Im ready to shoot  
This is my life and I only got one yea  
The safteys off and I put on stars  
Get ready Im ready to shoot
