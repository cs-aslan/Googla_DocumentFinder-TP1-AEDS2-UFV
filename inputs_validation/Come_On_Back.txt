Been so long since I last saw you  
Come on back Come on back  
Im just feeling lost without you  
Come on back Come on back  
Because you never you never you never held me tight  
You didnt you didnt treat me right  
  
Chorus  
Why dont you admit you love me  
and come on back come on back  
Say youre always thinking of me  
Come on back Come on back  
Because you never you never you never held me tight  
You didnt you didnt treat me right  
  
Its not so very hard Its not so very hard  
to make me feel this way to make me feel this way  
Its not so very hard I just cant  
Cant find the words the words to say  
Cant find the words the words to say  
  
Chorus  
  
Been so long since I last saw you  
Come on back Come on back  
Im just feeling lost without you  
Come on back Come on back  
Because you never you never you never held me tight  
You didnt you didnt treat me right  
  
Come on back
