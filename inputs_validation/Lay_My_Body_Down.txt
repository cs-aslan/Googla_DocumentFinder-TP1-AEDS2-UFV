Woman youre the closest thing  
I know to peace on earth  
You warm to what feels cold in me  
And healing to what hurts  
  
Woman can you tell me why  
Im driven as I am  
Is there something that I have  
That makes you give a damn  
  
Be my comfort when the world  
Waves me to the ground  
Take me when Ive lost my way  
Let me know Im found  
  
Be a blanket to my soul  
Wrap it all around  
Be a feather babe to me  
And lay my body down  
  
Touch me with your finger tips  
Give my burdens rest  
Tell me not to worry so  
I know that you know best  
  
Lady take my candle stance  
And hold them in your arm  
Lie against me in the dark  
And show me Ive come home  
  
Be my comfort
