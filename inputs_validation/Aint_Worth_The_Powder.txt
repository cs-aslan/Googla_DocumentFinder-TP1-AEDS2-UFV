I came up the hard way  
And fought with my back to the wall  
Sometimes down to nothin  
But right now babe weve got it all  
Looking back now  
When it comes down to facing the truth  
Aint worth the powder  
To blow me to hell without you  
  
Thats my Silver Eagle  
And my name up in lights  
And those big blue white diamonds  
They cant keep me warm late at night  
Here in the spotlight  
My dreams have come true  
But I aint worth the powder  
To blow me to hell without you  
  
Well you know if the time ever comes babe  
When its down to just win lose or draw  
I dont Carewhat they take  
They can take what they want to  
As long as they leave you  
cause youre the most precious thing of all  
  
Take my Silver Eagle  
And my name up in lights  
And those big blue diamonds  
They cant keep me warm late at night  
Here in the spotlight  
My dreams have come true  
But I aint worth the powder  
To blow me to hell without you  
No I aint worth the powder  
To blow me to hell without you
