Work me Lord work me Lord  
Please dont you leave me  
I feel so useless down here  
With no one to love  
Though Ive looked everywhere  
And I cant find me anybody to love  
To feel my care  
  
So ah work me Lord whoa use me Lord  
Dont you know how hard it is  
Trying to live all alone  
Every day I keep trying to move forward  
But something is driving me oh back  
Honey somethings trying to hold on to me  
To my way of life  
  
So dont you forget me down here Lord
