Sure gets funny thinkin bout money  
Makin my daily bread  
The more you make the more they take  
You never seem to get ahead  
You break your backs just to pay your tax  
Then you dont like the way that its spent  
Somewhere back we jumped the track  
This isnt what the governmeant  
  
Bet my now Ive made a hundred thou  
But I aint saved a dime  
The IRS came out best  
They got my money every time  
  
It cant be fair when the millionaire  
Never has to give them a cent  
Sad to say weve lost the way  
This isnt what the governmeant   
  
Then the war  dont know what for  
Somebody said it had to be fought  
Ise sposed to go but I said no  
Cause Ise afraid I might get shot  
but here I am on my hands and knees  
scrubbin in my dungarees  
I got burned but I finally learned  
This isnt what the governmeant
