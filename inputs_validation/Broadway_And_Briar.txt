I wait for my friends to get off work and stand and smoke  
And a crazy man sits next to me  
Looking down at a pile of his broken dreams  
And he wont even look at me Im still young  
And have so far to go  
And he says to a passerby with a sad sad smile  
does anyone know  
who do I have to kill to see a familiar face in this town  
It seems like all my old friends have moved awa why  
I feel like I know what he means  
Will 10 years go by and no one remember my name  
I dont want it to be that way  
But it happened to this guy and Im exactly the same as him  
But Im young and have so far to go  
And Ive seen what happens to pe ople  
Its just years and years of letting lonliness grow he said   
he means youth doesnt last forever and neither do dreams
