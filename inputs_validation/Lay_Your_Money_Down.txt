Put your cards on the table  
Gotta lay your money down  
Show your heart if youre able  
Gotta lay your money down  
  
Ive waited long enough  
This time Im gonna call your bluff  
And see what you got  
And what you been keepin from me  
  
Girl if you really mean it  
Put your lovin on the line  
Cause if Ive never seen it  
How m I gonna know its mine  
  
Baby Im through  
With nothin but talk from you  
Gotta lay your money down  
  
All these moves you been makin  
Like a game of keep away  
Ive had all Im atakin  
Its catchin up to you today  
  
Cause baby Im through  
With nothin but talk from you  
Gotta lay your money down
