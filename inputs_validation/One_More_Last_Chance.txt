She was standing at the front door  
When I came home last night  
A good book in her left hand  
And a rollin pin in the right  
She said youve come home for the last time  
With whiskey on your breath  
If you dont listen to my preachin boy  
Im goin to have to beat you half to death  
  
Give me just a one more last chance  
Before you say were through  
I know I drive you crazy baby  
Its the best that I can do  
Were just some good ol boys a makin noise  
I aint a runnin round on you  
Give me just a one more last chance  
Before you say were through  
  
First she hid my glasses  
Cause she knows that I cant see  
She said you aint goin nowhere boy  
Til you spend a little time with me  
Then the boys called from the honky tonk  
Said theres a party goin on down here  
Well she mightve took my car keys  
But she forgot about my old John Deere  
  
So give me just a one more last chance  
Before you say were through  
I know I drive you crazy baby  
Its the best that I can do  
Were just some good ol boys a makin noise  
I aint a runnin round on you  
Give me just a one more last chance  
Before you say were through
