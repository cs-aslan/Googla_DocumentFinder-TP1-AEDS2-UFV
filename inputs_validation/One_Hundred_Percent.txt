I am a dream  
Just beginning  
Truth is I prayed  
And you opened my eyes  
And you revealed  
Something to me  
Suddenly I am no longer confined  
  
To a life thats defined by limits  
I dont need no permission to live it  
Imma break through the door til I get in  
Everything that I got Im gonna give it  
  
One hundred percent  
And I aint stopping  
Til I reach the finish  
  
Im a believer  
Not just a dreamer  
Im giving everything I got  
Im a gogetter  
One hundred percenter  
Undoubtedly I can reach the top  
  
I aint gonna let nothing  
Discourage or dissuade me  
Cause Im walking out of here  
A champion either way babe  
Im giving it one hundred percent  
So go on put your ones up  
  
If youre puttin in one hundred  
Put your ones up ones up  
If you know that this is something  
Put your ones up ones up  
If you really comprehend this  
Put your ones up ones up  
If youre walking into victory  
Keep on shining One hundred  
One hundred percent  
  
You can only do it  
If you do it  
Like I did  
Cause suffering  
Aint easy but  
If you can  
Turn your wounds  
Into living proof  
That you survived  
The fight  
And youre no longer defined  
  
To a life thats defined by limits  
I dont need no permission to live it  
Imma break through the door til I get in  
Everything that I got Im gonna give it  
  
One hundred percent  
And I aint stopping  
Til I reach the finish  
  
Im a believer  
Not just a dreamer  
Im giving everything I got

One hundred percenter
