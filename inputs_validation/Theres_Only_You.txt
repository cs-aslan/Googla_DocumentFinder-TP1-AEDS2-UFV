Ive been missing you and  
I dont know what there is for me to do  
But hope and wish and pray  
Love will find its way from me to you one day  
And I would stay inside your world forever more  
  
Theres no place to hide I could never run  
From what I feel inside  
Seems all I have is you and I want to make  
You love me deep and true  
And if you do I want to learn to be a part of you  
  
When theres no one to believe in  
My fantasies run wild  
I make it easy on myself  
I just dream of how the world would be  
If there were only you and me and no one else  
  
I could easily believe in love cause  
You would never let me down  
You bring such happiness to me  
And to prove how true my love would be  
Id hold you very high for the world to see  
  
Ill be missing you  
And I dont know what there is for me to do  
But Ill remember you  
It seems Im in the world alone with only you  
For me to love and to be loved  
Theres only you  
There is only you
