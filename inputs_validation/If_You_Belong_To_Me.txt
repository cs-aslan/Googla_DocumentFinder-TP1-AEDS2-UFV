I left you crying on that angry morning  
You know I lied  
Ill always run from anything that loves me to my safe side  
My world circles round a different sun  
Thats all burned away  
I know that youre the only one  
Now Im walking down some distant street  
And I know your touch is out of reach  
  
Girl you belong to me I know  
And it was wrong for me to ever let you go  
Girl you belong to me I know  
  
Everybody has a lonely moment  
They cant explain  
And everybody wants to feed their hunger  
Without the pain  
  
Theres no shadows in my hiding place  
Im so locked away  
Now I wish that I could see your face  
I know I hurt you when you say were through  
I never really will get over you cause  
  
Girl you belong to me I know  
And it was wrong for me to ever let you go  
Girl you belong to me I know  
  
Girl you belong to me I know  
  
And it was wrong of me to ever let you go
