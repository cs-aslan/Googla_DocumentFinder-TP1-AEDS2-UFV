Chorus  
You cant defeat him  hes fighting for freedom  
Thats all he wanted  thats all he needs  
Youll never beat him with weapons and money  
There aint no chain as strong as the will to be free  
Maybe his colors are driving you crazy  
Call him a commie  maybe its true  
Lure him away from his home with your money  
Give him the work that you dont want to do  
Chorus  
You cant defeat him  hes fighting for freedom  
Thats all he wanted  thats all he needs  
Youll never beat him with weapons and money  
There aint no chain as strong as the will to be free  
See how we honor the struggle for freedom  
They needed vision  we gaveem war  
See who is patiently watching in silence  
The crucification of el salvador  
Chorus  
You cant defeat him  hes fighting for freedom  
Thats all he wanted  thats all he needs  
Youll never beat him with weapons and money  
There aint no chain as strong as the will to be free
