Since the dawn of time  
Ive rolled across the earth  
Spinning in the dust  
Long before your birth  
Eating tar and gasoline  
Every light I see is green  
Open pipes my machines tripleplated chrome  
  
Spirit of the wheel  
  
Wheels of fire burn the night  
Ride across the sky  
Wheels of fire burning bright  
We live to ride  
  
Motors running  
Now youre gonna learn  
Waiting on the line  
Make your tires burn  
Fast faster faster faster  
Speeding always kills  
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills  
  
Spirit of the wheel  
  
Wheels of fire burn the night  
Ride across the sky  
Wheels of fire burning bright  
We live to ride  
  
Blood and thunder on the road  
My heart is pounding  
My blood is nitroglycerine  
Im fire  
Burning burning burning burning  
Ready to explode  
Dont want nothing left of me to scrape off the road  
  
Spirit of the wheel  
  
Wheels of fire burn the night  
Ride across the sky  
Wheels of fire burning bright  
We live to ride  
  
Clouds of smoke  
Tires screaming  
Fire in my hair  
Blown into a thousand pieces  
Scattered everywhere  
Fast burn burning faster  
want to take a ride  
Spirit of the wheel  
Wheels of fire ride  
  
Spirit of the wheel  
  
Wheels of fire burn the night  
Ride across the sky  
Wheels of fire burning bright  
We live to ride
