Outlaw running from the law but hes  
Got nowhere to run to  
Big law he broke it and ran faster  
Than the lightning bolt  
Chasing down the golden sun running away  
From the blue  
He ran with no direction in mind just  
Running like a crazy colt  
  
And hes gonna run let the four winds slap his face  
Hes gonna fly let the sky be his guide  
Hes gonna lie beneath a blanket of stars  
Hes gonna run wild as the western wind  
  
Bad lands are sheltering him maybe Dakotas  
His home  
Red mans become his friend when no one else  
Would have him  
Theres an Indian woman who keeps him from  
Being alone  
She stands tall by his side but the laws  
Got him out on a limb
