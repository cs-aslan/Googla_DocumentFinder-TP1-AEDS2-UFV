Every time I think about you  
Heaven knows I fall into a groove  
Youre like a great interlude  
Every time I think about your body my body says ooh ooh  
Every time I think about you heaven needs a prayer  
Cause youre married and youve even got a family too  
Pray that they dont hear you  
Now let me see you dance on your tippy toe ooh  
  
What a perfect life they think youve got right  
Problems kept inside look neat and organized  
What you need in life is some wonder  
A new friend with visions like you  
  
Nobody has to know Synchronize it  
Stay very close to the floor  
Nobody has to know Synchronize it  
Careful when you close the door  
Nobody has to know Synchronize it  
When we tippy toe tippy toe Just imagine  
My body under your body  
Here we go everybody 3 2 1  
  
Every time I think about you  
Heaven knows I fall into a groove  
Youre like a great interlude  
Every time I think about your body my body says ooh ooh  
Every time I think about you heaven needs a prayer  
Cause youre married and youve even got a family too  
Pray that they dont hear you  
Now let me see you dance on your tippy toe ooh  
  
When the thrill subsides will you still be mine  
Worry infiltrates my head till I kill it  
I fill it instead with improper visions of you  
  
Nobody has to know Synchronize it  
Stay very close to the floor  
Nobody has to know Synchronize it  
Careful when you close the door  
Nobody has to know Synchronize it  
When we tippy toe tippy toe  
Nobody has to know body screaming MORE  
On your mark set 3 2 1  
  
Every time I think about you  
Heaven knows I fall into a groove  
Youre like a great interlude  
Every time I think about your body my body says ooh ooh  
Every time I think about you heaven needs a prayer  
Cause youre married and youve even got a family too  
Pray that they dont hear you  
Now let me see you dance on your tippy toe ooh  
  
Every time I think about you  
Heaven knows I fall into a groove  
Youre like a great interlude  
Every time I think about your body my body says ooh ooh  
Every time I think about you heaven needs a prayer  
Cause youre married and youve even got a family too  
Pray that they dont hear you  
Now let me see you dance on your tippy toe ooh
