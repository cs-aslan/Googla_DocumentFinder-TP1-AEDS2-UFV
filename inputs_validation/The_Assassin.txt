Now the contracts out  
Theyve put the word about  
Im coming after you  
  
Its not the money I make  
Its the thrill of the chase  
And Im coming after you  
  
I watch your every move  
Study the things you do  
And the pattern of your ways  
  
I watch the way you walk  
I hear your telephone talk  
I want to understand the way you think  
  
Chorus x2  
Better watch out cause Im the assassin  
Better watch out better watch out  
  
Im in a cold cold sweat  
I taste the smell of death  
I know the moments getting closer  
  
And as you walk to the light  
I feel my hands go tight  
Excitement running through my veins  
  
Ive got you in my sights  
Ive got you dead to rights  
The triggers waiting for my finger  
  
I feel adrenalin rush  
Its just the final touch  
You can kiss your ass goodbye  
  
Chorus
