Its just her and the band and the clean up man  
Shes counting up her tips she did alright  
She says goodnight  
She drives home to a threeroom flat  
Checks her machine and she feeds the cat  
Shes almost asleep before she turns out the light  
  
In her dreams she rides wild horses  
And they carry her away on the wind  
And they never make a sound  
As they fly above the ground  
Tonight she rides wild horses again  
  
Shes fallen in love a time or two  
Somehow it always fell through  
But shes strong she carries on  
Her life aint always gonna be this way  
She knows shes gonna shine someday  
But for now shell escape until the dawn  
  
In her dreams she rides wild horses  
And they carry her away on the wind  
And they never make a sound  
As they fly above the ground  
Tonight she rides wild horses again  
  
In her dreams she rides wild horses  
And they carry her away on the wind  
And they never make a sound  
As they fly above the ground  
Tonight she rides wild horses again  
  
In her dreams she rides wild horses  
And the carry her away on the wind  
And they never make a sound  
As they fly above the ground  
Tonight she rides wild horses again
