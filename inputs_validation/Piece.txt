You fight for peace but wheres the war what the fuck are doing this for  
You say disarmament thats the key well thats not the way it looks to me  
You wear you leather jacket but you wont eat meat piece punk get drunk  
Sake you hair go out hang out do you really care theres no easy answers  
Complaining wont do shit if you want some changes dont be a hypocrite  
Fuck the system thats what they say but they live by it everyday food stamps  
And welfare checks would you rather starve to death you wear your leather  
Jacket but you wont eat meat piece punk get drunk sake your hair go out  
Hang out do you really care dont you feel ridiculous now half your  
Wardrobe comes from a cow do you believe in anarchy who are you  
Really trying to be
