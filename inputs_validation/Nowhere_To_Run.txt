Night aint a friend  
Its black and so still  
It waits like a cat  
Then moves in for the kill  
It casts its shadows high on the wall  
Its givin me no peace at all  
Now youre gone  
The pain goes on  
Youre so deep into me  
Now Im begging you to  
Set me free  
  
Chorus  
Ive got nowhere to run  
Nowhere to hide  
No way to stop  
This hurt deep inside  
That you gave to me  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to run  
  
The sound of your voice  
It comes in the night  
It stays with me there  
Until the light  
When you say the words  
That you said before  
  
When you said youd stay  
You walked out the door  
I can take the afternoon  
But then comes the night  
Instead I walk the floor  
Till the light
