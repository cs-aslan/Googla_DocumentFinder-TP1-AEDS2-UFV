Something make my head blur  
Oh oh

The drums are four on the floor  
Shes back to the bedroom for one more

Who cant stop staring at the mirror at the mirror  
  
I want to make you as lonely as me  
So you can get get addicted to this

Oh oh  
Its a three and two pitch to walk to anywhere else no  
  
The drums are four on the floor  
Shes back to the bedroom for one more

Who cant stop staring at the mirror at the mirror

So you can get get addicted to this  
You can get get addicted to this now
