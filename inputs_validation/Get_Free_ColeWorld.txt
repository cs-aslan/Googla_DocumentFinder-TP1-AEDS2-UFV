J Cole  Verse 1  
Strictly for the survivors  
The 800 number dodgers  
Boy what I tell ya ass bout picking up that phone  
When the number unknown  
Tell them people I aint home  
Half black learning white lies  
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys  
Too ashamed to bring around cause her homegirlsll clown like  
Girl I aint know you like em bitesize  
She embarrassed now  
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now  
They probably think Im no good for em  
Too dark too thick too hood for em  
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what Im doing here  
They got me feeling like a job interview in here  
They asking questions about a 5 year plan  
She saying who Im foolin they could never understand  
They could never understand

Look at me  
I Just cant believe  
What theyve done to me  
We could never get free  
I just wanna be I just wanna be  
Look at me  
I Just cant believe  
What theyve done to me  
We could never get free  
I just wanna be  
I just wanna dream  
  
J Cole  Verse 2  
fuck is that smell  
I smell bullshit it must be an election year  
The more I listen man the more you sound less sincere  
Still Im wathcing cnn tryna keep up  
In my interviews maybe I should speak up  
Tell the world how I feel like you lying all the time  
And keep em niggas walking blind all the time  
But the same niggas think Im fucking dimes all the time  
Like Im walking round with money on my mind all the time  
And I feed into it  
Id rather make tracks where I bleed into it  
The singles only the look to sell these niggas the book  
I can only pray that one day youll read into it  
If not fuck it I got my own problems  
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums  
I zone out that old sound that Ive grown out of  
Was born out of being broke with hope  
But it dont matter Im on Saturn now and I wont shatter  
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow Im gonna gather my thoughts  
As sharp as a bow and arrow  
Back when I had no dough and no apparrel  
My flows thorough now Im more aware of the A nigga face  
Loaded pistols with nickle plates the nigga fake  
Thats why I call the shit a race  
Tha gony of defeat w ish the elite could get a taste  
  
Chorus  
Look at me  
I Just cant believe  
What theyve done to me  
We could never get free  
I just wanna be I just wanna be  
Look at me  
I Just cant believe  
What theyve done to me  
We could never get free  
I just wanna be  
I just wanna dream

Were all together in the same boat  
I know you you know me  
Baby you know me  
Were all together in the same boat  
I know you you know me  
Baby you know me  
Were all together in the same boat  
I know you you know me  
Baby you know me  
I Just wanna dream  
I Just wanna dream  
I Just wanna dream  
Baby you know me
