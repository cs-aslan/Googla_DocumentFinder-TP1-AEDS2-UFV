Tar and feathers hide your feelings  
If you even know the meaning  
Your high road is overrated  
You left your guru out there hangin  
  
Dont stay  
Dont stay  
  
Your appetites insatiable  
Devouring one thousand souls  
Its more or less the same ol story  
The princess and the whore the lady  
  
Dont stay  
Dont stay  
  
Chorus  
Nobody sees it nobody sees it  
Nobody hears it nobody hears it  
Nobody breathin in a coma  
So keep your secret so keep your secret  
Your perfect secrets your little secrets  
Its just a game but no ones playin  
  
In a coma lying waiting  
Desire fills the lonely craving  
So many trampledunder footwear  
But more to fill the trophy cases  
  
Dont stay  
Dont stay  
  
Chorus x2
