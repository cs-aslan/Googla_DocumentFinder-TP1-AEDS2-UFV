Lucys a woman who lives just for kicks  
And I guess Ill never change her  
Does what she wants to  
She knows all the tricks  
No  
Ill never rearrange her  
  
La la Lucy  
La la la Lucy  
Im telling you what you gonna do  
La la Lucy  
La la la Lucy  
Its all overforyou  
Dont you know that its true  
Because you know I told you once before  
No messing or youre out that door  
I mean and I meant it thel  
Aint gonna take you woman back again  
La la la Lucy  
La la la Lucy  
Its all over for you  
Dont you know that its true  
  
Her time will come when shes out on her own  
Then she wont have me to depend on  
Then shell find out as she sits all alone  
Shes got no one to lean on  
  
La la Lucy  
La la la Lucy  
Im telling you what you gonna do
