I saw an ant devour sherman mountain  
Slip across the floor in the river of honey  
I saw the locust drinking from a fountain  
It smiled at me as I paid my money  
Chorus  
Caus Im a witness witness see the writing on the wall  
Im a witness witness I say Ive seen it all  
Caus Im a witness witness Ive got all the proof  
Im a witness witness I swear to tell the truth  
I saw her buying in the face of fashion  
Wholl believe with her little white lies  
I saw her arrive on my bed of passion  
But I never saw a look of love in her eyes  
Chorus  
Some days my eyes can see for miles and miles around  
Some nights my dreams just take me deep underground  
My minds a time machine Im in the future and the past  
The past scrape away  
violin solo  
Chorus  
Chorus  
Witness witness witness  
Witness witness witness  
Witness witness witness  
Witness witness witness
