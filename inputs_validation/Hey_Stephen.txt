Hey Stephen I know looks can be deceiving  
But I know I saw a light in you  
And as we walked we would talk  
And I didnt say half the things I wanted to  
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window  
Ill be the one waiting there even when its cold  
Hey Stephen boy you might have me believing  
I dont always have to be alone  
  
Chorus  
Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel  
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so  
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you  
Cant help it if theres no one else  
Mmm I cant help myself  
  
Hey Stephen Ive been holding back this feeling  
So Ive got some things to say to you  
Ive seen it all so I thought  
But Ive never seen nobody shine the way you do  
The way you walk way you talk way you say my name  
Its beautiful wonderful dont you ever change  
Hey Stephen why are people always leaving  
I think you and I should stay the same  
  
Chorus  
Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel  
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so  
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you  
Cant help it if theres no one else  
Mmm I cant help myself  
  
Theyre dimming the street lights youre perfect for me  
Why arent you here tonight  
Im waiting alone now so come on and come out  
And pull me near and shine shine shine  
  
Hey Stephen I could give you fifty reasons  
Why I should be the one you choose  
All those other girls well theyre beautiful  
But would they write a song for you  
  
Chorus  
Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel  
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so  
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you  
Cant help it if theres no one else  
  
I cant help myself if you look like an angel  
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so  
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you  
Cant help it if theres no one else  
Mmm I cant help myself  
Myself  
Mm  
I cant help myself  
I cant help myself  
Oh Oh  
Mm  
Mm
