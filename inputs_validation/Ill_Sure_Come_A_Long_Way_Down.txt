Take out all my hair blonde today to change my homy touch  
Ill even learn a joke to tell that makes my pale face blush  
Ill change the high neck dress I wear to low cut dress I found  
To come up to what youre wantin Ill sure come a long way down  
Ill put on heavy makeup so the real me wont show through  
Ill be the thing I hate the most if I cant be with you  
Ill come to the dark and dirty streets in the roughest part of town  
To come up to what youre wantin Ill sure come a long way down  
 steel   
Ill wear my lipstick much too red and a dress that fits too tight  
Ill be the kinda girl you want to fit into your life  
Ill give up everything thats good rechange to the things you bound  
To come up to what youre wantin Ill sure come a long way down  
Ill put on heavy makeup
