In my loneliness  
When youre gone and Im all by myself  
And I need your caress  
I just think of you  
And the thought of you holding me near  
Makes my loneliness soon disappear  
  
Though youre far away  
I have only to close my eyes  
And you are back to stay  
I just close my eyes  
And the sadness that missing you brings  
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings  
  
Yes I love you so  
And that for me is all I need to know  
I will wait for you  
Till the stars fall from out of the sky  
But what else can I do  
I will wait for you  
Meditating how sweet itll be  
When you come back to me  
  
Just the memory of your little smile  
Makes everything worthwhile  
Youre so right for me  
There could never be anyone new  
Could thrill me the way that you do  
No I wont forget  
For though youre gone I feel your nearness yet  
  
Oh I will wait for you  
Til the stars fall from out of the sky  
But what else can I do  
I will wait for you  
Meditating how sweet love will be  
When you come back to me
