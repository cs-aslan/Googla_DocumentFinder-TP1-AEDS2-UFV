Chorus   
The chances you gave me  
A definite maybe  
But luck shes a lady stayed  
She played for me  
  
Theres gold in the mountain  
Good fortune for countin  
Three coins in the fountain  
And my luck wont change  
  
Take dust from the coalmine  
Make dust from the goldmine  
King Midas youre sidelined  
And my luck wont change no my luck remains  
  
Chorus   
  
No point in shouting  
Whoever there was doubting  
Im at the top of the mountain  
And my luck wont change  
  
The stock market read it  
The rumors they spread it  
And I meant it when I said it  
That my luck wont change  
No my luck remains  
  
That old lover lost me  
She spent and she cost me  
My new love has taught me  
That my luck wont change  
my luck wont change my luck remains  
  
Chorus   
  
The offer she made me  
Was more than just maybe  
But luck whos a lady stayed  
She played for me  
  
Repeat 1st verse  
  
Chorus   
  
My temperatures rising  
No point in disguising  
The phoenix is arising  
And my luck wont change no it just remains
