  
Some children see Him lily white  
The baby Jesus born this night  
Some children see Him lily white  
With tresses soft and fair  
Some children see Him bronzed and brown  
The Lord of heavn to earth come down  
Some children see Him bronzed and brown  
With dark and heavy hair  
  
Some children see Him almondeyed  
This Savior whom we kneel beside  
Some children see Him almondeyed  
With skin of yellow hue  
Some children see Him dark as they  
Sweet Marys Son to whom we pray  
Some children see him dark as they  
And ah they love Him too  
  
The children in each different place  
Will see the baby Jesus face  
Like theirs but bright with heavenly grace  
And filled with holy light  
O lay aside each earthly thing  
And with thy heart as offering  
Come worship now the infant King  
Tis love thats born tonight
