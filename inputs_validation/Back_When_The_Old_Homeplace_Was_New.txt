Well the children come back to see the old homeplace  
They dont see a thing that they like  
The old well out back with its cool clear water dont fit into their style of
life  
The old gravel road that leads to the old homeplace gets dust on their new
shiny cars  
Well they didnt complain about nothing to do back when the old homeplace was
new  
Back when the old homeplace was new there was plenty to see and to do  
But they cant remember and I aint gonna tell em  
Back when the old homeplace was new  
  
Harmonica  
  
Theres an old swimming hole about a half mile away  
An old tire still swings from a tree  
Ive got an old jar full of lightening and bugs and a dogfishin werent just
today  
They cant get on line from my old telephone and I aint got no cable TV  
Oh we used to tell stories and some of them true  
Back when the old homeplace was new  
Back when the old homeplace  
  
Harmonica  
  
Well the toys they treasured are stashed in the attic except for a rusty old
bike  
Theres a big ball of string in a drawer in the kitchen  
They used to use flying their kites  
Theres a battered old can out there by the toolshed  
An old can that they used to kick  
They sit on the porch and they stare down the driveway  
They just cant see living like this  
Back when the old homeplace
