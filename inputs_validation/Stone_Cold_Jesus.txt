Bought a oneway ticket to the resurrection  
Got devil gone down on me  
Its a nonstop no meal no connection  
Devildevil all over me  
Hero baby here baby plant one on your daddys cheek  
Got devil all over me  
Ill be gone for a minute but no more that a week  
Devildevil all over me  
Gone through livin just for dyin  
Hear what I say  
Tacked to a six by nine  
To please us  
Look like you get what you want  
You a stone cold Jesus  
Theres a movement to yeah thares an inc  
Got devil gone down on me  
With a oneman twobit congregation  
Devildevil all over me  
Here babyhere baby hammer down on the weak  
Got devil all over me  
With eternty gone you will inherit the meek  
Devildevil all over me  
Gone through livin just for dyin  
Gone through laughin gone through cryin  
Hear what I say  
You know I seem to lost my way  
Seem to happen everyday  
Not sure where Im goin  
Or where I been  
You know it seems to cover me  
With fullblow mediocrity  
Not sure where Im goin  
Or where I sinned  
In quiet desperation claw  
On my soul I feel them gnaw  
Without hesitation render me  
Unconscious in too much too soon  
I long for days inside the womb  
Without hesitation comfort me  
I wait for salvation come  
You know it keep me on the run  
And put me in this place and keep me here  
I know I got my cross to bear  
I keep it with me everywhere  
Keeps me in the race that keep me here  
Got a stone cold Jesus
