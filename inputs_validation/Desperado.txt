Im a gambler  
And Im a runner  
But you knew that  
When you lay down  
  
Im a picture  
Of ugly stories  
Im a killer  
And Im a clown  
  
Step into the street by sundown  
Step into your last goodbye  
Youre a target just by living  
Twenty dollars will make you die  
  
I wear lace  
And I wear black leather  
My hands are lightning up  
On my gun  
  
My shots are clean  
And my my shots are final  
My shots are deadly  
And when its done  
  
Youre as stiff as my smoking barrel  
Youre as dead as a desert night  
Youre a notch  
And Im a legend  
Youre at peace  
And I must hide  
  
Tell where the hell Im going  
Let my bones fall in the dust  
Cant you hear that ghost thats calling  
As my Colt begins to rust  
In the dust  
  
Im a killer  
Im a clown  
Im a priest  
Thats gone to town
