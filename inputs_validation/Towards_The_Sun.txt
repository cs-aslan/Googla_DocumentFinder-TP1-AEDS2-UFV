Chorus  
Turn your face towards the sun  
Let the shadows fall behind you  
Dont look back just carry on  
And the shadows will never find you  
  
Turn your face towards the sun  
Let the shadows fall behind you  
Dont look back just carry on  
And the shadows will never find you  
  
Verse 1  
Lost in the rock and roll  
Got lost in a promise  
Of a love I never know  
Shadows chase me far from home  
I remember when my heart was filled with gold  
And you know  
Ive been burned  
Ive been burned  
Ive been burned  
Youve seen me lose control  
Its not worth  
Its not worth  
Its not worth  
My soul  
  
Chorus  
Turn your face towards the sun  
Let the shadows fall behind you  
Dont look back just carry on  
And the shadows will never find you  
  
Verse 2  
Lost my faith and trust  
You and I know  
Gold dont turn to rust  
I still swear that we can reign  
Like the kings and queens of better yesterdays  
And you know  
Ive been burned  
Ive been burned  
Ive been burned  
Youve seen me lose control  
Its not worth  
Its not worth  
Its not worth  
My soul  
  
Chorus  
Turn your face towards the sun  
Let the shadows fall behind you  
Dont look back just carry on  
And the shadows will never find you  
  
Bridge  
Where you gonna go  
Where you gonna go  
Where you gonna run to  
When you get to the edge of the night  
Its time you face the sky  
  
Chorus  
Turn your face towards the sun  
Let the shadows fall behind you  
Dont look back just carry on  
And the shadows will never find you  
  
Turn your face towards the sun  
Let the shadows fall behind you  
Dont look back just carry on  
And the shadows will never find you
