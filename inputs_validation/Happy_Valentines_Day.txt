My name is Cupid Valentino the modern day Cupid  
And I just want to say one thing  
Happy Valentines Day  
Every day the 14th  
I dont think yall heard me  
I just wanna say Happy Valentines Day  
Every day the 14th  
Can yall dig that  
Now when arrows dont penetrate see  
Cupid grabs the pistol Uh yeah now now lookie here  
And he shoots straight for your heart  
And when he wont miss you  
Thats alright cause yall wont believe in me anyways  
But  
Ya wont believe in me but you would fancy  
Leprechauns or groundhogs  
No thank you Easter Bunny  
Theres all this talk about Santa Claus but see  
Love will rule reign supreme  
Happy Valentines Day  
Every day the 14th You got it  
When Cupid knocks at your door  
You cant ignore me  
Theres no need to run  
So Happy Valentines Day Hey  
Every day the 14th  
I may have it all wrong see  
If you know what loves mean well  
Well somebody tell me  
cause they just dont believe in me  
Ya wont believe in me but you would fancy  
Leprechauns or groundhogs  
No thank you Easter Bunny  
Theres so much fuss about Santa Claus but see  
Cupid will not be defeated  
Happy Valentines Day  
Every day the 14th  
Now I know your hearts have grown cold  
And that bothers me  
Now I understand cause I use to be a bad boy in my day  
I know youre trying to protect your lil feelings  
But you cant run away  
Oooh ooh  
Ya wont believe in me but you would fancy  
Hey Dont you supposed to be some kind of player or something  
Bunny  
Well keep on runnin player  
Cause I got my good shoes on  
And I got em tied up tight  
So youre going to find out tonightttttttttt  
Got a sweet lil darling back in my corner  
Below I know I love her but act like I dont want her  
Surrounded by the lonely but yet feel like a loner  
Could be an organ donor  
The way I give up my heart but  
Never know because  shit I never tell her  
Ask me about my feelings Id holla that its irrela  
I dont get myself caught up in the Jello gella  
And puddin pops that others opt to call falling in love but  
For the record have you ever rode a horse  
Would I like for you to take me to Pluto  
I said Of course  
But if you aint a sweety indeedy I wont endorse  
Hans Solo till Im hit by the bullet so may the force  
Be with you and Ill hit you when better time permits  
For now give me examples of why youre the shit  
But how am I to know with the profession that Im in  
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend  
Happy Valentines Happy Valentines  
Happy Valentines Day Happy Valentines Day  
Continue Chorus until fade
