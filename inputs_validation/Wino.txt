Could you be wrong  
Could you be wrong  
To choke on the smoke and the drunkenness  
Drowning in sorrow with each breath  
youre a wino  
A cigarette smoker  
You have a good time  
They call you a joker dont they  
Wino  
Youre a cigarette smoker  
You have a good time  
They call you a joker dont they  
Dont they  
could you be wrong  
Could you be wrong  
Youre happy dying you dont wanna change  
Remove your fix and you feel your pain  
youre a wino  
A cigarette smoker  
You have a good time  
They call you a joker dont they  
Wino  
Youre a cigarette smoker  
You have a good time  
They call you a joker dont they  
Dont they
