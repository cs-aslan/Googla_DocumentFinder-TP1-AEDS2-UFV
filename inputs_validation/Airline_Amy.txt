Met this pretty young stewardess on a nonstop flight  
She showed me to my seat and it was love at first sight  
Now lately Ive been flying to all kinds of places  
That I never really wanted to go  
Cause Ill do anything just to spend a little time  
With the sutest flight attendant I know  
  
You set my everlovin heart on fire Airline Amy  
Tell me Im your favorite frequent flyer Airline Amy  
Found a little piece of heaven on a 747  
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy  
  
Every one of our dates is at thirty thousand feet  
She always points out the exits to me shes so sweet  
You know she gets me my headphones for free  
Refills my coffee cup whenevr I ask  
And you gotta admit my baby looks pretty hot  
When shes wearin that oxygen mask  
  
Well well you set my everlovin heart on fire Airline Amy  
Tell me Im your favorite frequent flyer Airline Amy  
Found a little piece of heaven on a 747  
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy  
  
Amy darlin dont you know you really drive me nuts  
Every time youre handing out those honey roasted peanuts  
Airline Amy this is my new mission  
Gotta get you in an upright locked position  
  
Oh yeah you set my everlovin heart on fire Airline Amy  
Tell me Im your favorite frequent flyer Airline Amy  
Found a little piece of heaven on a 747  
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy  
Yeah yeah you set my everlovin heart on fire Airline Amy  
Youre the only woman I desire Airline Amy Found a little piece of heaven on
a 747  
And no one else can take me higher  
No one else can take me higher  
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy
