Nothing can come between us  
Nothing gets you down  
Nothing strikes your fancy  
Nothing turns you on  
Somebody is waiting in the hallway  
Somebody is falling down the stairs  
Set someone free break someones heart  
Stand up help us out  
  
Evrything is divided  
Nothing is complete  
Evrything looks impressive  
Do not be deceived  
You dont have to wait for more instructions  
No one makes a monkey out of me  
We lie on our backs feet in the air  
Rest and relaxation rocket to my brain  
  
Snap into position  
Bounce till you ache  
Step out of line  
And you end up in jail  
Bring me a doctor  
I have a hole in my head  
But they are just people  
And Im not afraid  
Doctor Doctor  
We have nothing in our pockets  
We continue  
But we have nothing left to offer  
Faces pressed against the window  
Hey they are just my friends  
Check this out dont be slick  
Break our backs it goes like this     
  
We are born without eyesight  
We are born without sin  
And our mama protects us  
From the cold and the rain  
Were in no hurry  
sugar and spice  
We sing in the darkness  
We open our eyes open up  
  
I cant believe it  
And people are strange  
Our presidents crazy  
Did you hear what he said  
Business and pleasure  
Lie right to your face  
Divide it in sections  
And then give it away  
  
There are no big secrets  
Dont believe what you read  
We have great big bodies  
We got great big heads  
Runarunarun it all together  
Check it out  still dont make no sense  
Makin flippy floppy  
Tryin to do my best  
Lock the door  
We kill the beast  
Kill it
