Stop me oh stop me  
Stop me if you think that youve  
Heard this one before  
Stop me oh stop me  
Stop me if you think that youve heard this one before  
  
Nothings changed  
I still love you oh I still love you  
 Only slightly only slightly less than I used to my love  
  
I was delayed I was waylaid  
An emergency stop  
I smelt the last ten seconds of life  
I crashed down on the crossbar  
And the pain was enough to make  
A shy bald buddhist reflect  
And plan a mass murder  
Who said lied Id to her  
  
Oh who said Id lied because I never I never  
Who said Id lied because I never  
I was detained I was restrained  
And broke my spleen  
And broke my knee  
And then he really layed into me  
Friday night in outpatients  
Who said Id lied to her  
  
Oh who said Id lied  Because I never I never  
Who said Id lied  Because I never  
  
Oh so I drank one  
It became four  
And when I fell on the floor  
 I drank more  
  
Stop me oh stop me  
Stop me if you think that youve  
Heard this one before  
Stop me oh stop me  
Stop me if you think that youve heard this one before  
  
Nothings changed  
I still love you oh I still love you  
 Only slightly only slightly less than I used to my love
