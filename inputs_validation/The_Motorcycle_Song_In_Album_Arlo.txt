Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
Chorus  
I dont want a pickle  
Just want to ride on my motorsickle  
And I dont want a tickle  
Cause Id rather ride on my motorsickle  
And I dont want to die  
Just want to ride on my motorcy Cle  
  
It was late last night the other day  
I thought Id go up and see Ray  
So l went up and I saw Ray  
There was only one thing Ray could say was  
  
Chorus  
  
This song is about the time that I was ridin my motorcycle  
Going down a mountain road at 150 miles an hour playin  
My guitar On one side of the mountain road there was a  
Mountain and on the other side there was nothin  there was  
A cliff in the air  
  
Now when youre going down a mountain road at I50 miles  
An hour you gotta be very careful especially if youre playin  
A guitar Especially if that guitar is an acoustic guitar  
Because if its an acoustic guitar the wind pressure is greater  
On the box side than on the neck side because theres  
More guitar on the box side I wasnt payin attention  
  
Luckily I didnt go into the mountain  I went over the cliff  
I was goin at 150 miles an hour sideways and 500 feet down  
At the same time  
  
I knew it was the end I looked down I said Wow Some  
Trip I thought it Well I knew it was I knew it was my last  
Trip and in my last remaining seconds in world I decided  
To write one last farewell song to the world  
  
Put a new ink cartridge in my pen Took out a piece of paper  
I sat back and I thought awhile Then I started writin  
I dont want a pickle  
Just want to ride on my motorsickle  
And I dont want a tickle  
Cause Id rather ride on my motorsickle  
  
And I dont want to die  
Just want to ride on my motorcy Cle   
  
I knew that it wasnt the best song l ever wrote but I didnt  
Have time to change it I was comin down mighty fast  
  
But as you all know and as fate would have it I didnt die I  
Landed on the top of a police car And he died I drove away  
On the road that he was on I came into town at a screamin  
175 miles an hour playin the motorcycle song  
  
I came into town I jumped off my bike the bike went around  
The corner by itself went up on the stand by itself turned  
Itself off  
  
I walked over to my friend He was standin there eatin  
Pickles I said Hi whats happenin He looked at me in the  
Eye and said Nothin  
  
You gotta sing it with that kind of enthusiasm Like you just  
Squashed a cop
