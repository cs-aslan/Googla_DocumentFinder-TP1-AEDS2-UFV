I found out what I wanted I found out when I needed to  
You thought me kindahearted I heard that when I wanted you  
Being wrong isnt easy rights another way  
Being wrong isnt easy rights another way  
  
Awhen you want me just think like youre ready to  
Like me when I want to why me does it have to be  
Everyone tried to tell me rights another way  
Everyone tried to tell me rights another way  
  
Trust me to fall apart trust you to know  
Just you and noone else just me alone  
Why did it have to be I should have known  
Oh I should have known  
  
I cant tell did you mean it Did you mean what I think you did  
I wont give less you need it just a bit could be overhead  
I wont wait for a minute cant hesitate  
I wont wait for a minute cant hesitate  
  
Trust me to fall apart trust you to know  
Just you and noone else just me alone  
Why did it have to be I should have known  
Oh I should have known
