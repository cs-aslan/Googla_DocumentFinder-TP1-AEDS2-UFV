When Im with you Im valuable  
Original and fashionable  
Im totally formidable  
When Im with you  
  
When youre with me invincible  
Im bulletproof unsinkable  
A one off individual  
Thats why youre with me  
  
When I caught you unmissable  
So lovable and kissable  
Completely irresistible  
Thats why I caught you  
  
Without you I am miserable  
Unconfortable in principle  
I think that were inseparable  
Im nothing without you  
  
Now you got me reliable  
Flexible and pliable  
You see its undeniable  
Thats where you got me  
  
Im nothing without you  
A man without a goal  
The last one waiting  
A lost and lonely soul
