You you keep on trying  
Trying to tear me apart  
and I knew from the very start  
that you you steal my heart  
Because of you Im crying  
I never know that you when youre lying  
What we have must be  
You cant hide what you really feel  
  
You had my heart  
Your my dream from the start  
You know I need you baby  
You touch my soul  
Do you want me to go  
I thought I loved you baby  
  
Chorus  
So dont break my heart  
Finish what you started baby  
Dont break my heart  
I cant live without you  
Dont break my heart  
My love was so true baby  
Dont break my heart  
Dont break my heart  
Dont break my heart  
  
You you keep denying  
Denying that you really cared  
Stop Stop Playing this game  
Show me your love is still there  
The love the love I have inside me ever grows  
for ever stronger  
What we have must be  
You cant hide what you really feel  
  
You had my heart  
Your my dream from the start  
You know I need you baby  
You touch my soul  
Do you want me to go  
I thought I loved you baby  
  
Chorus  
So dont break my heart  
Finish what you started baby  
Dont break my heart  
I cant live without you  
Dont break my heart  
My love was so true baby  
Dont break my heart  
ohhh ohhh  
So dont break my heart  
Finish what you started baby  
Dont break my heart  
I cant live without you  
Dont break my heart  
My love was so true baby  
Dont break my heart  
Dont break my heart  
Dont break my heart  
  
You had my heart  
Your my dream from the start  
You know I need you babyyou know I need you baby  
You touch my soul  
Do you want me to go  
I thought I loved you babyi loved you baby  
  
Chorus  
So dont break my heart  
Finish what you started baby  
Dont break my heart  
I cant live without you  
Dont break my heart  
My love was so true baby  
Dont break my heart
