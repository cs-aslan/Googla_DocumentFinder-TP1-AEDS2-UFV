I hate the rain and sunny weather  
And I hate the beach and mountains too  
And I dont like a thing about the city no no  
And I I I hate the country side too  
  
And I hate everything about you  
Everything about you  
  
I dont like a thing about your mother  
And I I hate your daddys guts too  
I dont like a thing about your sister no no  
Cause I I I think sex is overrated too  
  
And I get sick when Im around  
I cant stand to be around  
I hate everything about you  
Everything about you everything about you  
Everything about you  
  
Some say I got a bad attitude  
But that dont change the way I feel about you  
If you think all this might be bringing me down  
Look again cause I aint wearin no frown  
  
I dont really care about your sister  
Forget the little bitch cause I already kissed her  
One thing that I did to your lady  
Put her on the bed and she didnt say maybe  
I know you know everybody knows  
The way it comes the way it goes  
You think its sad well thats too bad  
Cause Im havin a ball and never cared a thing about  
You  
  
Everything about you everything about you  
I get sick when Im around  
I cant stand to be around  
I hate everything about you
