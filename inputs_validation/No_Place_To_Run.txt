Joey rides the subway  
Fast from east to west  
On the street hes number one  
Some say that hes the best  
Got something going on  
In a honkey tonk down town  
He is expected  
Word has got around  
  
The otherside of midnight  
Or in the combat zone  
Meeting no resistance  
Joe stands alone  
  
Night riders prowling  
Out into the night  
Theres someone else out there  
And theyre looking for a fight  
  
Between the rain soaked buildings  
A distant whistle blows  
Fate lies in waiting  
Its hand it never shows  
  
Chorus  
Heart beating like a drum  
Out in this wasteland  
And theres no place baby for us to run  
In Jungle land baby  
Jungle land jungle land  
Jungle land jungle land  
  
Under the railway arches  
Someone calls his name  
Streams out the words  
Come on boy this aint no game  
  
One flash of bright cold stsel  
In a strangers hand  
Kids dance away like shadows  
Theres no one to command  
  
Joeys got his name  
Pairited on the wells  
On the side of buses  
Subways and tenement halls  
  
Chorus  
  
Jungle land jungle land  
Jungle land jungle land  
Jungle land jungle land  
Jungle land jungle land
