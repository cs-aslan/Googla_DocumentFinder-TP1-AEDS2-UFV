Watcher of the skies watcher of all  
His is a world alone no world is his own  
He whom life can no longer surprise  
Raising his eyes beholds a planet unknown  
  
Creatures shaped this planets soil  
Now their reign has come to an end  
Has life again destroyed life  
Do they play elsewhere do they know  
More than their childhood games  
Maybe the lizards shed its tail  
This is the end of mans long union with Earth  
  
Judge not this race by empty remains  
Do you judge God by his creatures when they are dead  
For now the lizards shed its tail  
This is the end of mans long union with Earth  
  
From life alone to life as one  
Think not your journeys done  
For though your ship be sturdy no  
Mercy has the sea  
Will you survive on the ocean of being  
Come ancient children hear what I say  
This is my parting counsel for you on your way  
  
Sadly now your thoughts turn to the stars  
Where we have gone you know you never can go  
Watcher of the skies watcher of all  
This is your fate alone this fate is your own
