Verse 1  
Wasted the more I think the more I think about you  
But no I cant take it  
  
  
PreChorus  
Do your thing on me  
How we used to be  
Is it better now that Im not around  
Things are left astray  
Yelling out your name  
Are you happy now  
Are you happy now  
Chorus  
I dont wanna know know know know  
Whos taking you home home home home  
Im loving you so so so so  
The way I used to love you oh  
I dont wanna know know know know  
Whos taking you home home home home  
Im loving you so so so so  
The way I used to love you oh  
I dont wanna know  
  
Verse 2  
And I every time I go out  
I hear it from this one I hear it from that one  
Mentioning someone new  
Yeah  
Say I dont believe it  
Im losing my head  
Mustve been my bad  
Maybe Im just a fool  
  
Bridge  
Wasted  
The more I drink the more Im thinking about you  
But no I cant take it  
Maybe I should just go on without you no  
  
Chorus 2  
I dont wanna know  
Whos taking you home  
Im loving you so  
The way I used to love you no  
I dont wanna know  
Whos taking you home  
Im loving you so  
The way I used to love you no  
  
Yeah yeah woah oh oh oh
