He said Ill love you till I die  
She told him Youll forget in time  
As the years went slowly by  
She still preyed upon his mind  
  
He kept her picture on his wall  
Went halfcrazy now and then  
He still loved her through it all  
Hoping shed come back again  
  
Kept some letters by his bed  
Dated nineteen sixtytwo  
He had underlined in red  
Every single I love you  
  
I went to see him just today  
Oh but I didnt see no tears  
All dressed up to go away first time  
Id seen him smile in years  
  
He stopped loving her today  
They placed a wreath upon his door  
And soon theyll carry him away  
He stopped loving her today  
  
You know  
She came to see him one last time  
Aww n we all wondered if she would  
And it kept runnin through my mind  
This time hes over her for good  
  
He stopped loving her today  
They placed a wreath upon his door  
And soon theyll carry him away  
He stopped loving her today
