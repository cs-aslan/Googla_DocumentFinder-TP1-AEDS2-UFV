Verse 1 Nicki Minaj  
Here we go again its the game we love  
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs  
You aint play your cards right you had the Ace of Clubs  
Hit you with the Ace of Spade in your face and shrugged  
Blood drippin out your arm on my Asian rugs  
We was just planning a wedding Caucasian doves  
You was just tellin your mans that you hate the clubs  
Now we in the crying game heart laced with slugs  
  
Bridge 1 Nicki Minaj  
Are you alone Do you need someone  
Is it too late to talk Did I wait too long  
Thousand words dont change a thing  
Is it only three Three words that youre missing  
  
PreChorus Jessie Ware  
Where did you go Couldnt see  
I was too busy  
Couldve just said no  
Where would you go I think that I know  
  
Chorus Jessie Ware  
Oooooo Oooooo  
Were back to playing were back to playing  
Oooooo Oooooo  
Were back to playing the crying game  
  
PostChorus Nicki Minaj Jessie Ware x2  
I couldve given everything  
Dont wanna let the tears begin  
Were back to playing the crying game  
  
Verse 2 Nicki Minaj  
Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul  
Where it aint no Easy Pass you got to use the toll  
Aint no cruise control you bout to lose control  
Aint no smilin faces here we slammin doors and dishes  
Sayin we dont miss each other but its all fictitious  
Sayin that we had enough but enough of what  
Another slap to the face another uppercut  
Im just abusive by nature not cause I hate ya  
Not cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya  
I know its hard I know I intimidate ya  
But is you stayin or goin  
I couldnt breathe and you aint even know it  
How come you never show it  
All this love you speak of  
All I want is to love and be loved To love and be loved  
  
Bridge 2 Nicki Minaj  
Im losin a thing I thought Id win  
And Im coming undone cause the tears dont end  
  
PreChorus Jessie Ware  
Where did you go Couldnt see  
I was too busy  
Couldve just said no  
Where would you go I think that I know  
  
Chorus Jessie Ware  
Oooooo Oooooo  
Were back to playing were back to playing  
Oooooo Oooooo  
Were back to playing the crying game  
  
PostChorus Nicki Minaj Jessie Ware x2  
I couldve given everything  
Dont wanna let the tears begin  
Were back to playing the crying game  
  
Outro Jessie Ware  
Oooooo Oooooo  
Oooooo Oooooo
