Standin on the corner of civilization  
Theres a time theres a place for me  
In a world where I cant be found  
Cold and mean people give me the creeps  
  
Going to the jungle where the elephant roams  
Got to get away gonna make it my home  
  
Losing my taste for the human race  
Social grace is a waste of time  
Its absurd when I look around  
So sublime that we blow my mind  
  
Naked in the rain with a killer whale  
I can taste the salt when I lick his tail  
  
Chorus  
Naked in the rain  
Doctor Doolittle whats your secret  
Give it to me doctor  
Dont keep it  
  
I never met an animal that I didnt like  
You can come to me I wont bite  
Dont you know dog is mans best friend  
There is some love that you cant fight  
  
Naked in the rain with black tattoos  
Runnin through the woods laughin at the blues  
  
Chorus  
  
Listen to the talking heart in my chest  
With this gift good Lord I am blessed  
Theres a lump and its in my throat  
Im in love with the wilderness  
  
Naked in the river skinny dippin my way  
In the waterfall I just want to play  
  
Chorus x2
