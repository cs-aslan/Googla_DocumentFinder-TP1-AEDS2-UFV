Sea of sin  
Im swimming in  
And Im taking a dive  
My minds in need  
So my body feeds  
And it keeps me alive  
It gets better and better  
As it gets wetter and wetter  
  
Sea of sin  
Know where youve been  
But I dont care  
  
Sea of sin  
Through thick and thin  
For better or worse  
My minds in need  
So my body feeds  
And it quenches my thirst  
You look cheaper and cheaper  
As we sink deeper and deeper  
  
Sea of sin  
Know where youve been  
Cause Ive been there  
  
Here under Gods sky  
His watchful eye  
And all of the lies  
My consolation prize  
  
Sea of sin  
My second skin  
My home from home  
When Im in doubt  
My hands reach out  
And Im never alone  
It gets wetter and wetter  
As it gets better and better  
  
Sea of sin  
Know where youve been  
And Im prepared  
Sea of sin  
Know where youve been  
Yes Im aware  
Sea of sin  
Know where youve been  
Cause Ive been there  
Sea of sin  
Know where youve been  
And I dont care  
Sea of sin  
Know where youve been  
And I dont care
