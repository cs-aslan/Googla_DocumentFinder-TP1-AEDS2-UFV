Verse 1  
Turn away  
If you could get me a drink  
Of water cause my lips are chapped and faded  
Call my aunt Marie  
Help her gather all my things  
And bury me in all my favorite colors  
My sisters and my brothers  
Still  
I will not kiss you  
Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you  
  
Chorus  
I will not kiss you kiss you  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my call my  
Turn away  
Lips are chapped and faded faded  
Kiss you kiss you  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my call my  
Turn away  
Lips are chapped and faded faded  
Verse 2  
Now turn away  
Cause Im awful just to see  
And all my hairs abandoned all my body  
All my agony  
Know that I will never marry  
Baby Im just soggy from the chemo  
Im counting down the days to go  
This just aint livin  
And I just hope you know  
  
Chorus  
I will not kiss you kiss you  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my call my  
Turn away  
Lips are chapped and faded faded  
Kiss you kiss you  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my call my  
Turn away  
Lips are chapped and faded faded  
  
Bridge  
If you say if you say  
Goodbye today goodbye today  
Ill ask you to be true Ill ask you to be true  
Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you  
Yes the hardest part of this  
  
Outro  
I will not kiss you kiss you  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my Call my  
Lips are chapped and faded faded  
Kiss you kiss you  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my Call my  
Lips are chapped and faded faded
