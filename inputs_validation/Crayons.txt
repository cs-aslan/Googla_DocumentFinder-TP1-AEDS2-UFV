Hey hey oh

1 2 3  
  
Chorus  
  
Were like crayons melting in the sunshine  
Take a big eraser and wipe out the line  
Oh oh whats up tell me whats ahappening  
say you want love but why aint you sacrificing  
were like crayons melting in the sunshine  
Ill color your world if you color mine  
Oh oh whats up tell me whats ahappening  
say you want love but why aint you sacrificing  
  
Come on over you sleepyhead  
its time to color my dress in red  
It dont matter if its day or night  
we play in color not in black in white  
  
Come on lets color the world in green  
Lets make a difference in the way we dream  
Were going to color a smiling face  
on the people of the human race  
  
1 2 3  
  
Ill take a walk on the wild side  
Dont be afraid you can be mine  
In and out in and out in and out of the lines  
Take a walk on the wild side  
Dont be afraid you could be mine  
In and out of the lines in and out  in and out of the lines  
  
Chorus  
  
Everybody dreaming   
  
If we mix in some pink and blue  
We get a beating at a purple hue  
Mellow yellow when the day is done  
Becomes the orange of the setting sun  
  
1 2 3 come on  
  
Ill take a walk on the wild side  
Dont be afraid you can be mine  
In and out in and out in and out of the lines  
Take a walk on the wild side  
Dont be afraid you could be mine  
In and out of the lines in and out  in and out of the lines  
  
Chorus  
  
Red is the color of the blood in our veins oh  
Like the rainbow we are one the same just one yeah  
Everybody dreaming   
Yellow is the color of the sun we share  
The green grass is everywhere  
Everybody dreaming   
  
Chorus
