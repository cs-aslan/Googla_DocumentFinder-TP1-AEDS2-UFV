I saw you there last night  
In the latest place  
You were taking in the scenery  
Hungry for a new face  
Seems what I said to you  
Didnt change your mind  
You could open your eyes realise  
You dont need anyone  
Whos always on the phone  
You dont need anyone  
Who wont leave you alone  
You dont need anyone  
Whod want you to cut him a key  
You dont need anyone  
  
Out on the streets today  
In the clothes you bought  
And your glossy picture pages  
Full of other peoples thoughts  
Will you just wander along  
Live your life this way  
Till some magazine shows you what to do  
  
You dont need anyone  
Whos always on the phone  
You dont need anyone  
Who wont leave you alone  
To fill up the holes in your life  
To tell you what youre needing  
And make you do what you dont like  
  
You dont need anyone  
To show you where to go  
And turn you into somebody  
You wouldnt even want to know  
You dont need anyone  
As far as I can see  
You dont need anyone  
But Me
