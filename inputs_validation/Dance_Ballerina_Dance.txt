Dance ballerina dance  
And do your pirouette in rhythm with your achin heart  
Dance ballerina dance  
You mustnt once forget a dancer has to dance the part  
  
Whirl ballerina whirl  
And just ignore the chair thats empty in the second row  
This is your moment girl  
Although hes not out there applauding as you steal the show  
  
Once you said his love must wait its turn  
You wanted fame instead  
I guess thats your concern  
We live and learn  
  
And love is gone ballerina gone  
So on with your career you cant afford a backward glance  
Dance on and on and on  
A thousand people here have come to see the show  
As round and round you go  
So ballerina dance  
Dance dance  
  
Whirl ballerina  
  
Once you said his love must wait its turn  
You wanted fame instead  
I guess thats your concern  
We live and learn  
  
And love is gone ballerina gone  
So on with your career you cant afford a backward glance  
Dance on and on and on  
A thousand people here have come to see the show  
As round and round you go  
So ballerina dance  
  
Dance
