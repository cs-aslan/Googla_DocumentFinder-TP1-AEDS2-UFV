I can tell your hearts been broken in two  
You are looking for a shoulder  
Ive found out that other peoples tears  
Just seem to make me older  
Id like to help with your broken heart  
Really I think its a crime  
But I aint got the time aint got the time  
All that I can give you is a well wish  
I hate to be that way I know that its selfish  
But baby Ive got a destiny to meet  
And I know its on down the line  
Aint got the time aint got the time  
  
I can tell that youve been hurt pretty bad  
You need someone to cry to  
Youre like a bird with the broken wing  
And you need some place to fly to  
But Ive found out from life  
That I cant live nobodys but mine  
Aint got the time aint got the time  
All that I can give you is a well wish
