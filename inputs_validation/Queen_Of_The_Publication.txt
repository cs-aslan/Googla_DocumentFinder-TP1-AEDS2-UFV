Something strange is going on  
And youre in the middle  
Ill do anything to solve the riddle  
Ive got a city editor  
Put me on a deadline  
If I dont come through  
Im on the breadline  
Ill invade your privacy  
Please dont take it personally  
Im oh so sorry  
But the readers got a right to know  
Youre gonna help the circulation grow  
When I get the story right  
Ill be queen of the publication  
Ive got a hidden camera  
A shadow on your tail  
And Im tape recording every detail  
All the walls have ears tonight  
Theyre listening in case you might  
Talk in your sleep  
Im oh so sorry  
But the readers got a right to know  
Youre gonna help the circulation grow  
When I get the story right  
Ill be queen of the publication  
In every supermarket checkout line  
Theyll be staring at your face  
Make you a legend in your own time  
Give you triple column space  
When I get the story right  
Ill be queen  
Ill be queen  
Ill be queen  
I get the story right  
Ill be queen of the publication  
Im oh so sorry  
But the readers got a right to know  
Youre gonna help the circulation grow  
When I get the story right  
Ill be queen  
Ill be queen  
Ill be queen  
Im queen of the publication
