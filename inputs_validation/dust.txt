If dust could only talk  
What would we hear it say  
Before its brushed aside  
Just as its swept away  
  
Its just the evidence  
Its of no consequence  
Its only flesh and bone  
Why dont you leave it alone  
  
If dust could only gather into lines of chalk  
Around a silhouette detective fiction walks  
For its the only witness that can testify  
Can I spit out the truth  
Or would you rather just swallow a lie  
  
Why did they dam the land  
How did they flood the plain  
Did they erase the name  
And wipe away the stain  
You kept your mouth well shut  
Appeared to turn your coat  
Now theres a name for you but its stuck in my throat  
  
If dust could only mutter  
Or in laughter trill  
If it could warn and whisper from the windowsill  
For its the only witness that can testify  
Can I spit out the truth  
Or would you rather just swallow a lie  
  
Here comes the juggernaut  
Here come The Poisoners  
They choke the life and land  
And rob the joy from us  
Why do they taste of sugar  
When they are made of money  
Here come the Lamb of God  
And the butchers boy Sonny  
  
If dust could only gather in a needle track  
Then it would skip a beat and it would jump right back  
If dust could only gather in a needle track  
Then it would skip a beat  
And all the sense I lack
