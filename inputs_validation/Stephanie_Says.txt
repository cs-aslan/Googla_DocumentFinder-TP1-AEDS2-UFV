Stephanie says  
That she wants to know  
Why shes given half her life  
To people she hates now  
  
Stephanie says  
When answering the phone  
What country shall I say  
Is calling from across the world  
  
But shes not afraid to die  
The people all call her Alaska  
Between worlds so the people ask her  
Cause its all in her mind  
Its all in her mind  
  
Stephanie says  
That she wants to know  
Why it is though shes the door  
She cant be the room  
  
Stephanie says  
But doesnt hang up the phone  
What sea shell she is calling  
From across the world  
  
But shes not afraid to die  
The people all cal her Alaska  
Between worlds so the people ask her  
Cause its all in her mind  
Its all in her mind  
  
Theyre asking  
Is it good or bad  
Its such an icy feeling  
Its so cold in Alaska  
Its so cold in Alaska  
Its so cold in Alaska
