Now the summers come and gone  
I Feel September comin on  
Your still burning on my skin  
Lord I want though sweet rain drops to begin  
Cool this fever and keep home Up on Chery Blossom Road  
  
Now your as mean as I am good  
And Id stop comin here if I could  
You laugh at all my school girl fears  
And you tell me when you want me little girl Ill be here  
Id trade my body for my soul  
Up on Cherry Blossom Road Ooooh yea  
  
So blow cruel wind  
Take me back to his door hell take me in  
I walk away a womanwalk away  
I walk away a womanwalk away  
Walk awaywalk away  
  
In my virgin bed alone  
Like a hostage to the phone  
I know that he aint far away  
And I know that Lord he dont feel this kind of pain  
I hate him lord I want him so  
Up on Cherry Blossom Road Oh Ya  
  
So Blow cruel wind Take me back to his door  
Hell take me in I walk away a womenwalk away  
Walk away walk away walk away
