You can run but you cant hide from the westside  
Night stalker shit talker run and tell them Mr LM  
Nigga with the gat and Im back  
Off the everyday prey that I slay  
Rolling with the fo chase ya through South Central  
Monkey wrench hos should know that shell get the balzac  
Cause Im not staving but fuck that  
Johnny Carson ho never had me on the Late Night Show  
Coming with the shit thatll hitch  
Steady mobbing cause the flavors good  
There goes the neighborhood nigga with the third album  
How come he dont fall off  
Rolling with the sawedoff gauge  
Turn the page of the chapter caught up in the rapture  
But you know Anita she can get the Pita  
Eat em up yum and your flawed  
Muthafuck Billboard and the editor  
Here comes the Predator  
  
Check your head for the new style  
Fuck Lawrence Powell and Presino Wynd and Koon  
Pretty soon well fuck them like they fucked us and wont kiss em  
Riots aint nothing but dodge for the system  
Fighting with the beast no justice no peace  
If any even if we fuck up Denny  
Niggaz are sick of your white mans tricks with no treat  
Thats right now its on on sight  
You call me a Muslim no Im not a resident still got my vote in  
Farrakhan for president a white America Im tearing ya  
A new ass ho whos the nigga with the new black  
Strolling to your suburb house and I douse with gas  
Now whos cleaning up trash  
Eat em up yum and your flawed  
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor  
Here comes the Predator  
  
Get my black rag showing and Im   
Kiss my grips like  or Mels Diner  
Im meaner than a motherfucking Hyena chasing Antelope  
Put a chrome to your dome watch it bust like a Cantelope  
I cant stand a rope so dont try to hang em  
Talk about dogs boy I can sling em  
Rattatattat on your noggin  
Cause Ice will cream your ass like  chocolate  
I get crazy when I catch a rap  
Even be flipping the toungue like  DasEfx  
So who is Ice Cube  
Im a rapper actor macker  
Got a little problem with the redneck cracker  
Get the polly whack her  is a devil shitpacker  
Coming with a crazy pitch  
And the statue of Liberty aint nothing but a lazy bitch  
Dont want to give up the crack to the black  
But you call it racial if we go and break the ho  
But eat em up yum and your flawed  
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor  
Here comes the Predator
