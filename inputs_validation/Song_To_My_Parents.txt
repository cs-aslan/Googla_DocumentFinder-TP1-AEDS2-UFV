I need to say these things cause  
I love you so  
And Im sorry you get angry when I say that  
You just dont know  
  
That theres a heaven waiting  
For you and me  
I know it seems every time we talk  
Im only tryin to just make you see  
  
And its only that I care  
I really only want  
Just to see you there  
  
Please try and overlook my  
My human side  
I know Im such a bad example  
And you know Im so full of pride  
  
But Jesus isnt like that  
No Hes perfect all the way  
I guess thats why we need Him  
Cause by ourselves theres just no way  
  
And its only that I care  
I really really only want to see you there  
Just to see you there  
  
Close the doors  
Theyre just not comin  
We sent the invitations out long long long long time ago  
Were still gonna have a wedding feast  
Big enough to beat them all  
The greatest people in the world just wouldnt come  
So now well just have to invite the small  
  
And its only that I care  
I really really only want  
Just to see you there  
  
Isnt that Jesus  
Isnt that Joseph and Marys son  
Well did He grow up right here  
He played with our children  
  
What He must be kidding  
Thinks Hes a prophet  
Well prophets dont grow up from little boys  
Do they From little boys  
Do they
