Its funny how you never knew what my name was  
Our only contact was a form for the election  
These days I find that you dont listen  
These days I find that were out of touch  
These days I find that Im too busy  
So why the attention now you want my assistance  
What have you done for me  
  
Youve gone and got yourself in trouble  
No you want me to help you out  
  
These days I find that I cant be bothered  
These days I find that its all too much  
To pick up a gun and shoot a stranger  
But Ive got no choice so here I come war games  
  
Im up on the hills playing little boy soldiers  
Reconnaissance duty up at 530  
Shoot shoot shoot and kill the natives  
Youre one of us and we love you for that  
  
Think of honor queen and country  
Youre a blessed son of the British empire  
Gods on our side and so is Washington  
  
Come out on the hills with the little boy soldiers  
Come on outside Ill sing you a lullaby  
Or tell a tale of how goodness prevailed  
  
We ruled the world we killed and robbed  
The fucking lot but we dont feel bad  
  
It was done beneath the flag of democracy  
Youll believe and I do yes I do yes I do  
Yes I do  
  
These days I find that I cant be bothered  
To argue with them well whats the point  
Better to take your shots and drop down dead  
Then they send you home in a pine overcoat  
  
With a letter to your mum  
Saying find enclosed one son one medal and a note  
To say he won
