Ive been keeping on the run  
Ive been traveling with the sun  
Ive been singing all my life and getting by  
Got to keep up with whats going on  
In this place Ive been so long  
And I guess Ill just keep singing all my life  
And its so good to come home  
To a woman all alone  
Forgetting how sad loneliness can be  
She will take me from this world  
Then shell gently take the world away from me  
Ill be coming home at night  
While the kids are sleeping tight  
Shell be lit by firelight and looking fine  
And the kids jump out of bed  
Hello Daddy what did you get  
Did you think of anything on down the line  
Shell be talking with her smile  
Saying honey wait awhile  
The kids have missed you soon theyll be asleep  
She will take me from this world  
Then shell gently take the world away from me  
Oh the prophets and the sages  
And the wise men through the ages  
All thats written down on pages from above  
Just cant adequately describe  
What Im feeling here inside  
Its just useless to be living without love  
And Ill take her by her hand  
Just a woman and a man  
Without trying to understand what we should be  
She will take me from this world  
Then shell gently take the world away from me
