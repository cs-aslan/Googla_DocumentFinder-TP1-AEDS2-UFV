Starting a landslide in my ego  
Look from the outside  
To the world I left behind  
  
Im dreaming  
Youre awake  
If I were sleeping  
Whats at stake  
A day without me  
  
Whatever the feelings  
I keep feeling  
What are the feelings  
You left behind  
  
Todays a day without me  
  
I started a landslide in my ego  
Look from the outside  
To the world I left behind  
  
In the world I left behind  
Wipe their eyes and then let go  
To the world I left behind  
Shed a tear and then let go
