You touch these tired eyes of mine  
And map my face out line by line  
And somehow growing old feels fine  
I listen close for Im not smart  
You wrap your thoughts in works of art  
And theyre hanging on the walls of my heart  
  
I may not have the softest touch  
I may not say the words as such  
And though I may not look like much  
Im yours  
And though my edges may be rough  
And never feel Im quite enough  
It may not seem like very much  
But Im yours  
  
You healed these scars over time  
Embraced my soul  
You loved my mind  
Youre the only angel in my life  
The day news came my best friend died  
My knees went weak and you saw me cry  
Say Im still the soldier in your eyes  
  
I may not have the softest touch  
I may not say the words as such  
And though I may not look like much  
Im yours  
And though my edges may be rough  
And never feel Im quite enough  
It may not seem like very much  
But Im yours  
  
I may not have the softest touch  
I may not say the words as such  
I know I dont fit in that much  
But Im yours
