Theres a way to live thats right for us  
Like Mayans in Manhattan and Los Angeles  
Im scaling up Im breaking down  
And Im doing lunch all over town  
  
Networking Im user friendly  
Networking I install with ease  
Data processed truly Basic  
I will upload you you can download me  
  
Theres a long hard road and a full hard drive  
And a sector there where I feel alive  
Every bit and every byte  
Is written down once on the night  
  
Networking Im user friendly  
Networking I install with ease  
Data processed truly Basic  
I will upload you you can download me  
  
Theres a prayer each night that I always pray  
Let the data guide me through every day  
And every pulse and every code  
Deliver me from the bypass mode  
  
Networking Im user friendly  
Networking I install with ease  
Data processed truly Basic  
I will upload you you can download me
