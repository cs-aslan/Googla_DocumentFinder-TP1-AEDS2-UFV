Every time it rains  
I think of you  
And thats the time  
I feel so blue  
The rain starts to fall  
Across my windows pane  
But its raining teardrops  
From my eyes  
If you see tears  
Here in my eyes  
Its just because  
You said goodbye  
So baby wont you hurry  
Because I love you so  
And its raining teardrops  
From my eyes  
remember the night you told me  
Our love would always be  
I wouldnt be sad and lonely  
If you were here with me  
Every single cloud  
Would disappear  
Id wear a smile  
If you were here  
So baby wont you hurry  
Because I love you so  
And its raining teardrops  
From my eyes
