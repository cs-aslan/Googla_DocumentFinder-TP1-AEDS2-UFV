Working hard eight days a week  
Most days weve got no time to speak  
Feels like Im chasing after my own life  
Girl cant you see youre my only vice  
  
Take the phone off the hook  
Turn the lights down low  
Well play some old Sam Cooke  
Baby let yourself go  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
Ill do anything you want me to but  
All I wanna do is you  
  
I dont care what kinda clothes you wear  
It doesnt matter how you do your hair  
I dont need no champagne on ice  
Girl cant you see that youre my only vice  
  
Turn the whole world off  
Keep your high heels on  
Take it nice and slow  
And make it last til dawn  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
Ill do anything you want me to but  
All I wanna do is you  
  
I dont wanna eat I dont wanna sleep  
Dont wanna sit around and watch TV  
When youre next to me its where I wanna be  
All I wanna all I wanna all I I wanna do  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
Ill do anything you want me to but  
All I wanna do is you  
  
All I wanna all I wanna all I wanna do  
All I wanna do now all I wanna do is you  
Baby is you
