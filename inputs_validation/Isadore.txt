Erica and her Isadore  
Climbed aboard a balloon  
I want more than this kite will soar  
Ive set our sights on the moon  
  
You cant just leave Ive given everything  
I cant believe youre taking everything  
Youre taking everything  
Oh  
  
Its not who you were  
Its who you are  
And weve come this far lover  
No I wont rest  
Until the world  
Knows the name Isadore  
  
Blinded by their unbridled height  
Our lovers turned dissolute  
  
You cant just leave Ive given everything  
I cant believe youre taking everything  
Youre taking everything  
Oh  
  
Its not who you were  
Its who you are  
And weve come this far lover  
No I wont rest  
Until the world  
Knows the name Isadore  
Knows the name Isadore  
  
Then with eyes wide a splintered sight  
Theres just one parachute  
Goodbye Erica now I see  
That my worst fears were in tune  
  
Its not who you were  
Its who you are  
And weve come this far lover  
No I wont rest  
Until the world  
Knows the name Isadore  
  
Knows the name Isadore  
Wont rest  
Until the world  
Knows the name Isadore
