Giving a swish with your ass in the air dont you know what theyre saying  
Charlotte youre so refined when you take all the love that theyre giving  
Sticking with every man that you find dont you know what theyre after  
Charlotte youve got your legs in the air dont you hear all the laughter  
  
Chorus  
Charlotte the Harlot show me your legs  
Charlotte the Harlot take me to bed  
Charlotte the Harlot let me see blood  
Charlotte the Harlot let me see love  
  
Taking so many men to your room dont you feel no remorse  
You charge them a fiver Its only for starters  
And ten for the main course  
And youve got no feelings they died long ago  
Dont you care who you let in  
And dont you know youre breaking the law with the service youre giving  
  
Chorus  
  
There was a time when you left me standing there  
Picking up pieces of love off the floor  
Well Charlotte you left me alone in there  
To make your ends as a bloody whore  
Well Charlotte you told me you love me true  
Picking up pieces of love yesterday  
Well Charlotte youre draws are off color too  
Cause youre making love all day  
  
Giving a swish with your ass in the air dont you know what theyre saying  
Charlotte youre so refined when you take all the love that theyre giving  
Sticking with every man that you find dont you know what theyre after  
Charlotte youve got your legs in the air dont you hear all the laughter  
  
Chorus
