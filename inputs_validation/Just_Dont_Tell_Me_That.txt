Oh oh no no all right  
You got to be seen at every party  
At the playboy mansion  
But sad  
I know I gotta draw the line  
You want to be in  
The flashes of light  
Holding me tight  
With your phony laugh  
I guess  
You gotta be photographed  
  
You can say its real  
But I know where its at  
  
Just dont tell me that  
You are gonna love me  
I dont want to hear it baby  
Tell me that  
Its gonna be your last lie  
No baby I wont go for that  
Even if you did say  
You were gonna be there  
I dont want you back  
Cause its not about love  
Just dont tell me that  
  
You like to drive in my car  
Spend every dollar of my credit  
Baby guess what  
Saw me with your golden eye  
Guess you want to be  
Part of the ride  
Live for the night  
But Ive seen it through  
Had enough of being close to you  
  
You can say its real  
But I know where its at  
  
Just dont tell me that  
You are gonna love me  
I dont want to hear it baby  
Tell me that  
Its gonna be your last lie  
No baby I wont go for that  
Even if you did say  
You were gonna be there  
I dont want you back  
Cause its not about love  
Just dont tell me that  
  
No no its not about love  
No no  
  
You want to be in  
The flashes of light  
Holding me tight  
Girl its all up to you  
But whatever you do  
I dont want to hear it  
  
Youre not gonna love me  
I wont go for that  
It just wont last  
Even if you did say  
You were gonna be there  
I dont want you back  
Cause its not about love  
Just dont tell me that  
  
You are gonna love me  
I dont want to hear it baby  
Tell me that  
Its gonna be your last lie  
No baby I wont go for that  
Even if you did say  
You were gonna be there  
I dont want you back  
Cause its not about love  
Just dont tell me that
