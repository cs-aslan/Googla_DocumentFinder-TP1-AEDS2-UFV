Did you ever fall in love  
At the right time or place  
Does it always have to move  
At its own kinda pace  
  
When youre driving on cruise control  
Coming up a bumpy ride  
And your heart is back in shape  
Then it hits you with no chance to hide  
  
But dont you miss out on the way  
Dont find a reason to say  
  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
But I didnt do that  
You gotta Give it a shot  
Better believe  
And dont say you  
  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
But I didnt do that  
Just throw in everything youve got  
Cause in love theres no holding back  
  
Tell me that you played it safe  
Cause youre afraid to hurt your neck  
On the rollercoaster train  
Never knowing what you get  
  
You think you want to be cynical  
Want to date the best in me  
Giving up the greatest trash  
Who knows what it turns out to be  
  
Dont you miss out on the way  
Dont find a reason to say  
  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
But I didnt do that  
You gotta give it a shot  
Better believe  
And dont say you  
  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
But I didnt do that  
Just throw in everything youve got  
Coz in love theres no holding back  
  
Ooohh  
Its meant to be  
But dont think about it  
Let love run free  
Cause youre on your way  
  
Follow your heart where its calling on you  
Dont you say  
  
But I didnt do that  
I didnt do that baby  
Gotta believe it  
  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
Oh but I didnt do that  
You gotta give it a shot  
Better believe  
And dont say you  
  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
But I didnt do that  
Just throw in everything youve got  
Cause in love theres no holding back  
  
Didnt do that  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
Just throw in everything youve got  
Cause in love theres no holding back
