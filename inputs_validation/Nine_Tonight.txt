She says she wants to see me  
Shes tired of stayin in  
She says she wants some rockin  
Shes got the right man  
Im gonna take her ridin  
Out past the edge of town  
Out where the winds still racin free on the heartland  
Ill be there nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Cant wait for nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
  
Ill be there nine tonight  
Ooh nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
She might be my baby  
She might be mine  tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
She might be mine tonight  
  
Im movin in to action  
Im shinin up mt wheels  
Im tryin hard to think of the right things to say now  
The sun is slowly sinkin  
Here comes a great big moon  
Im startin up my engine  
It wont be long now  
  
Ill be there nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Cant wait for nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
  
Ill be there nine tonight  
Ooh nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
She might be my baby  
She might be mine  tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
She might be mine tonight
