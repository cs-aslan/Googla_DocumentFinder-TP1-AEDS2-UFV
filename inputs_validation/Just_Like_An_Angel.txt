City lights spinning in my head  
Here comes the night and go to bed  
Im sitting here in that night cafe  
My love wont go away  
Neverending dreams of you  
Lonely hours passing through  
Still missing you  
Where will you go tonight  
  
Just like an angel you are  
Hotline to heaven youre my star  
Just like an angel in the night  
Ice in the fire melt in the light  
  
Just like an angel  
Waiting for you  
Let me down easy  
Like angels do  
Youre my angel  
Oh call on me  
Give me high high energy  
  
I cross the streets to a telephone  
Shadows dancing  still on my own  
Im sitting here in that night cafe  
My love wont go away  
Cafe is empty the night goes by  
A million stars shine in the sky  
Still missing you where will you go tonight
