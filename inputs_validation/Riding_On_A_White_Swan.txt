Secret message for a rendezvous  
Distant fire its hurting you  
Its so sad  
Good love gos bad  
Tears of love will make me sad  
Frozen teardrops  
Running with the night  
Sorry doesnt always make it right  
Tears of love tears in my heart  
Why did love just break apart break apart  
  
Im riding on a white swan  
I need your love tonight  
Im riding through a hard storm  
Dont treat me like a child  
  
Im riding on a white swan  
Ive got just what you need  
Im riding on a white swan  
Youve got the best of me  
  
On the wings of a nightingale  
Playing games your love for sale  
Then my girl belongs to yesterday  
No return dont lose your way  
Its more than just the two of us  
Heart is open come on trust  
Love I gave for your mystic smile  
Should I go   
Or stay awhile stay awhile  
  
Im riding on a white swan
