I always knew that Id like this place  
You dont have to look too far to find a friendly face  
I feel alive when Im walkin on this street  
I feel the heart of the city poundin underneath my feet  
  
Chorus  
Yeah let the world keep spinnin round n round  
This is where it all goes down down down  
Thats why I love this town  
Thats why I keep comin round  
  
Say hey Say hey say yeah Say yeah  
You make me feel at home some how right now  
Thats why I love this town  
  
Ive got some good friends here I might have broke a heart or two  
Its gettin loud over there boys must have had a few  
And hey the cop on the corner he knows everybodys name  
And a kid with a train singin for some spare loose change  
  
Chorus  
  
Say hey Say hey say yeah Say yeah  
You make me feel at home some how right now  
Thats why I love this town  
  
Theres shoutin from the rooftops  
Dancin on the bars  
Hangin out the window  
Drivin in their famous cars  
You want it You got it  
You ready Im on it  
Come on now here we go again  
  
Thats why I love this town  
Thats why I love this town  
  
No matter where youre from tonight youre from right here  
This is where it all goes down down down  
Thats why I love this town  
  
Say hey Say hey say yeah Say yeah  
I love this town  
Say hey Say hey say yeah Say yeah  
I love this town  
Say hey Say hey say yeah Say yeah  
I love this town  
Say hey Say hey say yeah Say yeah  
I love this town
