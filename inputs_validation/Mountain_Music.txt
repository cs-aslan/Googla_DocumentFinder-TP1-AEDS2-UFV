You see that mountain over there  
yea one of these days  
Im going to climb that mountain  
  
Oh play me some mountain music  
Like Grandma and Grandpa used to play  
Then Ill float on down the river to the Cajun hideaway  
  
Drift away like Tom Sawyer  
Ride a raft with old Huck Finn  
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle  
Lay streaming again  
  
Oh play me some mountain music  
Like Grandma and Grandpa used to play  
Then Ill float on down the river to the Cajun hideaway  
  
Swim across the river  
Just to prove that Im a man  
Spend the day bein lazy  
Just bein natures friend  
Climb a long tall hickery  
Bending over skinn cats  
Playing baseball with shired rocks  
Using sawmill slats for bats  
  
Play some back home come on music  
That comes from the heart  
Play somethin with lots of feeling  
Cause thats where music has to start  
  
Oh play me some mountain music  
Like Grandma and Grandpa used to play  
Then Ill float on down the river to the Cajun hideaway  
  
Hey hey  
  
Oh play me mountain music  
Oh play me mountain music  
Oh play me mountain music  
Oh play
