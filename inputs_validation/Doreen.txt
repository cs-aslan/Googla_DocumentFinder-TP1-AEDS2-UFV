When I first met Doreen  
She was barely seventeen  
She was drinking whiskey sours in the bar  
The way she tossed em back  
I wouldve had a heart attack  
But as it is I let her drive my car  
We galloped through the boroughs  
Like a pair of horny thoroughbreds  
Until I said Stop the car Doreen  
Well you can roll your eyes and nod  
But I swear that I saw God in the moonlight  
On a side street in the wreckage we call Queens  
Doreen Doreen last night I had an awful dream  
You were laying in the arms of a man Id never seen  
Come clean Doreen come clean Doreen  
Well Im pulling into Cleveland  
In a sevenseater tour van  
Theres eight of us so Im sleeping on the floor  
The guy that plays the banjo  
Keeps on handing me the old crow  
Which multiplies my sorrow I cant take it anymore  
Doreen Doreen last night I had an awful dream  
You were laying in the arms of a man Id never seen  
Come clean Doreen come clean Doreen  
Now Im begging and Im pleading  
Well pull over guys Im bleeding  
Theres a fina off the highway with a phone  
Im calling you Doreen  
But it rings and rings and rings  
Where is it that you are if you arent in our bed at home  
Doreen Doreen last night I had an awful dream  
You were laying in the arms of a man Id never seen  
Come clean Doreen come clean Doreen
