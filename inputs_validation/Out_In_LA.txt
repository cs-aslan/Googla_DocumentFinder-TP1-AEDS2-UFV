Were all a bunch of brothers livin in a cool way  
Along with six million others in this place called LA  
  
LA is the place sets my mind ablaze  
For me its a race through a cotton pickin maze  
  
The town makes me jump its got a bunch of bad chicks  
Well sure its got some chumps but I still get my kicks  
My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick  
Like a come on a thumb  
Poppin hump hump hump  
Pop out  
The action never stops Im as wild as can be  
cause Im shooting for the top and my best friend is Flea  
Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls to pop  
But he never met the Tree so he never bebopped out hop  
Antwan the Swan from the pretty fish pond  
Was a bad mother jumper you could tell he was strong  
He war a cold paisley jacket and a hellified hat  
And between his legs was a sweat young lass  
He threw a hundred women up against the wall  
And he swore to fear that hed love em all  
By the time he got to ninety nine he had to stop  
Because thats when he thought that he heard a Fop  
Last night and the night before I heard a  
Fop outside then I came in doors  
Rock out  
Now that I told you a little something about the Flea  
A little something about the Tree a little something about me  
I cant leave you hangin but my man Shermzy he swings the yang he bangs the
yang  
And now its time to hear him do his Thing you better be burning Sherman  
Were all a bunch of brothers livin in a cool way  
Along with six million others in this place called LA  
Step out
