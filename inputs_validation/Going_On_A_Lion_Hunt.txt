Goin on a lion hunt  
Goin to catch a big one  
Im not afraid  
Look whats up ahead  
  
Mud  
Cant go over it  
Cant go under it  
Cant go around it  
Gotta go through it Make sloshing sounds and move hands as if slogging  
  
Goin on a lion hunt  
Goin to catch a big one  
Im not afraid  
Look whats up ahead  
  
Sticks  
Cant go over it  
Cant go under it  
Cant go around it  
Gotta go through it Snap fingers  
  
Goin on a lion hunt

Look whats up ahead  
  
Trees  
Cant go over it  
Cant go under it  
Cant go around it  
Gotta go through it Make gestures climbing up and down

Cave  
Cant go over it  
Cant go under it  
Cant go around it  
Gotta go through it act like you are feeling your way in a dark cave  
  
Feel yourself along the wall  
Oh oh Whats this  
Something funny  
With a long soft thing on its end  
With two sharp things  
Two big gleaming sharp things  
A lion  
Run for your life  
  
Run out of the cave  
Crawl through the grass  
Swim across the river  
Run through the gate  
Run around the trees  
Jump over the sticks  
Slosh through the mud  
Run into the house  
Close the door  
Run up the front stairs  
Crawl under moms bed
