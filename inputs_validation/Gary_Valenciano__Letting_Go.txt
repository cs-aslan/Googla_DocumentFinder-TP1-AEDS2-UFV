I used to feel the emptiness inside me  
I was not supposed to feel that way  
I had everything I needed  
But nothing ever made me  
What I longed to be  
The wealth the name  
The lights the fame  
Were everything to me  
And then one night  
Out of the blue  
I heard His name Jesus  
And so I took that step of faith  
And walked into His domain  
I believe thats what He wants  
Every heart to do  
When hard may seem the task  
One step is all He asks of you  
  
Letting go to know the truth  
Is not so hard to do  
Its the heart thats got the will  
To open up for Him to fill  
And trusting and believing Him  
Is all weve got to do  
Its just the heart thats got to move  
For Him to show His love thats been there  
Even when we never cared  
Take hold of His hand  
Let go and youll understand  
  
Why be afraid  
For God knows what youre feeling  
But even He cant do a thing  
If He sees the hearts not willing  
And so we ask whats going on  
We want whats right and still do wrong  
When hard may seem the task  
One step is all He asks of you  
  
I guess by now youd realize  
You cant be on your own  
And all your cares  
And all your burdens  
Should be cast upon His throne  
Letting go just let go letting go  
Let go and youll understand  
Just let go and youll understand
