Im walking away from you  
Dont want to be abused  
Doberman eyes  
Eagle claws  
And your snake body says it all  
You know your biggest problem  
Is the way you comb your hair  
And you see that its too late now  
Everybodys putting you down  
  
You cant say anything nice  
Not willing to sacrifice  
Oh you cant say anything nice  
You cant say anything nice  
Not willing to sacrifice  
Oh you cant say anything nice  
  
Absent minded like a zombie  
I cant control myself with you  
A give give give a take take take  
Babe Im through through with you  
You know your biggest problem  
Is the way you comb your hair  
And you see that its too late now  
Everybody thinks youre a clown  
  
You cant say anything nice  
Not willing to sacrifice  
Oh you cant say anything nice  
You cant say anything nice  
Not willing to sacrifice  
Oh you cant say anything nice  
  
Im walking away from you  
Dont want to be abused  
Doberman eyes  
Eagle claws  
And your snake body says it all  
You know your biggest problem  
Is the way you comb your hair  
And you see that its too late now  
Everybodys putting you down  
  
You cant say anything nice  
Not willing to sacrifice  
Oh you cant say anything nice  
You cant say anything nice  
Not willing to sacrifice  
Oh you cant say anything nice
