Oh  
I aint going down  
I aint going down  
Oh honey to the well no more  
Oh  
And I aint got nothing  
Oh and I cant stand nothing  
Oh  
I aint going down  
I aint going down  
Oh sweet mama to the well no more  
Oh  
You said you was a true believer  
Im the true believer  
Im a true believer  
Oh  
I aint going down  
I aint going down  
Oh mama to the well no more  
Oh
