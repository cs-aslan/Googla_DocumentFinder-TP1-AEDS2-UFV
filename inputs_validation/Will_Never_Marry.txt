Im writing this to say  
In a gentle way  
Thank you but no  
I will live my life as I  
Will undoubtedly die alone  
  
Im writing this to say  
In a gentle way  
Thank you  
I will live my life as I oh  
For whether you stay  
Or stray  
An inbuilt guilt catches up with you  
  
And as it comes around to your place  
At five am wakes you up  
And it laughs in your face  
  
Dont speak  
Sing
