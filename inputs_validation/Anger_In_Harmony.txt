No smoke without fire  
When will you ever learn  
Thats what you said to me  
Bigger the head that turns  
I say maybe hes happy  
So quick to fire never a liar in honesty  
Its hinged on a stranger thing  
Than friends or enemies  
From where comes the song I sing  
Anger in harmony  
Could he be in love again  
You know that shes got the touch  
The thing is were just good friends  
Smoke without fire dont mean too much  
Your trigger fingers itching on your loaded tongue  
But its hinged on a stranger thing  
Than friends or enemies  
From where comes the song I sing  
Anger in harmony
