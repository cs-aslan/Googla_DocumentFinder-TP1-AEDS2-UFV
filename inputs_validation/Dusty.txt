I think its turning back around  
And I think I like it  
I think its turning back around  
Though I dont know why it is  
I think its turning back on me  
Im down on the upside  
I think its turning back on me  
Now Im the good ride  
  
And nothings gonna put me out  
Its backing down and under  
Im down on the upside now  
Its turning back around  
Turning back around  
  
I think its coming on the wind  
Just like you said it  
I think its coming on the wind  
And Im gonna let it  
  
I think its turning back on me  
Everythings easy  
I think its turning back on me  
Everythings real to me
