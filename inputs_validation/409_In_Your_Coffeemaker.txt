I sit in the state of a daydream  
With all of your words flying over my head  
Even more time gets wasted  
In a daze  
  
It should seem obvious to you  
Your screams and cries are never going to work  
And all of your time gets wasted  
In my daze  
  
Chorus  
And Im looking back now  
At where I have gone wrong  
And why I could not seem to get along  
My interests are longing  
To break from these chains  
These chains that control  
My futures aim  
  
I sit in the state of a daydream  
With all of your words flying over my head  
Even more time gets wasted  
In a daze  
  
Maybe Im just too damn lazy  
Or maybe I was just brainwashed to think that way  
And all of your time gets wasted  
In my daze  
  
Chorus  
  
Im looking  
Back now at  
Where I have  
Have gone wrong  
And why I  
Could not seem  
Could not seem  
To get along  
  
Chorus
