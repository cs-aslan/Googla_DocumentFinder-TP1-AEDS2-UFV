You can follow the road to the mountain  
Or the track leading down to the beach  
You can go where your life go left or go right  
Its you in the drivers seat  
  
But if the rain starts swamping your windscreen  
And the lights dont piss through the night  
And the trucks coming at you just going to splash you  
The highways blinding bright  
  
Youre going out of your brain out of your mind  
Youre so deranged youre going blind  
  
Youre driving too fast  
You went straight past the curve and you never go back  
Driving too fast  
The road was a blur and it all turned to black  
Driving too fast  
Hang on to the wheel I think youre going to crash  
  
You can see the freeway divided  
Its a pity you cant take em both  
One leads to the valley or down some blind alley  
The other runs down to the coast  
  
Too many roads lead to nowhere  
But how they twist and they turn  
And a dead end and a dusty old strip mall  
Where your tires are all shredded and burned  
  
Youre going out of your brain out of your mind  
Going insane youre going blind yeah  
  
Youre driving too fast  
You slip through the curve and your slam through the flat  
Driving too fast  
Now you never go back  
  
Driving too fast  
Yeah and its all time to pass yeah  
Youre driving too fast  
Hang on for your life I think youre going to crash  
  
Youre going out of your brain out of your mind  
Youre so deranged youre going blind  
  
Youre driving too fast  
You slip pass the time never go back  
Driving too fast  
You spin through the curve and you burn off the track  
  
Driving too fast  
Youre running out of gas  
Driving too fast  
Hang on to the wheel I think were going to crash  
  
Yeah  
Driving too fast yeah
