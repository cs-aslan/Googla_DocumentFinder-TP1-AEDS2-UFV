You ask me what I want  
You ask me what I need  
Its nothing you can buy  
My hearts not ruled by greed  
I dont love a diamond  
Diamonds you see through  
I want you to hold me  
I want you to be true  
  
Give me the gift of love  
Look me in the eyes  
Say Im the one youre dreamin of  
Thatd be the best surprise  
Give me the gift of your sweet love  
In the light of the day  
In the dark of night  
  
Like the colors of the sun  
The feelings in your heart  
Its all I want from you  
And when the sky is dark  
Ill have you beside me  
Who could ask for more  
Ill just wear a smile  
When you walk in the door  
  
Give me the gift of love  
Look me in the eyes  
Say Im the one youre dreamin of  
Thatd be the best surprise  
Give me the gift of your sweet love  
In the light of the day  
In the dark of night  
  
Give me the gift of love  
Look me in the eyes  
Say Im the one youre dreamin of  
Thatd be the best surprise  
Give me the gift of your sweet love  
In the light of the day  
In the dark of night  
  
Give me the gift of love  
Look me in the eyes  
Say Im the one  
Thatd be the best surprise  
Give me the gift of your sweet love  
In the light of the day  
In the dark of night  
Always Oooooh
