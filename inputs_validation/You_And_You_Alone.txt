If we have to wait forever thats alright  
If you say Lets run away well leave tonight  
Id do anything you ever asked me to  
Girl the reason my hearts beating is for you and you alone  
  
Theres a price to pay for every choice you make  
Well have our day no matter what it takes  
Ill be there for you whatever we go through  
Girl the reason lifes worth living is for you and you alone  
  
Oh you and you alone are with me from now on  
Even if I never see your face again  
The love that you have shown is unlike anything Ive known  
We both know its just a matter of when  
  
I wish that we could just turn back the hands of time  
And find a way to have your world fit into mine  
Ill keep dreaming that someday it all comes true  
Girl the reason my hearts breaking is for you and you alone  
  
Oh you and you alone are with me from now on  
Even if I never see your face again  
The love that you have shown is unlike anything Ive known  
We both know its just a matter of when
