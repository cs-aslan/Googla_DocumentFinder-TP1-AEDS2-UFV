It was 1989 my thoughts were short my hair was long  
Caught somewhere between a boy and man  
She was seventeen and she was far from inbetween  
It was summertime in Northern Michigan  
Ahh Ahh Ahh  
Ahh Ahh Ahh  
  
Splashing through the sand bar  
Talking by the campfire  
Its the simple things in life like when and where  
We didnt have no internet  
But man I never will forget  
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair  
  
Chorus  
And we were trying different things  
We were smoking funny things  
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song  
Sipping whiskey out the bottle not thinking bout tomorrow  
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long  
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long  
  
Catching Walleye from the dock  
Watching the waves roll off the rocks  
Shell forever hold a spot inside my soul  
Wed blister in the sun  
We couldnt wait for night to come  
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll  
  
While we were trying different things  
And we were smoking funny things  
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song  
Sipping whiskey out the bottle not thinking bout tomorrow  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  
  
Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change  
Or how we thought those days would never end  
Sometimes Ill hear that song and Ill start to sing along  
And think man Id love to see that girl again  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
