The dawn has come  
And the wine will run  
And the song must be sung  
And the flowers are melting  
In the sun  
  
I feel I want to be up on the roof  
I feel I gotta get up on the roof  
Up up on the roof  
Up up on the roof  
  
Oh the dawn has come  
And the song must be sung  
And the flowers are melting  
What kind of language is this  
  
What kind of language is this  
I cant hear a word youre saying  
Tell me what are you singing  
In the sun  
  
All of the birds are laughing  
All of the birds are laughing  
Come on lets all join in  
Come on lets all join in  
  
I want to be up on the roof  
Ive gotta be up on the roof  
Up up high on the roof  
Up up on the roof  
In the sun
