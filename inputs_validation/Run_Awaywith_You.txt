I wake up in the morning while youre still asleep  
I wipe away another tear from your cheek  
This is not the first time youve been crying in your sleep  
I know that youre affected by what people say  
But I can promise you there will come a day  
As long as were together our love will find a way  
  
Chorus  
I would love to run away with you  
I wish that I could run away with you  
Without a trace a secret place  
Where nothing stands in our way  
I would love to run away with you  
I wish that I could run away with you  
To someplace far shinning star  
The two of us all alone  
  
We were born and raised in two different worlds  
Separated by our faith and belief  
Our love was not accepted but we were meant to be  
And even if they tried to tear our love apart  
You and I will always share the same heart  
Theres nothing they can do cause this is our destiny  
Ill give up my life just to be with you  
Ill take you where ever you want me to  
  
Chorus  
  
You and I love belongs to you  
You and I love belongs to us  
Ill give up my life if you want me to  
Ill take you where ever you want to go  
Where you want to go  
  
Chorus x 2
