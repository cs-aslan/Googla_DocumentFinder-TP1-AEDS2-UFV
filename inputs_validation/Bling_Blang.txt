You get a hammer and Ill get a nail  
And you catch a bird and Ill catch a snail  
You bring a board and Ill bring a saw  
And well build a house for the babyo  
CHORUS  
Bling Blang hammer with my hammer  
Zingo Zango cutting with my saw  
Bling Blang hammer with my hammer  
Zingo Zango cutting with my saw  
Ill grab some mud and you grab some clay  
So when it rains it wont wash away  
Well build a house thatll be so strong  
The winds will sing my baby a song  
CHORUS  
Run bring rocks and Ill bring bricks  
A nice pretty house well build and fix  
Well jump inside when the cold wind blows  
And kiss our little babyo  
CHORUS  
You bring a ladder and Ill get a box  
Build our house of bricks and blocks  
When the snowbird flies and the honeybee comes  
Well feed our baby on honey in the comb  
CHORUS
