Some people  
Dont worry  
bout nothing  
Dont know whats going on  
Im not one  
Who cant say theyre sorry  
I just care whats going on  
Theres more important things  
Than making sure your watch looks just right  
And second hand opinions  
Dont make you look any smarter  
Dont you think  
Dont you think  
Dont you think that maybe  
its time  yes its time  
Time you started thinking  
Time you started thinking  
And dont just sweeten up the taste  
Brother shoots brother  
But meanwhile youre fixing up your face  
Youre not affected by the truth  
Unless its on your doorstep  
Deodorise your paradise  
No point in getting crazy  
Dont you think  
Dont you think  
Dont you think that maybe  
Its time  yes its time  
Time you started thinking bout things in the back of your head  
Someone said before you turn a blind eye  
Hear a bell ring sex sells everything  
But I dont buy it so dont try it  
Sleeping in the small world head in the sand  
Better wash your hands  make a new plan  
Theres more important things  
Than making sure your shoes just walk right  
Ignore reality theres nothing you can do about it     
The clothes you wear dont make the man  
Its just another party  
Chorus
