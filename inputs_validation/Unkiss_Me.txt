If you respect me  
Dont protect me  
You can tell me I can handle it  
Stop pretending cause were going down  
If you let go then just let go  
Its disrespectful how youve handled this  
Never ending kinda round around  
  
I lie to my heart cause I thought you felt it  
You cant light a fire if the candles melted  
No you dont have to love me  
If you dont wanna  
Dont act like I mean nothing  
But if youre gonna  
Well when youre better off  
  
Unkiss me untouch me  
Untake this heart  
And I missing  
Just one thing  
A brand new star  
  
Cant erase this cant delete this  
I dont need this I cant handle it  
I just feel it that youre over us  
If I wait here if I see you  
It wont matter whats the point of this  
Were in pieces because youre over us  
  
I lie to my heart cause I thought you felt it  
You cant light a fire if the candles melted  
No you dont have to love me  
If you dont wanna  
Dont act like I mean nothing  
But if youre gonna  
Well when youre better off  
  
Unkiss me untouch me  
Untake this heart  
And I missing  
Just one thing  
A brand new star  
Unkiss me  
Unkiss me  
  
So baby let go  
Gotta let go  
Its disrespectful how youve handled this  
Never ending kinda round around  
  
Unkiss me untouch me  
Untake this heart  
And I missing  
Just one thing  
A brand new star  
So unkiss me  
So unkiss me  
Unkiss me
