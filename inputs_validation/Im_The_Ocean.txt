Im an accident  
I was driving way too fast  
Couldnt stop though  
So I let the moment last  
Im for rollin  
Im for tossin in my sleep  
Its not guilt though  
Its not the company I keep  
  
People my age  
They dont do the things I do  
They go somehwere  
While I run away with you  
I got my friends  
And I got my children too  
I got her love  
Shes got my love too  
  
I cant hear you  
But I feel the things you say  
I cant see you  
But I see whats in my way  
Now Im floatin  
Cause Im not tied to the ground  
Words Ive spoken  
Seem to leave a hollow sound  
  
On the long plain  
See the rider in the night  
See the chieftain  
See the braves in cool moonlight  
Who will love them  
When they take another life  
Who will hold them  
When they tremble for the knife  
  
Voicemail numbers  
On an old computer screen  
Rows of lovers  
Parked forever in a dream  
Screaming sirens  
Echoing across the bay  
To the old boats  
From the city far away  
  
Homeless heroes  
Walk the streets of their hometown  
Rows of zeros  
On a field thats turning brown  
They play baseball  
They play football under lights  
They play card games  
And we watch them every night  
  
Need distraction  
Need romance and candlelight  
Need random violence  
Need entertainment tonight  
Need the evidence  
Want the testimony of  
Expert witnesses  
On the brutal crimes of love  
  
I was too tired  
To see the news when I got home  
Pulled the curtain  
Fell into bed alone  
Started dreaming  
Saw the rider once again  
In the doorway  
Where she stood and watched for him  
Watched for him  
  
Im not present  
Im a drug that makes you dream  
Im an aerostar  
Im a cutlass supreme  
In the wrong lane  
Trying to turn against the flow  
Im the ocean  
Im the giant undertow  
  
Im the ocean  
Im the ocean  
Im the giant undertow  
Im the ocean  
Im the giant undertow  
Im the ocean  
Im the ocean  
Im the ocean  
Im the ocean  
Im the ocean  
Im the ocean
