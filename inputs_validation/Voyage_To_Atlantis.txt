Can I go on my way without you  
Whoahow can I know  
If I go on my way without you  
Whoawhere would I go  
  
Set sail with me  
Misty lady set my spirit free  
New love to find  
And though I leave another behind  
  
Ill always Come back to you  
Ill always Come back to you  
Ill always Come back to you  
Ill always Come back to you  
  
Shes my lady now and ever  
Whoahow can I know  
Can we go all the way together  
Whoalet it be so  
  
So well say our last goodbye  
And well make it this time  
Heyhoset sail with me  
To a paradise out beyond the sea  
  
Atlantis Is back to you  
Ill always Come back to you  
Atlantis Is back to you  
Ill always Come back to you  
  
Atlantis Is back to you  
Ill always Come back to you  
Atlantis Is back to you  
Ill always Come back to you  
  
Atlantis Is back to you  
Ill always Come back to you  
Ill always Come back to you  
Ill always Come back to you
