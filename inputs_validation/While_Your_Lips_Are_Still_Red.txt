Sweet little words made for silence not talk  
Young heart for love not heartache  
Dark hair for catching the wind  
Not to veil the sight of a cold world  
  
Kiss while your lips are still red  
While hes still silent  
Rest while bosom is still untouched unveiled  
Hold another hand while the hands still without a tool  
Drown into eyes while theyre still blind  
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn  
  
First day of love never comes back  
A passionate hours never a wasted one  
The violin the poets hand  
Every thawing heart plays your theme with care  
  
Kiss while your lips are still red  
While hes still silent  
Rest while bosom is still untouched unveiled  
Hold another hand while the hands still without a tool  
Drown into eyes while theyre still blind  
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn  
  
Kiss while your lips are still red  
While hes still silent  
Rest while bosom is still untouched unveiled  
Hold another hand while the hands still without a tool  
Drown into eyes while theyre still blind  
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn  
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn
