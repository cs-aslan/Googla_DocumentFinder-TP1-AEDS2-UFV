I got money  
Everything that I ever wanted  
Never thought of what I might need need need  
Aint it funny how I spend my whole life running  
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing  
  
Feels like Im four years old all over again  
Because Im just running fast and should be walking  
Saying when I grow up you gon see  
Im gon be comfortable and happy  
  
I guess I was faking cause look at all the money Im making  
Still nothing can compare to the thought of love  
But its taking too much time to see that Im wasting  
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing  
  
It feels like Im four years old all over again  
Cause I just keep running fast and should be walking  
Saying when I grow up you gon see  
Im gon be comfortable and happy  
  
Im so alone I feel so alone so alone in this world  
Got everything I want  
  
It feels like Im four years old all over again  
Cause I just keep running fast and should be walking  
Saying when I grow up you gon see  
Im gon be comfortable and happy  
  
Whoah
