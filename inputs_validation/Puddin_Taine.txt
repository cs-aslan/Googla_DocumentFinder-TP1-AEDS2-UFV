Pass the pen there billy bob Ill write us up a song  
Or perhaps Ill pen a sonnet if the melody sits all wrong  
Hand me down a crayon and Ill draw a mighty oak  
cause of all my brother masons Im the quickest with a joke  
  
Catch me in the right light youll see my shapes shaped to please  
And if I shank my trousers down Im hung just above the knees  
  
You may have difficulty catchin breath when you hear my weighty name  
Im the one that told you told you so they calls me puddin taine  
  
Now step on up to dance the dance and touch the hand that heals  
Like the tallest hog on wall street Im a wheelin all the deals  
  
Theyll carve my face in marble theyll etch my name in stone  
Theyll paint my noble portrait and historify my home  
  
You may have difficulty catchin breath when you hear my weighty name  
Im the one that told you told you so they calls me puddin taine
