Ill find the places where you hide  
Ill be the dawn on your worst night  
The only thing left in your life  
Yeah I would kill for you thats right  
  
If thats what you wanted  
If thats what you wanted  
If thats what you wanted  
If thats what you wanted  
  
Ill put your poison in my veins  
They say the best love is insane yeah  
Ill light your fire till my last day  
Ill let your fields burn around me around me  
  
If thats what you wanted  
If thats what you wanted  
If thats what you wanted  
If thats what you wanted  
  
Ill run now cause this time  
Oh my love is true  
Tell me something I wouldnt do  
  
If thats what you wanted  
If thats what you wanted  
If thats what you wanted  
If thats what you wanted  
  
If thats what you wanted  
If thats what you wanted  
If thats what you wanted  
If thats what you wanted
