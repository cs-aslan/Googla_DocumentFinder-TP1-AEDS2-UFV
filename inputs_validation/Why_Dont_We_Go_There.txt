I know you want know you wanna take it slow  
Think about all the places we could go  
If you give in tonight  
Just let me set you free  
Well touch the other side just give me the key  
  
Cause we got all night  
And were going nowhere  
Why dont you stay  
Why dont we go there  
Lets take a ride  
Out in the cold air  
I know the way why dont you go there with me  
  
Say the word say the word but dont say no  
Skydive you and I with just these clothes  
The secrets safe with me  
Theres no right time or place  
Cause anyone can see well do it anyway  
  
Cause we got all night  
Were going nowhere  
Why dont you stay  
Why dont we go there  
Lets take a ride  
Out in the cold air  
I know the way why dont you go there with me  
  
Hey I dont want you to be the one that got away  
I wanna get addicted to you yeah  
Youre rushing through my mind I wanna feel the high  
I wanna be addicted dont say no  
Just let go  
  
Cause we got all night  
And were going nowhere  
Why dont you stay  
Why dont we go there  
Lets take a ride  
Out in the cold air  
I know the way why dont you go there with me  
  
With me with me  
Why dont you go there with me
