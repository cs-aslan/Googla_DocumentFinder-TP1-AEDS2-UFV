Eddie Graces Buick got four bullet holes in the side  
Charlie Delisle sittin at the top of an avocado tree  
Mrs Stormll stab you with a steak knife if you step on her lawn  
I got a half pack of Lucky Strikes man come along with me  
Lets fill our pockets with macadamia nuts then go over to Bobby Goodmansons
and jump off the roof Hilda plays strip poker and her mamas across the
street  
Joey Navinski says she put her tongue in his mouth  
Dicky Faulkners got a switchblade and some gooseneck risers that eucalyptus is
a hunchback  
Theres a wind up from the south  
Let me tie you up with kite string and Ill show you the scabs on my knee  
Watch out for the broken glass put your shoes and socks on and come along
with me  
Lets follow that fire truck  
I think your house is burnin down  
Then go down to the hobo jungle  
And kill some rattlesnakes with a trowel  
Well break all the windows in the old Anderson place  
And steal a bunch of boysenberrys  
And smear em on our face  
Ill get a dollar from my mamas purse  
And buy that skull and crossbones ring  
And you can wear it around your neck  
On an old piece of string  
  
Then well spit on Ronnie Arnold  
And flip him the bird  
And slash the tires on the school bus  
Now dont say a word  
Ill take a rusty nail  
And scratch your initials on my arm  
And Ill show you how to sneak up  
On the roof of the drugstore  
  
Take the spokes from your wheelchair  
And a magpies wings  
And tie em to your shoulders and your feet  
Ill steal a hacksaw from my dad  
And cut the braces off your legs  
And well bury them tonight in the cornfield  
  
Put a church key in your pocket  
Well hop that freight train in the hall  
And well slide all the way down the drain  
To New Orleans in the fall
