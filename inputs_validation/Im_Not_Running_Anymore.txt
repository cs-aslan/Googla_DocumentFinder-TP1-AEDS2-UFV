Holly told me You better give me a child  
I said Holly theres no way  
We dont even like each other all that much  
We couldnt make it one more day  
She said You better look out buster  
The next time you see me youre gonna pay  
I said Holly Im not running anymore  
But Im on my way  
  
Im on my way  
Im on my way  
Im on my way  
But Im not running anymore  
  
Well I got two circus clowns here who like to fight  
They got one black eye and a bloody nose  
They are the hoodlums of my third wife  
Whatever I say they will oppose  
I try to teach those clowns something  
Like how to make it day to day  
I say Hey you kids Im not running anymore  
But Im on my way  
  
Im on my way  
Im on my way  
Im on my way  
And Im not running anymore  
  
Well I look in the mirror  what the hell happened to me  
Whatever I had has gone away  
Im not the young kid that I used to be  
So I push the hair back out of my face  
Thats OK I knew this would happen  
But I was hopin not today  
Hey Baby Im not running anymore  
But Im on my way  
  
Im on my way  
Im on my way  
Im on my way  
And Im not running anymore  
  
Im on my way  
Im on my way  
Im on my way  
And Im not running anymore  
  
For sure
