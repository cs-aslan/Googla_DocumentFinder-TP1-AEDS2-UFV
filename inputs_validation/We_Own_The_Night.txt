Is it alright if Im with you for the night  
Hope you dont mind if you stay by my side  
We can drive in your car somewhere into the dark  
Pull over and watch the stars  
We can dance we can sing do whatever you think  
As long as Im with you  
  
Chorus  
When we are together its the time of our lives  
We can do whatever be whoever wed like  
Spend the weekend dancing cause when we sleep when we die  
Dont have to worry about nothing  
We own the night ahahoh  
We own the night  
We own the night  
We own the night  
  
Its all a blur  
Its getting late but I dont care  
I dont know where well end up  
And thats okay  
  
We can drive in your car somewhere into the dark  
Pull over and watch the stars  
We can dance we can sing do whatever you think  
As long as Im with you  
  
Chorus  
  
Nothing lasts forever  
Lets live it up when were together  
Nothing lasts forever  
So lets live it up just do whatever  
  
Chorus  
  
When we are together its the time of our lives  
We can do whatever be whoever wed like  
Spend the weekend dancing cause when we sleep when we die  
Dont have to worry about nothing  
We own the night ahahoh  
  
Just do what you like  
Ahahoh We own the night  
Do whatever you like  
Ahahoh We own the night  
Just do what you like  
Ahahoh We own the night  
Do whatever you like
