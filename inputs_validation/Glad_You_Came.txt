The sun goes down  
The stars come out  
And all that counts  
Is here and now  
My universe will never be the same  
Im glad you came  
  
You cast a spell on me spell on me  
You hit me like the sky fell on me fell on me  
And I decided you look well on me well on me  
So lets go somewhere noone else can see you and me  
  
Turn the lights out now  
Now Ill take you by the hand  
Hand you another drink  
Drink it if you can  
Can you spend a little time  
Time is slipping away  
Away from us so stay  
Stay with me I can make  
Make you glad you came  
  
The sun goes down  
The stars come out  
And all that counts  
Is here and now  
My universe will never be the same  
Im glad you came  
Im glad you came

My universe will never be the same  
Im glad you came
