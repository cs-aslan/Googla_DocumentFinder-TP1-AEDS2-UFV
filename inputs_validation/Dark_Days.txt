Ive seen the way that the sun sets in your face  
Our love is too big for us to break  
Youve got me wishing for the stars in outer space  
Im holding onto this life and love and for  
The possibility you and me let me be  
I need to find a way  
To put this struggle behind us  
Cant spend my life in shame  
Making light of these dark days  
Ive seen the way that the rain spits in your face  
Just falling upon your lips to taste  
If I could give to you the stars in outer space  
Im holding onto this life and love and for  
The possibility you and me let me be  
I need to find a way  
To put this struggle behind us  
Cant spend my life in shame  
Making light of these dark days  
Another time and place  
To put this struggle behind us  
Cant spend my life in shame  
Making light of these dark days  
So far away so far away  
So far away  
Look into your heart  
And let time heal this pain  
Were not so far away  
Were not so far away  
The possibility you and me let me be  
I need to find a way  
To put this struggle behind us  
Cant spend my life in shame  
Making light of these dark days  
Another time and place  
To put this struggle behind us  
Cant spend my life in shame  
Making light of these dark light of these dark  
Light of these dark days  
All as one you made me come home  
And all this Im one to never follow  
In all this Im one who will ever love you  
All this Im done all this Im done
