Verse  
I snook out the front door into winter and the world outside  
I stepped out the door to New York City my hair was barely dry  
I could not remember where I was going so I went back inside  
Nothin happened in the elevator nothing happening on the stairs  
Nothing ever happenin when I am sleeping and I cannot stay there  
Howd you find a party when youre in your room  
Howd you find the action man The action is everywhere  
And decide to climb outside your bedroom window paint a picture on a clock  
Oh if you decide that you cant hide inside your mind  
Provide the slide to get you out  
Feels just like youre fallin and youre goin down  
And everybody luvs ya when you hit the ground  
I say a prayer I say a prayer I say a prayer to Pocahontas  
I pray to John Appleseed  
Oh I cigarette the winter air then I finna stare my way down 7th street  
Some chick yells Jesus luvs me more than I know but less than I need  
I play down the valley to the And then I step off into the air  
Point my sunglasses east towards Jerusalem and then follow all the pharoahs
there  
Theyre buildin pyramids in the Western Square  
Drivin in circles round the circus til the circles in the air  
My love says come on Adam tell me what the hell is wrong with you  
She says come on Adam tell me what the hell am I supposed to do  
She says I could love you I could leave you  
But I cant live what you put me through  
I call the winter Maria cuz I do not know her face  
I call the endless sky Emilia cuz she stays with me from place to place  
I call the sun my love Emanuel she cradle me in her embrace  
I left nothin happening in the kitchen nothing happening on the floor  
Nothin happenin in my bed she dont sleep there no more  
Hard to find the bottom when youre in the air  
Hey man howd you find the circus we have the circus is everywhere
