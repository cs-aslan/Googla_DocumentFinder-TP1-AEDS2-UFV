Flattop guitar  
Down around the campfire  
You can smell that hickory burnin  
Catfish fryin  
Onions got us cryin  
Hushpuppies theyre a turnin  
Friends and kin comin down the hill  
  
Trippin in the ole starlight  
Cookin and kickin do a little pickin  
Party tonight  
  
Chorus  
Come on down to the moonlight longe  
Where the ceilin is so blue  
Where there aint no door and our dance floor  
Is covered with mountain dew  
Where there aint no walls and the waterfall  
Is the only sound around  
Yeah were havin us a party down in the holler  
We call it the moonlight lounge  
  
Me and my lady  
Rode in on sadie  
A fourteen hand chestnut mare  
A midnight hoot owl  
Hes screechin so loud  
Kind of puts a chill in the summer air  
The bushes are wigglin somebodys gigglin  
Buck couldnt wait to get a kiss  
Jimmys got the four wheel hooked to the wagon  
A hay ride you dont want to miss  
  
Repeat chorus  
Wont you repeat chorus again  
Tag  
Yeah were havin us a party everybody holler  
We call it the moonlight lounge
