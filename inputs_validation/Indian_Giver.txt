I can still remember  
It wasnt long ago  
Things you used to tell me  
You said I had to know  
Told me that you loved me  
And that you always would  
Then I said I loved you  
You said that that was good  
Girl you made a promise said youd never want me to go  
Oh no  
  
Indian giver Indian giver  
You took your love away from me  
Indian giver Indian giver  
Took back the love you gave to me  
  
Baby I was feeling  
The way I want to feel  
You had me believing  
The love we had was real  
Things we did together  
You said theyd never end  
Now until forever Yeah that was what you said  
Girl when I was down I knew youd always be there  
Oh yeah  
  
Indian giver Indian giver  
You took your love away from me  
Indian giver Indian giver  
Took back the love you gave to me
