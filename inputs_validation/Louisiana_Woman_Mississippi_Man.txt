Hey Louisiana woman Mississippi man  
We get together every time we can  
The Mississippi River can keep us apart  
Theres too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart  
  
See the alligators all a waitin nearby  
Soon or later they know Im gonna try  
When she wave from the bank dont you know I know  
Its goodbye fishin line see you while ago  
With a Louisiana woman waitin on the other side  
The Mississippi River dont look so wide

We get together every time we can  
The Mississippi River can keep us apart  
Theres too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart  
  
Well I thought Id been loved but I never had  
Till I was wrapped in the arms of a Mississippi man  
When he holds me close it feels almost  
Like another hurricane just ripped the coast  
If he cant come to me Im gonna go to him  
That Mississippi River Lord Im gonna swim

Too bad alligator you swim too slow
