White lines pretty baby tattoos  
Dont know what they mean theyre special just for you  
White palms baking powder on the stove  
Cooking up a dream turning diamonds into snow  
  
I feel you pretty baby feel me  
Turn it up hot loving you is free  
I like it down like it down way low  
But you already know that  
You already know  
  
Come on down to Florida  
I got something for ya  
We could see the kilos on the keys baby oh ya  
Gourds in the summertime  
ChicaCherry Cola lime  
Prison isnt nothing to me if youll be by my s  
  
Yayo yayo yayo  
And all the dope fiends  
Yayo yayo yayo  
  
Zoom in my miles and gold hoops  
You like your little baby like you like your drinks cool  
White lines pretty daddy go skiing  
You snort it like a champ like the winner when Im in it  
  
Come on down to Florida  
I got something for ya  
We could see the kilos on the keys baby oh ya  
Gourds in the summertime  
ChicaCherry Cola lime  
Prison isnt nothing to me if youll be by my s  
  
Yayo yayo yayo  
And all the dope fiends  
Yayo yayo yayo  
  
We could get high in Miami or dance the night away  
Even when I die in Miami thats what they all say  
You believe me dont you baby  
  
Yayo yayo yayo  
And all the dope fiends  
Yayo yayo yayo  
  
Yayo yayo yayo  
And all the Floridians say  
Yayo yayo yayo  
All the Columbians say  
Yayo yayo yayo  
And all my girlfriends  
Yayo yayo yayo  
  
Thats how I do it  
Come on pretty baby  
White lines pretty baby  
Gold teeth pretty baby  
Dance the night away
