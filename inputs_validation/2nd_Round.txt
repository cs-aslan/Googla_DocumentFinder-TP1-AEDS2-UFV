Just touched down in town again  
You think about me now and then  
Been missing my lover friend  
Lets say we have a second round again  
  
Girl its been a while  
So I thought Id hit you up  
You never left my mind  
Lets pick it up where we left off  
The last time I loved you fiercely baby  
So let me feel you up  
Yeah its been a minute  
I know you miss the way we touch  
You can think about you dont want it  
You dont wanna come across too anxious  
Come see if youre ready for a second round  
  
Girl Im in your town come over  
Girl dont let me down I wont be here for long  
Ill show you a good time one that well both remember  
Girl give me your best respect unless girl  
  
Said you wouldnt but you did it oh girl  
I can tell you dont regret it cause you aint been touched like this  
Since the last time  
  
The feeling that I get every time we connect oh there it is  
Who else cares let em out but Ill be back around  
Baby you can hang around if you want to  
But I gotta be out have some VI  
When I get back be ready for a second round  
  
Girl Im in your town come over  
Girl dont let me down I wont be here for long  
Ill show you a good time one that well both remember  
Girl give me your best respect unless girl
