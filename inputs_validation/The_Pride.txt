Politician come to power take it slow  
People need what you know  
Youre a leader so you have to play along  
Show the hand right or wrong  
When youre feelin that you know the way to turn  
Either way still get burned  
Its the pride that makes you feel that you belong  
Its the pride that keeps you strong  
  
Dont you think its fascinating  
Dont you think its fascinating  
Its the pride that you feel its the pride  
When you finally break it all down its the pride  
Its the pride that you feel its the pride  
When you finally break it all down its the pride  
  
What makes you want to do the best you can  
What makes you a better man  
What makes you try again before too long  
What keeps you standing strong  
What makes you say the things you want to say  
To make it a better day  
Its the pride that makes you feel that you belong  
Its the pride that keeps you strong  
  
Dont you think its fascinating  
Dont you think its fascinating  
Its the pride that you feel its the pride  
When you finally break it all down its the pride  
Its the pride that you feel its the pride  
When you finally break it all down its the pride
