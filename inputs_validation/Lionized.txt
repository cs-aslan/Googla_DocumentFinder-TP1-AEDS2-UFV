Cold wind blowing over your private parts I know a lack youve got and it
makes a strong case for art billboard breasts they  
Dont have a face I know that fact youve got no girl could ever trace
lionized smoking just a little too violently I know that  
Fact Ive got and I know it singlemindedly stupid stoned cause and effect I
know a lack youve got and you dont even lack it  
Yet lionized lionize  
  
I cant draw but I can trace I know a lack Ive got an abundance of extra
space cold wind blowing over your private parts I  
Know a lack youve got is to make a strong case for art lionized lionize
