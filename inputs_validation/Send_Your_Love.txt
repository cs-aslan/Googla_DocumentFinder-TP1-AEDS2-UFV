Finding the world in the smallness of a grain of sand  
And holding infinities in the palm of your hand  
And Heavens realms in the seedlings of this tiny flower  
And eternities in the space of a single hour  
  
Send your love into the future  
Send your love into the distant dawn  
  
Inside your mind is a relay station  
A mission probe into the unknowing  
We send a seed to a distant future  
Then we can watch the galaxies growing  
  
This aint no time for doubting your power  
This aint no time for hiding your care  
Youre climbing down from an ivory tower  
Youve got a stake in the world we ought to share  
  
You see the stars are moving so slowly  
But still the earth is moving so fast  
Cant you see the moon is so lonely  
Shes still trapped in the pain of the past  
  
This is the time of the worlds colliding  
This is the time of kingdoms falling  
This is the time of the worlds dividing  
Time to heed your call  
  
Send your love into the future  
Send your precious love into some distant time  
And fix that wounded planet with the love of your healing  
Send your love  
Send your love  
  
Theres no religion but sex and music  
Theres no religion but sound and dancing  
Theres no religion but line and color  
Theres no religion but sacred trance  
  
Theres no religion but the endless ocean  
Theres no religion but the moon and stars  
Theres no religion but time and motion  
Theres no religion just tribal scars  
  
Throw a pebble in and watch the ocean  
See the ripples vanish in the distance  
Its just the same with all the emotions  
Its just the same in every instance  
  
Theres no religion but the joys of rhythm  
Theres no religion but the rites of Spring  
Theres no religion in the path of hate  
No prayer but the one I sing  
  
Send your love into the future  
Send your precious love into some distant time  
And fix that wounded planet with the love of your healing  
Send your love  
Send your love  
  
Theres no religion but sex and music  
Theres no religion thats right or winning  
Theres no religion in the path of hatred  
Aint no prayer but the one Im singing  
  
Send your love  
Send your love
