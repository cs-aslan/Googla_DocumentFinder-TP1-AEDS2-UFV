Voices cryin out voices cryin out  
Voices cryin out in the night hear them call  
Voices cryin out hear them call  
Its a night  
Like no other night  
Its a day  
Almost turning gray  
Its a heart  
Like a broken heart  
Its a wheel  
At the end of day  
Its the plight  
Of a boy whos scared  
Of the waves rushing out  
And the wind in the air  
Its the sight  
Of one longing to taste  
Of life  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices from some foreign shore  
Visions that seem an incredible dream  
Echoing for more  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices crying out hear them call  
Its a song  
Of a love unsung  
Its the pain  
Of just being young  
Its a cry  
Of a voice unheard  
Of a face  
Speaking silent words  
Its the hope  
That the time goes by  
Take you upon a wing  
Teach your soul to fly  
Its a wish  
That youll live your experience life  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices from some foreign shore  
Vision that seem an incredible dream  
Echoing for more  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices crying out hear them call  
Oh do you know how it feels to be free  
Walking your path of life  
Embracing destiny one day at a time  
Voices cryin outoh cant you hear them  
Voices cryin outlisten please listen to the future  
Voices cryin outmillions and millions and millions of voices  
Voices cryin outoh oh oh oh  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices from some foreign shore  
Vision that seem an incredible dream  
Echoing for more  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices crying out hear them call  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices from some foreign shore  
Vision that seem an incredible dream  
Echoing for more  
Voices cryin out  
Voices cryin out
