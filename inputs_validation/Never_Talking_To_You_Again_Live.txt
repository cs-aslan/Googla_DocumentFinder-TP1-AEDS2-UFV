There are things that Id like to say  
But Im never talking to you again  
Theres things Id like to phrase some way  
But Im never talking to you again  
  
Im never talking to you again  
Im never talking to you  
Im tired of wasting all my time  
Trying to talk to you  
  
Id put you down where you belong  
But Im never talking to you again  
Id show you everywhere youre wrong  
But Im never talking to you again
