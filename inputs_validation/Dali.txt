High in Castille  
Lives senora Dali alone  
And higher still  
She keeps her gallery  
Distance means nothing to me  
Aeeahaeeahaoo  
Aeeahaeeahaoo  
Debris everywhere  
Gazing Its amazing  
Ferry me over  
Ferry me over  
Ferry me over  
The music Dali  
Deeper here lies hidden answers and treasures for him  
Oh I prefer absence said she  
My heart grows fonder alone  
Aeeahaeeahaoo  
Aeeahaeeahaoo  
Debris everywhere  
Gazing Its amazing  
Ferry me over  
Ferry me over  
Ferry me over  
The music Dali
