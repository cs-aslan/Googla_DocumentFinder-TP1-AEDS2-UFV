See my dear Im thinking of you  
My how she has grown  
Her building blocks have all gone home  
And being there is always where  
Ill be  
Youll see  
  
Take your doll  
House dreams and make them real  
Ive seen the sun  
Ill guide your  
Inspirations along  
And dont let them stop you from being someones friend  
Dont bend  
  
I hope you  
Always keep your hand this close to mine  
And I hope you  
Never hesitate to wonder why  
Wonder why  
Wonder why  
If you need a shoulder mine is here  
And I love you  
And no one can tell you what to do  
And roses and diamonds could never take  
The place  
Of your face  
I hope you  
Never hesitate to wonder why  
Wonder why  
Wonder why
