Say goodbye to the life youve been living  
So long to the friends you hold dear  
Youre lifes been jarred and moved out of focus  
From far away will it all become clear  
  
Where is the time given to love  
Where are the nights that were missing  
Where is the joy that we knew  
Am I lost again lost again lost and confused  
  
Standing close to the work youve been painting  
Shades and lines diffuse when so near  
Standing back does it all fall together  
From far away will it all become clear  
From far far away it all becomes clear
