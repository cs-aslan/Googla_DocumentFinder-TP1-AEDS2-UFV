Ive got a hundred proof heartache and a case of the blues  
My babys gone and left me Ive lost all I can lose  
Ive got a hundred proof heartache my world keeps turning round  
This hundred proof heartaches got me down  
You waded through my tears then said goobye  
You didnt seem to care how much Id cry  
You made your home the tavern down the street  
And this old heart cries out with every beat  
Ive got a hundred proof heartache and a case of the blues  
Youre holding someone else tonight I just got the news  
You left a hundred proof heartache for a love thats second hand  
This hundred proof heartache I cant stand  
 piano  steel   
Ive got a hundred proof heartache my world keeps turnin round  
This hundred proof heartaches got me down
