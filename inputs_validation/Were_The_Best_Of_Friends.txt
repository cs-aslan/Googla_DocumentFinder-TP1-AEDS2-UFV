When youre the best of friends  
Having so much fun together  
Youre not even aware youre such a funny pair  
Youre the best of friends  
Lifes a happy game  
You could clown around forever  
Neither one of you sees your natural boundaries  
Lifes one happy game  
If only the world wouldnt get in the way  
If only people would just let you play  
They say youre both being fools  
Youre breaking all the rules  
They cant understand the magic of your wonderland  
Huhuhu  
When youre the best of friends  
Sharing all that you discover  
When that moment has past will that friendship last  
Who can say Theres a way  
Oh I hope I hope it never ends  
Cause youre the best of friends
