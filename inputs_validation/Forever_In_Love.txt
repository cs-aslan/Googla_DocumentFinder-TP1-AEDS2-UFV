Love leads to laughter  
Love leads to pain  
With you by my side  
I feel good times again  
  
Never have I felt these feelings before  
You showed me the world  
How could I ask for more  
  
And although theres confusion  
Well find a solution to keep my heart close to you  
  
And I know yes I know  
If you hold me believe me  
Ill never never ever leave  
  
And I know  
There is nothing that I would not do for you  
Forever be true  
And I know  
Although times can be hard  
We will see it through  
Im forever in love with you  
  
Show me affection  
In all different ways  
Give you my heart  
For the rest of my days  
  
With you all my troubles are left far behind  
Like heaven on earth  
When I look in your eyes  
  
And although theres confusion  
Well find a solution  
To keep my heart close to you  
  
And I know yes I know  
If you hold me believe me  
Ill never never ever leave  
  
And I know  
There is nothing that I would not do for you  
Forever be true  
And I know  
Although times can be hard  
We will see it through  
Im forever in love with you  
  
No need to cry  
Ill be right by your side  
Right by your side  
  
Lets take our time  
Love wont run dry  
If you hold me believe me  
Ill never never ever leave  
  
And I know  
There is nothing that I would not do for you  
Forever be true  
And I know  
Although times can be hard  
We will see it through  
Im forever in love  
And I know  
There is nothing that I would not do for you  
  
Forever be true  
And I know  
  
Oh I know  
Although times can be hard  
We will see it through  
Im forever in love with you
