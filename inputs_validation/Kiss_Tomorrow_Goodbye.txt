I threw a rock in the lake and it sank to the bottom  
The waves spread out but the rock got forgotten  
The ripples came back just as we feared  
Looking for the rock but the hole disappeared  
Its somewhere in the middle some ways down  
The last guy that went looking almost certainly drowned  
  
He ran out of time  
He can kiss tomorrow goodbye  
  
Yes I piss in the water and burn down the trees  
I watch as the creatures fall to their knees  
They aint got a clue as disaster looms  
Theyre too busy choking on toxic fumes  
They got no hope and theres no point running  
No matter what they do I keep on coming  
  
They ran out of time  
They can kiss tomorrow goodbye  
  
I did a bad thing  
I did a bad thing  
I did a bad thing  
I did a bad thing  
  
Well hallelujah and holy mackerel  
All we got left is a thief and a jackal  
The writing is big and its there on the wall  
Oh how the mighty empires fall  
Theres nothing to fix its much too late  
Sit down and prepare to meet your fate  
  
You have ran out of time  
Kiss tomorrow goodbye
