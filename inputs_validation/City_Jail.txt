City jail city jail like an old scared dog I tuck my tail  
Bow my head and not a careless word is said  
Gotta sleep on the floor once more at city jail  
  
Well I was hangin round the bus station  
Mindin my own business like I always do  
When I saw this waitress in this bus station cafe  
And I thought I check out the action like I always do  
Id give her the bad eye and made a few choices personal comments  
About what I thought mine and her possibilities could be for a team  
When she called the badge on me  
The badge grabbed me by the arm and he said  
What are you doin hangin around here for  
And I said for whatevers goin around  
City jail city jail  
  
He said no what I mean is what are you doin  
Sayin things like that to that lady  
And I said whats that ladys doin with purple hair  
Well the badge said youre smart alec and I said no I aint Im just hungry  
And he said youre actin like a smart alec  
And I said no thats how I act when I get hungry  
City jail city jail  
  
Well he put me outside in a dark corner  
And before you could say hypocrite he hit me on the head  
And I said oh dont hit me on the head  
I cant protect myself with the handcuffs on  
Please dont hit me on the head then he hit me again he hit me again he hit me
again  
And I said oh oh oh oh oh please dont stand on my feet when you hit me  
I break my ankles when I fall  
  
City jail city jail  
  
Well about that time they threw me in the wagon  
And that waitress walked out with a sailor  
I said hey you not you Im talkin to the purple people eater  
Yes you lady quote youre the cause of it all unquote  
Then she said to that sailor said get me away from that horrible man Harry  
  
City jail city jail  
Well as they hauled me away I said everybody have a nice evening
