Theres a guitar leaning on a Marshall stack  
Used to sound like the sun on the horizon  
Now I think weve been had  
Theres a young girl screaming all the way in the back  
  
Poor kid she never saw it coming  
Now she knows shes been had  
Watching the label spinning on my turntable  
Theres no call waiting in my headphones  
  
And every star that shines in the back of my mind  
Is just waiting for its cover to be blown  
Theres an eardrum bleeding yeah its in my head  
How could I still be so in love when I know  
  
Weve been had  
Republicans and Democrats cant give you the facts  
Your parents wont tell you til youre grown  
That every star that shines in the back of your mind  
  
Is just waiting for its cover to be blown  
Flashing the badges just like the law of averages  
Nobody likes em where theyre from  
And every star that hides on the back of the bus  
  
Is just waiting for its cover to be blown
