All the ways that you think you know me  
All the limits that you figured out limits that you figured out  
Had to learn to keep it all below me  
Just to keep from being thrown around just to keep from being thrown around  
  
Yeah every single time the wind blows  
Every single time the wind blows  
I see it in your face Mmm  
  
In a cold night  
There will be no fair fight  
There will be no good night  
To turn and walk away  
  
To burn me with fire  
Drown me with rain  
Im gonna wake up  
Screaming your name  
  
Yes Im a sinner  
Yes Im a saint  
Whatever happens here  
Whatever happens here  
We remain  
  
Now we talk about a wasted future  
But we take a good look around  
Yeah we take a good look around  
  
Yeah we know it it hasnt been for nothing  
Cause well never let it slow us down  
No well never let it slow us down  
Oh yeah  
  
Yeah every single time the wind blows  
Every single time the wind blows  
I see it in your face Mmm  
  
In a cold night  
There will be no fair fight  
There will be no good night  
To turn and walk away  
  
So burn me with fire  
Drown me with rain  
Im gonna wake up  
Screaming your name  
  
Yes Im a sinner  
Yes Im a saint  
Whatever happens here  
Whatever happens here  
We remain  
  
Said we remain we remain  
  
Burn me with fire  
Drown me with rain  
Im gonna wake up  
Screaming your name  
  
Yes Im a sinner  
Yes Im a saint  
Whatever happens here  
Whatever happens here  
We remain
