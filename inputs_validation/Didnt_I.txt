Well I thought I could make you cry  
Oh didnt I  
I didnt think that I would miss you  
Ah did you did you true  
And I told you before  
When you walked out that door  
That I wouldnt love you any more  
I cannot cope any more  
  
Well I thought youd never lie  
Why didnt I  
I didnt think that youd be untrue  
Well did you did you too  
And Ive told you before  
When youd walk out that door  
That I would no cope any more  
I do not have you any more  
  
I thought I could make you cry  
And I tried now didnt I  
I didnt think that I would miss you  
But it wasnt true I do  
And I told you before  
A million times or more  
That when youd walk out that door  
I would no love you any more  
I do not love you any more  
  
I lied now didnt I  
Oh didnt I  
  
There are people in this town  
That say I dont give a damn  
But the people in this town  
They never could understand  
Oh they never could understand  
  
I thought I could make you cry  
And I tried now didnt I Didnt I try didnt I  
I didnt think that I would miss you  
But it wasnt true I do I do  
And I told you before  
That youd open up my sores  
And youd leave me here with scars  
I cannot take it any more  
Oh dont hurt me no more  
  
I cried and I cried now didnt I  
Why didnt I try why didnt I
