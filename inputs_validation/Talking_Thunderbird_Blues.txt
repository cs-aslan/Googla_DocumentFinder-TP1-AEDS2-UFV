Among the strangest things I ever heard  
Was when a friend of mine said Man lets get some Thunderbird  
I said Whats that he just started to grin  
Slobbered on his shirt his eyes got dim  
He said You got fiftynine cents  
  
I said Yeah I got a dollar but dont be a smartalec  
I aint gonna spend it on no Indian relic  
And he said Thunderbirds not an old Indian trinket  
Its a wine man you take it home and drink it  
I said It sure dont sound like wine to me  
And he said hed bet me the change from my dollar  
  
We hustled on down to the nearest youTateUm  
The guy wanted my ID I whipped her out and showed him  
He got a green bottle from the freezing vault  
My friend started doing backward somersaults  
Through the cottage cheese  
  
Took it back to his house started drinkin  
Pretty soon I set in to thinkin  
Man this Thunderbird tastes yummy yummy yummy  
And I know its doing good things to my tummy tum t  
Its so you reason when your on that crap  
  
Got a few more bottles chugged them down  
I pulled myself up off the ground  
Decided I go see my dearest sweet wife  
Who met me at the door with a carving knife  
Said Get them damn grape peel from between your teeth  
  
I could see were gonna have a little misunderstanding  
I said Dear I better get in touch with you later  
She said Forget it man youre never touchin me again  
  
Now Ive seen the light and heard the word  
And Im staying away from that ol dirty Thunderbird  
A message come from heaven radiant and fine  
All I drink now is communion wine  
Six days a week
