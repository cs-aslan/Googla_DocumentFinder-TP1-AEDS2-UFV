I woke up kinda sick  
The air is getting kind of thick  
And Im tired of everyone  
Like a book on a rainy day  
Im the one left off the page  
Well its too much time in the sun  
  
Have you ever wanted to try  
When everythings going right by  
  
Dont need another perfect stranger  
Driving me insane  
Constantly saying its time for you to change  
its time for you to change  
I dont need another perfect stranger  
To shout out from the sky  
Explaining the reasons the meaning of my life  
the meaning of my life  
  
So when did yes turn into no  
Should you stay or should you go  
Well youre always stuck in between  
I tried to fake a laugh or two  
But my mistakes were all for you  
Too much pain its hard to swallow  
Youll be there and gone tomorrow  
  
I cant spend another night or day  
I cant hear another word you say  
The words you say  
  
Dont need another perfect stranger  
Driving me insane  
Constantly saying its time for you to change  
time for you to change  
I dont need another perfect stranger  
To shout out from the sky  
Explaining the reasons the meaning to my life  
the meaning to my life  
  
If not for you  
Oh if not for you  
We all started strangers  
And I know Im perfect without you  
We all started strangers  
My world is perfect without you  
  
Dont need another perfect stranger  
Driving me insane  
Constantly saying its time for you to change  
its time for you to change  
  
I dont need another perfect stranger  
Shout out from the sky  
Explaining the reasons the meaning of my life  
the meaning of my life  
  
Dont need another perfect stranger  
Ringing in my ear  
Yelling and screaming I dont wanna hear  
dont wanna hear  
  
I dont need another perfect stranger  
Trying to run my life  
Constantly pushing  
I dont want your advice  
  
I dont need another perfect stranger
