Why you always got to be so cool  
And why I always got to play your fool  
You dont really know what lifes about  
Baby come and let your feelings out  
  
Say you really want me  
Dont keep it to yourself  
Say you really need me  
Just me and no one else  
Say you really love me  
Ooh let me know its true  
Say you really want me  
The way that I want you tonight  
  
You dont know a thing about romance  
Deep inside youre scared to take the chance  
Cause love like this may never come again  
Make your move or Ill be in the wind  
  
I need somebody through the thick and the thin  
Cause I know the problems of today  
The time is over now for playing those games  
Lets take it all the way
