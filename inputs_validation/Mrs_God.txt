Mrs God am I right  
Thats your real address  
This time its you  
Ready to confess  
Free the masculine world  
Cancel their humility  
  
Mrs God can it be  
Can You be the light  
One dressed to kill  
  
Walk on how you bite  
This will state and explain  
Why men are sometimes stumbling  
  
Mrs God are You there  
Laughing at us is not fair  
Mrs God can You see  
All the shit Youve done to me  
  
Mrs God may I say  
Its nothing of my kind  
Were so deceived  
Youd better left us blind  
  
Mrs God we are cool  
Take it with the smile  
But dont be cruel  
Thats heavy to defy  
In some hundred years  
God has always had the tears
