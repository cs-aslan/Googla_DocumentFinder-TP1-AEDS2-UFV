Pretty little one  
How has it all begun  
Theyre teaching you how to walk  
But youre already on the run  
Little one  
What you gonna do  
Little one  
Honey its all up to you  
  
Now your daddys in the den shootin up the evening news  
Mamas with a friend lately shes been so confused  
Little one  
Come on and take my hand  
I may not have the answer but I believe I got a plan  
  
Honey you shake and Ill rattle and well roll on down the line  
And see if we cant get in touch with a very close friend of mine  
But let me clue you in it aint like him  
To argue or pretend  
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend  
  
Well theyve got a little list of all those things of which they dont approve  
Theyve got to keep their eyes on you or you might make your move  
Little one  
I really wish you would  
Little one  
I think the damage would do you good  
  
Honey you shake and Ill rattle and well roll on down the line  
Were going to forget all about the battle  
Its gonna feel so fine  
Cause hes the missing link the kitchen sink  
Eleven on a scale of ten  
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend  
  
Honey you shake and Ill rattle and well roll on down the line  
Im going to try to swing you up into my saddle  
And then well run but youll think were flyin  
Now honey dont just stand there  
Lookin like this dream will never end  
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend
