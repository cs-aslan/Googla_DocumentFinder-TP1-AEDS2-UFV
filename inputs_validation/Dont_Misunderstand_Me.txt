Written by John Mellencamp  
  
I bring you renegade stories  
And you tell me Im crazy and wild  
You say that I lack maturity  
Stop actin like a child  
But you know I am a liar  
And my promises only get in my way  
You feel so good when youre in my arms  
Aint there one right thing I can say  
To make oyu want to stay  
  
Chorus  
Oh oh baby baby  
Dont misunderstand me  
Oh oh baby baby  
  
You tell me that you love me but  
This aint no way for you to live  
You hold so tight your fingers are broken  
I take more than I care to give  
But its heartbeat to heartbeat  
Its push and shove and steal and prove  
Its hand to mouth sometimes  
If we run hard enough someday baby  
Gonna find some room to move  
  
Chorus  
  
All of this showin and provin  
Is nothing but fear  
Everybody can do what they want  
But they just cant do it here  
Girl hold on to my childishness  
Im gonna break on through  
Out of this mess  
  
Chorus
