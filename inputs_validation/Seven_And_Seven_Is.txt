When I was a boy I thought about the times Id be a man  
Id sit inside a bottle and pretend that I was in a jam  
In my lonely room Id sit my mind in an ice cream cone  
You can throw me if you want to cause Im a bone and I go  
  
Oopipip oopipip yeah  
  
If I dont start cryin its because that I have got no eyes  
My fathers in the fireplace and my dog lies hypnotized  
Through a crack of light I was unable to find my way  
Trapped inside a night but Im a day and I go  
  
Oopipip oopipip yeah
