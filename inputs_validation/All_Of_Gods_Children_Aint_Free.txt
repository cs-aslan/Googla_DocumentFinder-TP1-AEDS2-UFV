Id sing more about moral of this land but all Gods children aint free  
Id open up every door I can cause all Gods children aint free  
I met a beaten broken man he shovels dirt but got no land  
And he held out his hand to me all Gods children aint free  
  
Id sing along too a silly song but all Gods children aint free  
Im gonna sing the blues for the men they done wrong  
Cause all Gods children aint free  
Mister how bout the man you condemn to die  
  
But taking everything that hes livin by  
And reject him from society all Gods children aint free  
No reject him from society all Gods children aint free  
  
Harmonica  
  
Id be happy walking any street but all Gods children aint free  
Id have a smile for all I meet but all Gods children aint free  
Id whistle down the road but I wouldnt feel right  
Id hear somebody cryin out at night  
  
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all Gods children aint free  
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all Gods children aint free
