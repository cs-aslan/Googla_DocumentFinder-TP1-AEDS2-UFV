The tramp moves on to the end of the street  
I listen to the echo of his hobnail feet  
For some theres a future to find  
But I think theyre leaving me behind  
The world humes on at its breakneck pace  
People fly in their lifelong race  
For them theres a future to find  
But I think theyre leaving me behind  
The chances they come but the chances have been lost  
Success can be gained but at too great a cost  
For some theres a future to find  
But I think theyre leaving me behind  
The wind sweeps up and goes back to its tree  
The rain flows by and moves to the sea  
For them theres a future to find  
But I think theyre leaving me behind
