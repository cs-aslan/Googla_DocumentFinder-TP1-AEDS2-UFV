Cmon off your seats  
Im gonna tell ya bout a beat  
Thats gonna make ya move your feet  
  
Ill give the barbecue  
Show and tell you how to move  
If youre five or eighty two  
This is somethin you can do  
  
Pop it lock it  
Polka dot it  
Countrify then hip hop it  
Put your hawk in the sky  
Side to side  
Jump to the left  
Stick it glide  
Zig zag cross the floor  
Shuffle in diagonal  
When the drum hits  
Hands on your hips  
One foot it 180 twist  
And then a zig zag  
Step slide  
Lean it left  
Clap three times  
Shake it out  
Head to toe  
Throw it all together  
Thats how we roll

Throw it all together

And youre feelin busted  
But its not time to quit  
Practice makes you perfect  
  
Pop it lock it  
Polka dot it  
Countrify then hip hop it  
Put your hawk in the sky  
Side to side  
Jump to the left  
Stick it glide  
Zig zag cross the floor  
Shuffle in diagonal  
When the drum hits  
Hands on your hips  
One foot it 180 twist  
And then a zig zag

Lean it left  
Clap three times
