I am a good old Rebel thats exactly what I am  
The open land of freedom I do not give a damn  
We heard a thousand Yankees well Im dead on that Southern thing  
We got three hundred thousand all they ever got next to us  
They gather the Southern people at an old Southern steel shop  
And I wish wed got three million more mud weve got  
I cant take off my musket fire now no more  
But I aint gonna rebel yes I got damn sure  
You dont want no part in what Ive done or am  
And I will not be reconstructed and I do not give a damn
