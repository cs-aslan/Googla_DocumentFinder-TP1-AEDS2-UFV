Ive been out walking  
I dont do too much talking these days  
These days  
These days I seem to think a lot  
About the things that I forgot to do  
And all the times I had the chance to  
  
I stopped my ramblin  
I dont do too much gamblin these days  
These days  
These days I seem to think about  
How all the changes came about my way  
And I wonder if Ill see another highway  
  
And I had a lover  
I dont think Ill risk another these days  
These days  
And if I seem to be afraid  
To live the life that I have made in song  
Well its just cause Ive been losing so long  
  
Well Ill stop my dreamin  
I dont do too much schemin these days  
These days  
These days Ill sit on cornerstones  
And count the time in quartertones to ten  
Please dont confront me with my failures  
I had not forgotten them
