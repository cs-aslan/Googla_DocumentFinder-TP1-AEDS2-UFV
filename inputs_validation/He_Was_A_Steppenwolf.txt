Come on and listen to my tale  
Its a strange and sorry tale  
Thats gonna rock you  
About a man the drifting kind  
Let the story now unwind  
Its gonna shock you  
  
Some people said he was a ghost  
Wouldnt want to be his host  
Or just to meet him  
And if he ever came their way  
Theyd be sticks and stones Id say  
That would grieve him  
  
He was a steppenwolf a lost and lonely one  
He was a steppenwolf forever on the run  
He was a steppenwolf with a forgotten past  
He was a steppenwolf who found a love at last  
He was a steppenwolf  
  
The girl he met was outofsight  
Though she walked the streets at night  
He didnt mind it  
She seemed as happy as a song  
And if anything was wrong  
He didnt find it  
  
They used to laugh and dance and drink  
And not ever did he think of a payday  
No matter where they ever were  
Every day he spent with her was a heyday  
  
He was a steppenwolf and not a handsome man  
He was a steppenwolf who didnt know her plan  
He was a steppenwolf not very bright at all  
He was a steppenwolf just riding for a fall  
He was a steppenwolf  
  
One day she said its time you knew  
That I started up with you  
For just one reason  
Youre gonna do just what I want  
cause theres something that I want  
And I aint teasing  
My life is empty all around  
Nothing that I ever found  
Would fulfill me  
So for a while Ill be with you  
When I say that were through  
You must kill me  
  
He was a steppenwolf he cried it isnt fair  
He was a steppenwolf you know how much I care  
He was a steppenwolf she said this is the deal  
He was a steppenwolf he saw this was for real  
He was a steppenwolf  
  
He was a steppenwolf they spent a long last night  
He was a steppenwolf and with a smile she died  
He was a steppenwolf a lost and lonely one  
He was a steppenwolf forever on the run  
He was a steppenwolf
