Chorus  
Calling Elvis is anybody home  
Calling Elvis Im here all alone  
Did he leave the building  
Or can he come to the phone  
Calling Elvis Im here all alone  
  
Well tell him I was calling just to wish him well  
Let me leave my number heartbreak hotel  
Oh love me tender baby dont be cruel  
Return to sender treat me like a fool  
  
Chorus  
  
Why dont you go get him Im his biggest fan  
You gotta tell him hes still the man  
Long distance baby so far from home  
Dont you think maybe you could put him on  
  
Well tell him I was calling just to wish him well  
Let me leave my number heartbreak hotel  
Oh love me tender baby dont be cruel  
Return to sender treat me like a fool  
  
Chorus
