She was a lonely girl without a dream  
Then one day a flash of light down by that stream  
Far away on a silver screen she saw an image of herself  
Shed never seen  
No more lonely nights no more lonely tears Repeat x2  
  
She was awiping the tears away saying farewell  
She made up her mind to leave find that dream  
Well I know youre happy wherever you are  
Each day brings me closer to you however far  
No more lonely nights no more lonely tears Repeat x2  
No more lonely nights she crying no more tears  
  
Shes out there Her eyes can see  
Into the future and her destiny  
Never look back no no no no to the shades of the past  
By the way you look you know you know  
You want it you want it to last  
No more lonely nights no more lonely tears Repeat x2  
No more lonely nights crying no more tears  
  
Shes wiping the tears away shes saying farewell
