We were sailing along on Moonlight Bay  
We could hear the voices ringing  
They seemed to say  
You have stolen her heart  
Now dont go way  
As we sang loves old sweet song on Moonlight Bay  
  
We were sailing along on Moonlight Bay  
We could hear the voices ringing  
They seemed to say  
You have stolen her heart  
Now dont go way  
As we sang loves old sweet song on Moonlight Bay  
  
We were sailing along on Moonlight Bay  
We could hear the voices ringing  
They seemed to say  
You have stolen her heart You have stolen her heart  
Now dont go way  
As we sang loves old sweet song on Moonlight Bay  
Sailing through the moonlight on Moonlight Bay
