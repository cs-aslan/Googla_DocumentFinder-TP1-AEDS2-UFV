Theyve taken Christ from Christmas  
Filled it with earthly joys  
Like frosty and Rudolph  
Even a drummer boy  
They need to know that Christ is Christmas  
They need to know that Christ is Christmas  
Sent down to save the world from sin  
Thats why he came my friend  
They really need to know  
  
Theyve taken Christ from Christmas  
Replaced him with toys and games  
The world really needs to know  
Thats not why he came  
They need to know that Christ is Christmas  
They need to know that Christ is Christmas  
Sent down to save the world from sin  
Thats why he came my friend  
They really need to know  
  
They need to know he came to save the world  
Sent down to save every precious boy and girl  
Sent down to save the world from sin  
Thats why he came my friend  
They really need to know
