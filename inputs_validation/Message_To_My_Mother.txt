Chorus  
Take this message to my mother  
It will fill her heart with joy  
Tell her that Ive met my savior  
God has saved her wandring boy  
  
The tears and sorrow I have caused her  
How I wish I could repay  
But tell her Ill be waiting for her  
Well meet in heaven some glad day  
  
How she cried when I left her  
I know it filled her heart with pain  
She said son please dont leave me  
For we may never meet again  
  
Chorus  
  
Years have passed since that parting  
But I know she waits and prays  
Soon Ill cross that dark river  
Please let her know that I was saved  
  
Chorus
