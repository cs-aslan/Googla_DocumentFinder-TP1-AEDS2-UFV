Some days youre gonna put me on hold  
Some days youre gonna put me  
On a pedestal up high  
I dont know if its me  
I dont know if its you  
I dont know if its both of us  
Not knowing what to do  
When were running out of love  
Not knowing what to do  
When were running out of love  
And when it comes to taking my calls  
Theres something more between us  
Than a telephone line  
I cant believe its me  
I cant believe its you  
I cant believe its both of us  
Not knowing what to do  
When were running out of love  
Not knowing what to do  
When were running out of love  
  
Cant think of how we lost our way  
Some days I feel  
Im getting very close to you  
Cant think of how the story ends  
Cant hear the words  
I really want to hear from you  
Were running out of love  
Cant believe were running out of love  
Cant believe were running out of love  
  
Some people like to put you on hold  
Some people like to put you  
On a pedestal up high  
I dont know if its me  
I dont know if its you  
I dont know if its both of us  
Not knowing what to do  
When were running out of love  
Not knowing what to do  
When were running out of love  
  
Cant believe were running out of love  
Cant believe were running out of love  
Cant believe were running out of love
