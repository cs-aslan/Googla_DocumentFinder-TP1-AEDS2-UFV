Good God what do I see  
Pretty little thing just  
Looking at me  
Ohhhh ohhhh sexy thing  
I say walk that thing  
Right over here  
Just one thing Ive got to make clear  
Ohhhh ohhhh sexy thing  
  
The way you move your body  
Its driving me insane  
Dont you dare take me there  
Then shoot me down in flames  
  
Shes just like a loaded gun I just gotta get me some  
Girls so hot you know is true  
That woman gonna make a man of you  
  
Really aint no mystery  
I want you and you want me  
Ohhhh ohhhh sexy thing  
I want your ten toes up and my ten toes down  
Two wet bodies going round and round  
Ohhhh ohhhh sexy thing  
  
Now it really aint no secret I dont want this night to end  
She said dont you worry Bret I brought along a friend  
  
Shes like a loaded gun I just gotta get me some  
Girls so hot you know is true  
That woman gonna make a man of you  
She make a dead man come  
I gotta get me some  
  
The way you move your body  
Its driving me insane  
Dont you dare take me there  
Then shoot me down in flames  
  
Shes just like a loaded gun I just gotta get me some  
Girls so hot you know is true  
That woman gonna make a man of you  
Shes just like a loaded gun I just gotta get me some  
She make a dead man come  
I gotta get me some
