Left on an eastbound train  
Gone first thing this morning

Why cause Im tired of hating  
When will it be your turn  
Why cause Im tired of waiting

Well no I dont find faith in your false feelings  
Not fooled by your misleadings  
Wont buy this line youre selling  
Tired of this lie youre telling

She says Im only telling half of it  
Thats probably cause theres only half worth telling  
And every time I try to laugh it off  
Thats when you turn around wind up yelling

Why cause Im tired of hating  
When will it be your turn  
Why cause Im tired of waiting
