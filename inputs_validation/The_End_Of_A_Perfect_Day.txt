I want to tell you something  
Its not a secret or anything  
Youre not alone in being alone  
At the end of a perfect day  
  
And if you leave all your dependents  
Then they will gain their independence  
Dont make a martyr of yourself  
Its just the end of a perfect day  
  
And its never how it seems  
The rain may fall on the best laid schemes  
But in a written testimonial Id say  
I never really knew you anyway  
  
I want to tell you something  
Now dont go crazy or anything  
Just want to tell you that its over  
Its the end of a perfect day  
  
Do you want sign language  
Dont want a knuckle sandwich  
Now you can love or you can hate its just  
The end of a perfect day  
  
You cant get inside someone  
So dont ask me if were close  
I really couldnt tell you  
But I know you wouldnt really listen anyway  
  
Its a pain you have to bear  
And its always going to be there  
But if you disappeared tomorrow  
Then the world would carry on without you anyway  
  
Mind over matter it seems  
Can stop you falling apart at the seams  
Its a matter of honour with me  
I could write out a hundred times  
  
Put my hand on my heart and say  
That I dont want to lie  
Dont want to lie  
Dont want to lie  
About the way it is  
  
I want to tell you something  
Dont act surprised now or anything  
Now you can revel in yourself cause  
Its just the end of a perfect day  
  
No its not a pretty world out there  
With people dying of their own despair  
But in a written testimonial youd say  
You never really knew them anyway
