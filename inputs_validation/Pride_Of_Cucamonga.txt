Out on the edge of an empty highway  
Howling at the blood on the moon  
Big diesel Mack truck rolling down my way  
I cant hit that border too soon  
Running hard out of Muskrat Flats  
It was sixty days or double life  
Hail on my back like a shotgun blast  
High wind chimes in the night  
Oh oh the pride of Cucamonga  
Oh oh bitter olives in the sun  
Oh oh I had me some lovin  
And I done some time  
Since I came down from Oregon  
Theres a lesson or two Ive learned  
By standing in the road alone  
Standing watching the fires burn  
The northern sky it stinks with greed  
You could smell it for miles around  
The good ole boys in the Greystone Hotel  
Sitting doing that git on down  
Oh oh the pride of Cucamonga  
Oh oh silver apples in the sun  
Oh oh I had me some lovin  
And I done some time  
I see your silver shining town  
But I know I cant go there  
Your streets run deep with poisoned wine  
Your doorways crawl with fear  
So I think Ill drift for ol where its at  
Where the weed grows green and fine  
And wrap myself around a bush of that bright  
Whoa on Oaxaca vine  
Yes its me Im the pride of Cucamonga  
I can see golden forests in the sun  
Oh oh I had me some lovin  
And I done some time  
And I done some time  
And I done some time
