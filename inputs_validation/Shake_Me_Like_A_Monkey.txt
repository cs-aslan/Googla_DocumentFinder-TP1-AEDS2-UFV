The thing I like about you  
The way you do what you do  
The thing I like about you  
God and the devil alone could not have made you up  
  
Two must have worked as one together  
So good just want to eat you up  
Let me like the real thing  
Lick your sticky fingers boy and sing for your dinner sing  
  
Come on pretty babe make me lose my mind  
Everybody get together gonna make love shine  
  
Do you know what it is to feel the light of love inside you  
And all the darkness falls away  
If you feel the way I feel then believe we have the answer  
Ive been searching for tonight  
Love me baby love me baby shake me like a monkey  
Forever Im yours  
  
I cant stop thinking about you  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Why would I want to  
I like coffee with toast and jelly  
But Id rather be licking from your back to your belly  
I think Im going to  
  
Do you know what it is to feel the light of love inside you  
And all the darkness falls away  
If you feel the way I feel then believe we have the answer  
Ive been searching for tonight  
Love me baby love me baby shake me like a monkey  
Forever Im yours  
  
Cigarettes and coffee broken heart and being lonely little girls  
And ponies are the things that go together  
Yes and no you have to choose Romeo and Juliet to hang their noose  
You and me would go together  
  
Kiss Kiss make a wish  
Hope that it comes true  
But I aint waiting for the world to change  
Gonna change the world for you  
  
Come on pretty baby make you lose your mind  
Everybody get together gonna make love shine  
  
Do you know what it is to feel the light of love inside you  
And all the darkness falls away  
If you feel the way I feel then believe we have the answer  
Ive been searching for tonight  
Love me baby love me baby shake me like a monkey  
Forever Im yours  
  
Come on everybody make me lose my mind  
Everybody get together gonna make love shine
