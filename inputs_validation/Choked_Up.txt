I dont know why we cant talk  
Every time we try we get choked up  
Running with the feelings that gets caught in your head  
Til I cant remember what it was we said  
All my friends say Im in love  
Is this what I think theyre thinking of  
  
I dont know why we cant win  
Every time we lose we just pretend  
Running out of money at the end of the month  
None of it can buy the things I want  
All my friends say Im in love  
Is this what I think theyre thinking of  
Count my friends on my left hand  
I dont need another who wouldnt understand  
  
Take myself with thoughts of leaving  
Running out of things left to believe in  
Running out of money and time  
Running out of money and time  
You wont be mine  
  
I dont know why we cant win  
Every time we lose we just pretend  
Running out of money at the end of the month  
None of it can buy the things I want  
All my friends say Im in love  
Is this what I think theyre thinking of  
Count my friends on my left hand  
I dont need another who wouldnt understand  
All my friends say Im in love  
Is this what I think theyre thinking of  
All my friends say Im in love  
Is this what I think theyre thinking of
