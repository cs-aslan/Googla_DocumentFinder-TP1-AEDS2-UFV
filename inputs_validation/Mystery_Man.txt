Keep your distance youll never know how it feels  
Ive been to places that took my mind away from me  
Your aiming questions opens the wound that just wont heal  
Im just a man that uncle sam gave the dark side of the deal  
So much for the constitution and the home of the free  
Fighting for a nation thats brought me to my knees  
Wherever I go people wanna know  
Whos that mystery man  
I stand all alone my name carved in stone  
Im the mystery man  
Out in the jungle I didnt know then what I know now  
Out in the jungle I faced the danger next to me  
Deep in the trenches I could have died it was understood  
I couldnt cry too afraid to show the fear  
Wherever I go people wanna know  
Whos that mystery man  
I stand all alone my name carved in stone  
Im the mystery man  
Wherever I go people wanna know  
Whos that mystery man  
Im living the pain and stuck with that name  
The mystery man
