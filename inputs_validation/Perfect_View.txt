My sweet darling night  
How the city swings  
A little kiss of angels  
A little tune of things  
And she mesmerizes  
captivates  
A message for  
a heart that aches  
now you are 16  
and your stuck in jail  
18 plus  
theres no sign of bail  
And she mesmerizes  
captivates  
A message for  
a heart that aches  
My thousand dollars  
aint going nowhere  
And the revelations  
kiss tell and dare  
Ive got a perfect view  
of what I want to do  
Ive got a perfect view  
am I getting through to you  
21 is easy  
but I dont know why  
Theres no difference  
this bird will fly  
My thousand dollars  
aint going nowhere  
And the revelations  
kiss tell and dare  
Ive got a perfect view  
of what I want to do  
Ive got a perfect view  
am I getting through to you  
Solo  
And she mesmerizes  
captivates  
A message for a  
heart that aches  
My sweet darling night  
How the city swings  
A little kiss of angels  
A little tune of things  
My thousand dollars  
aint going nowhere  
And the revelations  
kiss tell and dare  
Ive got a perfect view  
of what I want to do  
Ive got a perfect view  
am I getting through to you  
Ive got a perfect view  
of what I really want to do  
Ive got a perfect view  
am I getting through to you  
Perfect view  
Ive got a perfect view
