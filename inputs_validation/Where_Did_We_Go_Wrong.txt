How could we be naughty when Id thought wed been so nice  
Could we have been blinded to some little hidden vice  
Did our visions of sugar plums not dance like they should  
Im racking my brain here I really thought we were good  
  
I know youve got that list and I know you check it twice  
But could you check it again  
Cause it seems to me we were all pretty nice  
All except for Buford cause hes got that whole lastminute reprieve
theory  
Its gonna work You watch   
  
Where did we go wrong  
Please tell me  
Where did we go wrong  
Where did we go  
Wont somebody tell me  
Where did we go wrong
