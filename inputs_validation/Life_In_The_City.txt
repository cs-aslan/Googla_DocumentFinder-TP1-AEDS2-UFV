Cut it down go put it away  
Take an inside look on the outside  
Another day  
  
Take time look at the sunshine  
Have mine its better on you anyway  
  
Nobodys perfect all the time  
But I know you  
And you know me  
And its alright  
  
Waking up gonna buy me some shoes  
Take a long walk out of the hindsight start anew  
  
Look around maybe buy a new topcoat  
Stop moping the rains gonna rain through  
Rain through on you  
Yes its true that  
  
Nobodys sunny all the time  
But I know you  
And you know me  
And its alright  
  
And its your life  
And its my life  
Its our life in the city  
  
And its your life  
And its my life  
Its our life in the city  
  
Got a new piece out in the hills  
Plant a seed Im in need of a break from the fire drill  
Repaint where all the paint aint  
Got a clean slate and maybe we can buy a thrill  
Ill foot that bill  
Yes I will  
  
Nobodys busy all the time  
Oh thank God that I know you  
And you know me  
And its alright  
  
Oh you cut it down go put it away  
Take an inside look on the outside  
Another day  
  
Take time look at the sunshine  
Have mine its better on you anyway  
  
Cut it down go put it away  
Take an inside look on the outside  
Another day  
  
Take time look at the sunshine  
Have mine its better on you anyway
