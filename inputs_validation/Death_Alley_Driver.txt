Rough and ready rider  
In a supersonic sound machine  
Rock and Roll survivor  
Chrome pipes between your knees  
Running all the red lites  
Your gonna make a dead stop  
But you just cant see the signs  
Oh  youll never win the race  
But you cant give up the chase  
Death alley driver  
Living at high speed  
Death alley driverYeah  
Death alley driverwho knows what you need  
Death alley driver  
One hundred twenty five smokin on the turns  
Always on the hit and run  
But you never learn  
Running from the man and youre running  
From yourself  
Another dirty angel heading straight to hell  
Oh  youll never win the race  
But you wont give up the chase  
Death alley driver  
Live in overdriveDeath alley driveryeah  
Death alley driverride to stay alive  
Death alley driver  
lets go  
Red lights in the mirror  
Danger on the band  
Got to take a detour cause a road blocks up ahead  
He takes you on the corner with a wave of his hand  
Death is in the back seat of a big old black sedan  
Oh  youll never win the race  
As you turn and see his face  
Death alley driver  
Movin for the kill  
Death alley driveryeah  
Death alley driver  
Time is standing still  
Death alley driver  
Always on the run cause youre a  
Death alley driver  
Love the way it feels  
Death alley driveryeah  
Death alley driver  
Hell on wheels  
Death alley driver ooh
