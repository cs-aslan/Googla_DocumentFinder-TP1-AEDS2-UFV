Its how we do it our feet in the sand  
Its how we do it our heads in our hands  
Its how we do it Im not looking for a reason to go  
Its how we do it we did it we done it but never before  
  
I know  
You put the keys in the car and drive  
Im gonna make sure the money is right  
Know we can do it if we do it all night  
You put the keys in the car and drive  
  
Its how we do it  
Its how we do it if I lose you Im losing control  
So snap your fingers pull the trigger cause I figure were better as gold  
Its how we do it Im a satellite looking for a signal to space  
Its how we do it we did it we done it lets do it again  
  
  
You put the keys in the car and drive  
  
Im gonna make sure the money is right  
Know we can do it if we do it all night  
  
You put the keys in the car and drive  
Ill find somebody who will stitch me up  
No Ive never been better than when falling apart  
  
I Know we can do it if we do it all night  
You put the keys in the car and drive  
  
You put the keys in the car and drive  
  
For all that I know its gonna come back tenfold  
For all that I know its gonna come back tenfold  
  
But Darlin Oh no I dont think that well make it out alive  
  
Darlin Oh no we wont make it out alive  
Now Im lying with each passing day  
  
So if youre coming then come quick cause Im scared  
Im floating away  
  
  
Its how we do it for the first time I dont need a reason to go  
Its how we do it we did it we done it lets do it some more  
  
You put the keys in the car and drive  
Im gonna make sure the money is right  
Know we can do it if we do it all night  
You put the keys in the car and drive  
  
  
Ill find somebody who will stitch me up  
No Ive never been better than when falling apart  
I Know we can do it if we do it all night  
You put the keys in the car and drive  
You put the keys in the car and drive  
You put the keys in the car  
  
And drive
