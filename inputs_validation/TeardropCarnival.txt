Love love is a verb  
Love is a doing word  
Feathers on my breath  
Gentle impulsion  
Shakes me makes me lighter  
Fearless on my breath  
  
Teardrop on the fire  
Fearless on myx2  
  
Water is my eye  
Most faithful mirror  
Fearless on my breath  
Teardrop on the fire of a confession  
Fearless on my breath  
  
Teardrop on the fire  
Fearless on my  
  
You know youre not a strong man  
Youre just about to cry  
Hang on Hang on  
Its no fun  
  
You worry about the future  
The sign said yoga class for cats  
Its okay Its okay  
Its no fun  
  
Youre frustrated by the cracks  
In the pavement  
And every mothers back  
Once again  
Caaaarnival closed down  
But if this world would ever turn around  
  
Oh Youll be there  
  
And the dynamite is waiting  
Cause they bankrupted the sky  
Its okay Its okay  
Its no fun  
  
Youre frustrated by the cracks  
In the pavement  
And every mothers back  
Once again  
Caaaaaaaaaarnival closed down  
  
Everybodys sane  
Ohh everyone is sane x2  
Youll be there x7  
Youll be there Oh  
  
Are you worry about the future x3
