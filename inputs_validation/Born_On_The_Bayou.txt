Now when I was just a little boy standin to my Daddys knee  
My Poppa said son dont let the man get you do what he done to me  
Cause hell get you cause hell get you now now  
  
I can remember the fourth of July runnin through the backwood bare  
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin chasin down a hoodoo there  
Chasin down a hoodoo there  
  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou  
  
Wish I was back on the bayou rollin with some Cajun Queen  
Wishin I were a fast freight train oh just achooglin on down to New
Orleans  
  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou  
  
I can remember the fourth of July runnin through the backwood bare  
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin chasin down a hoodoo there  
Chasin down a hoodoo there  
  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou  
Born on the bayou
