Bless his ever loving heart  
Only he knows who you are  
He may seem so very far  
Bless his ever loving heart  
  
And when youre feeling sad  
And everywhere you look you cant believe the things you see  
When it all comes down so bad  
And beauty lies exhausted in the streets  
  
Hold his ever loving hand  
Even when you do not understand  
Sorrow has its natural end  
Hold his ever loving hand  
  
And when youre feeling low  
And everyone you meet you cant believe the things they say  
When theres no place left to go  
Where someone isnt moving you a little further down the way  
  
Bless his ever loving heart  
What you do is what you are  
When it all comes down so hard  
Bless his ever loving heart  
Hold his ever loving hand  
When it seems you aint got a friend  
  
Only he knows who you are and what you are  
Bless his ever loving heart  
Bless his ever loving heart
