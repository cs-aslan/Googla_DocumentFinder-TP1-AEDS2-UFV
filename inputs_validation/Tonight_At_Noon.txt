Tonight at noon tonight at noon  
When we meet in the midnight hour  
I will bring you night flowers coloured  
Like your eyes  
Tonight at noon Ill touch your hand  
Held for a moment amongst strangers  
Amongst the dripping trees  
Country girl  
Walking in city squares in winter rain  
Walking down muddy lanes or empty streets  
Arranging a time and place to meet  
Tonight at noon youll feel my warmth  
Youll feel my body inside you  
Well be together for hours  
Time and tears  
Wont wait for evermore  
For the time is now  
And now is the time to explore  
Why waste the world outside  
When youre sure
