Something for the girl with everything  
See the writings on the wall  
You bought the girl a wall  
Complete with matching ballpoint pen  
  
You can breathe another day  
Secure in knowing she wont break you yet  
Something for the girl with everything  
Have another sweet my dear  
  
Dont try to talk my dear  
Your tiny little mouth is full  
Heres a flavour you aint tried  
You shouldnt try to talk your mouth is full  
  
Something for the girl with everything  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
Bearing gifts to aid amnesia  
  
She knows everything  
Yes yes everyting  
She knew way back when you werent yourself  
Something for the girl with everything  
  
Heres a really preatty car  
I hope it takes you far  
I hope it takes you fast and far  
Wow the engines really loud  
  
Nobodys gonna hear a thing you say  
Something for the girl with everything  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
  
Where should they leave these imported gimmicks  
Leave them anywhere  
Anananywhere  
Make sure that theres a clear path to the door

A gardener for the tree  
Complete with ornithologist  
Careful careful with that crate  
  
You wouldnt want to dent Sinatra no  
Something for the girl who has got everything  
Yes yes everything  
Hey come out and say hello  
  
Before you friends all go  
But say no more than just hello  
Ah the little girl is shy  
You see of late shes been quite speechless  
  
Very speechless  
Shes got everything
