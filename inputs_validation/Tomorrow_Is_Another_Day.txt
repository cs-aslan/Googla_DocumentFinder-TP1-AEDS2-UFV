Yes the roof leaks and the bed she squeak  
And the rent is due in just two more weeks  
Now I just want to go back to sleep  
Tomorrow is another day  
  
Oh the palm trees sway to and fro  
I think Ill just sit and watch the coconuts grow  
Its hard to get high when your feeling so low  
And tomorrow is another day  
  
Well the mainsail broke on my fishing boat  
And its almost time for my rum and Coke  
Ill fix it as soon as I have a smoke  
Tomorrow is another day yeah  
  
So you go at night with your lantern bright  
And you sit on the bridge and you get half tight  
Ah tonight you cant get the fish to bite  
But tomorrows another day yeah yeah  
  
Tomorrow is another day  
You know what I mean son  
I want to go fishing and swimming  
Looking at the pretty girls on the beaches son  
I dont want to do no work
