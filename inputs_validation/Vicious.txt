Vicious you hit me with a flower  
You do it every hour  
Oh baby youre so vicious  
Vicious you want me to hit you with a stick  
All I got here is a guitar pick  
Baby youre so vicious  
When I see you come baby I just have to run far away  
Youre not the kind of person around whom I want to stay ah ah  
when I see you coming  
When I see you coming down my street  
I just have to run  
I step on your hands and I mangle your feet  
when I see you come come come come  
Youre not the kind of person with whom I want to make  
Cause youre so vicious  
Ah ah vicious vicious  
Oh yeah  
  
Delicious you hit me with your flower  
You do it every hour  
Oh baby youre so vicious  
Vicious why dont you go swallow razor blades  
You must think im some kind of gay blade Uh uh  
Oh baby youre so vicious  
When I see you coming baby I just got to run  
run run  
Far away  
Youre not that good but youre  
Certainly fair game  
when I see you coming  
When I see you coming down my street  
I just have to run  
I step on your hands and I mangle your feet  
when I see you come come come come  
Youre not the kind of person that I even wanna meet  
Cause youre so vicious  
Youre so vicious youre so vicious  
Youre so vicious youre so vicious  
Youre so vicious youre so vicious  
Youre so vicious
