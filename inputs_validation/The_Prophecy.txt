Now that I know that the right time has come  
My prediction will surely be true  
The impending disaster it looms  
And the whole of the village is doomed  
Why wont you listen to me  
It is so hard to understand  
That I am the real seventh son  
Your life or death on me depends  
  
Suffering and pain impending disaster  
Souls crying the devils laughter  
Heard the cry of the seven whistlers  
Lucifer smiles looks on and waits  
  
Ill take your life in my hands  
Your fate your fortunes in my visions  
Heed what I say and youll see  
What will be  
Please listen to me  
  
Now that they see the disaster is done  
Now they put all the blame unto me  
They feel I brought on a curse  
Dont they know that the torment  
It stays with me knowing that I walk alone  
Through the eyes of the future I see  
They dont even know what fear is  
Dont they know Im the one who is cursed  
  
Purgatory beckons souls lost forever  
Life after death or heaven hereafter  
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again  
Now Lucifer laughs hell awaits  
  
I had their lives in my hands  
Their fate their fortunes in my visions  
No one believed in my true prophecy  
And now its too late
