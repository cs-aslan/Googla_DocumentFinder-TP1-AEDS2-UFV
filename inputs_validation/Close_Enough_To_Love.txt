Your eyes reflect the sadness  
Inside your broken heart  
Youre afraid to love again so openly  
Id gladly spend my lifetime  
Repairing every part  
Oh thats close enough to love for me  
  
And if youre hung up on the memory  
Of some other man  
When you close your eyes if its still him you see  
If I cant have you completely  
Ill cherish what I can  
Oh thats close enough to love for me  
  
Pickin up the pieces  
Is hard to do alone  
And now your mind is set on stayin free  
I just want to hold you  
Until the hurt is gone  
Oh thats close enough to love for me  
  
I just want to hold you  
Until the hurt is gone  
Oh thats close enough to love for me
