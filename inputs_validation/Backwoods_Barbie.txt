I grew up poor and ragged just a simple country girl  
I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world  
Like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks catalog  
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all  
Im just a backwoods Barbie too much makeup too much hair  
Dont be fooled by thinkin that the goods are not all there  
Dont let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that  
Im as shallow as I look cause I run true and deep  
  
Ive always been misunderstood because of how I look  
Dont judge me by the cover cause Im a real good book  
So read into it what you will but see me as I am  
The way I look is just a country girls idea of glam  
  
Im just a backwoods Barbie in a pushup bra and heels  
I might look artificial but where it counts Im real  
And Im all dolled up and hopin for a chance to prove my worth  
And even backwoods Barbies get their feelings hurt  
  
Im just a backwoods Barbie too much makeup too much hair  
Dont be fooled by thinkin that the goods are not all there  
Yes I can see where I could be misjudged upon first glance  
But even backwoods Barbies deserve a second chance  
Im just a backwoods Barbie just asking for a chance  
Just a backwoods Barbie
