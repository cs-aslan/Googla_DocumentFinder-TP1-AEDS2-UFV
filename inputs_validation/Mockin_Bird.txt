Mocking Bird high in a tree  
Looks like you got the best of me  
Mocking Bird singing his song  
Well Mocking Bird mocking me  
Now that youre gone  
  
Mocking Bird high in a loof  
Well hes blowing notes on top my roof  
Mocking Bird singing his song  
Well Mocking Bird mocking me  
Now that youre gone  
  
Mocking Bird high in a tree  
Looking up at you youre looking down at me  
Mocking Bird high in a loof  
Well hes blowing notes on top my roof  
  
Mocking Bird high in a tree  
Looking up at you youre looking down at me  
Mocking Bird singing his song  
Well Mocking Bird mocking me  
Now that youre gone  
  
Throwed some papers tried to scare him away  
Just looked down at me and this is what he said  
  
Mocking Bird high in a tree  
Looks like you got the best of me  
Mocking Bird singing his song  
Well Mocking Bird mocking me  
Now that youre gone
