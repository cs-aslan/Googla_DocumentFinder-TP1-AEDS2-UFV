Weve got beaches in mind  
Man its been too much time  
  
Woke me up before dawn  
Wish I could sleep some more so I could carry on  
With the dream Ive been meaning to make come true  
And thats to get away with you  
  
I think we all can agree  
That theres no better place for us to be  
We can drive on for miles till were finally free  
Itll just be you and me  
  
Weve got beaches in mind  
Man its been too much time  
Not a care in the world is where I want to be  
  
South Bay surfing again  
Havent been this way in I dont know when  
If I have my say well be back again  
Where the good times never end  
  
Weve got beaches in mind  
Man its been too much time  
Not a care in the world is where I wanna be  
With the surfers sand and the sea  
  
Well find a place in the sun  
Where everyone can have fun  
  
Beaches in mind  
Man its been too much time  
Not a care in the world is where I want to be  
With the surfers sand and the sea  
  
Weve got beaches in mind  
Man its been too much time  
Not a care in the world is where I want to be  
Beaches in mind
