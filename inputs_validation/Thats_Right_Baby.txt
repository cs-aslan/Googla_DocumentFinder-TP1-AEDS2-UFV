Thats right baby  
It seems to me youve won  
Slip tight baby  
You had a lot of fun  
  
You tried to make a fool of me  
And Im the fool who just couldnt see  
  
Thats right baby  
Laugh until you cry  
Good night baby  
But may I ask you why  
  
I gave you everything I had  
Babe that couldnt be so bad  
  
I wonder why theres no tear in your eye  
I wonder why theres love left for me  
  
Thats right baby  
Get it while you can  
Look right baby  
Youll see with another man  
  
While youre waiting all alone  
Youll try to call but I wont be home
