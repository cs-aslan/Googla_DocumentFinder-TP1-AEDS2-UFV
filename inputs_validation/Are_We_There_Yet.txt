They say that home is where the heart is  
I guess I havent found my home  
And we keep driving round in circles  
Afraid to call this place our own  
  
And are we there yet  
  
They say theres linings made of silver  
Folded inside each raining cloud  
Well we need someone to deliver  
Our silver lining now  
  
And are we there yet  
And are we there yet  
And are we there yet  
Home home home  
Home home home  
  
They say youre really not somebody  
Until somebody else loves you  
Well I am waiting to make somebody  
Somebody soon  
  
And are we there yet  
And are we there yet  
And are we there yet  
Home home home  
Home home home  
  
Where you will lie on the rug  
While I play with the dog  
And it wont be too much  
Cause this is too much  
Cause this is too much for me to hold  
This is too much for me to hold  
  
Home home home  
And are we there yet  
And are we there yet  
And are we there yet  
  
Home home home  
Home home home home  
  
And are we there yet  
And are we there yet  
And are we there yet  
And are we there
