I dont practice Santeria I aint got no crystal ball  
I had a million dollars but Id Id spend it all  
I could find that Heina and that Sancho that shes found  
Id pop a cap in Sancho and Id slap her down  
  
All I really want to know  
I already know  
All I really want to say  
I cant define  
Its love that I need  
But my soul will have to wait till I get back and find  
Heina of my own  
Daddys gonna love one and all  
I feel the break feel the break feel the break and I got to live it out oh
yeah  
  
I swear that I all really want to know  
All I really want to say is I got mine and I make it  
That love make it go my soul will have to  
  
What I really want to say ah baby  
What I really want to say is Ive got mine  
And Ill make it yes Im going up  
Tell Sanchito that if he knows what is good for him  
He best go run and hide  
Daddys got a new 45  
And I wont think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sanchos throat  
Believe me when I say that I got somethin for his punk ass  
  
What I really want know ah baby  
What I really want to say is theres just one way back  
And Ill make it yeah my soul will have to wait
