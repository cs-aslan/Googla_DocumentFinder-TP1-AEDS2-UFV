When you check in the cheatin hotel youll be back  
For another spin at the wheel and a race at the track  
Theyre off and runnin down at the bar  
This is Heather  This is John  
Theyre all down at the cheatin hotel lookin for fun  
  
Yea Im the bartender in here and its quite a scene  
The women get dressed to kill and slip off their rings  
Their husbands meet them an hour later  
Shell have friends all around the table  
And introduce the old man as one of her latest flings  
  
Then they go out on the dance floor  
Now theres a new man to sway for  
And touch and talk and sip some more red wine  
Then the slow dances get much closer  
And nows the time for low words  
That guy there with your wifes my husband but its OK  
  
Then I watch all of them leave  
Then they share a stare and a squeeze  
Now I dont know if its wrong or right  
Im sure it feels good at the time  
But if you keep on playin this game youll lose your mind  
  
Cause theyre thinkin about him or her  
Then they feel like a piece of dirt  
Its time to check out of the cheatin hotel and go home for good  
  
We get quite a few attractive lonely wives  
They come in the bar together about six fortyfive  
And sit down and say with their eyes  
My friend and I are lookin for a good time  
It dont take long to find a couple of guys at the cheatin hotel  
  
And then they go out on the dance floor  
Now they got a new man to sway for  
And touch and talk and sip some more red wine  
Then the slow dances get much closer  
And now they whisper low words  
Are you married why yes I am but thats OK  
  
And they know its really not look at all the trouble they got  
If you check in the cheatin hotel  
Somebody somewheres gonna tell  
And youll be in the room from hell and you cant get away  
  
The light blinks on and off  
Bartender last round for us all  
Oh they had a mighty hard fall down here at the cheatin hotel
