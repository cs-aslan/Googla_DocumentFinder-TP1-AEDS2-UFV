When the dancehall jus ram some people call it confinement  
But if youre with your woman or your man its pure excitement  
When you see the girls groove they get right in the mood for loving  
And if the weedman in the place theres no time for pushing and shoving  
  
You see the DJ on the scene he knows just what you mean about rubbing  
And when youre feeling alright hes right out of sight while hes dubbing  
  
Well the dancehall jus ram so you see were dealing with pure niceness  
And the music so loud that to shout above it youd be left voiceless  
  
The music so right  
We could have danced all night  
The feeling so nice  
Operator play it twice  
  
They have the reggae and soul and the ital vital dub plate riddims  
They have revival 45 calypso soca and all kinda riddim  
  
You see the busy barman in the dance hes used to dealing under nuff pressure  
And after youve had your drink youre gonna need another refresher  
  
Everybody in the dance just grooving looking laughing and smiling you see  
So if youre feeling irie little darling come and have a dance over by me
