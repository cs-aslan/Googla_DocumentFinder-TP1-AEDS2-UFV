Feeling alone but we are here  
Paying the toll for our little world  
Days like these seem to take some time  
When theyre over you will find  
  
Wait for you see you through  
Its what weve known all this time  
Were taking you to break their rules  
Its what weve done all the while  
  
Put you in this place to change your mind  
Take away things that were your life  
After theyve made their example of you  
Their fun is over and you are through  
  
Wait for you see you through  
Its what weve known all this time  
Were taking you to break their rules  
Its what weve done all the while  
  
Feeling alone but we are here  
Paying the toll for our little world  
Days like these seem to take some time  
When theyre over you will be fine
