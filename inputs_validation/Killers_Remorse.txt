Chorus  
Im sorry I met you  
Im sorry I hurt you  
Im sorry I killed you  
Im sorry I murked you  
Because Im all alone now nobody is with me  
Nobody to threaten that they about come get me  
I wish I could go back to where we began  
I wish you was alive so I could kill you again  
I wish we had more paths to cross  
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss  
My killers remorse  
  
For me we are the same should be laughed at  
Could be the very fame shit to get your bitch ass clacked  
You fell slick next now drowning in your own pool out back  
I kick the cats and dog tube the shit I dont count that  
Youre my angel of death I strangle till theres no breath  
I kill the kill kill till there aint nobody left  
My conscience dont inhibit me I kill deliberately  
Just wanna be like God cause God kills indiscriminately  
Im so christian Im so muslim  
Super size on your mom trigger get push up  
Im parallel to hell Im ready so Satan whats cooking  
And rappers running their mouth they dont know how close their bitch ass is
coked  
To get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you  
Dont get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off  
I said memories fade just as blood washes off  
Hope to see you soon  
  
Chorus  
  
I feel so guilty my hands are filthy  
From decorating your face all over the building  
Im staying sincere if I aint making it clear  
Im writing on the wall with the blood man I wished you were here  
But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam  
I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be clam  
I will tell em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all cest la vie  
We smoked you like the weed in the bong  
  
Have you ever seen the bloodstain  
And know that person has returned from every once came  
Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain  
But it aint gonna change a fucking thing  
Whats done is done chop that shit up to the game  
Youre still dead when Im still alive  
And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi  
  
Chorus  
  
Started the bullshit escalated to violence  
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence  
Now I feel empty not even existing  
My worst enemy is no longer against me  
I remember the hatred and how it consumed me  
And you felt the same thing but never could move me  
A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies  
The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving  
So I should rejoice now because you are past tense  
The last of my enemies the last of you bastards  
The dirt on your casket  
Im so alone now you were the reason to carry my danger my chrome out  
And I just sold out and wait for the contact  
And life for the combat and now we be on that  
And Id take it all back if I knew what I knew now  
Whats a shooter without somebody to shoot down  
  
Chorus
