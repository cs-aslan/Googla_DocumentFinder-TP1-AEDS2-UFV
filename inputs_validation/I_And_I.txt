Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed  
Look how sweet she sleeps how free must be her dreams  
In another lifetime she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed  
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams  
  
I and I  
In creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other no man sees my face and lives  
  
Think Ill go out and go for a walk  
Not much happening here nothing ever does  
Besides if she wakes up now shell just want to talk  
I got nothing to say specially about whatever it was  
  
I and I  
In creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other no man see my face and lives  
  
Took an untrodden path once where the swift dont win the race  
It goes to the worthy who can divide the word of truth  
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justices beautiful face  
And see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth  
  
I and I  
In creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other no man sees my face and lives  
  
Outside of two men on a train platform theres nothing in sight  
Theyre waiting for spring to come smoking down the trck  
The world could come to an end tonight bt thats all right  
She could still be there sleeping when I get back  
  
I and I  
In creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other no man sees my face and lives  
  
Noontime and Im still pushing myself along the road the darkest part  
Into the narrow lanes I cant stumble or stay put  
Someone else is speaking with my mouth but Im listening with my heart  
Ive made shoes for everyone even you while I go barefoot  
  
I and I  
In creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other no man sees my face and lives
