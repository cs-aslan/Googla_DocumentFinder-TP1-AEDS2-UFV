Bang goes another kanga  
On the bonnet of the van  
See the light ram through the gaps in the land  
Many an Aborigines mistaken for a tree  
Til you near him on the motorway  
And the tree begin to breathe  
See the light ram through the gaps in the land  
  
Hahahahahaha  
  
Coming in with the golden light  
In the morning  
Coming in with the golden light  
Is the New Man  
Coming in with the golden light  
Is my dented van

The civilized keep alive  
The territorial war  
See the light ram through the gaps in the land  
Erase the race that claim the place  
And say we dig for ore  
Or dangle devils in a bottle  
And push them from the Pull of the Bush  
See the light ram through the gaps in the land  
You find them in the road  
See the light bounce off the rocks to the sand  
In the road  
  
Coming in with the golden light  
In the morning  
Coming in with the golden light  
With no warning  
Coming in with the golden light  
We bring in the rigging  
Dig dig dig dig away  
  
Dreeeeeeeeee  
Aaaaa  
Mmmmm
