I cant believe  
That youre gone and were alone  
I cant believe  
That well never see your face  
  
I cant believe  
That youre at the gates of Heaven  
I cant believe  
That well never know you  
  
If only if only  
Miracles happened every day  
If only if only  
I could believe in something  
  
Helpless we cried over you  
Empty and lost over you  
  
How in the world  
Can they say that youre at peace  
How in the world  
Can they say that time will heal us  
  
How in the world  
Can we hope to be forgiven  
How in the world  
Can we know how we feel  
  
If only if only  
We could all live forever  
If only if only  
No memories to remember  
  
Words were not spoken for you  
No grave marks our love for you  
Broken our hearts call for you  
Noone can blame us but you  
  
How in the world can we ever smile again  
How in the world can we live without you
