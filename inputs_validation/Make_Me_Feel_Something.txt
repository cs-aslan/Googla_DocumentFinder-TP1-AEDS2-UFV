Make me feel something  
I used to feel  
I used to feel something for you  
But Ive been sleep walking  
Stumbling in false starts fumbling into false hearts  
Tumbling into false hearts mainly mine  
  
Make me feel something  
Feel something  
Can it be Im growing old  
Feel something  
Maybe Im just too controlled  
Feel something  
Im much too young to feel this old  
  
make me walk on air  
I used to dare  
I used to take chances for you  
But now Im longing to feel passion  
Cause Ive only been pretending  
Acting out the drama  
Dying for a happy end  
Just to feel alive  
  
I dont want to say I love you  
To one more fantasy  
Youd never believe  
What a good actress I could be  
  
Remember when  
We were fresh in love  
Your eyes were pale like the moon  
Wed sit on the porch in Summer  
Listen to the breezes  
Spinning melodies  
I dressed you up like a god  
The one you were
