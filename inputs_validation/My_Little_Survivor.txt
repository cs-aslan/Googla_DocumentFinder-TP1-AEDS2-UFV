Youre my little saviour  
Youre the one I sleep with at night  
You take me in and promise me Ill be alright  
Youre my little angel down from the heaven above  
I cant ask for much anymore  
But you still smile and give me your love  
So if you fall asleep tomorrow  
Then I know we can make it through this night  
But if you fall asleep as I hold you tight  
Youll have moved on  
Your love will be gone  
  
Youre my little saviour  
Hold me close and stare up into the stars  
Let me know if you think that theres someone up there  
Who still believes in us  
After Ive lost all their trust  
Just need someone to believe us  
So please just fall asleep tomorrow  
Cause sugar I know we can make it through the night  
Cause if you fall asleep as I hold you tight  
Youll have moved on your love will be gone  
You were my little saviour  
I was supposed to hold you through the night  
But I guess I let you down inside  
Youre my little saviour  
I loved you
