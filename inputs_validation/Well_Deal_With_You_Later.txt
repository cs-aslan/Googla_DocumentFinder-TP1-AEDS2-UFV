Revolutions come and go but well just have to wait  
The time is nigh to sit and plot exactly who you hate  
  
Sirens in the neighbourhood  
The gun must be misunderstood  
A warden in a pool of blood  
The palace laugh and so they should  
  
Across the world in every coup a thousand guns without a clue  
If only all the people knew theyve got their sight set up on you  
  
Every war is always cursed  
With just who do you shoot at first  
Think real hard and think Sandhurst  
Take an officer hes the worst  
  
Governments will rise and fall but royaltys still there  
Dont worry if its Queen or Duke try scything down the pair  
And if you class the palace staff as devils advocator  
Just put them in an incubator and well deal with them later  
  
Just a little bit later  
  
Well deal with you later  
  
Just put them in an incubator and well deal with them later  
Just throw them to the alligators and well deal with them later  
  
So be wary of the liquidator  
cause well deal with you later  
Just put them in a liquidator  
And well deal with you later  
  
Well deal with you later
