I was the boy unwanted a prisoner Im born to them  
My brother was the one that couldnt do no wrong  
And I was there dying in the shadow of him  
  
Red crimson red am I the invisible boy  
Feel the strap cross my back  
Yeah Im the new whipping boy  
  
Chorus  
Who am I  the orphan son you would never need  
Who am I  cause Im the boy only the mirror sees  
Who am I  the slave you gave just the air I breathe  
Who am I  cause Im the boy only the mirror sees  
  
Oh I got the same old reruns horror movies in my head  
And I cant rest the scare me to death  
But if Im not alive how can I be dead  
  
Red crimson red am I the invisible boy  
Feel the strap cross my back  
Yeah Im the new whipping boy  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh why me  
  
Why him  
  
Can you tell me  
  
Its confession again  
Come talk to me I see in your eyes  
Titanic misery ashamed that youre alive  
Im the face that you see  
When the face isnt yours  
Im the mirror my boy  
  
Chorus  
  
Some people never go crazy  
What truly boring lives they must lead  
Is there no love to shelter me  
Only love love sets me free
