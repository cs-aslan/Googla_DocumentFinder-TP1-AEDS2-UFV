Yeah today the big day  
Xzibit  
Been here four years eleven months and twentynine hot ones  
One more day and Im a free man walkin  
Leavin from behind these gates I paid my debt to the state  
And ever since they took the weights  
Wasnt much for a nigga to do but start thinkin  
Wishin I was back home drinkin every weekend  
Remember like its yesterday eightteen and   
I cant remember the letters I just wrote a lot of them  
Goin for a ride that I cannot stop  
Set up shop in Cochran connect the dots  
And for those that dont know thats the PenEast to Fresno  
Northeast to Baskersfield fuck Lets Make a Deal  
Livin around niggaz who kill right along with the niggaz who will  
At the drop of a hat sharpen up anything hard to stab you with that  
Niggaz givin up the manhood they cant get back  
Its a sick university murder the cirriculum  
Concrete campuses I miss Los Angeles  
More than that Im missin my kids  
Missin my turf missin my bitch what could be worse  
Shouldnt have asked that called the bitch collect Its Xzibit  
Some nigga picked up wanted to break her neck  
When kites slide up under your door you slide them back  
Cause when you pick em up and read em thats where youre at  
And if you aint rollin with that then watch your back  
Level four right away gettin hit the same day  
Playin the price for the games you play  
Never realize how precious time is til you give it away  
Cant remember what a tbone taste like  
I stayed awake nights listening to the sounds of prison life  
Motherfuckers cryin shanks gettin sharpened  
Tacs gettin taced up plottin and talkin  
Sellin everything from weed to blow  
When its time for you to go youre the last to know  
niggaz holdin weight essays got the power  
Locked down one shower every seventytwo hours  
 tuna trigger happy sharpshooters  
Waitin for the jump off cant wait to thump off  
Had to smash a nigga readin my shit  
Tryin to intercept my outside and write my bitch  
I seen niggaz sleep for weeks get too weak  
And then physically and mentally cannot compete  
Find new shit to master make the time move faster  
Home sweet home shipped off to Land Caster  
Kept a low pro close to home and Im trippin  
Time to catch up with all the shit that I been missin  
Everybody runnin they mouth pussy to count  
Cause bitches in Cali love niggaz thats freshed out  
But some of these niggaz on swipe  
Gettin out with the virus caught from the nigga he liked  
Fuck that when I touch back I got plans  
If I cant rock the powder rock the fans  
Give my naked pictures away shake some hands  
Hope I never seen none of you motherfuckers again  
On all times take the long walk to the front gate  
Dress out expandin shit today my release date  
  
Talking  
X Alright my niggaz Im gone see you in an ounce dog woo  
G Whats up nigga  
X Yeah whats up nigga  
G Hey get in the car my nigga sup X  
Here goes ya motherfuckin chain nigga  
Lucky I didnt pawn that motherfucker  
X Ha yeah right

That shit was all on the radio  
But dig it I got two strippin bitches  
just flew in from motherfuckin Las Vegas  
ready to get down and dirty I got a pound of weed got on the Hennessy  
Everybody at the club waitin what you want to do  
X Take me to the motherfuckin studio
