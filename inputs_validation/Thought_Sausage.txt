Thought sausage fallen through your head  
Bits and pieces hanging in the shed  
Churnin out links on the other side  
Cut em up again and stir it in the sauce stir it in the sauce  
  
Mamas gumbo silky fine  
Papas birthday takin up time  
Tight little secret from my mamas side  
Use a little secret and stir it in the sauce stir it in the sauce stir it  
  
Mama said back out the kitchen til Im good and ready  
Stuff aint ready yet  
  
Mamas gumbo bubblin time  
Aw little baby sittin to the side  
Matter of the spatter just makin him cry  
Swipe a little drop of it and stir it in the sauce stir it in the sauce  
  
Thought sausage smokin in the shed  
Tickle in the kitchen just losin that head  
Laughin out loud at supper time  
One more taste and stir it in the sauce stir it in the sauce stir it  
  
Mama said get out the kitchen daddy til Im good and ready  
This stuff aint ready yet  
  
Mama said get out the kitchen daddy til Im good and ready  
Just come and get it  
  
Mama said come on in this kitchen daddy cause Im good and ready  
Come on and get it
