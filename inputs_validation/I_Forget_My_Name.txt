Turn me on to something  
I dont want to be alone  
My heart is like a stone and its sinking  
  
Stay with me I didnt mean to hurt you  
Dont you know  
I didnt get where I am with much thinking  
  
And Im not sentimental  
But I know where I belong  
  
Come out and fight  
For love and life  
Tell me things til I forget my name  
  
Speak your mind  
And learn your lines  
Tell me things til I forget my name  
  
The say that if you hate yourself  
You like yourself enough  
You like yourself enough to be a hater  
  
But you cant get enough  
Of all that unrequited stuff  
So open up to love and see whats there  
  
And Im not much of anything  
But know where I belong  
  
Come out and fight  
For love and life  
Tell me things til I forget my name  
  
Sing your life  
And learn your lines  
Tell me things til I forget my name  
  
Is this the best that we can do for one another  
Asking the questions thinking of another  
When you better come out fighting for your life  
  
Come out and fight  
For love and life  
Tell me things til I forget my name  
  
Speak your mind  
Sing your lines  
Tell me things til I forget my name
