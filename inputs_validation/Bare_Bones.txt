I hear someone calling me  
Where they call from I can see no light  
Walk through fire  
To me now  
And the fire I cant feel  
  
Bare bones  
I have walked through hell  
Now Im back  
Stripped to the bone  
I have been to hell  
Now Im here an Im taking all I need  
Bare bones  
  
Obstacles are in my way  
Just beyond them lies what I dont know  
Walk through blind  
Know Im here  
There is nothing I cant see  
  
Bare bones  
I have been to hell  
Now Im back  
Stripped to the bone  
I have been to hell  
  
Now Im back an Im taking all I need  
Bare bones  
  
Open my eyes to what I need to see  
Am I you or am I becoming me  
Life from day to day  
Turn another page  
Christened in the rain  
That turns to rage  
  
Washed of animosity  
Naked truth falling black or white  
You are turning  
To the light  
There is nothing I cant be  
  
An Im back an Im taking all I want  
Bare bones
