Sometimes Im in the mood I wanna leave my lonesome home  
And sometimes Im in the mood I wanna hear my milk cow moan  
And sometimes Im in the mood I wanna hit the highway road  
But then again but then again I said oh I said oh I said  
Oh babe Im in the mood for you  
  
Sometimes Im in the mood Lord I had my overflowin fill  
Sometimes Im in the mood Im gonna make out my final will  
Sometimes Im in the mood Im gonna head for the walkin hill  
But then again but then again I said oh I said oh I said  
Oh babe Im in the mood for you  
  
Sometimes Im in the mood I wanna lay right down and die  
Sometimes Im in the mood I wanna climb up to the sky  
Sometimes Im in the mood Im gonna laugh until I cry  
But then again I said again I said again I said  
Oh babe Im in the mood for you  
  
Sometimes Im in the mood Im gonna sleep in my ponys stall  
Sometimes Im in the mood I aint gonna do nothin at all  
Sometimes Im in the mood I wanna fly like a cannon ball  
But then again but then again I said oh I said oh I said  
Oh babe Im in the mood for you  
  
Sometimes Im in the mood I wanna back up against the wall  
Sometimes Im in the mood I wanna run till I have to crawl  
Sometimes Im in the mood I aint gonna do nothin at all  
But then again but then again I said oh I said oh I said  
Oh babe Im in the mood for you  
  
Sometimes Im in the mood I wanna change my house around  
Sometimes Im in the mood Im gonna make a change in this here town  
Sometimes Im in the mood Im gonna change the world around  
But then again but then again I said oh I said oh I said  
Oh babe Im in the mood for you
