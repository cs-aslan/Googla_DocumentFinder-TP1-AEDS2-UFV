Ohh ohh  
  
Pull up at the valet  
We cant help but be seen girl  
Come take a picture with me baby  
Lets make the cover of somebody magazine  
Cause everybodys looking at her  
Something bout the way we meet the door  
We catch eyes as we walk by  
We demand attention  
And theres something about the way we take the floor  
Effortless flight  
Thats when I lean in close to mention girl  
  
Maybe its you  
Maybe its me  
And for whatever reason
