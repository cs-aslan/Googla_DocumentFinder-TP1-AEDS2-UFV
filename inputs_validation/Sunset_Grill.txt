Lets go down to the Sunset Grill  
We can watch the working girls go by  
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble  
And stare out at the auburn sky  
Theres an old man there from the old world  
To him its all the same  
Calls all his customers by name  
  
Chorus  
Down at the Sunset Grill  
Down at the Sunset Grill  
Down at the Sunset Grill  
Down at the Sunset Grill  
  
You see a lot more meanness in the city  
Its the kind that eats you up inside  
Hard to come away with anything that feels like dignity  
Hard to get home with any pride  
These days a man makes you somethin  
And you never see his face  
But there is no hiding place  
  
Chorus  
  
Respectable little murders pay  
They get more respectable every day  
Dont worry girl Im gonna stick by you  
And someday soon were gonna get in that  
Car and get outta here  
  
Lets go down to the Sunset Grill  
Watch the working girls go by  
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble  
Gaze out at the auburn sky  
Maybe well leave come springtime  
Meanwhile have another beer  
What would we do without all these jerks anyway  
And besides all our friends are here  
  
Chorus
