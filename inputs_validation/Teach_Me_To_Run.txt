If Ive got to run instead of feeling proud  
If Ive got to find you in a big wide crowd  
No doubt the country side is waiting for me  
There aint no answer to what I say  
  
Now that Ive found my soul Im free  
Back to the highway thats calling me  
There must be reasons why Ive got to hide  
There aint no answer to what I say  
  
  
Im standing alone my moneys all gone  
So throw me a gun and teach me to run  
Im standing alone my moneys all gone  
So throw me a gun and teach me to run  
  
  
Here I stand Im a wanted man  
Living in the shadows wherever I can  
There must be reasons why Ive got to hide  
There aint no answer to what I say
