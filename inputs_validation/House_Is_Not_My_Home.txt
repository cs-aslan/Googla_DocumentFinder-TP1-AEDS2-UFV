Well Im tired so tired of getting up and wasting another day  
I wish the picture on the wall would still say it all  
But now yesterday is so far away  
And I would give anything say anything  
  
To keep it all like it was  
But you just throw it all away  
And I think this house is not my home  
I think that Id rather be alone tonight  
Im trying trying to fake it  
  
Im tired so tired of giving up and taking all the blame  
I wish the shouting and the fights would stop for the night  
Cant close my eyes and make them all go away  
And I would give anything say anything  
To keep it all like it was  
But you just throw it all away  
  
Chorus  
  
This is the part where you say  
You cant stay together just for me  
This is the part where you make me choose  
On whose side I want to be  
This is the part where you decide  
Whats going to be best for me  
This is the start  
Now we grow apart  
Now we grow apart  
  
Chorus
