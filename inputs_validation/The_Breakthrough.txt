Knuckleheads spreadin gossip all over town  
Every time I drive by youre just standin around  
Hundredbottles in your pocket fortydog in your hand  
Dont you know youre just a worker and your boss is my man  
LL this LL that soon as I walk in the place  
I want to take my gun and shoot you in your muthafuckin face  
Youre playin me too close with the schemin and games  
I guess the beef and the bullshit is the price of fame  
Movies records goin on tour  
Twentythousand people hiphoppin on the floor  
Whole parties bodyrockin and everythings chill  
Get back to New York and the suckers act ill  
See I fought with the devil made a promise to God  
I have experience in goin all the way to the top  
Its harder harder than hard  
All the suckers are barred  
You used to try to talk down now your ego is scarred  
See the problem is you want what another man has  
His car his wife or his razzamatazz  
But thats weak you gotta do work on your own  
Cause when youre rich you got friends  
But when youre poor youre alone  
So get your own on your own itll strengthen your soul  
Stop livin off your parents like youre three years old  
Instead of walkin like youre limp and talkin yang about me  
Why dont you take your monkeyass and get a college degree  
Or write a rhyme and ride a bike and try to live carefree  
Hope my message reaches you before youre seventythree  
A old man when people ask you what you did with your life  
Youll say I hated LL and I carried a big knife  
Every day is a chase every day is a race  
And every day youre being overpowered by my bass  
Too much juice to be a deuce I had to be a ace  
Its like the fires in my eyes and the guns in my face  
Im stompin stupid knuckleheads until they bleed  
Im the leader of the show so its up to me to lead  
Ima lead you away from drugs and petty crime  
Lead you away from wack beats and rhyme  
Lead you to that ticket line  
So you can come in my show and watch the stars shine  
Get busy not dizzy want to teach the young  
The last man who didnt listen ended up gettin hung  
Not that I killed him its just  
He didnt want to trust  
The words of a master thats why you must  
Take heed to the speech its gonna reach your ear  
Dont try to say you cant hear cause the words are clear  
Throwin flurries punks scurry and I bury the rest  
You better hurry up and rock a rhyme and give it your best  
Cause tonights the night we gonna see the big fight  
Twelvegauge on the stage in case it dont go right  
ELove drives a tank hes strong like a truck  
If youre cryin while youre dyin we aint givin a fuck  
LL Cool J is on the microphone  
Tellin all you punk ducks Leave me the hell alone  
Cause Im rated X born to snap necks  
Straight up and down no special effects  
Im the professor the teacher the hiphop dean  
If Russia bombed the US theyd be scared to touch Queens  
Cause thats where I live and this is what I give  
Turnin topnotch crews into fugitives  
They run they frightened they hide from King Titan  
Like a sniper when hes shootin or a viper when hes bitin  
Here I am tellin the truth  
And Im spreadin the word to my fellow youth  
It goes mantoman and jamtojam  
I got hiphop rock and love song fans  
All you petty MCs in the state of New York  
Gettin a thousand for a show but you still want to squawk  
Cant get a decent contract your beats aint workin  
Doggedout Pumas plus youre managers jerkin  
Your mic sounds weak remember that sieezer  
Im badder than Napoleon Hitler or Caesar  
Im a hit man but Im not for hire  
Fly girls desire the man you admire  
Not only on the stage I rock in the park  
And Im a killer in the daytime and worse after dark  
So dont never ever mess with the king of the sound  
LL Cool J the baddest around
