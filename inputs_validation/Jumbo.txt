Jumbo said to say goodnight  
See you in the morning  
Please dont lose your appetite  
He knows who is yawning  
tomorrow you can climb a moutain  
Sail a sailboat trough a fountain  
  
Jumbo said he say goodnight  
Play no games  hed say to me  
We know who is wrong  
So please dont make no hesitation  
There will be no recriation  
  
Jumbo said to say goodnight  
Hes a friend of yours  
Listen you can chew it  
If its loud enough you can hear it  
  
Cause its narrow as a sparrow  
And it shoots a bow and arrow  
Throa top thats made with  
Powder with a gun its even louder  
  
And its shattering to hear  
Yuo mustnt listen with your ear  
But it gets to you  
Yes  yes  yes  yes  yes  yes
