Dolly Parton  
My dear hard workin daddy works his life away for us  
Thats the way that daddy shows to us his love  
And Daddys two hard working hands  
Theyre callous and theyre sore  
And Daddys workin boots have walked a million miles or more  
As long as I remember I remember Daddy workin  
Workin on the job or either on the farm  
Tryin to provide for the family that he loves  
And Daddys working boots have taken many steps for us  
Chorus  
Daddys workin boots have served as his foundation  
Though just like him theyre tired and worn  
For years theyve helped him stand  
Daddys working boots have filled their obligation  
Theyve walked that rocky road with a mighty mighty man  
Dear lord above I know up there my Daddys got a mansion  
And a great reward thats long been overdue  
And when it comes my Daddys time to be with you in heaven  
Spoken  
Wont cha let him walk your golden streets  
In a pair of brand new golden boots  
Repeat Chorus  
Daddys workin boots
