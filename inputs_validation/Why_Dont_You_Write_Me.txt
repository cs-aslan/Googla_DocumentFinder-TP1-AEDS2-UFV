Why dont you write me  
Im out in the jungle  
Im hungry to hear you  
Send me a card  
  
I am waiting so hard  
To be near you  
La la la  
Why dont you write  
  
Something is wrong  
And I know I got to be there  
Maybe Im lost  
But I cant make the cost  
  
Of the airfare  
Tell me why  
Why  
Why  
  
Tell me why  
Why  
Why  
  
Why dont you write me  
A letter would brighten  
My loneliest evening  
Mail it today  
  
If its only to say  
That youre leaving me  
La la la  
  
Monday morning sitting in the sun  
Hoping and wishing for the mail to come  
Tuesday never got a word  
Wednesday Thursday aint no sign  
  
Drank a half a bottle of iodine  
Friday woe is me  
Gonna hang my body from the highest tree  
Why dont you write me
