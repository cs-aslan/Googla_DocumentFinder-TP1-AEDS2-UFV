Didnt I see you down in San Antone  
On a hot and dusty night  
We were eating eggs in Sammys  
When the black man there drew his knife  
Aw you drowned that Jew in Rampton  
As he washed his sleeveless shirt  
You know that Spanishspeaking gentlemen  
The one we all called Kurt  
Come now gentleman  
I know theres some mistake  
How forgetful Im becoming  
Now you fixed your business straight  
I remember you in Hemlock Road  
In nineteen fiftysix  
Youre a faggy little leather boy  
With a smaller piece of stick  
Youre a lashing smashing hunk of man  
Your sweat shines sweet and strong  
Your organs working perfectly  
But theres a part thats not screwed on  
Werent you at the Coke convention  
Back on nineteen sixtyfive  
Youre the misbred gray executive  
Ive seen heavily advertised  
Youre the great gray man whose daughter licks  
Policemens buttons clean  
Youre the man who squats behind the man  
Who works the soft machine  
Come now gentleman  
Your love is all I crave  
Youll still be in the circus when Im laughing  
Laughing in my grave  
When the old men do the fighting  
And the young men all look on  
And the young girls eat their mothers meat  
From tubes of plasticon  
Be wary of these my gentle friends  
Of all the skins you breed  
They have a tasty habit  
They eat the hands that bleed  
So remember who you say you are  
And keep your noses clean  
Boys will be boys and play with toys  
So be strong with your beast  
Oh Rosie dear dontcha think its queer  
So stop me if you please  
The baby is dead my lady said  
You gentlemen why you all work for me
