You know what  
Everybody goes through some changes in life  
Some people change for the better some poeple change for the worse  
But umm some people need to make that change  
You know what I mean Change is good sometimes You know  
  
Why would I change I aint never slide down a bad pole  
Even though Im certified over plats sold  
They say Im different cause I ride in a plat Rolls  
But every time we gotta ride dont this cat roll  
I never snitch and go and hide in a rat hole  
And I aint givin you nothing besides what this gat hold  
No pride I aint that old  
Cut off a few but kept a few girls I decide like Im   
It probably dont seem like a struggle  
But I used to dream that this thugll balance beams just to smuggle  
Its funny same girls that didnt seem like theyd love you  
Is begginfor your autographs ands screamin to hug you  
Its crazy same dudes that seem like they thug you  
Is prayin on your downfall schemin to mug you  
And people that didnt give a fuck is dreamin to bug you  
And goin through extremes just to plug you who really changed  
  
Chorus  
This game aint change me so dont let it change you  
If youve been real with me Im still real with you  
If you got love for me I still got love for you  
If you down for me then Im still down for you  
If you dont fuck with me then I dont fuck with you  
If you aint cool with me then I aint cool with you  
If you wont ride with me then I wont ride for you  
This game aint change me dont let it change you  
  
Verse 2  
Why would I change I didnt step out of Supermans phone booth  
To remind where Im from I look at my own tooth  
Im speakin the known truth  
I aint been living the same since I moved under Silvia Rones roof  
Why would I feel like Im a stranger  
And why should I feel like Im in danger  
And Im grindin till Im right  
Whether its on the streets or online tryna climb sites  
I aint blind from the limelite  
I had my mind and my rhymes right and signed when the times right  
People shouldnt be hateful they should be grateful  
But fuck it I guess I gotta keep my three eight full  
Im playin the game like Im supposed  
Stayin the same like Im supposed  
Ghetto Fab in da house hip hop hustler  
One million customers and I still bust at ya  
  
Chorus  
  
Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk  
Ive chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks  
Known a few  and met a few locs  
Made a few comments and said a few jokes  
But its gettin me sick someone prescribe me some medicine  
Before the fame the vibe was way better then  
Some have even became rivals instead of friends  
Only two become liable for settlements  
I grew up watchin the  
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin the better Benz  
Thats why the clubs be deprivin to let us in  
They know the family bring knives and barettas in  
Im thankful for being allowed fans for being the crowd  
How could my head be in the clouds  
Its strange what the famell do  
But you know what The only one who seen the change from the fame is you  
  
Chorus  
  
Im the same nigga man  
Same nigga that ridin with you  
Niggas thats fuckin with you  
Im still fuckin with you niggas  
The same nigga these hoes aint like  
Now they on my dick right Haha shit is crazy  
Dont let this game change you nigga
