A little white house  
Its everything weve  
Dreamed about  
I wanted you to know  
Im hanging up my ego  
We shouldnt have to fight  
Or worry about the bills tonight  
I wanted you to know  
I want to be your shadow  
The mysterys gone  
So bring back the sun  
Well bury this hate  
And build it with love  
The grass wasnt greener  
I found  
I wanted you to know  
I dug you up a rainbow  
I know I know I failed you  
I hope I hope we get to  
Sunny days again
