Mmm Dear I love you dearly but dont forget trouble I  
Used to find and it was in your mind yeah  
  
I got red blood and I got blood red wine  
Which I bring you when the snow is heavy on the ground  
If you say where go Ill just wrap my cloak around  
  
You say that every man you ever had  
Has been obsessed with you and I wanna prove an exception  
To the rule that you lay down  
Babe please dont make me cry cause theres a little pain inside  
Yes my darling now you cant expect me always to hide  
  
I got red blood and I got blood red wine  
Which I bring you when the snow lies heavy on the ground  
If you say well go whyow  
Let me let me wrap my coat around  
  
Yeah thats right  
You see that every time well the lines must rhyme  
And every verse be in the same old time  
Does it all have to rhyme  
But there go and thats a place that you will never  
You said to remind of the girl I used to know and used to love yeah  
  
I got red blood and I got blood red wine  
Which I bring you when the snow lies heavy on the ground  
If you get cold I oh wrap my coat coat around  
My my my my dont you stay on that that snowy ground
