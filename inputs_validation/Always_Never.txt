Theres colours inbetween us  
Oh but still it looks the same  
You stand here before me  
Waking me up with its wonderful pain  
The buzzers gone before us  
Then you wake up and your walking in circles  
Shaking the hand of bad habits again  
Again  
  
This is right now  
Trust me somehow  
Let it be just let it be  
Walk out the door  
  
Something better  
Always never  
Cause misery loves company  
You can be sure  
  
Youre looking in the mirror  
Oh your scratching off my skin  
You think I didnt notice  
The madness and torture is drawing me in  
The satalite is watching  
And then you come home  
And you switch on your sorrow  
Boil up a bad mood  
Shaking the hand of bad habits again  
Again  
  
This is right now  
Trust me somehow  
Let it be just let it be  
Walk out the door  
  
Something better  
Always never  
Cause misery loves company  
You can be sure  
  
Always never always never  
Let it be just let it be  
Walk out the door  
Always neveralways never  
Cause misery loves company  
You can be sure
