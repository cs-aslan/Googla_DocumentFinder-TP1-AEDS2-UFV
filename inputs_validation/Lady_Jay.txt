Hear me when I cry  
Listen to my song  
The jay my lovely lady  
To the earth she did belong  
I cant trace her  
Lost her from my life  
But the manor ladys bright young son  
Can take her for his wife  
Under the forest branches  
She came to me  
Until the day she cried aloud  
A father I should be  
That was the last time that we met  
I never saw her again  
For she took her life on princeton wharf  
To save my worthy name  
She found deaths open arms  
And lay in them in grace  
I watched as icy fingers  
Clawed her lovely face  
Now I stumble through the mist  
To where they laid her in the grave  
And maybe Ill remember  
The flowers for my days  
Far beyond the sand  
I will take your hand  
The spirit of our love will live forever  
Far beyond the clouds  
We will laugh aloud  
The spirit of our love will live again
