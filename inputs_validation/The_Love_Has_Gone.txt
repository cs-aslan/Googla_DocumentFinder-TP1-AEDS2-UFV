The love has gone  
The love has gone will we ever be the same  
The feelings wrong the joy has turned to pain  
  
Wake up beside you and hear you breathing  
And I can feel you in my arms  
No one can know just how Im feeling  
Knowing that our love can come to no harm  
  
But as I open my eyes  
Then I start to realize  
That youre gone and I cant go on  
  
The love has gone will we ever be the same  
The feelings wrong the joy has turned to pain  
The love is gone will we ever be the same  
The feelings wrong the joy has turned to pain  
  
What have I done girl to make you leave me  
Didnt I love you for all those years  
  
If you open your eyes  
Baby then youll realize  
That youre wrong and I cant go on  
You know I cant go on  
  
The love has gone will we ever be the same  
The feelings wrong the joy has turned to pain  
The love is gone will we ever be the same  
The feelings wrong the joy has turned to pain  
  
Nothing will ever come between us  
If you will just take me back once more  
Ill show you just how much I love you  
If youll just come walking through that door  
  
The love has gone will we ever be the same  
The feelings wrong the joy has turned to pain  
The love is gone will we ever be the same  
The feelings wrong the joy has turned to pain
