Because your not  
Supposed to be here  
I dont wanna love you  
Your somebody elses

She made it  
Perfectly clear  
She told me  
If I saw you tonight  
To tell you  
She forgives you  
And that she knows  
That we been together  
For about a year  
She said that she know  
That I love you  
But not like she does  
I think itd be best  
If you got your things  
And got out of here  
I gotta migrane

Come stop the pain

This love migrane  
My head dont hurt  
As much as my heart no  
Someone please

As much as my heart no

I wish youd of told me  
That you had a daughter

Liked to meet her

While were on the subject  
I want you to have it  
I guess you could have  
Mentioned the fact  
That you have a wife  
  
Someone please  
Come stop the pain  
I cant take  
This love migrane  
My head dont hurt  
As much as my heart no  
Someone please
