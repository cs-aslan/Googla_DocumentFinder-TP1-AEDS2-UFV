Ive been waiting for this moment secretly  
Counting every minute every hour till youre with me  
Cause I know just whats in store  
And now Im in your arms baby close the door  
  
Why waste another minute ooh lets get right to it  
Baby turn the lights down and we dont have to say a word  
Unspoken pleasure theres no way to measure  
How you make me feel when your near me and whisper softly  
So dont stop  
  
Chorus  
Its just the way you love me  
You know you drive me crazy  
Its just the way that you love  
You know you drive me crazy  
  
And it seems time flies whenever Im in your arms  
I like to savor every second you thrill me with your charm  
Now Im lost in the passion moment feelings magic we share  
And when I look into your eyes I know how much you care  
  
Dont want to rush the feeling couse loving yous so real and  
I like the way you set the mood with a little wine and candlelight  
Its more than emotion lets keep this fire going  
Now were lost inside our love now were drifting into love  
Sweet surrender is so tender  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh you know me oh so well  
You always take your time and you always get it right you know just what I
like  
Ooh you set my soul on fire and I know youve got my rhythm  
Cause then you take me higher  
  
Chorus x3  
  
Dont you stop stop the love you know youve the rhythm  
Dont you stop stop the love you know youve the rhythm
