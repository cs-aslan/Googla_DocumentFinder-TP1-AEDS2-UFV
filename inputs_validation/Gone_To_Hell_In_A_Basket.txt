I fished the everglades for a while  
Lookin through the darkness at those alligators eyes  
Three days in the sun boys ah it made me well  
But back in Nashville theyre just a givin me hell  
Singing hes gone to hell in a basket one of those hand woven caskets  
You got a deep question please dont ask it but Ive gone to hell in a basket  
Them air boat boys have got their nerve  
Right now theyre eatin all of em terrible preserves  
Singing my new song for a six pack of beer back in Music City this is all you
can hear  
Hes gone to hell in a basket  
Okefanokee aint so much they say the grass aint so tough  
These sawgrass neighbors know what lifes all about  
Meanwhile back in Nashville theyre still wearin me out  
With hes gone to hell in a basket  
What you say hes gone to hell in a basket  
Yeah I know hes gone to hell in a basket
