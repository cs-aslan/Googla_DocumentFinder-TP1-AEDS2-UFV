Its the return of the of the motherfuckin brainiacs  
Capitol homes represent East Atlanta where you at YING YANG  
We back motherfucker

The same to niggas that the hoes used to dis  
Now we ridin on the road doing shows with our clique  
Put a lock on my dick cause my brain is da key  
I aint wat you want so quit lyin to me  
See I was born by myself  
Imma die by myself  
And when I smoke my purple Im gon get high by myself  
And if aint Droc on the side of me  
We  bitch cant even buy from me  
They call me crip his name eric his the capper  
Since the 8th grade he said he would be a rapper  
Rapper yall niggas lost cause its 10 years later and shawty is throwed off  
One time for them niggas who keep claming they boss  
Keep thinkin we soft we gon knock youre fuckin block off  
See Droc known to be a people person  
And kaine really dont like discursion  
See pain is kinda what I like dispursin  
cause love make a nigga feel like a scrub

Some niggas like to lie just to hide the fact  
That they a bitch nigga snitch nigga all on another nigga dick nigga get
