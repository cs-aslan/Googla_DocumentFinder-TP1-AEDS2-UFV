I wont close my eyes  
To the sufferers plight  
In a world full of sadness  
I wont turn off my light  
  
Our cries for justice are shots in the dark  
But our strengths in our bite  
And not in our bark  
Its time to stand  
And shout it out loud  
And the louder we scream  
The sweeter the sound  
  
I wont close my eyes  
When I know that Im right  
When Im drowning in tears  
I wont turn off my light  
  
Were shown no respect  
But that cant break our pride  
When our backs to the wall  
We wont run and we wont hide  
Its time to stand face the oncoming crowd  
And the louder we scream  
The sweeter the sound  
  
I wont close my eyes  
When the future dont look bright  
Though the road seems too long  
I wont turn off my light  
In a world full of darkness  
I wont turn off my light
