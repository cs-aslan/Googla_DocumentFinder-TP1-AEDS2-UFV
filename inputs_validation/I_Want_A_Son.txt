I want a son  
  
I want a son  
Someone I can blame for turning grey  
To share my name to share my days  
To share the things Ive earned  
The lessons that Ive learned along the way  
Hed have a friend and wed have fun  
I love to laugh and I would love to have a son  
  
I want a girl  
Twirling round the room in pink and blue  
To count on me to see her through  
Whod worry when Im late  
And tell me that Im great when its not true  
Shed have a friend and wed have fun  
Id love a daughter just as I would love a son  
  
I wanna care  
I wanna wonder where they are  
I wanna see that they go farther than me  
And carry on the things I love when Im gone  
  
Forgetting me  
Id be good for them I really would  
Theyd have someone who understood  
Whod always be around  
And never let them down I never could  
  
Hed have a friend and wed have fun  
Shed have a friend wed all be one  
Id love to have a girl  
Or I would love to have a son
