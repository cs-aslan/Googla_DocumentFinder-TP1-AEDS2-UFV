Funny how time slips away  
Looking at the cracks creeping across my face  
I remember the little kid living in here  
Hell be living here probably until Im dead  
  
Please dont leave me baby  
Please dont leave me yet  
  
Sitting in a box away from the world out there  
A world piled high with boxes just like this  
But please dont ever leave me alone in here  
Take me out shake off the dust shake off the fear  
  
Please dont leave me baby  
Please dont leave me yet  
  
If you stay with me  
That dont mean we gotta stay the same  
If you stay with me  
Well baby you and me well change the game  
  
Well I dont know the man thats livin in my head  
til you reach down and bring the light back in  
No I dont know the man thats living in my head  
If I dont know the woman sleeping in my bed  
  
Remember how we used to kiss baby  
Kiss like it was everything  
Remember how we used to love baby  
Love like it was everything  
  
You stay with me  
That dont mean we have to stay the same  
If you stay with me  
Well baby you and me well change the game  
You stay with me  
Ill follow you and we can start again baby  
  
I only got a minute or two to spare  
And I gotta whole damn life to fit in there  
So why waste time staring at the TV set  
Like I got dreams to kill and people to forget  
  
Remember how we used to dance baby  
Just like it was everything  
  
You stay with me  
And that dont mean we have to stay the same  
You stay with me  
Baby you and me can make the change  
You stay with me  
But that dont mean I wanna stay the same  
  
You stay with me  
Well baby you and me well change the game
