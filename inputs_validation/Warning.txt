I remember I was asking why  
And someday you said Id know  
All these years of fighting hard  
And now its finally come too close  
  
I cant believe its now happening to me  
Oh couldnt it wait a few hundred years  
Destiny cant rest you see now its time  
Time to cry your tears Now cry  
  
The child of centuries forgotten in time  
You talk in circles of rhyme  
Seer of places future and past  
The warning you gave us is surely our last  
  
Warning  
Behold the child his pointing hand  
Is raised in solemn grace  
His eyes once wide with learning wonder  
Now leave stains upon his face  
  
Now see the hands of the working man  
Hes leaning back against the wall  
Once busy hands are idle now  
Standing ready for the fall Our fall  
  
The signs will come as days past by  
For those that claim to see  
The blind will stay not choosing to die  
Not believing the visions Ive seen  
  
Warning
