The paper boy is working before he goes  
Lying to the teacher he knows he knows  
He didnt and he shouldve  
Brought his lines in yesterday  
Ernie bangs the sound and the day begins  
The letterbox is open and your cash falls in  
Ill meet you at the office  
Just before the staff clock in  
  
Round are way the birds are singing  
Round are way the sun shines bright  
Round are way the birds sing for yer  
The already know yer  
  
The game is kicking off in around the park  
Its twenty five a side and before its dark  
Theres gonna be a loser  
And you know the next goal wins  
Cab it to the front as its called a draw  
Everybodys knockin at yours once more  
Ernie bangs the sound  
And no ones spoken since half past four  
  
Round are way the birds are singing  
Round are way the sun shines bright  
Round are way the birds are minging  
Round are way its alright  
Round are way the birds sing for you  
cause the already know yer  
They already know yer
