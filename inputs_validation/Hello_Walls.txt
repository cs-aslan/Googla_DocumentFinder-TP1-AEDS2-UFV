Hello walls hello hello how things go for you today  
Dont you miss her since she upped and walked away  
And Ill bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me  
But lonely walls Ill keep you company  
Hello window well hello hello I see that youre still here  
Arent you lonely since our darling disappeared  
Well look here is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane  
Now dont you try to tell me that its rain  
She went away and left us all alone the way she planned  
Yes well have to learn to get along without her if we can  
Hello ceiling hello hello Im gonna stare at you a while  
You know I cant sleep so wont you bear with me awhile  
We gotta all stick together or else Ill lose my mind  
Ive got a feeling shell be gone a long long time hello hello
