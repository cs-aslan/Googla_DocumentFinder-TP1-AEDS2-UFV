We are friends for life  
Hold that deep inside  
Let this be a drive  
To survive  
  
And just stand high and tall  
Make sure you give your all  
And if you ever fall  
Know that Im right here  
  
Well always be together dont you worry  
Ill always be by your side dont you worry  
The circle will never end just know that well meet again  
And well always be together forever always  
  
I am here find me in the sky  
Destine with the moon at night  
Your heartbeat is disguised as my lullaby  
Be happy and know that Im  
Watching you travel far and wide  
Waiting for us to meet again  
  
Well always be together dont you worry  
Ill always be by your side dont you worry  
The circle will never end just know that well meet again  
And well always be together forever always  
  
I am here If you need me yeah  
Im in the wind  look for me friend  
Im in the stars when you need me  
The heavens will send a message within  
Straight to your heart ooh  
  
Well always be together dont you worry dont you worry  
Ill always be by your side dont you worry  
The circle will never end just know that well meet again  
And well always be together forever always  
I am here I am here I am here
