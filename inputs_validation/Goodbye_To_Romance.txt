Yeasterday has been and gone  
Tomorrow will I find the sun or will it rain  
Everybodys having fun except me Im the lonely one  
I live in shame  
  
Chorus  
I say goodbye to romance  
Goodbye to friends  
Goodbye to all the past  
I guess well meet well meet in the end  
  
Ive been the king Ive been the clown  
Still broken wings cant hold me down  
Im free again  
The jester with a broken crown  
It wont be me this time around to love in vain  
  
Chorus  
  
And I feel the time is right although I know  
That you just might say to me  
What ya gonna do  
What ya gonna do  
Cause I have to take this chance  
Goodbye to friends and true romance  
And to all of you  
And to all of you  
  
Chorus  
  
And the weathers lookin fine and I think the sun will shine again  
And I feel Ive cleared my mind all the past is left behind again  
  
Chorus
