All our minds attention  
All our hearts affection  
Every heartcry every rhyme  
Everybodys worshipping something  
All our lifes devotion  
Has been set in motion  
Religions dozen for a dime  
Everybodys worshipping something  
Cause thats what we were made to do  
  
Chorus  
And I choose You  
All my attention affection  
And all my devotions for You  
If everybodys worshipping something  
I choose You  
You are beyond conception  
Defying definition  
And You knew me before time  
Centuries of pagans  
Idols fill the nations  
But You are Lord to me and mine  
Everybodys worshipping something  
Cause thats what we were made to dooh oh  
  
Chorus  
Before I chose You You first chose me  
I worship You You alone are worthy  
You alone deserve itall of my worship  
Lord I choose You
