Whos the knucklehead wantin respect  
  
Yo yo  
Never doubt the life  
Yo  
Who the fuck are you to criticize me  
Yo I slap yo I slap dick ta ya wifey  
Yo respect thats my word  
  
Another Wu tradition Street vision listen  
All my life Ive been poverty stricken  
Always took whats mines never was given  
A second chance just to rap sheet a bad decision  
You cant knock the hustle or the life that Im livin  
Quick to stick the clip in blow you out position  
Street jurisdictions nigga no restriction  
Concrete composition for emcees in submission  
Special edition crash course mission  
Push through like the task force and crush all competition  
See you from a distance dry snitchin whisperin  
Greet your man posted up like two little bitches  
When you get the heart step live or catch stitches  
Or find yourself with Del sleepin with the fishes  
I got no love for fans thats fake ass niggas  
I cant stand the bid when its all in my business  
WuTang Forever and a day dont get it twisted  
I get lifted I just shoot somethin from hot biscuit  
These street kids we cant lost we terrorize you district  
Leave no finger prints and no survivin witness  
  
Nowhere to run to nowhere to hide  
Its them kids from the other side Shaolin worldwide  
Street Life Homicide nowhere to run to  
  
Chorus  
Nowhere to hide boo we PLO  
Fo sho if it dont flow gotta go  
Fo sho if it dont blow gotta go  
Fo sho if it aint dough gotta go  
Some didnt listen til my gun went BLOW  
  
Yo thoughts sharper than a Japanese kitana  
Ninja coma piranhas crack teeth on my armor  
Scandalous I ran contrabomber stalker like rebels of Rwanda  
Death before dishonor snake charmer persona of one who makes drama  
Godfather 4 type saga tuckin a revolver in my parker  
Bombin unprepared for departure might talk but strike harder  
Fear the bow of the silent archer  
Sure shotter pass the rock to your starter  
Poison darter news photographers document the horror  
While I bounce Shaunda with Tiwana and I from blue Honda  
Honorable scholar rockwilder rip mics for top dollar  
Your highness the crowd holla  
Got your head rock feel the brain trauma  
Crowd sponsor hotter than Bahama steam saunas  
The Rebel of opera popped off the chocolate and the gosha  
Monster truck crush you impostors  
  
Nowhere to run to nowhere to hide  
Its them kids from the other side Shaolin worldwide  
INS Homicide nowhere to run to  
  
Chorus  
  
Im the four mic emcee with five mic potential  
Overlooked cuz yall cant understand what I been thru  
You aint got to love me or even pretend to  
Actin like the street they aint got no street credentials  
Crack villains raps be killin instrumentals  
The caps pealin and slap a feelin out ya dental  
Underground sound for ghetto residentials  
Up shits creek lookin for some more shit to get into  
Got the clan jewels as I continue  
To serve you everythin on thats on the menu  
With chef John Jacob remember sons Of man told you wake up  
My nigga smell the coffee Im too hardcore to kill softly  
Come to free the mind and get the bullshit up off me  
The jedi only use the force if ya force me  
Shaolin what  
Dont get it fucked up and cross me  
Rappers gettin stuck for actin stuck up and flossy  
Say it aint so Bust the callico  
Rap from the island called Stat here we go  
  
Nowhere to run to nowhere to hide  
Its them kids from the other side Shaolin worldwide  
Method Man Homicide nowhere to run to  
  
Chorus  
  
Wantin respect wantin respect  
Whos the knucklehead wantin respect  
Wantin respect wantin respect  
Wantin respect sharpest niggas in the
