Hey your bones are brittle  
Inside you  
Wrapped so soft your blood is running  
Ill be there  
If youre moving slowly  
Will you still get there  
Ill be there  
Such a strong desire  
Like a hunger  
  
All you need  
To hope you keep your head yeah  
As the slow hand quickens  
  
What youve done with  
All those around you  
Hope for always that someone  
Will come and save you  
Well Ill be there  
To watch you sultry turning  
Seething Ill be there  
Minutes hold on to hours  
Gets you twisting  
  
All you need  
To hope you keep your head yeah oh  
The slow hand quickens  
  
Howd you leave it  
With the love you lost  
You made them crawl to be without you  
The slow hand quickens  
  
Yes sand is empty  
In the hourglass  
Ill be there  
To turn it over and over  
In your head  
  
So you keep the hope  
You get your day yeah oh  
As the slow hand quickens  
  
Oh you see  
Too hard to break  
Too cold to burn  
Afraid your chance is gone  
The wires are crossed  
Your mouth is lost  
You fear youve left it far too long  
The minutes pass  
The hours are gone  
So hard to find your way alone  
As the slow hands quicken  
The slow hands quicken  
  
These slow hands quicken
