I wanna tell you something girl  
  
God intended and you planned it  
It was meant to be  
Like a lover or a brother  
Ill shield you from the enemy  
  
Dont say forever  
Dont say forever  
Hold me  
Lets stay together  
Lets say together  
Look in my eyes  
Cant you see what I need  
  
Work on me baby  
Work on me baby  
I do it better when Im under pressure  
Work on me baby  
Work on me baby  
Some boys are devils  
And some fools say  
Maybe well work it out  
  
I think well work it out  
  
God intended he depended  
On our honesty  
Like a lover like no other  
Ill shield you from the enemy  
  
Youve been trying baby  
Just painting a picture for me  
Aint no use crying darling  
When we love so easily  
  
Every day in every way well work
