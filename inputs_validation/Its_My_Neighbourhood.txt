Dont get too close to me dont overreact  
Youre not the enemy as a matter of fact  
You got your pretty face and you got any name you wore  
Gonna stick by you gonna stumble over what to do  
  
I want it good loving wanna be your plaything  
I want it good loving bring out the beast in me  
I want it good lovingwanna make your heart sing  
In the shadows we are free and I walk you through it  
  
Its my neighborhood thats where I belong  
Youre in trouble if you disagree with me  
Its my neighborhood thats where I belong  
You find out why  
  
Its my neighborhood thats where I belong  
Youre in trouble if you disagree with me  
Its my neighborhood thats where I belong  
You find out why  
  
So many tell you that you cant win  
Its a battle if youre lonely or if youre starting over  
Twofisted and fast on your feet  
And you know theres something more  
And the city kicks it out of you and  
  
I want it good loving wanna be your plaything  
I want it good loving bring out the worst in me  
I want it good loving wanna make your heart sing  
In the shadows we are free and I walk you through it  
  
Its my neighborhood thats where I belong  
Youre in trouble if  
Trouble  
You disagree with me  
Its my neighborhood thats where I belong  
You find out why
