Look at Molly now here she come  
Wearin a wig hat shades to match  
High healed sneakers and an aligator hat  
Wearin her diamons wearin a big ring  
She got rasors on her fingers and everything

Wearin her perfume Chanel number five  
Got to be the finest looking woman alive  
She looks so pretty every time she walks by  
The boys are too nervous even to say hi  
Not too skinny not too fat  
Shes a real humdinger and I like it like that

From the early early morning to the early early night  
See Miss Molly rockin in the house of blue light

When youre rockin and rollin  
Dont you hear your mama call
