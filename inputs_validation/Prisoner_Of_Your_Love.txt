My heart  
fell into the palms of your hands  
this love  
made me understand  
Ive waited all my life for you  
thought id live and die alone  
enraptured by the beauty  
Im a prisoner of your love  
enslaved by the passion  
Im a prisoner of your love  
Im wrapped around your finger  
like the ring on your hand  
Im trapped  
by your love im yours please understand  
Ive waited all my life for you  
thought id live and die alone  
enraptured by the beauty  
Im a prisoner of your love  
enslaved by the passion  
Im a prisoner of your love  
enraptured by the beauty  
Im a prisoner of your love  
enslaved by the passion  
Im a prisoner of your love  
enraptured by the beauty  
Im a prisoner of your love  
enslaved by the passion  
Im a prisoner of your love
