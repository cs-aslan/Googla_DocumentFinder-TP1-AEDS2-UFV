My hands are red  
Admittedly the cross is mine  
The time is come  
Forsake the brine  
Alone with the void for a thousand years  
I am the first of the reptillian rocketeers  
Doom shins its bitter brink  
Its goblins casting stench to pave the way  
Im going off to seek the soul  
Wholl teach me of the day  
A boy will be born in the garden  
Ill wait on a patch of green grass  
Somehow hell know to find me there  
And place a star upon my crust  
Well trace the crescents rim  
Pawns pursuit of deliverance  
My soul a satchel for musical vim  
Then Ill return to save my race
