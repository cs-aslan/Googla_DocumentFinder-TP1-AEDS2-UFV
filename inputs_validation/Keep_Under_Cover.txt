Love Im going to pick you up in the morning  
Love Im going to take you out on a journey  
I dont know where Im going to  
But I know what Ive been going through  
Without you by my side  
  
What good is butter if you havent got bread  
What good is art when it hurts your head  
Might as well be in bed  
  
Keep under cover til the battle has ceased  
Keep out of trouble til the prisoners are released  
  
What goods a puzzle when you havent a clue  
What good is me when Im not with you  
Might as well stay in bed  
  
Keep under cover til the clouds disappear  
Keep out of trouble til the weather is bright and clear  
  
Love Im going to pick you up  
Im going to take you out  
I dont know what Im going to do  
But I know what Ive been going through  
Without you by my side  
Without you by my side  
  
What good is tennis when there isnt a ball  
What goods a curtain without a call  
Might as well be in bed  
  
Keep under cover til the battle has ceased  
Keep out of trouble til the prisoners are released  
  
Love Im going to pick you up  
Im going to take you out  
I dont know what Im going to do  
But I know what Ive been going through  
Without you by my side Repeat
