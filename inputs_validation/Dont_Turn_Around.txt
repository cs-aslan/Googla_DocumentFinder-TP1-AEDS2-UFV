If you want to leave I wont beg you to stay  
And if you gotta go darling maybe its better that way  
Im gonna be strong Im gonna do fine  
Dont worry about this heart of mine  
Just walk out that door see if I care  
Go on and go now but  
Dont turn around  
Cause youre gonna see my heart breaking  
Dont turn around  
I dont want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
Its tearing me apart that youre leaving  
Im letting you go  
But I wont let you know  
I wont miss your arms around me holding me tight  
If you ever think about me just know that Ill be alright  
Im gonna be strong Im gonna do fine  
Dont worry about this heart of mine  
I know Ill survive sure Ill make it through  
And Ill even learn to live without you  
Dont turn around  
Cause youre gonna see my heart breaking  
Dont turn around  
I dont want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
Its tearing me apart that youre leaving  
Im letting you go  
But I wont let you know  
I wish I could scream out loud that I love you  
I wish I could say to you dont go dont go dont go  
Dont turn around  
Cause youre gonna see my heart breaking  
Dont turn around  
I dont want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
Its tearing me apart that youre leaving  
Im letting you go  
But I wont let you know
