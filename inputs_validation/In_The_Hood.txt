Trading route on the border between the North and South  
At a small outpost called Red Clay Village

Whats the total weight of the brain Allah real  
Slang jacks and hold gats in the hood 80 proof  
Get my dick sucked on the roof of the projects  
Dice game in the park blunt sessions after dark

Hey yo we boys in the hood big bad wolves in the woods  
It aint all good pass the goods  
Deep in the project halls waitin to shine  
Walk with a nine and talk with gang signs  
In the hood niggas put twenty on Hoopties  
Four heads one forty ounce and a loosie  
And keep dough on the flip a hoe on the strip  
And roll dick throw on the flip  
Weed clouds thick enough to block the sun  
Cops come but thugs never drop the gun understood  
Far from ya Hollywood  
From day one I vowed I would keep it in the hood  
From project chicks with hips and slim waists  
From five dollar plates apartment sixeighths  
OG I spit G to the young ones

Blink to long ya life is gone in the hood  
Convicts still live with they mom  
And they whole family tree is tattooed on they arm in the hood  
Crack fiendd furnish a Llac in the hood  
Africans be drivin cabs in the hood  
In the streets the ghetto is hot  
And the illest gangsters on the block with cops in the hood  
The ones you lovell fill you with slugs in the hood  
Babies born addicted to drugs in the hood  
We make life or death decisions  
And the school system is like a minimal prison  
So you cant knock the hustle or the life that Im livin  
In the hood it aint all good repent or you sinnin  
  
Repeat x2  
Murder bad boy ya block off ah  
Murder rude boy ya pop off ah
