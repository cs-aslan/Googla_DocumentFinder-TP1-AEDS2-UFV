Hell yeah woo  
Punk rock trippin with the flavor of hip hop  
Spittin out venom as Im watching all your heads bob  
Representing for the outcasts and the have nots  
Feigning to find light in a world that has blacked out  
Your middle fingers up yeah put em up weve had enough  
We take a shot to the chin with a grin were tough  
We know exactly why youre here so make it clear lets go  
We know you want to lets go lets go  
Hell yeah hell yeah we want control  
Hell yeah hell yeah a scene to call our own  
Hell yeah hell yeah I grip the microphone  
And were picking up speed like a rolling stone  
Lets go we cant live forever  
One note the louder the better  
So lets go were in this together  
Cant you hear me  
Hell yeah lets go  
Lets go we cant live forever  
One note the louder the better  
So lets go were in this together  
Cant you hear me  
Hell yeah lets go  
Rising from the ash counter clash there is no doubt  
Swinging from the rafters are the kids who never sold out  
Holding out for hope this shit is dope hear the crowds shout  
Fighting to survive one day well make them tap out  
Well raise your voices up yeah raise em up weve had enough  
Were standing up and now were being heard the gloves are off  
The voice is loud we have the crowd the time is now lets go  
We know you want to lets go lets go  
Hell yeah hell yeah we want control  
Hell yeah hell yeah a scene to call our own  
Hell yeah hell yeah I grip the microphone  
And were picking up speed like a rolling stone  
Lets go we cant live forever  
One note the louder the better  
So lets go were in this together  
Cant you hear me  
Hell yeah lets go  
Lets go we cant live forever  
One note the louder the better  
So lets go were in this together

Get up tonight stand up and fight  
They are here they are in sight theyre inside  
And I cant go alone on this microphone  
Is this on Is this on  
This flow is definitive make your throat hurt  
A gagged voice with no choice its so limited  
Hell yeah come on hell yeah its on  
Bounce to the boom of the beat of the drum drum  
Lets go we cant live forever  
One note the louder the better  
So lets go were in this together  
Cant you hear me

Lets go we cant live forever  
One note the louder the better  
So lets go were in this together  
Cant you hear me  
Hell yeah lets go
