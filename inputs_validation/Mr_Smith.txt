When its time to get down nigga I jam like a Glock  
I bust through all types of red tape and sue papes  
Niggas come old but they always wanna infiltrate  
Im cuttin snakes through the belly witta icepick  
And scoopin hotties a strong aisle of flip trips  
Its the rebirth of murkin niggas once again  
I drain with ink and put your blood in my pen

Scoopedin New Jacks and kick em in the fire bit

Ya better call a medic cos ya look pathetic  
Guan boy its the champion Mr Smith  
Your niggas couldnt raise up with a forklift  
Cocked the hammer peep out the grammar  
Its hard like Bacardi and hot like a house party  
All your socalled flavor niggas is deaded  
Your next step is where ya headed so dont forget it  
Your rhymes is beat your steelos scarred to scrape  
When you scream you sound muddy like a bled teeth  
I getcha open like flay tack you when I spray  
Lethal compositions around your way

Rippin ya ass out the frame with my verbal gift
