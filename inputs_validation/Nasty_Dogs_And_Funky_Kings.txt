Well I knocked down on your door baby  
To see if you were at home  
Your shade was down there wasnt even a sound  
But something told me you werent alone  
What in the world can a nasty dog do  
But try to get next to you  
  
Dont laugh cause it aint funny  
Look how it happened to me  
It could happen to you you could be a fool too  
And itd leave you in misery  
I guess theres nothin more funky king can do  
But to try to get next to you  
  
Mm well
