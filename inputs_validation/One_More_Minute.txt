Ah  
  
Well I heard that youre leavin leavin  
Gonna leave me far behind so far behind  
Cause you found a brand new lover  
You decided that Im not your kind ahh  
  
So I pulled I pulled your name out name out of my Rolodex oh  
And I tore all your pictures in two  
And I burned down the malt shop where we used to go  
Just because it reminds me of you dippity dippity doo  
  
Thats right thats right you aint gonna see me cryin  
Im glad Im glad that you found somebody new  
Cause Id rather spend eternity eating shards of broken glass  
Than spend one more minute with you  
  
I guess I might seem kinda bitter  
You got me feeling down in the dumps  
Cause Im stranded all alone in the gas station of love  
And I have to use the selfservice pumps  
  
Oh so honey let me help you with that suitcase  
You aint you aint gonna break my heart in two  
Cause Id rather get a hundred thousand paper cuts on my face  
Than spend one more minute with you  
  
Id rather rip out my intestines with a fork  
Than watch you going out with other men  
Id rather slam my fingers in a door yeah  
Again and again and again and again and again  
  
Oh cant you see what Im tryin to say Darlin  
  
Id rather have my blood sucked out by leeches leeches  
Shove an icepick under a toenail or two  
Id rather clean all the bathroom in Grand Central Station with my tongue  
Than spend one more minute with you  
  
Yes Id rather jump naked on a huge pile of thumbtacks  
Or stick my nostrils together with crazy glue  
Id rather dive into a swimming pool filled with doubleedged razor blades  
Than spend one more minute with you  
  
Id rather rip my heart out of my ribcage with my bare hands  
And then throw it on the floor and stomp on it till I die  
Than spend one more minute with you
