I fucked up  
I made a mistake  
Nobody does it better than myself  
  
Im sorry  
Im not afraid to say  
I wish I could take you back but I cant  
  
Im so ashamed  
Youre in so much pain  
I blamed you when things didnt go my way  
If I didnt youd be here  
If I didnt fight back Id have no fear  
If I took another path  
Things would be so different but theyre not  
  
I could have just kept  
my big mouth closed  
I could have just done  
what I was told  
Maybe I should turned silver into gold  
But in front of you I was cold  
  
I fucked up  
I made a mistake  
Nobody does it better than myself  
  
Im sorry  
Im not afraid to say  
I wish I could take you back but I cant  
  
I thought we had it all  
You brought out the best in me  
But somehow I destroyed the perfect dream  
I though we were indestructible  
I never imagine we could fall  
You wanna know how to make a laugh  
Telling your plans  
  
We couldve bought a house with a swimming pool  
End it up with walls It would be so cool  
Couldve gone by the s in the country sides  
With a back of great things kissing eye to eye  
  
We couldve do the world in a private jet  
Run naked on the beach all soaking wet  
We couldve find a mountain in a perfect sun set  
Writing out names across the sky  
We couldve got a building built in the echo run  
We couldve got a sales in west and sold out mount  
We coulda live like crazy til the days we die  
Instead I made you cry  
  
I fucked up  
I made a mistake  
Nobody does it better than myself  
  
Im sorry  
Je suis dsole  
I wish I could take you back but I cant  
  
I fucked up  
I made a mistake  
Nobody does it better than myself  
  
Im sorry  
Im not ashamed to say  
I wish I could have you back maybe one day
