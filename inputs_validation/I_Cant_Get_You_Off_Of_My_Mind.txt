Chorus  
Oh I cant get you off of my mind  
When I try I m just wastin my time  
Lord Ive tried and Ive tried  
and all night long Ive cried  
But I cant get you off of my mind  
  
Didnt think you would leave me behind  
But I guess youre the twotimin kind  
Do you think that its smart to jump from heart to heart  
When I cant get you off of my mind  
  
Chorus  
  
You believe that a true love is blind  
So you fool evry new love you find  
Youve got stars in your eyes but they cant hide the lies  
Oh I cant get you off my mind  
  
Chorus
