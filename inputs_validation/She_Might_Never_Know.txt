I was sitting lonely in my car  
Watching her come and go  
I could feel the strings pulling my heart  
From the old house  
That I used to know  
Like the river that was flowing  
She was coming without knowing  
Our loves the river that somehow lost its flow  
Lost its flow  
  
From my car I can see her there  
As the curtain slowly moves  
As he runs his fingers through her hair  
And the fire slowly grooves  
  
Whats the answer to this pain  
I want to get back to her love again  
And there shes sitting in that room  
When she walked cross the street  
Could she feel theres a heat  
From my heart as it beats with her love  
In her eyes other guys  
See the fair that is there  
But she might never know  
But she might never know  
  
I was sitting lonely in my house  
Wanting to tell her wanting to call  
And say I know I let you down  
Without thinking his love might fall  
No more hurting no more clowning  
This emotion isnt drowning  
If the rivers gonna save our true love after all  
After all  
  
Im chewing on my nails again  
With my home across the street  
I aint got no place to turn to now  
While youre cooking for that creep  
  
Whats the answer to this pain  
I want to get back to her love again  
There shes sitting in that room  
  
When she walked cross the street  
Could she feel theres a heat  
From my heart as it beats with her love  
In her eyes other guys see the fair that is there  
But she might never know  
But she might never know  
  
As I turned so she waved this was all that she gave  
So what was there to trade in love  
Just the past that was cast in the groove of the move  
That she might never know  
She might never know
