Yes I know Ive been untrue  
And I have hurt you through and through  
Please have a mercy on this heart of mine  
Take me back and try me one more time  
  
If my darling you could see  
Just what your leaving done to me  
Youd know that love is still a tie that binds  
And take me back and try me one more time  
  
In my dreams I see your face  
But it seems theres someone in my place  
Oh does she know you were once just mine  
Take me back and try me one more time  
  
If you will just forgive me now  
Ill make it up to you somehow  
Ill promise never again to be unkind  
Oh take me back and try me one more time
