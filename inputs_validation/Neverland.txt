Chorus  
Is the whole world gunning for me or is it just all in my mind  
If you want it come and see me  
I aint got nothing but time  
One day youre gonna set me free  
But first you gotta let me shine  
Niggas aint high as I be  
See look momma Im flyin  
  
To Neverland Neverland Neverland  
Ill probably never land  
Neverland Neverland noo Ill never never land  
  
J Cole  Verse 1  
Check my fortune cookie its that Cole World  
Could that mean its meant to be  
So much drive a nigga coulda been a chauffeur  
This life is fcking with me mentally  
Fake niggas try to act like they a friend to me  
I treat you lames how I see you lames enemies  
My good girl say they wanna know the inner me  
My bad girl sayin fck all that enter me  
Double shots hennessy bring out bad tendencies  
Try to cut something need a volunteer Tennessee  
Anything to take my mind off  
I logged on and made them muthafckas sign off  
I got the on my dick theyll never climb off  
I switch watches yet I never took time off time off  
I dont know whats worse fake friends or fake fans  
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn  
  
Chorus  
  
J Cole  Verse 2  
Im sorting through this organised confusion to get my thoughts together  
This shit is sounding like a movie you can watch forever  
I gotta make it to the top its either now or never  
These other niggas cant adapt because they not as clever  
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt its better  
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter  
Cold World snow flurries in the hottest weather  
And so sick they cant fix this with medicine  
We at yo door and she gotta let us in  
Its what you want I whet your appetite  
Cole hit the scene now Im what everyone rapping like  
Shame you feel you have to bite  
Still aint nobody snapping right  
Pedal to the metal as Im speeding through the traffic lights  
Bitch I gotta catch a flight come on already  
Still fight like Im the underdog Im on already  
Got a few niggas we bout to prove wrong yall already already  
  
Chorus
