Ah Backstreet  
Yes yes yall  
One time here we go yes yes yall  
Ooh ooh  
Yes yes yall  
I could tell when I stepped in the room  
And I saw you standing there  
And about by the way that you moved  
I couldnt help the way I stared  
  
There were some mysterious folks  
They led me here to you  
Lead me lead me to you to you  
So I stood there watching  
And I was hypnotized  
By the rhythm of your body  
And the music in your eyes  
And I was lost inside a groove with you  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
Hey Mr DJ keep playin that song for me  
Out on the floor in my arms shes gotta be  
Lets get it on lets get it on  
Jam all night long  
Mr DJ Mr DJ  
Will you play it for me  
Ooh ooh yes yes yall  
Now it feels like it could be romance  
As we dance across the floor  
Every move that your body makes  
  
Only makes me want you more  
And it seems like times moving fast  
How can we make it last  
Make it make it last last so long  
As we keep on dancing  
I am hypnotized  
By the rhythm of your body  
And the music in your eyes  
Ooh ooh  
  
Close your eyes close your eyes  
And just imagine this alone  
Let the music put you in a groove  
I am lost lost inside a groove with you  
When you do the things you do  
Come on and work your body work your body  
Hey Mr DJ jam all night long  
Hey Mr DJ play that song for me  
  
Keep it coming Mr DJ
