I know Ill never meet another hunk of woman like my Ann  
Cause she makes me feel like a great big man  
Im a gonna go tell her mama what I think about her say thank you maam  
For giving me your daughter Ann  
  
She sure is stacked from her toes to the pretty little nape  
Of her neck shes packed like a seed in a grape shes smooth as marble skin  
When I see her I believe Im a real young guy  
And every time I go to work I think I might die if I cant hurry home again  
  
If the good Lord worked all night a makin me a female plan  
Id say no thanks Lord Ill just keep Ann  
  
How could I ever look at any other woman when Ive got Ann  
Oh I feel so good when she takes my hand  
Im a gonna go tell her daddy what I think about her say thank you man  
For giving me your daughter Ann  
  
When I come home and I feel like Ive been run over  
By a tenton truck she can rub my shoulders and soothe my aches and pains  
If I lose my job and Im down to a silver dollar  
And I feel like a dried up gourd in a holler she soothes my brow like summer
rain  
  
If the good Lord worked all night a making me a female plan  
Id say no thanks you Lord Ill just keep Ann  
Oh no thanks you Lord Ill just keep Ann
