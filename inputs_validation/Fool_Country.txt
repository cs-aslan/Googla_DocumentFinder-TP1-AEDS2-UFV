Fool whatever you do you remind me  
Fool wherever you go you wont find me  
Im really down on love so save on your smile  
Fool I wont be needin any not for a while  
Im really down on love so save on your smile  
Fool I wont be needin any not for a while  
Fool wherever you go youre a loser  
Such a fool I want you to know youre a loser  
Im really down on love so save on your smile  
Fool I wont be needin any not for a while  
Im really down on love so save on your smile  
Fool I wont be needin any not for a while  
Fool fool  
Im sure I should pass a law laying down  
Declare you will never wear your face in a frown  
Obey or be on your way  
Get on the first stage out of this town  
Theres me and my deputy to shake you down  
If you dont grin we will take you in  
So spread some sunshine around  
Obey or be on your way  
Get on the first stage out of this town
