Illuminate the obvious  
Its standing right here in  
Front of us  
What our apartment does  
When were not around  
Does not concern us  
  
Simulate the obvious  
And its standing standing  
Right here in front of us  
Just what our apartment does  
When were not around  
Does not concern us  
  
Shes the horrible esthete  
And she hates her ugly feet  
At a place where her friends  
All meet  
She takes her shoes off and  
Invites everyone to see  
  
Eliminate the obvious  
And its right here right here  
In front of us  
Just what our apartment does  
When were not around  
Does not concern us  
  
Shes the horrible esthete  
At the place where her friends all meet  
While her clock reinforces its conceit  
And her mirror checks out  
Other things  
The walls stand a little more  
At ease  
And her books they chat so  
Expertly  
And her cups and saucers get  
Some sleep  
And things get all together neat  
And at the clicking of the key  
Returns the horrible esthete
