Chorus  
Bootleg bootleg  
Bootleg howl  
Bootleg bootleg  
Bootleg howl  
  
Take you a glass of water  
Make it against the law  
See how good the water tastes  
When you cant have any at all  
  
Chorus  
  
Findin a natural woman  
Like honey to a bee  
  
But you dont buzz the flower  
When you know the honeys free  
  
Chorus  
  
Suzy maybe give you some cherry pie  
But lord that aint no fun  
Better you grab it when she aint lookin  
Cause you know youd rather have it on the run  
  
Chorus
