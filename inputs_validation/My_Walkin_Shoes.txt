My walkin shoes dont fit me anymore  
My walkin shoes dont fit me anymore  
Stay on your side of town honey I wont be around  
My walkin shoes dont fit me anymore  
  
Its a long way from here to over yonder  
My feet theyre getting mighty sore  
I aint comin back youve made your mind to wander  
My walkin shoes dont fit me anymore  
  
My walkin shoes dont fit me anymore  
My walkin shoes dont fit me anymore  
Stay on your side of town honey I wont be around  
My walkin shoes dont fit me anymore  
  
Ill be a long time gone from you baby  
Youll never hear me knock upon your door  
Thought you were worth it once but I was crazy  
My walkin shoes dont fit me anymore  
  
My walkin shoes dont fit me anymore  
My walkin shoes dont fit me anymore  
Stay on your side of town honey I wont be around  
My walkin shoes dont fit me anymore
