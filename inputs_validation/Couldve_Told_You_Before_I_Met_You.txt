Welcome to a love invisible  
Welcome to this love so plainly seen  
Welcome to a love invincible  
Love like I never dream before  
  
I couldve told you fore I met you how it would be  
I couldve told you fore I met you how Id fall  
I couldve told you fore I met you how I would feel  
I couldve told you fore I met you it was all borne out in the end  
  
Welcome to a love insensible  
Welcome to a love thats just too true  
Welcome to a love irreversible  
Welcome to a love thats just brand new  
  
I couldve told you fore I met you how it would be  
I couldve told you fore I met you cos youre strong  
I couldve told you fore I met you how I would feel  
I couldve told you fore I met you  
  
I couldve told you fore I met you  
I couldve told you fore I met you  
I couldve told you fore I met you  
I couldve told you fore I met you  
  
Welcome to a feeling intangible  
Welcome to a love thats what it seems  
Welcome to a love so frangible  
Together go weaving in my dreams  
  
I couldve told you fore I met you how it would be  
I couldve told you fore I met you how Id fall  
I couldve told you fore I met you how I would feel  
I couldve told you fore I met you I think Id fall  
  
I couldve told you fore I met you how it would be  
I couldve told you fore I met you how Id fall  
I couldve told you fore I met you how I would feel  
I couldve told you fore I met you how Id fall
