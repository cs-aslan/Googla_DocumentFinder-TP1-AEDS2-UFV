Here here we go from Japan to Romeo  
My flow is slow and its ya know my first time on radio  
Now some say Im foul some say Im wild  
And that all might be true  
  
But it did not happen overnight  
So let me tell my tale to you  
It started out when I was six just tellin dirty jokes  
My mother overheard and washed my mouth out with soap  
  
Now as I grew I always knew what it was for me to do  
Never front just be blunt and always tell the truth  
Never fake I never act like something that Im not  
Remember me Im that foul mouthed kid that lived around your block  
  
You thought that I was crazy like a dog chasin its tail  
And by the time I turned of legal age Id probably be in jail  
In school my teachers thought I was just a foul mouthed freak  
Now their yearly salary is what I make in just one week  
  
So to thepeople who used to say you think you know it all  
Maybe I do and maybe I dont but right now Im standin tall  
And you dont know me  
Its funny how one kid can cause so much confusion  
  
Parents should be happy Im the dop their kids are using  
Now some people think this business is all fame and glory  
But theres a flip side to that truth so let me kick my story  
It took me oh so long to reach the point Im at  
  
Every time I take one stip forward they push me two steps back  
I give an inch they take a mile some try to cramp my style  
They try to diss they shoot they miss  
I walk off with a smile  
  
But time will pass and Ill out last anyone who doubts me  
And the booty naked truth is you dont know shit about me  
So when Im in your town to nearst mic please kindly show me  
So you can see whats really me and find out you dont know me  
  
cause you dont know me  
Now you might want to party man so heres your party jam  
Hey girly in that skirt I want you just like Uncle Sam  
Lets knock boots lets knock boots right down to the nitty gritty  
  
With every drind n every blink you seem to get more pretty  
So out the bar straight to my car now whats left to do  
She was sayin I love you so I said yeah I love you to  
Ha  
  
Next day I awoke I almost choked  
Whos bringin me inside  
My head was ringin heard people singin here comes the bride  
Thinkin just what was I drinkin as I looked around to see  
  
The girl I met last night was at the alter waitin on me  
Next thing I know Im face to face with holy matrimony  
Looked at that bitch and I quick screamiN  
You dont know meShe didnt know me  
  
Girls around this country think Im nasty think Im sexist  
But they bought my first LP  
You knowGrits Sandwiches for Breakfast  
Sayin ooh your this and oooh your that uh uh uh hold up cutie  
  
Whats your favorite song off that LP  
Ah Wax that Booty  
A lesson taught I know you thought my dirty raps were kinda funny  
But close minded people thought I was only out to make money  
  
But check on back cause its a fact obscenity is no new thing  
Remember Chuck Berry and when he sang My Ding A Ling  
But for me I feel what I see and I say just what I feel  
And in this world everything I see you know is all too real  
  
Even though I dont look the same cause I cut off my flat top  
Ill always say just what I feel cause thats the real Kid Rock  
And you dont know me
