Who is this man  
That follows me  
This blue eyed boy  
Who wants to be  
  
This worthy cause  
Of human kind  
This pawn set up by time  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright hell get you flying  
Hell drive you away hell drive you insane  
But then hell remove all of your pain  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright hell get you flying  
Hell get you flying hell get you flying  
Hell get you flying flying flying  
  
This open book  
Yet to be read  
This second look  
This leap ahead  
  
The hope I held inside  
With you was kept alive  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright hell get you flying  
Hell drive you away hell drive you insane  
But then hell remove all of your pain  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright Hell get you flying  
Hell get you flying Hell get you flying  
Hell get you flying flying flying  
  
Were here to stay  
Were here to stay  
Were here to stay  
Were here to stay  
Were here to stay  
Were here to stay  
Were here to stay  
Were here to stay  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright hell get you flying  
Hell get you flying hell get you flying  
Hell get you flying flying flying
