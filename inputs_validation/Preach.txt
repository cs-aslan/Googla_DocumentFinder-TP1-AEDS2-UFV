You know what Im trying to do  
Hey lets pop the E off at Liv Ive got some time here to blow

Verse 2 Drake  
Still in Miami  
Most of these girls are too messy  
Ive got to do some reflecting  
Ive got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction  
Im convinced that my calls are being recorded  
So hit my assistant to get me the message  
And make the connection like brrrrr  
Im on my way tonight I hope you not the crazy type yeah  
Im in your state tonight I might just break the bank tonight  
PND aint with the ray tay tay  
You know Jay Ray  
Got girls her going way way way way way way  
Sauga city trip the pay day  
Load up off a gate way  
Man you cant afford me  
Doing is one thing doing it right is a whole different story  
Niggas is all in their feelings these days all in their feelings these days  
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes you should be afraid
