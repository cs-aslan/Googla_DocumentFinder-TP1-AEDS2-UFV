Oh you playing games playing games hurting my soul  
Seven days seven nights without control  
Oh every day every night I was alone  
When youre not next to me  
Should I listen to my heart girl  
Should I listen to my brain  
When you tell me you leave me and you give it up  
Cant we still be friends  
  
Oh after your love is gone  
I dont know where I belong  
When youre not next to me not next to me  
Im dying crying baby  
Oh after your love is gone  
Oh baby Im so alone  
When you next to me its ecstasy  
Im dying crying baby  
  
Oh you playing games playing games playing with love  
You can run but dont hide cant get enough  
Anyway anywhere Ill be there  
Cause youre the one for me  
Cause when I give you all my heart girl  
You know I will die for you  
And when you tell me youll leave me and you give it up  
I lose my destiny
