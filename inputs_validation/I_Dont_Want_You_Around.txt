Jenny so many times I tried to get away  
But you kept following me all over town  
Ill display it theres no way to say it  
I dont just want you  
  
I just dont want you around  
I dont want you around  
You follow me around  
Its really bringing me down  
I dont want you around  
  
When it was time to go I had nothing to say  
Dont you look at me  
Dont you look at me that way  
I love you Oh really Please go away  
  
What gave you the idea  
Get it out of your head  
You follow us around  
Were not the Grateful Dead  
  
I wanted to be friends but you wanted more  
So like I told you before  
I dont want you around
