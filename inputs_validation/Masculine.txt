This is one of the neighbors from down the street  
This record of this music has been goin on all afternoon  
and Im sick and tired of it If it doesnt stop Im calling the police  
  
You got me on the run you got it your way  
Now Im feeling pretty good and Im beginning to sweat  
Your love is so fine its got me feelin alright  
Going out of my mind I got to have you tonight  
  
The girls so deep inside like blood in my veins  
Never lets me hide now Im going insane  
It makes me climb the walls bite my nails to the bone  
Its always by my side it never leaves me alone  
  
Chorus  
When its time to get tough Im masculine masculine masculine  
When she wants to play rough Im masculine masculine masculine  
Masculine  
  
I know that Im a man from the spark in my soul  
It can make me so hot you got out of control  
Grab her by the hair drag her back to your cave  
Its what makes a man a man people always stay the same  
  
Chorus  
  
Im masculine  
  
Masculine masculine  
  
Anytime anyplace anyway in the heat of the night and in the dark of the day  
Anytime anyplace anyway  
  
When its time to get tough Im masculine masculine masculine  
When she wants to make love Im masculine  what dyou say  
When she wants to make love Im masculine  
  
When she wants to play rough Im masculine masculine masculine  
When she wants to make love Im masculine masculine masculine  
If you push me Ill shove Im masculine  
When she wants to play rough Im masculine  
When she wants to make love Im masculine
