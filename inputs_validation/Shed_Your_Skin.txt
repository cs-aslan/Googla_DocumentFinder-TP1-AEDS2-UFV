115  
You are 17  
Itchy trigger  
Venemous  
You growing longer  
You growing stronger  
You shed your skin  
Now shed this  
  
Come on over baby  
You tell me its holy holy  
I dont know what that is  
Come on over  
Lets call it the fullness of time  
I dont know what that is  
Hey holy console me  
Some power control me  
Remorse it  
I force it  
Cant free it  
So be it  
  
Im speaking in tongues  
Handling you  
I got religion now look at it  
The days grow longer  
As we grow stronger  
So shed your skin baby  
Let it rip  
  
Now tell me its holy holy  
I dont know what that is  
I want to call it the fullness of time  
But I dont know if it is  
Hey holy console me  
Some power control me  
Remorse it  
I force it  
Cant free it  
So be it  
  
I got the hangman  
I got Milagro  
I got the celebration too  
The flesh is strong  
The spirit stronger  
So shed your skin baby  
Let it through  
  
Come on over
