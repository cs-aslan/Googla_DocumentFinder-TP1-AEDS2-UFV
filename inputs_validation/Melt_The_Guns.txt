Programmes of violence  
As entertainment  
Brings the disease into your room  
We know the germ  
Which is manmade in metal  
Is really a key to your own tomb  
  
Prevention is better than cure  
Bad apples affecting the pure  
Youll gather your senses Im sure  
Then agree to  
  
Melt the guns  
Melt the guns  
Melt the guns  
And never more to fire them  
  
Melt the guns  
Melt the guns  
Melt the guns  
And never more desire them  
  
Children will want them  
Mothers supply them  
As long as your killers are heroes  
And all the media  
Will fiddle while Rome burns  
Acting like moderntime Neros  
  
Prevention is better than cure  
Bad apples affecting the pure  
Youll gather your senses Im sure  
Then agree to  
  
Melt the guns  
Melt the guns  
Melt the guns  
And never more to fire them  
  
Melt the guns  
Melt the guns  
Melt the guns  
And never more desire them  
  
Im speaking to the Justice League of America  
The you S of A  
Hey you  
Yes you in particular  
When it comes to the judgement day and youre standing at the gates with your
weaponry  
You dead go down on one knee  
Clasp your hands in prayer and start quoting me  
cause we say  
Our father weve managed to contain the epidemic in one place now  
Lets hope they shoot themselves instead of others  
Help to civilize the race now  
Weve trapped the cause of the plague  
In the land of the free and the home of the brave  
If we listen quietly we can hear them shooting from grave to grave  
You ought to  
  
Melt the guns  
Melt the guns  
Melt the guns  
And never more to fire them  
  
Melt the guns  
Melt the guns  
Melt the guns  
And never more desire them
