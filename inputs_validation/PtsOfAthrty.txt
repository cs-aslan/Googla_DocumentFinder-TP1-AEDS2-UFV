Yo yo  
Forfeit the game before somebody takes you out of the frame  
Put your name to shame cover up your face  
You cant run the race the pace is too fast you just wont last  
Wont last wont last wont last wont last  
Wont last wont last wont last wont last wont last wont last wont
last  
Wont last wont last  
  
You love the way I look at you  
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through  
You take away if I give in  
My life my pride is broken  
  
You like to think youre never wrong  
You like to think youre never wrong  
You have to act like youre someone  
You have to act like youre someone  
You want someone to hurt like you  
You want someone to hurt like you  
You want to share what youve been through  
You live what youve learned  
Learned learned learned learned learned  
  
You love the things I say Ill do  
The way I hurt myself again just to get back at you  
You take away when I give in  
My life my pride is broken  
  
You like to think youre never wrong  
You like to think youre never wrong  
You have to act like youre someone  
You have to act like youre someone  
You want someone to hurt like you  
You want someone to hurt like you  
You wanna share what youve been through  
You live what youve learned
