I was on my way down to Mexico  
There was trouble on the rise  
It was nothing more than Id left behind  
Which was much to my surprise  
I turned around and lit a cigarette  
Wiped the dust off of my boots  
When up ahead I saw the crowd  
I knew it was no use  
  
Its been the same way for Oh so long  
It looks like Im singing the same old song  
  
A fine and fancy man was he  
Doing good things for the poor  
Giving rides in his rocking Eightyeight for free  
They could not hope for more  
When it came my turn he said to me  
Have I seen your face before  
I said Oh no you must be wrong  
Im from a distant shore  
  
So if you dont mind Ill just move along  
But it looks like Im singing the same old song  
  
A Nineteen Forty movie star  
With a long forgotten name  
She was a sexy mess in her pleated dress  
Still hanging on to fame  
With forgotten lines she missed her cue  
And left a glass of wine at home  
She was singing the same song that I was  
Could we both be wrong  
  
So hand in hand we walked along  
Each of us singing the same old song
