You have to leave me all by myself dear and Ive been crying the whole night
through  
But Ive been telling everybody Im waitin just for you  
Your friends are trying so hard to tempt me theres no use trying cause Ill
be true  
And darling you dont have to worry nobody else will do  
  
I know this waitin can drive me crazy dont mind this waitin its nothing
new  
For Ill be telling everybody Im waitin just for you  
Maybe a long time before I see you so we can do what we used to do  
But Ill be telling everybody Im waitin just for you
