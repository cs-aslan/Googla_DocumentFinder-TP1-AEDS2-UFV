Come gather round people  
Wherever you roam  
And admit that the waters  
Around you have grown  
And accept it that soon  
Youll be drenched to the bone  
If your time to you is worth savin  
Then you better start swimmin  
Or youll sink like a stone  
For the times they are achangin  
  
Come writers and critics  
Who prophesize with your pen  
And keep your eyes wide  
The chance wont come again  
And dont speak too soon  
For the wheels still in spin  
And theres no tellin who that its namin  
Cause the loser now  
Will be later to win  
For the times they are achangin  
  
Come senators congressmen  
Please heed the call  
Dont stand in the doorways  
Dont block up the hall  
For he that gets hurt  
Will be he that has stalled  
The battle outside ragin  
Will soon shake your windows  
And rattle your walls  
For the times they are achangin  
  
Come mothers and fathers  
All over the land  
And dont criticize  
What you cant understand  
Your sons and your daughters  
Are beyond your command  
Your old road is rapidly agin  
Please get out of the new one  
If you cant lend your hand  
For the times they are achangin  
  
The line it is drawn  
The curse it is cast  
The slow one now  
Will later be fast  
And the present now  
Will later be past  
The order is rapidly fadin  
The first one now  
Will later be last  
For the times they are achangin  
For the times they are achangin
