Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck  
Some nights I call it a draw  
  
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle  
Some nights I wish theyd just fall off  
  
But I still wake up I still see your ghost  
Oh Lord Im still not sure what I stand for oh oh oh  
What do I stand for Oh what do I stand for  
Most nights I dont know anymore  
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh oh  
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh oh  
  
This is it boys this is war what are we waiting for  
Why dont we break the rules already  
I was never one to believe the hype  
Save that for the black and white I try twice as hard and Im half as liked  
But here they come again to jack my style  
  
Thats alright I found a martyr in my bed tonight  
Stops my bones from wondering just who I who I who I am oh who am I mm mm  
  
Well some nights I wish that this all would end  
Cause I could use some friends for a change  
And some nights Im scared youll forget me again  
Some nights I always win I always win  
  
But I still wake up I still see your ghost  
Oh Lord Im still not sure what I stand for oh  
What do I stand for Oh what do I stand for Most nights I dont know come
on  
  
So this is it I sold my soul for this  
Washed my hands of that for this  
I miss my mom and dad for this  
No When I see stars when I see stars thats all they are  
When I hear songs they sound like a swan so come on  
Oh come on oh come on oh come on  
  
Well that is it guys that is all five minutes in and Im bored again  
Ten years of this Im not sure if anybody understands  
This is not one for the folks at home Im sorry to leave mom I had to go  
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun  
My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she called love  
But when I look into my nephews eyes  
Man you wouldnt believe the most amazing things that can come from  
Some terrible nights ah oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh oh  
  
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh oh  
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh oh  
  
The other night you wouldnt believe the dream I just had about you and me  
I called you up but wed both agree  
Its for the best you didnt listen  
Its for the best we get our distance oh  
Its for the best you didnt listen  
Its for the best we get our distance oh
