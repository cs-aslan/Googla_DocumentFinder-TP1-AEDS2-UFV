Theres a soldier here today  
But she dont bear steel in anywhere  
Shes like a bow  
Seeking a wooden arrow  
Pointing the way to love  
We all know how we can hate  
Just as strong as we could ever love  
We can love we can love  
God bless you God  
For Sending me a woman  
Pointing the way to love  
We gotta love a woman  
Theres a statue in the square  
But the things they hadnt  
It aint fair it aint fair Lord  
The things they hadnt  
Cause beneath the stone  
The greatest Man is all alone  
Without a woman to love  
Without a woman to shove  
Without a woman to point the way to love  
We gotta love a woman
