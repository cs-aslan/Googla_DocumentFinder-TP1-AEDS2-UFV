When the wind dont blow in Amarillo  
And the moon along  
The Gunnison dont rise  
Shall I cast my dreams  
Upon your love babe  
And lie beneath  
The laughter of your eyes  
Its snowin on Raton  
Come morning Ill be through  
Them hills and gone  
Mother thinks the road  
Is long and lonely  
Little brother thinks  
The road is straight and fine  
Little darling thinks  
The road is soft and lovely  
Im thankful that old road  
Is a friend of mine  
Bid the years goodbye  
You cannot still them  
You cannot turn  
The circles of the sun  
You cannot count the miles  
Until you feel them  
And you cannot hold  
A lover that has gone  
Tomorrow the mountains  
Will be sleeping  
Silent neath a blanket  
Green and blue  
All that I shall hear  
The silence they are keeping  
Ill bring all their promises to you
