Me and you were not that pretty  
Me and you could use a lift  
Im out here on the corner crying  
I got ribbons but I got no gift  
  
Me and you were all weve got  
Me and you could be our curse  
Weve got bleeding hearts and flowers  
You got strings but you got no purse  
  
Were just freaks in love  
Saints above  
Shine on our sweet life  
Happy is the union  
Of fools and freaks alike  
  
And fearless are the idiots  
Among the hawks and doves  
Were on the outside looking in  
A couple of freaks in love  
  
Theres a wonder in this weakness  
Its so beautiful sometimes  
Across the universe were lightning  
In the race were a step behind  
  
Me and you were not for everyone  
Me and you were damaged goods  
Were antique and unacceptable  
And just misunderstood  
  
Were just freaks in love  
Saints above  
Shine on our sweet life  
Happy is the union  
Of fools and freaks alike  
  
And fearless are the idiots  
Among the hawks and doves  
Were on the outside looking in  
A couple of freaks in love  
  
Were just freaks in love  
Saints above  
Shine on our sweet life  
Happy is the union  
Of fools and freaks alike  
  
And fearless are the idiots  
Among the hawks and doves  
Were on the outside looking in  
A couple of freaks in love  
  
Were on the outside looking in  
A couple of freaks in love
