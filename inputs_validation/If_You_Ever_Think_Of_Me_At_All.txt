You said you were loving me  
You said I could never see  
The forest for the trees  
Where youre concerned  
  
Just another game youve lost  
And just another stream youll cross  
And just another bridge  
Youll have to burn  
  
So youre on your way to Texas girl  
Youre Amarillo bound  
You told me when I picked you up someday  
Youd let me down  
  
If you ever think to write me  
If you ever think to call  
If you ever think of me at all  
If you ever think of me at all  
  
But you wont think about me much  
And you wont even miss my touch  
And you wont ever see my face at night  
  
You are so intent on losing  
Thats the kind of life youre choosing  
Now youve got me much too weak to fight  
  
So youre on your way to Texas girl  
Youre Amarillo bound  
You told me when I picked you up someday  
Youd let me down  
  
If you ever think to write me  
If you ever think to call  
If you ever think of me at all  
If you ever think of me at all
