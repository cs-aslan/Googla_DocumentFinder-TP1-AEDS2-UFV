You must always remember  
Life can be a challenge  
Life can seem impossible  
Its never easy when so much is on the line  
  
But you can make a difference  
With courage you can set things right  
The gift to dream and make dream real  
Is yours and mine  
  
The power of one  
Begins with believing  
Its starts in the heart  
Then flows through the soul  
And changes the world  
Imagine how life will be  
When we stand in unity  
Each of us holds the key  
To the power of one  
  
Each of us is chosen  
Theres a mission just for you  
Just look inside  
Youll be surprised  
What you can do  
  
The power of one  
Begins with believing  
Its starts in the heart  
Then flows through the soul  
And changes the world  
Imagine how life will be  
When we stand in unity  
Each of us holds the key  
To the power of one  
  
Then one by one  
We can make the world  
A much better place  
  
The power of  
One  
Begins with believing  
Its starts in the heart  
Then flows through the soul  
And changes the world  
Imagine how life will be  
When we stand in unity  
Each of us holds the key  
Its inside of you and me  
Each of us holds the key  
To the power of one  
  
The power of one
