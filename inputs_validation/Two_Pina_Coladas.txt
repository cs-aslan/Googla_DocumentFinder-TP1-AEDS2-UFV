I was feelin the blues  
I was watching the news  
When this fella came on the TV  
He said Im tellin you  
That science has proven  
That heartaches are healed by the sea  
That got me goin  
Without even knowin  
I packed right up and drove down  
Now Im on a roll  
And I swear to my soul  
Tonight Im gonna paint this town  
So bring me two pina coladas  
I want one for each hand  
Lets set sail with Captin Morgan  
And never leave dry land  
Any troubles I forgot em  
I buried em in the sand  
So bring me two pina coladas  
She said goodbye to her good timin man  
Oh now Ive gotta say  
That the wind and the waves  
And the moon winkin down at me  
Eases my mind  
By leavin behind  
The heartaches that love often brings  
Now Ive got a smile  
That goes on for miles  
With no inclination to roam  
Ive gotta say  
That I think Ive gotta stay  
Cause this is feelin more and more like home  
So bring me two pina coladas  
Gotta have one for each hand  
Lets set sail with Captin Morgan  
Oh and never leave dry land  
Any troubles I forgot em  
I buried em in the sand  
So bring me two pina coladas  
She said goodbye to her good timin man  
Bring me bring me two pina coladas  
I want one for each hand  
Lets set sail with Captin Morgan  
Oh and never leave dry land  
Any troubles I forgot em  
I buried em in the sand  
So bring me two pina coladas  
And say hello to her good timin man
