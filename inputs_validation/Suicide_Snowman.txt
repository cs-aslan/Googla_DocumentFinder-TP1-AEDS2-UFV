If I had time to kill the world Id try  
Ohh no but Im busy killing me  
I dont have time to build a suicide  
Because the snowman melts in spring  
The striped girls will not be coming back  
In the summer they run from me May  
I dont have time to even say goodbye  
We are dying as winter leaves spring  
Snow melts in my lawn and I am free yeah  
Corn cob pipe and a button nose yeah  
Puddled in the grass two lump of coal  
Snow melts in my lawn and I am  
If I had time to kill the world Id try  
But Im busy killing whats in me  
I dont have time to even say goodbye  
We are dying as winter leaves spring  
Snow melts in my lawn and I am free yeah  
Corn cob pipe and a button nose yeah  
Spring spring spring spring  
Spring spring spring spring
