When shadows beckon on dimlit avenues  
Night people hear the call  
From hidden alleys secret rendezvous  
They come out one and all  
The city by night Im wide awake  
It never sleeps make no mistake  
Whatever sets off the spark  
A magic glow lights the dark  
Then Im intrigued by the sight  
Of the city by night  
Those crowded nightclubs  
Those picturesque cafes  
Are scenes noone forgets  
And Im enchanted music softly plays  
By dancing silhouettes  
The city by night Im wide awake  
It never sleeps make no mistake  
The evenings full of surprise  
Its magic opens my eyes  
And Im intrigued by the sight  
Of the city by night  
Yeah
