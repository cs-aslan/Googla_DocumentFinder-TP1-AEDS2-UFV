He never makes me feel ashamed  
He bounces me high up on his back  
He gives me the gold hat when Im jump attacked  
  
My new boyfriend my new boyfriend  
My new boyfriend  
Protects me  
He defends me  
He respects me  
He loves me more than you ever did  
My new boyfriend isnt just some kid  
My new boyfriend ooh my new boyfriend  
  
He call in the trumpets for a laugh  
He show me the way it was in Spain  
He give me the golly when Im too insane  
  
My new boyfriend my new boyfriend  
My new boyfriend  
Protects me  
He defends me  
He respects me  
He loves me more than you ever did  
My new boyfriend isnt just a baby  
My new boyfriend isnt just some kid  
My new boyfriend ooh my new boyfriend  
  
he loves the living daylights out of me  
He springs a ladder to the moon  
He sings the far side of the tune  
  
Hes a driven silver lover  
He can swim under the covers  
Hes a high gold bouncing lover  
  
Hes a diver and a dreamer  
Hes a dolphin in the ocean  
Hes a rival of Orion
