The thought of you keeps haunting me  
And its your face I always see  
Wherever I go I always remember  
Soon its Christmas yes its Christmas  
But youre not here anymore  
  
The last time it was us together  
But we just cant make it last forever  
What can I do each time I remember  
Soon its Christmas ooh its Christmas again  
  
Chorus  
Though the stars shine so bright  
I just cant feel so right  
If I cant find a way to be with you again on Christmas day  
Yeah yeah  
  
Repeat 2nd stanza  
Repeat chorus except last line  
Repeat chorus  
  
Soon its Christmas ahh  
Soon its Christmas yeah ahh  
Soon its Christmas  
Fading
