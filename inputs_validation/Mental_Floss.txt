All deserters will be shot  
at 5 oclock tomorrow morning  
so get yourselves together  
and quit messing around  
No more nonsense  
The assassination occurred at 330  
No one was there to witness it  
Even the breviaries had left their tapestries on the window  
And we were all silenced  
by the sad mildew cloud  
that followed around  
I wish I was back in the land of the  
of the  
Aaahm uhm  
You cant pin that one on me  
I didnt do a goddamn thing  
I was just standing there  
Then a bunch of guys came up  
and started laying all this shit on me  
Now what am I supposed to do  
Im an American You cant touch me  
Did you know all nuns are 42  
And their eyes are blue  
Did you know all table clothes  
are white in France  
Did you know women wear underpants  
Well they do  
How does a musician imitate  
the sound of underpants sliding  
over a womans thighs  
down over her ankles  
and over her little toes  
And the rings on her toes  
And her unquipped toe nails  
Lightning struck the magic purse  
I didnt do a damn thing man  
I was just standing there  
in front of the Delicatessen  
and all these rabbies ran up  
and a bunch of Indians and freaks  
and monsters and f just started   
mhmh talking in all these weird languages  
What aah  what  could I say  
Hey Im tired of being a freaky musician  
I wanna be Napoleon  
Lets have some more wars around here  
What a stinking shitty little war we have running over there  
Lets get a big one  
A real big one  
With a lotta killings and bombs and blood
