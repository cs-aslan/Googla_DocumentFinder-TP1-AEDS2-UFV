Broken bicycles old busted chains  
With busted handle bars out in the rain  
Somebody must have an orphanage for  
All these things that nobody wants any more  
Septembers reminding July  
Its time to be saying goodbye  
Summer is gone Our love will remain  
Like old broken bicycles out in the rain  
  
Broken bicycles dont tell my folks  
Theres all those playing cards pinned to the spokes  
Laid down like skeletons out on the lawn  
The wheels wont turn when the other has gone  
The seasons can turn on a dime  
Somehow I forget every time  
For all the things that youve given me  
Will always stay there broken but Ill never throw them away
