Its wonderful so they say  
And with a moon up above its wonderful  
Its wonderful so they tell me

I know I never read it  
I only know they tell me that love is grand  
And  
  
The thing thats known as romance  
Is wonderful wonderful in every way  
So they say  
  
You leave your house some morning  
And without any warning  
Youre stopping people shouting that love is grand  
And  
  
To hold a girl in your arms  
Is wonderful wonderful in every way  
So they say
