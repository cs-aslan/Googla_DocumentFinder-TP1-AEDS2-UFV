I need an easy friend  
I do with an ear to lend  
I dont think you fit this shoe  
I do wont you have a clue  
  
Ill take advantage while  
You hang me out to dry  
But I cant see you every night  
Free  
  
Im standing in your line  
I do hope you have the time  
I do pick a number too  
I do keep a date with you  
  
Ill take advantage while  
You hang me out to dry  
But I cant see you every night  
Free  
  
I need an easy friend  
I do whip her in to land  
I do think you fit this shoe  
I do wont you have a clue  
  
Ill take advantage while  
You hang me out to dry  
But I cant see you every night  
No I cant see you every night  
Free  
I do  
I do  
I do  
I do
