Move it move it baby  
Cant you see Im ready to dance  
And I cant stop this rhythm in my heart  
Move it move it baby  
Cant you see Im ready to dance  
Without this beat my life would fall apart  
  
Shuffle on your feet till the floor is hot  
Gonna make a lot of money  
Gonna break your heart  
Watch out boy watch out boy  
Shuffle on your feet till the floor is hot  
Gonna make a lot of money  
Gonna break your heart  
  
But Im the only one with a key  
And thats me  
  
Sometimes  
You wake up in the morning with the bass line  
A Ray of Sunshine  
Sometimes  
You know today youre gonna have a good time  
And youre ready to go  
  
Move it move it baby  
Cant you see Im ready to dance  
And I cant keep my rhythm in my heart  
Move it move it baby  
Cant you see Im ready to dance  
Without this beat my life would fall apart  
Shuffle to the beat  
Gonna take a cut  
Theres money in your feet  
Gimme what you got  
  
Watch out boy watch out boy  
Shuffle to the beat  
Gonna take a cut  
Theres money in your feet  
Gonna stitch you up  
  
Any other boy that you see  
But not me  
  
Sometimes  
You wake up in the morning with the bass line  
A Ray of Sunshine  
Sometimes  
You know today youre gonna have a good time  
And youre ready to go  
  
Turn the music up  
Turn the music up turn it up  
Because its all Ive  
All that Ive got  
  
Shuffle to the beat  
Gonna take a cut  
Theres money in your feet  
Gimme what you got  
  
Watch out boy watch out boy  
Shuffle to the beat  
Gonna take a cut  
Theres money in your feet  
Gonna stitch you up  
  
Sometimes  
You wake up in the morning with the bass line  
A Ray of Sunshine  
Sometimes  
You know today youre gonna have a good time  
And youre ready to go
