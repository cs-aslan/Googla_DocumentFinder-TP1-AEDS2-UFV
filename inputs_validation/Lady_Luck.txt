Seveneleven he rolled  
And all his life was a golden gamble  
Youd see him reeling it in when the odds were high  
Something supernatural a charlatan a mastermind  
Or some lucky ladys design  
  
Oh what the devil its fun  
His lady luck was his one companion  
And by the silver and gold  
His heart had been bought and bound  
But he chanced to fall in new love  
He kissed her and he cut the tie  
And kissed his lucky lady goodbye  
  
Oh spin your wheel of fortune  
Shuffle the cards blow on the dice  
Are you with me in love  
Like youve been with me in life  
If I leave you for a lover  
Would you leave me far behind  
  
You shouldve known from the start  
Shed take no part in a love triangle  
You have to be hers alone  
And go it on your own  
Because if youve found a new love  
Lady Luck is gonna step aside  
So kiss your lucky lady goodbye  
  
Spin your wheel of fortune  
Shuffle the cards blow on the dice  
Are you with me in love  
Like youve been with me in life  
If I leave you for an hour  
Would you leave me far behind  
  
Seveneleven he rolled  
And all his life was a golden gamble  
Youd see him reeling it in when the odds were high  
Something supernatural a charlatan was a mastermind  
Or some lucky ladys  
Or some jealous lady  
Kiss your lucky lady goodbye  
Dont pass this way again goodbye  
Dont pass this way again goodbye
