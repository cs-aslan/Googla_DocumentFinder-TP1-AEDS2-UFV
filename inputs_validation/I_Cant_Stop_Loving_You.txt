I cant stop loving you  
Ive made up my mind  
To live in memory of the lonesome times  
I cant stop wanting you  
Its useless to say  
So Ill just live my life in dreams of yesterday  
Dreams of yesterday  
Those happy hours that we once knew  
Tho long ago they still make me blue  
They say that time heals a broken heart  
But time has stood still since weve been apart  
I cant stop loving you  
Ive made up my mind  
To live in memories of the lonesome times  
I cant stop wanting you  
Its useless to say  
So Ill just live my life in dreams of yesterday  
Those happy hours  
Those happy hours  
That we once knew  
That we once knew  
Tho long ago  
Tho long ago  
Still make me blue  
Still maaaake me blue  
They say that time  
They say that time  
Heals a broken heart  
Heals a broken heart  
But time has stood still  
Time has stood still  
Since weve been apart  
Since weve been apart  
I cant stop loving you  
I said I made up my mind  
To live in memory of the lonesome times  
Sing a song children  
I cant stop wanting you  
Its useless to say  
So Ill just live my life of dreams of yesterday  
Of yesterday
