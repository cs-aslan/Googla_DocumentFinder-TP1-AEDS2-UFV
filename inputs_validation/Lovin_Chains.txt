Moved out west just to get away  
Miles of sky and empty space  
Mirrors my soul  
Im out here on my own  
  
I got a new job and a couple new friends  
Theres even someone special  
I think I could start again  
But every time we touch  
It reminds me of us and  
  
Chorus  
Every time I close my eyes  
To go to sleep at night  
I wake up and I see your face  
Even in my dreams  
I cant get anyplace  
I cant shake off your lovin chains  
Your lovin chains  
  
So I moved back east just to face my tears  
To say what needs sayin before you disappear  
But old friends say youre gone  
Long since moved on now  
  
Chorus  
  
I think Im never gonna climb this mountain  
Of my feelings for you  
Im gonna have to live here in your shadow  
Until the skies are no longer blue  
  
Chorus
