When the time comes around  
I want you to know  
You can count on me  
When it all comes down  
Youll know where Ill be  
Standing right next to you  
Cos Ill be true to you  
Ill be true to you  
  
When the days grow dark  
And the winds grow cold  
Ill still be with you  
Im tried and Im tested  
And I wont let you down  
You can count on me  
Because Ill be true to you  
Ill be true to you  
  
This love that Ive found  
It flows like a river  
And its all for you  
The streets of this town  
Speak only one name  
And that name is you  
  
So when the time comes around  
I want you to know  
You can count on me  
When it all comes down  
Youll know where Ill be  
Standing right next to you  
Because Ill be true to you  
Ill be true to you
