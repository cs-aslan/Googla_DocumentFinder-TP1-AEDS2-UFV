Im sick in the mind body and soul  
This way of living has taken its toll  
Im abusing myself but Ill never learn  
I just want to watch this city burn  
  
Theres no turning back once youve turned your back  
  
Im sick of the human race  
Wanna see society laid to waste  
Of the people who destroy more than they create  
Live to kill love to hate  
  
I used to feel sympathy but now its all just apathy  
Ill just turn my back as the world burns all around me  
Am I dying for a change or just dead on the inside  
Maybe I dont look cause Im not sure what Ill find  
So I point the finger at whose to blame  
But deep inside were all the same  
Is this me can it be  
Have I become one of them
