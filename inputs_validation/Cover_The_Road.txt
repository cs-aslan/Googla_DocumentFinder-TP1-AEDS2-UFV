You might say youre pretty  
You might say youre free  
Life may be so easy  
Love may be so free  
Cover the road coverthe road  
Till the end of time  
You might say youre ugly  
You might say youre chained  
Life may be so dreary  
Love may be sa shame  
Cover the road coverthe road  
Till the end of time  
Cover the road coverthe road  
Till the end of time  
Life is a highway  
Youre sitting on the wheel  
And you decide to speed  
Here is the easy and there is the hard way  
Its either one  
Cover the road   
You might say youre ugly  
You might say youre chained  
Its inside your heart lady  
Where the battle is won  
Cover the road
