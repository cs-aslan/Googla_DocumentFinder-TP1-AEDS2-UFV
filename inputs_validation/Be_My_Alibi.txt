  
A life of crimes not easy sometimes you need some help  
Someone to share the risks with and to help you spend the wealth  
Some one to run the shredder or to help you dig a hole  
But lying on the witness stands the most important role  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I cant help what I do  
You know Id do the same for you  
Be my alibi  
Where was I on the fifth of May  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi  
When I come home at night With blood up to my elbows  
Skin beneath my fingernails and brains stuck to my toes  
Lets get the story straight because the cops are on their way  
Just sit tight and listen and Ill tell you what to say  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I cant help what I do  
You know Id do the same for you  
Be my alibi  
Where was I on the fifth of May  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi  
Dont ask any question about the money in the closet  
Youll get your share later just foget you ever saw it  
Share and share alike thats the way its gotta be  
Even if its gonna make you an accessory  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I cant help what I do  
You know Id do the same for you  
Be my alibi  
Where was I on the fifth of May  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi  
Im gonna be indicted for that last bank robbery  
Youve got to tell the jury that it really wasnt me  
Just remember what to say when youre on the stand  
Im sure that everything will go exactly like we planned  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I cant help what I do  
You know Id do the same for you  
Be my alibi  
Where was I on the fifth of May  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi  
Be my alibi
