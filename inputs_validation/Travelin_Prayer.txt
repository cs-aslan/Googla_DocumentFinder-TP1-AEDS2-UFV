Hey Lord take a look all around  
And Id a find where my babys gonna be  
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight  
Cause she is far across the sea  
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight  
And make sure that shes gonna be alright  
And things are gonna be alright with me  
  
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight  
And make sure that all her dreams are sweet  
Said now would ya guide her on the roads  
And make them softer for her feet  
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight  
And make sure that shes gonna be alright  
Until shes home and here with me  
  
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight  
If she is sleepin under the sky  
Said now make sure the ground shes sleepin on  
Is always warm and dry  
Um dontcha give her too much rain  
Try to keep her away from pain  
Because my baby hates to cry  
  
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight  
Cause it gets rough along the way  
Said now this song seems strange is just because  
I dont know how to pray  
Um wontcha give her peace of mind  
And if you ever find the time  
Wontcha tell her I miss her everyday  
  
Hey Lord take a look all around  
And Id afind where my babys gonna be  
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight  
Cause she is far across the sea  
Hey Lord would ya look out for her tonight  
And make sure that shes gonna be alright  
Until shes home and here with me  
With me
