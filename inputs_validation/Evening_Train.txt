Love to hear that evening train go by  
Love to hear that evening train go by  
Specially when my babys in my mind  
  
Love to hear that lonesome whistle blow  
Love to hear that lonesome whistle blow  
When I make my way on down the road  
  
My my  
Bye bye  
Dont cry  
Dont sigh  
When you hear that evening train go by  
  
Love to hear that evening train on time  
Love to hear that evening train on time  
Specially when those worries are on my mind  
  
My my  
Dont cry  
Why why  
Dont sigh  
When you hear that evening train go by  
  
Love to see those fields I used to roam  
Love to see those fields I used to roam  
Then I know Im on my way back home  
  
My my  
Goodbye  
Dont cry  
Dont sigh  
When you hear that evening train go by  
  
When you hear that evening train go by
