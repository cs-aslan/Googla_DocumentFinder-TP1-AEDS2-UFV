Be what you want to be  
See what you came to see  
Been what you want to be  
I dont like what I see  
  
Like the coldest winter chill  
Heaven beside you hell within  
Like the coldest winter chill  
Heaven beside you hell within  
  
Like the coldest winter will  
Heaven beside you hell within  
And you think you have it still heaven inside you  
So theres problems in your life  
  
Thats fucked up and Im not blind  
Im just see through faded super jaded  
And out of my mind  
Do what you want to do  
  
Go out and seek your truth  
When Im down and blue  
Rather be me than you  
Like the coldest winter chill  
  
Heaven beside you hell within  
Like the coldest winter chill  
Heaven beside you hell within  
Like the coldest winter will  
  
Heaven beside you hell within  
And you wish you had it still heaven inside you  
So theres problems in your life  
Thats fucked up and Im not blind  
  
Im just see through faded super jaded  
And out of my mind  
Like the coldest winter chill  
Heaven beside you hell within  
  
Like the coldest winter chill  
Heaven beside you hell within  
Like the coldest winter will  
Heaven beside you hell within  
  
And you know you have it still heaven inside you  
So theres problems in your life  
Thats fucked up but youre not blind  
Youre just see through faded overrated  
  
And out of your mind
