Heroes dont cry  
Heroes dont cry  
  
Standing here in front of you  
A wave of joy and sadness fills the room  
Your soul has crashed into a wall  
Your world just broke to pieces after all  
  
The days of your life  
Leave the world standing outside  
But you find the strength for a smile  
Because heroes like you wouldnt cry  
  
Heroes dont cry  
Heroes dont cry  
  
The judge decided its your right  
To wake up from the dream of your life  
The curtain is about to fall  
No need for words your eyes just say it all  
  
The days of your life  
Leave the world standing outside  
You find the strength for a smile  
Because heroes like you wouldnt cry  
  
Heroes dont cry  
  
There are days of your life  
Leave the world standing outside  
You find the strength for a smile  
Because heroes like you wouldnt cry  
  
Heroes dont cry  
  
I cant forget that afternoon  
So many times Ive been thinking of you  
Im happy that youve decided to live  
And what touches me most is what you said  
Heaven can wait can wait can wait
