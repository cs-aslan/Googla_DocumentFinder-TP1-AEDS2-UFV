Bye bye baby take me on a highway  
This time it could be heaven  
Even for a little while didnt want to miss you  
Maybe I can make you feel fine  
I dont know what you want me to do  
But Im losing control of my senses  
And I know Ive been counting on you  
Just to show that you really care  
I can see that your star is ascending over me  
But I dont wanna go there  
Cause Im feeling so scared  
Ive had enough of this love  
And you calling the shots outta thin air  
And Im full of emotion  
When you dont believe me  
Cause baby here comes a crash  
And Im dying inside when you leave me  
I dont know what youre putting me through  
But it seems that the party is over  
In and out of love with you  
And I think that Im losing my mind  
I can see that your star is ascending over me  
But I dont wanna go there  
Cause Im feeling so scared  
Ive had enough of this love  
And you calling the shots outta thin air  
And Im full of emotion  
When you dont believe me  
Cause baby here comes a crash  
And Im dying inside when you leave me  
But I dont wanna go there  
Cause Im feeling so scared  
Ive had enough of this love  
And you calling the shots outta thin air  
And Im full of emotion  
When you dont believe me  
Cause baby here comes a crash  
And Im dying inside when you leave me  
But I dont wanna go there  
Cause Im feeling so scared  
Ive had enough of this love  
And you calling the shots outta thin air
