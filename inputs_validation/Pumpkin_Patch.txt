Chorus  
Pumpkin patch pumpkin patch  
Headin out to the pumpkin patch  
Pumpkin patch pumpkin patch  
Headin out to the pumpkin patch  
  
Pumpkins are pretty sneaky they like to hide in the fields  
Under a leaf under a bush they keep perfectly still  
Its a good thing that theyre orange or theyd be hard to see  
Gonna catch me one of them pumpkins a special one for me  
  
Chorus  
  
Pumpkins arent very scary unless you give them a face  
A smile or a frown eyes up or down teeth all over the place  
Gonna carve me one of them pumpkins put a candle inside to burn  
Then instead of a pumpkin itll be a jack olantern  
  
Hey hey Im goin today hay ride hang on  
Hey hey what can I say  
Gotta catch em before theyre gone  
  
Chorus  
So if you happen to see a pumpkin  
When youre out on halloween night  
Dont stop and stare you better beware  
Hell give you an awful fright  
Just keep on trick or treating dont even say hello  
He might jump up and follow you home  
You just never know  
  
Chorus
