Youre one of a kind  
I gotta have ya  
Well youre one of a kind  
I need to have ya  
Right from the start  
You tore me apart  
You took the best part of my heart  
Body and soul  
You took me out of control  
You stole the best part of my heart  
Youre one of a kind  
Youve got magic  
I know youre one of a kind  
Baby youre static  
Right from the start  
You tore me apart  
You took the best part of my heart  
Body and soul  
You took me out of control  
You stole the best part of my heart  
Right from the start  
You tore me apart  
You took the best part of my heart  
Body and soul  
You took me out of control  
You stole the best part of my heart
