When I feel as though my love is sinking down the sun doesnt want to shine  
When it feels like she wont face another day life is unkind shes frozen in
time  
And here comes another grey morning A not so good morning after all  
She says well what am I to do today with too much time and so much sorrow  
  
She hears the baby waking up downstairs  
She hears the foghorn calling out across the sound  
Repetition in the morning air is just too much to bear and no one seems to
care  
If another day goes creeping by empty and ashamed  
Like an old unwanted memory that no one will claim  
The clouds with their heads on the ground shes gonna have to come down  
  
She said move me move me Im locked up inside  
Well I didnt understand her though God knows I tried  
She said make me angry but just make me cry  
But no more grey morning I think Id rather die
