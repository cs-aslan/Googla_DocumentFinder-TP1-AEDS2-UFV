Youre the one that makes my day a dream come true  
Yet and still you wander if I think of you  
You ought to see how the other girls behave when youre not round  
And only then you would know that its on your finger Im wound  
  
If you were there youd know  
If you were there youd know  
If you were there youd know  
If you were there youd know  
That I care  
  
Theres no need for you not to have faith in me no  
Cause its by your side girl that I long to be  
Yes there are times with my friends when I dont have much to say  
What you dont know is with you I can never act that way  
  
If you were there youd know  
If you were there youd know  
If you were there youd know  
If you were there youd know  
That I care  
  
I care for you baby  
I swear that I care  
I care  
  
Theres no need for you not to have faith in me  
Have faith in me  
I care for you baby
