Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
Living now here but for fortune  
Placed by fates mysterious schemes  
Whod believe that were the ones asked  
To try to rekindle the patriots dreams  
Arise sweet destiny time runs short  
All of your patience has heard their retort  
Hear us now for alone we cant seem  
To try to rekindle the patriots dreams  
Can you hear the words being whispered  
All along the American stream  
Tyrants freed the just are imprisoned  
Try to rekindle the patriots dreams  
Ah but perhaps too much is being asked of too few  
You and your children with nothing to do  
Hear us now for alone we cant seem  
To try to rekindle the patriots dreams
