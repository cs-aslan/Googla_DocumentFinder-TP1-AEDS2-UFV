Born in 1963  
In the shadow of Kennedy  
Im still a kid when the levee breaks  
Man oh man thats all it takes  
  
And Im on my way  
  
Boy youre not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
If you walk across those railroad tracks  
Son youre on your own  
But all I know is what I feel and it cant be wrong  
Boy youre not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
Where you come from  
Its just not done  
  
Back in black and Im 17  
Ive been told son let it be  
I got these lines upon my face now  
A room at the heartbreak hotel  
Yeah yeah  
  
Oh well oh well  
Ah yeah  
  
Boy youre not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
If you walk across those railroad tracks  
Son youre on your own  
All I know is what I feel and it cant be wrong  
Boy youre not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
Where you come from  
Its just not done  
  
Oh well oh well  
Alright  
  
Boy youre not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
If you walk across those railroad tracks  
Son youre on your own  
But all I know is what I feel and it cant be wrong  
Boy youre not supposed to sing the blues  
  
Where you come from  
Where you come from  
Its just not done
