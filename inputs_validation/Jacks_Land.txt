Stop the night the night  
My thoughts get louder after dark  
Oh the lies  
The crazies tell me this much  
Aha  
  
Its a simple enough task boys  
To find a living miracle  
But the living aint easy  
I need a shot of medecine  
  
Start the day the day  
My head denies Im breathing  
It likes to say  
Am I here or leaving me  
  
Theres a want I ask all the time  
Possesion of my right mind  
Youre not deaf but I still have to shout  
Watch out theres a lot of thieves about  
  
All along the way  
I stand beside myself  
And look at all my world  
No need to tell me  
  
I see dead men playing  
I hear cries from many  
I hear tears and then some  
I hear hop Im hoping  
  
Im caught with all the shutters down  
Whos looking through my window  
I had to close the saddest eyes  
  
Youve got to be a winner  
Youve got to be cool  
  
I see me inside you  
I hear fear and then some  
I see children playing  
I see hope Im hoping  
  
Far away  
I hear a memory calling me  
Id like to stay  
But my obsession wants to play
