Who do you think youre talkin to  
You know me and I know you  
Your silence and your stony face  
You dont have the ground to waste  
Your love is gone cause it all comes down to you  
What can we say when all is said  
A house divided cannot stand  
Your head and heart and chary gaze  
Life is just too short to waste  
Your love is gone cause it all comes down to you  
Ive paid for you and you dont seem to mind  
Im bending over backwards youre not satisfied  
What more can I offer to leave pon the alter  
Your love is gone cause it all comes down to you  
What can we do when all is done  
Your lifes not the only one  
Just take a look beyond yourself  
The reason of your private hell  
Your love is gone cause it all comes down to you  
Ive paid for you and you dont seem to mind  
Im bending over backwards youre not satisfied  
What more can I offer to leave pon the alter  
Your love is gone cause it all comes down to you
