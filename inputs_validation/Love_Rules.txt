Every day you pass her in the hall  
You just pretend that you dont see her at all  
You want to tell her how much you care  
You want to call her but you just dont dare  
Love rules  
Love rules  
  
Out in the parking lot with all the guys  
Dont ever let them see the tears in your eyes  
Shes got a date tonight and it aint you  
So you go out there and you get one too  
Love rules  
Love rules  
Love rules  
Love rules  
  
You wish you didnt have so much to feel  
Its much too scary and its all too real  
All your friends are out having fun  
Sometimes you think that youre the only one that  
Love rules  
Oh love rules  
  
While everybodys out making time  
You cant help thinking youre the last in line  
Shes the finest thing youve ever seen  
You wrap your arms around her in your dreams  
When she smiles it brings you to your knees  
You want to tell her but you always freeze  
Shes in the backseat but youre much too shy  
Youd give the world to be an older guy  
Love rules  
Love rules  
Love rules  
Yeah love still rules  
Love rules  
Love rules
