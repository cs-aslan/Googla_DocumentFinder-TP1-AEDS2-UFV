I dont know how many stars there are  
Up in the heavenly sky  
I only know my heaven is here on earth  
Each time you look into my eyes  
  
The way you do baby  
Thank you thank you baby  
  
My beautiful bird you have flown away  
I held you too tight I can see  
  
Youre all I need to get by  
No one else can make me cry  
The way you do baby  
  
You are the book that I read each day  
You are the song that I sing gonna sing it to you  
You are the four seasons of my life  
  
But maybe tomorrow youll change your mind girl  
Maybe tomorrow youll come back to my arms girl  
  
Maybe  
Youre all I need to get by  
No one else can make me cry  
The way you do baby  
  
You are the book that I read each day  
You are the song that I sing gonna sing it to you  
You are the four seasons of my life  
  
But maybe tomorrow youll change your mind girl  
Maybe tomorrow youll come back to my arms girl  
  
You are the book that I read each day  
You are the song that I sing  
You are the four seasons of my life  
  
But maybe tomorrow youll change your mind girl  
Maybe tomorrow youll come back to my arms girl  
  
You are the book that I read each day yeah  
You are the song that I sing gonna sing it to you  
You are the four seasons of my life  
  
But maybe tomorrow youll change your mind girl  
Maybe tomorrow youll come back to my arms girl  
  
Oh honey I need you  
You are the song that I sing  
You are the four seasons of my life  
  
But maybe tomorrow youll change your mind girl  
Maybe tomorrow youll come back to my arms girl  
  
You are the same girl I see
