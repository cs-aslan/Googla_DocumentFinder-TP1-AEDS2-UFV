Too bad I dont get my own way  
Want champagne all they got is cabernet  
And Im wastin all my time  
I feel good but theres a tear in my eye  
Rain fallin from a cloudless sky  
  
I get high forget about it all  
Red lights flashin behind my cracked up rearview mirror  
Thunder crashin down and screamin in my ear  
I guess I drew a bad card somewhere down the line  
  
And I never win my money all back  
Im only here for a limited time  
Probably see me hangin around by the railroad tracks  
I get high  
  
We used to have a house down by the shore  
Every night wed take a walk to the liquor store  
And wed get wasted all the time  
I hit the city when I lost ya girl  
Not so pretty its a different world  
  
I get high forget about it all  
Red lights flashin behind my cracked up rearview mirror  
Thunder crashin down and screamin in my ear  
I guess I drew a bad card somewhere down the line  
  
And I never win my money all back  
Im only here for a limited time  
And then I got a bag to pack  
  
Im goin down  
Im goin down  
Im goin down  
Im goin down  
  
Too bad I dont get my own way  
Maybe you and me can try to get together some day  
Because Im wastin all my time  
I feel good but theres a tear in my eye  
Rain fallin from a cloudless sky  
  
I get high forget about it all  
I get high forget about it all  
I get high forget about it all
