Mhmmm Mhmmm Owwww Yeahhhhhh  
  
Well I can summon up my courage Take on the whole world Turn around and
break down just like a little girl And I come out swingin when my backs
against the wall  
  
And my Mama always told me better walk before you crawl I need a man who can
love all the women I am  
  
Im a mother of lost causes A sister of the road I give my heart to a song
but I never sell my soul Im good at keeping it together when the edges start
to fray  
  
When Im sewing up the loose ends of everyday I need a man who can love all
the women I am  
  
Sometimes Im hard to handle Burn hotter than a candle but I melt in the
right hands Boy you love without condition It aint always easy livin with
all the women I am  
  
Im a daughter of the red dirt Okie dust still in my bones But I can light
up New York City with my red hair and rhinestones Ill still be my Mamas
baby when my babies fly away My moods change like the weather but my faith
it stays the same  
  
I need a man who can stand all the women I am I need a man who can love all
the women I am  
  
Sometimes Im hard to handle Burn hotter than a candle but I melt in the
right hands Boy you love without condition It aint always easy livin with
all the women I am  
  
Hey Im a realist Im a dreamer Im a silver linin seeker Im a devil or
an angel who come running when you need her  
  
Cause I need a man who can love all the women I am Ohh I want a man who can
love all the women I am Hey youre a man who can love all the women I am
Youre the man I needed all along You can handle me baby All the women I am
Yeah youre the man All the women I am
