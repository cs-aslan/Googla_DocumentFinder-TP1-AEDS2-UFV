Well I finally found somebody  
Who lives to give their love to me only me  
She takes away my worries  
Shows me how true loves meant to be what a relief  
  
Now love dont have to be a ball and chain  
Or somebody pullin on a puppet string  
Danglin you around  
Like you got no mind all  
  
Love dont fade when the dog days come  
And hangs in tough til it sees the sun  
And I finally found somebody who  
Lets that love light shine on through  
  
Well I finally found somebody  
Who welcomes me with open arms into their heart  
Thank God my search is over  
I found a fourleaf clover love took me long enough  
  
Now love dont have to be a ball and chain  
Or somebody pullin on a puppet string  
Danglin you around  
Like you got no mind all  
  
Love dont fade when the dog days come  
And hangs in tough til it sees the sun  
And I finally found somebody who  
Lets that love light shine on through  
  
Lets that love light shine on through  
Well I finally found somebody  
Well I finally found somebody  
I finally found somebody  
I finally found somebody
