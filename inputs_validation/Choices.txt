Chorus  
Ive had choices  
Since the day that I was born  
There were voices  
That told me right from wrong  
If I had listened  
No I wouldnt be here today  
Living and dying  
With the choices I made  
  
I was tempted  
By an early age I found  
I liked drinkin  
Oh and I never turned it down  
There were loved ones  
But I turned them all away  
Now Im living and dying  
With the choices I made  
  
Chorus  
  
I guess Im payin  
For the things that I have done  
If I could go back  
Oh Lord knows Id run  
But Im still losin  
This game of life I play  
Living and dying  
With the choices I made  
  
Chorus  
  
Living and dying  
With the choices I made
