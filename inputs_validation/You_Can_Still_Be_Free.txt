Cool breeze and autumn leaves  
Slow motion daylight  
A lone pair of watchful eyes  
Oversee the living  
Feel the presence all around  
A tortured soul  
A wound unhealing  
No regrets or promises  
The past is gone  
But you can still be free  
If time will set you free  
  
Time now to spread your wings  
To take to flight  
The life endeavor  
Aim for the burning sun  
Youll be trapped inside  
But you can still be free  
If time will set you free  
But its a long long way to go  
  
Keep moving way up high  
You see the light  
It shines forever  
Sail through the crimson skies  
The purest light  
The light that sets you free  
If time will set you free  
Sail through the wind and rain tonight  
Youre free to fly tonight  
And you can still be free  
And going higher than mountain tops  
And go high the wind dont stop  
And go high  
Free to fly tonight  
Free to fly tonight
