It burns into your heart the darkness that you fear  
You were never free and you never realized  
And love is a word youve never heard  
Your heart is cold cause it burns the desire to leave the mind  
  
Take your breath til nothings left  
Stars of life upon your chest  
And I know you wherever you go  
  
And we run and we dont look back  
And we run til weve had enough  
And we run tell me how to run  
And we run til we break down  
And we run til we fall apart  
And we run til weve had enough  
  
Dont blink youll miss it  
Lift up your head We gotta get gone  
Yeah we outta here  
Dont blink youll miss it  
Lift up your head  
Too late we gone  
Yeah we outta here  
  
And we run for this killing love  
And we run tell me how its enough  
And we run far ahead we go  
  
Ima break these chains ran through the rain  
Never looked back never quit worked through the pain  
This blood in my veins run cold when I hate  
Give enough to keep sane but I never lose hope  
This is my time now no time for tears to celebrate  
Put it in the air right now  
Never back down youll never wear my crown  
cause it weighs too much and I crush every motherfucking thing I touch  
This is what Ive never loved so much  
Get involved whats the worst stand up  
Here my mic before I ever get far  
Man in lights you lost all my trust  
Now its time to face all of us  
Get in line just to spar with us  
And it feels so far from us just take my hand and run  
  
And we run for this killing love  
And we run tell me how its enough  
And we run til we never don  
And we run til we fall apart  
And we run til its enough  
  
Yeah we out of here  
  
Dont blink youll miss it  
Lift up your head  
We gotta get gone  
Yeah we outta here  
Dont blink youll miss it  
Lift up your head  
Too late we gone  
Yeah we outta here  
  
And we run for this killing love  
And we run tell me how its enough  
And we run til we never don  
And we run til we fall apart  
And we run til its enough  
  
Dont blink youll miss it  
Lift up your head  
We gotta get gone  
Yeah we outta here  
Dont blink youll miss it  
Lift up your head  
Too late we gone  
Yeah we outta here
