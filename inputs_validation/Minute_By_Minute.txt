Hey dont you worry Ive been lied to  
Ive been here many times before  
Girl dont you worry I know where I stand  
I dont need this love I dont need your hand  
I know I could turn blink and youd be gone  
Then I must be prepared any time to carry on  
  
Chorus  
But minute by minute by minute by minute  
I keep holding on  
Oh minute by minute by minute by minute  
I keep holding on  
  
You would stay just to watch me darlin  
Wilt away on lies from you  
Cant stop the habit of livin on the run  
I take it all for granted like youre the only one  
  
Livin on my own  
Somehow that sounds nice  
You think Im you fool  
Well you may just be right  
  
Chorus  
  
Call my name and Ill be gone  
Youll reach out and I wont be there  
Just my luck youll realize  
You should spend your life with someone  
You could spend your life with someone  
  
Chorus
