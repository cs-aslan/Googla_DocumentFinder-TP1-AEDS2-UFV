Oh spring is here and love is in the air  
Overflowing with life and I dont have a care  
Im gonna see you shining like your diamond ring  
Every cell in our body is singing  
  
Gimme your love forever  
Gimme your love  
Gimme your love forever  
Oh oh gimme your love gimme your love  
  
All around I see signs of rebirth  
Resurrection renewal celebration of life on earth  
Baby wont you stay with me and watch your garden grow  
I love you I want you please say youll  
  
Gimme your love forever  
Gimme your love  
Gimme your love forever  
Oh oh gimme your love gimme your love  
  
People think Im crazy as I walk along the street  
I dont understand em anyway  
All I know is since you came my life has been so sweet  
And thats the way I know its gonna stay  
  
Baby wont you stay with me and watch your garden grow  
I love you I want you please stay youll  
  
Gimme your love forever  
Gimme your love  
Gimme your love forever  
Oh oh gimme your love gimme your love
