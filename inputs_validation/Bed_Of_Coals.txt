Ive been lying on a bed of coals  
Ive been crying out of control  
I roll and I tumble  
Every time I come down  
  
Im too old to die young  
And too young to die now  
Ive been sleeping on a bed of nails  
Ive been bleeding it never fails  
  
I feel every needle  
That pierced through my heart  
  
Chorus  
Im too old to die young  
And I cant play the part  
Bed of coals  
Bed of nails  
Through the smoke  
Behind the veils  
Bed of coals  
Bed of nails  
Through the smoke  
Behind the veils  
  
Ive been lying in a bed of shame  
Ive been dying all alone  
I pray for the power  
To turn it around  
  
Chorus
