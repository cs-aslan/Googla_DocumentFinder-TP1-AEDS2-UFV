Could be  
Who knows  
There something due any day  
I will know right away  
Soon as it shows  
  
It may come cannonballin down from the sky  
Gleam in its eye  
Bright as a rose  
Who knows  
  
Its only just out of reach  
Down a block on the beach  
Under a tree  
I got a feeling theres a miracle due  
Gotta come through  
Coming to me  
  
Could it be  
Yes it could  
Somethings coming  
Something good  
If I can wait  
  
Somethings coming  
I dont know what it is  
But it is  
Going to be great  
  
With a click  
With a shock  
Bell will jingle  
Door will knock  
Open the latch  
  
Somethings coming  
I dont know what it is  
But it is  
Going to be great  
  
Around the corner  
Awhistlin down the river  
Come on deliver  
To me  
To me  
  
Could be  
Who knows  
There something due any day  
I will know right away  
Soon as it shows  
  
It may come cannonballin down from the sky  
Gleam in its eye  
Bright as a rose  
Who knows  
  
Its only just out of reach  
Down a block on the beach  
Under a tree  
I got a feeling theres a miracle due  
Gotta come through  
Coming to me  
To me  
  
Tonight Tonight  
Wont be just any night  
Tonight there will be no morning star  
  
Tonight
