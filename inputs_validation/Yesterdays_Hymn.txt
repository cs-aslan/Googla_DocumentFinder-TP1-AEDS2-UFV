K J Garside C Gray  
Ten planes falling from the sky  
The setting sun leaves no trace  
My name was written in the sky  
But now there is no trace  
Yesterdays hymn serves me not  
Tick tock tick tock tick tock  
Shadow faces reaching for me  
Pretending they know whats best for me  
But I know that I am their experiment  
I scare myself with paranoid talk  
Yesterdays hymn serves me not  
Tick tock tick tock tick tock  
I try to keep the whispered words at bay  
For they seem to feed into the mire  
Ive lost all ability to make any choices  
Im teetering in purgatory  
Yesterdays hymn serves me not  
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
