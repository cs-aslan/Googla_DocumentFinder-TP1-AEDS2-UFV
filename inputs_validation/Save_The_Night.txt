A little trouble in the city  
Trouble in my home  
She told me love dont live here anymore  
I wanna run to the light  
Its too dark in this part of night  
I need somebody who can make it right  
  
And its on tonight  
How about we go and save the night  
I can see you want it and so do I  
How about we go and save the night  
Lets save the night  
  
Im not a one man band  
I want to sing a duet  
You and me would sound much better  
You look so good in my bed  
And if your gonna go out  
Your gonna go on with a bang  
Lets save the night Ill be your superman  
  
And its on tonight  
How about we go and save the night  
I can see you want it and so do I  
How about we go and save the night  
Lets save the night  
  
I see the night flashing before her eyes  
Resuscitating bring it back to life  
  
And its on tonight  
How about we go and save the night  
I can see you want it and so do I  
How about we go and save the night  
Lets save the night  
  
Oh lets save the night  
Lets save the night
