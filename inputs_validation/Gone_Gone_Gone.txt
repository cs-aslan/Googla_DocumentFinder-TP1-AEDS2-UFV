Been living underwater but I sure dug the sea  
But noone could hear me out when I leant back to scream  
Coming through the shelves to live in the dirt  
To keep from the sun to keep from getting hurt  
Gettin gone  
You got a lot to learn  
Ahh got a lot to learn from getting  
Gone gone gone  
Been feeding on contributions from the folks on the bridge  
Throw the scraps on out when they need a trip  
So I flap my tail and give a highpitched squeak  
Just so they could leave me in between the rocks to sleep  
Gettin gone  
I wasted so much time that I  
Oh wouldnt swap the line of getting  
Gone gone gone  
You got a lot to learn  
Ahh got a lot to learn from getting  
Gone gone gone  
I dont know where the sadness starts  
Coz Im so happy I could die  
Just give me long enough to live  
Yeah an its only when I fly  
I wasted so much time that I  
Oh wouldnt swap the line of getting  
Gone gone gone  
You got a lot to learn  
Ahh got a lot to learn from getting  
Gone gone gone
