Oh Somewhere There Is A Chance For Me  
I Said To My Friends And Family  
Its A Long And Lonely Road To Southern Chelsea  
And Somewhere Theres A Love For Me  
  
I Want To Find My Own Reality  
Its A Long And Lonely Road To Southern Chelsea  
Tell Me Theres A Heaven  I Know Thats Its No Dream  
Sometimes Im High And Low Girl  And Sometimes Inbetween  
  
Tell Me How You Mend A Broken Heart  
I Dont want to Be The Lonely Eye  
Tell Me How I Find A Brand New Start  
I Will Never Be A Heart Survivor  
I Will Make My Dreams Come True  
Oh I Will Try  Just For Me And You  
  
Its All Or Nothing  Forever Girl  
I Said Goodbye To My Old Old World  
Its A Long And Lonely Road To Southern Chelsea  
And Somewhere More Than Thousand Miles Away  
  
Ill Find My Heart  But I Have To Say  
Its A Long And Lonely Road To Southern Chelsea  
I Will Find My Heaven  Im Halfway To My Dream  
I See A Tiny River  Like In An Old Old Movie Scene
