I I can hear you laughing  
Youre a million miles away or youre here  
I I will never leave you  
Im a million miles away or Im near  
I I the thoughts youre thinking  
But youre a lifetime away from your home or youre here  
I I can see you crying  
Youre a million miles away or youre here  
Look at me like I look at you  
Think of me like I think of you  
Speak to me like I speak to you  
Dream of me like I dream of you  
I I can hear you thinking  
Youre a million thoughts away  
I Im the dreams youre dreaming  
Im a million dreams away or Im here  
We can go down slowly like the rain  
I could leave and be with you again oh  
I could be your lover lets pretend
