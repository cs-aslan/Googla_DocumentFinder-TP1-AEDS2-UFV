Oh we was dancing in a really big city  
Got excited by the sound of a party  
Now my heart beat while the music was groovin  
And if you wanted to you couldnt keep from movin  
Look around do you believe what you seein  
The walls are movin the ceilings areelin  
Couples over in the corner romancin  
  
Oh the boys are with me to do some outta sight dancin  
Gotta girl givin me some lessons  
And now shes gonna be my confession  
Arent you glad we found our way in here  
Put another record up on the player  
  
Hey theres a stoned party dancin with the police  
Dont have to worry about disturbing the peace  
Met a fine chick that really got to me  
Good Lord how she boogalooed to me  
Oh my how she boogalooed it to me  
Come on sock it sock it to me  
  
SOCK IT to me
