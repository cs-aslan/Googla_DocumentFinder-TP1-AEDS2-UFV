You see me sitting here  
A smile upon my face  
The time has come but you know that its not too late  
Theres been too many things  
Together we have seen  
Its not that hard if we start to believe  
And were not gonna take anymore  
Can we try to erase all the pain  
So please  
  
Chorus  
Show me a reason give me a sign  
Tell me the way we fall out of line  
Is it today or is it tonight well find  
The answer to our life  
  
This world is not at ease  
We seem to hide the truth  
Thinking theres only so much we can really do  
Its up to you and me  
To fix our destiny  
The jurys here so lets take the stand  
And were not gonna take anymore  
Can we try to erase all the pain  
So please  
  
Chorus  
  
So tell me why we have to cry and not try  
When theres so many things we can do  
To help this troubled world start anew  
  
I need a reason I need a sign  
Theres no turning back Im here by your side  
Is it today or maybe tonight well find  
The answer to our life  
  
Show me the way  
Give me a sign  
Tell me the way we fall out of line  
Is it today is it tonight  
The answer to our life  
  
Chorus
