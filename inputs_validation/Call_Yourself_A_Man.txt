Everybodys laughin loud as it can be  
But please dont point your finger especially not at me  
Cause Im not tryin to be somebody just do what I can  
But you just keep on laughin call yourself a man  
Im not lookin for somebody to defend my case  
Ive been scorned by more than one so stop this paper chase  
  
If you cant accept me just for what I am  
Go ahead reject me call yourself a man  
Tell me who youre foolin is it not yourself  
Go ahead be cool and Ill just be myself  
And if you cant accept me just for what I am  
Go ahead reject me call yourself a man
