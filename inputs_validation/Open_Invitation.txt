You be you and let me be me  
No strings attached emotionally  
I want to get a little crazy  
Thats puttin it plain  
You got the medicine and I got the pain  
  
When you just want to feel good  
Like the doctor said  
One good dose of loving  
Its gonna straighten out your head  
  
You got an open invitation  
On that you can rely  
You got a prepaid reservation  
And thats the only way to fly  
  
Lets make love the feeling is right  
Just passing by like ships in the night  
Oughta get a little friendly  
Theres no time like now  
You bring the attitude and Ill show you how  
  
Anytime youre ready  
Anytime at all  
Just come on over  
Dont even have to call
