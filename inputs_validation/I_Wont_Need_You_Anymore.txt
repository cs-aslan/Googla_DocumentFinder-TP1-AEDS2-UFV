Youre my always and forever  
Youre the one that hung the moon  
After all these nights together  
I still get lost in your perfume  
And if I could write a love song  
Every line would tell the truth  
It would be a warm and soft one  
And my heart would say to you  
  
When you see me walk on water  
When the sea dont reach the shore  
When the fires of hell freeze over  
I wont need you anymore  
  
Oh the feelings lay so easy  
Lyin here the way we are  
No one else could ever hold me  
Like the heavens hold the stars  
  
When you see me walk on water  
When the sea dont reach the shore  
When the fires of hell freeze over  
  
I wont need you anymore  
I wont need you anymore
