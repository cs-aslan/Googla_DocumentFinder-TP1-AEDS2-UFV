Wake up in the middle of the night  
And the air is so heavy  
And my heads screwed on too tight  
In the glow of the Christmas lights  
I watch you sleep  
  
And the hands on the cigarette clock are just  
Time ticking away this love I got  
Theres no way to make it stop before you wake  
  
Well I know youre leaving me  
This is not the way that I  
Was brought up to believe that it would be  
Yeah I know youre leaving me  
Im running round in circles trying to figure out  
Just who Im supposed to be  
  
We go down to Prospect Park  
To watch the light become the dark  
And I dont think Ive ever been this scared  
Outside as the double moon rises  
I know this time it wont surprise us  
But that dont mean that I will be prepared  
  
I know youre leaving me  
This is not the way that I  
Was brought up to believe that it would be  
Yeah I know youre leaving me  
Im running round in circles trying to figure out  
Just who Im supposed to be  
  
So tired of writing sad songs  
But my minds on misery  
I know theres time until youre gone  
I cant let it be  
No I cant let it be  
  
I know youre leaving me  
This is not the way that I  
Was brought up to believe that it would be  
Yeah I know youre leaving me  
Im running round in circles trying to figure out  
Just who Im supposed to be  
Just who Im supposed to be  
Just who Im supposed to be  
Just who Im supposed to be  
Oh
