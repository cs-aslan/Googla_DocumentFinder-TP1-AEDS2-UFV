Love  
Is it true  
What they say of you  
  
Gonna call the President  
Gonna call a private eye  
Gonna get the IRS  
Gonna need the FBI  
  
Theres not anymore that I can do  
All the reasons that you give  
I follow you  
So when you lead them in thatll be the end of time its true  
  
Wouldnt be the first time Ive been wrong  
Wouldnt be the last Im sure Ive known  
With all the rumors I can tell  
Some things didnt work so well  
  
Well anyway it feels the same  
  
As when you first told me you were gone  
So long ago but I still held on  
Through all the emotions that Ive had to take  
And thats the truth and heres the worst yet  
  
Wouldnt even matter the things that I say  
Youve made your mind up and gone anyway  
And theres no use now in dragging it on  
Shouldve seen it coming all along  
  
Well its true oh I had  
My doubts of you  
  
Gonna call the President  
Gonna call myself a private eye  
Gonna need the IRS  
Gonna get the FBI  
  
Gonna make this a federal case  
Gonna wave it right down in your face  
Read it baby with your morning news  
With a sweet hangover  
And the headlines too now  
  
I bet you think Im doing this all for my health  
I shouldve looked again then at somebody else  
Feelin like Ive done way more than wrong  
Feelin like Im livin inside of this song  
Feelin like Im just too tired to care  
Feelin like Ive done more than my share  
Couldve been the way that I carried on  
Like a broken record for so long  
  
And I do  
Oh oh  
Im gonna call the President  
Im gonna call a private eye  
Gonna get the IRS  
Gonna need myself the FBI  
  
Oh what shall I do  
If I gave my heart to you  
Its such a crime you know its true  
  
Gonna call the president  
Gonna need myself a private eye  
Ooh gonna need the IRS  
Gonna get the FBI  
  
Gonna make it a federal case  
Gonna wave it right down in your face  
Read it baby with your morning news  
With the sweet hangover and the headlines too  
  
Theres not anymore that I can do
