Go my way and Ill be good to you  
Go my way and your dreams will all come true  
In the sunset the wild waves are callin  
My shadow is followin you  
Go my way and Ill take you by the hand  
Believe in me and Ill do the best I can  
I cant be anything but just what I am  
I cant help it if Im in love with you  
Why must I sail my ship alone without a friend  
My thoughts are on you I dare not ask again  
Go my way its the only way to go  
If things arent workin out youll be the first to know  
Come on along and together well go  
Please love me and say that youll be mine  
Why must I sail my ship alone without a friend
