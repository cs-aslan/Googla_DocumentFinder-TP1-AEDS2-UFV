Theres a hole in my bed where I aint seen you for days  
Got a pain in my head cause Im back to my bad old ways  
I cant get out you wont come in  
And you cant see the state Im in  
On top of it all my A strings gone again  
  
Everyday Im awasting away its oh so bad  
My minds gone dead and my eyes are red its oh so sad  
Nobody calls theyve had enough  
Ive got to stop myself drinking this stuff  
On top of it all my A strings gone again  
  
Oh no oh no man overboard you know and Im gonna drown  
Oh no oh no Im wrecking myself and Im running around  
  
Save my soul I said save my soul  
Oh save my soul Im losing my grip  
I think Im gonna slip oh  
  
I gotta do something or I might as well be living in hell  
I gotta find someone who can break me away from this spell  
Its getting to me its bringing me down  
Im cold and Im lonely since you aint around  
And on top of it all my A strings gone again  
  
Oh no oh no man overboard you know and Im gonna drown  
Oh no oh no Im wrecking myself and Im running around  
  
Save my soul save my soul  
Save my soul Im losing my grip  
I think Im gonna slip oh
