Ive seen love go by my door  
Its never been this close before  
Never been so easy or so slow  
Been shooting in the dark too long  
When somethins not right its wrong  
Youre gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
Dragon clouds so high above  
Ive only known careless love  
Its always hit me from below  
This time around its more correct  
Right on target so direct  
Youre gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
Purple clover Queen Annes Lace  
Crimson hair across your face  
You could make me cry if you dont know  
Cant remember what I was thinkin of  
You might be spoilin me too much love  
Youre gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
Flowers on the hillside bloomin crazy  
Crickets talkin back and forth in rhyme  
Blue river runnin slow and lazy  
  
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time  
  
Situations have ended sad  
Relationships have all been bad  
Mineve been like Verlaines and Rimbaud  
But theres no way I can compare  
All those scenes to this affair  
Youre gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
Youre gonna make me wonder what Im doin  
Stayin far behind without you  
Youre gonna make me wonder what Im sayin  
Youre gonna make me give myself a good talkin to  
  
Ill look for you in old Honolulu  
San Francisco Ashtabula  
Yer gonna have to leave me now I know  
But Ill see you in the sky above  
In the tall grass in the ones I love  
Youre gonna make me lonesome when you go  
Ooh youre gonna make me lonesome when you go  
Youre gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
Youre gonna make me lonesome when you go
