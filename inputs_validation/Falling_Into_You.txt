And in your eyes I see ribbons of color  
I see us inside of each other  
I feel my unconscious merge with yours  
And I hear a voice say Whats his is hers  
  
Im falling into you  
This dream could come true  
And it feels so good falling into you  
  
I was afraid to let you in here  
Now I have learned love cant be made in fear  
The walls begin to tumble down  
And I cant even see the ground  
  
Im falling into you  
This dream could come true  
And it feels so good falling into you  
  
Falling like a leaf falling like a star  
Finding a belief falling where you are  
  
Catch me dont let me drop  
Love me dont ever stop  
  
So close your eyes and let me kiss you  
And while you sleep I will miss you  
  
Im falling into you  
This dream could come true  
And it feels so good falling into you  
  
Falling like a leaf falling like a star  
Finding a belief falling where you are  
  
Falling into you  
Falling into you  
Falling into you
