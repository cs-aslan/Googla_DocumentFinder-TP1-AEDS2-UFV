I want to live alone in the desert  
I want to be like Georgia OKeefe  
I want to live on the Upper East Side  
And never go down in the street  
  
Splendid Isolation  
I dont need no one  
Splendid Isolation  
  
Michael Jackson in Disneyland  
Dont have to share it with nobody else  
Lock the gates Goofy take my hand  
And lead me through the World of Self  
  
Splendid Isolation  
I dont need no one  
Splendid Isolation  
  
Dont want to wake up with no one beside me  
Dont want to take up with nobody new  
Dont want nobody coming by without calling first  
Dont want nothing to do with you  
  
Im putting tinfoil up on the windows  
Lying down in the dark to dream  
I dont want to see their faces  
I dont want to hear them scream  
  
Splendid Isolation  
I dont need no one  
Splendid Isolation  
  
Splendid Isolation  
I dont need no one  
Splendid Isolation
