Sweet love standing at my gate  
Oh my sweet love  
It sure would feel good to feel good again  
Oh my sweet love  
  
You say that you need me  
Youll always believe me  
Oh my sweet love  
That our love is forever  
Well always be together  
Oh my sweet love  
  
You say youll always come through  
Theres nothing that you wont do  
Oh my sweet love  
But Ive heard it all before  
I cant beg you anymore  
Oh my sweet love  
  
Chorus  
Youre the woman who knows exactly what shes doing  
Youre the girl who ate the apple off the tree  
When youre good youre just crazy when youre bad youre too much  
  
You say youd never hurt me  
Youll never desert me  
Oh my sweet love  
That your words are always true  
I can depend on you  
Oh my sweet love  
  
When you get in the wind  
And all the storms begin  
Oh my sweet love  
When youre sad and dismantled  
And all your senses rattled  
Oh my sweet love  
  
Chorus  
  
Sweet love standing at my gate  
Oh my sweet love  
It sure would feel good to feel good again  
Oh my sweet love
