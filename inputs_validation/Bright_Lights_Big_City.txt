Bright lights big city  
Gone to my babys head  
Bright lights big city  
Gone to my babys head  
Tried to tell the woman  
But she wont believe a thing I said  
  
Go light pretty baby  
Gonna need my help some day  
Go light pretty baby  
Gonna need my help some day  
Youre gonna wish you listened  
To some of those things I said  
  
Say go ahead pretty baby  
Go on and knock yourself out  
I said go ahead pretty baby  
Go on and knock yourself out  
  
I still love you baby  
But you dont know what its all about  
  
Bright lights big city  
Gone to my babys head  
Bright lights big city  
Gone to my babys head  
  
Tried and tried to tell my woman  
But she doesnt believe a word I said
