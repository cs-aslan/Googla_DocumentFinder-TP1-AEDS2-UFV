Drop the bass  
Drop the bass  
Drop the bass  
Drop the bass  
  
Shipped out on of knees  
Her old man thinks youre a social disease  
Dog pissed on the floor left a stain  
Your old ladys daddy driving you insane  
She stopped taking the pill  
Then left you sued you for a mil  
Youve got your problems boy so damn great  
  
Ha Ha Ha How do they do that  
  
Cant find a good wife cant find a good job  
Cant find the keys to my car  
I lost my dog I lost my brain  
I lost my girl to a big movie star whatever  
  
Now Im standing at the crossroads trying to find my way home  
But the truth is baby Im so  
Lonely lonely lonely lonely  
Sometimes Id just  
  
Chorus  
Like to jump in and get me some funky  
When push comes to shove  
You talk too much and way too rough  
How bout we both shut up and lets make love  
  
Im home hangin the walls are bangin  
Its the neighbors next door  
Theyre talking trashy or doing the nasty  
They keep me up until four  
  
So they keep on going more and more  
I hear and said Lord Im half crazy  
I gotta get me some of that  
In and out and in and outand in and out  
  
Chorus  
  
When the clothes start flying  
Theres no denying  
Gonna get some funky  
Good good funky  
  
Your blood starts pumpin  
Baby start somethin  
Here oh right here right here baby  
Oh give me a little bit of loving  
  
Solo  
  
Its all so simple  
Ill bring the ripple  
When she stayed all night  
  
How bout we drink get drunk  
  
  
Chorus  
  
Alt Chorus  
  
When push comes to shove  
Skip your lip and all the politics  
How bout we both shut up and lets make love  
  
It would sound like this  
Boom boom ha ha boom boom ha ha  
Stop  
Aight
