Watching waiting  
You know it shouldnt take this long  
Leaning forward  
I know I couldnt possibly take much  
Longer  
  
I now the pain moves on  
And I feel the same for the wrong  
  
Angels walking floating on and on  
Breathing eloquent  
I know it couldnt possibly wait much  
Longer  
  
Searching so long I know  
Well find a way  
Reaching all alone I know they couldnt  
Possibly hate much longer
