Only you can touch me with your dark eyes  
With a look that burns like fire through the lonely night  
Sometimes I run but I can never hide  
From the pieces of my heart that fall like rain from the sky  
  
When you hear the thunder  
When you hear the sound of a mountain crashing down  
Its just my heart in pieces  
When I feel the hunger  
When Im reaching out with a hundred thousand hands  
Its my heart in pieces  
  
No one cuts through my soul like you can  
Im naked to the bone beside your empty hand  
I see your face and I remember  
Im a prisoner of your fate Im a loser in the race  
  
When you hear the thunder  
When you hear the sounds of a mountain crashing down  
Its just my heart in pieces  
When I feel the hunger  
When Im reaching out with a hundred thousand hands  
Its my heart in pieces  
  
I walk the fine line between fire and the ice  
The memory lives on  
Theres always something to remind me  
Every teardrop falling  
When your voice keeps calling  
  
When you hear the thunder  
when you hear the sounds of a mountain crashing down  
Its just my heart in pieces  
When I feel the hunger  
When Im reaching out with a hundred thousand hands  
Its my heart in pieces
