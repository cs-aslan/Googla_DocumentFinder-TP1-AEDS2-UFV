Annie says I should do what she tells me  
Annie tells me what to do

Annie moves in mysterious ways  
Annie says that she thinks I might be crazy  
She might be right  
  
Cause Annie says Im just a loony  
Annie says Im a fool  
And I think the same about everyone else  
That Annie just tells me about  
Annie says that  
  
Annie says Im a fool and Im a loony  
I believe it could be true  
Annie says Im stranger than crazy  
I say Annie you could be too  
  
It could happen to a bishop or a priest  
Or any man that you see on the street  
They could be crazy  
Any woman or man you see  
Any child any star you find  
  
Annie says Any chance  
Annie says Any fortune  
The luck of the draw the sling of the dice  
The lowest hand the highest nose  
Dont think twice cause Annie says  
  
Johnny says Annies all right  
Johnny loves her all the time  
Johnny says Annies all right  
Johnny loves her all the time

Annie knows in her heart that Im crazy

Annies wrong Im always right  
Annies right and Im always wrong  
Annies wrong and Im always right
