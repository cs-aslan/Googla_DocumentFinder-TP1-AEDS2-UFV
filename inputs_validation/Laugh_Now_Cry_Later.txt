Ice Cube  
Uhhuh understand this  
I dont give a fuck about what yall talkin about  
I aint tryin to hear none of that shit  
Nigga Ima do what I wanna do  
When I wanna do it how I wanna do it  
And you better hope I dont do it to you  
Now I dont care what momma got to say  
I dont care what grandmomma got to say  
Nigga Im grown  
Let me tell you a lil somethin about me  
  
I was born not to give a fuck wanna drink get your cup  
Turn it up throw it up take the world blow it up  
Somebody slow it up roll it up smoke it up  
My own momma cant keep me from locn up  
One ear out the other one man out to smother  
The neighborhood that left me here without my brother  
Fuck you under covers and you dirty motherfuckers  
In the hood that still fuck without rubbers  
Club hop bar hop car shop nail shop  
To the mall spend it all why the hell not  
What bills what rent dont know whats spent  
Why you care do you work for the government  
  
Chorus  
Fuck it homey Ima laugh now and cry later  
Get your paper we can laugh now and cry later  
All you players you can laugh now and cry later  
Investigators let you laugh now and cry later  
  
Ice Cube  
See Im a product of this urban decay  
A nigga dyin for tomorrow but live for today  
A nigga lie steal and borrow and cheatings OK  
Dont you tell these motherfuckers that my name is OShea  
Cause Ima fuck up my babys credit let him regret it  
7 months old hes already got a jail record  
Im the one to blame put it in my momma name  
Shes a drama queen but I got the bling bling  
I need the watch and the bracelet and the earrings  
I need you all to show up at my hearings  
Tell the judge Im a nice nigga good nigga  
And Ima play the sad face when he look nigga  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x2  
The number you are calling was lost and cannot be called back  
Your last call return service  
  
Ice Cube  
Its fucked up that yall wont accept my calls  
Tell momma at least she can send some drawers  
These walls make yall forget about me  
Im comin home in 2033  
But thats irrelevant did you get the mail I sent  
What I tell a bitch you better stay celibate  
She start lyin to me tell me who she aint fuckin  
Never tell me that my homeboys aint nothin  
Bun in the oven it belong to my cousin  
Got the nerve to tell me that you really love me  
What Ima kill her ass when a nigga make parole  
Hit her with my cane cause a nigga gray and old  
  
Chorus  
  
Ice Cube  
Man it aint right man  
You know yall aint doin me right man  
A nigga tryin to do right man  
You know Im tryin to change my life man you know  
I done found the Lord while Im in here you know  
I Im tryin to do right now I mean  
You know Im sorry for everything  
That I I I mean you know  
Thats fucked up how yall doin me man  
Yall niggas could at least send me somethin  
  
Alright first four guys lets go lock it up
