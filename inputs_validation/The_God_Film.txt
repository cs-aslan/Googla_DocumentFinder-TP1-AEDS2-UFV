Shes like death on two legs  
She is raw pink shame  
Please stop the God film  
Its all wrong  
But Im not to blame  
  
These boys of image  
Carry banners  
Believe in slogans  
Kill policeman  
  
Say its freedom  
Say its goodness  
Say its peaceful  
Im lonely  
Im feeling down everyone I know has been and gone  
  
Its such a sick picture  
She says i cure everyone  
Im alone in a corner  
I wont ever forgive  
I must be broken  
I dont know  
Who on earth can I blame
