I come from just the other side of nowhere  
To this big time lonesome town  
They got a lot of ice and snow here  
Half as cold as all the people Ive found  
Every way I try to go here seems to bring me down  
Ive seen about enough to know where I belong  
Ive got a mind to see the headlights shining  
On that old white line between my heart and home  
Sick of spendin Sundays wishing they were Mondays  
  
Sittin in a park alone  
So give my best to anyone whos left who ever done me  
Any lovin way but wrong  
Tell em that the pride of just the other side o nowheres  
Goin home  
  
Takin nothin back to show there  
For these dues Ive paid  
But the soul I almost sold here  
And the body Ive been givin away  
  
Fadin from the neon nighttime glow here  
Headin for the light of day  
Just the other side of nowhere goin home  
Ive got a mind to see the headlights shinin  
On that old white line between my heart and home  
Sick of spendin Sundays wishin they were Mondays  
Sittin in a park alone  
  
So give my best to anyone whos left who ever done me  
Any lovin way but wrong  
  
Tell them that the pride of just the other side of nowheres  
Goin Home  
Just the other side on nowhere goin home
