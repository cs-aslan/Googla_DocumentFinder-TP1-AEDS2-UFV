If youre wondering why  
All the love that you long for eludes you  
And people are rude and cruel to you  
Ill tell you why  
Ill tell you why  
Ill tell you why  
Ill tell you why  
  
You just havent earned it yet baby  
You just havent earned it son  
You just havent earned it yet baby  
You must suffer and cry for a longer time  
You just havent earned it yet baby  
And Im telling you now  
  
If youre wondering why  
When all I wanted from life was to be famous  
I have tried for so long its all gone wrong  
Ill tell you why  
Ill tell you why  
Ill tell you why  
Ill tell you why  
But you wouldnt believe me  
  
You just havent earned it yet baby  
You just havent earned it son  
You just havent earned it yet baby  
You must suffer and cry for a longer time  
You just havent earned it yet Baby  
And Im telling you now  
Ill tell you why  
Ill tell you why  
  
Today I am remembering the time  
When they pulled me back  
And held me down  
And looked me in the eyes and said  
You just havent earned it yet baby  
You just havent earned it my son  
You just havent earned it yet baby  
You must stay on your own for slightly longer  
You just havent earned it yet baby  
And Im telling you now  
  
You just havent earned it yet baby  
Oh  
You just havent earned it yet baby  
Oh  
Oh
