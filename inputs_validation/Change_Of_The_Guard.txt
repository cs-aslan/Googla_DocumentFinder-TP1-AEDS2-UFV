If you listen you can hear it  
Its the laughter in the street  
Its the motion in the music  
And the fire beneath your feet  
All the signs are right this time  
You dont have to try so very hard  
If you live in this world  
Youre feelin the change of the guard  
  
All the cowboys and your neighbors  
Can you swallow up your pride  
Take your guns off it youre willin  
And you know were on your side  
If you want to get through the years  
Its high time you played your card  
If you live in this world  
Youre feelin the change of the guard
