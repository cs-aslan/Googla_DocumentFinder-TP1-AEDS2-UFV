Each passing night  
I try and close my eyes  
But thoughts of you  
They wake me up  
And tear me inside out  
Each passing night  
I ask myself whos right  
And try to find the reasons why  
It had to end that night  
Didnt we share each others dreams  
We held each other tight  
Ang tears fell fromm my eyes  
As you walked and left me here  
Like the wind you passed me by  
I try but I cant see  
If its something that I said  
Baby please wont you tell me now  
Cause it gets harder each passing night  
I often pray  
That youd come back and stay  
Weve had too much together  
To ever live a part  
Ill wait and see  
Cause I know and I believe  
Someday youll come to realize  
What you and I can be  
Then well share each others dreams  
Well held each other tight  
Kiss the tears that burn my eyes  
Cause you walked and left me here  
Like the wind you passed me by  
I try but I cant see  
If its something that I said  
Baby please wont you tell me now  
Cause it gets harder each passing night  
I never meant to hurt your heart this way  
Sooner or later  
Thered be someone else whod stay  
Didnt we share each others dreams  
share each others dreams  
You tear me inside out  
and tears fell from my eyes  
Someday youd realize  
as you walked and left me here  
Like the wind you passed me by  
I try but I cant see  
Kiss the tears that burn my eyes  
Baby please wont you tell me now  
Cause it gets harder each passing night  
I try but I cant see  
I try but I cant s
