Moving forward using all my breath  
Making love to you was never second best  
I saw the world thrashing all around your face  
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
Youve seen the difference and  
Its getting better all the time  
Theres nothing you and I wont do  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
You should know better  
Dream of better lives the kind which never hate  
You should see why  
Dropped in the state of imaginary grace  
You should know better  
I made a pilgrimage to save this human race  
You should see why  
Never comprehending a race that long gone by  
Ill stop the world  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
Ill stop the world  
Youve seen the difference and its getting better all the time  
Lets stop the world  
Theres nothing you and I wont do  
Lets stop the world  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
The futures open wide  
Lets stop the world  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
Lets stop the world  
Ive seen some changes but its getting better all the time  
Lets stop the world  
Theres nothing you and I wont do  
Lets stop the world  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
The futures open wide  
Hmmm hmmm hmmm  
Hmmm hmmm hmmm hmmm  
Hmmm hmmm hmmm  
Hmmm hmmm hmmm hmmm  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
Lets stop the world  
Youve seen the difference and its getting better all the time  
Lets stop the world  
Theres nothing you and I wont do  
Lets stop the world  
Ill stop the world and melt with you  
Lets stop the world  
Ill stop the world and melt with you
