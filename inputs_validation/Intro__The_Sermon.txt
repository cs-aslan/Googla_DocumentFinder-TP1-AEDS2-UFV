Well  
Are you ready for me  
Before I start I just wanna get a few things off my chest  
Take ya time brother  
You see being in the business that I am in looks like everything I do  
Everywhere I go and everything I see  
Seems to be through some kind of magnifying glassyes Can I talk about it  
Talk ontalk on  
While youre looking I suggest you take a good look  
And I hope you find just what it is youre looking for  
Amen  
  
Just like that song says aint nobodys business what I do  
Now can I move on  
Move on move on move on brother Kelly  
I remember when I was trying to be somebody but I just didnt know nobody  
I didnt know nobody  
But now  
Now  
I said now  
Now  
Can I say it again  
Gon and say it again  
Now every since God has blessed me it seems that things are going a little  
Bit differentyes it is  
  
Folks aint it funny how things can say sometimeswhyeven the Statue of  
Liberty want some bump and grind  
Can I getta witness off up in them jeeps Amen  
I dont see nothing wrong with a little truth  
Nownow wait a minute go that way  
Ya see the good book says that the truth is the lightplease I think its
time  
To turn on your lights and see the truth  
Can Can I talk on  
You dont know where Ive been you dont know where Im going You dont know  
What I do  
  
Can I get a witness  
So before you go trying to pass judgment on me pass judgment on yourself  
Worry bout yourself and what yourself is doing and where yourself is going  
And who yourself has been with  
That way you  
you  
You  
You  
You  You dont have to ever worry about nobody  
But Jesus
