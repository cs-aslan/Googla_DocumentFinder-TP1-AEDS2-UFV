I know my baby told me so  
Yes I know my baby told me so  
She said Im leavin you daddy  
Got such a long way to go  
  
Well I can hear your phone ringin baby all down that line  
Yes I can hear your phone ringin baby all down that line  
And when I hear your phone ringin  
I know youre not far behind  
  
Fanny Mae baby wont you please come home  
Now Im so tired livin all alone
