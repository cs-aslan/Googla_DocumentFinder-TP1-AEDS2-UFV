You walked in the room  
I saw your face and i saw you smile  
A pretty girl like yourself  
Youve got a new approach  
And the time is right  
  
You think youre so fine oh so fine  
And it so excites me  
Come six with my nine  
Youre my perfect partner  
And the times good tonight  
  
Chorus  
Take me Im yours  
Take me Im yours  
Come on now and take me  
Take me amour  
Take me Im yours  
Come on now and take me  
  
Oh dont you be so nice to me  
Oh you cant be serious  
A pretty girl like yourself  
Youll be my perfect partner  
And the times good tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
I love the way you wear your hair  
I saw the way you stopped and stared  
When i looked at you oh no oh no  
Well maybe girls like you arent free  
But baby baby cant you see  
I just want to be with you  
  
You walked through the room  
Continental style and sweet perfume  
A pretty girl like yourself  
Youve got a new approach  
And the times good tonight  
  
Chorus
