On a wedding ring on everything

Cause baby girl listen  
Since you been here with me  
Cant even lie

Providin me with the fire  
When you wet and drippin  
Mommy if you see it different  
Go head and get it  
And I aint sayin if you leave me

Saying no purpose constant chest pain

Lemme talk to you one more time girl  
You always sayin that I dont want you to hurt  
You always complainin  
But I was makin it worse  
Besides all the games that Is kickin at first  
Its time to explain  
My minds been in reverse  
But now I think back  
When nobody cared  
And you was there  
Just to roll by your man  
And came back  
Even know what I did  
I realize and Im aware  
I know what it is  
Put that on everything  
Girl you my everything  
I dont know where Id breathe  
Cause you the air I be  
If lovin is wrong  
Who could be right  
I wouldnt know what to do  
Without you in my life  
Youre more to me than the world I pray  
The more nights for your heart to ache  
Right in the middle of the dawn of day  
I think of all the pain I caused  
And throw it away and say  
I need you in my life  
Can you feel it in your soul
