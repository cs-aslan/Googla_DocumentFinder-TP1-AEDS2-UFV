Im lying beside you just thinking about us  
Too tired to go to sleep and too much in love  
I know Im crazy but I cant close my eyes  
Im scared you wont be there in the morning when I rise  
Will you be there  
Who do you dream about are you alone in your sleep  
To who will you reach out  
Oh let it be me  
Oh baby youre my obsession my addiction my drug  
Dont want to be without you when I wake up  
Will you be there in the morning will you be there when I want you  
Will you be there when I wake up oh I need you to be there in the morning  
Will you be there  
  
Well youre so close to me but I feel so alone  
The more I touch you the more I want  
Dont know what to do about me loving you but I pray to god that you feel it
too  
Youre my obsession my addiction my drug so let the candle grow into a
great fire of love  
Will you be there in the morning will you be there when I want you  
Will you be there when I wake up  
I need you to be there in the morning  
I wanna love you forever  
Dont want a love thats now or never  
Cant you see you got me down on the floor  
I want more more  
  
Will you be there in the morning will you be there when I want you  
Will you be there when I wake up  
Will you be there in the morning  
Will you be there
