I was standin at 715  
Waitin for my babys car  
Just when out stepped the driver of a limousine  
And asked if I was going far  
  
I said Ive got my mind made up  
I dont want to leave here baby cause its clear to me  
That its just too tough to find another lover like mine  
  
With I mean the right stuff  
I got to have the right stuff baby  
I dont want to miss out on the right stuff  
Ooh no with mister right stuff  
  
I just found him a week ago  
Hes gonna call me on the phone and say  
I live in Paris dont you want to go  
I know you must be alone  
  
Well its take more than a fancy trick  
Or chauffeured limousine for I have never seen  
No one who can give me lovin like this  
The other fellas dont compare  
  
With I mean the right stuff  
I got to have the right stuff baby  
I dont want to miss out on the right stuff  
Ooh no with mister right stuff  
  
Hes the only one to give me that lovin  
Cause next to him there is no other one  
He very sexy oh so sweet  
Knocks me off my feet sing  
Ooh yeah let me sing it again  
  
With I mean the right stuff  
I got to have the right stuff baby  
I dont want to miss out on the right stuff  
Ooh no with mister right stuff
