Aint no use to sit and wonder why babe  
It dont matter anyhow  
Aint no use to sit and wonder why babe  
If you dont know by now  
  
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn  
Youll look out your window and Ill be gone  
You are the reason Im traveling on  
But dont think twice its all right  
  
Aint no use in turning on your light babe  
The light I never knowed  
Aint no use in turning on your light babe  
Im on the dark side of the road  
  
Still I wish there was something you could do or say  
To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talking anyway  
Dont think twice its all right  
  
Walking down that long lonesome road babe  
Where Im bound I can tell  
But goodbye is too good a word babe  
So Ill just say Fairthee well  
  
I aint sayin you treated me unkind  
You could have done better I dont mind  
You just sort of wasted my precious time  
Dont think twice its all right  
  
Dont think twice its all right  
Dont think twice its all right  
Dont you think twice babe its all right  
Dont think twice baby its all right  
Dont you think twice its all right  
Baby its all right its all right  
Well its all right don think twice
