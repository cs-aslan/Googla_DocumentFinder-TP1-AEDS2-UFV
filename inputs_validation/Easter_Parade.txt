Never saw you look quite so pretty before  
Never saw you dress quite so handsome  whats more  
  
I could hardly wait to keep our date  
This lovely Easter morning  
And my heart beat fast as I came through the door  
For  
  
In your Easter bonnet with all the frills upon it  
Youll be the grandest fella in the Easter parade  
Ill be all in clover and when they look us over  
Well be the proudest couple in the Easter parade  
  
On the avenue Fifth Avenue  
The photographers will snap us  
And youll find that youre in the rotogravure  
Oh I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet  
And of the guy Im taking to the Easter Parade  
  
On the avenue Fifth Avenue  
The photographers will snap us  
And youll find that youre in the rotogravure  
  
Oh I could write a sonnet  
About your Easter bonnet  
And of the girl Im taking to the Easter Parade
