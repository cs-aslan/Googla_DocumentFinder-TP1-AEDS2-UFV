Sunday morning  
Im still hiding in bed  
Listening to the rhythm of the rain above my head  
And all that I have said  
I sure saved a lot for you  
But what could I do  
If Id been talking to the wall  
It wouldnt make any difference to you  
Thats the art of being you  
  
I think I carry the weight of the world  
Sometimes you lose  
The weight of the world  
Sometimes you cry  
  
I kiss your smile  
I wish youd stay the night  
I put my arms around your golden head and turn out the light  
Oh I love to watch your eyes  
When I make love to you  
Wait little world  
Sometimes you lose  
  
The weight of the world  
Sometimes you cry  
Sometimes you cry  
  
The weight of the world  
Sometimes you lose  
The weight of the world  
Sometimes you cry  
Sometimes you cry
