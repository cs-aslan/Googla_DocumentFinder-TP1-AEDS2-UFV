Lives opened and trashedLook ma watch me crash  
No time to questionwhyd nothing last  
Grasp and hold onhold tight and fast  
Soon be overand I will relent  
Let the ocean swell dissolve way my past  
Three days and maybe longer wont even know Ive left  
Under your tongueIm like a tab  
I will give you whatyoure not supposed to have  
Under my breathI swear by sin  
For better or for worsea best we began  
Let the sun climb oh burn away my mask  
Three days and maybe longer shed my skin at lastshedshed  
Let the sun shine burn away my mask  
Three days and maybe longer wont ever find me here  
Let the ocean dissolve away my past  
Four days and not much longer  
Let my spirit pass  
Ooh  
This is this is3x  
Mylast exit
