This next song were going to dedicate to a great American  
Organization Tonight Id like to dedicate this to our boys  
In the FBI  
  
Well wait a minute Its hard to be an FBI man I mean first  
Of all being an FBI man you have to be over 40 years old  
And the reason is that it takes at least 25 years with the  
Organization to be that much of a bastard Its true You just  
Cant join you know It needs an atmosphere where your  
Natural bastardness can grow and develop and take a  
Meaningful shape in todays complex society  
  
But thats not why I want to dedicate the song to the FBI I  
Mean the job that they have to do is a drag I mean they have  
To follow people around you know Thats part of their job  
Follow me around  
  
Im out on the highway and Im drivin down the road and I  
Run out of gasoline I pull over to the side of the road They  
Gotta pull over too  make believe that they ran out you  
Know  
  
I go to get some gasoline They have to figure out whether  
They should stick with the car or follow me Suppose I dont  
Come back and theyre stayin with the car  
  
Or if I fly on the airplanes I could fly half fare because Im 12  
To 22 And they gotta pay the full fare But the thing is that  
When you pay the full fare you have to get on the airplane  
First so that they know how many seats are left over for the  
Half fare kids Right And sometimes there arent any seats  
Left over and sometimes there are but that doesnt mean that  
You have to go  
  
Suppose that he gets on and fills up the last seat so you cant  
Get on Then he gets off then you can get on Whats he gonna  
Do  
  
Well its a drag for him But that
