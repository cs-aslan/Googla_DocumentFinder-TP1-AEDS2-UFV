Hopelessly a man starts to feed your day  
Once he was there you never looked back  
How did you think that his words might just fade away  
He seemed harmless enough so you let him in and now youll pay  
I cant see him but hes stalking my thoughts  
How does it feel when you cant concentrate  
I just stare  
All of your daydreams are a seesaw for him to play on  
How does it feel when he calls your name  
You can plug your ears but its not the same  
How does it feel when he pulls you back  
Nobodys wrong nobodys right the birdman wouldnt lie  
Nobodys wrong nobodys right but I just cant trust him tonight  
How do you forget a stranger that plagues your days  
We arm ourselves when theres nothing to fear right  
Wrong  
How does it feel when it comes to pass theres something there  
But its not quite right  
How does it feel does it make you mad
