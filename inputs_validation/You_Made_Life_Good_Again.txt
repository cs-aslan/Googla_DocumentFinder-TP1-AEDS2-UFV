Im always looking for a minute that we can steal  
Cause I need more of how you make me feel  
I used to be the king of wasted time  
Cause it made no difference till I made you mine  
  
Now I wake up in the morning with a smile on my face  
Cant get enough of the human race  
Aint loved like this since I cant remember when  
Baby you made life good again oh yeah darlin you made life good again  
  
I like the way you talk and the way you look when it comes to loving you wrote
the book  
Cause when you kiss me    tell me what part of heaven did you come from  
  
Now I wake up in the morning with a smile on my face  
Aint loved like this since I cant remember when  
Baby you made life good again oh yeah darlin you made life good again I was
lonely oh so lonely wont Be lonely again I wake up in the morning with a
smile on my face cant get enough of the human race Aint loved like this
since I cant remember when baby oh yeah darlin you made life good again you
ade life good again
