Welcome my son to your very first day  
So proud to be the one  
Who brought you this way  
I love you with all my heart  
And my love is here to stay  
But I cant help worrying  
Will you eventually smoke weed  
  
Soon enough youll be walking  
You and me hand in hand  
The silly words youll be talkin  
Only daddy can understand  
Well go out making snowmen  
Building castles in the sand  
And all the time Im thinking  
Will this kid end up smokin weed  
  
But time keeps on going  
And you keep on growin  
Youre now six years old  
Youre getting so good at your spellin  
But my mind is always dwellin  
On the fact that you  
Could be the kind of guy  
Who grows up and needs  
To smoke weed on the couch  
All the time  
All the time  
  
So answer me this while  
Youre lying in your little bed  
Why must you insist on bein  
Such a fuckin pothead  
Theres other things in life  
That can make you feel good  
But you just keep on smokin your herb  
You cant get enough of  
Your precious precious reefer  
Where you getting all this money  
To buy so much Hawaiian dope
