I know youre in the sun  
I know youre close to everyone  
At times its like you dont have a hold on me  
  
I see you in the love  
I see you in the moon above  
But I want to know that youre not lost inside of me  
  
You know I need you  
You know I love you  
If Im not with you  
Im not so much of a man  
Im like a fish on the sand  
  
You call me in the night You call me in the night  
And hide behind the daylight  
Youre blowing like a wind you dont let me see  
  
You know I feel a pain You know I feel a pain  
Im tired of playing games with you  
Though theres nothing else I want that would set me free  
  
You know I love you  
You know I need you  
If I cant be with you  
Im not so much of a man  
Im a fish on the sand  
  
No use to no one else theyve all dried up  
Watching all our lives go by  
I cant believe youd want to see me crying  
  
I hold you in my heart Hold you in my heart  
I know that youre a part of me  
But its a must to know that you love me too  
  
I look you in the eye Look you in the eye  
Youre swimming by my teardrops  
But I want to know for sure that youll let me see  
  
You know I want you  
You know I need you  
If Im not with you  
Im not so much of a man  
Im like a fish on the sand  
  
You know I need you  
You know I love you  
If Im not with you  
Im not so much of a man  
Im a fish on the sand  
  
Not so much of a man  
More a fish on the sand
