Ohhh people why dont you come in here and let me talk to you a while  
Thats right step right up and listen to a concerned citizen speak his piece  
  
Ill tell you a little something that my daddy told to me  
My basic fundamentals if you want to be free  
cause son theres somthing wrong internally  
So if you want your freedom son  
Dont want your country to be overrun  
You got to keep america number one  
  
chorus  
My daddy told me son dont let em take your gun  
Thats what they tryin to do  
Son dont let em take your gun  
Theyre takin your bill of rights away from you  
My daddy said son dont let em take your gun  
Thats what they tryin to do  
Son dont let em take your gun  
Dont let em take your gun away from you  
  
Ohhh this year is our anniversary  
Two hundred years people weve been free  
Wont be nobody takin over our land  
If everybodys brothers got a gun in his hand  
Im tellin you we learned to fight for justice  
Were willing to die for freedom  
Hand in hand  
You got to understand  
We are american men  
  
Said they want your gun  
Said they want your gun  
Send em on the run  
Send em on the run  
Hiphurray for fun  
Hiphurray for fun  
If they do were done  
If they do were done  
  
chorus
