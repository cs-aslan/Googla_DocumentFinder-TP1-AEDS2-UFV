That slow burn wait while it gets dark  
Bruising the sun I feel grown up with you in your car  
I know its dumb  
  
Weve both got a million bad habits to kick  
Not sleeping is one  
Were biting our nails youre biting my lip  
Im biting my tongue  
  
When people are talking people are talking  
When People are talking people are talking  
  
Raise a glass cause Im not done saying it  
They all wanna get rough get away with it  
Let em talk cause were dancing in this world alone  
Were all alone  
Were alone  
  
All my fake friends and all of their noise  
Complain about work  
Theyre studying business I study the floor  
And you havent stopped smoking all night  
Maybe the Internet raised us  
Or maybe people are jerks  
  
When people are talking people are talking But not you  
When people are talking people are talking  
  
Raise a glass cause Im not done saying it  
They all wanna get rough get away with it  
Let em talk cause were dancing in this world alone  
Were all alone  
Were alone  
  
All the doubleedged people and schemes  
They make a mess then go home and get clean  
Youre my best friend and were dancing in a world alone  
Were all alone  
Were all alone  
  
I know were not everlasting  
Were a train wreck waiting to happen  
One day the blood wont flow so gladly  
One day were all get still  
When people are talking people are talking  
Get still  
  
When people are talking people are talking  
When people are talking people are talking  
  
Raise a glass cause Im not done saying it  
They all wanna get rough get away with it  
Let em talk cause were dancing in this world alone  
Were all alone  
Were alone  
  
All the doubleedged people and schemes  
They make a mess then go home and get clean  
Youre my best friend so were dancing in a world alone  
Were all alone  
Were all alone  
  
When people are talking people are talking  
When people are talking people are talking  
When people are talking people are talking  
When people are talking people are talking  
  
Let em talk
