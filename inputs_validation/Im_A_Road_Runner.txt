Money who needs it  
Let me live a life free and easy  
Put a toothbrush in my hand  
Let me be a traveling man  
Im a roadrunner baby  
  
Im a road runner baby  
Any place is my home  
Im a road runner baby  
You look for me and Ill be gone  
  
Well you can love me if you want  
But I do declare  
When I get restless  
Ive got to move somewhere  
  
Im a road runner baby  
Just got to keep on keeping on  
And I love the life I live  
And Im gonna live the life I love  
  
Dont want no woman  
To tie me down  
Gotta be free baby  
To roam around  
  
All my life its been like this  
If you love me its your own risk  
When the dust hits my shoes  
I got the urge to move  
  
Im a road runner baby  
Anyplace is my home  
And I love the life I live  
And Im gonna live the life I love  
Roadrunner baby
