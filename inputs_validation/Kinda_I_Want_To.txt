I cant shake this feeling from my head  
Theres a devil sleeping in my bed  
Watching you from across the way  
I cannot make this feeling go away  
  
Chorus  
I know its not the right thing  
And I know its not the good think  
But kinda I want to  
  
Im not sure of what I should do  
When every thought Im thinking of is you  
All of my excuses turn to lies  
Maybe God will cover up his eyes  
  
Chorus  
  
Why does it have to be this way  
Why does it have to be  
Why does have to be this way  
Kinda I want to  
Maybe just for tonight  
We can pretend its alright  
Whats the price I pay  
I dont care what they say  
I want to  
I want to Ill take my chance tonight
