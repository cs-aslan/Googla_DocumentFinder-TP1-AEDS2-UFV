Ive been running low on inspiration  
Tired of that physical intrigue  
Theres nothing left to imagination  
Living in a world that treats love so carelessly  
  
Dont want no smooth talkin lover  
I cant play the role  
It just leaves me cold  
  
I need a high powered love  
I wanna feel that lightning streak  
High powered love  
Got to be down in the heart with me  
  
Sometimes its hard to keep believing  
Too many pretty faces all skin deep  
Is there anyone left with teeth just a little uneven  
And wont spend more time with a mirror than me  
  
If youre just looking for a good time  
A notch on your gun  
I aint the one  
  
I want a high powered love  
Got to have intensity  
High powered love  
Dont start the fire if you cant take the heat  
  
I cant turn back Im on a mission  
I know theres someone out there for me  
  
I need a high powered love  
One thatll defy gravity  
High powered love  
Got to be strong and keep on lifting me  
  
Higher higher higher  
Higher higher higher  
High powered love  
High powered love  
  
Higher higher higher
