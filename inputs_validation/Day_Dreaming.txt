Day dreamin and Im thinkin of you  
Day dreamin and Im thinkin of you  
Day dreamin and Im thinkin of you  
Day dreamin and Im thinkin of you  
Look at my heart floating away  
  
Hes the kind of guy that would say  
Hey baby lets get away lets go some place huh  
Well I dont care  
Hes the kind of guy that you give your everything  
And trust your heart share all of your love till death do you part  
  
I want to be what he wants when he wants it and whenever he needs it  
And when hes lonesome and feelin love starved  
Ill be there to feed it  
Im givin him a little bit for each day  
He turns me right on when I hear him say  
  
Hey baby lets get away lets go somewhere far  
Baby can we  
Well I dont care  
Hey baby lets get away lets go somewhere far  
Baby can we  
Well I dont care  
  
I wanna be what he wants when he wants it  
And whenever he needs it  
When it comes to bein feelin loved starved Ill be there to feed it  
Lovin him a little bit more each day  
It turns me right on when I hear him say  
  
Hey baby lets get away lets go somewhere far  
Baby can we Well I dont care  
Hey baby lets get away lets go somewhere far  
Baby can we Well I dont care
