I wish youd look whos crawling back to you I never thought Id live to see
today  
I swore to you the day I left this time Id go for good  
And I was even proud enough to tell myself I could  
But it took a lot of lonely nights to ever change my mind  
  
It took a lot of missing youth and things that Id left behind  
Intending to keep going but the going it got too rough  
And prides not hard to swallow once you chewed it long enough  
  
I know we wont always see eye to eye  
But if youll take me back this time Ill really try  
So many things I could have done so much I failed to do  
Ive never needed anyone as much as I need you  
And it took a lot of lonely nights
