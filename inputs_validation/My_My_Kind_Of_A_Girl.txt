When I saw you on Eighth Street  
You could make my life complete baby  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Youre mymy kind of a girl  
  
And when I saw you by  
The jukebox owow  
You put a quarter in and played  
My favorite song too baby  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Youre mymy kind of a girl  
  
I think wed look pretty good together  
Walking through a winter wonderland  
And this time I think its forever  
I hope your parents understand  
  
When I saw you by the Peppermint Lounge  
You were lost but youve been found baby  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Youre mymy kind of a girl
