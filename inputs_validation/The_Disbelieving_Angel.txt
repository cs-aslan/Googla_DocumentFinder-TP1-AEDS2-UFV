So much for all the prayers youve learned  
They are no help to basic needs  
And all the worlds theyve shown you  
Just make you even greedier  
So what about divinity  
Im further away than before  
Youre like two stars colliding  
And youre never going to hit the floor  
Why should I whisper in the church  
Because they say its sacred ground  
Oh my sacrilege would do you good  
You see theres nothing here Ive found  
I feel so sorry for you  
Believing because they control  
And of all the guardian angels  
They chose me to save your soul  
Oh Im just trying to explain  
Im a disbelieving angel
