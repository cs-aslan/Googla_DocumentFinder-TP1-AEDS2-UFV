If I could find a way  
To soothe your troubled mind  
Then I would erase your fears  
And help you to unwind  
I would ease the burden  
That you carry everyday  
Oh dont you know Id find a cure  
And take your pain away  
  
Take your pain away  
Take your pain away  
  
And even though youre far from here  
Dont forget Im always near  
Find comfort in these words I send  
In this cold world  
  
Take your pain away  
Take your pain away  
  
For every aching heart  
For every broken soul  
  
So give up your worries  
Theyll only do you harm  
There is no need to be concerned  
Its just a false alarm
