Do nothing til you hear from me  
Leave a number where youre gonna be  
These times are dangerous for you and me  
But Ill get a message through  
  
Hell be watching every move you make  
Hell be waiting for that one mistake  
Somebodys heart is gonna have to break  
Before were through  
  
Chorus  
Cause we cant live from kiss to kiss  
Making up for all we miss  
Hiding in the daylight shadows  
Until its time to say goodbye  
Wishing it could be alright  
Living with the loneliness  
From kiss to kiss  
  
Dont ask me now whats right or wrong  
Ive been wondering since you came along  
We were weak and love was strong  
Now theres nothing we can do  
  
So Ill meet you at the same old place  
I know its worth it when I see you face  
Someday well disappear without a trace  
Baby thats the truth  
  
Chorus  
  
I keep hoping well find a way  
I keep wondering whos gonna pay  
I keep waiting for judgment day  
Some peoples lives just get in the way  
Thats the truth  
  
Chorus
