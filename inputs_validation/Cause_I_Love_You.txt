My fingers walk all over you  
I wont stop before you scream  
Cause I love you  
Cause I love you  
I feel your body on my skin  
Youre the goddess of my dreams  
Cause I love you  
Cause I love you  
  
Youre the sting thats in my flesh  
When I am feelin down and low  
Thats why I love you  
Thats why I love you  
I make you scream I make you cry  
With all my heart and soul  
Thats why I love you  
Thats why I love you  
  
Shes the one who is crying were flying  
She cries bitter tears when Im blue  
Shes the one who is screaming Im dreaming  
Tonight I will reach  
Out for you out for you  
Totally electric fire  
When I hold you in my arms  
Cause I love you  
  
Cause I love you  
The only true love of my life  
Youre the owner of my heart  
Cause I love you  
Yes I love you  
Shes the one who is crying were flying  
We fly on the way to the stars  
Shes the one who is screaming Im dreaming  
When I reach you with my guitar  
My guitar my guitar
