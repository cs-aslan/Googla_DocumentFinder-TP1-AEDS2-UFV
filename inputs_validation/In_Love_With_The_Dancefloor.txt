Boy there is something way in all my mind  
I cant come in here with you tonight  
Theres been another man in my life for some time  
And he truly loosely he knows how to make me feel like a lady  
Im sneaking out the night cause he drives me crazy  
He knows how to make me sweat  
Hes the best  
  
Chorus  
Im in love with the dance floor  
Cause it knows my favorite song  
In love with the dance floor  
Cause he really touch me on  
Its the only place I dont feel alone  
Its the only place Im at home  
Im in love with the dance floor  
  
Boy I hope you dont hold against me  
  
Cause my heart belongs to the music  
And theres nothing you can do to fix this  
Cause it truly loosely he knows how to make me feel like a lady  
Im sneaking out the night cause he drives me crazy  
He knows how to make me sweat  
Hes the best  
  
Chorus  
Im in love with the dance floor  
Cause it knows my favorite song  
In love with the dance floor  
Cause he really touch me on  
Its the only place I dont feel alone  
Its the only place Im at home  
Im in love with the dance floor
