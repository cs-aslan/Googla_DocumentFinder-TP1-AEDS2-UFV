If youve got trouble  
Then youve got less trouble than me  
You say youre worried  
You cant be as worried as meohh  
  
Youre quite content to be bad  
With all the advantage you had over me  
Just cause youre troubled  
Then dont bring your troubles to me  
  
And dont think its funny  
When you ask for money for things  
Especially when youre standing there  
Wearing diamonds and ringsohh  
  
You think Im softning her head  
Well try someone softer instead anything  
Its not so funny  
When you know what money can bring  
Youd better leave me alone  
  
I dont need a thing from you  
Youd better take yourself home  
Go and count a ring or two  
If youve got trouble  
Then youve got less trouble than me  
  
You say youre worried  
You cant be as worried as me  
Youre quite contempt to be bad  
With all the advantage you had over me  
Just cause youre troubled  
Then dont bring your troubles to me  
  
Youd better leave me alone  
I dont need a thing from you  
Youd better take yourself home  
Go and count a ring or two  
If youve got trouble  
Then youve got less trouble than me  
  
You say youre worried  
You cant be as worried as me  
Youre quite contempt to be bad  
With all the advantage you had over me  
  
Just cause youre troubled  
Then dont bring your troubles to me  
Just cause your troubled  
Then dont bring your troubles to me
