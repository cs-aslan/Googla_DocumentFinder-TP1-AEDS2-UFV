Excuse me please your majesty  
I chance this moment nervously  
To share with you a fantasy  
That I have lived inside of me  
  
And it is so pretty  
And it is so fine  
Its the kind youd love to last you  
Until the end of time  
  
Weve talked of love weve talked of life  
And what would make the world so nice  
Weve walked the sand by lovers sea  
Ive held your body close to me  
  
And it is so pretty  
How Id love to know  
For if I had a chance to hold you  
Id never let you go  
  
Youre my queen in the black  
With your timestopping body  
Queen in the black  
With your eyes that hypnotize girl  
Queen in the black  
With your voice thats sweet as candy  
Queen in the black  
Miss Ebony you really turn me on  
  
Theres not a day that passes by  
That I dont have you on my mind  
If this aint love I have inside  
Then my hearts telling me a lie  
Cause it feels so special  
And it feels so right  
And if I could I know Id love you  
For the rest of my life  
  
Youre my queen in the black  
With your timestopping body  
Queen in the black  
With your eyes that hypnotize girl
