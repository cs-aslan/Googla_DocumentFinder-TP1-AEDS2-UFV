Walking along the sky  
Chasing a glimpse of you  
Painting a world with stars I found inside your eyes  
Up here above the haze  
Everything looks so clear  
Wondering what it would be like if you were here  
  
And time takes time Howie takes time  
But I cant wait  
To tell you how I feel  
  
Chorus  
Oh youre the calm when my world is crashing  
My heart my blood my passion  
Why tell me why  
Youre everything but mine  
  
I hold you close when it all goes crazy  
And through it all youll be my lady  
Why tell me why  
Youre everything  
Everything but mine  
  
You dont have to be afraid  
Of somebody elses touch  
Just gimme a chance to prove  
Just how you should be loved  
  
And time it takes time Howie takes time  
Its not too late  
To tell you how I feel  
  
Chorus  
  
Everything but mine  
Mine I know oh baby  
Someday youll come around  
Im gonna leave the light on  
And I wont let you down  
No I wont let you down  
  
I wont let you down  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre everything but mine  
Youre everything but mine  
Youre the sun youre the star  
Youre the moon youre the rain  
Love your lips love your eyes  
Drivin me insane oh baby baby  
Everything but mine  
Youre everything but mine
