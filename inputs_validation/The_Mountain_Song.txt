This mountain we must climb over  
This mountain we must climb  
I will follow you over  
We will survive  
  
Its time now  
We must be moving onward  
Its time for us to fly  
Take care and look over your shoulder  
Im there all the time  
  
If youre lost and you need someone to count on  
Oh youve got to look to me  
Because its times like these when a good friend is a saviour  
Oh you come running on back to me  
  
Its time now  
We must be moving onward  
Its time for us to fly  
Take care and look over your shoulder  
Im there all the time  
  
And someday when youre feeling awkward  
And someday when youre down  
Come to me I will give you anything  
Ill turn your frown around  
  
What youve done for me is more than I could hope for  
Oh you are my friend  
And Ill be there for you through happiness and sad times  
Oh our love will pull us through  
  
This mountain we must climb over  
This mountain we must climb  
I will follow you over  
We will survive
