It goes a one two three  
  
With the hunger of a lion the strength of a sun  
I dont need to sweat it when the competition come  
Original style like an eight of eight drum  
So I dont run the track no I make the track run  
My momma taught me words my daddy built rockets  
I hold em both together now tell me what I got  
Its a pretty small weapon I can shoot it I can drop it  
But learn to respect it cause you clearly cant stop it  
  
Like that  
  
It aint over cause the sharks on the left side the snakes on the right  
And anything you do they wanna get a little bite  
It really doesnt matter if youre wrong or if youre right  
Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights  
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose  
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes  
But steady little soldier I aint standing next to you  
I can lay it on the ground before youre even in my view  
Like that  
  
Give me the strength of the rising sun  
Give me the truth of the words unsung  
And when the last bells ring the poor men sing  
Bring me to kingdom come  
  
This is something for your people on the block to  
Blackout and rock to give you what you need  
Like Papa who shot ya  
Seperate the weak from the obsolete  
Youre meek I creep hard on impostors  
And switch styles on the dime quickwitted yall  
Quit tripping I dont have time for your crying  
I grind tough sucka make your mind up  
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the lineup  
Bang bang little monkey man playing  
With the big guns only get you slain  
I aint playing Im just saying  
You aint got a sliver of a chance  
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents  
So shake shake down money heres the break down  
You can play the bank Ima play the bank take down  
And no mistakes now Im coming to get you  
Im just a Banksy youre a Brainwash get the picture  
Its like that  
  
We swim against the rising waves  
That crash against the shore  
The body bends until it breaks  
The early morning sings no more  
  
So rest your head  
Its time to sleep  
And dream of whats in store  
The body bends until it breaks  
And sings again no more  
Cause time has torn the flesh away  
The early morning sings no more
