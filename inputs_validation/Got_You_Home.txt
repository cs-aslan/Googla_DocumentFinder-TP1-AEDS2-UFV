Chorus  
I want you to believe in us  
Trust in your heart  Im very real  
I want you to believe in me  
In time youll know youre all  
I need  
  
I see that youre hurting  
And dont believe my words are true  
But well Im truly certain  
With all my heart  
Ill never hurt you  
  
Take time to realize  
The whos the whats the wheres and whys  
Dont have to compromise  
The love we feel we cant deny  
Yes  
It took me by surprise  
No it didnt take me long  
Cant be long  
Feeling strong  
I want you for the long haul  
  
Chorus  
  
I see that youre open  
And that you wanna feel much more  
Well Im truly certain  
That my love will open the door  
To feelings to love  
And happiness  
To a life filled with wonder  
Never second guess  
That I want you and I love you  
Never wanted more  
You the one that I need  
And the one that I adore  
  
Chorus
