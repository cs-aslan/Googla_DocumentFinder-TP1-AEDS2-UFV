Mama was a rock and roll singer yeah  
Papa used to write all her songs  
Well you could hear their music playing  
On the jukebox all day long  
  
Whoa They was bringing down together yes they is  
In a 2Part harmony  
Till one day one day my daddy sang alone  
He sang his song just for me  
Good God  
  
You think youre just a fox  
And thats all that you got to be  
Oh well you might be a fox  
But lady that aint enough for me  
Youre jacking everybody in town  
But you aint jacking me around  
  
Chorus  
Foxy lady shining on  
I hope you miss me when Im gone  
Coz foxy lady gone is where Im gonna be  
  
Youre super fine  
And you blow peoples mind I know  
But will you pardon me please  
If I dont stick around for your show  
You got everybody chasing your tail  
They even let you put them in jail  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh damn you girl  
You went and messed up  
The world we had  
And what Im trying to say  
In my own sweet way if I may  
You got everybody singing your tune  
But youre flying on a friendly balloon  
  
Chorus
