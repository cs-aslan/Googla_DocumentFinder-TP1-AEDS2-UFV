Through time and love  
This is what youve been waiting for  
Come on now

Ooh I think its got a hold on me its got me

Ooh just the man to set me free

Spring affair spring affair spring affair  
And Im hung on you oh yeah  
Spring affair spring affair spring affair  
And weve got something new  
  
Ooh youre the sunshine in my life  
Ooh how you come on shining bright you got me  
  
Ooh the feelings getting really strong  
Ooh gives me strength to carry on  
You got me you got all of me
