Come home to your place  
Ive got a little while  
Till Ive gotta leave  
You know theres been times  
Where I couldnt lie to your face  
But right now Im looking at you  
Through the window of your soul  
I know those little dark holes are beautiful  
But I I hear the words I should be saying  
I just wish that you could know  
I just think that you should know  
  
That your star is so bright  
I can see your core  
And you light up my life  
So I can see more  
I dont care if youre lost  
Or youre scared  
Or you never ever  
Never ever wanna be friends  
  
Theres a small step outside your place  
Ive got a little wine  
So I can taste all the bittersweet times  
That I have felt again  
But its not too late to repair myself  
From the damage done  
Since Ive been gone  
And I know  
I see the snow  
It starts to fall down  
I just think that I should go  
  
Cause your star is so bright  
I can see your core  
And you light up my life  
So I can see more  
I dont care if youre lost  
Or youre scared  
Or you never ever  
Never ever wanna be friends  
  
Please please belong here  
Please please belong here  
Please please belong here  
Belong here  
You love me you love me  
  
Cause your star is so bright  
I can see your core  
And you light up my life  
So I can see more  
I dont care if I get lost  
And Ill see you again x2
