Wide awake in the middle of the night  
I wonder how shes feelin  
Is it just a trick of the light  
Or is her ceiling peeling  
  
Shes sitting up in bed shakin her head  
At a copy of true confessions  
Ooh it must seem like a fairy tale  
To a woman of her profession  
  
Chorus  
But was I all right was I all right  
Did I take you to the height of ecstasy  
Was I all right was I all right  
Did a shadow of emotion cross your face  
Or was it just another trick of the light  
Repeat  
  
Come on tell me  
Whats a nice girl like you doin in a place like this  
They dont make girls like you no more  
And Id like to get to know you  
On closer terms than this  
But I guess youve heard it all before  
  
Lady of the night  
Wont you steal away with me  
Lady of the night  
Wont you steal away with me  
  
The moneys lyin on the floor she looks at me  
Shakes her head and sighs  
Out of time out the door  
Red light shinin in my eyes  
  
Chorus  
  
All right  
But was I all right  
All right
