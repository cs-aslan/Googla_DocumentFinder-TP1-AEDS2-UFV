Youve got my love to keep you warm  
Give you shelter from the storm  
Any time you need  
Through the long and lonely night  
You got me to hold you tight  
My love is guaranteed  
Youre everything Im waiting for  
Now I dont have to look no more  
  
Take me as I am  
Ill do the best I can for your love  
Its easier said than done  
Take me by the hand  
Try to understand when I say  
Its easier said than done  
Sometimes I swim against the tide  
When I know youre by my side  
There aint nothing I cant do  
Baby my hearts an open book  
Anytime you wanna look  
Cause its written just for youoh whoa  
Youre everything Im waiting for  
Now I dont have to look no more  
  
Take me as I am  
Ill do the best I can for your love  
Its easier said than done  
Take me by the hand  
Try to understand when I say  
Its easier said than done  
  
Youre everything Ive waited for  
Now I dont have to look no more  
Youre everything I want you to be  
Baby baby wont you stay with me  
  
Take me as Im  
Ill do the best I can for your love  
Its easier said than done  
Take me by the hand  
Try to understand when I say  
Its easier said than done  
Its easier said than done  
Its easier said than done  
Its easier said than done  
Its easier said than done  
Its easier said than done
