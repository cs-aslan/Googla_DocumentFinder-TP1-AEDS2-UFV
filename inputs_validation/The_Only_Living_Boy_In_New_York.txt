Tom get your plane right on time  
I know your partll go fine  
Fly down to Mexico  
Dandadandandada and here I am  
The only living boy in New York  
I get the news I need on the weather report  
I can gather all the news I need on the weather report  
Hey Ive got nothing to do today but smile  
Dandadandadandada here I am  
The only living boy in New York  
  
Half of the time were gone but we dont know where  
And we dont know here  
  
Tom get your plane right on time  
I know youve been eager to fly now  
Hey let your honesty shine shine shine  
Dandadandadandada  
Like it shines on me  
The only living boy in New York  
The only living boy in New York
