Southbound again I dont know if Im going or leaving home  
Boy got to be moving  
Seems like the boy is bound to roam  
Southbound again got no money Ive got no place to go  
That womans with her lover boy  
Never want to see her face no more  
Every single time I roll across the rolling River Tyne  
I get the same old feeling  
Every time Im moving down the line  
Southbound again last night I felt like crying  
Right now Im sick of living  
But Im going to keep on trying
