Chorus  
Hey you hurry come up  
See how fast you come down  
You run up your mouth  
You run out of luck  
Youre running out of town  
  
Hurry come up now youre all alone  
You had to kick dirt on your stepping stone  
You lost your way across the land  
Foundations crumble built on shifting sand  
  
Chorus  
  
Hurry come up in the blink of an eye  
You crowned yourself king of the castle high  
Youll never get to heaven if you tell a lie  
Theres a hole in your bucket and your wells run dry  
  
Chorus  
  
Hurry come up weve got nothing to say  
We sit back and watch you give yourself away  
Wheres all the power now theyve pulled the plug  
Youre up to your neck in the hole you dug  
  
Chorus  
  
Hurry come up your edges are rough  
We need a little love aint life tough enough  
Theres no coming back your tickets one way  
Your journey dont start till judgment day  
  
Chorus  
  
Hurry come up just a fast as you can  
Times running out for your master plan  
Cards on the table enough is enough  
They hold the aces now they call your bluff  
  
Chorus  
  
Hurry come up when you turn off the light  
How do you sleep in your bed at night  
Its all a bad dream but noone can hear  
You only have yourself to fear  
  
Chorus
