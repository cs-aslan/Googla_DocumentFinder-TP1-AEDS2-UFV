I hung up the phone tonight  
Just as you said I love you  
Once this would have been coincidence  
Now these things start to bother me  
You still close your eyes when I kiss you  
And I close mine too  
But we didnt open them again  
Quite as wide as we should  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends  
  
Does your touch feel the same as it should do  
Or is it someone quite similar  
Who killed me with kindness last night  
Now do I look at all familiar  
But none of these things seem to matter  
Since weve grown apart  
Id put back the pieces of whats shattered  
But I dont know where to start  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
And I feel like a clown  
Its tearing me up  
Its tearing me down  
  
You say which are the lies that you tell me  
Well where do I begin  
So I turn on the TV again  
And the world comes crashing in  
Is it my shirt or my toothpaste  
That is whiter than white  
Is it the lies that I tell you  
Or the lies that I might  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends
