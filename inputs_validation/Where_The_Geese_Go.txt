You get the burn  
Were on the train  
I feel no pain  
I feel no pain  
  
You set the sights  
But Im already there  
Do you care  
Do you care  
  
I cant get it out of my head  
When you said  
Im gonna leave  
  
I felt surprised  
That you wanted to know  
Where the geese go to  
Late at night  
Im feeling fine  
What is it inside  
Its inside  
  
And I cant get it out of my head  
When he said  
Im leaving
