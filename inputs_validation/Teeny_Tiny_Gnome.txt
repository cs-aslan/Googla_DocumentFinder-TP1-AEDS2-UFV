Kickin stones on an old dirt road  
Feelin ddejected and all alone  
When I looked up ahead thought my mind Id blown  
On a giant toadstool sat a teeny tiny gnome  
  
He was all involved in a game of solitaire  
Said hello with a smile just like I wasnt there  
I kicked dirt some more  
He said please dont start a fight  
Found a church key in his pocket he opened up his pipe  
  
He blew some silver circles  
Wound his fingers in his beard  
And from that pipe came magic music  
Like Id never heard  
  
As the notes came floatin in I pricked up both my ears  
I walked up to the drivein hadnt felt so starved in years  
A rabbit waiter took my order and quickly disappeared  
He said the partys over  
Please come back in a thousand years
