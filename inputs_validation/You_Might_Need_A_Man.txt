I knew the day that I would stand by you and all your  
Failings  
Now Im looking out for me  
If you want to split then I wont tell a soul about you  
Darling just you wait and youll see  
  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
  
I never thought Id see the day youd ever try to leave  
Me  
Now youve packed your bags and youve gone  
All the money in the world wont help you darling  
Take a look and see what youve done  
  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
  
And though the craziness of city life surrounds you  
Darling  
Just because you follow every trend  
Come the day you find yourself alone and feeling  
Restless  
Thats the day youre going to need a friend  
  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
  
You might need a man mmm  
Ah let me be your man  
You might need a man like me  
I wanna be that man  
You might need a man like me  
Oh let me be your man  
  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me
