I seem to walk on ice  
Some things make me think twice  
When I get that resistance  
Like having freedom with my hands tied  
  
Ive censored whats inside way too long  
I cant live so black and white  
Somebody listen  
Somebody say whats on your mind  
  
Ive got the wheels of the reckless  
Im gonna scream on the edges  
  
Wake up the house start the clock work  
Turn on the lights anybody home  
Break all the glass on my windows  
Wake up the house so Im not alone  
Disturb this neighborhood  
Maybe itll do some good  
You know what Im missing  
When everybodys asleep at night  
  
Somebodys got to tlak  
Might as well be my job yeah  
Maybe somebodys listening  
You know Ive censored this heart too long  
  
Ive got the wheels of the restless  
Im gonna scream on the edges  
  
Wake up the house start the clock work  
Turn on all the lights anybody home  
Break all the glass on my windows  
Wake up the house so Im not alone  
  
I cant live so black and white  
You know what Im missing  
Somethings making me think twice  
Is anybody listening
