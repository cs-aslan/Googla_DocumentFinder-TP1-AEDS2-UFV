Loving you has gotten weird  
Youll see the sun hanging low down by your window  
And all the rain left in the world  
Wont bring you home again  
Oh Carol Lynn  
  
And trusting you has gotten strange  
Youll close the door when the cold has gotten in  
And all the love left in the world  
Wont keep you warm again  
Oh Carol Lynn  
  
When you need a friend to be there for you  
I wont be one who will help you out  
And when you need someone who can let you in  
You can count me out  
Oh Carol Lynn  
  
When your life has worn you out  
Youll have the past left for you to think about  
And all the money in the world  
Cant take you back again  
Oh Carol Lynn  
Oh Carol Lynn
