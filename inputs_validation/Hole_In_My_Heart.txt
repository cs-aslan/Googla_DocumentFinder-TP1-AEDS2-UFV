Ive got a ticket no turning back  
My destination  
The sea of trouble the land of pain  
Youre sending me where it always rains  
Oh reconsider Im begging you some hesitation  
Im holding on to my sanity  
I feel the beginning of emergency  
My hands are slipping oh please dont let me fall into  
  
Chorus  
This hole in my heart that goes all the way to china  
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of  
This empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to China  
And though you cant see the bottom believe me its a long way down  
  
Im on a planet without a plan  
Its oh so lonely  
I need to see you to get out of here  
Theres something deadly in this atmosphere  
Im in a desert without a drink of your sweet water  
Youre my oasis in the burning sand  
Im out of danger when you touch my hand  
Throw me a lifeline Im standing on the edge of  
  
Chorus  
  
The gun was loaded I didnt know  
I pulled the trigger  
I heard a noise then the room went dark  
I felt the bullet going in my heart  
I feel so dizzy oh please dont let me fall dont leave me in  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive got a hole in my heart  
Youve got to fill it up with love
