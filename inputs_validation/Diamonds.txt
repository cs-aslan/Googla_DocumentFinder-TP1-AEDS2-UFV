Ive got people to see places to go  
Deadlines to meet a reputation to uphold  
Its like a ton of bricks breaking on my back  
Its like the force of gravity in full effect  
  
I got money to burn and Im on the sake  
They bet their bomb on me cause Im their ace of spades  
I feel the walls getting closer  
Im like a bomb with all red wires  
  
All this pressure all this pressure  
Maybe it means Im gonna be  
All this pressure all this pressure  
Maybe this means Im gonna be  
  
A diamond it wont ever bend  
A diamond cause theyre ladies best friends  
A diamond but there there has to be more  
Than what these pirates are gambling for  
  
If not for the push Id probably be a pebble  
If not for the pressure Id be forgotten forever  
Just another stone skipped upon the water  
Drowning fast before the other failures  
  
I dont wanna be a distant memory on your wall  
Just another cd that you burned and never bought  
Am I not worth it to you after all that drama  
That weve been though  
  
All this pressure all this pressure  
Maybe it means Im gonna be  
All this pressure all this pressure  
Maybe this means Im gonna be  
  
A diamond it wont ever bend  
A diamond cause theyre ladies best friends  
A diamond but there there has to be more  
Than what these pirates are gambling for  
  
Ooh ooh diamond  
Ive gotta be a diamond  
Im a diamond in the sky  
With you standing by  
Now catch me if I fall  
Oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
All this pressure all this pressure  
Oh Ive gotta be oh Ive gotta be  
All this pressure all this pressure  
Oh Ive gotta be oh Ive gotta be  
  
Im a diamond in the sky  
With you standing by  
Now catch me if I fall  
Into the arms of a coma  
  
All this pressure Ive got pressure  
Im gonna be a diamond baby Ive gotta be a diamond  
Youre gonna see Im gonna be a diamond
