Everythings different  
My head in the clouds  
  
I hit this corner  
With my foot on the gas  
I started sliding I lose it  
Everythings different just like that  
  
Oh my God wait and see  
What will soon become of me  
Frozen heart  
Screaming wheels  
Does that screaming come from me  
So damn lucky when you went on ahead  
You say you say  
I see you later  
I heard what you said a few minutes later  
Im sliding  
Everythings different again  
  
Oh my God wait and see  
What will soon become of me  
This frozen heart  
Screaming wheels  
But does that screaming come from me  
Im dizzy from all this spinning  
Now Im thinking that you did all you could  
  
When you said my love  
Take it slowly  
Ok is what I said  
Oh my God wait and see  
What will soon become of me  
Frozen heart  
Screaming wheels  
  
But does that screaming come from me  
Take me back just before I was spinning  
Take me back just before I got dizzy  
Take me back amazing what a minute can do  
Just like you  
  
So so so so up around around around  
Amazing what a minute can do  
Around around around  
Ok
