Ive got a job I explore I follow every little whiff  
And I want my life to smell like this  
To find a place an ancient race  
The kind youd like to gamble with  
Where theyd stamp on burning bags of shit  
Looking for a place to happen  
Making stops along the way  
  
Wayward ho Away we go  
Its a shame to leave this masterpiece  
With its gallery gods and its garbagebag trees  
So Ill paint a scene from memory  
So Id know who murdered me  
Its a vain pursuit but it helps me to sleep  
Looking for a place to happen  
Making stops along the way  
  
Jacques Cartier right this way  
Ill put your coat up on the bed  
Hey man youve got a real bums eye for clothes  
And come on in sit right down  
No youre not the first to show  
Weve all been here since God who knows  
Looking for a place to happen  
Making stops along the way
