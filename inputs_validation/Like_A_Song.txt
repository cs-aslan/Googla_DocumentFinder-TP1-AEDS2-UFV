Like a song I have to sing  
I sing it for you  
Like the words I have to bring  
I bring it for you  
  
And in leather lace and chains we stake our claim  
Revolution once again  
No I wont I wont wear it on my sleeve  
I can see through this expression and you know I dont believe  
Too old to be told exactly who are you  
Tonight tomorrows too late  
  
And we love to wear a badge a uniform  
And we love to fly a flag  
But I wont let others live in hell  
As we divide against each other  
And we fight amongst ourselves  
Too set in our ways to try to rearrange  
Too right to be wrong in this rebel song  
Let the bells ring out  
Let the bells ring out  
Is there nothing left  
Is there is there nothing  
Is there nothing left  
Is honesty what you want  
  
A generation without name ripped and torn  
Nothing to lose nothing to gain  
Nothing at all  
And if you cant help yourself  
Well take a look around you  
When others need your time  
You say its time to go its your time  
Angry words wont stop the fight  
Two wrongs wont make it right  
A new heart is what I need  
Oh God make it bleed  
Is there nothing left
