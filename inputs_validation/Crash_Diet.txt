Crash diet of redsnludes  
A shot of vitamin C and a bottle of booze  
Too stupid to live with nothin to lose  
In your one track mind now  
Wheres that leave you  
  
Drinkndrive white lightning faster baby  
Takin your last ride  
Now better be so careful or youll be dead before you time  
Sorry you took mothers car now  
  
Tears in my eyes baby please dont go  
You bet  one too many now one for the road  
Fresh outta detox fresh from jail  
Took your rehabilitation and you drove me to hell  
  
Drinkndrive white lightning faster  
Takin your last ride  
Better be so careful or youll be dead before your time  
Sorry you took mohters car now  
  
Too soon you thought   
Too late for the pressure and strain  
Too bad for those who dont believe it  
Ruby street still calls your name  
  
guitar solo  
  
Itchy trigger finger and the race to be alive  
Smokin a cig while you drinkndrive  
With no control in your life ahead  
Youre never gonna see if you wind up dead  
  
Drinkndrive white lightning faster  
Takin your last ride  
Better be so careful or youll be dead before your time  
Drinkndrive white lightning baby  
Its always on your mind  
Push or pull your limits baby do it one more time  
Break it down  
Break it down  
Somethins changin somethins breakin  
You gotta be a brother coz Your family  
 Oh make it  
Sweet mystery Ooohhhh  
If you dont care about yourself  
Would you please leave me alive  
Oooohhhh  
You gonna  
You gonna drinkndrive  
Oooohhhhh Yeeaaah
