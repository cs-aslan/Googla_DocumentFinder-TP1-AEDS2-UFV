The kids are ok  
Theyre telling you now  
But youre letting them down  
Cause you just dont know how  
And its a golden opportunity  
  
Im spinning in space  
Im laughing away  
Your so pathetic  
I can just hear them say  
Its like a golden opportunity  
  
You better hear it  
See hear it  
Its a golden opportunity  
You better hear it  
Get near it  
Its a golden opportunity  
  
We reckon theyre rats  
Now see how they run  
My house is so common  
And were dumb were so dumb  
And its a golden opportunity  
  
Scream all you suckers  
Scream all you can  
Im losing my bluff  
Its a scam its a scam  
And its a golden opportunity  
  
You better hear it  
You better hear it hear it  
Its like a golden opportunity  
You better hear it  
You better hear it hear it  
Its like a golden opportunity  
Alright  
You better hear it hear it  
Hear it hear it  
Its a golden opportunity  
Hear it  
Hear it  
Its a golden opportunity  
You better hear it  
You better hear it  
Its a golden opportunity  
You better hear it  
You better hear it  
Its a golden opportunity
