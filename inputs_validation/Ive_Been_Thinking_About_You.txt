Weve known each other  
For a long long time  
But I never really noticed  
All the magic in your eyes  
Ive been around you  
A thousand times before  
And youve always been a friend to me  
But now Im wanting more  
I must have been so blind  
I never realized  
Youre the one thats right for me  
All the while I couldnt see  
And now I feel so strange  
Ill never be the same  
Going round and round in circles  
And I dont know what to do  
Cause baby  
  
Ive been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
  
Ive been thinking about you  
Its unbelievable to me  
  
But suddenly I think  
Im falling in love with you  
  
Theres no explaining how I feel inside  
Im going thru a transformation  
Thats so hard for me to hide  
I had a revelation that  
Finally opened up my eyes  
The one I spent a lifetime searching for  
Was right here all the time  
I was oblivious so very out of touch  
All the while I couldnt see  
Youre the one thats right for me  
And now my world has changed  
Ill never be the same  
Going round and round in circles  
And its all because of you  
Sweet baby  
  
Ive been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
Ive been thinking about you  
Its unbelievable to me  
  
But suddenly I think  
Im falling in love with you  
  
Ive been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
  
Ive been thinking about you  
Its unbelievable to me  
  
But suddenly I think  
Im falling in love with you  
  
Dont you know  
That youre blowing my mind  
What you do to me  
I cant describe  
Baby I cant hold back anymore  
I just cant conceal it  
Youre the one I really adore  
  
Ive been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
  
Ive been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
  
Ive been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
  
Ive been thinking about you  
Its unbelievable to me  
But suddenly I think  
Im falling in love with you
