Am I dreaming baby  
Are you for real  
  
Verse One  
Ol Skool  
Things are kind of hazy  
And my heads all cloudy inside  
Now Ive heard talk of angels baby  
But never thought I would have one to call mine  
  
Tiny  
See you are just too good to be true  
And I hope theres not some kind of mirage  
With you oh baby  
  
Chorus  
Am I dreamin  
Am I just imagining youre here in my life  
Am I dreamin  
Pinch me to see if its real  
Cause my mind cant decide  
  
Verse Two  
Ol Skool Will this last for one night  
Kandi Or do I have you for a lifetime  
Ol Skool Please say that its forever  
And that its not an illusion to my eye  
  
LaTocha  
And I hope that you just dont up and disappear  
My love I pray  
That its not a hoax and its for real oh  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Ol Skool Baby I know  
Sometime say that sometime  
I need you to show me girl  
Show me that youre not a mirage  
LaTocha Oh baby I need you I need you I need you  
Oh I need you to pinch me baby  
Ol Skool I need you to pinch me baby  
Am I dreamin baby  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Break  
Ol Skool My mind cant decide no no  
LaTocha Oh baby  
Touch me baby feel me baby  
Ol Skool I want to know if youll be right there  
LaTocha Oh oh oh  
Ol Skool I want to know if youll be right there  
Tell me this is not an illusion  
LaTocha Touch me baby I want you to feel me baby  
Ol Skool Somebody let me know  
I want to know if youll be right there  
If its real  
This is not a mirage no
