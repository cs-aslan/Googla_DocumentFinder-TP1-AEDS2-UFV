FLOWERS FOR MAMA  
WRITERS EDDIE NOACK CINDY WALKER AL RUMLEY  
Papa brought flowers for mama today  
And all the grown children but its not mothers day  
I dont have no money not even a dime  
But I brought mama flowers like I have all the time  
Everyday I pick flowers from this pretty hill  
A small box of Daisies and a few Daffodils  
I bring them to mama at the end of the day  
And say flowers for mama heres mamas bouquet  
They brighten her face and she holds me close  
Shed say they are more precious than a beautiful rose  
And she wore a smile sweeter than millions of flowers  
A smile that Ill carry through lifes darkest hours  
Spoken  
Now mama was lying there yes they tell me she passed away  
And she was surrounded by flowers that outshined my bouquet  
I know mine arent fancy but still all the while  
They were placed in her hand and I know I saw mama smile  
Sang  
Flowers for mama I picked them today  
Not very much just a simple bouquet  
Mom wasnt so fancy but up there above  
Shes the prettiest flower in Gods garden of love
