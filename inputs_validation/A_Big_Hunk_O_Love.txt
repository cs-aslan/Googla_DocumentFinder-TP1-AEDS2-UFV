Hey baby I aint askin much of you  
No no no no no no no no  
Baby I aint askin much of you  
Just a big a big a big a hunk o love will do  
  
Dont be a stingy little mama  
Youre bout to starve me half to death  
Now you can spare a kiss or two  
And still have plenty left  
  
Oh no no baby  
I aint askin much of you  
Just a big a big a big a hunk o love will do  
Thats right  
  
Youre just a natural born beehive  
Filled with honey to the top  
But I aint greedy baby  
All I want is all you got  
  
Oh no no  
Baby I aint askin much of you  
Just a big a big a big a hunk o love will do  
Thats right  
  
I got a wishbone in my pocket  
I got a rabbit foot around my wrist  
Id have all of the things my lucky charms could bring  
If you give me just a one sweet kiss  
  
Oh no no no no no no no no  
Baby I aint askin much of you  
Just a big a hunk o hunk o hunk o love will do  
Just a big a big a big a hunk o love will do  
Just a big a big a big a hunk o love will do
