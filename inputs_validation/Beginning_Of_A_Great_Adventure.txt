It might be fun to have a kid that I could kick around  
a little me to fill up with my thoughts  
A little me or he or she to fill up with my dreams  
a way of saying life is not a loss  
  
Id keep the tyke away from school and tutor him myself  
keep him from the poison of the crowd  
But then again pristine isolation might not be the best idea  
its not good trying to immortalize yourself  
  
Beginning of a great adventure  
Beginning of a great adventure  
  
Why stop at one I might have ten a regular TV brood  
Id breed a little liberal army in the wood  
Just like these redneck lunatics I see at the local bar  
with their tribe of mutant inbred piglets with cloven hooves  
  
Id teach em how to plant a bomb start a fire play guitar  
and if they catch a hunter shoot him in the nuts  
Id try to be as progressive as I could possibly be  
as long as I dont have to try too much  
  
Beginning of a great adventure  
Beginning of a great adventure  
  
Susie Jesus Bogart Sam Leslie Jill and Jeff  
Rita Winny Andy Fran and Jet  
Boris Bono Lucy Ethel Bunny Reg and Tom  
thats a lot of names to try not to forget  
  
Carrie Marlon Mo and Steve La Rue and Jerry Lee  
Eggplant Rufus Dummy Star and The Glob  
Id need a damn computer to keep track of all these names  
I hope this baby thing dont go too far  
  
I hope its true what my wife said to me  
I hope its true what my wife said to me hey  
I hope its true what my wife said to me  
  
She says Baby its the beginning of a great adventure  
Babe beginning of a great adventure  
take a look  
  
It might be fun to have a kid that I could kick around  
create in my own image like a god  
Id raise my own pallbearers to carry me to my grave  
and keep me company when Im a wizened toothless clod  
  
Some gibbering old fool sitting all alone drooling on his shirt  
some senile old fart playing in the dirt  
It might be fun to have a kid I could pass something on to  
something better than rage pain anger and hurt  
  
I hope its true what my wife said to me  
I hope its true what my wife said to me  
I hope its true what my wife said to me  
She says Lou its the beginning of a great adventure  
Lou Lou Lou beginning of a great adventure  
She says babe how you call your lover boy  
Sylvia quite you call your lover man
