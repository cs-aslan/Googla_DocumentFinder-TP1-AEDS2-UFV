Dont get me waiting  
And anticipating  
Treating me like a fool  
I got news for you  
Im turning my back  
Im dropping a bomb on you  
Ah  
  
You want me  
You need me  
Believe me  
Youll be crawling  
You love me  
You hate me  
Believe me  
Youll come crawling  
  
So get down and get off  
Let me show you what youll be missing  
We break up you break down  
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming  
  
Dont keep me guessing  
Im your favorite obsession  
To give me a lame excuse  
Its with me that your messing  
Its the same old confession  
Your no one that something would lose  
  
Ah  
Watch out now  
Dont black out  
Theres no doubt  
You cant have it  
Control you  
Ill own you  
Ill show you but you still cant have it  
  
So get down and get off  
Let me show you what youll be missing  
We break up you break down  
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming  
So get down and get it off  
Youre not the only one that Ive been missing  
We break up you break down  
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming  
  
Youll be kicking and screaming  
Youll be kicking and screaming  
Im so deceiving  
Youll be kicking and screaming  
  
Watch out now  
Youll find out  
Youll cry out  
Theres no one above me  
I play hard  
Dont run far  
Come back now  
I really do like you  
  
So get down and get off  
Let me show you what youll be missing  
We break up you break down  
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming  
So get down and get off  
Youre not the only one that Ive been missing  
We break up you break down  
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming  
  
Youll be kicking and screaming  
Youll be kicking and screaming  
Kicking and screaming  
Kicking and screaming
