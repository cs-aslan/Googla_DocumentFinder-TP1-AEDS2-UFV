Morning seems strange almost out of place  
Searched hard for you and your special ways  
These days these days  
  
Spent all my time learnt a killers art  
Took threats and abuse till Id learned the part  
Can you stay for these days  
  
These days these days  
  
Used outward deception to get away  
Broken heart romance to make it pay  
  
These days these days  
  
Well drift through it all its the modern age  
Take care of it all now these debts are paid  
Can you stay for these days
