For so long  
You and me been finding each other for so long  
And the feeling that I feel for you is more than strong girl  
Take it from me  
If you give a little more than youre asking for  
Your love will turn the key  
Darling mine  
I would wait forever for those lips of wine  
Build my world around you darling  
This love will shine girl  
Watch it and see  
If you give a little more than youre asking for  
Your love will turn the key  
  
I I just want to be your everything  
Open up the heaven in your heart and let me be  
The things you are to me and not some puppet on a string  
Oh baby mine if Id stay here without you darlin I would die  
I want you laying in the love I have to bring  
Id do anything to be your evrything
