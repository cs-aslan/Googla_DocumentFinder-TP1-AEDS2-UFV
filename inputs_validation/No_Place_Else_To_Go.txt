The sun goes down and you come around with evening  
Saying that you love ah but I know  
That it really isnt tenderness youre feelin  
Youre here cause youve got no place else to go  
Youll ask how Ive been doin and youll smile that same old smile  
Youll touch my cheek and turn the lights down low  
Well kiss and Ill forget for just a while  
That youre here cause youve got no place else to go  
Ah no place else to go and no place else to be  
No one else to take you in but good old easy me  
When morning comes I tell myself Ill never  
Do this again but deep iseide I know  
Im here because Im bound to you forever  
And youre here cause youve got no place else to go  
 fiddle  steel   
Im here because Im bound to you forever  
And youre here cause youve got no place else to go
