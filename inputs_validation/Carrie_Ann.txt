Time stands still baby when I touch you  
I cant believe the way Im feelin  
Please dont speak its taken me all this time  
To find the strength just to say  
  
That I never knew what love was til I met you  
Never thought that I could act this way  
But Im still afraid to show how much I need you  
Tell me what makes a man like me this way  
  
Carrie Ann dont ask me why  
Baby I work so hard just to hide my emotions  
Carrie Ann words cant explain  
The way that I feel in my heart  
  
Lovers hearts never quite beat in time  
They never find that perfect rhythm  
You know I let you down many times  
But this I promise to you  
That Ill never lead you through doors of deception  
I wont bind you to a chain of lies  
Though I know my love for you wont be perfection  
What I give to you will last all time  
  
Carrie Ann dont ask me why  
Baby I work so hard just to hide my emotions  
Carrie Ann my words cant explain  
The way that I feel in my heart  
  
Take a little time to realize  
Ill love you faithfully  
Just take a little time and youll see  
That baby its me  
  
Carrie Ann dont ask me why  
Baby I work so hard just to hide my emotions  
Carrie Ann my words cant explain  
The way that I feel in my heart
