I got a letter in the mail sayin Im gonna go to jail  
Someones got an ax  
Lookin it out for me  
Well I was feelin pretty nice didnt have to think twice  
Finders keepers baby keep it away from me  
  
You got nothin that I need  
Stay away from me  
Ill quicken your pace to heaven  
You try to give me your lot  
Well I hope you rot  
Gonna tell the devil about you  
  
Chorus 1  
Youre gettin me in trouble  
Youre gettin me in trou  
Gettin me in trouble  
Every day and night  
  
Im alright  
Well Im a high speed king I never think about a thing  
All I can do is moan  
  
Everybody takes a turn from the trash I have learned  
But why the hard way for me I dont know  
  
Im gonna get you back  
Stab you in the fat  
Ill make you wish you never met me  
I gonna make you sing the blues  
Youre gonna lose  
Show you what you got yourself into  
  
Chorus 2  
Youre gettin me in trouble  
Youre Gettin me in trouble  
Gettin me in trouble  
Every day and night  
  
Im all  
You try to put the weight of the world  
On top of my shoulders  
You got to know that youre a little girl  
Who wants to feel older feel older watch out  
  
Trouble yeah  
Trouble yeah yeah  
Im in trouble baby oh yeah  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Im in trouble trouble trouble alright  
Im in trouble trouble trouble  
Trouble trouble trouble  
Trouble trouble trouble
