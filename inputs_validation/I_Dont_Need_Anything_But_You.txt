Warbucks and annie  
  
Together at last  
Together for ever  
Were tying a knot  
They never can sever  
  
Warbucks  
  
I dont need sunshine now  
To turn my skies at blue   
  
Warbucks and annie  
  
I dont need anything but you  
  
Warbucks  
  
Youve wrapped me around  
That cute little finger  
Youve made life a song  
Youve made me the singer  
  
Annie  
  
And whats the bathtub tune  
You always BuBuBoo  
  
Warbucks  
  
BuBuBu  
Anything but you  
  
Annie  
  
Yesterday was plain awful  
  
Warbucks  
  
You can say that again  
  
Annie  
  
Yesterday was plain awful  
  
Warbucks  
  
But thats  
  
Annie  
  
Not now  
  
Warbucks and annie  
  
Thats then  
  
Annie  
  
Im poor as a mouse  
  
Warbucks  
  
Im richer than Midas  
  
Warbucks and annie  
  
But nothing on earth  
Could ever divide us  
And if tomorrow I  
m an apple seller too  
I dont need anything but you  
  
Servants  
  
All  
  
Annie Annie  
You filled our life with a song  
  
Theyre two of a kind  
The happiest pair now  
Like Fred and Adelle theyre floating  
On air now  
And whats the title of the dream that just came true  
  
Warbucks  
  
I dont need anything  
  
Annie  
  
Anything  
  
All  
  
Anything  
I dont need anything  
But you
