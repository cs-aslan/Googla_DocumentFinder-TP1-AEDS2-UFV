There we are as cold as ice  
Asking me to love you  
And after be your friend  
There you are I walk alone  
Telling me to love you  
And after we all did  
  
She told me she forgiving me  
A lot time Love forever true  
But she left me for another man  
And Im singing to keep from feelin blue

And I am so sad and lonely  
Tell me what will I do

And happy with your feelin blue
