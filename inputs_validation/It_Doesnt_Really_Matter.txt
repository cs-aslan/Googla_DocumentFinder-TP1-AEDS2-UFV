It doesnt really matter that I loved you  
How many reasons call  
It doesnt really matter at all  
It doesnt really matter that I failed to  
Break down your fathers wall  
It doesnt really matter at all  
  
Why tell me you dont understand when you do  
I thought I had something to say  
  
But it doesnt really matter at all  
I changed my name to be rid of the things that I want from you  
Its strange but the name is a name and the truth is a truth  
  
Oh there is always always someone there to remind me  
So I learn to live with shame  
I tell myself I feel no pain  
But I do and if I have to tell you  
  
Then it doesnt really matter at all  
And its no good looking back  
Because time is a thief and I believe that Im too old for that  
Were just saying the things that we have said forever  
  
It doesnt really matter that I loved you  
How many reasons fall  
Its too bad  
It really doesnt matter at all
