Crocodile  
No you wont make me jealous  
That she left me for him  
Scene one standing  
Crushed on landing  
You may have walked out  
But Ill swallow up my fate  
Scene two sitting  
Man in kitchen  
Bit cold and lifeless like  
The burger on my plate  
But theres one emotion Im afraid of  
Hear him scratching gently to be fed  
I cant stand it when he sits there smiling  
I dont want him nesting in my head  
Crocodile  
No you wont make me jealous  
That she left me for him  
Get away  
Crocodile  
No you wont make me jealous  
Im not letting you in  
Scene three lying through his backteeth  
Speared and dying bitten beneath  
Ill crawl the wall to hand there  
Skinned and stuffed with drink  
But theres one emotion Im controlling  
Green eyed monster with his jaws spread wide  
But hes your pet now  
You cant run away and hide  
I cant stand it when he sits there crying  
I dont want to throw myself inside  
Crocodile  
Getaway  
Crocodile  
With the jaded jealous smile
