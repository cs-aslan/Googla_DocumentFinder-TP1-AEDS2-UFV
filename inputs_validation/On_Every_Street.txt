Theres gotta be a record of you someplace  
You gotta be on somebodys books  
The lowdown a picture of your face  
Your injured looks  
The sacred and profane  
The pleasure and the pain  
Somewhere your fingerprints remain concrete  
And its your face Im looking for on every street  
  
A ladykiller regulation tattoo  
Silver spurs on his heels  
Says what can I tell you as Im standing next to you  
She threw herself under my wheels  
Oh its a dangerous road  
And a hazardous load  
And the fireworks over liberty explode in the heat  
And its your face Im looking for on every street  
  
A threechord symphony crashes into space  
The moon is hanging upside down  
I dont know why it is Im still on the case  
Its a ravenous town  
And you still refuse to be traced  
Seems to me such a waste  
And every victory has a taste thats bittersweet  
And its your face Im looking for on every street
