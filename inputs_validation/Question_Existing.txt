Take off my shirt loosen the buttons and undo my skirt  
Stare at myself in the mirror  
Take me apart piece by piece  
Sorrow decrease pressure release  
I put in work  
Did more than called upon more than deserved  
When it was over did I wind up hurt Yes  
But it taught me before a decision ask this question first  
  
Chorus  
Who am I living for  
Is this my limit can I endure some more  
Chances are given question existing  
Who am I living for  
Is this my limit can I endure some more  
Chances are given question existing  
  
Take off my cool  
Show them that under here Im just like you  
Do the mistakes Ive made make me a fool  
Or a human with flaws  
Admit that Im lost round of applause  
Take the abuse  
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose  
Its entertainment is that an excuse No  
But the question that lingers whether win or lose  
  
Chorus  
  
Dear diary  
Its Robyn  
Entertaining is something I do for a living  
Its not who I am  
Id like to think that Im pretty normal  
I laugh I get mad I hurt I think I suck sometimes  
But when youre in the spotlight everything seems good  
Ooo yeah  
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst cause I have to always keep my guard up  
I dont know who to trust I dont know who wants to date me for who I am  
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am  
  
Chorus
