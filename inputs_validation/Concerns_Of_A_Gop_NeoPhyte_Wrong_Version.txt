Truth  
Now like a viral infection  
The GOP developed a vaccine  
Get your shot from your local Christian reading room  
Make sure your clothes are blue and neoprene  
  
Windows closed  
Televisions on  
Talk show radio  
Where everyone agrees  
The plague is here  
But exposure is avoidable  
Turn up mind relinquish control  
  
Question  
Citizens questioning leader  
Dont want to set a precedent  
Were going ask all the questions  
Like what kind of patriot are you  
When did you check out the Trotsky  
What is your major malfunction  
  
Traitor  
To the lord and creator  
Fucking communist faggot  
An infidel living among us  
Procreating liberal hippie  
Disgrace yourself and your country  
Why dont you love it or leave it  
  
I wasnt thinking of me  
I wasnt thinking clearly  
My deepest apologies  
I wasnt thinking of me  
I wasnt thinking of me  
I wasnt thinking of me  
I wasnt thinking of me  
I wasnt thinking of me  
I wasnt thinking of me  
I wasnt thinking of me  
I wasnt thinking of me  
I wasnt thinking  
  
Benevolence blinded  
Tolerance indicted  
Why dont you love it or leave it
