I sing to the sun in the sky  
I sing to the sun raised high  
  
Carnival dancer magical time of youth  
And as the day draws nigh  
Dreams fill my heart  
Ill sing while he raises guitar  
Ill sing as the night wakes the dawn  
Will love come my way on this magical day  
And will hope stay in my heart  
  
Carnival dancer magical time of youth  
And as the day draws nigh  
Dreams fill my heart and  
Sing while he raises guitar  
Ill sing my dream from afar  
Will love come my way on this magical day  
And will hope stay in my heart  
Will true love come my way on this magical day  
Overlook oh my love  
In my  
  
Stay oh dear  
Stay oh dear  
Stay  
In my  
You  
You  
stay again  
The way youre walking and walk the way you can  
The way youre telling me youre not a danger  
This man I said again I say again  
Im not too kind to the moon  
Telling me well I watch you  
Kin to you  
You
