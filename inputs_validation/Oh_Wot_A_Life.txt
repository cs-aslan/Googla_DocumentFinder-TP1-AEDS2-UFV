2 3 4  
I wanna get back home  
But the bar wont close  
Till ten and thirty tonight  
Oh boy good God wot a life  
Some cat down there  
Split his head wide open  
And the doctor died of fright  
Oh wot a life  
Every woman I see she says to me  
Get back to your wife  
  
Everyone I know got their little problems  
Boy I wanna see some life  
The Fender got busted in the second set  
And the pickups up the pike  
And the Leslie sound goes round and round  
And round and round  
  
Oh boy good God wot a life  
Get back in my car like a movie star  
Its an Austin Healey Sprite huh  
Oh boy wot a life  
I think Ill go dig some weeds down at Mrs Gs  
Cut the crossbar off her bike  
Oh wot a life  
  
Every woman I see they say to me  
Now you know what I like  
Every woman I see they fix me up  
Saying Get back to your wife  
Next numbers called paranoia  
Its the story of my life  
And the gigs we do take me down and down  
And down and down and down  
Good God wot a life  
  
Now the next number we do is called paranoia  
Its the story of my life  
Oh grr wot a life  
Alright may as well get out of here now
