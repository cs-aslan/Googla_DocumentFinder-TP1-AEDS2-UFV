I know that its time for a change  
Mmm but when that change comes  
Will you still feel the same  
  
How many times have I tried to turn this love around  
I dont want to give up  
But baby its time I had two feet on the ground  
Can you release me  
Can you release me  
Now that youre gone I cant help myself from wondering  
Oh if youd have come down from your high  
Would weve been all right  
Release me  
Can you release me  
  
Come on baby come on baby  
You knew it was time to just let go  
Cause we want to be free  
But somehow its just not that easy  
Come on Darlin hear me Darlin  
Cause youre a waste of time for me  
Im trying to make you see  
That baby youve just got to release me  
Release me  
Release me  
Im not going back to you anymore  
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow  
So stop coming around my door  
Cause youre not gonna find  
What youre looking for  
  
Come on baby come on baby  
You knew it was time to just let go  
Cause we want to be free  
But somehow its just not that easy  
Come on Darlin hear me Darlin  
Cause youre a waste of time for me  
Im trying to make you see  
That baby youve just got to release me  
Release me  
Release me  
Im not going back to you anymore  
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow  
So stop coming around my door  
Cause youre not gonna find  
What youre looking for  
  
What is this power youve got on me  
What is this power Oh  
What is it What is it  
  
Come on baby come on baby  
You knew it was time to just let go  
Cause we want to be free  
But somehow its just not that easy  
Come on Darlin hear me Darlin  
Cause youre a waste of time for me  
Im trying to make you see  
That baby youve just got to release me  
Release me  
Release me  
Im not going back to you anymore  
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow  
So stop coming around my door  
Cause youre not gonna find  
What youre looking for  
  
Release me  
Will you release me  
Ah Release me  
Will you release me
