Come on baby whats on your mind  
Youre stumbling in the darkness  
Like youre running blind  
Hey cant you see weve been fooling around  
This same old graveyard  
on the same playground  
Be my late night movie star  
By my nature I can tell who you are  
Through all lies its in your bedroom eyes  
Theres no innocence  
In your bedroom eyes  
Baby Baby  
Got no selfdefense  
For your bedroom eyes  
Over and over then we do it again  
Havent seen a stop sign since I dont know when  
Up and down this lonely street guess Ill see you around  
Is there any way to stop this merry go round  
Be my late night movie star  
By my nature I can tell who you are  
Through all lies its in your bedroom eyes  
Theres no innocence  
In your bedroom eyes  
Baby Baby  
Got no selfdefense  
For your bedroom eyes  
Over and over then we do it again  
Havent seen a stop sign since I dont know when  
Up and down this lonely street guess Ill see you around  
Is there any way to stop this merry go round
