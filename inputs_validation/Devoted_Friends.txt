jack hues  
If you have to leave after all that weve  
Been through been through  
Been through  
I cant be a friend if your heart has the end  
In view in view  
In view  
Chorus  
Because lovers never can be  
Just devoted friends  
How can we meet on a day in the week  
And be true be true  
Be true  
And how can I speak and pretend that Im happy for you  
For you for you  
Repeat chorus  
How can we meet on a day in the week  
And be true be true  
Be true  
And how can I speak and pretend that Im happy for you  
For you for you
