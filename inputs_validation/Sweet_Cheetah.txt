One night as I rolled down some long winding road  
I saw you and I knew I couldnt let you go  
Half child and all woman vision fantasy  
Lost against the moonlight bathed in ecstasy  
Leopards skin and cats eyes  
Has the jungle made you wild  
The prey youre after is you faster  
Will it make you smile  
Ride with me Ill set you free  
Chains cant hold us down  
I need you if you want me  
Lovers we are bound  
  
REFRAIN  
Sweet cheetah cheetah  
I love it when your claws run through me  
Fever fever I love it babe  
Come do it to me  
Cheetah cheetah  
I love it when your claws run through me  
Fever fever I love it babe  
Come do it to me now  
  
Skin tight you move in so slowly to thrill  
Waiting for the nightmare then youre in for the kill  
Amazon so sleekly you know what to do  
Eat the flesh and save my heart  
And leave it when youre through  
Pain and pleasures all mine  
Untamed and running wild  
Sink your teeth into me  
Lick your lips and smile  
Take my hand and ride the land  
Forever you and me  
Hold on tight to me all night  
And set your spirit free  
  
REFRAIN
