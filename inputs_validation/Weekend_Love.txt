Have you been misled  
Anything I said  
Didnt mean to turn you on  
The bite is oh so strong  
You got things to do  
But I have got things too  
So Ill catch you on the weekend  
Mondays to Fridays I dont see you then

Seems its been so long  
Since you thrilled me with your charms  
I tenderly imagine me  
Resting in your arms  
Youve got things to do  
And I have got things too  
So Ill catch you on the weekend  
Mondays to Fridays I dont see you then

Because were sorry when we part  
And we love when we meet  
I know we only do that   
Once in a week  
Sorry when we part  
And we love when we meet  
I know we only do that   
Once in a week  
Unknown Reggae Artist  
I know you know  
We all occupied  
From our own love life  
This has been denied  
Many feelins high  
Many tears of pride  
But by the weekend  
Let my spirit divide

Weekend love  
Gonna spend a weekend love maybe someday well change  
Weekend love

If youve been misled  
By anything Ive said  
Didnt mean to turn you on  
The bite was oh so strong  
Youve got things to do  
But I have got things too  
So Ill catch you on the weekend  
Mondays to Fridays I dont see you then

A WEEK and a END  
LOVE we were meant to be  
A WEEK a END  
LOVE we were meant to be

To nourish and cherish every moment  
To deliver the goods I am   
And I know youre possessed with the ingredients  
Till the weekend the days seems to be long  
But by the weekend I wish I could reverse its time  
Good things can come in a small bag  
So lets make use of the time that we have  
When we are together cause we stay popular  
  
When we are together you and I wonder  
If this love is gonna last forever  
Well then I think and I start remember  
That we are a  star  
Queen Latifah  
Weekend love  
Gonna spend a weekend love  
Weekend love  
Just a case of weekend love
