Going back to the memories  
Reminiscing bout you and me  
Thinking how it used to be  
Its plain and clear I treated you bad  
But girl you know that I care  
Every relation ship have wear and tear  
Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart says  
  
Many days and many nights  
Many heartbreaks many fights  
Many wrongs but so many rights  
So girl dont let this love die  
Never meant to cause you no pain  
Girl I never meant to treat you lame  
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again  
Dont let this love die  
  
Chorus  
Just Cry Baby Cry  
Dont cry no more  
Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean  
And rises to the sky  
And then the rain will come  
Right before the sun shines  
  
Can you feel me reaching out to you girl can you hear my open thoughts  
Never want to disrespect you girl dont let this come break us apart  
Cause I know I would die without you my girl can you hear my broken heart  
Its calling out to the good times that we had back at the start  
  
Baby Dont call me baby  
You know I need you in my life daily You know you played me  
I was a player but now your love changed me Dead wrong  
Im going crazy Im gone  
Never thought losing you would be so hard  
  
Its your turn to cry baby cry  
Dont cry no more  
Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean  
And rises to the sky  
And then the rain will come  
Right before the sun shines  
  
So let go  
And move on  
What we were  
Is now undone  
My tears have all dried  
Its your turn now to cry  
  
Youre losing your love and your trust for me girl  
And you know I would go to the ends of the world  
If you wanted Just like we started  
Girl cause I dont want to fight no more  
Make it like it was before
