Frosted windowpanes  
Candles gleaming inside  
Painted candy canes on the tree  
Santas on his way  
Hes filled his sleigh with things  
Things for you and me  
  
Its that time of year  
When the world falls in love  
Evry song you hear seems to say  
Merry Christmas  
May your New Year dreams come true  
And this song of mine  
In threequarter time  
Wishes you and yours  
The same thing too
