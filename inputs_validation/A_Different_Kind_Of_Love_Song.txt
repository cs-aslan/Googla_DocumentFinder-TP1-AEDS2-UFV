What if the world was crazy and I was sane  
Would it be so strange  
I cant believe that I am alone in saying  
The things Im saying  
I am a part of you  
  
These are universal truths  
Were all part of the light that flows through everything  
This is a different kind of love song  
Dedicated to everyone  
Different kind of love songohoh  
What if the world calmed down and we could all breath  
Together easily  
Connecting the sky and the ground with you and me  
And everything in between  
I am part of you  
  
We have living proof  
There is some kind of light that flows through everything  
This is a different kind of love song  
Dedicated to everyone  
Different kind of love songohoh  
This is a different kind of love song  
A higher plane we can flow on  
Different kind of love songohoh
