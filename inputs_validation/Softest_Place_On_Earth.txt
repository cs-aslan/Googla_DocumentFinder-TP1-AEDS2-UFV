Its a glowing little feeling  
Like a summer sun that slowly rises  
On a new horizon of love  
And its more exotic than Jamaica  
  
Or the rain that falls in Costa Rica  
Like a waterfall to the sea  
So tell me baby  
  
Do you want to fly I can take you high  
Come ride on these midnight skies  
If youre looking for Heavens only door  
Youve got the key baby open me  
  
Chorus  
Baby wont you come inside  
Ill take you on a fantasy ride  
Take a journey through my universe  
My loves the softest place on earth  
You dont have to pull the blinds  
Let the neighbours lose their minds  
Baby you can be the first  
Inside the softest place on earth  
  
Overflowing with emotion  
I can will you feel so sensual  
When I touch you you will lose all control  
Come on baby kiss me all over  
From my mountains to my valley low  
Theres an ocean of love just for you  
Just for you  
  
Do you want to fly I can take you high  
Come ride on these midnight skies  
If youre looking for Heavens only door  
Youve got the key baby open me  
  
Chorus  
  
So no more dreaming  
Your bodys steaming  
You want it baby this is your night  
I keep arising Im fantasizing  
  
I want it so bad Ill do what you like  
We can do it in the movies  
Or in my jacuzzi  
Or maybe Central Park  
  
So if theres any doubt  
To what Im all about  
So tell your friends Im turning you out  
  
Chorus
