Maybe you can move into a cabin  
And near a river down a lonely winding road  
Friendly conversation  
Then you read by candlelight  
  
Every word of every story told  
Maybe you can move into the castle  
Surrounded by the ivy covered walls  
Find a bit of paradise  
  
Where no one bothers you  
Only time they come is when you call  
  
Something I never realized about the city  
Once its in your heart its there to stay  
When you close your eyes you realize  
Its been there all along  
  
Home is where you live and where you lay  
Everywhere that you go it may seem funny  
You can hide if you want you can change your name  
  
Everywhere I look everyone I see  
Everywhere its all the same  
  
Something I never realized about the country  
Once its in your heart its there to stay  
When you close your eyes you realize  
Its been there all along  
  
Home is where you live and where you lay  
Everywhere that you go it may sound funny  
You can hide if you want you can change your name  
  
Everywhere I look  
Everyone I see  
Everywhere its all the same
