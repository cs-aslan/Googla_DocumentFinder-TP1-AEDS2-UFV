Remember O thou man  
O thou man O thou man  
Remember O thou man  
Thy time is spent  
  
Remember O thou man  
How thou camst to me then  
And I did what I can  
Therefore repent  
  
Remember Adams fall  
O thou man O thou man  
Remember Adams fall  
From heaven to hell  
  
Remember Adams fall  
How we were condemned all  
To hell perpetual  
There for to dwell  
  
Remember Gods goodness  
O thou man O thou man  
Remember Gods goodness  
And promise made  
  
Remember Gods goodness  
How His only Son He sent  
Our sins for to redress  
Be not afraid  
  
The angels all did sing  
O thou man O thou man  
The angels all did sing  
On Sion hill  
  
The angels all did sing  
Praises to our glorious King  
And peace to man living  
With a good will   
  
The Shepherds amazed was  
O thou man O thou man  
The Shepherds amazed was  
To hear the angels sing  
  
The Shepherds amazed was  
How it should come to pass  
That Christ our Messias  
Should be our King  
  
To Bethlehem did they go  
O thou man O thou man  
The shepherds three
