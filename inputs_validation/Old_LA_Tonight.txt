Look into the future  
Look into my eyes and tell me everythings all right  
Tell me where were going  
Im so afraid cause I dont know whats going on with my life  
  
But itll be all right tonight  
Will it be all right tonight  
Are we doin all right in old LA tonight  
  
Sitting by the ocean  
Mapping out my plans of action baby they include you  
I wish youd send a message  
Maybe Im just better off not knowing who knew  
  
But itll be all right tonight  
Im gonna be all right tonight  
Are we doin all right in old LA tonight  
  
Those summer nights when I look in your eyes  
Im falling to pieces pieces out of my mind  
And Ill never know why  
Im falling to pieces pieces  
  
Who could you imagine such a thing could happen to you  
Its gonna be all right in old LA  
  
Those summer nights when I look in your eyes  
Im falling to pieces pieces out of my mind  
And Ill never know why  
Im falling to pieces pieces  
  
Its gonna be all right in old LA tonight
