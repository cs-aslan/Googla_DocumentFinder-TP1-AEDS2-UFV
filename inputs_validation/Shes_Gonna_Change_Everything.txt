Theres a light shining on her window  
Theres a great big guess breathing on her door  
Shame its taken all this time  
All these years to find out  
Shes gonna change everything  
  
I spend so much time sitting in shadows  
I feel naked to the bone but I dont care any more  
Shame its taken all this time  
All these years to find out  
Shes gonna change everything  
  
Oh everybody cant you see  
What that angels done to me  
Im hopelessly in bits  
Hanging on to what I think I used to be  
Somebody help me please  
See this fool way down on his knees  
Shes gonna change everything you see in me  
Shes gonna change everything
