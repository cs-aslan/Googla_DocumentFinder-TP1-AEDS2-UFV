Keep holding on  
When my brains tickin like a bomb  
Guess the black thoughts have come again to get me  
Sweet bitter words  
Unlike nothing I have heard  
Sing along Mocking bird  
You dont affect me  
  
Thats right  
Deliver it to my heart  
Please strike  
Be deliberate  
  
Wait  
Im coming undone  
Irate  
Im coming undone  
Too late  
Im coming undone  
What looks so strong so delicate  
  
Wait  
Im starting to suffocate  
And soon I anticipate  
Im coming undone  
What looks so strong so delicate  
  
Choke choke again  
I thought my demons were my friends  
Pity me in the end  
Theyre out to get me  
Since I was young  
I tasted sorrow on my tongue  
And this sweet chocolate gun does not protect me  
  
Thats right  
Trigger between my eyes  
Please strike  
Make it quick now  
  
Wait  
Im coming undone  
Im irate  
Im coming undone  
Too late  
Im coming undone  
What looks so strong so delicate  
  
Wait  
Im starting to suffocate  
And soon I anticipate  
Im coming undone  
What looks so strong so delicate  
  
Im trying to hold it together  
Head is lighter than a feather  
Looks like Im not getting better  
Not getting better  
  
Wait  
Im coming undone irate  
Im coming undone too late  
Im coming undone  
Wait  
Im starting to suffocate  
And soon I anticipate
