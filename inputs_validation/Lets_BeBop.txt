Suddenly it happened  
Here we are with all this glory  
We never thought for a minute  
That we were writin a story  
We took our chances  
Somehow we held it together  
And now I feel there is justice  
I always new there was  
  
I love the warmth of the spotlight  
I need the sound of the people screamin  
Here we are to bring down the ceiling  
Want to give you a real good feelin  
Later on when its over  
We will think of you and remember  
Youre the ones who gave us the glory  
Just want to tell you that  
  
Chorus  
Its great to to be with you  
Been a long time but we love you  
Dont stop lets bebop tonight  
  
Do you remember the last time  
We remember the last time  
Everything was cool  
We had a celebration yeah  
We had a celebration  
Lets bring the feeling back again  
Come on closer  
Just got to tell ya that
