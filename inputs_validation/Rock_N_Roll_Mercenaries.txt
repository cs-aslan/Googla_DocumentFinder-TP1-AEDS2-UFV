Talking talking wealth talking money talking power  
Talking horses talking fun talking self talking power  
Talking diamonds talking ego talking man talking wealth  
And talking power  
And talking power  
  
Money is power power is fame  
  
Chorus  
Talking about rock n roll mercenaries  
Soldiers of fortune by some other name  
Im talking about rock n roll mercenaries  
Money is power n power is fame  
  
Everything you pay to hear just listen  
Everything to catch your ear just listen  
Whatever it takes theyre ready to sell  
Anything and everything they do it themselves  
  
Chorus  
  
Young are the victims so easily swayed slain  
As some given are poisoned all continuous placed  
Our conscience is a load so heavy to carry for a rock n roll mercenary  
  
Chorus  
  
It starts with a game see how they play  
Till all of the laughter is faded away  
Its not for the song its not for the love  
Its just for the gold and theres never enough never enough  
  
Chorus  
  
Its not for the song its not for the love  
Its just for the gold theres never enough  
  
Chorus

Rock n roll mercenaries ooh talkin about
