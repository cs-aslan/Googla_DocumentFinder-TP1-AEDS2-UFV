Takes a step back  
From the vacant chair  
Looking in the mirror  
While shes combing her hair  
Wipes the dust from a cup  
While shes cleaning up  
Wonders very slightly  
What shes doing there  
A simple reflection  
Can be too revealing  
Years are for counting  
Years are for stealing  
Shes a mathematician  
Calculator  
Counting daily  
Counting forever  
Cold clean glass and a razor blade  
Fly on the table and a passing car  
Closes the curtain to keep in the shade  
Closes her head and now shes counting down  
Dust is collecting  
But she doesnt notice  
Counting for ever  
Shes a calculator  
Noone can see her  
Shes invisible now  
Noone can see her  
And the dust is collecting
