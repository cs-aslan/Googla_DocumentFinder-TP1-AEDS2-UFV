Verse 1  
I Remember way back when  
Lookin for the right girl to be my friend  
I searched and searched but still never came up  
On the right one who would be mine and the only one  
Luck never came my way  
And all I ever came up with is a broken heart ya see  
I couldnt stand to be alone why my boys  
Straight kick it with the betties while I sat by the telephone  
Everytime I hear it rang it wasnt who I want it to be  
It was just the same ol thing Another day another heartache  
No pain no gain just Lookin for a good thing  
Momma use to say dont look for love  
Just let it come around and surely one day itll be found  
Ya see Im kinda like 2 Pac When I get around  
But the ICE goes down  
I go down I go down I go down baby I go down  
I go down I go down baby doll I go down  
Verse 2  
Step up if ya think ya out there  
I know its gotta be a tender  
Wholl remember Ice somewhere  
Thats only if youre ready for a real one  
I need a tender and yeah I gotta feel one  
I want to tease and please  
And do it all with ease  
But ya gotta be right and all that  
There when I need ya perfect like Kodak  
Picture perfect body like an hour glass figure  
Cool in tha head and I gotta dig her  
The type that never says no  
Cause shes down to the fullest Cool like the wind blows  
And I aint trying to search and find  
I guess its true when they say that love is blind  
You see Im kinda like 2 Pac When I get around  
But the ICE goes down  
Verse 3  
Now Im on tour and got the past behind me  
But I need something to remind me  
Of the days when I played the kissing game  
But now things changed and no I aint the same  
I made a come up and now they run up  
They all scream Im the one That wants to give the love up  
But ICE aint got no time for games  
I need a real love Like Mary J Blige know what Im sayin  
But the odds are still against me Im making paper  
And still need that one That wants to be with me  
And not for the money Nor the fame But for me  
One who can give me that security  
So if youre out there this ones for you  
Youll be down with me then maybe Ill be true  
You see Im kinda like 2 Pac When I get around  
But the ICE goes down
