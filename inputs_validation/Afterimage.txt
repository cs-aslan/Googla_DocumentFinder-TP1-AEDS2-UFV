Suddenly you were gone  
From all the lives you left your mark upon  
  
I remember  
How we talked and drank into the misty dawn  
I hear the voices  
  
We ran by the water on the wet summer lawn  
I see the footprints  
I remember  
  
I feel the way you would  
I feel the way you would  
  
Tried to believe but you know its no good  
This is something that just cant be understood  
  
I remember  
The shouts of joy skiing fast through the woods  
I hear the echoes  
  
I learned your love for life  
I feel the way that you would  
I feel your presence  
I remember  
  
I feel the way you would  
This just cant be understood
