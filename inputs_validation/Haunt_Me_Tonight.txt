I hear the chimes playing the evening breeze  
Bringing the night along its way  
Just like the tide swaying the endless sea  
It keeps you forever from the day  
  
Chorus  
Haunt me tonight  
Float to me on your illusion  
Show me a sign to let me know  
Haunt me tonight  
Let me see your silent vision  
Thats all of your light I have to hold  
  
I cant explain cant even understand  
How what we had has come to this  
When loves sweet refrain is played with a ghostly hand  
And I am so helpless to resist  
  
Chorus  
Haunt me tonight  
Float to me on your illusion  
Show me a sign to let me know  
Yeah yeah  
Haunt me tonight  
Let me see your silent vision  
Thats all of your light I have to hold  
  
guitar interlude  
  
I feel you near waiting beyond the shore  
Dont leave me longing anymore ooh   
  
Repeat chorus
