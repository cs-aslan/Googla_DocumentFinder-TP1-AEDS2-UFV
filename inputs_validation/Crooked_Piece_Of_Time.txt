Things got rough  
Things got tough  
Things got harder than hard  
We were just trying to make a livin  
In our back yard  
We were born too late died to soon  
Anxietys a terrible crime  
If you dont come now dont come at all  
cause its a crooked piece of time  
Its a crooked piece of time that we live in  
A crooked piece of time  
All in all and all in all  
Its a crooked piece of time  
Yesterday morning an ill wind came  
Blew your picture  
Right out of the picture frame  
Even blew the candle out  
From underneath the flame  
Yesterday morning an ill wind came
