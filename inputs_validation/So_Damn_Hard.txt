I woke up this morning  
Knowing it had to end  
That useless calling  
Dont you know it drives me round the bend  
  
If honesty speaks truth  
Ive said to many lies  
Im tied up just let me loose  
I just cant decide  
  
cause i wanted someone to come along  
And make me feel too damn good  
But baby youre average and Ive had to much of that kind  
And I dont think I should  
And I just wish  
  
CHORUS  
You would  
Not be  
So good  
To me  
Then I  
Wouldnt  
Guess I  
Shouldnt  
And then  
Breaking us apart  
Wouldnt be so hard  
  
Stop making  
Doing  
This  
So damn  
Hard
