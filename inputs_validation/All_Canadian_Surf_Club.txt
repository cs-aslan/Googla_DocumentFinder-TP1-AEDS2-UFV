Well theres a rockin little spot  
Next to the Regent Theater  
And if you wanna make the scene  
Youll make it sooner or later  
Youre really hanging with the crowd  
You know the ins and the outs here  
All Canadian Surf Club  
Denim jackets and long hair  
Well were rocking to the beach  
Watch the waves as they roll there  
I meant I really dig you baby  
Make me wild with your blonde hair  
Yeah when youre dancin next to me  
I want to roll and die there  
Ill be designing my buggy  
While Im thinking about next year  
Walk across the sand  
With another friend  
My love depends  
When summer ends  
You really abuse and use the beach  
Theres lot of things that you need there  
I got my guitar Cadillac  
Some chick and twentyfour cold beers  
Yeah when youre dancin next to me  
I want to roll and die there  
All Canadian Surf Club  
Denim jackets and long hair  
Walk across the sand  
With another friend  
My heart depends  
When summer ends  
Denim jackets and long hair  
I want to roll and die there  
Make me wild with your blonde hair  
Yeah
