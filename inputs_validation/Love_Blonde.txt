Somethings coming down the street  
Something static under your feet  
Never looking left or right  
coz shell just blow you out of sight  
  
Shes never waiting on your smile  
Devastating whats in her style   
Situation nogo zone  
But shell cut loose when shes alone  
  
Chorus  
Shes a love Blonde  
Shes a love Blonde  
Shes a love Blonde  
Shes got that sensuality for love  
  
When the boys say how you been  
What you doin Can we get in   
Eyesll flash and lips will smile  
And shell just tease them for a while  
  
coz now you see her now you dont  
You could be there only you wont  
If youve got that Savoir Faire  
Well that girl knows and shes aware  
  
Chorus  
  
Oooh well if she fills your dreams tonight  
Oooh just lay back and hold on tight  
  
Chorus
