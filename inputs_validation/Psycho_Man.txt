The midnight hour approaches  
The killing chill takes over him  
His victims will not know  
When he appears  
  
The lust of deaths possession  
Will over take his psycho mind  
He wont be happy  
Till he smells the fear  
  
Hes the angel of death  
Psycho man psycho man  
Angel of death  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
Hes the angel of death  
Psycho man psycho man  
Angel of death  
Hes the killer  
  
Addicted to the madness  
The taste of death that lives within  
He loves it when he  
Tastes their final breath  
  
Stalking gives him pleasure  
Killing is the final act  
He takes no pity  
With his lust for death  
  
Hes the angel of death  
Psycho man psycho man  
Angel of death  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
Hes the angel of death  
Psycho man psycho man  
Angel of death  
Hes the killer  
  
Playing in his twilight zone  
He knows that hes the best  
Tripping through the streets alone  
Till he finds his victim next  
  
Killing gives him pleasure  
Sleeping gives him pain  
The only time hes feeling good  
Is when hes killed and killed again  
  
When hes killed again  
When hes killed again  
When hes killed again  
When hes killed again  
  
When hes killed again  
When hes killed again  
Watch out  
  
Hes the angel of death angel of death  
Hes the angel of death angel of death  
  
Hes the angel of death  
Psycho man psycho man  
Angel of death  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
Hes the angel of death  
Psycho man psycho man  
Angel of death  
Hes the killer  
  
Hes the angel of death  
Psycho man psycho man  
Angel of death  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
Hes the angel of death  
Psycho man psycho man  
Angel of death  
Hes the killer

Looking for a victim wherever he can
