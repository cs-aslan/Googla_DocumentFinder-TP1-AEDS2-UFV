Daddy doesnt think  
That youll be good enough for me  
Mama says be careful  
Cause hell break your heart in three  
They dont walk in my shoes  
They aint been kissed by you  
  
LEIGHANNE  
My sister says  
She doesnt like the way you wear your hair  
But I know that shes jealous  
So why would I even care  
I have to lie about how good you make me feel  
  
PERRIE  
So tell me tell me you wont break my heart  
You wont tear my world apart  
That youll be there when I need  
Cause I wanna tell them  
  
ALL  
They just dont know you  
They just dont know you  
They just dont know you they dont know you like I do  
They just dont know you they dont know  
They just dont know you they dont know  
They just dont know you like I do  
  
JESY  
Talk is cheap and rumours spread  
But they go with the wind  
Its not about she said he said  
Cause I know where it ends  
I know the real truth  
And the real truth is you  
  
JADE  
Its funny cause at times  
It feels like us against the world  
They treat you like a criminal  
But Ill still be your girl  
Id rather die with you  
Walk the line if you asked me to  
  
PERRIE  
So tell me tell me you wont break my heart  
You wont tear my world apart  
That youll be there when I need  
Cause I wanna tell them  
  
ALL  
They just dont know you  
They just dont know you  
They just dont know you they dont know you like I do  
They just dont know you they dont know  
They just dont know you they dont know  
They just dont know you like I do  
  
JESY  
LLLike I do they just dont know you  
  
ALL  
You dont know about our love  
You choose what you see  
But if you felt the way we love  
Youd just let it be  
They dont know about the times  
When its just him and me  
Cause if you felt the way we love  
Youd just let it be  
  
Tell me tell me you wont break my heart  
You wont tear my world apart  
That youll be there when I need  
Cause I wanna tell them  
  
They just dont know you  
They just dont know you  
They just dont know you they dont know you like I do  
They just dont know you they dont know  
They just dont know you they dont know  
They just dont know you like I do
