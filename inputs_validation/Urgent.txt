Youre not shy you get around  
You want to fly dont want your feet on the ground  
You stay up you wont come down  
You want to live you want to move to the sound  
Got fire in your veins burning hot but you dont feel the pain  
Your desire is insane you cant stop until you do it again  
  
But sometimes I wonder as I look in your eyes  
Maybe youre thinking of some other guy  
But I know yes I know how to treat you right  
Thats why you call me in the middle of the night you say  
  
Its urgent so urgent so urgent just wait and see  
How urgent my love can be its urgent  
  
You play tricks on my mind youre everywhere but youre so hard to find  
Youre not warm youre sentimental  
Youre so extreme you can be so temperamental  
  
But Im not looking for a love thatll last  
I know what I need and I need it fast  
Yeah theres one thing in common that we both share  
Thats our need for each other anytime anywhere  
  
It gets urgent so urgent you know its urgent  
I want to tell you its the same for me  
So urgent just wait and see how urgent my love can be its urgent  
  
You say its urgent make it fast make it urgent  
Do it quick do it urgent gotta run make it urgent  
Wait it quick want it urgent urgent emergency urgent urgent emergency  
Urgent urgent emergency urgent urgent emergency  
So urgent emergency
