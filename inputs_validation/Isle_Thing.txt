Met this fine young thing  
At the local Circle K  
We made a date for a half past eight  
And I said What the hey  
  
So I journeyed to her crib  
And I let myself inside  
That chick was slouched down on the couch  
I think her brain was fried  
  
Couldnt figure it out  
She wouldnt even look at me  
Then I saw her eyes she was hypnotized  
Cold glued to her TV  
  
Hey whats your problem baby doll  
Lets have a little fling  
She said Hey you fool now just be cool  
Im watchin that Gilligans Isle thing  
  
Isle thing  
Isle thing isle thing isle thing  
  
Watchin all night  
Musta been a marathon  
I was bummin those shows kept comin  
Heres what was goin on  
  
These castaways were stranded  
On this island out at sea  
One of them called Gilligan  
So lets name him after m  
  
Hed mess up every rescue  
Man that first mate was illin  
If I was one of those castaways  
I think Id probably kill Im  
  
Just about that time  
Telephone began to ring  
She said Just let it my machinell get  
Were watchin the Gilligans Isle thing  
  
Isle thing  
She loves that Gilligans Isle thing  
Isle thing isle thing isle thing  
Please baby baby please  
  
I like the professor  
He always saves their butts  
He could build a nuclear reactor  
From a couple of coconuts  
  
She said That guys a genius  
I shook my head and laughed  
I said If hes so fly they tell me why  
He couldnt build a lousy raft  
  
And while were on the subject  
Ill tell you one thing for sure  
Those homeboys brought an awful lot  
For just a three hour tour  
  
Then her mom came in the room  
It was kind of embarrassing  
She said Hey you two I was once like you  
And I loved that Gilligans Isle thing  
  
Isle thing  
Shed watch that Gilligans Isle thing  
Please baby baby please  
  
Skippers in a hammock  
Hes looking kinda fat  
Hed throw a fit and then hed hit  
Old Gilligan with his hat  
  
Mrs Hal had it goin on  
But Mr Hal was meaner  
Ginger and Mary Anne couldve used  
Some funky cold medina   
  
I was really diggin this show  
I didnt know what to do  
It kinda looked like I was hooked  
Now Im an addict too  
  
I know each episode by heart  
Now Im the rerun king  
And on every date we both stay up late  
And we watch the Gilligans Isle thing  
  
Isle thing  
Hasta la vista little buddy  
Gilligans Isle thing isle thing isle thing
