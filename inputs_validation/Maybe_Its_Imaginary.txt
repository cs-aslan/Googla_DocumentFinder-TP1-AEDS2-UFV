Maybe its imaginary Id like to know  
Whats the world coming to and where will it go  
The hole in the sky where the sunshine gets in  
It dries up the land as it mucks up your skin  
And I dont know why who will reveal  
Maybe its imaginary maybe its real  
We wash all the food and we peel off the skin  
But what is the point if its poisoned within  
Now I dont know why we say ok  
Maybe its imaginary hope its not too late  
And when in the summer we go to the sea  
The things floating by arent what we want to see  
And Id change it all if I had one wish  
Id never go swimming with those nuclear fish  
Maybe those imaginary rivers run dry  
But if its true then Id like to know why  
I dont know much but Id like to know why
