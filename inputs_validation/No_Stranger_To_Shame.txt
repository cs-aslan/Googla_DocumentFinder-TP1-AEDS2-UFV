Chorus  
Im no stranger to shame  
Ive got little to blame  
You sent for me and so I came  
Ill come runnin when you call my name  
cause Im no stranger Im no stranger to shame  
I said Im no stranger Im no stranger to shame  
  
I might stagger and I might sway  
I might stutter just a bit but thats OK  
Im not walkin too good thats true  
I got a broke ass limp thatll pull me though  
I might appear to be a pile of rags  
But Im a stack of hundreds in a paper bag  
Ive been around this world and back  
I made a million bucks and put it all on black  
  
So if you see me stumble you dont have to look away  
Its not the first time not the last  
You can leave me where I lay because  
So if you see me stumble you dont have to look away  
Its not the first time not the last  
You can leave me where I lay because  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive been known to wake up in some dirty places  
The sun only shines on deserving faces  
The mind erases forgets the stars  
See each and every city has corner bar  
Thats where I am in a world so grim  
The lights are as bright as the day is dim  
See Im priceless in a class of my own  
I used to stay out late but now I dont go home  
So if you see me stumble you dont have to look away  
  
Its not the first time not the last  
You can leave me where I lay because  
How do you feel when the birds are chirpin  
When your in bed and everybody is workin  
Are you down with the non believers  
Make the slackers look like over achievers  
The dogs scratchin on the door again  
The cats out but he dont want to come in  
You got a bed and you got a floor  
But the couch is closer to your front door  
So if you see me stumble you dont have to look away  
Its not the first time not the last  
You can leave me where I lay because  
  
Chorus
