Down down you bring me down  
I hear you knocking down my  
Door and I cant sleep at night  
Your face it has no place  
No room for you inside my  
House I need to be alone  
  
Dont waste your words I dont need  
Anything from you  
I dont care where youve been or  
What you plan to do  
  
Turn turn I wish youd learn  
Theres a time and place for everything  
Ive got to get it through  
Cut loose cause youre no use  
I couldnt stand another  
Second in your company  
  
Dont waste your words I dont need  
Anything from you  
I dont care where youve been or  
What you plan to do  
  
Stone me why cant you see  
Youre a no one nowhere washed up baby  
Whod look better dead  
Your tongue is far too long  
I dont like the way it sucks and  
Slurs upon my every word  
  
Dont waste your words I dont need  
Anything from you  
I dont care where youve been or  
What you plan to do  
  
I am the resurrection and I am the life  
I couldnt ever bring myself  
To hate you as Id  
Like  
  
I am the resurrection and I am the life  
I couldnt ever bring myself  
To hate you as Id  
Like
