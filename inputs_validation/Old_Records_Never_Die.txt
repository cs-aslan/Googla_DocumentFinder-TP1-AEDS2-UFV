Sometimes you realize  
That there is an end to life  
Yesterday I heard them say  
A heros blown away  
And its so hard to lose  
Someone whos close to you  
Oh me I did not see  
The danger every day  
But musics something in the air  
So he can play it anywhere  
Old records never die  
  
Get youre healing from a song  
Just when everything goes wrong  
Play it right  
Through the night  
Till morning brings you light  
And if some folk laugh at you  
Let em all laugh they never knew  
Oh all those scenes to me it seems  
Some folk never dream  
 I feel a force  
Rebel with some other cause  
Old records never die  
  
Old records never die  
You can watch the waves roll by  
You can see it in their eyes  
Old records never die  
Old records never die  
You can watch the waves roll by  
  
Old records never die  
I can hear you  
And I know why  
Old records never die
