Hello little girl I got a little talk for you  
About something you led me to believe youd do  
But I know now you had no intentions to  
It has come to me that we been together too long  
I been holding out I believe Ill be gone  
Cause I dont have to hang around while you do me wrong  
Your hearts full of rock and you reel like a rolling stone  
You dont really need me youd do better on your own  
So go find somebody else and leave me alone  
Im leaving you now although I love you still  
I loved you then and I guess I always will  
So goodbye little girl Im gone this time for real  
Your hearts full of rock and you reel like a rolling stone  
You dont really need me youd do better on your own  
So go find somebody else and leave me alone  
Honey Im leaving you although I love you still  
You I loved you then and I guess I always will  
So goodbye little girl Im gone this time for real  
Bye bye little girl bye bye little girl  
Bye bye little girl bye bye little girl  
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye little girl
