Strung out on the east side of town  
Weighing up my latest pleasure  
In two days time Ill be given a sign  
That puts me in a place I get high  
  
Meanwhile theres no reply its a one conversation  
In two days time Ill be given a sign  
That puts me with the stars in the sky  
And with the sun in my eyes  
You know that I cant see  
Just like the stars in the sky  
You know Ill be  
  
Counting down the headlights  
Brings me down to earth  
2 days after midnite baby  
Ill be there  
  
Strung out on the edge of the east side of town  
Weighing up my latest pleasure  
In two days time Ill leave it behind  
And put it in a place I can find  
  
Meantime Im drawing the line its a no win situation  
In two days time Ill get the sign  
Scaring myself outa my mind  
And with the sun in my eyes  
You know that I cant see  
Just like the stars in the sky  
You know Ill be there  
  
Counting down the headlights  
Brings me down to earth  
2 days after midnight baby  
Ill be there  
  
If I disappear that would make it clear  
Strung out on the edge on the east side of town  
Weighing up my latest measure  
Freaking out on this sensation  
Guarantees my destination  
  
And with the sun in my eyes  
You know that I cant see  
Just like the stars in the sky  
You know Ill be there  
  
Counting down repeat to fade
