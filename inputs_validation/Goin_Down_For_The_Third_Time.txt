Save me save me save me  
Save me save me save me  
  
Im going down down for the third time  
Im going down down for the third time  
Drowning in tears from my heart thats hurting  
Drowning in tears from a love thats uncertain  
  
Im lost in a world without love a sea of emptiness  
The love we knew is being washed away  
Dont think I can last my heart is sinking fast  
  
Im going down down for the third time  
Trying to hold on to a love thats mine  
Drowning in the love that keeps me grieving  
Drowning in the fear that my arms youre leaving  
  
Bring back that love we knew  
Darling let me live again  
A little tenderness to me start showing  
Fill my heart with love till its overflowing  
  
Im going down down for the third time  
Trying to hold on to a love thats gone  
Im going down down for the third time  
So wont you save this heart of mine  
  
Going down down for the third time  
Going down down for the third time  
Im like a ship all alone on a raging sea  
You got me tossing and a turning  
And I cant get free  
  
Reach out your hand for me  
Darling save whats left of our love  
Ill forgive your lies and alibis  
If youll wipe my crying eyes  
  
Im going down down for the third time  
So wont you save this heart of mine  
Ive loved too long I love too strong  
Now little boy you know youre doing me wrong  
  
Come on and save me  
Come on and save me  
Come on and save me  
Im going down down for the third time
