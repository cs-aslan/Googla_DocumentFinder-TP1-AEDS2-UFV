Spin spin spin  
Spin around spin around  
  
The harlequin dances in a costume of green  
Spin around  
But under his makeup his age cant be seen  
Spin around  
But where are you spinnin  
When will you know  
That life is for livin  
That it isnt a show  
  
Spin spin spin  
Spin around spin around  
  
You look out on the city from your penthouse so high  
Spin around  
But your pedestals your prison and so is your high  
Spin around  
But where are you spinnin  
When will you know  
That life is for livin  
That it isnt a show  
  
Spin spin spin  
Spin around spin around  
  
Your pills are you conscience  
They make evrything seem all right  
Spin around  
Take a white one go to sleep  
Take a red one to stay up all night  
To spin around  
But where are you spinnin  
When will you know  
That life is for livin  
That it isnt a show  
Spin spin spin  
Spin around spin around  
Spin spin spin  
Spin away spin away  
Spin spin spin  
Spin around spin around
