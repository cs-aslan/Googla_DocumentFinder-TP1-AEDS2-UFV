Look into the others eyes many frustrations  
Read between the lines no words just vibrations  
Dont ignore hidden desires  
Pay attention youre playing with fire  
  
Silence must be heard noise should be observed  
The time has come to learn that silence  
Silence must be heard  
Or diamonds will burn friendly cards will turn  
Cause silence has the right to be heard  
  
People talk too much for what they have to say  
Words without a meaning just fading away  
  
Silence must be heard noise should be observed  
The time has come to learn that silence  
Silence must be heard  
Or diamonds will burn friendly cards will turn  
Cause silence has the right to be heard
