We go out to a party somewhere  
The moment we walk in the door  
People stop and everybody stares  
She dont know what theyre staring for  
  
She dont know shes beautiful  
never crossed her mind  
She dont know shes beautiful  
no shes not that kind  
She dont know shes beautiful  
Though time and time Ive told her so  
  
There she goes just walking down the street  
And someone lets a whistle out  
A girl like her she just cant see  
What the fuss is all about  
  
And she dont know shes beautiful  
never crossed her mind  
She dont know shes beautiful  
no shes not that kind  
She dont know shes beautiful  
Though time and time Ive told her so  
  
Mornin comes and her hairs all a mess  
Thats when she thinks she looks her worst  
Its times like this she dont know why  
I cant take my eyes off her  
  
And she dont know shes beautiful  
never crossed her mind  
She dont know shes beautiful  
no shes not that kind  
She dont know shes beautiful  
Though time and time Ive told her  
  
She dont know shes beautiful  
never crossed her mind  
She dont know shes beautiful  
no shes not that kind  
She dont know shes beautiful  
Though time and time Ive told her  
  
She dont know shes beautiful  
never crossed her mind  
She dont know shes beautiful  
no shes not that kind  
She dont know shes beautiful  
Though time and time Ive told her
