Johnny was bad even as a child everybody could tell  
Everyone said If you dont get straight  
Youll surely go to hell  
  
But Johnny didnt care  
He was an outlaw by the time that he was ten years old  
He didnt want to do what he was told  
Just a prankster juvenile gangster  
  
His teachers didnt understand  
They kicked him out of school at a tender early age  
Just because he didnt want to learn things  
He had other interests  
He liked to burn things  
  
The lady down the block  
She had a radio that Johnny wanted oh so bad  
So he took it the first chance he had  
Then he shot her in the leg  
And this is what she said  
Only a lad You really cant blame him  
Only a lad Society made him  
Only a lad Hes our responsibility  
Oh oh oohh oh oh oh  
Only a lad He really couldnt help it  
Only a lad He didnt want to do it  
Only a lad Hes underprivileged and abused  
Perhaps a little bit confused  
  
Oh oh ohhh oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa  
Oh oh ohhh oohhh oh oh ohh whoa whoa whoa  
  
His parents gave up they couldnt influence his attitude  
Nobody could help  
The little man had no gratitude  
  
And when he stole the car  
Nobody dreamed that he would try to take it so far  
He didnt mean to hit the poor man  
Who had to go and die  
It made the judge cry  
  
Only a lad He really couldnt help it  
Only a lad He didnt want to do it  
Only a lad Hes underprivileged and abused  
Perhaps a little bit confused  
Oh oh oh ohh ohh ohh  
  
Its not his fault that he cant believe  
Its not his fault that he cant behave  
Society made him go astray  
  
Perhaps if were nice hell go away  
Perhaps hell go away  
Hell go away  
  
Only a lad You really cant blame him  
Only a lad Society made him  
Only a lad Hes our responsibility  
  
Hey there Johnny you really dont fool me  
You get away with murder  
And you think its funny  
You dont give a damn if we live or if we die  
Oh oh oh ohh ohh ohh oh oh  
Hey there Johnny boy  
I hope you fry  
  
Oh oh oh ohh ohh ohh oh oh  
Oh oh oh ohh ohh ohh oh oh
