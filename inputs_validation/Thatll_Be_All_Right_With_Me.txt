Its not my sun man and if its not shinin  
When I wake up tomorrow morning hmm thatll be all right with me  
Theyre not my birds man and if theyre not singin  
When I wake up tomorrow morning hmm thatll be all right with me  
I dont believe Im where Im goin I find many a mile  
If you dont like me help me to change Im still looking for a style  
Shes just a woman if she should be gone  
When I wake up tomorrow morning hmm thatll be all right with me  
Well Im not a brave man but Im not a slave man  
If all I ever am is free thatll be all right with me  
I dont believe Im where Im goin I find many a mile  
If you dont like me help me to change Im still looking for a style
