Sunday afternoon theres something special  
Its just like another world  
Jogging in the park is my excuse  
To look at all the little girls  
  
Im not a flasher in a rain coat  
Im not a dirty old man  
Im not gonna snatch you from your mother  
Im an art lover  
Come to daddy  
Ah come to daddy  
Come to daddy  
  
Pretty little legs I want to draw them  
Like a Degas ballerina  
Pure white skin like porcelain  
Shes a work of art and I should know  
Im an art lover  
Come to daddy  
And Ill give you some spangles  
  
Little girl dont notice me  
Watching as she innocently plays  
She cant see me staring at her  
Because Im always wearing shades  
She feeds the ducks looks at the flowers  
I follow her around for hours and hours  
Id take her home but that could never be  
Shes just a substitute  
For whats been taken from me  
Ah come to daddy come on  
  
Sunday afternoon cant last forever  
Wish I could take you home  
So come on give us a smile  
Before you vanish out of view  
Ive learned to appreciate you  
The way art lovers do  
And I only want to look at you
