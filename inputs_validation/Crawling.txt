Crawling in my skin  
These wounds they will not heal  
Fear is how I fall  
Confusing what is real  
  
Theres something inside me that pulls beneath the surface  
Consuming confusing  
This lack of self control I fear is never ending  
Controlling  
I cant seem  
To find myself again  
My walls are closing in  
Without a sense of confidence Im convinced  
That theres just too much pressure to take  
Ive felt this way before  
So insecure  
  
Crawling in my skin  
These wounds they will not heal  
Fear is how I fall  
Confusing what is real  
  
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me  
Distracting reacting  
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection  
Its haunting how I cant seem  
  
To find myself again  
My walls are closing in  
Without a sense of confidence Im convinced  
That theres just too much pressure to take  
Ive felt this way before  
So insecure  
  
Crawling in my skin  
These wounds they will not heal  
Fear is how I fall  
Confusing what is real  
  
Crawling in my skin  
These wounds they will not heal  
Fear is how I fall  
Confusing confusing what is real  
  
Theres something inside me that pulls beneath the surface  
Consuming confusing what is real  
This lack of self control I fear is never ending  
Controlling confusing what is real
