Shes a little bit of the sunshine  
Just before the rain  
A little like this quiet night  
Before the cold winds came  
Shes a little bit like the weather  
I never know when shes gonna change  
Shes a part of my heart  
And a whole lot of my pain  
  
Chorus  
Whiskey whiskey my old friend  
Ive come to talk with you again  
Milk of mercy please be kind  
Drive this feeling from my mind  
  
Dont you know somehow her smile  
Can make the day begin  
Shed take away this mask of grey  
And let the sun shine in  
Now I find Ive been blinded  
By the cold and wintery wind  
She disguised behind her eyes  
Oh what a fool Ive been  
  
Chorus x 2
