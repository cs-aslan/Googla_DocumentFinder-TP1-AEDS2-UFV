They think that Ive got the bread  
They want to read my head  
The position show his cool  
Like football star in school  
  
Someone to sell me  
Someone to tell me  
Im a dead rock star  
In a dead rock car  
Im a dead rock star  
  
Im so afraid of failing  
I hang onto the railing  
This cold hard graduation  
Kills all infatuation  
I took the hazing  
They said amazing  
Im a dead rock star  
In a dead rock car  
Im a dead rock star  
  
I gathered awful knowledge  
You cannot get in college  
Would you like Cain or Abel  
Ill bring them to the table  
  
They try to rope me  
They try to grope me  
Im a dead rock star  
In a dead rock car  
Im a dead rock star  
What can I hope for  
What can I hope for  
Nothing to live for  
Nothing to live for  
Im a dead rock star  
In a dead rock car  
Im a dead rock star
