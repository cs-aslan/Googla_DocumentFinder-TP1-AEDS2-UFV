Well I dont know why I came here tonight  
I got the feeling something aint right  
Im so scared in case I fall off my chair  
And Im wondering if Ill get down the stairs  
Yeah clowns to the left of me jokers to the right  
Here I am stuck in the middle with you  
Stuck in the middle with you  
Well Im stuck in the middle with you  
And Im wondering what is I should do  
Its so hard to wipe this smile from my face  
Lose control and Im all over the place  
Yeah clowns to the left of me jokers to the right  
Here I am stuck in the middle with you  
Well you started out with nothing  
And youre proud youre a selfmade man  
And your friends they all come crawling  
Slap you on the back and say Please oh please  
Oh no  
Clowns to the left of me jokers to the right  
Here I am  
Well you started out with nothing  
And youre proud youre a selfmade man  
And your friends they all come crawling  
Slap you on the back and say Please oh please  
Well I dont know why I came here tonight  
I got the feeling something aint right  
Im so scared in case I fall off my chair  
And Im wondering if Ill get down get get down the stairs  
Clowns to the left of me jokers to the right  
Here I am stuck in the middle with you  
Yes Im stuck in the middle with you  
Stuck in the middle with you  
Here I am well here I am stuck in the middle with you
