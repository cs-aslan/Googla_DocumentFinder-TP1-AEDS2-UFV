Oh I hear familiar sounds down the sidewalk  
Gettin closer with every step he takes  
Lord Im so afraid that if I look out the window  
Ill be tempted to repeat an old mistake  
  
Chorus  
Dont open that door  
To an old memory  
When he said goodbye  
I locked it up tight  
And threw out the key  
Ive stood here before  
Lord I cant stand no more  
Wont go there again  
Heart dont let him in  
Dont open that door  
  
The stronger me has found the will to fight it  
But now hes gone and the weaker sides in tears  
Lord it took so long to put the hurt behind me  
If I dont look back the past cant find me here  
  
Chorus  
  
Wont go there again  
Heart dont let him in  
Dont you open that door
