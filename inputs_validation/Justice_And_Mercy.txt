Youve put a new song in my mouth  
It is a hymn of praise to You  
Justice and mercy are its theme  
And I will live it back to You  
  
The kind of fast Youve chosen Lord It must reach out  
To broken lives and to the poor So change me Lord  
  
I know You are the orphans hope  
I know You are the widows song  
O Lord Youre showing me whats on Youre heart  
  
Lord I wont bring an empty song Its meaningless  
Without compassion in my life And holiness  
  
Youre Father were no father lives  
And to the lonely Youre a friend  
O Lord Youre showing me whats on Youre heart  
  
I know You are the orphans hope  
I know You are the widows song  
Youre Father were no father lives  
And to the lonely Youre a friend  
O Lord Youre showing me whats on Youre heart
