The first time I met you  
I thought that my life was complete  
But then I realized in the end  
You were nothin but a cheat  
  
Bridge  
You took my heart  
And broke it  
I took it back  
And sewed it  
  
Chorus  
Cause I am more than you are  
You showed me life  
And I shoved it back in ur fucking face  
I hate the way that you live ur life  
But oh well Im not apart of it anymore  
  
Maybe if you wouldnt have done this  
Wed still be complete  
But who cares I do  
Cause I am better off now  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Guitar Solo  
  
The first time I met you  
I thought that my life was complete  
But who cares I do  
Cause I am better off now  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus 2x  
 Cause Im not apart  
Im not apart  
Im not apart of it anymore
