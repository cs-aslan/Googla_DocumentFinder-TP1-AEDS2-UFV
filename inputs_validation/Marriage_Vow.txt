Do you take this woman to be your dear wife  
Do you vow to love her the rest of your life  
And will you protect her and honor her name  
Oh dont cause her heartaches and dont bring her shame  
Share with her in poverty with her in wealth  
For richer for poorer through sickness and health  
All these things the Parson did ask me and then I whispered I do and Id do it
again  
  
For I really love her the one I call wife and Ill go on caring the rest of my
life  
Id die to protect her and shed do the same  
Id cut off my tongue before Id bring her shame  
We may be in poverty may not have wealth  
But we stick together through sickness and health  
Ill always be thankful till my life is done that two little words made us
both into one
