Yeah uhhuh  
Uhhuh I cant explain it  
  
You know its that moment  
Its just that moment  
Yknahmsayin I cant explain it  
  
Chorus  
Cant explain it  
My love when were together  
Youre the greatest nobody does it better  
When you hold me  
I wish that I could be your one and only  
Nobody does it better  
  
I understand you want canaries on your hand  
Masterpiece Roley gold tricolor band  
Cute wedding pictures sittin on the nightstand  
You dont want to make it happen unless its the right man  
I know you wont touch me unless you trust me  
You kiss me and hug me but still wont crush me  
Im kissin on your neck real tender  
Gentle as can be but you still wont surrender  
Let me kiss your eyes  
Let the smell of the incense enhance the vibe  
I pull back to stare at your eyes  
Sittin there quiet like Im hypnotized  
We kiss a little more laugh and smile  
Might even share a lollipop you know my style  
Kick your Charles Davids off relax for a while  
Lets pretend that were walkin down the aisle  
I cant explain it  
  
Chorus  
  
Straight up you beautiful b  
I dont think you understand what you doin to me  
On the couch witcha legs crossed watchin TV  
Shoe hangin off the tip of your foot you killin me  
uh then we kiss for real  
Im fully prepared Im already steel  
You go to the bathroom for a second  
I understand baby I know what you checkin ahehheh  
Thats when you come back and walk to me slow  
Thats when you change up and let it all flow  
Im kissin on your belly ring nice and slow  
I love to take my time love to give you a show  
Get the warm chocolate syrup to travel below  
Use my ears like handlebars take control  
Aint no sense in stayin calm and playin the role  
Baby relax let me touch your soul  
I cant explain it  
  
Chorus  
  
My turn to get rocked lifted out my socks  
with sound effects and whatnot mmm  
A little perfume above the right spot just a touch  
Never too much I lick it like a Dutch  
Two of my favorite numbers you know what I mean  
Add em up and they equal fifteen  
You the 6 I needed you like a fix  
I can see it my mind I knew we was gon click  
I pick up the pace  
You feel the stubble from my beard on your face  
I look at your lips and take a taste  
Switch it up I got my hands on your waist  
We whylin out we all over the place  
Im holdin on with a strong embrace  
You holdin on and tryin to keep the faith  
Together we blast to outer space I cant explain it  
  
Chorus
