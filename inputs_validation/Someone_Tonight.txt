Youve got it I want it  
Surrender Dont run away  
Some say Im coldblooded  
Id say Im just not that way  
  
I need someone tonight  
Someone to hold on to me tight  
I need someone tonight  
  
If I could convince you  
If you would just say all right  
Id treat you so tender  
Then leave you and never write  
  
I need someone tonight  
Someone to hold on to me tight  
I need someone tonight
