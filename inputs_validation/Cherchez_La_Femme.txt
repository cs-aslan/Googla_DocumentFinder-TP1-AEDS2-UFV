Tommy Mottola lives on the road  
He lost his lady two months ago  
Maybe hell find her maybe he wont  
oh oh never nooo  
He sleeps in the back of his grey Cadillac oh my honey  
Blowing his mind on cheap grass and wine  
Oh aint it crazy baby hey  
Guess you could say hey hey  
This man has learned his lesson oh hey  
Now hes alone  
Hes got no woman and no home  
For misery oh oh  
Cherchez la femme  
Miggie Miggie Bonijas very upset  
Shes sick and tired of living in debt  
Tired of roaches tired of rats I know she is oooh  
So her noble man says  
Baby I understand oh my honey  
Now hes working two jobs at Eighth Avenue bars  
Oh aint crazy baby  
Now she complains  
That her man is never present no  
She goes next door I know that shes just playing the whore  
Hey for misery my friend
