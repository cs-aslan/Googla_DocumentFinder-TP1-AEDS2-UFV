He knows about you in every way  
Hes memorized every part of your face  
Inside and out baby head to toe  
Yeah he knows everything there is to know  
  
Your secret tattoo the way you change moods  
The songs that you sing when youre all alone  
Your favorite band and the way that you dance  
But baby baby  
  
Does he know you can move it like that  
Whoaohohoh  
Does he know youre out and I want you so bad  
Ohohohoh  
Tonight youre mine baby  
Does he know that youll never go back  
Ohohohoh  
Does he know  
  
I catch your eye then you turn away  
But theres no hiding the smile on your face  
Inside and out baby head to toe  
Hes not around girl you let me know  
  
Your secret tattoo the way you change moods  
The songs that you sing when youre all alone  
He knows how you dance in front of your friends  
But baby baby  
  
Does he know you can move it like that  
Whoaohohoh  
Does he know youre out and I want you so bad  
Ohohohoh  
Tonight youre mine baby  
Does he know that youll never go back  
Ohohohoh  
Does he know  
  
Hell never know  
The way you lie when you look at me  
So keep trying but you know I see  
All the little things who make you who you are  
So tell me girl  
  
Does he know you can move it like that like that  
Does he know that youll never go back go back  
  
Does he know you can move it like that  
Whoaohohoh  
Does he know youre out and I want you so bad  
Ohohohoh  
Tonight youre mine baby  
Does he know that youll never go back  
Ohohohoh  
Does he know
