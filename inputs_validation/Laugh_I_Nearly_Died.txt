Ive been traveling but I dont know where  
Ive been missing you but you just dont care  
And Ive been wandering Ive seen Greece and Rome  
Lost in the wilderness so far from home  
Yeah yeah  
  
Ive been to Africa looking for my soul  
And I feel like an actor looking for a role  
Ive been in Arabia Ive seen a million stars  
Been sipping champagne on the boulevards  yes  
  
Im so sick and tired  
Trying to turn the tide yeah  
So Ill say my goodbye  
Laugh laugh  
I nearly died  
  
Ive been down to India but it froze my bones  
Im living for the city but Im all alone  
Ive been traveling but I dont know where  
Ive been wandering but I just dont care  
  
I hate to be denied  
How you hurt my pride  
I feel pushed aside  
But laugh laugh laugh  
I nearly died  
  
Been traveling far and wide  
Wondering whos going to be my guide  
  
Living in a fantasy but its way too far  
But this kind of loneliness is way too hard  
Ive been wandering feeling all alone  
I lost my direction and I lost my home well  
  
Im so sick and tired  
Now Im on the side  
Feeling so despised  
When you laugh laugh  
I almost died  
  
Been traveling far and wide  
Wondering whos going to be my guide  
  
I hurt my pride hurt my pride hurt my pride Been traveling far and wide  
Been traveling yeah  
  
Been traveling far and wide  
Wondering whos going to be my guide  
  
Been traveling far and wide
