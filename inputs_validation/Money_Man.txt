This song goes out to all the money men  
  
He drives around in a fancy car  
Smokes those long Cuban cigars  
He dont know how to play guitar  
He cant sing but still the pretty girls think hes a star  
  
We play music got families to feed  
Aint good with numbers and he knows we cant read  
If we get a dollar you know he gets three  
It aint hard to figure out its as simple as can be  
Dont ask me ask the money man  
  
These boys are livin in a fantasy land  
I just keep em on the road so they can pay the money man  
Ill be long gone before they understand  
My promises are strong like a road made out of sand  
  
I wanna be your money man  
My mortgage is picked up by the band  
I wanna be your money man  
The boys oh theyre sleepin out in the van  
  
Dont ask me ask the money man  
You boys are livin in fantasy land  
You signed the dotted line Im takin all I can  
Your moneys lookin good in my retirement plan  
Thats just the way it is when your playin in a band  
  
Thats my money man down on his knees  
He aint prayin but he damn sure ought to be  
Hes at a place where money doesnt grow on trees  
And all his prison buddies doin more than shoot the breeze  
How does it feel no money man  
Not too good  
What did you do with my money man  
Well I a well a you know a  
How does it feel to be a honey man  
Are you sure that your still a man  
  
Aw your dressed up like a little girl  
Just shootin the breeze down on your knees  
Money man oh money man
