I feel a sudden urge to sing the kind of ditty that invokes the Spring  
So control your desire to curse while I crucify the verse  
This verse Ive started seems to me the Tin Pantithesis of melody  
So to spare you all the pain Ill skip the darn thing and sing the refrain  
  
The night is young the skies are clear  
And if you want to go walkin dear  
Its delightful its delicious its delovely  
  
I understand the reason why  
Youre sentimental cause so am I  
Its delightful its delicious its delovely  
  
You can tell at a glance what a swell night this is for romance  
You can hear dear Mother Nature murmuring low Let yourself go  
  
So please be sweet my chickadee  
And when I kiss ya just say to me  
Its delightful its delicious its delectable its delirious  
Its dilemma its de limit its deluxe its delovely
