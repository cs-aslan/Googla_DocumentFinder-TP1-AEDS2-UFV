Why do you come here  
And why do you hang around  
Im so sorry  
Im so sorry  
  
Why do you come here  
When you know it makes things hard for me  
When you know oh  
Why do you come  
Why do you telephone Hmm  
And why send me silly notes  
Im so sorry  
Im so sorry  
  
Why do you come here  
When you know it makes things hard for me  
When you know oh  
Why do you come  
You had to sneak into my room  
Just to read my diary  
It was just to see just to see  
All the things you knew Id written about you  
Oh so many illustrations  
Oh but  
Im so very sickened  
Oh I am so sickened now  
  
Oh it was a good lay good lay  
It was a good lay good lay  
It was a good lay good lay  
Oh  
It was a good lay good lay  
It was a good lay good lay  
Oh it was a good lay good lay  
Oh  
Oh it was a good lay  
It was a good lay  
Oh a good lay  
Oh it was a good lay  
Good lay good lay  
Oh  
It was a good lay  
It was a good lay
