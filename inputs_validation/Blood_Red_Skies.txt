As the sun goes down I move around  
Keeping to the shadows  
Life hangs by a thread  
And Ive heard it said that Ill not see tomorrow  
  
If thats my destiny itll have to be  
So Ill face the future  
Running out of time  
Im on the line  
But Ill go down fighting  
  
Felt the hand of justice  
Telling wrong from right  
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night  
  
Cybernetic heartbeat  
Digital precise  
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice  
  
Not begging you  
Im telling you  
  
You wont break me  
You wont make me  
You wont take me  
Under blood red skies  
  
You wont break me  
You wont take me  
Ill fight you under  
Blood red skies  
  
Through a shattered city watched by laser eyes  
Overhead the night squad glides  
The decaying paradise  
  
Automatic sniper  
With computer sights  
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night  
  
Theyre closing in  
Theyll never win  
  
You wont break me  
You wont make me  
You wont take me  
Under blood red skies  
  
You wont break me  
You wont take me  
Ill fight you under  
Blood red skies  
  
As the end is drawing near  
Standing proud I wont give in to fear  
As I die a legend will be born  
I will stand I will fight  
Youll never take me alive  
  
Ill stand my ground  
I wont go down  
  
You wont break me  
You wont make me  
You wont take me  
Under blood red skies  
  
You wont break me  
You wont take me  
Ill fight you under  
Blood red skies  
  
Youll never take me alive  
Im telling you  
Hands of justice  
I will stand I will fight  
As the sun goes down  
I wont give in to fear
