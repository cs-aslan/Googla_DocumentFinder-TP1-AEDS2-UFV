Always blue all in a mist  
Its plain as can be  
Youre so mean to me  
But everything happens for the best  
You always play around  
Youre running my heart so deep in the ground  
That OK everything happens for the best  
I loved you so madly  
Knew you would be true  
Now this thing has happened dear  
Its over all over because were through  
So sorry dear it end this way  
Since the world begin  
The old folks say  
Everything happens for the best  
  
I loved you so madly  
Knew you would be true  
Now this thing has happened dear  
Its over all over because were through  
So sorry dear it end this way  
Since the world begin  
The old folks say  
Everything happens for the best
