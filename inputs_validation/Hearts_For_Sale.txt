My spirit is winging  
My soul is free  
Im doing my drinking  
In good company  
The musics screaming  
My feet are flying  
Everybodys laughing  
And nobodys crying  
Sneak suspicion  
It drags me down  
A nagging feeling  
Going round  
  
Hearts for sale  
Going cheap  
Hearts for sale  
Lovers leap  
  
My bellys full  
My glass is brimming  
The women look so beautiful  
And I feel like singing  
The voice of conscience  
The voice of reason  
Is yecking in my plans  
I call that treason  
  
Hearts for sale  
Going cheap  
Hearts for sale  
Blood runs deep  
  
Im losing my willpower  
My bloods running cold  
My bodys on pause  
My minds stuck on hold  
There aint nothing I can do about it  
Sneak suspicion  
It drags me down  
Nagging feeling  
Going round  
  
Hearts for sale  
Going cheap  
Hearts for sale  
Blood runs deep  
Hearts for sale  
  
I dont need a doctor  
I need a deputation  
You dont want my loving  
You can just take my resignation  
Im under the hammer  
Im a full time worker  
Im a real body slammer
