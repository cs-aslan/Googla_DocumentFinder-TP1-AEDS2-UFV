Ive got a dirty dirty feelin  
Dirty feelins goin on  
You know I almost hit the ceilin  
When I woke up and you were gone  
  
I took you in when you were hungry  
And now your cuttin out on me  
Im gonna help you little darlin  
That aint the way its gonna be  
  
I hear youre pretty good at runnin  
But pretty soon youll slip and fall  
Thats when Ill drag you home with me girl  
Im gonna chain you to the wall  
  
You know Im lookin for you baby  
I aint gonna take it layin down  
I heard that you were cookin baby  
Way on the other side of town  
  
Ive got a dirty dirty feelin  
Dirty feelins goin on  
You know I almost hit the ceilin  
When I woke up and you were gone
