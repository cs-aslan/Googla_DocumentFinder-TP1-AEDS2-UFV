Everybodys laughing  
Yes everybodys laughing  
They know that you and I are through  
And everybodys laughing  
  
I told the world you loved me  
And bragged about it proudly  
But since they know its over  
Theyre laughing at me loudly  
  
People love to linger  
So they can point a finger  
And tear apart a gal whose heart  
Was taken through the wringer  
  
It we could start all over  
The laugh might be on them  
But meanwhile  
Everybodys laughing  
  
It we could start all over  
The laugh might be on them  
But meanwhile  
Everybodys laughing
