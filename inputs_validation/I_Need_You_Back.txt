If I had shown what you really meant to me  
Maybe then youd still be a part of me  
I was wrong not to let you know  
This feeling thats hard for me to show  
  
Since youve gone Ive always been alone  
Feeling down and sorry for myself  
I look at your picture and there I find  
I wont make it through another rain  
Without your sunshine  
  
I need you back  
I need you here to guide me  
Please come back  
Youre the only one whos ever loved me  
I need you back  
Lets start all over again  
Share the love you had for me then  
  
Since Ive said what I came here to say  
Guess Id better be going on my way  
But before I go I just got to let you know  
Youre the only one who can make me happy again  
  
I need you back  
I need you here to guide me  
Please come back  
Youre the only one whos ever loved me  
I need you back  
Lets start all over again  
Share the love you had for me then  
  
Share the love you had for me then
