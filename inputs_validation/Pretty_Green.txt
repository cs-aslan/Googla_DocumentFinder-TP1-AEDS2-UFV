Ive got a pocket full of pretty green  
Im gonna put it in the fruit machine  
Im gonna put it in the juke box  
Its gonna play all the records in the hit parade  
Ive got a pocket full of pretty green  
Im gonna give it to the man behind the counter  
Hes gonna give me food and water  
Im gonna eat that and look for more  
This is the pretty green this is society  
You cant do nothing unless its in the pocket oh no

This is the pretty green this is society  
You cant do nothing unless its in the pocket oh no  
And they didnt teach me that in school  
Its something that I learnt on my own  
That power is measured by the pound or the fist  
Its as clear as this hey
