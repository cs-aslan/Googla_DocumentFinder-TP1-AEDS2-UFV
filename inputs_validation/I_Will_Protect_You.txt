What you gonna do and what you gonna feel when suddenly I slip away  
Almost am a ghost of who I use to be yesterday  
How you going to touch and how will you collect the beauty when it turns to
dust  
Everything we make the cells we generate are both of us  
  
Chorus  
Please be aware that I am you  
Nothing could be more certain  
This aint the time the place for us to understand this life  
  
Hold you in my arms Ill hold you in my gaze singing with my dying breath  
Underneath this earth Id resurrect your soul and nothing less  
Sorry for the space if I could fill the void an ocean wouldnt hold the love  
And everything I have and all I ever was is not enough  
  
Chorus  
Please be aware that I am you  
Nothing could be more certain  
  
This aint the time the place for us to understand this life  
  
I will forget me  
I will forget me  
I will forget me  
I will protect you x9  
  
Chorus  
Please be aware that I am you  
Nothing could be more certain  
This aint the time the place for us to understand this life  
  
This aint the time this aint the place x4  
  
This aint the time this aint the place x3  
  
I will protect you x5
