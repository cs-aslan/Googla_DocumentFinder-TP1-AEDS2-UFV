Every day I wake up and its Sunday  
What evers in my eye wont go away  
The radio is playing all the usual  
And whats a wonder wall anyway  
  
Because my inside is outside  
My right sides on the left side  
Cause Im writing to reach you now but  
I might never reach you  
I only want to teach you about you  
But thats not you  
  
Its good to know that you are home for Christmas  
Its good to know that you are doing well  
Its good to know that youre no longer hurting  
Its good to know Im feeling not so well  
  
Because my inside in outside  
My right sides on the left side  
Cause Im writing to reach you now but  
I might never reach you  
I only want to teach you  
About you but thats not you  
To know its true but that wont do  
  
Maybe then tomorrow will be Monday  
And whatevers in my eye should go away  
Still the radio keeps playing all the usual  
And whats a wonder wall anyway  
  
Because my inside in outside  
My right sides on the left side  
Cause Im writing to reach you  
I might never reach you  
I only want to teach you  
About you but thats not you  
And you know its true but that wont do  
And you know its you Im talking to
