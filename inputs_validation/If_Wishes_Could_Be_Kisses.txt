Baby if wishes could be kisses  
And dreams could make you mine  
I wouldnt be asitting here  
Wasting all this time  
No no baby if you call me  
Id race down the street  
Id be there so fast  
Youd think I had wings on my feet  
Oh baby if wishes could be kisses  
Id wish with all my mind  
I wouldnt have to make believe  
Im in your arms tonight  
  
No no baby  
I could thrill you if youd let me try  
Wed take off together  
And wed tell this world goodbye  
  
But I know it just cant be  
Unless you feel the same as me oh yeahheah  
Baby if wishes could be kisses  
Then Id be first in line  
If Im not wrong it wont take long  
Til youre my valentine  
  
Oh oh baby if you hear me  
Make me know you do  
If Im lucky Ill find out  
That youve been wishing too  
Acome on baby  
Acome on baby  
If wishes could be kisses oh yeah  
Oh if wishes could be  
  
Woah baby if you hear me  
Make me know you do  
If Im lucky Ill find out  
That youve been wishing too  
Acome on baby  
Woah come on baby  
If wishes could be kisses now yeah  
If wishes could be kisses yeah
