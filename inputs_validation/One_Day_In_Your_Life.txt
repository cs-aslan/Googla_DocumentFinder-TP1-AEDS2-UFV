One day in your life  
Youll remember a place  
Someone touching your face  
Youll come back and youll look around youll  
  
One day in your life  
Youll remember the love you found here  
Youll remember me somehow  
Though you dont need me now  
I will stay in your heart  
And when things fall apart  
Youll remember one day  
  
One day in your life  
When you find that youre always waiting  
For a love we used to share  
Just call my name and Ill be there  
Youll remember me somehow  
Though you dont need me now  
I will stay in your heart  
And when things fall apart  
Youll remember one day  
  
One day in your life  
When you find that youre always lonely  
For a love we used to share  
Just call my name and Ill be there
