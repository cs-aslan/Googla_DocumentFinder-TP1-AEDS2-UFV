Instructions from the manual could not have been much more plain the blues are
still required the blues are still required again  
Past territorial pissposts past whispers in the closets past screamin from
the rooftops we live to survive our paradoxes  
  
Men here of the secret they pass in upholstered silence they only exist in
crisis they only exist in silence past territorial  
Pissposts past whispers in the closets past screamin from the rooftops we
live to survive our paradoxes well live to survive  
Our paradoxes
