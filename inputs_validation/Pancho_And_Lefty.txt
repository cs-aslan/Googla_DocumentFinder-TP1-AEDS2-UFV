Living on the road my friend  
Is gonna keep you free and clean  
Now you wear your skin like iron  
Your breath as hard as kerosene  
You werent your mamas only boy  
But her favorite one it seems  
She began to cry when you said goodbye  
And sank into your dreams  
  
Pancho was a bandit boy  
His horse was fast as polished steel  
He wore his gun outside his pants  
For all the honest world to feel  
Pancho met his match you know  
On the deserts down in Mexico  
Nobody heard his dying words  
Ah but thats the way it goes  
  
All the Federales say  
They could have had him any day  
They only let him slip away  
Out of kindness I suppose  
  
Lefty he cant sing the blues  
All night long like he used to  
The dust that Pancho bit down south  
Ended up in Leftys mouth  
The day they laid poor Pancho low  
Lefty split for Ohio  
Where he got the bread to go  
There aint nobody knows  
  
The poets tell how Pancho fell  
And Leftys living in cheap hotels  
The deserts quiet Clevelands cold  
And so the story ends were told  
Pancho needs your prayers its true  
But save a few for Lefty too  
He only did what he had to do  
And now hes growing old
