I dont have to tell you  
What this is all about  
Cause baby half the fun  
Is in us figuring it all out  
  
So why you gotta ask me  
What Im doing now  
Cause I dont like to question  
What I still havent found  
  
So dont turn off the lights  
I dont want to be  
In the dark tonight  
Cause I cant read your mind  
I need to know if  
What Im doing is right  
So Dont turn off the lights  
So Dont turn off the lights  
  
So tell me how  
Were gonna get there  
Its hard to even try  
But if we move together  
Well end up on the same side  
  
So dont turn off the lights  
I dont want to be  
In the dark tonight  
Cause I cant read your mind  
I need to know if  
What Im doing is right  
So Dont turn off the lights  
So Dont turn off the lights  
  
If you could know  
What Im feeling  
Would you run and  
Where would you go  
If you want to know  
What Im thinking  
Then just turn on the lights  
And youll know  
  
So dont turn off the lights  
I dont want to be  
In the dark tonight  
Cause I cant read your mind  
I need to know if  
What Im doing is right  
So Dont turn off the lights  
  
So dont turn off the lights  
I dont want to be  
In the dark tonight  
Cause I cant read your mind  
I need to know if  
What Im doing is right  
So Dont turn off the lights  
So Dont turn off the lights  
So Dont turn off the lights  
So Dont turn off the lights  
  
Dont turn off the lights
