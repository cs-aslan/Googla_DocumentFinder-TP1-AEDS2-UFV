Honey what have you done  
Dum dum dum its the sound its the sound  
  
Janies got a gun  
Janies got a gun  
Her whole worlds come undone  
From lookin straight at the sun  
What did her daddy do  
What did he put you through  
They say when Janie was arrested  
They found him underneath a train  
But man he had it comin  
Now that Janies got a gun  
She aint never gonna be the same  
  
Janies got a gun  
Janies got a gun  
Her dog days just begun  
Now everybody is on the run  
  
Tell me now its untrue  
What did her daddy do  
He jacked a little bitty baby  
The man has got to be insane  
They say the spell that he was under  
The lightning and the thunder  
Knew that someone had to stop the rain  
  
Run away run away from the pain  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Run away run away from the pain  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Run away run away run run away  
  
Janies got a gun  
Janies got a gun  
Her dog days just begun  
Now everybody is on the run  
  
What did her daddy do  
It was Janies last I O You  
She had to take him down easy  
And put a bullet in his brain  
She said cause nobody believs me  
The man was such a sleaze he aint  
Never gonna be the same  
  
Run away run away from the pain  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Run away run away from the pain  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Run away run away run run away
