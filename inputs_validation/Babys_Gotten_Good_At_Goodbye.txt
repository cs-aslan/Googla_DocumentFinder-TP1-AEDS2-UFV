What a rotten day this turned out to be  
I still cant believe shed leave so easily  
She just got all her things threw em into a pile  
Then she loaded her car and said after a while  
She done this before but this time she didnt cry  
  
Thats why Im sittin on the front steps  
Starin down the road wonderin if shell come Back this time I dont know  
After she packed  
When she looked back  
There were no tears in her eyes  
And thats got me worried thinking  
Maybe my babys gotten good at a goodbyes  
  
All the times before shed break down and cry  
Shed make her threats but her heart wasnt set on goodbye  
She just wanted me to hear what she had to say  
Now Im lost for words since she went away  
She may not return for this time she didnt cry  
  
Thats why Im sittin on the front steps  
Starin down the road wonderin if shell come back  
This time I dont know  
After she packed when she looked back  
There were no tears in her eyes  
And thats got me worried thinking  
Maybe my babys gotten good at goodbye  
  
Thats why Im sittin on the front steps  
Staring down the road wonderin if shell come back  
This time I dont know  
After she packed when she looked back  
There were no tears in her eyes  
And thats got me worried thinking  
Maybe my babys gotten good at goodbye
