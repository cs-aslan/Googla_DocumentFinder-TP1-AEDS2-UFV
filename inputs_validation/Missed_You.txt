Hey Pal let me lean on you and talk awhile  
Your planes been delayed by the rain  
Or something  
I wouldnt even fly away  
If I had one good reason to stay  
But you said  
If you dont need my love  
Im gonna find someone who does  
And Im not hanging around  
This old heart is far to proud  
She got tired of me  
Staying out late everynight  
Id fall up the stair  
Thought shed always be there  
But suddenly Im alone  
And Im not accustomed to sleeping alone  
She said if you dont need my love  
Im gonna find someone who does  
Youve stripped me of everything  
And youve torn down all my dreams  
Its been two long weeks  
Since shes been gone  
Thought I had her in the palm of my hands  
She said Im through dont try to call me  
Cause you wont even find me  
Cause if you dont need my love  
Im going to find someone who does  
And the heartache youve give me  
Youll get it back just wait and see  
Well well well well  
Id give anything to hold her in my bed again  
I just want to feel her breath on my back  
She said my blood cant give her love  
No way  
She said if you dont need my love  
Im gonna find someone who does  
And Im gonna take our child  
Cause I dont want him running wild  
Hey pal I think they just called out your flight  
Put down your glass dont forget your boarding pass  
And if your looking or you found love  
Or sunshine thats enough  
Dont play hard to get  
Cause that aint where its at  
Give her all your love  
Place her high above  
I missed you baby  
I missed you baby  
Yea I missed
