Sometimes at night I dont know why  
I get the feeling that I wanna say goodbye  
I can see me packin up a bag and walkin out the door  
Im goin back to live the life I used to live before  
  
Out on my own all by myself  
Not takin care of me or anybody else  
But how could I ever word it in the note Id have write  
Oh I dont know how to say goodbye  
  
I lie in bed and Im wide awake  
Next to the one whose heart Id hate to have to break  
Then I look into her pretty eyes that dont deserve to cry  
And I dont know how to say goodbye  
  
Each time I hold her its love all over  
And in my heart its understood  
Ill never learn how to live without her  
And Id be crazy if I could  
  
Shes good to me and I believe  
She let me go with it meant happiness for me  
Maybe thats the reason why I find my tongue is tied  
And I dont know how to say goodbye  
  
Each time I hold her its love all over  
And in my heart its understood  
Ill never learn how to live without her  
And Id be crazy if I could  
  
I love her so I wanna tell her now  
I think Ill wake her with a kiss and show her how  
And I know shell whisper in my ear a million reasons why  
I dont know how to say goodbye  
  
And when shes layin in my arms I cannot tell a lie  
I dont know how to say goodbye  
  
I dont know how to say goodbye  
I dont know how to say goodbye
