Theres an old  coming on my new tv  
So I go out for a quiet drink  
But it costs a packet and its such a racket  
That I cant hear myself think  
Theres a microchip one armed bandit with a screw loose  
A stripper in the corner with a face like thunder  
A terrible band playing johnny be goode  
So Id rather go home and stay quietly alone  
I get up in the morning with the radio on  
I do my makeup and I go to look for work  
Somebody tells me that the jobs just gone  
And Ive been replaced by some computer jerk  
I would talk to my boyfriend but I never can  
cause a space invader stole my man  
Theres a dreadful playing johnny be goode  
So Id rather go home and stay quietly alone  
Trying to keep my sanity is hard to do  
Living like a hermit all alone  
Find an occupation that wont deafen me  
My sense of realitys gone  
My temperature is getting higher and higher  
And Im shaking in my jeans  
cause I get so angry when Im shut in  
With one of those machines  
I would talk to my boyfriend but I never can  
cause a space invader stole my man  
And the synthesizers playing johnny be goode  
Then Id rather go home and stay quietly alone  
Quietly alone  
Quietly alone  
Quietly alone  
Quietly alone
