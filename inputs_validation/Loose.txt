Now look out  
I took a ride with the pretty music  
I went down and baby you can tell  
I took a ride with the pretty music  
Now Im putting it to you straight from hell  
Ill stick it deep inside  
Ill stick it deep inside  
Cause Im loose  
I feel fine to be dancin baby  
I feel fine Im a shakin leaf  
I feel fine to be dancin baby  
Cause its love yeah I do believe  
Ill stick it deep inside  
Ill stick it deep inside  
Cause Im loose  
And Ill stick it deep inside  
And Ill stick it hey  
Well Im loose well Im loose  
Well Im loose
