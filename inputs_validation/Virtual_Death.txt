Reach out and take for me fruit of the poison  
Tree  
Give me your body and your soul  
My youth is fading fast years melt into the past  
This mortal life will take its toll  
  
Im sick and tired of losing you find this so  
Amusing  
Its all I have to keep myself in this state Im in  
  
This park of natures fire my only one desire  
This world is hanging by a thread  
  
Im sick and tired of losing you find this so  
Amusing  
Its all I have to keep myself in this state Im in  
  
People always tried to change me alter everything  
I am  
Though you find this so amusing you left me in  
This state Im in  
Virtual death  
  
You may think this existence is just a human  
Weakness  
Inside my mind its near the end  
Virtual death  
  
Im losing Im fading fast Im dying virtual death
