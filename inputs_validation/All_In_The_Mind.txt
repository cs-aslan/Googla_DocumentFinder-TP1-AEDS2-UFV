So I got in the car  
We drove for a mile  
I didnt even learn her name  
She said Youve got the money and Ive got the time  
  
Five years later on  
She became my lover  
Taught me everything I know  
She said You were born to fly my son  
I said Hey I already know  
  
Because its all inside  
Because its all inside  
I was born to fly fly pretty high  
  
Five years later on  
She became my father  
Taught me everything I know  
She said You were born to burn my love  
I said Hey I already know  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X  
  
So waste your time  
On people who dont know which way to go  
Theyll never said you were never said  
You were up in the sky  
Because its all in the mind  
  
Just get in the car  
Turn out the light  
Dont care who you are  
You could be a star  
Or you could be a fool  
Dont care what I find  
Its all in the mind
