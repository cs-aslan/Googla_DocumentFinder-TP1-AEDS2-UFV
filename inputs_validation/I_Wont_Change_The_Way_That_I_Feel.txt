If I live a thousand years or more  
Youll still be the one Im living for  
And every night I whisper a prayer  
That every day of my life you will always be there  
I cant stop the world from changing  
I cant say what time may reveal  
But I know from now until forever  
I wont change the way that I feel  
I wont change the way that I feel  
About you baby  
If I only have one life to live  
I will give you all I have to give  
So dont believe these are faithless times  
Cause as long as I live you will always be mine  
I cant stop the world from changing  
I cant say what time may reveal  
But I know from now until forever  
I wont change the way that I feel  
I wont change the way that I feel  
I wont change the way I feel  
I wont change the way that I feel  
I wont change the way that I feel  
I wont change the way that I feel  
I cant stop the world from changing  
I cant say what time may reveal  
But I know from now until forever  
I wont change the way that I feel  
I wont change the way that I feel  
About you baby  
I wont change the way that I feel  
I wont change the way that I feel  
I wont change the way I feel  
About you baby  
I wont change the way that I feel  
About you baby
