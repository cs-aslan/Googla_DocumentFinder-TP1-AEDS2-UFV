Got my good side at the ready  
If the other one is on the mend  
Feel it in my bones when you break my back  
Break it just to watch me bend  
Anyway for once you admit it  
No matter what your good book says  
Never lookin back cause I aint no saint  
Just another teenage head  
  
You gotta wait for the feeling and you wait for the feeling  
And you wait and you shiver and you shake  
Crawlin back and forth from the black and white  
  
Over and over again  
Over and over and over again  
Aint no turning back cause Im walkin a line  
Walkin a line walkin a line  
For you  
  
Maybe if you swear youll save me  
Maybe save myself instead  
Swear across my heart and I hope to die  
Maybe we could just play dead  
Runnin out of time but Im ready  
Run out when I run this red  
See you on the chase I will track you down  
Even though youre miles ahead  
  
You gotta wait for the feeling and you wait for the feeling  
And you wait and you shiver and you shake  
Crawlin back and forth from the black and white  
  
Over and over again  
Over and over and over again  
Aint no turning back no there aint no turning back  
No there aint no turning back no there aint no turning back  
Aint no turning back cause Im walkin a line  
Walkin a line for you
