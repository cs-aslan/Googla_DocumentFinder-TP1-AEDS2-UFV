When we lift off then youll be tipped off too  
How my heart it soars for you  
Soon youll be flying gravity defying  
Your dreams will all come true in the blue  
  
Flying over a cootoncandy clouds  
Hanging from a fuselage  
A walk on a wing is just the thing  
For a high in the sky montage  
  
So darlin put your goggles on  
Upupand away well fly  
In a big ginormous airplane  
In a big ginormous airplane  
In a big ginormous airplane  
In the Sky
