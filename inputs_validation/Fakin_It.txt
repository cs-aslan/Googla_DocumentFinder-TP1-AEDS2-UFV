If she stays she stays here  
The girl does what she wants to do  
She knows what she wants to do  
And I know Im fakin it  
Im not really makin it  
  
Im such a dubious soul  
And a walk in the garden  
Wears me down  
Tangled in the fallen vines  
Pickin up the punch lines  
Ive just been fakin it  
Not really makin it  
  
Is there any danger  
No no not really  
Just lean on me  
Takin time to treat  
Your friendly neighbors honestly  
Ive just been fakin it  
Im not really makin it  
This feeling of fakin it  
I still havent shaken it  
  
Prior to this lifetime  
I surely was a tailor  
Good morning Mr Leitch  
Have you had a busy day   
I own the tailors face and hands  
I am the tailors face and hands and  
I know Im fakin it  
Im not really makin it  
This feeling of fakin it  
I still havent shaken it
