Ooh  
Dont think I cant feel theres something wrong  
Youve been the sweetest part of my life so long  
I look in your eyes theres a distant light  
And you and I know therell be a storm tonight  
This is getting serious  
Are you thinking bout you or us  
  
Chorus  
Dont say what youre about to say  
Look back before you leave my life  
Be sure before you close that door  
Before you roll those dice  
Baby think twice  
  
Baby think twice for the sake of our love for the memory  
For the fire and the faith that was you and me  
Babe I know it aint easy when your soul cries out for higher ground  
Cos when youre halfway up youre always halfway down  
But baby this is serious  
Are you thinking bout you or us  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Breakdown  
Baby this is serious  
Are you thinking bout you or us  
  
Dont say what youre about to say  
Look back before you leave my life  
Be sure before you close that door  
Before you roll those dice  
  
Dont do what youre about to do  
My everything depends on you  
And whatever it takes Ill sacrifice  
Before you roll those dice  
Baby think twice
