I know the truth  
But I cant say  
And I have to turn my head  
And look the other way  
  
Im not afraid  
And I wont lie  
As long as I see no wrong  
I wont need to testify  
  
I see the world  
And Im looking from a high place  
Way above it all  
Standing on higher ground  
  
I breathe the air  
While theyre running in a rat race  
Way above it all  
Standing on higher ground  
  
I feel the blow  
But I dont speak  
And I have to close my eyes  
Pretending Im asleep  
  
Well I see the tears  
But I dont cry  
As long as I do no wrong  
I dont need an alibi  
  
I see the world  
And Im looking from a high place  
Way above it all  
Standing on higher ground  
  
I breathe the air  
While theyre running in a rat race  
Way above it all  
Standing on higher ground
