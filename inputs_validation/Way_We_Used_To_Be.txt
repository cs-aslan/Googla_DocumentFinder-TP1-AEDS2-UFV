How come we cant talk the way we used to do  
Nothing seems to be the same  
Have we forgotten all the things we knew  
Was it you or I who changed  
We got to find the answer let the secrets fly  
Enough of telling stories and our well meaning lies  
Things dont seem to be the same no matter how I tried  
Theres no rhythm to the rain  
Wind still whispers through the leaves on high  
But they no longer sing your name  
We got to find the answer let the secrets fly  
Enough of telling stories and our well meaning lies  
We got to try to build what we had in the past  
Tryings half the battle if we lose it we cant last  
I heard myself just say the things I could never say before  
And listen to the rhythm of the rain  
Wind just whispered through the leaves on high  
And I thought I heard them sing your name  
We got to find the answer let the secrets fly  
Enough of telling stories and our well meaning lies  
We got to try to build what we had in the past  
Tryings half the battle if we lose it we cant last  
I heard myself just say the things I could never say before  
And listen to the rhythm of the rain  
Wind just whispered through the leaves on high  
And I thought I heard them sing your name  
And I thought I heard them sing your name
