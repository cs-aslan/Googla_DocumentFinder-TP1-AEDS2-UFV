Lilly likes Beatles songs  
The words are off but they dont feel that wrong  
She came in through the bedroom window like a blue girl  
Like a blue girl like a blue girl  
  
Never has to try too hard  
Her whispered words could mend broken hearts  
Her sundress shines through a hurricane  
Making all boys squeal like swine before her  
  
Hey Little Lilly  
Dont believe everything you see  
Hey Little Lilly  
Dont believe everything you see  
  
Round and round and round she goes  
Like a sweethearts girls at the movie show  
Lilly leans back in the very last row  
The lights go low the show goes on  
  
Even schoolgirls like her way  
Oh marry the preacher youd make a little angel someday  
Silent as a child when the first snows fall  
Perfect player in anyones own little world  
  
Hey Little Lilly  
Dont believe everything you see  
Hey Little Lilly  
Dont believe everything you see  
  
Round and round the taxi goes  
Like Shirleys curlies at the movie shows  
Lilly leans back in the very last row  
And the lights go low the show goes on  
  
Lilly likes Beatles songs  
The words are off but they dont feel that wrong  
She came in through the bedroom window like a blue girl  
Like a blue girl like a blue girl  
  
Hey Little Lilly  
Dont believe everything you see  
Hey Little Lilly  
Dont believe everything you see  
Hey Little Lilly  
Its only real if you believe  
Its only real if you believe  
Its only real if you believe
