Come away with me in the night  
Come away with me  
And I will write you a song  
  
Come away with me on a bus  
Come away where they cant tempt us with their lies  
  
I want to walk with you  
On a cloudy day  
In fields where the yellow grass grows kneehigh  
So wont you try to come  
  
Come away with me and well kiss  
On a mountaintop  
Come away with me  
And Ill never stop loving you  
  
And I want to wake up with the rain  
Falling on a tin roof  
While Im safe there in your arms  
So all I ask is for you  
To come away with me in the night  
Come away with me
