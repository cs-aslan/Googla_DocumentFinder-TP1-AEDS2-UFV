Oh Lord wont you listen in to me now  
Oh Love I got to get me back to you somehow  
I never knew that life was loaded  
Id only hung around birds and bees  
I never knew that things exploded  
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees  
Looking for my life looking for my life  
  
Oh boy youve no idea what Ive been through  
Oh Lord I feel so stuck that I cant get to you  
Had no idea that I was heading  
Toward a state of emergency  
I had no fear where I was treading  
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees  
Looking for my life  
  
Caught up on me with intensity  
Had no idea where I was heading  
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees  
Looking for my life looking for my life  
  
Oh boys youve no idea what Ive been through  
Oh Lord I got to get back somehow to you  
  
I never knew that life was loaded  
I only hung around birds and bees  
I never knew that things exploded  
I only found it out when I was down upon my kees  
Looking for my life  
  
I never got any any GCEs  
I never knew that things exploded  
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees  
Looking for my life looking for my life  
Looking For my Life
