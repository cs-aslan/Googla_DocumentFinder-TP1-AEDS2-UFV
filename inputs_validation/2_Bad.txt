Told me that youre doin wrong  
Word out shockin all alone  
Cryin wolf aint like a man  
Throwin rocks to hide your hands  
You aint done enough for me

You are disgustin me yeah yeah  
Youre aiming just for me  
You are disgustin me  
Just want your cut from me  
But too bad too bad  
  
Look who just walked in the place  
Dead and stuffy in the face  
Look whos standing if you please  
Though you tried to bring me to my knees  
  
Too bad too bad about it

Creepin from a dusty hole  
Tales of what somebody told  
  
What do you want from me  
What do you want from me  
Tired of you haunting me yeah yeah  
Youre aiming just for me  
You are disgustin me  
You got blood lust for me  
But too bad too bad  
  
Look who got slapped in the face

Reality brings forth realizm

Nine five shaq represent with the Thrilla  
Grab my crotch twist my knee then Im through
