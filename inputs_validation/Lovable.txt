Chorus  
Its going round the town  
Its going round the town  
Its going round the town  
Youre so lovable  
  
My baby gave me notice to quit  
I just cant get used to it  
She broke my little heart in two  
Now somebody else is being the same old you  
  
Chorus  
  
My baby has Egyptian eyes  
And a wicked look beyond compare  
If you thought I was a fool for you  
Then I must be a bigger fool for her  
  
Chorus  
  
Hed turn the flowers of springtime into a wreath  
He says hed love you eternally  
I say please please cant you keep it brief  
  
They say theyre going to bury you  
Because youre so lovable  
Put your money where your mouth was  
Youre so lovable  
Each tender mumble brings us closer to bedlam  
Youre so lovable  
The toast of the town and the talk of the bedroom  
Youre so lovable  
  
Youre so sweet  
Youre so honest  
You say Ill be true to you boy  
But I wont promise  
Then you say you love me  
Then you show me  
As you lie there so lifelike below me  
  
Chorus
