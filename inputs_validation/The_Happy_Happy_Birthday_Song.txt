Once a year we celebrate  
With stupid hats and plastic plates  
The fact that you were able to make  
Another trip around the sun  
  
And the whole clan gathers round  
And gifts and laughter do abound  
And we let out a joyful sound  
And sing that stupid song  
  
Happy birthday  
Now youre one year older  
Happy birthday  
Your life still isnt over  
Happy birthday  
You did not accomplish much  
But you didnt die this year  
I guess thats good enough  
  
So lets drink to your fading health  
And hope you dont remind yourself  
The chance of finding fame and wealth  
Decrease with every year  
  
Does it feel like youre doing laps  
And eating food and taking naps  
And hoping that someday perhaps  
Your life will hold some cheer  
  
Happy birthday  
What have you done that matters  
Happy birthday  
Youre starting to get fatter  
Happy birthday  
Its downhill from now on  
Try not to remind yourself  
Your best years are all gone  
  
If cryogenics were all free  
Then you could live like Walt Disney  
And live for all eternity  
Inside a block of ice  
  
But instead your time is set  
This is the only life you get  
And though it hasnt ended yet  
Sometimes you wish it might  
  
Happy birthday  
You wish you had more money  
Happy birthday  
Your lifes so sad its funny  
Happy birthday  
How much more can you take  
But your friends are hungry  
So just cut the stupid cake  
  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday dear
