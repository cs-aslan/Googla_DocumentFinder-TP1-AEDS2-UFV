Well a man come on the 6 oclock news  
Said somebodys been shot somebodys been abused  
Somebody blew up a building somebody stole a car  
Somebody got away somebody didnt get too far yeah  
They didnt get too far  
  
Grandpappy told my pappy back in my day son  
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done  
Take all the rope in Texas find a tall oak tree  
Round up all them bad boys hang them high in the street  
For all the people to see  
  
That justice is the one thing you should always find  
You got to saddle up your boys you got to draw a hard line  
When the gun smoke settles well sing a victory tune  
And well all meet back at the local saloon  
Well raise up our glasses against evil forces singing  
Whiskey for my men beer for my horses  
  
We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds  
Too much corruption and crime in the streets  
Its time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground  
Send em all to their maker and hell settle em down  
You can bet hell set em down  
  
Cause justice is the one thing you should always find  
You got to saddle up your boys you got to draw a hard line  
When the gun smoke settles well sing a victory tune  
Well all meet back at the local saloon  
And well raise up our glasses against evil forces singing  
Whiskey for my men beer for my horses  
Whiskey for my men beer for my horses  
  
You know justice is the one thing you should always find  
You got to saddle up your boys you got to draw a hard line  
When the gun smoke settles well sing a victory tune  
And well all meet back at the local saloon  
And well raise up our glasses against evil forces singing  
Whiskey for my men beer for my horses  
Singing whiskey for my men beer for my horses
