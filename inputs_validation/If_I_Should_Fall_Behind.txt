C Bruce Springsteen  
We said wed walk together baby come what may  
There come the twilight should we lose our way  
If as were walking hands should slip free  
Ill wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
We swore wed travel darling side by side  
And wed help each other stay in stride  
Each lovers steps fall so differently  
So Ill wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Everyone dreams of love lasting and true  
But you and I know what this world can do  
Lets make our steps clear that the other may see  
And Ill wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Now theres a beautiful river in the valley ahead  
And there neath the oaks bough soon well be wed  
Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees  
Ill wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Darling Ill wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Darling Ill wait for you
