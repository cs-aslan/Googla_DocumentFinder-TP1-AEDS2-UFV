One dark and stormy night  
Big John was feeling blue  
Aint he didnt seem right  
So he didnt know just what to do  
I said do please tell me  
Aint you satisfied  
He looked around so pitiful  
And to me he replied  
Keeps on raining  
Look how its raining  
Daddy he cant make no time  
Wind keeps blowing  
Howl winds blowing  
  
Soon Ill find  
In the winter time  
When it starts to snow  
I know Billy  
Youve got to have some dough  
Keeps on raining  
Look how its raining  
Daddy he cant make no time  
  
Aint the rain just beautiful  
Some people say  
But Id rather see it  
In a fine movie place  
Keeps on raining  
Look how its raining  
Your daddy he cant make no time  
No daddy he cant make no time
