Dont get me wrong  
I aint the kind  
To turn away from you  
When somethings on your mind  
  
But you have to know  
You just have to see  
Im having my troubles babe  
And theyre all too much for me  
  
You picked a real bad time  
To spoil my concentration  
You picked a real bad time  
To pass along the bad news  
Tell me why you try  
To give me aggravation  
You picked a real bad time  
Cause this mans got the blues  
  
Dont get me wrong  
Youre not alone  
And Id like to help you  
But Ive got problems of my own  
  
Its a bitter phase  
Im going through  
And I can run from strangers darlin  
But I just cant hide from you  
  
You picked a real bad time  
To spoil my concentration  
You picked a real bad time  
To pass along the bad news  
Tell me why you try  
To give me aggravation  
You picked a real bad time  
And I got time to lose  
  
Aint it the truth  
When they say  
That the only thing worth dying for  
Is our freedom  
Aint it the proof  
That someday  
We will all be lying on our backs  
Free at last from income tax  
  
Dont you get me wrong  
The mood wont last  
And Ill be myself again  
Soon as this pain has passed  
  
And Im standing here  
Dont ask me how  
Ill make it up to you  
Someday but not right now  
  
You picked a real bad time  
To spoil my concentration  
You picked a real bad time  
To pass along the bad news  
You caused a real hard line  
To invade my isolation  
You picked a real bad time  
Cause this mans got the blues  
  
Aint it the truth  
When they say  
All you need is love but all youll want is forgiveness  
Aint it the proof  
That someday  
Even love will not provide for man  
The way that life insurance can  
  
You picked a real bad time  
To spoil my concentration  
You picked a real bad time  
To pass along the bad news  
Tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me  
Why you tryin to give me aggravation  
You picked a real bad time cause this mans got the blues
