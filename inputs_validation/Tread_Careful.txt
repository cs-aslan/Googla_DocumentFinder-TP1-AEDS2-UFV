Tread careful  
Because youre treading on my dreams  
Tread careful  
Because Ive just one heart  
Tread careful  
Let me down slowly  
Or Ill forget how to dream  
Chorus  
I wont forget anything  
I love you  
I wont forgive anyone  
Do you love me  
Tread careful  
You hear the sound of my breathing  
Tread careful  
Because I feel this sound  
Tread careful  
Im falling in a glasshouse  
Im trying hard to begin  
Because I want it to get harder  
Tread careful  
Before I change my mind  
Tread careful  
I could surprise you  
I know something you want to do  
repeat chorus  
Tread careful  
Im sure you dont care but  
Tread careful  
I could change your mind  
Tread careful  
Ive been waiting for you  
There is no comfort in here  
repeat chorus
