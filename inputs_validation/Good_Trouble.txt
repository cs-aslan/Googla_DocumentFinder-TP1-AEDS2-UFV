Babe Im gettin the message its finally comin through  
After the show Ill get a hold of you  
Baby Ive got your number and I remember your name  
And Ive got a feelin I know why you came  
  
Chorus  
So lets get in some good trouble tonight  
Get ourselves in deep  
We can stay awake and dance all night  
We can always sleep  
Dont let them tell you its a mortal sin  
Cause I know its alright  
And if your mama asks you where youve been  
Youve been in some good trouble all night  
  
Ill be here again next year and there youll be again  
And Ill barely know half the places Ive been  
But I can almost remember so it was almost real  
I never know how Im going to feel  
  
Chorus  
  
Good trouble all night  
Good troubles all right
