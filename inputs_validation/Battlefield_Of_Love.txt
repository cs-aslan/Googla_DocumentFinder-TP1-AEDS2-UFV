I am a soldier  
A casualty of love  
Ive been from heaven  
All the way to hell  
Ive had a journey  
Much more than I can tell  
Ive got stories  
Much more than I can sell  
  
All this mass confusion  
Causes chaos in my brain  
Im on the battlefield  
The battlefield of love  
With all of the illusions  
I wont ever be the same  
Im on the battlefield  
The battlefield of love  
  
Im a prisoner  
A prisoner of love  
I have been captured  
And kept underground  
I have been tortured  
But I dont make a sound  
Cause I know one day  
One day I will be found  
  
All this mass confusion  
Causes chaos in my brain  
Im on the battlefield  
The battlefield of love  
With all of the illusions  
I wont ever be the same  
Im on the battlefield  
The battlefield of love
