I dont care what they say  
I wont stay in a world without love  
  
Please lock me away  
And dont allow the day  
Here inside where I hide with my loneliness  
I dont care what they say I wont stay  
In a world without love  
  
Birds sing out of tune  
And rain clouds hide the moon  
Im ok here I stay with my loneliness  
I dont care what they say I wont stay  
In a world without love  
  
So I wait and in a while  
I will see my true love smile  
She may come I know not when  
When she does Ill lose  
So baby until then  
  
Lock me away  
And dont allow the day  
Here inside where I hide with my loneliness  
I dont care what they say I wont stay  
In a world without love  
  
Please lock me away  
And dont allow the day  
Here inside where I hide with my loneliness  
I dont care what they say I wont stay  
In a world without love  
  
So I wait and in a while  
I will see my true love smile  
She may come I know not when  
When she does Ill lose  
So baby until then  
  
Lock me away  
And dont allow the day  
Here inside where I hide with my loneliness  
I dont care what they say I wont stay  
In a world without love  
  
I dont care what they say I wont stay  
In a world without love forget him
