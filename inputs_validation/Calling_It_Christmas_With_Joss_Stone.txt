On a hill long ago on a cold winters night  
In a land far away three kings saw a light  
And from heaven it shone like Gods Gods own crown  
And it guided three kings into Bethlehem town  
  
Oh they came bearing gifts and so said each one  
Lets call this day Christmas from this moment on  
Well be calling it Christmas in honor of him  
The child in the manger or savior and king  
  
Weve been calling it Christmas keeping the faith  
Knowing the reason were saving the day  
Weve been calling it Christmas down through the years  
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here  
  
Oh a simple belief was the start of it all  
A small child asleep on a bed made of straw  
Unverified where shepherds and kings  
First Unverified this moment would bring  
  
Weve been calling it Christmas keeping the faith  
Knowing the reason were saving the day  
Weve been calling it Christmas down through the years  
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here  
  
Weve been calling it Christmas keeping the faith  
Knowing the reason were saving the day  
Weve been calling it Christmas down through the years  
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here  
  
Weve been calling it Christmas down through the years  
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here  
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here  
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here
