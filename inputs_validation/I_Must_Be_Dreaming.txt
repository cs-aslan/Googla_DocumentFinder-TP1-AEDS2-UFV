I must be dreaming  
I must be dreaming  
I must be dreaming  
I must be because  
  
You say you love me  
You say you want me  
You say you need me  
And I cant believe that  
  
Someone as wonderful as you  
Could change my luck  
And make my dreams come true  
  
I must be dreaming  
But if Im dreaming  
Ill go on dreaming  
The rest of my life  
Dreaming of you  
  
I must be dreaming  
But if Im dreaming  
Ill go on dreaming  
The rest of my life  
Dreaming of you
