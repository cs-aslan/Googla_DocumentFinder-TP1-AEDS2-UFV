Know no fear Ill still be here tomorrow  
Bend my ear Im not gonna go away  
You are love so why do you shed a tear  
Know no fear you will see heaven from here  
  
Ill shelter you make it alright to cry  
And youll help too cos the faith in myself  
Has run dry  
We are love and I just wanna hold you near  
Know no fear we will see heaven from here  
  
I see real love in your eyes  
And it fills me up when you start to cry  
  
I just wanna hold you near  
We will see heaven from here  
  
Well it all seems out of reach  
I will take the blame if it keeps the peace  
My shelf lifes short  
Wish theyd make it more easy to follow  
And Ive been caught with nothing but  
Love on my mind  
We are love dont let it fall on deaf ears  
Now its clear we have seen heaven from here
