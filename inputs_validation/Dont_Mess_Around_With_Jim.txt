Well uptown got its hustlers  
And the Bowery got its bums  
42nd Street got Big Jim Walker  
Hes a pool shootin son of a gun  
  
Yeah hes big and dumb as a man can come  
Hes stronger than a country horse  
And when the bad folks all get together at night  
They all call Big Jim Boss  
  
Just because yeah they say you dont tug on Supermans cape  
You dont spit into the wind  
You dont pull the mask off the ol lone ranger  
And you dont mess around with Jim oh no  
  
From the south of Alabama come a country boy  
He said Im looking for a man named Jim  
Now I am a pool shootin boy my name is Willie Mccoy  
Down home folks call me Slim  
  
Im lookin for the man on 42nd Street  
Hes drivin some drop top Cadillac  
And I know it sounds funny  
That he took all my money  
Now I come to get my money back  
  
Everybody say Jack  
And they say You dont tug on Supermans cape  
You dont spit into the wind  
You dont pull the mask off the Ole Lone Ranger  
And you dont mess around with Jim  
  
A hush fell over the pool room  
As Jimmy walked in off the street  
And when the cutting was done  
The only part that wasnt bloody  
Was the souls of the big mans feet  
  
He was cut in a million places  
And was shot in a couple more  
And you better believe  
They told a different kinda story  
When Big Jim hit the floor  
  
And they say You dont tug on Supermans cape  
You dont spit into the wind  
You dont pull the mask off the Ole Lone Ranger  
And you dont mess around with Slim  
  
You dont tug on Supermans cape  
You dont spit into the wind  
You dont pull the mask off the Ole Lone Ranger  
And you dont mess around with Slim  
  
You dont tug on Supermans cape  
You dont spit into the wind  
You dont pull the mask off the Ole Lone Ranger  
And you dont mess around with Slim
