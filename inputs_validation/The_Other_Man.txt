An urgent call in the dead of night  
A voice that whispers Now  
A voice that trembles like a winter leaf  
Before it hits the ground  
She leaves a crack in the bedroom door  
To slip the wire through  
Her husband sleeping in a empty bed  
No witness to the truth  
  
Its a oneway conversation  
I try to tell her no  
But its a hopeless situation  
I just cant let her go  
And here she is another desperate night  
In the arms of the other man  
Another day in a double life  
Every moment that she holds me tight  
I know just where I stand  
As I am the other man  
  
She leaves my room like a criminal  
To beat the morning light  
Rehearsing ever little alibi  
To get it water tight  
  
Theres a note on the dresser top  
Its the same old classic line  
She says shes leaving him  
Its just a question of time  
Its a no win situation  
  
Cause I just cant let her go  
And here she is another desperate night  
In the arms of the other man  
Another day in a double life  
Every moment that she holds me tight  
I know just where I stand  
  
As I am the other man Repeat x4
