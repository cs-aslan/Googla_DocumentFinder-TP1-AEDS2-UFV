Shes my kind of rain  
Like love in a drunken sky  
Shes confetti falling down all night  
She sits quietly there  
Black water in a jar Says baby why you trembling like you are  
  
So I wait  
And I try  
I confess like a child  
  
Chorus  
Shes my kind of rain  
Like love from a drunken sky  
Confetti falling down all night  
Shes my kind of rain  
  
Shes the sunsets shadow  
Shes like Rembrandts light  
Shes the history thats made at night  
Shes my lost companion  
Shes my dreamin tree  
Together in this brief eternity  
  
Summer days  
Winter snow  
Shes all things to behold  
  
Chorus  
  
So I wait  
And I try  
I confess all my crimes  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X  
  
Shes my kind of rain  
Ohhhhh rain on me  
Shes my kind of rain
