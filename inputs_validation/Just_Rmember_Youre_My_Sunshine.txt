Just remember youre my sunshine  
When Im with you I dont feel any pain  
Just remember that I love you  
Even if I cannot be your man  
Im not leaving you forever  
But I got business farther down the line  
You got your troubles baby  
I got mine  
  
Hold on everything will be alright  
Hold on I got to have a little more time  
Hold on and together we will find  
All the answers all we need is time now  
  
Just remember that I love you  
When you got no one to hold your hand  
Yes you know Ill be back home  
Just as soon just as soon as I can  
  
Hold on everything will be alright  
Hold on I got to have a little more time  
Hold on and together we will find  
All the answers all we need is time now
