My dusty feet have kicked the stones  
Between a thousand railroad ties  
From Boston down to New Orleans  
I left the girls a cryin  
But Ive still got some ramblin in me  
Got some miles left on my shoes  
And before I take a job again  
Ill have to be lowdown  
Cryin the blues  
So its goodbye baby the whistle is a blowin  
If I miss the train Ill have to stay around  
But as long as those railroad tracks go on unending  
Ill be off to another day in another town  
  
You say youd like to ramble with me  
This aint no life for a girl  
Too many people out to get you in a hobos world  
And it gets mighty cold when youre on the road  
Cause a boxcar never was a home  
But you could join me if you want  
Im gettin mighty tired of bein alone  
So its goodbye baby the whistle is a blowin  
If we miss the train well have to stay around  
But as long as those railroad tracks go on unending  
Well be off to another day in another town  
  
But as long as those railroad tracks go on unending  
Well be off to another day in another town  
Well be off to another day in another town
