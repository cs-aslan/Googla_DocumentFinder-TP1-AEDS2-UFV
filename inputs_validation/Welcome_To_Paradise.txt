Sour milk in the saucer  
And the cat wont come home  
And sometimes New York City  
Feels like burnin Rome  
Im lost and Im crazy  
Too much time on my own  
Id give anything to find a heart  
That cant be sold  
Welcome to paradise  
Here is my brave new world  
And in my paradise  
Im waiting for a certain girl  
Dead flowers in the darkness  
Red rose wrapped in lace  
Icecold vodka tears  
Stainin my face  
My hearts growin colder  
And the things I have seen  
Wont someone come and get me  
Wake me from this dream  
Welcome to paradise  
Here is my brave new world  
And in my paradise  
Im waiting for a special girl  
Here in my paradise  
Im waitin for something new  
And here in my brave new world  
Im waitin for something new  
I can hear church bells ringing  
White rice hits blue skies  
And the blind still lead the blind  
As they look for paradise  
Oh yeah  
Paradise  
Welcome to paradise  
Here is my brave new world  
And here in my paradise  
Im waiting for a special girl  
Im still looking for paradise  
In your eyes you seem so far away  
And to find paradise  
Theres no price that I wont pay  
We all find paradise  
Im still looking for paradise tonight  
We all find paradise  
And I wont find paradise  
Ill make it all right  
We all find paradise  
With you and I  
Comes into sight  
We all find paradise  
For you and I  
For you and I  
Paradise could be right  
We all find paradise  
Im still looking for paradise tonight  
We all find paradise  
And I wont find paradise  
Ill make it all right  
We all find paradise
