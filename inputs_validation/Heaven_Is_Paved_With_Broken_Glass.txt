Heaven is paved with broken glass  
Since your hammer struck my heart  
This world a hell of trees and grass  
All is wrong like north gone south  
Theres a bad taste in my mouth  
  
Everything was stars  
Til you had a notion to leave  
Beauty marks turned to scars  
Bet you had a laugh up your sleeve  
  
Congratulations love love love love  
You made a fool of me and physics  
  
Heaven is paved with broken glass  
Since your hammer struck my heart  
This world a hell of trees and grass  
All is wrong like north gone south  
Theres a bad taste in my mouth  
  
Everything was gold  
Til you thought you were above me  
Soldier turns to rogue  
Pretty turns to pretty ugly  
  
Congratulations love love love love  
You made a fool of me and physics  
  
And Im feeling cheated  
And Im feeling used  
And whats even worse is  
You just look amused  
  
Heaven is paved with broken glass  
Since your hammer struck my heart  
This world a hell of trees and grass  
Since your hammer struck my heart  
  
Heaven is paved with broken glass
