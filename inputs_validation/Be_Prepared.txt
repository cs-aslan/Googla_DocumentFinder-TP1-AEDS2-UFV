Be prepared Thats the Boy Scouts marching song  
Be prepared As through life you march along  
Be prepared to hold your liquor pretty well  
Dont write naughty words on walls if you cant spell  
  
Be prepared To hide that pack of cigarettes  
Dont make book if you cannot cover bets  
Keep those reefers hidden where youre sure  
That they will not be found  
And be careful not to smoke them  
When the scoutmasters around  
For he only will insist that it be shared  
Be prepared  
  
Be prepared Thats the Boy Scouts solemn creed  
Be prepared And be clean in word and deed  
Dont solicit for your sister thats not nice  
Unless you get a good percentage of her price  
  
Be prepared And be careful not to do  
Your good deeds when theres no one watching you  
If youre looking for adventure of a  
new and different kind  
And you come across a Girl Scout who is  
similarly inclined  
Dont be nervous dont be flustered dont be scared  
Be prepared
