Sparkle on the ocean  
Eagle at the top of a tree  
Those crazy crows always making a commotion  
This land is home to me  
  
I was talking to my neighbor  
He said When I get to heaven if it is not like this  
Ill just hop a cloud and Im coming right back down here  
Back to this heavenly bliss  
  
You see those lovely hills  
They wont be there for long  
Theyre gonna tear em down  
And sell them to California  
Here come the toxic spills  
Miners poking all around  
When this place looks like a moonscape  
Dont say I didnt warn ya  
  
Money money money  
Money makes the trees come down  
It makes mountains into molehills  
Big money kicks the wide wide world around  
  
Black bear in the orchard  
At night hes in my garbage cans  
Hes getting so bold but no one wants to shoot him  
Hes got a right to roam this land  
  
I feel like Geronimo  
I used to be as trusting as Cochise  
But the white eyes lies  
Hes out of whack with nature  
And look how far his weapons reach  
  
Spirit of the water  
Give us all the courage and the grace  
To make genius of this tragedy unfolding  
The genius to save this place
