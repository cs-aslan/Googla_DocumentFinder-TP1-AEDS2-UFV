They were the sweetest words Id ever heard  
My heart could barely take it in  
Like water offered to the lips  
Of a tired and thirsty man  
  
cause its a tangled web of woven  
I dont know all the reasons  
But it amazes me to wake up  
To your mercy every morning  
  
So Im standing here spinning around  
In the fields of freedom  
And Im still alive and reaching out  
And I can feel the healing  
  
cause you say  
Come on out come on out  
Come on out come on out  
Out in the open  
Come on out come on out  
Come on out come onout  
Into the light  
There is no jury  
There is no judge  
Ready and waiting  
Are the steady arms of love 124  
  
For the sake of never making waves I  
Kept my secrets to myself  
And no one ever really knew the  
Darker shadows of my heart  
  
But I will be a witness  
That theres nothing in me dark enough  
The power of forgiveness  
Cannot resuce from the deep  
  
So Im standing here spinning around  
In the fields of freedom  
And Im still alive and reaching out  
And I can feel the healing  
  
And you say  
Come on out come out  
Come on out come out  
Out in the open  
Come on out come on out  
Come on out come on out  
Into the light  
There is no jury  
There is no judge  
Ready and waiting  
Are a steady arms of love 240

Out in the open
