The evening sun is falling that old blue moon is calling  
My guardian angel in the sky came through  
To help all my dreams come true theres a new star  
Theres a new star coming tonight theres a new love burning  
So bright for a new star of love is born between the earth and sky  
For you and I  
  
Theres a new star  
The moon was dull the sky was cold and gray  
There were no stars to light my lonely way  
And then I traced the lovelight in your eyes  
To a new star twinkling in the sky burning bright day and night  
Now Im alright now were together lovers forever  
A new star a new star to light our way  
Theres a new star burning for us theres a new world turning for us  
Theres a new star sparkling in the sky  
  
Theres a new star shining somewhere and we know the reason why  
Theres a new star way up there for a true love  
A new star for our love will never die
