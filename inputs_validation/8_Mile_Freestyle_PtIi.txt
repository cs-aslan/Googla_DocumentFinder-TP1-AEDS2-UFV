Spoken  
Yo its time to get rid of this coward once and for all

This shit is a horror flick  
But the black guy doesnt die in this movie  
Fuckin wit Lotto dawg you gotta be kiddin  
That makes me believe you really dont have a interest in livin  
You think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say

Or some real shit though I like you  
Thats why I didnt wanna have to be the one you commit sucide to

I feel bad I gotta murder that dude from Leave It To Beaver  
I used to like that show now you got me to fight back mode  
But oh well if you gotta go then you gotta go

Pay attention youre sayin the same shit that he said  
Matter fact dog heres a pencil  
Go home write some shit make it suspenseful  
And dont come back until something dope hits you
