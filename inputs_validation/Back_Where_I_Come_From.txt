Well in the town where I was raised  
The clock ticks and the cattle graze  
Time passed with amazing grace  
Back where I come from  
  
You can lie on a riverbank  
Or paint your name on a water tank  
Or miscount all the beers you drank  
Back where I come from  
  
Back where I come from  
Is where when its said and done  
And Im proud as anyone  
Thats where I come from  
  
We learned in Sunday school  
Who made the sun through  
I know who made the moonshine too  
Back where I come from  
  
Blue eyes on a Saturday night  
Tan legs in the broad daylight  
TVs they were black and white  
Back where I come from  
  
Back where I come from  
Is where when its said and done  
And Im proud as anyone  
Thats where I come from  
  
Some say its a backward place  
Narrow minds on a narrow wage  
But I make it a point to say  
Thats where I come from  
  
Thats where I come from  
Where Ill be when its said and done  
And Im proud as anyone  
Thats where I come from  
  
Back where I come from  
Im an old Tennessean  
And Im proud as anyone  
Thats were I come from
