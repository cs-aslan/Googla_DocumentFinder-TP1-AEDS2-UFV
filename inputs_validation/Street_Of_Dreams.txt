I heard the sound of voices in the night  
Spellbound there was someone calling  
I looked around no one was in sight  
Pulled down I just kept on falling  
  
Ive seen this place before  
You were standing by my side  
Ive seen your face before tonight  
Maybe I just see what I want it to be  
  
I know its a mystery  
Do you remember me on a street of dreams  
Running through my memory  
On the street of dreams  
  
There you stood a distant memory  
So good like we never parted  
Said to myself I knew youd set me free  
And here we are right back where we started  
  
Somethings come over me  
And I dont know what to feel  
Maybe this fantasy is real  
Now I know I see what I want it to be  
  
But its still a mystery  
Do you remember me on the street of dreams  
Running through my memory  
On the street of dreams  
  
You are on every face I see  
On the street of dreams  
Tell me have you always been  
On the street of dreams  
  
Will we ever meet again my friend  
Do you know just what it meant to be  
On the street of dreams  
Never know just who youll see do ya  
  
On the street of dreams  
You can be who you want to be oh yeah  
I can hear you calling me  
I can feel you haunting me  
  
Haunting me
