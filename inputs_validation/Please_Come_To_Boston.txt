Please come to Boston  
For the springtime  
Im stayin here with some friends  
And theyve got lots of room  
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk  
By a cafe where I hope to be workin soon  
Please come to Boston  
She said no boy you come home to me  
  
Chorus  
And She said hey ramblin boy  
Why dont you settle down  
Boston Denver L A aint your kind of town  
There aint no gold  
And there aint nobody like me  
Im the number one fan  
Of the band from Tennessee  
  
Please come to Denver  
To see the snowfall  
Well move up into the mountains  
So far we cant be found  
And throw I love you echos  
Down the canyons  
And then lie awake at night  
Until they come back around  
Please come to Denver  
She said no boy you come home to me  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Now that drifters world  
Goes round and round  
And I doubt if its ever gonna stop  
But of all the dreams  
Hes lost or found  
And all that I aint got  
I need somebody I can cling to  
Somebody he can sing to  
  
He said please come to L A  
To live forever  
A California life alone  
Is just too hard to build  
I live in a house that  
Looks out over the ocean  
And theres some stars  
That fell from the sky  
Livin up on the hill  
Please come to L A  
I just said no  
Boy you come home to me  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Im the number one fan  
Of the band from Tennessee  
Tennessee
