So many techheads  
Recent invasion  
I stretch out my long legs  
And I kick away the mouse pad baby  
  
Amazon eBay Oracle he say  
He promise a freebee  
But hes such a pokey little guy  
Wait I hear big footsteps  
  
Thud thumping out of the past  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
Cyberman lights up  
  
But mostly he floppy  
Computer man crashes  
Hes so humpty dumpty baby  
Now he tries this experiment  
  
Though he knows its so lowtech  
He tries patting his forehead  
While hes rub rub rubbing my stomach baby  
But he cant do it can he  
  
No no he cant do that at all  
But wait I hear big footsteps  
Thud thumbing out of the past  
Sure enough that big dumb guy  
  
Is here at last  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
Big papa bear  
Maybe you can remember  
  
It wasnt that long ago  
When you dialed a number  
You got a living breathing human being  
On the telephone  
  
Dont want nothing to do  
But just study the skin on your face  
I want to look up at the sky  
And watch the sunset  
  
With someone like you  
Wait I hear big footsteps  
Thud thumbing out of the past  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
That big dumb guy is here hes here  
In fact hes brought his  
Big raccoon coat with him  
  
And he doesnt even know its  
Politically incorrect  
That big dumb guy is here at last  
I see him now walking torward me  
  
Lets get it on with your big bad self  
Get it on babe Get it on babe  
Get it on babe Get it on babe  
That big dumb guy is here at last

Big dumb guy  
Oh ha  smartest guy

Kiss me kiss me kiss me  
Kiss me kiss me now  
If feels so good  
I dont want to have to go into those chat rooms anymore  
  
I dont want to see that pinwheel go round  
And around and around  
Every time I try to open any window  
Hold me you big dumb guy  
You smart guy
