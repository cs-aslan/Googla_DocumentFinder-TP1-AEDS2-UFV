timmy tappan don roth  
  
Smiles not a smile until it wrinkles your face  
Bells not a bell without ringing  
A homes not a home when theres nobody there  
A songs not a song without singing  
  
Chorus  
Love isnt love till you give it away  
Love isnt love till its free  
The love in your heart  
Wasnt put there to stay  
Oh love isnt love till you give it away  
  
You might think love is a treasure to keep  
Feeling to cherish and hold  
But love is a treasure for people to share  
You keep it by letting it go  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Cause love cant survive  
When its hidden inside  
And love was meant to be shared  
  
Repeat chorus
