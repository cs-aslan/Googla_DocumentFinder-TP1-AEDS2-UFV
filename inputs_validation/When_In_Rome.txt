Well I see you in the morning  
Putting on your pretty clothes  
And I watch you do your makeup  
Like they do in all those fashion shows  
Then you turn to me so that I can see  
If you put yourself together right  
Then you go away and youre gone all day  
But I know youre coming home tonight  
And when youre home  
Darling all youve got to be is you  
But when in Rome do as the Romans do  
  
Well its alright if youre tired  
When your day is done  
You can see when you look at me  
Youre not the only one  
Its a cold cruel world for a working girl  
But you cant let them see you cry  
Its a fact of life now man and wife  
Work full time to just get by  
And when were home all  
Its gonna be is me and you  
But when in Rome do as the Romans do  
  
Ive done some strange things I  
Never thought Id do before  
But if the strain brings happiness  
More or less  
More or less  
  
Then I dont mind masquerading  
With all those other fools  
I dont mind the games Im playing  
Because Ive learned the rules  
And when times are tough Ive got just enough  
If youre standing right by my side  
Darling more and more I get hungry for  
All the ways you keep me satisfied  
On our own there aint nothing  
That we cant get through  
But when in Rome do as the Romans do  
  
Then I dont mind masquerading with all those other fools  
I dont mind the games Im playing  
Because Ive learned the rules  
It doesnt matter when were home all alone  
All weve got to be is me and you  
On our own there aint nothing  
That we cant get through  
But when in Rome do as the Romans do  
  
Swing that hammer and break that stone  
Push those buttons and answer that phone  
Coffee in the morning and martinis at night  
Everybodys working up a big appetite  
Do as the Romans do
