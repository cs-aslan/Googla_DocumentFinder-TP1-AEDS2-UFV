Johnnys always running around trying to find certainty  
He needs all the world to confirm that he aint lonely  
Mary counts the walls  
Knows he tires easily  
  
Johnny thinks the world would be right if it would buy truth for him  
Mary says he changes his mind more than a woman  
But she made her bed  
Even when the chance was slim  
  
Johnny says hes willing to learn when he decides hes a fool  
Johnny says hell live anywhere when he has time to  
Mary combs her hair  
Says he should be used to it  
  
Mary always hedges her bets she never knows what to think  
She says hes still acting like hes being discovered  
Scared that hell be caught  
Without a second thought  
  
Johnny feels hes wasting his breath trying to talk sense to her  
Mary says hes lacking a real sense of proportion  
So she combs her hair  
Knows he tires easily  
  
Johnnys always running around trying to find certainty  
He needs all the world to confirm that he aint lonely  
Mary counts the walls  
Says he should be used to it
