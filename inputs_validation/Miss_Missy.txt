Theres a band playing down the street we could see yeah  
Movie showing down at the Von Lee  
A church supper with Grandma and Grandad  
Lets go out and have ourselves the best time weve ever had  
  
Chorus  
Say goodnight my Miss Missy  
Goodnight its time to go home  
Hey I might call you later  
Oh Missy girl its late its time to go home  
  
Weight of the worlds now on your head  
I take back all those mean things I said  
Little baby kicking down in your gut  
I hope it doesnt grow up to be as crazy as us  
  
Chorus  
  
So lets dance slow just one more time  
Let me hold your face close to mine yeah  
Lets pretend that Jesus has come  
To take us out just one more night for fun  
  
Chorus
