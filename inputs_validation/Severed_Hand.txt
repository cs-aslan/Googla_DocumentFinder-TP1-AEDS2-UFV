Big man stands behind an open door  
Said leave your lady on the cement floor  
Got some kicks want to take a ride  
I said yeah  
Take your pick leave yourself behind  
I said yeah  
  
Ive no fear but for falling down  
So look out below I am falling now  
Oh please understand I just need my friend  
A way a way a way home  
  
Tried to walk found a severed hand  
Recognized it by the wedding band  
  
Said its ok do you want some more  
I said yeah  
Said youll see dragons after three or four  
I said yeah  
  
Under stand Im not falling down  
I said look around the rooms taller now  
I cant close my eyes  
Cause I see the sound in waves  
In wave lets me stay calm  
  
If I dont lose control  
Explore and not explode  
A preternatural other plane  
With the power to maintain  
  
Like a tear in all we know  
Once dissolved we are free to grow  
What is human what is more  
Ill answer this when I get home
