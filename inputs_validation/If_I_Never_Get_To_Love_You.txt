If I never get to love you  
It wont be that I didnt try  
Ill be trying to possess you  
Till the day I die  
  
If I never get to love you  
It wont be that I ran away  
For as long as you will have me  
Close to you Ill stay  
  
What I wouldnt give to hold you tight  
Never never let you out of sight  
Be the one you give your first kiss every morning  
The last one you kiss goodnight  
  
If I never get to love you  
It wont be that I didnt care  
There is nothing that I want more  
Or I need more  
  
And my heart would surely break in two  
If I never get to love you  
What I wouldnt give to hold you tight  
Never never let you out of sight  
  
Be the one you give your first kiss every morning  
The last one you kiss goodnight  
If I never get to love you  
It wont be that I didnt care  
  
There is nothing that I want more  
Or I need more  
And my heart could surely break in two  
If I never get to love you
