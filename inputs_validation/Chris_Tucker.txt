Verse 1 J Cole  
I cant control this urge to fuck hoes and splurge  
My sidepieces got real jobs nigga I dont fuck with no birds  
My main chick she got real hair aint never got to go shop for hers  
Got a neat freak that dont eat meat but goddamn she rocking them furs  
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna find me now the ho wanna climb me  
If real recognize real thats why it took a motherfucker like Hov to sign me  
Ball so hard Im the truth nigga AllStar game catching oops nigga  
If you a bitch and Im a bitch Im Sheryl Swoopes and you hoops nigga

Verse 2 J Cole  
Cole world safe to say Im cold blooded  
In this cold life the more cold you are seem like the more the hoes love you  
So I book a flight she land today she leave tonight with no luggage  
Got the camera on in my bedroom shooting video with no bucket  
Only nigga up in first class old lady tryna be friendly ay  
She think Im in the nba why a nigga cant have his mba  
Next time Imma flip the script you know kick some shit thats gon shock her  
You so tall what team do u play for No bitch Im a doctor  
Flow hella proper Cole never flopped nah  
Float like a propeller no helicopter shit  
Not stick like a bowlegged chick  
Stick dick to a gold digger wont give her dollar  
Fuck your nine Im a whole different caliber  
Nigga say they pop cause they dont fill they collars up  
Read a book get your knowledge up book a flight get ya mileage up  
Bitch nigga

Verse 3 2 Chainz  
Imma start off with these four bars  
Im in a barbie at a sports bar  
Im rockin gold balls whip your ass with this crowbar  
Im like Oh Boy catch your girl off that rebound  
Fix her hair up get her a redo  
Just my car out that paint shop so I guess thats a mothafuckin recoupe  
Let me demonstrate gotta think about it before I go on a dinner date  
Might eat a rich bitch yes I got me expensive taste  
Got my pockets on full stomach on full gun on full I got full coverage  
Niggas dont know the full story Im smokin on gas full service  
Money talk true story if you dont got none then dont say shit  
Banana clips going ape shit if you dont make money you dont make sense  
I got gold on my bracelet got ya girlfriend chasing it  
Bust a nut in her mouth so now she can baby sit  
  
Hook  
  
Outro J Cole  
This liquor Ive been sippin got me kissing all these models  
And I might not see tomorrow I might not see tomorrow

Just to pay back all these loans man we gon have to hit the lotto
