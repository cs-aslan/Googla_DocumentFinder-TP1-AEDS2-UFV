When I heard the knock on the door  
I couldnt catch my breath  
Is it too late to call this off  
  
We could slip away wouldnt that be better  
Me with nothing to say and you in your autumn sweater  
  
I tried my best to hide  
In a crowded room its nearly possible  
I wait for you oh most patiently  
  
So I looked for your eyes  
And the waves looked like theyd pour right out of them  
Ill try hard Ill try always  
But its a waste of time  
Its a waste of time if I cant smile easily  
Like in the beginning  
In the beginning
