What is it that turns you on to the illusion of power  
This thing that grabs you by the heart and makes you want to tear things down  
There is no reason why I should need all this power but if you cross me now  
Im gonna tear your whole world down  
  
The illusion of power things I feel seem so real  
The illusion of power  
  
I can get the emotional thing straight in my head  
Everything I love dies to soon or is already dead  
Dont stand too close I spit and breath fire  
Anything Ive got now you cannot desire  
  
You want to be my friend I promise you nothing  
Nothing I can give you nothing I can do for you  
Im being chased by the sins of my past and its killing me now  
Killing me now  
  
The illusion of power things I feel seem so real  
The illusion of power  
The illusion of power its already set signed and sealed  
The illusion of power  
  
Powerful who are you fooling  
Youre caught in a complex cataclysm of your own inadequacies  
And pitiful weaknesses  
Your souls secretes insecurity  
So you live on the reflection side of the mirror  
Youre terrified of true poweryou fear me  
  
I can tell you stories of my  
Shaded past and I can  
Drag you down into the  
Depths of my soul  
  
The illusion of power things I feel seem so real  
The illusion of power  
The illusion of power its already set signed and sealed  
The illusion of power  
  
Why dont you come closer Promise a story I will tell yeah  
Ill save you from your dreams yeah  
Ill save you from your dreams
