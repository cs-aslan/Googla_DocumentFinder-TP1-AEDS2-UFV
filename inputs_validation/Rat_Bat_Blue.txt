Hey baby what you gonna do  
When the lights go up on you  
Whats your name can I drive you home  
Sweet woman are you all alone  
Youre the one for me  
Im gonna keep you busy as a bee could bee could be  
Rat bat blue  
  
Now get up woman dont be slow  
Its getting late and I wanna go  
No cause for acting big  
Got to love got to live  
Stick around me  
Im gonna show you things you never thought youd see you see  
Rat bat blue  
Youre so fine  
  
Get out You didnt understand  
Im a hard loving man  
No way you can satisfy  
The way you look the way you lie  
And when you shut the door  
Make sure I dont see you round here no more  
Rat bat blue  
Alright
