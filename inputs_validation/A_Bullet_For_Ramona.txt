Oh today I shot Ramona Ma  
She aint gonna cheat on me  
Two years Ive been searchin for her  
Two years shes been free  
  
Well I found her in a dance hall in Laredo  
And she told me that she wanted only me  
And I held her in my arms the way I used to  
But when morning came she begged me to set her free  
  
Oh today I shot Ramona Ma  
She aint gonna cheat on me  
Two years Ive been searchin for her  
Two years shes been free  
  
Well I tried and tried to ride away and leave her  
With my head hung low teardrops filled my eye  
I rode back to town and found her with a drifter  
And I knew right then Ramona had to die  
  
Oh today I shot Ramona Ma  
She aint gonna cheat on me  
Two years Ive been searchin for her  
Two years shes been free  
  
Well Im writing you this letter from Laredo  
And tonight Ill ride across the Rio Grande  
If I never live to see another sunrise  
You know I loved her  
Ma I hope you understand  
  
Oh today I shot Ramona Ma  
She aint gonna cheat on me  
Two years Ive been searchin for her  
Two years shes been free  
  
Oh today I shot Ramona Ma  
She aint gonna cheat on me  
Two years Ive been searchin for her  
Two years shes been free
