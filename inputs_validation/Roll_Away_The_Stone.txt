Baby if you say you still care  
I follow you most anywhere  
Roll away the stone  
Roll away the stone  
And in the darkest night  
Ill keep you safe and alright  
Roll away the stone  
Roll away the stone  
Wont you roll away the stone  
Why be cold and so alone  
Wont you roll away the stone  
Dont you let it lie  
No matter if fools say we cant win  
I know Ill fall in love again  
Roll away the stone  
Roll away the stone  
So sing we still got a chance  
Baby for love and sweet romance  
Roll away the stone  
Roll away the stone  
Wont you roll away the stone  
Dont you let it die  
Just kick it away
