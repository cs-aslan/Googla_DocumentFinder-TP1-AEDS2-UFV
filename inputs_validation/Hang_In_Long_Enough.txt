The signs are getting clearer clearer than you need  
The writings on the wall for you to see  
  
You never thought youd ever get the taste  
You never thought that it could be this good  
Just tell me what you want and Ill find the key  
Reach out and touch its all yours  
  
If you hang in long enough youll do it  
Just hang in long enough  
  
Youre down on the ground or so you say  
Youd sell the hole in your pocket if you could find a way  
Dont ask me how I know you dont want to hear  
Its been a long hard road and the end is getting near  
  
You never thought youd ever get the chance  
You never thought your break would come along  
If you tell me what you want Ill find the key  
Just reach out and touch its all yours  
  
If you hang in  
  
They always say  
The best things in life are free  
But you want to have everything  
Well youre going to have to beg if you want it all  
  
So hang in long enough youll do it  
Hang in long enough  
  
Theyll let you out then pull you in  
Playing hell with your emotions  
Youll feel like giving in  
  
So just hang in long enough
