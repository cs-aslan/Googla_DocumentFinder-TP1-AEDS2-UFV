Will you hurt me more than the pain of sharing her  
With other lovers believers or deceivers  
Well the answer cant be found when Im alone  
So Rachel take me home and make me feel like a man  
  
I know I swore that Id be faithful  
But Rachel made me realize that happiness is something you cant share  
With Tom Dick or Harry the reason we got married  
Was to know when you were needed youd be there  
  
So now you know all about her  
Now you want to act like shes the reason youve been staying out at night  
But honey Ive been drinking and lately Ive been thinking  
The way that weve been lovin just aint right  
Will you hurt me more  
  
And the man you feel I aint half as real as the man I used to be  
Theyve took my pride and I had to fight to keep my sanity  
  
Under Rachels wings under Rachels wings  
Under Rachels wings under Rachels wings  
Under Rachels wings under Rachels wings
