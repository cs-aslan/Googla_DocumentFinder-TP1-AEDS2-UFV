Heaven knows that youre an evil child  
Drive me crazy drive me wild  
Get home from work I dont feel all right  
Go in your bedroom you just want to fight  
Moving in moving out baby you move my mind about  
Dont give me no reason dont give me no lies  
Come to take you home from school youve broken all the rules  
All I need is a bit of your love  
All I want is a bit of your love  
All I want is a part of you  
  
Heaven knows that youre an evil child  
Drive me crazy you drive me wild  
Get home form work I dont feel all right  
Go in your bedroom you just want to fight  
Movin in  movin out baby you move my mind about  
Dont give me no reason dont give me no lies  
Come to take you home from school youve brokin all the rules  
All I need is a bit of your love  
All I want is to hold you tight  
All I need is a part of you
