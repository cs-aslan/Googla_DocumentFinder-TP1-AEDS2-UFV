Words by robert sterling music by john mandeville  
Some think it all comes down to  
Fate and circumstance  
Life falls somewhere between  
Accident and chance  
Some seek solutions to the problems  
They face  
By hoping maybe someday somehow  
It will all fall in place  
We keep persisting  
Still something is missing  
chorus  
Without the love of jesus  
The stars wouldnt shine  
Rivers wouldnt run  
And hearts beat out of time  
Without the love of jesus  
Tell me where would we be  
Lost on a lonely sea  
Without the love of jesus  
Theres so much more to life than meets  
The naked eye  
Its no coincidence no matter how we try  
When we try to deny what we  
Dont understand  
Maybe thats when we fail to see gods  
Providential hand  
We keep persisting  
Still something is missing  
repeat chorus  
It shouldnt take us a miracle  
Before we finally see  
That jesus love is the only thing  
That we will ever need  
repeat chorus
