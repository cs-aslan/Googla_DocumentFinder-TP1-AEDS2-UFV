Falling farther with a flaming hand  
I knew the question but I lost the answers  
Ill hold the wall for all  
Ill hold it all for all  
As long as no one asks no questions  
  
I got the message  
And the message stood  
  
One Two three  
I got another got another  
One Two three  
I got another got another  
I got another hit that held me the last time  
Dont ya know what I mean boys  
One Two three  
I got another got another  
  
Falling fast but doing all I can  
I know the questions but I lost the answers  
I got the message and the message stood  
  
Lease the one who makes it  
Profit from the riddle  
Kill the one that breaks it  
Always in the middle  
Keep the dream alive  
with sleeping pills you shouldnt fiddle  
Lease the one that makes it  
Profit from the riddle  
  
I got the message but I lost the race  
I got the message but I lost the race
