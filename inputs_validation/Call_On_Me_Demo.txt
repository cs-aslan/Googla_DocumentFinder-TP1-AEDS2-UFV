Everyday seem like Sunday  
It must be something that I have done  
I saw you dancing in the peepshow  
That every episode is leading me on  
  
Im just another fool that youve got to humor  
Cant say I love you when its just a rumor  
  
But if none of your dreams come true  
You can call on me call on me  
Cause Ive seen dreams have a happy ending  
Disappearing on my tv and you can call on me  
You can call on me you can call on me you can call on me  
  
When I go home I watch the television  
I go to sleep I dream about the television  
I go to work I talk about the television  
I used to think that love is something that it isnt  
  
Sometimes I feel just like a human being  
Thats just something between you and me  
  
But if none of you dreams come true  
You can call on me call on me  
Cause Ive seen dreams have a happy ending  
Disappearing on my tv and you can call on me  
You can call on me you can call on me you can call on me
