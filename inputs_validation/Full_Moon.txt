Havent you noticed a kind of madness in my eyes  
Its only me dear in my midnight disguise  
Pay no attention if I crawl across the room  
Its just another full moon  
  
Dont be afraid of me when Im walking in my sleep  
Dont get alarmed dear when I start to crawl and creep  
Try not to listen when I mumble like a loon  
Its just another full moon  
Its just another full moon  
  
You see before you a truly broken man  
Cause when it gets to midnight I dont know who I am  
Full moons acallin and its put a curse on me  
And it will never set me free  
  
The full moons still up there  
Like a great white balloon  
The owls are acallin  
And theyre singin my tune  
The night keeps acallin  
I wish the day would come soon  
To get away from another full moon  
Here comes another full moon  
  
If your hands start shakin  
When night starts to fall  
If youre scared of the moonlight  
And the shadows on the wall  
If the face in the mirror  
Isnt you at all  
Its just another full moon  
Its just another full moon  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
Its just another full moon
