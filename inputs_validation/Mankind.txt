Going out with discogoing out like bacchanal

Using up my ListerineLike Ovaltine  
And youll beyoure dippin in your battleship  
For the latest tipfor the latest dream  
Its all just inadvertent imitation and I dont mean mine  
Its all across this nation  
If its just inadvertent simulation a pattern in all mankind  
Whats got the whole world fakin it  
If its just inadvertent imitation a pattern in all mankind  
Whats got the whole world fakin it
