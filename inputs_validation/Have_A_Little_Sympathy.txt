Have a little sympathy  
Wont you hurry home to me  
Baby baby baby please come back  
Put my little dream train back on the track  
  
I havent seen a sunny day  
Since the day that you went away  
Tears I cried for you would fill the deep blue sea  
  
Have a little sympathy for me  
Have a little sympathy  
Have a little sympathy  
  
Wont you hurry on home to me  
Baby baby baby please come back  
Put my little dream train back on the track  
Well I havent seen a sunny day  
  
Since the day that you went away  
Tears I cried for you would fill the deep blue sea  
Have a little sympathy for me  
Baby wont you hurry home  
  
Dinos waiting all alone  
Have a little sympathy
