Rockets launch us to outer space  
Far away from this human wasteland  
Were bringing heaven to other worlds  
Abandoning the home fires of our birth  
There are fools who believe we cant live here as one  
There are wise men who say it still can be done  
Chorus  
Im watching the world  
Im watching the change in power  
Im watching the world  
Are we building a future or just standing still  
We will harvest the fields of wheat  
For a promise of food to eat  
Forging plows to make swords for war  
We can stop this fighting and open the door  
Only fools could believe we cant live here as one  
Whos to say it cannot be done  
Chorus  
Who is watching this world  
Who is changing the balance of power  
Im watching the world  
Are we building a future or just standing still  
Vamp  
Watching the world  
Only fools would believe we cant live here as one  
Whos to say it cannot be done  
Chorus  
Watching the world  
Who is changing the balance of power  
Im watching the world  
Are we building a future or just standing still just standing still  
Watching the world  
Who is changing the balance of power  
Were watching the world  
Were building a future  
Were not standing still  
Im watching the world  
Who is changing the balance of power  
Im watching the world  
Were building a future  
Im not standing still  
Im watching this world  
Watching the world 7x
