Ive lead a lifetime fightin this land  
Workin for nothin with these dry callused hands  
Im a slave to the sun it aint cuttin me no slack  
Gets me beggin whenever I look back  
  
Aint no glory in this livin  
Aint no runnin from your sins  
I hope theres angels where Im goin  
Aint no angels where Ive been  
  
Three generations countin on me  
To work this farm keep it in the family  
Well Ive done all I can and its past becomin clear  
That I cant hold out much longer here  
  
Aint no glory in this livin  
Aint no runnin from your sins  
I hope theres angels where Im goin  
Aint no angels where Ive been  
  
Aint no glory in this livin  
Aint no runnin from your sins  
I hope theres angels where Im goin  
Aint no angels where Ive been  
Aint no angels where Ive been
