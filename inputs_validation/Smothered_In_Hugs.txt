In the summer that you came  
There was something eating everyone  
And the sunshine fund was low  
We couldnt greet you  
With a simple hello  
and the watchers of the flood  
Were busy in their chambers  
Making sure there was new blood  
To sustain their dying veins  
but I believed you  
No need for further questioning  
Im gonna leave with you  
You can teach me all you know  
Which way will we go now  
On our trip to taller windows  
I really dont know now  
I really dont know  
in the winter that you left  
There was business as usual  
With the same old fears and frustrations  
But the word got out  
It was really such a pity  
but the judges and the saints  
And the textbook committee  
Decided you should be left out  
Not even mentioned  
but I believed you  
No need for further questioning  
Im gonna leave with you  
You can teach me all you know  
Which way will we go now  
On our trip to taller windows  
I really dont know now  
I really dont know
