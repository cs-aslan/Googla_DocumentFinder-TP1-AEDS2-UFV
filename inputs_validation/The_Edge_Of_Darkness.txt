Ive looked into the heart of darkness  
Where the blood red journey ends  
When youve faced the heart of darkness  
Even your soul begins to bend  
  
For a week I have been waiting  
Still I am only in Saigon  
The walls move in a little closer  
I feel the jungle call me on  
  
Every minute I get weaker  
While in the jungle they grow strong  
What I wanted was a mission  
And for my sins they gave me one  
  
They brought it up just like room service  
Cause everyone gets what they want  
And when that mission was all over  
Id never want another one  
  
I know captain that youve done this work before  
Weve got a problem you can help us all Im sure  
The colonels gone rogue  
and his methods are unsound  
Youll take a PBR up river track him down  
  
Theres a conflict in every human heart  
And the temptation is to take it all too far  
In this war things get so confused  
But there are some things which can not be excused  
  
Hes acting like a god an insane lunatic  
Your mission exterminate with extreme prejudice  
The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow  
Here is the file and its all you need to know  
  
Here I am the knife in my hand  
And now I understand why the genius must die  
  
Now I stand alone in darkness  
With his blood upon my hands  
Where sat the warrior the poet  
Now lie the fragments of a man
