Lying in your arms  
So close together  
Didnt know just what I had  
Now I toss and turn  
Cause Im without you  
How Im missing you so bad  
  
Where was my head  
Where was my heart  
Now I cry alone in the dark  
  
Chorus  
I lie awake  
I drive myself crazy  
Drive myself crazy  
Thinking of you  
Made a mistake  
When I let you go baby  
I drive myself crazy  
Wanting you the way that I do  
Wanting you the way that I do  
  
I was such a fool  
I couldnt see it  
Just how good you were to me  
You confessed your love  
Undying devotion  
I confessed my need to be free  
  
And now Im left  
With all this pain  
Ive only got myself to blame  
  
Chorus  
  
Why didnt I know it  
How much I loved you baby  
Why couldnt I show it  
If I had only told you  
When I had the chance  
Oh I had the chance  
  
Chorus x2
