You were meant for me and there aint no two ways about it  
Even on my darkest days oh they couldnt make me doubt it  
Someday things are gonna be the way they were before  
When nobody wants your body anymore  
Leave me I dont worry darling youll be back  
Honey Im not bragging Im just statin facts  
The ocean always brings each piece of driftwood back to shore  
When nobody wants your body anymore  
  
I know they have you now sweetheart they dont know what they got  
Heaven is still heaven when the weather aint so hot  
When all is done that will be done youll knock upon my door  
When nobody wants your body anymore  
Leave me I dont worry  
Unless somebody wants my body before
