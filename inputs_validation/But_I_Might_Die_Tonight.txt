I dont want to work away  
Doing just what they all say  
Work hard boy and youll find  
One day youll have a job like mine  
  
Cause I know for sure  
Nobody should be that poor  
To say yes or sink low  
Because you happen to say so say so you say so  
  
I dont want to work away  
Doing just what they all say  
Work hard boy and youll find  
One day youll have a job like mine job like mine a job like mine  
  
Be wise look ahead  
Use your eyes he said  
Be straight think right  
But I might die tonight
