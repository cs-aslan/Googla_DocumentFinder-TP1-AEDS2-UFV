announcer ladies and gentleman  
miss velma kelly in an act of desperation  
  
velma kelly  
my sister and I had an act that couldnt flop  
my sister and I were headed straight for the top  
my sister and earned a thou a week at least oh yea  
but my sister is now unfortunately deceased  
I know its sad of course  
But a fact is still a fact  
and now all that remains is the remains  
of a perfect Double Act  
  
Watch this  
Now you have to imagine it with two people  
its swell with two people  
  
First Id  
Then shed  
then wed  
but I cant do it alone  
then shed  
then Id  
then wed  
but I cant do it alone  
  
Shed say whats your sister like  
Id say men  
shed say youre the cats meow  
then wed wow the crowd again  
  
When shed go  
Id go  
wed go  
  
Then those ding dong daddies started to roar  
whistled stomped stamped on the floor  
yelling screaming begging for more  
and wed say  
Ok fellas keep your socks on  
Cause you aint seen nothing yet  
  
instrumental  
  
But I simply cannot do it alone  
  
So whatd ya think huh  
Come on you can say  
  
roxie blows a raspberry  
  
velma  
I know youre right the first part is shit  
But the second part the second part is really nifty  
  
takes a deep breath ok  
  
Shed go  
Id go  
wed  
  
Then those twobit johnnys did it around  
to cheer the best attraction in town  
they nearly tore the balcony down  
and wed say ok boys were going home  
but before we go heres a few more partin shots  
and this this we did in perfect unison  
  
instrumental  
  
Now you see me going through it  
you make think theres nothing to it  
but I simply cannot do it Alonehold note
