When I first came to town people  
I was walking down Hasting Street  
Everybody was talkin about Henry Swing Club  
I decided to stop in there for awhile  
And man when I got there  
Yeah they were really havin a ball  
  
Well I feel so good  
I want to boogie I want to boogie I want to boogie  
Well to the break of day  
Say it again  
  
Well I feel so good  
I want to boogie I want to boogie I want to boogie  
Well to the break of day  
Alright  
  
When I was a young boy  
I was layin down one night  
And I heard ma and pa talkin  
I heard pa tell ma  
Hey come on let that boy boogiewoogie  
Cause you know its in him  
And its just got to come out
