If youre standing with your suitcase  
But you cant step on the train  
Everythings the way that you left it  
I still havent slept yet  
  
And if youre covering your face now  
But you just cant hide the pain  
Still setting two plates on the counter but eating without you  
  
If the truth is youre a liar  
Then just say that youre okay  
Im sleeping on your side of the bed  
Goin out of my head now  
  
And if youre out there tryna move on  
But something pulls you back again  
Im sitting here tryna persuade you like youre in the same room  
  
And I wish you could give me the cold shoulder  
And I wish you could still give me a hard time  
And I wish I could still wish it was over  
But even if wishing is a waste of time  
Even if I never cross your mind  
  
Ill leave the door on the latch  
If you ever come back if you ever come back  
Therell be a light in the hall and the key under the mat  
If you ever come back  
Therell be a smile on my face and the kettle on  
And it will be just like you were never gone  
Therell be a light in the hall and the key under the mat  
If you ever come back if you ever come back now  
Oh if you ever come back if you ever come back  
  
Now they say Im wasting my time  
Cause youre never comin home  
But they used to say the world was flat  
But how wrong was that now  
  
And by leavin my door open  
Im riskin everything I own  
Theres nothing I can lose in a breakin that you havent taken  
  
And I wish you could give me the cold shoulder  
And I wish you can still give me a hard time  
And I wish I could still wish it was over  
But even if wishing is a waste of time  
Even if I never cross your mind  
  
Ill leave the door on the latch  
If you ever come back if you ever come back  
Therell be a light in the hall and the key under the mat  
If you ever come back  
Therell be a smile on my face and the kettle on  
And it will be just like you were never gone  
Therell be a light in the hall and the key under the mat  
If you ever come back if you ever come back now  
Oh if you ever come back if you ever come back  
  
If its the fighting you remember or the little things you miss  
I know youre out there somewhere so just remember this  
If its the fighting you remember or the little things you miss  
Oh just remember this oh just remember this  
  
Ill leave the door on the latch  
If you ever come back if you ever come back  
Therell be a light in the hall and the key under the mat  
If you ever come back  
Therell be a smile on my face and the kettle on  
And it will be just like you were never gone  
Therell be a light in the hall and the key under the mat  
If you ever come back if you ever come back now  
Oh if you ever come back if you ever come back  
  
And it will be just like you were never gone  
And it will be just like you were never gone  
And it will be just like you were never gone  
If you ever come back if you ever come back now
