It must mean something  
When I close my eyes  
Visions of you come to me and flood my mind  
It must mean something  
When my heart is true  
All that I can think about is you  
  
Chorus  
Everywhere I go you find me  
Even when I run  
Im captured  
Im captured in you  
Everywhere your love surrounds me  
I cannot escape  
Im captured  
Im captured  
  
It must mean something  
When Im standing still  
Yours is the only voice I wanna hear  
It must mean something  
That Ive come this far  
Lifting up my hands and offering my heart  
  
Chorus  
  
You are the sky  
You are the sea  
You are the air I wanna breathe  
Youre everywhere  
Your love last forever  
And if I fall  
You wont let go  
You hold me when I cant hold on anymore  
You reach out and rescue me  
  
Chorus
