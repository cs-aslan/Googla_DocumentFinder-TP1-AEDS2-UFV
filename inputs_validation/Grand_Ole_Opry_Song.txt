Come and listen to my story if you will Im gonna tell  
About a gang of fellers from down at Nashville  
First Ill start with old Red Foley doin the Chattanooga Shoe  
We cant forget Hank Williams with them good old Lovesick Blues  
Its time for Roy Acuff to go to Memphis on his train  
With Minnie Pearl and Rod Brasfield and Lazy Jim Day  
Turn on all your radios I know that you will wait  
Hear Little Jimmy Dickens sing Take An Old Cold Tater And Wait  
Therell be guitars and fiddles Earl Scruggs and his banjo too  
Bill Monroe singing out them ole Kentucky Blues  
Ernest Tubbs number Two wrongs wont make a right  
At the Grand Ole Opry evry Saturday night  
There was Uncle Dave Macon his gold tooth and plughat  
Cowboy Copas singing Tragic Romance  
Signed Sealed and Delivered with Sam and Kirk McGee  
And the master of ceremony was Mr George D Hays  
There was Lonzo and Oscar apoppin bubble gum

At the Grand Ole Opry evry Saturday night  
You can talk about your singers in all kinds of way  
But none could sing the old songs like Bradley Kincaid  
With his old hound dog Guitar and the famous Blue Tail Fly  
Stringbean with Hank Snow and old fiddlin Chubby Wise  
Therell be guitars and fiddles Earl Scruggs and his banjo too  
Bill Monroe singin out them ole Kentucky Blues  
Ernest Tubbs number Two Wrongs Dont Make a right  
At the Grand Ole Opry evry Saturday night
