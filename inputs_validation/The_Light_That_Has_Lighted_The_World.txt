Ive heard how some people have said  
That Ive changed  
That Im not what I was  
How it really is a shame  
The thoughts in their heads  
Manifest on their brow  
Like bad scars from ill feelings  
They themselves arouse  
So hateful of anyone that is happy  
Or free  
They live all their lives  
Without looking to see  
The light that has lighted the world  
Its funny how people just wont  
Accept change  
As if nature itself  theyd prefer  
Rearranged  
So hard to move on  
When youre down in a hole  
Where theres so little chance  
To experience soul  
Im grateful to anyone  
That is happy or free  
For giving me hope  
While Im looking to see  
The light that has lighted the world
