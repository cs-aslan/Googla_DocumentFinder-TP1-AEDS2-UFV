Ridin in a long gray limousine  
Sittin in a pair of hundred dollar jeans  
Tryin to talk sense to a rocknroll queen  
Damn best kinda livin anybody ever seen  
Oh Angeline  
  
Chorus  
Lookin at the bright lights searchin for the sliver screen  
I never seen a woman who could look so good  
And be so doggone mean Yeah  
Oh midnight struttin in New York City  
Midnight woman she is lookin so pretty  
Her little heart beat in rhythm with the world  
She used to be her mamas little girl  
Hey hey Angeline  
  
Chorus  
  
Whoa just a game that she loves to play  
Leavin broken hearts all along the way  
Shes got friends that she aint never used  
Shes winnin now but shes bound to lose  
Oh Angeline  
  
Chorus
