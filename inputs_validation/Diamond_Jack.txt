As the dealer dealt the cards to everyone  
I could see that I was free  
I had an ace of hearts the dream of every man  
And I could see my destiny  
I can not justify the way I play  
But only see them as they fall  
  
The diamond jack  
Black magical lady luck  
Who will show me the way  
When you have your freedom  
Without worldly care  
Around human share  
Along the way theres evil waitin for you  
And theres no judge and jury but yourself  
When youre tired to the bone  
Remembrance gone  
And you have cast your dice  
Take your chances as they come one by one  
The hand of fate is as cold as ice
