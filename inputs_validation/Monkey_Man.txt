Great monkey man has gone the distance  
The lucky ones going to get it  
Loving life now  
Living on top of  
Lucky ones always get it all  
  
Oh Im hungry  
Dont wanna die like a little dog  
Gonna take what I can get  
Im the monkey man  
With the great great monkey plan  
  
Its crazy crazy little man  
Youve got yourself entangled  
  
Oh love to lie to myself  
To say everything is fine now  
We got to keep it up  
Or fall behind  
I got to keep it up  
Or lose the edge we found faster  
Ill build higher still higher  
I dig deeper down  
Til its down in the ground  
Its found used up and then thrown out  
  
Crazy crazy little man  
What do you think youre doing here  
  
Big beautiful world just for us  
Good use we must put it to  
Any way I can think to use it up  
What will I tell my grandsons grandsons  
  
I could weave a fairy tale  
On a great biblethumping scale  
When he stands empy hands  
On his empty land  
Thats what happened here  
Great great monkey man  
  
Where did you think grey was the color of this  
You think I dont know quite what to say  
But Im worried for myself in this  
  
Im hungry  
Dont wanna die like a little dog  
Well I eat what I can get  
From the monkey man  
Great great monkey man  
Great great monkey plan  
  
Crazy crazy man  
You get yourself turned in a pickle  
  
Crazy crazy monkey man  
Who is the one in the middle  
  
Take a walk  
Cross the ice  
Melts too quickly for us to reach the other side  
  
Its cold in here  
But the sun shines bright  
Oh it warms this up well  
Oh the tide is rising higher  
  
Look its strange  
Floating by  
Looks just like the ones  
That flow out and ride oh I will  
  
Golden age  
These golden times  
Our golden days seem to have us  
Hypnotized or blind well
