First I rise then I fall  
Seems like you dont want the love  
Of this man at all  
And its sure been a lonely time  
Right up to the time I met you  
So if you take a love like mine  
  
Be tender with my love  
You know how easy it is to hurt me  
Fanny be tender with my love  
Cause its all that Ive got  
And my love wont desert me  
  
So you say to yourself boy  
Youre out of your brain  
Do you think Im gonna stand here  
All night in the rain  
And its the start of a love affair  
The moment when I first met you  
And if you want Ill take you there  
  
Be tender with my love  
You know how easy it is to break it  
Fanny be tender with my love  
Cause its all that Ive got  
And my love wont forsake me  
  
With my love  
Our love will seal it together  
Oh with our love  
You made a promise  
Youll always love me forever  
  
Be tender with my love  
You know how easy it is to break it  
Fanny be tender with my love
