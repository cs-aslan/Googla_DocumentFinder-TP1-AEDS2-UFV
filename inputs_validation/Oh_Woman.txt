My whole life rides on the mood of my lady  
Her ups and downs are turning my life around  
Shes happy today its like a breath of new life  
But tomorrow her sorrow will tear me down  
  
Slowly oh slowly I can tell that she needs me  
It shows right through the walls shes built around herself  
Oh higher oh higher Im climbing in her eyes  
Its a servant she wants but a man she must have  
  
Oh oh woman I need you like I never needed anyone  
Oh oh woman like the morning needs the sun  
Oh oh woman you know that our lives have just begun  
Ill behave oh woman cause Im your slave  
  
Oh two lives in tune its a delicate balance to keep  
Well stand together but never too near  
Oh hold me close but dont you smother me  
Ill speak of my love but only for you to hear  
  
Oh oh woman I need you like I never needed anyone  
Oh oh woman like the morning needs the sun  
Oh oh woman you know that our lives have just begun  
Ill behave oh woman cause Im your slave
