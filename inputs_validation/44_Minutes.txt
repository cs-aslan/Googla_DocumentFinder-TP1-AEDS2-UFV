It was a cool winters morning  
Somewhere shortly past 900 AM  
The armored car they wanted to heist wasnt coming  
So instead they went for the bank  
  
The fateful duo that sat in the getaway car  
Heavily sedated with thousands of round  
Armor piercing fully automatic weapons  
The bowls of wrath poured out on the ground  
  
Chorus  
Baptized in a firefight  
Hot blood running cold as ice  
Forty four minutes of target practice  
All hells breaking loose  
Outgunned watching The Force come to a firefight with a pocketknife  
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles heel  
And brought down the beast  
  
This was an accident waiting to happen  
It wasnt if it would happen it was when  
The citys people sabotaged themselves  
Calling their firepower an unneeded expense  
  
The two most violent men it seemed couldnt be stopped  
Standard police issue guns were just not enough  
But SWAT arrived to settled the fight  
Between AK47 and AR15  
  
Chorus x2
