Take your hand  
And place it in my pocket  
Flick your eyes back in their sockets  
Put those thoughts away  
Sometimes theyre much to loud  
Ill take a breath  
And cradle your sweet head  
Shouldve stayed at home in bed  
Put that face away  
Im melting for you  
I know I get cold  
cause I cant leave things well alone  
Understand Im accident prone  
Me I get free  
Every night the moon is mine  
But when the morning comes  
Dont say you love me  
Dont say you need me  
I really dont think thats fair  
Boy Im not so dumb  
But when you leave me  
Ill be wishing I wishing I wishing I was there  
I dreamt about another girl in bed with you  
You just laughed and smiled  
Denied the proof  
Were fine till I think of the problem  
I wish it made sense  
Like a joke that no one gets  
Its a life without regret  
I want it to feel that way forever and ever  
I know I get cold  
cause I cant leave things well alone  
Understand Im accident prone  
Me I get free  
Every night the moon is mine  
But when the morning comes  
Dont say you love me  
Dont say you need me  
I really dont think thats fair  
Boy Im not so dumb  
But when you leave me  
Ill be wishing I wishing I wishing I was there  
Ill be wishing I wishing I wishing I was there with you  
Ill be wishing I wishing I wishing I was there  
Ill be wishing I wishing I wishing I was there with you  
Dont say you love me  
Dont say you need me  
I really dont think thats fair  
Boy Im not so dumb  
But when you leave me  
Ill be wishing I wishing I wishing I was there with you  
Ill be wishing I wishing I wishing I was there  
Ill be wishing I wishing I wishing I was there with you  
Ill be wishing I wishing I wishing I was there  
Ill be wishing I wishing I wishing I was there with you  
Ill be wishing I wishing I wishing I was there  
Ill be wishing I wishing I wishing I was there with you
