I cant feel my senses  
I just feel the cold  
All colors seem to fade away  
I cant reach my soul  
  
I would stop running  
If I knew there was a chance  
It tears me apart to sacrifice it all  
But Im forced to let go  
  
Tell me Im frozen but what can I do  
Cant tell the reasons I did it for you  
When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you  
You say that I am frozen but what can I do  
  
I can feel your sorrow  
  
You wont forgive me  
But I know youll be alright  
It tears me apart that you will never know  
But I have to let go  
  
Tell me Im frozen but what can I do  
Cant tell the reasons I did it for you  
When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you  
You say that I am frozen but what can I do  
  
Everything will slip away  
Shattered pieces will remain  
When memories fade into emptiness  
Only time will tell its tale if it all has been in vain  
  
I cant feel my senses  
I just feel the cold  
  
Frozen  
What can I do  
Frozen  
  
Tell me Im frozen but what can I do  
Cant tell the reasons I did it for you  
When lies turn into truth I sacrificed for you  
You say that I am frozen Frozen
