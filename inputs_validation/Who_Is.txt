Oh I was perfect  
For the circus  
If she dared me Id do it  
Love makes you stupid  
I gave it up  
But I guess it was not enough  
Cause she never seemed satisfied  
  
Oooh I know Im not perfect  
But at the end of the day  
Who is Oooh  
She wanted someone thats perfect  
Okay  
But can you tell me who is  
  
Oooh Ooh Oooh  
Oooh Ooh Oooh  
  
She set the bar  
Just above the stars  
A rocket couldnt reach it  
But I still kept on reachin  
She watched me try  
At least a thousand time  
If she loved me shed stop me but no  
  
Oooh I know Im not perfect  
But at the end of the day  
Who is Oooh  
She wanted someone thats perfect  
Okay  
But can you tell me who is  
  
I saw something worth my future  
So wrong so wrong  
In my mind I was all it took  
But I guess I wasnt wrong  
  
Oooh I know Im not perfect  
But at the end of the day  
Who is  
She wanted someone thats perfect  
Okay  
But can you tell me who is  
  
Oooh Ooh Oooh  
Oooh Ooh Oooh
