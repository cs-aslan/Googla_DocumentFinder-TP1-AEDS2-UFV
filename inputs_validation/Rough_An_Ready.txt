I take what I want  
An I steal anything that I need  
I would do anything  
To get my satisfaction guaranteed  
  
Cause Im looking for love  
The time has come  
Im looking for love  
An I mean to get me some  
Im looking for love right now  
An Im rough an ready  
  
All of you woman better  
Lift up your skirts an run  
Cause I aim to shoot my pistol  
An fire like a Gatlin gun  
  
Cause Im looking for love  
Believe me when I say  
Im looking for love  
In the worst kind of way  
Im looking for love right now  
An Im rough an ready  
  
Rough an ready  
  
Rough an ready  
  
I take what I want  
An I steal anything that I need  
I would do anything  
To get my satisfaction guaranteed  
  
Cause Im looking for love  
The time has come  
Im looking for love  
An I mean to get me some  
Im looking for love right now  
An Im rough an ready  
  
Rough an ready
