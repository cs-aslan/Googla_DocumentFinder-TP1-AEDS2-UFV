Can you picture mother earth  
In the palm of your hand  
The entire universe  
As a tiny grain of sand  
And it feels impossible to do  
As I cant imagine love without you  
Think of drinking every sea  
With its salty waters dry  
Sprinting round the world three times  
Faster than a rocket flys  
And the thought of it you cant pursue  
As I cant imagine love without you  
Some thoughts just know great news  
Not worth the amount of time  
Yet others inconceivable  
So they never cross your mind  
Travel back through life and times  
One Atlanta summers night  
Add up every single star  
Since the day the first was light  
How and when they started I have no clue  
As I cant imagine love without you  
Yet others inconceivable  
So they never cross your mind  
Travel back through life and times  
One Atlanta summers night  
Add up every single star  
Since the day the first was light  
How and when it started I have no clue  
And the thought of it you cant pursue  
Cause it feels impossible to do  
As I cant imagine love without  
I cant imagine love without you
