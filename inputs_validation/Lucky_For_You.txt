Lucky I call you cus thats the way you make me feel  
Love in the air and the wind in my hair is makin me real  
Look out Lucky theres a mountain in front of you  
And with a little luck well see it thru  
Whats lucky for me is lucky for you  
  
I used to think that luck was just another four letter word  
But now that I found you its the finest one Ive ever heard  
Do you see the stars now do you Lucky  
Theyre not all that far now are they Lucky  
Whats lucky for you is lucky for me  
And whats lucky for me is lucky for you
