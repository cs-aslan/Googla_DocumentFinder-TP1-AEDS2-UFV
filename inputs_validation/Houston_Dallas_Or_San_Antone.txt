I got drunk in Austin Texas I missed my plane in North Carolina  
Spent all of my money on a long distance call  
Huntsville Prison walls so high Im so lonesome I could die  
You could make a grown man cry if you wanted to  
Say goodbye to Houston for me give my best to San Antone  
Tell Dallas theres a change in plans I wont be comin home  
  
Dallas lives in Winston Salem we got married in West Virginia  
Then we moved to Texas on a fifty acre farm  
I robbed a bank and shot a man ended up in Birmingham  
But I guess I tipped my hand and wound up in the pen  
Say goodbye to Houston for me  
  
Houston is my oldest daughter says shes leaving for New York City  
Shes gonna make her living reaching for a star  
San Antones my only son please dont tell him what Ive done  
Or that I had to use my gun for that I killed a man  
Say goodbye to Houston for me  
Say goodbye to Houston for me  
Say goodbye to Houston for me
