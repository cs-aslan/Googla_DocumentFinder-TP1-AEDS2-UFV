I havent seen the things youve seen  
Im rushing to an empty goal  
I lost control  
Every minute I remind myself  
Theres no way back unless I fall  
Im fighting my war  
Keep me down  
Keep me down  
No  
Whats not I can not help tumble down  
But its too late too soon or now  
I lost control  
And you push me back up  
And I wanna get down  
And you push me back up  
And I wanna get down on the ground  
I wanna get out  
Keep me down  
Keep me down  
No  
And you push me up more and I wanna get down  
And you push me up more and I wanna resist  
And I push you on the floor but I dont wanna fight  
Can we please now stop  
Keep me down  
Keep me down  
No 2x
