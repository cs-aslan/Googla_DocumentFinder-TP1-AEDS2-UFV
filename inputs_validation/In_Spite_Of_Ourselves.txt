She dont like her eggs all runny  
She thinks crossin her legs is funny  
She looks down her nose at money  
She gets it on like the Easter Bunny  
Shes my baby  
Im her honey  
Im never gonna let her go  
  
He aint got laid in a month of Sundays  
I caught him once and he was sniffin my undies  
He aint too sharp but he gets things done  
Drinks his beer like its oxygen  
Hes my baby  
And Im his honey  
Never gonna let him go  
  
Chorus  
In spite of ourselves  
Well end up asittin on a rainbow  
Against all odds  
Honey were the big door prize  
Were gonna spite our noses  
Right off of our faces  
There wont be nothin but big old hearts  
Dancin in our eyes  
  
She thinks all my jokes are corny  
Convict movies make her horny  
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs  
Swears like a sailor when shaves her legs  
She takes a lickin  
And keeps on tickin  
Im never gonna let her go  
  
Hes got more balls than a big brass monkey  
Hes a wacked out weirdo and a love bug junkie  
Sly as a fox and crazy as a loon  
Payday comes and hes howlin at the moon  
Hes my baby  
I dont mean maybe  
Never gonna let him go  
  
Chorus  
  
In spite of ourselves
