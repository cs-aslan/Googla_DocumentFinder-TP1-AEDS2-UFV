I trusted you at least I thought I could  
I tried to believe when you said  
I got a better job I can pay you back  
Real soon No I dont do those drugs no more  
I know my luck has changed my lifestyle  
Has rearranged Im on my feet  
  
Youll never change your ways  
Living from day to daze  
Why dont you fade away  
  
Ive heard all this before  
When you were sleeping on my floor  
You said only for a day  
But as those 3 weeks passed  
My patience didnt last nor my food
