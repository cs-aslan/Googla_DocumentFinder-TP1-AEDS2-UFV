Although I know our love is going strong  
Little surprises kind of help it along  
We mustnt let our lives become routine  
Dont do anything we dont mean  
There is no limit on love at all  
It can always get better the deeper you fall  
Im sure without that love we wont survive  
So come on and show itlets keep it alive  
And well be making a good thing better  
But with luck its gonna last forever  
Youll see  
Making a good thing better  
Thats the way were gonna stay together  
You and me  
If were to make each other satisfied  
Gotta keep on tryindont let it ride  
It all comes over in the morning kiss  
Dont do it like thatdo it like this  
Making a good thing better  
But with luck its gonna last forever  
Youll see  
Making a good thing better  
Thats the way were gonna stay together  
You and me  
Make it so much better  
It is better better  
Make it so much better  
Make it better better  
Make it better better better  
Make it better better better  
Make it better better better  
Better better  
Making a good thing better  
But with luck its gonna last forever  
Youll see  
Making a good thing better  
Thats the way were gonna stay together  
You and me
