Well I feel somethings taking meI dont know where  
Its like a trip inside a separate mind  
The ghost of tomorrowof my favorite dream  
Is telling me to leave it all behind  
Feel it slipping away  
Slipping in tomorrow  
Gotta get to happiness  
From the depths of sorrow  
Im alrightam I right  
As I try to get away from you now  
Am I rightIm alright  
As I try to get away from you now  
Sting Me  
Well I feel somethings giving me the chance to return  
Its giving me the chance of saving my soul  
A big bad demigodfading away  
Im going back to where Im in control  
Feel it slipping away  
Slipping in tomorrow  
Getting back to Sanity  
From the depths of sorrow  
Was it wiseto disguise  
As I try to get away from you now  
Is there a wayI can pay  
Or is it true I have to stay with you now  
Was I rightAm I right  
As I try to get away from you now  
Was it wiseto disguise  
As I try to get away from you now  
Suck Me  
Im the King of schizophreniathe pest of the Earth  
I singed my soul in the fires of Hell  
I feel someone eluding me  
But now its all mine  
I set the trap and it was me who fell  
Feel it slipping away  
Slipping in tomorrow  
Getting back to sanity  
From the depths of sorrow  
No more liesI got wiseI despise the way I worship you Yeah  
Now your freecant you seeyeah this time I wont be led by you Yeah
