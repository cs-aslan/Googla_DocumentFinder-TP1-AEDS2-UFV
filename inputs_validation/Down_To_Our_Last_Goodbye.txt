This was my last mistake  
Thats all her heart could take  
Now were down to our last goodbye  
  
Her lips wont kiss me now  
The lips that I taught how  
Now were down to our last goodbye  
  
What can I tell her  
That I havent told her  
That would change her mind  
Cause she heard that line before  
Now all thats left for me  
Is just the memory of all  
Those happy days gone by  
Now were down to our last goodbye  
What can I tell her  
That I havent told her  
That would change her mind  
Cause she heard that line before  
Now all thats left for me  
Is just the memory of all  
Those happy days gone by  
Now were down to our last goodbye
