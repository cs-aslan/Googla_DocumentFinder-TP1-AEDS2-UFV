Ten little Indians  
Standin in a row  
All dressed up  
But nowhere to go  
Lookin for a target  
Lookin for a man   
  
Just get me outta here  
Its not the place  
My minds been thinkin on  
Just push me out again  
Its no use hangin round or hanginon  
  
Seven little Indians  
Standin in a row  
The compere walks on the stage and he says  
Sing it Girls  
But the bands no good  
And the song dont cut it  
  
Just get me outta here  
Its not the place  
My minds been thinkin on  
Just push me out again  
Its no use hangin round or hanginon  
  
Come on lets go tonight  
We gotta brand new way to celebrate it  
Oh  I got this rage to love  
Baby  its so right  
And if you feel it   
Good   
Dedicate it  
Oh  I got this rage to love  
  
Three little indians  
Cryin in their makeup  
Nobody stops  
And nobody cares  
  
Just get me outta here  
Its not the place  
My minds been thinkin on  
Just push me out again  
Its no use hangin round or hanginon  
  
Come on lets go tonight  
We gotta brand new way to celebrate it  
Oh  I got this rage to love  
Baby its so right  
And if you feel it  
Good   
Dedicate it  
Oh I got this rage to  
Oh its just this rage to Oh I got this rage to love
