So there we were back home  
From somewhere inside my head  
Well bravely I fought off the monsters beneath her bed  
Pillars of postwar books supported my frame of mind  
While she memorized the pages that I tried to not hide behind  
She took my hand in hers and whispered her love for me  
The lantern died that night but we didnt need to see  
Implying that shes the bees knees and I am the cats meow  
Its funny how she recalls when I cant remember now  
  
But when her smile came back  
And I didnt feel half as horrible  
She gave me a heart attack  
Just because she looked so adorable  
We both put our sunblock on  
Laid on the beach and vowed that wed live and wed learn  
Yeah but she got a tan and I got a sunburn  
  
I got a sunburn  
  
So there we were out there  
Unaware of where wed been  
We kicked off our flipflops  
And swung from the rooftops again  
Its awkward but Ill confess shes all I can think about  
And its funny how I recall when she cant remember now  
  
But when her smile came back  
And I didnt feel half as horrible  
She gave me a heart attack  
Just because she looked so adorable  
We both put our sunblock on  
Laid on the beach and vowed that wed live and wed learn  
Yeah But she got a tan and I got a sunburn  
  
Oh afterglow look out below  
Wed left a trail of dust behind  
As we parted ways she held my gaze  
And left an imprint on my mind  
I tried not to cry as we said goodbye  
And hung the clouds above my town  
But I shed a tear when she disappeared  
Cause now Im a stranger on the ground  
  
But when her smile came back  
And I didnt feel half as horrible  
She gave me a heart attack  
We both put our sunblock on  
Laid on the beach and vowed that wed live and wed learn  
But she got a tan and I got a sunburn  
  
She got a tan and I got a sunburn  
Yeah but she got a tan and I got a sunburn
