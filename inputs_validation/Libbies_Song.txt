If it wasnt for your golden hair  
I would not be belonely  
If it wasnt for your golden hair  
I would not be alone  
  
If it wasnt for your piercing stare  
I would not be belonely  
If it wasnt for your piercing stare  
I would not be alone  
  
I would not waltz in a widows line  
What was yours would not be mine  
If it wasnt for your golden hair  
I would not be alone  
  
You courted me with princely airs  
Said youd love me only  
Kiss the ribbons in my hair  
Said darling come and fly  
  
Flower of the Calvary  
You swept me off my saddle  
Lifted me into your life  
A soldiers wife was I  
  
You marched proudly for the horn  
I prayed for your swift return  
I waited for you so forlorn  
Ere to be alone  
I longed for you I longed to die  
I was so belonely  
The pillows bare by my side  
And yet I shall abide  
  
For heaven has aset for me  
Companion for eternity  
So kiss the ribbons in my hair  
Say darling come and fly  
  
If it wasnt for your golden hair  
I would not be alonely  
If it wasnt for your golden hair
