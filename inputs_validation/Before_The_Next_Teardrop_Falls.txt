If she brings you happiness  
Then I wish you both the best  
Its your happiness that matters most of all  
But if she ever breaks your heart  
If the teardrops ever start  
Ill be there before the next teardrop falls  
  
Though it hurts to let you go  
Darling I want you to know  
Ill run to you if ever you should call  
And if I should ever hear  
That shes made you shed a tear  
Ill be there before the next teardrop falls  
  
Ill be there anytime you need me by your side  
To dry away each teardrop youve cried  
If she ever leaves you blue  
Just remember I love you  
And Ill be there  
Before the next teardrop falls  
  
All I Estare Candor me necesites a tu lado  
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado  
If he ever leaves you blue  
Just remember I love you  
And Ill be there  
Before the next teardrop falls  
  
Ill be there Ill be there  
Before the next teardrop falls
