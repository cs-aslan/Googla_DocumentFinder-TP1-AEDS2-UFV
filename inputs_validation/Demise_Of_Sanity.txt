Its gonna break you son its gonna rot you through  
Forget the past and all you ever knew  
Youve never known such fear youve never shed such tears  
Itll have you wishin you were never here  
Where have I gone blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down forever on the wrong side  
Where have I gone blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down  
All that has been all thats to be  
No tomorrow the demise of sanity  
All that has been all thats to be  
No tomorrow the demise of sanity  
Straight through the depths of hell aint got no soul to sell  
Death on death the eternal funeral bell  
Youve never known such fear youve never shed such tears  
Itll have you wishin you were never here  
Where have I gone blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down forever on the wrong side  
Where have I gone blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down  
All that has been all thats to be  
No tomorrow the demise of sanity  
All that has been all thats to be  
No tomorrow the demise of sanity  
Where have I gone blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down forever on the wrong side  
Where have I gone blacked out on my death ride  
Twisted and broken down  
All that has been all thats to be  
No tomorrow the demise of sanity  
All that has been all thats to be  
No tomorrow the demise of sanity  
All that has been all thats to be  
No tomorrow the demise of sanity  
All that has been all thats to be
