Well bring on the band  
And the melody man  
Let the mockingbirds sing along  
Its a wonderful life  
And the night is young  
  
Well ladies and gents  
The gala presents  
A symphony in disguise  
Its a wonderful thing  
The clouds in your eyes  
  
Ill do my song and dance for your this night  
Ill sing you things you came to hear  
Ill do my song and dance for you this night  
Id walk a mile to see you cheer  
  
Well life is a song  
That goes on and on  
From pittsburgh to peru  
Its a wonderful world  
Here with you  
  
Ill do my song and dance for your this night  
Ill sing you things you came to hear  
Ill do my song and dance for you this night  
Id walk a mile to see you cheer  
  
This is my song and dance for you this night  
Ive walked a mile to see you cheer
