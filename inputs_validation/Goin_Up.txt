Well come gather all around me  
There is something you should know  
Theres no place quite like this place  
If we get it on the go  
  
So pile your boots up in the corner  
Hang your jacket from the door  
Theres thirty people in the kitchen  
And theres always room for more  
  
Chorus  
  
Ohohoh come on now  
Lets lock the world outside  
Ohohoh come on I tell you now  
Shes goin up tonight  
  
Well therell be music all around you  
You should see the way it feels  
Come on off we go now  
Heel and toe now  
To the jigs and reels  
  
Cause somebodys got a fiddle  
And someone else bought a guitar  
And we got Bobby on the squeezebox  
Grab a chair and mason jar  
  
Chorus  
  
Well therell be smilin therell be laughin  
Well thats good enough for me  
Therell be dancing all around you  
This is where you want to be  
  
So pile your boots up in the corner  
Hang your jacket from the door  
Theres thirty people in the kitchen  
And theres always room yes theres always room
