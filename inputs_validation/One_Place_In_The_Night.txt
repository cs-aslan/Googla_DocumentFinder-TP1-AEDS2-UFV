Girl dont wait youup tonight  
Dont leave on the light  
Cause youll be sleepin alone again  
I know my intentions were the best  
I had it all worked out you see  
But you deserve a whole lot better than me  
  
Chorus  
You need a man  
Whose heart is only one place in the night  
Wholl stay right here and just be satisfied  
You need a man  
Who wont disappoint you every time  
Wholl call and say our plans have changed  
So dont wait up tonight  
  
Stop me now  
Ive gone and talked too much again  
You know I do that now and then  
So pay no attention to me  
If II say your name  
A thousand times again and again  
Just dont listen to me  
  
Chorus
