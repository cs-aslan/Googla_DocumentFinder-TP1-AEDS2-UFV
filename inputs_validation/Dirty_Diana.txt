Oh no  
Oh no  
Oh no  
  
You never make me stay  
So take your weight off of me  
I know your every move  
So wont you just let me be  
Ive been here times before  
But I was to blind to see  
That you seduce every man  
This time you wont seduce me  
  
Shes saying thats ok  
Hey baby do what you please  
I have the stuff the you want  
I am the thing that you need  
She looked me deep in the eyes  
Shes touchin me so to start  
She says theres no turnin back  
She trapped me in her heart  
  
Dirty Diana nah

Oh no

She likes the boys in the band  
She knows when they come to town  
Every musicians fan after the  
curtain comes down  
She waits at backstage doors  
For those who have prestige  
Who promise fortune and fame  
A life thats so carefree  
  
Shes says thats ok  
Hey baby do what you want  
Ill be your night lovin thing  
Ill be the freak you can taunt  
And I dont care what you say  
I want to go too far  
Ill be your everything  
If you make me a star

Cause Im real tired you see  
But I hate sleppin alone  
Why dont you come with me  
I said my babys at home  
Shes probably worried tonight

Diana walked up to me  
She said Im all yours tonight  
At that I ran to the phone  
Sayin baby Im alright

Because I forgot the key  
She said hes not coming back  
Because hes sleeping with me
