Originally by Band of Horses  
  
Its looking like a limb torn off  
Or altogether just taken apart  
Were reeling through an endless fall  
We are the everliving ghost of what once was  
  
But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do  
No ones gonna love you more than I do  
  
And anything to make you smile  
Its a better side of you to admire  
But they should never take so long  
Just to be over then back to another one  
  
But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do  
No ones gonna love you more than I do  
  
But someone should have warned you  
When things start splitting at the seams and now  
The whole things tumbling down  
Things start splitting at the seams and now  
If things start splitting at the seams and now  
Its tumbling down hard  
  
I did anything to make you smile  
You are the everliving ghost of what once was  
I never want to hear you say  
That your better off  
Or you liked it that way  
  
Cos no one is ever gonna love you more than I do  
No ones gonna love you more than I do  
  
They really should have warned you  
When things start splitting at the seams and now  
The whole things tumbling down  
Things start splitting at the seams and now  
If things start splitting at the seams and now  
Its tumbling down hard
