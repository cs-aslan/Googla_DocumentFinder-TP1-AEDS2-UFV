Here I sit by my window thinking about all the things that Ive been through  
There were times where I never thought I get to where I got to  
Had some angels to guide me someone who just violate my love  
Now this is my chance to say aint go nothin but love  
  
For my family that raised me shout out shout out  
And my teacher that done praised me shout out shout out  
To anyone who tried to hate on me shout out shout out  
Even the ones who tried to break me even the ones who tried to take me down  
  
Chorus  
Thereve been haters since this world been going round  
nothin but love nothin but love  
Why they take a thing and trying to crush them down  
nothin but love nothin but love  
I aint even trying to hold on to that now  
nothin but love nothin but love  
Aint got nothin but love for you  
nothin but love nothin but love  
  
I could hold on to pain but that aint what my lifes about  
I aint blaming nobody if I aint got my stuff worked out  
I got love for my self aint goin regret anything Ive done  
I just want to sing my song aint got nothin but love  
  
For all the players on the street shout out shout out  
To all my ghetto doing their own thing keep on keep strong  
To all my exes that done wrong me stepped on me cant hold me down  
  
Chorus  
  
To all the givers and the takers  
To my crew from way back when  
To the cold wars and the stares  
And the ones that I aint met  
  
For my self for sticking with me  
For the ones I miss from up above  
Anyone whos ever been a part of me  
Aint got nothin but love  
Aint got nothin but love  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x5  
Aint got nothin but love for you  
nothin but love nothin but love
