A few stolen moments is all that we share  
Youve got your family and they need you there  
Though Ive tried to resist being last on your list  
But no other mans gonna do  
So Im saving all my love for you  
  
Its not very easy living all alone  
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own  
But each time I try I just break down and cry  
Cause Id rather be home feeling blue  
So Im saving all my love for you  
  
You used to tell me wed run away together  
Love gives you the right to be free  
You said be patient just wait a little longer  
But thats just an old fantasy  
  
Ive got to get ready just a few minutes more  
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door  
Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright  
Well be making love the whole night through  
So Im saving all my love for you  
Yes Im saving all my love  
Yes Im saving all my love for you  
  
No other woman is gonna love you more  
Cause tonight is the night that Im feeling alright  
Well be making love the whole night through  
So Im saving all my love  
Yeah Im saving all my lovin  
Yes Im saving all my love for you  
For you
