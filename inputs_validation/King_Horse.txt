Cheap cut satin and bad perfume  
Showtime is almost here  
Teased up by a strip cartoon  
Laughing up your sleeve  
Sniggering in your beer  
Hed seen the bottom of a lot of glasses  
But hed never seen love so near  
Hed seen love get so expensive  
But hed never seen love get so dear  
  
Chorus  
Now I know that youre all King Horse  
Between tenderness and brute force repeat  
  
She can turn upon a sixpence in the mouth and trousers set  
Hit the bill ring the bell never spill a sip  
And still she knows the kind of tip that she is gonna get  
A lot of loose exchanges precious little respect  
When its someone elses weekend  
Thats the best you can expect  
  
Chorus  
  
So fond of the fabric  
So fond of fabrication  
From comic books to tragic  
Through the heart of complications  
Meanwhile back in some secluded spot  
He says will you please and she says stop  
If I ever lose this good thing that Ive got  
I never want to hear the song you dedicated tonight  
Cause I knew that song so long before we met  
That it means much more than it might  
  
Chorus
