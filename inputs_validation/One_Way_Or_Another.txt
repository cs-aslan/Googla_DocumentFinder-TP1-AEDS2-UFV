Theres been some  
Changes in my time  
But this ones playing  
Games with my mind  
Stopped in my tracks  
No thought of looking back  
The ladys got me tied up  
But Ive already made my mind up  
One way or another  
Shell be mine  
  
It wasnt anything I could define  
None of those ringing bells  
Giving me a sign  
I just took a look  
But I was on the hook  
The ladys got me tied up  
Dont know how its gonna wind up  
One way or another  
Gonna be all right  
  
Im beginning to think  
That a forever kind of love  
Is the kind of love  
Ill look for forever  
But still Ill love and love again  
One way or another  
I will find my friend  
  
I knew some day my heart  
Would lead my head  
Beyond the path  
My chosen life had led  
Id been so sure  
But where is the cure  
The ladys got me real good  
But you cant say  
What I should do  
One way or another  
Its all over now  
  
One way or another
