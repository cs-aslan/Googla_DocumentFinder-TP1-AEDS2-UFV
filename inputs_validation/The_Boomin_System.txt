Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumpin  
  
Yeah alright  
But we need a beat that they can front to  
Oh thatll work  
Be funky  
You know what Im sayin  
  
Cars ride by with the boomin systems  
Cars ride by  
  
Funky  
For all the cars out there  
And all the brothers  
That like to front in their rides  
Check it out  
  
You know its funky funky funky cos you heard it from hearsay  
A jam that you love that dont be gettin no airplay  
Strictly for frontin when youre ridin around  
12 oclock at night with your windows down  
Headlights breakin cause your batteries drain  
Armor all on your tires and a big gold chain  
Parkin outside of all the hiphop spots  
Push the EQ and play connect the dots  
Leanin to the side people everywhere  
The trunk full of amps there aint no room for a spare  
Big beats bumpin with the bass in back  
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack  
Cause they dont understand why I act this way  
Pumpin up the funky beat until the break of day  
Its because I want attention when Im ridin by  
And the girls be on my jock cos my systems fly  
  
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me  
Cause they be hear me gettin funky frequently  
They tell me dont drink and drive I say what is this  
Mind your business  
Now pass it around  
Laid back hypnotized by the funky sound  
People in the street see me bobbin my head  
While Im checking out the rapper and the rhyme that he said  
Im fronting and I dont care if you know  
The backseat of my car is like a disco show  
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone  
Crazy air freshener who needs cologne  
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top  
Cruise its 3 oclock  
The girlies they smile they see me coming  
Im steady huming I got the Funky Drumer druming  
My trunk be shaking vibrating and rattling  
Pumping so loud all the shorties be battling  
A righthand mans here without the swing  
Every chance I get Im showing off my rings  
I can keep it up until the break of dawn  
Cos Im fronting in my ride and my word is bond  
  
Sun roof open so I can feel the wind blow  
I dont give a damn if it cracks my back window  
C to the o to the o to the l to the i to the n  
To the f to the r to the o to the n to the t to the i to the n  
That means Im chilling  
Like Spoonie Gee said my seats are soft like a bed  
They recline way back so I can get real cosy  
I got the gangster tapes in the place  
Like a basehead would say I want bass  
I want a hit I want a dose  
Youre rolling up smiling but you cant come close  
Cos my system is pumping loud  
Like Rakim said I wanna move the crowd  
I warm it up with Kane fight the power with PE  
Tell the cops you gots to chill with EPMD  
This is something devastating thatll break your trunk  
And remember Uncle L is like the future of the funk  
  
You know what Im saying  
Word  
So next time youre in your ride pumping it up  
Just remember  
Its Cool  
  
Peace
