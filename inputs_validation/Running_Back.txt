Im a fool now that its over  
Can you guess my name  
I make my money singing songs about you  
Its my claim to fame  
  
When they say its over  
Its not all over theres still the pain  
  
Id come running  
Id come running back to you again  
Oh Id come running  
Id come running back to you again  
  
If I said I was sorry  
Would you still leave me  
I never thought youd go till you did  
Believe me  
  
When they say its over  
Its not all over completely  
  
Cause Id come running  
Id come running back to you again  
Yes Id come running  
Id come running back to you again  
  
I miss that girl  
  
The show is over  
And we must all go home  
Just leave me by myself  
Ill be alright here on my own  
  
If its all over its all over  
And Im all alone  
  
And Id come running  
Id come running back to you again  
Dont you know Id come running  
Id come running back to you again
