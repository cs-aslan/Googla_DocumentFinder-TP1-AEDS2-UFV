You always said you loved me  
And I always believed yu did  
But now you say youre leaving  
And taking both of the kids  
  
Chorus  
4 minus 3 equals zero  
Your leaving just dont add up  
Its all over for me if you go  
Cause Ill be nothing without your love  
  
The babies are sleeping in the bedroom  
They dont know youre packing their clothes  
At least they didnt see me crying  
When you said thats the way love goes  
  
Chorus  
  
4 minus 3 equals zero  
Cause Ill be nothing without your love
