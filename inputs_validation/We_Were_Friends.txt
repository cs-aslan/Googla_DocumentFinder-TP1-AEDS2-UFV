Suddenly we were friends  
Guarding our country from traitors and new trends  
You are at the borders  
I am at the beaches examining exactly what the enemy teaches  
Like presidents and pilots  
We turned our blind eye to letters over our heads floating in the sky  
Thousands of paper animals signalling danger  
They are evolving and the worlds a stranger  
  
No currency to drive us crazy  
No vehicles would drive us and make us lazy  
To make us lazy  
Only time my fall is when I fear only time may notice I disappear  
And I cant go back without a counter attack and I cant turn around  
Its my mothers pride  
  
So close to somewhere else but were not going there  
We scan the forest floors  
Looking worse for wear  
For life outside of ours  
Because we are too shallow and too brave to hide our scars and step in  
Ones shadow  
I am protective over you and the stories we enact  
Gain what from the smallest of contact  
  
No currency to drive us crazy  
No vehicles to drive us and make us lazy to make us lazy  
Only time I fall is when I fear only time may notice I disappear  
And when I see her when I see her Everyday  
  
Only time my fall is when I fear only time may notice I disappear and  
When I see her when I see her everyday
