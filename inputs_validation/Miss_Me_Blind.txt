Miss me  
I know youll miss me  
I know youll miss me blind  
  
I know youll miss me  
I know youll miss me  
I know youll miss me blind  
  
Bet you got a good gun  
Bet you know how  
To have some fun and then  
You turn it around on me  
Because Im better than the rest of the men  
  
I say youll miss me  
And you always do  
I say youll miss me  
Now would I lie to you  
  
Now theres no need to demand  
Grab my golden hand  
Ill teach you and youll never be sure  
If the way that you need  
Is too much like greed  
Decide if you are rich or youre poor  
  
I know youll miss me  
I know youll miss me  
I know youll miss me blind  
  
Bet you make the fool run  
Bet you know how  
To make it last forever  
But you know  
Im never really sure  
If youre just kissing to be clever  
  
I say youll miss me  
And you always do  
I say youll miss me  
Now would I lie to you  
  
Now theres no need to demand  
Grab my golden hand  
Ill teach you and youll never be sure  
If the way that you need  
Is too much like greed  
Decide if you are rich or youre poor  
  
Because the love  
That I have to give  
Must be better than that kind  
It can make you rich  
It can make you poor  
But I know that youll miss me blind  
  
I know youll miss me  
I know youll miss me  
I know youll miss me blind
