Upon release the doctors recommended a monthly  
Visit to the aviation pier  
It does me good to see a big steel bird  
Taking off through a transparent tear  
So now Im feeling better less pressure on  
The laundered eye a little less to fear  
  
I choose a positive afternoon  
The airports straight ahead  
I tell myself on the way down there  
could this be another addiction to dread  
Myself replies with a glimmer in her eyes  
we could always do pushups instead  
  
Terminal je taime I love you terminal bella mia  
  
The doors guess my intentions  
And slide to let me in  
I take my steppin slowly  
With a ritual backside swing  
Intercontinental jive  
Is live and tickling  
  
I gotta calm down in the lavatoire  
I look into the mirror a maniac looks back  
Terminals a chick like all chicks are  
I know at least a dozen girls like that  
  
Shes standing there with her short cropped hair  
Like something suspicious aboard swissair  
A real bombshell  
Her earring hook  
The security guard gives her penetrating look  
  
Terminal je taime I love you terminal bella mia  
  
I gotta find a flight but I dont know how  
Rome through zurich is leaving about now  
Polite pager lady telling me its time  
Deep inside Ive made up my mind  
  
Polite pager is getting uptight  
I gotta go upstairs and see my flight  
Inside my passions burning bright  
  
Shes running now shes flying high  
Taking off into the bloodred sky  
Reflected in this tearful jokers eyes  
  
Terminal je taime I love you terminal bella mia  
  
Its all a joke I say to me  
Then suddenly I hear the boom  
Explosion tears the sky apart  
A panicked flurry fills the room  
And so I turn and take a bow  
I think Im feeling better now  
  
Upon release the doctors recommended a monthly  
Visit to the aviation pier  
It really does me good to see a big steel bird  
Take off through a transparent tear  
After that the pressures not so bad  
Theres so much less to fear
