I liked going to school  
I didnt want to fool around with drugs  
Cause all of my friends were dropping out  
I had to get stuff done I wasnt fun  
I didnt try pot til I was 21  
but now Im overcompensating  
  
Id like to see what morning looks like  
Dont wanna drink pint after pint  
I wanna wake up without feeling sick  
But I cant cause Im a drugabusing alcoholic  
I cant cause Im a drugabusing alcoholic  
I cant cause Im a drugabusing alcoholic  
I cant cause Im a drugabusing alcoholic  
  
At 28 I realized  
hydrocodone was pretty great  
For hangovers and late night hangs  
I decided to spend my life having the best of times  
Its too bad most of them Ill probably forget  
  
And now I know what morning looks like  
But only when I greet it from the previous night  
My friends are telling me that I need to find a clinic  
But I wont cause Im a drugaddicted alcoholic  
I wont cause Im a drugaddicted alcoholic  
I wont cause Im a drugaddicted alcoholic  
I wont cause Im a drugaddicted alcoholic  
  
Cant stop taking drugs
