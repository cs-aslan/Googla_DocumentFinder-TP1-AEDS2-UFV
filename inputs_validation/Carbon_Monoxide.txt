Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Wheres the air  
Wheres the air  
Wheres the wheres the wheres the air  
After car after bus after car after truck  
After this my lungs will be so fucked up  
I wish I was in that Mercedes Benz  
Sealed away from my scents  
Id have the music high going ninety five  
Too much too much too much too much  
  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Dont you care  
Dont you care  
Dont you dont you dont you care  
After car after bus after car after truck  
After this my lungs will be so fucked up  
I wish I wasnt just a pedestrian  
Breathing all this in  
I look up at that grey sky  
It makes me want to oh  
Too much too much too much  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear
