I said oh my  
What a marvelous tune  
It was the best night  
Never would forget how we moved  
The whole place  
Was dressed to the nines  
And we were dancing dancing  
Like were made of starlight  
Like were made of starlight  
  
I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of 45  
Picks me up play one night out the window we were 17 and crazy  
Running wild wild  
Cant remember what song he was playing when we walked in  
The night we snuck into a yacht club party  
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince  
  
And I said oh my  
What a marvelous tune  
It was the best night  
Never would forget how we moved  
The whole place  
Was dressed to the nines  
And we were dancing dancing  
Like were made of starlight starlight  
Like were made of starlight starlight  
  
He said look at you  
Worrying so much about things you cant change  
Youll spend your whole life singing the blues  
If you keep thinking that way  
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me  
Dont you see the starlight starlight  
Dont you dream impossible things  
  
Like oh my  
What a marvelous tune  
It was the best night  
Never would forget how we moved  
The whole place  
Was dressed to the nines  
And we were dancing dancing  
Like were made of starlight starlight  
Like were made of starlight starlight  
  
Ooh ooh hes talking crazy  
Ooh ooh dancing with me  
Ooh ooh we could get married  
Have 10 kids and teach them how to dream  
  
Oh my  
What a marvelous tune  
It was the best night  
Never would forget how we moved  
The whole place  
Was dressed to the nines  
And we were dancing dancing  
Like were made of starlight starlight  
Like were made of starlight starlight  
Like were made of starlight starlight  
Like we dream impossible dreams  
Like starlight starlight  
Like we dream impossible dreams  
Dont you see the starlight starlight  
Dont you dream impossible things
