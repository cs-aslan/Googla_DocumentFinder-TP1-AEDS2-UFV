Met a woman she had a man  
Couldnt help it I had a plan  
Right around midnight he was gone  
Saw her red light she left it on  
And oh my hearts done time  
And oh now shes mine  
If theres a reason for these chains  
Its like we suffer to ease the pain  
Now I got this feelin inside of me  
My hearts in jail and I cant break free  
And oh my hearts done time  
And oh now shes mine  
Now shes mine  
Now shes mine  
Now shes mine  
Now shes mine  
And oh my hearts done time  
And oh now shes mine  
Now shes mine  
Now shes mine  
Now shes mine
