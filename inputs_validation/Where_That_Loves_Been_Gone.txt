Sometimes I wonder whos makin love to you now  
Now that its been so long  
Yes sometimes I wonder whos makin love to you now  
Now that its been so long  
Well I dont know how or when you found out  
Where that loves been gone  
Remember that winter we went walkin in the snow  
Now its been and gone  
Yes I remember that winter we went walkin in the snow  
Snow thats been and gone  
And right across the country still Ive got to go  
Wherever that loves been gone  
But any old way theres a smile on my face  
Theres a smile that I just cant hide  
Though Im missin you now like I like I never knew how  
I couldnt forget you if I tried  
Dont it make you wonder but I wouldnt worry no more  
Standing by the side of the road  
Oh dont it make you wonder but I wouldnt worry no more  
Just standing by the side of the road  
Into the night you just pick up and go  
You will see where that loves been gone  
But any old way theres a smile on my face  
Theres a smile that I just couldnt hide  
Though Im missing you now like I like I never knew how  
I couldnt forget you if I tried  
I couldnt forget you I couldnt forget you  
I couldnt forget you if I tried  
I couldnt forget you I couldnt forget you  
I couldnt forget you if I tried
