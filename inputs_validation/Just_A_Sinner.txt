Today I was gonna conquer the world  
Go on ahead and make a stand  
Today I saw an old friend a dyin  
And as he lay there no one lent a hand  
Im gonna call you up  
Youll forsake the one you love  
Though Ive left you many times before  
You are just a sinner  
  
I was the one who understands  
You were my one and only man  
I was lost now Im the winner  
You stand there waitin by the shore  
But I dont come that way no more  
Because you are just a sinner  
  
Today I was gonna hold out my hand  
Reach up for that light and let it shine  
Today I have no light to guide me  
Feelin like the one they left behind  
So I called you up  
You left your love and took me away  
Though Ive left you many times before  
You are just a sinner  
  
I am the only one you see  
You were the only one for me  
I was lost now Im the winner  
Youll keep the candle burning bright  
But I wont be home tonight  
Because you are just a sinner  
  
Today I was gonna conquer the world  
Go on ahead and make a stand  
Today I saw an old friend a dyin  
And as he lay there no one lent a hand
