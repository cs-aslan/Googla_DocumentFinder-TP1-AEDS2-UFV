There was nothing missing it was just a case of foolishness  
Girl I mustve been crazy  
Something I would just as soon forget  
I can only say Im sorry and leave it up to you to say the rest  
  
Chorus  
If you want to go girl I wont stand in your way  
But Ill stand by you if you decide you want to stay  
Baby dont you see  
Doesnt have to be forever or goodbye  
All Im asking for is one more try  
  
Im the one who hurt you still I know the pain youre going through  
And even if you show forgiveness there may be too much damage to undo  
I hear these voices telling me not to give up on you  
  
Chorus  
  
My heart and soul are searching  
Trying to find a way  
To bring your love back to me  
  
Still I hear these voices telling me not to give up on you  
  
Chorus
