Your cold words deafen  
And silence long forgotten  
The logic never reclaimed  
  
The anger rises  
Sometimes theres no surrender  
No white flag flies  
You wont like me when Im angry  
  
Stop talking to me  
Just like I dont even bleed  
This cross is heavy when  
Youre my soul sucker  
  
Get out of my face  
The past is running in place  
The silvers cut me as you  
Suck the soul right out of me  
  
Soul sucker  
  
You bite down deeper  
Your tongue can cut my heart out  
Youve passed the point of return yeah  
  
The storm lightens  
Get ready for the whiplash  
Dont think dont speak  
Dont my patience turns to violence  
  
Stop talking to me  
Just like I dont even bleed  
This cross is heavy when  
Youre my soul sucker  
  
Get out of my face  
The past is running in place  
The silvers cut me as you  
Suck the soul right out of me  
  
Soul sucker  
  
Im just a solitary man who wants to live  
A quiet life before where I cease to exist  
I dont need resistance for the things I cant control  
Just turn away and let it go  
  
Stop talking to me  
Just like I dont even bleed  
This cross is heavy when  
Youre my soul sucker  
  
Get out of my face  
The past is running in place  
The silvers cut me as you  
Suck the soul right out of me
