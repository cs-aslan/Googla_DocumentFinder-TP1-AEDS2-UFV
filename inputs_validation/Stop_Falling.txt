La da la la la  
La da la la la la ooh  
  
1 I aint lookin for a steady thing  
I aint looking for what love brings  
Cause Im still young and I aint ready babe  
Im still looking for some better days  
I dont wanna give you everything  
I just wanna make you feel things  
If you aint down to give me everything  
Just throw it away hey  
  
Dont assume cause Im a woman thatll fall in love  
Dont expect Im young and need to be took care of  
Dont wanna hear you got what I need  
Cause how would you know before we speak  
  
Youve gotta understand my side  
Ive had a crazy crazy life  
Nobody came along to open up my eyes  
You better take what you can get  
Dont even bother with my heart  
I get a feeling I wont let dissolve  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Please believe me  
Ive been down this road and back again  
Learned a lesson and it was that love is not my friend  
The day I put my trust in you  
Will be the day I say I do  
Dont expect me just to open up  
Maybe Im just a little scared  
Please dont tell me what you think  
I wanna hear  
Oh baby save it  
Ive heard it all before  
There aint nothing you could say  
Oh to make me change no way  
  
Repeat 1  
  
So stop falling stop falling  
You know youre falling for me  
Stop falling stop falling  
Stop falling for me yeah  
  
Youve gotta understand my side  
Ive had a crazy crazy life  
Nobody came along to open up my eyes  
Oh baby take what you can get  
Dont even bother with my heart  
I get a feeling I wont let dissolve  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Stop falling oh hey oh oh yeah  
Baby
