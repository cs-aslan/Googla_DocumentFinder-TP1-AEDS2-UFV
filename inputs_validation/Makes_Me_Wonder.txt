Stepped off the airplane I saw your face  
Its been forever but it dont feel that way  
Your hand took my hand like it knew what to do  
Girl its so easy to be with you  
  
Chorus  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Why were not in love  
  
Caught up over coffee then walked around town  
Some sidewalk singer was laying it down  
You started dancin right there on the curb  
Thought to myself man theres somethin bout her  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I been thinkin bout her  
Still cant tell ya why  
All I know is that its hard to say goodbye  
  
I got on that airplane you got in your car  
Looked out on that city wondering where you are  
And if youre feeling like me just a little bit sad  
I already miss you now whats up with that  
  
Chorus  
  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Why were not in love
