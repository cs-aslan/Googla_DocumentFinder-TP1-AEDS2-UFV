I stood in line at the corner store  
And I heard these guys talk about this girl  
Hey who gives them love anytime they want huh  
Then they said your name and how you carry on  
Your chain of fools is so long  
I thought our love was still on  
And so oh what a fool Ive been  
I thought I was your man and oh  
  
Chorus  
I wonder whos there loving you  
No one does you the way I do  
I wonder who whos there loving you  
And I really wonder who  
Its been so long  
Since youve called me yeah  
I thought our love was strong  
Just the way a love should be  
And now that youre gone  
I sit here and I wonder  
  
Bridge I  
Ive seen so many guys  
Take one look into your eyes  
And think theyre in paradise  
  
There was less than love in the things that woman said  
Now I wonder who put ideas in her head  
Im still in shock cause when I went back there again  
Shed changed her lock and said sorry you cant come in  
What a fool Ive been lookout  
I thought I was your man and oh ooh  
  
I wonder whos there loving you  
No one does you the way I do  
I wonder who whos there loving you  
And I really wonder who  
Its been so long  
Since youve called me yeah  
I thought our love was strong  
Just the way a love should be  
And now that youve gone  
I sit here and wonder  
  
Bridge II  
Ive seen so many guys  
Take that look into your eyes  
And think theyre in paradise  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Fade  
  
I dont wanna be in love if you dont love me  
And I love you so I betcha that you dont know  
And I wonder who   
I wonder I wonder  
  
And I wonder who thatcha got loving you  
And I wonder why youre with some other guy  
And I wonder who   
I wonder I wonder  
  
Dont wanna be a fool for no one you see  
And I want you so I bet you dont even know  
And I wonder who   
I wonder I wonder
