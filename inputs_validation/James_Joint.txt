Verse 1  
Id rather be smoking weed  
Whenever we breathe  
Everytime you kiss me  
Dont say that you miss me  
Just come get me  
  
Hook  
Dont know why just know I want to  
Dont know why just know I want you  
  
Verse 2  
Id rather be breaking things  
Cause we cant see  
Were too busy kissing  
Just making scenes  
Here come the police  
They know about your history  
How you live and love like fuck rules  
Dont care why just know I love you
