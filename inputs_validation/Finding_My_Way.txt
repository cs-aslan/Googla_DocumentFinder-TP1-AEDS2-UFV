Im coming out to get you  
Ooh sit down  
Im coming out to find you  
Ooh yeah Ooh yeah  
Finding my way

Ive lost count of the years  
Well I sang some sad songs  
Oh yes and cried some bad tears  
  
Look out Im coming  
Whoa whoa

Ooh sit down  
Im going by the back door  
Ooh yeah Ooh yeah  
Finding my way  
  
Youve done me no right  
But youve done me some wrong  
Left me lonely each night  
While I sing my sad song  
  
Look out Im coming
