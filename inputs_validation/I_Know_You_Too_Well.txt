Baby its nothing that youve said  
But I know its not just in my head  
Youre changing baby and you dont think I see  
I feel you drifting away a little bit further every day  
Dont tell me baby dont tell me its just me  
I see it in the look thats on your face  
Somethings not the same inside  
You cant keep it from me no matter how you try  
Cause I know you too well for you to ever think  
You could tell me a lie yes I know you too well  
No one knows you like I do and its so easy to tell  
When you look away theres something youre hiding  
I know you too well too well  
Maybe the timing isnt right  
Maybe I see the end in sight  
Is it over baby is it hurting you to stay  
Maybe you dont know what to do  
You cant find a way to break the news  
Think it over baby it hurts me more this way  
Id rather have you tell me to my face  
Than tell me every things all right  
What you dont wanna say is there in black and white  
Cause I know you too well for you to ever think  
You could tell me a lie yes I know you too well  
No one knows you like I do and its so easy to tell  
When you look away theres something youre hiding  
I know you too well too well  
Id rather have you tell me to my face  
Than tell me every things all right  
What you dont wanna say is there in black and white  
Cause I know you too well for you to ever think  
You could tell me a lie yes I know you too well  
No one knows you like I do and its so easy to tell  
When you look away theres something youre hiding  
I know you too well too well know you  
Cause I know you too well for you to ever think  
You could tell me a lie yes I know you too well  
No one knows you like I do and its so easy to tell  
When you look away theres something youre hiding  
I know you too well too well
