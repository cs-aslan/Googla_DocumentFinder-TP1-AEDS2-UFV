She make a train take a dirt road  
Make it stop on a dime  
Make em wonder which way to go  
Make a man change his mind  
  
Shes a lawyers queen a truckers dream  
With a baseball hat fit for a queen  
A genuine a different kind of fine  
  
Cadillacs and caviar  
Well that aint how she rolls  
Implants and tummy tucks  
She sure dont need those  
  
Shes a cool drink of water  
When the summers mean  
Poured into those Levis jeans  
Shes country as the day is long  
  
She make a train take a dirt road  
Make it stop on a dime  
Make em wonder which way to go  
Make a man change his mind  
  
Shes a lawyers queen and a truckers dream  
With a baseball hat fit for a queen  
A genuine a different kind of fine  
  
Tan and lean like a longneck bottle  
In the passenger seat  
Got her hand on the throttle  
Shell get you there right on time  
  
Lord take you down to Tijuana  
Make you wanna slap your momma  
Gotcha all tore up and made you spill your dip cup  
Bona fide a different kind of fine  
  
Make a train take a dirt road  
Make it stop on a dime  
Make em wonder which way to go  
Make a man change his mind  
  
Shes a lawyers queen and a truckers dream  
With a baseball hat fit for a queen  
A genuine a different kind of fine  
  
She make a train take a dirt road  
Make it stop on a dime  
She make em wonder which way to go  
Make a man change his mind  
  
A lawyers queen a truckers dream  
A baseball hat fit for a queen  
Genuine a different kind of fine  
Lord Lord
