And Im Im overjoyed  
And Im Im overloved  
And Im feeling lucky like a little boy  
Whos hiding under cover  
And looking to discover  
Every way to play the part inside this darkened cave  
The meaning of life well it starts at the nightlight  
Close your eyes and I hope you see mine  
And Ive well Ive seen a thousand things in one place  
But I stopped my counting when I saw your face  
Erasing memory well I feel as though Ive never seen a face before  
Until I saw your eyes  
And theyre smiling back at me through my tears  
Ive been counting all these years oh  
Suddenly the thousand things Ive seen were nothing more than dreams of  
Of you and me  
You and me  
Quietly at a standstill now  
Fortunately you will well youll kiss me I will  
I will kiss you back  
Oh the fact of the matter is  
And I dont know what the latter is oh no way  
See Ive always wanted to kiss you  
But I I always wanted to run from you  
Because Ive always wanted to miss you  
And I I always wanted to come for you  
Well I love my comfort foods you said  
While you always say How do you do
