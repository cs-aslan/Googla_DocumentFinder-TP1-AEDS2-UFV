What life is all about  
I  
Isnt it right that we be together  
Just like weve always been  
Isnt it time that we start tomorrow  
With what we have today  
Refrain  
Here we are we live we laugh and we cry  
We share the dream someday we may find  
A love that is true that will last for all time  
It seems what life is just all about  
Ii  
Isnt it love we need to believe in  
Whenever were in doubt  
It isnt hard to share what were feelin  
We just have to try  
Refrain  
Refrain  
Coda  
Lifes for you and I
