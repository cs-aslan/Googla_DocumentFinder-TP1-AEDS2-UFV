Do you or dont you want this to be your song  
It doesnt take a rebel to sing along  
This art is weak in its pretty pretty frame  
And Im your monkey with a misspelled name  
  
Ill put down your disco  
And take your heart away  
Ill put down your disco  
And take your heart away  
Ill be born again  
  
Im someone else Im someone new  
Im someone stupid just like you  
Im someone else Im someone new  
Im someone stupid just like you  
  
Do you dont you want to take this hit  
Does it make you feel like a part of it  
And Ill put down your disco  
And take your heart away  
Ill put down your disco  
And take your heart away  
Ill be born again  
  
Im someone else Im someone new  
Im someone stupid just like you  
Im someone else Im someone new  
Im someone stupid just like you  
Im someone else Im someone new  
Im someone stupid just like you  
Im someone else Im someone new  
Im someone stupid just like you  
  
The valley of the dolls  
Is the valley of the dead  
The valley of the dolls  
Is the valley of the dead  
  
Im someone else Im someone new  
Im someone stupid just like you  
Im someone else Im someone new  
Im someone stupid just like you  
Ill put down your disco  
And take your heart away  
Ill put down your disco  
And take your heart away  
Ill be born again  
Ill be born again  
Ill be born again  
Ill be born again
