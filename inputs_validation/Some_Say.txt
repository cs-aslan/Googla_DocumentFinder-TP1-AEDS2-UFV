Theres that star the one they said wed never reach  
And just close your eyes  
Theres the missing moon theres the Milky Way  
Heavens straight ahead Well be there today  
Rainbows right and left sunshine everywhere  
If it couldnt be baby how did we get here  
  
Some say well never get off the ground  
Some say well never make it out of town  
That someday well end up a world apart  
And some say were a couple crazy kids  
And some say thats exactly what they did  
And I say you got to go with your heart  
And baby look where we are  
  
Theres that home the one they said wed never share  
And just close your eyes  
Theres a picket fence theres our mailbox  
Puppy on the porch and roses up the walk  
Shinny new minivan kids in every seat  
Someday well look back and say it wasnt just a dream  
  
Some say well never get off the ground  
Some say well never make it out of town  
That someday well end up a world apart  
And some say were a couple crazy kids  
And some say thats exactly what they did  
And I say you got to go with your heart  
And baby look where we are  
  
Some say well never get off the ground  
Some say well never make it out of town  
That someday well end up a world apart  
And some say were a couple crazy kids  
And some say thats exactly what they did  
And I say you got to go with your heart  
And baby look where we are  
  
Some say oh oh  
Some say  
Some say yes they do some say  
Oooo Oooo Oooo Oooo  
Some say some say some say  
Some say someday some say
