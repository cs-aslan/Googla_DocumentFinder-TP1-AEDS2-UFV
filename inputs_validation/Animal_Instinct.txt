Dont ever take tour eyes off me  
Not even for a minute  
Cause like a panther I might pounce  
And that will be the limit  
  
I can be sneaky fast as a snake  
I strike like a cobra make no mistake  
And baby youll be trapped quick as a wink  
Its animal instinct  
  
Dont think that I wont pin you down  
No matter how you plead it  
Im like a lion whos been caged  
And you are gonna meet it  
  
Watch out Ill warn ya sharp as a hawk  
Im wild as a tiger I prowl and I stalk  
cause when a man feels thirst he takes a drink  
Its animal instinct  
  
You better not be caught off guard  
This wolf is on the search now  
A leopard just cant change its spots  
And Im about to lurch now  
I roar like the jungle I fight tooth and nail  
I just gotta get you youll fall without fail  
Im ready for the kill Im right on the brink  
Its animal instinct  
Its animal instinct animal instinct
