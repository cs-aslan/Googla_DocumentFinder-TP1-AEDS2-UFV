Simple matters always seem  
To make things complicated  
I think of ways to understand  
But it all gets away from me  
  
I sense persuasion of a kind  
It wraps itself around me  
The changing message of your love  
Rarely ever reaches me  
  
Not talking only want action  
Once you give in you are through  
This is the night of rebellion  
  
There used to be paint on the walls  
But youre too young for money  
Theyd rather paint the whole town red  
Than spend it on what theyre told  
  
Summer to winter is never the same  
If it is then its time to change  
I dont want to rock your sacred boat  
But theres holes in your sacred sails
