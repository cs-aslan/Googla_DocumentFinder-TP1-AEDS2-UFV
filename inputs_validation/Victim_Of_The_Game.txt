Well it took a little time  
But I guess you finally learned  
That promises get broken  
And bridges do get burned  
Youve been siftin through the ashes  
Just tryin to find a flame  
Holdin on to nothin  
Youre a victim of the game  
  
You were standin way too close  
To see it all fall apart  
And there were things you couldnt hear  
Cause you were listenin with your heart  
But you cant say I didnt warn you  
Now theres no one else to blame  
Theres on one quite as blind  
As a victim of the game  
  
And it dont matter who you are  
It treats everyone the same  
All you needs a heart  
To be a victim of the game  
  
You know its really gettin to you  
When you take to tellin lies  
And you can try to fool your friends  
But you cant look em in the eye  
There aint no standin tall  
In the shadow of the shame  
When everybody knows  
That youre a victim of the game  
  
And it dont matter who you are  
It treats everyone the same  
All you needs a heart  
To be a victim of the game  
  
Oh you know when I look into your eyes  
I can really feel the pain  
Starin in the mirror  
At a victim of the game
