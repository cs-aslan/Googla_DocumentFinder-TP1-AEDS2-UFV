Newborn babe  
Dont know nothing bout the ways of the world  
Or astronauts upon the moon or witches on brooms  
Newborn babe  
Dont know nothing bout the politics of people  
Or chess pieces or old churches  
You just know your mother  
  
Newborn babe  
Dont know nothing bout the way its gonna be  
Or clown faces or masterpieces  
Or love affairs or rocking chairs  
I see you sleeping away getting older every day  
  
Newborn babe  
Dont know nothing bout the way its gonna be  
Or clown faces or masterpieces  
Or love affairs or rocking chairs  
I see you sleeping away  
Oh youre getting older every day
