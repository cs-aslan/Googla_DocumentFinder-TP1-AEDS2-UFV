Hold me my daddy  
I never felt lower than dirt on the floor  
I say hold me my daddy  
I never felt like crying oceans before  
  
If this means war why are we in it  
Mightve fired off a couple of rounds I didnt mean to begin it  
If these are the bullets that every father and son must chew  
Well then hold me my daddy I forgot to say I love you  
  
Hold me my daddy  
It hurts me to see grown men fighting this way  
I say hold me my daddy  
The young and the old dog arent having their day  
  
This civil war why are we in it  
Theres nobody on this flat earth would ever want to win it  
If these are the hot coals that every father and son walks through  
Well then hold me my daddy I forgot to say I love you  
  
And if you agree we can make amends  
All this squabbling Ive hated  
In another time and another place where our history bends  
We couldve been the best of friends and not merely related  
  
Well these are the right words to say  
Theyre difficult but still true  
Well then hold me my daddy  
I forgot to say I love you  
  
Hold him Tight Hold him like he was a baby
