Senorita Im in trouble again and I cant get free  
Senorita Youre exactly what the doctor ordered come on talk to me  
Ah Cant crow before Im out of the woods  
But theres exceptions to the rule  
Ahah Senorita do you need a friend Im in love with you  
  
Catch as catch catch as catch can  
Anybody in their right mind could see its you and me  
Ooohoooooh  
Ooohoooh  
  
You say youre lonesome just getting by  
But you turn your eyes from me  
Be sure youre hurting long before you fly cause youve got me  
  
Catch as catch catch as catch can  
Anybody in their right mind could see you and me  
Catch as catch catch as catch can  
When I see you all your little guitars sing to me  
  
I can see you dont know which way to turn  
But the sun still shines  
Senorita Dont you know that you can dance with me anytime  
Ah Cant crow before Im out of the woods  
Theres exceptions to the rule  
Ahah Senorita do you need a friend Im in love with you  
  
Ooohoooooh  
Ooohoooh  
Ooohoooooh  
Ooohoooh  
Ooohoooooh  
Ooohoooh
