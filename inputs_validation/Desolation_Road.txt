Locked up on Monday  
Lord I lost my way  
I couldnt breathe her name  
You know shes after my life  
Lately Im stickin to drinkin  
And Im headed down desolation road  
Habit a growin  
Set it up just right  
I do away my life  
On a turn of the dice  
Lately Im runnin and hidin  
Slidin down desolation road  
lead  
No one to turn to  
Losing my best friend  
My name is just bad news  
And my accounts in the red  
Im in need of understandin  
Im landin in desolation road
