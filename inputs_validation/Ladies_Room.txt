Every time its the same  
What bothers me is my fame  
Youre what I need to play the game  
You say you like to dance  
Mmm I think Ill take a chance  
Ooh baby maybe its time for romance  
Youre such a jewel in the rough  
You wanna show me your stuff  
For my money you cant be too soon  
Meet meet you in the ladies room  
Meet meet you in the ladies room  
For my money you cant be too soon

Well its too late for you to get away  
And youve gotta believe me when I say
