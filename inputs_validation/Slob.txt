Leave  
Me alone  
I wont pick  
Up the phone  
  
And I wont listen to messages  
Sent by someone who calls up and says  
  
I dont like how  
Youre living my life  
Get yourself a wife  
Get yourself a job  
Youre living a dream  
Dont you be a slob  
  
Leave  
Me again  
Dont hang out  
In my den  
  
Waiting for little clues to appear  
That I drank some of grandaddys beer  
  
I dont like how  
Youre living my life  
Get yourself a wife  
Get yourself a job  
Youre living a dream  
Dont you be a slob  
Slob  
Slob  
  
Waiting for little clues to appear  
That I drank some of grandaddys beer  
  
I dont like how  
Youre living my life  
Get yourself a wife  
Get yourself a job  
Youre living a dream  
Dont you be a slob  
Slob  
Slob  
Slob
