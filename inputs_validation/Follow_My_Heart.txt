I saw you at midnight in a dream that I had  
From nowhere you stood there and you seemed so sad  
And a vicious decision is drivin me mad  
Should I follow my head or follow my heart  
  
You were different indifferent unbelievably cool  
I approached you to show you that Im nobodys fool  
And an error caused terror as I sensed your dare  
Should I follow my head or follow my heart  
  
Should I follow my head or follow my heart  
Youve got the lead baby Ive got a start  
Should I follow my head  
Should I follow my heart  
Should I follow my head or my heart  
Follow my heart
