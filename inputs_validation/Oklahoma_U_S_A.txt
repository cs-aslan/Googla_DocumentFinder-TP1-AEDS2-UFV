All life we work but work is bore  
If lifes for livin whats livin for  
She lives in a house thats near decay  
Built for the industrial revolution  
  
But in her dreams she is far away  
In Oklahoma USA  
With Shirley Jones and Gordon McRea  
As she buys her paper at the corner shop  
  
Shes walkin on the surrey with the fringe on top  
Cause in her dreams she is far away  
In Oklahoma USA  
She walks to work but shes still in a daze  
  
Shes Rita Hayworth or Doris Day  
And Errol Flynns gonna take her away  
To Oklahoma USA  
All life we work but work is a bore  
If lifes for livin then whats livin for
