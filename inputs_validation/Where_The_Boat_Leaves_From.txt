Theres a place where the boat leaves from  
It takes away all your big problems  
You got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean  
But you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from  
Take one part sand and one part sea one part shade of a  
Big palm tree  
The drinks theyre cold and the ladies are hot  
And I know this is the place for me  
  
So get away to where the boat leaves from  
It takes away all of your big problems  
You got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean  
But you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from  
  
See the problem is that youre down there  
And theres a perfectly good island somewhere  
Where a ride that floats and dont grab your coats  
You wont need them where we are going  
  
So get away to where the boat leaves from  
It takes away all of your big problems  
You got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean  
But you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from  
  
Pick me up  
Out on a boat that is huge  
Pick me up  
I dont know how to do  
Pick me up  
  
Put me down  
Down on the sand where its cool  
Put me down  
When I fall off my stool  
Put me down  
Ill just sleep there til morning comes around  
  
With sunshine and ladies and pina colodas  
And Bob Marley songs that are playing  
Theres a sound in my ear that I want you to hear  
Soft tropical lips that are saying  
  
Get away to where the boat leaves from  
It takes away all of your big problems  
You got worries you can drop them in the blue ocean  
But you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from
