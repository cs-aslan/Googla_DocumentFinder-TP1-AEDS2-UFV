Dont talk too fast to meslowI wanna know  
Share your philosophy before you goI wanna know  
If I knew better I wouldnt wanna say  
If I knew better I wouldnt let the words feel this way  
Cold so cold like I woke up on the street  
But isnt that the payback for being indiscreet  
If I knew better Id climb up on my ego like a child  
If I knew better Id knock down the flag  
on your shoulder thats Swaying  
If I knew betterI wouldnt change a thing  
So dont you talk so fast to me slow I wanna know
