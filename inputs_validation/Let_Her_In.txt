I didnt know how love would come around  
Walked right up to me and knocked me down  
I dropped straight down on my knees  
Asked my little girl honey wont you help me please  
  
Chorus  
Let her in  
Let my heart feel love again  
Let her in  
Dont you know how long its been  
Let her in  
Let come and be my friend  
Baby please wont you let her in  
  
I know its hard for you since your mamas been gone  
It must be strange to see me carry on  
Honey just try to understand  
It takes to the love of a woman to complete the heart of a man  
  
Chorus x3  
Let her in  
Let my heart feel love again  
Let her in  
Dont you know how long its been  
Let her in  
Let come and be my friend  
Baby please wont you let her in
