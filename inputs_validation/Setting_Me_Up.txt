You say Im the greatest bound for glory  
Well the word is out and I learned  
I got the latest side of the story  
Youre pulling out before you get burned  
Well your hands are squeezing me down to the bone  
I never saw you breaking no law  
Stands to reason Ive got to leave you alone  
What you take me for  
Youre setting me up to put me down  
Youre making me out to be your clown  
Youre just setting me up to put me down  
You better give it up  
Quit your messing around  
You think I care about your reaction  
You think I dont understand  
All you wanted was a piece of the action  
Now you talk about another man
