Some folks dream of the wonders theyll do  
Before their time on this planet is through  
Some just dont have anything planned  
They hide their hopes and theirs heads in the sand  
  
Now I dont say who is wrong who is right  
But if by chance you are here for the night  
Then all I need is an hour or two to tell the tale of a dreamer like you  
  
We all dream alot  
Some are lucky some are not  
But if you think it want it dream it  
Then its real  
You are what you feel  
  
But all that I say  
Can be told another way  
In the story of a boy whos dreams came true  
And he could be you
