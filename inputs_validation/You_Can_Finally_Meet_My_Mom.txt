Dont cry when I die  
When its my time I probably wont die  
Ill just lie down and close my eyes  
And think about stuff  
These eyes got too wide seen too much of lifes goodbyes  
Should have spent less time making loot  
And spent more time in my birthday suit with you  
  
And everybody upstairs everybody down stairs  
Im not gonna have time to hang out with them  
  
cause Ill be hanging out with you  
  
Not Jimi Hendrix Jesus or the dude  
Who played the sherriff in Blazing Saddles  
You not Chris Farley Mr Rodgers oh Ive waited so long  
You can finally meet my Mom  
  
Life is good but love its better  
Even Bieber aint forever  
We all got to go you know  
So you might as well go in style  
Everybody prayin everybody singing  
Im not gonna have time to hang out with them  
  
Cause Ill be hanging out with you  
  
Not Gilda Radner Buddha or the dude  
Who had pop rocks and soda at the same time  
You not Jesse James Paul Newman and oh Ive waited so long  
You can finally meet my Mom  
  
Im not making light of things  
But whos to say whos right with things like this  
Theres so much that we miss  
Tryin so hard to be rich and famous  
Pretty and thin to win  
Its a shame that youth is wasted on the young  
  
So forget everything and just be with me here now  
For as long as we can and whoever goes first save a spot  
  
You not Etta James Bob Marley or the girls who won my heart along the way  
You not Sitting Bull Ella or Bach and I almost forgot  
You can finally meet my Mom  
You can finally meet my Mom  
You can finally meet my Mom  
You can finally meet my Mom  
You can finally meet my Mom  
  
No Steve Jobs or Ty Cobbs Al Capone or any other mobs  
No Whitney Houstonno Chet Baker Andre the Giant or the Undertaker just you  
You can finally meet my Mom  
You can finally meet my Mom  
You can finally meet my Mom  
You can finally meet my Mom
