Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony  
Side by side on my piano keyboard oh Lord why dont we  
  
We all know that people are the same where ever we go  
There is good and bad in evryone  
We learn to live we learn to give  
Each other what we need to survive together alive  
  
Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony  
Side by side on my piano keyboard oh lord why dont we  
  
Ebony ivory living in perfect harmony  
Ebony ivory ooh  
  
We all know that people are the same where ever we go  
There is good and bad in evryone  
We learn to live we learn to give  
Each other what we need to survive together alive  
  
Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony  
Side by side on my piano keyboard oh lord why dont we  
  
Ebony ivory living in perfect harmony repeat and fade
