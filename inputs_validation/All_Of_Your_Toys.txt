Once upon a once in a while  
Its hard to remember to smile  
Just like all of your toys  
Cant you see I dont want to play  
I dont need it  
Cant you say you want me to stay  
Id believe it  
Just like all of your toys  
  
Chorus  
When all of your play things  
Someday disappear  
Girl will you be happy  
With nothing but tears  
With nothing but tears  
  
Once upon a once in a while  
Its hard to remember to smile  
Just like all of your toys  
Dont you ever feel kind of sad  
Cause youre lonely  
Think about the love that we had  
Are you lonely  
Just like all of your toys  
  
Chorus  
  
Ah  
Just like all of your toys I dont want to be  
Just like all of your toys I dont need to be  
Just like all of your just like all of your toys  
I should have known Id be alone  
No no no I dont need it  
Oh dont you have me believe it  
Just like all of your toys
