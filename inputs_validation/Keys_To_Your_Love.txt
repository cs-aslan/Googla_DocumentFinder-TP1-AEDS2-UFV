No matter where I go baby  
No matter what I do  
I spend my whole life honey  
Just thinking of you  
  
Yeah it dont seem to matter  
Whos right or whos wrong  
I want to tell you how I feel now  
Through the words of this song  
  
Try to lock me out  
I can always get in  
I got every combination  
Every code and every pin  
  
Yeah Im so crazy about you  
thats the word on the street  
I bet you hear all about it  
From the people you meet  
  
You know baby I put a spell on you  
Cant take it off  
Now their aint nothing you can do  
One night baby put a spell on you  
There aint nuthin that you gonna do  
  
I got the keys to your love  
I play the keys to you heart  
Yeah it sounds so sweet baby  
Wont stop once it starts  
  
I got the keys to your love  
I got the secret of your heart  
No matter were you go baby  
Were not too far apart  
  
Your all that I got  
Without you baby  
My lifes kinda shot  
I look for your face  
Cause no one else can  
fill this space  
  
I got the keys to your love  
I play the keys to you heart  
Yeah it sounds so sweet baby  
Wont stop once it starts  
  
I got the keys to your love  
I got the secret of your heart  
No matter were you go baby  
Were not too far apart
