Dont think you love me  
Confusion settling in  
I dont think Ill be staying  
Around here anymore  
  
Theres no question that I love you  
But Im living in my own time  
And here I am debating  
Whether Im wrong or right  
  
Who am I  
To make a judgment of  
Your life  
Im only  
Passing by  
Passing by  
  
All the promises I gave you  
Helped me to survive  
And all the times I wished youd save me  
You were the love of my life  
  
Who am I  
To make a judgment of  
Your life  
Im only  
Passing by  
Passing by  
  
Who am I  
To make a judgment of  
Your life  
Im only  
Passing by  
Passing by  
  
Who am I  
To make a judgment of  
Your life  
Im only  
Passing by  
Passing by  
  
Im only passing by
