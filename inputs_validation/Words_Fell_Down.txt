I wake up in the morning looking for reaction  
Then I see your faces only for fraction  
Did you hurt my feelings  You just nailed me to the wall  
  
Never say youre sorry never show emotion  
Never show a good hand never give a notion  
Dont you feel its obscene  Do you feel a thing at all   
  
Chorus  
cause you come right back with the same old story  
Words fell down  
Words fell down  
You walk right back to the sound of glory  
Words fell down  
Words fell down  
Oh oh oh its so helpless  
Oh oh oh its so helpless its so helpless  
  
Always a deceiver never any answers  
Living in the shadows taking any chances  
When you get a good line come and talk in to my face  
  
Chorus  
  
You fight right back with the same reaction  
Words fell down  
Words fell down  
The same old show with the same old caption  
Words fell down  
Words fell down  
Oh oh oh its so helpless  
Oh oh oh its so helpless its so helpless
