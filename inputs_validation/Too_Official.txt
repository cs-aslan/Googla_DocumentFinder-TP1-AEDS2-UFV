Give someone some piece of your mind  
Shine it shine what youve been assigned  
Has your identity sold out  
Sit in the back and make no sound  
  
This earth will swallow you down  
Honest it makes you sick  
You dont act on what you thinks right  
Honestly want to kick down doors that keep you in  
  
Let your hair down  
Sometimes relax your stiff posture  
Or so they say all work no play make you dull  
Chance to change the patterns were born to  
  
A fear of appearing too concerned  
Try to speak but the words just get stuck  
Honest it makes you sick  
You dont act on what you thinks right  
  
Honestly want to kick down doors that keep you in  
Each time you get to raise your hand for changes You dont know your luck  
So put yourself to use like  
  
You were taught by by your heroes  
You speak your mind thats something  
You speak your mind thats something  
We dont get it too often
