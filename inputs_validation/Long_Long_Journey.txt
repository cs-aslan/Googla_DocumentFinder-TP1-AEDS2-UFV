Sometimes I feel so weary  
Traveling through life all alone  
Sometimes I feel so weary  
Traveling through life all alone  
  
Its a long long journey  
And I cant make it on my own  
  
Theres seven million people  
Living right here in this town  
Theres seven million people  
Living right here in this town  
  
I dont need but one person  
So baby why wont you please stay around  
  
When the sun turns blue  
And the moon shines bright all day  
When the sun turns blue  
And the moon shines bright all day  
  
Thats the day sweet mama  
Ill let you run away  
  
When the rivers stop flowing  
And the trees lay down and die  
I said when the rivers stop flowing  
And the trees lay down and die  
  
When the stars stop shining  
Then Ill say my loves goodbye  
  
Now if Ive been misbehaving  
I promise you Ill stop  
But if you quit me mama  
I swear Ill blow my top  
  
Its a long long journey  
But Ill make it before Im blue  
This world cant throw me  
Mama if I still have you
