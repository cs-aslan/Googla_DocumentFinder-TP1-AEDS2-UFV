Things didnt work out the way you had planned it  
Things fell apart at the seams  
Whats yours is what you took with you  
And what you have has shattered their dreams  
  
And now youre cold and sleepy  
Christ how did it come to this  
Hold on to those you thought were your loved ones  
Theyll be the ones you miss  
  
And now youre standing at the station  
Tryin to take what I aint got to give  
Oh and Im so sorry Charlie  
Ive got my own life to live  
Just call your friends at college  
Wonder why you didnt stay  
And my boss is coming down soon Chuck  
Hes drunk so you cant stay  
No you cant stay  
  
You did nothing to deserve this  
God didnt treat you square  
Oh it all slipped through your fingers  
And it all seems so unfair  
  
And your girlfriend shes in high school  
She says she loves you a lot  
Lord knows she cant support you  
So you better sell more pot  
  
And now youre standing at the station  
Tryin to take what I aint got to give  
Oh and Im so sorry Charlie  
Ive got my own life to live  
So you just call your friends at college  
Wonder why you didnt stay  
And my boss is coming down soon Chuck  
Hes drunk and you cant stay  
No you cant stay  
  
Sorry Charlie  
Sorry Charlie  
Oww
