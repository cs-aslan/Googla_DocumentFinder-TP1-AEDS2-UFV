Verse 1  
Where can I find the city of shining light  
In an ordinary world  
How can I leave a buried treasure behind  
In an ordinary world  
The days into years roll by  
Its where that I live until I die  
Ordinary world  
  
Verse 2  
What would you wish if you saw a shooting star  
In an ordinary world  
Ive walked to the end of the earth and afar  
In an ordinary world  
Baby I dont have much  
But what we have is more than enough  
Ordinary world  
  
Verse 3  
Where can I find the city of shining light  
In an ordinary world  
How can I leave a buried treasure behind  
In an ordinary world  
Baby I dont have much  
But what we have is more than enough  
Ordinary world
