Whats a season in a right if you cant have anything  
Whats the reason in a rhyme if a plan means anything  
Whats the meaning in a crime its a fan if anything  
Wheres the meaning in a line Its a brand its a brand  
  
How a culture comes again its yesterday  
And you swear its not a trend doesnt matter anyway  
Theyre only here to talk to friends nothing new is everyday  
You could shit upon the stage theyll be fans  
Theyll be fans theyll be fans theyll be fans  
  
All the kids will eat it up if its packaged properly  
Steal a sound and imitate uniform and equally  
Not an ode just the facts where our world is nowadays  
An idea is what we lack it doesnt matter anyways
