I am your main man if youre looking for trouble  
I take no lip no ones tougher than me  
Id kick your face youd soon be seeing double  
Hey little girl keep your hands off me  
  
Im a rocker  
Im a rocker  
Im a roller too baby  
Im a rocker  
  
Down at the juke joint me and the boys were stompin  
Bippin an a boppin telling a dirty joke or two  
In walked this chick and I knew she was up to something  
and I kissed her right there out of the blue  
  
I said Hey baby meet me Im a tough guy  
Got my cycle outside you want to try  
She just looked at me and rolled them big eyes  
And said Ooh Id do anything for you cause youre a rocker  
  
Thats right Im a rocker  
Im a roller too honey  
Im a rocker  
  
I love to rock and roll  
I get my records and I Rock On stall  
rock and roll  
Teddy boy hes got them all  
  
I love to rock and roll  
I get my records and I Rock On stall  
sweet rock and roll  
Teddy boy hes got them all  
  
Im a rocker
