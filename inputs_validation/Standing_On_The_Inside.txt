Standin on the outside  
Lookin in  
You know its been a long time  
Dont know where to begin  
So much I want to say  
so much I want to do  
Friends are tellin me  
Its time that you broke through  
  
Ive been through the hard times  
Of searchin souls  
You know its been a hard climb  
From rock and roll  
Now I feel a need in me  
so hard to explain  
Now Ive seen the joy and light  
And I want to remain  
  
Standin on the inside  
I finally broke that line  
Ring around the circle  
Dont you know that it feels so fine  
Every waking moment  
I just want to sing the news  
That Im standin on the inside  
I kicked away them blues  
  
All the phony faces  
Stand in line  
All the backslappers  
Know my name this time  
Now that Ive turned the lock  
now that Ive opened the door  
I wont be on the outside  
not anymore not any more  
  
Standin on the inside  
I finally broke that line  
Ring around the circle  
Dont you know that it feels so fine  
Every waking moment  
I just want to sing the news  
That Im standin on the inside  
I pushed away them blues  
  
Now that Ive turned the lock  
now that Ive opened the door  
I wont be on the outside not anymore  
  
Standin on the inside  
I finally broke that line  
Ring around the circle  
Dont you know that it feels so fine  
Every waking moment  
I just wanna sing the news  
That Im standin on the inside  
I kicked away them blues  
  
Standin on the inside  
Standin on the inside  
I kicked kicked kicked it  
Standin on the inside  
Standin on the inside  
I kicked kicked
