I know I may be wishing  
On a world  
That may never be  
But Ill keep on wishing  
No matter how hopeless  
Or foolish  
It may seem  
Ill keep on wishing  
  
Ill toss my coins in the fountain  
Look for clovers in grassy lawns  
Search for shooting stars in the night  
Cross my fingers and dream on  
I know I may be dreaming  
Of a world  
Far from present day reality  
But Ill keep on dreaming  
  
No matter how unrealistic  
Or naive  
It may seem  
Always keep dreaming  
And toss your coins in the fountain  
Look for clovers in grassy lawns  
Search for shooting stars in the night  
Cross your fingers and dream on  
  
We must always be thinking  
Of a world  
As a place of infinite possibilities  
And always keep thinking  
No matter how hopeless  
Or foolish  
It may seem  
Always keep thinking  
  
And toss our coins in the fountain  
Look for clovers in grassy lawns  
Search for shooting stars in the night  
Cross our fingers and dream on  
Ill keep on wishing  
We must always keep dreaming  
Of a world  
  
With equality and justice  
Thinking  
There could be a world  
Without poverty and sickness  
Wishing  
Of a world  
  
Without hunger and homelessness  
Dreaming  
Of a world  
Where all people live in peace  
Dreaming  
Of a world  
Dreaming  
On a world
