Seems like lately were losin touch  
Work to hard and worry too much  
I think its time for me and you  
To get back to what we used to do  
  
Wed steal away on a Saturday night  
Meet in the field when the time was right  
Just us two and a starry sky  
Felt like paradise  
  
I said Ooh Baby goin down that road tonight  
I said its too crazy need to hold each other tight  
Thinkin maybe the moon stills shines as bright  
Like it did back then itll shine again  
Down that road tonight  
  
Remember all the songs that we used to know  
Dancin in the dark to the radio  
Lost in the rythmn kickin up some heat  
The memories are still so sweet  
  
Times gone by but its plain to see  
I still love you and you still love me  
Lets shake these troubles put em all aside  
seemon were gonna take that ride  
  
I said Ooh Baby goin down that road tonight  
I said its too crazy need to hold each other tight  
Thinkin maybe the moon stills shines as bright  
  
Like it did back then itll shine again  
Down that road tonight  
Down that road
