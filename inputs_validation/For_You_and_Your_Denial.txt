Its 4 am you call to spit some fire out  
But did you think that I would listen to you now  
Its nothing new so get in line with all the rest  
And I will wait till you realize youre out of breath  
  
Can you hear the crowd  
They all go wild  
For you and your denial  
Theyre watching you break down break down  
Hate me all you want  
Ill be okay  
Im half the world away  
Im letting you go now go now  
  
Youve got sadness twisted up with jealousy  
You show your fists to make them look like loyalty  
And I have seen what holding on can take away  
If its the past you love then thats where you can stay  
  
Can you hear the crowd  
They all go wild  
For you and your denial  
Theyre watching you break down break down  
Hate me all you want  
Ill be okay  
Im half the world away  
Im letting you go now go now  
Go now go now  
  
Desperation kills  
But when its on your sleeve you wear it well  
Underneath it all  
Youll always have this war inside yourself  
  
Im letting you go now go now  
Can you hear the crowd  
They all go wild  
For you and your denial  
Theyre watching you break down break down  
Hate me all you want  
Ill be okay  
Im half the world away  
Im letting you go now go now  
Go now go now  
Go now go now  
Go now go now
