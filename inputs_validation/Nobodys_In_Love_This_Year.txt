We keep walking away for no reason at all  
And no one says a word  
We were always so busy protecting ourselves  
We never would have heard  
And the rate of attrition for lovers like us  
Is steadily on the rise  
Nobodys in love this year  
Not even you and I  
  
Due to lack of commitment on both of our parts  
Were going our separate ways  
This show of indifference is breaking our hearts  
Its making us crazy yeah  
You sit back and wait for your love to accrue  
Youll be waiting a long long time  
Nobodys in love this year  
Not even you and I  
  
Chorus  
I dont want to be Mr Vulnerable  
I dont want to get hurt  
I dont want to be Mr Vulnerable  
I dont want to be the one who gets left behind  
  
We keep walking away for no reason at all  
For the sake of being free  
No ones invested enough of themselves  
To yield to maturity  
And the rate of attrition for lovers like us  
Is steadily on the rise  
Nobodys in love this year  
Nobody wants to try  
Nobodys in love this year  
Not even you and I  
  
Chorus
