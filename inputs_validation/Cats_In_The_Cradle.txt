My child arrived just the other day  
Came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  
He was talkin fore I knew it  
And as he grew he said  
Im gonna be like you Dad  
You know Im gonna be like you  
  
Chorus  
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man n the moon  
When you comin home  
Son I dont know when Well get together then  
You know well have a good time then  
  
Well my son turned ten just the other day  
He said Thanks for the ball Dad Come on lets play  
Could you teach me to throw  
I said Not today I got a lot to do  
He said Thats okay And he walked away and he smiled and he said  
You know Im gonna be like him yeah  
You know Im gonna be like him  
  
Chorus  
Well he came from college just the other day  
So much like a man I just had to say  
Im proud of you Could you sit for a while  
He shook his head and he said with a smile  
What Id really like Dad is to borrow the car keys  
See you later Can I have them please   
  
Chorus  
Ive long since retired my sons moved away  
I called him up just the other day  
Id like to see you if you dont mind  
He said Id love to Dad if I could find the time  
You see my new jobs a hassle and the kids have the flu  
But its sure nice talkin to you Dad  
Its been sure nice talkin to you  
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me  
Hed grown up just like me  
My boy was just like me  
  
Chorus
