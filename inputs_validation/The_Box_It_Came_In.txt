My clothes are all ragged my goodwill coats not the best  
And Im a walking on cardboard in my last dollar dress  
I looked in the closet for my wedding gown  
But the box that it came in was all that I found  
He took everything with him that wasnt nailed down  
Bet hes got a new sweetheart to fill my wedding gown  
But somewhere Ill find him then Ill have peace of mind  
And the box he comes home in will be all satin lined
