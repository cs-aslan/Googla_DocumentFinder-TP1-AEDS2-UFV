Every little moment  
Oh she dreams of you  
Half a million miles of love come true  
How can you mend all the heartaches youve made   
  
What is easy for two is so hard for one  
What is gonna happen when the summers gone   
How can you mend all the heartaches that youve made   
Baby how can you mend all the heartaches that youve made   
  
Someone is breaking Angies heart  
What about the thing called love   
Hes breaking Angies heart  
Her heart her heart  
  
Someone is breaking Angies heart  
One night is not enough  
Everybody got to believe in someone  
Ooh Angie  
  
Angie there will never be another you  
If it doesnt fit that your dreams come true  
How can he mend all the heartaches he has made   
Tears of love you wasted for this love affair  
  
And his love will really hurt you oh to care  
How can he mend all the heartaches he has made   
Baby how can he mend all the heartaches he has made
