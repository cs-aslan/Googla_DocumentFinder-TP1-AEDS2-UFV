Well I hope that I dont fall in love with you  
Cause falling in love just makes me blue  
Well the music plays and you display  
Your heart for me to see  
I had a beer and now I hear you  
Calling out for me  
And I hope that I dont fall in love with you  
  
Well the room is crowded people everywhere  
And I wonder should I offer you a chair  
Well if you sit down with this old clown  
Take that frown and break it  
Before the evenings gone away  
I think that we could make it  
And I hope that I dont fall in love with you  
  
Well the night does funny things inside a man  
These old tomcat feelings you dont understand  
Well I turn around to look at you  
You light a cigarette  
I wish I had the guts to bum one  
But weve never met  
And I hope that I dont fall in love with you  
  
I can see that you are lonesome just like me  
And it being late youd like some some company  
Well I turn around to look at you  
And you look back at me  
The guy youre with has up and split  
The chair next to yous free  
And I hope that you dont fall in love with me  
  
Now its closing time the musics fading out  
Last call for drinks Ill have another stout  
Well I turn around to look at you  
Youre nowhere to be found  
I search the place for your lost face  
Guess Ill have another round  
And I think that I just fell in love with you
