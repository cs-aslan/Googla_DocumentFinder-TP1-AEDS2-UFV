I can tell by your eyes that youve probably been cryin forever  
And the stars in the sky dont mean nothin to you theyre a mirror  
I dont want to talk about it how you broke my heart  
If I stay here just a little bit longer  
If I stay here wont you listen to my heart whoa my heart  
  
If I stand all alone will the shadows hide the colors of my heart  
Blue for the tears black for the night  
The stars in the sky dont mean nothin to you theyre a mirror  
I dont want to talk about it how you broke my heart  
If I stay here just a little bit longer  
If I stay here wont you listen to my heart whoa my heart  
My heart this so heard  
I dont want to talk about it how you broke my heart  
  
If I stay here just a little bit longer  
If I stay here wont you listen to my heart whoa my heart  
My heart whoa my heart
