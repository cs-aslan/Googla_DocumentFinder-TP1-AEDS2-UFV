Please please please dont leave me now girl  
After all Ive done for you  
On my knees here lets work it out woman  
After all that weve been through  
  
I told you that everyone cheats everyone lies  
Everyone suffers and everyone cries  
Old people laugh young people try  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes  
Everyone cheats everyone lies  
Everyone hustles and everyone strives  
Bad people win good people die  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes  
  
Hush your mouth girl  
Settle down woman  
Cause you dont make no sense  
Make up your mind girl  
Come around now  
Come down from off that fence  
  
Dont you know everyone cheats everyone lies  
Everyone suffers and everyone cries  
Old people laugh young people try  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes  
Everyone cheats everyone lies  
Everyone hustles and everyone tries  
Bad people win good people die  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes  
  
Watch your temper girl  
Calm your nerves down  
Better watch how you react  
Put your hands down  
Back up off me woman  
Cause you might get touched back  
  
Everyone cheats everyone lies  
Everyone suffers and everyone cries  
Old people laugh and young people try  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes  
Everyone cheats everyone lies  
Everyone hustles and everyone strives  
Bad people win good people die  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes  
  
When they look in your eye  
When they look in your eyes  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes
