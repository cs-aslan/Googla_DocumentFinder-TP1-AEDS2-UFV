Ill tell you what you wanna know  
But boy you better listen close  
People gonna tell you lies  
Dont let it come as a surprise  
  
That womans on my back again  
I know shes got the best intentions  
When you begin to realize  
You know you got your daddys eyes  
  
And theres something that I want to say  
I love her too  
And all of this has got nothing to do with you  
  
And Id like to stay but I cant because  
Ive been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me  
  
When you put it on the other hand  
  
When youre old enough to understand  
That glove will bring it all to life  
I didnt say that made it right  
  
Because that womans on my back again  
I know shes got the best intentions  
When you begin to realize  
You know you got your daddys eyes  
  
And theres something that I want to say  
I love her too  
And all of this has got nothing to do with you  
  
And Id like to stay but I cant because  
Ive been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me  
  
And Id like to stay but I cant because  
Ive been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me  
  
And sometimes people get tired  
And I woke up a little too late to lie  
  
Dreams should last a long time  
This is not what Id call goodbye  
  
And Id like to stay but I cant because  
Ive been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me  
  
And Id love to stay but I cant because  
Ive been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me me  
  
I love her too
