I I hear the mighty engines roar  
And I unleash the savage dogs of war  
Ooh Im the outlaw that rides  
  
White anglo saxon a violent reaction  
Fire is my fuel steel and iron rule  
  
Ride on wasteland  
A madmans badland  
Ride on wasteland  
And I will survive to show no mercy  
  
I can feel the cycles as they turn  
And I can smell the bodies as they burn  
Ooh the citys on fire  
  
White anglo saxon a violent reaction  
Fire is my fuel steel and iron rule  
  
Ride on wasteland  
A madmans badland  
Ride on wasteland  
And I will survive to show no mercy  
  
Pain and hunger all across then thunder  
Life is for the biggest its survival of the fittest  
  
Ride on wasteland show no mercy  
A madmans badland on you  
Ride on wasteland show no mercy  
A madmans badland on you on you on you
