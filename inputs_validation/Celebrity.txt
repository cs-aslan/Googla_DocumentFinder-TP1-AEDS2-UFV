Chorus  
If I wasnt a celebrity  
Would you be so nice to me  
If I didnt have cheese like everyday  
Would you still want to be with me  
If I couldnt by you diamond rings and all those other expensive things  
Would you be so into me  
If I wasnt a celebrity  
  
Lately I done a little thinking about the things that saterfie you  
Its making me wonder about the things that you do see in me  
I hate the way you like to say  
The mans a celebrity  
Baby whats the deal  
I thought you wanted me for me  
you gotta say what you mean  
you gotta mean what you say  
cause you keep pusing me away  
And I aint got no time to play  
So I say

Having a good timeliving the life that I made out for me  
Causin the splurges  
Spendin my money on everything you see  
It could be different  
We could have something  
Mabey like a job  
  
You got to get your thing together
