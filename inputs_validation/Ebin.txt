You could hear the fuckin fleas crawlin on my nuts  
  
Out my window cool and bright  
Fade so slowly into night  
Funny how things look the same  
Now that my friend Ebins changed  
  
Ebin was a cooly that I used to know  
Now hes down with the PLO  
Hes cold kickin it live with the KKK  
No XXX no JFA  
  
Cooly was sportin black denim shoes  
Dealing he was looking for something to use  
With a pistol in his pocket and a bottle of booze  
Well it could be me or it could be you  
Oh feels like my whole life is rearranged  
  
Oh Ebin you changed  
Ebin Ebin Ebin Ebin you  
Oh how you changed  
Oh you changed  
Oh how you changed  
  
I give you a hard time didnt want to stay  
Got outta jail just the very next day  
Its plain to see my friend Ebin is a Nazi  
He was a Nazi yeah yeah yeah  
  
Hooked on crack just the other day  
Now hes down with the CIA  
We got covert operation in Vietnam  
Making hits and assassination hes long gone  
  
He went down to protect his country  
Eat Mexican food and makes lots o money  
Come back a God and drive a big white car  
And take himself a plane down to Nicaragua  
Well it feels like Im the only one to blame  
  
Oh Ebin you changed  
Ebin Ebin Ebin Ebin you  
Oh you changed  
Oh you changed  
Oh how you changed  
  
I give you a hard time didnt want to stay  
Got outta jail just the very next day  
Its plain to see my friend Ebin is a Nazi  
He was a Nazi yeah yeah yeah  
  
Out my window cool and bright  
Day so slowly into night  
Funny how things look the same  
Now that my friend Ebins changed
