Its automatic  
I need to unload  
Under the pressure  
Gone middle of the road  
Fall into fashion  
Fall out again  
We stick together  
Cause it never ends  
  
Here comes a low  
Im a boy and youre a girl  
Here comes a high  
The only ones in the world  
Here comes everything  
You and me can work it out  
Here it comes  
You me well work it out  
  
Here comes tomorrow

We stick together  
Gone middle of the road  
Cause thats entertainment  
Its the sound of the wheel  
It rolls on forever  
You know how good it feels  
  
Here comes a low  
Im a boy and youre a girl  
Here comes a high

Here comes everything  
Were like monkeys out in the space  
Here it comes  
We are members of the human race  
You me well work it out  
  
Its automatic  
I need to unload  
Under the pressure  
Gone middle of the road

Fall out again  
We stick together  
Cause it never ends

Im a boy and youre a girl  
Here comes a high  
Youre the only one thats in the world
