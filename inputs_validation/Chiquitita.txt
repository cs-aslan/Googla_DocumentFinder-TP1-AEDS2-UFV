Chiquitita tell me whats wrong  
Youre enchained by your own sorrow  
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
How I hate to see you like this  
There is no way you can deny it  
I can see that youre oh so sad so quiet  
  
Chiquitita tell me the truth  
Im a shoulder you can cry on  
Your best friend Im the one you must rely on  
You were always sure of yourself  
Now I see youve broken a feather  
I hope we can patch it up together  
  
Chiquitita you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars theyre leaving  
Youll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song Chiquitita  
  
So the walls came tumbling down  
And your loves a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle  
Chiquitita tell me the truth  
There is no way you can deny it  
I see that youre oh so sad so quiet  
  
Chiquitita you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars theyre leaving  
Youll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song Chiquitita
