Dont you know we got smart bombs  
Its a good thing that our bombs are clever  
Dont you know that the smart bombs are so clever  
They only kill bad people now  
Dont you know though our kids are dumb  
We got smart bombs what a joyous thing now  
Here we go so lets drink a toast  
To those clever bombs and the men who built them  
  
There they go now there go all my friends  
There they go now marching off to war again  
Smiling proudly with their heads in the clouds  
  
Yeah yeah yeah

Here we go watch the bad guys get their butts kicked  
Really makes me feel good  
Here we go watching CNN the adrenaline rushes through my veins now  
Dont you know its a feelgood show electronic bliss  
Its a video video  
  
There they go now there go all my friends  
There they go now marching off to war again  
With their bright flags waving in the wind  
There they go now marching off to war again  
Smiling proudly with their heads in the clouds
