If there isnt light when no one sees  
Then how can I know what you might believe  
A story told that cant be real  
Somehow must reflect the truth we feel yeah  
  
Fade away fade away  
Vanish into small  
Fade away fade away  
Break the crystal ball oh  
  
Its the sign  
Feels like the time  
  
On a small world west of wonder  
Somewhere nowhere all  
Theres a rainbow that will shimmer  
When the summer falls  
If an echo doesnt answer  
When it hears a certain song  
Then the beast is free to wander  
But never is seen around  
  
And its the sign of the southern cross  
Its the sign of the southern cross  
All right  
Sail away  
To the sign  
Oh  
  
From the book the word is spoken  
Whispers from forgotten psalms  
Gather all around the young ones  
They will make us strong  
Reach above your dreams of pleasure  
Given life to those who died  
Look beyond your own horizons  
Sail the ship of signs  
  
And its the sign of the southern cross  
Its the sign of the southern cross  
Fade away fade away  
Break the crystal ball  
Fade away fade away  
I cant accept it anymore  
  
On a real world west of wonder  
Somewhere nowhere all  
Theres a rainbow see it shimmer  
When the summer falls  
From the book the word is spoken  
Whispers from forgotten psalms  
Gather all around the young ones  
They will make us strong  
  
Its the sign of the southern cross  
Its the sign of the southern cross  
  
Dont live for pleasure  
Make life your treasure  
Fade away  
Eight miles high about to fall  
And no one there to catch you  
Look for the sign the time  
The sign of the southern cross yeah
