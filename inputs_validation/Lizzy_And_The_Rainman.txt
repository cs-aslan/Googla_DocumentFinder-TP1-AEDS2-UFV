He came riding in on a sunrise  
A hot west Texas day  
A fancy man in a painted wagon  
Some fancy things to say  
Looks like you folksll need some water  
Well water is my game  
For the small price of a hundred dollars  
I bet you I can make it rain  
So get away all nonbelievers or the rainll never come  
Someone start a fire burning somebody beat the drum  
Some may think Im crazy for making all these claims  
But I swear before the day is over your folksll see some rain  
They all just stood a staring trying to believe  
But there was one named Lizzy Cooper said he was a lying cheat  
She said you call yourself a rainman well you oughta be ashamed  
For starting all these people dreaming thinking you can make it rain  
So get away all nonbelievers or the rainll never come  
Someone keep the fire burning somebody beat the drum  
Some may think Im crazy for making all these claims  
But I swear before the day is over your folksll see some rain  
Oh Lizzy a mans gotta have a dream  
And if you can walk on the inside with me  
Ill meet you in between  
Come with me Lizzy  
And the starsll write your name  
And if you still think Im lying to you  
Look yonder here comes the rain  
So get away all nonbelievers or the rainll never come  
Someone keep the fire burning somebody beat the drum  
Some may think Im crazy for making all these claims  
But I swear before the day is over your folksll see some rain  
So get away all nonbelievers or the rainll never come  
Someone keep the fire burning somebody beat the drum  
Some may think Im crazy for making all these claims  
But I swear before the day is over your folksll see some rain
