Gotta make sure these words are understandable  
Cause its a motherfucking shame all these short  
Comings in the game hoe ass niggas hoe ass bitches  
Know Im saying  
  
Im still King of the Ghetto aint a damn thang changed  
Still sip out the prescription bottle with hydro on my brain  
It help a nigga make it through the drama swear to God  
I be feeling like busting heads and relocate to the Bahamas  
But I dont want to be a runaway I love my block  
But I cant seem to put my gun away friends be killing friends  
So I dont make no ends with nobody I know  
Cause if nobody gets nervous then nobodys gotta go  
Thats the GCode and I will busting simply then I will reload  
Sick of all of this gun bumping from you people  
Turning a Christian into someone who is evil ZRo  
Motherfuckers all up in my business broadcasting my life  
Presidential Records suing ZRo and his pockets aint right  
Why they want to spread rumors bout Ro Dog  
Turn me to a menace to society like ODog  
  
Chorus  
Its a shame the way they fuck around with my mind  
Its a shame the way they try to hurt me  
Its a shame the way they got me walking round with my nine  
Raised on game a soldier thats showing no mercy  
  
When I wake up I be wishing to find another way to make a living  
Baking a cake back in the kitchen got my palms itching  
Scratch that with a fat stack of Benjamin Franklin yall better  
Back back trying to get my stack I got a black mack in a black backpack  
I know you jealous niggas hate me cause I shine  
They know I be rolling one deep trying to follow behind  
I gotta handle my business by myself cause Im alone  
Really nothing to live fo no more wife no more kids at home  
Aint that a shame Im losing everything I love  
When they fuck up its okay but when its me they hold a grudge  
You think I aint know you was fucking over ZRo  
With Lil Shannon around the time your vehicle was reposed  
My love for you was that of a mother one I never had  
I know we could never be again Im forever sad  
But a hustler gotta keep hustling  
Until then ITen drug smuggling  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes I be wondering if Im ever gon make it  
Ducking and dodging poverty am I ever gon shake it  
Every nigga I deal with keeps saying they down  
Why my money be funny every time it be coming round  
I told him tell em twentyfive hundred he told em three thousand  
Making me miss out on money Sam gon witness me clowning  
When you give a nigga a inch they try to take the whole ruler  
After my inches nothing but the fortyfour rugger  
Who am I ZRo the Crooked Im not a hoe  
But instead of busting your head Ima go on and let you go  
Ima receive my blessing better believe my weapon  
Is a first from the basic instructions before leaving earth  
The bible and if we follow it properly its survival  
We gotta listen sometimes even though we want to all shine  
And glisten sometimes remember we on a heavenly mission sometimes  
  
Chorus  
  
One love to my motherfucking soldier niggas  
JPimp my nigga Rice aka sliding up under something  
When they get outta line
