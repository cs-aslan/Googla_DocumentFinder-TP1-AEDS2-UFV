Only name Table Rogers a share man am I  
On a threemasted schooner from Twelingate Isle  
Ive been the world over North South East and West  
But the middle of nowheres where I likes it best  
  
Where its wave over wave sea over bow  
Im as happy a man as the sea will allow  
Theres no other life for a sailor like me  
Than to sail the salt sea boys to sail the sea  
Theres no other life but to sail the salt sea  
  
Well I leave my wife lonely ten months of the year  
For she built me a home and raised my children Dere  
She never come out to bid farewell to me  
Or can why a sailor must sail the salt sea  
  
Where its wave over wave sea over bow  
Im as happy a man as the sea will allow  
Theres no other life for a sailor like me  
Than to sail the salt sea boys to sail the sea  
Theres no other life but to sail the salt sea  
  
Oh the work it is hard and the hours are long  
But my spirit is willing my back it is strong  
And when the works over the whisky will pour  
Well dance with the girls upon some foreign shore  
  
Ive sailed the world over for decades or more  
And oft times I wonder what I do it for  
I dont know the answer its pleasure and pain  
But with life to live over Id do it again  
  
Where its wave over wave sea over bow  
Im as happy a man as the sea will allow  
Theres no other life for a sailor like me  
Than to sail the salt sea boys to sail the sea  
Where its wave over wave sea over bow  
Im as happy a man as the sea will allow  
Theres no other life for a sailor like me  
Than to sail the salt sea boys to sail the sea  
Theres no other life but to sail the salt sea  
Ohh ohhhh
