When youre lost in the rain in Juarez  
And its Easter time too  
And your gravity fails  
And negativity dont pull you through  
  
Dont put on any airs  
When youre down on rue morgue avenue  
They got some hungry women there  
And they really make a mess out of you  
  
Now if you see Saint Annie  
Please tell her thanks a lot  
I cannot move  
My fingers are all in a knot  
  
I dont have the strength  
To get up and take another shot  
And my best friend my doctor  
Wont even say what it is I have got  
  
Sweet Melinda  
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom  
She speaks good English  
And she invites you up into her room  
  
And youre so kind  
And careful not to go to her too soon  
And she takes your voice  
And leaves you howling at the moon  
  
Up on housing project hill  
Its either fortune or fame  
You must pick one or the other  
Though neither of them  
  
Are to be what they claim  
If youre looking to get silly  
You better go back from where you came  
Because the cops dont need you  
And man they expect the same  
  
Now all the authorities  
They just stand around and boast  
Hew they blackmailed the sergeant at arms  
Into leaving his post  
  
And picking up angel who  
Just arrived here from the coast  
Who looked so fine at first  
But left looking like a ghost  
  
I started out on burgundy  
But soon hit the harder stuff  
Everybody said theyd stand behind me  
When the game got rough  
  
But the joke was on me  
There was nobody even there to bluff  
Im going back to New York City  
I do believe Ive had enough
