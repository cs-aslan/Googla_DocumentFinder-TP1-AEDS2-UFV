Oh gi ran ja ran ja ja ran  
  
Tonight  
Ill hold myself tight  
I wont fight I wont fight  
Then I whisper to me  
Then I whisper to me  
Then I ll lay right down  
And I ll lay right down  
On my back  
On my bed  
In my hotel  
And Ill be in love  
  
Well all night all night  
And in the mornin Ill be ready  
To see you to see you  
Dont forget to come  
Room 121  
Dont forget to come  
Ill be shakin Ill be tremblin  
Ill be happy Ill be weak  
And lill love you and lill love you  
And well fall to sleep  
Well fall to sleep  
Six oclock dong dong  
Real far real far  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye
