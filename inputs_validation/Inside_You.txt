All I ever get from you  
Are attitudes and broken rules but  
I just wanna feel your love beside me  
A new day is gonna come  
Together to sing my song  
Got to feel the melody inside you  
I wanna be I wanna be inside you  
I wanna feel I wanna feel inside you  
Loves fire burnin in my brain  
Loves fire gonna drive me insane  
I wanna be I wanna be inside you  
Since your flowing through my veins  
I aint never felt the same  
Feels like a whole new world inside me  
Im never gonna let you go  
Gotta let your feelings show  
Never never leave the love inside you  
I wanna be I wanna be inside you  
I wanna feel I wanna feel inside you  
Loves fire burnin in my brain  
Loves fire gonna drive me insane  
I wanna be I wanna be inside you  
Nothing could ever take you away from me  
No one would ever take me yeah yeah inside of you  
I wanna be I wanna be inside you  
I wanna feel I wanna feel inside you  
I wanna be inside you  
I wanna be inside you  
I wanna be inside you  
I wanna be inside you  
I wanna be inside you
