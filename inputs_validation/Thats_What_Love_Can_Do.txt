I wanted a lover  
To show me the way love goes  
To know what it felt like  
To let something take control  
To live the expression  
Im head over heels this time  
Unafraid to be open  
And thinking Id be just fine  
But I found in the very end  
That it all depends  
  
Cause love can lift you so high  
Or itll leave you to die  
And its not like you ever get to choose  
Which way that it leads you  
Ooh it can play with your mind  
Or make you feel so alive  
Either way youll survive cause  
Thats what love can do  
Ohh yeah yeah  
Thats what love can do  
  
I guess now I get why  
They say love is a dangerous game  
Cause when you think that youre winning  
You find out that you just been played  
You give and you sacrifice  
You make changes in your life  
Everyones got advice  
But no ones got a clue not even you  
And I found in the very end  
That it all depends  
  
Cause love can lift you so high  
Or itll leave you to die  
And its not like you ever get to choose  
Which way that it leads you  
Ooh it can play with your mind  
Or make you feel so alive  
Either way youll survive cause  
Thats what love can do  
Ooh ohh ooh  
Thats what love can do  
  
Im dreaming Im dreaming  
Dreaming of when I believed in  
Fairy tales sunset sails it never fails  
Til reality sets in  
I begin to comprehend how crazy this has been  
And I cant depend on  
Anyone for my happily ever after  
Yeah yeah  
  
Cause love can lift you so high  
Or itll leave you to die  
And its not like you ever get to choose  
Which way that it leads you  
Ooh it can play with your mind  
Make you feel so alive  
Either way youll survive cause ohh  
Thats what love can do  
Thats what love can do ohh  
Cause thats what love can do ohh yeah  
  
Ohh ooh hey  
It can tear you apart  
And its broken broken my heart  
Thats what love can do  
Ooh
