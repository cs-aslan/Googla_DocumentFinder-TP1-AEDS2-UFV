Doesnt it look good for flying  
Cant wait for high noon to fall into night  
Put out my arms the air just takes me  
Rising moon calls me into the sky  
  
Up up I go  
Searching on my radio  
  
Pilot through time  
Spirit flying  
Move with mine  
Out of time  
  
Pilot I fell through  
From the blue  
I just flew  
Into you  
  
If the air is high and I hear the moon  
Ill find you alright  
Wherever youre hiding in the night  
I know it wont be long  
Your signals getting strong  
  
Pilot through time  
Spirit flying  
Move with mine  
Out of time  
  
Pilot I fell through  
From the blue  
I just flew  
Into you
