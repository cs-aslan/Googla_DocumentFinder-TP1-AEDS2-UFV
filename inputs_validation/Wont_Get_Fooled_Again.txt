Well be fighting in the streets  
With our children at our feet  
And the morals that they worship will be gone  
And the men who spurred us on  
Sit in judgment of all wrong  
They decide and the shotgun sings the song  
Ill tip my hat to the new constitution  
Take a bow for the new revolution  
Smile and grin at the change all around  
Pick up my guitar and play  
Just like yesterday  
Then Ill get on my knees and pray  
We dont get fooled again  
The change it had to come  
We knew it all along  
We were liberated from the fold thats all  
And the world looks just the same  
And history aint changed  
Cause the banners they are flown in the next war  
Ill tip my hat to the new constitution  
Take a bow for the new revolution  
Smile and grin at the change all around  
Pick up my guitar and play  
Just like yesterday  
Then Ill get on my knees and pray  
We dont get fooled again   
No no Ill move myself and my family aside  
If we happen to be left half alive  
Ill get all my papers and smile at the sky  
Though I know that the hypnotized never lie  
Do ya  
Theres nothing in the streets  
Looks any different to me  
And the slogans are replaced bythebye  
And the parting on the left  
Are now parting on the right  
And the beards have all grown longer overnight  
Ill tip my hat to the new constitution  
Take a bow for the new revolution  
Smile and grin at the change all around  
Pick up my guitar and play  
Just like yesterday  
Then Ill get on my knees  
And pray We dont get fooled again Dont get fooled again No no  
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah Meet the new boss Same as the old boss
