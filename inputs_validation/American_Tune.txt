Manys the time Ive been mistaken and many times confused  
Yes and Ive often felt forsaken and certainly misused  
Oh but Im alright Im alright just weary to my bones  
Still you dont expect to be bright and bon vivant  
So far away from home so far away from home  
  
Dont know a soul who has not been battered  
Dont have a friend who feels at ease  
I dont know a dream thats not been shattered or driven to its knees  
Oh but its alright its alright for weve lived so well so long  
Still when I think of the road were traveling on I wonder whats gone wrong  
I cant help it I wonder whats gone wrong  
  
And I dreamed I was dying I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly  
Looking back down at me smiled reassuredly  
I dreamed I was flying high up above my eyes could clearly see  
The statue of liberty sailing away to sea  
And I dreamed I was flying  
  
We come on the ship they call the Mayflower come on the ship that sails the
moon  
We come in the ages most uncertain hours and sing an American tune  
Oh but its alright its alright cant be forever blessed  
Still tomorrows gonna be another working day and Im trying to get some rest  
Thats all Im trying to get some rest
