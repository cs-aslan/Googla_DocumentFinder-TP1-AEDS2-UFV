Morning comes into my room through pretty purple curtains  
And looks upon a man so satisfied  
I hold a woman in my arms and watch her while shes sleeping  
And I know that Im the man on Susies mind  
Im the pretty dress she buys  
Im the little bug she drives  
Im the picture that she shows  
To everybody that she knows  
Im the wiggle in her walk  
Im the giggle in her talk  
Im the happy little song she sings  
She wears my love for all to see  
Sail on by silver moon  
I wont follow you this time  
Ive got heaven in my arms tonight  
Im the man on Susies mind  
Im the stops on her way home  
Im the dime in the telephone  
Im the honey that she talks about  
Im old meanie when she pouts  
Im the carpet beneath her feet  
Every night before she sleeps  
Im the pillow where she lays her head  
Im the last word that she said  
Sail on by silver moon  
I wont follow you this time  
Ive got heaven in my arms tonight  
Im the man on Susies mind  
Ive got heaven in my arms tonight  
Im the man on Susies mind  
Ive got heaven in my arms tonight  
Im the man on Susies mind
