Chorus  
Im freeIm free  
And freedom tastes of reality  
Im freeIm free  
An Im waiting for you to follow me  
  
If I told you what it takes  
To reach the highest high  
Youd laugh and say nothings that simple  
But youve been told many times before  
Messiahs pointed to the door  
And no one had the guts to leave the temple  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus  
  
How can we follow  
How can we follow
