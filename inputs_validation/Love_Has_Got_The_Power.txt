Your love has got the power  
Your love has got the power  
And I thank you 2x  
I spend my nights alone with the memories that I have  
I try to figure it out how things can happen like that  
I will never forget all the good times that we had  
Im trying to go on with my life throughout the day  
I believe that you would have been wanting me to stay  
If I just could have shown how I feel deep inside  
chorus  
Your love has got the power  
Your love has got the power and I thank you  
Your love has got the power  
Your love has got the power and I thank you  
Your love has got the power  
cause your love has got the power baby  
Your love has got the power  
cause your love has got the power baby  
sometimes its hard to achieve all the goes that you have  
You only know what your feelings like when shes no longer there  
Everythings got a reason and its time to be fair  
I wanna thank you for dealing with me the way you did  
Youve got me understanding some things are meant to be  
A lesson in love isnt all that I see  
chorus  
your love yeah your love yeah give it all up for your love 2x  
Im dreaming were together the way it should be  
The world is open wide yet your holding on to me yeah  
Im giving up my life and the feeling is here to stay  
chorus
