Telling your son a joke  
He doesnt think is funny  
Well catch him unawares but  
What if he doesnt wear underwear  
Lighting it up  
You were so cool  
Her school colors  
Black and light black  
Giving it up  
She has started  
Your lifes colors  
Black and light black  
Getting your hair from under your bed  
Breaking your fingers  
Getting killed by a car  
Before you can make him pay
