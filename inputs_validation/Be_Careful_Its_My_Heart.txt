Be Careful Its My Heart  
Bing Crosby  
Words and music by Irving Berlin  
From the musical Holiday Inn  
Sweetheart of mine Ive sent you a valentine  
Sweetheart of mine its more than a valentine  
Be careful its my heart  
Its not my watch youre holding its my heart  
Its not the note I sent you that you quickly burned  
Its not the book I lent you that you never returned  
Remember its my heart  
The heart with which so willingly I part  
Its yours to take to keep or break  
But please before you start  
Be careful its my heart  
From Gloria Montcomags
