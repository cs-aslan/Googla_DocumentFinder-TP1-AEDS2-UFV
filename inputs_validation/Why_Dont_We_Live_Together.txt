There comes a time in everyones life  
When all of the parties every night  
Theyre not enough  
You want something more Tell me  
I want you  
I want you  
  
Tell  
Tell  
  
I find you when I want you  
And lose you late at night  
The woman in me shouts out  
The man in me just smiles  
I may not always love you  
You may not care  
But if we should live together  
Theres something we could share  
If we dare  
Why dont we  
  
Baby Why dont we live together  
You wont believe in love until the day you try  
Baby Why dont we live together Baby  
With all the love we had and all the love we hide  
  
Well find a home together  
Baby And sleep there every night  
Baby Theres a time and place for most things  
Baby This time well get it right  
Aah You may not always love me  
I may not care  
But intuition tells me baby  
Theres something we could share  
If we dare  
Why dont we  
  
Baby Why dont we live together  
You wont believe in love until the day you try  
Baby Why dont we live together Baby  
With all the love we had and all the love we hide  
  
Why dont we live together together  
Together together baby  
Why dont we live together together  
Together

Baby You may not always love me  
I may not care  
But intuition tells me baby  
Theres something we could share  
If we dare  
Why dont we  
  
Baby Why dont we live together Ooh ooh  
You wont believe in love until the day you try
