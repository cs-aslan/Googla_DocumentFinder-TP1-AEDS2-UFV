Ive been a wild rover for many a year  
And Ive spent all my money on whiskey and beer  
And now Im returning with gold in great store  
And I never will play the wild rover no more  
And its no nay never  
No nay never no more  
And Ill play the wild rover  
No never no more  
I went to an alehouse I used to frequent  
And I told the landlady my money was spent  
I asked her for credit she answered me Nay  
Saying Custom like yours I can have any day  
And its no nay never  
No nay never no more  
And Ill play the wild rover  
No never no more  
I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright  
And the landladys eyes opened wide with delight  
She said I have whiskeys and wines of the best  
And the words that I told you were only in jest  
And its no nay never  
No nay never no more  
And Ill play the wild rover  
No never no more  
Ill go home to my parents confess what Ive done  
And Ill ask them to pardon their prodigal son  
And when they have kissed me as ofttimes before  
I never will play the wild rover no more  
And its no nay never  
No nay never no more  
And Ill play the wild rover  
No never no more
