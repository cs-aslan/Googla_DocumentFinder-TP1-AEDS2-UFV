Are you hungry  
Are you sick  
Are you begging for a break  
  
Are you sweet  
Are you fresh  
Are you strung up by the wrists  
  
We want the young blood  
Are you fracturing  
Are you torn at the seams  
Would you do anything  
Fleabitten Moth eaten  
  
We suck young blood  
We suck young blood  
  
Wont let the creeping ivy  
Wont let the nervous bury me  
Our veins are thin  
Our rivers poisoned  
  
We want the sweet meats  
We want the young blood
