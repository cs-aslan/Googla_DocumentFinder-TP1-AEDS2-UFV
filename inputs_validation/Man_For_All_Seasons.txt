Everybody wants to leave  
Just like you and I  
I have all year to smile  
A tear for every eye  
  
Life closed its eyes broke my world now I cry  
Ive got to tell you Ive got the reasons  
Cause Im a man a man for all seasons alive  
  
And would I pray  
What makes the world go round  
I havent got today  
My mind is lost and found  
  
Life closed its eyes and said goodbye now I cry  
But Ive got to tell you Ive got my reasons  
Cause Im a man a man for all seasons alive  
And would I pray what makes the world go round  
I havent got today my mind is lost and found  
Do do do do do do do  
  
Im a man for all seasons Repeat x4
