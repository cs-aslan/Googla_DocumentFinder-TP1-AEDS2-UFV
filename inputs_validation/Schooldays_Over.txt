Schooldays over come on then john  
Time to be getting your pit boots on  
On with your sack and your moleskin trousers  
Time you were on your way  
Time you were learning the pitmans job  
And earning a pitmans pay  
Come on then jim its time to go  
Time you were working down below  
Time to be handling a pick and shovel  
You start at the pits today  
Time to be learning the colliers job  
And earning a colliers pay  
Come on then dai its nearly light  
Time you were off to the anthracite  
The morning mist is on the valley  
Its time you were on your way  
Time you were learning the miners job  
And earning a miners pay  
Repeat first verse
