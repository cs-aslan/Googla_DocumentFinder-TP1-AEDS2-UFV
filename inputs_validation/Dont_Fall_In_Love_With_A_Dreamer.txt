Kenny  
Just look at you sitting there  
You never looked better than tonight  
And itd be so easy to tell ya Id stay  
Like Ive done so many times  
  
Kim Carnes  
I was so sure this would be the night  
Youd close the door and want to stay with me  
And itd be so easy to tell ya Ill stay  
Like Ive done so many times  
  
Both  
Dont fall in love with a dreamer  
cause hell always take you in  
Just when you think youve really changed him  
Hell leave you again  
Dont fall in love with a dreamer  
Cause hell break you every time  
  
Kim oh put out the light  
Kenny just hold on  
Both before we say goodbye  
  
Kim  
Now its mornin and the phone rings  
And you say youve gotta get your things together  
You just gotta leave before ya change your mind  
  
Kenny  
And if ya knew what I was thinkin girl  
Id turn around if youd just ask me one more time  
  
Both dont fall in love with a dreamer  
Kim cause hell always take you in  
  
Both  
Just when you think youve really changed him  
Hell leave you again  
Dont fall in love with a dreamer  
  
Kenny cause hell break you every time  
Kim oh put out the light  
Kenny just hold on  
Both before we say goodbye  
Both before we say goodbye  
Both goodbye
