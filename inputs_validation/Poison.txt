Your love is infectious  
Your rotten to the core  
Every body knows what you got  
But they still come back for more  
Your everybodys favorite  
You give them all a good time  
Your loves a total disaster  
But when they sign the dotted line theyre  
  
Poisoned  
One night with you and youve got me  
Poisoned  
Making love with the devils daughter  
Poisoned  
One night with you and youve got me  
Poisoned  
That dirty little bitch has got me  
Poisoned  
  
Sitting close beside me  
Hand upon my zip  
Dont bother to take it down honey  
Its about to rip  
Shes mammys little virgin  
Her daddys all in pride  
But she welcomed me with opened legs  
Kept me satisfied  
  
Tell me that you love me  
Say youll never leave  
The more I give the more you take  
The more that you receive  
I got you down beneath me  
Open wide ha ha  
Im gonna make you pay for all  
The times youve cheated and lied
