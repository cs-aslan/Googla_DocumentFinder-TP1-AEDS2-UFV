If I had a gun for every ace Ive drawn  
I could arm a town the size of Abilene  
Dont you push me baby cause Im moaning low  
You know Im only in it for the gold  
  
All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars  
I could pay you back with one good hand  
You can look around about the wide world over  
Youll never find another honest man  
  
Last fair deal in the country sweet Suzy  
Last fair deal in the town  
Put your gold money where your love is baby  
Before you let my deal go down  
  
Dont you push me baby  
because Im moaning low  
I know a little something  
you wont ever know  
Dont you touch hard liquor just  
a cup of cold coffee  
Gonna get up  
in the morning and go  
  
Everybodys bragging and drinking that wine  
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shine  
Come to Daddy on an inside straight  
I got no chance of losing this time  
No I got no chance of losing this time
