No one ever sees you cry  
You just keep it all inside  
In a warm place where you can hide  
  
When will it rain  
When will it rain  
I saw you laugh the other day  
But all too fast it went away  
  
Now your skys cloudy n gray  
Falling mainly on the plain  
  
When will it rain  
When will it rain  
No water fallls  
Down your window pane  
  
And when I look into your eyes  
That window to your soul cant lie  
Theres water where the well went dry  
  
So how long can there be a drought  
When your dams filled with doubt  
No place to build your house  
Let your cup runneth over and out  
I said for crying out loud  
  
When will it rain  
When will it rain  
No water fallls  
Down your window pane  
When will it rain  
When will it rain  
A tear for fear is calling out your name  
  
Rain on me
