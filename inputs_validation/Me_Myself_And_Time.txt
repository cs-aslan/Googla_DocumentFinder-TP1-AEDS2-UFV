I can make the rain stop if I wanna  
Just like my attitude  
I can take my laptop record a snapshot  
And change your point of view  
  
I just entered this brand new world  
And Im so open hearted  
I know Ive got a long way to go but I  
Im Im just getting started  
  
Im over my head and I know it I know it  
Im doing my best not to show it to show it  
Whatever it takes to be what I was meant to be Im going to try  
Cause Im living the dream and I know it I know it  
Im trying my best not to blow it to blow it  
And I know everything will be fine  
With me myself and time  
  
I go where life takes me  
But some days it makes me want to change my direction  
Sometimes it gets lonely  
But I know that its only a matter of my perception  
I just entered this brand new world  
And Im so open hearted  
I know Ive got a long way to go but Im  
Im just getting started  
  
Im over my head and I know it I know it  
Im doing my best not to show it to show it  
Whatever it takes to be what I was meant to be Im going to try  
Cause Im living the dream and I know it I know it  
Im trying my best not to blow it to blow it  
And I know everything will be fine  
With me myself and time  
  
And baby there is nothing like this moment  
To just be real and let the truth be spoken  
Whatevers broke I can make it unbroken  
Turn the lead in my hand into something golden  
Just try more love if I try more love then Ill find  
Myself and time  
  
Im over my head and I know it I know it  
Im doing my best not to show it to show it  
Whatever it takes to be what I was meant to be Im going to try  
  
Im over my head and I know it I know it  
Im doing my best not to show it to show it  
Whatever it takes to be what I was meant to be Im going to try  
Cause Im living the dream and I know it I know it  
Im trying my best not to blow it to blow it  
And I know everything will be fine  
With me myself and time  
  
Ill find myself in time  
I know Ill find myself in time
