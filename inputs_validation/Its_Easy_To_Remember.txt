Your sweet expression  
The smile you gave me  
The way you looked when we met  
Its easy to remember  
But so hard to forget  
  
I hear you whisper  
Ill always love you  
I know its over and yet  
Its easy to remember  
But so hard to forget  
  
So I must dream  
To have your hand caress me  
Fingers press me tight  
Id rather dream  
Than have that lonely feeling  
Stealing through the night  
  
Each little moment  
Is clear before me  
And though it brings me regret  
Its easy to remember  
But so hard to forget
