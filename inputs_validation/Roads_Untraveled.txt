Weep not for roads untraveled  
Weep not for paths left lone  
Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end  
Its the worst kind of pain Ive known  
  
Give up your heart left broken  
And let that mistake pass on  
Cause the love that you lost wasnt worth what it cost  
And in time youll be glad its gone  
  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa  
whoa whoa  
  
Weep not for roads untraveled  
Weep not for sights unseen  
May your love never end and if you need a friend  
Theres a seat here alongside me  
  
Whoa whoa whoa whoa  
Whoa whoa
