Oh life is so hard  
And you have to choose  
The call of the wind  
On the highway of fools  
Why does a man never cry when hes feeling  
You murder all his feelings  
Will you still be there  
Only love knows why  
Between the fire  
When white doves cry  
Why does a man never show what hes meaning  
To murder all his feelings  
And you cry in the night  
When theres no one besides  
Your tears  
  
Dont worry baby  
Ill be by your side  
Dont let it ever get you down with you tonight  
Dont worry baby  
Where he has gone  
My heart is out of my control  
Im falling strong  
  
Dont worry pretty baby  
Come and get you down tonight  
Come and get  
Come and get  
Come and get you down  
Your heart of pride  
Dont worry pretty baby  
Come and get you down tonight  
Come and get  
Come and get  
Come and get you down  
Your heart of pride  
Heart and pride  
  
I live for love  
And youve got to try  
Oh dont let this chance baby pass you by  
Why does a girl never cry when her feelings  
Are murdered by bad dealings  
It started in heaven  
Theres a place for you  
Give me the chance for a rendezvous  
Why does a girl never shows what shes meaning  
You murder all her feelings  
And you cry in the night  
When theres no one beside  
Your tears
