Chorus  
Version Girl whats your name  
Oh you come and you go  
Version Girl whats your name  
Just like the morning sun  
Its so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me  
  
Version girl whats your name  
Dont you know I long to say  
Version Girl whats your name  
Its so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me  
  
I sit in the sun waiting for you to come along  
So my heart will be satisfied  
So please let me be your number one  
Under the moon under the stars and under the sun  
  
Chorus  
  
Version girl whats you name  
Oh you come  
  
I sit in the sun waiting for you to come along  
So my heart will be satisfied  
So please let me be your number one  
Under the moon under the stars and under the sun  
  
Chorus
