Things just havent been the same  
Since the flying saucer came  
Now the aliens are on the loose  
  
Well we tried to hold em back  
Tried to ward off their attack  
But our atom bombs were just no use  
  
They were ugly they were mean  
Biggest heads I ever seen  
They made everybody scream and shout  
  
First they leveled Tokyo  
Then New York was next to go  
Boy I really wish theyd cut it out  
  
They wasted everybody on my block  
There goes the neighborhood  
Theyll zap you with their death ray eyes  
And blow you up real good  
  
Run for your lives  
Slime creatures from outer space  
Slime creatures from outer space  
Theyre not very nice to the human race  
Slime creatures from outer space  
  
Theres more comin every day  
And they just wont go away  
Now theyre reproducing in the sewers  
  
They got slimy lizard skin  
And an evil lookin grin  
And they sure could use some manicures  
  
They got hands all covered with fungus  
They got eyes like some kinda bug  
I sure hope they dont come in here  
I just shampooed the rug  
  
Run for your lives  
Slime creatures from outer space  
Slime creatures from outer space  
  
Theyre really makin a mess of this place  
Slime creatures  
Slime creatures  
  
Slime creatures from outer space  
Slime creatures from outer space  
Slime creatures from outer space  
  
Slime creatures from outer space  
Slime creatures from outer space  
Slime creatures from outer space  
  
Theyll rip your head off just for fun  
Theyll paralyze your mind  
Theyre wearin out their welcome  
  
I dont think I like their kind  
Theyll suck your brain out through a straw  
You just cant trust those guys  
  
So hide the children lock the doors  
And always watch the skies  
Look out here come the  
  
Slime creatures from outer space  
Slime creatures from outer space  
Theyre an intergalactic disgrace  
  
Slime creatures from outer space  
Slime creatures from outer space  
I wish theyd just get outta my face  
Slime creatures from outer space  
Slime creatures from outer space  
  
Theyre makin a big fat mess of this place  
Slime creatures  
Slime creatures  
  
Oh where did they come from  
What do they want from us  
Who do they think they are  
Slime creatures slime creatures  
  
Why dont they leave me alone  
Slime creatures slime creatures  
Theyre really getting on my nerves
