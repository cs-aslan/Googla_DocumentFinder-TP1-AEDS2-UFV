Sitting in the cheap seats underneath  
The stars  
Im heading back to base Ill drop you off  
At Mars  
Im sure I know your face or what star  
Youre from  
I try to make conversation but Im too  
Far gone  
  
Im a man machine  
Drinking gasoline  
Super human being  
Shooting laser beams  
  
How you gonna leave when your bags  
Aint packed  
And how you gonna shoot when were  
Back to back  
How dyou tell a joke when you cant laugh  
You know that youre the punchline baby  
Take a bath  
  
Im a man machine  
Drinking gasoline  
Super human being  
Im a queens dream  
  
The dog has ate my homework today  
Its not done it aint done  
I have heard theyre not very well  
In the sun  
  
Cos Im a man machine  
Im a queens dream  
Drinking gasoline  
Im a queens dream  
  
YeahHelp  
  
How you gonna live for love lying on  
Your back  
And how you gonna keep it kleen in a  
Dirty mac  
How you gonna breathe when youre lost  
In space  
Youre dazed and amused  
Talking through a different face  
  
Cos Im man machine  
Drinking gasoline  
Im a teen dream  
Im a man machine  
Im a man machine  
Im a man machine  
Drinking gasoline
