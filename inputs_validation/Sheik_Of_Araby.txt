Well Im the Sheik of Araby and your love well it belongs to me  
At night when youre asleep into your tent Ill creep  
And the stars that shine above theyll light our way to love  
Youll rule this land with me Im the Sheik of Araby baby  
  
Im a Sheik not the freak but the Sheik of Araby  
And your love belongs to me  
At night when youre asleep into baby your tent Ill creep  
And the stars that shine above theyll light our way to love  
Youll rule this land with me Im a Sheik not the freak  
  
Oh Im the Sheik of Araby and your love belongs to me  
At night when youre asleep baby into your tent Ill creep  
And the stars that shine above theyll light our way to love  
Youll rule this land with me Im the Sheik of Araby
