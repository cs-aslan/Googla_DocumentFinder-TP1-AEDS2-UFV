All my life Ive looked at love as a fairy tale  
A woman a man never never land and a storybook ending  
Leading roles and my heros upon the silver screen  
I played em all but always came up empty  
But one of these days Ill be in a movie with em  
  
Cause I believe that fantasy  
Is one step from reality  
For those of us who dream of love  
And I believe cause I want to  
Theres some one man for someone who believes in love  
To not give up  
Even though youve heard so many say  
Thats the way the story goes  
  
Chorus  
Im lookin for a new love story  
Im lookin for a yellow brick road  
Thatll carry me to his door  
Im lookin for a new love story  
Oh one thats never been told before  
  
And I have searched the oceans of many a mans eyes  
But I have yet to feel like more than some deserted island  
I know a relationship will come for me in time  
And I cant wait to see his face on my horizon  
Cause one of these days hell sail into my life  
  
Cause I believe that fantasy  
Is one step from reality  
For those of us who dream of love  
And I believe cause I want to  
Theres some one man for someone who believes in love  
To not give up  
Even though youve heard so many say  
Thats the way the story goes  
  
Chorus
