Ive been waitin on the other side for your friends to leave  
So I dont have to hide I prefer they didnt know  
So Ive been waiting on the other side for your friends to go  
  
Ive been sliding down a slippery slope Ive been climbing  
Up a slowly burning rope but the flame is getting low  
Ive been waitin on the other side for your friends to go  
  
You never need to worry about me Ill be fine on my own  
Someone else can worry about me  
Ive spent a lot of time on my own  
Ive spent a lot of time on my own  
  
Ive been waitin till the danger past I dont know  
How long the storm is gonna to last if were gonna carry on  
Ill been waiting on the other side till your friends are gone  
  
So tell me what I want to know  
Ill be waiting on the other side for your friends to go  
  
Someone else can worry about me  
Ive spent a lot of time on my own  
Ive spent a lot of time on my own  
  
Ive been waiting on the other side  
For your friends to leave so I dont have to hide  
I prefer they didnt know  
So Ive been waiting on the other side for your friends to go  
  
Ive been waiting on the other side  
Ive been waiting on the other side for your friends to go
