Its the first time I ever felt this lonely  
I wish someone could cure this pain  
Its funny when you think its gonna work out  
Til you chose weed over me youre so lame  
  
I thought you were cool until the point  
But up until the point you didnt call me  
When you said you would  
I finally figured out youre all the same  
Always coming up with some kind of story  
  
Every time I try to make you smile  
Youre always feeling sorry for yourself  
Every time I try to make you laugh  
You cant  
Youre too tough  
You think youre loveless  
Is that too much that Im asking for  
  
I thought youd come around when I ignored you  
So I thought youd have the decency to change  
But babe I guess you didnt take that warning  
Cause Im not about to look at your face again  
  
Cant you see that you lie to yourself  
You cant see the world through a mirror  
It wont be too late when the smoke clears  
Cause I I am still here  
  
But every time I try to make you smile  
Youd always grow up feeling sorry for yourself  
Every time I try to make you laugh  
You stand like a stone  
Alone in your zone  
Is it too much that Im asking for  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Cant find where I am  
Lying here  
Alone I fear  
Afraid of the dark  
No one to claim  
Alone again  
  
Cant you see that you lie to yourself  
You cant see the world through a mirror  
It wont be too late when the smoke clears  
Cause I I am still here  
  
Every time I try to make you smile  
Youre always feeling sorry for yourself  
Every time I try to make you laugh  
You cant  
Youre too tough  
You think youre loveless  
It was too much that I asked you for
