Tha world is mine nigga get back  
Dont fuck with my stack the gage is racked  
About to drop the bomb Im tha motherfuckin don  
Big fish in a small pond  
Now tha feds tryin to throw the book at the crook  
But I shook they worm and they hook  
Guppies hold they breath  
They wanna miss me when Im tipsey  
Runnin everything west of the Mississippi  
Its the unseen pullin strings wit my pinky ring  
We got your woman so pucker up fo we fuck her up  
Bow down before I make a phone call  
Got 25 niggas runnin up on yall  
For the cheese we want them keys everybody freeze  
On ya knees butt naked please  
Before any of you guppies get heart  
Nigga rewind my part and  
Bow down when I come to my town  
Bow down when Im westward bound  
Bow down cause I aint no hater like you  
Bow down to a nigga thats greater than you  
I take ten steps and I draw  
Now whos dissin the mad ass Inglewood addition  
I bust like a pimple my mind is illmental  
The Westside connects with me and south central  
And a drag from tha zig zag cant fuck with the Phillys  
Holdin down tha wild west like a kid they call Billy  
Once again its Mack 10 the gold crown holda  
Strong as a CocaCola with a crome pistola  
Now who wanna fuss so I can buss when I cuss  
My look bring you fear with gear deom the Surplus  
Since a teen I chased tha green the crack scene king  
Lolos Cornishes and Bagguetts on my peices  
So reconize these real Gs take the cheese  
The westdside connect keep it rollin like gold Ds  
Three wheelin and dealin is like tha California style  
But in tha mean while in my town you got to bow  
Bow down when you come to my town  
Bow down when Im westward bound  
Bow down because I aint a hater like you  
Bow down to to a nigga thats greater than you  
Well its that chuck wearin still sportin a beanie  
The shadiest nigga in the click who want to see me  
As I slide my locs on let my khakis hang  
Westside connect gang connect gang bing bing bang  
Run away run away dont get your punk ass laid  
By this H double O to D to the STA  
Fuck hidin it Im gang conected simple and plain  
Which means I could give a fuck about you niggas in this rap game  
Flashy niggas get stuck up beat the fuck up  
When you come around keep your chain tucked  
From this zero zeros apostrophe is shit  
Shake a studio lyricist Im real with this  
Talk the talk walk the walk  
Dis me on wax and Im trying to saw your whole fuckin head off nya  
Im platium bond so bitch shut up  
And nigga all yall could kiss my converse like sho nuff  
Bow down when I come to your town  
Bow down when Im westward bound  
Bow down cause I aint a hater like you  
Bow down to a nigga thats greater than you  
Bow down when you come to my town  
Bow down when we westward bound  
Bow down cause we aint no haters like you  
Bow down to some niggas thats greater than you  
Tell you somethin gangstas make the world round  
So you aint got the clown  
But if you live on the west side of your town  
Make them other fools bow down  
West side connection the world belongs to us  
Bow down bow down bow down  
Bow down when you come to our town  
Bow down where we westward bound  
Bow down cause we aint no hater like you  
Bow down to some niggas thats greater than you fool
