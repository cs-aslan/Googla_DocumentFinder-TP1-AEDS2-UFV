As martin said to xanthe  
As they played with wooden toys  
you may have wendys playhouse  
But where the heels your boys   
As paul said to fifi  
As they eyed each other up  
you may have better plimsoles  
But you cant pee standing up  
And Id like to take the time to bite  
Their neck and make it bleed  
Or maybe I could cut holes in their  
Daddys harris tweed  
And I cant put my finger on it  
Maybe its something in their food  
And I cnat put my finger on it  
All I know is christ wouldve sued  
As sharon said to jamie  
As they sat down for a chat  
if you think Im cooking dinner  
Well prepare to eat dead rat  
As debbie said to alex  
As they held hands in the park  
how come you wear rupert check  
When you think youre so hard  
I shouldve done his land rover  
To let him know Id been  
Instead I wrote f off  
On the dirt across his screen  
And I cant put my finger on it  
Maybe its something in their food  
And I cnat put my finger on it  
All I know is christ wouldve sued  
I wish Id let them know that I was here  
A drop of arsenic in the wine  
Sulphuric acid in the beer
