Hey you see me pictures crazy  
All the world Ive seen before me passing by  
Ive got nothing to gain to lose  
All the world Ive seen before me passing by  
  
You dont care about how I feel  
I dont feel it anymore  
You dont care about how I feel  
I dont feel it anymore  
You dont care about how I feel  
I dont feel it anymore  
You dont care about how I feel  
I dont feel it anymore  
  
Hey you are me not so pretty  
All the world Ive seen before me passing by  
Silent my voice Ive got no choice  
All the world Ive seen before me passing by  
  
You dont care about how I feel  
I dont feel it anymore  
You dont care about how I feel  
I dont feel it anymore  
You dont care about how I feel  
I dont feel it anymore  
You dont care about how I feel  
I dont feel it anymore  
I dont see anymore  
I dont hear anymore  
I dont speak anymore  
I dont feel
