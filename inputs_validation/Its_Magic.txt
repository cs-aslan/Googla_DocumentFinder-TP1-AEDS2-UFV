Why do I tell myself these things that happen  
Are all really true  
When in my heart I know  
The magic is my love for you  
  
You sign the song begins  
You speak and I hear violins its magic  
The stars desert the skies  
And rush to nestle in your eyes its magic  
  
Without a golden wand or mystic charms  
Fantastic things begin when I am in your arms  
  
When we walk hand in hand  
The world becomes a wonderland its magic  
How else can I explain those rainbows  
When there aint no rain its magic  
  
Why do I tell me myself  
These things that happen are all really true  
When in my heart  
I know the magic is my love for you  
  
Magic magic magic magic
