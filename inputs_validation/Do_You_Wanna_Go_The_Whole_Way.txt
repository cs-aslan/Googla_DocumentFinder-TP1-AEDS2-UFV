Before we take off all our clothes and get close together  
Before it gets too serious both of us need to know  
Are we gonna go the whole awy this time  
This time  
  
Before all secrets are revealed old scars must heal or wither  
But its getting very late and I cant wait anymore  
Are we gonna go the whole way this time  
Do you want to go the whole way this time  
This time  
  
Do you want to go the whole way now  
Were taking it easy  
Do you want to go the whole way Babe  
Kick it in kick it in slowly  
  
Do you want to go the whole way this time  
Do you want to go the whole way for sure  
Do you want to go the whole way this time  
This time  
This time  
Do ya
