Stop the world turn out the sun  
Im so tired of it turning round  
Stop the world call it a day  
Leave it all behind leave it that way  
Peace is just a word is just a word  
Peace is just a word yeah  
Stop the world just let it bleed  
Well weve taken more than everything we need  
Stop the world just shut it down  
Just shut it down shut it down  
Just shut it down shut it down  
Theres no point in it spinning around  
I tell you little peace is just a word is just a word  
Everyday that peace is just a word yeah  
Stop the world take it any where  
Its just that living here is more than I can bear  
More than I can bear ooh  
Stop the world just pack it in  
Well weve reached the point where no one ever wins  
No one ever wins  
Peace is just a word its just a word  
Peace is just a word its just a word  
Peace is just a word its just a word  
Peace is just a word its just a word  
Peace is just a word  
Peace is just a word  
Peace is just a word
