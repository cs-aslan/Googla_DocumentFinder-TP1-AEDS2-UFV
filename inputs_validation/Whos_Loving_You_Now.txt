Whos loving you now  
  
Heard things about you  
They said you had changed your ways  
I cant stand to talk about the past  
Its all over now  
Living with this lonely heart  
Surviving each moment without you  
Never thought of being this way before  
Hmmmmm now I want to know  
  
Chorus  
Whos loving you now  
Whos holding your heart and mind  
Whos loving you now  
I wanna know whos loving you  
  
Its been years without you  
  
Then why do I dream of you  
Afraid that this heart still beats for you  
Hoooo Now I want to know  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Bridge  
Things have changed  
And time has erased  
The feelings that you once had wooooo  
But I cant deny  
Nothing seems to defy the moments of love  
We have shared in time  
  
Repeat chorus  
Whos loving you now  
Whos holding your heart and mind  
Whos loving you now
