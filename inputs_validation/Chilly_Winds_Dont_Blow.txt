Going where the willows weep no more darlin baby  
Going where the willows weep no more  
Chilly winds dont blow along my shore oh baby  
Where the chilly winds the chilly winds dont blow  
  
Going where my father waits for me oh baby  
Going where my father waits for me  
Going there cause there Id rather be oh baby  
Where the chilly winds the chilly winds dont blow  
  
Yes there will be red roses round my door darlin baby  
There will be red roses round my door  
Going where theyll welcome me for sure oh baby  
Where the chilly wind the chilly wind dont blow  
Chilly winds chilly winds the chilly winds dont blow
