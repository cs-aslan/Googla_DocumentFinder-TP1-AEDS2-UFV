Below the surface this day I need it light  
Inside dimension lies another sacrifice  
Once out of reach we never speak we never compromise  
As they turned to gold the edges froze and seemed to turn to ice  
  
All flight departures assembled not returned  
Left in these passions I looked but never learned  
Theres hope youve heard theres life in another world  
Sometimes youll find that truth is never kind  
In the ghost lies a portrait of space that time is never here  
In the mind of a fallen man an easy day in another land  
Ship sails out to sea away from me I just stand and stare  
Assassin clears his lens I know the end I wasnt even there  
  
One day it came to mind we even leave the rest behind  
Some day I know you get where you should go  
Theres hope youve heard theres life in another world  
Sometimes well find that truth is never kind  
One day it came to mind we even leave the rest behind  
Some day I know we even get where we used to go  
Theres hope youve heard theres life in another world
