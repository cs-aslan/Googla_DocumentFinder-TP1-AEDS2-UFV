We have been sleeping with the lights on  
Just about every night  
Because we are afraid of what the dark might bring  
I know I know its just a childish fear  
That grows and grows wild in the middle of me  
  
Im gonna get a new tattoo  
Black and stretching around my arm  
Like a life that is visible and real  
I know I know its stupid and immature  
I just want to give shape to the face  
That twists inside both you and me  
  
Breathing fire doesnt look good on a resume  
Neither does anything else we do  
We got to get ready for the real world  
Yeah yeah we got to grow up  
  
You know I like to die for awhile  
Everyday in the afternoon  
I like to let the arms of a bar  
Wrap around me tight  
Im just going to sprawl in the front booth  
Big drink above my head  
Cross eyed and smiling as I watch the world  
Go twisting by  
  
I dont want to die with you  
Or live in the same dark room  
I dont want to see your bloodshot eyes no more no more  
I just want to take this girl all curls and big brown eyes  
Man I cant take the pain of wanting her needing her  
  
I know the secret of your soul  
And I just dont want to know  
Yeah man we got to grow up
