Cause its been gray for so many years  
I just want to what is mine  
Your love for me wait and see

Though its a long and cold dark night

And how to share it  
Ill give you double up in return  
Life is now and meant for living  
Cause its been gray for so many years  
  
Life will never ever be bad under my spell  
Kiss and tell  
I feel lonely when I see you  
Why dont you give me just a smile  
Youd make my day in many ways  
Just a fragment of your lifetime  
Cause the shine in my eyes will tell
