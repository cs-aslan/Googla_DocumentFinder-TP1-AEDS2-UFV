Sometimes I imagine myself as a drifter  
A seeker of fortune connoisseur of great wines  
Dashin through meadows of yellow and green  
Tryin to catch the impossible dream  
Aleavin the straight life behind  
  
Sometimes my thoughts found me way down in Mexico  
Adrinkin tequila goin out of my mind  
Havin a ball on a couple a bob  
Atreatin the ladies to corn on the cob  
Aleavin the straight life behind  
  
And suddenly all my silly thoughts disappear  
She comes to me softly with crackers and beer  
Awinkin and blinkin and blowin my ear  
Arunnin away with my mind  
  
Its great to be in love Im not really thinkin of  
Aleavin the straight life behind  
Im just playin a game in mywhy mind  
  
Once in a while in my mind I go abummin  
Agoin nowhere with no worry of time  
Runnin along chasin after a train  
Hummin a song in the sun and the rain  
Aleavin the straight life behind  
  
I can just see me on a tropical island  
Aridin the surf and drinkin coconut wine  
Havin me fun with the girls in the sand  
Chasin the sun through an innocent land  
Aleavin the straight life behind  
  
Suddenly all my silly thoughts disappear  
She comes to me softly with crackers and beer  
Awinkin and blinkin and blowin my ear  
Arunnin away with my mind  
  
Its great to be in love Im not really thinkin of  
Aleavin the straight life behind  
Im just playin a game in mywhy mind
