I got seven pictures of Buddha  
The prophets on my tongue  
Eleven angels of mercy  
Sighin over that black hole in the sun  
My hearts dark but its risin  
Im pullin all the faith I can see  
From that black hole on the horizon  
I hear your voice calling me  
  
Let it rain let it rain let it rain  
Let it rain let it rain let it rain let it rain  
Meet me at Marys place were gonna have a party  
Meet me at Marys place were gonna have a party  
Tell me how do we get this thing started  
Meet me at Marys place  
  
Familiar faces around me  
Laughter fills the air  
Your loving grace surrounds me  
Everybodys here  
Furnitures out on the front porch  
Musics up loud  
I dream of you in my arms  
I lose myself in the crowd  
  
Let it rain let it rain let it rain  
Let it rain let it rain let it rain let it rain  
Meet me at Marys place were gonna have a party  
Meet me at Marys place were gonna have a party  
Tell me how do you live brokenhearted  
Meet me at Marys place  
  
I got a picture of you in my locket  
I keep it close to my heart  
Its a light shining in my breast  
Leading me through the dark  
Seven days seven candles  
In my window lighting your way  
Your favorite records on the turntable  
I drop the needle and pray Turn it up  
Bands countin out midnight Turn it up  
Floors rumblin loud Turn it up  
  
Singers callin up daylight Turn it up  
And waitin for that shout from the crowd Turn it up  
Waitin for that shout from the crowd Turn it up  
Waitin for that shout from the crowd Turn it up  
Waitin for that shout from the crowd Turn it up  
Waitin for that shout from the crowd Turn it up  
Waitin for that shout from the crowd  
  
Turn it up turn it up turn it up  
Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up  
  
Meet me at Marys place were gonna have a party  
Meet me at Marys place were gonna have a party  
Tell me how do we get this thing started  
Meet me at Marys place  
  
Let it rain let it rain let it rain let it rain let it rain
