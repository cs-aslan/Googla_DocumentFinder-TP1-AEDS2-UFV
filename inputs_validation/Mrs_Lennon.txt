Mrs Lennon o Mrs Lennon  
Checking the sky to see if theres no clouds  
Theres no clouds  
O then I guess it must be alright  
  
Mrs Lennon o Mrs Lennon  
Making the tea and watching the sea  
Theres no waves  
O then I guess it must be alright  
  
Silver spoon o silver spoon  
I lost my silver spoon  
  
And our children o our children  
Did they have to go to war  
Yes my love its okay  
Half the world is always killed you know  
  
Husband john extended his hand  
Extended his hand to his wife  
And he finds and suddenly he finds  
That he has no hands  
  
Theyve lost their bodies  
Theyve lost their bodies  
Yes they lost their bodies  
  
Neither of them o neither of them  
Never left each other  
Yes my love its okay  
Half the world is always dying you know
