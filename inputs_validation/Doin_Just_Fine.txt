There was a time when I thought life was over and out  
When you went away from me  
My dying heat made it hard to breathe  
Would sit in my room  
Because I didnt want to have to go out  
And see you walking by  
One look and Id break night down and cry  
  
Now you say that youve made a big mistake  
Never meant to take your love away  
But you can save your tired  
Apologies  
Cause it may seem hard to believe but  
  
Chorus  
Im doinjust fine  
Getting along very well  
Without you in my life  
I dont need you in my life  
Im doin just fine  
Time made me stronger  
Youre no longer on my mind  
  
You were my earth  
My number one priority  
I gave my love to only you  
Anything youd ask of me  
I would do  
But somewhere down the road  
You felt a change in the weather  
And told me that you had to journey on  
A kiss in the wind and you love was gone  
  
Now you say you never meant to play your games  
Boy dont you know its far too late  
Because you let our love just fall apart  
You no longer have a heart  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Bridge  
When you said goodbye  
I felt so all alone  
There were time at night I couldnt sleep  
My heart was much to weak to make it on my own  
Baby after all the misery  
And pain you out me through  
So unfair to me boy  
Youre no longer my world  
And I aint missin you at all
