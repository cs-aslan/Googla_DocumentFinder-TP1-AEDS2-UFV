We are supposed to be sisters and brothers  
But all we do is constantly dog one another  
We are supposed to act as each others cover  
But we keep at each others throat  
Each others throat  
Each others throat  
Yo it aint no joke  
Were at each others throat Aowl Aowl  
  
We are supposed to spread love and not evil  
But weve been acting more like heathens than people  
Treating our fellowman far worse than illegal  
Cause we keep at each others throat  
Each others throat  
Each others throat  
Yo it aint no joke  
Were at each others throat Aowl Aowl  
  
Ut oh 11 oclock pm and heres the news  
Another fatality caused by a family feud  
Charged tried sentenced by the jury of a brothers gun  
Made sisters fiancees wedding never to be sung  
He didnt like the way he treated the girl  
So the boy played God pow he ended his world  
  
He made a plea for temporary insanity  
But left his sister insane permanently  
This aint new this stuff happens everyday  
Somebody doesnt like someone so they blow them away  
Too fast for reason too quick to negotiate  
  
Regret and sorrow happens a split second too late  
Jealousy for power greed for possession  
Selfishness so you give someone a faked out impression  
Speaking of which Im truly not impressed  
So if seeing is believinI dont want to see the mess  
  
Heartless are we on the straight with no chaser  
As if for negativity we got the vapors  
Know as I love me so I do love my neighbor  
Cause we are too busy at each others throat  
  
Each others throat  
Each others throat  
Yo it aint no joke  
Were at each others throat Aowl Aowl  
Repeat
