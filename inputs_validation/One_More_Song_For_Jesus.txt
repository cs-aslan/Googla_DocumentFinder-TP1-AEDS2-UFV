Weve traveled this world over in our day and in our time  
Weve heard some songs that made no sense and some that did not rhyme  
We may never sing another song there aint no way to know  
But lets have one more song for Jesus fore we go  
Oh we may not live the letter of the law and live that truth  
Judged and criticized for almost everything we do  
But they cannot stop our singing though theyre holier than we  
Lets have one more song for Jesus if you please  
  
They say theyre gonna burn us in a not too distant day  
I dont think we should buy that cause it just aint Jesus way  
Now they say hes mean and vicious and theres nothing that he wont do  
They must know a different Jesus than we do  
Oh we may not live the letter  
  
Some atheists may tell us he was just another man  
Some say that hes a superstar and theyre his biggest fans  
He means so much to so many that I think you will agree  
We oughta have one more song for Jesus if you please  
Oh we may not live the letter of the law and be that true  
Judged and criticized for almost everything we do  
But they cannot stop our singing though theyre holier than we  
So lets have one more song for Jesus if you please  
We oughta have one more song for Jesus if you please  
Lets have one more song for Jesus on our knees  
Lets have one more song for Jesus if you please
