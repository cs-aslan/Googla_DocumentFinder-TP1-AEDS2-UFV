Behind the hill  
Theres a busy little still  
Where your pappys workin in the moonlight  
  
Your lovin pa  
Isnt quite within the law  
So hes hidin there behind the hill  
  
Bye bye baby  
Stop your yawnin  
Dont cry baby  
Day will be dawnin  
  
And when it does  
From the mountain where he was  
Hell be comin with a jug of moonshine  
  
So count your sheep  
Mamas singin you to sleep  
With a moonshine lullaby  
  
Dream of pappy  
Very happy  
With his jug of mountain rye  
  
So count your sheep  
Mamas singin you to sleep  
With a moonshine lullaby
