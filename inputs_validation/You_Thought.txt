You know today is a new day you see  
  
Ill stab you the back and then sting like a bee  
  
My ride be sitn on some twenties  
  
You thought you could battle me  
  
While your ride sits on them little threes  
  
Its like your jumping in the ring trying to box with Ali  
  
Just stay in pee wees  
  
You and all them are about same height I can see  
  
Youll never be more then a shadow standing behind me
