I just heard the saddest news somebodys back in town  
And I know just what shes gonna do  
Shell pick up what she left off her last time around  
Oh how it hurts to keep on losin you  
Somebodys back in town to steal your love from me  
The fear Ive had so long is now reality  
The only chance I have is when she throws you down  
My chance is gone somebodys back in town  
 steel   
I know that I cant change your way weve been through that before  
Her trap is set and you will walk right in  
She only wants of love an upaffair and nothing more  
And youre just fool enough to fall again  
Somebodys back in town why cant she stay away  
You should know she never loved you anyway  
Shell let you live a little then shell throw you down  
Sad news today somebodys back in town
