Ol Joes got a Boston whaler  
He bought in Key Biscane  
He swears since the day hes got her  
Shes been nothing but a pain  
When the suns at his back  
And the winds in his face  
Its just him and the wheel  
He wouldnt take a million for the  
Way it makes him feel  
  
Chorus  
Boats  
Vessels of freedom  
Harbors of heeling  
Boats  
  
Newport is where John hung his hat  
Til he lost his wife Jo  
Now forty feet of sail antique  
Is where Ol John calls home  
He watched his life pass before his eyes  
In the middle of a hurricane  
Came out alive on the other side  
Thats where the other side got its name  
  
Chorus  
  
Twenty years of a landlocked job  
Was all that tom could take  
Sitting at his desk  
All alone and depressed  
Says this just cant be my fate  
Went home that night and told his wife  
You can tell all of your friends  
Its been real but it aint been fun  
Gonna get us one of them  
  
Chorus  
  
Vessels of freedom  
Boats
