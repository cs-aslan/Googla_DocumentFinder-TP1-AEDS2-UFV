Im kicking off from center field  
A question of being down for the game  
The one shot deal dont matter  
And the other ones the same  
  
Oh My friend I see you  
Want you to come through alright  
And shes standing in the shadows  
Where the street lights all turn blue  
  
She leaving for an American uhuh  
Suitcase in her hand  
I said her brothers and her sisters  
Are all on Atlantic sand  
  
Shes screaming through the alley way  
I hear the lonely cry why cant you  
And her batteries are corroded  
And her hundred watt bulb just blew  
  
Lallallal alright huhuhhuh  
  
She used to hang out at Miss Lucys  
Every weekend they would get loose  
And it was a straight clear case of  
Having taken in too much juice  
  
It was outside and it was outside  
Just the nature of the person  
Now all you got to remember  
After all its just show biz  
  
Lallalal huhuh lallal  
  
Were just screaming through the alley way  
I hear her lonely cry ah why cant you  
And shes standing in the shadows  
Canal street lights all turn blue  
And shes standing in the shadows  
Where the street lights all turn blue  
And shes standing in the shadows  
Down where the street lights all turn blue  
Hey hey yeah
