Its the end of the night  
I want to know you  
Get the phone call a cab and take you home yeah  
I think theres something you should know  
Ill send my boys an order through Interflora  
Tell you lies like I love you and I adore you  
I think theres something you should know  
  
Im a Love Cheat  
And you look so sweet  
Can take you home where I live  
Lay you by the fire  
Love me lady  
Im a liar  
  
The curtains closed  
And the night is fun  
I think its time for me to not be home alone  
I think Ill put the cat out and give the dog a bone  
I hardly know you but I like your figure  
Suppose Ill read about you in The Mirror  
I think theres something everybody should know  
  
Im a Love Cheat  
And you look so sweet  
Can take you home where I live  
Lay you by the fire  
Love me lady  
Im a liar  
  
Im a Love Cheat  
And youre looking so sweet  
Can take you home where I live  
Lay you by the fire  
Love me lady  
Im a liar  
  
You love me  
You love me  
You love me  
You need me  
Im a liar  
You want me  
You need me  
You want me  
And Im a liar
