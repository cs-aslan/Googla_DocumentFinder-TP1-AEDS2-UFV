Somethings calling in the night  
Electric madness roars in sight  
  
Heat is rising blazing fast  
Hot and evil feel the blast  
  
Out of control about to explode  
Its coming at ya  
  
Here comes the metal meltdown  
Run for your lives  
Cant stop the metal meltdown  
Noone survives  
  
Raging fury  
Wired for sound  
Nitro bombshell  
Shakes the ground  
  
High and mighty  
Rips the air  
Piercing lazer  
Burning glaze  
  
Out of control  
About to explode  
Its coming at ya  
  
Here comes the metal meltdown  
Run for your lives  
Cant stop the metal meltdown  
Noone survives  
  
Temperature is boiling  
Magnifying might  
Feeding like a virus  
Flashing light  
  
Imminent collision  
Shockwaves all around  
Generating energy  
Screams so loud  
  
Its comin meltdown  
Start runnin countdown
