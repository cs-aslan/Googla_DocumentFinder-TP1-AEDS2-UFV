Sunny days seem to hurt the most  
I wear the pain like a heavy coat  
I feel you everywhere I go  
I see your smile I see your face  
I hear you laughing in the rain  
I still cant believe youre gone  
  
It aint fair you died too young  
Like a story that had just begun  
But death tore the pages all away  
God knows how I miss you  
All the hell that Ive been through  
Just knowing no one could take your place  
Sometimes I wonder who youd be today  
  
Would you see the world would you chase your dreams  
Settle down with a family  
I wonder what would you name your babies  
Some days the skys so blue  
I feel like I can talk to you  
I know it might sound crazy  
  
It aint fair you died too young  
Like a story that had just begun  
But death tore the pages all away  
God knows how I miss you  
All the hell that Ive been through  
Just knowing no one could take your place  
Sometimes I wonder who youd be today  
  
Today today today  
Today today today  
  
Sunny days seem to hurt the most  
I wear the pain like a heavy coat  
The only thing that gives me hope  
Is I know Ill see you again someday  
  
Someday someday
