They brang us up with horns and hollywooden songs  
Dead snakes and poisoned wisdoms between our teeth  
The evil thats been done still is carrying on  
And on this night therell be no peace  
  
The old leaders bones still beat on our homes  
They built our life before us we had no choice  
The evil thats been done still is carrying on  
And when theyre gone well be the voice  
  
Blue bird on a rock slow wind blowing soft  
Across the bare face of the sleeping lake  
Rise up and be free voice whispered to me  
And in this way you will awake  
  
Go climb up on a hill stand perfectly still  
And silently soak up the day  
Dont rush and dont you roam dont feel so alone  
And in this way you will awake  
  
And in this way you will awake  
And this way you will awake  
  
Pick up the pieces you see before you  
Dont let your weaknesses destroy you  
You know wherever you go the world will follow  
So let your reasons be true to you  
  
Stay close to your friends up until the end  
And when they know that you feel the same way  
Rise up and be free and die happily  
And in this way you will awake  
  
And in this way you will awake  
And this way you will awake
