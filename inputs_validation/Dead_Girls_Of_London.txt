Cmon everybody and lets get together tonight  
Got some money in my jeans and Im really gonna spend it right  
No more movies for a week or two  
No more running round with the usual crew  
Ah who cares  
Cmon everybody  
Well my babys number one but I gotta dance with three or four  
The place is really shaking form the bare feet slapping on the floor  
When you hear the music you cant sit still  
Your brother wont rock but your sister will  
Whoo  
Cmon everybody  
My place is really rocking so we gotta put a guard outside  
If my folks come home Im afraid theyre gonna have my hide  
No more movies for a week or two  
No more running round with the usual crew  
Who cares
