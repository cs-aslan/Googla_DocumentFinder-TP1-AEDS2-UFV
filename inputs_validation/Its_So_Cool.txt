Its so hard to be someone  
Its so hard to be unkwown  
In your heart you are to blame  
In your heart you play the game  
  
Do you realize you pay the price  
Do you know the cost of all your vice  
Save your soul its all a test  
Save your soul its for the best  
  
We need love love love love love love  
We need love love love love love love  
We need love love love love love love  
We need love love love love love love  
  
Save your soul little sister  
Save your soul dear little brother  
You need hope says the preacher  
Learn to cope says all my teachers  
  
Do you really know Gods intention  
Do you ever ask what its all for  
We need love love and love  
We need more more and more  
  
We need love love love love love love  
We need love love love love love love  
We need love love love love love love  
We need love love love love love love  
  
We need love love love love love love  
We need love love love love love love  
We need love love love love love love  
We need love love love love love love  
  
Prophets are telling us  
Were near the end  
But I am telling you  
That its all pretend  
  
Its so cool to be uncool  
Its so right to be unright  
Its so good to look so bad  
Isnt this the best thing you ever had  
  
Its so cool to be uncool  
Its so right to be unright  
Its so good to look so bad  
Isnt this the best thing you ever had  
  
We need love love love love love love  
We need love love love love love love  
We need love love love love love love  
We need love love love love love love  
  
We need love love love love love love  
We need love love love love love love
