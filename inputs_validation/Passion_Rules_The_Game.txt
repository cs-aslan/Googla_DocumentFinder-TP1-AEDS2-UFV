Stranded in this town  
My machine slows down  
To take me where the night begins  
Im playing everywhere  
Loving here and there  
I always take the chance to win  
Drove a million miles  
Gambling rules my life  
I only stop to start again  
  
I reach out through the air  
Good luck is everywhere  
Can almost touch it with my hands  
  
Just a little luck tonight  
Will do and dreams come true  
Just a little luck tonight  
I cant stop the wheel  
That turns the ball of steel  
  
When passion rules the game  
I aint got no control when my hearts in flames  
  
Im a stranger in this town  
Life takes me up and down  
Ill break the score until Im free  
Cant stop to roll the dice  
And in the morning light  
A girl like you is all I need  
  
Dont you need some love tonight  
I do yes I do  
Dont you need some love tonight  
How can we stand the heat  
When love is all we need  
  
When passion rules the game  
I aint got no control when my hearts in flames
