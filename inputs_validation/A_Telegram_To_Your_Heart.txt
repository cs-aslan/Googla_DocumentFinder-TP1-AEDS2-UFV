Oh reach out to my dream  
All the masquerade of loneliness  
Youre a fool baby  
It seems words can not express  
Oh only your lonely heart can show  
Youre made for me I know  
Its the time for our love  
A telegram to your heart  
A telegram to your love  
Need your kisses  
Baby baby need that stuff  
A telegram to your heart  
A telegram to your mind  
Need your kisses  
Always like the first time  
A telegram to your heart  
A telegram to your soul  
A telegram to your heart  
A telegram to your soul  
It started in heaven  
I was lost in your lonely world  
Ill be there forever  
Oh youre gonna be my girl  
There must be more to live take care  
Our love survive for share  
Your love with me tonight
