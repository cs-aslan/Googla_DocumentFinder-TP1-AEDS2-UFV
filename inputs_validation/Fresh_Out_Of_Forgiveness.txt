Dont tell me youre sorry for thing you caused me  
And from from now on youll be true  
And dont dont you ask me to forgive you again Im fresh out of forgiveness
for you  
  
Now I I gave you everything I knew how to give  
Now Ive done done everything youve ever asked me to do  
But even even a fool gets so tired being fool Im fresh out of forgiveness for
you  
  
No I I cant I just cant I cant forgive you this time if I did oh I know you
do  
Well youre just too just too wrong and you hurt me hurt me again  
And Im fresh out of forgiveness for you Im fresh out of forgiveness for you
