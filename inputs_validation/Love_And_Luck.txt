Better days are in the cards I can feel it  
Feel it in the changing winds feel it when I fly  
So talk to me I will listen to your story  
Been around enough to see theres more than meets the eye  
  
Everybody needs a little good luck charm  
A little grisgris keeps us safe from harm  
Rub yours on me and Ill rub mine on you  
Luckiest couple on the avenue  
  
With little love and luck we will get by  
With a little love and luck well take the sky  
In this megalomodern world youve got to try  
Try a little love and luck you will get by  
  
Mysteries  dont ever try to change them  
Were just players in this game and no ones keeping score  
So have your fun go ahead and tell your story  
Find yourself a lover who will glue you to the floor  
  
Everybody needs a little good luck charm  
A little grisgris keeps us safe from harm  
Rub yours on me and Ill rub mine on you  
Luckiest couple on the avenue  
  
With a little luck we will get by  
With a little love and luck well take the sky  
In this megalomodern world youve got to try  
Try a little love and luck you will get by
