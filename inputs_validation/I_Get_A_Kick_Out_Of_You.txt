My story is much  
To sad to be told  
But practically everything  
Leaves me totally cold  
The only exception  
I know is the case  
When Im out on a quiet spree  
Fighting vainly the old ennui  
Then I suddenly turn and see  
Your fabulous face  
  
Chorus  
  
I get no kick from champagne  
Mere alcohol  
Doesnt thrill me at all  
  
So tell me why  
Should it be true  
That I get a  
Kick out of you  
  
Some like the perfume from Spain  
Im sure  
That if I took even one sniff  
It would bore me terrifically too  
But I get a kick out of you  
  
Some like the boptype refrain  
Im sure that if  
I heard even one riff  
It would bore me terrifically too  
But I get a kick out of you  
  
Some they may go for cocaine  
Im sure that if  
I took even one sniff  
It would bore me  
Terrifically too  
But I get a kick out of you  
  
I get a kick every time  
I see you  
Standing there before me  
I get a kick though  
Its clear to see  
You obviously do not adoreme  
  
I get no kick in a plane  
Flying too high  
With some gal in the sky  
Is my idea of nothing to do  
But I get a kick out of you
