If you were a baby I would take you and run  
I could hide you in the folds of my heart  
Theres a truth in the madness that I cant get beyond  
And a fever that wont leave me alone  
  
I dont want my heart  
Dont want my head  
Dont want my friends  
Dont want my bed  
I cant live with myself  
I cant live with myself  
Cant take no help  
I try to want to  
But I cant get beyond you  
  
I will stare from the window  
At the shapes in the rain  
As the space between us drives me insane  
  
I cant live with myself  
I cant live with myself  
Cant take no help  
Dont want no one else  
  
If I was a child  
I would refuse to leave  
I would sit down on the street  
Kick my legs and scream  
  
Im not much of a man  
But I know how I am  
I know this wont fade away  
I will pretend and be strong  
But I wonder where I belong  
  
And the feeling comes in waves  
A hole in my body aching  
Like a heart dying  
A soul crying  
Exhausted and insecure  
Took all you have and I still want more  
So I reach out to hold you  
But all I do is hurt you  
Hurt you  
  
I cant live with myself  
I cant live with myself  
Cant take no help  
I try to want to  
But I cant get beyond you  
  
If I was a child I would take you and run  
And I say I dont know But I know  
And I say Ill go  
  
You just spent the whole day  
Driving away
