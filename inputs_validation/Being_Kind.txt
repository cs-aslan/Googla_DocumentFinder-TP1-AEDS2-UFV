Please dont worry now about the mornin  
When its time well sip our wine and sleep  
Woah but Ive been known  
To love more than one person  
Woah and Ive been shown  
That bein kind can hurt someone sometimes  
  
Listen to my words now look no further  
What youve seen is what I mean no more  
Woah but Ive been known  
To love more than one person  
Woah and Ive been shown  
That bein kind can hurt someone sometimes  
  
Dont dream of answers cause you know Ive none to give  
They burn like cancers they just wont let you live  
  
Ive been known  
To love more than one person  
And Ive been shown  
That bein kind can hurt someone sometimes  
  
Dont dream of answers cause you know Ive none to give  
We move like dancers steppin on each other to live  
And pouncin hard  
Like animals in the yard  
And theres no healin lookin feelin  
Theres no denyin that bein kind can hurt  
Someone sometimes  
Oh theres no denyin woah lord theres no denyin  
That bein kind can hurt someone sometimes
