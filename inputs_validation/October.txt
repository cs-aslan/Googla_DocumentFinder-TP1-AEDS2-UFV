I cant run anymore  
I fall before you  
Here I am  
I have nothing left  
Though Ive tried to forget  
Youre all that I am  
Take me home  
Im through fighting it  
Broken  
Lifeless  
I give up  
Youre my only strength  
Without you  
I cant go on  
Anymore  
Ever again  
  
My only hope  
All the times Ive tried  
My only peace  
To walk away from you  
My only joy  
My only strength  
I fall into your abounding grace  
My only power  
My only life  
And love is where I am  
My only love  
  
I cant run anymore  
I give myself to you  
Im sorry  
Im sorry  
In all my bitterness  
I ignored  
All thats real and true  
All I need is you  
When night falls on me  
Ill not close my eyes  
Im too alive  
And youre too strong  
I cant lie anymore  
I fall down before you  
Im sorry  
Im sorry  
  
My only hope  
All the times Ive tried  
My only peace  
To walk away from you  
My only joy  
My only strength  
I fall into your abounding grace  
My only power  
My only life  
And love is where I am  
My only love  
  
Constantly ignoring  
The pain consuming me  
But this time its cut too deep  
Ill never stray again  
  
My only hope  
All the times Ive tried  
My only peace  
To walk away from you  
My only joy  
My only strength  
I fall into your abounding grace  
My only power  
My only life  
And love is where I am  
My only love  
My only hope  
All the times Ive tried  
My only peace  
To walk away from you  
My only joy  
My only strength  
I fall into your abounding grace  
My only power  
My only life  
And love is where I am  
My only love
