Santas gonna come and make him mine this Christmas  
Santas gonna come and make him mine mine  
Oh Santa  
Santas gonna come and make him mine this Christmas  
Santas gonna come and make him mine mine  
Oh Santa  
  
Santa  
If you get this letter  
Wont you help me out  
I know youre kinda busy with your elves right now  
And I dont know how  
You do the things you do while I sleep on Christmas Eve  
  
But its amazing  
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby  
Because every time I see Christmas lights  
I feel this burn inside  
And I just cant take it  
  
I saw them shopping last week  
And his new girl was so bleak  
And then I swore to myself  
Santas gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night  
Oh oh oh  
  
Santas gonna come and make you mine this Christmas  
Santas gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
Santas gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night  
  
Oh Santa  
I heard that its really gonna snow this year  
So I hope Rudolph and them all the eight reindeer  
Get you safely here  
So you can scoop him up  
And scoop him right down my chimney  
  
Ive been really really really good this year  
So put on that red suit and make him appear  
Make this Christmas cheer  
Just aint the same without my baby  
Come on oh Kris Kringle send me help  
  
They say its unrealistic  
But I believe in you Saint Nick  
So grant this wish for me right quick  
Santa wont you come and make him mine this Christmas night  
  
Oh oh oh  
Santas gonna come and make you mine this Christmas  
Santas gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
Santas gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night  
Oh Santa Oh Santa Oh Santa  
  
Santas gonna come and make you mine this Christmas  
Santas gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
Santas gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night  
Oh Santa  
  
Oh Santa Claus  
If you get this letter  
Please dont make me wait  
Cause all December Ill be counting down the days  
So hop on your sleigh  
I promise that I wont forget the milk and cookies  
  
The trees all sparkly and gold  
But inside I feel so cold  
So soon as you leave the North Pole  
Santa wont you come and make him mine this Christmas  
  
Santas gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
oh oh oh this Christmas  
Santas gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
Santas gonna come and make you mine mine
