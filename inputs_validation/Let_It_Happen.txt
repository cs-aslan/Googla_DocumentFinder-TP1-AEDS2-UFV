Such a sad procession  
Winding down the lane  
What a strange impression  
Was branded on my brain  
  
A band was playing endless mindless  
It was like a hooligans lament  
It was dumb but it was timeless  
I still wonder what it meant  
  
But whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
  
Behold the lights of London  
The skipper said as his hands shook  
His aura eaten by his jealousy  
And all the drugs he took  
He said This is the real world Buddy  
  
Toughen up your ass or itll break  
I said Im not your buddy Buddy  
And your real world is a fake  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
The DJ took his vengeance  
As the weeding guests arrive  
  
There was malice in his handshake  
Quicksand in his eyes  
As he slunk across the courtyard  
From faroff I heard a horn  
Somewhere in the bleak middistance  
Something beautiful is born  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
  
I stumbled down a street of shadows  
A black hallelujah split the night  
Anarchists and priests were playing strip jack  
Underneath the crude lamplight  
I came upon a weeping soldier  
He said Im all washed up now hush   
But when I glanced across his shoulder  
He held the royal flush  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
Im still here Im still breathing  
Im who I thought I was or just about  
Ill be walking down this boulevard  
Until my legs give out  
  
Thoughts like storms and seas are raging  
I know it is a matter of degree  
But its not the world outside thats changing  
Its me  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
  
Whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected  
Over me
