I was walking by the river I was asking myself questions  
But the answers I came up with didnt fit  
Some have breakfast in bed some arent properly fed  
The way they talk about it makes me want to spit  
  
And theyre raising all their eyebrows at the raising of the pound  
Whilst they raise another city to the ground  
And were opening the doors and walking round on all fours  
Looking for a sense in lost and found  
  
Anxious Dont they know it is wrong it makes me anxious  
Anxious Dont they know it is wrong it makes me anxious  
  
I really thought Id have my tongue ties if I stood up to shout  
But all they did was listen without their ears  
And I thought Id be beheaded if I stuck my neck out  
But they just gave me a hanky for my tears  
  
I have confidence in confidence I hope that hope pulls me through  
But I think a little more is needed now  
Weve got to form a congregation and sink down the nation  
Batter all the sinners to the ground  
  
Anxious Dont they know it is wrong it makes me anxious  
Anxious Dont they know it is wrong it makes me anxious  
  
Anxious Dont they know it is wrong it makes me anxious  
Anxious Dont they know it is wrong it makes me anxious
