I didnt see the signs posted on the road  
Dead end gives way to the cliff that soars  
And I lose control your face still looks bored  
One two fuck you  
I wont change for you  
  
Wrong way  
This time its going down  
You say Im immature  
to hang around  
Okay  
Faceplant to the ground  
I wont change for you  
I wont change for you  
  
Tonight I wash my hands of you  
You set the bar I could not live up to  
Tonight the light in breaking through  
So thank you very little and send me postcards from hell  
  
This relationship is over as we scrape the ledge  
and you call me a loser falling over the edge  
Like youre cutting all your losses  
Like a bet you can hedge  
One two fuck you  
I wont change for you  
  
A black eye  
and my heart is ripped out of my chest  
Crucified  
For not passing any of your stupid tests  
Goodbye  
Right now I could care less  
  
I wont change for you  
I wont change for you  
  
Tonight I wash my hands of you  
You set the bar I could not live up to  
Tonight the light in breaking through  
So thank you very little and send me postcards from hell  
  
Weve come a long way  
Dont look down  
Your heart is rotten  
Your heart is rotten  
Too bad it was the wrong way  
Wont be long now  
Till we hit the rock  
Bottom  
  
Tonight I wash my hands of you  
You set the bar I could not live up to  
Tonight the light in breaking through  
So thank you very little and send me postcards from hell  
  
Tonight I wash my hands of you  
You set the bar I could not live up to  
Tonight the light in breaking through  
So thank you very little and send me postcards from hell
