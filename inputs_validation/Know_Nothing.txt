Everything that you know is as wrong as the next  
So you hold on to something and hope for the best  
And you know that its right til you find that its left  
And Im doing the same and I have to confess  
  
That I know nothing  
I never knew that thered be nothing and no one to show you the way  
I know nothing  
When all I do is make it through to the end of the day  
  
All my senses are pushing the whole other way  
I cant see where to look now whats that that you say  
Its a beautiful world its a beautiful day  
And I wish I could say if I was feeling the same  
  
When I know nothing  
I never knew that thered be nothing and no one to show you the way  
I know nothing  
I need an Obiwan to tell me if Ive gone astray  
  
And I wish it was clearer to see  
If you are what youre made out to be  
But theres no guarantee if youre you and Im me  
And there never will be til I can see what you see  
  
When I know nothing  
I never knew that thered be nothing and no one to show you the way  
I know nothing  
When all I do is make it through to the end of the day  
  
I know nothing  
I never knew that thered be nothing and no one to show you the way  
I know nothing  
When all I do is make it through to the end of the day  
  
When I know nothing  
I never knew that thered be  
Know nothing  
I never knew that thered be
