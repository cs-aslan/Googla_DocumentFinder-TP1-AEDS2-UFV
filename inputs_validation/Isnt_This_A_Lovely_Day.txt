The weather is frightening  
The thunder and lightning  
Seem to be having their way  
But as far as Im concerned its a lovely day  
The turn in the weather  
Will keep us together  
So I can honestly say  
That as far as Im concerned its a lovely day  
And everythings okay  
  
Isnt this a lovely day to be caught in the rain  
You were going on your way now youve got to remain  
  
Just as you were going leaving me all at sea  
The clouds broke they broke and oh what a break for me  
  
I can see the sun up high though were caught in a storm  
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm  
  
Let the rain pitter patter  
But it really doesnt matter  
If the skies are gray  
Long as I can be with you its a lovely day
