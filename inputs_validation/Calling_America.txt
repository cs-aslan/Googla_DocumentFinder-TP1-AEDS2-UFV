Somebody told her that there was a place like heaven  
Across the water on a 747  
Yeah were living in  
In a modern world  
  
And pretty soon shes really got the notion  
Of flying out across the big blue ocean  
Yeah were living in  
In a modern world  
  
Talk is cheap on satellite  
But all I get is static information  
Im still here redial on automatic  
  
Calling America cant get a message through  
Calling America thats what she said to do  
Calling America thats where she has to be  
Calling America she left a number for me  
Calling America  
  
But Im just talking to a satellite  
Twenty thousand miles up in the sky each night  
Yeah were living in  
In a modern world  
  
All I had to do was pick up the phone  
Im out in space trying to talk to someone  
Yeah were living in  
In a modern world  
  
She left a number I could call  
But no ones there no one at all  
There must be something going wrong  
That number just rings on and on  
  
Calling America cant get a message through  
Calling America thats what she said to do  
Calling America thats where she has to be  
Calling America she left a number for me  
Calling America  
  
Said shed call when shed been gone a while  
Guess shes missing me across the miles  
Yeah were living in  
In a modern world  
  
Calling America cant get a message through  
Calling America thats what she said to do  
Calling America thats where she has to be  
Calling America she left a number for me  
Calling America
