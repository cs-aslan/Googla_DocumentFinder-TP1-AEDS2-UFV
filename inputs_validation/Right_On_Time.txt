Yeah uhh  
They no I wanna shine they turn my lights off  
They no I love to rhyme they turn my mic off  
What can a do to get this dirt off my shoulder  
Man these haters be hatin  
They don wanna see me  
Happy happy happy

Happy happy happy  
They just wanna see me  
Down down down

Down down down

What can I do about about it  
Not an damn thing  
Im tired of everybody sayin I cant sing  
Well look at me now Im singing freely for you haters  
What are you gonna do with 209

Plus the flow is colder then sarah palins home town  
If I wasnt me Id prob be moody too  
You dont like me and rock  
What we do to you  
Did we crash and party  
Take your girl steal your gig  
Or all of the above  
Well then Ifeel ya kid  
Bein me is like a gift an a curse  
Because even though Im the best  
They wish me the worst  
They be judging on my records  
Without listenin first  
But my song go for their  
She aint skippin a verse  
Nahh  
I can accomplish all my goals  
Even if Im blind folded  
If you dont wanna see me happy keep  
Your eyes closed  
Hookx3  
What am I gonna do

Ohhh
