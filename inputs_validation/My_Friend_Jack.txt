My friend jack eats sugar loaves  
Sugarman hasnt got a care  
Hes been traveling everywhere  
Been on a voyage across an ocean  
Heard the sweet sounds of wheels in motion  
Hes seen hawks fly high to hail the setting sun

Sugarman hasnt got a care  
Hes been traveling everywhere  
Hes seen the people in the city  
And the bright lights looks awful pretty  
Hes followed dusty tracks into eternity  
Eating sugar cain in cuba

On the west coast hes real famous  
Kids they call him sugar man
