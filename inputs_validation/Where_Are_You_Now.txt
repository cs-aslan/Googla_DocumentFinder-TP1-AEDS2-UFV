Where are you now  
When I need you the most  
Why dont you take my hand  
I wanna be close  
  
Help me when I am down  
Lift me up off the ground  
Teach me right from wrong  
Help me to stay strong  
  
So take my hand and walk with me  
Show me what to be  
I need you to set me free  
Yeah  
  
Where are you now  
Where are you now  
Now that Im half grown  
Why are we far apart  
I feel so alone  
  
Where are you now  
When nothings going right  
Where are you now  
I cant see the light  
  
So take my hand and walk with me  
Show me what to be  
I need you to set me free  Yeah  
  
I need you  
To need me  
Cant you see me  
How could you leave me  
My heart is  
Half empty  
Im not whole  
When your not with me  
I want you here with me  
To get me hold me and love me now  
  
Where are you now  
Oh where are you now  
  
So take my hand and walk with me  
Show me what to be  
I need you to set me free  
Yeah  
Oh oh  
Yeah
