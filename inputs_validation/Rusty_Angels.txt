They say you came from heaven but I know thats not the truth  
Cause I dont think an angel could look anything like you  
Your eyes are made from sapphires and your heart is made from stone  
You gotta be the closest thing to hate Ive ever known  
And if I didnt know better Id say you had come alone to the party  
Oh yeah  
  
The light is always shining but you swear that its gone black  
The tide is always turning but youre never looking back  
If I didnt know better Id say times were pretty bad  
Because Rusty Angels they cant fly  
Rusty Angels gonna die yeah  
Rusty Angels they cant fly  
Rusty Angels gonna die gonna die  
  
The gifts you bring are fire and your dreams they turned to dust  
Your flying days are over and your wings have turned to rust  
If I didnt know better Id say all you had is lost  
Because Rusty Angels they cant fly  
Rusty Angels gonna die yeah  
Rusty Angels they cant fly  
Rusty Angels gonna die gonna die  
  
If you swallow just a little pride you might find a little love inside  
Open up and let somebody in cause if you need somebody  
You know its not a sin  
  
Rusty Angels they cant fly Rusty Angels gonna die yeah  
Rusty Angels they cant fly no Rusty Angels gonna die  
Gonna die yeah you cant fly oh no  
Gonna die oh yeah you cant fly oh no
