Ive got this friend who is lonely  
Shes afraid shell never find her one and only  
A little shy but she can be fun  
If the right guy came along  
Would you know someone  
  
Ive got this friend and it sounds crazy  
But hes been feeling that way too a whole lot lately  
And interested oh Im sure hed be  
I can almost speak for him  
Hes that close to me  
  
Maybe in each other  
They might find the lover  
Theyve been missin until now  
Theyd trust the judgment of  
Two friends like us who care so much  
Can we get them togethersomehow
