Thomas Anderss single  
  
Took a plane straight away from Las Vegas to you  
Entertain and enchant thats what Im gonna do  
Its burning like fire its dancers delight  
Takes you higher and higher and higher tonight  
  
Chor  
Cause when I look into your eyes  
You will be captured and mesmerized  
  
Take your chances  
  
Chor  
Come on and feel the magic groove  
The rhythms gonne make you move  
For tonight  
  
LOVE  Heart attack  
Im gonna bring you the feeling back  
LOVE Girls be tough  
Baby Ive got what you need cause Im the KING OF LOVE  
  
Do you belong to someone else or will you stay for tonight  
Is there someone in your life or can you go for a ride  
Tell me how does it feel when youre touched by a KING  
Oh your heart will be burning when Im starting to sing  
  
Chor  
Cause when I look into your eyes  
You will be captured and mesmerized  
  
Take your chances  
  
Chor  
Come on and feel the magic groove  
The rhythms gonne make you move  
For tonight  
  
LOVE  Heart attack  
Im gonna bring you the feeling back  
LOVE Girls be tough  
Baby Ive got what you need cause Im the KING OF LOVE
