Baby baby baby hurt me bad  
Baby baby  
Baby baby made me cry  
Baby I want to die  
  
Somebody tell me where shes hiding out  
I gotta find that cheatin gal  
Cant go cant go cant go sleep at night  
Cant sleep cant sleep  
Its not right  
  
Sunlight sunlight in my eyes  
Sunlight makes me rise  
I cant sleep until my baby says its over  
I gotta hear it face to face  
I love you darlin its a cryin shame  
The way you run around like youre in a big game  
Im so unhappy I could cry every time I think about you  
Boo hoo  
  
Baby baby baby please come back  
Baby baby  
Sunlight sunlight in my eyes  
Sunlight makes me rise  
I cant sleep until my baby says its over  
I gotta hear it face to face  
I love you darlin its a cryin shame  
The way you run around like youre in a big game  
I shoot around in a trance all day and think about you  
All the time  
  
I love you darlin its a cryin shame  
The way you run around like youre in a big game  
Its so unfair that youre so happy when Im hurtin inside  
  
I love you darlin its a cryin shame  
The way you run around like youre in a big game  
Im so unhappy I could cry every time I think about you  
Boo hoo
