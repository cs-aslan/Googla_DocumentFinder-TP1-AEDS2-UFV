You never try to keep the wild ones home  
But mister dont just sit there and wait  
Go out on the town makin all of the rounds  
It dont matter if youre your own date  
  
Vacantly occupied sat on the beach til my body got fried  
Dreamin of your pretty eyes up in South Carolina  
I cant pronounce my ares or gs when Im speakin Southerneese  
Honey do Honey come and do me again  
  
Ive seen your fat cats style  
Three hundred pounds of jive ass smile  
Young girls gigglin all the while  
Thats not my cup of chowder  
  
I go for candlelight  
Cold champagne nearly every night  
Honey do a little toast to me and you  
  
Honey why couldnt you have taken the non stop train  
Im hungry and I really want to see you again  
  
I know its gettin late  
Waiter keeps starin at your empty plate  
Maitred keeps tellin me  
Sir shes just not coming  
  
Now what the hell does Garcon know  
Weve been through all this before  
Honey do Honey come and do me again  
  
Honey why couldnt you have taken the non stop train  
Im hungry and I really want to see you again  
  
Vacantly occupied sat on the beach til my body got fried  
Dreamin of your pretty eyes up in South Carolina  
I cant pronounce my ares or gs when Im speakin Southerneese  
Honey do Honey come and do me again  
Yeah Honey do Honey come and do me again
