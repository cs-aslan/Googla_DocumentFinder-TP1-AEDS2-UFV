The Westcoast Warlord  
The Grand Wizard  
Ice Cube  
Motherfuckers head so big they call him jack in the box  
  
Verse 1  
Im a superhero like Lou Ferrigno  
Made by the Nero look like a zero  
Shine the spotlight this is my night  
Get your cameras ready let it rain confetti  
Im a champion I do what cant be done  
In the real league nerd not the fantasy one  
Throw your hands up you can cheer for your boy  
When I hit the stage get an ear full of noise  
When I bring the noise from here to Illinois  
Motherfuckers love when I do what it does  
A allstar superstar entertainer  
World class first ballot halloffamer  
Some rappers claim that they got a heart full of anger  
How when your lyrics werent written by a stranger  
Fool Im the greatest you just the latest  
Im loved by your grand mama and your baby  
  
Chorus  
See my head is so big they call me jack in the box  
You cant impress me so fuck what you got  
I said my head is so big they call me jack in the box  
Dont talk about money cause Im stacking a lot  
  
Bridge  
Shine that light on me put that light on me  
Cause I was sent to the world by GOD  
Shine that light on me put that light on me  
Cause I was sent to the world by GOD  
  
Verse 2  
I was a born loser I was a born sinner  
Now I am a winner in a convincing sinner  
I got to take a bow cause I still wonder how  
The system didnt get me when I was a juvenile  
Just think if I had got locked up  
No Boyz in da Hood thanks to America  
No Eazy NWA no Friday  
Dont let your motherfucking talent go to waste  
Dont catch a case cause these people got a place  
To throw your life away and take you right out the waste  
Throw your hands up you got to man up  
I had to show the world what I was made of  
What you say Blood I was a slad cause  
Now Im VIP up in Vegas  
Im up in Niketown so how you like me now  
See the whole industry had to bite my style  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
  
Now mama dont be mad I got to show my ass  
And thanks these motherfuckers for my past  
I got to let them know I never break like glass  
What you looking at its top notch world class  
  
Mama dont be mad I got to show my ass  
And thanks these motherfuckers for my past  
I got to let them know I never break like glass  
What you looking at its top notch world class  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge
