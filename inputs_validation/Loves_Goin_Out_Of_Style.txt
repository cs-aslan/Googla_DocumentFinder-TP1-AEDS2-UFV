I got nothin  
But this early day  
Spent all my money  
Threw it all away  
  
Time to kill  
But shes on my mind  
Mister Real Bad Luck  
Missed a real good time  
  
So if you see me  
Dont say hello  
I never put that diamond on  
  
Chorus  
Cause Ive got the keys to the highway  
Since she saw the light  
Now I got nothin but my freedom  
And this beat up heart of mine  
I got no regrets no nothin  
She took me for a ride  
And I guess loves goin out of style  
  
She was a dancer  
In a topless place  
She came home early  
And you shoulda seen her face  
  
Roll and rumble  
Feelin like a crook  
Lean back and think about it  
Leafin thru my little black book  
  
So if you see me  
Dont say hello  
I never put that diamond on  
  
Cause Ive got the keys to the highway  
Since she saw the light  
I got nothin but my freedom  
And this beat up heart of mine  
  
I got no regrets no nothin  
She took me for a ride  
And I guess loves goin out of style  
  
Break  
  
Chorus  
Cause Ive got the keys to the highway  
Since she saw the light  
I got nothin but my freedom  
And this beat up heart of mine  
I got no regrets no nothin  
She took me for a ride  
And I guess loves goin out of style  
  
Yeah Loves goin out of style  
  
Yeah  
  
Loves goin
