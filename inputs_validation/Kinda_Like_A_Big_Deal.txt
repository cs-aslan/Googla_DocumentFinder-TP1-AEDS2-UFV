Til the casket drops  
Third times a charm right  
Ha ha come on  
  
Im kinda like a big deal  
Its unbelievable you see my warning gives you big chills  
The flow runnin on Bigs heels  
My life after death Big aint get to see how this feels  
Third times a charm baby  
After two classics another stripe up on my arm baby  
Its a blessin to blow a hundred thou in a recession  
With no second guessin  
Ha ha were ballin drop tops were floorin  
Champagne were pourin  
Reup is the gang and Im all in  
To the powder and the flame I have fallin  
Get money blow money is my callin  
Yugch Watch a nigga burn through it  
Lifes a maze you twist and you turn through it  
The driest of droughts maneuvered and I earned through it  
Im set straight like a perm do it Push  
  
They whisperin about us  
I know you haters doubt us  
How you count our money we aint even finish countin  
Pardon me I must say Im kinda like a big deal  
  
Ay yo Im sittin on top of the  
Its more than a feeling aint it  
I be killin damn it Im illin Im illin  
Eh eh eh meet Mr Popular  
Go get your binoculars  
And see Penthouse 3 where a nigga be  
Spittin fire on the PJ in my PJs  
Fire Marshall said I took it to the Max like TJ  
Yall aint peep I said Marshalls we play  
I guess Im like the Black Marshall meets Jay  
Meet Ye alligator souffle had it made  
Special Ed got head from a girl in Special Ed  
Ya know the pretty ones in that dumb class  
But she got that dumb ass  
Hit high school and got pregnant dumb fast  
What happen Tisha your boyfriend cum fast  
Turn around gimme pound like we folks  
Hell no I went raw dog three strokes  
  
They whisperin about us  
I know you haters doubt us  
How you count our money we aint even finish countin  
Pardon me I must say Im kinda like a big deal  
  
Lights cameras action  
The chain itselfs a damn distraction  
You claim the belt the glory I bask in  
I bee hop in the ring niggas ya cash in  
Its like stoppin a train  
Nigga think hes stoppin my reign  
Talk slick while droppin my name  
Im puttin yall to shame diamonds in the little hand  
50 percent splits I ex out the middle man  
A far cry from a stash in the rental van  
Im the reason the hood need a dental plan  
Ladies and gentleman introducin  
The C4S with the rims protrudin  
The roof vamoose like a magic show  
Got me lookin to the heavens like a javelin throw  
Yall twiddle your thumbs like the average Joe  
But just as you reap so shall you so  
  
They whisperin about us  
I know you haters doubt us  
How you count our money we aint even finish countin  
Pardon me I must say Im kinda like a big deal
