Made their threats ruin your name  
Thought I was broken but the spirit remains  
And this flame will keep on burning strong  
And I will continue to sing this song  
Badmouthed behind us taken their shots  
But this tattered body will never be stopped  
And this flame will keep on burning strong  
And I will continue to sing this song  
Weve heard it all before  
And were ready for some more  
If you think Im gonna break its  
Gonna take more than what youve got  
Dont count me out cause Ive got some more  
And Im back with more strength and vigor than before  
And this flame will keep on burning strong  
And I will continue to sing this song  
My feelings in the music and the words  
Are written in stone and I know Im not singing this song alone
