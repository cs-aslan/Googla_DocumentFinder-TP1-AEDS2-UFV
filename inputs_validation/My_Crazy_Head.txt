I keep my secrets locked up tight  
I keep my emotions out of sight  
But you got me memorized  
Whats in my heart whats behind my eyes  
You hold me tight you hold me fast  
Wont let go until the storm has passed  
When I finally break down Im so in love  
I aint afraid to ask I am not afraid no  
Baby love me out love me out of this world  
No alibis no more regrets  
Youre my wayward angel  
Youre my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head  
Youre there inside me in my dreams  
Sexy poems cinematic scenes  
Shattered lullabies unfold  
Sweet suggestions I have never known  
Pull down the shade turn off the light  
Oh my love were all alone tonight  
Shadow dancing in slowmo  
For your eyes I will let it show  
You can feel me glow  
Oh baby love me out love me out of this world  
No alibis no more regrets  
Youre my wayward angel  
Youre my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head  
Maybe its heaven or your sweet suggestion  
Holding me in your sway  
Carried away in the arms of an angel  
You are my saving grace  
Baby love me out love me out of this world  
No alibis no more regrets oh  
Youre my wayward angel  
Youre my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head  
Oh baby love me out now love me out of this world  
No alibis no more regrets no more regrets  
Youre my wayward angel  
Youre my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head oh ooh
