Im building my body  
Im happy when Im building my body  
Im tired of fighting lets make friends  
Im tired of burning both ends  
Thats why Im building my body  
It hurts me but Im building my body  
And I know what the pain is worth  
I know I feel the pain of birth  
Im pushin up  
And gettin down with my body  
Theres noone else around with my body  
One look says Im a stone disgrace  
Dont kick no sand in my face  
  
Because Im building my body strong  
Im watching what I eat  
And Im sorting out right from wrong  
Hey not a lot of meat  
And I know that it wont be long  
Before I gotta quit smoking  
  
Because Im building my body  
Im peaceful when Im building my body  
Im sweating out mistakes Ive made  
Im getting back the dues Ive paid  
Im doing more  
And getting sore with my body  
But Im gaining a rapport with my body  
And this seems like the perfect time  
They say Im in my prime  
  
Thats why Im building my body strong  
Im thinking at the table  
And Im sorting out right from wrong  
Im reading every label  
And I know that it wont be long  
Before I gotta quit smoking  
  
Cause Im building my body  
Theres someone else inside of my body  
Hes waiting to be born again
