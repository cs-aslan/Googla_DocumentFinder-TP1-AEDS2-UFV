I got so much to say  
But Im afraid itll come out wrong  
Im not akin to the Eighties thing  
Where you look after number one  
  
But I wont rock the boat  
Cause Im scared what might happen  
I wont rock the boat  
Cause Im one of the millions  
Who never seem to do anything  
He never seems to do anything  
I never seem to do anything  
He never seems to do anything  
  
And everytime I get the urge  
To strike out on my own  
Insecurity wraps me up  
Its cold outside the fold  
  
So I wont rock the boat  
Cause Im scared what might happen  
I wont rock the boat  
Cause Im the man who merely threatens  
Whos always saying what hes gonna do  
Hes always saying what hes gonna do  
Im always saying what Im gonna do  
Hes always saying what hes gonna do  
  
Im running steady  
Oh so steady  
So safe and sound  
I could drown  
  
Ive had my fill of living  
In my cosy armchair land  
But all my schemes come to a humiliating end  
  
So I wont rock the boat  
Cause Im scared what might happen  
I wont rock the boat  
Cause Im one of the millions  
Whos always saying what hes gonna do  
Hes always saying what hes gonna do  
Im always saying what Im gonna do  
Hes always saying what hes gonna do  
No I wont rock no boats  
Hes always saying what hes gonna do  
Kiss goodbye to my hopes  
Hes always saying what hes gonna do  
I wont rock no boats  
Hes always saying what hes gonna do  
Life is easy when youre being kept afloat  
I wont rock no boats
