Captain Sunshine make me drink wine  
Make me feel fine when Im feelin wrongly down  
He dont take much he dont make much  
But ah to be such a man as he  
  
And walk so pure between the earth and the sea  
Captain Sunshine he do me fine  
Make the words rhyme when he knows the tune is sad  
He dont take much he dont make much  
  
But ah to be such a man as he  
And walk so pure between the earth and the sea  
He dont take much he dont make much  
But ah to be such a man as he  
And walk so pure between the earth and the sea
