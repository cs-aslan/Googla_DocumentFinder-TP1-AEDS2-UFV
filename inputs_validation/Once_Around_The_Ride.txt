See me feel me come and touch me  
The way I touch you  
In the crossfire live wire  
Who said maybe  
I said maybe wont do  
  
The sands of time are slipping by  
Dust to dust no second try  
  
Youre only goin  
Once around the ride yea  
Youre only goin  
Once around the ride  
  
Rock hard got an ace card  
I aint crazy  
Just got nothin to do  
Day breaks Ill take  
Cant wait forever  
Cause my life will be through  
  
The sands of time are slipping by  
Dust to dust no second try  
  
Youre only goin  
Once around the ride yea  
Youre only goin  
Once around the ride  
  
Dust to dust no second try  
Youre only goin  
Once around the ride  
Once around the ride  
Once around the ride  
Once around the ride  
Once around the ride  
Once around the ride  
Once around the ride
