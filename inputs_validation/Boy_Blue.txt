Hey Boy Blue cant you hear all  
the noise  
Its for you all the towns waiting  
there  
Let us go theres a show like you aint  
seen before  
Welcome home where you been all  
these years  
Look around all the crowd is in tears  
Its so good to see you in the streets  
of your town  
  
Hey Boy Blue is back  
Hey Boy Blue is back  
Hey Boy Blue is back  
Hey Boy Blue is back  
Hey Boy Blue is back  
Hey Boy Blue is back  
  
Ive seen bold knights dropping  
down like flies  
Ive seen kings rolling in the mire  
Ive seen God point the finger of  
doom to our foes  
I have fought in the holiest wars  
I have smashed some of the holiest jaws  
Ive been jailed been impaled and  
been dragged through the world  
One thing I have learned through  
these years  
Is that no man should be stricken  
with fear  
It should be that he walks with no  
care in the world  
So my friends who are gathered here  
today  
Hear this clear for Ill not further say  
That no man shall cause me to take  
up arms again  
  
Hey Boy Blue is back  
Hey Boy Blue is back  
Hey Boy Blue is back  
Hey Boy Blue is back  
Hey Boy Blue is back  
Hey Boy Blue is back
